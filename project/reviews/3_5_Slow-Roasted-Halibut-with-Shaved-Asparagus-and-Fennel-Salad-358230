I am surprised on the number a of good reviews. This dish was average at best. I agree the salad was the best part. I feel I waisted a good piece of fish with the breading.

We made this for company. Halibut was very good -- although baking our thick piece (2.5 pounds) at 300 for 20 minutes wasn't enough. We increased the temperature to 350 and left it in the oven for about 25 minutes and it was perfectly done. The fennel-asparagus salad was good although it had a strong mustard flavor. I'd make the halibut again, but probably not the salad unless I modified it, possibly by adding some black olives and maybe a few pieces of orange.

This was an excellent meal! The only change I made was to use garlic rolls from a wonderful baker in town to make the crumbs......That combined with very fresh halibut was perfect. Loved the salad and found that if I pulled up on the asparagus as it got thinner that it was easier to shave. Looking forward to making this for company......

Absolutely delicious! The asparagus went quickly once I got the hang of using the vegetable peeler. I didn't trim the asparagus; lay each spear on cutting board holding the thick end and pull the spear against the peeler; the otherwise thick piece that you'd cut off ends up in your hand and you've not wasted any of the tender part. I took a prior reviewer's tip to add a bit of honey -- perhaps a tsp -- to salad dressing, which seemed a bit tart to me before I dressed the salad.

I didn't think this was anything special. The salad was probably the best part about it. I won't be making this one again...

This was a bit of work but worth it! I was amazed how moist and tender the halibut stayed (I think the secret is the crustless french breadcrumbs), and the flavor in the topping was delicate and yummy. The star was really the asparagus and fennel salad. I thought I'd be able to thinly slice the asparagus in the food processor, but quickly realized that wouldn't work. Shaving the asparagus with the veggie peeled was a pain, but it was a delicious way to serve asparagus (the fennel and dressing made a fantastic salad). Definitely nice enough to serve for guests, and definitely worth the trouble, but I'll probably save this for weekends when I have the patience to deal with shaving the asparagus

This was a delicious combination of flavours. Use fat asparagus for shaving. It has better flavour and is easier to shave. A great dinner!

This was so amazingly delicious! The topping was a perfect complement to the halibut -- not too overpowering. The salad was refreshing and elegant. I started to feel a bit crazy spending so much time peeling asparagus -- I'd love to find a better method. But results were worth it.

Very tasty. I added a half tablespoon of honey to the dressing since it was a bit sour for my taste. Received tons of compliments on how well the halibut was cooked! Great method!

Great dish - will be a hit for a summer dinner party. Surprisingly, the halibut at Costco was very high quality. Substituted panko for the bread crumbs and cooked less than 20 minutes. Slightly sauteed the salad.

I cut the recipe in half and our market was out of fresh bread crumbs so I used boxed. Not sure if the bread crumb replacement was the culprit, but it made way too much topping. The mixture did keep the fish nice and moist, but I don't think it it needed to go for the full 20 minutes (maybe 17 at tops). Loved the salad - a very nice accompaniment. Would do again!

We made this last night. The salad is really lovely- shaving the asparagus takes a bit of time but is worth it. The dressing is quite good. The bread crumb topping for the halibut is flavorful and nice but I found that it got soggy quickly when served.

This dish was excellent. The combination was fresh and melded well together. The asparagus peeling was a little challenging but worth it.

Very tasty and pretty simple. You definitely need a peeler than can get flat up against a cutting board to get all of the asparagus. The salad is delicious, but I couldn't get enough of the thin slices of asparagus. Cooking time was right on the money.

This dish is fresh and perfect for a special dinner. It came together in a flash, with the exception of making the bread crumbs and shaving the asparagus but both were well worth it. My friends and I drizzled a little butter over the fish when we took it out of the oven. It needed it, since there was no fat in its preparation. The salad is perfect with the fish! Our menu was a perfect springtime meal: Caprese Salad, Pea and Mint Soup and this dish.

Our whole family loved this recipe. The fish topping was delicious. I have to stay the star of the plate was the salad, and I plan on using that part of the recipe even more often than the fish. Shaving the asparagus was more cumbersome than I might have thought, because for each stalk it required individually doing a julienne as the stalk narrowed. It was worth it for sure, though.

This was delicious. I did all of the chopping and combining for the topping in my food processor, which sped it up a bit. I got distracted when it was time to pull the fish out, but it was still moist - the topping must have protected it. I had the small amount of leftover salad for lunch the next day, and while it was not as crisp, it still tasted wonderful.

This was a huge hit with the whole family, including our 6 year old. Easy and quick, pefect for a family dinner or for company. Used sablefish as it was in the freezer, had to adjust vinaigrette (a little too lemony). Salad was a perfect accompaniment to the fish (and we plan to try it on its own as well).

The salad is a delight and I am now imagining other applications for raw shaved asparagus. It could have perhaps used a third player of some kind. I left the butter out of the halibut in my vain attempt to be healthy and regret it. The breading is fine but the fish really needed something else going on in both the flavor and moisture department.
