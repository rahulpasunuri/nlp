Awesome and easy. (I experimented and added a half cup each of fresh strawberries and blueberries after removing the compote from the heat. These went tender but not mushy and gave a fruitier body to the compote.) I took it to a dinner party and was a great hit after a big meal- tasty but not heavy. It was perfect after a full-flavoured chicken meal and red wine.

Very easy to make and wonderful over nutmeg icecream! My rhubarb became mushy so not quite the texture I was expecting, but still, the flavor was fantastic. Looking forward to leftovers with yogurt, granola or oatmeal. This one's a keeper!

Excellent! The red wine gives it a very good depth of taste. I was actually surprised at how good it was!! Will definately make again!
