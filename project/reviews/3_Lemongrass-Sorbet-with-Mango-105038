I have made this at least a half dozen times, and always to rave reviews. I brought some to a potluck, served with honey dew and strawberries (I had no mango on hand), and it was the only dish on the table with no left overs at the end of the night. Even my fussy fast food enthusiast husband loves it, and my seven year old son asks if we can make it again and again.

The lemongrass flavor was too strong for us since we also left off the mangoes (could be more of an "acquired" taste as someone else mentioned). No problem with icy-ness after freezing, though the texture was great straight out of the machine.

Forget the mango, this is an simple and delicious sorbet. The lemongrass syrup with less sugar makes a good base for a soda or a lemongrass cocktail (use voka or sake) like they serve at Vong.

The flavor didn't work for me but it's probably just an acquired taste. The other review is right though--don't let it harden in the freezer or it'll be too icy.

A wonderful and refreshing sorbet. Next time I will skip hardening it in the freezer-- the consistency was perfect straight from the machine and it got a bit icy after time in the freezer.
