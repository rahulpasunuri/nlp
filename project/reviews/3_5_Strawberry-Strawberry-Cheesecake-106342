I made some changes. I substituted strawberry extract for the almond and added a tsp. of Grand Marnier and some orange rind. I made a glaze for the strawberries from 1 cup of sugar, 1 cup of water and 3 T of cornstarch. When it boiled and thickened I added 3 T of strawberry jello powder. I cooled it before glazing the berries. Yum!

I have been making this cheesecake for quite a few years now. It is always a hit. I have made it just because and for the holidays. Never fails. Delish. Won't stop making it ever. Don't change a thing.

I finally made this recipe and absolutely loved it. Nothing but compliments.

I made this for my 1st year anniversary and It turned out beautiful. Visually appealing as well as taste. Only suprising thing was Its texture, It has more of a actual cake texture than a no-bake cheesecake. But I was told that a baked cheesecake does have more of a cake texture so all was well. But im defiantly making this recipie again!

My group and I made this cheesecake for a culinary arts II project with the intent to read the reviews and alter what need be. My group and I swirled the strawberry preserve instead of mixing well and it gave the cheescake a beautiful color and desgin. We also We thinly sliced the strawberries for the topping instead of halving. The reason being, we thought bite size strawberries would be a better subsitute and more pratical. Also, the directions were somewhat unclear as to what to do with the strawberry jelly and slices. We melted the jelly in a saucepan and folded in the strawberries for thin, equal distribution. Also, one major change we made was using all fresh strawberries instead of the frozen strawberries for the puree. All in all, the recipe went smoothly, minus the clumpy batter from the cream cheese. We later found it much easier to cream the cream cheese and sugar. Just a helpful hint. :D The end result was light and fresh as the reviews indicated. However, the only dislike I had with this recipe is that the texture is not like that of a regular cheesecake. However, it was tasty and as always fun to make.

Excellent! I made this recipe exactly as written except that I swirled the strawberry puree into the filling rather than mixing it in well. Compliments all around at a birthday party. It was easy to make; it will be a regular at our house!

Used fresh, locally grown, strawberries - fantastic flavor and a lighter cake as others noted. Guests were quite happy to take a very large piece home. Next time will try sour cream topping and light glaze on top of the sour cream to help anchor the berries.

Overall good, tasted great. I liked the consistency, lightness. Could do away with the topping, especially the glaze.

I have made this cheesecake repeatedly because it is always so well received by my guests. It's very pretty and great to make when strawberries are in season. I do think it could use a sturdier crust; next time I will add some almonds.

despite some unenthusiastic reviews i went ahead and made this on a whim and was very pleased with the results! it did get comments of being lighter than some cheesecakes, but considering how dense they can sometimes be i didn't consider it a bad thing, and it certainly wasn't THAT light. used fresh strawberries in the filling and added a layer of sour cream topping under the glazed berries. came together in a flash too and you can't always get that with cheesecake. all in all a really fresh, lighter take on cheesecake, and very good :-)

Somehow just not rich enough. I didn't deviate from the recipe at all, but the cake came out too light. Someone who tried summed it up as "good if you're not expecting cheesecake".

This was a huge hit with my senior class and with my husband and friends. I made a graham cracker crust and substituted frozen raspberries for the strawberries. I followed some of the other reviews and substituted raspberry extract for the almond extract. I did not top it with fresh fruit, but it did not need it.

Rating: 3
I only changed the crust to graham crackers and followed the recipe for the rest and it came out perfect. It wasn't bland like others mentioned. In fact, it had the perfect amount of sweetness. I baked (w/o water bath) for about an hour and 20 and the cake never cracked.

This is a good cheese cake recipe. Instead of the shortbread cookie crust I used graham crackers, which worked fine. I would make this recipe again.

Rating: 3
I thought this recipe was pretty good. I have never made cheesecake before and this one was easy. It isn't very dense like others have said. That was the only issue that my boyfriend had. Other than that, I substituted the almond extract with strawberry extract which gave a great strawberry flavor. I also made a graham cracker crust instead. Definitely need a water bath with it and I bake it for 1 hour and 5 minutes which helped it set, but not get a crust or crack. I also ran a knife along the outside so that a crack wouldn't form. Finally, since fresh strawberries are so expensive, I took the remaining puree, sweetened it with a teaspoon of sugar, and poured it over the top. Everyone liked that. I would make this again.

Best cheesecake *ever*

My twelve year old daughter made this as written for a group of four adults and seven kids. Everyone loved it. Only one piece of crust returned to the kitchen for the garbage. She did a fabulous job with the strawberries on top and used my homemade strawberry jam; the dessert was a sight to behold as well as delicious.

I think I will find a different Stawberry Cheesecake recipe. This one was very eggy and spongy, plus it got a really thick brown skin on the top. I followed the recipe exactly execpt to bake it for a bit less time than suggested. It would have been black if I had. The flavor was OK one I peeled the skin off the top, but not the stunning cheescake I was hoping for. I have many, many other cheescake recipes. I will stick to those in future.

I served this at a dinner party last night and was told by several it was the best cheesecake they'd ever tasted. I also think the flavor was a tad light, but with fresh strawberries on the side it balances it out.

I read the bad reviews and I decided to give it a try myself....and follow the recipe EXACTLY. I think the name of this should be "SHY STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE." The flavor was sooo subtle it was barely there. Yes, the texture was creamy, but so is yogurt..it costs about 95 per cent less.

This recipe was so easy but tastes like you spend all day preparing. This was one of the best cheesecakes that I have ever tasted! It was so creamy and had just the right amount of strawberry flavor, not overpowering. This recipe is a keeper!

I always find it interesting that people who don't follow the recipe exatly the first time, can complain when it doesn't turn out to their satisfaction. I've made this cheesecake twice, and it's been excellent both times. It had a nice creamy texture, and a very subtle strawberry flavor, but the strawberries on top make up for that.

I really don't understand the negative reviews on this cake. I have made it many times. I personally like a classic vanilla best, but I give this four forks because of all the requests I get for it. In fact, I am making two this afternoon. If your experience is anything less than eating a perfect creamy strawberry cloud, then check your process and try again.

I thought the texture and taste of this cheesecake tasted liked baked Cream of Wheat with strawberries added. Very dry. I prefer a creamy texture. The crust was good and the red currant jelly made a nice glaze. My other four guests agreed with my analogy.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. The texture was heavy and the cake had little strawberry flavor. The best part was the fresh strawberries on top...

This cheesecake was fabulous! The strawberries sparkle and looks wonderful on the table. The only thing that I did different was that I cooked the cake for 1 hour and 25 minutes. I will definitely pass this recipe to family and friends.

I made this for Mother's Day and my mother and the entire extended family just loved it, even the children. It is very rich and the taste is wonderful. I used fresh strawberries that I picked myself. I will bake it a little longer the next time - maybe an extra 10 to 15 minutes. Also, I served it with a small dollop of white chocolate mousse on the side instead of whipped cream. It is a very pretty dessert and the glaze on the strawberries just sparkled under the lights in the dining room.

This one's OK if you want a tasty strawberry cheesecake. But with so many cheesecake recipes available, I doubt that I'll make it again.

most of the guests liked this cake, but i didn't. it received a lot of compliments and there were no leftovers. we even had a "fight" over the last piece. i made a couple of errors during preparation and one caused the cake to fall. i need to make it again correctly before i can give my personal opinion. i used a 10" springform instead of a 9 and i baked for an additional 30 minutes and the edges never cracked - i had a difficult time determining if it was done - there's a possibility that i may have overcooked.

I loved this flavour and look of this cheesecake. It was so easy to make. The only reason I did not give it a four, is because I prefer a denser cheesecake. Does anyone know of a way I can get this to be a little denser???? Suggestions welcome!!!

This cheesecake was beautiful! My boyfriends parents were very impressed. I'm used to my cheesecakes being a little more dense than this one, but the light and fluffy filling was a good match for the super-rich crust. The flavor of this was good, but the presentation was amazing. Make this if you're trying to impress someone.

This was a great cheesecake. Made it in a 10-inch springform pan so I made one and a half times the crust. It looked as good as it tasted.

I've had excellent luck with this recipe as well -- it's easy and impressive. I've made it with raspberries in place of strawberries, which is also great. The raspberries make it much pinker than the strawberries do. If you wanted to really fuss you could strain out the raspberry seeds, but I left them in and it was fine!

I made this cake twice. Got rave reviews both times. The only thing was that I found the crust very oily. It leaked in my oven when it was baking. Maybe next time I'll try it with less butter in the crust since Lorna Doones have so much.

Everyone loved this cheesecake! I have made it twice now, and the second time I added a little red food coloring to brighten the color. I thought the original recipe looked a little drab. The red food coloring created a pretty pink that was much more appealing.

Very good cheesecake! The almond extract gives it a delicate flavor. I had some trouble baking the crust, as I had the feeling it would not set, so I cooked it longer then recommended, and it turned out great! My family loved it and I will do it again.

Perhaps my expectations for this recipe were too high - it tasted very artificial and pre-fabricated, like cheesecake from a box or a poor-quality in-store bakery. It wasn't my first attempt at cheesecake, either. In fact, I was trying to broaden my reportoire. If you're looking for a dessert recipe and you're hosting a foodie, keep looking. It was a disappointment.

This was good, not great, cheesecake, and I'd only recommend it if you plan on serving a large group and consuming it all in one day. It was pretty the first day, but it became soggy and unappetizing after 24 hours in the refrigerator.

I made this for mother's day and it was a huge hit! This was my first time making a cheesecake, and I found this recipe to be really easy.

I actually made this recipe when it came out in Bon Appetit three months ago. I made the recipe exactly as it said, except for one change. I accidentely used strawberry JAM instead of jelly. When I boiled and reduce it, the sauce was a bit chunky, but still spreadable. I did not have any problem with my jelly turning to water, as other reviews did. The cheesecake itself was absolutely suburb - light, fluffy, and the strawberry taste in the cream cheese was not overpowering. This is definitely a recipe that I will be keeping in my stash of "excellent" recipes!

This was a great, rich cheesecake- after reading reviews of how everyones glaze ran into there crusts and destroyed the cheesecake I put my glaze on right before serving and it was fine. The strawberries arranged on top are a nice and fresh change from frozen strawberries in syrup..

Wow! Beautiful! I had stupendous strawberries and made this recipe exactly according to its directions (except I used an 11" springform pan). I used the 1/4-cup leftover strawberry puree as the glaze, cooking it down over medium-low heat first with a couple tablespoons of strawberry jam. I am so proud of myself. This cheesecake tastes absolutely unbelievable! Make it very often.

This was a huge hit at a dinner party I attended. I used the extra strawberry puree to drizzle over the serving plates. I will definately make this one again although next time I will probably omit the glaze.

Very strange. My glaze, too, turned to liquid in the refrigerator and ran all over, ruining the crust. What in the world would make it do that??? Ruined the presentation. Otherwise, cheesecake itself was delicious & easy to make. Wouldn't use food processor again, will use faithful ole' Kitchen Aid; my food processor must be a bit small, resulting in spillover.

Took this cheesecake to a friend's house...the strawberry jelly became liquid on the ride over in the car (this was in the winter with the heater on but it was in the back seat) and it ended up sitting in a puddle of the stuff in the bottom...messy! Flavor was good but the strawberries were a bit tart so that is an important component of how this turns out. I have better recipes.

Very light cheesecake texture and absolutely delicious! You will never make a graham cracker crust again after tasting this one. This is definitely a lovely cake for special occassions.
