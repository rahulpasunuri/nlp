Since the recipe was published in Gourmet 12 years ago, this has been my favorite Christmas cookie, and is expected at my annual cookie swap. I have never had trouble rolling out the dough, but I am patient and allow it to rest and come to room temp. I have always used vanilla extract, but may have to look for vanilla powder based on other reviews!

i get requests for these all the time. this has been a staple in my christmas cookie boxes for the past 9 years. the dough is SO NICE to work with. Don't use vanilla instead of vanilla powder and make sure your powder is fresh. they are time consuming but people rave about them. you can put them very close together on the sheets (they don't really spread at all) as long as you are careful with the egg wash and sugar. i skip straining the apricot preserves and simply heat it for a few seconds in the microwave and then work around the chunks when filling them.

I have been making these cookies for years and I finally figures out what was wrong with the recipe. You need to add one room temp egg white and 1 Tablespoon of vanilla to the butter mixture. The dough is soft and really easy to work with.

Although I was a little dubious about this recipe, it has gotten rave reviews from everyone who has tasted the cookies. The powdered vanilla bean gives the cookies a unique flavor.

Like most cookies, you need to experiment with these a few times until you get it right. Some advice: 1) The directions say to mix the flour into the batter until just combined. This won't work with a handmixer. For best results, combine with your hands just until dough forms. 2) To roll easily, fit the refrigerated disk of dough into a sheet of cling free wrap and fold up into a rectangular package so that you have an inch of wrap on all 4 sides totally enclosing disk. Let dough soften up a bit at room temperature and then gradually but rigorously roll out into all four sides, flipping over a few times, until the dough fills up the package. This will help fill in any cracks as the dough becomes more malable as you form into the wrap. Unwrap and you should now have a nice rectangle of dough and can roll it out further into the desired 1/4" thickness with very few cracks or leftover scraps. 3) Powdered egg whites are available at most larger health food stores.

I started making these last year. Here are some tips for the struggling. When rolling out the dough, first flour your surface so it will not stick. Then sprinkle a little four on dough. This will help from separating and have a smooth surface. Then, place wax paper on top of dough and roll out. Ta-da! No crumbling or breaks! Use a spatula to pick up your cutout. I Use mini christmas cutouts, colored sugar, and only bake for 10 min. The cookie melts in my mouth - it's a huge hit with friends and family!Don't pass this up!

I made these for my cookie exchange, and they were a big hit. I'm not a baker at all...and they turned out flaky and delicious. I used fancy jam, though, and that made them even more special (italian cherry preserves, and apricot marmalade). Am getting ready to make them again this year!

Everyone in my family thinks these cookies are great. One thing I did differently, (which from reading the other reviews was a good change)was instead of chilling and rolling the dough, I formed the dough into two 1 1/2" logs using a paper towel cardboard tube cut along one side to help form them, then I chilled the rolls, and cut them into 1/4" slices. The powdered egg whites can be found out here at a craft store called Michael's. It's by Wilton and called Merinque powder.

I would like to know where I can find egg white powder? And when subsitude with vanilla extract, one reviewer said 4:1. Does she mean 4 tsp extract to 1 tsp of powder? I look forward to test the recipe. Thanks.

The cookies were very good and appreciated by the people I gave them to, but when I was making the dough it was very dry and would not roll. I added some milk to bring it together and was able to work with it.

Fabulous little cookie. Wondered during the making if it would be worth it, but it was! Local shops didn't have vanilla powder & with no time to wait for mail order, substituted vanilla extract 4:1. I also didn't have problem rerolling scraps. Gave as gifts; everyone wants recipe..

It is a great recipe but I think refrigerating the dough is not necessary. I left mine out overnight and the cookies turned out great. The dough was a little tough and seemed to be missing something so instead of 2 sticks of butter I added 3. This seemed to help bind it more.

I had a very difficult time with this recipe. The dough comes out quite dry and does not hold together well. In fact, each time I tried to roll it out, it would crumble immediately. I cannot figure out what (if anything) I did wrong as I followed the recipe to the letter. Perhaps there is an ingredient missing?

Not only are these cookies delicious, but they are also beautiful. I used a number of bite-sized cookie cutters, making a heart-shaped or star-shaped "window" in the top part of the sandwich to reveal the filling. The final product was absolutely adorable. The dough was similar to pie crust, and I ended up adding the two tablespoons of water to help it congeal. (I wondered if this step was omitted from the instructions in error.) Re-rolling the dough did not affect the texture of the cookies. Overall, it was time-consuming, but well worth it!

I followed the directions exactly and felt that the recipe was perfect. Everyine who has tried the cookies has asked for the recipe! I did use real vanilla instead of vanilla powder.

I found the recipe a little tricky this time. After spending a long evening making cookies, this was my last. I put the dough in the refrig over night. I was rock hard the next day when I went to roll them out. After letting it sit out a while it was fine. I like the idea of cutting one of the circles to show the the filling. I will try that next time. I ignored the direction of not using the scraps. I rerolled several times and did not find the dough to be a problem. My husband loved them.

the recipe should have indicated that the dough must come together before chilling. this will take a few extra seconds with a hand mixer. otherwise, these cookies were excellent. they were flakey and delicious. i have tiny christmas cookie cutters that i used only on half of the circles so the jam showed through, making these look like tiny oranments. just adorable.

I had a lot of trouble rolling out the dough with this recipe, it was so dry and flaky. I had tons of leftover scraps, that I couldn't do anything with! Yes, the cookies themselves where very light and flaky, but it was a real hassle. The first batch I made, I forgot to put on the egg and sugar, and then next batches I added it. I thought they were better without the egg whites and sugar. Also, definitely strain the apricot preserves. Also, I only had strawberry preserves instead of raspberry, and I'm sure the raspberry would have been much better. Next time, I might just make the cookies and not make them into sandwiches, they were very good plain with no sugar at all. Also, where do you get Vanilla powder? I just used a tsp. of vanilla.
