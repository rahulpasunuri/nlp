I was drawn to this recipe for its simplicity, but I'm a little disappointed. It looked pretty on the table but it was pretty flavorless. Definitely add salt, even though the recipe doesn't call for it.

If the potatoes taste bland, or like they're "missing something", it's probably because you didn't season them enough. The recipe says to salt and pepper to taste -- you need to sample the end result before serving and adjust your seasoning accordingly.

I found these potatoes kind of bland. They seemed to need some other spices or something to enhance the taste.

from the looks of the picture, they're whole, unpeeled small potatoes. but you could peel them if you wanted, or use larger potatoes, cut up.

Please, excuse my ignorance. Are the potatoes whole, peeled, sliced or what. I would love to try this recipe.

We have these potatoes in almost any restaurant here in Mexico City. Have them prepared at home enlightens any steak dinner.

My potatoes took longer to cook. Fresh parsley is better than dried any day.
