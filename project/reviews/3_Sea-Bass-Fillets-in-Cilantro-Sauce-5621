I doubled the ginger and used a whole jalapeno in the sauce. It was much better with a little kick! I will use the leftover sauce with grilled chicken.

Didn't float our boat. To Austin and Ottawa, you might like this better: dust halibut or swordfish with dry Italian-style breadcrumbs; melt 2T butter in skillet over medium-high heat and cook fish until browned on both sides and fully cooked yet still moist; remove fish to a platter; add 4T green onions to the skillet and stir just until wilted (about 30 seconds); add 4T minced cilantro, 4T lime juice and 6T whipping cream; stir until sauce boils for 1 to 2 minutes and thickens. Spoon sauce over fish. Easy and divine!

I made this sauce with chicken instead of fish and it was great.

Although a very quick and easy dish to prepare, we found the overall dish to be somewhat bland considering the cilantro and jalapeno in the sauce. It didn't taste bad, but it was not memorable.

Did not like this dish. Found the sea bass to be very strong tasting (it was our first try). The sauce was somewhat bland, even though there was lots of cilantro, ginger and jalapeno...

This is one of my favorite fish recipes. I've made it half a dozen times in the last 3 months. I love making it with Chilean Bass. I add a little salt and pepper and sometimes some chopped ginger and garlic to the food processor with the cilantro sauce. We love it!

Great for your dinner party! Perfectly timed when you put it in the oven just as you are sitting down to appetisers. (I served crab cakes). Prepared in advance, I used red jalapenos as they are more robust than green. I also used a whole fillet, which not only presents well, but is easier. Served with jalapeno corn bread and endive, arugula and orange salad. A pinot noir or red zinfandel pairs nicely. Creme brulee for dessert. Port taken in the living room to conclude.

Prepared fish in advance and let chill in fridge - sauce lost the "zip" I had expected. Still and excellent dish.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe. It was easy and delicious. Will definitely make it again.
