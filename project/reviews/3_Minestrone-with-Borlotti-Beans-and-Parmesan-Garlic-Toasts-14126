Based on other reviews here, I added dried basil and oregano as well as garlic. Used jarred borlotti beans from my local Italian deli plus added 2 cups of cooked small pasta shells. The finishing touch was a dollop of pesto I had leftover from earlier in the week plus a grating of fresh Parmesan. Really good!!!

Maybe 2 forks would be more appropriate as the recipe as is I'm sure would be very bland. However with the great suggestions from the other reviewers it definitely deserves 3. Added several minced cloves of garlic with the onion,a parm rind, two links of Italian sausage that I first cooked in the pot of Roman beans and sliced, and some dried basil and thyme (fresh would be great but it's winter in Ohio). Served with the toasts its a great winter treat.

This is one of those dishes in which the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. It is amazing how good all those vegetables can be when combined, particularly since this recipe lacks garlic or herbs! I think carmelizing the onions is key--it gives great depth. The parmesean toasts are delicious, and are a great treat to anyone making this with an eye toward calories.

Generous amounts of fresh herbs (oregano, thyme, parsley, basil and rosemary) and the suggested parm rind made this really sing! Excellent solution for loads of vegetables; added green beans, yellow squash, celery, garlic, chard, even diced brocc. stalks. Smells heavenly!

Very Good. I added garlic, one red potatoe, one can of chicken broth in addition to beef broth, a couple of fresh tomatoes, and small pasta shells (cooked separately so not to soak up all the broth). In addition, I used oregano, fresh parsley, and topped with fresh parmesean and fresh basil. I also decreased the amount of cooking time with the vegtables so they wouldn't get too mushy.

(Borscht?? What is abbotsford talking about?) I couldn't find cranberry beans, so substituted with some canned "trout beans" that I found in the ultra-organic section of the grocery store. Also added about 1/2 tsp thyme and 2 tsps basil which I highly recommend. I took about 5 minutes off each stage of the cooking, which seemed to keep the veggies from getting too soft. I agree with the rater who said that this seemed more like vegetable soup than minestrone (and I did use beef broth) but still quite tasty nonetheless.

Insipid Borscht. I was greatly disappointed.

This is one of my favorites. Easy to make, and healthy. The cranberry beans were a bit hard to find, but were worth it. I have made it several times, and everyone loved it.

I loved this soup. I was easy to make and everyone raved about it.

This soup is very good, but it tastes like more of a vegetable soup than it does specifically like Minestrone - Maybe it has to do with my substitution of vegetable broth for the beef broth to keep it vegetarian. I also added 3 cloves of garlic to the onions and a couple pinches of an herb blend including basil, oregano and parsley, and I added a 28 oz. can of tomatoes in addition to the 14 oz. can. The toasts were great dunked in the soup!

This was excellent and very easy and quick. I used white canelloni beans instead because they were easily available and added italian sausage. The toasts work perfectly with this soup also. I floated a toast slice in each bowl on top of the soup then topped each piece with fresh mozzarella.
