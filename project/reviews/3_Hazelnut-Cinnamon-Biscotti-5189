Just finished making this and was very impressed - couple of minor changes - I didn't have hazelnuts available so I went with a Cashew & Macadamia mix that I had on hand, also didn't have oranges (for the zest) so went with lime zest instead. I've had a lot of biscotti (home made, restaurant made & commercial made) in my time & feel that this is the best recipe I've come across yet.

how shall I say this...it's awful! My sister and I had a huge fight over how sandy the batter looked. I stuck by the recipe, despite her objections, and came out with bready and crumbly biscotti. Was it edible? Yes. Was my sister right? No. Was I right? Sort of. If you're looking to bake some biscotti, try another recipe.

this was a fantastic recipe of a good quality biscotti, the only recomendation i can give are to decrease the baking powder to 3/4 Tbs., the flour to 2 3/4 cups. I increased the the cinamon to 1 1/2 Tbs, but i will go to 2 Tbs next time, make sure not to chop up the hazelnuts to much, recomend choping by hand. The process of making it in the stand mixer is the way to go. if you have an electric oven the first cooking time needs to go about 5 minutes longer and 2 minutes longer when cooking after they have been cut, don't reduce the heat.

Altogether disappointing - the flavor, the texture - nothing outstanding here. I upped the cinammon as per another reviewer's suggestion, but still found these lacking in flavor. They also crumbled a lot as I cut them, which isn't a problem I've had with other recipes.

This is a very good recipe. The sweetness, texture, etc. are all great. Have used basic recipe and substituted other ingredients to make, for example, orange-cranberry biscotti. Definitely a keeper recipe.

I tried another hazelnut biscotti recipe with anise and the flavor was wonderful but the texture was very dense and hard. I found that this recipe made a much lighter biscotti, but it did crumble during slicing and had a noticeable baking powder taste -- reminded me a bit of a scone flavor. I would try this recipe again, maybe with less flour, in hopes that it won't be so crumbly and definitely a drizzle of chocolate would be nice or maybe a sprinkling of turbinato sugar before baking.

A real nice one, and it helped to read the reviews before baking. now i made some changes from the first time and it is unresistable in taste and smell here are my additions: a total of 1.5 table spoons cinamon+1 teasp. nutmeg + 2 pinchs of ground cloves +2 teasp. vanella + didnt put orange zest but 2 teaspoons orange extract, full hazelnuts, and when cutting it i used an electric knife which i didnt have any one broken piece.

I also made this by first creaming sugar and butter with beater, then adding dry ingredients instead of using food processor. Skipped the orange peels, and for the 2nd bake, lower the oven temperature to 325 degree as other reviewers suggested. Perfect. They are gone in one day.

As is, I think the recipe lacks any definite flavor. I would add another 1/4 tsp cinnamon and another 1/2 tsp vanilla. The hazelnut flavor was only light (but I think I chopped them too fine). I would cut back the amount of flour to maybe 2 1/2 c to avoid the crumbling and splitting after the first bake. The consistency of the final product was not as crisp as I had hoped for the 3/4-inch slices.

This recipe is great, simple and fast ! a definite keeper .. I used almonds instead of hazelnuts and added a little of Orange-flower-water, it smelled terribly nice and tasted great. I made it for a midnight snack with hot chocolate, my freinds just loved it..

Made this recipe by first creaming sugar and butter with beater, then adding dry ingredients (instead of using food processor). Topped with lightly drizzled semi-sweet chocolate. Excellent!

Surprisingly easy and VERY flavorful. They are so good, you don't even need to dip them in chocolate. One of my favorite cookies. I made them for a party and they were devoured!!

This is a great, versatile biscotti formula... I used zest of a whole orange and pistachios instead of hazelnuts, and the results were fantastic. I plan to use this as a base for further crunchy experimentation!

Added a little hazelnut syrup to the batter, left the hazelnuts nearly whole and increased the sugar 1/4 cup. Everyone LOVED it. Would also be yummy dipped in chocolate! (Took the advice from the other reviews regarding the cooking time and it worked out perfect.)

I reduced oven temp during second baking to 325 degrees and baked cookies for 20 minutes, turning over after 10. They came out perfect! Just crunchy enough without being hard. A definite keeper.

I tried 4 biscotti recipes for Christmas - this was my favorite. The dough was agreeable to work with and it cooked perfectly. I took the other reviews to heart and reduced the time and temp of the second baking. Also drizzled melted semi-sweet chocolate across 1/2 of the cookies for a little pizzaz. These made fun and attractive Christmas gifts!

I made this without reading the reviews first. omitted the orange (allergies) and added extra cinnamon. I also brushed the top with egg white and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar as well as finer hazelnuts. In future the second baking needes a lower temp. I would not pre-chop the nuts either. Not sure, but I have also had better sucess not slicing with a serrated knife.

I found this recipe gave me a dough that split during backing. I also think the 350 degrees for 15 minutes of secondary baking was too long. It gave me biscotti that were too dark.

I LIKE A FULL FLAVOR BISCOTTI. THIS NEEDS JUST A LITTLE MORE PUNCH OF FLAVOR. BUT IT IS STILL A GREAT COOKIE.

My family and friends liked this biscotti and was very easy to make.

This cookie has several wonderful flavors that are subtle and come together perfectly. People would not stop raving about these cookies.
