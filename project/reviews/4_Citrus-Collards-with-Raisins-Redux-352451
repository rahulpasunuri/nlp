I loved this citrus-twist to cooking collards. I used dried cranberries instead of raisins and the colors are just beautiful!

Our farmer's market has an abundance of wonderful greens that I thought I would try. I have never even eaten collard greens let alone cooked them. They were phenomenal and everyone loved them! I might try less raisins next time because 2/3 cup was overkill. Frantically searching for new collard green recipes! Ready to try mustard greens next.

Used thompson raisins, golden would be fine, too. You can cook the greens ahead of time and finish just before dinner. Balance of sweet and garlicky was just right. Served with swordfish in a mint, cucumber, shallot sauce (Cooks Illustrated.) Highly delicious.

Delicious - not too sweet but enough for an interesting flavor. Made exactly as recipe describes - low on raisins, so only used about 1/2 c.

This is a fantastic recipe if you don't like your collards cooked to hell and back. Simple and delicious.

I loved the combination of flavors with the sweet raisins, reduced OJ, and as I had already started before looking this up, I browned 2 strips of bacon, snipped prior to sauteing w/ 1/2 of a med. onion. Outstanding, and I'm not a collards fan, but resolved this year to give them a try again, b/c of their high nutrition.

This is one of my favorite recipes. I keep making it again and again, plus sharing it with all my friends. Healthy, easy, and delicious! So much better than many other recipes that have overcooked, over salted greens.

I prepared this exactly as written, and it was a huge hit with my family. Next time I will double it.

With just a slight change or two, this is a wonderful twist on a southern classic. Lighter, healthier and tastier. I used sweet vadallia onions and golden raisins, as well as blood orange juice.
