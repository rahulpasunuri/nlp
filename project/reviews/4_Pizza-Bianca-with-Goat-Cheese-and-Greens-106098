Delicious! I made mine with spinach that I had on hand, and was pleasantly surprised by the tang of the goat cheese and spiciness of the garlic chili oil. A very good taste combination, making this recipe a new addition to my pizza toppings rotation. Yum!

We have been making this recipe for a few years. This summer, I accidentally added only one tsp of yeast, and it did not rise very well, but it didn't totally detract from the taste. We have also grilled this crust and used other ingredients as the toppings. When we make the recipe as it is, we sometimes add prosciutto, and that turns out very well, too. The biggest stars here, in my opinion are the crust and the seasoned oil. If you start with those, you can put a lot of different things on it, and it will taste great every time. I also sometimes make two batches and freeze one, because of the time consuming nature of the crust rising. It seems to be as good, even after thawing. Also, our 16-month-old daughter loves it.

This was great, and so flavorful. I took the advice of previous reviewers and cut way down on mozzarella so the goat cheese could be the star. I love the seasoned oil and the garlic in the Swiss chard. I used a different crust recipe because I was short on time, but it was still delicious. I will definitely make this again.

I make my own goat cheese which made me really want to eat this pizza. However, the pizza ended up being much too sour. My ex-husband thought it might be my goat's milk, but I know this to not be true. I had milked the goat just after spring, which is the best time. He is a cage-free, range goat that is fed a high protein diet. He was happy when I milked him and I made the cheese properly. I think the recipe calls for too much yeast.

This pizza was loved by my whole family and I made a gluten-free version. I only sauteed the chard and it came out lovely. I also brushed the crust with olive oil before I put on the cheese. The crust recipe came from 'The Gloriously gluten-free cookbook' by Vaness a Maltin. My family couldn't believe it was gluten-free

I haven`t tried the recipe for the crust yet; have just used the one I always use. We use spinach instead of chard and add roasted cherry tomatoes. The seasoned oil didn`t add anything to this recipe for us. As described above, we love this pizza and have made it several times.

Absolutely scrumptious. I couldn't stop eating it! I don't think the green you choose matters, because I picked up whatever was on sale. I also used ww flour - I didn't get a lot of rising, but I'm attributing it to the ww flour. It turned out great nonetheless!

Great concept. Used kale in place of chard and threw in some mushrooms. It was delicious and we'll definitely make it again! Definitely make the seasoned oil to brush on the crust, with a generous portion of red pepper, it adds the necessary kick to make this stand out.

Delicious pizza but the true star here is the crust. If you have the time/patience to wait for it to rise, definitely follow the recipe for the dough. Either way, don't skip the seasoned oil. So good!

There was nothing wrong with this, and it is a good way to use up that chard in the garden, but it was a bit bland and I probably won't be making it again unless I'm inundated with chard.

This review is just for the topping, which was very, very good (I used a Trader Joe's whole wheat pizza dough). A couple of things though- I think the mozzarella is unnecessary, or could definitely be dramatically reduced. If this is a special dinner for guests, go for it, but we make pizza at least every other week as a vegetarian option, so I try to keep it a little healthier. The chard was awesome, and I think spinach would also work well, The only thing I might do in the future is brush the seasoned oil (which is great!) over the crust before I add the chard. I make a similar pizza where I brush oil on the crust and it works out well. The goat cheese is a great touch!

Fantastic way to use up the chard from the garden! Only change was I used a bread machine pizza dough recipe - cuts the dough time down to 1-1/2 hours, making it doable as a weeknight dinner.

Great, easy dinner to serve with a side salad. I make this often in the Winter when there is too much chard to go around. Works with any pizza dough recipe.

I have been making this pizza since I found it years ago in Bon Appetit. I use spinach instead of chard; I've served it for dinner and it is fabulous as an appetizer. (BTW, that January 2002 issue was the best EVER, I make so many of the recipes from that one issue that I had to get another copy, mine was falling apart!)

I'm sure i commented on this.. but not gonna go through 46 reviews. This is the best pizza and its always amazing. Made it many many times. It needs nothing.. don't change the recipe..but as is the case with all pizza - heck you wanna fiddle with it right? I just add fried eggplant - i sliced then cut in half to make it pizza ready - a little salt, then deep fried. (I know shocking). But i think fried eggplant is the foie gras for vegetarians like me. Plan to quadruple this.. and make for visitors (bunch of kids and their mom and dad) tomorrow.. so I will have tons of leftovers! this freezes very well. just thaw and reheat in oven (not microwave!). And yes we can hold back on some of the mozzarella. It can be too much (in the sense you fill up too fast.. what's the fun then? eh?)

very tasty, made it with swiss chard once and with dandelion greens ..both excellent. my kids will probably never ask for a pepperoni pizza again

This was absolutely delicious. I followed all the directions, but also added halved grape tomatoes on top of the chard. Next time I make it, I may use wheat flour and cut down on the mozzarella cheese to make it a little healthier.

Like many of the others, I bought pizza dough at New Seasons, but followed the rest of the recipe closely--I added a bit of spinach to supplement the chard, but that's it. It was great! My boyfriend was skeptical about "chard pizza", but he ate 3 pieces.

Incredible. I added carmelized onions as a base. Used spinach instead of swiss chard. Added thin slices of chicken and tri colore baby bells. beautiful presentation and so delicious!

This is so yummy, one of my favorite recipes. My secret to make it even better is to substitute Garlic and Fine Herbs Boursin Cheese, you can find at Trader Joe's and other grocery stores, for the goat cheese. It comes in a white box with green writing, you will know it when you see it. It really adds another level of flavor. Also, we use kale instead of the chard.

Fabulous! I picked some swiss chard from the garden and cheated with whole wheat pizza dough from Trader Joe's. I will definitely be making this again.

Oh my, this was delicious! This was the first pizza I made and I salivate just thinking of the crust... We made ours with spinach and feta and used 1/2 of the amount of mozzarella as recommended. I can't wait to make it again!

I make a similar recipe however I buy my pizza dough premade at Trader Joe's. I saute my greens, usually arrugula, in olive oil and add some balsamic vinegar and chopped fresh tomatoes.

I have made pizza for years, but this is a first time for a white pizza. I must confess, I used my own recipe for the crust, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. It is a great "Lenten" choice, and a great use of healthy Swiss chard, kale or spinach. For me it lacked moisture and complexity. Next time I will add a layer of carmelized onions to the bottom crust to give it favor depth. The recipe is a great "jumping off point" to be creative.

My husband says this is the best gourmet pizza he has had, bar none! I made a few changes: I make a gluten-free pizza crust (Bette Hagman's recipe). I eliminated the oil in the topping, and brushed the seasoned oil around the rim of the crust; then I used the rest of it to saute the garlic and a small sliced onion. Wilt the chard in the microwave for 2 minutes, rinse, squeeze, chop and add to the sauteed vegetables for 1 minute.

To be fair, I used a different recipe for the crust; however, I did follow the recipe for the seasoned oil and topping. Delicious!!

Delicious pizza and a smidgen healthier than standard pizza. I cut the mozzarella in half (I know, seems like a crime) but I was trying to cut calories some people have trouble digesting cheese. It turned out to be a good thing because the flavors from the kale and goat cheese where that much more intense. It was wonderful.

I made my own whole wheat dough, but I loved the toppings. It's a great way to use swiss chard and the spicy, garlicky oil adds the perfect amount of flavor.

Incredible! The crust is excellent and the whole thing is loaded with flavor. Instead of the chard I used a mixed bag of baby spinach and spring greens and it was delicious and had even more color. I also used a goat cheese that had a hint of thyme.

Absolutely delicious. If you are looking to make converts out of delivery/frozen pizza worshippers, look no further than this recipe. Five and a half hours is admittedly a long time to wait for pizza crust, but it is definitely worth it. If you do decide to go with store- bought though, don't forget to brush it with the oil-soaked pepper flakes. That is what MAKES this dish. Other than that, you can easily substitute kale for chard, and I like to use goat's milk feta since it crumbles well. Bon appetit!

I really liked this recipe, though I added and changed several things. I used store-bought dough to save time and took several of the suggestions of other reviewers: tripled the garlic and sauteed the swiss chard (I added a little spinach as well). In addition, I slivered pepperoni and turkey lunchmeat and tossed that on after the mozzerella and added parmesan and and dried italian seasoning to the cheese on top. Also, I used gorgonzola instead of goat cheese. I usually either burn the crust or have a soggy middle of the pizza, but this time the crust and toppings cooked perfectly and evenly and I attribute that to sauteing the veggies first.

Delicious! I too always cook chard by chopping it into pieces, saute in olive oil and garlic, cover to steam a couple minutes. I added a few sundried tomatoes sliced into julienne slices. YUM.

I made this for a weeknight dinner as directed except for tripling the garlic (my husband loves it!) and baking it on a preheated pizza stone. This is definitely a keeper.

A simplification for the topping: Don't boil the chard. Instead, wash it and spin it dry in a salad spinner. Chop it into small pieces. Saute the garlic in the oil until fragrant, not more than 30 seconds; then add the chard directly to the pan. Toss so that the garlic is mixed in. Cover and let the whole thing steam for about 2 minutes, tossing occasionally. Season with salt and pepper and remove from the pan with a slotted spoon or slotted spatula. You can put the greens on paper towels to get rid of extra moisture if you like. This is how I always cook greens. They don't require two pans and two separate steps. I followed the recipe for the crust. I only had 2.5 hours so I couldn't let things rise for as long as the recipe required. Turned out fine. Overall, very tasty.

this review is for the crust only. when i made this crust recipe, i quintupled it. it was very very sticky at first, and it required a lot more flour than was called for in order to make it workable. however, it is a very good recipe that results in a tasty crust with a good crispy/chewy texture.

Rating: 4
Have made this twice (though not the crust, I'm sorry to say). We LOVE this. After having chard in our veggie delivery from the CSA twice in a row, I was happy to find something to do with it all. Tried once as written and a second time with gorgonzola and sundried tomatoes as well. outstanding!

We really liked the flavors in this one. Would never have thought to use swiss chard, and it gives a better zing than spinach. I wasn't that impressed withthe crust, it was tasty but heavy. Still, a great recipe.

delicious! really good flavors, great way to use chard. in order to make it at the last minute on a weeknight, i used trader joe's wheat pizza dough. for the seasoned oil i heated it on low for about 10 -15 minutes til the garlic was golden. just crushed the garlic with side of knife instead of mincing so it didn't burn, then chopped it up when the oil was done and put it on the pizza. also didn't boil chard first, chopped roughly and sauteed in shallot til it wilted -- about 1-2 minutes. i didn't think so much cheese was needed -- maybe 6 oz of mozz and 2 of goat was enough. this sounds like a lot of modifications, but they didn't change it substantively, just made it quicker. will definitely make again.

Great recipe, love the goat cheese-greens combo. Ann, to answer your question, I would try shallots instead of garlic. They have a similar taste - on the sweeter side but still with a kick. Another alternative would be vidalia or other sweet onions. Slice the shallots/onions thinly and crush them a little with the back of a fork to get them to release their juices. Then follow the recipe as written. Another alternative might be partially reconstituted dried onions, as they might have additional "pop." Hope that helps! -Cait.

want to try this soooo badly, but need opinions here. I'm allergic to garlic, yes you read that right & I am not the only person in the world, it's more common than you think. So, any suggestions for substitutions as everyone raves about the seasoned oil. Onions are ok, garlic is a definite No. Thanks in advance for your suggestions. Ann

Made this pizza last night, but used different dough recipe since I had made that already. And I used spinach instead of chard. It was soooo delicious! My husband was totally impressed, calling it "outrageously good," and he was still talking about how good it was this morning. Next time I'll use this recipe for the dough.

I love this pizza recipe. I have made it many times, sometimes as written, sometimes not. It is especially terrific with rainbow chard from the garden. Most often though, I use my own cornmeal pizza dough, and sub spinach for the chard. I cook it right on theclay tiles in my gas oven and it is fabulous!

An excellent pizza. Even people who don't like green vegetables liked it. I didn't make the crust exactly as written, but used a recipe that had 2.5 teaspoons of yeast (all other ingredients exactly the same) and threw it all in a bread machine on the dough setting.

I have made this pizza a number of times. It is always a big hit with everyone, because it is different, and so delicious. The goat cheese adds such a great flavor, and the seasoned oil is just the right amount of kick! I have used pizza dough from the supermarket (YES, when in a hurry, we have to make do!) Love this recipe and often use it as a unique appetizer course. The chard is also different, and a healthy choice! Enjoy!

We love this pizza! I have made is several times, have made the crust and it's very good. I actually prefer a purchased cornmeal crust. I've made it with the swiss chard and loved it and have substituted spinach and it was just as good.

This is great pizza. The chard comes out a little crispy and tastes better than I expected it would, even though I like chard. The pizza dough is now my standard. It has just the right amount of chew versus crispyness. I wasn't going to be home all day so I let the dough rise once, put it in the fridge for 6 hours, pulled it out about two hours before I was going to serve dinner and it came out just fine.

I have made the entire recipe twice, each time to a very happy eating audience. I have made just the pizza dough and seasoning oil so often I can't count, and just adore it's flexibility. I freeze the dough (in 2 parts) after the final rise and pull it out to use later. And actually find the dough easier to work at this point.

My rating is for the crust. It was absolutely delish. I will definitely forego my usual pizza dough recipe when I have the time to make this. I can't rate the exact recipe, however, as I used spinach and feta instead of greens/goat cheese. The seasoned oil is wonderful, though nothing out of the ordinary. I also made 2 recipes (in separate bowls) and made a pepperoni pizza for my hubby. He thought the dough was spectacular. Really soft, chewy...yum!
