I made these cookies for the pear sorbet recipe they were connected with. I thought they were delicious. I did find it necessary to make the cookies much larger than suggested so they would mold over the cups. They were also a little tricky to shape and cooled very quickly so it's important to work fast. You can't really taste the Chinese 5-spice powder so I may up it when I make them again if I'm using them to serve the pear sorbet.

I replaced the flour with soy flour to make it gluten-free. The cookies turned out great. They were a little difficult to get off the parchment paper because they are a little sticky but i just held on tight to the parchment and pushed my metal spatula under it with force. To make the cups, I actually put the cookie inside my ramekins to form the cookie cups as my cookies were not wide enough to go around the ramekins on the outside. Tasted great! My recipe made exactly 12 - no leftovers. I used these for the cranberry-vanilla sorbet (Nov 2009) and it was excellent.
