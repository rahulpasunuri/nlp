Easy peasy. Served with blueberries and whipped cream. Didn't bother to bang loaf pan and it still came out fine. Used dried lemon and orange peel, though not quite as much as called for for the zest. Used a tablespoon of orange and lemon juice.

I like this basic recipe. I increased citrus juices to 1/4 cup, and also increased zest of lemon and orange. Cake was moist! Also cooked in about 50 minutes.

We really enjoyed this pound cake but and I managed to keep it moist by closely watching for doneness. Mine was done at 52 minutes, so I suggest watching that. I made a recipe of Crushed Blueberry Sauce which can be found on this site only substituted mixed frozen berries from Costco becuase I had them on hand. It was a great dessert after my husbands day of bbq on the smoker.

A great simple pound cake. It's not the sort of cake that makes you go, "Wow!" but I don't think that's the point of pound cake. It's plain and delicious and great with coffee and tea. I couldn't find cake flour and used unbleached normal flour. I do prefer a pound cake that's a bit less cakey and more dense, but still, really good, and pretty easy.

This cake turned out delicious. I don't have a electric blender, so I did everything with a whisk. I also used lime instead of lemon because I had them on hand. I added the juice of a whole orange and the line after reading reviews of dryness. The cake turned out moist and a nice essence of citrus.

I agree with others that the recipe needed more citrus flavor than what was called for. I used tablespoons for the juice measurements as opposed to the teaspoons the recipe says. I also added more zest and a glaze with lemon juice in it for a final touch. The cake turned out moist and great!

This was really dry. It would go well with tea, but I like my pound cake to be more moist. Also, the citrus is barely a hint. I wouldn't make this again.

I made this pound cake for a bbq and served it with whipped cream and strawberries and was the belle of the ball! It got rave reviews. I used a medium sized orange and just juiced the whole half of it I had cut. Likewise, I used the juice of the whole lemon. Fantastic crumb and texture. Will be making it again tonight for an Easter dinner. Awesome recipe!

I made this for the Blueberry Trifle recipe and I was very satisfied with the results. I good, basic pound cake.

I used a Tablespoon of citrus juice where the recipe said use a teaspoon, and it was like the pound cakes of my best childhood memories. Old ladies from church brought these along-- often with a platter of fried chicken-- when visiting a bereaved family. One slice and grief was temporarily suspended. This is comfort dessert, simply rendered.

Great delicate citrus flavor with doubled amount of zests. Despite my following the recommendations of earlier reviewers it was dry. I'll make it again,but will try my mom's old trick of adding a couple of tablespoons of vegetable oil to make it moister.

I was looking forward to recipe. It sounded like such a nice dessert for a spring day. I was truly disappointed by how dry it was. I checked it at an hour and it was still gooey inside. So, I left it in for 10 more minutes and when I checked it, it appeared done (the knife came out clean). When we ate it the next day I found it to be quite dry. I ended up making a lemon glaze to add a little moister - that made eatable. It was also unusually airy and light for a pound cake - I prefer a much more traditional dense pound cake. I was embarrassed to serve this to my quests, but was left with no other options. I am throwing this recipe away and will be looking for a better pound cake recipe.

This was a lovely recipe. I added about two tablespoons of mixed orange and lemon zests, and the citrus flavor came out nicely. Through a miscommunication between my mother and I, we ended up baking it in a bundt cake pan, but it was beautiful, and baked for about 45 minutes at 345 degrees. When it came out my boyfriend wouldn't stop eating it, so we considered it a success!

I made this cake for a social, and they all loved it! I found that there was not enough citrus flavour. It was a little too dull. I would add more zest and juice. Don't waste your money unless you need to, but one orange and one lemon is enough.You will even have leftovers! All the people at the social loved and asked me to send them the recipe! Other than the juice and the zest, it was great. Dense, great for dipping into milk, tea, or coffee. This will definatley wow you and your family!

After reading the reviews, I followed the recipe EXACTLY as written-- eggs at room temp, butter and sugar mixed at high speed for five minutes, flour mixed in until just incorporated, and so on. I also found that it bordered on being dry. The flavor is great with just the right amount of citrus flavor, but it does seem like it's missing something that would make it a little more moist. I baked it for one hour, but I'm thinking that might have been too long. I might try again and watch the cooking time closely, as the dryness was the only negative. It's great with a cup of tea.

Despite reviews otherwise, the cake that came out of my oven was moist and airy. Next time I will try to make it more citrusy though. It was well received.

When I 1st saw this recipe, there was only the review using the blood orange. I used the regular ingredients and it was OK. I knew it had possibilities, and since it was so easy, I made it again using a blood orange, and made sure I used the ingredients at the right temps & consistencies. What a difference in flavor and texture! It even looks better. I think I'll try it again with a little lemon glaze and get back with y'all.

My husband and I really enjoyed this pound cake; it has great flavor and isn't dry. I used the zest from 1 orange and the zest from 1 lemon - I guess that came close to the right measurement. And I left off the powdered sugar which is unnecessary in my opinion.

This recipe was good...it was easy, but I thought the cake was a little dry. I would either use more butter or something...not sure. It tasted good though. I served it with strawberry sauce.

Just OK. I'm used to pound cakes being dense and moist. This is too dry and fluffy for my tast

Love this recipe. The cake is pretty light, not too dry and with great flavor. Not overly sweet. Baked in a convection oven at 315º for an hour.

Wonderful recipe, citrus notes are especially appreciated. An above reviewer said the cake was too dry-I found the same thing the first time I made it, but on the second try I realized that beating the flour in for too long will cause this-beat it until just BARELY incorporated, and you'll get great results every time. BRAVO.

franb213 from New York, New York enjoyed this cake enough to write 3 review, and I have no idea why! The cake was done in much less time than than the recipe called for; and it wasn't what I remembered from childhood as being a pound cake, except that it weighed about a pound!

This is a super buttery and dense pound cake. With so many other lemon cake recipes out there, I'm not sure I'll make this one again.

I gave this a four star because i am a serious pound cake fan. This recipe proved to be one of the best(except mine). i experimented and added some crushed Pecans in one batch and Walnuts in another turned out great. Fun food especially with a cold glass of milk or a hot cup of Coffee. Thanks.

I had high hopes for this cake, and it was fine, but not amazing. I baked it for less time than the recipe called for and it was still slightly dry and heavy.

Very moist with a distinct citrus flavor. I used blood oranges and it was delicious.
