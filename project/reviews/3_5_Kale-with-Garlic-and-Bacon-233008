Excellent and versatile recipe. Like others, I add a bit of wine vinegar at the end. Sometimes include onions, and sometimes use prosciutto instead of bacon. All delicious!

I'm not a kale expert--I've only had it a handful of times. But my CSA delivered some, and this seemed like a good way to use it. Even my husband, who is largely suspicious of green things, devoured it. It was so tender and flavorful!

I made 1/3 recipe, as I made it for myself as the sole dish for dinner. I don't think I got the kale cooked properly - it was bright green, but the taste was off. The 6-10 minutes didn't allow for all the water to boil off (I used aboug 3/4 of a cup for my 1/3 recipe), so maybe I didn't cook it long enough. Loved the bacon. Toasted some pine nuts and added those, as well as a fried egg on top for some protein. It turned out OK, but I think I'll try another recipe for sauteed Kale before making this again.

Careful not to add too much salt. Bacon is already salting quite a bit!

Fantastic! Served this with Crown Roast of Pork and quinoa patties - soooooo good!

Great recipe! I used turkey bacon to reduce the fat,wiped the pan clean of fat but not the dark, crispy bits after cooking the bacon, and used light olive oil to finish the recipe. I added sauteed white onion as another reviewer suggested. Splashed some with red wine vinegar and agree that this was a good addition. My husband, who declared himself "afraid of all that kale," loved it and ate several helpings. I cooked it more than the picture suggests, but it still had plenty of body.

somehow I ended up with kale and this was my first attempt to cook it. Turned out very good, but AI also played around with the recipe a lot based on the advice of other reviewers. I made a lot less than called for so here goes: 1 pound kale 3 bacon slices 2 garlic cloves 1/2 cup water 1/2 cup sliced leeks 1/8 cup feta cheese crumbles I sauted the leeks with the garlic and tossed the feta cheese in at the end with the bacon. I thought it was heaven. My kids were on the fence, but my husband and I were happy to eat the rest.

GREAT! I sauteed a white onion at the beginning, saved it, proceeded with the recipe, and added it in at the end. A few splashes of red wine vinegar really gave it a bit of tang that lightened up the bacon/garlic/onion flavors. Next time I'm going to try adding a few segments of clementine or mandarin orange.

OMG this was so good! Used suggestions and used chicken stock instead of water. Honestly I have no idea what kind of greens I had just joined a csa and they are all foreign to me but it was really good. I only used 3 strips of bacon and I had a few pieces of good lean ham that I diced up. I also used a little lemon on the top.

Very easy and delicious. Used mustard greens instead of kale and only used 1 cup of water. Great side dish.

I truly enjoyed this dish...so simple, so healthy, so filling! I think 2 cups of water is too much as I had to pour out quite a bit of water before serving. I threw in some toasted pumpkin seeds for crunch and it was great.

We really enjoyed this. The bacon is an easy way to make simply-prepared greens seem decadent. We added a splash of red wine vinegar right before serving. I also think that diced onions (crispy or caramelized, maybe?) would be a great addition to this dish.

Good stuff. Add enough bacon, and serve along side potatoes or rice as a main course. Be careful of adding salt though. Depending on the bacon, you might not need any.

B. Hastings is absolutely right that it's much easier to cook the bacon in a frying pan!

I cooked up this great recipe today and just added sautéed onions. My roommate and I absolutely loved it! The only suggestion my roommate had was to use stock instead of water. Personally, I liked it just as it is. It has a wonderful fresh taste.

Our CSA box had kale in it this week - I had never cooked it before. This was delicious! I didn't make the "cigars" - just trimmed the stems, gathered it and sliced it :) Only added a bit of water and covered it to finish cooking - left it tender crisp. Will try it with pancetta next time but it was delicious with bacon!

Delicious, just the way it is, and my daughter loves it, too! This is the first time I've eaten kale, and it's my new favorite green - slightly sweet, wonderfully tender-crisp to the bite, and not at all bitter the way some greens are. I made a smaller amount, and used kitchen shears to trim and cut the kale, and it didn't take nearly as long as the recipe said it would.

Made about 1/4 recipe as a hearty side dish to go with pumpkin soup and fresh bread for dinner. Used 1 bunch of kale, coarsely chopped (Rolled into cigars? Kale? Are you joking?), four slices of bacon (I said "hearty" side dish), 1 garlic clove and finished with just a dash of white balsamic vinegar to balance the bacon fat.

I would recommend using a LOT of Kale sine it reduces down to about a fifth of the volume you put in - also, it is amazingly annoying to cook bacon in the bottom of a pot, it is probably a better idea to cook it on a fryoing pan then transfer it to the pot once the garlic is infused. It would actually save a bit of effort to have a hot pot on the stove then add the kale and bacon juice+garlic at the same time.

This recipe was really good. My boyfriend who is "greens challenged" ate it before I could even blink. I used pancetta instead of bacon, I think this added a lot of flavor and balanced out the kale nicely. My sous-chief (aka boyfriend) was a little intimidated by the 'cigar rolls" so we tore it into pieces instead. much easier. definitely will make it again.

Very good and simple. I would say use pancetta instead of 'regular' bacon, or at least use a very high quality, farmer's market bacon.

Method works very well, results are good and pretty. Not as tasteful as i expected.

I made this today and added some red onion while cooking the garlic, and then some feta cheese after it was cooked! The feta really set off the other flavors and just made the dish for me! I grew the kale in my garden and picked it today. We also picked lettuce, a few tomatoes, apples, snow peas, and chard (which I added with the kale). Seasons? What seasons?

Very simple and easy, however with the Kale stems and tough ribs removed, I only sauteed it for 2 mins over high heat, and only added one tablespoon of water. Also I only used 2 strips of bacon very finely minced and it was perfectly salty. It was cooked but retained beautiful color and had a crisp "bite" to it. I'm making it again tonight!

I followed the recipe without addition and LOVED it. I wish I had read about adding leeks before however since that sounds delicious. I will do that next time as I will make this again and again.

I loved this recipe. It was very simple and a nice accompaniment to a simple meal. The only changes I made to this recipe was to use chicken stock instead of water and a little imported sea salt and a lot of cracked black pepper. I served it with chicken (roasted with diced tomatoes, onions, and mushrooms) and roasted sweet potaotes (just a little olive oil and salt roasted at high temp - the potato cooks quickly and has a nice crispy skin)

I love kale and can't find enough ways to cook it. I followed the recipe plus reviewers' additions of a leek, some cranberries (dried) and, in lieu of a carrot, grated parsnip. I really enjoyed it.

This was my first experience with kale. I was looking for something simple and this was it. Nice flavor and quick-- similar to recipes for other greens such as curly endive. I made it for two instead of eight. It didn't take the hour the recipe said. I look forward to making this again.

We thought this was great. After frying the bacon, I sauteed leek in bacon fat. Then added the garlic and shredded carrots I had on hand. Then steamed the kale per recipe instructions. When close to done, I tossed in dried currents with the bacon bits. The carrots and currents gave this dish a sweet/savory flavor that complimented the leftover pork roast. Delicious....

Like other reviewers, I did not have enough kale. Instead I added a small bunch of dandelion greens, garlic scapes, scallions, and thinly sliced zuchinni (sp?). We are not pork eaters in the family so we used turkey bacon instead, which required adding a little oliive oil to sautee that garlic, scapes and scallions. Sprinkle some crushed dried chiles and the dish turned out better than I expected! Even my husband, who is no fan of kale, liked it!

I like to steam veggies. So I sauteed the bacon, drained it and set it aside. Then sauteed the garlic in the bacon grease. In the meantime, I put the kale in the electric veg steamer and cooked it. Then tossed the cooked kale in the bacon/garlic oil and mixed in the bacon bits.

Excellent recipe. Didn't have any mushrooms to add as others suggested, but did have some grated italian cheese which was a delicious addition. Will definately make it again, and will try the mushrooms as an add.

very rich, but delicious for cool fall sunday dinner. served over whole wheat pasta. added 2c. asian mushrooms i had in the freezer and it was a wonderful addition to smoky/meaty flavor. kale was tender and green.

I used this recipe as the jumping off point for cleaning out the veggie drawer and it turned out super! I only had one bunch of kale, but I filled the dish out with sliced zucchini, a couple of tomatoes, and half an onion that was getting limp. I didn't have to use nearly as much water as called for (maybe b/c of the tomato and zucchini liquids?) I served it over pasta and everyone loved it, even the 9 year old who's not crazy about greens. Will definitely make this again, though I'm sure it'll be different next time according to what's wilting in the fridge at the moment!

This is an awesome vegetable. Not your run of the mill vegetable. I add some mushrooms (sliced) to mine and everyone loves it.

This gave us a whole new outlook on "greens". We've always had pressure cooked greens. This was stupendous. Even my husband (whose mother grew up on a mountain and is the queen of greens) loved it. I added the salt and pepper while it was simmering as I like salt to cook in a bit. I will try it next time with a bit smokier bacon.

Rating: 3
Definitely a keeper, and good enough for a holiday side dish. I use Canadian smoked bacon instead of the flabby, uninspired "bacon" in the grocery store...the flavor is so much better. PLUS--(my secret to adding flavor to almost everything)-- sautee the kale in DUCK FAT along with the bacon drippings. SO nutty and tasty. Agree about using stock instead of water. Before serving, I also add some toasted pine nuts sprinkled on the top, along with the rendered crunchy bacon bits. It always gets raves!

good! cooked a little longer than directed - don't like crunchy greens.

I saute onion and garlic in olive oil, then add kale (or any other green, e.g. turnip, beet,)and I'm another cook who uses a little chicken broth instead of water. My husband's favorite addition, however, is a can of cannelini beans with liquid. Just simmer until the liquid's almost evaporated.

We never had kale before, although we knew of its health benefits. I added chopped onion with the garlic and used chicken broth. Rather than tossing the bacon with the kale, I served the kale on the dinner plates sprinkled with the bacon. Fleur de sel added a little more crunch.

This is our standard prep for most greens, especially good with garden-fresh collards or mustard greens. I usually use a chopped onion as well, and while bacon is always good it's also very tasty to use some spicy or sweet sausage or, for a meatless version, vegetable broth plus (inexpensive) dry sherry instead of water.

I got a recipe just like this from everyday food. athey used chicken broth instead of water and the portions were smaller. Very tasty. To the cook asking about the water. I used 1/2 cup chicken broth for 1 bunch od kale, after 12 - 15 minutes when the kale was tender the broth was pretty much gone. I would cut down on the bacon too as I'm on a low fat diet.

This is my go-to recipe for kale. Very flavourful, just the right amount of smokiness comes through from the bacon, while letting the kale really shine.

Rating: 3
I'm giving this 3 forks based on the ingredients alone, but the recipe is unclear. Do you drain the water from the pot, or do you simmer until the water has evaporated?
