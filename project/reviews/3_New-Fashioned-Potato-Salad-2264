Disappointing. Was good but not great. My friends enjoyed it but no one went back for seconds and I didn't hear the raves for it that my other dishes received.

A great, light and not too mayonaisse-y potato salad. I used red potatoes with the skins on and left out the hard-boiled eggs and zuchinni. asy to make and very tasty.
