Excellent recipe and very little work other than taking stems off the spinach. I've cooked this several times and got rave reviews on New Year's Day. I add a little minced fresh garlic for some extra flavor.

Wonderful! Used frozen spinach (because that's what I had) and it still came out great. Using Tamari soy gives it a great depth of flavor.

Makes a nice tangy side dish. It's hard to make spinach taste better when used as a simple side dish, this recipe was great. WARNING: I used salted peanuts (it's all I had), the recipe tasted very salty. If you use Salted peanuts and Soy Sauce, please do not add any salt.

Very typical Japanese style spinach. Be careful, however...I generally add extra soy sauce to recipes as we like food rather salty...but this recipe cannot tolerate any extra soy sauce...it become overly salty very easily... I will make it again just following the instructions, however.
