The thought of these makes me delirious. Although, I plan on making these in the future, I would like to make these suggestions in the meantime. Maple sugar can be purchased at farmer's markets from farmer's who sell maple syrup. Ask for bulk prices instead of the small, expensive containers sometimes available. It keeps indefinitely. I get grade B syrup as the flavor is intense and has more nutrition. Rather like molasses versus white sugar. Grade C is my favorite but no longer easily available here in NYC. Maple syrup is quite healthy. It is rich in magnesium, zinc contains potassium, iron and trace B vitamins and lower in sugar than honey. Plus undiscovered benefits that I am sure are there. I have always considered it the blood of the tree. It is also available mail order from various farmers. Just google it if you live outside of maple country. I buy a gallon jug and keep it in my freezer. It doesn't freeze and keeps quite well with no mold.. A little most days is part of my daily vitamin intake naturally. As to donut failures, old flour can produce poor results. I personally use freshly milled wholewheat pastry flour from Cayuga Naturals. They mailorder as well and sell at various healthfood stores. They date their products so you know when it was grown. Yea! Good luck everyone and be well. Woof!

I just tried the recipe and am somewhat disappointed. Twice the mixing of the yeast failed on me. My yeast is good because I just used it and the date is fine. The first try I heated the milk to the temp recc in the recipe but no frothing occured after 10 min. I will admit I loosely covered it with plastic wrap and not sure if this is what killed the yeast. So I tried it again and the second attempt I heated the milk to the temp indicated on my yeast container 100 versus 110-115 as in the recipe. It seemed to do better and appeared to have foamed. I did not stir it before adding it to the egg mixture (possibly another mistake I made and I am kicking myself about it now) and so a lump of hard yeast ended up in the egg mixture which I broke up with a spoon but now feel that the dough is nixed. After mixing in the flour I put it in the fridge again disappointed that despite trying to follow the recipe it was not going to come together. Will let you know in the morning.

Do any of these reviews actually refer to the doughnut recipe? Has anyone tried these yet?

Another thing that could be used for this recipe is "Coconut Oil" there are many that I know that also swear by this as well.

Since I find that "intollerances" there are other things you'd be able to use instead. For "sugar" there are "ones" incase you are "intollerant" as for "Flour" since I've gotten great results by using "Farro" ( Spelt ) & works great.
