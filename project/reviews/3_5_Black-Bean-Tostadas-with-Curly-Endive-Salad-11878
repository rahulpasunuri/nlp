I revisited this recipe after several years, and I'm glad! I used fresh tomatoes from our garden in place of the sun-dried, and added the kernels from an ear of corn and some chopped cilantro. I used a mix of greens that contained endive for a less bitter taste. Delicious!

I have made this dish successfully multiple times, to the point I feel comfortable serving it to guests (which says a lot for me!). I have used romaine for the greens, which is fantastic (not a big endive person). One piece of advice I have: do not skip on the tortillas, but don't fry them either!! Spray them with canola and sprinkle with kosher salt and then broil in the toaster oven on both sides. Don't let them brown too much and they will develop a fantastic flavor but also be slightly chewy....and you skip all that fat!

I doubled the dish and made this for lactose intolerant vegetarian friends and it was quite well received. The flavors were good and the textures were substantial enough for non-vegetarians. I used already fried tostada shells and also served a barley-corn-roasted pepper side. I'm not convinced that the curly endive was absolutely essential.

Excellent, except that I think the beans should be halved. Next time I'd like to add fresh corn and red onions. I added 1 t of adobo, which I'd also like to increase. I would urge other cooks not to substitute other greens for the curly endive, since its slightly bitter flavor and its hardiness stand up well to the beans. I didn't bother with tostadas, but they (or tortilla crisps) would add a welcome texture.

I made this a little simpler by using Old El Paso tostada shells, plain vegetable oil instead of extra virgin, cold pressed (*blah-blah*) olive oil, and I also used simple iceberg lettuce instead of endive. The result was delicious and I'll definitely make it again.

I love this dish. I have made it time and time again... most recently at a vegetarian dinner party -- this was the real winner of the evening.

Easy and delicious! Didn't have canned sundried tomatoes so I used 1/2 a large fresh tomato - a terrific subsitution making it all the fresher! My only recommendation would be to add some hot sauce to the sauce. Overall EXCELLENT!

Fantastic. I think Jim meant to give this four forks. Oh well.

This one of the best! I have made it "double decked" and served it as an entree. This recipe is one of my most requested.

These are simple, but marvellous, especially in the summer, with gazpacho or a cold beverage.
