I have been making these cookies since 1995 and I LOVE them and make them every year for Christmas. They are melt-in-your-mouth good!! If they taste bland to you, make sure you are using HALF of the basic butter cookie dough.

For those who didn't love these cookies... something is wrong! They melt in your mouth and have wowed everyone who has tasted them. They are a Christmas staple in my Mom's kitchen - and she can cook!

I made these this Christmas along with my yearly batch of almond snowballs, and labeled these "mocha snowballs". I used finely ground fresh roasted coffee beans instead of espresso powder and used a bit more than the recipe called for. These were a good cookie. They are crunchy like the almond snowballs and they have a nice flavor. A nice addition to my holiday assortment.

Please don't be intimidated by this recipe's poor reviews, because these cookies are dee-licious. I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews, because I tend to like chewy cookies. When I made the dough, I was a little alarmed, because it was so dry and flaky, almost like shortbread. I made a double recipe anyway (using a full recipe of basic butter cookie dough and doubling the cocoa and espresso). The cookies ARE dry and crunchy (and I even shortened their bake time to 15 minutes), but they still stand well on their own without milk. They are rich in mocha flavor and remain soft in the center. The nuts are also a nice addition. If you want to make soft, gooey cookies, I would recommend that you don't make this recipe; however, if you enjoy dense, crumbly cookies with lots of buttery taste (like shortbread cookies), this is a good bet for you.

for those that said that it does not have enough coffee or chocolate flavor-did you use the recommeded HALF batch for butter cookie recipe? I thought it was good as did everyone who tried the 10 or so different cookies I baked for the holidays

These were hard, bland cookies. Needed either more chocolate or esperesso flavor, and softer would be better. Very disappointing.

This is a grand cookie. I have been making this recipe every Christmas since 1995. I buy very good quality espresso beans and have them gound the finest possible. The flavor is incomparable. I skip rolling them in powdered sugar because their color is lovely and they are very rich as is.

I make this recipe every year. The combination of chocolate and coffee is wonderful. I haven't been able to find espresso powder so I stick with regular instant coffee and it does the trick. This year, I substituted Ghirardelli Mocha Frappe powder and it was excellent! I also recommend dipping them twice in confectioner's sugar--once after they've cooled five minutes, and again when they're totally cooled. A family favorite!

This is a great little cookie. It's not going to be your signature cookie, or your holiday centerpiece but they're quick, tasty, and are a nice size to store while you do the rest of your holiday baking.

Just finished making my annual batch of these for Christmas cookie trays. They are so easy and delicious. I do not use the espresso but a combo of coffee and cafe mocha powder. GREAT COOKIES

These were like Mexican Wedding Cakes with the addition of coffee and cocoa powder; there wasn't much of a coffee or chocolate taste and they were on the dry side.

Okay, but not the best from these recipes. They were okay. I wouldn't bother with them again.

I received some of these several Christmases ago at a cookie exchange and they are now part of our Christmas traditions. I couldn't find espresso powder this year, so I used the darkest roast instant coffee available, and they were almost as good as with the expresso.

Like earlier reviewers I too used instant coffee instead of espresso. These are very good and easy to make.

If my 6 year old daughter won't stop eating them, it makes me very happy. I'm surprised because there's coffee in it. This was a recipe that she helped with from the beginning to the end and couldn't ruin it. I'm constantly in search of good "kids" recipes!?!

I used regular instant coffee, and these cookies came out perfectly! I think espresso would be too much and overpower the flavor of the chocolate. But they were the perfect combination of texture and taste. My only complaint is that I got nowhere near 6 dozen. I followed the recipe to the letter. I'll have to make a second batch for my family!

I made these for the first time in 1995, when the recipe was originally published, and sent a lot to my family. Now my mom and I usually make them when I come home for Christmas--we'll all crazy about them, and I find the flavor much more exciting than the usual Christmas cookies.

This is the first time I made these for holiday cookie trays. It was so easy and an excellent cookie. I used 2 heaping tsp of instant coffee. I had on hand internation foods cafe mocha and added 1 tsp of that. WOW !!!!!! RAVE REVIEWS. This will now be a regular in the cookie tray. I would also recommend rolling a second time in powdered sugar.

I had high hopes, since this looked like a nice variation on a childhood favorite, but this recipe was just plain nasty. The cookies turned out surprisingly tasteless - the chocolate just wasn't enough - maybe some almond extract would help, I don't know - and they tasted like cardboard. I expected a nice flavor from the espresso powder, but all that did was to give them a burnt flavor (and I know that they didn't burn). After tasting them, I threw the dough out - they weren't even worth the trouble of baking the rest.
