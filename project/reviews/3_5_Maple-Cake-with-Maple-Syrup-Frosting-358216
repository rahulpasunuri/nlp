I find most traditional cake recipes disappointing but this one has restored my faith. Absolutely delicious, though I made a few changes: 1) used buttermilk instead of milk 2) pricked cake layers all over and brushed generously with maple syrup before icing 3) used Ottolenghi maple icing recipe: 150gr unsulted butter, 150gr brown sugar, 130ml maple syrup, 330gr cream cheese. Doesn't get any better than this.

Fabulous cake. I actually made it without the frosting. We ate it plain, and it was perfect. I used vegan butter and maple syrup from our friend who makes his own from syrup from his own maple trees. My family gobbled this cake up and my kids said it was the best cake ever. If your cake didn't come out, you must have forgotten something. I will make this cake again and often.

i'm normally a pretty attentive baker, but i managed to accidentally double the butter and halve the milk on this recipe. (i put butter for the batter and the frosting on the counter to soften, then threw it all into the batter. oops. as for the milk, i figured i could add some to compensate for the extra butter...not realizing the recipe required milk anyway. sigh.) that said, the cake was a hit, even if it was a tad rich. i made it as a birthday cake for my boyfriend who looooves maple syrup, and he was thrilled. it also totally impressed all his friends. ftw.

I made this cake gluten free and it was AMAZING. Rich, moist and dense, this cake was a huge hit with everyone at our Easter dinner, even those who can eat gluten products. I can't say enough how delicious this recipe is, although it is time consuming and slightly more advanced than making cake from a box. If someone followed this recipe and it was a 'disaster' then they probably did miss a step or get a quantity wrong. Try it again, because it is well worth the effort. I too left out the shortening, but only because I did not have any on hand. In addition, I ran low on butter and had to use smart balance in the frosting. Next time I will try the shortening and make sure I have enough butter on hand. DELICIOUS!!!

I followed others and didn't put in the shortening because I made cupcakes (which are not good if they are dense). My only issue was that I felt the frosting was a tad bit runny if you are an avid decorator. I like to pipe frosting on my cupcakes and I needed a bit more stiffness to the frosting. I would alter the frosting recipe a bit if you want the frosting to stand up, but I think it is fine for just icing a regular cake. On another note, Target sells (Archer Farms brand) infused maple syrups, so you can use those if you want to experiment. I used the one infused with Cinnamon in the frosting just to give it something else interesting.

Horrible. It looks delicious on the photo but it is not!

Great cake, wonderfully rich and gourmet-tasting, nice textures too (not too dense). I used Grade A maple syrup instead of Grade B as recommended and there wasn't very much of a recognizable maple flavor however. Next time I'll go out and buy the Grade B as my after-the-fact research suggests that this has much more flavor and density.

I made cupcakes like Alex did. Everyone at dinner loved them. They taste so much better after a day or two. Good texture, great flavor. I skipped the vegetable shortening, otherwise, did as instructed. One recipe made about 24 cupcakes, though I barely had enough frosting to pipe over all of them. Will definitely make again.

Made this into cupcakes and they were delish! Followed the recipe to the letter, filled cupcake tins 3/4 each, and baked 20-25 minutes. Will definitely make again.

I've made this cake twice and it was a hit both times. The maple flavor is rich, the texture dense with the walnuts giving it a nice crunch. I followed the recipe to the letter and had great results both times.

This is a dense cake but just delicious. Have made it several times and everyone loves it.

I thought this cake was a disaster. It was the same density as a fudgy brownie and gummy and gross. I actually thought I forgot an ingredient when I first cut into it to serve my guests for my hubby's bday. Yucko! Will not make again. Major disappointment.

This is fantastic. I served it for Easter and had great reviews. My son thought someone brought it and I put it on the cake plate. Hope I remember to make this again.

A very dense cake and was a hit at the pot luck.
