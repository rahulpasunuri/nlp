I followed this recipe pretty closely, but made a few adjustments based on other reviews. Instead of five cups of water, I used four cups of vegetable stock and one cup of light coconut milk. I also doubled the spices. I served it with brown jasmine rice and roasted cauliflower-wasn't sure how my eight year old twin sons would respond to Indian food, but they loved it! It's difficult to find hearty main dishes that are vegetarian (we are not vegetarians, but I try to prepare two "non-meat" meals each week), and this one certainly delivered. Next time, I will make it a day ahead-the leftovers were fantastic, as the flavors developed more overnight. Kudos!

Wonderful and nourishing dish. This will be a standard in my home. As is, no adjustments.

We have enjoyed this satisfying stew many times and it continues to be a favorite in our family. I do, however, finely mince the ginger & garlic instead of pureeing. If you find it bland, try doubling the spices!

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. Having read previous reviews, I made a couple of adjustments. I used a can of coconut milk along with 4 cups of water. I added an extra 1/2 cup of lentils and an extra cup of peas. I also doubled the spices. The only new adjustment I would make in the future is that I would add more crushed red pepper. I LOVE SPICE.

With some modifications, this recipe turned out great. I cut the amount of lentils and water in half but left everything else the same--so I ended up with strong flavors. Based on the suggestion of another reviewer, I added some stewed tomatoes halfway through the lentils cooking. I also added about 1 tablespoon of tamarind paste in right at the end before serving--this added a little tang and helped make the flavors fuller. The toasted cumin seeds and red pepper flakes make the dish--do not skip this step! I found that totally cooking time for the lentils was about 1 hour.

Fantastic flavors! Used extra ginger & garlic in the puree, bumped up the curry powder & used madras curry powder, too. I made this a day before we were going to eat it since it's one that sounded like gets better the next day - waited to add the spinach, peas & cilantro until reheating. Served with brown basmati rice & roasted cauliflower per the suggestion and it was such a wonderful fusion of flavors & textures - my husband isn't an Indian food fan and he raved!

Two forks = Good. I would like to give this 2.5 forks, but that's not possible. This was tasty, but not incredible. It's easy to make and a good, healthy weeknight meal. Mildly spicy. It's versatile in that you can substitute a lot of different vegetables for the spinach and carrots. I'd make it again.

We made this recipe as written, preparing the main stew a day ahead, and it was delicious. We served it over roasted cauliflower. We also added sliced grilled turkey italian sausage, as we had it on hand and needed to eat it. Quite frankly, this stood on it's own just fine. We'll be having this again.

This was very good! I replaced half of the water with canned tomatoes and added a bunch of extra veggies-cauliflower, broccoli, potatoes, and I used swiss chard instead of spinach.

NOT impressed. followed recipe as written except added chix stock and tomatoes (after tasting it needed something!) but for me - I would rather spend my time and ingredients on better recipes.......

Rating: 2
Though the flavors were good, if mild, I found the ratios of veggies to lentils was entirely off. If I were to make it again, I would definitely not add quite as much water (it ended up being quite watery--so maybe I would start with three cups to cook the lentils in and then more as needed) and add more lentils overall!

Some nice deep flavors here. I used homemade veggie stock instead of water. I doubled the spices and added a tablespoon of sugar. Used diced potatoes instead of spinach. Served over white basmati rice flavored with chopped scallions.

Really delicious! I used less oil than called for, and a little more spice, and it was really good. I like the versatility where you can add just about any veggie on hand. Made the roasted cauliflower as well and served over brown texmati rice. Definitely a keeper, and putting the garlic/ginger in the blender was hardly a chore. Highly recommended!

Yum. I especially love the addition of the spinach, I think it takes it to a whole new level!

Delicious... my wife loved this on basmati rice. We have had it leftover from the fridge several nights in a row. It gets even better after a few days!

I thought this was great! I substituted coconut milk for some of the water and (at least) doubled the spices. I took this more as a jumping off point -- I added way more veggies including potatoes, sweet potatoes, cauliflower, green beans, and whatever else was around and it turned out famously!

Made the recipe exactly as is except for using a large bag of frozen spinach (thawed and squeezed dry) instead of fresh. Delicious. I will definitely make again.

I've made this recipe twice now, once with red lentils, and once with regular lentils, both were delicious!

I loved this. I made with Jasmine rice as well. We followed everything to plan except we forgot to add the topping of oil, cumin seed and red pepper flakes so we added red pepper flakes and it was delish. I will definitely make this again.

This was great. I made w/ Jasmine rice and served w/ some nicely cut radish on the side. My kids even at it. I had a ton of greens in the fridge so subbed collards for the spinach. I diced them real small to hide them from my daughter. Next time I may add some garbanzo beans or tofu for a little bit more weight (it's a cold night) as the dinner sits lightly on the stomach.

I took shortcuts - finely chopping the ginger & garlic rather than putting them in food processor. I also increased the spices and added fresh chilli & cardamon pods. Beautiful!

I also used veggie broth instead of water

This was a very good dish. I didn't have to chop too many things which I like. I forgot the ginger but I think it still turned out very flavorful. I served with saffron rice also. Delish!

Really very good. I doubled up all of the spices and spinach and added a couple of potatoes too. I used vegetable broth instead of water too. I put it over saffron rice with currants and cashews. Lovely!

I thought this was just OK. Dirties a lot of things (main pot, rice pot, blender, skillet, plus the usual items) for a so-so result. Surely there must be a better red lentil recipe. Won't make this again.

I added 4x as much spinach and 2x as much peas as was called for since I don't like rice - and it worked!

Very delicious and authentic tasting. An important element is the type of curry powder used. Don't skimp. Like other users I doubled the spices. I aslo recommend the roasted cauliflower as a side and also a raita. The yoghurt raita is cooling and a great contrast to the rich curry.

Yummy! Relatively easy although making ginger/garlic mix was indeed a pain. But can imagine the second time around it would go so fast. Bfriend who doesn't like anything approaching exotic loved it.

Hearty and nutritious meal! I followed the advice of several reviewers below and doubled all of the dry spices, and prepared everything else as written. The consistency seemed just right, but I could see taking out, say, 1/2 cup of the water. Next time I'll try it with vegetable broth. A keeper.

This might not be authentic Indian cooking but it is a fabulous vegetarian dish in its own right. We usually prefer more authentic Asian recipes but this is so good it derserves to be made regularly!

I followed the recipe to the "t" and it was really simple and delicious, as written. I let it cook a little longer to thicken it and served it as a stew with frozen Naan from Trader Joe's. Yum! I also put a dollop of sour cream and a squeeze of lemon to brighten it up a bit.

This recipe was fabulous! I doubled all of the spices and the lentils (I only had yellow lentils at the time) and added a little extra water as needed. I did not use the cumin red pepper mixture at the end. Just added the red pepper to the dish as it cooked then served this with brown rice. I can't think of a healthier dish to make every week!

My guests and me all loved this. I've made it several times since the first, and have found it to work just as well with frozen sliced carrots. Also, I prefer using frozen spinach, and far more of it (so that it is copious in the dish). Lastly, I amp up all the spices a lot. I basically just pour and pour, and it's even better!

This was both quite watery and also quite bland, despite the addition of more spices. I guess you could up the spices even more for a more assertive flavour, but I doubt I would bother to make this recipe again.

the "spice oil" is a very typical indian cooking technique called a "tadka", which is very useful for quickly adding flavor to cooked foods. tadkas use a wide variety of spices depending upon the dish; now that i'm comfortable making them (the line between toasted and burned is very delicate!) i have found myself using them to flavor all sorts of everyday things. (for example leftover rice... leftover veggies... etc.) the ginger-garlic puree isn't absolutely necessary. they could be minced instead for convenience (though the flavor will be slightly different).

This was very good. It looked, smelled and tasted like "real Indian food". It was quick and easy to make and is accomodating to a wide variety of veggies. I used about 1 tbsp of the oil for a good healthy dinner.

Even though it's a little bit of a pain to make a garlic-ginger paste, I liked the way the dal with vegetables, rice and roasted cauliflower went together. When the whole dish was complete, the dal wasn't too soupy (as I feared it might be, with that ratio of water to dal.) It was festive looking on the plate, too. We ate it with pineapple chutney--very good.

Loved this recipe because a lot of the work can be done ahead (make the lentils a day before; flavors improve) and because the colors and flavors are lovely. The spice oil adds significant flavor. My picky vegetarian kids really liked it, so maybe others will also. Can add spinach at v last moment (or leave out, but it adds more nutriotion and color). Stick w/ basmati rice, as brown rice would have been too heavy and taken away fr the lentil flavors.

Don't get me wrong, this really was very tasty. But... it just seems like a long way to go for curried lentils. Is it really necessary to puree the garlic and ginger in water before adding it to the onions? No, probably not. I think I'll stick to my simpiler daal recipes.

Delicious dish. The flavors are well balanced and the assortment of vegetables really brightens the lentils. I served it with roasted whole snapper and basmati rice. Definitely a keeper.

I found it far too watery - 5 1/2 cups of water to 1 cup of lentils??? Made it again using more lentils and less water and it was fabulous. Very fast and easy - a nice light and healthy vegetarian meal. The roasted cauliflower was great and a really nice addition.

very nice. the spice oil is a great addition. I used brocolli and potatoes instead of spinach and peas, and it was great. also the roasted cauliflower was fabulous. I just stirred it into the lentils.
