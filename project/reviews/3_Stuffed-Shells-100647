I followed the recipe except for after reading the reviews I added "Parmesan dust" (you know the cheap stuff you get in a green plastic container) to the stuffing to taste. It is what I used to use it in the full fat version. I doubled the recipe and froze 2 pans which we just had last night. It was even better the second time.

I must admit, I cheated on this recipe. I used pre-made sauce, garlic basil blend seasoning and added shredded cheddar to the filling. I've been looking for inventive ways to get more tofu in my diet and this will be a regular meal in our home. This entree is wonderful. The tofu is not at all obvious, so this dish should please most people who enjoy Italian. The whole thing only took about an hour to prepare. Of course, I used the sauce and seasoning, but still for the work that went into it, I'll have meals for at least two days.

I thought this was good, but my fiance thought it was missing something. It may be that he's a bit of a wimp with the tofu. I agreed that the filling needed a little more flavor, though. I would make it again, but would probably share with some tofu-loving friends next time.

This dish is very tasty. I made this for my coworkers and they enjoyed it. It's really simple to make. I would make sure to add the balsamic vinegar, the tomatos take on the flavor really well.

Blech! Between stupid ingredients (calling for cans of whole tomatoes instead of chopped and then directions to chop the tomatoes) and bizarre outcomes(pulverized parsley making the filling looking like Green Goddess dressing, it was a looser. And that was even before we tasted it. My husband, gamely choked down several mouthfuls aftering hearing about the 2 hours of preparation. As for me, forget it. Good thing we had garlic bread dripping in high fat butter.

With a little adaptation, this recipe is fantastic and satisfying. For the tomato sauce I used one 23 oz box Pomi chopped tomatoes, one 15 oz can crushed tomatoes, and half a can of sauce. I also doubled the garlic and added oregano. The balsamic vinegar is an excellent addition. The key for the cheese filling is to use the correct amount of Tofu and drain well. Use more, and you'll get a runny filling. I used part skim ricotta and mozarella, and also added chopped spinach. Be sure to cook the shells al dente, or they'll be too soft. Excellent dish!

My husband couldn't even tell it was supposed to be good for him, and he loves Italian food.

This dish turned out so-so for me. I used almost a whole 19 oz silken tofu, so that probably made the filling too liquid, but something else about the taste just didn't hit the spot. Making the tomato sauce ahead of time was a definite must.

I added some raw spinach to this recipe (processed it with the cheese), added more onion and garlic in the sauce and a dash of nutmeg (also processed with the cheeses) and that zipped up the recipe without making it high in fat.

I'm 15, and i make dinner every sunday night for my parents. We all really enjoyed this recipe, although it was a little bland. garlic and scallions and maybe even some lemon would be a nice touch

The second time we made this recipe, we used crushed tomatoes instead and added oregano, basil, and a bay leaf...using whole-milk ricotta also made it MUCH less bland and we couldn't stop eating them! Jenn & Pete

I liked the fact that this dish was low-fat, but it was too bland for my taste. It also needed some more sauce. Next time, I will add a can of tomato sauce, as suggested by another reviewer.

A good low-fat recipe, and nice to have one with tofu. I found it bland, but was uncontrollably drawn to it...I kept eating and eating. I made a half-recipe, and cooked the sauce down too much - unlike another reviewer, my batch turned out not 'wet' enough. So don't be afraid to cook those tomatoes down to a consistency you're happy with. The texture of the cheese mixture came out a little grainy for me. I'd make it again, because of its lowfat nature. But it's not up there as a star recipe.

this was a great recipe for shells, especially the cheese mixture. the only thing that I would change is the use of only one can of tomatoes and one can of equal size of sauce. The tomato sauce stayed a little too juicy for my taste. The leftovers would have been better had they not been so wet. Overall it was very satisfying and my fiance' went back for seconds.

My boyfriend won't eat tofu but he loved this recipie. I added more garlic and some bay leaves for extra flavor. It also makes for great leftovers.

I thought this recipe could use a little jazzing up. BUT - my family ate every little bit of it! I thought that the kids might balk at the creamy, cheesey filling, but they didn't. I'll make it again and will probably add some basil or other spices.

In my quest to find uses for tofu, I came across this recipe and really loved it! A great veg meal.

This was my first recipe using tofu. I thought it was delicious and best of all my finicky husband liked it too. It was fresh and had lots of flavor without being overwhelming.
