Sorry I didn't like these at all. The Salsa Verde was good, but the artichokes were horrible. I had a thermometer for the oil so I know I had the temperature right. They were just greasy and horrible. I really wanted to like this recipe but next time I think I would just serve steamed artichokes with the salsa.

We were recently in Rome and NONE of their artichokes were nearly as good as these. Very good!

A different way to serve artichokes. Got "crispy" too fast. Think next time I'll cook longer on lower temp, then raise heat. The tips were extremely crispy - not sure if this is how it is suppose to be,where you can only eat the end near heart, or are you suppose to heat the whole leaf?

This dish was both interesting and different to make. I would not fry in a 2-quart saucepan. The second time you fry the oil is extremely hot! If those artichokes are the least bit wet the heavy olive oil will really pop. I would suggest a "deep fryer" with a basket you can submerge. The leaves will still curl and very nicely, but the oil needs to be at 365 the second time. Don't hold the artichokes by a fork, that's too close and really heats up your fork and hand, even for a few seconds. Also, I enjoyed the dressing, but I eliminated the anchovy paste and used an artichoke relish. This worked out nicely because you need something to bind it. Perhaps some dijon mustard would be tasty. I'd also increase the amount of oil and lemon juice. Also the leaves you pull off have some meat on them. I threw those into the oil too!! Makes a nice presentation.
