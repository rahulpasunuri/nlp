The recipe works but after 1 or 2 they are too rich to eat any more. Best to be taken to parties or work. You won't want to eat them all.

These turned out well for me. If you have problems with your chocolate being too thick, add a small amount of parifin (spelling) wax or shortening(Crisco).

Since no one has written a review on these in years, I'll jump in. I have been making these truffles for a few years now. They are no doubt delicious and actually the only way to screw them up is to have the white chocolate not cooperate. I always use really good quality ingredients so I've never had a problem myself. However, I do have a tendency to vary things greatly, to the point that I pulled up this recipe today to confirm the original ingredients and quantities. Here are my comments based on making these a dozen+ times: 1. I very seldom add the ground up coffee beans because I prefer a creamy texture 2. I love ginger, so I usually add some powdered ginger 3. Do go out of your way to find actual instant espresso. Believe me, it's worth it and can make the difference between these being good and amazing. 4. Actually, sometimes I don't add any coffee at all, and just use the ginger with the cinnamon and nutmeg. 5. I have made these without the whipping cream and they have been fine, but I use it if I can. 6. I have attempted to make these vegan with decent results by using white chocolate containing no dairy, and using plain soy yogurt instead of the creme fraiche and omited the whipping cream. 7. I really like the gloved technique recommended by another reviewer for a delicate coat, but I often dip just to get that thick hard crunch on the outside. Plus, when I make them vegan the inside is softer and very susceptible to melting so I always have to dip those. 8. Last, I have used both white and dark chocolate on the outside. Both are really good. White looks more exotic and is a great for the holidays, while [good quality] dark chocolate is a hit with classic chocolate lovers. Good luck and enjoy!

I just made these truffles, and I think they are yummy! I followed the recipe, except for adding the ground coffee, which I thought would make the truffles gritty. One hint about melting the white chocolate - I melted mine in a heavy saucepan, directly on low heat on the stove, NOT over hot water. White chocolate is extremely tempermental, and the slightest drop of water can cause it to seize. I stirred it constantly until it was almost melted, then took it off the heat and let the residual heat in the pan melt the rest of the chocolate. No problems at all with gloppy chocolate! For coating the truffles, I used the suggestion in another truffle recipe on this site. You use a gloved hand with some melted chocolate smeared on it to coat the truffle. Much easier than the fork method.

As the others said, the chocolate outer coating was substantially more trouble than it was worth, but the insides are very good, tasting most strongly of coffee (perhaps only use the grounds next time) with hints of the other spices. I only tried the chocolate coating on half of the truffles, got frustrated, and used grated white chocolate and powdered sugar for the outsides of the others.

Back when this recipe came out, it was my first attempt at truffles. I followed the recipe exactly, using Lindt chocolate and instant espresso powder. They came out perfectly, looking like they could be on the shelf of a candy store. The flavor is excellent and well worth the effort because it is so unique. I topped with coffee beans. They have been a requested gift from that day forward.

Since this recipe first appeared in 1998, I've made these many times and have had great success with them. I've always used Callebaut chocolate, though. This year, my usual source didn't have Callebaut so I used Ghirardelli and ended up having the same frustrating experience as the cook in West Chester, OH. Same story with Lindt! I can only conclude that the chocolate makes a huge difference, possibly because of the sugar-fat ratio. The chocolate just wouldn't melt smoothly, although I tried several different temperatures and techniques. Per other suggestions, I'll try Baker's and see what happens. What a disappointment! I'm still giving this 3 forks because of past successes but must now add a cautionary note re: chocolate brands. The truffle mixture itself is delicious with a wonderfully unexpected flavor combination; everyone I've given these to has loved them. I'd really appreciate hearing about other people's experiences re: chocolate and am up for suggestions!

These tasted ok. My instant coffee didn't dissolve, leaving the inside a little crunchy. The taste wasn't bad, though. They were a royal pita to coat, though. I used girardelli (I know there's an h in there somewhere...) white chocolate, and it sorta melted into a thick glop. The truffles weren't very attractive, since getting the excess to drip off was a chore, and getting them off the fork I was using without messing up the coated truffle was next to impossible. I wouldn't make again unless I knew for sure I could get a better coating.

Unfortunately, I was making these for Christmas presents. Making a double recipe was extremely high maintenance. I didn't have enough room in my freezer even for a single recipe. The coffee-spice flavor of the center was delicious. I just found the second dipping in white chocolate to be cumbersome.

I am indulging in one of these awesome truffles as I write! Very easy to make and you will get 24 impressive, delicious truffles. I was afraid that the dipping in white chocolate was beyond my skill level, but the truffle mixture held together beatifully during dipping. I used Baker's white - only needed 9 oz. vs. 12 for 24 truffles. I made two other truffle varieties and plan to give out to neighbors to enjoy with their champagne on Christmas or New Year's Eve!

I made these last year and double-ground the espresso beans so they were very fine. A big hit!

A hit with everyone I gifted these with. Very good.

The first time I made them I found the ground espresso beans a bit much (they left the grounds in your mouth) so I omitted them added a little more espresso powder and Kaluha. The texture was creamy and they were a smash hit. Definitely use Bakers for coating.

While the taste was satisfying, it wasn't the best truffle I've had or made. The core refused to hold its shape at room temp (even after a night in the freezer) - maybe a better quality white chocolate would've done the trick. Many believed the center was cookie dough.

Very good, but a little artificial tasting with the instant coffee. If there was a way to make them using real espresso, that would be better.
