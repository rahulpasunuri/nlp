Perfect with the pork chops with mustard crust. I made the taters the day before and heated them before adding spring onions. My husband was a happy boy.

Instead of the spring onions I used leeks, which (where I live) are at least five times cheaper, and instead of English mustard I used coarse-grain Dutch mustard. If you make sure that the leeks are cooked for about five minutes, they will turn out nice and crunchy. Definitely a keeper.

These were easier than I thought and smooth and tasty. I used chopped red onion because I didn't have spring onions. I also reconstituted Coleman's dry mustard, 1 1/2 Tbl to an equal amount of water. Wow! I served these with a pork chop recipe similar to the bastille pork chops, that is from Bon Appetit, but not posted.

I made it with the mustard crusted pork chops as that recipe suggests. The combination was great with some steamed brocolli. It made a really nice meal. And it wasn't really all that much work either! (-:
