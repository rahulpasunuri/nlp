I love both arugula and fennel, but I'm afraid the combination is not satisfying to me. I also tried the Arugula, Fennel, and Ricotta Insalata and I had the same reaction. I've tried a few of the Arugula salad recipes on this site and my favorite is Arugula, Pear, and Stilton salad.

I loved this salad! Although not a salad to stand on it's own (very strong), it went beautifully followed by a light soup.

This recipe is a winner! I wasn't able to find arugula at the grocery, so I substituted mustard greens. It was still a bit peppery and looked lovely. The dressing was a little bland, but pepper helped and the parmesan added a nice salty contrast.

Flavorful yet light; a pleasant variation on what I consider to be the ultimate arugula-fennel salad (see Salad of Fennel, Arugula, and Ricotta Salata). This one has a bit more of a salty-savory taste because of the chicken broth and the cheese (I did end up substituting pecorino romano for the parmesan).

Yum, to make a full meal, I served this on top of smoked salmon (raw salmon would be good too though) and made herb cream cheese canapes to serve with it. Yummy and lite.

Fresh tasting, reminds me of Italy. Easy and impressive.
