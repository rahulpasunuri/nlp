nd only used half of the amount in the recipe. Also. the bok choy was nice but it would be good without it. Will make this many more times in the future. Served it with hearty multi-grain bakery bread.

This soup was good and very filling, but not quite good enough to be worth the cost of the ingredients in my opinion. Just the Bok Choy and Mushrooms ran me nearly $20. I added a little bit of white pepper. I might make this again when I have "free" bok choy from my own garden, but I wouldn't go to the store just to make it again. It does get some bonus points for being an easy to make but healthy, low fat meal.

Very good - we added a cup of fresh basil. We also decreased the soy sauce to a few dashes (enough round out the flavor). Very good and flavorful.

I did not rate this recipe because I made so many alterations, but it came out DELICIOUS, and I would highly recommend my changes. I omitted the bok choy. I added 2 parsnips, cut like the carrots (and when mashing the potatoes, I also mashed a few parsnip pieces). I added 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon, nutmeg, white pepper, and cumin. I seasoned generously with salt and pepper at the end. It was a delicious meal served with couscous in the bottom of the bowl. Enjoy! I don't eat meat, but my husband said it would have also been wonderful with some sort of stringy, stewy beef (brisket, maybe?).

Having had the real deal at the Centre Street Cafe in Jamaica Plain, I know this recipe is fantastic. So tasty on a snowy afternoon.

Excellent light, quick, mid-week dinner with some crusty bread. Made it several times already.

This was great! It's a nice and hearty stew, perfect for the colder months. I didn't use the bok choy, and didn't use all that soy sauce (just enough to taste). Came out wonderfully.

You should add some dirt to this and it would taste the same. It was somewhere between the potatoes and the mushrooms that left me on my kitchen floor with a mild concussion. Even my dog Billy- Beth "bad breath" would not eat this dish. It was deja- vu of McDonalds newest item the grilled crap stuffed fajita with spicy wombat sauce straight from Australias roads.

I made this after a visit to the Farmer's Market. With fresh vegetables, it was delicious.

Good but sort of ordinary. Reminded me of the everyday soups at so many soup & salad bars of the '80s. I use Morga vegetable broth, which I know is salty and I usually cut back other salt--so adding in soy sauce made a little too salty.

This was wonderful, hearty comfort food. The mushrooms gave it a beefy flavor and it was perfect for a cold fall evening.
