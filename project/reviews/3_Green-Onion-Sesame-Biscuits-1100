Wow, I finally found a biscuit recipe I like, after trying 4 different recipes on this site in 1 day. The only modification I made was baking them for 20 minutes at 425F (I might have used more garlic too). Biscuits came out moist inside and little crisp at the bottom. Maybe it helped that after cutting them into pieces, I wrapped them and put them in the fridge for a couple of hours, then baked them straight from the fridge when I needed to. Not your typical morning biscuit to go with jam, bec in itself is very tasty.
