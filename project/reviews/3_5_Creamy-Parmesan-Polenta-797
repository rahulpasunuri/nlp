This recipe was very good but I wish the parmesan flavor popped a bit more. This was our first time making polenta and we will again!

Everyone I make this for loves it! It's so quick and easy. I use milk instead of cream and I don't even bother adding the remaining cheese on top. Real comfort food.

I served this alongside my osso buco, and it was perfect. Simple, too - what a bonus.

It's wonderful (as are most polenta recipes) but the problem with this site is they don't specify using coarse ground cornmeal---the type they use in Italy. To get the creamiest polenta, you do not need butter or cream, you just need to work very slowly, at a simmer, and while you don't have to stir constantly, you do have to stir fairly frequently. The longer you cook it (with enough liquid) the creamier the polenta will be (if you are using the coarse ground meal. Polenta is good with almost everything!

We may try this recipe again, perhaps with a different cheese. Must say that this is the best polenta recipe we've tried so far. Still trying to a get a creamier polenta though.
