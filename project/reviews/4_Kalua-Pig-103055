Loved this recipe! Even more for the fact that it was super easy. I used specialty sea salt (smoked and Hawaiian) that I got from a spice shop. I ended up serving it as a slider with coleslaw and bbq sauce on King Hawaiian Sweet Rolls. The only thing I had to do was to fill it with water a few times because my pan was pretty big. The end result was delicious pork with a slight smoke that shredded wonderfully.

I made this for an Oscar party and while it was good, I was glad I put out some homemade chutneys and peach salsa to liven it up. It's not nearly as good as the North Carolina pulled pork recipe from Steve Raichlen, which is a great party dish with lots more flavor.

Yum. Since I made this in a crock pot, I used a smaller shoulder and threw in a tenderloin so it was a little less fatty. Fantastic with Cabbage the next day!

I had a kalua pork sandwiche with mango barbecue sauce in Maui and loved it. This pork recipe following the reviewer's from Hawaii's cooking instructions is terrific. One, 1 pound, package of frozen banana leaves is more than enough,as previously stated. This site has a spicy chutney barbecue sauce that goes great with this pork on kaiser rolls.

I, too, had kalua pork in Hawaii and found it delicious. I also had a mango barbecue sauce with it there. This is a terrific recipe and other than following the reviewer's cooking directions, I followed everything else. There's a terrific simple mango bbq sauce on this site if you'd like to make the pork into sandwiches on kaiser buns as we enjoyed.

This recipe was an absolute hit! 6 pounds between 14 people was gone in 15 minutes. A couple of hints based on reviewer comments: Banana leaves are best found in Asian or Latin markets and are generally frozen (about $1 for more than you'll ever need). I did read about someone having trouble with the heat. Had I not been watching I might have as well. After about 2 hours the water had dryed up and some drippings which hit the pan started to smoke. Fortunately the banana leaves (which really are necessary) kept the meat moist. Make certain to wrap in foil very well, this is key. Check the water in the roasting pan occasionally and refill as necessary. This should prevent any disasters. Otherwise this recipe is zero fail. I fell in love with this dish in Hawaii and thanks to this recipe I won't have to sport serious cash for a plane ticket to get it again.

This is the first time that I've made a dish based on a recipe that I've found on Epicurious.com. The problem I had with this recipe was a basic one but one that could have been avoided if the author had been more thorough. The recipe called for the oven to be "preheated" to 500f. It neglects to tell you to turn the heat down after 1 hour of cooking time. If you read through the recipe you'll also find that the author, in addition to forgetting to tell you to turn the heat down, has lost 1 hour from the total of 5+hours or cooking. The author tells you, after preheating the oven to 500f, to cook the pork for 4 hours. Needless to say I ruined a 6 pound pork shoulder, wasted 4 hours of my time and filling my house with smoke. I must have missed something or must not be a very good cook myself not to have researched anohter recipe, which I did when the pork started smoking, to check on the temperature. I had a sneeking suspecious that 500f was going to be a problem. I was right. Kirk

Just can't make this often engouh. I use a whole shoulder and just cook it longer. Southern soupermarkets have pork shoulders with the skin still on. This is the BEST. In the Fla. Keys, I make it with jerk seasoning and LOTS of salt. In the mountains of PA is use chili and brown sugar seasoning and lots of salt. Usually, I just skip the smoke. The leftovers are heaven, but usually my guests are fighting over the scraps. MAKE THIS DISH.

Delicious- very tasty. I did about 14lbs of meat so had to get up and 4am to begin as it had to cook 8 hours- no banana leaves in my neighbourhood (I was eyeing my neighbours gardens)but still very tasty- can't wait to try it again with the banana leaves to see how more fantastic it'll be. Extremely easy to make. Do not shred (which only took me 5 mins.)until last minute- I shredded and put back in oven to wait for the other super bowlers to arrive and it began to dry out- but still very flavorful and everyone loved it!

I liked this, but next time I won't trim the fat so much - I think it helps the succulence. I will also cut it into smaller section so that the salt and liquid smoke hit more surfaces. I admittedly cooked it too long and it was a little dry. I used a Nesco electric roaster - very easy.

Perfect. I used shaines cook time, but otherwise follwed the directions as written. I served it at my supper club (it was Hawaiian Night). Everyone really liked it. I just loved the smell of the banana leaves!

Made this for Easter sans banana leaves and water in roasting pan. Very easy with sensational results! After shredding cooked pork I added a head of coarsely chopped and sauteed cabbage. With rice this makes an easy and unforgettable meal.

Tender and succulent. It just melts in your mouth. The pork was so tender, that when I tried to pick up the roast with tongs after roasting, it completely fell apart. I used Shaine's temperature guidelines (perfect) and didn't use the banana leaves. This is a keeper.

Disclaimer: I usually don't deviate too much from the original recipes here, and if I do I don't rate them since at that point they are no longer the recipe written. That said, I have to give this pork high marks for its ability to be many things to many people. First deviation was that I used the temperatures and times that Shaines, below, suggested. My second deviation was a result of my laziness, rather than my curiosity: I picked up a bone-in pork shoulder instead of boneless and was too lazy to bone it, so it was baked whole. My final deviation was the addition of Cuban mojo sauce in the baking process alongside the liquid smoke. For the uninitiated, Mojo is a Cuban sauce made with citrus (sour orange is traditional, but it can be made with lemon, lime, even grapefruit on occasion), garlic and olive oil. A tiny bit of reduction of the sauce at the end and the result was mana. Tender, succulent pork. A great recipe all around, as is, or tinkered with.

This was very, very good. I didn't give it 4 forks because the liquid smoke was just overpowering. So, I made some modifications, which, by the way, include an easy to prepare barbeque sauce that makes this taste like good old Southern pulled pork barbeque. I do not like commercial barbeque sauces at all. They're usually too sweet and too tomatoe-y. I found the barbeque sauce that I did use on the Net on AllRecipes.com. I added more hot sauce than is recommended. You can also omit the banana leaves and just use heavy duty aluminum foil. Just add a smidge of liquid smoke (3/4 tbsp) and this barbeque sauce to the pork before you cook it, and several hours later, you'll be enjoying some delicious pork barbeque with a fantastic sauce right in the pot. 1 quart white vinegar 1 cup white sugar 3/4 cup ketchup 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce 1/4 cup hot sauce 1/8 cup salt 1/8 cup ground black pepper Combine vinegar, sugar, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, salt and pepper in a large jar and shake well. Enjoy!

This was so ono(good.) I was cooking for a luau for 40 people so I guadrupled the recipe, which left us with left-overs. I love having this on a tortilla the next day with cheese, hot sauce and lettuce. We lived on Kauai 6 years ago and miss it so much. This brought back some memories and my guests loved it too. I didn't use the banana leaves, but great regardless.

for thanksgiving we like to kalua a turkey(never dry)one year we had too many people and not enough turkey so I took a pork butt and stuffed it into the turkey seasoned it with hawaiian (coarse sea salt) and put it in a roasting pan poured about a cup and a half water mixed with a littil liquid smoke tightly covered it with foil and through it into the oven on 350 degrees for about 5 hoursit was so ono(good in hawaiian)that now we do it everytime, also one tine I put lop-cheong (chinese sweet sausage)into the turkey cavity along with the pig, all our friends request that we do the turkey that way everytime. and now that we live in Oregon all our hawaii friends and mainland friends alike get a taste of the islands. Aloha,

Followed advise of cserfoss and shaines as for 500 for 30, then 350 for 35 min per lb. thereafter. Halfway thru the foil packet developed a leak and some sauce was lost. Rewrapped it tightly, resumed cooking and it was still melt-in-your mouth tender. Southerner's often serve pulled-pork with personal or regional variations of barbeque sauce. Does anyone have any different sauce ideas that they have used that would make this even more awesome?

This is one of the most delicious recipes we have tried on Epicurious. Our friends who know Alan Wong made lomi lomi salmon and coarse-ground salt to garnish it, which made it even better. We used the 500' for 30' method, then 350' for 35' per lb., and cooked it an extra hour waiting for the side dishes. Awesome is an understatement!

I tried the recipe verbatum. Very overcooked with less than 3/4 lb. useable meat (although it was excellent). In trying shaines technique of 500 for 30 min. then 350 for 35 min per pound worked perfectly. I did wrap the meat with banana leaves, but didn't put water in the broiler pan, but instead in a pan under the one containing the meat. I can't recommend this recipe enough.

In response to the above question. The recipe that I grew up with in Hawaii is roast at 500 for 30 minutes, then lower temp to 350 for 35 minutes per pound of pork. This is a small variation from the Best of Aloha Cookbook.

I have used this receipe since I left Hawaii for a easy taste of home. I put the pork butt in a pasta pot, water under the sieve to keep the meat moist, and to keep the fat from burning as it renders. The seive keeps the meat out of the fat and easier to handle after it is done as it should be falling apart. I don't need foil or leaves. I use 200 degrees for 5 hrs, then increase temp to 350 & add onions & sweet potatoes. Roast 1 hr more, until vegs are done. Meat can't be overdone.

Just wondering... could the oven temperature of 500 degrees be correct? For some reason it seems to cook for 4 hours at that temperature would result in one very overcooked and dried out pork. And I don't know if I'd want the oven on for that long at such high heat. Does anyone know if this is correct?
