Sorry, I didn't like this all that much. I certainly tasted the garlic and the crushed red pepper but osmehow the tastes didn't really blend for me. I did like the panko crumbs, though.

This was really tasty. I used a little less red pepper and onions. The onions were a sweeter white variety because that was what I had in the house. Next time I will use much bigger shrimp because my husband and I both prefer the meatier mouth feel with the larger size.

Yum! I served this over orzo as recommended and doubled the red pepper flakes. Next time I may add a chile pepper to up the heat.

The main ingredients are shrimp, butter and wine, whats not to like? I add capers and serve over rice pilaf with broccoli or green beans as a side.

Easy and delicious - that's why I give it four forks. Be sure to serve with lemon wedges as it really enhances the flavors. I serve as a main course over angel hair pasta with roasted broccoli on the side. Delicious, easy weeknight meal and would be great for company too.

Blissfully garlicky and delicious! Scampi is the greatest dish because it is delicious, healthy, and easy! I don't think the panko really added much to this dish. When I make it again (which I definitely will!) I think I'll strain the broth into another bowl, toss the shrimp in the panko, then ladle the broth into serving dishes and top with the shrimp. Make sure to serve this with lots of crusty bread! I also think this would taste great with sliced squid added to the shrimp.

Great recipe. As always it takes a little longer with prep time than the posted amount unless your sous chef has done all your chopping, mincing and prep. I held off on the lemon wedges because I was serving spinach that has a squeeze of lemon on it already. Next time I am going to try it in a really large pan for a big group (10+) and serve it family style. It should work that way and be a great type of comfort food.

There seems to be a lot of dissention and perhaps even contempt regarding this recipe. Hmm? I like it. I don't measure the ingredients. I guess more or less. As a rule, I always substitute cilantro for parsley. I follow the recipe as written. Taste, then decide on how to tweak it next time. I made it tonight for the second time. I made basmati rice with the shrimp concotion and sauce on top with the panko bread crumbs(mixed with cilantro). I served this with steamed asparagus with butter and a Spanish Rioja wine. No offense, but in my opinion, if you don't like this, well, you may want to stick with a recipe from one of the chain restaurants.

I would cut the brading in half. It took all the juice. The flavor was good if there was more juice.

Not sure what all the bland reviews are about, this was delicious. I didn't have access to panko, so used the coarsest, dry breadcrumbs I could find, with the only other change being to add the juice from the lemon to the dish just before finishing, instead of as wedges. A fairly common Pinot Grigio worked well in the dish and to accompany it. That and a green salad with a simple dressing of sweet Balsamic and Olive Oil, and some fresh, crusty bread was just the ticket on a cold night. Quick and very easy.

This was easy and turned out well. To A Cook from London: my experience is that Panko's (typically found in the international aisle here) very light and crispy ; breadcrumbs a bit more dense and hard. If you don't have Panko, I would food process toasted breadcrumbs until they're fine and believe it would still work well.

I thought this was very good. Classic shrimp scampi is not an in- your-face dish. It plays off the sweetness of shrimp and garlic and uses parsley as its only herb. The red onion adds to the mellow sweetness and the red pepper, well, peps it up. I think folks may have expected something different, maybe more along the lines of putanesca sauce, which is much more strongly flavored. I did add a little more pepper and next time will add lemon before serving, rather that as wedges, because I thought it pulled everything together. This was great with crusty bread to sop everything up, which is how traditional shrimp scampi works best. Maybe putting it on pasta made it seem bland.

This seems bland because it has no herbs - I added some fresh basil and a little dried oregano. It has enough garlic but also needs at least 1 tsp red pepper.

What's the difference between Panko and ordinary breadcrumbs?

Cook from Colorado your idea sounds yummy...will definitely try it. Everyone's ideas differ when it comes to taste and it's terrific to hear intelligent ideas.

Recipe was good but needed little more red pepper and garlic. Served with freshly grated romano cheese. Had mixed green salad with balsamic vinegar & olive oil as a side dish. Making this again with extras.

To luvinfun from TO. I for one would like to see some of your old reliable recipes for shrimp. Am always looking for something different.

I agree that we should all try to help each other here. There are a few things that I would like to add. This dish should not be that bland. 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper should lead to a pretty spicy dish. If you want it a little spicier saute the pepper flakes first before adding the other ingredients. This will release the oils from the flakes which contain the spicy flavor. Adding a small amount of cumin (1/8 tsp here) seams also to turn on the spicy taste receptors. Also check the age of your spices as their potency goes down over time. Lastly, loss of taste can be caused by many things such smoking, alcohol use, oral surgery, sinus cancer. It can be very serious and even fatal. We are all different so try and keep it positive.

Rude would be a "cook" from Minot N.D. And I agree the need to insult others make me suspect the value of their opinion. The recipe is a good start needs some tinkering, more seasoning, I added a tablespoon of Dried tomato and more pepper and garlic.

So who's being rude? I couldn't find a rude comment anywhere.

Note to self: I will always review the recipe and not the other reviewers. Let's all be nice to each other. Rudeness is so unattractive and has become so commonplace to almost makes it acceptable. The recipe was OK in a pinch but I have a number of other great old reliable recipes for shrimp.

I liked the simple fresh flavor of this recipe. Not so spicey or bland for my taste. To the cook in Minot ND: Is there anything but chain resturants there? Having traveled to many places in the world, bland is sometimes good. Herbs and spices are not meant to overpower the food. This recipe is simple and easy to make.

Delicious, nice and light. I doubled the red pepper flakes, used regular breadcrumbs and less parsley, and served over couscous.

I sometimes wonder who reviews these recipes. Not trying to insult anyone here, but have you ever had a decent dish? This is not very good..Bland for my tastes.I guess if your a chain restuarant fan you might like this.

I agree with the others. This was very tasty, but not outstanding. I Served it with garlic toasts as a starter. I will plan to make this again, but may kick up the red pepper a bit.

We liked this. Not extraordinary but easy and tasty. Solid recipe. We served it as a first course with some sauvignon blanc. Polenta sounds like a great idea thanks for the tip!

I JUST made this and its SO good!! I was fumbling around the cupboards and I realized I had almost nothing to eat except for shrimp in the freezer... I have panko on hand and some leftover white wine, and a lime so this worked out perfectly... heck YES I'd make this again!
