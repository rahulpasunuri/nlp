This is an excellent stew! Like everyone else, the recipe served as a launching pad for my own creativity. I browned the pork stew meat after dredging in seasoned (S&P) flour and added Yukon Gold pots and carrots. Everything went into the crock pot. Had to add extra chicken broth and therefore more seasonings. Also added 1 cup cooked barley (cooked in broth). Excellent & will definitely make again. Oh...took one users advice and added a teaspoon of maple syrup and a bit of cayenne - great touches!

Delicious! I had some thick, bone-in chops I needed to use but wasn't in the mood to make or eat pork chops. I cubed the meat from the chops for this recipe. I coated the cubes in seasoned flour and browned them well in batches. Deglazed the pot with the wine before adding the onions/sage/garlic. Served over egg noodles. It was exactly what we were in the mood for -- a deep, rich, hearty meat ragu. The allspice added a really interesting, subtle note. I think the browning/deglazing is key -- the fond adds so much depth to the dish. It takes a little longer to season the meat and really brown it well, but totally worth it, and still an easy meal. Will definitely make this again this winter!

Comforting and homey. I took several reviewers' suggestions: dredged pork in flour+paprika+salt&pepper and added a bay leaf, a teaspoon of cumin and one of coriander. I also added carrots and potatoes to make it a one-pot meal. Delicious!

I made this the other night for the second time and it's great. I forgot to follow the comments as last time about flouring and browning the meat, but I cut up pork sirloin cutlets, rather than pork stew meat so it was very tender and tasty anyway. I added an extra tablespoon of tomato paste as others did. I believe last time I left out the allspice, afraid it would take over the taste of the sauce. This time I included and am glad I did - it really added a nice touch and gave it that comfort kind of feel! Served with white rice - perfect!

Very easy to make! I took some previous suggestions and dredged the pork chunks in seasoned flour (salt, pepper, paprika), and browned it. I didn't have any allspice, and the dish didn't miss it - I did use about 2 tbsp of herbs de provence, and an extra spoonful of chicken "better than boullion" without which I think the dish might have been a little bland. A very versatile dish that can be adapted any number of cuisines - you could kick it up with roasted peppers, chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, corn or hominy...or roasted peppers and sundried tomatoes...

I fused "Country Stew" with 'Pork Stew with Fennel and Butternut Squash" , 1/2003. I used 4 1" thick loin chops, cubed, dredged in flour w/ s&p and 1/4 t. ground allspice. Sauté in o.o., remove from pan; sauté chopped large onion w/ lots of garlic and lots of thinly sliced fresh sage. Add 1 3/4 c chicken broth, 2 T tom. paste, glass of dry rosé 'cause that's what was open. Add cubed butternut squash, 1 1/2 - 2lbs., and a 1 lb bag baby lima beans. Add a sprinkle of cayenne. Thicken w/ dredging flour in 1/4 c chicken broth. correct seasoning. Really good with crunchy French bread and some nice red wine.

I made this in the pressure cooker and it came out good, but not exceptional. I give it 3 forks because it was easy, and it has a lot of potential to be great with some tweaking.

This is a family favorite! We make it over and over... I was reading other's reviews and noticed comments about potatoes and carrots.. I've never added them, I had never seen that bit...

I never rview a recipe unless I followed it exactly but I'm making an exception since what I changed was so minor. I thought I had allspice but when I looked for it , I had none. Since the flavor of allspice is similar to quartre epice, I used a healthy sprinkling of that. The flavor was so good and the sauce thickened nicely when it was finished. I buy whole pork loins and cut into roasts and chops. I use the pointy end for cubes. There is just enough fat at that end to make the meat meltingly tender when braising. Delicious , a real keeper , if you chose the right cut of meat.

This recipe is very flavorful if you remember your grandmother's stew tips: 1. Dredge the stew meat in seasoned flour before browning. I used salt, pepper, dried sage and allspice to compliment the recipe. 2. Brown meat in 2 or 3 batches and don't rush it. Let each piece of meat brown thoroughly on all sides. The more you allow your meat to brown, the more flavorful your stew will be. 3. Heat your broth before adding it to the stew. As another reviewer pointed out cold broth + hot meat = tough stew meat. I also added carrots and potatoes in the last half hour and sliced granny smith apples in the final 15 minutes. Delicious.

I loved it and so did my family. I added lots of winter veggies, rutabegas, carrots, parsnips, turnips and potatoes. More broth is necessary and I added a heaping spoon of better than bullion chicken flavor. Awesome!!! also added a little maple syrup and a touch of cayene....amazing I promise.

Great for a chilly evening. I added a smidge of cumin and coriander, and doubled the allspice. I used a whole can of tomato paster, as well as a can of beef consomme to make it richer. Some potatoes added at the last half hour, and served over wide noodles. Yum!

I used this recipe as a springboard. Like the past reviewer from Cypress TX, I used country-style ribs and dredged them in seasoned flour; then I browned them in batches like I do beef stew meat. After taking out the meat, I sauted equal amounts of onion and red bell pepper, seasoning the mixture with salt and pepper before adding 3 crushed garlic cloves to the pot--I like the flavor but also need to watch the dragon breath factor. After returning the pork to the pot and deglazing with white wine, I used warmed up broth because sometimes cold broth+hot stew meat=tough meat. Then took inspiration from one of Rachael Ray's stews and supplemented the sage with 1-2 tbs paprika, 1 tsp each of cumin and coriander, and double the amount of tomato paste. At the end, I tasted for seasoning, added a bit more salt and pepper, and then finished it off with a pinch of cinnamon (no allspice). My husband liked it a lot, and usually he's skeptical about dishes the first time they appear at the dinner table. It will be reappearing at the dinner table this winter.

I agree with the last reviewer - not sure why this is so well regarded. It is bland, boring, and dare I say a waste of time and ingredients.

Not sure what all the hoopla is about. This was one of the most bland stews I've ever made; the layers of sage and allspice..garlic didn't come through as expected. I threw in a cup of frozen peas for color. Could it have been I cut meat from pork ribs as the market had no "stew pork"? Served over egg noodles was certainly a comfort meal on a cold night but didn't meet the mark. Husband liked it but then anything with "meat and gravy" is a treat for him!

This stew was flavorful and super easy. I, too, dusted the pork in seasoned flour before cooking. We ate 1/2 batch that night and froze the other half; it was easy to reheat and even better a week later. Next time I will make it with fresh sage.

I seem to modify every recipe I review, so here I go again! I used no olive oil, and Pammed the pot instead allowing it to get very brown while browning the pork(picnic shoulder cut into cubes). Then added a large Tbsp. butter and caramelized the onions and garlic. Deglazed the pot with wine, added meat, tomato paste, chicken broth, carrots and mushrooms and upped the allspice and sage. At the end I threw in 1/2 cup of frozen peas and for more sauce, I added more chicken broth. I served this over couscous and my family simply devoured it. Definitely a keeper!

I actually put all the ingredients in the crock pot on low all day. I added more garlic and used Chile Verde pork meat instead of stewing cubes (that's what I had). I served over Barley and with Jalapeno bread. My husband liked it!

This recipe is the very best I have found for stewed meat. I used oragano, chili powder, sage, and parsley. I added lots more garlic, sweet red pepper, and onion. You really do not have to change the base of the recipe. I will add tomatoes, new potatoes, and carrots next time. I live in the United States Virgin Islands where stewed meats are found everywhere. Now I can make stewed meat myself. This recipe is fast and easy so it is a great work day meal to serve. I jotted this recipe down in my journal.

My family thought was only ok. Added vegetables 1/2 way through cooking and texture was fine, but overall only ok. Maybe it was the meat. I used stewing pork cubes. Perhaps with a better cut of meat.

Quite good. Changes I made: added carrots midway through cooking; substituted extra broth for wine (didn't have); increased olive oil a little; added 1 extra Tablespoon tomato paste; used low sodium chix broth (couldn't find unsalted, but might be worth trying next time esp. if add wine). Beware of reducing so much that you don't have much gravy/sauce left at end. I had to add some HP sauce and water because I had no sauce left. At end I "shredded" the pork a little by hand and served over mashed potatoes w/prosciutto and parmesan (this site). This dish was popular with the guys.

So nice to find a real "comfort food" dish that's so easy to prepare. I too dredged the pork in seasoned flour prior to searing; kept it very tender. I used the boneless country style ribs and was pleased with the ease of prep. Didn't have fresh sage, so substituted dried and the flavor just didn't come through. I'll use fresh next time. Also increased both the tomato paste and the allspice - 1/4 teaspoon? Who'd be able to taste that? Served it over egg noodles as suggested by another reviewer, and loved it. Definitely a keeper.

Hearty and yummy on a cold and blustery night. I also coated with flour and browned the pork. Caramelized onions and shallots, then added mushrooms. Deglazed with wine. Put the rest of the ingredients in (and carrots) and kept tasting. Added quite a bit more sage and salt and pepper. Served over mashed potatoes -- will have leftovers with couscous. Will definitely make again.

This was great! Dusted pork cubes with Wondra flour and seasoned with salt and pepper before browning. Used dried sage...2 teaspoons. One teaspoon would have been enough, or maybe dried rosemary. Deglazed the pan with the wine before adding the rest of the ingredients and cooked partially covered. I loved the addition of the allspice and tomato paste! I also added 2 thick sliced carrots to the onion and garlic and added 3/4 cup peas off heat. We served over egg noodles. A definite keeper!

I love this site - the feedback from other cooks is so incredibly helpful. Here's my twist: I used pork tenderloin rather than stew meat, 1.25 T of dried sage rather than fresh, 1/2 cinnamon stick, 2 T of unsalted butter, 2 carrots - peeled and cut on a diagonal, fresh ground pepper, 6 pinches of sea salt and served over noodles. It was delicious and easy. Enjoy.

To Northern NJ. It is absolutely critical that you brown any meat in a pan that is NOT non stick. You will never get the good brown bits or quick even browning in any non stick coated pan! Hope this helps.

This was tasty enough and very simple, but I think I was hoping it'd be spicier, especially because the smell in the kitchen was SOOOO good while it was cooking. I'll play around with the recipe next time and see what I can come up with. I served it over brown rice with broccolini on the side and that made a nice little weeknight dinner to take to work with me ...

I read the reviews before making this receipe as I pondered about the sage and the allspice. I cubed the meat and the browning process (I did not flour it) was not browning at all. I used homemade tomato sauce instead of paste and I added the fresh thyme as others had suggested. The fresh sage needed to be supplemented with some quality dried rubbed sage so I reall don't see the need for the expense of the fresh herb. After we ate it andI thought about it, it should have been called the pork stew and kitchen sink with all of our ideas because most that have done this receipe have added their own thoughts and cleverness to it. As written, I wasn't impressed. As modified by myself and others, it works to one's individual tastes. I personally added cabbage in the final 30 minutes. Tasty, but not a wow.

Good dish for a cold rainy night. I doubled the meat, dredged the pork cubes in seasoned flour, doubled the garlic, and the chicken broth but not the allspice, and served with orzo. Also baked in the oven till tender which only took 1 hour. This is a keeper.

Nice, simple recipe! I dredged pork tenderloin in flour, browned, browned vegetables, making the added sauce in the dutch oven. Only change I made, was to use diced yams instead of potatoes, which did not detract from the nice flavor of the sauce, and I used beef broth, as I did not have chicken...I did double the garlic, and added white pepper (1/4 tsp.)put in a large cassarole dish with the sauce, and baked it for 1 1/2 hrs... very nice! I would definitely make this again, and this would be an easy and wonderful potluck take-along... I might try red wine next time.

I added some sliced carrots and cooked the stew in the oven (300 degrees for 1 1/2 hrs) rather than on the stovetop. I had plenty of gravy--and only used the amount of liquid called for in the recipe. I suspect my use of a dutch oven with a HEAVY, tight fitting lid (Le Creuset) probably helped to conserve the liquids. In fact, it was such a juicy stew that I decided to serve it with spaetzle--which was a great match. Delicious!

Thanks to prior reviewers for the suggestions on additions to this recipe. I added a number of vegetables that I wanted to clean out of my frig--carrots, celery, frozen peas and corn. Didn't have any tomato paste, so I used some seasoned diced tomatoes instead. Also didn't want to open a bottle of wine for such a small amount, so I used some orange juice in its place. Used both fresh sage and thyme. The product was a delicious, hearty stew, which I served over some brown rice. Just the comfort food for the first chilly Michigan evening. Next time, I think I'll use a cinammon stick instead of the allspice to see how that tastes. This is a great base recipe for experimenting!

This is a great dish. Because it's a stew, adding carrots, potatoes and green beans sounds great to me. Even though it was 105 degrees here today, I still heated up the house to make a great dinner! The dish itself is a low cal dish, but from all the reveiws I read, everyone changed it up; so I pumped it up my way. I coated the pork with a seasoned flour mixture, and continued on with the recipe. I added 1/2 cup small dice celery and doubled the garlic (pressed). I used 2 1/2 cups chicken broth, 1 small can tomato paste, and added 1 14-oz can diced tomatoes. A 1/2 hour before adding the veggies to the stew, I sauted the carrots and potatoes in 2 TBLS olive oil and 1 TBLS butter in another pan until crisp. I served it with a great crusty french bread and the reveiws from the peanut gallery were "stand-out!" I think this is a great recipe and I'm keeping it in my repertoire. Like I said, it's meant to be a low cal dish, so don't pump it up if you can't afford the calories.

Potatoes dumb-down the flavor. Made this the other night and added the recommended carrots and potatoes. The stew tasted so fresh and vibrant-- until I added potatoes which made it bland.

It appears as a simple dish, but there's depth in its flavor. I substituted 1/2 tablespoon dried crushed marjoram for the sage, and used both pork and beef stew meat. The aroma of the marjoram and meat is intoxicating. I added whatever I normally used for my stews: carrots, bay leaf, 2 whole cloves. I sauteed the onions and carrots in a bit of seasoned cornstarch mixture before adding it to the stew.

This dish is wonderful, but I must admit that I liked my substitutions. First, I de-glazed the pan with box of juice -- white grape/raspberry flavor. (I don't like the taste of wine in food.) This added a delicious fruity flavor. Second, I added a cubed yam. This enhanced the flavor and added much needed color and texture. The end result was very tender, sweet, and flavorful. It was great over flat noodles.

Really delicious and requires very little effort. Much more flavorful than I expected. Like most other reviewers, I just threw in what I had on hand (potatoes, carrots, thyme, and in the last 5 minutes a handful of cherry tomatoes).

I made this tonight, and improvised a bit. My hubby gave it a 4+ fork rating. I used 2 lbs. of cut up pork stew meat. Dredged it in flour w/ SAZON COMPLETA & salt. After browning the meat, I removed it to a bowl, I then added 3 chopped onions w/ about 6 cloves of minced garlic, w/ dried sage & thyme. I DID have to add more olive oil. After browning, I removed the onions etc., and deglazed the pan w/ about 1 cup dry white wine. Then add the pork w/ the onions/garlic. I added 3 cans of fat free & reduced sodium chicken broth, w/ garlic powder, and more thyme and sage (dried). I then added a small can of tomatoe paste. Then added 1 LARGE sweet potatoe (peeled and diced). I did have to add extra garlic powder, and an extra bit of dried sage and thyme. I let it cook on med. for about 1 hour (I did have to add an extra splash of white wine to taste). I did add a smidge of allspice, and a dash of cumin. At the end, I added orzo to thicken it up. We added a smidge of fresh ground pepper. My hubby ate two big bowls, and ate it w/ crusty buttered bread. I was gonna add frozen green beans, carrots and peas- but had no room!! He said he would give it it 10 forks up if possible! ia My hubby said he'd give it 10 forks if possible! He liked it w/ toasted,buttered bread. YUM YUM!

This stew was delicious! The flavor is impressive considering the ease of the recipe. I made a few minor amendments. I used loin chops which I tenderized well before drudging them in salted flour, as recommended by other reviewers. Before I grilled the onion/garlic/sage the pan needed a bit more olive oil. I increased the broth by about 3/4 cup, and added 1/4 teaspoon cumin. I added 2 cubed Russet potatoes and carrots and green beans for color. I also added salt. We served it with orzo but I think next time I'll use spaetzel. This pork stew successfully warmed my belly on a cold Nov. night. Enjoy!

The kids and my husband really enjoyed this one. I used pork sirloin and browned it with flour. After cooking the onions, I removed them and deglazed the pot with white wine, mostly because I wanted to make sure the sauce was a rich color. I used a bit more chicken broth so that there would be plenty of liquid and added one, cubed potato as another reviewer suggested. I also used Heinz ketchup because I didn't have tomato paste. It was easy and delicious.

The best pork stew ever!! Made the recipe as directed with only a few changes: first, I used just two shakes from my allspice container (husband doesn't much care for it), I substituted two chipotle peppers, and as much adobo sauce as I could scrape out of the can (reserving the remaining chipotles for some other chili or stew some other day), and I dusted the pork with flour before browning, as others suggested. Served with a french loaf and a zinfandel. Tasted very complex - no one would guess there are only nine ingredients and about 20 minutes of prep time. My husband and I are both amazed at how rich and satisfying this is. We will be making this a LOT. This is a not-to-be missed recipe, and is definitely company worthy. Am I raving? Yes. Is it worth it, in my opinion. Oh yeah.

This recipe is a good example of why I love Epicurious! If you have a few ingredients on hand that you want to use, you can search the site (in this case I had a huge, double-thick pork chop and searched for "pork stew). I cut it in cubes, tossed it in salt, pepper and flour and browned on all sides in garlic flavored olive oil. Then removed it, and sauteed a chopped onion. Deglazed with lots of white wine, added a half cup or so of chunky salsa, some chicken broth, small cubes of potatoes, cumin, sliced olives and some very hot sauce to taste. then simmered for an hour or so. All the ingredients were just sitting around in my pantry or fridge waiting to be used, and I just tossed in what sounded good to me at the time (I like things really spicy!) I served it over rice with a hearty bottle of Australian Shiraz (Leasingham Bin 61) Delicious!

This is an excellent pork stew for beginners recipe. It's very simple, but it needs a little help. First, I had to add about a 1/2 cup of water to the recipe. Next, I added Sweet potatoes (about 3 medium-cut & cubed) and let them simmer for the full hour. I also added about 8 ounces of frozen peas about 10 minutes before the strew was done. This is a great recipe for experimenting and developing your own flavor.
