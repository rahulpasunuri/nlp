Wow... this tart is one of the best desserts I have ever made-- or had for that matter. The pastry crust is delicious (and I thought very easy to put together using the food processor). I did replace the walnuts with pecans as my husband loves pecan pie so wanted to do a variation of that. I took anther reviewer's advice and replaced the corn syrup with maple syrup-- that was a genius suggestion! The maple, pecan and tart cranberry with flaky, buttery crust was divine and will be something I make often this fall/winter. I used mini tart pans and topped with homemade vanilla bourbon ice cream.

This recipe is just fantastic. It was delicious and beautiful. Everyone loved it who tried it! I had trouble with the crust but will review that separately.

A big hit with everyone. Essentially a classic pecan pie recipe with walnuts and cranberries. I roasted walnuts first for more flavor. I kept some berries and walnuts whole and coated them with the filling liquid and arranged them on top of tart before baking. Also used a rectangular tart pan, presented on rectangle tray decorated with springs of rosemary.

I've been making this tart every Thanksgiving and Christmas since it was first published. I have used walnuts, but prefer pecans. I double the crust and make it in 2 shallow 1" deep tart pans instead of one deep pan. The cooking time is a little less this way - you just have to keep an eye on it and take it out when it's done in the center. I get raves every time and there are never leftovers.

Amazing! The only thing I don't like about pecan pie is how it often seems like 'goo pie' with a layer of pecans at the top....putting it in a tart makes it all good. I added an extra half cup of walnuts, but it would have been fine without it. I also used Lyle's Golden Syrup because I don't like to use corn syrup.

This is a family favorite..my son's ask for it for birthdays, Christmas, you name it. I substitute maple syrup for the corn syrup. Yum!

I have also been making this tart, since it was first published. I use pecans, instead of the walnuts, and it has always been a hit. Coming back to print out the recipe for this Thanksgiving.

I have made this recipe several times, but use pecans, instead of walnuts. It is always a hit.

this tart is easy and it was gobbled up; pronounced my "best tart ever" by close friends who are my test-group. I served it with the cranberry sorbet in little glasses; very pretty. I think its the sort of tart you want to have with ice cream or sorbet as the flavours are sharp (but exciting); I'd also go with ginger, cinnamon or vanilla ice cream next time.

I made this for Thansgiving dessert and it was fabulous! A bit putzy to make, but worth it!

This is a handsome tart and easy to prepare but I was disappointed, based on the glowing words of other reviewers, so want to add a dissenting voice. I was expecting more from the cranberries. This seemed to me just a sweet nut pie, sort of a thin classy version of pecan pie.

I've used the filling in my own sweet crust tart shells, and it is wonderful. It is possible to use frozen cranberries, if you chop them in the food processor immediately before you add them to the filling (don't let it stand around, though, put it right into the oven). There's nothing like taking a bite of the crunchy walnuts and sweet (but not very sweet) filling and getting a little zing from the cranberries. Glazed with a little apricot jam to make it glow, it looks great on the table, too!

I always make this a Thanksgiving and now teaching my 8-year daughter as a family tradition. The combination of nuts and cranberries is a perfect not-so-sweet dessert.

I've been making this since it was first published back in '91 & it has been a big hit, perfect for those who don't like things too sweet. The crust is easy to work with & very forgiving. (I always use the food processor so it's a snap. For everyone who's looking for make ahead holiday fare, this freezes beautifully. Tried something different this year and used a shallow mini-muffin tin to make tartletts. Made two minor tweaks, chopped the nuts & cranberries very fine & instead of blind baking the crust I just filled them & baked at 425. Again the results were superb!
