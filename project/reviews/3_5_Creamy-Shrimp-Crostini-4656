loved the flavors -- didn't change a thing

I have made this recipe more than 5 times and people now ask me to please bring it when I come over! I did change it due to the cost of shrimp recently. I substituted 4 cans (16 oz) of baby shrimp (drained and rinsed) in the recipe and then used a single whole shrimp on the top of each and garnished with fresh dill!

I was a bit worried after reading other peoples thoughts about this being too bland. I substituted a spicy brown mustard, left out the dill and green onions, added Chile Habanero Hot sauce to taste and served it warm on the crostini. My boyfriend gave it a solid "A". We served it to friends who devoured it. Will absolutely make it again- so easy. Enjoy!

This recipe is simple and delicious. I would also suggest only half the amount of mayo called for here. Also, I used light cream cheese and light mayo, and dried dill instead of fresh, which may help a few who found it too overpowering. We had technical difficulties with the broiler, so I simply took them off the pan and served them cold--crisis easily averted. The guests loved them--every single one commented.

You have to like dill. It was good, but I've had better shrimp appetizers. More than likley, I will not make again.

I make this whenever I'm asked to bring an appetizer. It's easy to make ahead - a real time saver. Best of all it tastes AWESOME! Everyone loves it. I highly recommend this recipe.

Delicious! I received rave reviews and my doubled recipe was gone in about 10 minutes. I added extra dill and lemon and reduced the amount of mayo just so there was more shrimp flavor. Top each one with a salad shrimp and a bit of dill. YUM!

I thought this was terrible. Dull and bland. I would recommend the crab with dill on cayenne toasts - a much better choice.

This is one of my favorite recipes to bring to parties. Everyone loves them and they're very easy.

I loved this one! It was the dill and the lemon peel that made this appetizer a fresh and flavorful appetizer that I will definitely serve again.

i'm surprised that someone thought this was bland (although i tend to be heavy handed with the lemon, dill & pepper). this is always a huge hit when i make it - it doesn't even need to be on crostini & toasted. i've used it just as a dip.

Although tasty, the dish was too bland. I feel the shrimp needed some zip or oomph. Might play with it to get a spicier shrimp salad.

I have made this more times than I can count. Everyone loves it and asks for the recipe. I don't usually care for shrimp but this is amazing!

I agreed with the reviewer that thought the recipe was a little boring. It tasted like something a beginning cook would make. I think the combination of mayo and cream cheese puts it in that "pedestrian" category. I used Creole mustard for a little zing and deleted the dill. It was only "OK."

Wonderful and tasty. Very easy to make and looks complicated and gourmet (ish). This will be my new favorite appetizer.

This is my absolute standby for parties. I have not found a person yet that does not love these crostini!

Iwould use so much mayo, lower the dill but wouldn't take it out completly, and put a little cayene pepper. Great. We liked them hot better.

This dish was very simple with a lot of flavor. I used melba toasts which made assembly very easy. I definately preferred the warm version over the cold version. A keeper!

I loved the lemon zest(I used almost an entire lemon and it wasn't too powerful) and used LOTS of dill weed. Plus I added some garlic powder, lemon pepper and chili pwdr and cayenne for a bite. It was VERY good on toasts, and I do want to stuff some seafood like someone mentioned. Very yummy! Also, I added shredded romano and it wasn't too over powering, but it did help to bind it together. Next time I'd cut the mayo in half. Enjoy!!!

A friend suggested this recipe when I was having a Sex and the City cocktail party. It was a big hit. As soon as I put more crostinis down they were gone! IT's now my party staple. One suggestion though, I decrease the mayo (I actually use Mexican crema) and add just a bit of cocktail sauce. I also would omit the dill.

This is a terrific appetizer. Ifirst made it around the holidays; my husband and I became rather addicted and added to those holiday pounds! I now use lite cream cheese and lite mayonnaise and it's still wonderful. Like another reviewer, I also delete the dill. Most recently I used the topping as the base for stuffing a whole red snapper: Minced the shrimp before very lightly cooking in a little wine; added a little bit of fresh bread crumbs for body. Then baked the fish. Fantastic!

Easy, elegant, and a big hit with our guests. I spray the baguette slices with olice oil spray to cut back on the oil & save time. This is an excellent choice for entertaining.

This recipe has potential. I found the zest and dill to be quite overpowering. The next time I make this, I will omit the dill, try using lemon juice instead of zest, and add a dash of Worcestershire and maybe some sliced almonds on top-- I think they'd brown quite nicely under the broiler.

These were the best liked of all the appetizers I made for 4th of July! The only thing I changed was adding more Dijon. Loved the dill and so did everyone else! Prepared the night before (kept the crostinis in an air tight container) and I think that probably helps the flavor meld. Simple and delicious! KIMBER

Excellent! I did cut down on the dill. It was a pretty presentation with lots of dill garnish.

Excellent dish for parties. Quick and easy to make. I made it the night before and toasted the bread the night of, all worked out well. Highly recommend less dill. A tad much for my taste.

well my husband liked it, but he likes almost everything, my two kids and I didnt like it at all, if i ever made it again i would leave out the dill, was to over powering i thought.

I followed the recipe as written (unusual for me) and it was a winner!!!! Made as "nibblies" with drinks before Christmas dinner. Had three requests for the recipe!

This recipe was a hit with my monthly dinner group! Every last one was gone. I browned them well (golden brown, that is--not burnt!) and they were delicious.

Nothing is really wrong with this dish, I just think it's very boring. If I made it again I would use less mayo - that flavor was too strong. I served these to guests as a before dinner appetizer and about a third were still left when it was time to sit at the table. Just ok.

A definite keeper! My guests couldn't get enough of these tasty morsels. I made the topping a day ahead and the flavours melded together wonderfully.

Yummy! Yummy! This recipe is absolutely delicious! Everyone at the dinner party gave it rave reviews. I recommend serving it hot, I think the flavours are brought out more. A definite keeper!

What a great versatile appetizer. I have served it hot and cold and both are great. I definitely think it is better if made to sit over night as it gets its full flavor. A great fresh tasting blend of flavors. I would like to try this ommitting the cream cheese and adding some lobster meat for a lobster salad. I bet it would be delish!

Absolutely delicious! I substitute a teaspoon of chopped fresh tarragon for the dill and use French tarragon mustard in place of the dijon. Totally fantastic! If you like shrimp you'll love this one.

Excellent and easy dish - I suggest that you let it sit in the fridge overnight in order to get the best taste. I served it cold, and everyone loved it. Doubles well for shrimp salad sandwiches if you have any leftovers!

Back on our restaurant menu due to popular demand. We omit the herbs and add roasted garlic instead, garnished with a boiled shrimp. Easy to do, impossible to mess up.

This is a superior appetizer! I have made it several times and have rave reviews. Easy and elegant appetizer that will impress all guests.
