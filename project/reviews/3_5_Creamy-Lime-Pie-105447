I've never tried a Rick Bayless recipe I didn't like. Many travels to Mexico and his recipes always taste authentic!

I agree this pie takes much longer to bake and set up than the recipe states. But it's worth it. My client and her guests loved it.

What a fabulous dessert! It has a much more subtle flavor than your typical lime pie, which I really liked. I had a little trouble with it setting up but it was still a hit! I plan to make it again this weekend.

I have never been a big fan of lime pies but this flavor is quite subtle yet linguring. I will make this again and again.

Delicious and unique. The crust was a little more complicated than traditional pie crust, but the flavor enhanced the filling. I didn't make the crimson prickly pear sauce this time, served the pie without and we still loved it. I don't agree with the cook from Mankato, this pie was not at all eggy. Creamy Lime Pie will become a standard at our house.

I have made many pies, and this is a decent lime pie, but it is not the end-all. I tend to search for perfection, and for a lime pie, this was only as tasty as your traditional "persian lime/condensed milk key lime pie recipe. It is different in that the longer baking time of this pie keeps it from being "creamy" and smooth(the "cream" in the title must refer to the ingredient). It was a little eggy for my taste, not quite enough lime flavor, and the texture was almost quiche-like. If you're easier to please, it's definitely good enough. But I'm still searching!

I cheated and used a frozen pie crust. The filling is SOOOO good. I've made it twice in 3 weeks. It's also good cold so don't fret if you can't make and serve warm.

This lime pie puts any key lime pie you can imagine to shame -- it is simply divine.
