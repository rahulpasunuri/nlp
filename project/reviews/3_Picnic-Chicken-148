I used chicken breasts cut into bite-sized pieces and I thought the recipe worked well. If you are tying to cut your fat and carbs, this is an excellent choice and makes a great snack food. One note, I didn't have marjoram on hand so used oregano which also worked well.

This is a waste of time and money given today's store bought rotissere chickens. Roasting chickens cost $7/8 and cook to a rubbery texture. Lemon marinade tasted awful. Also spent $4 for 'summer savory' which I'll never use again!

This is the best chicken recipe I have tried in a long time. I came out moist and the flavor was spectacular. I am thinking of making it for my daughter's wedding.

Fantastic chicken! Very moist and favorable. I used whole cut-up chicken, marinated, then grilled. So easy and so good.

To the cook who was worried about basting with the chicken marinade...salmonella is killed at 137F. The heat from the roasting chicken would kill the bacteria. Or if you are not comfortable doing that...you could boil the marinade for a few minutes to destroy any pathogens that might be present.

We were disappointed. The flavor was quite good but the chicken was rubbery, although I used a cooking thermometer to make certain it was completely done. I don't know whether to blame this on the chicken or the recipe...so I might try it again.........

I would never make this chicken, according to the recipe, because you should NEVER baste with chicken marinade unless you reserved it BEFORE putting raw chicken in it. Basting with marinade that's had chicken soaking in it could cause salmonella poisoning.

Very good idea for a delicious picnic

I didn't find this any more interesting than a typical roasted chicken (with an olive oil rub and lots of herbs and garlic piled on). Anyway, I made a Kiwi-Lime-currents-green onion relish to serve on the side, which added interest.

Very tasty, but how do you get a 4.5 to 5 pound whole chicken to roast in only one hour twenty minutes? Two hours twenty minutes, maybe? Bird would only be at about 130 degees in 1 hour 20 minutes. Good neighbor Sam could come and vist at that low temperature.

Just the way a picnic dish should be - EASY. Prepare the day before, and quick baking the day of. It is great cold or hot. The lemon juice really plumps the chicken up and makes for a great moist and lemony taste. I prepare it all the time for outdoor concerts and theatre.
