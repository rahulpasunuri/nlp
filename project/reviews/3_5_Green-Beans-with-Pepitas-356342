This was so simple and so very delicious! I used pepitas from Trader Joe's and also frozen haricots vert from TJ's, as well. It was so good that I'm going to put it on this Thanksgiving's menu. Delicious and lo cal--what's not to like??!!

I made these to accompany the chiptole glazed roasted salmon with hominy puree and it was a terrific combo. I will be making these again!

I've now made this recipe twice and brought it as a side for holiday family dinner. Quite easy to make beforehand and reheat. I really liked the combination of rosemary and garlic with the beans. As for finding shelled pepitas: Do NOT attempt to shell them yourself; you'll be doing it forever! I live near many latino groceries and could not find them shelled. However, they are available in the baking aisle at Whole Foods, labeled pumpkin seeds, with other nuts and things.

LOL! Jon you cracked me up. Go to a Mexican grocery store and get shelled pepitas. They maybe in the snack food isle. Still laughing.

I have been cooking internet recipes for several years now and once in awhile you run across a recipe that makes you seriously wonder how the heck it could POSSIBLY have gotten such good reviews. First of all, anyone who has eaten pumpkin seeds know that they are VERY difficult to chew and sort of break up into an unpleasant fiber in your mouth. Well surprise surprise that exactly what happened here. Each bit sort of crunches in an unpleasant way and then down the green beans go but there you are left chewing pumpkin seed fiber. I'm telling you I made it EXACTLY as it says and no one in my family liked it. I can usually tell when a dish is bad because I prepared it wrong, as opposed to just being a 'bad' recipe and I'm telling you it was cooked perfectly. Course that's just my opinion (and the opinion of my wife and step daughter). If you're not a big fan of flavor and like chewing until your jaw hurts this may be right up your alley. Stay away from this one.

These were so delicious and easy. A nice change from "normal" green beans but still quick to prepare. We served them with the pork tenderloins with prune and adobo chile sauce from the Sept 2009 issue. Delicious!

even better with some leeks added in...

Big hit at Christmas! Will make again. Substituted almonds for pepitas as none could be found in the UP...

Wow! Even my four-year old loved this recipe and ate all her green beans...then asked for more! Everyone raved about this one. Perfect as is.

I'm not much of a cook, but this recipe turned out great even for me. It's a definite keeper. Easy to make and very yummy. I intend to make it again soon.

I usually eat green beans more out of a sense of duty than because I especially like them, but these were exceptional. The crunch added by the pepitas, and the rosemary/garlic combo can't be beat. My new favorite green bean preparation.

My daughter and I love to make this recipe for company because it is so impressive, yet so easy. We make it even easier by using the tiny frozen haricot vert found in better grocery stores. No need to pre-cook the beans; simply add them to the hot oil and rosemary and cook until heated and a bit "roasted." Toss with the pepitas, and serve! Never any left!
