Yummy served with blanched green beans. Want to use the leftovers for pasta, kinda like a phad thai dish.

I have made this several times and use the recipe as written. Crowd pleaser as a dip for crudites, on leftover pasta, and it's also exceptional as a salad dressing!

I made this dip with natural peanut butter in spite of the warnings not to... and I didn't see any problem with doing so. I wouldn't call the texture "chunky" or "uneven," but it definitely wasn't silky smooth in the way that the more processed peanut butter would have made it. I did double the spices (just the curry and pepper, not the garlic and ginger) as recommended by other reviewers, and that seemed to be exactly right. I'm using some of the leftovers on buckwheat noodles for supper tonight!

Easy to make and tasty. I subsituted chicken broth with vegetable and it was fine. It went great with celery and soy 'chicken' strips.

It's a shame that one mustn't use freshly-ground peanuts for this recipe, as our family does not use commercial peanut butter because of the hydrogenated elements. Could anyone tell me the reason that it must be commercial- creamy instead of freshly-gound before I use up my supply of hard-to-get ingredients? Thanks!

I always forget how good this is until one day i go through my recipe box, and there it is, in all its goodness. The only thing I do differently is to throw it in the blender and smooth it all out before putting it in the fridge. Other than that, it is perfect...

I have made this dip time and time again and always get asked for the recipe. I serve it with red, yellow, orange and green pepper strips. YUM!

Its not that it was a lot of work, but for a dip it was a lot of work, and for me, it just didn't pay off. The basic flavor was peanut butter, like you were eating it out of the jar, with a hint of curry. Could use a little more "kick". Definitely needs to sit overnight to thicken back up and merge flavors (which I did). Out of an assortment of chips, veggies, crackers, nothing really seemed to go with it. It was edible, but I won't be making it again. Not one guest took note of it and most was left over the next day to be thrown out.

I think the dip was perfect as-is. I did let it sit overnight, and was well-received by both my co-workers and husband. I liked it as well!

Very nice flavor. However, next time I would double the spices, as they just weren't strong enough. I would leave out the brown sugar as the dip was too sweet, and I would reduce the broth as the dip was too thin. With a little tweaking, this would be perfect.

Loved it ... followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. However, I do think the recipe should call for at least 6 hours of sitting before serving, as it's really so much better after the flavors have time to combine a bit.

Awesome dip. A huge hit at cookout! Served with vegetable chips.

I enjoyed this dip. I made it for a potluck and served it with crudities and it made a hit. It wasn't as spicy as I expected, though, and next time, I'll probably boost the red pepper a smidge.

This is very similar to a soup recipe that I always get comments on - this just has less broth

Guys. B.A. ran another dip years ago. it's not on-line. Everytime i make it EVERYONE wants the recipe. You just throw everything into a processor - but I usually add a little more minced ginger for an added kick. 1 3/4 cups creamy peanut butter, 2 chopped med. onions., 6 minced garlic cloves, 6 Tbsp. fresh lemon joice, 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, 4 tsp. grated fresh ginger, 4 tsp. soy sauce, 2 tsp. dried red pepper flakes(start out w/1 tsp. then add to taste), 2 tsp. turmeric. May add a little water to thin dip.Serve with sliced jicama,snow peas,celery,carrots, chinese long beans. Bon Appetit!

I made this for an appetizer potluck party. I doubled the recipe, made it with veggie stock, made it the night before, but otherwise followed the recipe. It was fabulous. I almost didn't make it because of negative reviews of others. Wonderful flavor and nicely spiced. My teenaged daughters loved it as well. A definite keeper.

I've made this dish a few times. Love it. Second time I cut the lime in half. Next time I make this peanut dip I'm going to add more red pepper. It's funny: when my guests tasted this, the could place what flavors were included. Even so, they asked for a repeat of it later.

I made this recipe (with veggie broth) and thought it was pretty good, but it could have been spicier. I suggest adding a bit more ginger & red pepper flakes, maybe some salt, too. Overall, it was pretty good.

I made the dip for a brunch and it was a hit, everyone loved it. I think it's the curry that makes it so good. I highly recommend this recipe.

I think this dip is delicious, but its the kind of dip that you can't overdose on...I think its just too strong. Everytime I make it someone asks me for the recipe. BTW, I always use vegetable broth instead of chicken.

I and my five children have survived, and enjoyed; leg of goat, escargo, oysters on the half shell, bleu cheese and various root vegetables, etc... This I did not even ask them to taste, I threw it out before they needed counseling. Blehh!

This is one of the most delicious dips I've ever had! Served the dip with julienned carrots and red peppers as suggested by another reviewer - what was left of the dip, that is, after I got done "tasting" it in the kitchen!

I, too, used vegetable broth. I liked this dip and would make it again, but with one change: I would cut the amount of lime juice in half. I also thought it needed more salt. The chilling time is critical for flavors to blend.

I was pleased with the results. A used some onion instead of a shallot and used the dip with some veggies.

This is a great dip that is easy to make. I served it with jicama, baby carrots and red peppers. It is also great with Apples and Pears. I tripled it and used it at a reception where it received great reviews. Our family really liked it. Best if left to chill overnight but you can use within an hour of making it.

Great, easy dip, full of flavor. Only change was that I made it with vegetable broth instead of chicken stock for the vegetarians in the bunch, and it was fabulous.
