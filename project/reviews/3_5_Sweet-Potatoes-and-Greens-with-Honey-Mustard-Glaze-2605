i think it was too much Dijon. It got overwhelming.

Best use of Swiss chard that I have come across.

I've been making it since the year that it was published (1994) and we can't have Thanksgiving without it!

Husband said "This orange and green stuff is good, isn't it?" For a 'green leaf' hater, thats high compliment. My only change is that 3Tb of both seemed like too much glaze

I made this several years ago for Thanksgiving and now it's an annual request. I used kale instead of chard because that's what I had and now we always do it that way

I used a mix of leftover yams and butternut squash and it was fantastic! The squash probably cut the extra sweetness another cook complained about. It isn't the prettiest thing, and the kids were looking at it sideways, but I insisted, and even the picky little darlings loved it. Next Thanksgiving for sure; it's so EASY!!!

Delicious as written. An excellent complement to lamb chops and a nice departure from traditional sweet potato recipes.

Delicious, easy to make, and a healthy complement to the baby back ribs with soy orange glaze and some cornbread!

What went wrong? This was totally inedible. I followed the recipe exactly and even double checked the ingredients to make sure that I hadn't goofed. I have never been so disappointed with a recipe from Epicurious, in fact I've loved everything that I have found here. But this.... Yecch!

I made this with lamb chops (with a spice rub.) It was great. I did use baby spinach instead of chard.

Great taste, great texture, great colors. Use Trader Joes Rainbow chard mix if you are lucky enough to have one close by. It even has already prepped yams too!

A big hit last Thanksgiving. We are making it again this year. Don't change a thing.

I made this dish for our Christmas dinner. It was absolutely wonderful! I have been asked to make it again! It is delicious!

This dish received rave reviews when I first served it in 1994. Unfortunately, I lost the magazine it was in, and it was only when I became a member of Epicurious that I found it again! It will be a featured star of our Christmas feast this year - thank you so much! It is a simply wonderful side dish.

Simple and tasty. Definitely a keeper.

I didn't change anything and have made this dish several times with great responses. Unlike some others I thought this to be a tangy refreshing yam dish, not so candy sweet. We have been ask to make this for our Thanksgiving dinner, it was a real hit last year.

Very tasty!! I found the dish a little on the sweet side. Next time I will cut back on the honey by a tbsp. Otherwise excellent.

Easy to make, nice alternative to the marshmellow recipes.
