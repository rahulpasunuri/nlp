Used 2 cans cannellini beans rather than the butter beans - very smooth and tasty. Didn't add water - I think it would have been too gooey. Very nice and lemony. Needs a touch extra cumin and plenty of salt and pepper.

This was OK, but not that special.

I really liked this recipe, and have made it several times. I like the creamy and mild texture of the butter beans as opposed to a traditional hummus made from chick peas. I definately used less tahini that called for....I only used about 1/3 cup, and that was plenty. My guests really liked this one as well!

This recipe is ggod, it needs some "doctoring" to bmake it great, as previous reviewers have mentioned. I added about 1 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 teaspoon of tabasco, and an additional 1/2 teaspoon of cumin. Basically, this recipe gives you a blank canvas with which to start then you add what you like to make up the rest. Very versatile.

I agree with a previous reviewer who said 1 can butter beans, 1 can garbanzos. I also cut tha tahini down to a scant 1/2 cup. Last time I made thins, I added pureed chipotle peppers in adobo (4-- we like heat!) and.....mmmmm. fabulous.

The amount of tahini called for is out of proportion---it gives the dip as stickiness that runs counter to the beautiful creaminess of the butter beans. I'd use less tahini, and maybe use both raw and roasted garlic, to add back some of the flavor it would lose.

The middle ground is a good one to take here -- try 1 can chickpeas, 1 can butter beans. I have been experimenting with cannelini as the 2nd can, but the texture of this was dreamy. The Italians make a similar spread for bruschetta with fava beans, similar to butter beans. Yum! Nice alternative!

I have made this dip several times for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike, and it has always been a hit. It is a bit milder than regular garbanzo hummus, for those that do not like that distinctive flavor, but the cumin adds a flavorful component. I agree with the previous reviewer-- add more cumin.

Although the butter beans don't contribute the same nuttiness as the garbanzos - it is exceptionally creamy. In addition, the cumin adds another dimension of flavor not typically found in regular hummus. I added extra cumin and roasted garlic for more flavor.
