Pancake was really good, I will even try this in the winter with frozen peach slices. I usually stick to the recipe EXACTLY, but we had fresh, smashed raspberries on hand so we mixed those with real maple syrup and used instead of the cranberry compote. I think the tartness of the berries was a nice contrast. All in all, a very seasonal, yummy dinner for us.

Not enough caramel on the fruit. A little too eggy. I'd make it again, but more sugar in the skillet.

Came our exactly as pictured. Very good taste, eggy & fluffy. Peaches were nicely carmelized. The compote needed just a little something, though...maybe splash of Kirsch.
