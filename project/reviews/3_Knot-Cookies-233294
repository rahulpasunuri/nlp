Lovely to see ethnic cooking, especially my own heritage hit the recipe log. However good these are, this is the type of treat that needs a secret family recipe.

These were quite good, but not great.

Excellent recipe! My grandmother used to make them, too. They're easy to make and a wonderful treat!

I love these cookies. Maybe the reason for this is that I grew up on them. I am from Lithuania and my grandma used to make them with me all the time. I still make them now with my mom and bring them to my friends at school and they all love it. It's easy, quick, inexpensive, and you can add your own flavor to them. Hope you enjoy them as much as my family have for decades. =D
