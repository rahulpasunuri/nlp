My first time with quail eggs as well. I damaged quite a few while peeling them, but I found that the best way is to crack the shell all over so that it breaks into tiny pieces; this way the peel comes off more easily and you're less likely to damage the egg. I found the end result quite tasty, if a bit salty for my taste. I did not need more than twenty minutes to reduce the sauce (I put it on high at first so it began to boil vigorously and then lowered the heat). I didn't have any problem with the texture of the eggs. My little brother also liked the taste.

I give these a solid 'good'. This was my first time preparing 'Quail' eggs. The sauce took longer than 20 minutes to reduce down, so I removed the eggs from the sauce after 20 min. & continued to cook the sauce down by itself. The taste is nice & definitely Asian, it could take getting used to for a palate unused to Asian cuisine. I love many international cuisines so I found this taste pleasant. This was very easy & quick to make.

I wanted to rave about this recipe, but I have to knock it for the gummy texture of the egg whites. While I loved the soy stain and flavor, cooking down the liquid with the eggs just over cooks the whites to the point of almost inedible (yes, I'm a food snob when it comes to rubber whites). Will probably make again, but will need to figure out how to reduce the cooking time.

Taste was fine but not very appealing visually and the texture was off.

I fell in love with these as a vegetarian living in Korea. I would eat these with my lettuce wraps with grilled garlic, pickled onion and grilled mushrooms while everyone else was eating galbi. I have always wondered how to make these and this recipe brought me right back.
