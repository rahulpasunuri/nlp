This is awesome!! So easy- lots of flavor! Perfect mid-week meal. Made with cold Chinese noodles- from this site! Will make for guests next time.

This recipe was outstanding! I have been looking for low fat meals to prepare for the entire family and I hit the jackpot with this one.I lined the steamer with romaine leaves because that's what I had on hand. The only change I made was using Agave nectar in lieu of the sugar. It received a unanimous thumbs up from my family. It also made such a pretty presentation, I'm thinking of serving it for a luncheon I'm hosting.

This is an excellent recipe and nothing has to be changed. I used Chinese cabbage leaves on the bottom of my bamboo steamer and every one enjoyed the wonderful flavor it had from the sauce. The scrod was so flavorful and steaming gave it a wonderful texture. Easy, fast and a beautiful presentation, this is a keeper!
