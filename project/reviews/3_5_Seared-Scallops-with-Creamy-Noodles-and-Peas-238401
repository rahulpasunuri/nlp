Pretty good as long as you tweak a bit. I added quite a bit of garlic and minced shallots at the deglazing step and wouldn't want to be without them. At that point I also added a tiny amount of chili flakes - not essential but I found it gave the recipe a great warmth. I couldn't bear to use that much cream so used a quarter cup of cream and half a cup of milk. I didn't add the water but will next time. Didn't have any chives and didn't miss them.

Fairly tasteless. Don't waste your scallops on this one.

Something must be wrong with the way I prepared the "creamy" sauce. Threw the first batch of sauce away and tried again with similar results. The wine curdled my cream. Don't know what I was doing wrong, but the sauce wasn't super creamy and was petty much absorbed by the pasta. After reading the previous reviewers comments, I added grated parmesan and crushed red peppers. By the way, I did substitute 1/2 and 1/2 with the cream for a lighter touch. I love past recipes with simple ingredients, but I felt the sauce was lacking with something...

I've used hundreds of Epicurious recipes over the years, but I think this is the first I've felt compelled to log in and review. I started making this dish just over a month ago, and now I crave it on the regular. Like others have said, it's not what you want if you're looking for a cutting-edge, flavors-blasting dish, but this is weeknight comfort food bar none. I use a pound of scallops for this recipe, and frankly, would not suggest knocking yourself finding the best scallops in the world. Fresh bay scallops or frozen jumbo scallops work just fine, especially with a little Cajun/Creole seasoning before they're cooked. I also like to add about 1/4 teaspoon of smoked paprika to the dish at the cream stage and double the chives. Honestly, this is not anything that I'd ever make for a dinner party, but after a long day at work, it is as easy, comforting, and delicious as it gets. I wish I could give five forks.

I could NOT believe how bland and boring this turned out to be. Quite a disappointment after reading all the reviews...the noodles. The scallops turned out alright but I would never half them unless you had unexpected guests and need to stretch it out.

Add at least 1/4 teasp ground cayenne pepper to give it the kick it needs. I, too, added fresh garlic at the deglazing step. I didn't have chives on hand so I added some pesto from the tube, onion powder and parsley - worked well . After you doc it up - it becomes a 4 fork. Found that not enough sauce for 8oz pasta - if you like a looser sauce. May want to increase your cream - I used hald n half as that is what I had on hand. Looking forward to making it again with more cream & chives.

Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews so while it was good, it was a little bland. I would definitely add shallots to the scallops and garlic and red pepper next time. The scallops were very tasty and the shallots and cream would have been perfect.

I would have given 3 1/2 stars if they let me. This is a super-rich recipe, but it was perfect on New Year's Eve with champagne. I agree that you don't have to slice the scallops in half; I didn't bother because I like to see big, beautiful scallops on the plate! This was a husband-pleasing recipe!

Wow! Was this a hit! I read all the reviews and jazzed it up with garlic, red pepper flakes and shallots. I didn't add the water and didn't miss it, but it's a matter of how thick you want to make the sauce. I also didn't read about halving the scallops until after I served the dish, and would keep them whole again. I used quite large sea scallops and they were wonderful. I do think this is a dish to experiment with. Chicken and asparagus tips sound great with this sauce. And yes, I think the heavy cream is essential. Yummmm!!

Ooops, forgot to add that I used 1 lb of whole wheat pasta, 1 lb sea scallops, added two shallots, and creme fraiche instead of cream.

I added two minced shallots about two minutes before adding the scallops, as I figured the recipe would be dull, without it. Cream and shallots is a lovely combination. My entire family loved this recipe, as modified. Even those who had initially carped at including the peas.

A delicious, simple dish that focuses the attention where it should be: on the perfection of the scallops. Sure you could dress the recipe up, but with beautiful scallops as the star, it's really unnecessary. Everyone I've ever made this for has absolutely loved this dish, it's elegant comfort food.

I'm not even sure if I should give it one fork. Bland, Bland, Bland.

I made this as written except for adding just a touch of garlic. It was fantastic....looked great, smelled better and tasted terriffic. My husband says they don't supply enough forks to adequately rate this recipe.

It's a great basic recipe that begs for variations on the theme. The extra prep time of halving the scallops, and flipping twice as many scallops would make up for any cooking time saved - didn't do it. My scallops were big, fresh and sweet; the peas were fresh and sweet too. I varied the sauce by using the other viewer's suggestion and adding garlic - it was just what the sauce needed. I gilded the lily by swirling in a few bits of butter, one bit at a time. Finished it with a sprinkle of freshly ground white pepper. This recipe is a keeper.

I thought this was great and quick for the weeknight. I just added a shallot after deglazing the pan...I never notice chives other than color really. Great dish!!

Very good! The family loved it. The only change I made was adding about 15 large shrimp. This is a keeper.

My husband and I really enjoyed this quick and easy meal. Due to sheer laziness and fat content, I made the following modifications: used fresh sugar snap peas instead of the frozen peas because I had them on hand and instead of the heavy cream, used skim milk mixed with a heaping teaspoon of flour. I took the advise of previous posters and sauted fresh garlic in with the white wine. Oh, and I also added a handful of freshly grated pecorino romano cheese to the sauce - fantastic. My chives just came up this past week in the garden, so I was excited to use herbs from the garden.

I followed the recipe to the letter. As other cooks mentioned, the recipe is a good basic but adding some extras like garlic, wine or basil could make it really soar.

My husband and I loved this meal.The sauce goes well with the seafood and noodles. Will make this again for sure.

Excellent dish. I agree, spicing it up a bit (even with just a little more salt and pepper or red pepper flakes) could make this even better. A keeper.

Modified this recipe with fresh pasta and no peas. Key to this recipe is using the freshest ingredients possible and not over - cooking the scallops.

I agree that this was a bit disappointing. After our first bite, my husband and I both reached for the salt & pepper. That didn't quite do it, so i then reached for the lemon juice and that helped zest it up a bit. My husband still added more - tabasco sauce, and by then it was good for both of us. We both agreed that adding garlic during the saute'ing process would be good, and maybe deleting the water and adding more cream to make the sauce richer. But, we will definitely make it again with modifications because it was easy and had the possibility to be a knock-out dish. Oh, and we ate almost the whole thing between the 2 of us (with a small salad and bread), so to serve 4 I'd definitely add a main entree or a side vegetable.

This was a disappointment. It's a good basic recipe, but we found the result to be really bland. If I make it again, I'll add some red pepper flakes and/or garlic with the wine to give it some additional flavor. I just think there are better scallop recipes out there.

Just by reading the instructions it's clear that boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut in half or thirds, could substitute easily for the scallops. You might need to saute them a bit longer.

sounds great, does anyone have any suggestion on how to convert to a chicken recipe as I am allergic to seafood?
