I don't mean to be a snob, but I thought the sauce was a bit so-so to be paired with lobster (mayo & ketchup??). Overall flavor was ok and it was pretty easy to make, just nothing special and didn't enhance the natural richness of lobster at all.

Served this as as appetizer for Valentine dinner. It was great, my husband loved it. Little I would change to make it any better. I will pass this along to my friends.
