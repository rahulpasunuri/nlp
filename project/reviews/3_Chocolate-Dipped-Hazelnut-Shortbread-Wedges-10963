I made these as part of someone's 40th birthday party buffet, and disliked them so much that I ran to the store to supplement the baked goods. At the party, everyone else raved about them. I thought they were too dry, but they were still a hit. Matter of taste, I guess.

I too have been making these cookies since they appeared in the magazine. I make them every Christmas & friends are always asking if I am making them again to give.

This is not a recipe for shortbread, this is a recipe for pie crust. Unbelievably dense (not in a good way); like eating/serving cardboard. I will do my best to "recycle" undipped cookies by in fact turning into pie crust. Not recommended!

A stellar recipe -- quick, easy, delicious, not too sweet, and no rolling. The chocolate is a very nice, crowd-pleasing touch; definitely use best quality, like Valhrona or Callebaut. I made 4 batches to fulfill my Xmas cookie obligations, but they'd be good any time of year. PS/The vegetable shortening seems like a weird addition, but it means that you don't have worry about tempering the chocolate.

I too have been making this cookie since it appeared in the magazine - Fantastic every time! And so easy - it's one of those treats I make when I want to impress people (but not put much effort into it)!!!

I did not love these, they were o.k. but I wouldn't make them again.

So-so cookie recipe. I substituted the hazelnuts for almonds and everyone at work loved it. I will make it again with hazelnuts to see if I like it any better.

I have been making these since they were published in Gourmet years ago. They are elegant and delicious, and my Mother begs me for them every year. When I dip the wedges, I put the melted chocolate into a martini glass. Make these, you won't be disappointed!

The cookies tasted all right on their own but really shone when served with ice cream! The combination of flavors and textures was irresistable. I scored the dough before baking, but it's so easy to cut through the warm baked cookie that I wouldn't bother pre-scoring next time. It was more trouble trying to find the same score lines than just doing it once after baking.

A wonderfully easy and delicious cookie! I only had enough hazelnuts for a single batch, so I used toasted almonds in addition to the hazelnuts to make a double batch. Scoring wasn't necessary.

Very easy to make......my 11 year old granddaughter prepared this recipe by herself. We forgot to score the dough before we put the pans in the oven, and remembered about 10 minutes into baking. Surprisingly, the wedges still came apart fairly easily. Nice crunchy texture and the chocolate gives the wedge extra flair. Everyone raved......this one is a keeper!

Great cookie and very impressive but rich. I experimented with the cutting of the wedges as they crumble very easily. I found that triangles or rectangles worked better than the long wedges.

These cookies were delicious with great texture from the hazelnuts. I used pre-chopped hazelnuts in a package and it cut down on the work. I made them over the holidays last year as part of an assortment. Easy to make!
