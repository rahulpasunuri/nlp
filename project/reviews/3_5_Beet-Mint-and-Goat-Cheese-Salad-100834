Made this for the first time and it got rave reviews and wasn't difficult to make.

I used this recipe for the goat cheese and the salad, I didn't have mint and am not fond of beets. It was very easy to make. The pan fried goat cheese turns out great, I've found that part of the recipe can jazz up any plain old salad incredibly well!

This was okay. A lot of fiddling around at the last minute. I prefer a salad I can make ahead of time.
