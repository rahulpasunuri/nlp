I did not have fresh garlic or a red onion so I used powders instead. Did not remove seeds and chopped the eggplant with a fork and left in small pieces. Delicious.

I removed all the seeds, which is very tedious, but I have a very smoothe spread or dip. I used non-fat yogurt instead of mayonaise, and reduced the oil to only a drizzle. It came out very nice and is really healthy.

I've been making this recipe for years now. It has become a true favorite.

delicious dip, and relatively healthy. It holds up beautifully at a cocktail party or buffet

I made this for the first time and it was excellent. The taste of the spread was great. I didn't have a red onion so I used a regular onion the taste was still great. I served the spread with cut veggies, I would certainly make it again

This is a great summer dip. It always gets compliments and people are surprised that it's eggplant. Removing the seeds is kind of tedious, but worth it. The Spiced Pita Toasts are a must.
