Yum! This was great - we added colorful non-pareil sprinkles to make it a birthday cake for my 4 year old. Made for nice crunches, between the sprinkles and the poppy seeds you couldn't tell what was what. So easy and delicious. I am making another one today for party #2.

I expected this to taste more lemony than it was. I added lemon juice to the recipe and it still didn't help. The lemon glaze was good but not enough for what I was looking for.

Excellent, quick recipe! I add a splash of lemon juice to the cake when I add the eggs. I also prefer a thicker glaze so only use 2T lemon juice for the topping.

simple, quick and delicious. Baked it in a 9 inch springform pan and omitted the poppy seeds. Let it cool for 5 minutes, poked holes with toothpick over the cake and poured glaze on the cake while still in the springform.

This is the second time I've made this little cake. It's a really great recipe. The batter is really thick-but don't worry it rises beautifully. The only things I will do differently next time is add a little bit of flour to the pan, because mine did stick to the pan and broke in half as I got it out. Plus, the glaze needs about an additional TBS of lemon juice so that's spreadable. It's very thick

I thought this turned out great. I more or less followed the recipe, I used the zest of a whole lemon since I love lemon and all the butter called for. The flavor was great, very moist and with a nice crumb. I used more lemon juice and less powdered sugar than called for in the glaze as some reviewers suggested but I think next time I'll just stick with the recipe. I was hoping for a shiny white glaze and mine soaked into the cake more than I would have liked. Tasted great tho! I also made 3 small springform pans instead of one pan but it still took 30 mins at 375. Yum! And easy and quick enough to make after work.

Growing up my mom would always make lemon poppyseed cake but it was from a box and I wanted to try it from scratch so I choose this recipe, and I am very happy with the results. I used about 1 and a half teaspoons lemon zest and also added about a tablespoon of lemon juice to the wet ingredients took enhance the lemon flavor. Per another reviewer's suggestion on cutting down on the butter, I sub-ed one stick of butter with a 1/2 cup of applesauce. I think that this helped mask the intense butter flavor that other reviewers had complained about. Also, when making the icing I added about another tablespoon of lemon juice because it was not thinning out enough. With these changes the cake came out lighter than I had expected which in my opinion complimented the lemon flvaor that I was going for. As a testament to it's "yumminess", my mom ate literally 1/4 of the cake and has asked me to make it again.

This is a quick torte that I tweaked slightly to achieve a very tasty confection. Reduce butter to 1 1/2 sticks, increase lemon zest to 3-4 teasp, add 1 cup lemon juice to batter and bake no more than 25 minutes. I added 1 cup lemon juice to the confection sugar and it made a moist cover for the torte. End result very lemony, very European and very delicious

I've made this cake a few times, and I love the flavor but last time I made it, it was so dry that it was nearly inedible. I don't know if that has to do with cooking time or ingredients -- any suggestions?

Excellent cake. Small but heavy because of the butter. I actually reduced butter to 3/4 c and cake turned out fine. Simple to make and simple to present.

Concerning the butter-related comments: I suggest swapping 1 stick for 1/4 cup of applesauce. You can't taste it at all and it keeps the cake from drying out while cutting out a ton of fat and calories!

I followed the recipe (I have no problem with butter!) and it is not a typical cake batter -- nearly the consistency of cookie dough. It's an absolutely delicious cake, so I'm giving it four forks despite the fact that, although I buttered the 9-inch cake pan pretty generously, the bottom broke off when I took it out of the pan. Next time I'll butter AND flour the pan and hope that works.

I made this exactly as written (with all of the butter) and it came out perfectly. The only thing I did was but back on the baking time, and thank goodness! The cake was done after 22 minutes. Light and perfectly moist! Yum.

I generally make recipes exactly as written the first time to get a base line before I play with reviewers recommended modifications, but because of the butter controversy I tasted the batter first. It was very buttery and not so lemon-y. So I added half again all the other ingredients,except butter and tossed in the juice of a whole lemon (will add even more next time)and made muffins. The yield was 12 full sized muffins and they were yummy. Nor did I have any dried out issues. I have a muffin pan that looks like a flower and you don't need to grease it at all with this recipe. Enjoy.

Half the butter worked great, it still has a rich taste and I'm still trying to figure out what it tastes similar to. I added 1/4 cup of lemon juice to the cake batter and reduced the amount of powdered sugar (only 1 cup). This was really good. It cooked for 20 minutes and it was a little drier than I would have liked but still yummy!

I was craving a traditional lemon poppy-seed cake and this hit the spot. I used only 3/4 C butter, as suggested by some others, but I think the batter could have handled the whole cup. I also added 1 tsp. vanilla extract and 2 tsp. lemon extract to the batter for depth of flavor. I made the cake in a loaf pan, which increased the cooking time to 45 minutes.

Rating: 4
Same with everyone else: This recipe is great if you use half the butter and add some lemon juice to the batter. I made it into muffins to go with Mother's Day brunch and they came out perfect. More cake-y than moist, even with the added lemon juice, but that's not really a bad thing.

Just wanted to write in again and say that I have made the cake a half dozen times since I first wrote in and the recipe works great with exactly half the butter. Still rich and delicious. So, take my word for it and halve the butter!

Rating: 2
HALF the BUTTER! Other reviewers are correct, there is way too much butter in this recipe. I doubled the recipe, but used half the butter (so only 1 stick with a doubled recipe), plus added the juice of two lemons directly into the cake. That worked tremendously well.

Way too much butter, all I could taste was butter, a waste of ingredients and time

cheers for the tailoring hints for the recipe. I cut the butter/icing sugar and tripled the lemon in the cake and icing for a puckery fantastic cake and glaze. The cake was still not very lemony and will have to add more.

Agree with all those who note to cut down on the butter and the powdered sugar in the glaze. I added almond extract but would still increase zest in the cake to make more lemony, and probably in the frosting too. Still tasty and so easy!

This cake was delicious, and I accidently made it with half the butter!! I doubled all the ingredients and realized at the end that I had forgotten to double the butter. In the end there was less batter than there should have been, only enough for one ten inch cake and some cupcakes. But the cake tasted great! So, it probably doesn´t need nearly as much butter as the recipe calls for. Next time I plan to make the same mistake deliberately!

Excellent flavor, although heavy on the butter. I followed advice, and cut back the powdered sugar to only 1 cup, and added 1/4 tsp lemon oil to the cake. I'll make it again, but maybe with less butter??

Followed the recipe exactly. If I make it again I'd reduce the glaze by 1/3 (2 Tbsp lemon juice + 1 C powdered sugar). Otherwise a fabulous cake! Very delicious, very simple, very quick.

Made the recipe as directed, except for using only one cup of confectioner's sugar instead of the cup and a half. The cake was a hit! Everyone loved the natural lemon taste, the texture that the poppy seeds added, and the delicate sweetness (not "too" sweet) of the icing. That it only took thirty minutes to put together? Well that remains the baker's 'secret'!

I love this recipe. I always add extra lemon juice to the cake mix and the icing and I use an entire lemon for the zest to make it extra lemony. it's always turned out really well for me, but make not to leave it in too long or it will get really crunchy around the edges.

Hmm... Totally pedestrian. Icing was too powdery-sugary for me, would have preferred a little zest or liqour or lemon oil for more punch. Cake was good - crumby but buttery - somehow I was envisioning more of a pound cake, but that is not the recipe's fault. Would have personally liked the cake to be more lemony too. Decent, but not mindblowing. Found myself wanting more from this than it had to give. Easy, but I will not make again. In my opinion, there are far better lemon dessert recipes out there!

I made into mini muffins (FYI, 2 dozen) froze them (sans glaze) and then served them at a brunch a few week later. Although I intended on warming them to add the glaze, I decided not too. Perfect for brunch, since they aren't too sweet! Texture is different; it's light, buttery and crumbly, which was a nice change along side other standard muffins. Will definitely make again, and will try the cake version, with the glaze!

I wasn't crazy about it. Mine came out crumbly, but it may because I used whole wheat flour. My husband liked it. Flavor was very nice. I put in extra zest and a bit more juice for more lemon.

This cake is as great as everyone says. Simply amazing! I am usually a big fan of extra everything - extra frosting, ice cream with cake, or tons of whipped cream. But the glaze is all this cake needs. Simply fantastic! I added 1/2 T extra poppy seeds and made the glaze with only 1 C powdered sugar. It was excellent!

Loved it. Baked it in an 8x8 square glass pan and just spread the glaze on when warm. Added a tiny bit of powdered ginger and extra zest, since my other favorite is lemon, ginger, pepper cake. For a quick and tasty dessert with little effort, I highly recommend it. My husband thought it was wonderful.

Made this according to recipe, but baked in an 8" pan for 30 minutes. Just right. Used lighter glaze, more lemon juice, less powdered sugar. Quite tart, but that's what I was looking for. Might not suit others. I will make this again. I love 1 layer cakes for my small family.

Here's how foolproof this cake is: I baked it in a rice cooker and it was still delicious! I made the recipe exactly as written. In the future, I might cut a little butter or replace it, and wait a little longer before adding the glaze (it soaked into the cake instead of coating it).

As previously mentioned, this recipe is quick and easy, and incredibly tasty. I found the actual cake light and fluffy and it was a big hit at home. My only issue was the icing. I squeezed about a 1/4 of a lemon and mixed it with the icing sugar, just to give it a good zing. But I found that the mixture became very thick and very messy and difficult to work with. What sort of consistency should the icing be? Mine dried very hard, very quickly. Is it because I added more lemon juice than was called for in the recipe? Any suggestions for the future?

This is a great, easy cake. I made it without the lemon once (adding a little vanilla to the icing instead) & it was also delicious. I only use a fraction of the icing called for, however - otherwise it is way too sweet for me.

This cake is amazing. Easy to make, light and fluffy, and the flavor makes me HAPPY it's so good and lemony. I heeded someone's advice and used 1 stick of butter combined with 1 cup of buttermilk, in an effort to cut down on some of the calories. The resulting texture was perfect. Not too heavy, but still buttery (but not too buttery) and fluffy and a perfect consistency of crumbs. I felt like I bought this cake at a very expensive bakery! Excellent recipe all around.

i made some 1/2 vegan substitutes to the recipe to make it a bit healthier and used flax seeds instead of poppy (I couldn't find poppyseeds in Amsterdam!!)...the cake still turned out so yummy!! 1 banana = 1 egg 2/3 cup applesauce = 2/3 cup butter. This means I only used 1 egg and 1/3 cup butter, the substitutes I made helped to reduced the cholesterol and fat.

The cake was quick and easy to make with a nice play of flavors between the rich butter, poppy seeds and lemon. However, it was a little dry and, like a previous reviewer, I would definitely check at 25 minutes. Has anyone tried baking this at 350 degrees? (This didn't stop me from stealing a second piece.)

I was skeptical when I discovered how thick the batter was for this cake, but it proved itself well worth its four-fork review. I didn't have a lemon on hand so I substituted 1t pure lemon extract for the zest with good results. The cake does look a bit dull, so I added some toasted sliced almonds to dress it up. I plan to serve this as both a dessert and breakfast cake.

I have made it three or four times since I saw the recipe last May. I leave the poppy seeds out and have rave reviews. I also won Best of Division at last years California State Fair so don't hesitate to try it with or without the seeds.

I've already reviewed this recipe; it's a staple in my house and in miniature version for little gift boxes. I wanted to add info for anyone interested: I made this for Passover, replacing the flour measure-for-measure with matza cake meal. It turned out pretty well. If you try it, be sure to smooth the top completely as it won't get smooth in the oven as it does with flour. Also, since it has that signature matza flavor, next time I'll increase the lemon zest and maybe even add a drop of vanilla. Overall, it did turn out nicely.

This recipe is excellent. This was my first time making a lemon poppy seed cake. I'm so glad to have stumbled upon this recipe. It will be a family favorite for many years. The only negative thing I can say is make sure you place it on a large plate/platter before you add the glaze, as the extra does drip down quite a bit

A delicious and quick and easy recipe. I used it for my annual holiday gift-box. Instead of using one 9" pan, I used 4" round springform pans. Even though they were non-stick, I buttered them so as to increase the flavor. The cakes practically slid out of the forms and tasted incredible as well. Since I used the smaller pan size, I baked the cakes at 350 degrees F. One regular recipe makes about 3 4" cakes, each pan filled halfway. I usually wrap a piece of foil around a springform since no matter what brand of pan I buy, they always seem to leak a little. This recipe did not require that since the batter was so thick. The lemon flavor was quite intense, but I was liberal with the zest--I used the zest of one whole lemon per recipe from a microplane grater (which is a really thorough zester, so you get more than usual). Delicious, if you're fond of lemon. All the recipients of the gifts called to tell me how wonderful they thought the treats were. I will be making this again in the future.

IHEART this recipe! I too have tried it several times and each time it's been fantastic. I omitted the poppy seeds. Because I like my cake lemony I added about 3 table spoons of lemon juice and 1 table spoon of lemon zest to the batter, I also added a half a cup of sour cream for a bit of zing and added moisture. I buttered and floured the cake pan well, the cake falls right out once baked. I garnished with a few thinly sliced lemons on top...yum!!

This recipe was very good. I had trouble removing the cake from the cake pan, but I am guessing that I didn't quite butter the sides of the pan enough.

So I have now successfully made this cake three times. First round was exactly as written. Very Good, but very buttery. Second round I reduced the butter to 3/4 c. butter and added 1/4 c. buttermilk. Again, very good and I could not detect the change. This last cake I reduced the butter by half and added 1 c. buttermilk. Honestly, I think this one is my favorite. The buttermilk adds a little more zing, and I don't feel so bad about the butter quantity (as written this recipe would need 4 sticks for a two layer cake and that is way too much!) Enjoy it anyway, but don't fear reducing the butter fat quantity... it will work.

made the recipe with my 11 yr old son -- we doubled the recipe (but not the glaze) and it came out perfect. nice 'light' delicately crumbly cake -- and quick. only advice is to watch the time -- i could have cooked the cakes for only 27 minutes (used 2 ovens). one of the cakes was a little darker than it should have been, but still tasted fine. also, if you are looking for lemony taste, the only lemon taste is from the glaze.

I thought this was terrific. I made it exactly as the recipe stated for a big party and it was devoured. Light, great crumb, and lemony but not too tart. My only challenge was the glaze, which was a bit thick but I just added a bit of water so it would drizzle nicely over the cake. Def would make again and again. So easy!

I've made lots of lemon poppy seed cakes from various recipes and never had one fail yet. This one is very simple and nice and lemony. To margmcc; The eggs give plenty of liquid for this recipe. If you use eggs straight from the fridge, try bringing them to room temperature before whisking to incorpoate maximum amount of air. Hope you have better luck next time as this really is a good recipe.
