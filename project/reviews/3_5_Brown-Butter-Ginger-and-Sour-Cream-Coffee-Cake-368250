I knew this would be rich and wonderful when it started with all that delicious browned butter. Next time I would make it in 3 layers to spread the brown sugar goodness a little more evenly. I thought the flavor of the cake was exceptional and will be making it again as soon as I have some friends for coffee. The almonds were perfect with the ginger.

What a waste of time, energy and ingredients! The moment I added the liquid browned butter to the topping mixture, I knew that this was not going to end well, and it didn't. I just took my lovely smelling but sadly sunken cake out of the pan in gloppy, soggy pieces. Clearly, now, the butter needs to be cooled before continuing, for both the topping and the batter. I'll try to salvage this mess... maybe a trifle.

Very moist and so buttery! I used all white flour, walnuts instead of the almonds and a 12 inch tube pan because that's what I had on hand. will definitely make again, maybe double the nuts next time and put the nuts both in the middle and on top,and add craisins
