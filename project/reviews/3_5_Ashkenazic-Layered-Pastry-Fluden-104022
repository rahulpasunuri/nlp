Everyone loved this desert... I had to use at LEAST another cup of flour as I rolled the dough, so I could work with it. I did not use coconut, currants nor raisins. I used Raspberry Habanero Jam (UttersDelights.com) and chopped walnuts. I served it with 5 spice ice cream http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Five-Spice-Ice-Cream-350216. It is pretty rich, serves way MORE than 8 - 10 Servings. It was pretty difficult to work with the dough, but probably worth the work. I'm saying I will make it again, but don't hold me to that ;-)

I am rating this recipe without having made it simply because I'm so excited that there is a fluden recipe. My mom makes this but does not use eggs, sugar or vinegar in the dough (a pie crust instead of a cookie dough). She uses ground walnuts and raspberry jam, does use raisins, no coconut. She bakes it at 400 F for 30 minutes. It is heavenly.
