I've been making this recipe for a few years now. I use indoor grill pan, and sometimes I don't add the olives. We love them. They don't fall apart much for me, especially if they sit in the fridge. I pulse the tuna in the food processor to chop. The ingredients do take over a little, so maybe cut back on the dijon if your looking for more tuna flavor.

In a word: awful! Thankfully I did not try to cook them on the grill as I had a hard enough time keeping the burgers from falling apart in a pan. And for all the chopping involved, it simply wasn't worth the time or the energy. The olives and capers overwhelmed the taste, and the basil mayonnaise added nothing. Very disappointing given the previous reviews.

Have made this recipe many many times, starting from when it first appeared, and people love it. Have experimented with many ways of trying to make burgers stick together better - best improvements re adding raw egg, and chilling burgers at least two hours. Have also improved on mayonnaise by making aioli from scratch and adding basil. Have also tried to make more a true nicoise by adding chopped steamed green beans - that was fine but not a big improvement.

At first I thought this recipe was rather labor intensive, but it was worth it in the end. I didn't trust that one burger per person would be enough especially for the hungry men in the family, so I made enough for 6 burgers. Not necessary! Four was plenty. (I froze the other two to grill at another time.) Served the burgers on ciabatta rolls. I wasn't terribly impressed with the basil mayonnaise. Even after adding a little lemon juice and salt & pepper, it still seemed rather bland. Next time I'll add some Dijon mustard to spike it up a bit. Still, there were rave reviews from all!

This is my favorite ahi burger recipe. I've been making it for years. You can use the cheaper grade of ahi and they come out fine. They will stay together if you chill them, and, in addition to spraying the burgers, oil the grill. They still need to be handled with care, but have worked for me. I lighten the sauce by using 1/2 nonfat yogurt, 1/2 mayo, a little bit of dijon mustard, plus the basil.

Yummy!

This was a great recipe. I also used bread crumbs instead of the potato, formed the patties, sprinkled them with flour and froze them over night. I used one of those fish holders for the grill which kept them together. I used the non-sushi tuna steaks to save money. They were delicious and a huge hit.

I've been making these since the recipe was first published and have always followed it exactly. It's one of our favorites. We also cook the burgers on an oiled screen (gas grill), and they hold together nicely. We've timed them so they're perfectly cooked, still med-pink in the center. Excellent!

we first made this recipe when it came out in 1998, and haven't forgotten it since. These tangy tuna steaks-on-a-roll are so good that the meat-eaters will grab them instead. Be sure to make extra if you can afford it.

I think the reason it was suggested in the recipe to use a french loaf and then HOLLOW OUT the bottom half is just for the reason we have all noticed, the burger falls apart! So, if we follow the recipe exactly, we shouldn't have a problem, yes? :) I now, it seems more like tuna hash this way, so go for the gusto and bread crumbs if you wish. I just finely chopped about 2/3 of the tuna and tuened the rest into paste via my food processor. This is similar to a crab cake recipe I have where the crab (tuna) itself is the major binding ingredient :)

NI&CCEDIL;OISE? Now that's an interesting ingredient.

Tuna steaks were falling from the sky after this weekend's fishing trip, so I decided to try this one out among others. Substituted the bread crumbs for the potato. Sticking was a minor issue but I didn't have the patience to chill them as suggested by others. Fantastic receipe. Right on par with the local "Legal Seafood" restaurant. I'm sure I'll be making this again.

I have made this recipe since it first came out and always get requests for it. I found that making the burgers in advance (a big plus), dusting them in flour, laying them on a sheet of wax paper on a cookie sheet, freezing them, then cooking them frozen in a little olive oil in a skillet works to hold them together. For those who like their tuna more on the rare side, it allows for that option. Liked the idea of using tarragon vinegar. Will try it this time. Delicious on a bed of greens, some tomatoes, and inventive tartar sauce and lemon.

I used bread crumbs instead of the potato. I chopped the tuna in the food processor, it made the mixture very sticky, so I had no problem forming the burgers. Used spinach for the greens. Great summer dinner.

Delicious! I'll definitely make this again. I halved the recipe to serve 2 and used breadcrumbs as suggested rather than potato (I tried to halve the crumbs too but I eventually added more, a total of 1/4 C.) and chilled the mixture for 30 min. I cooked on my G. Foreman grill (don't laugh - it works like a charm) and had no trouble with them falling apart. I used tarragon vinegar, & only added a teeny pinch of fleur de sel because the olives and capers are salty enough. Served with roasted potatoes and a big salad of mesclun, hard-boiled egg & toasted walnuts.

Actually, I would change the recipe a little. It was impossible to hold the patties together. I would change the potato to soft bread crumbs and add 1 beaten egg to hold mixture together. Also might chill 20 minutes before cooking. The taste was fine but everything kept faling out of sandwich.

I made it with albacore and the flavor was really good, but it was hard to hold the patties together. I'll try adding an egg to the mix next time. It's a nice way to stretch high quality tuna for two to tuna for four.

Excellent recipe, except that you have to chop up a tuna steak to make it. Would make it again if tuna steaks begin falling from sky.
