I thought this stuffing was delicious! I followed a previous reviewer's suggestion to make 3/4 of all the vegetable porportions (with the exception of the onions, which I halved - so, just 4 cups of this). This made the perfect amount to fit into my 9x12 dish!

I have made this stuffing (or dressing) for four years in a row and everyone loves it. I always make this recipe (follow it to a tee) and another newer stuffing/dressing recipe to see which one is the winner - so far this one has won each year. It's buttery and spicy and goes great with a fried turkey!

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and it was a huge hit.

fabulous stuffing. Used a little less red pepper. used 1/2 cornbread stuffing and some homemade croutons. As with all stuffings, veg/seasoning is up the individual. Served a traditional stuffing in addition for those not so adventurous! you won't be disappointed with this one!

Very good. Used 1 bag of cornbread stuffing and 1/2 of my fresh baked croutons seasoned with some sage. Reduced the red pepper slightly. As with all stuffing recipes, one must season and add/omit veg to your liking. I will make this again! I served another traditional stuffing recipe, to balance the meal for those wanting "same-old" dressing.

Different and very tasty. And I found it pretty easy to make. My family and guests loved it. But I made 2 big changes in the recipe: I used 6 cups onions (which I normally love and add extra) because I could see the vegetable pile (which I like a lot of) was overwhelming the cornbread pile, even for my taste. In the end I only used about 2/3 of the whole veggie/sausage mix and only 1 egg. Next time I will cut back the sugar as well. Instead of a subtle sweetness it leaps out at you - too much sweet. Added fresh rosemary. But we loved it with these variations and will make it again.

Great new recipe. Somewhat time consuming. Would make cornbread day before.

It was easy to make and tasted great.

I just reviewed this recipe - forgot to say that I just sort of ignored the sugar in the cornbread, and maybe added extra chili powder. Very tasty.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year - what a great recipe. It was easy and very tasty. My husband loved it, too - we ate it up! I did have to change it, because I don't know where to find andouille sausage here in Spokane - so I used spicy Italian sausage - still the recipe was excellent. I used the cornbread recipe, too. The only disappointment (slight) I experienced was that in this part of the country, there are no hot jalapenos. Next time: serrano peppers!

I, enjoyed this recipe. It was a little sweet -- not offensive. I did like that it was a different version of stuffing other than the traditional that we have done for many years. It takes a lot of time to chop all the vegetables, but I thought all of the onions and peppers gave this recipe a really good flavor. I would make it again. I also liked the addition of the Andouille sausage.

This dish was a huge disappointment. Agree with the other reviewer about it being too sweet - the cornbread in this recipe is cakelike and sticky from the sugar. But worse than that, the stuffing was a wet, messy glop. None of my Thanksgiving guests liked this and I ended up throwing more of it away than was eaten.

I made this as a second dressing for Thanksgiving, and 10 out of 10 people at dinner did not like it. Part of the problem was the sweetness of it. The sugar needs to go. Real cornbread does not need sugar. Overall however, it was just a big disappointment.

It does state to add the remaining vegetables after the the first set browns for 20 min.

Measurements are askew in this recipe. It asks you to chop 8 C onions, 5 C celery, 3 C mixed peppers and then only asks you to use 6 C onions, 4 C celery, 2 C peppers. Once you mix these veggies w/sausage, it becomes extremely soupy; I pour out a lot of flavored liquid as it was unmanegeable. Sausage combined w/cayenne made it super hot to the taste. Corn bread part was ok as we left out the jalepenos. If we had used them on top of the sausage and the cayenne; no one could have eaten it at our house. What were we supposed to do with the leftover 2 c onions, 1 c celery and 1 c peppers? What a waste of time. I had a friend help me with this and neither one of us could understand what was meant with all these chopped vegs. Bon Apetite let us down on your reputation wth this one.

Neither my husband nor myself are stuffing fans, but I thought this recipe looked intersting. I was surprised that not only I liked it, but my husband with noted enthusiasm remarked, "I don't like stuffing, but this is great!" The mix of sweet cornbread and spicy sausage and cayanne pepper is a great balance. Definitely a keeper!

This was very disappointing. It has many of our favorite ingredients, but it has no identity--the sweet, and the hot and the savory just kind of mix into a very bland dish without character. We will not be making this one again.

We really wanted to like this, but it was too sweet for us, and a little bland other than the sausage. Maybe we're just too tied to traditional sage dressing.

This is an absolutely wonderful recipe...the flavor is outstanding...the only drawback is that the recipe states that it serves 10...given the quantities of all the ingredients, it will serve closer to 15-20...I cut down on the quantity of ingredients to serve 10...it is an excellent change of pace from traditional dressing.
