I was searching for a use for persimmons and found this recipe. I made it with Pecan Raisin bread, added 1/2 t. cinnamon and 1/4 t. nutmeg and omitted the walnuts. I served it with a simple bourbon hard sauce. My husband loved it so I will try it again during the holidays.

I'll look for other ways to use up our persimmons. I found this too sweet and it did not have the traditional, custardy bread pudding texture.

I have a persimmon tree (well my neighbor does), so I am always looking for interesting persimmon recipes. This was so good, we ate the entire thing in one night between four of us! I would reduce the vanilla to bring up the taste of hte persimmons. I also tried making it with panettone in place of challa, and it was pretty tasty.

Don't expect it to taste like persimmons. If you're looking for persimmon flavor, keep it simple. But if you need to use some very ripe persimmons, this is ideal as well as delicious. Many variations are possible. Used skim milk with good results. Also seasoned with allspice and mace. I can see varying the spices with cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove. I'd prefer more raisins, and will double them next time. The nuts added a pleasant crunch, but their flavor wasn't discernible.

Blahh.....Sorry, what a disappointment. I love persimmons, but you can barely taste it in the recipe. I used dried cranberries instead of raisins and croissants instead of bread and it turned out bland and soggy. I love bread pudding and have several recipes for it. This one has to be one of the worst.

I thought this pudding was delicious! Although the taste of persimmon is somewhat subtle, it was clearly present, and added a nice silky texture to the recipe (I used local organic persimmons). A good quality molasses sugar (like Billingtons) probably makes a difference, too. It's an unassuming recipe with a homey presentation, but 6 of us thought it was perfect on a winter night. Note: the online version seems to have a typo in the baking time--it's 35-40 minutes (not 5-40)

What a disappointment! This pudding is OK, but has minimal persimmon flavor. Or any other flavor, for that matter. The best part were the raisins. There must be better ways to use Hachiya persimmons.
