When it comes to cooking I'm a novice, this was my second or third meal I've ever made and it was delicious! I made it for my boyfriend and he loved it. I'd definitely recommend it.

Fantastic recipe--I've even used this for sirloins, and they're delicious. I used a French technique for cooking the steaks, though, and they were perfect medium rare: Saute in a cast iron skillet 3 minutes each side, then finish under the broiler, 1 minute each side. Kept the sauce the same, but sauteed the garlic in butter when using a less-fatty steak, and came out perfectly.

This was one of the best steaks I've ever eaten. The sauce was delish and easy. The whole process was very quick once I had everything assembled. I varied the recipe in two ways. First, I used a single steak, about a pound. Secondly, I cooked it three minutes on each side, not four. This resulted in a perfect degree of doneness with the perfect amount of pink.

The sauce was very good. It is helpful to use a flavorful red wine and I added quite a bit. Also important is the reduction time - then all the flavors blend together seamlessly. The best part about this sauce is how easy it is compared to the results! If it was warmer, I would have grilled the steaks as steaks are always better grilled.

This was very disappointing - it was extremely buttery even though I already cut down a little on the butter based on the previous reviews, and it was somewhat tasteless - you could hardly taste the seasoning or the wine. I've eaten so much better with simpler recipes.

Totally not worth the wine! Tasteless!

I followed the recipe to the letter and the sauce was fantastic. What I didn't like, however, is the act of putting a beautiful rib-eye into a skillet. The tenderness is lost by searing and the resting time made them come out medium instead of medium rare. Next time I'll BBQ and prepare the sauce separately.

Yum! I followed the sauce directions exactly, minus the parsley at the end. I used Lucky Duck Shiraz wine. It came out deliciously - tart and tangy but very rich and buttery (but not too buttery). I happened to have steak strips on hand so that's what I used. They came out somewhat chewy but still good. I assume a nicer, thicker cut of steak would yield a tender texture. Either way, it was fantastic! Even my picky boyfriend who didn't like the red wine at first loved the sauce. This will be a staple for cooking steak in my house!

I'm not sure what the fuss is all about really, the sauce mostly just tasted like butter. It's very easy to make but I think the steaks would taste just as good without the sauce.

Rating: 2
This was just OK. The sauce is VERY buttery, and would be greatly improved by the addition of shallots and maybe a little mustard. Jacques Pepin has a great steak with wine sauce recipe--MUCH better than this.

i am a purist when it comes to steaks - salt and pepper is all a good piece of red meat needs sometimes. having said that, this sauce is SO good. the effort to deliciousness ratio is a no brainer.

The sauce in this receipe is amazing. I made it for myself and my husband and we used up all the sauce that was made for four. I am a steak person and have never been a big fan of sauces but I would make this one again.

Rating: 4
I have made this several times and love it. The rib-eye always came out tough, so I would recommend using filet mignon, ny or porterhouse instead. One variation to try is after the steaks are set aside, add a tablespoon size portion of boursin garlic and herb cheese (most supermarkets carry it). Yum!

Just finished cooking this and it is so good. So far it has passed the kid's test now lets see if it passes the hubby test.

This is a restaurant quality recipe for steaks at home. Easy to make and wins raves everytime I serve it.

I have made so many different variations of red wine sauce for rib eyes and they have never quite hit the mark, until now. Truly an impressive, yet simple sauce. I did add shallots to the garlic mixture and put a hefty dallop of boursin on top of each steak before pouring the sauce over. With a nice large scoop of mashed potatoes and balsamic roasted asparagus, I couldn't have been more pleased with this recipe. Don't look elsewhere, use this one!!!

This was absolutely delicious, and I wouldn't change anything (I did go light on the butter, though). This is a great weeknight meal, but you have to use good-quality steaks. We'll certainly be repeating this through the winter while it's too cold to grill.

I'm a 20-something learning to cook and my boyfriend really liked this. Easy enough for beginners!

I made this dish to rave reviews. I omitted the water in the sauce, to keep the richness of flavor going, and also added shallots. WOW!! I served along with a truffled potato gratin, and a mache salad with pears and a white balsamic vinaigrette dressing. My brother and husband were raving over it the entire evening.

This is extremely tasty, but be sure to get the kids out of the kitchen while you're cooking. The oil gets HOT (even on medium with a ceramic cook-top), and as you get splatted with tiny droplets of screaming hot oil the second you take off the splatter guard to handle the steaks, you will be shouting numerous profanities of the highest order (next time I will wear long sleeves and possibly gloves!). That said, I will actually make this again because it was so delicious. Perfect sauce! I made it with eye rounds and while they were a tad chewy because they were medium rare, my kids are now converts for medium rare steak! (They previously freaked if their steak wasn't almost entirely brown.) We served it with garlic green beans and beef-flavored rice. Delicious dinner and the kids (boys, 7 and 11 with increasingly adult tastes) LOVED it as much as Mom & Dad.

This recipe was wonderful! I added mushrooms both times I made it and it made all the difference in the world! I also added Boursin cheese on top, then poured the sauce over it, priceless!

Great sauce. The next morning my husband said he was thinking about how great it had been. I made the mistake of using a cheaper cut of meat. Next time I won't b/c it was tough. But the sauce flavor was great.

Substituted 3 steaks for 1 a serving - yes it's that delicious, my boyfriend finished 3 of the 4 steaks i made. Can't wait to make this again.

Quick, easy and delicious. I will difinitly make it again, and the next time I may add a little sugar or honey to take the edge off sause.

Delicious! Came together in no time. Next time I might try shallots in place of the garlic, as I love shallots, but this is definitely a winner. The addition of soy sauce is a surprising, but successful, component. This will definitely go in the permanent rotation.

This recipe tasted exactly like the meal we ate at a local French restaurant. It was delicious. I used beef tenderloin strip steaks instead of rib eye. I also sautéed some mushrooms in with the garlic. I served it with a twice-baked potato. We will definitely have this again.

This recipe was not as good as expected. Really wouldn't make again because there are others that are much better.

Rating: 2
The steaks were delicious, the sauce was delicious but together they were a little too oily. The rib-eye has a lot of fat and I beleive it would be better with sauteed onions and peppers (poblalos are perfect here)with a dash of vinegar to off-set that. The sauce would be to kill for on a filet mignon! Especially if you add a teaspoon or two of demiglace to the wine before you reduce it.

We've made it a few times now and it's a favorite. However, we felt it needed just a little something, so we've added mushrooms and dried cranberries to the sauce and now really love it..

Fantastic Sauce!! It's my wife's new favorite way to cook steak. I cooked about half this amount of steak and we ate all of the sauce. If I cooked 2 pounds of steak, I'd probably double the sauce. It's fantastic!!

extremely delicious, easy, quick and perfect as is. using thinly cut rib-eyes makes all the difference. this is one to add to the weekly repertoire.

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out perfectly. I used high heat for searing the steaks but med low heat for everything else. It tasted amazing and the sauce was perfect. I did let the steaks cook in the over while I made the sauce b/c I do not like my meat med rare. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and I was more than satisfied! I can't wait to make this again and I think I will pair it with the Wasabi and Green Onion mashed potatoes.

Loved the sauce, and VERY easy. I agree with some of the previous reviewers; the steaks (LOVE ribeye for flavor! -- much better than filet) might be better grilled or pan-seared. I will try that next time.

Really delicious - the sauce was spectacular. I broiled the steaks for a couple minutes to keep them tender. Paired with horseradish mashed potatoes that were excellent. Really good and very simple.

To add to smyers2, I found the same thing happening to the sauce the first time I made it. Last night, i made it again and found that I added the garlic at medium low heat and did not add any additional oil this time. Also, when adding the wine, I cooked at a simmer and the sauce was dead on this time. Before, it was scorched and too savory, but this time it was perfect.

Rating: 0
The pan was very hot after the steaks came off and the de-glazing may have happened too quickly. We didn't end up with as much sauce as I would have liked... but it was very good. And we'd sauteed some mushrooms in advance we we ended up folding into the sauce. Very good that way.

Rating: 3
This was very decent. Good flavor, super easy. I ended up cooking the steak a little longer for medium rare (I think my steak was thicker than half inch). The pan was extremely hot when I added the garlic so I kinda burnt it (I'm still not used to cooking on an electric stove). I cooled the pan down before adding the remaining ingredients and it turned out fine (though if I were serving it to company I probably would have re made it).

Rating: 3
The sauce is truly 4 forks, but I don't understand the appeal of ribeyes. Mine are always tough, though I buy good meat from a butcher and followed the recipe. I think I'll try this with filet and see if I like the end result better.

The sauce was INCREDIBLE. So easy but so darn good. I preheated a cast iron skillet in a 500 degree oven, seared the steak on stovetop for 1 min on each side, then put it back in the oven, 3 min each side for med. Steak was perfect. This will definitely be added as one of my favorite recipes.

The sauce was great. Not an excellent re-heat for leftovers though. It was easy & could make ahead of time.

This is the only way to make steak and this is actually close to the Julia Child recipe I have used for years. The difference is marinating steaks in soy sauce and olive oil with fresh sprinkles of pepper. Leave these out of the sauce and deglaze with wine and butter.

Very good and easy. I would rather grill and render some fat as a previous reviewer stated. The sauce was good, but a little too savory. Leftover steak was fantastic the next day.

For really thick steaks, sear on the outside for the recommended time, then throw the steaks into 325 degree oven while you make the sauce.

Exceptional sauce. FULL of flavor, yet so simple! My family loved this recipe and claimed it was better than eating at a fancy restarant!

My husband raved about the sauce. We grilled our steaks, so I trimmed some fat from the outside of each steak and rendered it in a cast-iron skillet. The soy added nice depth to the sauce. Will definitely make this again!

Rating: 4
Just a heads up. Below jcrimbaud from NJ suggests using a cast iron pan. Great pan for steaks if you aren't going to deglaze with an acid such as wine or tomatoes etc. They tend to leave a metallic taste when doing so but sometime not. This recipe is a great classic steak and pan sauce!

Rating: 4
Awesome sauce! I followed this exactly as shown using about 1/2" rib-eyes as well. My pan was very hot to sear and each batch only required the 4 min as stated (2 min each side for med-rare). Perfect!

Rating: 0
To "A Cook from Orange County". I haven't made this, but I would normally use 1" thick steaks and cook about 4 min. a side for med. rare in a smoking hot cast- iron pan. Maybe you used thicker steaks than the recipe or maybe your pan was only at med. high?

Rating: 3
Very good sauce! however cooking the steaks 5 minutes left our steaks very rare!
