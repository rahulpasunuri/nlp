I wasn't too thrilled with it - I must be more used to tradititional mashed potatoes. I made it for Thanksgiving and it got mixed reviews.

I made these for Thanksgiving, and they were A-MAZING! Make them just as the recipe says - you won't be disappointed.

Tried this recipe with prosciutto and without and it's good both ways. Great with herb-brined standing rib roast (from this site as well).

Wow, this is the best mashed potato recipe I have EVER come across. Go gentle on the rosemary as a little goes a very long way. I doubled the garlic as well.

THE best mashed potatoes I have tried - it is now a yearly favorite at both Thanksgiving and other dinners.

This is a very good recipe. I used Yukon Gold potatoes but I messed up the butter/prosciutto part by burning the butter. I should have started over but I needed to get them on the table. I tossed between adding the cheese first or the milk. You want the cheese to melt and the milk (unless it's warmed) cools the potatoes. I would double the garlic next time.

These potatoes were a HUGE hit for Thanksgiving. Making again for Christmas dinner to go with the herb encrusted rib roast. I used half pancetta and half prociutto!

The "best-est" mashed potatoes ever. It tastes very home-y, very easy to make, and leftover is even better. I will make it many times again.

This recipe was outstanding. The only change I made was using half prosciutto and half pancetta. Every bite was eaten.

It was REALLY good...so it's more like a 3.5 rating. For some reason my initial reaction was 'ehh'. I guess I was expecting it to have a stronger flavor?? Not sure, but over all it was great and really easy to make but more importantly, my guests loved it! :)

What can I say that hasn't already been said... It is fabulous! A must try for a special occassion, highly reccommended with pork.

I made a double recipe of this dish for Christmas dinner for 10 adults and only had one small Gladware container leftover - needless to say, it was a great hit!! I made it the day before and it reheated in the microwave very well with a just a little 1/2 and 1/2 to soften it up. I highly recommend this recipe - easy, delicious, and crowd-pleaser.

This is one of the best mashed potato dishes I've ever had, if not the best. It was much easier to make than I expected and I will definitely be making this again.

Made a double batch of this for a potluck dinner and had multiple requests for the receipe and the dish I took was empty. One note, I found it needed more milk than specified but I kept adding until I had the desired consistency. Definitely a keeper!

AMAZING! Who knew that masked potatos could be even better?! A Thanksgiving staple at our house now.

Excellent! I also used Serrano since I didn't have Parma ham on hand and it was great. I also used lowfat milk since we ran out of whole and it was still pretty rich.

Rating: 3
Was pretty good - I cut the cheese in half, though I should have put it all in. I think next time I'll double the garlic as well...

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe several times and it is always a hit. I have found that the small chunk-style prosciutto works even better than the thin slices.

Rating: 4
I made the full amount for 4 people (expecting to have leftovers) and there was none left! I personally thought it tasted too much like rosemary (it's pretty difficult to mince it well) but no one else thought so. Since we are in Spain, I used serrano ham instead of prosciutto and it was great.

Rating: 4
This dish is a favorite in our house and amongst friends. I am continually asked for the recipe. Over time I have modified it very slightly. While cooking potatoes and garlic, I add some rosemary garlic seasoning to the pot. We are huge rosemary fans, so I will put up to 1/4 cup of minced fresh rosemary in there. Since it is so rich, I normally use skim milk instead of whole milk so it isn't so heavy. Even my non-potato fan husband requests these for every holiday or big dinner. As an added bonus, your kitchen will smell heavenly from the fresh rosemary.

Rating: 3
Fantastic! I barely added any milk (used skim) as I found it was creamy already. Other than that made as is.

Best mashed potatos I've ever had. Really really yummy. I recommend using way more milk than they say to get them really smooth and creamy. Other than that, no edits at all!

My absolute favorite recipe for mashed potatoes. The kitchen always smells wonderful when sautéing the prosciutto and rosemary.

After reading the review, I decided to make it a little different. I cook the potatoes as advised, cut them cubes and brown them in the butter and a little olive oil, some fresh garlic, rosemary, the prosciutto and the potatoes. Placed everything in a baking dish, sprinkled the parmesan cheese on top, then in the oven to broil, Delicious

Very ok...kind of bland if you ask me. I expected much more. The rosemary gets lost. I wont make again.

Rating: 2
This was very ok for me. My guests liked it but they didnt love it. I personally expected alot more from this recipe. The flavors really didnt stand out...and it basically tasted like good mashed potatoes...not great mashed potatoes. If you are going to make this recipe...make sure to double or triple the rosemary...it just got lost.

Heavenly. My husband and I both LOVED this recipe; possibly the best we've ever had. We can't wait to make it again.

Rating: 4
Made this for guests, who fell in love with them! The dish was extremely easy to make. I followed the recommendation to make them ahead, and reheat in an oven covered with foil. The potatoes were so creamy and delicious, we were fitting over the last spoonful. I would strongly recommend this dish to anyone who is a fan of rosemary. It was heavenly!

Rating: 4
This is a phenominal dish and easy to make. Couldn't agree more with other positive ratings. Served to a group of "foodies" and they all loved it. Great fushion of flavors with the rosemary and proscuitto. Might try to lighten it up next time and skip the parmesian. Definitely don't skip the fresh rosemary or you'll miss a special flavoring. Rewarming stovetop I wouldn't do again - I'd microwave them.

Our new all time favorite recipe. So much flavor!

Ahhh the power of a little prosciutto. These potatoes are so creamy and delicious. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
Excellent dish. Changes: added ground black pepper, a hair more prosciutto, and much less parmesan because I had v. flavorful pre-ground parmesan. I added about 1/2 the amount (maybe a little more) of the parmesan that was suppposed to be mixed into the potatoes and then didn't add the cheese that was supposed to go on top. Caution: I almost added extra rosemary but tasted and was glad I didn't. Recipe amount was perfect. Reheated in microwave very well.

My husband is not a fan of yams, so we always need to go with a mashed potato variety as well for the Christmas dinner table. These were a HIT! Everyone loved them. Great flavor, easy recipe, and not the old basic. I used a potato ricer and Yukon Golds and they were as creamy as butter. Keeping this recipe around for years to come!

Rating: 4
Without a doubt, the best mashed potatoes I have ever made. However, I would not recommend re-heating on the stove top. On the lowest heat the bottom burned in two different pots. Next time I would reheat in the oven or in the microwave.

I made this a for a special 5 course dinner party and it was the hit of the night. People were begging to this recipe which I gladly shared!

An excellent way to spruce up my normal mashed potatoes. I added more rosemary than called for, because I adore it. These were a nice complement to the Chicken Louisa recipe on this site. Roast some asparagus, and you have a well-rounded, rather quick dinner. Thumbs up!

Absolutely delicious from a family that loves mashed potatoes! I made them early in the day, adding extra butter and cream, then warmed them in the oven for half an hour and served directly from the oven to the table. Once I left out the Parmesan by mistake and the potatoes were still great!

I've made this several times and love it more everytime. It is a Valentine's Day staple with us now (have made it the past two years for Valentine's Day) as well as other times. I've made it also with Serrano ham, and it is equally good. Also, any leftovers (I go overboard with cooking) freeze very well.

These are extraordinary mashed potatoes. We used buttermilk instead of whole milk, and made potato pancakes out of the leftovers.

This has become mandatory for all holiday meals. We had it for Christmas dinner with prime rib and everyone loved it! Never any leftovers of this dish. I substituted a mixture of non-fat milk and non-fat half and half for the whole milk. It did not lose any of the great flavor!

BEST MASHED POTATOES EVER! I made this for Christmas Eve dinner along side the rib roast with the garlic and thyme crust (which was also phenomennal, I might add). This recipe is perfect and everyone at the table LOVED it!!

Great dish - especially for a potato head! Loved the rosemary flavor... used the leftovers the next day for potato pancakes.

Awesome spuds! I made them in the morning, adding a little extra warm milk to keep them from drying out in the oven later, then put them in a pyrex. Before dinner, I rewarmed them (loosely tented with foil to keep the cheese from burning) for about 40 minutes at 325 degrees, in a convection oven. They were perfect with grilled lamp chops and marinated, grilled asparagus! Great do-ahead dish.

absolutely fabulous. I made them about 2 hours ahead and kept them warm in the crock pot. So easy and without the last minute work of traditional mashed potatoes.

This recipe was outstanding. I added roasted garlic to it by roasting 4 cloves in heavy foil and then processing the roasted garlic with a 1/4 cup 1/2 and 1/2 to make a paste to add to the mix. I also used baby red potaatoes.

I have made this dish over and over again...simply delicious

These potatoes are worthy of at least five forks! Heaven on a plate. I followed the directions, except for using thyme instead of rosemary. One note: because of the large amount of salt in the proscuitto and the butter, I recommend against adding more to the boiling water. I might use even more parmesan next time, but that's personal choice. This one is a definite keeper!

Rating: 4
This was FABULOUS! After messing around with many different mashed potato recipes and techniques, this is definitly THE ONE. Doubled the garlic (we're garlicphiles), and since I didn't have any prosciutto, so used pancetta instead. Also - cut the pancetta into chunks (it was frozen) and whizzed it in the food processor to really finely chop it. Great blend of flavors!

Rating: 4
These were definitely the BEST mashed potatoes! They were perfect with our grilled pork chops, and I can imagine they'll go well with many other dishes. I could not believe how easy they were to make compared to their delicious flavor. This will be my standard for making mashed potatoes.

I can't believe how easy the prep. was and how good the flavor was. No more simple mashed potatoes again, we'll have these everytime. Guests at my dinner party loved them too. I doubled the batch so I would have leftovers, almost better the following day.

Prepared these early in the day and warmed as directed to accompany my Christmas dinner of roast pork loin. They were absolutely fabulous and even reheating the leftovers (basically for the second time) the following day they were still delicious. Highly recommended.

This is an excellent recipe! I made it the first time for a casual dinner with my parents...roasted chicken and baby peas. It was such a hit we are going to serve it for Christmas Day dinner along side herb-crusted rack of lamb. The fat content is high, but worth the caloric splurge, especially for a special occasion. A word on portions...I doubled the recipe the first time for my party of 6 people, yet we had nothing left...because these were so good! So plan accordingly.

I made these for a pre-christmas gathering and served them with a spiral ham. They were delicious! Everyone raved about them and asked for the recipe before they left. The only thing I wouldn't add too much of is the rosemary. I tend to think the herb overpowers dishes, but otherwise, they had a wonderful flavor.

Okay-the lady from Seattle who said "To Die For", was absolutely right! I made this for Thanksgiving forsaking the usual mashed potatoes and we loved it. My daughter went home and made it 2 days later for her boyfriend and served it with spiral ham, they both agreed "To Die For".
