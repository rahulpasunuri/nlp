I have made this every year as the salad course for Christmas dinner and it is consistently a hit! I usually make the stuffing the day before, mixing all the ingredients in a big ziplock bag, and marinate and cook the mushrooms the day I am going to serve it. Sacrilege, but I use Harvey's Bristol Cream, which gives it fantastic flavor!

They were very good, but a lot of effort for an app. Probably won't make again.

Yumm! It definitely doesn't need as much oil as it calls for. I cut the oil in half and added more garlic, shallot, and balsamic. It was fabulous.

I've been making this recipe for years. I just make the first part, actually (the marinade) and then broil the marinated mushrooms. I serve them on some hearty bread with goat cheese and roasted red peppers or sauteed leeks for a tasty sandwich.

I made this recipe for New year's lunch and it was absolutely fantastic.......the tastes that flow with every bitefull where absolutely divine. I did take care not to add the water and sherry to the mushrooms but around them for baking as the others said and the result was exceptional! I will reccomend this recipe to anyone who wants to impress his guests!!

An excellent recipe. I used slightly less cheese but the best balsamic vinegar I could afford. I also minced the parma ham.For the herbs I used parsley and basil. Yummy with rocket or arugala.

I get rave reviews every time I cook it properly. Even had someone tell me it was "fine restaurant quality" as happened to another reviewer! BE WARNED: the trick is to remember that while you go through the stuffing ingredients DO NOT put the water and sherry (listed toward the end of the stuffing ingredients) into the stuffing! They are for pouring around the mushrooms in the dish before baking-- I make this recipe a few times a year and have forgotten twice to leave those out of the stuffing as I rush to get tings mixed, in the oven and in my mouth :)... just made the mistake again and what a mushy mess I had!! That is last time I wil make that mistake!!

I admit i screwed up this recipe. I did not read all of the instructions before beginning and mixed in the water and sherry with the stuffing. Then realized DUH, it was supposed to go in the bottom of the pan. (They were listed with stuffing ingredients) Anyway The dressing is wonderful. I may try it again. My version was a little soggy to say the least. LOL

My sister first made this dish last Christmas and I craved it for months until I made it myself. Everyone who has tasted them, LOVE THEM. Note: The first time I made them I used all fresh herbs. The second I used all dried herbs, except for the parsley, and I think it tasted better. It toned down the complexity of the flavors.

For New Year's Eve dinner we followed the recipe almost exactly as printed (with 1/2 cup olive oil only and a little extra ham) and this recipe turned out lovely. I was tempted to skip the greens but they provided balance to the dish and were quite tasty. I will definitely make this recipe again!

Made just mushrooms as an appetizer - outstanding. Used only 1/2 cup olive oil & would use less sugar next time for marinade. I substitututed 3 strips bacon for proscuito, added spinach, and used course ground Italian bread. This made the best mushrooms I've ever tasted and everyone left with a copy of the recipe.

This is such a good first course for a holiday dinner or dinner party- I have made it for several years and always have to pass out the recipe at the end! I also use Italian bread crumbs instead of fresh and a little more Proscuitto (usually San Daniele) than called for- simply yummy!

This was over-the-top delicious!! I substituted a 6 oz can of crab meat instead of the meat as well as Progresso Italian breadcrumbs instead of fresh. The only herb I used was marjorum. Instead of adding the warm water and sherry into the baking pan, I added it to the stuffing and substituted marsala instead of the sherry (still put a little water, though, into the pan before baking). I only did these things because I made the recipe on the fly and used what we had in the pantry and fridge. It was amazing and we are making them again for a dinner party in a few days. I highly recommend this version!!

I made this as part of my vegetarian gourmet luncheon - simply removed the meat from the stuffing. Tasted awesome and I had great reviews all around.

Rating: 1
Sorry, think this is over rated. Flavors are fine but the cooking method (in liquid) turns out a 'slimy' mushroom. Lousy texture with a mushroom dish makes for a very unpleasant thing to eat, regardless of the flavors. Although this will not make it to my 'try again' list, perhaps just roasting the mushrooms on in a grill or drip equiped pan may improve the texture and I dare say the taste.

Rating: 4
INCREDIBLE! It's a really flexible recipe...I stuffed them with spinach, onions, garlic, and green pepper...incredible... The only thing is that people seem to be misreading and putting a cup of oil. The two 1/2 cups are on the same line (i.e. use 1/2 cup of EITHER, but not both).

Rating: 4
I made this for my unadventurous family on Christmas and they really liked them! Definitely would make this again; I was so busy making 4 other dishes that day that I think they'd be even better given my full attention. All the herb chopping gets a bit tiresome, but they're very tasty!

Rating: 4
Delicious, especially the extra flavor in the caps. I used pancetta (browned first) instead of the prosciutto, and it was great. I agree that they don't need the veg oil; it dilutes the balsamic taste and makes way too much marinade. I omitted the parmesan (a guest's food allergy) and they were still wonderful. And I used criminis so they'd be "bite size" as an appetizer (I used a melon baller to hollow them out a bit more). They didn't need to have the water and sherry poured around them, though; maybe if I used full size bellas it would have mattered.

Rating: 4
This is the best dish I've made in a long time.Had it as an entree on the salad, very filling and tasty. Now I am asked to make it for family+friends.Just remember to put the 1/2c warm water and the 1/4c dry Sherry around the mushrooms in the 13x9x2 baking pan. As I almost put it into the stuffing mixture.I didn't use salt as the prosciutto is salty enought.I used only the 1/2c oil as recomended by others on the review. Had alot of stuffing left over but that went to good use over baked stuffed shimp! A MUST try!

Rating: 4
Don't normally give out 4s, but this was fabulous! Restaurant quality! This does not, at first, come across as a salad, but it is one of the BEST I've EVER had! A keeper. Olive oil can be used in lieu of butter and I used a regular old cooking sherry with great success. Do not be afraid to marintate the 'shrooms in the vinagrette, using, only of course, 1/2 cup olive oil. The extra 1/2 cup is not needed. I used twice as much prosciutto and much less bread crumbs.

This was excellent! Love portabellas. Key is FRESH breadcrumbs. I used italian bread in the food processor and left it slightly chunky instead of recommended "fine" ground. Go easy on proscuitto and salt.

This is one of the best stuffed mushroom recipes I have tried! I agree with other reviewers that only 1/2 cup of oil, either vegetable or olive should be used in the marinade. I served the mushrooms as a side dish the first night, and on mixed salad greens the next and got rave reviews from my husband. A keeper!

Okay, ladies and gentlemen. I think we've all agreed - use only 1/2 cup oil in total. Incidentally, the better quality of balsamic vinegar you use, the less oil you need. I watch my carbs, so I subsituted most of the bread crumbs with chopped fennel, celery root, and fresh spinach. I wanted to use really mild vegetable flavors to preserve the mushroom focus. I cut the butter to 1/4 cup. I also didn't dunk the mushroom in the vinaigrette. Instead I brushed the dressing on to marinate so I didn't end up with marinade-logged mushrooms. I also had more left over for other uses. To bake, I put the water in the pan, and the sherry directly onto the mushrooms. Be sure to check the pan to make sure the water doesn't evaporate too quickly and for hot spots in your oven. Yummy.

Rating: 3
I thought this was a very nice preparation for my favorite mushroom. I served it with a nice broiled salmon which was an excellent compliment, although a very filling meal! I also followed the caution from other reviewers and only used 1/2 c. olive oil, which was fine, but I betcha it could've even been pared down even more. My only mistake was plating the mushrooms in anticipation of my husband arriving home any minute...unfortunately they were stone cold by the time he got in! Should've reheated them, for sure!! (laziness coupled with starvation were the culprits!) I will definitely make this recipe again!!

Rating: 0
It appears to me (on my computer) that there may actually be a mistake in the quantity of oil in the recipe. This could be the cause of many reviewers remarking about the greasy/oily-ness of the mushrooms. I believe its supposed to say "1/2 cup olive oil - OR - 1/2 cup vegetable oil". As its written, it makes it sound like you add a full cup of oil...which is a horrific amount for a marinade! Anyone agree?

Very tasty, and even better when reheated a day or so later. We used kosher salami, thinly sliced, one time, lox julliened a second time, and a combo the third time, as we don't eat pork. All were delicious. Much too much bread crumbs in the recipe, however, and 1/2 or 1/3 seemed about right.

Rating: 4
The second time I made these I made the mistake of mixing the sherry and water right into the stuffing. I also cooked them with additional sherry. I thought they were much better that way. Stuffing was moister and more flavorful. I served them at a small get together and they were a big hit.

What a yummy dish! After reading all the reviews I decided to take some of the advise of using less oil and bread crumbs. I used a little more than 1/3 of a cup of oil and 1/2 a cup of bread crumbs. It turned out excellent.

My friends raved over this recipe. I used baby portabellas and served as an appetizer. The marinade is enough for about 20-30 baby portabellas. My only complaint is that if you use too much prosciutto, it could be too salty.

I was very distressed to see that the four mushrooms had absorbed all of the marinade after soaking for about 2 hours, including the cup of oil. Yuck! I was also distressed eating a mushroom knowing that there was a quarter cup of oil in it. Tasted like it, too. I will make this again, either marinating for less time or cutting down on the oil. Nice flavors. Hopefully I will see what the rest of you do in this recipe.

Used about 3/4 of the bread crumbs called for. It held together very well. Wish the stuffing would end up a little drier without overcooking the 'shrooms. I liked the vinaigrette even better than the stuffed mushrooms and will make a big batch of it for salads.

I doubled this recipe for a cocktail party and cut each mushroom in quarters to serve. I did not make the mesclun salad. I used about half the breadcrumbs, as others had suggested, which worked out perfectly. I made the stuffing four hours ahead and stuffed the mushrooms right before they went into the oven. Only three mushrooms fit in my 9x13 pan, so I had two mushrooms and stuffing leftover for lunch the next day. We assembled them and put them on the grill. They were delicious!

My husband (a man who NEVER cooks) made this for my birthday and it was excellent! Very easy for novice cooks. The only thing is, and other reviewers mentioned this----don't add the sherry and water to the stuffing mixture. Bless his heart, hubby was so proud that he hadn't made any mistakes, and then his heart dropped when he realized he wasn't supposed to add the liquid mixture to the stuffing....so take note! But, it still turned out great and we just baked it longer.

This recipe was a huge hit at my dinner party over the weekend. Even a guest who generally does not like mushrooms took a second helping! I served it as an appetizer along with a salad of mixed baby greens and the sherry vinaigrette. Because I was hosting several vegetarians, I did eliminate the proscuitto, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I might try slightly reducing the amount of breadcrumbs next time. Delicious!

Even after reading everyone's comments and reading athe recipe over several times, I added sherry to the stuffing. I only left the water out because I made the stuffing in advance and didn't want it to get too soggy in the fridg. Someone from the website should get online and move the water and sherry ingredients a line or two below the body of the stuffing ingredients. This dish was delicious! I made half with prosciutto and half without. Both were tasty, the vegie just less salty. I also add the chopped up sauteed stems to the stuffing. Would make this for family or company in a heartbeat if I have all the ingredients.

I made these mushrooms for Christmas Eve & what a hit!! I have guests that keep talking about them. It sounds like I will be making these again & again. I found them easy to prepare. I used white button mushrooms since my husband is not a mushroom fan. I bought gourmet sized ones for my guests and smaller ones for him to eat. I thought the stuffing mixture seemed a bit dry and added some extra butter. They tasted fine the night I made them. However, a few days later when I reheated them they were too buttery/oily. I don't know if it was from the extra butter I added or a combination of the marinade continuing to set in.

This dish is incredible! Like many of the other cooks, I didn't bother with the mesclun (though I did buy it...to the cook who was wondering whether it had to be in season, you can buy it pre-packaged where your grocery store has all their "salad-to-go" type stuff). I accidentally used all the marinade on the mushrooms, which was fine, and then instead of the sherry and water in the pan I just dumped the extra marinade. Delicious, but I think I'd make it next time as written (though those pine nuts sound good) because all the oil in the marinade made it very rich. I've brought leftovers to work for lunch and they reheat like a dream and everyone is jealous! A keeper!

This was an exseptioaly rich recipe. Could only eat half of a mushroom. There is a couple of things that I found chanelleging with the recipe. The 6 Ounce Mesclun has to be in season and I assume that it is to be a side salad. The other part that was missing was where do you get the water and sherry to pour around mushrooms when entering the oven. We had three cooks in the kitchen to make the dission to put an additional 1/2 cup water & 1/4 cup of sherry which the recipe did not call. This a WONDERFULL dish. YUM YUM

I can't even believe how great these were, and they were a lot less work than I was afraid they'd be. If you're thinking of trying these do. I agree with previous reviews that the mesclun isn't neccesary, but you might want to make a few extra and keep them for snacking later!

This is the first time I've cooked portabella mushrooms and I could not have asked for a better recipe to start. The dressing and stuffing was easy to make.
