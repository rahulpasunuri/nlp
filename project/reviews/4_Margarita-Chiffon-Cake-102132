Excellent cake. The batter tasted off before baking, but after baking and glazing, the cake was great. I also made the strawberries, and altogether it was quite a boozy recipe. Made some strawberries with just sugar for the kids.

I love this recipe. A bit of work, but everybody loved it. Several people had seconds. A nice change of pace. This was a great end to a Mexican Dinner.

This was great. I served it for a birthday and it was a hit!

This is an excellent cake; delicious, light, refreshing flavor, and fantastic, spongey texture - not dense like pound cake at all. I skipped the compote, because I was taking this to work and worried about how the compote would travel, but I didn't think the cake needed anything extra. The glaze hardens to a nice firm sheen that looks very polished but melts in your mouth.

This is a fabulous light and delicious cake. I tried the others suggestion of placing the cake on a wire rack so it didn't sit in the glaze and that worked great. I think next time I'll try poking holes in the top of the cake to absorb more of the glaze. I also added whipped cream along with the strawberry compote for a nice touch. Again, very big hit and wonderful flavor.

This was wonderful. I made it for my sister's birthday, and it was a hit. I screwed up and added an extra 1/2 cup of sugar, but it wasn't too sweet by any means. Forget cooling the cake over a bottleneck, I just baked it in a greased and floured bundt pan and it slid right out after cooling for an hour. Definitely use the strawberry compote. The cake is wonderful, but the glaze is light, and the strawberries really complete the dessert.

The cake turned out nice and light, the perfect texture. I took it out of the oven after about 50 minutes. The glaze was especially nice on the top, though I made a mess in pouring it. Next time I'll set the cake on a wire rack over cookie sheet to catch the drips, instead of having them puddle at the bottom of the cake. The Strawberry Compote with Tequila and Lime was not to my liking. I would suggest topping this cake with a sweeter strawberry mixture, or perhaps even just fresh berries.

I was surprised after reading all the rave reviews; it just wasn't that great. I made the cake, the icing, and the strawberry compote, but overall it just tasted like a mildly lime pound cake. Disappointing, really. There are so many other great recipes out there...

The cake was wonderful and a big hit (first scratch cake I have made in about 5 years), but fell out of the pan while cooling upside down. Luckily it was more or less in one piece but I wonder why. It may have been a tad underbaked although it tested done and seemed cooked through if very moist. It keeps very well for at least 3 days in a tight cake dome.

I served this after a huge Mexican buffet (Mole Negro recipe from Rick Bayless' Authentic Mexican...took 2 days to make, but WOW.) and it was the perfect close to a perfect meal. Light, delicious, and a great, distinct flavor. My guests raved.

My husband enjoys tequila so this was a perfect birthday cake for him. The cake has a wonderful texture and the taste is so good. I made the strawberry compote but thought next time I would puree some of the strawberries and surround the cake with swirls of it on the plate. Ice cream on the side only improves it.

So, so yummy. I will make this again and again. My frosting turned out runny and puddled at the bottom of the plate. It sat for a little while before I used it, I don't know if that was the cause. Does anyone know what I may have done wrong?

I made this Margarita Chiffon Cake along with the Strawberry Compote for a Cinqo de Mayo gourmet dinner. It was a big hit! All who attended asked for the recipe. I gave them your internet address.

FABULOUS! Made this cake for my husbands birthday get together. The compote was the perfect topping. Everybody raved over it. Can't wait to take this to our next Jimmy Buffet fan club pot luck. A new version of Wastin' Away in Margaritaville!

I wanted a dessert for Corned Beef and Cabbage ST. Pat's dinner with my son and daughter-in-law. Also wanted to show off my brand new Kitchen Aid stand mixer. This was perfect. (I added a drop of green food color, but kept it pastel) The citrus-y tang was a good compliment. took the leftovers to work, it didn't have time to get stale!

I had a tough time finding a dessert recipe for a Mexican dinner we were hosting, until I came across this one. The cake turned out beautifully and all our guests loved it. You gotta serve with the compote too, as it really complements the cake. This one's a keeper!

A GLORIOUS DESSERT!! I searched and searched for a cake that was light and not too sweet - and this was it. Thanks to all the reviewers for their comments. I wasn't going to make the compote, thinking all liquor would be too much, but am I glad I went all the way. Took it to dinner party with people I didn't know too well and they just went crazy. The cake and strawberries look quite ho-hum until you get your first taste; which is quite spectacular.

This is a fantastic recipe. I served it after a Tex-Mex buffet, it was absolutely perfect. The strawberry compote is truly the finishing touch --there wasn't a bit of it leftover.

This cake was a hit at a get-to-gether. I've already passed the recipe on to three people. This cake is so light and has a wonderful taste-you just want to keep eating it, and so did everyone else. The glaze is just like a margarita--a wonderful excuse to keep licking what runs off the cake plate! I too made the mistake of adding all the sugar at once, but had great success. A suggestion would be to added "divided" in recipes where the amount is not used all at once.

Made a beautiful, golden cake with great body. I also made the 'add all the sugar at once' mistake, but the recipe was forgiving. The batter didn't tend to air pockets, like angelfood. This is especially nice when you pour some extra liquid from a well-blended strawberry compote.

I have made this recipe 3 times for many friends and relatives. It is always a big hit. Everyone wants the recipe. I find it is easy to make and never fails. I even made it and put all the sugar in the batter, but I then only put a fourth cup of sugar in the egg white mixture, and it work fine. Enjoy Barbara of Springfield, VA

I made a variation of this for my parents who are on a low fat diet. I made the glaze but used a purchased angel food cake and served it with the compote. They thought it was a great alternative to just plain angel food cake with strawberries.
