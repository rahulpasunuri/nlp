I'd give this 3.5 forks if I could. I am always excited when spring/summer starts to roll around and the tomatoes are fresh enough to make this dish. It's so simple, easy, and delicious. After playing with the recipe a bit, I've found a few modifications that I like best. I stir in about half the cheese and basil into the polenta, and cut down on the oil a smidge. I usually go with just mozzarella for the cheese. I don't like it overly cheesy, and the mozzarella with tomato and basil is a classic combination. Freshness of the ingredients is definitely key.

My sweetheart followed the recipe pretty faithfully, except for adding some chopped pecans. The pecans added a nice twist in terms of flavor and texture. I agree with decreasing the oil by about 1/2-1 tbsp..We would also add extra basil and extra tomatoes. Good veggie meal with a lot of flavor.

This is delicious--I make it often. I usually replace the mozzarella with fontina or edam and only use basil if we have it. I find that I need to cook it for longer than the recommended time if I want to eat it immediately and have it hold together. I also decrease the amount of oil--otherwise its really oily.

This is a simple and tasty dish, but better the next day.

This was really good... but I couldnt help but think it was missing something. Maybe next time I'll reserve the basil from the top until the polenta comes out of the oven, for freshness... and I think I would mix the mozzarella into the polenta... to allow for melting throughout. Definitely going to try this again... and maybe with different cheese combos... I think fontina would do well.

I loved this dish! I added grilled onions and pine nuts.

This was my first time cooking and eating polenta, so I am not sure how it compares to other polenta recipes. I thought it was very easy and had an excellent flavor. The fresh basil is critical and I also added pine nuts, as suggested by other reviewers. Also, I don't have a large oven proof-skillet so I just spread this in the bottom of a 9/13 pan. It was excellent, turned out a little bit like fancy grits.

This was absolutely wonderful, and much quicker to prepare than I thought it would be! I added pine nuts as suggsted by another reviewer--a great touch, and with them it seemed complete. The baked cherry tomatoes had an excellent flavor. Next time I might increase the gorgonzola and decrease the mozz.

Simple & satisfying-- great for a weeknight meal. It did seem to be missing something-- I think I'll try adding olives and/or pine nuts next time.

I always add lots more gorgonzola into the polenta! This dish is fast and easy. Very flavorful too. I always serve it with a salad for a great meal.

This was a really good recipe. I'll definitely be making it again. It was pretty quick too! I think I agree that a few sundried tomatoes and kalamata olives would be good though.

Wonderful! I was hesitant about using gorgonzola as it can be strong, but the result was buttery and smooth. My six year old liked it as well; he regrained from the tomatoes unfortunately. It's a good recipe as is and is basic and simple enough that it could be adapted to your specific likes or what is on hand. Am making it again this Sunday for a potluck. Next time I might add add a few items like olives or possibly sundried tomatoes. Regarding the issue of it falling apart, let it sit for a few minutes before serving. YUMMY!

I followed the recipe except used danish blue (no gorganzola at the store)and it turned out unbelievable good. The cherry tomatoes were sweet/tangy. All the ingredients complimented each other. Fresh basil is a must. Let it cool a few minutes before trying to get out of the pan. I found the first slice still "floppy" but after 5 minutes the other pieces came out easier and retained their shape. This is a definite keeper. Easy to put together other than the whisking, fast weekday meal, beautiful appearance and fantastic flavor. Has it all.

Enjoyed this dish, but would make a few changes... I'd add the garlic (and more of it) right in the polenta when I add the basil. Being a gorgonzola lover, I'd add 1/2 c. in the polenta and the other 4 oz. on top. I just MIGHT add a few more cherry tomatoes, too. Good,easy weeknight meal.

This is heavenly! I usually shy away from recipes that call for multiple cooking steps, but this one was really easy and the results were fantastic. We were having a bit of a basil blight in our area when I made this dish, so I used dried basil in the polenta and saved what little fresh basil we had for the top. I don't think the recipe suffered too much for the subsitution. The leftovers were fabulous for lunch the next day, too!

Dee-licious! Made this as a main course last night for friends and family and they loved it! I served it with a caesar salad with herbed croutons (also from epicurious) for a delicious vegetarian dinner. I used polenta instead of cornmeal, added a few extra cherry and pear tomatoes and kept everything else the same. Good enough for everybody to have seconds. Easy-shneazy and tasty, too.

This was so delicious!!! it looked like a pizza, but the polenta took on a quiche-like texture after it was baked. even just the basil polenta was very tasty - before AND after baking it (i bet it would be very good unbaked under Osso Bucco). but the tomatoes and gorgonzola were the icing on the...well, polenta. you should make this if it sounds even remotely appealing to you.

Easy, good recipe- tasted like a deep dish pizza and I loved using my skillet from stovetop to oven. The gorgonzola adds a great taste. Both my husband and I loved it, and we're not really polenta eaters usually.

Made this last night as a side with grilled Chilean Sea Bass. Wow! It is very much like pizza but better. My husband usually doesn't like polenta but loved this. I will try it with a "polenta" corn meal as was suggested by another rater.

Very quick and easy to make, and makes a nice presentation. I halved it to serve to myself and my husband and we had a lot left over because I served it with broccoli rabe and grilled sausage. This polenta almost looks like a pizza! My husband especially liked it because it wasn't too thick and corn-bread-y like some polentas.

This was very good. My partner and his son do not like polenta, but this was a big hit. I used sungold cherry tomatoes which had great flavor. One note, the first time I made it I used "polenta" corn meal which is not as fine as regular corn meal and the texture was better. Creamy on the top with a nice crunch on the bottom. Takes a little longet to cook and bake. A keeper
