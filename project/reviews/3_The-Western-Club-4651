I created an alternate version with ingredients I had on-hand and it was pretty good: I did not have jalapenos/cilantro on-hand, and instead mixed into the mayo smoked paprika and some hot sauce (tapatio)- that gave it a 'western' taste. Also, it seemed like a lot of bread to consume. You could take a single ciabbata roll, and cut it lengthwise into three slices. I lightly toasted all three.

This recipe is slightly labor intensive but the results are delicious. I found alfalfa and radish sprouts combined to work best. You can use fresh jalapeno but just use less and mince it finely. I make this sandwich often.

This sandwich is really good for no apparent reason. You have to use canned jalapenos (not fresh) for the flavors to work together. You don't taste the jalapeno, the sandwich just has a slightly spicy kick. YUUUUMY!
