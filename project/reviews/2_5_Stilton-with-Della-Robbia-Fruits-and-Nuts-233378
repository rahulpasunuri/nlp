True, it's not a recipe, and true, a photo would be helpful. But the description is quite clear, and the arrangement is simple; the food combinations sound delicious, so a one-fork rating is unwarranted based on a nitpicky technicality.

I think that since this is an arrangement more than a recipe a photo is essential.

To the Cook from Arlington VA, While you are correct, technically it is not a "recipe" but more of an arrangement, there are plenty of folks who do not have the flair that you or I may have and they come here for guidance and direction in how to present certain foods. I think you may be reacting in a somewhat harsh manner. After all, if everyone were so creative or well versed in the art of cooking, sites like epicurious would not be necessary at all.

Okay. I admit that I didn't make this "recipe" since it doesn't seem to be much more than putting a bunch of stuff on a plate. It sounds very pretty, but I wouldn't call it a recipe.
