Made this as a starter for my supper club with arugula from my CSA box. I did all but assemble and bake ahead of time. Everyone enjoyed- easy and delicious!

This is a winner. Great combination of flavors. I add a few drops of good olive oil. I also have used this same combination of ingredients on pizza with great success.

This is a lovely addition to my crostini/bruschetta repertoire. Very tasty. I do agree that a strong cheese can be overpowering. We used an older imported Italian gorgonzola and it was quite zippy.

I served these as part of an assorted bruschetta platter and they got rave reviews. I only wish I'd made a lot more! I brushed the bread with olive oil instead of butter - otherwise no changes.

This recipe has become a standard cocktail party appetizer for us...a real crowd pleaser.

I'm happy to find the arugula recipes. This one is wonderful for snacks with wine/drinks. I sow it and it grows like a weed. Don't pull them up: just cut off the leaves -- they grow out again. A wonderful addition to green salad. (It's somewhere between herb and salad green!)

This was a pretty good Crostini recipe. Don't leave out the butter - I tried it both ways, and it's pretty dry and dull without. I would make this again if I were making an assortment of Bruschetta, but there are other recipes that I love more (Bruschetta with White Beans, Tomatoes and Olives from this site is fabulous.) Contrary to other reviewers, I would use a stronger bleu next time.

Very good and easy to make. I took it to a party and it was a big hit. Be sure to use the milder gorgonzola cheese, though. I used some blue cheese I had on hand and the results were overpowering.

I enjoyed this recipe but for my oven and taste the inital baking time for the bread should have been 5-10 min. Also I servered them as per the recipe and the second batch I added a thin slice of cherry tomatoe on top just after I took them out of the oven, and my company liked this addition but said it was fine without the tomatoe .

These are delicious. They are a big hit at parties and I like that you can do most of the prep in advance. Must try if you like blue cheese. Also I had never had aragula before. It's a wonderful herb!
