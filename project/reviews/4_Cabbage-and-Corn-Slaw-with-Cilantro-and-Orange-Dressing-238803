This dish is simply, summer on a plate! Love this version of coleslaw! Very fresh and crisp. Visually appealing. I also added more cilantro (I am a huge cilantro addict - can never have enough).

Before I make a recipe for company I ususally try it out first and in this case I am very glad I did! The first time I made this recipe as written I thought it was very bland and a little weird tasting. The second time I used some of the suggestions of other reviewers and it turned out great. First, do not use unseasoned rice vinegar -- you must use seasoned! I used half orange juice concentrate and half fresh lime juice. I cut the oil in half. I used a bag of frozen corn and a half bag of shredded carrots and that was easier and worked just fine. Made it the day before and actually though it was better the second day. Again, with the modification I loved it and would definitely make it again.

This was an excellent variation on cole slaw! The citrus dressing was delicious - even my picky husband really liked it. I made the recipe as directed but used seasoned rice vinegar on hand and just eliminated other seasoning. I also reduced the oil by half which is just a personal preference. The dish was light, a little citrusy sweet but not too much. Just really good with ribs. I will be making this all summer!

Crisp, refreshing and colorful salad. I added more cilantro and used regular OJ plus the zest from 1/2 of a large orange. Turned out great. This will be my "go-to" recipe this summer!

This slaw is always a crowd pleaser and people are always surprised at how easy it is to make. It is especially terrific with fresh ears of sweet corn. I make this several times every summer.

It's extremely healthy & colorful. Makes a nice presentation next to other bland color foods. I made my own slaw mixture instead of using 'bagged' slaw. I used the food processor to grate some green cabbage & some red cabbage to equal 16 oz. slaw mixture instead of the bagged kind. I also grated the carrots using the food processor, I used some extra carrots I like them. Someone told me it looked like "a Mexican Fiesta" because it's so colorful. Everyone liked it and took large helpings. The flavor is nice & fresh & summery. Next time I may add a little bit of fresh hot pepper such as some Habanero, jalapeño or Thai chilies, and maybe some 'lime' juice for a little more tanginess. I like a little spice & brightness. I would make this again.

Greatest slaw ever. Made an enormous bowl of this (double the recipe) for the 4th of July and it was ALL GONE half way through the party! I did not used bags of mix. Sliced up a big head of napa and half a head of green instead. Used a little less oil and ended up only using 2/3 of the dressing at all and it was plenty. Make it easy on yourself and bring out your food processer to chop it all up. Hands down...this is AWESOME.

FANTASTIC. Broccoli slaw is a must. Used cilantro and jalapenos. Delicious. Tried another time w/ fresh basil instead of cilantro. Killer! Play around w/ dressing ratios. Could eat this every day. So light and flavorful.

Excellent slaw recipe that can be altered to fit the vegetables at hand. I had half of a napa cabbage and a bunch of small broccoli spears. I substituted the broccoli for half of the slaw mix and it was excellent. I served it for a Sunday family dinner and everyone loved it!

We went to an April Fools Party and brought this instead of the promised bean dip (part of the joke). It was a fantastic complement to the portabello burgers that were served instead of prime rib. Used baby corns instead of kernels to create sophistated look. Also used fresh sqeezed orange juice and olive oil in the dressing. Everyone enjoyed.

I'm always trying and looking for good coleslaw recipes. This is THE BEST! I hand shredded the cabbage (added some red,too) and didn't use the corn, and only about 1/2 the oil. The oj was the key, bright and just sweet enough. It's our new go to. Will make this a lot!

I made this for a buffet dinner and everyone loved it. Instead of bagged slaw mix I sliced a head of cabbage but other than that I pretty much followed the recipe. I was asked for the recipe by three guests so it went over well. It was good the next day too.

I made this yesterday to go with our BBQ chicken for July 4. It was perfect. I prepped the veggies in the morning and kept them in a covered bowl in the fridge. About an hour before we sat down to eat, I mixed up the dressing and tossed it with the salad. People seemed to like it and it complimented the other dishes (chicken, pasta salad, baked beans) perfectly. My changes: I used half the oil called for in the recipe. I also used 1/2 a head of green cabbage, chopped, instead of the bagged slaw mix. And I used seasoned rice vinegar because that was what I had. The leftovers are still in good shape today. I'll be making this again.

I loved this recipe, but will make a couple of changes next time. I thought the o.j. concentrate was way too sweet, so will use 1/2 prepared o.j. + 1/2 lime juice. I also think it can use more cilantro and a little hot sauce or some diced jalepenos. Served on fish tacos and it was fabulous! Used the extra dressing to baste grilled chicken!

Rating: 4
Instead of rice vinegar, try grapefruit vinegar. It gives this slaw a fantastic high-acid, citrus edge which blends well with the orange juice.

This recipe was so good. I made it last weekend and everyone loved it, and I'm not a big coleslaw eater. I add a little more cilantro and Roman noodles! (Just the noodles, not the seasoning) The Roman noodles really gave it an extra crunch. I know I'll be making this one in a few weeks. It's so easy and good for a summer side dish.

I've made this recipe numerous times with rave reviews. I use both fresh and frozen corn depending upon the season. I usually 1/2 the amount of oil call for in the recipe without any noticable diference. This is a really good recipe and nice for something a bit different than regular cole slaw.

I made it for a friend's barbecue and it was a hit. A couple of suggestions.Jalepenos are a must (I would use three next time), added sugar to dressing. THought the orange juice was a bit overpowering and would reduce it a little for next time. Used green pepper instead of red and that was fine. Increased cilantro to a cup.

I've been making this slaw for about a year, once a month all year, 2-3x a month during the summer. I use the pre-cut broc slaw and add the red pepper and corn. I've made lots of different versions and I have to say, using the thawed concentrate makes a BIG difference. I also use seasoned rice vinegar, which means I add less salt. I really love this. It has zing and sweetness and stays crunchy even after 24 hours in the fridge...

Light, crisp, pleasant, fresh and utterly boring. Tastes healthy and adds a nice crunch but not the worth the chopping work that a good slaw should be. Won't make again.

This dish was okay/good - I think it needs some time to marinate so the flavours have time to develop. I added the dressing as directed (about 15 minutes prior to serving) and the cabbage mix seemed quite "raw". Next time I will let it sit longer before serving (make in in the morning and serve it at dinner).

i've made this for our annual BBQ bash the last 2 summers & have received many compliments. instead of drab supermarket coleslaw mix, i use a bagged mix of shredded broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, & cabbage-- very tasty & more attractive than the classic coleslaw mix. this is a beautiful salad so be sure to serve it in a glass bowl!

It was fine. I'm not a big coleslaw fan, but I like a pressed red slaw with a sweet rice vinegar ginger toasted sesame dressing better. I might use more cilantro and more corn. Those things always tend to make things taste better!!

Rating: 4
Had to make a few exceptions because I didn't have orange juice concentrate, red pepper or cilantro. I used 3 limes and their zest for the OJ and mint instead of cilantro. I used a green bell pepper in place of the red one. I didn't use any black pepper. The recipe was unclear whether or not to cook the corn. I took a middle-of-the-road approach and steemed it for 5 minutes. I used about 1 teaspon of salt.

Crowd pleaser! If you want an alternative to traditional or mayo based coleslaws - this is excellent and it goes well with so many main courses - ribs, burgers, chicken, burritos, etc. When I don't have orange juice concentrate I use regular orange juice because I'm ok with it not being sweet.

This was very good, a nice twist on coleslaw, and very easy. I skipped the shredded carrot and purchased 1 bag of slaw with carrots in there and another bag of red cabbage for added color. Everything else to the recipe and it was well received.

I only cook for two, so I halved the recipe. I didn't have OJ concentrate, so I took 1/3 cup fresh OJ and reduced on the stove until I had 1/8th cup. I added equal quanties of oil & rice vinegar, then a squeeze of lime. I also added some chopped jalepeno has suggested by another reviewer. End result - a nice refreshing salad with lots of color and flavor

I've never been a coleslaw fan but I really liked this. The coleslaw mix in the supermarket did not look fresh enough to serve so I made my own with my food processor - took only a few minutes and the colors were so vibrant. I can't get orange juice concentrate readily here in Australia so I used freshly squeezed OJ and that was good. A perfect dish for celebrating Australia Day in the heat of summer.

This is a great coleslaw recipe although I think I will do a bit of tweaking next time I make it. I found the taste of the orange juice concentrate quite strong. I think it would be good to cut it a bit with a splash of buttermilk. I added some cumin as recommended by one reviewer which was good (particularly since I served the coleslaw with a mexican dish). The fresh raw corn is an excellent addition if good sweet fresh corn is available. I might try jicama as well (as recommended by others). A nice side dish for a summer BBQ.

This is a nice variation of the traditional creamy coleslaw that's healthier since it's oil-based. As a shortcut you can buy the shredded carrots in a bag. The thin red pepper strips and carrots make this visually appealing.

This was out of this world good! I omitted the cilantro (selfishly, as I don't love it), reduced the oil by about half, accidentally bought a green rather than red bell pepper (the red would have been more color- contrasting and better) and sub'ed chives for the green onions (the green onions at the market looked pretty sad). I'd get the pepper right next time and try the green onions (the chives were great, though), but this one is clearly a keeper. I had several requests for the recipe. Yummy!!

Really fresh and healthy. I'm not a cabbage lover but this is good. I didn't use orange juice concentrate because I didn't have it so I just used regular OJ. I also cut the oil in half.

Everyone liked it, especially because it's mayo free and the cilantro really adds to the flavor.

This beats all other coleslaw recipies I've tried. Brough it to a 4th of July BBQ and everyone raved, including the kids and I was repeatedly asked for recipe. I did make 3 slight adjustments: I shredded a head of Napa cabbage and 1/3 head purple cabbage instead of using slaw mix; I added julienned jicama; topped with roasted slivered almonds. To the dressing I added the juice of one lime. Try this recipe any time you need a nice, light and crunchy salad

We've made this several times using freshly shredded cabbage instead of bagged coleslaw mix. We use a finer shred than what you usually get in a bag and combine red and white cabbages. Serves as a nice side dish for pulled pork sandwiches and spicey lamb sloppy joes and pairs well with most Rieslings.

I made this for a large group BBQ this past weekend. The slaw got a lot of compliments. The orange dressing is a refreshing complement to something spicier, I made it along with a BBQ chicken recipe from another magazine.

I used garlic scapes in place of spring onions and used a head of fresh cabbage instead of bagged coleslaw mix.
