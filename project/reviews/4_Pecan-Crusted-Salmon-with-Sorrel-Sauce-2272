Wonderful flavors -- the pecan crusted salmon and the sorrel sauce nicely complimented each other. I took the recommendation of another reviewer and baked the salmon at 450, reducing the baking time. I agree that the sorrel sauce doesn't have the most appealing color, but that's compensated by its wonderful light, delicate flavor. I made both the pecan topping and the sorrel as written -- both are wonderful, no changes needed. This is an easy weekday dinner, and an impressive dinner for guests. Definitely a keeper. I served the salmon with roasted yukon gold potatoes and mixed of steamed garlic wax & green beans.

The only thing we did "wrong" is bought 1/2 as much salmon and used all of the pecan mixture on top! This altered the flavor balance between the nuts and sauce and fish, but that was easily remedied by lopping off some of the extra "crust" with our forks. Overall, we loved this recipe. It's super easy and the flavors were unique and delightful. I'd definitely make this for company. The one criticism is that the sorrel sauce is truly uglya murky brownish-greenand I was shocked at how great it tasted. We spooned the sauce on the plates and placed the fish on top of it. Next time I'll add some pretty dots of creme fraiche to break up the puce color of the sauce.

Super yummy! Skipped the sorrel sauce, but loved the pecan topping. Definitely a keeper!

Delicious! Some reviewers have complained about the softer texture of the pecan topping. I found the texture to be a welcome change from some of the rock hard nut crusts I've been served at restaurants. Out of habit, I did roast the pecans in a teflon pan before preparing the topping, to extract more flavor from them. I think the topping was a great compliment to the salmon, and made it wonderfully moist. Sorrel sauce was lovely. Served with roasted fingerling potatoes and the collard greens miniera on this site. Great recipe!!!

Excellent. I first attempted it as part of a multi-course holiday meal. Everyone but the teens loved it, but I doubt it was fully appreciated after two other rich courses. The next day left overs were so very good. It makes for an extremely moist salmon with a series of subtle tastes that enhance, but do not overpower the fish. I used half sorrel and half spinach, but everything else exactly as prescribed. Next time I would perhaps crust the salmon less thickly.

We served this to a friend who is a chef & he loved it. I had both sorrel & dill in the garden - the dill made a good flavor addition to the pecan crust. This time of year wild salmon is not available so we served arctic char - in between salmon & trout. I also used the blender for processing both the crust and sauce & saved us from one more set of dishes to clean.

terrific! didn't have sorrel so used spinach, sauce came out great. added a little brown sugar to the coating per other reviewers, but I would probably leave that out next time. and NO, heavy cream does not curdle if you add lemon or lime juice to it. don't malign the recipe without trying it!

The salmon was tasty. The sorrel sauce, though, was a waste of sorrel. It loses the lemony flavor of sorrel, and if you add the lime juice, it will curdle the cream. I wouldn't waste the sorrel on this.

I made this without the nuts because my boyfriend isn't a big fan of nuts with meat and fish, so basically I just made the herb butter without the nuts and the sorrel sauce and salmon exactly as written. This was my first time cooking with sorrel, as its season is rather short here and thus is not usually available, and I must say I really liked it a lot. While spinach would be good, I think the unique taste of the sorrel is key here in working with the tarragon and basil to create a really interesting effect. I would definitely make it again sometime if I find some good sorrel.

Fabulous! I made this for a small dinner dinner party and served it with fennel mashed potatoes and paired it with a Riesling, it was to die for. I can't say enough good things about the sauce...do not change a thing, don't substitute anything. My guests raved!

In our salmon rich state, I am always looking for great ways to do our fish. This is a wonderful and easy recipe, short on time if you leave off the sauce. However, the sauce is wonderful. I used about 1/3 sorrel and 2/3 spinach to keep the taste more to our liking. I did this up for a "meals on wheels" for a local family along with confetti rice(just added a few chopped red peppers, celery, and green onions for the needed color) along with a green salad and special dessert. Was like a gourmet delivery for 2 shut-ins. We love it too...4 stars in my book.

This is an easy, do-ahead and impressive dish! It is very rich with the topping and sauce, and goes best with a vegie or two that are very plain.....carrots, snap peas, etc. Do be sure and use the sorrel (it is very easy to grow) as it has a tang to it that spinach doesn't have. I convect baked it at 375, and checked it for doneness at 15 minutes. It was delicious using the Wild Salmon that is in season now. Also....I solved the 'lack of color' problem by serving it on very colorful plates!

I love salmon, and I think this is my new favorite way to make it. Very easy, WONDEFULLY tasty. I did as someone below suggested and sprinkled raw sorrel around the fish, which added another level of texture and flavor.

I'm upgrading my rating on this dish from my previous review. Made it again tonight and my husband could not stop the compliments. I served it without the sauce with fresh lime. In this way it is one of the easiest and most reliable entrees you could possibly serve. Remember the colorful side vegetables because the crust on the salmon is brown.

Rating: 4
Even my teens love this dish! I agree that the sorrel cannot be matched by spinach, and a little more is better than the 1/2 cup called for. I also made just a bit more crust for slightly thicker coverage on thicker fillets. Higher temp was also a great idea unless you can convect to crisp it up. I've made this a couple of times now and it pairs beautifully with a full-bodied sauvignon blanc. Quick and easy to make, great presentation.

I lightened the sauce by using olive oil instead of cream (2T). I also used about 3/4 c sorrel. Once blended with a stick blender the sauce as plenty rich and creamy!

I was prompted to make this recipe to use sorrel I've been growing in my garden. A friend supplied the wild caught King Salmon (along with halibut as well) from an Alaskan fishing expedition. It was fantastic and prompted numerous oohs and ahs from our friends and my family. Can't imagine using spinach for the sauce though, as the bright and tart flavor of sorrel cannot be matched. Ate it again the next day and it was even better.

Rating: 3
I have made this both with and without the sauce but it is just as good simply served with generous wedges of lime and brightly colored vegetables to balance the brown crust color. Also leaving a thin rim of the salmon uncrusted makes it look better. Cook hot at 425F for a good crust. Delicious!!

Good. Simple to make. Not my favorite salmon recipe but in the top 5...I like more spicy food.

Rating: 4
At first I was worried how the presentation would be. The drab brown crust with the green sauce didn't look too great. You need to decoratively put the sauce around the fish with a "squeeze" bottle. Don't use too much, the sauce is very rich! I also chopped fresh sorrel and scattered it around the plate. A much needed color contrast. Overall, the dish was fantastic.

Rating: 4
This was great and easy. I will make it for my next dinner party as it can be made mostly ahead of time. I would probably increase the oven temp. even with the convection oven to make a crisper crust but it was great as is.

Rating: 2
Very rich & a little too fussy for today's eating style, I thought. The "crust" (which, as others have written, is more like a pesto) does make the salmon very moist. But I thought you needed either the crust OR the sauce - not both.

Rating: 4
Given other cooks' comments, I allowed the sauce to cook well in excess of 12 minutes. While it reduced down and thickened very nicely, next time I'll reduce the wine and shallots before adding the sorrel. I also omitted the butter from the pecan crust - salmon doesn't need any more fat, placed the salmon steaks on a grill over a pan to allow the moisture to escape, and turned the oven up to 375. The end result was a fabulous dish with a wonderful compliment of flavors and textures.

I have made this several times, even for company, and it's always a big hit. Even people who don't like salmon have loved it. I use fresh baby spinach instead of sorrel, and I serve the fish and sauce over a small bed of spinach -- it helps contains the sauce and adds a nice crunch.

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe several times, for large groups small, and it's a winner every time. The sauce and the fish really compliment eachother. Add a little salt to the crust ingredients. Also, for the sauce, I usually substitute spinach for the sorrel, and it's GREAT! The dish goes great with a rice and wild mushrooms.

Rating: 3
Sorrel, wine, cream and shallots--what more could you ask for? If you love sorrel you'll love the sauce. I would like suggestions on how to get a crisp crust. I assume it is a problem with technique or equipment, not just this recipie. Any ideas?

Easy to prepare - a break from my regular salmon recipe. I also did not make the sauce, and found the crust/spread to be very mild, though tasty. Nothing spectacular.

Finer restaurant quality recipe. Pecan and sorrel sauce was fantastic w/ the salmon. Interesting color scheme for the presentation.

Have to admit I didn't try the sorrel sauce. But the salmon with nothing spectacular.One reviewer said the crust is soft and not crusty at all. The crust doesn't go well with the fish. There are other ways to do salmon.

This dish turned out to be wonderful but was nothing like what I expected. The pecan "crust" is more like a pesto. It stays soft after baking and wasn't at all crustlike. I tasted the sorrel sauce before I served it and I thought it was horrible, so I served it on the side. One of my brave guests tried it with the fish, and it tasted great with the salmon, so I've learned not to judge so quickly. All that said, I'll definitely make this recipe again, as my sorrel plant is going wild!

Rating: 4
The sauce was excellent. I would use it with other fish. Remember to check the fish for small bones and I would cover the fish with the pecan mixture while soft and refrigerate until about a half hour before baking. Very easy to make.

I made this dish (with fresh Northwest King salmon) for Christmas dinner and it was tremendous. My husband said he had never had better salmon. It was very easy to make and not time-consuming.

I made this recipe for a birthday dinner. Everyone LOVED it! Even those who don't care for fish! The pecan crust seemed to seal in the moisture of the fish and really enhanced the flavor. I used spinach for the sauce instead of sorrel and found it bland. I spiced it up a bit by adding garlic and it was a hit. I'll definitely make it again!

I expected a sweeter taste from the pecans, but was disappointed. Pecan-y and rather flavorless, not to mention it was not crust-like, rather spread-like. I used spinach for the sauce, and it was very nice, very unique tasting. The pecan crust and the spinach sauce dont really go together well. I think I'll pass on this salmon dish for the future.

I made this for my book club and they all loved it. I used a side of salmon because I thought it would make a more impressive presentation. I cooked it a little less than the recipe specifies because I like my fish medium to medium-rare.

I did not really like the sauce. The nut mixture added a sweet taste to the salmon which was kinda different. I would make it again but this time I would totally skip the sauce.

WOW! A WINNER!!! Will make it again and again. Made it for a dinner party and everyone was blown away. Made the nut mixture and sauce the night before. Very easy.

I made this on the spur of the moment. I used spinach in the sauce, and also substituted a little minced onion and garlic instead of shallots. It was delicious and a beautiful presentation with the light green sauce drizzled around the pink salmon. I garnished with a wedge of lime and some grape tomatoes.

I personally liked the sauce. I used spinach rather than sorrel because that is what I had on hand. I poured some over boiled red potatoes. It was really good. This was relatively quick and easy with excellent results. I will definitely make it again.

Rating: 4
This was fantastic and so easy. I used light cream for the sauce and it worked great. Even though you don't need a lot of the sauce I would double it next time since it cooked down quite a bit so when I served it to my guests they could take as much or as little as they want.

This recipe was a hit at my dinner party. The sweet toasted flavor of the pecans with the rich buttery flavor of the salmon made this dish memorable, my guests were raving the whole evening. I do agree that the sauce was almost uneccesary. I made flavorful sides that I think should have been made more mild because the salmon is so distinct. Next time I might try a light pilaf and steamed vegis.

This is one of the best salmon dishes I have ever eaten! The sauce is good but not really necessary. I also added the brown sugar to the nut mixture. Just great for dinner parties! Everyone raved!

This is a superb recipe. We grilled the salmon instead of cooking it in the oven and it was wonderful. The sorrel sauce with the pecans is to die for. Instead of cream I used creme fraiche and a bit of milk. It worked beautifully.

I would recommend the sauce, it's really good and you can use it in other fish dishes. I find the crust a little gooey,though. But baking the salmon was a good idea and the baking time (20 mins.) recommended was perfect. I'll do this again but without the topping.

This recipe was fabulous with fresh Copper River Salmon from Washington. It literally melted in our mouths. I adjusted the recipe by adding a bit of light brown sugar to the crust. It was all complimented by fresh asparagus and a nice rice pilaf.

This is my fiancee's favorite dish. I double the amount of pecan topping. It's a great "company" dish because you can prepare it in advance. Make the sauce ahead of time and have the salmon topped with the pecan mixture in the fridge. In Seattle, where salmon is king, this is a show stopper.

Due to shopping faux pas our errand person came home with VERY fresh, whole red snapper instead of salmon (!). We filleted it, and prepared this with the snapper. WONDERFUL!!! We, too, doubled the pecan mixture.

This is a true winner. Use 9 oz. salmon filets and increase (slightly) the amount of pecan crust. Stick with the spinach, but fresh only. Try serving with sauteed cherry tomatoes and steamed basmati rice or a mushroom-barley risotto. For an appetizer I used a Boston lettuce salad covered with thin-sliced mushrooms and a creamy terragon-vinegrette dressing, garnished with sliced ripe olives. Do this right and you will become a legend.

This is a fabulous, fragrant recipe which added a marvellous frisson to my dinner party. I made a few changes, however, doubling the amount of pecan topping because I felt the original amount was too sparse, substituting spinach for sorrel which was not available, and using salmon trout instead of salmon. But the dish was still wonderful. Brava!
