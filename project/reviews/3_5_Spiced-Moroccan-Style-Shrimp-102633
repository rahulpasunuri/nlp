I cut down on the chilies. It was delicious and popular.

This is a good dish although my broiler on my dual-fuel range did not do a good job cooking the shrimp, so I just put them in a skillet to finish them. No reason to use 48 skewers unless your making this as a party appetizer. Use a few large ones for a smaller version of reeipe. Served with a rice pilaf and reduced some of the pepper sauce with some heavy cream for a variation.

I marinated the shrimp in the sauce (minus lime and lime peel). I fried the mixture rather than skewer and served it over rice. I subbed a bit of canned jalepna pepper because I didn't have the chiles. Oops I forgot to do the sesame and green onion, that might have pushed it from 3.5 forks to 4.

Skewers shmooers .... I stir fried the whole works in a really hot wok and served it with plain basmati rice and a spinach salad. Its less than half the work of the hors d'oeuvres version, plus you get a lot more shrimp this way. :o) I used medium sized shrimp (32-36 per lb) and it served four for dinner with a few shrimp to spare.

Excellent!! Liked the spiciness!

I agree with a previous reviewer, the shrimp (and the pineapple for that matter) should be marinated for about an hour, but reserve the lime juice and add it to the marinade just before basting -- the acidity will cook and toughen the shrimp. Wonderful!

I've seen similar recipes -- the thing to do is to make up the sauce, marinate the shrimp in it for a few hours and then baste with leftover marinade during broiling.

Guests loved it, but I felt it lacked zip... the pineapple is essential, and the sesame seeds and green onions make the dish.

My husband made this as an appetizer for our culinary club. It was simply outrageous!!!

I did not have time to let the sauce sit over night, but 10 hours seemed to be OK. I could not find serrano chilies so I had to use minced Jalapeno. I think the final outcome was lacking 'punch' as a result. Next time I will hunt down the real stuff. A few dashes of Habanero helped. This will definately be part of our next cocktail party!

I made this recipe when I was hosting a cocktail party for 35 people and it was by far the most popular dish I made. I followed the recipe exactly except that I put 3 shrimp and 2 pieces of pineapple on each skewer. They were a huge hit and everyone begged me for the recipe!
