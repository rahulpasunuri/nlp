This was a great basic soup. Instead of using diced tomatoes, I used crushed tomatoes. It made the soup a little thicker. I served the soup with parmesean cheese on top and made some garlic toasts as well. Everyone loved this.

Good solid recipe... Anyone thinking this is a "gourmet" recipe... think again. I was looking for comfort food and this was perfect. We spiced it up with some additional beef flavoring, salt and black pepper (not exactly wild and crazy). Aside from that, this is just a good solid recipe. Next time I'll experiment with additional root veggies.

I took everyone's advice and limited potatoes, omited barley, increased fresh vegetables, added wine and can only say this was the blandest vegetable soup I have ever eaten! My old recipes were so much better. This soup needs healthy dose of added herbs and spices.

This is a fabulous soup, almost stew like. I used a cup of cauliflower instead of cabbage and I didn't have dried basil, so I skipped it. I used fingerling potatoes, they held up really well, staying firm even though I kept this on very low simmer all afternoon. About 45 minutes before dinner I added a cup of baby peas and a dash of Worcestershire sauce, then the parsley. A big hit!

Great soup recipe, although I adjusted several things based on earlier reviews.I omitted the potatoes, added tomato paste and used only fresh vegetables including cabbage. I also increased the beef broth and omitted the water. The family really enjoyed it.

What a good, reliable recipe for a hearty winter stew soup (stoup?) when there's not too much fresh veggies available at the market. For the vegetables I used frozen corn & peas, plus the leftovers from a parsnip and instead of the potatoes used leftover roasted potatoes added at the end. Served with homemade dinner rolls.

Per earlier reviewers, I reduced the barley to 1/2 cup, substituted 1 cup of fresh green beans for the frozen vegetables (added about half-way through cooking), and reduced the quantity of potatoes. My husband loved this recipe, and said he will request it often through the winter.

The best beef veg soup recipe I have found to date. I left out the barley and used beef roast seasoning from Penzey's on Black Angus Chuck Roast Meat that I cut myself. Freezes and reheats well. Gets better the next day.

I made this dish for a casual dinner with my neighbors. I was skeptical of using the frozen veggies, but decided I would follow the recipe. My husband thought it would have been better if I left them out. Guests loved it. Everyone asked for the recipe. I would definitely make this again.

I would rate this recipe 4 stars with some changes that I made after reading other reviews. Instead of the frozen veggies I added fresh green beans and corn. I also increased the amount of celery and carrots. I wanted to add kale, but they didn't have it at the grocery store when I was shopping so I used napa cabbage instead. I also increased the amount of stock and used half beef and half vegetable stock. I did not add any water and used a few tablespoons of tomato paste as well. It was really delicious. This is a basic recipe where you can throw most things in and it will still be good. I might throw in peas or edamame next time as well.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe. Only did two things differently, had a half cup of home made red wine, and a tblsp of salt. Otherwise going forward I may decrease the barley amount but it was a very hearty soup.

Rating: 3
This is an excellent soup recipe, although, like other cooks, I left out the potatoes in favor of barely, added red wine and used fresh veggies--cabbage, carrots and onions. I also found that it benefitted enormously from adding a rind from a used wedge of reggiano parmagiano cheese while the soup simmered. This really enriched the flavor.

Rating: 3
Followed suggestions of previous reviewers. Omitted potatoes, reduced barley to 1/2 cup and added a package of thawed frozen chopped spinach (drained) and a cup of fresh green beans half way through the cooking. Consistancy was great. My husband had two bowls with pita bread. I will definitely make this soup again.

Rating: 4
I used 28 oz diced tomatoes (not in juice), and added parsnips and rutabaga. I forgot the cabbage, and didn't have pearl barley, but followed the advice of others and added a cup of red wine. The soup was great, but a little thin. I think I'll add 1/4c or so of the pearl barley next time to tighten it a little. Great recipe.

Rating: 3
I also improvised and the soup turned out great! I added half a cup of red wine after the onions and garlic were soft and simmered for about 5 minutes. Reduced the potato to 1 small yukon gold and half of a sweet potato. Reduced the barley to half a cup. Substituted kale for cabbage and oregano for basil. Completely omitted the frozen veggies and the fresh parsley. Let it refrigerate overnight, heated it up and voila! Rich and delicious.

On this very snowy evening I was looking for a great stew recipe. I cook a lot and this was the most bland recipe I've ever used(and I've used many)! The stock was watery and the veggies uneventful. Would not waste my time on this one again.

Easy and excellent. I omitted potatoes, barley, and frozen veggies, using fresh green beans instead. Thickened by pureeing some of the veggies & broth near the end.

This is by far my favorite soup recipe. I did however change it a bit. I do not use the spuds, barley or frozen vegetables. I add extra cabbage, celery and carrots. Use thyme not basil. For the liquid I use a combo of Vegetable juice, beef broth, chicken broth and red wine. WOW! Always a hit with friends. Make this about once a month.

This recipe closely resembles my mother's vegetable soup which I have always loved. I always use chicken stock instead of beef for a milder flavor and sometimes omit cabbage & barley and add pasta shells. This is also a great base for crab soup - I add Old Bay and crab meat at the end and subsitute frozen corn & green beans for the mixed veggies. You can certainly interchange ingredients with whatever you have on hand. Will make again and again!

I have used this recipe when I've had leftover roast beef or even steak (instead of the stew meat), and simplified it a bit. I don't add the potatoes, cabbage or frozen vegetables, and it is wonderful. It seems using the leftover (and already seasoned) meat adds a lot of flavor. Plus, I know if I freeze some roast beef, it won't go to waste - I'll use it for this soup. Delicious!

I wasn't sure about this soup at first, but it turned out really yummy! I too cut down on the barley and potatoes, used 8 cups of stock, frozen spinach, fresh green beans and zucchini in addition to other ingredients. Great with a crusty loaf of bread on a cold night!

My husband loved this stew. I did cut the barley in half and it still was a thick hearty stew.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I added 2 cups of wine and chicken broth and used chopped spinach instead of cabbage and threw in some cannelini beans and only 1 potato. There was definitely too much barley - I can't imagine how thick it would have been had I put in the required 4 potatoes and extra frozen veggies. I added approprite seasonings and the taste was still blah. It makes me wonder just who these chefs are that create recipes like this.

Love the soup. I leave out the barley and add other vegetables, like lima beans and green beans.

A perfect recipe.......I added alot more cabbage, along with fresh green beans and turnips, which really cooks down nicely along with the other vegatables......the beef cubes cook up so tender they melt in your mouth. Easy and delicious - I'll be making this recipe alot.....my husband and I are big soup lovers!!!

I made this soup, using short ribs instead of stew beef, omitted frozen vegetables, barley and only added one potato. My husband is on low-carbs for diabetes. The soup turned out great and he wants me to make it again the next cold day!

Followed advice of a few raters: skip the Taters (I added 1 can of corn instead), cut the barley in half, and skip the frozen veggies (I put fresh snow peas instead). This came out fabulous!!! I cooked the beef in about 2/1 cup red wine before adding the broth, and it inhanced the flavour big time. This is a keeper.

Rating: 3
This was a very flavorful, hearty soup -- great for a cold fall or winter day. However, as others said, it definitely needs more liquid. I think the next time I make it I will cut the barley in half.

I agree with below reviewer: No Taters, one starch is enough - and - No frozen vegetables, use anything fresh. But other than that, we loved this recipe. Very good.

Good recipe... Imodified it slightly. I already had a big batch of homemade dark beef stock that I made with oxtails, neckbones, and misc stewing bones. After the stock was ready I picked all the remaining meat off the bones and froze it. I used this meat for the soup instead of stew meat. To begin I took the vegetables and sauted them in a little beef fat just to get them going (you can use olive oil). You can use whatever veggies you like - forget the frozen, just choose what's fresh at the market. When they're softened I added them to the pot of simmering stock and then deglazed the pan with a little stock and added that to the soup. Came out great! Also found that you can omit the taters if you use barley; one starch is enough I think.

Rating: 3
I used fresh vegetables rather than frozen, but following the rest of the recipe it was a little bland. Adding 1 1/2 cups of a sweeter red wine and a little Italian seasoning went a long way. If you don't use wine, you will probably have to add some more stock to it since the barley seems to absorb a lot of it

The closest recipe to my mother's soup. I add more tomatoes that this recipe calls for and leave out the cabbage. I get compliments each time I make it

Wonderful comfort food. I omitted the barley, made my own stock (try to avoid the salty canned), and went with fresh vaggies rather then the frozen. Kids and hubby loved it!

A good, basic soup. I omitted the barley, but didn't miss it. Could really use this recipe with any leftover vegetables in the refrigerator.

This recipe has all the right ingredients , but I made mine in the classic Italian way of sauteing all my ingredients as for Minestrone. I also used "American Bacon" instead of Pancetta, because I didn't have any in my pantry. OK How many Americans out there have a couple pounds of pancetta in their fridge ...OK I rest my case . Anyway I sauteed all the veggies for a couple of mins till they looked sauteed [ this brings outta the flavora , you know what I'm saying ? What you think I'm funny ? Was so Funny ? What you talking to Me? I said YOU Talking TO ME? OK I'm sorry I slipped into my Italian gangster character and got carried away.

I did not like this soup at all. I knew better than to use frozen vegetables so I used fresh. I "fixed" it as best I could with additional red wine, garlic, worcestshire sauce, and other spices but I found this soup to be terribly bland. It does not live up to the "Epicurious Standard" that I've come to expect from this site. I would not make it again.

I made this for a Christmas party and got rave reviews. I added one diced potato a cup of red wine (gave the most amazing aroma and rich taste). It was fabulous to dip bread in. Definitely a winner!

Delicious! I used suggestions below - and used 2 cups beef broth, 3 1/2 cups chicken broth, 28 ounce can tomatoes, 1 1/2 cups red wine instead of water. Didn't use any frozen veggies - instead used caramelized onions (2 large), a parsnip, and the rest according to the recipe. Cooked it up in the crockpot (next time I won't add the barley at the beginning). Results were very very yummy. Will definitely be making this one again!

I'm pretty much a beginner cook so I made the recipe as written. However I would agree with the previous more experienced cooks who somehow knew not to put in the frozen vegetables at the end. Next time I'll be sure to leave them out. Other wise the soup was quite enjoyable.

Very good. It's the kind you can use as a "master" recipe and use any kind of vegetables you prefer. I salt (kosher salt) and peppered the beef (used chuck roast)before browning it and used extra garlic. I did not add potatoes, cabbage, parsley, or barley, nor did I add frozen vegetables. I used a package of baby carrots and the celery, the two bay leaves, and used thyme instead of basil. I used 2 cups of beef broth and 3 1/2 cups of chicken broth, and added a 28-oz can of whole tomatoes in their sauce (break up tomatoes with your spoon); the extra cup of water is not necessary. After it came to a simmer, I dumped it into a preheated crockpot and left it on high for 4 hours, so it makes a great crockpot recipe as well -- very convenient.

Amazing! Makes you realize just how lousy canned soup is. I did add celery to the recipe, substituted barley for chewy Scottish oats and--shame on me--used beef bouillon cubes instead of stock, but had no regrets except that it was a little salty. Added water to adjust but it needed a little more liquid anyway. It made so many servings I had to freeze and refrigerate portions. When reheated, it didn't taste anywhere near as good. Apart from the freshness which was gone from the veges, the potatoes, etc. had neutralized the salt somewhat so it was bland, and the oats had absored the liquid and become soggy. When I make this next, I will add salt and oats only to the portion I am about to serve.

I really liked this soup, but made a couple changes. I completely eliminated the frozen vegetables in the last step. The soup was very thick due to the barley, so the extra frozen vegetables would have been too much. I also added about 1/3 cup of red wine as some of the other reviewers suggested and it was great!

Disappointed that it was so bland. Also, frozen vegetables didn't cook in "... simmer for 10 minutes". Box called for ten minutes in boiling water. Open for suggestions to improve the recipe.

This was a really good soup on a cold night! The few changes I made were to omit the barley, use a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes and instead of the mixed frozen vegetables I used a 10 oz bag of frozen green beans and 10 oz bag of frozen corn. I also used sirloin instead of regular stew meat and used fresh basil because I had some in my yard. The red wine a couple of readers suggested added a nice flavor also. I had my 10 year old daughter and 2 of her friends over and they loved the soup. One friend kept going back again and again till she had eaten 5 bowls! Now that's good! Oh, one other thing. Being from Louisiana we all added a bit of tabasco for spice. Perfect!!!!!

This was one of the best soups my family has ever had. The only thing I changed was the stewing beef, I used Top Sirloin Steak instead.

This soup was easy and delicious. It was a lovely fall beef and vegetable soup. I added about a cup of cabernet, and did NOT put in the frozen veggies (ugh!) as the fresh fall produce was just too wonderful to ruin. For example, instead of green cabbage, I used the milder leafier Napa cabbage, and threw in a yam also along with about 10 peppercorns. It came out superbly.

This recipe is delicious. For people who are looking for a "starch free" alternative to this soup, I have a tasty version. Omit the potatoes and the barley. Increase the canned tomatoes to the 28 ounce size and add 1-2 cups of red wine. (Cabernet Savignon is best. Merlot works, but can be a bit wimpy!) Cook the soup for 2 - 3 hours- it's delicious!
