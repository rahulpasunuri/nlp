A great recipe! A super way to dress up plain mashed potatoes. I like to add rosemary as well. I added less butter than the recipe called for but made up the difference with some milk! I have made this with red potatoes (with skin) too and it is also very good!

Very easy and tasty. Looks pretty. Basil, parsley and chives are a great combination.
