I have the cookbook "Seriously Simple". This is a great stand-by recipe that we make on a regular basis. I highly recommend trying it, and also letting go of any preconceptions that the misleading title of the recipe "Tandoori-Style Chicken" might make you think of.

I did not like this recipe at all. Pretty bland.

To everyone who has commented that this recipe sounds nothing like Tandoori: you are absolutely right. This recipe has zero similarity to tandoori. I made this for dinner the other night, and while the chicken was good, it lacked the infusion that tradition roast chicken with lemon and garlic provides. The marinade didn't seep into the meat AT ALL (perhaps because it is yogurt based?). On the other hand, the potatoes were marvelous! I would make the potatoes with the marinade again in a heartbeat. Perhaps next time I would try the marinade on boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken.

But has anyone tried this recipe yet? I immediately added cumin and garlic to my seasoned salt and am marinating the chicken for a bit. Will advise...

Epicurious.com (and a few others) are my "go to" when looking up/referencing/finding something new/peruse when inspired....this recipe, however, I laughed aloud... Tandoori-style what? Agreed w/ the comments referencing yogurt... Oh well, maybe there was a typo (or two, or three, or, uh four), then again "Seriously Simple Deck"....

I agree with the other reviewer... I haven't tried it either, but as someone who's been cooking North Indian food for the last 10yrs, I don't have to cook it to know that Yogurt and Salt do not make a "Tandoori" style chicken.

I have to agree. There are not nearly enough of the traditional seasonings in that seasoning salt to justify calling it Tandoori. 2 1/2 teaspoons for a whole chicken? The last time I made Tandoori the recipe called for 2 Tablespoons of crushed garlic and grated fresh ginger each. That's before the cumin and everything else. Well, maybe that's why they call it Tandoori-Style, right?

Tandoori-Style?? What?? Okay, I haven't tried it, but I know tandoori well, both the more-or-less genuine attempts at cooking it at home and the real thing cooked in a tandoor. And there is no way that, except for the yoghurt, this comes anywhere near either one of those. So maybe it's good, or maybe it's not, but please don't think it will taste anything like tandoori chicken.
