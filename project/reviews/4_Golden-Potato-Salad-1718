An aside, don't leave the radishes out, a very nice counter balance to the sweet pickles.

Growing up in Minnesota I've eaten a fair amount of potato salad during my life. This salad is my favorite so far. Perfect balance of potatoes and veggies and not drowning in sauce. Not too tart or sweet, a classic. Make it a day ahead as the flavors meld.

This was great! I used a few ideas from Viginia as well. I agree with Golden, Arlington, that was uncalled for...

Very good, I am always looking for a potato salad close to my Grandma's (she had no recipe) and this is really good.

Delicious! Made as written but added fresh water chestnuts 'cause there were a few in the fridge.(Sorry, Cook from Golden - get over yourself.Go read a cookbook - alone.)

Great potato salad, and a thank you to the Cook from Virginia who took the time detail out the adjustments made. I used a few, and appreciated the info. To "A Cook from Arlington," the cook from Virginia just shared their substitions like everyone else does on this site; hardly using this site to *gasp!!* "promote" a personal recipe. PLEASE don't use this site to unleash you control freakish nature onto the cooking world. You're a nut.

Trational and good. Note to "a cook from Virginia" Your recipe sounds interesting but PLEASE let's review the recipe that's presented here vs using this space to promote your own completely different recipe.

Made this for a party, doubled the recipe with no problems. Left out the radishes & used cream instead of milk. Will definitely make it again because everyone loved it !

Big hit. Sprinkled paprika over the top to give it a little more color. Yum!

Had big backyard summer party. It got rave reviews. I made some changes: 1. I doubled it for our party. 2. I did not add radishes. 3. I added chopped black olives. 4. I only used one  big  red onion, instead of two. 5. I used Yukon Gold potatoes. 6. I added one large minced jalapeno chili for some kick. 7. I added some minced parsley to give it some color. 8. Go easy on the milk. 9. I used part regular mayo and part Miracle Whip  not too much, its sweeter than mayo. Got a bunch of requests for the recipe.

Excellent. Used sour cream instead of milk. Don't care for radishes, so used red pepper instead. Also, increased potatoes to 5 lbs. and decreased remaining vegies by half.

Tasty and not too complicated - everything a potato salad should be. Definitely peel the potatoes, though, or the leftovers won't taste as good as they should.

I misread the amount of dried mustard and put in 3 tablespoons rather than the 3 teaspoons--my guests loved the wasabi-like effect.

I've been making this potato salad since 1992! An "anything but ordinary" poatato salad! Guests love it.

My first time making this recipe was a hit. It was easy to make and my guests enjoyed the flavor the pickles and radishes imparted in the salad. I would definately make this salad again.
