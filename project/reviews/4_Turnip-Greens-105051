Used Ham Hock and shredded ham and kept all the juices. Cooking longer made the greens very tender. Delicious!

Just discovered turnips in my organic produce subscription. This was a great way to enjoy the whole veg. I'm a pescatarian and instead of the pork, threw in one or two boullion cubes and was happy with the result.

Made this without salt pork, salt or bacon fat. Simply added a couple of teaspoons of Penzey's Ham Soup Base to the water. Cooked it considerably less than 45 min. More like 20. Came out with a good smoky flavor. No way did I discard the liquid. We dipped our corn bread in it. Good accompaniment to BBQ'd chicken.

Everything sounds right, but, pour out the pot liquor ? No way.

Good Ole Southern Cooking, Cook the greens a little longer and they will melt in your mouth.
