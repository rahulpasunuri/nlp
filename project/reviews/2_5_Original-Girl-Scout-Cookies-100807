I haven't made these yet, but I looked up the recipe on another site that has the whole girl scout history- it said to add 1 teaspoon salt....that might be the problem... http://www.girlscouts.org/program/gs_cookies/cookie_history/early_years.asp

cookies tasted fine, but they were nothing exciting. Make these if you are in the mood for boring.

I'm in favor of the girl scouts, but not these cookies. I followed the recipe to the last measure and they just came out too cakey, am I doing something wrong or is that how they are supposed to be?
