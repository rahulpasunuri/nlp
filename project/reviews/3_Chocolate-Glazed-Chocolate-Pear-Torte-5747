Good basic recipe. My suggestions? Skip the pears. Use applesauce. Double the brandy. The almonds are tasty and good for you. Add more. Only use 6 ounces of baking chocolate. For a gluten-free version, use almond, rice or potato flour. The glaze is excessive. Leave it out.

Made this recipe with a few changes on the fly. Store didn't have dried pears, so substituted in dried mangoes. And ran short on time so did a simple topping rather than the glaze called for. And both mods turned out well, I think. Definitely tasted the mangoes unlike the comments here about not tasting the pear. And the topping was fine although I'm sure the glaze would have been even more delicious.

Fabulous! I do agree that the pear flavor was a little hidden, but it definitely was there, and all of my guests for Christmas dinner loved it.

It promised to be dense and moist, and it was, but I found that it was too much so for my taste, and I agree that the pear flavour was entirely too hidden.

I made this for Thanksgiving. I put chocolate curls on top of the cake instead of the gold leaf. It was very rich and very moist. But it was not good as similar recipes.The pear flavor did not come through and it was too "fudgy".

Yes, it is dense, but then it's an almost flourless chocolate cake. I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a great success. I put canned pear halves on the top which was also nice. I have also made this for Passover, just substituting matzo flour for the regular flour and it worked very well.

I used a can of light syrup pears since I found no dry ones and works just fine. My best friend is a chocolate lover and this was the best she has ever had!!

very dense ...way too many bowls and dishes involved for the end product.
