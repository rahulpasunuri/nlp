I usually make strawberries with balsamic vinegar and this is actually much better because it's not tart. I was afraid it would be too alcoholic but after the maceration, it came out delicious.

My favorite! And it's easy. I top it off with whipped cream.

Really good dessert to serve after a heavy meal. Light and elegant.
