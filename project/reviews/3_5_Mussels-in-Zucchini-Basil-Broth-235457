This recipe is a good, creative use for basil and zucchini. I liked the body of the sauce. However, I found that it lacked depth of flavor and was more time consuming and less enjoyable than a simple combination of shallots, parsley, white wine and mussels. I did not have a problem with tough mussels -- texture was great!

Outstanding! Can be served over angel hair pasta or have a nice crusty bread for dipping with a salad. Did not make mussels any less tender putting them into a cold liquid insteading of boiling first,which was plesantly surprising. Very quick and simple. My husband does not care for mussels but raved over this recipe. It is definitely a keeper.

Okay so I know that we all get really offended when someone enters a review without having first made the recipe...but, I really had to do this today. That said, this recipe seems destined for failure due to the cooking method for the mussels. You should never put mussels into a cold liquid that will then slowly come up to the boiling point. You will end up with mushy mussel meat. I would strongly recommend to bring the puree to the boil and then put your mussels into the covered pot. There are too many that do not like mussels, and this recipe will add to that group unless you use the correct cooking method.
