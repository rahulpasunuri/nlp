Very fast & simple, but very tasty. This recipe has both of my kids asking if I'll please make lima beans when we make out our meal plan for the week.

Isn't it silly to give four forks to simple cooked frozen lima beans? But something about this is really, really good. And I didn't think I liked lima beans.

This is easy enough for a week night and nice enough to serve at a dinner party. Since the frozen lima beans said to cook for 7-9 minutes and I wanted to end up with no liquid, I boiled 1/3 c water with the garlic and then added the lima beans, olive oil, and parsley - cooked at a rolling boil to eliminate the liquid by the time the lima beans were done (probably 10 minutes). Added olive oil and parsley at the end. I was afraid it would be too much parsley, but it was good! Next time I may use chicken broth instead of water, but it was delicious as-is. My honey and I agree that we need to keep a package of lima beens in the freezer from now on.

Ok, I have to admit that the ingredients do not seem that interesting but this dish is definitely a homerun! I used about 3/4 cup of water to ensure it would be less "soupy" and it really turned out great. It is a simple dish with delicious flavor.

I used the dry bean you soak over night and I guess I let this cook on low heat for like 3 hours. Wow this is a great soup for a cold day like today.

I make this dish from time to time. I usually add artichokes and instead of parsley I use dill and add a splash of lemon.

Hated lima beans, loved this recipe, and now I'm a convert. This is absolutely wonderful, and so simple. The only things that I would change are to use a bit less water, cut the amount of olive oil in half and throw in a small amount of butter just before serving. Opa!

This is fabulous - and I don't even like lima beans. I make this for office potlucks people love it! I like a wee bit more garlic so at the end I add 1 tsp of minced garlic. Also know of someone that used soybeans (the shelled frozen kind) with equal success.

This recipe is quite delish, and super easy. It's actually ridiculous how these simple ingredients can make something so mouth-watering. This changed my husband's opinion of lima beans forever!

The dish does not have any distinct flavor. I don't think it's any better than lima beans seasoned with butter and salt and pepper. The amount of oil does not make it lowfat either. I'll stick to the traditional Southern way of cooking butter beans.

I thought these were really tasty and simple. I also had some cabbage that was getting old, so I threw that in the pot, too, and it helped break up the monotonous texture of the limas. Really good.

I'll make this again, and again, and again! Not a single bean left behind.

I happen to love lima beans but my husband son don't. This dish however should win over even the most difficult lima bean haters! Delicious!

i can't believe it. i really liked this! saute the garlic and stir in the parsley after simmering the beans in water only, though. a nice change!

To cut back on fat I used 1 tbsp oil in cooking and no extra, and the beans disappeared so fast I should have made a double batch!

Another delicious variation on this recipe to try is to sautee onion, add lima beans, fresh tomato, salt, pepper and fresh mint.

Yum! I always thought lima beans were the liver of veggies, but this recipe is delicious. I used frozen baby limas and the texture came out like regular beans, not dry like what I'm used to. This dish is so good and simple that I'm a lima bean convert.

To the unidentified cook, please keep your ignorant opinions to yourself. If a simply prepared vegetable recipe doesn't appeal to you, then accept the fact that you don't like that particular vegetable and KEEP IT TO YOURSELF!

This looks pretty nasty, when someone tries it let me know what you think!
