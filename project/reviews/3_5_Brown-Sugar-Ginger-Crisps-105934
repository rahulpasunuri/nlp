The texture is great, very crispy but definitely needed more ginger to taste gingery. All mine came out the same size, nice and flat. I would definitely make these again.

We have been making this cookie every year since it was originally published. It is the perfect cookie to make, it keeps well, and is delicious! I also appreciate the fact that it is not chocolate or peppermint or another tired old flavor. It is unique!

This has been my favorite Christmas cookie since day 1. It is simple to make and tastes wonderful. It has a very unique flavor and has a very refreshing flavor with the ginger. It doesn't have the same old heavy butter cookie flavors that many Christmas cookies have.

I thought I was just making these for my husband until I tried one--these are the best cookies of any sort that I have ever tasted--the little bits of ginger give the right amount of chewiness to the middle, but the cookies themselves bake up crispy and paper thin. FYI I used self rising cake flour and brown sugar that I had to grind up with a mortar and pestle because it was rock hard. Also used some ancient Williams Sonoma crystallized ginger that I've had for ages. Who knows if any of those were mitigating factors to the amazing outcome of the cookies, but if it helps another cook get the outcome of what I just tasted...

These are delicious -- buttery and chewy -- and were the favorite choice of many people I gave them to. HOWEVER I found it very difficult to control the shape of the cookies. Sometimes they spread thin (and were unevenly colored), sometimes they were little lumps. They were always good, though. It seemed as if packing the dough together and letting it sit -- or even chill -- a bit helped somewhat. Also, in most cases, 10 minutes seemed to be enough cooking time.

This is a spectacular cookie and easy to make. It is not "beautiful" to behold, but we didn't care - they were inhaled by everyone. My recipe made less - I only got about 60 small cookies out of it. They sometimes spread very thin when cooking; I just took a rubber spatula or butter knife and pushed the edges back while the cookies were still warm. Highly recommended.

I ADORE these!! They have become my favorite cookie. They are the perfect combination of crispy and chewy, buttery, sweet, and spicy. On top of that, they're easy to make!

Fantastic! So rich and buttery. Did as others advised and used 1 teaspoon ground ginger. But I only used 1/4 c of the crystallized ginger, because that's all I had. I will make them exactly the same next time...they're perfect.

A plain looking cookie with a a surprisingly rich and spicy taste.

I've made these cookies several times and I've always gotten rave reviews! Crystallized ginger can be expensive it tne grocery store, but look for it at discount stores (I hope I'm not violating the epicurious.com review rules, but Trader Joe's sells it at a reasonable price).

These were quite tasty! Nice crisp texture. They are not terribly spicy on their own, so I doubled the amount of ground ginger and added extra crystallized ginger. It gave them a nice bite!

these cookies were definitely not crisp in my experience (they spread out very thin, but were still). but who cares, they were also very delicious. one note is that they are not the most gingery cookies ever. despite that i used all the powder & crystallized in the recipe, someone commented that they tasted more like butter cookies than ginger.

Wonderful cookies. However, I increased the amount of ground ginger from 1/4 to a full teaspoon, because otherwise they would be plain cookies with lumps of ginger in them. These went down very well and vanished from the kitchen within a day.

Delicious - and they make your house smell great! I only had 2 oz of crystallized ginger, so I added 1 tbsp of fresh grated ginger, which really made the flavor come alive. I sprinkled the cookies with cinnamon just before cooking - yum!

I loved this cookie. The cripsy texture and ginger flavor make it the best cookie I've made in years. I want to make it again, but smaller. I used a scoop and they were big! Nothing wrong with that, but I'd like to try a smaller version to fit better on my holiday cookie plates I take around the neighborhood.

This is a delicious cookie. My family and co-workers could not stop eating them. I substituted the dried ginger for about 2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger and made them bite-sized. They only need to bake for about 10 minutes at this size. A great cookie!

One of the best cookies I've ever made or eaten. Everyone loved them.

A very interesting, different cookie. The crunchy crisp was entertaining, and the ginger flavor was very sweet and subtle. Tasting them right out of the oven (and be careful not to burn any tongues) was even better - the cookies crackled and sizzled! Overall, it felt like it was missing that tiny something that makes recipes four forks -- maybe I should try again with even more ginger.

These were easy and a HUGE hit. Popular at Christmas, but I've been making them since as well and everyone asks for the recipe.

A standby cookie for me - since making it for the first time in December, 2001, I've made at least 10 batches, most as gifts. The NY, NY cook said that the recipe makes fewer than stated - I agree. I've increased the amount of chopped crystallized ginger to 3/4 cup to good effect, and have twice swapped fresh grated ginger, about a tablespoon, for the powdered ginger. The switch made a slightly wetter batter but no overall change in the texture of the finished cookie, and both alterations elevate the ginger taste. Great recipe - thanks, Gourmet, for reprinting it.

A definite must at Christmas time. These are light and very flavorful. My daughter has made these 4 times in the past month...testament enough?

I form the dough in a roll using plastic wrap and either chill it or sometimes even freezing it for later use. You can then cut 1/4" slices and bake according to instructions.

Because of the previous reviews, I used 1/4cup less flour so the cookies would be shorter. They were! I didn't have crystallized ginger so i diced a cup of dried pineapple and used that instead. that too was delicious. If you follw directions and make each cookie a heaping tespoon, you will only get two dozen - not five.

they have a sweet and kind of spicy taste, they are just extremely delicious. my family ate them hot from the oven because they smell great.

Check out Epicurious web site where this recipe recieved good reviews. I use 2 tsp of ground ginger and flatten cookies with a fork. It's a delicious cookie, especially for anyone who likes ginger.

After being listed as one of Gourmet's favourite cookies, I was disappointed that these were just edible. Nothing special and they either spread out too much, or not enough. Tollhouse cookies are much better.

These did not make the expected amount and did not spread when baked to make crisps. They are more like shortcake. Is there too much flour? I notice two other reviews with same comment --- was there a type-o in the recipe? Thanks.

My husband and I loved these cookies. They didn't spread out as much as in the picture, ours were a bit thicker, but both of our co-workers loved the cookies. I will be making these again.

I made the cookies according to the directions-cookies spread and became thin. They definitely did not look like the photo. I wonder if there was an error with the recipe. I do a great deal of baking-and I could not figure out the problem. I'd be curious about the experience of others making the recipe. Great taste.
