i was not looking for a jewish cuisine recipe, but found this to be an excellent easy fish dish that matched my pantry requirements. out of foil, i made it with parchment twisted over the top of a dish. worked great. the only thing i would change is the lemon slices - they made the sauce too bitter for me. i would juice the lemon instead and add to the liquid. otherwise, a perfect fish dish with the veggies perfectly cooked!

This recipe was very good. My 5 year old son loved this as well and he's a tough critic. I also increased the cooking time by 4 minutes and added extra garlic. Because this is made inside a large foil packet everything steams perfectly and the clean up is a snap.

I made this recipe and it was wonderful! I also did this recipe with other white fish....I love halibut but this recipe works well with cod too!

This was excellent. I served it at Passover and everyone raved about it. A big improvement over the traditional Gefelte fish which only a few of us like. I too cooked it a couple of minutes longer as it did not seem to get warm enough to finish cooking after only 12 minutes. It comes out looking beautiful when plated.

This is a great and tasty recipe. It's very convenient because you make it the day before. I added extra garlic-- 4 cloves instead of 2. Needs a bit more time to cook than is listed in the recipe. It is served cold, which some don't like, but if you're okay with that, it's delicious!

THIS FISH IS VERY TASTY, I ADDED FRESH BASIL & SALT AND FRESH GROUND BLACK PEPPER TO THE FINAL OLIVE OIL DRIZZLE.
