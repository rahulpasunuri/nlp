I make this fairly often and there is never any leftovers. I noticed from the reviews and also from the "at a glance" that many folks are using bell peppers in various colors. This is a mistake. It really needs cubanelle peppers instead.

Classic tapas dish, lovely. I forgot the jalapenos and indeed the white wine, but didn't miss them. I parboiled the potato pieces before frying them with (less) olive oil, onion, garlic, pepper and chorizo. I also forgot to season the dish, but it really didn't need any more salt, nor pepper really.

Different spin on a potato salad. Followed the recipe, except didn't quite understand the instructions for cutting the potatoes so I just cut them in 1 1/2" cubes.

A fairly easy recipe that packs a lot of flavor. Some suggestions--use smoked chorizo (it has spanish paprika in it) and toss some queso fresco on top to add some different flavors and textures.

This was very tasty, although a bit more work than I had expected. You don't need so much oil, especially with the chorizo. I even used veggie chorizo and it was still plenty oily. I didn't have enough peppers, so I added some halved cherry tomatoes at the end. Nice and colorful!

Excellent recipe. I left out the potatoes and added regular white rice and a pinch of saffron. I also added a half of a small can of diced tomatoes. My husband loved it. It was also the perfect recipe to make using our frying and jalapeno peppers from our garden!

Delicious! I'm making this for the second time tonight. I use a yellow pepper because we don't like green ones. The yellow looks nice with the rest of the ingredients, too.

Yum! I used only 1/4 cup olive oil and added a red pepper. It was delicious.

Great recipe. I used roasted red peppers instead of fresh. Good company side dish.

I made this as it was written with one exception - I used home made roasted red peppers instead of the fresh peppers. It was excellent! The jalapeno gave just the right amount of heat and warmth to the dish. I'd definitely make it for company. I used cured dry chorizo.

Awesome! The only change I made was to halve the chorizo lengthwise and cut it into 1/4-inch slices. It was a bit oily, but that can be fixed the next time I make this - which I definitely will!

We loved this! Some alterations I made was sticking the potatoes, while cooking the peppers, onions, and chorizo, into the oven to crisp them up a bit. We also used regular jalapenos instead of the chiles. Great flavor! Very filling!

have not tried the recipe but, in response to stotts of chicago question regaqrding prep of potatoes; their tailgaters, probably too drunk to be trusted with a knife

Can anyone explain the concept of breaking the potatoes? Can't you just cut them?

This was really delicious as a main course with some extra chorizo and a tomato salad on the side. I used a red pepper and substituted sherry for the white wine.

Really enjoyed this. Made as part of a tapas dinner that included Peel-and-eat Hot Pepper Shrimp, Pizzette with Fontina, Tomato, Basil and Proscuitto and Spicy, Steamed Clams, all found on this web site.
