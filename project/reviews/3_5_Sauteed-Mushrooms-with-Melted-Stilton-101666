This was pretty good and I did eat it. Only thing I changed prior to cooking was that I used a different cheese as I don't like blue cheese, and I lowered the amount of cheese. The only changes I would make if I was to make it again is to further reduce the cheese (there was even too much in it for my partner who i catch eating blocks of cheese by themselves so that's saying something), and I'd add more cream, not season with salt, just pepper, and chop the mushrooms up more so it turned out more like a soup. It was delicious the way it was, but I think it'd be great once I change it a little further

Very very tasty. It was quite rich and filling so next time I'll use it as an entree.

I have made this a couple of times, and each time it has enjoyed rave reviews. I also cut down on the amount of Stilton and used leftovers over pasta. Wonderful!

I took the advice of previous cooks and just added enough stilton to barely cover the top. After baking I served this over an omelet. It was great.

I scaled down the recipe, as I had neither a half-pound of mushrooms nor a half-pound of stilton, and wound up with one good meal. I was out of bread, so I wound up crushing some crackers into the sauce to soak it up, which worked well. This would be good over rice, or perhaps even as a pasta sauce.

I am a Stilton lover and am always looking for new ways to enjoy it. This is fantastic! Don't plan on having much else with this, it is rich. I suggest a good tawny port to accompany.

I had a strong stilton in the fridge, so decided to try this. We love blue cheeses, but this was just too much of it. We would have preferred it with a lighter blue cheese and possibly a bit less cheese as well. As is, neither my husband or I could eat more than 1/3 serving.

Try this with Nauvoo Blue Cheese-the fresher the better. This is the freshest and lightest tasting of all the blue cheeses. It's been around for at least 75 years. You don't need cream. Whole milk is even better because the taste seems to be lighter and you can enjoy the taste of the mushrooms. You can lighten up on the garlic also. If you want to roll over like a dog on his back with a new bone, serve this over grits. Don't be afraid to use more mushrooms. If you really want to experiment, try this with some fairly sharp cheddar and reduce the amount of the blue cheese by the amount of the cheddar.

We liked this but thought the amount of cheese could be reduced. It was good, though, and it was a nice side. I may try it with gorganzola next time though, stilton can be a little over powering.

Great recipe to make for a group appetizer. Both my book club and bunco group couldn't get enough!

We enjoyed it, but for those watching their fat and sodium intake, it's a bit too much. Any ideas on how to lighten it up ??

WOW! Stilton lovers rejoice, this one's amazing! This is so easy and so good. Make sure you've got lots of nice fresh bread or crusty rolls on hand because you won't want to miss a drop of this sauce. Beware though, this is surprisingly filling!!
