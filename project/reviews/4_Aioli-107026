This is great -- so easy (if you follow directions), and really doesn't take more than a few minutes. I did it with a hand whisk, and would agree with other reviewers -- they key is to add the first 1/3 of the oil REALLY slowly. After that you can pour it in pretty quickly without any separation issues. I also added a few pinches of saffron to ours, and just served it with tapas. Delicious!

I will never buy mayo again!! I have made this recipe several times and it is delicious as well as versatile. I added fresh basil right from my garden....absolutely amazing.

For a 5 minutes/quick version of this recipe, use a mortar and pestle for the garlic then combine all the ingredients in a bowl and use an immersion hand blender.

used this in a pinch for potato salad and chicken salad when i was out of mayonnaise. (no, i'm not a great planner, but a good chef...?) it was really good. used tarragon oil instead of regular olive oil, and added fresh tarragon to the finished product. also used spicy brown mustard instead of dijon because - you guessed it - i was out. still a great and easy recipe that i will use again - hopefully next time on purpose.

Wonderful flavor. I thought I had overdone it with the garlic and salt when I tasted it plain but it was fantastic on roasted turkey sandwiches. A previous reviewer mentioned it took 30-40 minutes to whisk, which isn't necessary. This was my first time making an aioli and it took me about 20 minutes, but it came together very quickly at the end. I'm

Forgot to add that I put everything but the oil in my mini processor, then slowly drizzled the oil into the mix until a nice emulsion was met.

Used this aioli for my 'Gastropub' burgers. Was scrumptious! Thought it was a bit heavy on the garlic when tasting it plain, but the flavors really melded well when the burger was all assembled (brioche bun, aioli, carmelized onions, sharp white cheddar, greens, tomato).

This is delicious and rich-- and more subtle than I had expected it to be. Very easy to make. I'm staying with relatives who had no prepared mustard. I added about 1/2 tsp. mustard powder and a dash of red wine vinegar to make up for the lack of prepared mustard and it stayed emulsified just fine.

A simple and delicious Aioli! This recipe is a consistent crowd pleaser. Herbs, such as basil, can also be incorporated easily to add complexity to the flavor. Great as a sauce for steak or prime rib sandwiches.

I make this whenever I make tapas or paella. The first time I made it, I tripled the recipe and drizzled the oil in super slowly, and my forearm cramped up :) Now, I pour in the oil slowly. No need to drizzle it in--it turns out great with just 2-3 minutes of whisking. I put up a blog to log my new recipes and entertaining menus, and the first menu utilized this aioli recipe: www.newsundayrecipe.blogspot.com

Quick, easy, and authentic. It's even easier (though less authentic, I suppose) in a food processor. The key is to drizzle the oil in V E R Y slowly, until at least half the oil has emulsified. After that you can go a little faster.

This is a great recipe! It is soooo delicious. My family loved it.

I have now mastered emulsification! I was skeptical that this recipe called for doing things the old fashioned way (with a whisk instead of a food processor or blender), but it turned out great! That said, this does require a lot of patience-- about 30 or 40 minutes of whisking from start to finish. Tastes great!

Excellent. Usually I'm not a big fan of the taste of raw garlic, so I use one clove instead of two and find it's perfect. This comes together so easily; I use my small food processor to make easy work of it.

The cook from Montreal is correct and thank you for straightening that out with Barcelona. This is a classic recipe, excellent with fresh and grilled veggies as well some fish.

I really don't have a review, I have a question, does anyone know the receipe for the dipping sauce for artichoke at "55" in St Tropez??? I'm thinking it is just a thinner version to this, but not sure. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Excellent on just about any grilled veggie. Try it on Pomme Frites (French Fries) instead of ketchup! Also good on crab or shrimp. For an interesting twist, double the garlic cloves and then roast them first. TIP: Let the egg yolk come up to room temp. before you whisk it in. Also if using a food processor instead of a whisk put the garlic in last and by hand.

Dee-licious! Made this aioli tonight for dinner - had it with asparagus, had it with chicken and it was terrific on both. So simple to make! Try it! I'm going to make it once a week. Yum!

Aioli is the French version, and as Jacques Pepin calls it in La Technique it is 'the butter of Provence'. Anyone who has had the great fortune of eating Jody Adams' food knows she is a bloody genius.

This isn't allioli at all. If you've ever tried the delicious sauce so popular with grilled food in Catalonia, you'll realise it has nothing to do with this. Not even the name is properly written. All you need to make real allioli is extra virgin olive oil, garlic, and a steady hand with mortar and pestle. You are aiming for a thick texture, so add ingredients slowly to check for proportions. As for this recipe... well, it's just another garlic sauce.
