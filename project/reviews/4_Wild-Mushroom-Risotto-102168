We tried this, however, we used a mixture of shitake, chanterelles, and other unusual mushrooms maybe closer to a pound), plus homemade chicken broth. In any event, the rest of the recipe we followed exactly and it was amazing. I could not imagine any way in which to improve on the flavor. Everyone was disappointed there wasn't more left. This would go great with a steak as I believe it was the only thing that might accompany this if you needed meat on your plate, though, personally, I think I would just like a double serving. Awesome!

I totally agree with previous reviewer. It took 6-7 cups of broth and way more than 30 minutes. It was good but way more effort than I wanted to put in for dinner. I'll order this in a restaurant next time rather than make it myself.

I used dried chanterelles, morels & mixed boletes instead of porcinis, and prolly more of them and the fresh criminis than the recipe called for. As a heads-up, the rice took up at least a 6th cup of broth, maybe even 6.5 or 7 total, & took longer to finish than 30 mins. But it was worth all that stirring! YUM.

Well, made some substitutions to fit what I had on hand, so maybe my rating would have been better if I had made this dish as directed. Used white mushrooms for everything, boiled 1/2 of them (chopped) in the broth, and then fished them out and sauteed them with the rest. Used a combination of Indian and long grain wild rice too. Overall, this dish had a very deep and rich flavor, even though it is seemingly healthy. We enjoyed it quite a bit. Wish we could get dried varieties of mushrooms in this area, but alas...

followed the recipe to a "t" as it needs no real variation - but you can play and so I did. I minced and treated the garlic as instructed and then thinly sliced another 2 cloves carmelizing them to add another texture and make the flavor a bit more intense.You can also use a mixture of fresh cheeses, I added a small amount of pecorino to the fresh parm. Great company food!

I looked at several recipes and reviews from this website, and combined what it seemed were the best tips and additions - it came out great! I made this with my boyfriend and though it took some time, it was worth the wait! I used equal amts of butter and olive oil, and for the onions, used a combination of leeks, shallot and yellow onion. For the mushrooms, I used a lot (16oz) and it came out great - 8 oz crimini, 6 oz portabella, and 2 oz dried mix (porcini, oyster, and I think crimini). The amts and types were based on what was available at the store, I had just wanted a mix. Some were sliced, some were chopped, it didn't matter in the end. Used 2tsbp fresh thyme and no marjoram though that may have been good, ended up using 2 c rice as it seemed like so little rice with all the mushrooms! Also recommend using a little more cheese if you like cheese, I used almost 3/4 cup. Also used a full cup of wine, as in some other recipes. The dish can certainly handle it, though may have used 3/4 c if I hadn't used 2 c rice. Stirring it frequently is a must. The recipe is not hard, but does take time as the stirring requires a lot of attention.

Made this for the third time last week in the UK where dried mushrooms are way cheaper than here in North America. I added 25 g of mushrooms instead of the 14 grams the recipe called for and used veggie broth, and switched out the fresh mushrooms for a packet of mixed wild mushrooms....etc... My husband's grandmother, who I was making it for, loved it :-) This recipe is a wonderful all-purpose risotto recipe that can be changed as you go. I'll be making it again and again for a long time to come.

I loved this risotto. Easy to make and tastes very good. I didn't have the porcini mushrooms, so I used a diiferent type that I forgot the name, but it was still very good!

Rating: 2
Robust in the mushroomy flavor, but I thought it was a little bland in other respects and could use some more herbs to increase complexity of flavors. If I make this again, I will use a combination of leek, shallots, and onion instead of straight onion; and add some sage. I will replace half the fresh mushrooms with assorted wild mushrooms. Also, it could use a little salt.

I made this for the second time tonight and it was every bit as good as the first time. I made some moderately significant changes. I used Crimini(brown caps) mushrooms, stem on, chopped and added to chicken broth and simmered 4 minutes, then removed from the stock, and added back per the recipe to be sauteed. I used half as much (Plugra) butter and a bit more olive oil.I used dried spices and cut amount by 1/3. The Crimini have good flavor and texture but are not as strong. We have a 5 year old. She loves this. I only added grated Parmesan upon request, and did not add any otherwise. It helps to have hot stock. Cover and let rest 5-10' before serving.

Rating: 4
fantastic. the stirring takes a while, but it's really an uncomplicated recipe, and you don't have to measure things exactly (always a benefit). i bought sliced shitake and baby bella mushrooms to save time, and used half chicken broth, half mushroom broth. as other reviewers have said, it makes a LOT of food, so i'm hoping it keeps well in the freezer. i served it with the rosemary and garlic lamb chops from this site, my husband and i both loved it!

Rating: 4
I used CostCo's dried mushroom mix instead of porcini's alone, and I used a mix of fresh crimini and shiitakes. I used more mushrooms than called for. Otherwise, I followed this recipe exactly and the result was really good. The cooking time, as mentioned by others, is longer than the recipe suggests. I served it as a side with Italian- style meat loaf, and though it doesn't need to be any more rich, I drizzled it with a little truffle oil...yum. We really enjoyed this, and I'll make it again.

Excellent flavour! We followed recipe exactly, except added more onion & garlic, more white wine than called for, and salt and pepper, to taste. And we used dry herbs. This one's going in the books. Yummy!

The dried porcini add excellent earthy depth to a solid risotto. I like to use fat from frying up pancetta lardons to cook the onions, and I throw in some shrimp right at the end to cook as the dish is finishing.

Overall, I think I expected more flavor with this recipe. Something was missing....black truffle oil might have helped. I didn't care for the wine in this either.

Delicious!! My family enjoyed it so much, Even I whom dislikes risotto AND mushrooms. But i do suggest blending the mushrooms. (for all you people don't enjoy the texture of them.) Although it is hard for me to right a review when i simply didn't have some of the ingredients (porcini mushrooms,onions or marjoram) Also we added beef stalk not chicken stalk. But either way, we still loved it

Holy cow this is good! I love this recipe and I've made it a couple of times. I agree with the cook from Vernon-- it is time consuming, but well worth it. I added truffle oil in place of olive oil and a used red wine instead of white-- both red and white are really really good.

It must be said: Definitely don't bother making wild mushroom risotto if you don't like wild mushrooms! Very nice balanced flavour, and you can afford to be generous with the mushrooms.

I was disappointed after all of the positive reviews. I followed the recipe to a T and got a bland, gloppy dish. I think you would only enjoy this if you really loved wild mushrooms (which I don't, I guess). There are many better risotto recipes in the world.

Absolutely delicious! My dd and ds-in-law could not stop snitching it before I got it into the large rectangular baking casserole. I made it as a vegan main dish for holiday party tomorrow evening. I 1.5x the recipe in order for it to fit in my large flat baking dish. Used porcini mushrooms only, more than recipe called for; also extra thyme. The recipe requires more liquid (and time!) in order for the rice to cook thoroughly. I also fried up some sliced vegan sausage (Field Roast brand Smoked Apple Sage) and folded that in before spooning mixture into the baking dish. After warming it up before serving I plan to sprinkle the top with combined half panko/half vegan parm cheese mixture and toast the top so it gets nice and crunchy . The aroma is unbelievable! I cannot wait to serve it!

Takes time to prepare but is not difficult. Any kind of mushrooms will do; I used shiitake and portobella.

I've made this twice now and am getting ready to make it again--all in the span of three weeks! This recipe is that good--I first made it for a vegetarian friend with vegetable stock, and a mix of oyster, shiitake and portabella mushrooms and it was fantastic. I then made it with chicken stock and a mix of baby bella and porcinis. Both were so delicious, so easy and kept well as leftovers. Perfect!

I had some fresh morels on hand and decided to use them in this. Delicious! I used about twice the recommended amount of fresh mushrooms - mix of the morels, shiitake, oyster and crimini. I also substituted vegetable broth to make it meatless. I found, though, that it took much longer for the rice to absorb the fluid - at least twice as long as the recipe says.

This was phenomenal! I made it as a main course and used only 1 T of butter and replaced the rest with olive oil. I also sprinkled a little extra parmesan and thyme on top for presentation. It was so easy and so flavorful. It tasted better than many of the risottos I've had in upscale restaurants.

One of the best risottos I have ever made. I paired it with leg of lamb with a bing cherry sauce, and carmelized onions. It went well with our wine - Pinot Noir. My only variations were adding extra garlic and cheese. I am making it again for a side dish for Easter dinner tonight. Yum yum!

This was my first risotto dish ever and it was delicious. Had to add another 1/4 - 1/2 cup of rice since I felt the liquid from the mushrooms (I used portobello) was not going to be absorped by the rice. Next time, I'll add more cheese, perhaps gorganzola or blue cheese.

This worked really well with fresh cremini and dried oyster and chanterelle mushrooms. As others have said, it makes a HUGE AMOUNT. I didn't like it as well reheated the second day, so you might want to adjust your proportions before you start, but it's definitely a keeper.

Rating: 4
A success--and works with all kinds of mushrooms. I used shallots instead of onions and added 1/2 tsp. fennel seed after the shallots, as well as 1/2 tsp. white truffle oil at finish, upped the cheese slightly, drizzled with aged balsamic, garnished with leftover marjoram leaves, and served as an entree. Next time will try a nice pureed root vegetable on the side.

It seems like there are a million mushroom risotto recipes out there and I have to say, this one if really good. I soaked my porcini in about 1 1/2 cups of water and then used that water as part of the broth, the rest was vegetable stock. As the stock heated up, I added the mushroom caps from the cremini and the shiitake I used for a more flavorful broth. Delicious!

I found this risotto very heavy & quite expensive to make. I've made many kinds of risottos, so this was no maiden voyage. I probably should've cut the recipe in half, as I now have tons of leftovers. If I did make it again, I think I'd cut the amount of mushrooms substantially - and add something - I'm not sure what that would be!

I've made this recipe several times now, and it's always a big hit. I often use shiitakes in addition to the crimini mushrooms, and I sometimes use dried morels in addition to/instead of dried porcinis. I also finish the risotto with just a splash (couple tablespoons?) of heavy cream, which makes the risotto just a bit creamier and richer. This is a fabulous dish, worth every bit of time and effort!

Risotto-making hazard warning #135: Once I opened that bottle of dry white I just kept on drinking. But that only added to the fun. Did anyone find crimini mushrooms? I couldn't, but the usual garden variety brown mushy worked a treat. My arms are still tired from all the stirring, but this risotto's a winner.

I really loved this risotto. The best funghi risotto I have ever made ... since crimini mushrooms are hard to find where I live, I used half shitake, half button mushrooms along with the dried porcini. Just delicious. Also used my own home made chicken stock,so much better than canned stock.

I used red onions and found that they made the risotto a bit sweet. I would certainly make it again but I might cut back on the onions next time. The risotto was very creamy and delicious

Rating: 3
Next time I make this, I will increase the herbs, garlic and wine. The dish cooks so long that you lose some of the flavor. Use good quality arborio rice and stir nearly constantly (not just often) so that the rice breaks down and releases its creamy starch. Otherwise, you'll end up with just a nice rice dish, not risotto. I didn't find it necessary to cook the onions and mushrooms quite as long as indicated and be careful to stop cooking when the rice tastes done (al dente), whether or not you incorporated all the liquid.
