I agree with the user who said that oyster sauce had a lot of sugar, so I made these adjustments: 1 tea spicy sesame oil, 1 tablesp of wheat-free, low sodium soy, garlic, minced ginger, and a large splash of low sodium chicken broth. Topped with sesame seeds as another user suggested. I used a bag of frozen broccoli. WE LOVED IT! I like that we only used 1 teasp of oil for the entire dish and low sodium.

This is gr8! Use olive oil instead of canola and add fresh chopped ginger, finish with sesame oil. Its amazing when served over soba noodle - just add a little more stock to make the sauce.

Took "A Cook from Vienna's" advice and the recipe was delicious!

I did a search on "low sugar". Granted, it's only 3 tablespoons for the whole recipe, but oyster sauce has a lot of sugar in it.

Followed the advice of the cook from VA., and this was the best broccoli ever! Left it a bit on the crispy side. Big hit at our chinese new year dinner. Can't wait to make this again.

This was terrible. I made it exactly as the recipe states and we fed it to the garbage disposal.

I can't wait to make this for friends. But I did not quite follow the instructions (by mistake). I did not cover the wok after adding the stock and oyster sauce. I just kept on stirring and the sauce cooked down to a delicious syrup. Sprinkle with sesame seeds for a little added visual.

Took the advice of other reviewers and added some ginger with the garlic, crushed red pepper, and sprinkled chopped scallions on the finished dish. In addition, I added cubed tofu to the broccoli and served over rice as a quick main dish. My husband gobbled it up and asked for more!

followed the advice from Va. and added the ginger,chili paste,rice vinegar and green onions. Came out with a great "bite" to it. Would have been a bit bland otherwise, I will make it again just like this.

Very simple to make. I added some minced ginger with the garlic, then when I added the broccoli, I sprinkled some crushed red pepper flakes for some spice. When the broccoli was done, I took it out of the pan and reduced the sauce by half. It came out great!

I thought this dish was very good--simple to make, and while not spectacular, quite tasty.

Ok, I've played with the recipe since my previous rating, and have found that it's greatly improved by chopping the garlic and adding a little chopped ginger (bottled is fine) w/ the garlic; stir-frying for only a minute or two; adding a teaspoon each of chili paste and seasoned rice vinegar to the sauce, adding a couple of thinly sliced green onions before the final simmer, and thickening w/ a cornstarch slurry. That brings it close to restaurant broc w/ garlic sauce.

I was hoping to find the recipe for Broc w/ Garlic Sauce that many Chinese restaurantsin my area serve (in my experience, it's only mushy when reheated or ordered for delivery -- usually a very crisp veg w/ flavorful, slightly spicy sauce). This recipe turned out to be nothing special.

Very good and very easy. Nice flavors.

Extremely easy and delicious. Much better than the mushy broccoli with oyster sauce most Chinese places try to pass off.

I substituted asparagus (as does my favorite Chinese restuarant around the corner) which was great. The sauce can be used for just about anything, just don't use with meats/shellfish unless they are partially cooked first.
