My first time cooking forbidden rice, and some of the comments had me apprehensive. I wonder if some of you are confusing black wild rice with black jasmine rice? Forbidden rice is jasmine rice - just black. You can find it under Lotus Foods on the internet or(in the West)at Cost Plus World Market. For half the price, you can go to your Asian or international market and get Dragonfly brand black jasmine rice. I made it 1 cup of rice to 1 3/4 cups water, brought it to a boil and simmered for 20 minutes -- it was just perfect. I forgot the sesame oil and added it afterwards, and it was still delicious. Black rice is so full of flavonoids and other good things for you - do try to master it.

This is the first time I ever made or ate black rice. It was good and was pretty with the scallops in the original Gourmet recipe. I don't know that I'd seek this out again if I wasn't making the scallops, but we liked it. I thought it turned out a bit more watery than I'd have liked, but I really wasn't sure what to expect.

I too thought the rice tasted burned, and was disappointed, but found that a generous sprinkling of granulated white sugar, or alternately, a drizzling of honey neutralized that effect. Sesame oil tastes fine on it's own, as does the rice, but together, without any doctoring, ew. I added chopped walnuts and dried cranberries to mine. Next time, I intend to use pecans instead of walnuts, and also add some chopped apple with the cranberries. MMMM good!

followed the suggestions and used less water. I thought that the sesame oil amount was fine

Nasty. The sesame oil was overpowering and made the rice taste burned. Perhaps a good quantity of toasted sesame seeds, instead of the oil, would salvage this.

i love black rice. i used a little less water than the recipe called for and it ruled. i also added edamame (without the shells) for a asian style rice and peas effect. mmmmmm.

This was the first time I have cooked or eaten black rice. The taste was wonderful, but I did have a problem in cooking the rice as the recipe called for. I had too much liquid for the amount of rice. I followed the recipe exactly and have not had a problem in cooking rice in the past. I will add more rice to the liquid the next time I make this. I think one cup of the black rice would work just fine. I served the seared scallops over the rice. The flavors were wonderful.
