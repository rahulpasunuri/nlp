Total prep and cooking time is insane (I spent almost five hours on this dish) but the dish is phenomenal. Never had pig's feet before but am a convert now. Perfect on a rainy day!

Wonderful!! A rich, warming comfort food. I was skeptical about the pig's feet but must say they added a nioe depth to the dish. The family thought it was great and asked when we could have this again - a definite win!

I think I'll use 6 lbs of Pig's feet and 2 neck bones. I love me some Pig's feet. They say after cooking discard the feet, sacrilege! Also if you buy too many juniper berries, they add great flavor to lamb dishes.

Okay, so I want to try this, but I eat very little meat and the whole pig's feet thing is giving me pause. What do they bring to the dish? Does anyone have a suggestion for a substitute that will provide similar results?

sorry. you lost me at 'neck bones' and pigs' feet. but, the concept of pears/ginger and beef sound interesting. wondering if a 'pot roast' of beef with other ingredients might not be yummy.

This sounds wonderful and something I'm going to try this weekend -- should be 'very rich' tasting - thanks for posting something a little different!

Pigs feet and neck bones are very useful in creating a rich dark broth that will stand up to long cooking. Very traditional in German and English cooking. I'm going to try it!

Neck bones or pigs feet??

Not weird in my mind! Pretty rich but perfect for a cold autumn night. I assume the pig's feet add texture to the sauce and the ginger-pear combination with beef seemms deliciously interesting to me. I will try it this week-end and rate it afterwards.

Weird, plain weird this recipe. Ginger, parsley, pig's feet, beef neck bones?? Very strange combination. Which I'm not going to try.
