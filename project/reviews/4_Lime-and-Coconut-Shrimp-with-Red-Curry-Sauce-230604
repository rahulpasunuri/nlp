I really like the curry sauce and found it easy to make. I have made it with green and red curry paste and prefer the green since it made it hotter. I also made the shrimp but found them to be a little heavy. I will definitley keep making the curry and use it as a base to add sauteed chicken, fish or shimp or vegetables.

I make this curry sauce all the time, it is amazing. It tastes like curry you get at 5 star restaurants. Its sooo good. I serve it with fish, chicken and even tofu. Make rice to soak up all the sauce. Its seriously so good...

WOW. Sooooooo delicious. Followed recipe except for two changes: didn't find cardamon pods so did 1/2 teaspoon each equal parts cinnamon and ground cloves and used Thai green curry paste instead of red (green curry being made from fresh green chilis, red being made from dried). Found batter needed to be thinned with more ginger ale then called for in the recipe, but otherwise, it was all spot on and came out gorgeous!

Excellent! Made only the sauce and grilled the shrimp. Very tasty!

Excellent. Although i would have liked the Curry sauce to be a little bit thicker.

This was a great basis for a curry! I was looking for a sauce to make a vegetable Tofu Curry with, so I omitted the shrimp and Kaffir Lime batter. I also added some chicken stock to the Curry Sauce, as it made very little sauce. Didn't have Kaffir Leaves, but I did sliver some Basil, and added cubed tofu, zucchini and sliced Red Bell pepper. It was delicious! Next time I will cut way back on Cardamom seeds - too overpowering for my taste.

This Curry Sauce is YUMMY!! Its simplicity might be mistaken for bland, but that's not the case. Delicious balance of flavors, the cardamom adds a lovely flavor and the heat was just right for me (too spicy for hubby.) I skipped kaffir lime cuz I didn't find any, so imagine how this could even be better! In the spirit of low calories, I grilled the shrimp instead of deep fry, so did not make batter. BTW, I used whole cardamom pods as written, but next time, I'd just use seeds. The pod husks are a nuisance.

Extremely good with shockingly not too much effort - especially if you already have the curry paste made. Cheated and used just water and a little chopped ginger instead of the ginger ale. The curry sauce is very sweet - would drop b sugar next time.

Apart from the hassle and clean-up of frying, this dish was very nice. Leftover shrimp also reheat surprisingly well (microwave, 1 min.) Used unsweetened, fresh coconut for a healthy final product (gives a subtle coconut flavor). I also followed Joy of Cooking's advice and did the dredge/coconut stage 1 hr before frying to allow the mixture to adhere properly.

This recipe was a hit! A few things though... I made the curry the day before, and thought the flavors mellowed by day 2 (rather than intensifying) -- perhaps wait to strain the sauce if you make ahead. Be careful not to over-dredge the shrimp in the cornstarch. For the batter, I used Reed's Extra Ginger Brew. Also - do try to get the kaffir leaves - their flavor truly shines in this dish, and I can't think of a suitable substitute. Finally, I pan- fried the shrimp in olive oil spray to cut down on the fat. All in all, a fantastic recipe that takes time, but is well worth the result.

I made just the curry sauce portion to go with another meal. It's a great little recipe and very easy. Except for the lime leaves, the ingredients are easy to find.

This was amazing. I used olive oil instead of peanut for frying, and it worked fine. I couldn't believe that I cooked this meal myself, and my husband was delighted! I can't wait to make this one again. I made extra curry sauce, some jasmine rice, and steamed some fresh veggies real fast, and turned it into a full meal. I also used popcorn sized shrimp instead of jumbo, and although there were more to dip & fry, it worked really well in the context of the rice and veggies.

VERY tasty! However, it is very time consuming to dip the shrimp in the batter and coconut because of how thick the batter is. It might be better to prepare ahead of time.

Amazing. My boyfriend was impressed not less than me.

Wow. I made this as an appetizer the other night to impress a new date who was taking me to dinner that evening. He loved it and polished of about 5 of them. It's a fair amount of prep time and I had problems with getting the oil temperature right for frying. At first it was too hot and then it cooled too much but I had to go ahead anyway due to the time crunch. I ended up frying the shrimp about 5 minutes due to the cooler oil but it still tasted fabulous. I'll definitely do this one again.

Trying to stay way from deep frying and since I had MonkFish on hand, I used this with marinated chunks of the fish (can be any firm fish, or scallops) for about 1 hr in soy sauce, umbashi plum vinegar, brown sugar + sesame oil. Sauteed everything till marinade evaporated, then poured the curry sauce over the fish at the end and served over rice. DELICIOUS!

A wonderful combination- the chili paste gave the sauce just enough heat! Will definately do again!

Outstanding! I made it for my wedding anniversary and all my guests raved about it! Will definetely make it again...

Everyone raved about this recipe. Coconut did not adhere to shrimp as much as I would prefer. I might add a bit more cornstarch next time or maybe mix with Panko crumbs as well. Easy to prepare in advance.
