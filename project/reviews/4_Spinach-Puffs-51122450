Absolutely delicious! Instead of onion I used shallot and on my third time making these babies, I added broccoli cause this recipe is mega versatile. A crowd pleaser and easy to make--what else can a girl ask for?!

These are DELICIOUS. I feel no need to tweak the recipe at all, which is very unusual for me.

Made them tonight with filet mignon....I exchanged the feta for goat cheese and used fresh thyme instead of the dill as I am not a dill fan. They were excellent and I will definitely make them again!!

So good and addictive. Follow the recipe exactly. You can actually get 2 additional puffs. Mine were a little too stuffed. This is real keeper.

I made these with a friend on 'Emperor's New Groove' themed food night and they were great. It would have been a lot better had I added extra feta, or remembered to add salt. Salt is a must in this recipe. A little bland if not. I didn't use dill, but instead put more onions and garlic in. I recommend thinning out the puff pastry QUITE a bit to have a good ratio of that to the filling. Used both mini and regular sized muffin tins. Got to say, I preferred the mini, bite-sized ones a lot more.

These are really good and very easy to make. If you love spinach, you will love these. I made this for an casual dinner party and everyone loved them. We reheated them days later and they were not soggy, still delish!

The filling in these was too dry for my taste and a bit bland. Filling for spanakopita is similar but I make it with fresh spinach. Perhaps this also would've been better with fresh instead of frozen and mor herbs. Or maybe it didn't really need to be squeezed as much as instructions state. My family didn't care much for these.

Really good! I added some cooked ground italian sausage and it was delish!

I too made them in mini muffin pan as appetizers. Made them a couple days before I needed them and put them in the freezer, pan and all, covered with plastic wrap. Took them straight out of freezer and into 400 degree oven. EVERYONE loved them. A great vegetarian appetizer.

I made these appetizer size in a mini-muffin pan for a total of 2 dozen puffs. I baked in 400 degree oven about 20minutes. Loved them!!! Will make for my annual holiday party. I reheated them the next day and they were fine.

Super, super easy to make. The longest part is waiting for the pastry dough to thaw out... and maybe squeezing the water out of the spinach. Other than that, a HUGE hit at the dinner party I went to the other night. Gone within the first 10 minutes, and people couldn't stop raving about how tasty these were all night long. Presentation won bonus points too - guests thought it must have taken hours to make! Ha!

I made these as stated in the recipe (also had to check online for temp, though 400 is pretty standard for puff). Also varied the fillings -- butter, ricotta, cinnamon sugar and strawberry jam; beaten eggs with cooked bacon and grated cheddar; and beaten eggs with cooked crumbled sausage and smoked gouda. All were big hits -- similar to the egg souffles sold at Panera Bread, but smaller. I am planning to make mini-muffin tin sized ones to freeze, unbaked for on-hand appetizers. One full package of puff pastry made 12 pastries using a standard muffin tin.

I made these last night for a dinner party and they were a big hit. The only thing I changed was the size. I used a mini muffin pan and adjusted the pastry size to fit. Cooked 20 minutes at 400. I am now testing to see how well they freeze.

I made these last night for a small dinner party. they were easy to make, and I assembled them ahead of time as suggested and then baked to serve hot. They got rave reviews from all dinner guests. I found the recipe in the magazine and the temp (400 F) wasn't shown there either. Luckily the recipe had been updated at bonappetit.com. Perhaps someone could update the recipe here, please?

I have them all assembled and ready to bake, from the Bon Appetit magazine, but it doesn't say what degree oven! Looked here, and it doesn't tell either! HELP!! Does anyone know what temperature to bake them?
