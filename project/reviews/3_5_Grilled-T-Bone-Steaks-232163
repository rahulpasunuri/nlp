I just have to ask, Panguitch, UT, if grilling a T-bone is so easy for you, why were you looking at this recipe? Teehee. Just having fun with you. I am a notoriously BAD meat griller but a pretty darn good cook, I think, so I need recipes like this.

As someone who only cooks steak when my in-laws come to visit, I really appreciate (and need) basic instructions like the ones in this helpful recipe. Anyone who feels such baby steps are beneath them should refrain from giving the recipe low marks for this reason alone and simply move on to recipes that suit your abilities. None of us were born knowing how to cook.

Yes - there are some folks who DON'T know how to make a good steak and making sure that they understand the importance of high heat for a perfect steak is insightful!

Next time, maybe we'll have a recipe on how to use the computer so we don't send the same message twice!

Okay folks, not everyone is a world-class cook. Sometimes beginners read magazines such as the one this came from to learn how to be better cooks - this recipe gives excellent direction with great results.

Said totally tongue in cheek, Boy Cooker...just a little piece of my wonderfully dry humor - or at least I think so. Actually my grandfather was one of the original settlers of Panguitch...the house he built there in 1885 is still standing. It's on the corner of 2nd East & 2nd South. Check it out next time you're there.

Lighten up Panguitch,UT. I've been there twice and found the people quite nice. Are you sure you're from there? PS I prefer Porterhouse.

I just have to ask...is there a bigger waste of bandwith than posting this recipe other than the salted water recipe? If you need directions to put salt and pepper on a steak and grill it, you probably shouldn't be around fire in the first place!
