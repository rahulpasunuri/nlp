This recipe comes out looking nice even if you're not that adept at working with pie dough like me! It was a little bit too sweet for my tastes. If I make it again I will probably add more allspice and maybe some citrus to balance out the amount of sugar from the pomegranate juice. My apples were also a little on the soft side so I might reduce the cooking time on the stovetop to avoid that. I used Rome apples though so that may have affected the texture. Overall, a nice change from traditional apple pie and my guests seemed to like it.

Not bad by any stretch, but I have plenty more apple pie-type recipes I like a lot better (especially when you consider the cost of pomegranate juice).

Very good recipe and flavorful. I will only cut up 5 apples next time.

The Tart came out gorgeous and delicious! I substituted sour cherry juice for the pom and added some cherries to the tart as well. The biggest plus of making a Tart Tartin over an apple pie is that the dough is so much easier to make and to handle and, of course the caramelization you get on the apples :) Yum!

This recipe is wonderful! It is not difficult to make, yet it looks like you've spent all day baking. I followed everything to the letter, except I added a touch of balsamic vinegar to the pomegranate juice while cooking to make it a bit more tart. Next time, I will cut down on the sugar a bit, as I don't like my desserts quite as sweet. However, the recipe is a winner. The texture, flavor, and presentation are flawless.

This was a really pretty presentation and a tasty recipe. But for some strange reason, when I was boiling the pomegranate juice, I kept thinking it had a strange vegetable odor--almost like artichokes. I couldn't get that smell out of my head. I think I'll stick with the traditional tarte tatin. But the color was BEAUTIFUL.
