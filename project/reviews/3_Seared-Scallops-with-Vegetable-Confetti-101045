I thought this was pretty good, but my husband really liked it, so I'd make it again. I loved the idea of cooking the vegetables in sugared water--great combination with the sweet scallops. I made this is a dinner for two, rather than as an appetizer for more as it was written. I think it might work better as an appetizer, because I got a little tired of it by the end of the meal.

I just made the scallops. I sauteed garlic with a little olive oil and then added the scallops. To the drippings I added a dry sherry wine, salt, pepper and paprika to the ingredients listed. Yummy

Scallops only: Needed a spark of some kind, I tried cayenne, that wasn't it. Will keep looking for the "perfect" week-night scallop recipe. Vegetable confetti: THIS is how we get our kids (and ourselves) to eat vegetables??? With all due respect to my mother's table, creamed vegetables should be banned, so should sugared ones!

We made this as the first course for a big Easter Dinner for 10 and it was a big hit! We made the veggies two days in advance, prepared exactly as written (always a good idea the first time trying a recipe), except we cut everything into strips; they were perfect and looked lovely heaped on the plate, and no one thought they were too sweet. And as a vegetarian option (and for someone allergic to shellfish), we served some "chicken strips" (fake) prepared the same way as the scallops (at the same time in another pan), and those were just as well received and made for a very nice presentation (as opposed to simply serving the veggies without scallops and calling that a vegetarian option). This is one we'll make again and again! Easy and deee-lish!!

Made this for Christmas dinner - it was great, I omitted the sugar, steamed the veggies and used red pepper instead of yellow for the holiday. Rave reviews. PS E-Mail address below is incorrect - kstodd@hotmail.com

Nice as an appetizer - presents well. Try this on a bed on Asian greens. Followed by sea bass or swordfish is very tasty.

I would omit the sugar -- it made the vegetables MUCH too sweet. Also, I would cook the vegetables more. I was very disappointed with the recipe as written.

A wonderful light dish! The veggies were easy to prepare ahead and the scallops cook quickly to serve for guests. I received requests for the recipe when I served it...always a good sign.
