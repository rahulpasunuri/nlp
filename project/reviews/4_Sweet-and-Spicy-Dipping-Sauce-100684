This was a fantastic dipping sauce for our hot pot. It was perfect with the shrimp, noodles and the tofu. It would work great as a salad dressing as well. I made it as the recipe states with exception to the carrots, we did not have any. I will keep this in my file.

This was okay, but not as good as I had expected. If I do attempt to make this again, I will lighten up on the fish sauce, and use more rice vinegar to make up the difference. Mine tasted heavy on the fish sauce, even though I used as directed.

This is a wonderful dipping sauce! I only had 4Tbs left of rice vinegar, so I used 2Tbs of Sake to round it out and that worked out perfectly.

Quite wonderful. It melds perfectly with the flavors of the hot pot and works with other asian inspired dishes.
