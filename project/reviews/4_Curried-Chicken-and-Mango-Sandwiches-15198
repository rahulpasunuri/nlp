i thought this was absolutely delicious (as did my husband), but instead of sour cream i used a couple of Tbsp of yogurt and used the fresh curry powder recipe from Bon Appetit from April 2008 - stunning...and messy; the way a good sandwich should be...

This is an excellent recipe. I liked it better without mangos on the sandwich but I also like salty foods much better than sweet foods so I think that it was just my personal preference. I will definitely make these sandwiches again.

didn't find the recipe that exciting. i added some raisins and nuts and extra curry powder.

A treat to make and eat! I decided to make it a salad instead. I added more curry powder, cilantro and celery. I cut the chicken into chunks. Delicious!

This was really tasty and easy to make. We used tortillas instead of bread, and topped it off with fresh tomatoes. I also addedd a little tumeric to the mix.

I had some brined chicken breasts (which I ended up grilling) mango, romaine, and bolillo rolls, and was in search of a curried mayonnaise. OMG, it was EXCELLENT! I did have to sub dried cilantro, and threw in some fresh parsley. WOW. I used half mild and half hot Penzeys curry powders, so it was a bit hot but we loved it. This has bumped the Tuscan Grilled sandwich down on our sandwich rotation! I look forward to trying it with pork, and in a wrap with meat. SO good!

This was really tasty - I loved the mayo and I would consider using it in other dishes. I would advise slicing the chicken into thin slices so they are easier to eat in a sandwich. Olive oil not necessary, I just used butter spray. Great and easy to make!

We had some leftover pork tenderloin from the "Island Pork Tenderloin" recipe. So I used that instead of chicken and used spinach leaves. I wrapped the ingredients in a whole wheat tortilla and it was delicous. I can see how the chicken might be a little plain, so if I make it with chicken, I will probably the spice rub from the Island Pork Tenderloin recipe.

I just made this sandwich tonight and it was WONDERFUL. My boyfriend raved and I loved it too. I followed the recipe exactly except for using spinich instead of lettuce. So easy, quick, and delicious...I will definitely make this again.

Scrumptious. I add a handful of golden raisins (rinsed in hot water), half of a chopped green pepper, and 2-3 thinly sliced green onions for some extra texture if I want to eat the chicken salad plain.

Wow! I was impressed at how quick and tasty this was. I cooked the chicken in my cast iron pan on med-high heat and it got a fantastic crispy crust on the outside, despite only using 1T of oil or so. I don't care for mayo and sour cream, so I made the sauce with yogurt, since it's so common in south Asian sauces. It was tangy and delicious.

Haven't yet prepared this but sounds, very, appealing. Could anyone let me know what (if anything) to sub. if mangoes aren't in season? Peaches? Thanks.

My favorite chicken sandwich - absolute perfection!

it's nice, easy to cook, I'll make it again. However, you can't feel a taste and aroma of mango...

I've been making this sandwich for years and it's one of my most requested lunch entrees. The hot, peppery chicken with the cold tart/sweet of the sauce and mangos is a great combination.

Very good...especially the mayo mixture. Pounded the chicken flat and grilled it.

When mangos go on sale this is the first thing I want to make. WONDERFUL!

This is one of the best sandwich recipes I've ever tried. I think the secret is to season chicken well (I used rotisserie chicken) & to use generous amount of curry-cilantro mayo. It is heavenly & I make whenever I can find good mango.

The flavor was more delicate than I expected. I used cilantro in place of the lettuce. Next time I think I'll try brushing the cooked chicken with mango chutney for a little bolder flavor.

This was delicious and easy. It was a bit messy to eat, but maybe that made it better.

These sandwiches are absolutely WONDERFUL! I will be making these several times from now on during mango season. I used 9 grain rolls, upped the cilantro a bit, and left out the sour cream and lettuce. We'll be having them again tomorrow night!

This sandwich is a wonderfully light meal and this is the second time that I have made it. Even better than the first time!! My wife who does not even like mangos loves this sandwich!
