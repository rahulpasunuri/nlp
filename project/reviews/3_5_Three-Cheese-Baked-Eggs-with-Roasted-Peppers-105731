I've been making this recipe for brunch gatherings for YEARS. it always turns out perfectly, and always gets rave reviews. I save time by using jarred roasted peppers, making it super fast and simple to assemble

I have made this recipe dozens of times for brunch, it always gets RAVE reviews. Save time by buying the peppers already roasted in a jar. the entire thing can be put together very quickly. it always comes out great!

I like this recipe but have found it a little bland in its original form. To add a little more ZIP I roast and skin 1- 2 Jalapeno Peppers along with the red bell peppers and mix the bell peppers and Jalapeno(s) in together. Also I like to use Arrowhead Mills Organic Yellow Corn Meal {*Good Stuff*} in place of the all-pupose flour. The corn meal provides structure for the eggs just the same as the white flour. These two changes zip up the recipe a bit.....

Really good. i took the decadence down a notch by using part skim ricotta, and reducing all the cheeses a bit, along with the butter. still rich but not restaurant rich. also subbed well sauteed onions and sweet grape tomatoes for the peppers, and threw in a pinch of thyme and red pepper flakes. addictive!

I substituted the cheddar with gruyere as suggested by other reviewers. Served this for a New Year's brunch and will be making it again for Mother's Day tomorrow. Wonderful recipe

This recipe was tasty, but I found it rather bland for my taste... I might try subbing a different cheese for the cheddar and will definitely add some pepper at the very least. I may try some ancho pepper too.

I took the suggestion of replacing the cheddar with gruyere. The outcome was a delicious and perfect dish for a holiday brunch. I love epicurious.com for all the creative recipes. However, the best part of this site is the fact that readers contribute their suggestions and share how they modify recipes.

This recipe didn't work for me and my guests; nobody liked it. Too much cheese, too.

This was a perfect recipe for a saturday morning. To make it a bit more interesting I added sauted smoked turkey sausage and spinach. My boyfriend loved it! Will definitely make again using different additions each time.

Made this recipe for Super Bowl brunch. Served nine, increasing proportions by 50%. Used gruyere rather than cheddar, and a jar (12 oz.) of roasted red peppers (sliced into small pieces) rather than roasting the peppers myself. Added 3/8 tsp. of white pepper and eight slices of cooked, crumbled bacon. Cooked for 55 minutes. Simply delicious! Had terrific comments from every guest. Next time, perhaps I'll use a little more bacon, or possibly try it with cooked ground pork sausage. Served with home fries, English muffins, and fresh fruit. Whole thing was a huge hit.

I make this for almost every family brunch event. I usually use a 9X13 inch pan: three extra eggs, a little more flour and just a little extra cheese. Always a huge hit and never any leftovers.

I made this morning for brunch and it was a hit. I used 12 eggs. I also sauteed 2 peppers (in lieu of roasting), spinach, and mushrooms and added. I used all the cheddar, cottage cheese for the ricotta, and some boursin in place of the parm. Baked for 50 mins. People loved it. It served 8 adults.

Really enjoy this recipe. The cheddar cheese makes it far too chewy, especially if you re-heat it. I now substitute gruyere for the cheddar and get much smoother results. I've made it several times this way and it is always great.

Followed the recipe exactly as written. The flavor was fine but the consistency was a bit chewy. I may follow other reviewers' suggestion to substitute gruyere for the cheddar the next time I make this. I will also reduce the cooking time a bit.

I served this with Belgian Waffles. But the Eggs got the rave reviews. I used cottage cheese and added bacon. I also made it completely the day before and it reheated beautifully.

Made this for brunch today adjusting the recipe for 2. I used more red pepper than called for, chives instead of scallions and reduced the cheese by 1/3. It was VERY good and rich but not as rich as if I used all the cheese. I will definitely serve this to company. It's nice to know you can make ahead and reheat.

My roommate and I make dinner together a lot and she is allergic to both wheat and corn. We have tried a lot of different recipes to accommodate her allergy and many of them have been a bust. This one, however, will definitely go into our regular assortment! I used mushrooms and spinach and it was delicious!

We made this for brunch on Thanksgiving Day, so chose to make it in a casserole dish (the pie plates were all occupied), and did have to bake it for about an hour. The kids loved it, and so did we! We're already envisioning a mushroom and spinach version, a mild green chile version........ the possibilities are endless!

This is delicious hot or warmed up the next day. I use 8 eggs, 2T butter, substitute trim cottage cheese for the ricotta and only half cup Parmesean.

Excellent! I made this for an Easter Brunch. I followed other readers' suggestions and used gruyere cheese with a light, creamy and flavorful result. I also had a guest with a gluten intolerance and I substituted potato starch flour for the regular flour. I plan on making this again - as a matter of fact - tonight!

Wow - these are so good! I made a large version and tiny gluten-free version for a family member, omitting the flour. Everyone raved! Made with Spicy Bacon, Petits Pains Au Chocolat, and Cranberry Coffeecake (all from this site.)

The best "fritatta" I've ever tasted. Three of us ate the whole pie for dinner! The only change I made was to sub cottage cheese for the ricotta and to bake it 5 minutes longer then noted.

I have made this to rave reviews several times. I have made the recipe as is, and with a few changes. Generally I would reduce the amount of cheese - I find about 2/3 the amount called for more than sufficient. One time in a pinch I had to replace the ricotta with light cream cheese, and though the end product was a bit denser, it was still great. I also use bottled red peppers for ease of preparation, and sometimes throw in a bit of cooked spinach (be sure to squeeze out extra moisture).

A great brunch dish for guests. I had to bake it longer than specified. I added more veggies-mushrooms, scallions. Just fit in the pie plate. Delicious!

I also substituted Gruyere. Guests loved it. A wonderful brunch dish. I mixed it about an hour ahead of time, due to family & oven constraints, but that didn't seem to affect it at all.

This recipe is easy and delicious and perfect for brunch. I also used peppers from a jar and a can of artichoke hearts, chopped and well drained.

I made this exactly as written except I used peppers from a jar, and it was delicious and very attractive. It holds together beautifully when sliced, which makes for an excellent presentation. I served it for brunch on Christmas eve, along with fruit salad, toasted sourdough bread and coffee cake. If you choose to make changes to the types of cheese that you use, don't swap out the ricotta; it is essential to the texture and success of the dish. The cheddar and parmesan could be changed, though. The recipe as written fit exactly in the pie pan and took about 10 minutes longer to cook than called for, but that may be because my ingredients were very cold.

End result was just ok, not great. Used a combination of gouda, parmesan and sharp cheddar and roasted peppers from a jar. 9 eggs seems like a lot--I make similar recipes for brunch/light dinner dishes that use only 4 eggs. Seemed heavier than I would prefer, and far too salty for my taste. Look for a better recipe.

Super! Adding this to my list of favorites. I substituted gruyere for cheddar, used roasted red peppers from a jar, red onion instead of scallion, and added 4 slices of crumbled bacon. Served with fruit salsa (papaya, pineapple, mango, red onion, cilantro, lime juice, jalapeno), and they were just perfect together. Far lighter meal than I expected. Making another batch tomorrow.

Great recipe and quick to boot! Made this for my ladies' group for Sunday brunch and was a big hit. I also used roasted peppers from a jar, the Gruyere and added 1/4 tsp. white pepper and a few drops of tabasco. Will definitely make again.

Fantastic! Per everyone's suggestions, I doubled the recipe and made in 9 X 13 dish, baked for about 50 minutes and used roasted red peppers from a jar. Otherwise followed recipe. Made it for pre-Christmas brunch. Everyone, even picky vegetarian teenagers, loved it. Thanks to all posters for turning it into a great recipe.

Best if add ten strips of turkey bacon and use egg beaters instead of eggs

These were easy and pretty tasty. I was surprised, because they have a vaguely Mexican flavor to them, I guess from the roasted red peppers....

After reading several of the previous reviews, I used the jar of roasted peppers, doubled the recipe, baked it in a 12" stainless steel chafing dish insert for 55 minutes the night before a buffet breakfast. It reheated well and held up over heat during the length of the event.

I made this for a Mother's Day brunch when my first recipe of choice fell thru at the last minute...and would make it again in a heartbeat as it was very adaptable! Used goat cheese instead of ricotta, and gruyere instead of cheddar as I had these on hand; delicious. Will definitly try the original ingredients the next time...

I made this for Mothers' Day brunch and it was a hit! I used gruyere cheese instead of cheddar and mushrooms instead of the peppers and baked it in a square corningware dish (for 30 minutes). I cut it into 3 inch squares and there was nothing left within minutes -- everyone loved it! Would definitely make this again (maybe with Monterey Jack, avocado and a little jalapeno?.....)

I don't like red peppers, so I used mushrooms instead and it turned out great! I had to cook it about 15 minutes longer then the recipe said and it turned out perfect. It was a hit!

Rating: 2
I didn't have the same luck with this that other posters did. It turned out to be way too much for the pie dish, so I had to bake it in a much deeper glass bowl, which took a lot longer. Plus, I thought it had a strange aftertaste. I didn't notice the aftertaste once I dowsed the thing with hot sauce, but I don't expect to make it again. By the way, I followed the recipe exactly--roasted the peppers and everything.

This was the best thing I could have ever chosen to make for Christmas Day Brunch. Eggs are usually so much trouble to prepare because they are last-minute and require attention. But this recipe can be mixed ahead of time (probably even the night before, but I did it about an hour before baking) and then just popped in the oven! Mine required an extra 10 minutes to cook at 350. I decided not to take the time to roast the peppers and just threw them in raw and that's how I'd do it again to save time (but note you only need about half the peppers that way). I also garnished with cilantro instead. So easy, so delicious. I made a new tradition for our morning!

This is a fantastic egg dish for brunch. Worked out perfect. Instead of bell peppers, I used roasted green chili. I made two, one with chili and the second without (for those who can't eat chili) - both were really tasty and a hit. Try it you'll be glad you did.

I served this for a Thanksgiving brunch with hot croissants and broiled grapefruits to a mixed age group of family and it was gone in minutes! I doubled the recipe, substituted milk for the ricotta and used a jar of roasted peppers (so easy) and baked in a buttered 9 x 13 dish for 45 minutes. This is really good and simple to make...both of my sisters asked for the recipe.

I did not really make the recipe as given, but I used it as a base for a baked Hangtown Fry. I dropped al the cheeses except parmesan, added onions and lots of garlic, and for my wife and I, halved the recipe. I added one can of fresh oyspters, two would have been better. The result was really good. If you want I'll share the final resulting recipe.

I made this dish as a trial run before serving it to family gathering/brunch. Glad I did; while it tasted OK, it was expensive to make (all that cheese, and 9 eggs) and the roasted red peppers were too strong a taste for teenagers and children. It is almost too rich. Most of it went in the trash. I substituted a similar-sized casserole dish for the 6-cup pie plate and that may be why it took 50 minutes to cook (recipe says 30 to 35 minutes).
