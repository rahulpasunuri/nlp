Great summer evening entertaining recipe. Great flavor with a little zing!

I wasn't sure what to expect given the wide range of reviews for this dish and I guess I wound up in the middle. I used bone-in chicken breasts because I couldn't find skin-on boneless. I imagine this only helped the dish in the flavor department. It marinated for about 7 hours. I'm very glad that I followed a previous reviewer's advice to reserve some of the marinade to reduce into a sauce. Without that, I'd say that there just wasn't a lot of flavor to this dish. I will most likely not make it again.

This recipe sounded well rounded but I still made some improvs. I only had 2 chicken breasts so reduced all quantities, but added chopped garic, used the fresh lime juice and added fresh lemon as well. Didn't use orange juice but would have if I had it on hand. I used the real Mexican chili powder, an entire jalapeno WITH seeds (gotta have it hot!), and a bit of ground cumin. As I was making it the same day, it only marinated 3 hours. But wow, it came off the grill so moist, the flavors really seemed to penetrate and it even had a nice kick. Served it with some left over toasted-garlic rice with fresh herbs and lime (found on this site and HIGHLY recommend) and it was a terrific match. This one's a keeper.

I took a chance and served this to friends. They loved it. I added 3 cloves of garlic to the marinade and like some others, reduced the marinade, adding 2T butter, 1T sugar to combat the acidity and some smokey pepper flakes. I served the chicken with garlic-ginger rice and the sauce. Both my husband and I found it to be delicious.

This was delicious. I also added some minced garlic, and since I didn't have jalapeno I added some hot sauce. Also put some chipolte grill seasoning in the marinade. The chicken carmelized perfectly. I served it with a spinach cotija salad and mexican potato salad with grilled peppers and sweet corn. It was one of the best meals I have had in a while. Today I will use the leftovers for a spinach chicken salad.

Made this again last night (for Cinco de Mayo) to rave reviews. I added a few sliced garlic cloves to the marinade- yum! Served with black bean-corn salad and cheese quesadillas. Delicious.

Instead of tequila, we used some of that Mezcal with the worm in the bottom that somebody brought as a party gift years ago and you'd never dream of actually drinking. It added a great, smoky side-taste after marinade. Peppers aren't excessive at all.

I made this recipe for a teacher pot luck at our school. Evereyone LOVED it! It is so easy to make and now I am expected to bring it to each and every pot luck we have!

Very delicious. For those that didn't like it, I wonder if they didn't use fresh squeezed lime juice. The bottled stuff is junk - take the time to squeeze your own and the taste will be outstanding! For the vegetarian of our group I marinated some tofu and it was also very tasty.

Good recipe with some significant modifications. Violated marinade taboo -- NEVER MARINATE CHICKEN IN ANYTHING CITRUS FOR MORE THAN A FEW HOURS -- it'll essentially poach the chicken and drain it of its flavour. Added sweet onion, brown sugar and red pepper flakes.

This was good. Unremarkable. Not good enough to make again. It was just picked at by a buffet-type party of 6. Other food prepared was chosen over this.

This was a big hit! Perfect flavor, not too spicy (but spicy enough), and delightfully juicy! As another cook had done, I thickened the marinade with corn starch to make a sauce; however, I added about a tablespoon of honey to sweeten it a bit. I served it with cilantro-lime rice and some chopped fresh veggies in a red wine vinaigrette dressing. Fantastic!

Rating: 3
I made this dish with several changes and it came out great: I substituted cayenne and cumin for the chili powder, I added some of the seeds from the jalepeno as well as some red pepper flakes. I also reduced the marinade on the stove and added some cornstarch to make a sauce. I served the chicken over rice with the sauce and it was *spicy*! For those who thought this dish was bland, just try adding some things to make it a little more spicy. And consider making a sauce to go on top.

Rating: 3
I've made this pretty much as written several times now. It goes well with a somewhat similar shrimp appetizer recipe I have and margaritas. As far as the seasoning goes, I'm not a big spicy food fan and I find it just about right the way it is. I make a little extra marinade and set some aside to serve at the table - the sauce can be made hotter to allow for more individual preferences.

Truly amazed at the wide disparity in reviews of this recipe. From hatred to adulation. And very contradictory remarks - too much flavor, too little flavor, too moist, too dry, marinate less, marinate more. I pretty much followed the recipe verbatim which I rarely do but it looked interesting enough so did not feel it needed embellishment. I had already thought about reducing the marinade to a sauce which someone else mentioned too. I worried a little but about using something that raw poultry had been sitting in for so long but figured all the boiling would take care of that. Anyway the result was excellent - moist, flavorful, very suitable indeed for company and the sauce worked very well too!!!

I have had a lot of success with the recipe. The trick is to make sure that you marinate for at least eight hours. The longer you marinate the better!

Rating: 3
i've made this recipie a bunch of times. plenty of flavor..however, what i did with the extra marinade was while the chicken was on the grill, i reduced down the marinade in a sautee pan, and used it for a gravy when the chicken came off the grill....

This was the most boring, tastless chicken I have ever made. The dog wouldn't even eat it. What a waste of good tequila. I agree with another cook who said it would've been worse if she had to serve it to a guest.

The chicken was good but not great. I agree with those that say it did not have much flavor.

Made it for a large group (15) and they loved it. I loved it because all of the work was done overnight. I used boneless chicken breast and I'm surprised others didn't find enough flavor in it. Complemented it with a skillet corn bread and a Southwestern Caesar salad....definitely worth a try

I ended up marinating this dish for a bit longer than overnight; unlike some of other comments, I thought it had plenty of flavor. Actually pretty good.

Wasted good tequila and lime on a so-so recipe. I added garlic, and I'm glad I did, as the dish had no real taste. Boring

Interesting & easy, but I wasn't thrilled, even though I used good tequila & fresh lime juice. I'm glad that most of the cooks who made it were pleased with it however. Perhaps if I had an outdoor grill & wasn't relegated to stovetop improvisation, I'd have had better luck.I'd like to try this again with shrimp & some of the seasonings that others have suggested.

To the review of 7/6 - where in the recipe does it say to marinade for 72 hours? If you make the recipe as stated, it is very, very good.

This was so easy & so delicious! I added garlic, cumin & oregano to the marinade, only marinaded abt 9hrs. Used boneless, skinless breasts cause that's what I had on hand. Used leftovers to make a Southwest chicken salad. Will make again & again.

We made this for an impromptu gathering. Didn't have time to marinate more than 2 hours, and also had to bake the dish in the marinade as opposed to grilling. It turned out fabulous, and now we can't wait to try the grilled version!

Perhaps I didn't use enough spices here. I didn't think the flavor was as intense as I thought it should be. I marinated the chicken for two days so I don't think it was the lack of time. I think it was good, just could have been better. I will continue to play with this recipe since it is so easy.

Made this recipe for the 4th of July holiday and served it cold along with the "wheat berry salad with red and green onions" that was featured with the chicken in the same article, cole slaw & french bread crisps. It was terrific...I followed the recipe as stated, marinated it for 6 hours and grilled it the day before serving. I did 10 chicken breasts for 10 people...there were no leftovers. This is an *excellent* make-ahead recipe.

I didn't think a Lime and Tequila marinade would work for chicken, but it did...not earth shattering, however. Too many other fun things to do with chicken than to try this one again.

Made it for company and everyone enjoyed it. I left out the chili powder and added fresh garlic. Marinated it for 6 hrs. and basted it with marinade while grilling outside. I served it with Jack cheese melted over the top which took on the smokey flavor of the chicken. Yummm!!!

Very good moist chicken recipe. However, I found the chili flavour a bit overpowering - would reduce the amount next time as chili powder is not one of my favorite seasonings in large doses.

Wonderful! I made this for my family and they wouldn't shut up about it. Everybody loved it. I only marinated a couple hours and then baked the chicken in the marinade. Didn't turn out TOO juicy, but that's my fault for cooking too long.

This makes a very moist chicken (I used boneless, skinless thighs). It's easy to prepare and I would make it again without altering the recipe. The flavors are subtle - my "gastronomically timid" guests loved it.

I use half lime juice and half lemon juice. I also added two cloves of minced GARLIC. Garlic was a much needed taste for this recipe.

This dish is good but leaves a lot to be desired in the flavor catagory. However, it is an easy recipe and a lot of fun to make, especially after breaking out the tequila. My advice, forego the chicken, just drink the tequila!

I followed the recipe exactly. I marinated the chicken for 30 hours. The taste of the finished product was boring. All I tasted was lime. I wonder what happened to all of the flavors of the other ingredients????? The chicken was tender and juicy, but not worth the price of limes or my good tequila! hee hee

For those of you spending too much time squeezing limes - go for the bottled lime juice in the store. Much easier and same taste. I marinated this overnight and found this to very good on the grill. Not too spicy, but flavorful and juicy. I served it with the fried rice with cilantro and peas recipe.

Very interesting receipe. Worked perfectly for Cinquo de Mayo. I cooked with with bone in breasts. Very good, although next time I will use boneless. I prepared it with grilled asparagus. Great combonation. A few Coronas worked well with the receipe as well. I will definetly cook this receipe again. I will probably try it with pork cutlets as well. I also plan on trying this with a type of fish too. Maybe a flounder or some stryper.

I tried this recipe at home on my family and they loved it! I then decided to bring it to my school when we had a covered dish lunch for all the teachers. I have never received so many compliments on a dish before. This is one dish that is so easy to make and the taste is simply wonderful. Next time I make it I will use it for fajitas.

Made this recipe for fajitas and it was outstanding. I used boneless-skinless and it was as moist as bone-in skin-on. Served the Mexican Clam Dip from Bon Appetit as a starter and it, too, was INCREDIBLE!!

Good tasing & easy recipe. I followed and earlier reviewers advice and marinated for a shorter period of time (3 hours). I have made similar recipes before and did find them to be bland after marinating for awhile. This really seemed to work good. I did add a clove of minced garlic and omitted the cilantro. I use this chicken sliced for fajitas. I also saute onions in olive oil and then at the end squeeze in some more fresh lime juice to give it that extra lime flavor. I will definately make this again.

Rating: 2
Two and a half forks! We used this marinade for chicken fajitas, modified to use up what I had in the fridge. No cilantro, and twice the amount of jalepeno. Couldn't taste a lot of flavor, but what I did taste was fairly good. Chili powder gave the chicken kind of a pink hue that made people question whether or not I was attempting to give everyone salmonella poisoning.

Hey, here's the secret to great Tequila Lime Chicken......first DO NOT MARINATE THE MEAT FOR MORE THAN 4 HOURS. The acid actually cooks the meat if you leave it overnight and turns out yucky. Then while cooking, baste your chicken with PURE tequila mixed with a dash of lime(not the marinade)...of course, you'll want to be careful if doing so over an open flame. I pan cooked mine and was awesome. NEVER MARINATE MORE THAN A FEW HOURS WITH ACID. (that includes fish, steak, and chicken). Add cumin to your marinade as well. Yum.

Unfortunately, we were unable to grill this in a timely manner so it ended up marinading for 48 hours! This is probably the reason it was so strong tasting. This may not be a fair rating, but I won't do this one again.

This Recipe was very good. My husband and I enjoyed this alot. With a fork I poked holes all over the chicken so the flavors of the marinade could really penatrate the chicken. I would make this again.

This tasted like lime and little else. The only way this would have been worse is if I was a guest and was served this and HAD to eat it. I fed mine to the dog.

We thought this dish had a nice kick. However, we didn't marinate overnight. We made up the marinade, cooked the chicken almost all the way and dipped the chicken into it. This preserves the lime and chile flavor. Then you can use the marinade as sauce for the chicken as well.

Rating: 3
Great dish, if not very novel. My bent on the marinade was to double the amount of tequila (used good quality stuff), replace the half-cup orange juice with olive oil, and add 3 big cloves of chopped garlic. I flattened a whole fryer by removing the backbone, salted and peppered well, then marinaded overnight. Put my Weber gas grill on Med-Lo-Med, criss-crossed two long skewers through the chicken to hold everything in place, and grilled on left (cool) side one-hour, turning half way through. Good color and easy to carve.

The marinade for this recipe is excellent and easy. I halved it for 2 chicken breasts. The grilled chicken was so moist and flavorful. It was definitely not spicy but in general I don't think when marinating meats they ever end up with much of a kick. I served it with the Cumin Roasted Potatoes! (7/2000) and a nonmemorable slaw recipe - not Epicurious.

Excellent! Added the oil as another user suggested. But added a side cheese sauce made up of Mexican Velveeta, sour cream and some salsa. My guests loved this entre!

Nice, but just a touch on the bland side. I even did not seed the jalapenos, but still thougt it lacked spice. I'll put in another chilie, and more chili powder. The tequila (I had to assure my guests that it was in there-- we could not taste it) must've killed the spicy kick. I thought our mouths would be burning. We all thought the fresh lime juice made the dish! Well, to each her own!

This was easy and delicious. Next time I wouldn't squeeze the limes for fresh lime juice and would just buy some lime juice and a few limes. We used breasts on the bone, and it was incredibly moist and tasty.

I really liked the recipe and so did my guests. I did a couple of thinks different, I added more of the seasonings and some olive oil so the chicken would not dry out. I also did not marinate more than two hours as I was concerned that the lime juice would pulverize the chicken. The second time I made it I added Shrimp and they were delicious with the shrimp. If you do have any left over, it is great the next day too. The lime and orange juice with teh tequila is also a refreshing drink.

Great recipe and easy to prepape! I made it for my family once, and a few guests on another occassion. Everyone loved it. Just be sure to marinade the chicken at least 6 hours (I recommend overnight). I used skinless chicken breasts both times, and I'm definitely adding this to my 'keep' recipes.

This was wonderful--though I can't say I was expecting anything less-- Ina's cookbook, The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook, has become a standard in my kitchen. This chicken was easy, and tasty (two things Ina's recipes always are) and created quite a stir at the dinner table. It tastes like the Tequila Lime Chicken at Chili's, only much more flavorful. (One question: has Ina reconsidered her dislike for cilantro? She claims to not be a fan in her book, but uses it here. Oh well, just an observation!) I may add more salt next time, or better yet, garlic salt. My husband suggested skinning the chicken as well, but we'll see. Don't stint on the long marinating time. The results will be worth waiting for.
