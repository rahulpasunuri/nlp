I was not sold on this salad until the next day. Had it as leftovers for lunch--the flavors really came together. Make it a day ahead! Easy, inexpensive, and keeps well.

This is a nice lunch salad. The parsley vinaigrette is lovely, and I have made that alone for other salads. I think the radicchio is essential and would not omit as others suggested.

I enjoyed this salad as presented, but felt it could be a bit more interesting; so, I made "some" adjustments. I added the following to the vinaigrette: 1 tsp fresh pepper; two finely chopped anchovies, and three finely chopped garlic. I increased the vinegar to 1 tbsp from 1/2 tbsp. Also, I added 1/4 cup loosely chopped red onion to the beens and celery mixture. Finely, I replaced the radicchio with mixed greens and topped the salad with some shaved parmesan.

I really liked the fresh taste of the parsley vinaigrette. I have to admit, I used shredded chicken instead of tuna. So I didn't follow the recipe exactly - but I left everything else the same. I actually like this with just the beans, celery and parsley vinaigrette. Definitely easy to make and great for warm days when you don't want to turn on the oven/stove.

We made it with Ortiz tuna and Frantoia as well and thought it was very flavorful. We added salt and pepper liberally but that's a given. This recipe is a keeper especially on hot summer days.

Loved the fresh flavor of the parsley vinegarette, but overall an average salad. We added some radishes and green ripe olives, which helped. I would probably make it again because it's healthy and we did love the dressing.

We used with super good Ortiz tuna, all organic veggies and very good Frantoia olive oil - even so, it was bland. Sister and husband agreed this recipie is not a keeper. However, it was easy to assemble.
