Tried this when I was looking for something new for lamb instead of the old "garlic + rosemary + mint" rut. Extremely good! I did use Garam Masala instead of just cumin and cardamom, but otherwise followed it pretty closely. Oh, and I broiled it for 4-5 minutes per side, instead of pan-cooking. Served with the shockingly oil-free Fresh Mint Chutney (more like a pesto, really) on this site. It's a keeper.

I love lamb but have never made it at home. This was my first time cooking it as well as my boyfriend's first taste of lamb. We both LOVED the dish. I followed the recipe as printed except I grilled versus pan cooking. I was concerned that the marinade was not enough for the chops and will likely double the next time, but all in all it was a wonderful meal!! A definite keeper!

Wonderful flavor. I used the full marinade amount for half the quantity of lamb, because that was all I had, and the flavor balance was good. I did use fresh-ground cardamom, which is much stronger than preground. The lime is unexpected but delicious.

This was great! and easy and fast!! However, I greatly increased some ingredients and added a few refinements. I quadrupled most amounts, as I love highly flavored foods. For 2 lamb chops (it was just me!!), I used about 1 tblsp each of whole cardamom and cumin, freshly ground (not powdered), 3 cloves of garlic, pepper and salt (less salt than the recipe for health reasons), and about a 1/2 cup of lime juice. I added sautéed red onions and mushrooms, and deglazed the pan with additional lime juice (maybe 1/3 cup). In future, Id also use more lime juice and/or white wine)for deglazing. It was, however, delicious. My family is Swedish, which explains my familiarity and fondness for cardamom. This is a delicious, flavorful and little used spice which adds immeasurably to this dish.

I have made this for parties several times and this dish always gets raves. It's simple, elegant, and extremely tasty.

I used shoulder chops and doubled the cumin and cardamom (as recommended by another reviewer) and let it marinate 30 mins (because I forgot about it while playing World of Warcraft), but otherwise made the recipe as written. Excellent! Very tasty and a pleasant change from my usual rosemary or oregano treatment. The lime adds a zing of freshness, but it also helps offset the greasy issue that lamb can have (esp. with the less expensive cuts).

A note to the person from San Diego about the Cardamin (sp). Cardiman is wonderful in baking especially if you are adding cinnamon. I add a pinch to any store bought cake mix and it adds something wonderful.

very nice combination of flavors - marinated the lamb for about 2 hrs, served with orzo and brussel sprouts

I cut part of a leg of lamb into bite sized pieces, doubled the spices and the lime juice and everyone asked for the recipee. An awesome change from mint-rosemary.

This was good but I expected more flavor. The lime came through but the spices...not so much...and I marinated the chops for 30 minutes. Next time I think I will double the cumin and cardamom for a more robust flavor.

This recipe was shockingly easy and tasty. It was simple, refined, and delicious. The chops that we purchased were at least an inch thick so it took 5 minutes per side for medium rare, but aside from that, I look forward to preparing this dish again and again. I completed the meal with gingered yams and garlic green beans (as recommended by another reviewer) The results were a beautiful presentation and a satisfying meal.

Ok, so I messed up a little bit, and forgot to add the lime to the marinade, but it turned out very good. I used a little more garlic than the recipe called for, and a little more black pepper. I'm looking forward to trying it with the lime, but it's quite good without.

I have always believed that lamb and veal chops were weekday meals with weekend dinner costs. They are quick to cook yet too expensive to have often. With no time, a little salt and pepper, and a good grill or grill pan you have the basis of a quick meal. This recipe is an excellent use of those chops, if you can afford them. I made it as written except marinating as long as I needed to fix the rest of the meal (no comment on the silly cook who changed everything in the recipe but the stove). Excellent with rice and a salad. Next time I may add a side of chutney but it was an exotic dinner even without this addition. I recommend the combination of flavors.

You know, I thought that this marinade was lacking a little in flavor, even despite the fact that I rocked it for 90 minutes or so. Also, I used leg lamb chops. Perhaps this is a particularly robust cut? Anyway, it way yummy, but mostly only in the sense that lamb is yummy to begin with. Does anyone know about this leg v rib issue?

Typical San Diego moron below. The only thing this dimwit left in the original recipe was the stove, yet she proceeds to give it a rating. Probably a marine.

I made this for company and it was a huge hit. I used lamb loin chops which were quite thick so I put them in the oven for a few before braising them in the skillet. It's worth it to get the bottle of ground cardamom for that exotic taste. The garlic was a nice touch too and it went good with my green beans w/ garlic butter. The leftovers were delicious too.

Excellent and easy! MNext time I will decrease the garlic a bit and decrease the heat to let the spices comeout more.

I made the recipe exactly as shown (isn't that the point!) and it was excellent. I have to laugh at reviewers like the one from San Diego below, who completely change the recipe, and then rate it after they have altered it to a completely different recipe. It's a waste of time for everyone. I can understand 1-2 modifications--but otherwise, submit your new recipe at another location.

This recipe has never let me down. It takes only minutes to prepare and minutes to make. I have found that if you let it marinate a few minutes longer than the 15 suggested in the recipe the flavor intensefies- creating layers of taste. It helps to cover the pan for a few minutes while searing-- to keep cooking even and chops moist. I disagree with a few other commentators though-- THIS IS NOT an eastern asian dish. This marinade really stands alone without the aid of soy or sesame oil. If the chops are cooked at a medium to low temp-- the Cumin, cardamom,lime and garlic stay in tact. If the pan is to hot it can deaden the delicate ingredients. This dish also makes great lunch the day after!

I used the suggestions of the two reviewers and made some substitutions of my own to make it Thai. I omitted cardamom. As one reviewer suggested, I used soy sauce and sesame oil. I also added about 1 tbl fish sauce, 1 tea mint, ~1/4 tea lemongrass paste and ~1/4 tea cilantro paste. I also increased the lime juice using a full lime. I also marinated longer as suggested by one reviewer. An hour worked fine. It was an awesome dish.

Use the marinade, add more garlic, add a 1/4 cup of soy sauce a squirtas of sesame oil, and scallions. Serve on top of Sprout salad with mint-yogurt dressing. Cover lamb chops with mango chutney recipie that is found on this site. Guests said its the best lamb they've ever eaten.

This recipe did nothing for me even though I was attracted to the ingredient combination. I marinated the lamb 15 minutes according to the recipe. This did not impart enough flavor in the lamb. Lamb has a robust flavor and this would need at least a few hours marinated. I will marinate it next time for much longer since I like the ingredients. However I will add pickled lemon (homemade the Moroccan way) and parsley, cilantro or oregano for the green flavor and presentation

A typical sized spice jar of ground cardamom cost me $13 today and I started to wonder if it was worth it for the scant 1/4 tsp in the recipe. YES! These chops were yummy, yummy, yummy. While preparing Israeli Couscous with butternut squash and preserved lemon (recipe also on this site), I lost track of time and marinated the chops for a little over an hour. The flavors were so great, I'll use the same timing when I prepare these chops again. One other thing, I grilled them because the glorious California weather permitted and I prefer this method of cooking to almost all others, if only for the limited clean up.

I used lime juice from a bottle (though it was purportedly the real stuff) rather than squeezing my own, and I probably let it marinate for too long -- the dish the first night tasted too much like lime juice. The leftovers, however, tasted MUCH better. I would make this again just for the leftover portions.

Delicious and easy. I too used loin chops--they were about 1 1/2 inches thick, so I cooked them for 6 minutes on each side, which made them about medium rare. Really great.

This was a very quick, really tasty recipe. The spice combination is out of this world!! I found it to be really unique and different. We prefer the meat cooked a bit more, and actually ended up cooking approximately 6-7 minutes on each side. It was delicious!

Almost wept with the goodness of this. Made with itty-bitty lamb loin chops, divided recipe in half, and it was soooooo yummy. Chops were about 1" thick, and cooked for 5 minutes total, were very rare but just perfect. As a bonus, it was incredibly simple.

This is a simple, fast, tasty recipe--very nice. My lamb chops were still partly frozen--I put them in the plastic bag with the marinade and put the whole thing in water. In the 15 minutes recommended they were ready to cook. Great for a quick week night dinner.

Usually we grill lamb chops but if you want to cook them on top of the stove, try this. Nice flavors.

This recipe is great! It was easy to make, and delicious. You taste the garlic on the outside, and the Indian spices on the inside. I can't praise this recipe enough! After I made this recipe 3-4 times, I decided to try grilling it. That turned out extremely well - although grilling takes much, much longer than the method described in the recipe (I think it took 20 minutes or more -you need to keep checking and moving the lamb, if your grill has cooler and hotter spots). My girlfriend is a restaurant manager/caterer, and she insisted that it was the best lamb she ever had, even though we bought the wrong cut of meat and substituted additional olive oil for lime juice!
