Two eggs was quite a bit (and I used 1 3/4 lb. of asparagus too...) but fine. I liked that the dish held up well for a long time -- was perfect for the picnic I took it too.

I really liked this, but it wasn't quite as special as I thought it would be. Also, the recipe makes a lot of egg - I will halve that part next time. The dressing was great. Oh, and I found that the asparagus was over-cooked when I followed the directions, so I'll just cook them the way I prefer next time. Definitely a great, easy, elegant side dish.

Wonderful recipe. I sued a cilantro pepper vinegar and it was just as good. Served along witht he deep fried poached eggs and the results were spectacular. My guests are still taking about the meal. This is a classic, elegant dish.

Very nice touch to holiday meal. No need to trim stalks, just snap the tough end off.

Was a light and pleasant side dish to a very rich rib roast. Used one bunch of asparagus and one boiled egg; made four servings.

This is INCREDIBLE - I made it absolutely to the recipe, and wouldn't change a thing. I'll be making this many, many times in the future.
