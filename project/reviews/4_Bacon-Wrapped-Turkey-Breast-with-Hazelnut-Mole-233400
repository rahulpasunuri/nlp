This is absolutely one of the best turkey recipes I have ever made. I am going to try it for Thanksgiving. The turkey was moist and very flavorful. I made a different mole sauce due to time constraints but the turkey could adapt well to almost any variation of mole sauce. Yum!!

I live in Italy and at around 3.30 pm on Thanksgiving day decided I needed a bit of nostalgia and so got a 2 pound boneless, skinless turkey breast, found this recipe and made it when I got home. Obviously, there were some adjustments: my marinade was drier than I expected and not so bountiful; I marinaded the breast for about three hours, wrapped it up in (not enough) bacon, and then baked it under foil in the plate it had been marinading in. Took the foil off for the last 10 minutes and was pleasantly surprised--very flavorful (since most of the marinate was still there), moist, really delicious, though not quite as pretty as the picture (my tying techniques are rather underdeveloped). A big success with all the guests (there were four of us). I'd be interested in trying it with the mole but that sounds like a lot of work so I prolly won't.

I served this on Christmas Eve two years in a row, and it's very good. It is a lot of work and I always mean to make the mole further in advance than I do. In addition to tasting really good, it looks pretty (just like the picture). I agree it does not need all the bacon the recipe calls for.

I made this for thanksgiving this year and it was out of this world! I cut the mole recipe in half and served it on the side. The turkey was moist and delicious, all of my guests proclaimed their thansgiving turkey had been forever changed. Next time I make this I will not make the mole. Even cutting it in half produced a massive amount. It was delicious but not necessary.

I know that mole is a labor of love! This is the second and I fear the last time I will devote this much time to a mole. I was having a Mexican dinner theme. So, if you're hell bent on mole this is a good recipe. My guest loved it. (But what would they say knowing the HOURS spent?) If someone has additional info on mole I would greatly appreciate it.

I made the mole several days before Christmas, and while it took a while, I did not think it was so much work that I would not make this again. I did not have a problem with the bay leaves - but I pureed it in my Cusinart and then ran a hand held beater through the mole to blend it even more. The turkey was great, but took longer to cook than the recipe said.

Warning! Bay leaves are very sharp and do not puree very well. I don't agree with the recipe to add bay leaf to the marinade since my guests were picking bits of bay out of their mouths during dinner. (This, using a Cuisinart Pro processor.) Next time, I would leave the bay leaves whole, let them infuse the marinade overnight, then discard them after the 2nd overnight marinade of the turkey. The turkey needs to roast on a rack since the bacon will render a lot of fat and the turkey shouldn't be sitting in the fat. The bacon didn't cook very crisply given the low heat, so I discarded it after cooking the turkey. I used beautiful applewood smoked bacon, cut thin, but would consider using proscuitto next time. Extra mole can be frozen and reused for other dishes. I didn't like the little bits of hazelnut in the mole I made. I might have used a coarse strainer on the mole next time.

THIS WAS VERY EXPENSIVE TO MAKE AND MADE WAY TOO MUCH SAUCE. TOO MUCH WORK FOR THE FLAVOR

Guests loved this dish and I recommend boning a turkey breast yourself for this, so you can use the bone, skin, etc. for some broth. If you do that early enough you can use the broth for the mole. One pound of bacon is more than ample for the two breast halves. I made my usual mole from Rick Bayless's cookbooks and the serrano poblano corn pudding, the salad, the mushrooms in escabeche, and the Mexican chocolate mousse with cinnamon almond cookies. The entire menu was outstanding and I will definitely make this again.

This dish was great. I recommend the boneless skinless turkey breast for presentation (easy to debone if you have a whole one) because the bacon wrap would be weird over turkey skin. And the bacon keeps it all tidy and makes nice slices. I found that 1/2 pound of bacon per breast half is fine; I don't think you could even put a whole pound on a half breast so that may be a typo. And it tucked under securely so I didn't use string to tie it. Pretty easy. Also, I added 1 1/2 squares of unsweetened chocolate to the mole and it was great. A note: the mole is fruitier than most, so don't serve a "sweetish" vegetable...kale was good with it. Everybody had seconds.

I made this for Christmas Eve. I substituted a canned mole as I ran out of time. No hazelnuts, but the chocolate added an interesting touch. Everyone raved and I few leftovers.

Did this recipe for Christmas dinner, with a bone in breast. Pulled the skin away from the meat and put the marinade between the skin and meat and on top of the skin, then but a pound of bacon on top of the skin. Also added one chili from the adobo sauce from canned chipotles, turned out very nice, would do this again.

Made this for our annual gift dinner we do for friends. Used a Pork Loin as most were having turkey for X-mas dinner. Everyone gave it 4 stars. The corn pudding on the menu was another outstanding dish. Makes a lot so cook extra meet to add to the mole for great leftovers.

I appreciate the help on figuring out finding the recipe for the mole. I would never have known to click on the title. Had about decided that somehow the first nine ingredients were the mole.

I made the mole and the turkey for Thanksgiving and it was amazing. I do however recommend making the mole in advance as it is very time consuming. Also it is very tricky getting the bacon around the turkey breast. I may not look like the picture, but it tastes heavenly.

just click on the words "hazelnut mole" in the ingredients list - that will give you the recipe for that portion

Again it appears that proof reading was left out. Where does the hazelnut mole come into play?

Am I the only one who just doesn't get the "hazelnut" part of this recipe?
