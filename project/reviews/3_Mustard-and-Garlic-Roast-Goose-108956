Wasn't too excited about this dish. The goose cooks quickly and the Mustard Garlic Glaze doesn't make for the most attractive goose while it rests. This review may be more just because I am not too fond of goose. But at least I tried it.

For the past three years we've had this at either Thanksgiving (along with turkey) or Christmas. It is so easy and good. I don't make the stock--just use homemade chicken stock. My husband's German family looks forward to it and some of my family have become fans as well.

NO forks! That's what my family... is demonstrating. The ONLY one looking forward to the LEFTOVERS is the DOG! She's in the chips, becuase there's lots leftover. Fortunately we had plenty of potatoes & veggies. Plain salted/peppered natural cracklin' skin's better than the mustard mix-match. How could something sound so possibly positive (& get the forks) & be so...so? If you want to do something different, try a peking duck spice glaze. The ONLY thing that works on this is the temperature settings/changes, but I do that anyway.

NO forks, that's what my family says! I can't understand all the rave reviews, not only did I have no juices seperation for gravy, but the goose was better where it was just natural cracklin' skin salted & peppered. The mustard mix - enh? If you want to try something different, try a peking duck glaze or just leave it be, if your goose is cooked right it shouldn't be dry (aftter all they are so rich & fatty!) The ONLY ting I agree with is the temperature methodology, but then, that's the way I'd do it anyway. This was so UNmemorable, NO one is looking ofrward to the leftovers (except the DOG)

I made this for Christmas dinner when it came out in 2003. It was so good, my husband asks, "Are we having goose again this year?" The mustard and garlic mixture gives it a fantastic flavor. If you struggle with turning it with tongs, just put on a pair of heavy duty rubber gloves and turn with your hands. Works like a charm.

I had never cooked goose before, but i had ordered one for christmas dinner - what a brilliant surprise. This dish was both easy and delicious. I didnt have a V-pan, so I just turned the goose over and didn't worry about cooking the sides. Also I stuffed an quatered orange inside just to give it a orange kick. I am going to cook a goose every year.

Why the other person had a problem with this recipe, I don't understand. Their review put me off from making it, but we had a guest who is a goose fanatic, so I thought I'd try. It was so simple, and the goose was extremely moist and flavorful. We loved the coating--it gave a great depth of flavor. A real winner!!

I have never cooked a Goose over water before, I shall always cook it this way as it kept it moist and stopped it from drying out. The Mustard/Garlic mixture was great, it added that little bit extra without taking away the flavour of the Goose. I will definately be using this recipe again and will probably use the same method to cook Duck.

What a waste of time! This recipe is very time consuming and not worth the trouble. I had to put the pan in the freezer to get the fat out of the juice before making the gravy. The gravy was bland and involved many steps to make. I may as well have skipped the marinade for the goose since the flavor was completely lost. I'm not opposed to spending a lot of time with a recipe so long as it is worth it. This was my first time having goose. I think it tastes a lot like duck, but cost 3 times the amount of money. Not worth it at all.

I made this recipe for Christmas Day and everyone loved it. The mustard and garlic made a delicious coating. It was the first time I had cooked a goose and I will certainly make it again. I saved some of the fat and used it in a roux for some gumbo I made with the leftover bird. That too, was delicious.

This is the BEST goose I've ever made. Juicy, tender, and the coating is delicious. I made it as a trial run for Christmas, and I'm making it again on the 25th!

Thanksgiving 2003... Best goose we ever roasted, so moist and tasty. The cooking method in itself is wonderful. It was perfectly delicious.
