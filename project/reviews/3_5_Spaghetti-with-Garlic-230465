Although this recipe did not taste bad, I found it to be on the bland side. It needs something to kick up the flavors.

you have to be careful not to overcook the garlic!

I thought this recipe was great. It's very simple and you can add different ingredients such as broccoli and chicken to vary the dish. The flavor of the garlic when it is cooked this way is really amazing and I love the crunch!

There are a million versions of this dish, but none is better than this one. Especially when incorporating the review comments. I used small cloves cut in halves or quarters as advised. I think that if you do that, you have to turn up the heat on the oil a bit. I've made this a few times and when the garlic was cooked at a lower heat as recommended in the recipe, it just got mushy and soft. If you're using slivers, I understand the low heat. But if you're using bigger pieces of garlic as most who've adapted the recipe are, the oil needs to be a bit hotter. FWIW, I've learned that I like a little more garlic, more lemon rind and more parmesan than the recipe calls for. With the addition of asparagus, this pasta recipe has become my daughter's favorite meal.

This pasta is amazing! We have made it many times, and every time we make it, it seems to get better and better. Wouldn't change a thing about it!

Thought this was very good but needed more garlic...believe it or not. Couldn't tell it was there unless you got a piece which wasn't too often. (When you did it was FABULOUS!!), would also increase pepper flakes, didn't notice that at all. Great start to a great side dish, just play with it to your taste. Served it with homemade parmesan crusted chicken breasts...gourmet!

This is delicious. Made it for Sunday supper with a big Italian salad. I used whole wheat pasta - and will never use the other again!

I have been making a version of this for many years (sauteed chopped garlic in oil, removed and discarded...) but this recipe is so superior! Thanks to the Long Island cook for the idea of cutting the garlic in half. The cooked cloves were so luscious! Since there are just 2 of us to cook for, I made enough to sauce just 1/2 lb. of spaghetti. I used about 15 cloves of garlic but I used the full 1/4 cup of olive oil to cook them in...and also used the full 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes. I used a combo of fresh oregano and Italian Parsley and didn't have a fresh lemon, so used lemon juice. A great recipe which lends itself to lots of variations!

Followup - I made this again, added more lemon juice and chili sauce, browned the garlic in halves then cut them a bit smaller before adding to the pasta. My husband agreed this was delicious, the garlic flavor and texture perfect. No leftovers and I'm already craving it again!

Loved this! Cut cloves in half as previous reviewers suggested. Added anchovy paste to oil and added nice flavor. Make it as mild or hot as you like depending on amount of red pepper. Didn't need extra olive oil the pasta water did the trick. The carmelized garlic really makes this special!

A cup of garlic to less than a 1/2 cup of olive oil and a pound of pasta is WAY, WAY, WAY too much! Versions of this dish that I've made over the years call for 4 to 6 cloves, which is plenty for even the most ardent garlic lover. The idea that if a little is good, a lot is better, ruins most dishes, and in this case, it's carried to a silly extreme, resulting on a dish that most people would find inedible.

Yes, 4 forks, it was great, and for the person who said it doesnt deserve 4 forks because of subsitutions, Isn't that what recipes are all about, catering them for what "you" like! Then you just "add" and or "sub" something. Geeze Relax, have some wine, and enjoy the food!

I made a 1/4 recipe as a test, before investing 30 cloves of garlic I wanted to try it. I cut the cloves in half instead of slicing them, used lemon juice instead of the zest and didn't add the extra oil at the end. I put in half the browned garlic and tasted it, then cut the remaining garlic into thinner pieces. I was in garlic heaven! I agree it could use a little 'zing' but it was still 4 forks for me! I will add a little more lemon and chili the next time. I would still brown the garlic in halves though, the soft/crunchy texture was perfect. Even better than roasted garlic, which I love.

This is a traditional Italian pasta dish meant to accompany several (7) fish courses on La Vigil, Christmas Eve. It's not used as a stand alone pasta meal.

Fantastic for garlic lovers! I cut the garlic in half to save time, used lemon juice in place of zest and added mushrooms. I made it with capellini (similar to spaghettini, only thinner). Sprinkled with grated parmesan before serving. Great comfort food.

I do not like garlic in my food unless I can't see it. Hence, taking the suggestion of the cook from Long Island, I fried the garlic slowly until soft, then mashed it roughly into a paste. I substituted chilli flakes for pepper flakes. It was unbelievably good for something that uses such simple ingredients!

yum and simple! my garlic turned out great even though i was a bit apprehensive. i will try out the suggestion to NOT slice them thin. nice change from typical spaghetti dinner with heavy sauce.

This is worth 4 forks because it's a classic basic recipe. It is a solid foundation for endless variations (or none--it's great in its most simple form). I added about 4 anchovies to the garlic as I was sauteeing it. I thought that would be enough salt, so I didn't add any more at the end (until we were eating and found it needing more salt). I have madt the thinly sliced garlic before--required attention, but produces a delicious result. But tonight I followed the advice of the cook from Long Island and loved it. Keeping the garlic in larger pieces gave the texture she describes, and retained a bit of sweetness in the garlic that gets lost when it is cut thin. Try it. For those that son't want to scroll down, here's what she said: "A Cook from long island on 09/07/04 Being a native born italian, this dish has been a staple alll my life and is truly comfort food. For the best flavor, use garlic cloves similar in size, slice the in half lengthwise (just once -no thin slices!!!). Slowly saute the garlic on low heat until they soften. Then raise the heat and brown, stirring constantly so the garlic doesn't burn, but becomes a rich gold color and carmelizes. This way the garlic is crunchy on the outside and creamy and gooey on the inside. Add whatever you like, capers, olives, sun dried tomatoes; but the fewer ingredients the better, to enjoy the delicious garlic flavor!!"

I have enjoyed a variation of this recipe for many years. I use freshly ground black pepper and a splash or so of white wine in place of the red pepper and lemon juice. I usually cook the spaghetti in a lg pot and as it drains, I slowly saute the garlic and pepper in olive oil. When the garlic is golden, I return the spaghetti to the pot and coat it with oil. Then I grate about a cup of parmesean cheese and stir it in just before removing from the heat. Pass with additional grated cheese...Mmm Mmm good. My number one comfort food. I usually enjoy it with crusty bread, and Italian pickled vegetables...

I had to write again and thank the native Italian cook who lives on Long Island. Cutting the cloves in half and cooking them that way was great. It was like having my own little bowl of roasted garlic and I spread some on my bread also. How awesome to have that flavor with out having to roast garlic!

What I add is 1 tablespoon of lemon zest, 1 package of thawed artichoke hearts, sliced the long way, parmesean cheese, and then mix with angel hair pasta. Put back in the pan, poor over the top beaten eggs to cover. Brown the bottom, stick in the oven to brown and cook through.

What a great dish, I have beeen eating this for a week. I made it for a base for my meatballs and sauce and pushed all that aside and as a base for my chicken parm. I use angel hair as a personal choice. I am going to try the tip from the lady who grew up in Italy and just cut the cloves in half. All this controversy over slicing. Cut the bottom so it is level, get a sharp knife, pay attention and slice. Really!

Try adding a can of anchovies. Have been making this recipe for years, always a quick hit.

I, too, thought this dish was bland. I added lemon juice along with the lemon zest. Also a good amount of parmesean cheese. I think it is a good basic recipe, but definitely needs to have additions...maybe capers, or olives, or artichokes...something with a zing to it to give this dish more depth and flavor.

YUMMY! It is well worth the time to prepare this as written. Specifically slicing the garlic thinly. I think this is essential in order to bring out the flavor after sauteeing. This recipe will be a regular in my menus.

Though I have yet to prepare this recipe as written, this is reminiscent of pepperoncini pasta -- simple, elegant and yes, extremely flavorful. Suggestion for slicing the garlic: if any of you have a Japanese grocery/market nearby, you will find a simple hand-held slicer which I use for slicing garlic, fresh ginger, carrots for salads, cucumbers, etc. The Japanese make wonderful blades/cutting instruments -- think samurai sword tradition! These hand-held slicers make rather quick work of slicing almost anything -- just be careful when you get within 2 cm of the end 'cause you'll need to watch you don't run your fingertips across the blade. While you are at the Japanese grocery, check out all the other handy gadgets. You'll be amazed at the range and function of the various kitchen tools.

i like this because it is easy quick, and not heavy. An elegant version of the poor mans pasta. BTW i used crushed garlic from a jar instead of slicing fresh garlic.

Fantastic flavors. Simple. Please disregard the solicitor who directed you to the PamperedChef garlic press - as someone else noted, that's not at all appropriate for this recipe. We took the advice of Anthony Bourdain and threw ours away. We have never been happier - one less thing cluttering the kitchen drawer. IMHO.

I don't understand how you get 4 forks when EVERY comment adds substitutions and/or more ingredients. I think this is a great basic staple which needs everyones personal adjusting (just slicing the garlic took more time than the total recipe called for)

What a treat to find a recipe where all the ingredients are available here. Made it last night and my husband loved it.

A tip on peeling garlic- try holding it by either end, twisting gently back and forth once and the peel loosens all over and virtually drops off. Better and any gadget. My garlic slicer kept clogging up when I tried using it for this, so I hand sliced. Definately do not use a garlic mincer/smasher/press- the end result would not be at all the same.

I make a very similiar dish but I add a can of anchovies (rolled w/ capers) when cooking the garlic; when water is added the anchovies disappate when stirring and adds a delicious flavor. I would omit the lemon flavoring if using the anchovies and you won't need salt

Oh My Gosh! This recipe is Amazing!! It's easy and absolutely YUMMY! The whole family raved. I took the liberty of making a couple of changes: I used a mix of about 1/2 the parsley and added about 1/2 c fresh chpd basil. Also, I accidentally drained the pasta without reserving the pasta water so couldn't add any but didn't try to compensate for that and it was fine. I omitted the final 1 1/2 T Olive Oil and instead heated about 2 T butter in the emptied skillet, quickly heated up some pre-grilled and sliced chicken breast with the remaining cooked garlic and tossed that into the pasta/garlic in the bowl. It was Fabulous and I'll be making this frequently.

On the plus side: this is the way to prepare this dish, too many greasy-spoon Italian joints just throw five dozen raw cloves and a quart of oil on top of a plate of spaghetti, but you really need the other ingredients to bring out the flavor and keep it from being boring. On the minus side: it's GARLIC, not "garilc" ;)
