Interesting combinations of flavours. I didn't bother with roasting the pepper or blanching the tomaotes and it still turned out very tasty. I also used anchovy paste to save more time. I added about a 1/4 cup of vegetable broth because the sauce seemed a bit dry. I might add more basil next time.

I thought that the eggplant and pepper did not add a lot to what is essentially a "puttanesca" type sauce - I would have preferred the classic anchovy-black olive-caper combo. And no one asked for seconds - a most unusual event at my table. I expected more from this recipe.

Nick Stellino has a dish almost exactly like this in one of his cookbooks. One of my favorites. If you have not made this dish TRY IT!

We loved it with a few modifications. I put the salted eggplant in a colander and after thirty minutes, squeezed the juice out of the eggplant and patted it dry. I used two 14-1/2 oz. cans of diced tomatoes, drained. I reduced the olive oil to 1/4 c., I chopped the garlic, and left it in when I sauteed the eggplant. I used an entire can of anchovy fillets. When I added the last round of ingredients, I added about 1/2 c. water, as it was a bit dry, and then didn't need to simmer the sauce for as long as the recipe called for. It was outstanding, reminiscent of both Pasta Puttanesca, and ratatouille.

It's a different type of sauce than most people are used to, but I when served it at a large dinner party (doubling the recipe), the dish went very quickly! The only drawback is that the recipe is rather time-consuming, so it would make good weekend-dinner fare.

I love making this dish, and have made it a number of times, always gaining rave reviews from my fellow diners. Under time constraints, I have also made this with canned stewed tomatoes which also work pretty well.
