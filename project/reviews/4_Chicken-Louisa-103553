This chicken recipe is really superb! I prepared the recipe following the instructions exactly, without changing a thing. Also, I served the chicken with wild rice, which was perfect since the sauce is to die for! You can serve this dish at your most elegant dinner party and your guests will rave as they devour their dinner.

I substituted 15% cream for heavy cream and used vermouth. It was delicious with mashed potatoes and string beans. I loved the taste of the tarragon.

Good, simple recipe with a lot of strong flavor. The fresh tarragon is key since dried doesn't really impart the same flavor. I also add balsamic vinegar to this to give it a little extra kick. Very nice dish!

Excellent recipe which was the start of my advanced cooking hobby. Easy yet seemingly difficult and incredibly gourmet. Taught me that even novices can do cream reduction sauces. The tarragon really puts it over the top as many non-cooks are unable to identify it's distinctly exotic taste.

This is the first meal in recent memory that has gotten raves from my 2 picky girls. I used 1/2 c fat free sour cream thinned with skim milk to make 3/4 c, and I skipped the bouillon (it had a lot of juices). Used dried tarragon vs fresh. Really terrific!

This was delicious! I cut the cutlets up into 3 smaller pieces each, so it cooked a little more quickly, and I didn't have bouillon, so I used salted butter and poultry spice. It came out great, it was really easy, and I will definitely make it again

Everyone in my picky family likes it - AND it's easy and fast. How great is that. Made it with buttermilk because that's the only thick stuff I had, and used dried basil instead of tarragon. Smelled a little funny when I was cooking it but it came out so well, I made it again the next week! Be careful not to overcook the cutlets.

Easy to make and very good. I did not use all heavy cream (1/2 light cream half milk) and used a large can (28oz) of diced tomatoes, drained and used dried tarragon, But what is an extra large bouillon cube? I used a full 2 cup cube and it was a bit too salty. Probably should use 1/2 of that, which retrospectively is probably how it was meant. Definitlely will make again

I made it with the following changes (due to what I had on hand): half and half instead of cream, (dried) herbs de provance instead of tarragon, and vine-ripe tomatoes instead of plum.

This recipe is quick and delicious. I made it almost exactly as written except used half&half and fresh sage since that is what I had on hand. I served the chicken and sauce over orzo (which I cooked like a risotto.) One note, at the table I sprinkled grated parmesan on the dish and wow, it brought the dish up a notch. The parmesan helped add a bit of "saltiness" that the dish was missing.

Absolutely delicious!! I could not locate fresh tarragon so I sub'd with basil, used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream, forgot the bulliion cube (which I will be sure to include next time). I didn't feel like pounding out cutlets, so I used boneless skinless breasts cooked all according to instructions, then put everything into a baking dish and finished, covered, on 350 for about 20 minutes. We absolutely loved the flavors, the freshness of the sauce and ease of preparation. This is going to be a repeat performer at my home!!

I love this recipe not only for its taste but also it's simplicity, quick prep, and its appeal to kids. Without cream in the house and no time to shop, I took a tip from a depression-era relative and substituted whole condensed milk for the cream - a little can is about right. Obviously not as good as the real thing, but in a pinch it worked fine. Real cream and fresh tarragon will put this in the four fork category, I bet.

Bravo! Loved this dish as did my family (husband went back for seconds and thirds)! I followed the recipe exactly except I pounded the chicken breasts to about 1/4" before sauteing. Also, didn't have any shallots (duh) so used one clove garlic and 1/4 cup of white onion. Outta this world. Sometimes I think all this great cooking is what keeps my marriage working :)

This was soooo easy to prepare & truly delicious. My family doesn't like tarragon, but I love it so I used it anyway & crossed my fingers- they LOVED it. It adds just a hint of sweetness, and makes this dish extraordinary, taking it from everyday Italian to French. Used chicken stock instead of bouillon, and served over rice pasta. Will make again... and again.

My guests liked this more than I did. To keep the cream from curdling, add a bit of the hot liquid to the cream before adding the cream to the pan -- I had no problems with this. My tomatoes could have been better (after all, I made this in January) -- perhaps peeling them would have helped. Left out the bouillion cube. Served with pecan rice -- a nice accompaniment. Next time, I think I will add some drained, canned artichoke quarters and/or a sprinkle of parmesan. Very easy & tasty with potential for improvement.

I made this recipe today, for our Sunday Brunch Buffet. *Yes I made some changes/additions, however, I do not feel that they took away from this great recipe, but simply made a richer version. PS: Everyone loved it. I used Chicken Tenders, (skinned/boneless breasts) pounded and floured them. I did use both garlic & Shallots. I did add sliced white button mushrooms (this really gave it that extra UMPH to the flavor IMO). I also added a pinch of red pepper flakes-a litle more UMPH. Other then that I followed the recipe exactly and served it over rice. Flavors were great, Chicken breasts were melt in your mouth. This is a great recipe. I also think it would be fun to play around with. I'm thinking maybe adding toasted corn, to the mix? I think that would be excellent too. Thanks! Dee in Fallbrook, @ Brother's Bistro

This recipe is very good. It does however have one fatal flaw. It tells you to add the cream to a hot liquid. I knew better, forgot, and had curdled liquid. I'm glad I wasn't serving to guests.

Excellent, easy week-night meal. Whole family loves it. This has been a regular menu item for years. I cook the chicken on lower heat after browning so the meat doesn't toughen up. Sometimes, I cut the chicken into strips, and use the chicken and "sauce" over fettucine. Yum!

Very good and the sauce is wonderful! I had everything ready to go when I realized I was out of cream..so I added a bit of chicken stock in place of the bouillion cube and when it has cooked down a bit, I added several spoonfuls of sour cream and reheated slowly.

I'm delighted I saved this recipe to My Recipe Box in June of 2000 although I never made it until the other day. Although using two rather than four chicken breasts (2 people for dinner), I made the full amount of sauce as I usually do. One medium to small regular tomato replaced the 4 plum tomatoes called for which we agreed was better; otherwise, the sauce would have been too "tomatoey" for us. No chicken bouillon cube on hand so reduced about 1/2 cup chicken broth (low sodium as always) to 1/4 or less cup which worked out just fine. I'm really glad I made this. It would be just fine for company, too.

Very delicious, very easy recipe. I was hesitant about using the tarragon, since I read that it is supposed to taste like licorice (and I hate licorice). I tried it anyway and was pleasantly surprised. I think it would also be fun to experiment with other herbs, like basil as previous reviewers have suggested. I will definitely be preparing this dish in the future!

This is an excellent chicken recipe. I substitute basil for the tarragon and serve the dish over roughly mashed red potatoes made with cream and butter - roasted asparagus finishes off the meal. It is delicious and perfect for a dinner party as it can be adjusted to serve 2 or 12.

Rating: 4
I used this recipe to teach a friend how to cook a bit - perfect recipe to hitch on a sous-chef! :) He did most of the chopping and peeling, and made mashed potatoes, and I attended to this, and it was great. I think marinating the chicken a bit before cooking it would make it a bit juicier, which I will try if/when I make this again. I used a mix of light and heavy cream to make it a bit less fatty, but other than that no changes. Tarragon is a fabulous flavour in this dish!

Rating: 4
I now make this recipe once a week, it's our family favorite with just a couple of tweaks made to the original recipe. I pound the chicken flat, dredge it lightly in flour before I sauté it. Instead of a bouillon cube, I deglaze the pan with chicken broth allowing it to completely evaporate before I add the wine. I use basil instead of tarragon and about a cup of regular cream which I let cook down for a bit to thicken. Absolutely delicious!

Got this recipe from a co-worker and loved it. She suggested that I used drained canned diced tomatoes as a time saver. Accidentally picked up a can with grenn chilles added to the tomatoes and it was excellent. I agree that the fresh tarragon is key to this recipe. Gives a different flavor than basil would. I also added a touch of flour to thicken the sauce. Also a great sauce over salmon. We had extra sauce and some leftover grilled salmon the next night and it was fabulous!

Doh! Replacing the tarragon with basil makes a completely different dish. The whole point of this recipe is the tarragon! If you do it properly (season the chicken, reduce the wine, use ripe tomatoes), I'd be very surprised at anyone finding the end result bland. Replacing the tarragon with basil just makes yet another Italian-esque creamy tomato sauce. With tarragon (add a little mustard if you like), the resulting sauce is complex and delicious.

I made this for the first time for company, and I didn't screw it up! I read all these reviews first, and decided to go with basil and grape tomatoes. Worked great! My brush with screwing it up came when I realized too late that I didn't have a boullion cube, after all. I ended up using half a packet of chicken ramen noodle seasoning, and it was just fine. Served it with new potatoes with chive butter (Gourmet), green beans, and brown sugar pound cake with strawberries and whipped cream. Everyone raved.

The sauce was delicious, the meal was awesome. Made it with Amy's Basil Risotto (good but too much basil, go figure) - didn't use tarragon, used basil instead, and sprinkled garlic powder on the cutlets - also added a couple of cloves of pressed garlic to the pan with the shallot. Again, simple to make and delicious to boot!

I really did not like this at first and gave it 1 fork after following the recipe (substituting dried marjoram and basil for tarragon), but the next day I added more ingredients to the leftovers and it was much better. Try adding the following: 1 1/2 cups chopped fresh tomatoes, extra marjoram and basil, red pepper flakes, 1/2 teaspoon Tabasco, Tony Chacherie's seasoning, and vodka and serve over pasta. It desperately needs the extra spices. I still suggest trying a different chicken recipe - besides, this one isn't worth the extra calories the heavy cream adds!

Excellent. I doubled the sauce and served over Basmati rice. I used dried tarragon and at the last minute realized I didn't have enough (1 teap dried = 1 tblsp fresh). Even with half the seasoning, it was still good. I took another reviewer's advice and added the full carton of cream (otherwise it would just go bad in the frig). I also thickened with flour. I think I may use mushrooms instead of chicken next time. It was easy, but I wouldn't cook this on a regular basis for fear of massive weight gain.

My husband and I thought this was a good recipe. I modified it as follows: 4 chicken breasts, 3/4 cup chicken broth, 1/4 cup vermouth, 1.5 cup cream, 2 chopped regular tomatoes, 1 TB thyme, no bouillon cube. For best results, do not use a non-stick skillet. We made rice and asparagus as side dishes.

For something that only takes a little bit of time, really not much at all, this is an excellent recipe, inexpensive and is a surefire way to impress friends who have no idea that you just download your recipes online. I plan on one day opening a restaurant and would love to serve it.

I made this for dinner last night and my husband and I really enjoyed it. It was so simple to put together that I wasn't expecting it to be quite so good. I didn't know what I was going to do with the leftover 1/4 cup of whipping cream in the container, so I used a cup instead of the 3/4s mentioned and it came out fine. I also had to keep it simmering on the stove for a while (once I'd added the chicken) and it kept just perfectly even after a half an hour. My picky teenaged boys didn't like the tarragon, but this won't keep me from making it again.

It was excellent! I added garlic, dried intead of fresh tarragon and half and half instead of cream. In the future I would like to try the fresh Taragon but it was still worth doing with the dry.

A tasty way to use the end-of-the-season plum tomatoes from the garden. I've made this recipe three times, for my family and for company, and it's now high on my permanent list of chicken dishes. The only variation I've made was to halve the amount of tarragon. No problem--the herb still comes out front and center. Serve the dish over bowties or penne. As an added bonus, cold leftovers were the hit of a recent inpromptu picnic. Thanks, Peter. Your mother was a great inspiration!

Wonderful dish - easy to make and delicious. I used basil instead of tarragon (don't like it) and doubled the sauce. Chicken was tender, juicy and the sauce excellent. Made with mashed potatoes and green beans almandine. My husband loved it!!

This is my new favorite recipe. I doubled the sauce and added some fresh mushrooms and 4 cloves of minced garlic. I served it over spinach fettucine to add a little bit of color. I added some flour to the sauce to thicken it a bit. The fresh terragon gives it a wonderful flavor.

This was one of the best chicken dishes I've tried in a long time. My hubby said to add it to my "signature" dishes. I used tomato paste as I didn't have tomatoes and it was smooth and fabulous. Defnitely an entertaining dish.

This is awesome! I had to make a few changes (based on what was available at the time): vine tomatoes instead of plum, half and half, dried tarragon. Everything was so good. I took former cooks reviews and doubled the sauce - served it with white rice. Poured extra sauce over the rice - unbelievable. The sauce was too runny and soupy though, so I added a couple of tsp. of cornstarch to thicken it up a bit - it really worked. So good - I can't wait to eat it again!

Delicious! I made a few substitutions in in the recipe which still turned out great - I just cut up a boneless chicken breast instead of using cutlets; I used half and half instead of cream; canned, diced tomatoes instead of the plum tomatoes; and dried tarragon (the store was out of fresh.) The dish was still excellent and I'll definately make it again!

I used non-dairy creamer (less fat) and chardonnay wine which went really well with the chicken breasts. My husband loved this "gourmet" dish.

I made this on a weeknight for my family. My son (who eats very little) asked for seconds! It was very easy to make, and the taste was wonderful. Will definately save this recipe.

Excellent! I doubled the sauce, added extra tarragon, and thickened it with a bit of flour. I served it over egg noodles with a bottle of 1998 Casa Lapostolle sauvignon blanc. Even my finnicky boyfriend loved it. If you like this recipe, also try "Chicken Cutlets Veronique" from this site.

Simple, elegant and wonderfully delicious! This one is definitely a keeper. I'm not one who cooks for guests during the week but I made this dish twice in one week for different guests and they all loved it. So elegant your guests will think you spent hours preparing it just for them. The colors were fantastic. I substituted an over-the-counter cheese sauce for the heavy cream and served it over anglehair pasta. I'm sure the heavy cream would be equally scrumptious, so much so the sauce would easily work well as as soup. You might want to double the sauce because its soooo good.

Very easy! It was quite good too. I will definately make it again and would serve it to guests.
