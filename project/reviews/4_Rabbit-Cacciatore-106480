This recipe seems to be very similar to one my grandmother from the Marches did. Only she didn't add tomatoes and did add balsamic vinegar to the pan, and the rabbit sautéed in all of those herbs, wine and vinegar for a couple of hours. I use chicken parts in the same mix, but rabbit adds its own sweetness. YUM.

Made in the winter with canned tomatoes, dried herbs, and cheap Portuguese wine, and my family devoured it, including my five-year-old. Will make again, for sure, maybe try it in the slow cooker next time.

Made this almost entirely as written but did not have fresh tomatoes available (it's winter - the ones at the supermarket are grainy) so I substituted canned. This meant that I needed to thicken the sauce, and I chose to use a little bit of cornstarch. The flavor was fabulous, my boyfriend couldn't stop raving. I think it will be even better with the fresh tomatoes, when we have them in the summer. My only reservation was that I did not enjoy cutting up the rabbit or picking the little bones out of the gravy while eating. The rabbit was obviously a bunny without a head and I had the feeling I was cutting up one of my cats (silly, I know, but next time I'm having the butcher do it for me). Someone suggested pulling the meat out of the sauce, deboning, and returning the meat to the pot. I planned to do this, but the meat fell off the bones and then it was tough to find them (until I bit down on one). Maybe pull the meat off the bones earlier (or just deal with them). Overall, wonderful. Definitely something I will make again.

my mother came from Ischia. After browning the rabbit and garlic, she would add some white wine and saute some more. Then she would add tomatoes, more wine, salt and oregano, bring to a boil,lower heat,cover and cook until tender. Delicious.

This was a very easy dish to prepare and tasted wonderful. I substituted chicken and used fresh tarragon, sage, and marjoram, as that is what I had on hand. I added a about a half teaspoon of grey poupon during the final phase and it added a wonderful hint of flavor. My toddler and preschooler loved the dish over spaghetti. I will definitely make this again.

I have made this recipe many times. Any fresh herbs will do. I make the brew as described, then I remove the rabbit and let it cool. Then I remove all the meat from the bones . It serves very nicely this way and the guests aren't fighting with all those little bones. I serve it over a small pasta such as mini-penne, with fresh grated reggiano parmesean cheese. A real winner. I agree with another reviewer that a few hours of brewing is good - a more blended flavor. If cooked less the flavors are more "separate." Both ways are great and clearly a differnet taste and consistency.

This is easy with excellent results. I use rabbit but it would also be delicious with chicken. I often let it simmer for several hours, if I have time, which leads to very tender rabbit and a wonderful rich sauce.

I substituted whole chicken breasts for the rabbit in this dish, with delicious results. The sauce was rich and flavorful, and the recipe was very simple to make for a quick and elegant dinner. I am planning to make this dish again tonight.

This recipe was easy and delicious. As I was using wild rabbit increased the cooking time and cooked the rabbit until tender - a couple of hours. Also used canned tomatoes.
