A solid cheese sauce, regardless of the pasta. I tend to use hot italian snausages with penne (to soak up that cheesy goodness). It's not the best I've ever had but it's pretty good. I'll use this as a jumping off point for future experiments.

When I lived in Italy, I was taught to make this with Bel Paese, fontina, Parmegiano-Regiano, and a gorgonzola dolce - topped with a garnish of fresh parsley. The recipe here -with the goat cheese - is a pleasant variation on the recipe I was taught: a bit sharper and brighter. Recipes such as this are supposed to be consumed for special occasions, and in small quantities. An Italian would never use shellfish - or any kind of fish -with such a creamy sauce. The variation with mushrooms, and the one with spinach, however, I just might have to try! Buon appetito!

I have been making this for years and somehow just noticed the bit about pine nuts and parmesan at the end. Never before have I added those and still love this sauce. I always use an aged provolone. This is definitely a very heavy sauce that makes you feel like your arteries will clog at any minute, but it is delicious for special nights. As for leftovers, I could eat the sauce in spoonfuls and sometimes freeze it if I can't move through it fast enough. It is that yummy.

it was a very simple dish to make and serve, but did not hold up well the next day. leftovers were VERY oily and, frankly, quite gross. i would cut the portion in half and use up all in one day in the future.

This dish was so heavy that I couldn't eat very much of it. I added chicken to break up the cheese flavor a little - but it was still very very heavy. First couple of bites were delicious, though.

Loved it "Delicioso!"... Sauted wild mushrooms with dry white wine, extra virgin olive oil and a dash of roasted garlic and added it all to the souce just before it was done.. Giving it more flavor and body... Also marinated chicken breasts with a mixture of herbs and wine and grilled them over open flame... God just writing it again makes my mouth wet..

I've made this pasta before as it is my husband's favorite sauce, however I've tried it with different cheeses I've trided with brie, gorgonzola, emmental and of course parmessan.It's important to make it with the best quality that you can get.

Most excellent! I sauted some garlic (4 cloves) as well, and put it in at the same time as the pine nuts .... It was very tasty! Next time I make this, I plan to try to thin the sauce a bit, or perhaps take the suggestion of another reviewer and lessen the amount of gorgonzola.

Dish was a hit with the in-laws. Used Feta because local grocery store was out of goat cheese. I enjoyed a dash of dried marjoram on the top, (for color more than anything else).

I have made this several times, and it is always a big hit. It is relatively quick easy to prepare, yet impressive enough for guests. I have experimented with various kinds of cheeses, and some of the best I've tried in this recipe are aged, sharp white cheddar and aged gouda. I usually use less Gorgonzola than the recipe calls for, as it has a tendency to overpower the other cheeses with the amount that's shown. Very rich, very delicious dish!

My family loved it. I think it would be good with some seafood like scallops, shrimp or calamari mixed in too.

There was something awful about this dish. I LOVE cheese, but thought the combination of these specific cheeses was a bad idea. It lacked flavor and needed LOTS of extra salt - very strange considering cheese is already flavorful and that this dish had four different cheeses in it.

I liked it but it was a little bland for me. Everyone else I served it to loved it - the boys, however, picked out all the pine nuts. I think I'd use a sharp cheddar next time as one of the cheeses just to give it a little more bite.

Delicious -- one of our favorite pasta recipes. I've made it with both spinach fettuccine and regular fettuccine and we like both. I've also made it with both pine nuts and chopped pistachios and we like both.

Wonderful recipe! Very simple to make with rewarding results. I used tomato basil fettuccine and it turned out delicious. I've made it several times for company and they loved it.

This dish was good, but very heavy. I thought the sauce could use some salt. If you LOVE cheese, you'll probably like this recipe.

Very yummy dish that's also a great way of using up stale rinds of cheese lurking in your refridgerator. Filling vegetarian fare.

Amazing recipe. Loved by friends and family. I also added parsley for decoration.
