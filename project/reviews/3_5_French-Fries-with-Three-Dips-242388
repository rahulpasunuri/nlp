These are very good and easy to make. I would recommend turning them over after 15 minutes in the oven as written, but then checking on them in 5 minute increments. Mine were a little too dark after the full 30 minutes. I only made the rosemary mayo sauce, but it went so well with the fries. These would be a hit at a cocktail gathering in individual cones\cups, but difficult to finish and keep warm during the party.
