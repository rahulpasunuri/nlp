am going to try it tonight - the boiling comes from cooking ham - to remove the salt used for preservation. no idea if we need to still do that

good basic and quick..saw jacques low review.only a frenchman could confuse cook slowly with cooking in water. no wonder he didnt like it.

This is a simple, but effective way of grilling delicious ham. Excellent flavour.

I do not understand the wording of the recepe.The first sentence "Gash the fat on the edges and COOK SLOWLY" What is it meant by cook slowly? The following sentence : "Grill for about 15 minutes" that is not cook slowly? My question should the ham be cooked slowly in water before grilling? Thank you. Jacques Boisseau
