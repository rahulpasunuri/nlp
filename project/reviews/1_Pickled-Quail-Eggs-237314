These are just bland... I've had many forms of pickled eggs starting with the ones my Mom used to make with the leftover pickled beet juice. In the bars of Chicagoland and Wisconsin, a big jar of pickled eggs (and another jar of pickled sausages) always sits behind the bar. I like to use pickling spice with a little bit of sugar to cut the vinegar bite, and more like 2-4 weeks to get the full pickle flavor.
