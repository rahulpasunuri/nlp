As long as you keep the dressing light (I leave it on the side for everyone to add on their own), this is a deliciously light salad that goes well with a heavy meal. I paired it with homemade tortellini in a cream sauce and it was delightful. As other reviewers suggested I did half water and half balsamic vinegar for a nice kick. I also substituted dates for dried cranberries which worked out very nicely.

Did not change the dressing and it was zingy enough. Just whipped drsg instead of dirtying a blending and it emulsified just fine. I used only 12 oz of spinach and liked it better than using 3/4 pound.

i love the combination of flavors in this. i made it a chopped salad instead, tossing everything together and added kalamata olives, cherry tomatoes & cucumbers. very refreshing!

I LOVE this salad. I didn't change a thing (I think I used a bit more lemon juice in the dressing - but that's it) and it was delicious. And EASY! This will be a mainstay; whenever I have dates I'll be making this salad.

We too thought you need to make more dressing. Needed zing so doubled the lemon juice and reduced the water. Will try adding some balsamic as suggested by one cook. My guys liked it well enough to ask me to repeat it.

Used plain whole milk yogurt instead of mayo, also added some oregano to the dressing. Thought it was very good!

The combination of flavors was really unusual, but very complimentary. I didn't really have enough dressing, which I found a little bland on first taste, but worked well with the salad. Next time I may double the salad dressing.

I was surprised at how bland mine tasted. I wonder why? So many rave reviews, my daughter in law included, yet I found I had to add balsamic vineger for flavor

Wonderful. A real keeper. I cut up segments from half an orange, which works great with the dates. Eager to serve it to quests.

We added sliced almonds to this recipe and also sauteed the red onion with a bit of garlic olive oil and it was fantastic. Almost everyone at the table asked for the recipe.

Wonderful combination of flavors: the salty feta, smoky bacon and sweet onions and dates all work great together in this unique spin on Spinach Salad. Used a bag of baby spinach, which was nice and tender. Season the salad with salt & pepper once tossed and add in some extra crumbled feta. Yum.

I made this salad for Easter, and it was a big hit! The combination of the tangy cheese, sweet dates and sharp onions is delicious.

I really liked this salad! When I made the dressing and tasted it I had my doubts but the combination with the ingredients in the salad it was absoulutely delicious!!!! Keeper.

I found the dressing to be too rich without enough flavor to make it worthwhile. The salad itself--the spinach, dates, bacon, red onion--is a nice mix, so next time I'll just use a recipe for Greek dressing.

The combination was just perfect, quick and easy. I have no complaints but I do cut back on the water a bit to make it slightly thicker. Everyone who has tasted it has asked me for the recipe. It's so nice to be able to print it out from here for my friends.

With the unusual combination of flavors, I was a bit skeptical of the outcome. I was pleasantly surprised. Give it a go when you want something different for your spinach greens other than the standard hot bacon dressing.

Everyone at the party loved it! I did substitue dried cranberries for the dates, as I was out. Waited through the cocktail hour, them microwaved the dressing briefly and poured it on warm-YUM!

I guess it's just me, but I didn't find anything great about this salad... the dressing seemed too tart, and had to be disposed of because no one else liked it either. I had my doubts about how this would work, but it had such great reviews?!? It didn't taste like a synthesis of flavors - just liquid feta and lemon. This site has a recipe called "Black Bean & Bell Pepper Salad", which has a date-based viniagrette. I'll try this comob, minus a few spices. I would then have crumbled feta, red onion, and bacon bits, as part of the salad, and include the dates in the dressing.

Love this salad. It has become a regular in my household. The flavors are wonderful together. A good way to get your spinach intake!

I loved this salad, especially the delicious dressing and combo of dates and bacon w/the spinach. My girlfriend who hates dates even liked it, as did my salad-hating husband!

My husband hates spinach and he liked this recipe. We used freshly picked spinach from our garden and it was wonderful. One change, though. I used half the amount of spinach (6oz)and kept the dressing measurements the same. I think the salad would be too dry otherwise.

As a real "green's" freak - this recipe was enjoyed as a complete meal on its own. Made exactly as per recipe - see no way to improve it.
