Delicious. Modified with materials at hand: 5 roasted poblano peppers, peeled and seeded, 5-6 cloves of roasted garlic. Used lime juice and vinegar. Didn't have pancetta, so used bacon. Topped with a tablespoon of low fat creme Mexicana. Thanks, very nice.

Very yummy! We used bacon instead of pancetta and added a little dried thyme. Kubocha squash is delicious, much taster than butternut imo. And the recipe is simple and tasty.

Very good--I have never cooked anything with kabocha before, but received it in my farm share this fall. Didn't know what it was--until I looked up pictures of squash varieties. Anyway, I made this with bacon and 1 TB of dry rubbed sage, since I didn't have pancetta or fresh sage, and homemade chicken stock. IT was creamy and delicious, not to mention easy. The bacon is a good counterpoint to the sweet flavor of the squash, and the dried sage seemed to work just fine. I imagine that the fried fresh sage leaves would be a lovely garnish, but perhaps not essential to the flavor. I also used sherry vinegar, which I often prefer to red.

I found this soup a little too sweet for my taste. I think perhaps a little sour cream garnish may cut that sweetness. I doubt if I will make this again.

Excellent, simple recipe. I would say that, for me, the pancetta is far from necessary. And may even be a bit too much. I've made it without any meat and you might be surprised how little of the flavor comes from the meat. I've also subbed some thick cut bacon and that works equally well. I dream about this soup sometimes.

This recipe was great inspiration for me, but I decided to substitute what I had on hand so I could make it without a trip to the market. I followed the recipe by adjusting ingredient amounts since my squash was 2 lbs. Instead I used a few thin slices of lean corned beef instead of pancetta. Garlic powder, fresh chopped rosemary (one stem), dried tarragon and thyme (about 1/2 t. ea.) were the substitute seasonings; I skipped the vinegar. And I microwaved the squash whole until soft enough to halve, scooped out the seeds and microwaved cut side down until very soft. The soup turned out great! Very flavorful! I like that it's also low in fat and salt.

I have made this recipe over and over with the same magnificent results. It is really very easy to make and I've even used different types of squash with it (butternut squash is equally as good) and this is especially great for company because it looks like you've slaved over it (and the presentation is so pretty) One of my favs

I loved this soup! My friend and husband also thought it was a really good soup. My husband couldn't believe there was no cream or butter added! I had to use a few different ingredients because I didn't have fresh sage or pancetta on hand. Instead of sage I used dried tarragon and thyme herbs. Instead of pancetta I opted for shredded carrot. For salt, I used Hawaiian red coarse salt to give a little extra flavour. It turned out beautifully! It was my first time using Kabocha and making soup. It had a lovely delicately sweet flavour. I'll definitely use this recipe again!

I was especially disappointed with this dish because I've recently heard such rave reviews about kabocha and couldn't wait to try the squash that is sweeter than butternut. I wonder if my kabocha was too young because it didn't have much flavor - I had to add a lot of amendments but still wasn't satisfied. I have another squash on my counter and will try again - but probably with a different recipe.

I've made this soup several times, and it's absolutely delicious. Rave reviews every time. I don't understand how the soup can be bland because the kabocha has a lot of flavor, and is surprisingly sweet. The saltiness of the pancetta paired really well with the sweetness of the kabocha.

pretty bland, improved in fridge overnight, but, I won't bother again. I do like the Kabocha and will search for other uses.

I haven't made this recipe, but stumbled upon it looking for a soup recipe. Kabocha squash is really a delicious squash. It's more yam-like than other squashes. Really sweet, drier, and more flavorful. I like it better than butternut.

This soup is wonderful with the pancetta and sage leaves... To add a little flair to this soup, make a quick roasted red bell pepper sauce--roast and peel some peppers and puree in blender, add some chile flakes, mayonaise, worcestershire sauce, fresh pepper and other seasonings to your liking. Pour into a squeezeable bottle and decorate the top of the soup with it--it not only gives flair, it tastes wonderful!!!

My family and friends liked this soup--although to be fair, I haven't made it with the kabocha squash, as I haven't been able to find it here. But we've made it with butternut and delicata, and it was great, although subtle, both times.

try blending some pancetta in the final soup

This recipe was just wonderful. I made it for my husband and then for guests - all with rave reviews. I substituted 1 lb of bacon for the pancetta and I think it tastes even better (I also used the crumbled bacon on top of the soup to give it a super crunch). This one is a keeper.

I have to agree with the previous review. The pancetta and fried sage leaves absolutely saved the soup - it's not much on it's own. Without the garnishes (which I would suggest to use in abundance), the soup is blah on it's own.

I was really looking forward to making this soup and I was disappointed. It's lacking something. I wanted to throw in some chipotle or something to give it some character. If anyone else figures out a fix let us know. It was wonderful roasting the kabocha, I still really wished that I had liked this soup, boo hoo.
