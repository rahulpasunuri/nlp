This is a travesty of bibimbap. No gochujang, too much say sauce, no seasoning on the veggies. If you put up a classic western recipe this far off the mark, people would be ranting right and left.

How easy and fun! My husband loved it as did I. I will modify slightly as someone else did and add some Asian hot sauce or use Thai noodles next time instead.

Absolutely one of our favorite recipes. We've made it twice, and my wife has demanded it again for this week! It's great, because she doesn't let me eat meat very often, so this way it's disguised under a mound of vegetables. We do all the veges in a steamer and make the beef/rice separately. We love bibimbap!

I agree with the cooks from Aloha and SF that this is not bibimbap you will find in Korea or Korean restaurants here in America. You can find an easy and authentic recipe here: http://eatingandliving.blogspot.com/2010/01/bibimbap-korean-rice-bowl-with.html.

I gave it 4 forks but this recipe was more of an inspiration for what I ultimately made. For the sauce I used soy sauce, Spicy Sesame oil (lots), siracha(sp?) red chili paste and brown sugar. This sauce has some serious kick but really keeps a nice taste. As for the rest I went with ground pork, rice noodles instead of fried rice, baby corn, green and red peppers for veggies. This is one of my favorite things to make in a large batch and reheat all week.

I love bibimbap, so I was so happy to find a recipe I could make at home. I like to make it meat-less, so I put a little of the marinade in with the veggies (which I saute all at once to make it easier) and then I save a little to pour over the top at the end. Also, my local Korean place serves it in hot stone bowls so the rice gets turns a little crisp on the edges. So I put my oven-safe bowls in the oven at 300 while I'm cooking it. Then, I serve every thing in the hot bowls at the end.

I am Korean, and this is not Bibimbap!

This was my first time eating bibimbap, so I'm not sure how this recipe compares with what you might find in Korea. We did, however, certainly enjoy this dish. I used ground turkey and scrambled the egg instead of frying. For veggies, I added steamed green cabbage, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, peas and cherry tomatoes, cut in half. I forgot to make the rice (arggh!) so I served it over noodles instead. Excellent when paired with Epicurious' Korean Style Romaine.

Definitely not an authentic Korean bibimbap recipe. No soy sauce, vegetables should be seasoned (i.e. with sesame oil and garlic), baby corn is not a staple in the korean diet, and the requisite spoonful of hot chili sauce (gochujang) wasn't suggested. As Koreans say, "aigu, aigu, aigu..."

I agree with a cook. The Bibimbob I got in Korea was done with ginger garlic and a pool of fire in the middle. Yhis is a dish that is very adaptable to anyone. use ingredients on hand left- overs whatever. Just use the concept. and for the adventurous try it with a pocket of chili-garlic sauce

In traditional Korean Bibimbab, there is no soy sauce used in this dish. Instead put a teaspoon of chili paste (or more, depeding on how spicy you want it) and drizzle sesame oil. You serve it like this, then the person eating it will mix their own bowl with utensils. Delicious!

agreed on the saltiness, definitely opt for a smaller amount of soy sauce. but very tasty :)

This was good - strongly reccommend low sodium soy sauce or using half the soy, it was very very salty.

This is not Korean Bibimbap. The vegetables are flavored with soy sauce, garlic, ginger, etc. And where is the hot sauce?
