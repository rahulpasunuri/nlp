Make this frequently for company when turnips come up in my garden. II think the herb crust is special and would not substitute anything else. It's easy, especially if you make the crust the night before.

This worked perfectly for me. I never use shortening in my crusts, but this might have converted me. I had some left over from my pot pie and just stuck it on a baking sheet - we ate it with soft cheese while waiting for the pot pie to finish. Also I used dried herbs, in roughly the same amounts listed here, and it was fine. Delicious. The result might be dry if you don't add enough water? I think you'd have to know what to look for when it describes the 'large lumps'. All in all though...this got raves, and I'd gladly make it again any time. The fork tip in particular. I'd only ever started and finished a crust in a food processor, but from now on I'm using a fork to add the water.

I didn't think was very good. Too dry.

This sounds delicious, but I'm allergic to wheat. Has anyone tried this with rice, soy, or spelt flour? Curious if it yields similar results...

Very good recipe. It freezes well, so I make a double batch, chilling half for immediate use and freezing half for another day when I'm too busy to make the pastry. Defrost overnight in fridge when you're ready to make a second pie.

My friend Sip and I made this one drunken evening and it turned out wonderful. The crust was so good we picked most of that off and ate it with Chardonnay. Simple peasant food is hard to screw up even when wasted.

This recipe was absolutely "DELISH". I agree people need to learn better english!!!

This nothing that you can't do with the usual pie crust and just add herbs. In addition Vegetable shortening is Trans-fat so if the butter doesn't get you with saturated fat, the vegetable shortening with trans fat.

Like other reviewers, I made this with the pot pie. Just wanted to add my full endorsement!

This was a great crust! I used dried herbs since it was all I had on hand and it was still delicious. Used it with the chicken pot pie.

Used it on recommendation of the fall veggie chicken pot pie and I thought it was great! I had no choice but to use dried herbs since I couldn't get ahold of fresh. But it was tasty all the same. Will use again!

DELICIOUS-- but, like any pastry crust, it is time consuming. I'd make this on the day before serving, to give more leeway in terms of time. Make sure to use this crust with the appropriate recipe (the fall vegetable pot pie). Don't cheat and use a store bought crust-- the herbs really add to the final product, and make a wonderful "anchor" for all those veggies.
