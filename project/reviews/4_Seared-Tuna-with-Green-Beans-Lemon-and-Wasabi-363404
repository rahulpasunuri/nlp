I cooked this as an appetizer for a dinner party. I prepped the everything and set it all aside to chill. When I knew everyone was almost here I combined the chilled beans and sauce and cut the chilled tuna steaks. It was a hit everyone loved it! I will definitely be making this again! Easy to prep, great for parties, great balance in flavors

I am not a huge fan of Wasabi so I took a chance and made this anyway. This dish was a hit, I seared the tuna and boiled the vert ahead of time and chilled them. I made the wasabi sauce but waited to coat the beans till my guests had almost arrived. I plated this as a starter with the tuna fanned out on top of the beans and it was amazing. Everyone loved it.

This was perfect for a weeknight dinner. It took about 15 minutes from start to finish and was gorgeous. I served it over mixed greens. Roasted red potatoes would be nice -- like a deconstructed, Japanese-influenced nicoise. The flavors went together perfectly!

This could be the easiest and healthiest recipe for entertaining or home meals made in a snap! It has zippy flavors with the combination of lemon juice/zest and wasabi and can be made into a light meal or a side dish. The only suggestion I would make is to boil the beans for only 2 minutes (or less) to add a more crisp bean salad and maintaining the nutrients. Everything else was PERFECT and so, so easy. I don't generally give such perfect marks, but this one had it all and saved a lot of time preparing a meal :~)
