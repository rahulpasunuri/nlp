This never did thicken. I made it the night before and in the morning scraped off ALOT of fat. Next time, I'll cut down on the meat, increase the Coke and make soup.

If you marinade the pork in the braising liquid for at least one hour in the fridge beforehand, it will turn this already delicious recipe to an even more flavorful one.

The pork has to be seasoned prior to searing. The salt in the soy sauce is not enough. That's why the flavor was off, according to other reviewers. Otherwise, no changes and hubby and I loved it. No leftovers! Oh, I bought the bone in by accident, and put one bone in the stew during braising. That added more flavor also.

I love this recipe- really simple and turns out great every time. May be too garlicky for some, though.

Cola is truly magical. It worked its magic and made the pork super tender. Boyfriend absolutely loved this dish. I trimmed off all the fat on the pork so there was very little oil in the braising sauce. The sauce was so delicious to pour over rice. I like the lean pork, but still think it would taste even better if I left all the fat on it. Just it wouldnt be as healthy. The meat tasted even better the next day after it sat in the braising sauce overnight.

Doubled the recipe. As written, the flavor left me wanting. I should have known--how much flavor can you expect from only garlic, ginger, and a bit of soy sauce in a stew? Ten minutes was not enough to reduce the sauce (admittedly I had twice as much). If I'd had time to reduce it longer it may have concentrated the flavor. Anyway, it's a good base for experimentation, and hopefully it'll improve after a day in the fridge.

My husband, my 9 yo son and I all loved it. Based on other reviews, I used less Coke than called for (only one 12 oz can for 1.7 lbs of meat) but at the end added a couple of spoonfuls of orange juice as it seemed to need more liquid. I doubled the green onions (put a full bunch in the stew, used the other for garnish). I bought sushi for lunch and used the leftover pickled ginger in lieu of fresh.

Husband thought this was great. When I told him I thought it was good, but one-dimensional in flavor, he said he liked that particular dimension. I'm not sure what I thought it needed (besides extra thickening at the end) -- maybe I was expecting more of a hoisin flavor, so I might add a spoon of that. Or maybe some orange juice or zest? I'd consider flouring then browning the meat, which might thicken the sauce better in the end -- I used a buerre manie to achieve that instead of cornstarch.

Excellent. The flavors and aroma bring me back to the time I lived in Yokohama. Very authentic.

i liked this dish. i'm sure there are better recipes but this one is good and doesn't have a lot of ingredients. good way to get rid of extra soda and the dish doesn't even taste like soda. try marinading steaks with coke, makes them tender too.

I really like this dish. It is easy to prepare, though it takes a while to cook. It makes for a delicious simple meal served on jasmine rice and a cucumber salad.

Easy to make, but not much flavor.

This was just OK--not great. I added the red pepper flakes which gave it some spice. It was actually better the second day. There are better pork stew recipes out there.

I would actually rate this 3 and a half forks if that were an option due to ease of preparation and taste. I served this over brown rice alongside a japanese theme salad with homemade ginger dressing [Benihana]. Delicious and Convenient!

Very good and tender.

My husband loved this. I thought it was ok. The pork was so tender. Next time I will use stewing meat, it was a pain to go through the ribs & trim the fat. I did add lots of red pepper flakes at the beginning, but it still was not spicy enough for me. At the end I put in about 2T of Buffalo Chipotle Sauce & some chopped cilantro. Served it w/white rice & sugar snap peas.

My family loved this...especially my very picky husband. He suggested that I try this with beef next time. I think that would be terrific too! We tend to like foods with very strong, full flavors and this really fit the bill.

Our family loved the taste of this dish. The pork came out very tender and had a good flavor. I agree with other reviewers that some red pepper flakes and a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce would be a good addition.

This dish was okay, but nothing special, so I probably won't make it again. I doubled the garlic and added chopped fresh jalapenos, but overall, we didn't think it was that great. Howver, it was very easy to make, and would be a good work-week dish for those who enjoy this dish. Maybe our tastbuds were just having an off night as the reason I made it was the great reviews it got.

I doubled this recipe, used just a regular yellow onion and powdered ginger (these are what I had on hand) and it was delicious. I also added red pepper flakes for kick. I would definintely do this stew again and look forward to "playing" with it next time.

Very good. It reminds me of a Hawaiian Braised Pork recipe that is on this site. I will also be adding red pepper flakes next time to give it a little kick.

Very nice weeknight meal, but it definitely turns out very sweet and asian tasting. I thickened the sauce with some cornstarch, but followed the rest of the recipe to the letter. Everyone liked it.

very easy and tasty. My kids loved it (all I had to do was tell them I was cooking with soda and they liked it right away)

My Dad found this recipe in the Feb. issue and recommended it to me. It turned out pretty well (very kid friendly). Next time I think I'll add a little more garlic and/or ginger, and possibly spice it up with a little pepper flake. With a little tweaking this will become a family fave.
