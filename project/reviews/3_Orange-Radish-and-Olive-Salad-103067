I thought this was a 4 fork recipe, but Mr wasn't so sure about a sweet/savory fruit salad as a side. I doubled or tripled the spices to make them detectable, but that's not too far afield for recipes - I like a little perceptible heat and realize that not everyone does.

i added sunflower seeds and extra radish. the sunflower seeds make it a 2.5 fork salad. i should perhaps add more pepper, i couldn't taste the spice.

This was really good and easy to make. I made sure to have some sweet oranges for the salad. I did sub orange juice for the lemon juice in the dressing. For the presentation I used a thin layer of Rocket greens on the bottom of the serving platter before starting to layer the oranges. It was a beautiful and colorful presentation and very yummy. I received compliments on the salad and the yummy dressing. Great dish!

I liked this, and more than my husband did. It was an interesting combination of flavors (I really liked the cinammon in the dressing). It went very well with the ragu--a nice contrast.

Served this salad with a meal of poached salmon. Everyone raved about the unique taste of the salad. I doubled the amount of cayenne pepper.

I made this salad with one substitution. Since I was already using olives in my potato gratin, I made this salad with orange segments, sliced red radishs, and sliced fennel. Used the dressing as recommended. Fantastic. A wonderfully bright taste using ingredients available all year round. Went splendidly with the gaminess of our lamb.

Very refreshing. Went well with a very hearty dinner (beef brisket in horseradish sauce.)
