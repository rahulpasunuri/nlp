I am an experienced and, at least people tell me, extremely good baker. I think this recipe needs some tweaks. What's great about it: the pistachio brittle, the frosting, and the pairing of these flavors with lemon curd. (I used a different lemon curd recipe that I love, but it's not too different from this one.) What's not great about it: The cake layers themselves. They should be very airy with all those egg whites, and seemed so on day one, but after sitting overnight assembled in the fridge, I think it compressed, and became dense. Perhaps the variable reviews on airiness/tenderness have to do with whether one assembles it a day in advance or just a few hours in advance. It's also a kind of precarious cake, as the filling is only curd, with no stiffer/stickier component to stabilize it. So it's a little scary on the transport front if you're taking it to some special occasion recipient. I also think clearing out space in the fridge for a big cake with a dome on it is pretty annoying for the home cook who is presumably doing a special occasion meal, and therefore has lots of other stuff to keep in the fridge. I'll make it again with a different cake recipe, though--the frosting, curd, and brittle combo rock, and fully made up for the lackluster cake part.

This cake is so good. I have to confess that while I did make it from scratch per this recipe before now I take much easier steps. I use a store bought white cake mix. But follow the rest of the recipe to a T. The pistachios are so good and I put them inbetween the layers of lemon curd. Sometimes I frost it with a lemon frosting too.

I made this cake over the course of two days as a celebration to myself and family for finishing grad school/ and dealing with me through grad school. It was spectacular! I am not a big cake maker, it was a challenge and I wasn't able to make my layers as symmetrical or level as a pro would- which I recommend not using silicone cake pans because they distort the cake shape too easily when the shape matters for stacking purposes! But every individual item of this cake was delicious and then put together and eaten in one bite, it was like an awesome overload. Given the work, I'd probably not make the whole 3 layer cake again, but variations using the individual components I'd for sure bake again & again!

This is an outstanding cake. Flavor and texture of the cake, lemon curd, frosting and crunch are perfectly balanced. The only thing I deviate from in the recipe is adding baking soda to the pistachio crunch. I don't put in any. Save this cake for very special events--it's worth the time and effort.

Excellent cake. I made it twice; the first time over 2 days and the second time I did it in one afternoon. The first time i made it the cake part was very dense like many reviewers have said. But as i knew it was possible for the cake to be light, given the few reviews that said it came out light, I googled how to properly fold egg whites into cake batter. It made all the difference and the second cake was amazingly light. The link to the video i found is below. You have to forward to minute 1:38 where they show you how to properly fold in the eggwhites. It's a good skill that is usefull in many recipes.

Definitely a big hit with the family. Made this for mother's day and they were raving about it (and were suggesting I begin selling it). It was a bit time-consuming, but not necessarily difficult. I spread out the tasks over a day and a half, so I never felt like it was too much to do. I kind of blended this recipe with the pistachio cake recipe on this site to make it a bit more interesting. Added orange zest instead of lemon zest to the cake batter and added a teaspoon or so of ground cardamom to the frosting. I would actually add even more (but we're Indian and really enjoy our cardamom)

This cake just does not work at high altitudes even with the standard adjustments for the altitude. I ended up making the cake with a box mix from Whole Foods. It turned out delicious. The lemon curd is the perfect tart treat and the crunch is phenomenal.

Rating: 4
One of the best cakes I have ever made or eaten. I agree with the previous reviewer, who said that this cake is for exceptional bakers. The cake part was not dry, as other reviewers had stated. In fact it was quite most. I would not reccomend substituting a boxed cake mix, no matter how high the quality. The ingredient proportions in the boxed mix will undoubtedly be different than those in this recipe, thus yielding a cake with a different flavor and texture, which this recipe was not designed to be paired with.

I have made this every year for my own birthday for 5 years now. I is my favorite cake to make for other parties as well. The only change I make is to use a high quality whte cake mix from my local organic foods store and a a little lemon extract and a little zest. That way "m sure the cake part will be just right in this high altitude. Don't skip the crunch.It is the best part.

Spectacular! My mom made this for my 40th birthday, and it was wonderful. Not easy though, this cake is for experienced bakers. The brittle is worth making all on its own. The frosting goes stale in just a few days, so plan to eat it up right away.

Rating: 3
Took time but the cake was good. The crunch defiantly made it. It only got three forks because the frosting was disappointing..really white choc and whipping cream. I'm not a fan of white choc in the first place but I was hoping that by having a custard like base it might not be so icky

The concept of the cake was good, but it was difficult to prepare and I messed up a few steps (frosting turned out curdy, cake was dry and caramel on the pistachio crunch was a little over cooked). I thought about retrying but given the very high calorie content of this cake and the ingredients involved-- 8 eggs, 2.5 cups cream, several sticks of butter--I will likely not repeat.

I've had this recipe in a binder for a few years, but never felt up to the task when planning a big dinner. This year I decided to tackle it for Easter dinner. Our 17 guests raved about it for weeks afterward! Like several others, I made it in stages over three days - still labor- intensive, but well worth it. So beautiful and delicious! The part I found most difficult was how quickly the pistachio brittle set; it made separating it a chore. However, several people commented that the brittle made the cake, with just the right finishing touch.

This cake was magical. While the recipe calls for an electric mixer, we thought our standing mixer was much more up to the task, especially when adding the flour and milk (a hand-held mixer might over emulsify). Also, we made the frosting and the lemon curd as per the recipe, but decided to be a bit more sparing with both....Oh, and we baked it for much less than the called for 30 minutes. We checked on the cakes around the 22 minute mark, and found them to be done! Very, very pretty and lovely to eat!

I apologise for the incomplete review (this is why i'm not fork-rating it)- i just made the pistachio crunch to decorate a lemon cheesecake- and it is FABULOUS! strangely so, almost- so few ingredients, and yet so....well, fabulous :-)

This cake does take some advance planning, but it was excellent. I loved the pistachio crunch. I couldn't find unsalted pistachios, so I shelled them myself and rinsed off the salt. Then, I retoasted them in the oven. They were fine. The only drawback to this recipe (and it's not really a drawback) is that the cake doesn't seem to keep very well for leftovers. Once it was cut and sat out at room temperature for a short time, the frosting started to lost its stability. I put it back in the refrigerator, and it looks fine, but I think the leftovers will not be as attractive or "crunchy" as the fresh cake. That's OK - I'll eat it anyway; I'm sure it will still be pretty delicious! :-)

a good cake overall. i wish the cake part was dense and dry. would probably make again with another cake recipe.

Loved the cake! It was so delicious. The pistachio brittle was the best so I wouldn't skip out on that step. Make sure you use non-salted pistachios. I didn't realized mine were salted and it seized the sugar mixture. When I made it a second time with the correct pistachios it turned out great. Also make sure the cake pans are well buttered and flour. The cake has a tendency to stick to the pans. This is a very labour intensive cake but well worth the work for that special someone.

This is a ton of work, but doable if you do it in stages. I did the lemon curd and frosting base on a Wednesday, made the brittle and baked the cake on a Thursday, and assembled and ate on a Friday for my mom's 60th birthday. Everyone raved. It was just amazing. Definitely worth the effort.

Rating: 3
I got a lot of compliments on this cake. I did not do the pistachio crunch however, I thought that might be overkill. The lemon curd was delicous and so was the white chocolate cream frosting. And both were very easy to make. I will definitely keep in my repertoire.

In case you're wondering if this cake must be made in 2-3 days, as I was, I'm here to tell you that you can do it start-to-finish in a day as long as you are creative and not intimidated by the steps. It is worth the work--while I thought it was too sweet (but then I like making cakes, not eating them), I had two separate strangers ask if the cake was made by a professional or if I am a professional baker. That felt great! A note about the pistachio brittle: use raw (unsalted, unroasted) pistachios. This recipe sets *really* fast, so you may want to find a recipe with corn syrup. It was my least favorite part of the cake, though it was great by itself--too heavy and sweet in contrast to the delicate cake, though it made the cake look fabo.

do you use raw or roasted pistachios with this recipe? thanks.

Yes, this cake is rather labor-intensive, but worth it. The cake itself was very moist and light. I suspect that those who found it dense and dry either over-beat the egg whites, over-folded, or both. Not a cake for the novice baker, but very good nonetheless.

Rating: 4
I found this cake to be extremely moist--in fact, I liked it better the next day. I usually make a slightly less sweet curd, which I think is an improvement on this cake. I also found the cake to be just as formal and attention-grabbing without the pistachio crunch, though some decorating should take place if one were to take this route.

Response to the one with discolored curd. If you use a metal pan, make sure it isn't aluminum. It should be a non-reactionary pan like stainless steel or glass to avoid discoloring.

Rating: 1
After reading the great reviews I have to say that I was very disappointed in this cake. I found it to be too dry and heavy. Beautiful to look at, but that is about it.

Rating: 4
In response to the discoloration of the curd: often the dye from a stamp on a lemon or even the sticker on the lemon can get on your fingers, and this small amount can discolor the whole mixture and may not show up until the curd is cool. Or it could just be your lemons.

Made this cake 2 weeks ago, very intrigued with all the flavors. First off I wanted 2 make 2 layers not 3 so I cut the cake recipe in half. Am not sure if that was such a good idea since it did not seem like there was quite enough cake for 2 pans, and they just did not seem to rise all that much. I also thought they were a bit spongey...maybe I overbeated the batter? Any syggestions? The curd was sensational, but I made it in a metal saucepan, and after I stored it, it's color was not lemon yellow but more like yellow green...Could there have been a reaction between the metal and citrus?Frosting was wonderful, and the crunch I made was slightly overcooked so I felt it was too burnt. It cooks fast! Watch it! Needless to say it won rave reviews, & would definitely make it again but use the whole recipe.

This is the best cake I've ever made. I had 2 friends and a sister-in-law also tell me that this is the best cake that they have ever eaten - EVER! When taken in steps, this is also a very easy recipe to make. I made it in 3 days and was amazed at how easy it was and what a wonderful cake it is to look at and eat!

Rating: 4
This cake is great! Sure, it's a lot of steps, but you can spread it out over a couple of days and none of them are very time consuming. Make it exactly as is and you won't have any problems -- my layers were absolutely perfect. And anyone complaining about too much icing is crazy -- you slice off the top of layers -- sounds like a chef's treat to me!

This cake was wonderful. It was actually pretty easy stretched over two days. I substituted lime curd for the lemon because I liked the idea of the green curd inside w/ the green nuts outside. I don't understand why some people had trouble w/ the cake - w/ both beaten egg whites and baking powder mine was light but with a nice tight crumb.

I am just now making this cake for the fourth time. Each time I have made it, everyone says it is the best cake they have ever had. Quite a recommendation.

The lemon curd is the best-tasting component of this recipe. There are many parts to the cake, but everything is quick: the lemon curd and brittle took all of 15 minutes. And your dinner guests' reactions will be well worth the effort.

You need time to make this cake. Like 2 days in advance. The first for frosting and curd, Second for cake (morning) and assembly (later) and a third for eating.

I recently made this cake for a small second wedding, and at the guests began singing, "Amazing Cake," to the tune of, "Amazing Grace!" It was a big hit!!

Rating: 3
I liked the cake although it was a dense sponge. I was generous with the lemon curd and piped more frosting as rosettes on each slice, accompanied by a quarter slice of lemon and sprinkled some leftover pistachio crunch in the center of cake. I've made the pistachio brittle about a dozen times since b/c everyone raved over it!!!

Rating: 3
A comment for some of the reviewers: if you change the recipe or substitute ingredients, don't expect the same results or criticize the recipe. Whole eggs don't give the same light results that egg whites alone do, and I've never found a purchased lemon curd with fresh lemon taste. The end product is only as good as the ingredients and the diligence of the cook.

What a hit for Mother's Day brunch! I especially loved the flavor of the white chocolate base in the frosting, not your usual frosting recipe. Jarred curd cannot beat making your own with fresh juice and zest. I don't know what others did different, but my cake seemed very light in texture, the frosting came out perfect, and the crunch stuck with no problem to the already chilled frosting. I made extra crunch to make sure I had enough, and made fresh candied lemon peel to decorate on top. This recipe is more labor intensive, but if you want a plan ahead type of recipe this works well.

This is a wonderful cake...my company loved it, everyone had seconds! I saved the leftover crunch for a month in an airtight container. This cut down the prep time for my next cake to under 45 mins. I am looking forward to serving the second cake tommorrow.

I purchased lemon curd and revised the cake to only have 4 eggs- white and yolk. The frosting could be cut in half, and I had trouble with the pistachios adhering.

Too much work - the cake was very dense. Frosting was very tasty - as well as the pistachio crunch.

Too much work, I was tempted too to use a mix and store bought curd. Half the frosting would have been loads. We really liked the pistachio crunch.

I also made this cake for Easter and thought the cake itself was more heavy and dense than I would have liked. But loved the pistachio crunch and the frosting. A fun project, but probably won't do it again.

I also made this cake for Easter but due to time constraints, I doctored a white boxed cake mix. It was good - no one knew. The lemon curd was good, but not better than premade "Dickinson Family" that comes in a jar. I tasted the pistachio crunch and decided not to use it on the cake because although it was chopped up it was too "glassy" in texture. Also, I was afraid that I would not have enough to decorate the perimeter of the cake. Ended up using coconut instead.

I made this cake for Easter dessert and found it to be quite labor intensive for the end result. While everyone liked the lemon curd and the frosting, we thought the cake was disappointing. It was quite dense and much too heavy for the lemon curd and light frosting. If I was to make this again, I would doctor a white box cake and not spend the time making the three round cakes from scratch.
