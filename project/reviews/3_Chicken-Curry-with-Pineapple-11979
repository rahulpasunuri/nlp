i make a lot of curry dishes, something missing here. we tasted after it was finished, kinda bland. so we tried adding more cayenne, then spices, finally coconut milk...nothing working for it here.

I liked this recipe although I thought the carrots remained a bit too crunchy. I would add them when cooking the onions to soften them a bit more. I also added 3 cloves of garlic.

My son loves this recipe and I try and remember to make it often - yesterday, I started making it and realized I'd forgotten to buy tomatoes - I sub'd with tomato paste, and it was still lovely, and in the last half hour, I add a cup of pre- soaked Basmati - a pilaf!

I made this for my son who loves curry. I used canned pineapple in natural juice and took the advice of adding a bit of the juice to the sauce. I cooked the chicken until it was very tender and the sauce was thickened. I also chopped the carrots in the food processor. We loved it and will definitely make it again and again.

A great recipe. Wasn't sweet enough for me though at first while cooking, so I ended up adding pineapple juice too. Even better.

Good recipe - I substituted chicken breasts and curry powder. Served it over jasmine rice. Would be a good dinner party dish to make ahead and keep warm.

This is one of my favourite recipes on this site. I have made it several times over the last few years and have also served it for company...they loved it too. One change...I recommend using fresh ginger rather than ground.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe. For me, there was a little bit too much pineapple. But otherwise, it was tasty, relatively easy and pretty healthy/low fat. It's my first time cooking curry, and I was pleased.

Did not like this recipe at all. Too watery and sort of bland. Maybe if you add yogurt like other reviewers suggest, it would have a better texture & flavor. But overall I would rate this a poor recipe.

The Chicken Curry with Dried apricots recipe on this site is much better. This was good enough to use up some extra tomatoes and pineapple - fresh of course. I would also suggest using fresh ginger and a tsp. of hot curry paste.

We loved this dish. I did use Garam Masala, actually in place of the cumin since I didn't have cumin at the time. Also, I used fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of whole ones, also because that's what I had in the house. There are more tomatoes by weight in a can of diced tomatoes; I think this plus the fire roasting added some extra depth of flavor. I did use a can of diced pineapple, drained, as one of the other reviewers mentioned.

As suggested below, I added garam masala. I was going to ad yogurt, but it was a last minute thing, and all the store had was heavy cream so I used that. It's sinfully delicious. Next time I'll use yogurt...

I used canned pineapple instead of fresh, drained, worked well. I loved the flavors in this dish, but I am a big fan of both pineapple and curry that was no surprise. Even my picky boyfriend loved it! This may become a new mainstay around my kitchen.

I added some nutmeg, crushed red peppers, and cloves to the garlic. Wonderful! A Hint, if you store East-Indian food in plastic, the plastic will become discoloured. Use glass.

Not bad, but didn't taste much like a curry. Above all, it lacked bite. If I make it again, I'll add some garam masala, and possibly some yogurt to thicken it up.

I did not like to much. Thoughtthe spices were too much.

I made this for Sunday dinner and both my wife and father in law stated "very good". My wife has already asked me to make this dish again.

Very nice combination of fresh pineapple and curry. I did use the garam masala and it was quite good. I also used boneliess sknless chicken thighs cutup.

it might make it more tasty if you use garam masala
