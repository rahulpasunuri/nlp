Aside from the water being adjusted as always for each particular houses climate I found the recipe to be very easy and delicious! I actually wanted it for a 10 inch Pyrex deep dish pie dish, so I had to roll it a bit thinner than I would have normally and had not one scrap left over....darn! This will be my new all purpose pie crust recipe!

I noticed that under the "flaky" crust variety 1/2 t of cider vinegar is used so I added that to this recipe. I thought it best to leave it as moist and lightly worked so I made by hand. This was the best crust I have ever made. I thought it had a gentle buttery flavour and was like a thin flaky shortbread in the lemon meringue pie. I have been cheating with the pie crust from Trader Joe's, but now I'll just make this one.

This crust was easy and turned out well, but honestly I just wasn't very impressed with the taste - it seemed kind of bland, nothing really special. I usually use my grandmother's pie crust recipe, but I had to find a butter recipe this time since I was out of shortening. The results aren't bad, but pie crusts can taste SO much better than this! Also, if you use this recipe it needs more salt than is called for.

Finally I can make a pie crust that tastes good. I was always disgusted by a under-cooked center of the pie crust when I made apple pie. I pre cooked this crust about 15 mins before adding filling. The crust is falky and delicious. So easy to make I will not be buying premade crust anymore.

Had I not accidentally used salted butter to make the crust, the taste would have been truly exceptional. As it was, though, there was a slight bitter aftertaste, for which I do not blame the recipe, but my own mistake. If you want a great crust, make this one, just use unsalted butter.

oh yeah... and definately 4 forks. I make sure to bake the scraps with the pie (I usually put it all on a big cookie sheet) and take them out early to keep my hungry husband happy.

FANTASTIC AND EASY!! I love this recipe. I used to wuss out and buy a frozen crust since I can handle making something with shortening (even though I know Pilsbury does). I made this as the top crust for an apple pie (b/c I had the bottom already). It was so good. It can go with anything (sweet or salty). I won't ever buy a crust again. Definately increases my love of the food processor. Does anyone know if you can freeze these disks????

This has become my default pie crust. It is perfect for tarts, quiche, fruit pies, hot pot pies, and any recipe that requires crust.

best pie crust I've ever made. No shortening=no trans fats and none of that nasty metalic-crisco-esque coating in your mouth after eating. Flaky, tender, rich and perfect.

I cut 40% of the butter into the coarse meal to the size of peas. As you roll out the dough you can see the butter. That made the crust very flaky. Very good recipe!

Very easy crust to make. The dough was an ease to work with. The scraps were yummy too!!

My kids look forward to my chicken pot pie because of this crust. Love that there is no shortening! Have tried also with half whole wheat flour - gives a great nutty flavor.

This is a wonderful crust, not difficult at all, even without a food processor. So much better than store-bought--absolutely worth the effort. I love to snack on the trimmed overhang when making a pie. Yum!!

Um, obviously I did something waaay wrong. This 'amazing, easy' pie crust is baking into a coagulated mess in my oven right now. It slid right down the sides of the pie plate. Luckily, I started my Christmas Cheer earlier today or I'd be pretty mad.

I've used this recipe twice now. Once with half shortening as suggested by a previous reviewer and once with all butter. Both Times I received many compliments on the crust. It has flavor and doesn't taste "lardy".

A dream to roll out, pick up, and adjust once in the pie pan. I don't have a food processor, but my two bare hands mixed everything up perfectly. I also used raw sugar, who different color and consistency presented no problem.

This recipe is a dream. It rolls out wonderfully, and is extremely easy is pick up. May never use another pie crust recipe again.

This recipe is pretty much the same as the one I have used for about 15 years. As with most skills, making good pie crusts takes practice. If I want it flakier, I use half shortining and half butter (in the same overall amount called for in the recipe). Have faith, you will learn and improve as you go!

To The cook from Philadelphia: Any suggestions for a better recipe? Since some thought that this was a very good one, I would be interested in trying one of the ones that you referred to. Thanks!

I used this crust, briefly prebaked, for our Thanksgiving pumpkin pies. There are many better crust recipes out there.

This crust turned out perfectly! I have made my own pie crusts from scratch since I was a teenager (am now approaching SS age!!) and this is one of the best pie crust recipes ever! It rolled out beautifully without any rips, etc.
