This dish was easy and tasted great. The cucumber relish added the perfect touch. Great for a hot summer day.

This relish is delightful with steak! I substi- tuted yogurt cheese for the plain yogurt and I increased the garlic a bit. It gave a clean, cool, summer kick to our grilled steaks! It should be fantastic with grilled salmon as well!
