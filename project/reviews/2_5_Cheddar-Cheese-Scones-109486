Oh...and I did sour skim milk because I had some lying around. I keep sour milk around for baking because there's no use wasting it. It turned out fine in place of the whole milk they call for.

I thought these turned out great, but only because I changed a few things. 1. Butter instead of oil 2. Added a tsp of salt 3. Doubled the cheese I also find they're good if you put hashbrown potatoes in them, use dill instead of chives, or make really any change. It makes a pretty good fluffy base (as long as you add butter and salt), and then do whatever flavor your like. The key is to flavor this scone your way instead of theirs.

These were not yummy at all!! They had an overwhelming dry/flour-ly taste to them, which prevented us from tasting any other the other delicious ingredients. If you want a good Cheddar Cheese Scone recipe, I would suggest the one featured in the Mangia cookbook...it is delicious!!

Will make again in a fashion! Definitely not the cheddar scone I was looking for - needs the incorporation of butter for richness and flavor. So will likely modify the other recipe for cheese scones on this site (Cheese & Pesto)to include the 1 cup of cheddar,chives and sesame seeds. Hopefully salted butter or unsalted with a pinch of salt will remedy some of the lack of flavor. Unfortunately I bought self-rising flour just for this one, so will likely still try to incorporate it's use-but expect to get some lift from the butter particles!! The appearance of these was lovely(so gave it two fork rating)and a yes for again as I think some of the basic ideas are worth keeping!

Very bland. Wish I'd read the reviews before I started this recipe. Then I'd have known that the recipe needs more salt. As my husband said of the recipe, "It's not a keeper."

Rather bland, not cheesy enough for us.

Made mini-scones and used spring onions instead of chives. Also, omitted the dijon...didn't miss it one bit.

The scones came out really well. Thanks for the tip about the salt--I added some, and it made a difference. Since I didn't have any whole milk, I used skimmed, but it didn't seem to make any difference. Adding the chives is a great idea!

zzzzzz - a pretty boring scone. I would definetley add salt if you're going to make these. Also, not sure what the significance of "self-rising" flour is. I just used all-purpose and it was fine (of course the scones in the pic look much fluffier than mine - perhaps it's the flour) Oh well. I found nothing special about these scones.

Had to make a couple substitutions because I was out of sesame seeds and chives, so added chervil and sprinkled poppy seeds on top. Yummy! This one's a keeper, although next time I will add a pinch of salt to the dough.

Great for tea-time, but they are also great forluncheons or dinner. They are also a great brunch addition. Make alot of them because they go fast and the cook usually misses out!

Fun to make with a grandchild, but I was not crazy about them.
