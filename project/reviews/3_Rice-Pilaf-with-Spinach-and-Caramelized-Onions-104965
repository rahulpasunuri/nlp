An unusual flavor, but quite tasty. A good variation - not for every week, but definitely in the menu rotation. Husband, who usually likes his rice plain, ate it up.

Terrible, doesn't even deserve a single fork.

Made this as a vegetarian weeknight dinner and it was delicious, as well as being easy to prepare. Next time I won't bother reserving some of the onions as a garnish, as it didn't really add anything except another small bowl to wash up. Might tinker with the spices in future, although the cumin was very tasty.

I thought this was delicious. It was also colorful. I used two carrots instead of one, and two very large sweet Vidalia onions. They caramelized beautifully and provided wonderful flavor. I do think it takes longer to caramelize than the recipe says, but be patient and don't put the heat too high to speed up the process. You will just end up with burnt onions. I did use the arborio rice and chicken broth. It came out creamy and tasty. Don't forget to season with salt and pepper. I served this with Chicken Cordon Bleu and sauteed zucchini.

I made this recipe for our Shabbat dinner and loved it. My husband is a true rice lover and thought the flavor and consistancy was great. I took the others advice and added half of a red, orange and yellow pepper roasted and finely chopped up and cilantro. I also sauteted the dry rice in vegetable mix before adding it to my rice cooker with the broth. I mixed in the spinach after the rice cooker was done. Turned out great.

I agree with the reviewer who suggested adding lemon, basil and parsley...defiantly gives it more flavor. I made it with brown rice, which also made it more flavorful and added some red bell peppers and mushrooms...basically a great meal for cleaning out the fridge of whatever veggies you have on hand!

I thought this was a great alternative to boring rice. Made with fish and asparagus it was a delicious and healthy weeknight meal. Very creamy and rich. The onions were the perfect ingrediant! Will make again.

Mushy, bland, blah!

I agree that you can definately jazz up the flavor up in this recipe. The broth is a little overpowering--I suggest to cut it down by 1/3 and use plain water instead. Extra onions, fresh chopped parsley and basil give this dish a fresher flavor. Extra black ground pepper, and 1/4 a cup of lemon/lime juice give extra flavor. Excellent with shrimp to!

I make this recipe with a blend of white, brown and wild rice, and everybody loves it. Also, I believe the secret is to use very good cumin.

I agree with the reviewers who found this dish bland. The caramelized onion flavor did not come out at all. Perhaps some diced jalapeno would help with the flavor. Wild mushrooms might also help (but not with the jalapeno!)

I served this as a side dish to stuffed grape leaves (with minced lamb) with tomato sauce. Very delicious combination. Make sure that you don't cook the spinach too long as it tends to get a bit slimy; 2 minutes is the absolute maximum, I believe 1 minute is more than enough. Apart from that a good recipe.

As far as being bland, there are definite additions that can be made to suit your taste! I defintely added more garlic, and even more spinach (frozen works well too). I enjoyed it a great deal!

This dish was only OK. It was a little bland but looked great due to the nice colour. The only reason I'd make it again is because it's so easy. I agree that it's more like risotto than a pilaf.

This dish was a wee bit too heavy and bland. I cut back on the onions and substituted a red and a yellow bell pepper for the carrot. Mine too turned out very risotto-ish. It was, however, very well received.

We all thought this was a very good side dish. I used Basmati rice, vegetable broth and doubled the garlic and halfed the onions. Nice flavor and very easy to make. Would certainly make this again

Great recipe. However, I added raisins and pine nuts to the dish...contributed to extra flavor and texture. Next time I make this, I might also try adding whole cardamom seeds (not pods). But overall, a great dish. Especially liked the addition of spinach and grated carrots gave the recipe lots of color.

I have mixed feelings about this dish. It's definitely heavy and needs something to give it some kick. Maybe some saffron or even crushed red pepper. I had to add extra salt as the flavor of the cumin and the spinach just disappeared. My family liked it. Even my 10 year-old niece ate it. However, I wouldn't waste baby leaf spinach on this dish.

The rice dish was too heavy, and I did not like the over-use of onions as the base for this recipe. It was too much.

This is a great dish. We made it for a large group of people and everyone loved it. Mine turned out almost like a risotto. Will definately make it again.

Delicious! I added raisins for a little sweetness. Even my 2 year old ate this! I could absolutely make it again! Yummy! PS. Onions carmelize by being sauteed in low heat for a long period of time. No sugar is needed..

Good and very easy.

Easy but very boring. There was little or no flavour. I would suggest the addition of saffron or some other flvouring. The cumin just disappeared.

Excellent sidedish to lamb chops or any mediterranean-style dish. I omitted the carrot, used half wine, half broth, and added a lot more garlic and a teaspoon of ground coriander with the cumin. Really good and different.

I believe that when you are caramelizing onions, it is the sugar in the onions themselves that causes the process of caramelization. That is why you should not use onions like the Vidalia that (while sweet) are overly watery.

I was about to make this recipe for the first time, but the first thing that I notice here is that there is nothing in this recipe that would caramelize onions, there is nothing sweet, not even butter. Please check if there is an omission of sugar. Otherwise shouldn't these just be called sauteed onions? Thanks.
