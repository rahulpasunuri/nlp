I've baked this 3 times with the last two in a convection oven. Don't do it! I think it dries it out even when I take it out when center still moist. Cooled cake hard to handle without breaking. Having said this, it is an absolutely quick cake to make and wonderfully delicious and different.

Haven't tried this yet. However, for those who are wondering why the use of margarine instead of butter. The reason is so that it can be served for Passover feast. I will be using butter and will let you know how it turns out.

Huh? Margarine? Who makes chocolate torte with margarine and how come everyone is gushing about it? Haven't the Glaxer girls heard of butter?

I had this dessert at my 3rd seder, and I'm going on record to make it for my family's seder in 2013. It's divine -- as good as anything you would get at a top-tier resto.

Divine!! Substituted raspberries, which made for a gorgeous presentation. Did bake for the full 42 minutes, which proved to be exactly right. Perfect texture, perfect flavor!

Incredible desert, but very, very rich. Extremely elegant and always impressive- super easy to plate. Serve with a glass of crisp champagne. Ultimate decadence.

The first time I made this recipe I overbaked it. Dry, but wonderful flavor. The second time, I put it in a water bath at 350 for 1+ hours (until tester comes out moist, but not runny) and it was perfect. The Blackberry Coulis is wonderful, but a 1/2 recipe is sufficient. This recipe actually serves 16 to 20. It is very rich, but worth every calorie. Rave comments every time I serve it.

This is a go to recipe for me for Passover but it is good enough to make year round. Chocolate lovers go nuts over it. I use regular chocolate chips and margarine instead of butter to keep it dairy free and it is still amazing!

Embarrassingly easy to make and very delicious, but I prefer the equally easy "Flourless Expresso Cake" also on this site. The Blackberry Coulis is excellent and has many uses.

This is mega-awesome! The blackberry coulis makes a HUGE amount of coulis - way more than you can ever use for the cake. It is nice as a sauce over vanilla ice cream though. I recommend making half. I used mixed frozen berries (strawberries,raspberries and blackberries) and it came out great. For the cake I used an 8 and a half inch springform pan, baked it for 44 minutes and used canola oil spray instead of melted butter. Worked fine. Thiss cake will wow everyone.

I have made this recipe several times and always get compliments on it. Sometimes I made a raspberry coulis rather than using blackberries. Either way, this torte is a winner.

Reading the other reviews, I was sure that this would be a winner. It wasn't. I followed the recipe for the cake only substituting high quality chocolate instead of the semisweet chocolate chips. (I thought that should be an improvement.) When it came out of the oven, it initially looked great. It had risen and the top was 'dry and cracked' but once it cooled, I found it to be dry and crumbly. It was over cooked. (I confess that I did not check the torte earlier, as the recipe specifies it needs to be baked for "42 minutes", rather than "40 minutes or until....") I ended up cutting a good inch off around the edge of the cake to try to save it. The taste was definitely chocolately, but not exiting at all. I think I would have preferred to eat the chocolate bars that I purchased to make this. Maybe it would be better with regular chocolate chips. However, I will not make try this recipe again, even with regular chocolate chips.

This is a really fantastic recipe, if somewhat time consuming to make. I made the mistake of peeling the crusty top off when I pulled it out of the oven, not thinking about the fact that it would be on the bottom once the tort was turned out of it's pan and become the crust of the tort. I skipped the blackberry coulis and just served very thin slices with candied mint leaves and spiked whipped cream.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe! I used %54 semi-sweet chocolate and reduced the raspberry coulis to a thicker stage. I have made this 3X and will be featuring it in an Italian Wine Tasting menu. Goes great with a Selmer Syrah or Stefano Accordini Recioto 2004.

Cakes are my specialty and this is my new favorite cake. It is SO easy to make and it is spectacular. I used high quality bittersweet chocolate rather than chocolate chips. I doubled the recipe. I didn't use parchment paper and didn't have a problem with the cakes sticking. The blackberry couli is a nice touch but not needed to make this a really special dessert.

Rating: 4
This recipe makes a very good chocolate dessert. It's thick and almost fudge-like, not light and cakey. With the berries and mint on top, it looks beautiful. In addition, as our 15-year-old cook said, it's not all that hard, because you don't have to beat the egg whites separately. Rather than store-bought chocolate chips, I used a 60% bittersweet chocolate chopped up fine (first by hand, then in the Cuisinart). The only problem I had was that the top didn't crack, so I left the cake in the oven after the 30 minutes suggested by other cooks, and I think it was a bit dry as a result--it would have been softer if it were more underdone. However, there was plenty of glaze to counterbalance, and I served ice cream as well as the blackberry coulis on the side. BTW, I used 4T in the glaze rather than half that, the amount called for in the recipe. I had to futz with the sauce. After straining, it seemed very thin, so I cooked it down. This would have been plenty, even for my group of 13. (But fearing it wouldn't be, I added another 10 oz bag of berries, strained.) Also, I didn't have Riesling, so I used bianco white vermouth--next time I'd make a special trip out to buy the Riesling. All in all, though, a forgiving and very good-looking cake.

I left out the espresso powder and instead added some nutmeg and cinnamon to the chocolate. It was very rich and decadent but also exquisite! I made it for passover and it was a hit!

I would have rated this recipes higher, as I like the results I get with my attempt at appropriate proportions: but why can't each portion of chocolate be measured in ounces? 1 and 2/3 cup of chips is relatively subjective. I *did* figure out, thanks to the topping recipe that 1 cup = 6 ounces (rather the normal 8) in chocolate chip volume. But this little clue is held in the latter part of the recipe! It's a good thing that I have the patience (thought baking is not my forte), to read through and decipher. When Bon Appetit has a recipe like this, they should do as the Europeans do, and stick to the weighted measure. So much easier and more accurate!

Very good. The blackberry coulis - excellent.

Rating: 4
Holy cow was this good! I used butter instead of margarine, and served with blackberries and mint sprigs scattered on the top and around it on the platter, so it looked really pretty. The amount of coulis was far more than needed--I'd agree you could halve that recipe. This got rave reviews--probably the best Passover dessert I've made.

Rating: 4
Wonderful cake, got raves from everyone who tried it. It makes 16 servings, and even at that people shared because it is so rich. The Coulis is about double the amount you really need for this dessert, so it can be halved. I used a course strainer and some of the seeds went into the sauce, which worked very well. Also, the coulis mixes very well with coffee, had lots of folks ladling it into their coffee! It is a 2 hour project from start to finish however, a very labor intensive recipe. Next time I would make 2 cakes, and freeze one. However, I have paid $8.00 a slice for chocolate torte that does not compare to this one. Use organic sugar, use organic eggs, makes a huge difference in this recipe.

Excellent. I made it 3 days ahead and refrigerated. To get that glossy shine back to the chocolate glaze, I briefly put it under the broiler (30 seconds on a low rack). It gave us 16 slices which were perfect portions. Love the coulis!

Pretty darn awesome but can't have more than a little bit or you'll die and go to chocolate heaven! Dense and rich doesn't begin to describe this! The sauce is a must serve as well. Letting it cool COMPLETELY is really necessary as it comes out so moist as to be hard to handle.

I followed this recipe exactly to the word -- I made the cake only --it was dense and rich but the end result was almost bitter -- 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa was probably way too much-- my husband liked it -- but it really lacked something -- needed vanilla at a minimum...vanilla ice cream improved it alot, but I wouldn't make it again.

Very easy, and pretty good, but it didn't have the melt-in-your-mouth truffle-like consistancy I was hoping for. Kind of like a big brownie. Next time I guess I'd try real butter?

YUMMY!!! Delicious and fun to make. It is truly for chocolate lovers, but the Blackberry Coulis is good on vailla ice cream for those who are not chocolate fanatics. Everyone loved it.

This is a great recipe!! Always comes out perfect. I add 2 tbl brandy to Coulis; I have used huckleberrys and blueberrys (use less sugar). I substitute butter for Margerine and begin checking torte at 30 minutes cooking time. I like the idea of a thicker Coulis and will experiment with this approach. It's the kind of desert that you can play with! More expresso anyone?

Now most of you know by looking at my user name that i am young...heck i am only 14 going on 15. i made this recipe in a sitch...it was soooo easy. The only thing was i could not find frozen blackberrys so i used red rasberrys instead...they worked just as well...the only difference is the coulis is red instead of black. Anyway my family and friends loved this torte. One of my friends' dad said i should even become a pastry chef...he obviously didnt know that is my dream. So i am not gonna tell you my whole life story but if any of you are just starting out on the whole baking scene this recipe is quick and easy even though it looks like u have to be some famous chef to make it. Take it from me and remember to follow your dreams no matter how silly they are...like mine! haha

I have always found these reviews very helpful but this time even more so than usual. I have been waiting to make this cake -- it looks magnificent -- but have had no luck in finding the frozen blackberries. Others have had good results with raspberries & mixed berries so I will give it a try. Meanwhile does anyone know where to locate the frozen blackberries?

The torte was super-chocolatey and delicious. I substituted bittersweet chocolate for semisweet and added 4tbsp of the coulis to the glaze instead of only 2. I think it could've used more, the blackberry flavor was very subtle. I served this with fresh blackberries and vanilla ice cream. The torte is very rich--a small piece is really enough.

Ahh...after writing my review yesterday I just figured out that the "spiked blackberry coulis" line is actually a LINK to the recipe! Dumb, dumb me. I thought that it was a header indicating that blackberries and mint were all that were needed to make the coulis. Oh well. That explains not only the "spiked" issue I wrote about but also why there was very little blackberry flavor in the topping. Still, it was a superbly awesome treat!

This dessert was absolutely fantastic! Very decadent yet rather easy to make. I am a bit confused about the title of the recipe tho - "DARK Choc Torte w/ SPIKED Blackberry Coulis" - unless I am looking at a different version of the recipe than everyone else, I can't find the "dark" chocolate (it asks for semi sweet) and can't figure out what the coulis is supposed to be "spiked" with. Speaking of the coulis - the recipe doesn't say anything about how to make it - is this something I should know without directions? The recipe calls for blackberries in the ingredients but then simply says to add 2Tsp of coulis into the glaze. I didn't know what else to do but use liquid/juice squeezed out of the some of the berries. Regardless, this torte was so delicious that I will make it a regular part of my entertaining.

Decadent and delicious. Also, easy to make, and looks great when you serve it with mint leaves and berries scattered around. I would reduce the coulis by cooking it uncovered next time to make it more syrupy. Nice dessert for company.

I made this for Mother's Day and it was terrific. I'm a little embarrassed however since many of the other reviewers used the word 'easy' to describe the process and it took me something like 6 hours to make the thing. In fact I collapsed from exhaustion at about 8:30 that evening, but was able to stay awake long enough to enjoy this. My wife is still laughing.

WOW! I mean really, WOW! This cake was dense and chocolatey and just fabulous. It reminded me a little of a flourless torte.

This cake was amazing! I made it exactly as written in the recipe, but next time I would not make the blackberry coulis--I would simply make the ganache without the fruit, much eaiser and basically the same flavor. This cake did not taste like Passover, at all--it will be in my bag of tricks for any fancy dinner!

We really loved this. The coulis has come in handy for a number of other things as well. My suggestion is to cut the cooking time a tad and watch the cake carefully. Mine could have been cooked 5-10 minutes less.

This was delicious! Instead of making one cake, I made 6 individual cakes (about 2.5 inches in diameter). I baked them for about 18 minutes and they came out just as the cake was supposed to: dry and flakey top, moist, collapsed center. Next time I will make smaller ones because the cake is so rich! I used Callebaut 55% semisweet chocolate and everyone raved about the quality and taste of the chocolate. I also used butter instead of margarine for the cake and made a caramel sauce (used the recipe from Bon Appetit Oct. R.S.V.P) instead of the blackberry coulis. To go along with the cake, I made white chocolate vanilla gelato (using Callebaut White chocolate). My guests raved about the combination of the smooth, white-chocolate gelato over the rich, chocolate cakes. Definitely a dessert I will make again!
