I love dark chocolate, so I thought that these would be sweet enough for me. They weren't, even though I substituted 1/2 semisweet and 1/2 dark chocolate for the bittersweet. In addition to the confectioner's sugar, I ended up dusting them with granulated sugar, too. I may bake the second half of the dough rolled in sugar first.

I share the opinion of many others here. This isn't a sweet cookie (no sugar in recipe) and I would have liked it to be. So, next time, I'll add about 1/4 cup of sugar and think I'll like it better. That said, everyone else who has tried this liked it. I think it would accompany ice cream nicely.

This cookie had a really funny taste and they fell apart transferring to the cooling rack.

After making these for a party, I was asked by a number of individuals for the recipe. Delicious.

These were okay, though somehow not what I was expecting. Their texture was neither chewy nor crumbly and shortbread-like. They were more like tiny cakes. I'm tempted to try them without the baking powder and see what happens. I had no problem with the sweetness, just the blah texture. Also, the rum taste totally disappeared after cooking. (The raw dough was outstanding, though!)

Didn't have rum, so I used kahlua. Didn't have hazelnuts, so I used almonds. Yummy and easy.

This is going to become a holiday favorite. Richly flavored, and quite sweet enough for me; powdered sugar over the top would be overkill. Note, these cookies don't spread out much, so you can fit quite a few to a pan.

I usually like desserts that aren't very sweet, but these were not good at all by themselves. They would be good served along with something else, perhaps ice cream.

My family really enjoyed these cookies, and they were easy. I will definitely make them again.

This recipe is much better when the hazelnuts are finely ground. My Christmas favourite!

These cookies are excellent. Contrary to other reviewers, I really appreciate a cookie recipie where sugar isn't the dominating taste. I love the bittersweet chocolate's subtle bite in these cookies. These will probably go unappreciated by the general American population because of their less sugary nature. If you want a cookie taste and texture that is hard to find, make these.

No one in my family has a strong sweet tooth except me. Since they're only mildly sweet, these cookies were a hit with my whole family. I sprinkle powdered sugar on the ones I eat to help tame my sweet tooth.

The concept is good but the cookies just aren't sweet enough. There is no sugar in the dough, except for what is in the chocloate. They tasted ok, but I would have enjoyed a sweeter cookie.

These wern't sweet enough. The texture was kind of like a brownie. I think I'd use sweet chocolate the next time.
