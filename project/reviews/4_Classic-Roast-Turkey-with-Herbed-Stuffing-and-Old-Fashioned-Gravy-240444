I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and my daughter has requested it again for Christmas. We were amazed how easy it was and the turkey was so moist. I guess we will do turkey for Christmas instead of tenderloin.

When we cut into the bird my husband asked me what was wrong with the turkey, Was it done? it seemed too moist. No, it was actually moist! Everyone raved about the turkey. I made the stuffing as well both the plain version and sage & sausage version. Both were very good. Watch the celery salt with the sage and sausage version - mine was too salty for my taste.

This was the first time I've ever made a turkey, let alone a Thanksgiving feast, and it turned out wonderfully, especially considering I was the sole person in the kitchen! Followed this recipe exactly, with the one exception of melting some butter and mixing into it some sage and rosemary and rubbing it between the skin and breast meat... Really sticking my hand in there, kind of gross, but I heard this makes the skin really yummy and crispy, and keeps the breast moist, and yup, it was a yummy turkey!! My boyfriend raved that the gravy was the best he'd ever had (thanks to the turkey neck floating around in the roasting pan :P but he doesnt know that...) Good one on the foil covering the breast, it browned so quickly once I took the foil off!

I haven't made this, but I'm am totally surprised that no one gives the tip to roast the bird UPSIDE DOWN, which is the easiest, most fool-proof way to guarantee moist breast meat. We don't eat white meat in this house, so I end up using the leftovers for enchiladas or whatever I conjure up. Start roasting your bird upside down so the juices run to the white meat.

This year was the first time I've made Thanksgiving dinner for my family. I followed this recipe exactly and my first time making a turkey was a success! Easy to make and delicious to eat.

After years of following the Cook's magazine recipe (400 degrees and lots of turning the bird) we decided to try a less exhausting method, and this recipe was great! Our bird was at 180 degrees in the thigh area by 3rd hour, so upped the temperature to 375 to quickly heat up and brown the breast. My stuffing was all cooked prior to putting in the bird and had no eggs or other raw ingredients, and heated up to 160 within 1/2 an hour at 375, along with a beautifully browned breast. I did push some extra turkey fat from the tail under the breast skin, which helped with the basting, and flavored the butter with poultry seasoning and extra sage when first buttering up the bird. YUMMY

i've tried many different turkey recipes over the years, but this was the best. the meat was perfectly moist and flavorful. i think the slow cooking concept is they key. easy to fancy-up if you want -- i added some truffle oil to the butter and it added a nice, subtle flavor.

First turkey EVER, I mean EVER, and it was delish!! I did a butter rub under and on the skin and roasted the bird following the directions, and it was perfect! Gravy was also soo good. I mean, wow. Wow.

The old Bacon Family trick to perfect turkey is, well, bacon. I layer bacon over the surface of the bird (just do the best you can, gravity is obviously a limitation here) to prevent premature browning of the breast, legs, and wings. The fat and flavor soak into the skin of the bird and down into the pan drippings. In the last 45 minutes of cooking, I remove the bacon and let the bird brown up to perfection. If you like bacon (and very few people don't), you must try this method. This recipe is spot on for a great turkey dinner.

Wow, turkey came out fantastic! I agree with the recipe author, this is the best method I've ever used to cook a turkey. I didn't follow the directions for the gravy, only the turkey, and I brined the turkey, so did not use any additional salt. The turkey was frozen and had sat in my deep freezer for at least a year (gasp!) and still it came out moist and delicious. This will be my number one way of making turkey from now on. Next time, I'll try the gravy too.

The BEST fool-proof method for moist turkey!

I've used this recipe twice now for Thanksgiving dinner, including my first holiday dinner hosting, and in both instances the turkey came out juicy and flavorful. I decided the second time to use an overnight brine instead of flavoring the turkey as directed in the recipe, and it came out beautifully. The only issue I have had is with cooking time; for some reason, I needed to leave the bird in the oven an additional 30-45 minutes to reach optimal temp, and to get that nice brown color on the breast. It's very important to remember to take the aluminum foil off the breast at least 45 min to an hour before removing it from the oven. I thought a brine would make it cook more quickly, but that wasn't the case. I used fresh organic turkeys without added saline solution; maybe that affects the cooking time? Not sure. Regardless, this is a very nice recipe for a delicious, classic roast turkey.

This turned out moist on the inside and crispy (but not too crispy) on the outside. I have had turkeys turn out too dry in the past, but this one was excellent. I followed the recipe closely except that I loosened up the skin and rubbed butter mixed with fresh rosemary, salt and pepper underneath it. I followed the time suggested for a 25 lb. turkey and it was perfect. Thank you again, epicurious!!

I hosted my first Thanksgiving this year, and was particularly nervous about the turkey. Thanks to this recipe (and a pre-brined turkey) everything came out great. I passed the family test with flying colors.

Wonderful! I made Thanksgiving dinner for the first time this year and this turkey turned out great. It looked nice and tased better. I actually impressed my grandma which is not easy in the kitchen. The turkey was so moist and juicy it started to fall off the bone before we carved it.

This is the recipe I followed for my 1st Thanksgiving Turkey & it was a hit!!! My eldest sister usually cooks the bird, but I hosted this year. She follows my grandmother's technique for her turkey & is suspicious of any other. BUT, she told me she wanted to try my approach (aka, this recipe's approach) next year b/c it was SO tender! Thank you Epicurious for making me look good!

An excellent turkey - no muss, no fuss.

This turkey turned out wonderful. I was a bit nervous because it took a long time to cook, but the skin browned nicely and held in the flavor and it was by far the most juicy turkey I have eaten. I did choose a fresh turkey for the recipe.

This was the first time I have ever roasted a turkey, so I followed the recipe to a tee. My 7.7 lb bird came out moist, perfectly cooked, and complimented the gravy. The bag of organs was missing in my turkey (and believe me, I LOOKED!), so I added chunky pieces of carrot and celery to the bottom of my roasting pan to add flavor to my boxed chicken stock. The drippings turned out beautifully and made for excellent gravy.

No need to turn over the turkey-I have great success without turning it.

From Rick Rodgers: Not a review, but a comment, which is only fair as the other comments aren't reviews on the tested recipe, either. I have tried the "turn the turkey over" method a few times. The skin often sticks to the rack and tears when you make the turn. If you use a nonstick rack, and the skin doesn't tear, then the skin at the drumstick/thigh joint tears, instead. And, it is not easy to turn over a hot, greasy, heavy bird. Anyone who tries this method does so at their own risk. I did it alot when I was a newbie cook, and my turkeys looked beat up from the tears, and one ended up on the floor. Especially if you are a novice turkey roaster, please try the much simpler "foil over the breast" method.

All of Mom's classic tips, except --- I second San Diego's comment --- cooking the bird breast-side down for at least the first half of cooking. Then carefully turn over and allow breast to brown.

Haven't tried it yet but it sounds good with one exception - the key to keeping breast moist is to invert the turkey so it cooks on the breast. Gravity forces the juices down keeping the breast moist!
