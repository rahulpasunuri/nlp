Fantastic! I couldn't find the mushrooms at my grocer but I would have liked to add them. Wonderful flavors and complexity. I don't eat pork, so I substituted for smoked turkey legs and turkey smoked sausages and was pleased. However, I will only use one turkey leg, or use more beans, next time- a little too much meat: bean ratio. I definitely recommend using this recipe to anyone!

I found this recipe and my husband made it with a leftover honeybaked ham bone instead of hocks. We used just 1 lb. kielbasa and it was delicious. I thought mushrooms were a little odd when I first read the recipe but they were a wonderful texture. You really do need the 4 cups of water. My husband loved it, and I was very pleased also.

Great basic recipe for a great American dish. I used canned red beans (3-16oz drained and rinsed to remove the salt,) used more button mushrooms and no porcini Used red wine and less beef broth. Also used turkey sausage on my third try along with smoked turkey legs intead of ham hocks. All three batches were consumed quickly during football season by hungry guys.

Since we are not mushroom lovers, I omitted them. I substituted turkey sausage for the ham hocks and kielbasa. I used the 2 cups of white wine for some of the water and chicken broth instead of beef. It was great!

I have a similar recipe handed down in our family. I use bulk sausage (browned & drained) instead of Kielbasa. I just use fresh button mushrooms. Add more garlic, 1 Tbs. Worchestshire, 1 tsp. Accent (MSG) and use 2 cups white wine for some of the water called for. Depending on how meaty the hocks are (or hambone is), I sometimes add more smoked ham pieces. There must be a hundred ways to fix red beans and rice, but this one satisfies everyone! Love it served with a spicy cornbread (add green chilies and corn to the mix).
