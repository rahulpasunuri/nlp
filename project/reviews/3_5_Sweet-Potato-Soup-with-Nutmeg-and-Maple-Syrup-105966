I saved this recipe a few years ago and never made it. I stumbled upon it again this past November and thought it was a perfect soup to make for Thanksgiving. It was delicious! I decided to make it again for my family in Canada on Boxing Day (the day after Christmas) and it was a hit. What a great winter soup!

As usual, I forgot to add the last minute ingredients (maple syrup and cream.) It was still really good even without these ingredients.

This is a fantastic soup. I have made it for Christmas on more than one occassion. Everyone loved it! I highly recommend this recipe.

I am no fan of sweet potatoes. However, the recipe made as written is a real winner. I made it for Thanksgiving and family were begging for leftovers.

I was missing a few ingredients and it was still great soup. I used celery salt instead of the celery, no onion - just the leeks, powdered cinnamon instead of the stick, and I added a dash of cayenne pepper as suggested by another. I also used one can of coconut milk instead of the half and half. We served it up and totally forgot about the syrup - and it was still a really yummy soup. I'll make it over and over - perhaps with all the ingredients next time.

Just o.k., won't make again as have made other sweet potato soups that I like better.

Great soup! I used half 2% fat lactose free milk and half heavy cream instead of half and half. My lactose intolerant husband ate it with no problems!

Excellent soup and perfect for a cold winter night. I used real maple syrup and will make again for company as well as family.

I've made a variation of this soup every year around the holidays since the recipe was published and my friends and family would have a fit if I didn't... tips for making it more flavorful are to roast the sweet potatoes instead of boiling. I then use a ricer to add to the rest of the soup. I also always use homemade turkey or chicken stock. A little chili pepper in the background is worth a try too to help bring out the sweetness and add depth.

Delicious! I'm sure you could use a range of milk-half and half-cream, depending on your concern about fat content, and it would still taste great.

This is okay, but I've made better sweet potato soup. I made it a day before serving, to allow time for the flavor to develop. I started with only a cup of half-and-half, tasted the soup and decided not to put in the rest because the taste was thin. It never did get very flavorful. The soup isn't awful, but like I said, there are better recipes out there.

I agree with the cook who said if you don't want sweet don't make this soup. I felt as though I had to add too much salt to cut through the sweetness and ended up serving it with a blue cheese garnish which helped. The texture, however, is lovely and it is indeed a very filling soup. I will stick with my tried and true creamy leek soup with bacon- hey maybe bacon would help out this soup!

This was delicious-a perfect soup for fall. I think you could add any proportion of milk to half and half, and it would still be creamy and good.

I never have leeks or cream around when i want to make this soup and its still fantastic. It is always a crowd pleaser.

My husband loved this. It went together quickly, and I just put it in the fridge until dinner time, then warmed it up.

Really yummy!! I told my kids it was "Candy Soup" and let them sprinkle a little cinnamon sugar on top and they gobbled it up. I subbed some of the half-and-half with 2% milk and it was still good. This soup also freezes well; we had some from the freezer yesterday and it was as delicious as the first time.

Oh. So. Yummy. Have made it as written: perfectly wonderful. Also have made it without leeks and celery: still absolutely wonderful. I always leave the skins on the taters, and I always double it!

I made this as a starter for Valentine's Day and my wife loved it. I thought it was wonderful, very easy and has a nice velvety texture. We're already planning on making it for a dinner party.

Yum! So easy and delicious, perfect for chilly weather. I added a splash of wine while sauteeing onions, that worked well. Will definitely make again soon.

An excellent soup for a holiday party. I've made it several times and each time someone has asked for this recipe. Tastes sweet, but not overly & spices are a great compliment to the potato. Guests won't be disappointed.

Since the first Thanksgiving I tried this recipe, my family demands that I make it every year. Great aroma and taste.

I thought this soup was delicious! I made it for a dinner party and added a dollop of sour cream along with the celery leaf garnish. I'm only giving it 3 forks though because of the 1 1/2 cups half and half. Along with the butter it makes this recipie too fattening! I'm going to try it again replacing the half and half with 3/4 cup lowfat sour cream and replacing the butter with canola oil and see what happens. Also, a little salt and pepper when served is a nice contrast to the sweetness. I'm definitely going to try this one again

extremely easy to make and very, very delicious. if you don't like sweet things then don't make this soup. i think we used gold sweet potatos instead of red. would definitely make this soup again.....and again.....

I made this soup for a church "Soup-er Sunday" luncheon and everyone went nuts! It was very well recieved.

I burnt the onions which lead to the soup being darker than it should have been, but it is good. I added a little bit more of everything to make more of it and it still worked. I used crazy jane instead of salt and pepper.

This was delicious and beautiful! I served it in white porcelain crocks, and put a pinch of cinnamon on top of each serving. One thing I did different, was add a little vermouth to the soup, near the end of the cooking. It cut the sweetness a bit and gave it a wonderful gourmet edge. Great recipe!

Delicious! I had a bowl of sweet potato soup at Emerils in Las Vegas, and this is every bit as good.

A very pleasing result! The texture is velvety (I did thin it down, though), its aroma inviting, and its flavour delicate and round. A wonderful warmer for cold weather.

I replaced part of the half n half with milk and the soup was still too heavy for my tastes. It was also a bit too sweet. More like a dessert soup. If you have sweet potatoes on hand, I'd recommend the roasted root vegetable recipe on this site before this one. Or make a nice sweet potato pie.

This was one of the best soups I have had. You can easily have it for a main course with a salad. I am making it for x-mas and it will be one of my favorite recipes. KM

Delicious and easy. I did not have leeks, so I used green onions, did not have half-n-half, so I used 1/2 cup heavy cream, did not have cinnamon stick, so I used 1 tsp cinnamon. Took a while to "salt to taste", but once I got there, this was superb.

This soup is hearty and filling, yet with delicate flavors. AND it doesn't take too long to make!

My new favorite soup! The flavors would be excellent as a starter for Thanksgiving or Xmas. I decreased the half-and-half by a quarter cup and omitted the celery. It was outstanding, and really easy. I pureed it in the food processor and that worked well. Expect people to inhale it!

I served this at our last dinner party and it was huge success--even my husband and sister-in-law who do not like sweet potatos loved it. It is a keeper!

h my! This was soooooo good. I am submitting this review several weeks after making it and I still remember how good it was. Smooth, velvety. I do remember that I had to "play" with the seasoning at the end (a pinch of salt, etc.) but this soup was a big hit at my dinner party.

This was a hit at our house! I used mexican cinnamon and the indicated amount of maple syrup and the flavors were perfect! Highly recommend this one!

Rating: 4
Thought it was wonderful. So did everyone else. As to previous rating I did use mexican cinnamon stick which may not be as strong as the standard store bought. You may want to adjust if using the later. Maple syrup was fine. I was glad it did not overpower the soup, so that the soup could tast like soup! Luscious and complex!

I was disappointed with this recipe it sounded so good. Too much cinnamon and the maple flavor did not come through at all. If I made it again I would use half a cinnamon stick and alittle more maple syrup. Very filling.
