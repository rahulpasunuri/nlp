This was super fast and easy, but very tasty. I agree that the cauliflower can be reduced a bit.

This recipe is good as written, great with a few easy tweaks. We used raw spinach and cauliflower steamed just a bit. It made a crunchy, light flavorful salad that was great for a buffet.

A very pretty and tasty combination. Since the spinach shrinks so much, use the whole 10oz. bag not just the 6oz. that they recommend. Also, maybe I measured generously, but 6 cups of cauliflower seemed like a lot. I will use less next time.
