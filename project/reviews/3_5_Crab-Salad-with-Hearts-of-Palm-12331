Great recipe, must use less mayo to bring out more of the crab.

I was convinced to try this by the last reviewer who mentioned that this is a good basic recipe, and can be adjusted to taste. I agree! I would caution using less mayo. I served this with endive spears and it was a huge hit!

OK, so there are no surprises here. This is a basic crab salad. But here's the beauty: this recipe lends itself to fiddling around. You can pretty much do every ingredient to taste. I put in tons more horseradish and lemon juice, and I also added some hot sauce. I also chopped up the cucumber and put it in the dressing. I hate green peppers, so out they came. Since others talked about the dressing being excessive, I made it separately and added it to the crab....and then I used it all anyway. I felt like being indulgent! So good!

This salad was attractive and easily put together, but after all the ingredients went into it, it basically tasted like crab and hearts of palm salad with thousand island dressing. not bad, but i will keep looking for a more unique recipe.

Should be a staple for crab lovers. Stores well. The hearts of palm got lost in the mix, though; next time will leave in larger chunks.

Delicately flavored, this salad is wonderful as a wrap filling. I made it as suggested with a little less mayonnaise. I used canned lump crabmeat, as that's what I had on hand. A wonderful, light dish!

Excellent salad, with some variations... have made it several times and people always ask for the recipe. I frequently use half crab, half shrimp. I agree there is too much sauce, so I add bow tie pasta and don't use the pita. I then chop the cucumber and add it to the salad. It's a favorite!

Used a little less mayo. May use a little more hot sauce next time. Great Recipe! Served on arugula salad.

This was delicious but I chopped up cooked shrimp to replace teh crab. Agree with another reviewer that there was so much sauce. I will cut down on the mayo next time. Super easy, super good!

Maybe I did something wrong but this salad was not a great success- too much mayo which disguises the taste of the crab.

I brought this dish to a pre-opera cocktail party. Everyone loved it.

take away the bell peppers and hearts of palm. Dip a ritz cracker in it and Yum! you have a dip!
