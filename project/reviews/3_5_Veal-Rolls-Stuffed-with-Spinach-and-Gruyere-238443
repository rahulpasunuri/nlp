Excellent flavor, made w/ chicken cutlets, filling included crushed garlic and 1/4 cup chopped sun dried tomato for color and taste, and 1tsp whole grain mustard. Pan sauce started w/chopped garlic, more sun dried toms & mustard w/ half broth & wine and 2-3 T of heavy cream! quick, beautiful and delicious.

Yuch...what was I thinking...anchovy paste with veal does not go, 10 for dinner and...yuch!

Good...Very pretty...added garlic to the butter..definitely use half the butter and more like a tea spoon of mushed or paste anchovy..unless you really really like the anchovy taste....and i do ;-) We used 1/2 and it was very pronounced. Served it with Onion and Potato with cream and anchovy o gratin.

As mentionned, a recipe worth making again. Used a "grotto" aged Gruyere, and top quality veal....all worth it. Did as others suggested, diminished the amount of butter, and added garlic. End result,great. Must insist, good quality cheese a must, makes the finale exceptional. Bon Appetit.

Very good and fairly easy recipe. I actually used Eggplant Caponata spread instead of anchovy paste- and everyone loved it. Made some veal and chicken. I tripled the amount of wine for the sauce as well.

Relatively quick and delicious. My only changes were 1) used a lot less butter (just added some to sauce at end), and 2) added stock to the wine before reducing and adding the single tablespoon of butter used. Will make again.

An easy to prepare, solid recipe. I thought it was missing something...maybe herbs, definitely a little garlic. Overall, very good.

This has great flavour. 3 oz of Gruyere is expensive? This is a veal roll. Don't wimp on the gruyere it is as it should be

This is a good recipe and quite simple to make. The sauce was not that great and there wasn't much of it. Too much butter and not enough wine.

This dish turned out very well. Gruyere is a bit expensive for me, so I used swiss and it turned out fine. I would highly recommend this dish! It has a wonderful presentation.
