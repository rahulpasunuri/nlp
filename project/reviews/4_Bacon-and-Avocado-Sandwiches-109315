Sometimes I get a little sassy feeling when reviewers completely change the recipe and then review it nonetheless... but... here goes! I've recently started growing my own sprouts in my kitchen because of their miraculous health benefits. So I was looking for a way to eat all these radish sprouts, as I've got them coming out my ears! So I made 'this recipe' as a salad with soy sausage patties from Trader Joes instead of bacon. It's super delicious and very nutritious. I love it and will eat it again and again!!! ps. I added a little tomato too!

Wow, this was really tasty! We made it as a brunch and I have been full all day since! I made it exactly as described, used a couple extra pieces of bacon and avocado because it sounded so good. We put it on toasted plain bagels and it was a very hearty meal. I loved the dill in the mayo, and although I usually loathe sprouts, I admit I liked them with this- they added a good texture and refreshing flavor. I will certianly make this again.

Great! Great visual and pallete appeal. Since I had some blue cheese sauce left over from making the butternut squash soup on this site, I used it for the spread instead of the mayonaise, but still sprinkled the whole arrangement with dill and salt. I made these as an appetzier by using miniature toasts instead of regular bread. Everyone said they were a hit. I'm defintely keeping the recipe around as an appetizer because it was nice to have something able to be completely made ahead. The only flaw was that in using lettuce instead of sprouts, it wilted by the end of the party. I layered mine with toast, lettuce, a dab of blue cheese, 1/5 a slice of bacon, another dab of blue cheese, half a slice of avocado, then the dill and salt.

A nice change from bacon and tomato, this healthful sandwich provides a good use for avocadoes in danger of turning mushy. I used romaine instead of sprouts. Tasty!

My husband made these sandwiches with the PEA SHOOT AND SPINACH SALAD WITH BACON AND SHIITAKEs-a yummy spring dinner.

I have just made these delicious sandwiches because I couldn't think what to do with 1 Avocado sitting in my fridge. I substituted the green tops of a salad onion instead of chives and added herb salad leaves. Certainly make it again. My husband thought they were great. Love your web site.

Yum! Bacon and avocado is my favourite sandwich filling. The second time I made it I couldn't be bothered making the herb mayo so I just used blue cheese dressing - excellent!

This was a great "in-a-pinch" dinner with a salad. I used LF mayo instead of "full-fat." I got fave reviews and I would definitely make again, especially for a brunch/lunch!

Simply delcious. Instead of splattering the stove top with bacon grease, I prefer cooking bacon in a rimmed pan in a 400 degree oven for 15-20 minutes. The bacon is perfectly flat and crisp. We have a herb garden so the herbs were picked and the great sandwich eaten minutes later. Yummy.

So simple and delicious! We come back to this recipe again and again. While fresh dill is definitely best, dried dill will also work in a pinch--just make the mayo first and let it stand while you prepare everything else.

A classic! Other fresh herbs work well in the mayo -- we like tarragon. Or lots of fresh cilantro with red onion. Yum!

Ok,ok, I could have thought of this myself-but I thought the herbed mayo was really yummy!! Added tomatoes and lettuce. We thought it was great!!
