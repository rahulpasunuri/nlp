While the cheesecake itself came out beautifully and was delicious, the crust was a disappointment. The recipe calls for flour and brown sugar instead of white sugar, and water in addition to butter. This makes for a very chewy crust, which I don't particularly like. I'll make this recipe again but next time I'll make a standard graham cracker crust. I wasn't a fan of the Orange Caramel Sauce, but I'll review that on that recipe's page.

This is one of my favorite cheesecake recipes. I've made it twice now and it's always a hit. I did not have any problems with the orange sauce.. it's delicious and even better the next day.

Unlike other reviewers, I had no problems with the caramel sauce. I simply omitted the direction to wait ten minutes after stewing the orange slices in the caramel and instead put it straight into the food processor. After processing it was thick but still went through the sieve. My problem instead was with the cheesecake itself. The foil wrap around the springform pan did not work AT ALL and so my cheesecake was literally soaked from the bottom up. I did some Googling after this fiasco and will in the future fill a roasting pan with water, put it in the oven when I first turn it on and then bake the cheesecake on the rack ABOVE the roasting pan. Everyone on the Internet says there is virtually no way to seal a springform pan set directly into a water bath.

The cheesecake is delicious. However, as others have mentioned, the Caramel Orange Sauce is just about impossible. Caramel hardens as it cools. This recipe has you putting the hot caramel sauce into a blender and then trying to put it through a strainer. By the time you get to the strainer, it is back to being a solid. I would suggest that this was never tried in a test kitchen.

This is the best cheese cake ever! Even the New York cheese cake recipe from my East Coast friends doesn't come close!

I had similar trouble with the sauce but then simply juiced the orange and added it with the butter and salt. It turned out perfect with orange slices added.

Loved the cheesecake itself but the carmel sauce was a disaster! I've made carmel many times but this turned into a thick mess that was impossible to strain. I served the cheesecake alone and everyone loved it.
