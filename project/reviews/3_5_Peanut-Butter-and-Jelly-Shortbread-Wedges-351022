This was relatively easy to make. I'm obsessed with all things PB&J and was sent this recipe from a friend. Had no problems making it, but think the freezing of the dough and then grating it onto the rest of the dough was unnecessary and could be simplified (could even do a pie-like cross-weave top crust). Used red raspberry preserves to avoid a trip to the store, and my husband and I thought that a good taste, even though some of the flavor died out in baking. Would probably not make this again, though, mostly b/c shortbread tends to be too dry for my tastes. But it was still tasty (but I recommend using more peanut butter to get more flavor or even chop up some peanuts to layer on top of the jam!).

I simplified this a little. Pressed half the dough in a 8x8 square pan, spread on jam, and then just crumbled on remaining dough. Didn't bother with freezing. Took about 30 mins. Cut into very small squares. Crumbly, rich, and delish.

Interesting enough , for me it needed more Peanut Butter.

These were pretty good - I feel like i was expecting a different texture. I've made raspberry bars in the past (with a shortbread bottom and topping) and they had a nice texture - i think i was expecting something like that. These PB&J bars were a little soft - maybe add some oatmeal in the topping? I also used way more than 1/3 cup jelly (i used raspberry). My boyfriend really like them- so i'll make them again if he requests them - but not necessarily for myself.

THIS WAS SO DELICIOUS MY 26 YEAR OLD SON ASKED IF HE COULD EAT THE ENTIRE BATCH and my fussy eater 3 yr old grandson didnt even look, just gobbled it donw. I used grape jame instead of the blackberry because my family does not like blackberry but aside from that... followed the recipe. read thru recipe first as there is some down time to freexe hald the dough to make the topping but its just one hour.

I have made these 3 times and they are really easy and delic. I am pretty sure I use more jelly than they call for I don't measure it just put on a generous amount. I also used regular PB one time and natural the other 2 and did not seem to affect the cookies.

An easy, trouble-free recipe that produces wedges that disappear in seconds! I've made them twice, and the 2nd time I shortened the cooking time by 5 minutes and used a few more tablespoons of jelly, just to bring out a bit more jelly flavor. I was amazed to see people eat one and then quickly reach for another without hesitating. Wow!

I have made this 3 times already, its so easy and delicious. the first time i made it with chocolate peanut butter and it was good but couldn't really taste the chocolate. many people have already asked me for the recipe. it's a keeper.

This had great flavor- but I reduced the sugar and increased the salt to an extra large pinch since my PB was unsalted. I would have given this 4 forks, but it didn't get quite as firm as I would have liked even after 55 minutes in the oven. The texture was very crumbly and creamy, almost more like an over-buttery scone. Still delicious, though!
