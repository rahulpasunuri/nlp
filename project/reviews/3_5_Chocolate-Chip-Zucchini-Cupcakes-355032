A little dense but delicious. I used a heaping cup of zucchini and next time will not over shred it. Also i would recommend less chocolate chips

I used 1 overflowing cup of the zucchini and the cupcakes were superb! I suspect that the dough's consistency would have been a bit runny and the cupcakes too airy had I used 2 cups.

1/2 a pound of zucchini makes 2 cups not one. Although the extra cup still tasted good in the result. Mine stuck to the wrappers as well and I used yummy coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.

This might be my new "go to" recipe when I need to use extra zucchini from the garden. The batter is thick - like other reviewers stated. I made the recipe 'mostly' as printed, except added about a Tbsp of milk to make the batter manageable, substituted 1/4 C. brown sugar and 2/3 C. raw sugar, and estimated the amount of zucchini - probably a little extra. Delicious - not too sweet and a nice crunchy top. The recipe made 6 large cupcakes.

These were very good, consumed with pleasure by children and grownups alike. Changes I made were to process the zucchini with a banana in the cuisinart, whole wheat flour, a little less oil, sugar and choc chips. Still good, still moist. I'm interested in adding some wheat bran next time to add in some more fiber. Seriously: make these.

I doubled the recipe and substituted yogurt and they are delicious! Thanks for the recipe! However, I had an issue because the muffins stuck to the muffin cups and so they don't separate from them and you have to kind of chew them off the wrapper - was this my fault for using yogurt and, if so, how can I avoid it but still make low-fat version in the future? Has anyone else experienced this? Thanks!

This is an excellent use of zucchini! I have made these scrumptious cupcakes twice so far, doubling it with success each time. Like other reviewers, I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and liked the results. I love cinnamon and the flavor it adds, so I doubled the amount and didn't think it was overpowering. Many happy eaters!

Made these with a few tender zucchini from my garden. Did not change any thing and they are wonderful. The batter was pretty thick until I added the zucchini. It got better, but was still fairly stiff. Next time, I might make them into 8 or 9 cupcakes instead of 12, as they are fairly small!

A wonderful snack for on the go and I don't feel horrible for eatting it for breakfast either. ;)

Made as written with the exception of using some shredded frozen zucchini I had from last year. Took as a snack to a meeting and people raved about it! Many were asking for the recipe. Quick, easy, delicious!

I used two small zucchinis and one mashed banana. I whizzed the zuccs in a magic bullet/processor as per the other reviews. I also reduced the sugar to a scant 3/4 cup. They came out great, moist and sweet.

Kids loved these...definitely a keeper. I was glad to have advance warning about the thickness of the batter...so I tackled that two ways. First I shredded the zucchini very finely (as an added bonus it then becomes virtually undetectable after baking!). Secondly I added the shredded zucchini to the very heavy batter not by hand after mixing as recommended but instead while it was mixing and it instantly thinned it out to manageable levels. Much easier than I anticipated!

I didn't even read the reviews. It does come up like a cookie dough but I didn't change a thing and just plunked it into the moulds. It still came out perfect! I didn't have chocolate chips so I used sultanas which might've added to the moisture. Yummy! Perfect for my husband's sweet tooth.

As others noted, the batter mixes up more like a cookie dough than a muffin batter. Two tbsp of milk did the trick, and I baked them only 25 minutes, for about 16 medium cupcakes - delicious!

I did as others suggested and added more zucchini and water. I also added toasted walnuts. Next time I will add more zucchini. With what I did add I had enough for 26 cupcakes. I would probably like the larger cupcakes if I was trying to serve this as a dessert. Next time I think I will use brown sugar. My husband really liked them, and he dosen't like chocolate.

My 2.5 year old approved. Changes I made - whole wheat, brown sugar. Took another reviewers idea of pureeing the zucchini in the Cuisinart, which worked well. Doing this first gave it time to "sweat" and the extra liquid was just enough to wet the batter making it mixable. Changes I'd make next time, cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup, 1/2 the cinnamon, 1/2 the chips (sacrilegious I know, but they really seems to over power and 2.5 year olds don't need that much chocolate).

Yes, the mix is a little dry. I added some water and they turned out great!

In order to make this less muffin- like, super moist and super delicious, combine a few of the other reviewers ideas - I did and it was AMAZING!! I added 1/4 cup extra oil and I grated up 2 zucchinis - 1 I pureed in the food processor to make 1 cup of thick puree and then I made 1 cup of coursely food processed. The batter was indeed very thick before I added the zucchini, which I stirred in with the chips by hand. I made 6 super large cupcakes/muffins (whatever you want to call them!) and cooked them for 35 minutes and they were perfect all the way through. After they cooled completely, I sprinkled with powdered sugar. I would absolutely make this again.

To all who are experiencing a dry batter, that's ok. The zucchini releases its moisture during baking so the end result can be moist without the batter seeming so. I would agree with all the muffin-type comments, but it didn't bother me. I loved the harder top with gooey soft bottom. Love these overall!

I was really surprised with how good these are. My kids loved them. I think I figured out the trick to avoid the stiff batter. I put the the zucchini in the food processor and pureed it. This gave it a more liquid consistency. I will definitely make these again. I also used whole wheat flour.

I've made this twice and they are quite tasty. But, the batter is incredibly stiff. I added extra oil, which helped, but I know can't be healthy.

Very tasty! Definitely more muffin than cupcake. The tops had a nice slightly crunchy texture which made them delicious without frosting. I was initially startled by the thickness of the batter, and ended up mixing it with my hands at the end. But if you don't mind getting your hands a little dirty, they're actually quite good! These would be an excellent choice for children's parties.

I just made these and after reading the reviews about being dry I added 1/4 cup skim milk. I also cooked them about 20 min. They were great. Good crumb and moist and fuggie. I frosted them with peanut butter frosting

double the zucchini and the dryness is gone.

The batter was far too dry, I had to add an extra egg to even mix it. The cupcakes tasted all right but could have been a lot moister. I won't make them again.

I agree that these are denser than what I'd call a "cupcake" and are more like a "muffin." Once I incorporated the flour mix into the sugar-oil-egg mix, the batter became so thick I had to mix in the zucchini and chocolate chips with my hands, and I was really afraid they would be gross. However, they were really tasty and not too sweet about 15 min out of the oven-- I ate 2. We'll see how they taste tomorrow!

These are really a muffin/cupcake hybrid. We haven't made it to the second day with them yet, but they were a huge hit right out of the oven. Another great way to sneak some veggies into a 2 year old's diet!

I call these muffins rather than cupcakes. They were great. I used extra virgin coconut oil for the vegetable oil, about 1/2 cup of dark chocolate chips, also used dark unsweetened chocolate. They were yummy!

Kids gave these a big thumbs up. You can barely taste the veggies. We enjoyed these melty,chocolatey goodies right out of oven.

Good way to use extra zucchini! I've made these muffins twice. The first time I followed the recipe except for using cake flour (was all I had at the moment!) and used regular nestle semi-sweet chips. The second time I made the following changes: still used cake flour, increased the vanilla to 1 tsp. and added a pinch more cinnamon and used nestle mini- chips instead. Counter to the other reviewers, I think these are better the second day. I will be interested to see what modifications other cooks make - my muffins are incredibly moist but there seems to be a missing incredient to add some complexity to the flavor.

Great use for a large zucchini that I was given. Best eaten within a day. Added powdered sugar to the top.

Wow! Incredibly bad, which is really surprising for a "Gourmet" recipe. Too oily, a bit too dry. The only pleasant taste was the chocolate chips. Wasted a double batch of these.

My co-workers all enjoyed them, though they're best about 15 minutes out of the oven, while the chocolate chips are still "melty." Very simple use for that extra zucchini in the fridge
