btw...loved the sauce, but the cake doesn't need it. I am making it in loaf form this time so that I can toast it for buttering.

This moist, dark, rich gingerbread captured everyone's attention and really had the feel of the Christmas Season it it's flavor. It got better over time and I am making it again Wednesday for a brunch on Saturday. I made my own applesauce out of 4 gala apples and some water on the stove, left the skins on for an even better taste in the cake. Also added about a 1/4 cup minced crystalized ginger and that put the flavor over the top.

Very easy to make. The cake is quite good and is very moist with a strong ginger flavor, like you're eating ginger snaps in cake form. The sauce however was a mixed bag. Some people loved it but I thought you could taste the cornstarch through the cider. I'll definitely make this cake again but will probably find a different sauce.

Fantastic! A little ginger, spicy in the finish. Very nice after a heavy dinner...not overly sweet. Very easy to make as well!

I made this for my husband who likes a lite dessert (I am the one who loves the decadent ones!). It is very delicious and is perfect flavors for the fall.
