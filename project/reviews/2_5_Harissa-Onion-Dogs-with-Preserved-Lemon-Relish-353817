OK - interesting combo of ingredients & flavors that meld together nicely, but did not wow me.

I made the lemon relish and harissa onions to go with hot dogs. I wish Id added the hummus too but it was good anyway. I think a little of the lemon relish goes a long way since its so salty so we had enough left over to serve later in the week with harissa marinated sirlion tips.

This was a wonderful, more like a dipping sauce, or dressing, not a relish. Also, used it for a marinate for grilled chicken.

Confessedly, I didn't serve this relish and onion/harissa combo with hot dogs (did burgers and sausages instead), but the preserved lemon relish was such a huge hit that my friends are begging me to make it again. The tang, salt, and herbiness went together beautifully. We ended up using leftovers on eggs, in salads, and truth-be-told I caught my husband eating it by the spoonful out of the fridge.
