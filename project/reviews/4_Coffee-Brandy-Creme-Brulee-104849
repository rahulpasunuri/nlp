Great recipe. Used about 3 tablespoons of freshly brewed vanilla-flavored coffee instead of crystals. Doubled the brandy (Metaxa) and vanilla. I struggled with a mini-torch (was taking forever!) and finally caramelizedd the topping in my oven. Yummy and so easy to make.

I made this for a dinner party tonight and couldn't resist sneaking a taste. Delicious! I doubled the recipe for the number of guests I'm expecting. I didn't use instant coffee crystals - I substituted 3 tablespoons of freshly made espresso. And I tripled the brandy called for to get some extra kick. (It was good brandy too.) YUM.

This was much easier to make than I expected. The flavor and texture of the custard was truly outstanding however using brown sugar on top gave it a slightly burnt flavor. Next time I make this (and there definitely WILL be a next time!) I will use regular white sugar to caramelize over the top.

I'm not really a creme brulee fan, but decided to make this for my dinner guests who love it. They couldn't stop raving and insisted I send them the recipe, saying this was some of the best they have ever had (and they have it alot). This was my first time making it and the recipe couldn't be simpler. Because of ingredients I had on hand, I made 2 changes. I used 1 tsp of espresso vs. 1.5 of instant coffee crystals and I substituted Grand Marnier for the brandy. Also used a kitchen torch (FUN)! instead of using the broiler. This is a winner and I am now a creme brulee convert!

This was an incredibly easy and delightful dessert to make! I ended up using Bailey's instead of the brandy (kept the coffee though) and it was delicious! I tried using brown sugar on some of the custards and white sugar on others. The white sugar resulted in a more even brulee topping but the brown sugar topping was much more delicious. Be sure to pack the brown sugar evenly to avoid any burning on the tops.

Perfect!! A perfect blend of sweet and coffee. So so good!

This has rapidly become a favorite of mine and of my friends. Changes I have made include using espresso coffee instead of the instant type and substituting the brandy with cognac, all of which is nicely torched.

This was a hit, BUT, in my oven, 350 for 35 minutes was too long. The water boiled and the brulees had a cracking, over-cooked look. The taste was divine, but next time I'll likely reduce the temp to 300 and watch the time. I havled the recipe with no problems and it didn't quite fit my 3 LARGE brulee ramikins.

I have made this recipe a couple of times. I don't use instant coffee, I crack whole espresso beans, add them to the cream and bring to a simmer. I then turn off the heat, cover and let steep until the cream is flavored to taste. I strain the cream before proceeding with the recipe as directed.

Will definitely be making this again and again. Simple and delicious...can definitely see the taste variations depending on the liquor used. Now that I've discovered how simple creme brulee is I won't be ordering it in restaurants anymore.

this sounds fabulous! sorry, I too hate people who write in when they haven't made the item. BUT, I'm wondering if anyone has made this using expresso or other brewed coffee, perhaps reduced. I never have instant coffee in the house and I'm reluctant to buy it just for this recipe. So help anyone? please give directions/ amounts if you've tried it; many thanks!

This is perfect for anyone who wants to impress. It can all be done in advance. I do prefer using white sugar v. brown as it distributes more evenly.

Fabulous recipe. Custard comes out great and the flavor is wonderful. Always get rave comments about this at dinner parties. It's a tradition at every Christmas party. As a recipe change you can replace the coffeee crystals with real coffee by putting the hot sugar and cream mixture into a French press with some real coffee of your choosing.

Excellent!! Have made several times and gotten rave reviews. Can be made a day or two ahead and refridgerated to help with time management especially on a busy holiday.

I love this recipe ! I used a kitchen torch for the sugar top . I also added Kula which was also great ( I got the idea from a restaurants creme brulee I had once)

Rating: 2
I was a little disappointed based on the other reviews but to be fair, a really high quality instant coffee could make this recipe better. I used what I had on hand (folgers).

This recipe is excellent just as written with no adjustments. Needs time in frig to set and also time in frig for the sugar to harden. Do not cover as this will make top soft. Very easy and very very good. I love the traditional Creme Brulee, but tried this one and the coffee flavor was outstanding. I will make this again for sure. Impressive dish without the difficulty.

The flavor was good, but the custards broiled unevenly and the topping was not at all crunchy after being refirigerated for 2 hours before serving. I may try again with a kitchen torch I just bought, using white sugar and carmelizing right before serving.

Great combination of flavors. I doubled the recipe and it turned out perfect. I used Grand Marnier for the brandy and used 2C whipping cream and 2C heavy cream. I also supplemented the vanilla extract with a vanillia bean. Leaving the brown sugar out awhile to dry it out a little was a good suggestion. This was the firstb time I mixed everything in the cream first. I'll always do it that way going forward - makes blending a lot easier. Great recipe!

It had an excellent balance of coffee and brandy! I must admit that it was my first time making it, so I kinda over-whipped the yolk and the texture turned out to be not as smooth as I hoped it to be. Apart from that, it was fabulous :) A quick and easy dessert that is sure to impress!

Fabulous creme brulee. Prepared by a catered dinner party Saturday and they were scaping out the dishes with their fingers. Lovely texture and excellent flavor.

This was my first attempt at making creme brulee after having received the "torch" for a gift. WOW! This is the easiest and most delicious recipe! I made this for our dinner club and everyone loved it. There were six of us, so I doubled the recipe (I hate to be skimpy). A dessert to make again and again.

EXCELLENT. We have tried most of the creme brulee recipes on this site, and this is one of our favorites by FAR.

Rating: 4
Wonderful recipe! I have made this several times for special occasions to rave reviews. One change that I have incorporated is to add only ½ teaspoon of coffee crystal so as to only give the brulee a hint or suggestion of coffee flavor. Worth the time and effort since it is an easy recipe. Oh ya, spring for a torch and never burn the top again!

I really loved this recipe and it was, in fact, my first attempt at making creme brulee. It is very simple, although you REALLY have to watch it under the broiler as they seemed to brown unevenly. One of those little blow torches would probably be worth the investment. Loved the coffee-brandy flavor. Next time I'll try coffee and Frangelica (hazelnut liqueor). Oh, and I used 5 egg yolks because practically every recipe I saw for creme brulee called for 5.

Not sure if I would make this brulee again. It was definately good, but not for an average creme brulee eater. If you love coffee & so do all of your guests...definately. They didn't say so, but I think my guests would've preferred a cup of coffee and a dish of vanilla creme brulee.

Can Creme Brulee really be this easy? YES, it is! Turned out great. My husband loved it. Only change I made was no coffee crystals, no brandy, instead I substituted coffee liqueur (approx. 1½ t.) It turned out with just a hint of coffee flavor.

Fantastic! Want easy? Got it! Want Delicious? Got it? Want to 'WOW!' your guests with something they have only thought of having at a five star restaurant? Got it! Did I mention that it was good? I have been making C.B. for about 10 years and this is a keeper! Try rum/cognac/grand marnier for variety.

I can't believe how easy this recipe was -- considering how sweet and delicate the outcome! I thought I was going to melt as I was whisking the coffee crystals into the whipping cream! I didn't do the caramel on the broiler (worried that the glass custard cups would shatter) so I caramelized the sugar over the stove instead. It worked very well. My husband was very impressed with my "experiment", and asked me to make it for our upcoming dinner party. :)

I was a chef in Europe for a while. I now cook for friends as a hobby and I must say this dish is superb. I left the ingredients virtually unchanged, but made it as one large dish, so altered the temperature and cooking time. The result was and impressive centrepiece with the perfect, balanced taste and texture. Cracking the caramellised topping at the table added to the meal. I will keep this and present it whenever I want to impress.

I did it for thanksgiving. One of us doesn't eat desert at all but he asked tree times for creme brulee. The light taste of coffee makes this recipe so perfect. I put the ramekins on ice while broiling. So the custard stays cold after the sugar got caramelized. Two thumbs up!!!

This was my first time making creme brulee, and I'm so pleased with the results! This recipe in unbelievably easy and absolutely fabulous. I garnished my finished product with a little dollop of whipped cream in the center with a chocolate espresso bean on top. My guests were quite imoressed with this dessert and were sure that it took much more effort than it actually did!

I thouroughly enjoyed this recipe although I did alter it slightly. I substituted Kahlua for brandy and carmelized granulated sugar instead of brown sugar. I also prefer to carmelize with a hand-held propane torch over using the broiler.
