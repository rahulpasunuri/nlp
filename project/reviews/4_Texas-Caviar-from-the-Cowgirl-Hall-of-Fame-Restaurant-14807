WAY to much vinegarette. That is all I can taste. Would be excellent with half the amount of vinegarette.

We used to eat at the Cowgirl Hall of Fame a lot when my son was little and were so pleased to see him love the Texas Caviar....I mean a kid eating beans. How great is that? So I was happy to find the recipe and now try to make it often for my family. It's always a big hit, and my neighbors from Texas were so excited when I brought them a container full as well. Delicious and healthy and fun!!!

there used to be a link under the vinaigrette to get to a recipe, but there is not anymore. Why? What vinaigrette do I use?

I've made this several times and it seems to turn out different each time - not sure why. For New Year's this year I used dried black eyed peas because the store was out of canned (high hopes for 2010?). Cooked them less than the package instructions and they still turned to mush. Okay for soup but I would use canned or frozen peas next time for the more reliable and firmer texture. I also used Rotel tomatoes as one reviewer suggested and they were disgusting. I prefer parsley over cilantro and one cup of vinagrette is usually more than enough. I would suggest tasting your balsamic vinegar first and maybe subbing with some red wine vinegar as I used a good aged balsamic and it was too sweet. That said, this is a good dish for a large gathering and the flavor improves remarkably as it stands. Make it at least a day ahead.

I made this recipe for a group of teens who do not like veggies. They moaned and groaned until they tasted it. Then they cleaned the bowl. I cut down significantly on the vinaigrette. I only used about 1/2 cup - followed the recipe for everything else. My son has requested this recipe for a New Years Day football game viewing snack. What a surprise, he is asking for a vegetable.

Wow! This 10 yr old recipe is fabulous. I used redwine vinegar and fresh colored peppers, but the real treat are the wicked jalepenos, I never know if they'll have any heat, and the 4 I chose will make your toes curl, this dip is yummy. Should be perfect by New Years Eve if I don't eat it first! Cumin is a must!

This was great. I did change the Tabasco with the Smoked Chipolte Tabasco. Milder heat and a nice smoky flavor.

Big hit at our annual holiday party. I reduced the Tabasco sauce to 1 1/2 tsp.

I have made this for many years and it NEVER disappoints. Guests always ask for the recipe...especially if they're not from Texas. I substitute yellow and orange bell peppers for color. Definitely make ahead of time, so that the peas can absorb the sauce. It's an easy dish to prepare beforehand then top with fresh herbs once you have it in the serving bowl. Always a crowd pleaser, and very unexpected outside of Texas

A true family favorite. It doesnt get any better than this! Be prepared for all who taste to beg you for the recipe.

I've already made this a few times since New Year's and been asked for the recipe because it's so good! I followed most of the suggestions: cilantro instead of parsley, red bell instead of pimentos, rotel, black beans and reduce the oil and vinegar. I found the evoo too conflicting and so it only needed 1/4c canola and 1/4c balsamic. Just for grins I added some celery and dashed some cumin. Try it warm, too. This is great as a side dish for bbq or rolled up in tortillas. Avocados and sour cream are great condiments for this.

This is a crowd favorite. Easy to make and easy to eat. Love,love,love it. Made homemade pita chips, (pita bread cut into slices bit of olive oil, fresh rosemary, salt and pepper in a 350 degrees oven for about 7 minutes) Fantastic combination!

Very good. Needs to sit in fridge for a couple of days for flavors to meld. Big hit on New year's.

I have made this recipe many times to rave reviews. I have modified it as time goes on. I use 1 can of black eyed peas, 1 can black beans and 1 can of red kidney beans. The three types of beans gives the recipe a great texture. I also use 2 generous tsps. of cilantro instead of parsley, one jalapeno, chopped. I have also used other reviewer's recommendations of 1/2 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar for the vinaigrette. I have also used Rotel tomatoes instead of the chopped tomatoes. I never have leftovers. This recipe is just so healthy.

Added corn one time - did not like that changes the old 'caviar' into salsa... Made again with ingred as listed, except subbed fresh cilantro for parsley, pepper for pimento, fresh jalapeno. A shot of fresh lime juice before serving. Used balsamic dressing made fresh.

Rating: 3
We thought this was very good. We didn't have all the exact ingredients. i.e, we used roasted pepper, jarred in place of the pimentos and was stumped on jalapeno chiles--is that the pepper or green chilis? Love the color--great presentation.

Rating: 4
I have been asked for this several times since first making it for my friends. The only changes I make are to add more of all the flavorings, and substitute 1 finely chopped red pepper for the pimentos. I usually use a basic vinaigrette that I make myself, and serve with blue corn tortilla chips

Beyond delicious! I made this as part of a buffet and it was the first thing to go. Everyone loved it and I loved how easy and healthy it is. I made it two days in advance of serving and will do the same thing next time. Enjoy!

I could eat this every day! I always add lots of corn, black beans and black olives. I put the left-overs in quesadilla with smoked gouda - yum!

A wonderful black-eyed pea salad for a Southern New Years Day dinner! Following the recommendations of others, I used 1 t. dried oregano, cilanto instead of parsley, one can of Ro-Tel instead of the tomato, and a dressing of 1/2 c. olive oil and 1/4 c. balsamic vinegar. This is one of my favs!

so yummy. my favorite part of going to the restaurant... and now I can make it at home.

Really good, healthy dip. I could not find canned black-eyed peas in my local store. I used frozen instead. The frozen required about 1 hour cooktime, but I just prepared everything else in the interim (BTW, the frozen I used were labeled purple-hull peas). I used Ken's Light Olive Oil Viniagrette, which was a great choice. I also cut the Tabasco to 1/3T and the jalapeno to 1/2 of a big one, since kids would also be eating. I added one cup frozen corn for color and sweetness and cut the peas to 3.5 cups. I did not marinate for 4 hours, since I had a difficult time finding the canned peas. I just tossed the warm, just-cooked peas into the dressing and stuck in the freezer for 30 minutes before leaving. Still tasted great!

Rating: 3
Yum! We made our batch with 1 cup of vinagrette, which I thought was MORE than enough. In fact, next time I might even consider using lime juice and olive oil instead of vinegar to make it more tangy and a bit less Italian-tasting. Otherwise, delicious! I just had some on a tostada for an afternoon snack. It gets better and better in the fridge...

Compliments pour in for this recipe. I have modified it over the years. I substitute one can of black beans for one of the black eyed peas and I use about 1/8 bunch each parsley and cilantro. I only use one cup vinaigrette. I put most of the wet ingredients in the vinaigrette along with the black pepper (and a few T of juice from the canned jalepenos). I only wish there was some left over to take home after the pot luck!

I've seen many recipes for Texas Caviar and decided to make it with all my favorite ingredients. Turned out the biggest hit of the party. I used frozen niblet corn, a can of black eye peas, a can of black beans, red onion, garlic, diced tomatoes with chiles (drained,)plenty of cilantro, a bottle of italian dressing, juice of a lime, a couple of hits of tobasco, a red or yellow bellpepper and some black pepper. I tossed in diced avocado right before serving and it was fantastic. I plan to try it with balsamic vinegar next time. It does make alot, so you can give it away in jars as a gift for your guests.

I had a great sucess with this recipe for my new years day get together. As I am known as a bad cook, it was very rewarding when hubby pronounced it delicious! I can only echo several comments from others here, yes, 1 cup of vinaigrette is plenty (I used the very cheapest bottled red wine salad dressing); yes, cilantro is the way to go for that Texmex flavor; YES, the tostitos scoops are perfect for this; and yes, we are going to try this again with corn substituted for at least part of the black-eyed peas. I've got to say this is a no-fail dish, even gave my print out of the recipe to my friend who was raving about it. It does make a large amount, we had a small group here today, I'll be bringing the leftovers to work to be inhaled by my starving co-workers. Happy New Year to all!

This turned out great. I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the amount of vinaigrette in half. Also used cilantro instead of the oregano and parsley. Next time I will try using dried and cooked black-eyed peas instead of canned, and maybe a bit more jalapeno for extra heat.

Always popular at casual gatherings -- I omit the pimentos, reduce the amount of vinaigrette, replace the green pepper with a colored one just for looks and add a fresh red chile or two.

Excellent dish to take to a New Year's party. However, I agree...only one cup of dressing; add cilantro, ditch the parsley, and for a change, add a can of niblet corn (adds a nice color too!) I also use a can (drained) of diced tomatoes and green chilis instead of chopping fresh.

This is a near addiction-type snack food. I reduce the dressing by half, increase the garlic and add cilantro. Yummy!!!

This salad is really good, I especially like the spicy kick. I added cilantro to the recipe. You do not need two cups of dressing unless you want this salad to become an oily soup.

i used balsamic vinegar (1 cup), canned diced tomatoes with green pepper and onion already in it to save time and would suggest skipping the parsely.

This is a great spin on the traditional black-eyed pea! My family really enjoyed it! I used dried oregano. And I too, only used one cup of the vinagrette. (I think 2 cups would have been to soupy). It has a nice spicy kick! Will definitely make again!

Healthy eating just doesn't get better than this. This is delightful, and is made even more fantastic by substituting fresh cilantro (if you're a fan that is) for the parsley. Yum!!

This was fun to make and my guests loved it! But this does make a ton and if you are serving other dishes, I would only make a half recipe next time. Also, easy on the tabasco. It was too hot for some.

This is SO good! I made it for our New Year's party and everyone loved it. The fresh oregano really makes it. I did reduce the vinaigrette (I used Paul Newman's oil and vinegar dressing)to one cup which was plenty. Also since tomatoes are not in season, I used a can of diced tomatoes instead. The next day I mixed the leftovers in with cooked white and wild rice for a rice salad. Equally great!!!

I love this recipe. I used fresh black eyed peas and quartered grape tomatoes. For the viniagrette I used Paul Newmans Balslamic Viniagrette. I also substituted Habanero pepper Hot sauce for the Tabasco. Turned out great. Just the right amount of spice. Will definitely make again. Even my eight year old liked it. Will definitely make again.

Made this as the good luck dish for our new year's feast. Wonderful. That night we ate it as a cold salad on the side, and the next day we had it with tortilla chips as a dip. Wonderful both ways. I only used one cup of vinaigrette (sp?) and that was just right for us. Also, had mistakenly bought a fat free one, and was a little nervous, but this recipe has so much kabang that it didn't matter. It makes an awful lot though!

The first time I made it to the original recipe and it was really just average. I believe the vinaigrette that I used took away some of the flavor. The next time I used celantro instead of parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a can of diced tomoatoes and 1/2 a bottle of Kraft Sun dried tomato salad dressing instead of the vinaigrette. It was awesome and got rave reviews.

Made this for an office "Country Christmas" luncheon - to rave reviews. Made a double batch, but used only 2 cups of vinagrette - it STILL seemed like way too much - the other ingredients were swimming. I drained at least 3/4 cup before serving. Also substituted canned chopped tomatoes and chilis, and red peppers for green - the whole thing was very pretty and Christmas-y

I love this recipe - and so do my co-workers! Unlike other reviewers I don't feel that the recipe is overwhelmed with viniagrette; I think the amount is just right. I use canned chopped tomatoes with green chilies (plus the jalapenos & tabasco!), cilantro instead of parsley and whatever flavor bottled viniagrette peaks my interest (Ken's light olive oil is a current favorite).

YIKES! A whole tablespoon of tabasco was too much. It went from spicy to cranky inferno in a heartbeat. I took the suggestion of using a yellow bell pepper for color, was gorgeous. Next time, and there will be a next time, I'll lighten up on the tabasco.

Great variation on the chips'n'dip theme. Very complex taste, tart and refreshing. My wife was skeptical when she read the recipe, but now says I'm going to have to make it "all the time." Next time I'm going to try using just one cup of vinaigrette, as the liquid overwhelmed the solids and that will keep it a touch healthier...

I took this to my sister's Super Bowl party yesterday. Had just a spoonful left when we had to leave. Sister kept the little bit and hid it in the fridge so she would have a midnight snack. I left out the pimentos since I don't care for them. Wish you had put in the exact measurements for the vinegarette, since I wasn't sure how to make it. Your attached recipe didn't give the measurements. Definitely will make this again.

This stuff is so delicious! And the funny thing is that I don't really like any of the individual ingredients. I made it for my New Year's party, and it was a hit. My guests took home all the leftovers. I cut the Tabasco in half (some of my guests didn't like heat), and since I forgot to print out the vinaigrette recipe, I dumped in two bottles of Ken's Olive Oil Vinaigrette from the grocery store. Turned out great, and got better with age!

Recipe was good...after tasting, we drained off the viniagrette...may need that amount to marinate, but not to eat! Did not have extra jalapenos, so we added red pepper flakes to add more kick. Definitely a recipe to try, divide in thirds and experiment with!
