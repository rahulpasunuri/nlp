This is a good recipe, pretty simple, just not that exciting. The fresh mint flavor was wonderful. I used creme de menthe liquor because it was what i had on hand and that worked fine. These would be a nice addition to a candy tray.

In response to the cook from NYC. We were taught in culinary school that the reason you add butter when making ganache is to give a glossy sheen. Didn't make this recipe so did not rate.

The only reason to add butter is if you're using mediocre chocolate. Otherwise, just make a simple ganache by whisking 1 C. of cream (after bringing to a boil & cooling 3 times) with 1 lb. of chocolate - that's all that's necessary. I followed this recipe out of curiosity (I'd never made truffles before) and then made a batch as described above, infusing the cream with black tea. And I think my black-tea ones were much better. They tasted like fine chocolate, not like chocolate that was trying to hide. (Go ahead and make these, they're tasty, but don't feel that you have to use Callebaut or Valhrona!)
