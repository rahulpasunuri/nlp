I would use less liquid and more cheese. Basically it was very tasty and all like it. Will try again but with some tweeks.

I made a few changes to this recipe. Although I love Anthony Bourdain and I'm sure his mom is a great cook, I had bay scallops and if I simmered them for 5 minutes they would have turned into little balls of rubber. So I brought the broth to a boil, turned off the heat, added the scallops and let them sit off heat for 5 minutes. That worked perfectly. I also didn't want to boil the mushrooms. I browned them in butter with some shallots and garlic and then added the flour. I put the guyere into the sauce to melt and topped the dish with grated Parmesano Reggiano and toasted my breadcrumbs in advance. I wanted them really crispy. I didn't use cute little separate ramekins either. I just put the whole pan (a Cuisinart stainless steel Everyday pan) under the broiler. This was really restaurant quality and my husband and I fought over the leftovers. Great dish.

I've made this many times. Always with frozen rather than fresh scallops, mainly due to price. The flavors always wow my guests. Several times it turned out watery. Instead of adding flour to compensate, I just cut the water to 1 cup. The consistency was just right. There must be something to the injection of water into sea scallops. I like this fix I invented.

Changes I made was that I used 1-1/2 cups of water, added garlic, and sauted onions/ mushrooms before hand. Made mash potatoes and broiled all in same broiler friendly pan. Easy to make and nice presentation!

I have made this numerous times and it's always a hit. I also loved the tip from "aoregan" to put a ring of mashed potatoes on top, served in a ramekin. The potatoes turn nice and brown with a little butter brushed on top before putting them under the broiler!

I added one chopped shallot and 2 cloves of garlic. I sauteed them and the onions in butter before adding the liquid, and also added about 1/4 tsp red pepper and 1/2 tsp dry mustard. I thought this was delicious. I put the gruyere into the milk and scallop liquid before broiling to thicken it a little more, and topped the ramekins with bread crumbs and grated romano. I also didn't add any salt since both cheeses are kinda salty. I thought it turned out perfectly delicious, and would definitely make this again!

Great dish - but I kept wanting garlic. If you do not cook the dish right away - you may want to put in the oven at 350-375 for 15 min and then broil the top - otherwise it does not heat all the way through.

I have recently moved and I think the book with my Coquilles recipe is still in the POD!!. So this one looked close. Here is how I modified it. I switched shallots for the onion and sauteed them in butter until translucent before putting 1/2 of them them in the water. I used only about 1 1/2 cups of water and there was still alot of sauce. I used the 8 oz of regular mushrooms but also used 8 ozs of Shitake mushrooms - sauteed with the remainder of the shallots and additional butter before putting them into the poaching liquid. Whoever suggested serving this with mashed potatoes was brillant. The seasoning at the end is critical. I suspect those who rated this poorly were low on the salt and pepper which brings all the flavors together. DJB - from Bryn Mawr, PA

This recipe was so disappointing. The flavor of the sauce was nothing special, and there was way too much sauce for the amount of scallops. I make this as an appetizer for a dinner party, and I threw half of it away. Nobody ate it.

OK, the cook whou couldn't get it to thicken was not using dry scallops. In an attempt to seperate you from your money many scallops have up to 15% saline (salt and water) injected in them. When this is released during cooking, the sauce becomes thinner. If you're not using Diver Scallops (Dry) then add two more tablespoons of flour. You can also skip the lemon juice and replace it with lemon zest. I use milk (not cream) and omit the bread crumbs entirely. A little paprika on the top adds a nice color.

Amazing! I learned to love this dish when I worked at Prince of Whales Restaurant in Niagara on the Lake, many years ago, and its still a favourite of mine. This recipe, exactly as is, is definitely restaurant fare! Used the Duchess Potatoe recipe as a reviewer recommeded, Thankyou!! Another Keeper for comfort food.

The sauce for this recipe is delicious, but we add mushrooms plus shrimp and serve it in crepes. Top with additional sauce and grated ricotta salada. Pop under broiler till cheese melts. Makes a lovely presentation, especially when paired with a spinach souffle.

This recipe is absolutly unbelievably delicious..I made if for company a few nights ago and cannot stop thinking about when I can make it again... my guests were totally "wowed" and said it was my best meal yet... I made a salad along side and also put mashed potatoes underneath and fluted some around the outside, TO DIE FOR!!!!!!! cannot wait to do this again..... oh and also served some bread for dipping. Yumm!! do not pass this one up.... youve found the recipe youre looking for.

Well I won't blame the recipe since no one else seemed to have a problem with it... but I cooked this for my french bf as a surprise... and it came out horribly. The sauce just wouldn't thicken and although I followed the recipe exactly, we both agreed that the herb flavors just didn't come through. Very bland and a bummer of a disappointment. C'est la vie.

I agree, this dish is awesome. I serve it with a ring of mashed potatoes around the edges of each ramekin. Have made it lots of times, and everytime I have served to guests they have all requested the recipe. Anne in Seattle

Quite tasty, good for a cold night! My husband & I both have the fall crud/flu and today was gray & rainy - a good day for comfort food - this morning I got it in my head I wanted Coquilles (and nothing else would do)- but clearly neither of us are/were in any shape to head to our local French restaurant. It turned out quite well. In fact I broiled it in ramekins over mashed potatoes - this is how our local French restaurant serves it as a meal. I used the Bouquet Garni with dried spices and it added a nice flavor, I also used a shallot instead of an onion, I forgot the gruyere while at the store so I used the Locatelli (sparingly) that we had in the fridge. I did not chop the scallops either. I'm never good with a roux but it evened out during the broiling process. Let me add my husband does not like scallops and he cleaned his plate.

I can tell you without making this recipe that it is awesome. It is exactly the same recipe I have been making for years.

A real hit with everyone. I added crumbled bacon to the garnish, changed the gruyere cheese to edam and served it in halved and cored croissants with a broccoli crown in the center of the two halves.

We actually made this as written using puff pastry shells instead of ramekins and liked it. We used the remaining scallop and mushroom liquid as the base for a mushroom soup the next day

I too have not yet made this recipe, but am such an admirer of Tony's, I had to leave a comment!! I promise I will make this soon though and when I do, will write a proper review. Tony...I think we all wish you made more episodes of your show...I've seen every one about four times now! (But still keep watching because you crack me up).
