I'll definitely make the sauce again. It was wonderful. But I think it would be better on a veggie like cauliflower or broccoli. I found it a bit overpowering for swordfish.

This was wonderful! It wasn't too sweet or too buttery. I thought it had a lovely flavor. It wasn't bland at all. My husband said it was a Five-Star restaurant meal. We had a side of butternut squash roasted with butter and a little brown sugar and garlic potatoes. Definitely making it again!

I have never been a big fan of butter sauces, but I read the reviews on this sauce and I just had to try it! I was very surprised at how mediocre this sauce was. I made the sauce a first time and made it again because I wasn't impressed by the taste. I thought I had done something wrong, so I made it again, and again it was bad. On top of being too buttery, the sauce was bland. Needless to say, I will never make this again.

in the years that i've been an epicurious i have only written one other review, even though we've had hundreds of awesome meals thanks to all of you who take the time to weigh in. but i would have suffered actual guilt had i not written that this was AMAZING! got home from teaching all day and didn't have the right stuff for the fruit salsa for my go-to swordfish recipe. we shared one swordfish steak and i halved the recipe (used extra sauce for garlic coucous). it was SOOOO good. i don't think the tomatoes are optional.

CAUTION! This is an excellent recipe but be very careful when adding the balsamic vinegar to the melted butter. The instructions are to "remove from heat and whisk in balsamic, etc." You need to let the butter cool down somewhat or the vinegar will cause an eruption that will mess up your stove and maybe even you!

Rating: 4
The chopped tomatoes are not optional! Make sure you mix the sauce thoroughly (one of those coffee frother devices works better than a hand-wielded whisk does).

This was awesome and complimented the fish perfectly. Instead of adding capers, I made a fresh tomato, caper and garlic relish which I served over the polenta I paired with the fish. All the layers went together so nicely. Will definitely make again and will use the sauce for other dishes as well.

I made this recipe last night for my sweetie with just a couple adjustments. The largest change I made to the recipe was substituting 5 tbl olive oil for the butter. (I used 4 tbl olive oil and 1 tbl sesame oil for flavor) A couple hours before dinner, I combined all my sauce ingredients in a tupperware container (including the capers and tomatoes) and whisked until the mustard and honey were combined. I then added my swordfish filets side by side, put on the tupperware lid and shook the container to coat. I put the whole thing in the fridge until I was ready to cook. Using a hot grill pan I pulled out the filets only and seared them (about 2 1/2 minutes per side) to create my first set of grill marks. I then turned down the heat to med - low and turned again letting them cook through more thoroughly. (about 2 minutes more per side depending on size of steak) Once fish is done plate and cover then ad sauce to pan and turn up heat to med. let bubble and stir to pick up the grill flavor. Serve over fish.

fast and easy. i didn't add the capers because i was out of them and my honey doesn't like them. adding them would have solved my only complaint - the sauce was too sweet by itself.

Nice and simple. Easy to make with very good flavor. Not OMG flavorful (that's my 4 fork rating) but savory with good balance. I reheated the sauce with halved cherry tomatoes and the capers for about 30 sec over high heat. I had another brown butter swordfish recipe but this one will take it's place!

I pared this down for one person and it was a super-quick, delicious supper after a long day at work. A tablespoon of butter, about the same of balsamic, and a teaspoon of honey. I didn't have any mustard on hand so I just skipped it. Broiled the steak with salt and pepper, and served it on top of the sauce, with lemon wedges for squeezing. Oh my goodness. Delicious.

This was delicious and devoured by all my guests, however, is the sauce supposed to seperate? The honey, vinegar and mustard seemed to cling together and wouldn't stay incorporated with the butter. It tasted great, but makes me wonder what I did wrong. Any suggestions?

Thank goodness I did not pour the sauce over the fish before i tasted it. The sauce was so sweet - it went in the garbage. I double checked the recipe to make sure I used the correct amounts. While the majority of writers like this recipe, beware that it is a sweet sauce.

This was delicious. Although I read the previous warning about hot butter splattering everywhere- it still happened to me also. I halved the recipe but the butter cooks and browns for 6 minutes- it is very hot. Before you add the balsamic vinegar let it cool slightly. I had a mess on my hands- but it was worth it. Great sauce!

My husband and I are big swordfish fans, so I'm always on the hunt for a new one. This is a keeper. The recipe is incredibly easy, I omitted the capers (hubby can live without) and added the tomatoes to the sauce instead of a garnish. I also grilled the swordfish instead of the saute method and it came out moist as usual. The flavors are wonderful and so tasty considering such simple ingredients overall. Thumbs up all the way!

I've made this twice so far - the second time for a dinner party. It's very easy; just keep an eye on the butter as it's simmering. So, so tasty. My dinner guests were impressed. I bet this sauce would be excellent on other fish and maybe even beef.

We almost stood at the stove and ate the sauce from the pot before we got it plated! This sauce is amazing, and so very easy! I didn't have tomatoes, but will try them next time. The swordfish was delicious, being very fresh, but I can't wait to try this sauce on other things--I think it would be fabulous over sauteed veal sweetbreads, for example. I didn't think the butter was too much (and butter in moderation is much healthier than the artificial stuff).

A wonderful dish! I found beautiful fresh marlin steaks and looked for a recipe to make the with and loved this. I read through all the reviews. My take on it: great interesting blend of flavors. The sauce is somewhat rich (just knowing that it contains 1/2 cup butter) but is not heavy. Someone else's review pointed out that you don't want to splash the balsamic vinegar into the hot butter, so I let the butter cool some before adding the rest of the ingredients for the sauce. I made the sauce exactly as recommended and it was great (also was great on asparagus as others have pointed out). 4 minutes per side on these thick marlin steaks was perfect (using medium high heat). The capers are ESSENTIAL! My wife was hesitant and only put a couple on her fish, but after she tasted it with the capers, she piled more on. I didn't use the tomatoes (and I love tomatoes!) and I think it is great without. Definately a recipe I will share with others!

Rating: 3
Great tasting dish...would actually give it "three and a half" forks." The tomatos and capers are recommended on the side. It was a very nice addition. Extremely easy and fast to put together. I found I had to cook the swordfish a bit longer than 4 minutes per side, though.

Although I use this site regularly, I seldom rate recipes, but this one is so outstanding, I wanted to praise it. It is subtle, complex and satisfying.

This was very easy for some extra swordfish we had. I suspect the swordfish itself wasn't as special as I remembered. Or maybe the large swordfish that Wholefoods does now aren't as flavorful as the smaller ones. For sound ecological reasons they only catch large swordfish now so they have a chance to reproduce.

This is a "restaurant worthy" recipe. My boyfriend, who works in fine dining, couldn't believe how delicious it was. I have made it many times to rave reviews. I do, however, use less butter. Also, once the butter has browned, I remove it from the pan, wipe out the browned bits and strain out the bits from the butter before returning it to the pan. This takes out all the bitterness.

Absolutely the best swordfish dish ever. The simplicity of the dish is what makes it so delicious. Had I not prepared it at home, I would have thought it came from a seafood restaurant. The capers definetely give it a special zing. I have made this dish many many times and will never tire of it.

Overall I thought the recipie was good. I orignally followed the recipie, but after making the sauce I realized that there was way to much butter. I added more balsamic vinegar and dijon mustard. Even after that I still felt like it was too rich. I served it with aspargus and boiled potatos. I would definitly make it again, but I alter the sauce. 1/2 stick of butter and keep the same measurments for the vinegar and mustard, possibly remove the honey completely.

I just had to write about a recipe which I was inspired to create by seeing this particular recipe. Also seeing the Gourmet July, 2003 sour cherry recipe for a Cherry Balsamic sauce. I got a 1lb Swordfish steak, had the butcher slice it in half(long ways, making two thin steaks) I followed this recipe by oiling the steaks and salt and peppering them. I then made the sauce...I used one stick of butter, browned it, removed it from heat(same as this). I then whisked in 3 tblspoons of William Sonoma's Cherry Balsamic Vinegar, then whisked in 3tblspns of fresh SOUR cherry juice(you can use canned pitted SOUR cherries, they're sometimes used for pies) Then I added 1cup of pitted SOUR cherries(canned is o.k. if necessary) I then added a dash of brown sugar, salt, and black pepper. Stir it up and then let it stand while you cook the Swordfish. You know what do from here on out. I served it with some fresh steamed asparition(asparagus/broccoli hybrid) The light/moist meaty texture of the fish vs. the sour/sweet contrast of the cherries and sauce vs. the sweet/bitter contrast of the veggie is all together ORGASMIC! SINCERELY!!! TRY THIS LITTLE DITTY, You won't be disappointed. I apologize for using this space to tout a different recipe, but I did use most of this recipe's concept. Enjoy.

I love this recipe, it is so easy and has a great flavor. I use mahi instead of swordfish (both are great mahi is just a little less expensive). I do not use the capers or tomatoes. I serve the fish over mashed potatoes (the sauce serves as a great gravy).

Tasty and suuuuuper easy. Next time, however, I will definitely make half as much sauce for three swordfish steaks. As others said (and I didn't completely understand until tasting the dish), a little sauce goes a long way. It's overkill to use as much sauce as is called for in the recipe, methinks.

Rating: 4
This recipe is definately great and plates really fancy. I used honey dijon mustard instead of just honey and just dijon. Plated the swordfish on top of steamed spinach. Just make sure you drain the spinach well. I've made this quite a few times and have shared the recipe with people.

Came home with blue marlin and couldn't find a recipe on the web site, so...this was wonderful!!!Cut the sauce in half for two pieces of fish, garnished it with the tomatoes and capers. It both looked and tasted fantastic. Will make this again and again and again. For those cooks who are not as enamoured with balsamic as others, please note that not all balsamic vinegars are created equal (or really are balsamic vinegar). Many of the supermarket brands are a combination of ingredients with carmel coloring, not balsamic at all. The bottle must say balsamico de modena. It's hard to find anything half way decent for under 13 to 15 dollars and that is just the beginning. As it becomes more aged, it becomes better and better and more and more expensive. Told my husband that he could buy me a GOOD bottle for my birthday. For an incredible desert, mix 3 tbsp. sugar with two quarts of strawberries, let sit for half an hour, mix in 1/4 cup good balsmico. Spoon into goblets and give a twist of the peppermill over each serving. Marvelous combination of flavors and no one can guess what you've done, my favorite summertime dessert.

I also added a bit of garlic salt, for the flavor & to break up the sweetness from the honey. I will be making this dish often, especially the quick amount of time it took to prepare!

We tried this on a tip from one of the Constant Comment reviewers - and he (she?) was very right. It was so good on Saturday that we had it again on Sunday.

Wow, what a winner! Being out of honey I substituted equal parts molasses and Karo and for it and what a great flavor it gave the sauce. I used only 2 swordfish steaks and served up nearly all the sauce - I would probably double the sauce for 6 steaks. I also sauteed a large minced shallot and covered the swordfish with it before finishing with the sauce. My non-fish-eating husband gave it two thumbs up.

This was my first experience with Swordfish and the recipe was easy and the sauce was great!I could definitely see using the sauce on chicken or pork chops as well.

The whole family loved this sauce. Very delightful combination of butter and tang. I did reduce the butter by half as per the reviewers' recommendations. The cooking time for the swordfish needs to be watched closely. Mine was overdone. But that should be easily remedied next time around. Yummm!

The sauce is amazing- I also cut the butter in half and it came out perfect. I also used chilean sea bass instead of swordfish, and broiled it in an aluminum foil tent with some sliced shallots, salt, pepper and olive oil, and the fish was flaky and delicious. Possibly the best tasting fish dish I've ever prepared.

This was extremely easy to make and delicious. I think the key is not to overcook the swordfish. Our fish was very tender and I just followed the recipe.

Definitely a keeper. Easy and delicious. I reduced the butter by 1/2 as suggested by previous reviewers and it was perfect. Next time guests will be having this for dinner...again and again

Just got up from the table. Wonderful. I put it over shark and everyone loved it. I plan on using it for other than fish. We think it would go great on chicken breast or pork chops. Going to try it.

I also cut the butter - in half; thanks to the reviewers. I used it on Blue Marlin and, with that change, it was very quick, very easy, and very good. It's a great, tangy-sweet sauce.

The sauce was very good, easy to make and a great compliment to the swordfish. I did cut the butter in half, though.

I agree that it was a bit much butter, but overall a good recipie.

this sauce has a good flavor, but was much to oily for both my husband and me. if i made it again i would certainly cut back on the amount of butter, probably making it comparable with the amounts of honey and mustard.

Since I had never cooked swordfish before and a mixture of vinegar and honey sounded fairly strange, I was suprised at how much I liked this dish. The sauce was definitely different, but good. I think it will end up in my meal repertoire.

What a terrific sauce! I tried it with baked salmon - delicious. Gets rave reviews every time I make it.

This was the very first fish recipe I have made, and it wasn't difficult at all. It didn't take a long time to prepare either. I made it on a weeknight after work. And the best part was that it tasted really good too. My husband said "Don't lose this recipe." This was the first epicurous recipe I have tried, and now I can't wait to try more.

This sauce was excellent. I used it on grilled yellowfin tuna instead of swordfish. I think it would also be good on brussel sprouts!

This recipe is easy and wonderful. I made it with rare tuna and served the tuna sliced over shredded sauted cabbage. Use the tomatoes, they make a nice presentation.

Great recipe. Very easy and quick. Made it for the first time for last minute guests and we all loved it. Sauce would be great over most fish.
