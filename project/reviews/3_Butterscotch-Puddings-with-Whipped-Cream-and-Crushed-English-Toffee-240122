I had some trouble with cooking this pudding. I think the cornstarch should have been dissolved with the sugar and brought to a boil before whisking into the egg yolks. The cornstarch started thickening immediately when I added it, and it was hard to prevent/smooth out lumps. It did taste a little like undercooked cornstarch, but I was afraid to cook it any longer for fear of the egg yolks curdling. It was also a little sweet for my taste, but the overall flavor was good. I used butterscotch scnapps instead of scotch, which tasted great!

Half of our group liked this pudding. One person, however, said, "I like most foods except THAT pudding, Indian food and liver." All agreed that it wasn't exactly that classic butterscotch flavor. Instead, we called it Scotch Pudding.

Wow. I don't know why so many people didn't like this. Worked out perfectly and tasted fantastic. Fancy, but homey Gotta like that.

This was very disappointing, lacking flavor and too thick. Jello brand butterscotch pudding is better than this.

I tried this recipe and found the flavor lacking and the texture pasty. But I love the idea of Skor/Heath Bars bashed up on top, and try chocolate whipped cream instead of vanilla. (But use a different pudding recipe.)

Though the consistency of the pudding was creamy, the flavour was very bland. Don't bother.
