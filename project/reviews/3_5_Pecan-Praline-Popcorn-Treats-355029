I decided to whip this up because I made popcorn in a pan for the first time and didn't relize how much I was making. The sugar took a very long time to get to the melting stage. I had it more on med-high and it still took close to half and hour. Once all the ingredients are in and it's time for the popcorn, you have to work quick. It's very sticky. I'm nost sure how clean-up is going to be because I haven't got to that stage yet. It tastes great though.
