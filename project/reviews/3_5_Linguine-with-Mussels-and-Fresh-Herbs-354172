If you dislike fennel/anise, you probably won't like the fennel seeds in this dish. I personally loved having that flavor because it was so unexpected and played really well with the red pepper flakes, mussels, and herbs. My husband preferred the Mussels alla Diavola on the site, but conceded that the mussels got lost in that dish and stood out more in this one. Easy to make, and one I'll be revisiting in the future.

Great recipe. I added parsley and basil, used a nice Sauvignon Blanc, shelled the mussels over the pasta, added the parmesan cheese, and voila, a great quick supper. Would definitely make it again for guests.

SO easy and so quick. I halved the recipe for just my husband and myself, used fresh basil/oregano/flat leaf parsley (I think dill would be too overwhelming) and PEI mussels. Followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. (And cost less than $5/person!)I don't know why you would skip the fennel; it's very subtle but adds depth to the flavor. This is a good summer seasonal dinner with the fresh herbs.

I skipped the fennel, and found this to be very good! For herbs I used equal parts of dill, flat leaf parsley and chives. I wasn't sure about the chives, but I had them on hand, and it turned out well. The dill may be overpowering for some tastes in a 1/3 ratio. Another thing to note - if you're not a fan of peppery bite, I would cut down on the red pepper and the black pepper added to the mussel broth. All in all - a wonderful and easy dish!

I agree with others who posted that this recipe is just okay. I did not like the fennel as that took the recipe in a direction I didn't like.

This recipe was delicious and so easy! I omitted the fennel because neither my husband nor I like it. The pepper flakes were just the right amount of heat and the fresh herbs really gave it a boost (I used parsley and oregano - perfect!). I also used spinach fettucini to add more color and nutrition. I would probably leave out the parmesan next time - I don't think it needs it! But make sure you have lots of crusty bread to sop up the sauce. This will go in my rotation for sure!

I though this was awful! I am suprised that so many people love this recipe. Maybe I didn't have the greatest mussels, but i've tried it twice and both times I think we ended up ordering pizza for dinner because this hit the trash. Not sure what I'm doing wrong, if I am but I am done with this recipe.

So easy and tasty. I actually made it with shrimp instead of mussels, just for ease of the weekly shopping trip. I was afraid I was going to mess it up since I wasn't watching the "broth" very well nor did I measure anything out, but it still turned out great. A fool proof recipe is always good for me.

Very good, very easy. I've had similar dishes in restaurants, and this was just as good...but at home! We had mussels left over so I made the same dish without the pasta as an appetizer for the next night. Super.

This was awesome! My husband is very PICKY and he LOVED IT! He raved about this dish for awhile. It did take us back to the coast of Italy.

I've never commented on any recipe from Gourmet before, but I had to this time. I'm sorry, can't agree that this was a good recipe. Perhaps it was the mussels I purchased and cleaned, but the broth was too salty to even taste the herbs. I believe there's too much salt added to the recipe, especially since parmesan cheese is added at the end. The sauce was much thicker than I thought it would be, so I added more pasta water as recommended. Still, too thick. I've made much better mussel/pasta recipes from Gourmet and other sources.

Great recipe! I had never made or eaten mussels before, but thought I would try it. Followed recipe exactly except I added more hot pepper flakes to kick it up a bit. Very easy and tasty, but it makes a ton! Could probably halve recipe if you are making it for just one or two people.
