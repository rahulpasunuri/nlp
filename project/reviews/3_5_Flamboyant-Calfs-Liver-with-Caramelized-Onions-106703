Oh my gosh,so very good! I love the sherry vinegar with the sweet onions. I did soak the liver in milk while cooking the bacon and onions,which makes it taste more mild.

Loved it! I'll admit to a couple of changes: I used dry sherry instead of sherry vinegar, I used olive oil instead of butter, and used turkey "bacon" rather than a pork product. Next time, I'd like to try the "bacon" in smaller pieces stirred into the onions rather than sprinkled on top. The sherry-liver combination is a new treat and I'll make this again.

always loved this recipe

This is an excellent recipe, I doubled the sauce and added 1 tablespoon of flour to give it a gravy like substance. I served it as an appetizer with a sliced fresh baguette for dipping in the sauce. Everyone loved it and have made it serval times.

New take on a traditional southern meal. Very good.
