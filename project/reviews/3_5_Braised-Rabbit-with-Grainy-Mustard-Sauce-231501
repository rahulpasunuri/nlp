Delicious. Though the taste of the rabbit doesn't differentiate from chicken enough to justify the $60 price tag for 2 rabbits. I will use whole chicken because the flavor doesn't out weigh the cost.

My husband and I really liked this recipe. I made several changes to it; chicken instead of rabbit and more broth/less wine. The only seasonings in it were garlic and seasoned black pepper. It was wonderful.

I'm planning on making this as soon as I can track down some rabbit, but I wanted to respond to an earlier question about the taste of rabbit. It's kind of difficult to describe what something tastes like; people liken it to chicken, but I think the only resemblance is that they both have a mild flavor (talking farm-raised rabbit, which is what one would find in a grocery store). Give it a shot - you'll more than likely enjoy it. This looks to be an outstanding recipe.

Preparing this recipe made the kitchen smell amazing. I hadn't made rabbit before, so I didn't know what to expect. The braising makes its tougher, gamier meat quite delicious. The onions mixed with the wine and mustard have a very German smell and flavor. My only concern was that the onions and sauce overpower any subtleties in the meat. The braising sauce was nowhere near 3-1/4 cups before I reduced it. It was probably closer to 1 1/2 cups. I omitted the cornstarch and reduced the pan sauces with mustard and butter for richness. I'd make this with chicken legs and thighs, too.

I liked the sauce of this recipe, but admittedly I'm not a huge rabbit fan. My husband throughly enjoyed it so I might do this again with chicken.

Magnifique. Followed the recipe to the letter but took others' example and thickened the sauce purely by reducing it--no gooey cornstarch needed. Wanting a silky texture, I strained all those onion bits out before the final reduction. Also left out the butter enrichment. On a rainy winter night I served the lapin with haricots verts and potatoes mashed with creme fraiche followed by a pear tarte tatin.

This recipe is wonderfully homey and wistfully French - can't wait to actually make it with rabbit which I can't seem to get here. I half the recipe and serve with the French Lentils with Carrots and Pearl Onions. Serve with a French Burgundy - sublime.

Very nice and very, very easy. It halved easily, too. I would pair it with a nice nut brown ale.

OMG, AMAZING! On my first attempt, I followed the recipe to the word, but since then have used chicken thighs and love to throw in some root veggies for the last 45 minutes of braising. It has an incredibly complex yet delicate taste and after a few attempts has become old hat. Subbing is easy, I once went with tarragon instead of thyme and an IPA instead of wine and it was still divine. Such a keeper.

Would someone please describe the flavor of rabbit? I'm trying to decide if I want to make it with rabbit or not. I am quite curious, but still trying to get used to the gamier meats. Thanks! :)

What a great recipe! This reminded me of the Frugal Gourmet's recipe for rabbit with leeks. I did not have rabbit, used a whole chicken cut into pieces and skinned. I was nervous about the skinning, but not to worry. Meat was moist and sauce was delicious. As suggested by previous reviewers, I skipped the cornstarch (sauce was thick enough) and added 1/4 cup heavy cream at the end. Though I used the 3 T. butter at the end, I could have easily skipped it--great dish.

So delicious! The meat is juicy and the mustard sauce is wonderful. This is a nice technique to apply to chicken if you are not feeling as adventurous. I've made this three times and although it seems involved at first becomes pretty easy after a few attempts.

First time cooking rabbit and this came out great. Followed the recipe closely, but added button mushrooms as onions were softening. The meat was flavorful and tender, and the sauce rich and intensely flavored. Agree this recipe would work well with chicken.

I forgot to say that I didn't add the butter at the end, I just forgot. It was still very rich tasting.

Wow! I halved the recipe (only one rabbit) but used the full amount of garlic. I didn't thicken the sauce, just reduced as other cooks have suggested. Just delicious. I served it with red potatoes, roasted tomatoes and braised fennel (saute fennel in butter until it's golden, add white wine and simmer until the fennel is tender. Add a bit of cream or half and half). Find a 4-H club near you and get some local rabbit!

Fantastic! I made this on sunday and feed 8 friends , I bought the rabbit from a local farmer at the Swan Creek Farm, and it was beautiful, The meat just falls of the bone. I added some more herbs, leek, carrot and celery. Agreed with a previous reviewer that you don't need the cornstarch. I omitted it and just reduced the sauce with butter, served with braised swiss chard and truffled risotto. Everyone loved the dish, I can't wait to make this again.

I cut the recipe in half, added some mushrooms with the onions and garlic, omitted the butter and it was delicious. A keeper for sure. Wendi from AZ, get a clue. Ask your butcher to cut the rabbit in pieces.

Have made this recipe several times, as part of the Gourmet featured menu, with the lentil dish as an accompaniment. I've done all rabbit, all chicken and mixed, all with great results.

This was very good-exactly as written. I don't understand some people's objections to eating rabbit; it's a strangely American hypocrisy. Rabbit is extremely low in fat and I have found it easy to obtain organic rabbit without all the garbage they pump into battery hens. Do you not eat pork because of Wilber (Charlotte's Web) or Elsie the Cow? They were pretty cute, too.

There is very little I would do to this recipe to improve it. Having said that let me offer the following suggestions. At the very end of the process I would not add the butter, the addition of a little heavy cream would make it smoother. At the very end omit the thickening agent, reducing the sauce is enough, remember it is sauce not gravy. The choice of wine used in the cooking is not very important as long as it is of good quality and is not dominant. This is a very inexpensive and very tasty way of cooking rabbit.

Served with a fresh pasta and some sauteed mustard greens. The rabbit was cooked to perfection and the sauce was excellent. Served with an Australian Grenache blend - matched the food wonderfully.

I enjoy rabbit for dinner almost four times a month and I have 2 or 3 recipes with mustard; this one is definitely the BEST. Just follow the recipe religiously and you will be rewarded with a dish beyond compare. DO NOT change this for that or add anything else, just stick to the recipe. I am so often surprised by all the modifications some cooks can bring... they must end up with a completely different recipe ??? Suggestion: serve with steamed brussels sprouts and chestnuts.

As a follow up to my previous review, my husband took the left-over rabbit, boned it and mixed it with some cream of mushroom soup (leaving out the left-over sauce from the night before), onions, garlic and left-over asparagus. He served that over spicy rice ... that was a keeper!

This was too much work (cutting the rabbits up was painful for my tired old hands) and my family thought the mustard was overpowering. I would not make this again. Lentils? Where were the Lentils in this recipe? :-)

Lentils? What is previous reviewer talking about?

This was delicious -- and Yes -- I made it with rabbit. I used my convection oven to try to "rush" the process a bit because I was running late, but it was still grea. Next time I will cook slower and longer so it falls off the bone more tenderly. I would definitely make again...even for company.

Thought this sounded good as written but WRONG!! UCK - used chicken instead of rabbit. Cooked as directed and meat was dry, sauce was not very tasty. Lentils were even questionable. Would not recommend.

I made this with chicken and it was great. My husband had it for breakfast the morning after, he liked it so much.
