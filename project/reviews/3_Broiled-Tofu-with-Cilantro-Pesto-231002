Good recipe, but as others have said, the sauce needs a little kick to push it from meh to tasty. Here are the modifications I made: Double the amount of cilantro you use. Heavy on the lime juice Toast the pine nuts first Skip the sugar 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes for a little kick and 1-2 cloves of minced garlic thrown in Salt can be added to taste. I don't like pepper, so I skipped it. Turned out so delicious that I made extra to store in the fridge and use as a condiment.

I made this today and the pesto turned out really not good, too strong, as if all the ingredients were out of balance (way too much cilantro). will not be making again.

Just wonderful...and to San Diego, do not remove leaves from stems....they have tons of flavor!

The cilantro pesto takes quite a bit of work--even 2 huge bunches (cleaned, leaves removed) only produces a small amount of pesto. The pesto needs a little something. I added hoisin in place of the fish sauce since I'm vegetarian. The broiled tofu was really easy and delicious, but the tofu+pesto combo definitely needed soy sauce. Delicious with rice and a salad! Not fantastic/amazing, but pretty good for sure.

I added extra lime and extra pine nuts, which I roasted. I omitted the soy sauce and sugar and added a clove of garlic (even though I split the recipe in half). Instead of broiling I just pan fried in a little olive oil and then put the tofu and pesto on top of a salad. This recipe is quick and very easy; it's a keeper.

Good. Needs a few minor tweaks, less sesame oil, salt to taste, more lime juice and nuts. I also recommend the addition of a garlic clove. Enjoy!

This was very simple, healthy, and pretty tasty. I addded more lime juice to the pesto than what the recipe called for and didn't use as much sugar. The pesto was missing something, so I blended in a clove of garlic, and that seemed to do the trick. I oiled the broiling pan, but the tofu still stuck to it. I advise flipping the tofu after 10 minutes of broiling to get the tofu crispy on both side, but I don't know what to do to prevent sticking. Will happily make again.

I have been making this Cilantro Pesto at least 5-6 times a year since it came out in the 2004 Gourmet issue. Not only do I love it with the fried tofu - but it is also an excellent topping for baked/fried/broiled/bbq'd fish! and my kids can't get enough of it!

The broiled tofu was nice and crunchy, but I will flip them next time to make them crunchy on both sides. The cilantro pesto was excellent.

The cilantro pesto was tasty, but broiling the tofu plain like that made it tough & chewy on the outside and rubbery inside. Blech!

Great way to firm tofu quickly. Pesto was a bit salty; next time I'll hold off on the salt and soy sauce until tasting.

Great recipe! Easy and delicious with tofu, pasta, chicken or fish. I'm making it again tonight!

We made the pesto with pasta instead and it was yummy.

It's a good way to do something different with tofu. The pesto and the cooking technique were a great help. The instructions say you can do the pesto in advance, but it's much better if it's been chopped recently. As with a lot of tofu recipes for USA palates, you are balancing texture with bland taste,...

Loved it! I also use the pesto on grilled chicken & any grilled white fish such as Grouper or Tilapia. I always double the pesto recipe. Yummy!

I doubled the pinenuts and lime juice, skimped a bit on the sugar, and halved the olive oil. Also, I did use the specified amount of fish sauce, but added few dashes of tamari, which seemed to temper the fish sauce a bit. I thought this was excellent. Shared it with two women at work who also loved it. Pesto was better the second day.

I hate to say this, but after 18 years of following Gourmet I've finally found a dud recipe. It may have been my asian fish sauce, but the cilantro pesto was awful and I'd never make it again. The broiled tofu was nice and I'll probably cook tofu that way again, but I'll use a peanut sauce instead.
