Love this one! We make it often with mixed greens as a salad main dish (with hummus & tapenade on the side in addition to the yogurt biz). We add feta and olives to sort of "meat it up" and it's tasty, hearty, and perfect for when vegetarian friends come to visit.

A lot of effort for a below average result. I followed the recipe exactly, bought all the many ingredients, and was extremely disappointed with the result, and the waste of time! Rather go for a good Baba Ganoush recipe instead.

Quite spicy, yet satisfying as a lunch. Didn't have the roasted peppers and used chopped red peppers instead of the greeen that were specified and it came out fine. I used grilled chinese eggplant, and did not have to press any liquid out of the flesh.

This recipe required a lot of work, but it was worth it. The combination was delicious. It is a nice summer appetizer. When I make it again, I would replace the green pepper with a red or yellow pepper. A cook in Huntington Woods, MI

This salad takes a bit of effort, what with making the pita chips and yoghurt sauce. But it is worth every moment spent preparing it. Completely delicious, fresh and morish. It looks lovely too with the red, green and yellow. I recommend it highly!

A bit of work and not worth it. It was okay, but the flavrs just didn't quite fit. I followed the recipe exactly.
