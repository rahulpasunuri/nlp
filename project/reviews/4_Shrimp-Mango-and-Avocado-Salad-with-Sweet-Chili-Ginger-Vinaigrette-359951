Delicious! It reminded us of the Shrimp Mango Summer Rolls, also on this site. Try them! You won't be disappointed. Next time, I will do as other reviewers suggested and reduce the chili sauce and increase the vinegar. I may also add some cucumber. This would be a great starter for a summer dinner on the deck. Serve it with a chilled Sauvignon Blanc! Yummo!

I made this for one, as I live by myself, but this was simply the most amazing salad I have ever had in my life!

This is delicious! Like other reviewers, I added more rice vinegar and a little less sweet chili sauce. Otherwise it's a little too thick. I also added cilantro! Definitely use fresh shrimp, it's worth the extra money! This will be going into my summer lineup!

Only thing I did different was to cook/saute the shrimp myself after tossing it with some Thai seasoning I got from a BBQ store. Big hit all around.

Yummy, quick recipe. Cut the dressing in half (often find some of the salad dressings to be too heavy). Second time around added some fresh cilantro. An improvement on an already great recipe.

After reading some of the other reviews I'm curious as to which kind of chili sauce they used. I found Asian sweet chili sauce in my local Safeway. The Dressing alone would get 4 forks. I made extra & we ate it on salads for the next few days. My husband asked for this salad again less that a week later. The salad was unexceptional. I find butter lettuce to be bitter, but I used it to follow the recipe. You must use fresh, not frozen shrimp, it makes a world of difference. Also you want an avocado that is ripe but still firm. I'll try it with chicken & some other lettuce next.

It has been incredibly hot, so this was the perfect dinner salad. I read the other reviews so altered the vinaigrette slightly by doubling the rice vinegar and adding a bit more ginger. Since I was making this for a main dish, I also doubled the shrimp. I thought it was tasty and light with a little bit of spicy/sweet going on. I will make it again and again.

Good, but too sweet for my taste. The amount of salt necessary to balance the sugar of the sweet chili sauce and mango made it more of a desert than a salad, at least for me.

This was a tasy recipe. I suggest using Yeo's Chili Sauce Sweet...for a bolder sweet chili sauce. I also have a toddler and he loved these rolled up into a wrap he could hold.

I agree with the reviewer who substituted the salad dressing from the Firecracker Spinach Salad with Orange Sesame Dressing. It made the salad

The most delicious salad. I've made this multiple times.

I really enjoyed this dish. However the sweet chili sauce was so sweet that I don't think it needs the mango. That just sweetened it even more. I added some onion and lime juice to the dressing and my family really enjoyed it.

This was an excellent combination of flavors. Based on other reviewers I actually opted for a Tangerine Lime dressing I had handy and I had to substitute clementines for the mango because mine wasn't ripe. Iknow that changes it but it was great and my partner would have been quite content if that was all we had for dinner -- note self, hmm should make that for a summer dinner.

Impeccable salad. Quick and easy. Great to get the palate traveling to Asia. I cut the salad small and make sure the avocado and mango are firm yet ripe to have the presentation be perfect. I usually combine this salad with a Miso or Teriyaki type fish and home made green tea ice cream (with Matcha powder).

Really tasty dressing but I liked the salad better with chicken than with shrimp.

Okay, so I did what you are not supposed to do and I changed the dressing. I have an acute aversion to sweet chili sauce after too many potluck Philly Sweet Chilli Dip experiences. So I changed the dressing and used the orange sesame dressing posted here: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Firecracker-Spinach-Salad-with-Orange-Sesame-Dressing-235683 Anyway, the salad was awesome! It worked perfectly. I'm sure the sweet chilli dressing is also awesome if you don't have psychological issues over the main ingredient.

Really liked this salad, already had it twice this week, once with shrimp and once with chicken. I added the juice from a lime to the dressing (thought it needed a little more acid) and sprinkled some crushed peanuts on top. I think the amount of dressing made is more then is really needed, but I like my salads lightly dressed.

This was very tasty. I sautéed the shrimp in sesame oil. I also used apple cider vinegar because my grocery store didn't have rice vinegar (I know, I should keep some on hand). But it was good nonetheless, and also very easy!

Quick, easy, and can be served as a main meal. Did I mention it's really good too?

We are in the dinner salad phase of our lives, and have tried quite a few different ones. This is one that I personally liked a lot, but be somewhat aware of the heat of the dressing. A little goes quite a ways. It is different and delicious

We eat a lot of dinner type salads in the summer, as we are at the salad eating stage of our lives. Found this to be different and very tasty, but the dressing should be metered on carefully, as it is quietly warming. Overall, it was very good, one of the best we've had using a spicy dressing.

Amazing recipe! I intended to steam the shrimp, when the power went out in my neighborhood. I fired up the grill (charcoal) and tossed the shrimp with a little olive oil and McCormick's steak seasoning. The grilled shrimp combined with the other flavors was incredible. I made some Spanish-style rice for my husband to have with his shrimp, as he wasn't sure about eating salad. Envy got the better of him, and he did take all the other fixings, and simply referred to them as "sides". I would totally order this dish at a restaurant - so danged good!!

This simple salad is perfect for a weeknight. It's quickly hit our rotation and will be here for a while. I used Nam Ploy sweet chili sauce, which is actually a staple in my house.

This salad was good, but be warned, it's fairly spicy. It was too spicy for me and my husband. Maybe it was just the chili sauce I used, it was "Maggi Taste of Asia Mild Sweet Chili Sauce". You would think the "mild" wouldn't be too much, but it was. I would make this salad again, but would use something else for the dressing.
