This recipe has been in rotation in my kitchen ever since I first tried it when I saw it in Gourmet in 1992. A simple, hearty comfort dish that is really worth trying and good enough to serve to company. A great pot-luck offering too.

great way to feed a meat eater cooked greens. quick enough for a weeknight, great for garden greens. added a handful each of fresh basil and parsley.

OK, not amazing. I added cherry tomatoes as suggested by another user which helped, but this was pretty boring. I added the directed amount of pepper flakes but found it too spicy (and I like very spicy stuff normally). If I did this again I'd use sausage instead of the bacon.

This is Good! I made it with spicy Italian sausage and I would recommend it!

I never thought I could get my husband to like collards, but this recipe was great. Substituted 3 links of spicy Italian sausage for the bacon and added mushrooms and halved cherry tomatoes. I made extra rotini to feed my kids, so I did not boil the pasta in the collard water. Will definitely make this again while the CSA continues to send greens.

This was a very good dish--good combination of flavors. We used a vidalia onion for its sweetness, smoked-peppered bacon, and collards straight from our garden. I cut a "large bunch" (not sure if it was 1 lb, as recipe calls for) but we still could've used more to balance out the dish. The garlic and red pepper flake add a nice little kick. Relatively easy to make, maybe 30 min prep time. Would def. make this again! My wife really liked this one too

This recipe is delicious and simple. A great way to get your greens. I would definitely double all ingredients and use half the amount of pasta for all over good flavor combination. Otherwise there is too much pasta and not enough of the other stuff. My kids love it too.

Pretty tasty, but I changed some things up a bit. I, too, added a bit more crushed pepper and swapped collards for swiss chard that we received from our CSA box. I also swapped the bacon for mild Italian sausage. Good flavors - I think the sweetness of the onions really make this dish.

I followed the recipe almost exactly, and it was such a nice treat for a regular weeknight. The ingredients were perfectly balanced yet each came through clearly. I used good quality olive oil & parmesan, whole wheat fusilli and a collards/spinach/turnip greens mixture. Definitely dinner party material.

Really good. I made it with whole wheat rotini because linguine irritates me (dont like the texture) but other than that, followed the recipe and loved it.Super quick and easy.

EZ & delicious recipe! I sub pancetta for bacon, whole-grain linguine for fusilli & oh yeah, Swiss chard for the collards. But it was still terrific! LOL!

I wouldn't call it healthy since it's using bacon and bacon grease. Made it according to the recipe and was a great weeknight meal. I suggest using a bit more crushed red pepper.

I've been making this dish since I originally saw the recipe back in 1992. It is fantastic! I recommend making the original recipe before trying to add tomatoes or turkey bacon, etc. This has been a favorite for family, friends, and company.

I made this recipe vegetarian, using tempeh bacon. It was pretty good. I also added some tomato, vegetable broth, and turnip greens. Not sure how much they changed the dish, but I had them, so I added them. I've made this with kale as well, though without the boiling of the greens, and that was also quite nice. Would make again.

I made this dish to use fresh collards from my garden. As others recommended, I used more collards, up to 3 lbs. I also used up to 1/2 lbs. of turkey bacon, up to 1 t. dried hot red pepper, only 2 T. olive oil and substituted linguine for the fusilli. I also added 1 lb. cherry tomatoes, quartered. A good, healthy dish.

this was great, we aren't particularly fond of greens so were looking for a nice way to use them and this is definately it. didn't change a thing

I was looking for something interesting and fairly healthy to do with some collard greens, and thought I'd try this. Were we ever disappointed! I added extra bacon, and went easy on the pepper flakes (thought the kids would eat it), but basically it was greasy and flavorless. Won't make this one again. A waste of good bacon.

Such an easy way to get your greens! It sounded weird at first, but it's a great quick dinner; we've made it with kale and swiss chard, too. My husband, who's often bored with traditional tomato-based pasta sauces, loves it.

I guess you can say I destroyed this recipe. The thought of no tomatos did not appeal to me. I did not use bacon. I cooked the collards as directed. I then cooked the onion and garlic, added the cooked collards to the mixture, a can of whole tomatos which I quartered, the red pepper and a cup of the cooking liquid. I cooked it until most of the liquid was gone. Maybe not as good as the original, but very tasty!

This dish is packed with flavor and everybody at the table wanted seconds. I'm from Alabama and cook for someone from Italy, so this recipe is the perfect blend of both our cultural foods. The most time consuming aspect of preparation was cleaning/snipping the collards, so this entree is actually simple to prepare. Buon Apetito!

After reading all these glowing reviews, I am beginning to think that I did something wrong! This was a basic pasta dish-easy to prepare but nothing spectacular.

This is really good, very quick and easy! I also substituted kale for the collard greens -- wilted it in the bacon drippings instead of boiling. Also added a little more vinegar and hot pepper flakes for more of a kick.

This recipe is fantastic. Simple, packed with flavor, and light enough to allow for other courses. I've made this with collards, kale, turnip greens, and chard, and they all turned out fantastic. I've also substituted the bacon with salt beef to add some Newfoundland flair!

Excellent! I replaced the red-wine vinegar with raspberry vinegar, which gave the dish a nice flavor. I also added some white whine and cream to make a richer sauce.

EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!! Very good way to get some greens into your diet because prepared this way, it tastes great! Use good bacon (with as little fat on it as possible), and use good olive oil. Also - try the very pretty campanelle pasta.

Fantastic! Very flavorful. My husband loved it and suggested that maybe some shrimp added would make it even better.

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe. It's great! I didn't have enough fresh collard greens so I added some fresh beet greens and it was very good. I also carmelized the onions and substituted turkey "bacon." It was excellent. I'll definitely make it again.

Very quick & easy. I found frozen collard greens at the grocery store. Fresh would have been better, but the frozen saved time. I also substituted 1/4 lb of turkey ham because I don't like cooking with bacon. Next time, I'll probably go heavy on the red pepper flakes. It could have been a little hotter.

A great way to incorporate collard greens in your diet. The latest scientific research says that collard greens may prevent macular degeneration. So, not only good for you but a tasty main course as well.

This is an absolute keeper. I used fresh spinach and threw in a couple of seeded and diced tomatoes too. It was very, very good with a salad and some garlic bread.

My husband winced he heard the description of this dish, but we all LOVED it! Even our 7 yr old devoured it - we had no leftovers. I used a non-stick frying pan and cut down on the oil, Additionally, I sliced the onions a bit more thickly and caramelized them slightly. The sweetness was a luscious contrast to the vinegary greens and salty bacon. Delicious meal!

This dish is wonderful! My mother in-law has been making it for years and often substitutes the collards with spinach; it makes a nice alternative when the collards are unavailable. This recipe is so, so tasty and all of the kids request it each time we get together. It goes a long way and is great left-over.
