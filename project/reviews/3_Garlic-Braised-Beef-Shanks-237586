Oh my goodness this recipe is heaven on earth! For all of you that have ammended the recipe to make it simpler, please don't, it is really simple and the end result is amazing. I'm not sure that beef shanks is the same cut in America as it is in England as the beef shank (shin with bone in) we get in the UK is much larger than what is described in this recipe but based on that the only modifications I made was that I doubled the amount of water added as my shank was 10ins thick including bone and the fresh thyme in my garden was out of season so I used 1tbsp dried thyme. I have cooked this dish for a dinner party and everyone wanted the recipe, it was so simple to cook and so impressive, this is now a regular on our dinner table. Just don't mess with the recipe, give it time and enjoy. Thanks very much for a wonderful dish.

This is great stuff....I didn't do all the steps...but I did braised it in the oven with all of the components...for probably 4 hours....I didn't bother to make the sauce the juices were fantastic as they were.

For the same amount of work, osso bucco is a better recipe. Also, is anyone concerned about mad cow when using beef marrow?

I would not make this recipe again. I made a few changes, and followed some suggestions of other reviewers. Although it made a wonderful sauce, which was delicious over risotto; the meat itself was too rich for my tastes. I found it a bit gamey.

I used this recipe mainly as a guide to ingredients. I took some shortcuts to simplify the preparation and scaled it down to serve two. My wife and I were very pleased with the results. Browned the shanks in a Le Creuset dutch oven, removed them from the pot, deglazed with two cups of beef bouillon, then returned the shanks to the same pot for braising. Two shanks just fit nicely in 5.5 quart dutch oven. The two cups of bouillon just covered the shanks. I added about eight cloves of peeled garlic, one medium to large onion sliced, about a tablespoon of dried thyme, a few bay leaves, and the zest of one lemon coarsely grated. (Skipped the carrots and celery.) Cooked at 275F for 2-1/2 hours with lid on. Added a medium potato halved lengthwise and cut into one inch sections. Cooked for another 45 minutes with lid on. Using a slotted spoon I removed everything but the liquid from the pot, skimmed off the fat, added a splash of red wine and then simmered and stirred the liquid briefly to make about 1/2 cup of sauce. We served the shanks with steamed broccoli tossed with a vinaigrette dressing. I think the lemon zest is a key ingredient. Without being a distinct flavor at the end, it seems to brighten the overall effect and makes the dish very savory.

I liked this but didn't love it. I used the slow cooker to braise and my shanks fell apart. I then had to pick them apart further to get the big fat strips out. There wasn't nearly enough garlic to make it taste like roasted garlic. It was very greasy, probably not aided by my addition of some extra bones. I prefer using beef shanks to make ragu, I think.

We get one shank/year as we order from local Oregon family who ranches 120 mi. from town. They raise the best organic beef around, in accordance with Michael Pollan's criterea put forth in The Omnivorse's Dilemma. I instantly liked this recepie b/c it uses 4 heads of garlic, and herbs that I grow in my garden year round. I did substitute California bay for traditional Greek bay even though there is both in my yard, as I find the former to be too pungent for my and my family's tastes. Even with that change, this didn't appeal to my 8 year old son's palate. He does have an adventuresome one; he'll demand octopus and salmon roe when dining in a Japanese restaraunt. This dish is quite rich, even with most of the fat removed, according to the recipie's directions. I took the liberty, when pouring the excess pan juices in the skillet after the meat and vegetables were done, to thicken the sauce with arrowroot, and with good results. Still, I doubt that I'll make this one again, what with so many more flavourful recipies for beef shank. Next year, I'll try a spicy Korean one I found online during this year's search. At any rate, thanks to the person who posted this recipie; I love sharing info, too.

Very good! I didn't follow the recipe exactly (grilled the shanks instead of browning because we happened to be grilling), no parchment, reheated the sauce on the stove after fishing out the meat, cutting it up and then adding it back in to just warm through (cut down on the work some). Served with crusty French bread to sop up the gravy. Will definitely make again.

A few thongs the recipe doesn't tell you: don't sear the shanks in a non-stick skillet. The carmelized "brown bits" will have nothing to stick to and the dish will lack flavor. Also, the addition of two or three more marrow bones to the pot make everything more delicious. The extra marrow can be added to the sauce. Also, I get better results by lightly zesting a larger lemon with a microplane, thereby getting about two tablespoons of zest for the pot. Also, as are all braises, this dish gets een better the more time it stays in the fridge. (But do finish it within five days of cooking).

Excellent recipe. Hello, to the person from Spokane who can spot a turkey leg--but cannot write "a lot" which is actually two words--correctly.

I think if you look at the Turkey Ossobuco picture from the same list of Braised Meat recipes, you can figure out what happened. They both sound so good, will have to make them both and report back.

Please don't steer away from trying this recipe because of the comment about the picture. This dish is very, very good. Think you'll really enjoy making (and eating) this meal.
