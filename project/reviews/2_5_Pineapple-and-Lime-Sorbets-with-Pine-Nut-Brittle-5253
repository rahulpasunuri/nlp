I didn't use this recipe - would like to propose one of my own for the pineapple, though. Cut up a medium ripe pineapple. Juice and zest 3 limes. Reduce 4 cups of pineapple juice and 1/2 c sugar to 3 cups of liquid over medium heat (sugar must dissolve completely). Add minced zest of 2 limes and several mint leaves. Add a large pinch of salt. Blitz in a vitaprep or take several passes through a blender until as finely pureed as possible. Chill. Freeze according to ice cream maker's directions.

I made the pineapple sorbet and found it had only a weak pineapple flavor. I wonder if it would be improved by replacing the one cup of water with more pineapple juice instead.

I really liked the lime sorbet, found it refreshing and easy to make. But I wasn't crazy about the pineapple one, which I would only give one fork. (I didn't make the brittle.)
