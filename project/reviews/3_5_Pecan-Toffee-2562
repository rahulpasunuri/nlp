Delicious recipe!!! I've made this every year for Christmas, for the past three years, with these changes: *Use 2C chopped pecans - 1C finely chopped for body, 1C for top *Add 1/4C corn syrup with the sugar and cream of tartar *when temp gets to 310', add 1C finely chopped pecans and stir in *when temp returns to 300' remove from heat and stir in 1/2t baking soda, then pour into a 9x13 pan that's been lined with foil and sprayed(not the 9" pan - gets too thick) *mini or regular size semisweet choc chips work great for top.

This was a "test" recipe for my old one that's been misplaced, and it turned out great. Will probably melt chocolate and paraffin (like for hand-dipping) and cover top of toffee with that, so chocolate won't melt if the candy is sitting in a warm room. Easy, easy recipe to make.

To answer the previous question - check out the recipe at the site below. It states: "Stirring constantly between 236F. & 290F. prevents butter from separating. No good if this happens." Maybe that is what happened to you. http://www.ichef.com/recipe.cfm/smocid/12/recipe/Toffee/itemid/75660/task/display/recipeid/75323/recipecategoryid/39

I had a similar experience as the cook from Arlington, MA on 11/14/03. I was making it for Christmas gifts, but I ended up throwing it away only to began again. This time I used Margerine and it turned out perfect. What could be the reason? It also happened to my daughter when she used butter. Is it the Butter?? I have a Toffee recipe I have used for 25 years. That recipe calls for 1 cup margarine, 1 cup of sugar and NO cream of tartar. Otherwise, it is exactly the same and is also very good. I would appreciate any feedback from others who have tried this recipe.

Just what i was looking for. I added 1/4 cup corn syrup, added pecans at 310 degrees, and when the temperature returned to about 300 degrees, take off the heat, add 1/2 tsp baking soda and stir, then pour onto a baking sheet.

I'm sure I must have done something wrong; the sugar and butter appear to have separated, leaving an unpleasantly greasy result. The nuts are in a rock-hard sugar crust, surrounded by a sea of oil. I could see it separating as it cooked, and while I would have had an idea what to do if it were chocolate, I lack experience with toffees. This is the only recipe I've used with cream of tartar...could that have made a difference? I'd be interested to hear from someone who knows what went wrong...

This was fabulous!!! I barely made it to work becaue I kept sneaking into the tin while I was stuck in traffic. My co-workers gobbled it up before lunch. Easy to make and fun to eat. This recipe's a keeper.

This is fast and easy. I used slivered, toasted almonds, as I had made two other pecan deserts...yum. I made mine in an 8x8 pan, and it was too thick, so I broke it into random small bite sized pieces. My husband broke it up over ice cream.

This is delicious. It is addictive. The more you eat of it the more you'll want. Make sure you break it apart when it becomes firm but before it gets too hard.
