Really good!Only note I would make is that unlss you have an enourmous dutch oven you will probably need to use two for this many shanks. I used two and just bumped up the veg, wine and tied thyme and parsely into two bundles. Simple recipe, very satisfying

Having never made Osso Buco before, I was quiet happy with this easy recipe and delicious meal. I had to pair the recipe down to two servings but the recipe is a keeper and well worth sharing.

Wow! Absolutely fabulous, easy to make and soooo delicious. Thank heavens for a little restraint we could have polished off the lot tonight, but we didn't and so have more for another evening. I served it with parsley mash and peas, couldn't have been a more wonderful meal. Another Gourmet hit - well what do I expect after reading Gourmet since 1982!

Outstanding. Used lamb shanks with red wine and beef broth, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. One of the best meals I've had in quite a while. Served with Risotto Milanese and asperagus. Was very pretty also.

This is an exceptional recipe! I have made it 4 times in the past 4 weeks. (Just remember to do the reduction - it makes all the difference!)

Good- but not great. Followed the directions and ate it the next day to allow the flavours to deepen. Still just okay- 2.5 stars.

I have to say I was seriously under impressed by this recipe. I follow it exactly - used organic ingredients and the best veal osso buco from Grandville Island. There are better osso buco recipes out there.

This is a truly lovely recipe. This last time I made it with adult Buffalo shanks. The connective tissue was more prominent than one would experience with a much younger creature, but it was absolutely no problem, the flavor was phenomenal and the nutritional benefits of grass-fed animal protein made this osso buco even more delicious.

Tested the recipe on my husband and he fell in love again. I made it again for my German family for Christmas 2008 and they loved it too. The second time around I modified the recipe a bit as follows: --Make sure the meat will fit in your baking dish otherwise you will need a second or third baking dish but there will always be enough sauce. --I used 1 cup red wine and 1/2 cup of white wine. Make sure the red wine is not a deep purple color otherwise you sauce may be purple too. --If you serve the same wine you cook with, make sure you have an extra bottle or two for serving with the dinner. --I used four garlic cloves for the Osso Buco. --I used 1 400 ml (1.5 cups) jar of veal broth and 1 400 ml jar of chicken broth. --Don't skimp on the broth, buy a good brand w/o MSG. --I substituted 2 Tbsp tomato paste since good fresh Italian tomatoes were not in season. --Used 2 herb sachets instead of one and included 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary in each sachet. Also doubled the amount of bay leaves. --To save time I mincled all of the ingredients the night before. That way I didn't smell like garlic and onions when my guests arrived ;-) --I did not strain the pan juices since the veggies were finely chopped. --As a starch I have served this dish with mashed potatoes, polenta, and risotto. We prefer the mashed potatoes which require less time in the kitchen. As a veggie I served it with green beans. --With our leftovers my husband cooked red cabbage and added a bit of cinnamon adn we reheated the remaining green beans. Totally delicious too. Guten Appetit!

My son is home from school for a long weekend and asked if he could have a veal chop, which I couldn't find when I made a quick stop @ Costco. Instead, beautiful veal shank crosscuts (osso buco!) were for sale @ $5.90 a lb! Couldn't pass them up! This recipe is so easy! I had everything available @ home. Vegetables were quickly and finely chopped in my Cuisinart mini-prep (that I've had since I made baby food for my 17 year old!)and were cooked in a dutch oven while I browned the shanks in a skillet alongside(another big time saver!). Once they were brown I transferred them into the dutch oven, added the wine to the skillet and scraped the drippings, and before too long it was ready to be poured over the meat, followed by the broth and the tomatoes, which I strained and also whizzed in the mini-prep. I also made the gremolata in the mini-prep. This could be a commercial for the nini-prep!!! :-) In any event, very flavorful and easy. I paired it with rice in a pasta bowl, as that was all that was available, but I'll bet polenta or even mashed potatoes would be phenomenal. A great rainy day or winter dish. Next time, I'll try beef or lamb shanks, or, perhaps, even oxtail this way.

I was clearing out my recipe file and came across my favorite osso bucco recipe! I had actually typed it in 1991. I can't wait to make it again eventhough veal shanks at my market are about $8 a pound. I served it with both polenta and rissoto.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it really was a hit. I followed the recipe fairly close but added a little orange zest during braising. It is fairly labor intensive but worth it. Using the leftover sauce and meat over egg noodles.

Rating: 4
Wow! Easily one of the best meals I have served my guests. I followed the recipe exactly, except ran out of time to finish with the gremolata (will try it next time). I served this plated (best in a large pasta bowl) with creamy cheese polenta, then the shank and garnished with sugar snap peas. My guests practically licked the bowls clean! Only needed 4 servings, but made the complete sauce recipe and had plenty of the yummy sauce left for another meal. Great "make ahead" meal - and enjoy your guests!

I've made this recipe for two different dinner parties - it was a hit at both. The only modifications I made to the recipe were to add a few tablespoons of tomato paste after removing the veal to give the sauce more body, and I used an immersion blender to break the vegetables down rather than straining the sauce. I served it with parmesan orzo and roasted asparagus - yum. Made the gremolata the first time, but my guests didn't care for it so I left it out the second time. There was enough sauce left to serve with linguini the next night.

This was just Ok. Two veal shanks and $22(!) later it was nothing to rave about. Save your pennies and your efforts by going to the osso recipe with mushroon sauce and use beef shanks instead. Now THAT is a smashing recipe!!

I've prepared this recipe twice, once for Valentine's Day and again on New Year's Eve, albeit with some modifications. I feel I have more control over the heat if cooked on the stovetop versus the oven and I very much prefer if the cooking liquid is pureed and strained to make the dish a little more elegant. I think this is an exceptionnally easy recipe to make and it certainly would benefit from advance preparation. If I had remembered to add anchovies (a discovery from another recipe) to my grocery list they would have been used. It is the essential ingredient to bring it all together.

Great dish! I didn't change a thing. I saved this recipe in my box and have made it time and time again. I serve with wild mushroom risotto.

With some "tweaking," this recipe is good to go. I had no kitchen string, so I used dental floss instead. It works! Added a tspn.( or more!)of sugar to the tomato basting juices, and almost an entire bouillon cube (chicken flavored)to give the final sauce a boost. Used a Pinot Grigio/champagne mix for the wine because that's what I had on hand. Definitely sprinkle the gremolata over the finished product--enhances the taste and looks good. It is NOT a labor intensive dish. While it's stewing in the oven for two hours, do something else--like make a fabulous dessert!

Impressive and delicious, but time-consuming. Served it with lemon saffron rice and everyone loved it.

I made this recipe for two parties in the past.It is definitely the best osso buco recipe I have ever seen and I think it's due to the fact that you saute and then braise in the oven. I have often made it ahead keeping the juices separate, adding more wine to them and then reheating and pouring over before final reheating of the dish in the oven. Friends took the leftovers!

This was good but not spectacular. Definitely not worth the time it takes to make it.

I did a "test kitchen" on this recipe--and it was excellent! It is time consuming but not difficult--be sure to leave enough time for the process at the end of pressing the veggies thru the strainer--it's essential but it takes time. (Scrape both sides of the strainer to get all the goodness!)The gremolata is also perfect for taste and presentation. Definitely a winter dinner party dish. Your guests will be thrilled.

Attention South Beach Dieters! Leave off the flour and saute' shanks in olive oil, then after baking dish for 2 hours,mash the remaining vegies to thicken sauce to pour over shanks.

Was well worth the effort. Was very easy to make, but time consuming. Cut the time by cooking the vegetables at the same time as browning the veal shanks. I did the recipe in a dutch oven by layering veggies, shanks, juice, tomatoes, veggies, shanks, juice, tomatoes. I served it over mashed potatoes. What a taste sensation!

Wonderful! Definitely will make this one again.

Excellent dish - rich, hearty, very flavourful. Used this recipe as a starting point and made some changes/additions: only had 2 veal shanks so added 4 large lean beef shortribs, reduced butter/oil to less than half, used 6 cloves garlic, 1 cup each of red and white wine, 1-1/2 cups each of chicken and beef broth, added a 6" stem of fresh rosemary, lots of fresh ground pepper and increased oven time to 3-1/2 hours - meat was incredibly tender. Reduced the sauce to thicken and added sliced mushrooms - wonderful on garlic mashed potatoes! Be sure to make the gremolata - a taste treat that really adds to this already scrumptious dish! Give it a try - you will not be disappointed!

Just a note to the cook from Hollywood, CA. I have been making ossu buco milanese for many years and have always cooked it in a pot on top of the stove. It absolutely does not have to go in the oven. Just simmer gently for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours and you get the same results. Matter of fact, I will be making this on the weekend when my son comes home from college. It is both our favorite meal. Love that marrow!

Rating: 3
Good result. Hostile recipe. There is a lot of *in and out of the oven and stove* with this recipe. I also don't like the fact that they change stovetop temperatures at the end of the description of what to do. An example is "Spread the tomatoes over the shanks, add the cheesecloth bag, the salt, and pepper to taste, and bring the liquid to a simmer over moderately high heat." This sucked. I had my pan hotter because the recipe called for a hot pan earlier. The meal was unexplicably good. However I was unable to understand the way the pan should be prepared due to the lack of an adequate description of how to prepare this dish.

I have been making this recipe, with great success, since it originally appeared in Gourmet so long ago. It never, ever fails. In fact, we love the flavors so much I add an extra piece of veal, save all the broth and veggies after serving it for dinner (if there is any,) and then make the BEST vegetable soup from the leftover veal, marrow, broth and veggies. Such a special treat, and really easy to make.....and make ahead. Thank you Gourmet!

Rating: 4
This was fabulous! I used dry red wine instead of white, a 6 oz can of tomato paste instead of fresh tomatoes, and dried thyme instead of fresh. I had beef stock but next time will use veal stock which I think will improve the dish. (I buy veal stock from a restaurant - be nice to the manager and give them advance notice. It freezes well too.) I made risotto which, I had never attempted before and it was wonderful.

I've made this dish several times. It's a great special dinner. It's now a live auctioon mainstay for a local charity--raising $1800 for the Italian dinner! I've added 3-4 long strands of orange zest to the sauce and approx. 1/4t. chopped orange zest to the gremolata. Serve atop a grilled polenta cake. Side dish of steamed rosemary zucchini, first course pasta or risotto, a Gelato dessert and a hearty Italian red. The dish can be made ahead and warmed to finish. It's spectacular when finished.

Rating: 4
Of all the Osso Buco recipes, this one is the best. It is only improved by using fresh veal stock instead of chicken or beef stock. Also, veal shanks should be from the hind hocks only. I have made this recipe time and again and it has never failed me yet. It is especially good made a day in advance.

YUMMMMMMMM...I made this dish for a Christmas Eve party to rave reviews! Only the bone was left on their plate! Even the marrow was devoured. The recipe was easy, and I get all the credit... Next time I will add some rosemary to the cheesecloth...I look forward to the next time.

This is a delicious dinner recipe. I have made it with veal and with lamb, and we definitely prefer the lamb. I ordered the lamb shanks ahead of time from my butcher and asked him to cut each shank into three pieces. My company ate every bite, and I'd even made a double recipe so we'd have leftovers!!! The gremolata is certainly a delightful finishing touch. Red wine, simple caesar salad and French bread = heavenly!!!

I made this recipe yesterday and was very surprised by how easy it was. My husband who has no appreciation of veal loved it as did my very finicky dinner guest. I also made the salad and it as well was a success. The shanks are expensive and I found them in our Little Italy so for special occassions only. Loved it!

It was great. If you take it from the oven and cool it over night, you can remove most of all the fat. Then continue with the recipe as written. Reducing the liquids to two cups also makes it thicker and creamier. A small fork is a treat for the marrow.

Rating: 3
This is very good and very forgiving. My houseguest came in late, and the osso buco held well for an extra 45 minutes. I will make two changes when I do it again. First, I would like a hint of lemon in with the wine and not just on top. Second, a major spice seems to be missing. It is either rosemary, sage, basil, or maybe even a tiny hint of fennel. Any ideas?

The veggie prep notwithstanding, this is an easy meal to make. The taste is superlative; we all loved it. I served it with a simple risotto of course and that will be the only variation I would consider in this great company meal.

This is a good, traditional version that is so easy to make. I served it at a recent dinner party -- and gave everyone special spoons so they could scoop out the marrow from the bone. Fun.

One of the better methods. Try using pork tenderloins or thick sliced pork loin- much less fat, just as easy. It would be criminal to make this without risotto.

well my husband loved this recipe he eats this every chance he gets. I think it was a bit difficult to make, I only did one thing different I put the veggies from the mixture into a food processor carrot, celery, onions etc.) then I did what ever the recipe said.. Yes I will make Osso bucco agai(even at $8.00 a lb. for veal shanks)..

I have made Osso bucco many a time and absolutely love it. The recipe I have is very similar to this one with the exception that you add a couple of anchovies to the gremolata which seems to bring all the flavours together perfectly - even for those who do not like "fishy tastes" - me being one of them. I only cook this for myself as my partner does not like the sinewy meat and I add 1 to 2 anchovies to the gremolata when cooking 2 pieces of veal shanks.

This recipe is wonderful - it is simple and flavorful! Make sure you boil the juices down to at least 3 cups (I actually boiled it down to 2 cups for a richer, thicker consistency). My husband and I used to have Osso Buco at the Como Inn in Chicago - I think this recipe is very comparable. The only drawback is the cost/accessibility of veal shanks. Otherwise, a memorable meal!

This was great. My only suggestion is to substitute tomato paste for the tomatos if you have to use store bought tomatos. That's what I did and it was very good. I also used a blender to puree the sauce.
