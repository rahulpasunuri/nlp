Excellent! I made this as directed and at the end I found it was lacking acidity as others have mentioned. Added lemon juice and it was perfect. The recommended garnish addded color and a bit of bite. I added a spoon of sour cream to each plate and pine nuts. A big hit with my guests and ridiculously easy.

This soup is ok, I followed the recipe exactly and while it is creamy, it's not very flavorful. I added more salt & some homemade croutons to make it better. A reason not to make it: zucchini makes you gassy & bloated. A little something we learned after we ate it & looked it up online. Not good for dinner parties or if you plan on leaving the house.

Was great sprinkled with either Black Lava Salt or Smoked Sea Salt (little goes a long way). What a great use for my julienne peeler that I forgot I had ordered and it came in 2 days before my dinner party. Yummy!

Really delicious and disturbingly creamy for being vegan! Like many other reviewers, I tweaked the spices (a dash or red pepper, a dash of herbs de provence, black pepper) and garnished with a lemon wheel. The only thing I felt it needed was a bit more acid, which the lemon garnish provided. I used water and not broth and the flavor was still rich and delicious. My guests loved the soup and took some home. It's a great way to use all that zucchini and basil from your garden!

Please permit me to say that I made a few changes to the recipe, so if you're a loony tune about making modifications, please scan on. I used beef broth because I had it. I added a bit of grated parmigiano reggiano because it's good. I used yellow squash and zucchini because I always buy them in tandem. Other than that, I was pretty true to the recipe. An immersion blender makes this a piece of cake. The result is smooth, silky, healthy, and delicious. We'll make it over and over again.

Very delicious recipe! I followed the recipe pretty closely, but used 2 cups of chicken broth per other readers suggestions and since I did not have enough basil in my garden I added some dried oregano to make up the difference. The julienned zucchini was a nice touch, and quite easy with my new "as seen on tv" veggie peeler! A very creamy healthy soup that even my two year out ate with relish.

I used yellow summer squash mixed with zucchini, and used some leeks that were going bad in the fridge instead of the onion. I didn't make the garnish, but only because my zucchini were starting to go bad, the skin was not usable. I'll make it next time.

The best way I can describe this soup is "interesting". The flavor combination is unique, the texture is quite good. I liked it but I doubt I'll be rushing to make it again. However, if you have tons of zucchini and basil from your garden that you need to get rid of, it is definitely worth a try!

The amazing thing about this soup is that it tastes so rich and creamy and buttery yet there is no butter or fat in it....a deceptively healthy soup and great for using up zucchini.

Although adding basil and garlic to cucumbers was against my gut feeling, I decided to do this recipe. However, I found the most beautiful bunches of watercress in the market. So I substituted watercress for the basil, skipped the garlic and used leeks instead of onion. The soup was delicious!!

Simple and delicious. Creamy without any dairy. I made mine thicker by adding just a little less water than the recipe calls for (2.5 cups instead of 3)

Rating: 4
So simple, yet so delicious. However, my husband and I have altered the recipe a bit, substituting vegetable broth for some of the water, and we long ago dropped the step of julienning and blanching the zucchini to go on top. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

Loved this simple soup. I used a zester to 'julienne' the skins of ALL my zucchini before cutting them and I think that the garnish really added a nice contrast in texture. I used less oil than the recipe called for and substituted some homemade veggie broth for the water. The basil is the star of this soup so do yourself a favor--use some nice organic basil from your garden or the store--easy to find this time of year. This soup was the perfect starter for dinner and also made a great lunch with my co-workers the next day.

Rating: 4
Even great cold! After reading all the reviews I went with the chicken stock in lieu of water and increased both the onion and garlic. And I truly packed the basil leaves. I enjoyed it hot last night right after making it but OMG it is just wonderful cold today. I am a vichyssoise lover so this was a hit for me.

This is something I make on a regular basis upon request from my husband. I don't always bother with the julienned zucchini skin garnish. Sometimes I need substantially more salt and the quality of basil makes a huge difference. Store bought is iffy so I'm going to try and grow more this summer. The other thing to watch is the zucchini- sometimes the skin can be very bitter. Sniff the skin to make sure it doesn't smell bitter (or even take a small sliver before you slice. It might be worth peeling a few of the bitter ones because it will come through in your soup. Different people have varying sensitivity to it (I hate it, my husband doesn't mind). It can be done with all peeled zucchini but it definitely is more bland. Just keep an eye on produce quality and it is delicious!!

I used chicken stock, double garlic as well as sea salt and fresh ground black pepper. This soup was still really bland. I thought it was just ok, and my family did not like it. Though it is easy to prepare, I wouldn't make it again.

I first reviewed this soup on 7/15/08 and have made it half a dozen times. It is always a hit with guests. My sister-in-law asked me to bring it for Thanksgiving. I made a few changes suggested by other reviewers--using chicken and vegetable stock, doubling the garlic, upping the onion--all good suggestions. I also cut back slightly on the total oil, but used 1 TBSP of butter along with the olive oil. I added shallots to the onion garlic mixture, and while it was softening I added a few strips of prosciutto to the pan for added flavor but removed them before adding liquids. I skipped the zucchini garnish, but mixed minced basil, peppermint and dill into Fage Total Yogurt. For the garnish, I used a dollop of the room temperature yogurt mixture, along with prosciutto that had been baked at 400 degrees until barely crisp and then cut into tiny pieces. The contrast of the saltiness of the prosciutto and the freshness of the mint, with the creamy yogurt and subtle soup was very nice. Since it was for a holiday, I also strained the soup to achieve a silkier texture. I will fix this soup again and again and will alter the garnish to fit the season. Thank you Gourmet for such a wonderful recipe!

As did many other reviewers, I added chicken broth, more garlic, more basil, a little fresh dill and tarragon, fresh ginger, fat free cream and a bit of reduced fat cheddar (Cabot) and lots of black pepper! For serving, a dollop of Fage Yogurt. It's an awesome recipe!!

This recipe was amazing. I doubled the recipe and instead of using water, used 4c. chicken broth, 1 1/2c. beef broth, and the rest veggie broth. Very good mixture! I also doubled garlic amount and added chopped carrots. I also did not mess with the ribbons.

Rating: 3
This soup was really great - after reading some of the other reviews, I also substituted chicken broth for water and doubled the amount of garlic to 4 cloves. I was fortunate enough to have picked the zucchini and the basil right out of my garden, so it truly could not have been any fresher. I also loved the fact that it was quite low in fat and calories, but was extremely hearty and filling. Paired with a garden salad, it made for an excellent summer supper.

Really delicious. Made this for dinner last night and the recipe is really easy and stealthily healthy. I used 4 garlic cloves instead of 2 and used more than 1/3 cup basil. The flavor was still subtle and fresh.

Easy and a simple yet elegant use of a common vegetable. Carefully grated long strips of zukes with a fine box grater instead of the julienne. Worked well. Topped with plain yogurt. Made a tasty late summer dinner with quick bruschetta.

I made this soup, admittedly without the fresh basil, but instead with the dried stuff, and it turned out wonderfully despite the substitution. Just like a standard tex-mex or chicken chili this soup offers a wonderful platform to either enjoy alone or (as other reviewers found) paired with a topping or added ingredient.

I made this soup hoping to use up some basil I cut in the garden. It was good but not quiet as creamy and satisfying as I had thought it might be. I chalk it up to the time of year and the fact I wanted it for a main course, would be better as a first course, perhaps when the weather is still warm. I did use chicken broth as others recommended and a little more basil too.

I was amazed how good this was. I never would have even tried it if it hadn't been for the other reviews. I made two batches. The first as is, and on the second, I used a little less oil, chicken stock instead of water (veg. stock for vegetarians) double the garlic as suggested by other reviewers and a little garlic powder sprinkled over the final puree. So good I recommended it to a couple people and they also loved it.

This was extremely easy to make. I did use stock instead of water, and I didn't do the garnish as I was making it for just myself. If I made this for company I might serve a skewer of grilled shrimp and red & yellow grape tomatoes across the top of the bowl. Very summery tastes--the basil makes this soup...

Update, last night we picked more sweet corn. I had some of this soup left from the previous nights dinner. I cut the corn off a few cobs added it to the soup and simmered to reheat. A great way to add a nice sweet flavor and a bit of texture. It's not really the same recipe any more but it's very good.

As written this recipes SCREAMS for help. One star if Im feeling generous. Yes it was very smooth and creamy but about as flavorful as week old wonder bread. I took the advice of several other reviewers and substituted and added to create a very nice soup. First unless you have flavored water use chicken stock. Second add more garlic, a bit more onion and a healthy dash of fresh ground pepper. Third add about 1/2 -1 cup of heavy cream to finish it of it adds a great deal of flavor and makes this soup very creamy. Before all you health police jump me, I made this with zucchini, basil, onions and garlic from my organic garden and served it with fresh corn on the cob, some sliced cucumbers, and tomatoes also out of my organic garden. To finish it off I made some grilled Havarti cheese on San Fran sour dough sandwiches. Splurge some, eat well and live long. With alterations Ill give this 3 stars.

I made the recipe as printed here, and it was too bland. If I made it again, I'd try adding creme fraiche or yogurt -- maybe also a boiled potato for a thicker, smoother final product. Not a bad way to use megadoses of zucchini and basil, but the recipe needs to be doctored in order to be really yummy.

Rating: 4
This was great. Of course I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I added some yellow crookneck squash to the zucchini - still a total of 2 lbs. I reduced the oil for cooking the onions & garlic to 2 tblspns. Increased the onion to 1 cup, since that's how much I had after chopping the onion. At the end I added about 4 tablespoons of homemade pesto that I'd whipped together for pasta last night (that's how much pesto I had left over.) It was really yummy. More like pesto soup. And really, can you ever have too much pesto?

This soup tastes healthful, which means it's bland. I used tap water, and you can taste the tap water in the soup. (Granted, Davis has TERRIBLE tasting tap water.) I'm going to try and save it with some ginger or pepper plus feta, yogurt or cream. Next time I'll use coconut milk or chicken broth as per the suggestions below.

Rating: 3
The flavor of the soup was very good. It tasted like pesto soup. Texture however was no where near creamy. It was definitely smooth but had none of the mouthfeel that you get with cream. I added a tablespoon of Greek yogurt to each bowl and that helped tremendously. To make the soup truely delicious I crumpled up a strip of bacon for the top. Now you might say that this takes away from the healthiness of the soup but a low fat soup with a strip of bacon that I really enjoy is still better than a burger and fries for lunch any day.

3 forks for the recipe as written but 4 forks with some changes. A little more garlic, chicken broth instead of water and a touch of light cream added at the end made this a beautiful soup! Even my kids begged for more (they like zucchini but their enthusiasm for this soup was overwhelming!). Lovely summery taste and, served lukewarm, it was perfect for a hot day!

This recipe needed some help. I added a couple dashes of chipolte chili powder to zip it up. It was too bland without some help. With that addition, it tasted wonderful. I made the ribbons of zucchini peel, but next time I think I'll zest a lemon instead. I didn't have green zucchini, so used what I had which was a round yellow zucchini. The yellow peel contrasted nicely with the light green soup. My husband thought it was very tasty, too. Served it with salmon and corn on the cob.

This is SO GOOD. I was concerned that it would be a little bland, but it wasn't at all (with some small changes). Definite keeper! I noticed some reviewers doubled the onion.

Delicious and easy -- what more could you ask? My husband could hardly believe there was no cream in it. For anyone who thinks this is bland, all it needs is a bit of seasoning-to-taste at the end; I added a bit more salt, a generous amount of pepper, and a dash of cayenne. With a tomato salad and crusty bread, this was a quick, easy summer meal. I'll definitely make this again.

This is one is a keeper. Creamy texture and fabulous flavor. We were having guests for dinner so made this the night before. I gently reheated it with no problems. Doubled the garlic & used 1c onion. Salted & blanched the ribbons before guests arrived. I highly suggest doing this little extra step as it adds dimension to the flavor and a sophisticated presentation. It wasn't hard or time consuming. The guests gobbled it up and walked away with the recipe. Easy peasy delightful creamy!

This is wonderful recipe. It's easy, foolproof and a hit with guests. It is good as written, but we add a heaping TBSP of minced fresh ginger in with the onions and garlic to make it a little more complex. We pack the basil in very tight and add a little more than a third of a cup. Finally, for each serving, we cut one large basil leaf into long slivers and mix it into the zucchini garnish. A delicious summer soup and oh, so very healthy!

This soup has a nice, clean flavor; it's good to make if you have a lot of zucchini on hand. My basil plant didn't have enough leaves for the amount the recipe called for - my batch would have benefited from more basil. I added a dollop of plain Greek yogurt on top of the julienned zucchini in each bowl. I also plan to add cayenne or another type of hot pepper to give it more of a kick next time. Unfortunately this soup did not win over my daughter, who is not a big fan of zucchini, but the rest of us enjoyed it. It's a great healthy, summer soup and I will definitely make it again.
