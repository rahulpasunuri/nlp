I suggest adding chopped fresh thyme, and chopped leeks, as well as a few tablespoons of vermouth to de-glaze the pan after sautéeing veggies. All of these add complexity and flavor, without a lot of extra effort!

I made this recipe with left over ham that we smoked so the taste was most likely quite a bit different, but it was absolutely delicious, and so easy to make.

Had Plath smoked pork loin with about 3/4 of a pound left with some of the bones to use in a pea soup. Chose this recipe and used a mixture of chicken and beef stock to make up for the ham hock stock that I did not make. The soup was delicious and easy to make.

I have tried this recipe 2x,,,I bought sm. ham hock with a future date as expiration , followed the recipe, adding garlic to the boiling veggie. Cooked, cooled, tasted. I was not impressed by the ham broth. So I started at step one by gently sauteing onion, 2 celery ch., carrots ch. in e.v.o.o. Then I added the beans (I soaked) & water with bouillon cubes..good amt. of salt &pep. after cooking for 1 1/2 hrs, I added 5 small yukon golds unpeeled, & cooked another 30 mins, I did go over the butts of pork & pcs. not to fatty went in.

I followed this recipe exactly, except that I simmered it in a crockpot set on low for about 8 hours. It came out too thin for my taste. Next time, if I was making it in the crockpot I would not add as much water to the ham broth (I added 3 cups to make the 12 the recipe called for), maybe reducing it by 1 or 2 cups. I liked the croutons warm from the oven-crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, a hint of salt and olive oil-but not after they had sat for a day in a tupperware container, awaiting dinner time. Maybe warming them up in the oven would reinvigorate them. I liked the addition of the frozen peas, it adds a little pop of taste and texture. I think this soup tastes better the next day. My husband and kids liked it. Nobody liked the croutons. Overall, it seemed a lot of work for what was produced, which was a nice flavorful pea soup. Good, but not great. I will make pea soup again, using some of these ingredients but not following it exactly as written.

Overall a great soup but next time I will used smoked ham instead of ham hocks....I find the flavor of ham hocks to be too strong. Otherwise though, excellent flavor and make sure to make the croutons. They are a great accompaniment.

I used a smoked turkey leg instead of the ham hocks, low sodium chicken or beef broth, baby carrots instead of the large carrots, I forgot the cup of frozen peas, and it was still great!

This is such a great dynamic soup, I don't think anyone can mess this up. It is a little time consuming, but follow the recipe, and you get enough soup to feed a small army, or a big family. Loads of flavor too. I used some smoked ham shanks that yielded quite a bit of meat, I didn't add any frozen peas, nor pumpernickel bread, and it still was awesome! I like the idea of the prev reviewer with adding a little crushed red pepper next time or some herbs. Like I mentioned, this recipe is dynamic and could have various things added and it would all taste good I'm sure.

EXCELLENT side dish--not enough meat to be a one-dish meal. Used less water, added thyme, a can of low sodium chicky broth, crushed red pepper for zing, and a scant pound of potatoes (cubed) at the end.

Even as a child I loved split pea soup but I have always had issues with the gelatinous green gruel that results after it cools. This recipe did not appear to have any special ingredients or treatment but the reviews convinced me to try it. The soup is done, I am waiting to add the peas and carrots when company arrives but as of now the consistency and flavor is great. I don't eat meat so used a good flavorful vegi stock which is fine. I also purchased smoked salmon to go with or on top for the "smoky ham hock" flavor. (I have done the same with corn chowder and it is great) I am very pleased with the result and got so much joy from reading about the woman who spent hours slicing fresh green peas this recipe is a keeper. Poor gal:)

I have tried this twice now and liked it both times, I added a tablespoon of dry tarragon and a few bay leaves. Both times it was too salty. I guess the hamhocks I used had too much salt. Next time I intend to remove a few cups of the broth and replace it with plain water to dilute the salt. I also intend to substitute a cup of dry white for one cup of broth. I am used to thick pea soup and found this to be a little thin. But in hindsight, maybe the pea soups I have been making were too thick. I haven't gotten around to the croutons but I am interested in making them. All in all, a good recipe.

This was an excellent and refined split pea soup, glad to finally serve one that doesnt look like gruel. Really impressed my family, Do taste the broth of the ham hocks as they vary greatly, some are ridiculously salty or over-smoked--its kind of hit or miss. BUT TO THE COOK that said she used whole peas and a tiny knife split them--what is wrong with you? Was this a joke? My mother and I laughed for hours!

Rating: 3
to the reviewer with the question about making this without the ham hocks - they are essential. make something else. i used split yellow peas and they did not cook within the 1 1/2 hour cook time, even after soaking them in cold water first for several house. I will try to soak them overnight next time and add them before some of the soup vegetables.

Really enjoyed this soup. I used a little less ham broth than called for, because I like pea soup a little thick, but otherwise followed the recipe as stated. Perfect for a cold day (which unfortunately can be few and far between in middle GA.)

This is one fine soup. It takes quite a bit longer than simpler recipes because you cook the ham first. If I made it again I would put all the carrots in at once. I assume half the carrots are held back to have some that have more texture, but it doesn't seem to matter that much. The frozen peas are a great and very simple idea I'll use for all split pea soups.

Excellent soup, tasty, easy to make; however, start out with 8 cups of broth/water, 12 is a bit too much. You can adjust it later if so desired.

This is an excellent pea soup, but I didn't find it that much better then some vegetarian split pea soups that I make. The addition of the pumpernickel croutons and the frozen fresh peas make a nice special addition, and I will use those in my other split pea recipes as well. I use a hand blender to blend the peas and vegetables and help thicken it. The last step of adding carrots seems optional to me.

Split pea soup is not a favorite in our house but considering that this recipe got such rave reviews, I had to try it. I'm glad that I did becuase it was amazing! Everyone who tried it loved it and it wasn't really hard to make. The only thing that I will do next time is double, maybe even triple the recipe and freeze the leftovers.

Rating: 3
This was a delicious recipe even though I forgot to do a few things. I completely forgot to add the frozen peas at the end, made no difference to me at all! Also, (how stupid is this?) I accidentally threw out the ham hocks broth! Luckily I had enough chicken broth to use instead! At least I still had the meat and bones for the ham hocks! My soup wound up being very thick and hearty. Definite keeper, I think it was the best pea soup I've ever made! Croutons were good too! JL

I have always hated peas, but my husband likes them. So, tongue-in-cheek, I gave this recipe a try, and it was FABULOUS!!! Mine turned out a bit thin in consistency, but I think that this was because I made it in a covered slow-cooker. Made my life easy and cooked up the ham hocks on the stove last night, removed the meat from the bones, and then refrigerated the broth, bones, and meat overnight. This afternoon I peeled off that fat layer on top of the broth. Put the broth, bones, and veggies into the slow-cooker and simmered it for about 4 hrs. The only ingredient changes I made were: used a medium onion and about 1 tsp. minced garlic instead of 1 large onion, increased the pepper to 1/2 tsp., added a sprinkle of crushed thyme, deleted the last 2 carrots (I was afraid it would get too sweet), added no salt to anything (ham hocks added plenty of salt to the soup, and the croutons did not need any salt either), and didn't need to saute any veggies in oil. ECONOMICAL, too! Excluding the croutons, it could not have cost more than $5 for the whole pot.

I followed this recipe exactly, except I didn't have any onions. It was still one of the most delicious soups I've ever tasted. My husband (who claims he hates split pea soup) loved this soup! He asked me to make it for his parents when they visit us next. Definately a keeper!

Try using whole dried peas for a different texture. They are available in most hispanic stores. You gain the "husk" of the pea itself. I also add my shredded carrots just before serving. Cooking the carrots the whole time adds a "sweetness" I do not prefer, but I do like the "color" of the carrots in the final presentation.

Since I try to avoid red meats, I always use smoked turkey parts, rather than ham, to get that wonderful smoky taste. Just as good, and a bit healthier.

To the cook asking about the crock pot. That's the only way I make my pea soup. Just rinse the peas and put the vegetables, ham hocks and peas with water and turn on the crock pot and cook for 8 hours on low. This recipe is very similar to mine accept I add thyme and bay leaf.

this is directed to the person who didnt want to use meat...I rarely use meat in my pea soups..Make a mirepoix with onions,garlic,carrots,celery,tomatoes,and sweet peppers saute these in olive or sunflower oil. but not to brown..after you can either blend it or if you chop real tiny then you dont have to. after add the peas and water or vegetable stock you have saved when boiling vegies..salt and pepper a pinch of cinnamon,a bay leaf and a tiny pinch of cloves...bring to boil then lower heat and cook slowly,stirring from time to time .if you find it sticking add a tiny bit of water and stir, simmer till peas are all smoth..excellent.

To the cook who wanted to know if you can make this without meat: Yes, but you will lose that smoky flavor the ham gives it. I've never tried this, but concievably you could add some Liquid Smoke (find it in a small bottle in the spice aisle). I haven't made this recipe, so I can't promise you how that will turn out.

Yesterday was a typical Northern California storm day. The sky sobbed big sloppy rain drops from ill-tempered clouds ranging in color from gray to dark gray to "run for cover" brown gray. Meanwhile, the wind walloped buildings and cars with gusts up to 41 mph. That's right. A perfect soup day. I made this soup sans the croutons and with about three times the salt. My husband, a split pea soup fanatic, loved it, though he was, at first, leery of the frozen peas bobbing at the surface. I've never liked the sludginess of split pea soup, and, therefore, never ate any. This recipe is devoid of sludge. And, so, I tasted it, then chowed a bowlful. A tasty winter dish.
