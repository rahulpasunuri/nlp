I had high hopes for this recipe and it turned out better than I expected! We modified the recipe leaving out the zucchini and eggplant, but added beets and turnips. I would recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a vegetarian main course.

I agree with the other reviews - I spread the vegetables over 2 rimmed cookie sheets and they cooked perfectly. Also, I used porcini olive oil, dried spices (Penzeys blend) and canned fire roasted chopped tomatoes. I think that if I added parm cheese and served it over rice, it could be an entree.

Delicious - really enjoy all the flavors of this recipe. Agree with the other reviwers, the author of this recipe must have one large oven to use a pan that can contain all the veggie goodies on a single layer (and, if the oven is that large, I'm exceedingly jealous). I used a 13x9 pan and it worked well. Additionally, to try and speed up the prep work, I used all dry spices (1/2 the amount listed) and diced canned tomatoes.

I agree with Schoharie regarding the volume of veggies. I had to ignore the instructions on that point and just pile them up on a pan. The flavors were wonderful and some unevenness in their texture created a depth we enjoyed. I was hoping to serve this as a vegetarian main course, but it wasn't really enough. But this is good with a side of crusty warm bread on a rainy night when you're not wanting a big meal.

This was good but not excellent. One issue I had was with the directions. It insisted several times that the diced vegetables be spread in a single layer on the baking sheet, while specifying such quantities of vegetables that this was impossible, unless you rotated several sheets in and out of the oven. However, a satisfying mid-week meal.
