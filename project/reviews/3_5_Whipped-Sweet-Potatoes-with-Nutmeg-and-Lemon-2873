I prepared this for Easter lunch with family. It was a big hit. Everyone loved the touch of lemon. I thought the amount of nutmeg sounded like a lot, but it was just right for us. Used the food processor to puree the sweet potatoes and that worked great; no lumps, so perhaps the person who commented previously about lumps didn't have the potatoes cooked thoroughly. With all the other food we had, this recipe was oodles for our group of 14 adults and 3 kids. I'll definitely fix this one again.

This is certainly a tasty recipe. I gave it 3 forks only because I don't think it will serve 12 people. Next time I make it, and there will be a next time, perhaps I will bake the sweet potatoes instead of peeling and boiling.

I prepared this for Christmas Eve a day ahead. Easy and delicious! When you drain the sweet potatoes, reserve some of the liquid. You can use it later when reheating if the potatoes are too thick for your taste.

i made this when i was in a pinch - it was quick and tasty. One thing though, i should have known that it would need some liquid/butter to make a smooth puree, but since i followed the directions to the best of my ability (with a one-year old tugging on my leg) - it turned out lumpy.

I prepared this dish for Thanksgiving when it was first published and several years after. I took a chance that I might found it and I did. It is easy, great, and low calorie to boot. Everyone loved it and I won't lose it again.
