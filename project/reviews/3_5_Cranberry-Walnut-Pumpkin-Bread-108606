Good, basic recipe for breakfast bread. I added chopped crystalized ginger, reduced sugar by 1/4 cup and subbed pepitas (fancy pumpkin seeds). Use 2/3 cup plain full fat yogurt and 2T whole milk instead of buttermilk, which is never on hand here. Topped the loaf w/ a few seeds to promise what's inside. Tastes better the second day, after the flavors all blend. Nice!

Outstanding pumpkin recipe and perfect for that bit of pumpkin left over after making your pie. After reading the reviews, I decided to bake mine in the form of muffins. They were heavenly, not too sweet, perfect crunch... I'll definitely make these again!

Easy fall bread recipe? I added about 1/3 cup of dried cherries but otherwise stuck to the recipe.

This is a great tasting light bread to serve as a snack or brunch with or w/o butter. It is not like the oily, dense, very sweet pumpkin "bread" (that I love too) which is better as a dessert in my opinion.

This recipe has landed a spot in my book of exceptional recipes. I use a full 12 ounce bag of fresh cranberries and it adds a bit of tart to round out the flavors. Delicious.

I thought that recipe was very easy to make and a very good bread to ring in fall with. I did make some alterations though. I did not put the extra sugar on top, I did not have buttermilk so used 2/3 cup milk with a tbplsn of lemon juice and I also ran out of vanilla extract and ended up just making it without the extract. It still cam out great!

Great new recipe for my collection. Big danger, I can't stop eating it. Tweaks: eliminated pumpkin pie spice and subbed 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1 1/2 tsp ginger and 3/4 tsp nutmeg. Upped the cranberries and walnuts to 3/4 cps each and added 1/3 cp chp crystalized ginger. Dusted the pan with flour. It rose beautifully and slipped out like a dream. This is a winner hands down!Can you make a good thing better? Might try adding some all spice next time and there will be many next times. To the cook whose bread sunk, throw out your baking powder and buy new...preferably the Rumford brand.

I love this bread. I have been making it since 2003... it is so tasty! HOWEVER, it always falls once I turn off the oven. I've tried everything, longer baking time, lower temp for longer time, leave in oven after turning oven off, nothing works. Has anyone experienced the same problem?

Rating: 4
Probably the best pumpkin recipe I've used...I'm somewhat of a newb but am somewhat particular about my recipes. Loved the smooth texture and the moistness. I didn't have buttermilk, so in the process of "making" buttermilk I used half 2% milk and half EGGNOG! That added creaminess and a bit of a nutmeg/brandy flavor that was pretty interesting. Also I used four small loaf pans, which cut down on bake time and accommodated the unexpectedly large amount of batter that this recipe makes.

Excellent pumpkin spice bread! I used 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger, and 0.5 tsp nutmeg instead of the 2 tsp pumpkin spice mix that the recipe called for. I also substituted 1 cup light sour cream instead of the 1 cup buttermilk. Pumpkin was homemade mash (steamed a sugar pumpkin and mashed it up). Also, I didn't have dried cranberries so I used dried sour cherries. Will definitely make again and would serve it to company.

Rating: 4
Moist and delicious, this made a great quick bread for breakfast. I used pistachios instead of walnuts. Not too sweet. Many quick breads are really dense. This one is light and fluffy and puffed up over the top of the pan. Be sure to line the pan with wax or parchment paper, and watch the bread towards the end of the baking time so it doesn't burn. Husband loved it, and I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 3
This was very good, very moist and flavorful. With all that butter, be forewarned that it is not a lowfat recipe! I used fresh pumpkin, pecans, dried juice-sweetened cranberries, and my own mix of spices. I made a second loaf without fruit or nuts, and sweetened it with honey. I liked it even better than the original recipe!

Rating: 3
I made this as a bundt cake. Instead of using dried cranberries, I put 1 c. fresh cranberries, 1/4 c. water and 1/4 c. sugar in a saucepan and simmered until the cranberries popped, then added to the batter. I really liked the fresh cranberry tang. Nice moist cake, perfect for Thanksgiving morning (especially when you have to work!)

This recipe came out perfect for the potluck dinner I took it to. It is moist and travels well. (I made two loaves) I substituted sour cream and milk for the buttermilk and the texture was wonderful. I was asked for the recipe by several people who went back for seconds!

Very good. A few minor changes: I used brown sugar, ground my own spices (adding a bit more of each and using both allspice & cloves), used white ww flour, and freshly roasted, pureed pumpkin. I still had so much roasted pumpkin on hand that I promptly made a second loaf as above, also stirring in chopped roasted pumpkin and chocolate chips with the cranberries & nuts. Now that pushed it over the edge...

The pumpkin-cranberry combo is like if Halloween and Christmas had a baby and that baby was a loaf.

Just ate a piece right out of the oven and it was delicious. I lowered the butter to 4 T, subbed in sour cream for the buttermilk and pecans for the walnuts (that's what I had on hand). I also subbed maple syrup for the sugar, so to make that work I only added 3/4 c of maple syrup and increased the baking soda to 3/4 t (sugar is more acidic than maple syrup naturally). I was also generous with the pumpkin and probably added about 1/3 more. Very tasty and makes the house smell great!

Rating: 4
What a lovely recipe! I used fresh cranberries instead of dried. Just took a bunch and spun down in food processor, added a little sugar and let sit for about 10 minutes. Added walnuts to that and folded into batter. Worked beautifully. Fresh cranberries give it just a bit of tartness which really compliments the sweetness of the batter. Great recipe!

I followed the advice of oishiilove and used 3/4 cup of sugar, 1.5 cups of baked fresh pumpkin (instead of canned), the spice mix she recommended. Also followed the advice of psandiego and used nonfat plain yogurt instead of buttermilk. The results are really delicious; flavorful and very moist.

This is a wonderful pumpkin bread - moist and dense. However, like another reviewer or two, I recommend increasing the amount of spice. Either more pumpkin spice or using your own combination. The recipe as-is is a little bland on the spice. I also substituted plain yogurt for the buttermilk, out of convenience. Will definitely make again and again!!

I'm sure I would have thought this bread was super had I never had my Aunt's pumpkin bread. But I have, and though this bread is good, it's not quite the standard I expected. I also altered the recipe a little. Instead of using 2 tsp pumpkin spice, I used 2 tsp cinnamon, 1.5 tsp ginger and 3/4 tsp nutmeg. For my taste that was a good amount, I think what the recipe calls for would have left the bread a little on the bland side. I also used 1.5c fresh pumpkin instead of canned , halfed the flower with whole wheat and used 1/4c less sugar. It was a very dense and moist bread. It came out very well, and I plan to make it again since I don't have my aunt's recipe. Not to mention, I think the bread gets better with each slice. Overall I recommend the recipe, but suggust the baker to use his or her own judgement with the spices instead of following how it is written.

This is a great bread, however I did alter it a bit: 1/4 c. whole wheat flour in place of only all purpose, only 4 T butter and added about 3T apple butter, mixture of light and dark brown sugar in place of the white, generous with the pumpkin, and used dried cherries, walnuts, pecans, and chocolate chips to mix-in... So i admittedly changed a lot, however I found it to be fantastic - moist, flavorful, and not overly sweet... great autumn recipe!

I made this bread (as jumbo muffins) on the first day of cool fall weather in Chicago. They tasted as great as they smelled baking. I used half whole wheat and half all purpose flour and I added 1/2 cup of bittersweet chocolate chips - a total necessity. Also, I replaced the buttermilk with plain, no-fat yogurt. I gave half away and kept half for myself. I can't wait to make them again.

Great pumpkin bread. Two loaves gone in about a day. I used fresh pumpkin and added raisins since I didn't have enough dried cranberries.

This was very good. I made it the first time as bread, exactly as written. Then(as I had leftover pumpkin and buttermilk) I made it again as muffins- 350 degrees for 25 minutes. I added crystalized ginger bits to the batter as I ran out of cranberries. It was terrific both times.

Nice texture, moist but a little bland. I think I would add more pumpkin pie spice next time. Didn't have enough dried cranberries so I use fresh ones as well. I think the fresh ones worked better. I also don't think the parchment is necessary..I used a silicone baking pan..came out beautifully.

Having a tendency toward experimetation in the kitchen, I did make a few substitutions in this recipe. I also made a few errors in quantity. Here's what I did: added extra ginger with pp spice, used the full stick of butter, 2/3 c. sugar, extra pumpkin (yogurt containter from the freezer), approx. 1/3 c. low-fat vanilly yogurt instead of buttermilk, apple juice sweetened cranberries, plus a handful of mini chocolate chips. Skipped the waxed paper step entirely--used a buttered silicone pan with no problems at all. Some significant changes, I know. It yielded what was perhaps an even more dense loaf. Overall, however, we liked the combination of flavors, especially with addition of chocolate. I plan on making it again, using correct proportions of butter, pumpkin and buttermilk. May also tinker with some crystallized ginger or chopped orange peel. Give it a try...

Taste wise this loaf was excellent with a delicate after-taste that reminded me of happy days as a child. I added 2 tablespoons of dark strap molasses to the recipe, however it resulted in some clumpage. Despite this minor inconvenience, the taste was superlative. Even my admonishing mother liked it.

Yummy! Used self-rising flour in a medium-sized loaf pan. Nice & moist, not too dense. Can't wait to try with cranberry (used raisins this time). Put Cinnamon, ginger, clove & allspice...Not bland at all. Gave 4 forks assuming fresh cranberries would set it apart as such.

This was an excellent bread. For once, a bread I made came out "moist." All the recipes say "moist" but mine never come out that way. I followed it exactly except didn't have buttermilk and used non-fat plain yogurt instead. Maybe that is why it was so good? I also added a handful of chocolate chips. Next time I will do just walnuts and choc chips. I think that if you had the time, fresh cranberries would be good too. The dried were too dry for me. Otherwise, this is an EXCELLENT recipe.

"Dense, moist and delicious" -- the intro says it all. For me, it was a bit too heavy. I'd serve it to company, but I prefer the Spiced Pumpkin Bread on the site for a snack.
