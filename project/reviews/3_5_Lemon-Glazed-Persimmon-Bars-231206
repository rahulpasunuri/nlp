I've made this several times with very soft Fuyu persimmons. It is more cakelike, but that does not detract from its bar cookieness. This time used a mixture of dates and dried cranberries and made the glaze with blood orange juice rather than lemon juice. Yummy!

These came out good, like a spice cake. The persimmon is not really featured as prominently as one might hope; the puree/pulp just blends into the cake. I don't like dates so I used dried blueberries (with pecans, as called for), and I think it worked well. I also reduced the sugar by 1/3 cup and that was fine. Mine was not dry at all - very moist.

I'm not sure why the previous reviewer found it to be dry. Mine, made to the recipe, were moist and delicious. I used very ripe Fuyu persimmons from my tree and pureed the pulp rather than strain it. Persimmons have a mild taste and are very sweet when very ripe. For that reason, I only used 3/4 cup of sugar. Everyone who ate them raved about them, even my husband who usually doesn't like sweets. Great recipe for muffins also.

Definitely a cake. A very dry cake, but a cake, not a bar. This reminds me of the spice cookies my grandma used to make. All I could taste was the clove and cinnamon, not the persimmons at all. Too bad. I had 3 persimmons from my CSA basket and used them all up on this recipe. Still, it's not bad, just not very special or persimmon-y.

This is a delicious recipe. We added chopped almonds which were very good, but my biggest recommendation is to spend a little more and get Meyer Lemons for the glaze. We also made these as mini loafs vs. bars and it worked just great.

I followed this recipe exactly and the bars were delicious! When in season, I freeze persimmon pulp as they ripen so I have it on hand. Fantastic way to celebrate seasonal produce and lovely to the eye!

These were a major letdown. The cloves were overpowering (and I love cloves) and the persimmon did not shine through as a result.

Just terrific. I only had 2 hachiya persimmons but was able to achieve the 1 cup needed for the recipe. Delicious, and different.

I agree that these were definitely more of a thin cake than a bar, but that doesn't change their deliciousness. They were a lovely combination of sweet, spicy, and tart. I used Fuyu persimmons, which worked just fine. I simply peeled them and put them in the food processor. This recipe is great for using up the persimmon crop off of the old tree.

This Recipe is exceptionally good with organic evaporated canes juice and organic powdered sugar. It is a great seasonal recipe that requires patience so wait until the Hachiya persimmons are so ripe that they become translucent.

My parents have a large Hachiya persimmon tree in their back yard and we can never figure out what to make with all of those squishy persimmons. This is the first recipe that I am wild about. It's an amazing recipe as-is, and I've made it several times already. I have just made it again and decided to cut the sugar by 1/3 of a cup. It does not compromise the integrity of the bar at all...and let me tell you, you won't miss that extra sugar. I use walnuts because I personally like the stronger nut flavor, and it's a hit at every home I bring it to during the holiday season.

These bars are wonderful. The persimmon, baking soda and lemon made a nice gel to hold the bars together. I used Fuyu persimmons and they worked well.

I've made this twice, and it turned out delicious both times. It's moist and sweet-tart and a great use of the masses of ripe persimmons I've amassed. My only suggestion is to be sure the batter is quite level before putting the bars in the oven -- the batter didn't level itself at all and turned out uneven both times.

Wow, thank you for this recipe, it came out so delicious, moist and not too sweet. It was luscious without the icing, but I put in on anyway. I added just a little more Persimmon and used a little less of each spice.

Delicious. Moist, spicy, lemony - Yum! Had them for Christmas holidays because that's when the persimmons are ripe around here. Also, used Myer lemons. Nice addition to the usual mix of Christmas cookies and bars. Would definitely make again.

This was delicious! I used the 9x13 pan (did not have a 15x10) and used raisins like suggested earlier. I increased time by 4 more minutes. I had a bag full of fresh persimmons and wanted to make something unusual - I'd definitely make this again!

Absolutely delicious! I substituted golden raisins for the dates, and added an extra half teaspoon cinnamon and 1 teaspoon ground ginger. Perfect.

Definitely much more like a cake than a bar, but still good.

This was amazing. I needed more than three persimmons, but luckily the area where I am a police officer is full or trees bursting with fruit. The people in this area are glad to give them away by the boxful. Recipes are hard to come by. I made these in a 9x13 pan, because I had one, and the second time I used a little more puree than one cup. Excellent results. I also needed more lemon juice for the glaze. If you use a 9x13 pan, just watch for baking time. Enjoy!

I was expecting a firmer "bar" than the moist cake-like product that this made, but as long as dessert is what you're wanting, this is a great way to have it. I add more spice and cut the (medjool) date chunks around 1/2"x1/2"x1/4" to keep them from becoming gooey mush. The lemon glaze, especially with the zest, is a great touch. I am especially glad I added some ginger powder, since it compliments the lemon glaze noticeably. Five spice powder also works well if you are missing one of the components (I didn't have cloves on hand). In any case, great recipe, perfect proportions on things like the baking soda, lemon juice, etc. (and it works with either kind of persimmon as long as it's very, very ripe and soft, and I'd imagine pumpkin pulp would work as well). Timing was also precise-18 minutes wasn't quite done enough, 20 was perfect for me (and my oven therm. read exactly 350).

Now this is a super recipe we especially liked the lemon glaze we also added just a touch more spice

I've tried numerous recipes for my unfashionable Hachiya persimmons (why are there so many more recipes for the Fuyu variety??) and this one was a winner. I used pecans and, per the suggestion of a previous writer, left the dates in larger chunks. The bars were moist and delicious with a wonderful sweet-and-sour bite.

We found these cake-like "bars" to be a little too sweet, and lacking any hint of the persimmon flavor. Texture was ok. Could use a little more spice.

Good persimmon recipes are hard to find. Be sure you are using the very soft Hachiya persimmon and not Fuyu. This one worked out well and I am sharing it with my mother-in-law, among others, to use the abundance of persimmons we get off two trees in the fall. Very nice, moist, spice type cake. I didn't have dates so I used raisins instead. The glaze adds a nice touch.

Definitely worthwhile and quite easy. This intrigued me, as we have amazing persimmons this time of year in Rome and I've never made anything with them. It's very good, very Thanksgiving-y with all the spices, and could probably be made just as well in a smaller, round cake pan. Next time I will try leaving more chunks of fruit, dates and nuts: everything was so well-blended that it was hard to distinguish the flavor of the persimmons and dates. The lemon glaze is a fabulous addition and really kicks it up a notch.
