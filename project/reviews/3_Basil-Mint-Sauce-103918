This tastes like summer. I used this sauce to recreate an appetizer I had at a party. It was a large salt and pepper kettle chip, a dollop of a mint-basil sauce, and a sauted scallop. Delicious!

It is a great recipie if you omit the mayo, add a little crushed garlic, and use goat's milk yogurt if you can find it. I use this sauce for alot of things from scallops to lamb skewers.

Nothing special. Believe it or not, it didn't have much taste. Wouldn't make again.

I liked this. Made it a couple of hours early and used it with the seared sesame scallops recipe, with couscous and peas, all of which can be made pretty quickly

This sauce was good--not thrilling, but good. I did not use it on the scallops for which it was originally intended, but used it on fish. My husband described it as an "elegant tartar sauce" because the mayonnaise taste is quite pronounced.
