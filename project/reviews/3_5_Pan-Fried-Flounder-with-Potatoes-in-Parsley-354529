Although I enjoy making Sole/Flounder with meuniere, this recipe is missing some directions for the potatoes and the requisite sauce. I highly recommend this site's Classic Sole Meuniere recipe.

It was OK. Easy and quick to make but nothing spectacular.

I didn't make the potatoes but the fish was great. I added Old bay seasoning, onion powder and salt to the flour and it flavored this fish perfectly with the butter. I will make this again!

This was simple and quite tasty. I mixed in a little cornmeal with the flour b/c I think it adds a lot to the taste. Dreadful instructions though. How high is the heat for the skillet to cook the fish?! I used medium with cast iron (my dumb electric stove runs hot) and it was a bit much. Fortunately didn't overcook it, but it was dark brown not golden. Secondly, how do you sauté in a casserole??? I used a skillet on medium which worked well, next time I might crank up the heat on the potatoes so they get a little crusty.

Just made this and it was delicious. Cooking flounder this way keeps it from becoming mush. I also did this with tilapia and it was also very good. I just sprinkled lemon pepper and parsley over everything. I tried to skimp on the flour and butter on my first fillet and it didn't turn out as well, so make sure you are generous with them.

Leftovers? Are you kidding me? I snarf down flounder any way it's cooked. Great fish, great light taste. Will try this this weekend!

Recipe sounds great. BUT, I have a question: Directions call to melt butter in a casserole and add potatoes, etc. R u saying put casserole in the oven (what temp)? My casserole dishes r not to be used on stove top. Explain please.

The only way to enjoy flounder! I have made this numerous times, and it's always delish. Leftovers (if any) make a great sandwich. Yes, I would make it again and again.
