A quick dessert to make and delicious. My 10 year old daughter made it for her 5th grade class (without the Grand Marnier). Most of the kids were asking for seconds and thirds! I might try adding a small bit of melted butter to the crust next time; it was a bit crumbly. This is a great, easy recipe!
