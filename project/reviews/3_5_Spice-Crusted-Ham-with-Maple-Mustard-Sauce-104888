This was tasty, but I did miss having some sweetness to the ham (although the maple mustard sauce certainly does go beautifully with this). So I think I'll probably be going back to a glaze of some sort next year, but this was definitely worth checking out.

Loved the spiced ham...and have used this on a pork roast as well as a beef roast with equal success. However, I truly don't understand the other comments about the accompanying sauce...thought that it was horrid.

Really delicious--I've made it for Easter a couple of times now. Also, really easy, which I love since it's a special occasion dinner. The mustard sauce is delicious and really compliments the ham. I gave the recipe to a friend--she and her family loved it.

Wow - what a hit, and easy to make. Was feeding some very fussy eaters who don't usually eat ham, and they loved it. Wasn't to impressed with the Maple Mustard Sauce, and will try whole grain mustard next time.

A major hit! I was a little bit nervous about serving this for Thanksgiving dinner since several members of my family are honey-baked fanatics, but they were the ones who raved the most! It was universally rated "fabulous". Everyone liked the sauce a lot, too --although it was absolutely icky-looking. (Luckily, we were eating in the very late afternoon by candlelight. Would hesitate to serve it in broad open daylight. lol)

I made this for Thanksgiving...and it went twice as fast as the turkey! My husband has asked for it on every special occasion since.

I served this for a large party and everyone raved that it was the best ham they had ever had. I used a hickory-smoked ham, but the secret was definitely the rub! It was really easy, too!

This is probably the best recipe I've come across for a whole ham. The sauce is fabulous and won rave reviews from everyone at Easter. P.S. I love this site and may never pick up a cookbook again!!

Made this for Easter dinner, and what a crowd pleaser it was! Every one commented on how beautiful the ham looked before it was carved. The sauce was fabulous, however I went heavier on the maple syrup than the dijon. Will make it again, and again--it is such an easy recipe!

A great break away from sweet glazes. The only substitution I made was using ground coriander (couldn't find whole ones at the last minute)--it was still fantastic. The maple mustard sauce was also every bit as good as more elaborate versions I've made in the past. Don't know exactly how much difference it made, but I did the sauce before the ham and covered it so the flavors would blend in the meantime. This spice crust would also be a great rub for steak.

Wow! This was a delicious ham. I couldn't find whole multi-peppercorns or whole coriander seeds at the last moment, but used ground white pepper and ground coriander with the cracked black pepper. It still turned out marvelous. The mustard maple syrup side sauce adds the perfect contrast to the spicey crust on the ham. We even roasted some pineapple in the pan, which picked up some of the pepper spice too! Enjoyed with a well aged Bordeaux, this meal made our Easter dinner Heaven on Earth!

This recipe is outstanding. I had to send leftovers home with everybody. The sauce is the perfect complement to the spice rub. I did cook it a bit longer than stated as I didn't think it had browned enough. Will definitely make again.

Made this for easter dinner to serve 12 guests, everyone loved it. In the future I would use less salt. I wouldnt bother with the sauce next time but others enjoyed it.

I made this ham for Easter and it was great! I didn't think I would like the sauce but it was wonderful on the ham.
