If I make this again, I would cut back on the flour in the crust because it turned out thick and dry. The red wine caramel sauce was uninspiring and too sweet. The custard part of the recipe was very good. I think that next time I'll serve this tart with whipped cream.

I have made this three times and each time it has come out beautifully and delicious. No soggy, insipid crust here. And I really like the extra flavor in the crust with the ground almonds and spices, so different from your basic pie crust. Haven't perfected the caramely texture of the sauce, but the flavor is fantastic.

I wanted something for Thanksgiving besides pumpkin pie, so I tried this recipe. Boy am I glad I did a test!! I make a lot of tarts using Epicurious recipes, and this one is the only failure. First, the almond crust did not measure up to classic pate sucre and pate brise crusts, fancy names for pie crusts with or without sugar, that I've made in texture or taste. While the edges were crispy, the middle tasted like a soggy cookie. Second, the filling seemed bland, and not nearly as good as other pumpkin pie filling recipes that I've used. Third, I agree with the other reviewer who said that the tart seems pretty ordinary. However, a tart crust is easier to make than a pie crust because you can press the dough into the tart pan and don't have to worry about rolling it out perfectly. And if you have tart pan with a removable bottom, you can present it elegantly on a platter. But, I'd use another recipe! This tart just tasted yucky! I'm going to make a souffle instead.

Smooth, creamy, and perfect for my sister's fall baby shower! The almond crust adds a special touch compared to the usual pumpkin pie. Although the red wine caramel sauce didn't turn out as I hoped. I was thinking it would be more of a sauce to serve over the tart. By the time I let the caramel cool enough to eat, it was hard as a rock! It may work better if serving indivisual pieces and use the caramel just for garnishing.

I made it with homemade pumpkin to rave reviews. Had enough crust and filling left over to make two 4" tarts. Served with vanilla ice cream but will try the wine sauce next time.

I made this for Thanksgiving to rave reviews. The red wine caramel sauce is to die for. It also goes very nicely on plum pudding (some might argue better than hard sauce). I would add extra cardamom to the crust next time. I followed the adivce of many and doubled the filling--this is not necessary, I had too much left over, even to make individual tarts. Excellent recipe!

This pie was good, but nothing exceptional. After the rave reviews, I was going to make it for Thanksgiving. However, it really doesn't taste much different to me than most pumpkin pies. It had a nice flavor and looked elegant - but nothing extraordinary. (I didn't make the sauce, so maybe that was needed.)

This was prepared for a gourmet club. It was a huge success. The sauce was wonderful. We were fighting over who would get the leftovers.

This was rich, however very good. Flavour was superiour to any other pumpkin pie recipe I have tried to date, and all at my Thanksgiving table loved it. I would forgo the sauce since it was too heavy for this pie and serve it whith maple or carmel flavoured whipped cream.
