This is a pretty easy crust. I know 'cause I've never made pie/tart crust before and mine turned out quite passable! I used rice as pie weight. And the bottom needs a good thorough pricking with a fork, else bubbles WILL develop after removing the pie weight to brown the crust.

If you use pie weights you won't have any of the "puffiness".

I see I rated the crust rather than the filled end result. Sorry.--The crust puffed more than expected, but settled down with fork pricks. Ha!

This was easy and good. Our dinner club used the whole menu for a great meal.
