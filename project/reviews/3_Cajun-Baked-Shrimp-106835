Ok, so some said yes, others not so much, and I'm with the previous party. WOW! I did use the bottled dressing (ugh,but no time to whip up my own,) and it came out wonderfully! I even used the mint - not too weird b/c it wasn't that strong. I used 4lbs of shrimp and eyeballed the rest of the ingrediants and my only issue was that it took about 35 min to cook, and then I overcooked the lil' guys a bit. No matter! All my guest were thrilled and so were those who got leftovers only. DO make sure to have some good quality, crusty bread to soak up that juice. We WILL make this again - so much easier than my regular 47-step recipe.

this is a great dish for a crowd - especially if you don't have the time/inclination to spend all day in the kitchen. The mint is good! It imparts a subtle "what is that?" kind of flavor. Easy, quick, delicious - what more can you ask?

bottled salad dressing is disgusting... but the dish was good, i just made my own dressing and proceeded from there... i lived in Alabama for a number of years, and it seems like a real southern thing to use "low rent" ingredients in what they consider "gourmet" cooking.

I thought this was pretty good, I skipped the Mint like a number of people suggested, but added Rosemary to it. It was a little strong on lemon and not as spicy as I thought it would be. I'll try it again but will cut down the lemon and add more Cayenne, and perhaps some other spices as well.

Just made this for the boss & his wife. They raved about it! Serve with foccacia to sop up the juices. My only changes: substitute olive oil for the butter and add 1/2 t. of cayenne pepper to the marinade.

It had all the right ingredients but just didn't work for me. Flavor didn't work for the shrimp.

I made this last night for my husband and me. I had to cut the recipe quite a bit for two, but it worked out well. I also substituted rosemary for mint, which was a really good call by another reviewer. Next time though, I will probably just peel the shrimp before baking since it's just the two of us. For a group at a summer cookout, I would leave the shells on for fun. Also, I made rice, which ended up soaking up too much of the sauce so there was nothing to dip the bread in. Next time, I won't make the rice. Oh, and I added a pressed garlic clove to the sauce right before dumping the shrimp in to marinate. Yum!

I'd love to try this recipe based on the reviews but I'm in Italy where Italian dressing doesn't exist. (Don't you just love that?) Is there someone out there who wouldn't mind giving me the main ingredients off a label of Italian dressing so I can try to duplicate the dressing/spices on my own. Thanks in advance!

Growing up in Louisiana as a poor young child, we couldn't afford to throw away the head of the shrimps. When we couldn't eat them, we found other uses for them. For example, we sewed strings onto them and made "Godzilla of the Sea" finger puppets. Then we sneaked up to grandma and scare the lights out of her. I cringe every time I pass by a toy store and see how expensive toys are these days. I agree with the cook from Pasadena that you should omit the mint. It gives me the hives. At least that's what I believe that I have... the mysterious rashes developing as I speak. Suggestions anyone?

I fixed this recipe for dinner tonight and it was good but not great. Having said that, I did alter it and peeled the shrimp before cooking so it would be less messy during dinner. Also, I used the suggestion of substituting rosemary for the mint. It made a lot of sauce so I was glad that I served it over rice. I thought it was easy and good, although my husband was less thrilled with it.

I love mint, but my husband will not try anything with mint in it. But I also couldn't get the connection between mint and cajun so I took the advice and substituted rosemary. Great dish...so easy. It will definitely make it into my "make at the beach house" file.

The mint totally freaked me out, so I abandoned any thought of using it. What you really need to do with a recipe like this is consider the recommended ingredients and then omit, add or substitute others based on your past cooking experience and taste preferences. Fortunately, I had the foresight to write to two of the reviewers who hail form New Orleans, and they were kind enough to pass along their suggestions for altering the recipe in order to achieve a true Cajun taste experience. Yum tum, and fun to eat! It did give me the heebie jeevies to yank the legs off of the little guys prior to marinating them, but ya gotta do what ya gotta do. Now that I have read about using the discarded shrimp heads as sea monster finger puppets, I will seriously reconsider the use of beheaded shrimpers in the future.

This is really tasty! I omitted the mint and used rosemary and some other spices. I don't like shrimp heads so I used headless, de-veined shrimp with the shells on. I let everyone peel their own shrimp and put a big bowl on the table for the shells. I was suprised how easy this was to make.

We absolutely loved this recipe! We didn't exactly think of it as Cajun with all that mint, but none the less, it was a great recipe - just misnamed. Having bread for dipping into the sauce really made the recipe. We made individual size loaves of french bread for the dipping. It was quick and easy, with no last minute work when guests are there. I'll definitely be serving it to many guests. I'll have to try it with shrimp with the heads on next time.

I was raised in New Orleans. In our family, barbequed shrimp was a huge treat! After baking the shrimp with the shells on (I've never seen it done otherwise when making this dish!)we shelled the shrimp (as anyone with any sense would do!), devoured our shrimp and then dipped French bread in the leftover marinade. It was FABULOUS! Y'all need to lighten up for goodness sake! Concerning the recipe at hand, I've never used mint. Traditionally lots of rosemary is common.

I thought this recipe was excellent..since I did not want the mess of shells I used raw shelled/deveined shrimp..it was luscious..and I served some wild rice mix on the side..Yummy!

I, too, am from New Orleans and have our own family recipe for BBQ shrimp. The original recipe was developed at Palcal's Manale restaurant. Mint is out of the question, but we do use thyme and basil, and the secret is to use a little rosemary in the recipe. Head-on shrimp are a must. They keep the shrimp from getting tough; plus, the fat of the shrimp is in the head area, which adds to the flavor of the dish. I don't use the Italian dressing, but a lot of people here do. You may laugh at our habits all you wish, but you have to admit, people in Louisiana do know how to eat... Bon appetit, and e-mail if you want to try our family recipe.

Hi, just have to weigh in on this subject as I have lived in N.O. for 25 yrs. and have taken many cooking classes and consumed many wonderful meals! Barbecued shrimp usually has lots of butter(at least 2 sticks) and bottled Italian dressing is not uncommon. It adds a zest to the finished product. The shells and sometimes the heads add a flavor, so don't be put off. People from N.O. are very unpretentious about peeling, eating, and creating a mess when eating! Live it up and act like a kid! The only comment I have is a question about the mint--not used in cajun/creole food--let alone 1/2 cup. I would make it w/o that and add as you like. I would be happy to share some recipes for this if emailed.

Very easy and delicious. I like the flavor of shrimp cooked in shell the shell but not the work afterwards. May try it with cleaned shelled shrimp next time. Personally, I like the idea of using a bottled Italian dressing. But to discard the recipe as a whole because of it's suggested shortcut is to do yourself a disfavor. Make your own dressing if you prefer and give the recipe a try. Also, may I make a suggestion? PLEASE don't rate a recipe if you haven't tried it! Many of us rely on the review rating to decide whether we read the recipe further. I'm glad I didn't on this one. It was worth trying.

This is an excellent dish, similar in flavor to "Jack Shrimp" at a restaurant by the same name in Orange County, California. We adapted the recipe by omitting the mint, adding ample amounts of fresh rosemary and 1 teaspoon ground Chipotle Chili Pepper. Delightful dish, and great for company, just have lots of napkins and bread for dipping in the sauce!

All of the reviews for this recipe definitely piqued my curiousity, so I couldn't help but try it out. My husband really liked it; I thought it was okay and have other shrimp recipes I like better. I used peeled shrimp and baked for about 20 minutes and it turned out fine--I'm not a fan of peeling shrimp during dinner. As for the Italian dressing, I agree with the reviewer who pointed out that this recipe was in the "too busy to cook" section and thus the dressing was one way to save time. The food snobs who scoff at its use need to just chill out and count themselves lucky if they have lots of time every single night to prepare a gourmet meal from scratch with no shortcuts! Italian dressing is a great, no-fuss marinade for chicken breasts baked or on the grill...don't knock it til you try it.

I can't believe that this recipe received so mediocre response. I made it with tiger shrimp and the results were amazing. It was like eating lobster.

We really loved this recipe - didn't have any Italian dressing on hand, so I used a Dijon Vinaigrette - just as good! Next time I would remove the shells first and cook it a little less time, as we thought the shrimp were a tad dry and we weren't into a "messy" dinner.

Rating: 3
My family really liked this, the kids especially loved the "messy eating"! I especially loved the speed in which I could get dinner on the table. Used Newman's Own Light Italian Dressing, which worked well. Next time I might add a bit more Worcestershire sauce and a bit less mint. It was good.

Try this! Melt two sticks butter (I never said it would be low fat), add 1.5 to 2 oz. Worcestershire, 2T black pepper, 1/2 t. ground rosemary, 1t. Tabasco, 1t. salt, 2 cloves garlic, minced and the juice of a lemon. Pour about 1/2 cup into a baking dish, and then make alternating layers with 2 1/2 to 3 lbs shell on shrimp and a thinly sliced lemon. Pour the rest of the sauce over top, and bake at 400 for 15-20 minutes, stirring once or twice. Serve with baguettes and lots of napkins.........

On 7/2502 I made the Cajun Shrimp for my son's birthday and everyone, but me,loved it. I screwed up my nose at using store bought (used Ken's) Ital. Dressing and fresh mint. Followed the rec. exactly as posted above. Next time I will try some modifications suggested by others. One caution****450 deg. at 15 minutes is the maximum or you end up with rubber shrimp. Served with Jasmine rice and it was really wonderful.

This appears to be an attempt to recreate a famous New Orleans dish known as "barbeque shrimp". Get rid of the Italian dressing (use olive oil or butter), the mint (yikes!?), and the hot sauce. Add cayenne, paprika, thyme, parsley, oregano,basil,garlic and onion powder (mixed all together--can use commercial brand of creole seasoning like Tony Chachere's or Zatarain's if you can get it)and LOTS of minced garlic and onion. Bake shrimp (yes, heads and shells on!) in single layer, turning once. Serve with plenty of French Bread to sop up da sauce!

I find this recipe rather bland, not at all like the Cajun food I ate when I lived in Texarcana. It would be better if it had a bit more spiceyness, But I`ll definately make it again with a bit more spice.

Not only would I not make it again, I wouldn't make it in the first place. There's not a bottled salad dressing that's fit to eat. Sheesh. Why not just a little olive oil, wine vinegar and a few seasonings? Anybody ought to be able to handle that, no matter what part of the country they're from.

I think I like the combination, quick and good, I'll give it a try on sat. Though, I might switch the It.dressing: maybe some soy sauce and something else (Thai fish sauce - oyster s.??).

I favor cooking shrimp in their shells because their flavor is much more intense. I do however make a deep cut down their backs which allows the marinade to penetrate and makes it easier to peel (as well as removing the vein). I would add garlic, substitute thyme and oregano for the mint. I grill shrimp marinated in Zesty Italian dressing lemon juice and garlic with great results. In fact, the only time I use bottled Italian dressing is for marinades.

I haven't made this recipe, but feel compelled to respond to the person who was so indignant about using (horrors!) Italian dressing as a marinade. There's not much good I say about my former mother-in-law, but she was a hell of a good cook from New Orleans. She even wrote a cookbook that I still use. One of her secrets was using doctored Italian dressing as a marinade for many things. She even used the oil on top of the dressing to add extra flavor when she sauted. Don't knock it 'til you've tried it.

I cannot believe the rude remarks inspired by this otherwise unremarkable recipe. If you have to make such insulting comments generally applied to all Texans, feel free to stay on your side of the border (and i've always defended my Louisiana neighbors when others bad-mouth them). To the New Yorker, Gulf Shrimp are best cooked with the shells on. They are WAY bigger than shrimp you get in your part of the country and tend to get tough when cooked without shell.

I was very surprised after marinating the shrimp for over 4 hours, this dish was not very flavorfull. Very disappointing.

I have a similar recipe -- recommend that bay leaves be de-stemmed and crushed with a mortar and pestle. Also, pulling off the little shrimp legs makes for easier eating and also gets the marinade under the shell better. Also, adding more chopped garlic, and serve with a crusty bread. Enjoy!
