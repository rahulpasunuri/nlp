Very nice flavor, easy enough to make. I stuffed the chickies with it and it was just delicious.

I wasn't all that crazy about this dish. I love wild rice and brown rice together, but this recipe yielded a rather blend result. I had to add a lot of salt to make it palatable before serving. I also raised the pine nuts to 1/2 cup. I have a lot of leftovers and plan to use the remainder in spinach salads with orange segments and put some into a soup.

I love stuffing. That said, I've never been a fan of rice stuffings. Until now. Perhaps it's because I'm a sucker for pine nuts, but I really enjoyed this recipe. I followed the recipe without modifications. Used homemade stock. If you need more or less 'kick', adjust the amount of pepper. Definitely going to add this to my Thanksgiving menu.
