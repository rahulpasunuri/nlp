I made the sauce as written and grilled a tri tip instead of the steaks. I also made the corn and haricot verts and pickled red onions as written. It was a delicious combination of flavors and our guests loved it, too. I served a Powder Keg Petite Sirah with it and it was a perfect match. I'm making enchiladas with the leftovers.

My daughter asked me to join her and make the whole meal as a birthday celebration: Grilled Steaks w/Red Chile Sauce, Shellfish Ceviche, Heirloom Tomotoes w/bacon, bleu cheese and basil, the Pickled Onions, and Corn & Harricot Verts. Superb meal! The Chile Sauce is fantastic (we used ground cumin instead of cumin seeds because we forgot to buy them and sauce was still great). We couldn't find guajillo chiles at our local 'gourmet' store so had to substitute with Anjo Chiles for the sauce but was still full of flavor and luscious looking on the steaks.I got to use my chinois to finish the sauce (making it very easy) and the consistency and flavors were magical to us. My husband loved it thought it was a fantastic meal. The ceviche was mouth-watering - we loved the watermelon in it. The Harricot Verts and Corn looked great on the plate and were splendid with the steaks. The Heirloom Tomatoes (we bought red, purple, yellow and green)and with the shallot dressing, bleu cheese, basil and bacon -- we were just drooling. We forgot and missed one of the ingredients in the Pickled Onions and had to make-shift (added later) but they were still good-- we're going to make them again soon for a better result. I would make this meal many more times, the sauce 100 times-- so versatile. Hubby asked to have the whole meal for company ASAP!

I will make this sauce again, but not for steak. This is a great enchilada sauce. It was very easy to prepare and the flavor was pretty good.

This sauce is the real deal. Had my Mexican friend over for dinner and she said it tasted like her grandma's. This would make an excellent enchilada sauce. It is wonderful with the ribeyes. I brushed a little sauce on the steaks when grilling and served the rest on the side. The sauce was a bit watery - I wasn't sure if this was the way it was suppposed to turn out. But I made it the day before, refrigerated it and reheated and it didn't seem nearly as watery after that. Had the corn and haricot vert with lime shallot butter which really finished the dish.

Delicious! One tip that I learned from chef Robert del Grande( Cafe Annie ) to balance the bitterness is to add a spoonful or two of maple syrup - it makes all the difference.

If you don't make the pickled onions with this dish it would be just okay, but with them, it is fantastic! I reduced the red chile sauce recipe by 1/3 and that made enough for 2 steaks, and that was plenty. 3-4 dried Guajillo chiles was enough for that. I would not let the negative reviews talk you out of trying this one. If you make all the sauce, you can freeze it so next time won't be so much work.

This wasn't a big hit with us. I did manage to find guajillo chilies at a Mexican specialty store and was surprised at how many it took to add up to 3 oz! While it was a strong and flavorful sauce, it wasn't that much better than canned sauces I have tasted and it took a whole lot more time (better part of 3 hours). Nobody thought it exceptional and I would look for a better recipe.

Sorry to skew the results, but I thought this was so-so and my husband didn't like it at all. Basically you have a steak, some sauce (I did like the sauce but have a recipe for one that's made with New Mexico chile powder... takes five minutes, tastes identical to this one) and some onions in vinegar!

This is a fantastic recipe. Definitly not too spicy, very flavorful. It made more than enough sauce -- planning on trying it with pasta and perhaps shrimp.

I couldn't find guajillo chiles in my local store and a friend told me about 888eatchile.com where you can get all sorts of chiles. I thought if other folks were having a problem finding them, they might want this info as well.

Having read Seattle's concerns, I made this according to the recipe, while making sure that I did not over-toast the cumin seeds, the peppers or the garlic, since it all was going to be cooked further. At first, it was very bitter but the slow reduction took care of that. My husband pronounced this "exciting." The pickled onions are a real piece of cake and an absolute necessity for this recipe. This recipe makes a boatload of sauce. I will try to freeze some of it and also try it on hamburgers and enchiladas. I was born on the Tex-Mex border and like hot and spicy food. While this sauce is not "hot", it may be too much for those who eschew hot peppers. I feel sorry for such folk.

To Seattle cook: Overblending of chiles will bring out that bitterness you metion. That may have been the problem.

First Seattle Cook: My guess would be that the reserved soaking liquid is the culprit of the bitterness. I have made a sauce (without the red peppers) similar to this many times. It is from one of the Rick Bayless cookbooks, and it calls for discarding the soaking liquid and using beef broth in the pureeing step. Also, I marinate the steaks in it overnight and it is delicious!

Hey Seattle cook - I'm a Seattle cook too! The bitterness might be the chiles. Sometimes you can balance it out with some brown sugar or reg. sugar. Could be that over-toasted cumin too! Red Chile Sauce is quite an undertaking when done the traditional way, but if you're up for the challenge, there's a great book 'Rancho Cooking' by Higuerra... a more traditional method vs. this short-cut recipe in Bon Appetite..

I am in the process of cooking the sauce right now, and although I have not tried it with the steak yet, something seems to have gone wrong. The sauce smells wonderful, however, tastes very bitter. I think I may have toasted the cumin seeds too long and this may be the problem.

I made this dish (and the entire menu it appeared with) for guests recently. It was a big hit. The sauce is outstanding - flavorful, complex, spicy but not hot. I tried to think of other things to use it with, but only steak can stand up to it. Really wonderful.

If you have never tried guajillo chiles, you're missing out. They don't have much heat, but instead are far less bitter than ancho chile and in my opnion have a fabulous flavor. The guajillo and the ancho are probably the most-used dried chiles in Mexican Cuisine. Don't let a fear of spicy chiles keep you from this recipe, it's delicious.
