Made these on Christmas Day, with a few changes made after trying original recipe. Changed the mayo to Miracle Whip and added 1/2 - 1 more yolk. Otherwise, pretty good! Be sure to drain lobster very well! KIMBER

verstile, easy to prepare, it definately puts a different slant on the expected taste.
