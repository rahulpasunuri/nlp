Just made this and eating it as I type.... Perfect for a light lunch while working from home! Not sure what the previous reviewer didn't like about the taste, but this recipe's flavor turned out exactly as I imagined it would -- slight bitterness from the greens, spicy hit of red pepper flakes, nutty saltiness of the parmesan, and then the mellow creamy garbanzos underneath it all. Would be cute to make these using the tiny 2" pitas I've seen at Whole Foods for a party appetizer.

Yuck, I made this dish last christmas for my family and we were all dissapointed. When it was finished, it looked delicious, the taste was far from that though. I am sorry to say this recipe was a dissapointment.
