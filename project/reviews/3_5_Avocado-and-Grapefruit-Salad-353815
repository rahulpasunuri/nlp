I used a little roasted almond oil and another tablespoon of olive oil infused with blood orange. Terrific.

I used the sesame oil also instead of the Walnut oil. Thanks for the suggestion gellygarcia from Salinas!

Company really like this interesting change in a salad. I added crumbled feta, julienne basal leaves, slivered almonds. I used sugar to taste instead of verjus. I didn't have pink grapefruit therefore it wasn't as sweet so the sugar in the dressing helped with the tartness of the grapefruit.

I love love love this salad. I added red onions and bacon crumbles to it (takes a little health out of it). The crunch of the bacon is a great blend with the creamy avocado. I look forward to summer so i can make this bad boy!

Delish! Also used rice vinegar inplace of the verjus and sesame oil inplace of walnut as previous reviewers suggested. Turned out very yum. Takes a little time to segment the grapefruit but you'll become a pro after this. Squeezed out all the extra juice from the grapefruit pit to add to the dressing and had a lot of dressing leftover (used it to as a sauce for fish the next day). It's a keeper!

Excellent recipe and quick and easy to make. We added shrimp as another reviewer suggested and substituted romaine for the butter lettuce. Delicious!

Delicious! Made pretty much as written, just took another reviewer's advice and used sesame oil and rice vinegar and used a little more lettuce, but proved to be a hit at my dinner party. Salads are usually the last thing to go, if at all, and the whole thing was gone quickly!

Very good. Light & refreshing. Dressing was mild and pleasantly flavored.

A nice summery-tasting salad that you can make in the dead of winter. Next time I will add either (real) bacon bits or a big scoop of jumbo lump crab meat. Shrimp, as another reviewer suggested, sounds good too.

I used 1 T apple juice instead of the grape juice, finely chopped green onion instead of the shallots, all olive oil, two small grapefuits, a mango and an avocado. It was outstanding and served 2 very generously.

The flavors in this salad and dressing are delicious. I'll definitely make again, but I prefer more lettuce. The amount of lettuce suggested is really only enough for about 3 people, while there's enough avocado and grapefruit to feed 10! For 3, I used 1 head of butter lettuce, 1 grapefruit, and 1 avocado.

I changed the recipe a bit, and would give my version 2.5 stars. I used white balsamic vinegar and walnut oil. I also used romaine lettuce, but it was too crisp for this recipe. Butter, spinach, mache or argula would be much better. After tasting, I thought the salad needed something, so I added slivers of pickled ginger which worked great. This was decent enough, but I wasn't esp. dazzled by the flavor combo. I'll try it again. Till then, I'll blame my produce, rather than the recipe.

excellent combination. Out of this world with shrimp added for luncheon main course

This is a very good side salad. I would have never paired grapefruit with avocado, but they are delicious together. Although this recipe is marked as healthy, pay attention to the portion sizes. The oil and avocado have a lot of calories, so this is probably not the best choice if you're looking for a salad to eat as a meal.

I made this salad again except I added fresh peaches and used spring mix greens. I love the mild sweetness that the peaches bring to the dish.

I loved this and improvised just a bit with the approach to the lettuce and made it a bit of a "mixed" salad, but it was terrific and a great summer salad. Next time I'll mix the oils and shallots a day ahead because I used the left over oil the next day as a dipping sauce with a baguette and the flavors had really combined nicely!

I made this recipe exactly. I absolutely love it. I have never been a big avocado fan (in North Texas we usually only make guacamole). However, this makes me want to find other ways to incorporate avocado. Next time I will pair it up with Sockeye.

Loved this! Couldn't find the verjus, so I used white balsamic vinegar instead. Other than that substitution, I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased. Oh, I did squeeze some of the grapefruit juice into the dressing. Made this to go with the crème fraîche roasted salmon. Delicious combination of flavors.

I didn't spring for the walnut oil, nor the fancy juice. I used rice vinegar and sesame oil and thought this was divine. I also added some leftover grilled chicken, but think it would be heavenly with salmon.

This is a wonderful salad! The only downside is the price of walnut oil- $29. And the grapefruit is a little time consuming.

Yummy, light summer salad. Very good with the bay leaf salmon. When I separated the grapefruit I did so over a bowl and used the juice in the dressing.

the recipes are excellent. But healthy recipes should have nutritional information. So many people with different diseases could enjoy it.

This is one of my favorite combinations..

I haven't tried it but would like to know why would you rinse an avacado? I would think it wouldn't do it any good.
