I was really happy with this recipe, though, I used around 1/3 - 1/2 cup water at the end as the 1/4 cup evaporated quite quickly, even with the lid on. Also, I used a pair of sharp-tipped kitchen shears to make the X and found it much easier than using a knife (and I consider my self fairly skilled with a knife). I did find that the inner shell/skin still stuck a bit and tried the tip about microwaving them for 20 seconds once they've cooled and found that it worked pretty well. Very happy over all!

After reading several techniques for roasting AND ease of shelling, I choose this one with modifications. I soaked the whole nuts in boiling water for 30 minutes after cutting thru shells; drained thoroughly. Then I proceeded as written. Things of beauty and will add that extra taste to my stuffing.

Nice and simple recipe. I followed one of the reviewer's method of baking them in the oven at 400 degrees for 30 mins (I did use some oil). I also found cutting the chestnuts (with a regular knife) laborious. The chestnuts where my "X" cut through to the flesh were drier than the ones where only the shell was cut. Cutting the chestnuts were time consuming but they turned out quite nicely.

Delicious, but I now understand why most people buy jarred chestnuts. I found these very high maintenance. My finger was numb from cutting the "X" before I was even halfway through. And there has to be a trick to removing that pesky inner shell - can someone share it with me? I wish these were easier - I'd make them much more often.

Simple/perfect. TIP: After allowing the chestnuts to cool, reheat or microwave for 20 seconds and the inner skin slips off with the warm shell. (I had no problems with the roasting, when using a nonstick pan without oil.)

I will always add fresh roasted chestnuts to my stuffing thanks to this easy recipe

After puncturing the shell, I just place a dozen or so chestnuts on a shallow baking pan and put in the toaster oven for about 30 minutes at 400 degrees. After cooling about five minutes, they are easy to peel and it's easier to get inner husk off.

There's no recipe that I can think of that is as basic as this one and that produces so much pleasure for those who get to enjoy the results. I go without oil at the beginning and water at the end -- the chestnuts are all you need! This is how, as a kid, I remember street vendors prepared them on cold winter days in northern Italy.

Good and quick way to roast chestnuts. I roast chestnuts once a year for stuffing at Thanksgiving and I'll use this method next time. Like another reviewer, though, I had a lot of trouble getting the chestnuts out of the inner shell.

I love chestnuts. But every time (including this recipe) the fuzzy part of the shell sticks to the chestnuts. Is there anything I can do to make it stop doing it?

Quick and easy, just what roasting chestnuts should be about. Great with some Prosecco or Beaujolais Villages Nouveau. I would have given this the full 4 forks however, it needed a "bit" mote water at the end to ensure tender chestnuts. As for the review "A Cook from S.C. on 11/27/03" I have two things to say: - recipe did recommend cast-iron in the Equipment section - charred nuts are a sign that the shaking of the pan was insufficient. Nuts should not be left to sit for too long on the skillet when on direct heat. Cheers!

Amazingly easy. I used a very sharp chef's knife to make the X and had no problems. Warning: there is a lot of smoke involved in the roasting process, so use a fan or open window.

I did not doas good a job as I could have. I am trying them again this year and over the open fire. I will make deeper cuts in the nuts and take my time with them.

Great easy recipe! Everyone loved this as a "nosh" during the afternoon of Thanksgiving...before the big meal. I think everyone had fond memories of roasting chestnuts with their families over the fireplace as children. I would recommend atleast doubling the cooking time in the water and making them early as they really have to cool well before anyone could shell them.

It was good to see how easy they were to prepare--but your recipe should have recommended a cast iron skillet. I am still scrubbing my brand new all clad skillet and will be for another few days.

My dad has been roasting chestnuts since I was a kid, but this recipe was so much quicker and easier! The chestnuts came out perfectly! Just make sure you score them well so that they're easier to peel.

GROWING UP, OUR THANKSGIVING AND CHRISTMAS S' WERE SPENT WITH OUR GRANDMOTHER, AUNTS AND UNCLES. THE ONE THING THAT WAS CONSTANT WAS THAT OUR GRANDMA ALWAYS HAD ROASTED CHESTNUTS FOR THE FOUR KIDS AMONG ALL OF THE ADULTS. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN YOUR RECIPE IS NO OIL OR WATER WAS USED. A HOLE WAS PUNCHED OR THE TOP CUT OFF OF EACH CHESTNUT AND HEATED IN CAST IRON SKILLET FOR ABOUT 30 MINS. AND SHOOK A COUPLE OF TIMES DURING THEIR ROASTING TO KEEP THEM FROM BURNING.

Simple recipe for an oldtime favorite. The second time I made it I added a 1/2 teaspoon of liquid smoke to the water. It added a whole new dynamic.
