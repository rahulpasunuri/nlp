This recipe makes the Häagen-Dazs® Dulce de Leche seem icy and tasteless in comparison. We used Dulce de Leche we brought back from a recent trip to Argentina and the smooth and delicious taste reminded us of our trip. Like many others, we also omitted the pecans. I added chocolate chips right at the end and the chocolate and caramel combo was to die for.

Fantastic ice cream, easy to make and delicious! I served at a dinner party with caramelized pears from another recipe in Epicurus. It was a huge hit and my family made me make more the following day. Don't skip the roasted pecans!

Even using "homemade" dulce de leche (wasn't paying attention at the store and accidentally bought regular sweetened condensed milk instead of dulce de leche), this ice cream turned out perfectcreamy, caramely, delicious. Such a bonus that's the recipe is so easy, especially if you're smart and actually buy readymade dulce de leche and don't have to boil a can of sweetened condensed milk for 3 hours!

This ice cream came out absolutely delicious. Very creamy, and the texture didn't suffer too much after being frozen overnight. I only made one major change. Instead of using pecans, I got some Goya Maria cookies (dulce de leche flavored), broke them into large chunks, and stuck them on top before serving. Just wonderful.

unbelievably delicious, made exactly as written.

This is quite possibly the best ice cream anywhere, ever. Though the Salted Caramel Ice Cream recipe comes a blindingly close second.

One of the best ice creams we have ever made. We used Coronado Cajeta Quemada for the dulce de leche because it is locally available. In addition we sprinkled the toasted pecan on top and served it with a fried cinnamon sugar wonton.

Very good for an egg-free ice cream. Still really smooth. I don't think I would call it 'too sweet' but maybe just barely. I realized after the fact that my tub of dulce de leche was 500g (or about 17.6 ounces), a bit over a pound, but it still works. I omitted the pecans because I'm allergic to them, and also because I've always hated nuts in ice cream. It's still delicious without!

One of my favorite ice cream recipes and the *only* non-custard ice cream I will make at home, since the dulce de leche ensures a wonderfully creamy texture.

I knew I'd seen "La Salamandra" dulce de leche somewhere, and even after taveling to three different cities in an effort to find it, I had to settle on the Nestle. Apparently the excessive driving made me loopy, 'cause I ended up putting two cans of the Nestle into the mixture... As other reviews had mentioned, it was sweet (that's for sure), but even with my mistake, it wasn't sickeningly so; the caramel flavor was just more pronounced, and not as delicate as it could have been. All in all, the flavor was good, as was the texture. In the dish, it stayed firm a good while, still leaving a pleasant amount of "meltiness."

I did not have whole milk available, so I used one cup 2% milk and 2 cups normal cream. I thought 1 pound dulce de leche seemed excesive so I used 270 grams - which was one jar. As I like a creamy ice cream I added 4 egg yolks and made a custard. All in all a nice recipe but next time I would use less dulce de leche to make the ice cream less sweet.

My son and I made this twice. The first time with 80% of a can of Nestle brand dulce de leche. The results were good. A week later we made it again, using the whole can this time. Also, we let the milk simmer for about 5 minutes, barely bubbling. This made a huge difference in the texture, and this batch was truly amazing! My husband, a professional cook, said I should simmer it for like 15 minutes, but I didn't have the patience. Also, the Nestle can is slightly less than the amount called for. It's sweet, but not nearly as sweet as Haagen Daas or any commercial ice cream.

Great recipe..I could only find the Nestle brand and I think it made the ice creamer sweeter than it should have been, so next time will cut down on the dulce de leche if using Nestle. I added chopped toasted walnuts and chopped toffee chocolate bar - very nice. Thanks

This is very very good! I was only able to find the nestle dulce de leche, and it worked great. The ice cream was very creamy, caramelly and not too sweet. The addition of the toasted pecans is genius, however, they can loose their crunch. Melted dark chocolate swirled in during the churning process would work nicely too.

To rsc1157 of LA who was looking for a good ice cream maker: I got tired of being frustrated with the icecream makers that we generally see around as they always required hours of advance freezing , then never stayed cold enough during the freezing process to do the job properly. So I went on line and found a Gelato Chef 2200 Italian ice cream maker which I have been using for 3 years now and LOVE. Has a built-condenser which gets the container very cold and, more importantly, keeps it cold. Takes about 30 minutes to freeze properly (it lets you know when done) and makes a much a better consistency ice cream than previous makers.$299 but worth the price if you love making gourmet ice creams as I do.

Absolutely delicious! And the active "cooking" time was all of the three minutes it took to set up the ice cream machine. A definite keeper.

I just served this to my husband who is an admitted ice cream addict. He LOVED it. I put Whole Foods Maple Bourbon Pecans on top. It was so yummy, he went back for seconds.

Excellent recipe. It turned out very creamy and has a great flavor. It was very easy to make and I will make this one again for sure.

So good. So easy. I also made my own dulce de leche by boiling the sweetened condensed milk. I used butter almonds instead of pecans and it was just delish and got rave reviews.

OMG good! Doubled the recipe for a party. Used the ol' boiled can method in a really large full pot of water to make the Dulce de Leche - lazy control freak LOL. Since I used low fat milk and was afraid of icey ice cream I did go the custard route and added a couple of eggs - bringing the whole thing temp and strained before chilling. Made ice cream sandwiches with the Triple-Chocolate Cookie on this site. Over-the-top praise for this one! 2/3 with nuts (my preference) 1/3 without. An unexpected pleasure for my guest who loved, loved, loved them and the presentaiton. (wrapped in wax and tucked inside those newspaper looking bags they sell for Belgian fries). They felt like kids again.

I made it even easier. I combined milk, cream and dulce de leche in the blender, then froze it. I loved the toasted pecans in it. Real good. I made it again with a container of caramel apple dip; mmm. I have a Krups ice cream maker and I love it.

After striking out at our local grocery store's "international aisle," I went to a local "Bodega Latina" to find the dulce de leche. Could only buy Nestle brand, though, which may have been the problem. The ice cream was pretty good - esp. for dulce de leche - but not spectacular ice cream. My husband loved it but I wasn't as excited. It was really easy to make, though. (And I omitted the pecans.)

Fantastic, and easy! Rave reviews at a dinner party. I just boiled a 14 oz can of sweetened condensed milk for about 2 hours, making sure water level remains above the can (be sure to watch this - can can explode if you don't or boil more than 2 hours). Cool can, and use as dulce de leche. I just added 1 tbsp of sugar as the caramel was only about 1 1/8 cups. This was absolutely amazing, and toasting the pecans makes a huge difference.

Not only is it delicious, but it's also incredibly fast & easy to make. I reserved the toasted nuts to sprinkle on top.

This ice cream is delicious and super-easy. The large amount of milk protein from the dulce de leche makes it very creamy and the lack of additional sugar makes it not-too-sweet. The subtle caramel flavor would go great with chocolate, coffee. or orange. This recipe is a keeper.

wonderful! A tiny bit sweet, but still great and very easy to make
