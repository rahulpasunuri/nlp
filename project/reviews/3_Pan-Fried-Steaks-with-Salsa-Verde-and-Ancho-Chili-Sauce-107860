I would not make this recipe again. I wasn't wowed by the spice rub and the salsa verde wasn't amazing. Pretty lackluster flavour in my opinion.

Oh yea, and I forgot to add that I used a different, simple salsa verde recipe I have - I cup packed flat-leaf parsley (stems and all), 1/2 cup packed cilantro with stems, 1/2 cup packed mint with stems, 1 clove garlic, 4 green onions. Place all in blender with 3/4 cup olive oil and salt and blend away.

This was good. The ancho sauce was a big disappointment. Really flat tasting, and I LOVE all the ingredients. It had some spice (could have had more), but not a lot else- odd, I know, given the heavenly ingredients. I made it exactly as written. Steaks with spices and salsa verde were yummy though!

I was very excited about this recipe, but what a dissapointment! the ancho chili sauce was awful, and the salsa verde, although not bad, was a bit on the bland side. I did, however, really enjoy the spice combination on the steaks and will definitely make them again by themselves.

I did not enjoy the flavor of this dish at all. I thought that the Salsa Verde really didn't have much flavor at all and I thought that the ancho chili sauce just had a smokey one deminsional flavor to it. I was not impressed.

This recipe is awesome. My husband has visited Mexico many times and he felt that the dish was very authentic tasting. We liked the green sauce better than the ancho sauce. Nice how the sauces can be made in advance.

I made this for our supper group the other evening and it was a huge hit. The flavors are really fabulous and it is quite simple to make. Do not go looking for pablano chilis in California, however--they are known as pasilla chilis here.

I made this recipe for my fiance for our Valentine's Day since we love spicy food and this dish turned out incredible! Of course, we added more chili!

To the anaheim chili question. They are also called Ortega green chilis and the canned version will work as a subsitute in the salsa verde.

What a way to wow your friends and family. The interplay of flavors between the spicy steak rub and the salsas (one fresh and clean, one smokey) makes this one of my new favorite recipes. The salsas are a bit time consuming but well worth it. I was sad when I licked the last drops of salsa from the bowl the next day!

Delicious. There is lots of flavor, enough to satisfy those of us who like it intense but not too spicy for the fainter palates. I grilled the meat with some hickory chips, which added even more interest. The salsa recipes made a lot of extra, so we are continuing to enjoy them both.

Unbelievable. Made it for my boyfriend, a big steak eater, and he said it was the best steak he had ever had. The salsa was to die for. The perfect accompaniment.

Where can I get Anaheim chilies on the east coast? The salsa looks great but I don't live in CA. Is there another chili I can use?

We barbecued the steaks and they were wonderful. I don't think I made the ancho chili sauce correctly, though -- given the rave reviews it should have been better. I'm going to try it again to see what I did wrong. The salsa verde, however, was fantastic -- a great basic recipe! I used it today with leftover chicken in a flour tortilla roll!

I agree with the last reviewer who said: Absolutely Delicious!! Don't let the amount of chili's scare you away. The combination of the hot and mild sauces are wonderful with the steak. I pan fried and they rib eyes were ex.! Definitely cook the mashed potatoes with cheddar cheese and poblano chilies, and the carmelized corn with onions and red peppers as suggested in the magazine. Both are wonderful too. A great bottle of fruity Syrah and you're set! My company couldn't stop raving!!!

This was an amazing recipe!! The peppers were a wonderful flavor on the steaks and the sauces were a great accompaniment. I pan fried the steaks and did the pepers in the broiler (they did get the kitchen a bit smoky, but i don't have an exhaust fan). I made the entire menu in this issue and every recipe was beyond delicious.

Absolutely Delicious!! Don't let the amount of chili's scare you away. The combination of the hot and mild sauces are wonderful with the steak. I recommend roasting peppers outside on a BBQ as there is quite an odor. I BBQ steak instead of pan frying. Also cook the mashed potatoes with cheddar cheese and poblano chilies, and the carmelized corn with onions and red peppers as suggested in the magazine. Both are wonderful too. A great bottle of fruity Syrah and you're set!
