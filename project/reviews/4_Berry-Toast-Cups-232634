So simple, quick and delicious! Great finish to a summer meal. My mom can't eat refined sugars, so we simply substituted in organic cane sugar.

Holy cow, who knew something so easy could be so good? Some of the juice runs out as you eat them but somehow that seems to make them even better. I like the subtleness of the bread balances out the sweetness of the berries, a sweeter "crust" would be over kill. Trust me, you'll want to make a double batch because the first one won't last long!

This was absolutely great, unusual, beautiful, and easy. Used an upside down glass instead of cookie cutter, Pepperidge Farm White Bread With Substance. Took the full 35 minutes because it took ten minutes to find the sugar, six minutes to find the Cassis, and 5 minutes to clean up the sugar and Cassis I spilled. The toasts were a real surprise, and I will try them with other recipes. A Success!!
