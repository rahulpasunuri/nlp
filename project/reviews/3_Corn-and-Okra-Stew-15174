I think this recipe has potential and I will definitely try it again. I did do a medium roux as the other reviewer suggested and I recommend it. The only other change was I had to use chorizo sausage instead of andouille - I think it's important not to substitute another sausage for this recipe. Other minor changes: save time and leave the okra whole, increase the shrimp and do not split in half - 1 lb of whole medium shrimp would improve the recipe.

Great way to idle away a weekend afternoon. Resulting flavor was very good with a nice heat. Traditional roux may have added some depth to initial flavor -- will try next time.
