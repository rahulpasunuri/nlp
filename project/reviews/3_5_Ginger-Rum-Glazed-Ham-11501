I loved this recipe and most especially the ginger. I make my own ginger in syrup using just fresh ginger slices and simple syrup. It comes in very handy and no searching.

Another substitute for the ginger in syrup is to use crystalized ginger. Just mince it (which you can do with scissors) and soak it overnight in enough corn syrup to cover the ham. Trader Joe's has wonderful crystalized ginger that is so potent it's almost medicinal although Roland is ok too and more widely available.

I made this for one of the courses of our Christmas dinner. Everyone loved it!

This was very good for an Easter dinner. I followed advice from another review and took fresh ginger, chopped it up, boiled it in corn syrup, then blended it the next day with the other ingredients. It was a wonderful glaze!!

This recipe was good, but I couldn't find the ginger in syrup either, so maybe it would be better with it. In my opinion, a much tastier recipe with easier to find (and probably much less expensive)ingredients is Alton Brown's 'City Ham' on Food Network's website. It uses crushed ginger snaps for the ginger flavor. It bakes to a wonderful crust instead of a glaze. I know it sounds strange, but its wonderful. It was really simple and everyone who tasted it is still raving about it weeks later.

When I couldn't find the ginger, I marinated the ham overnight in ginger ale, then used more ginger ale to prepare the glaze. I saved the drippings, and used them to cook the leftover ham with green beans and potatoes the next day, and this turned out to be wonderful as well!

Made this for my daughters baptism party. People are still talking about it (also helped that the ham was smoked not salt cured) Used ginger marmalade since I couldn't find the perserved ginger and a little more rum. Fabulous!!!! Put your ham in hours before on the lowest oven setting ie 200f and then just before serving crank it up and do the glaze. Making this again today for the third time!

I varied this by using a wonderful ginger mustard which I ordered from Ray's Mustard in Eastport, Maine. I received raves from my guests and it was not sweet but still had the wonderful ginger taste. They have many outstanding flavors and many awards from the US and Europe.

Am planning to make this for easter but I'm concerned that it may be too sweet (like washington said). Has anyone tried adding a little mustard to the glaze? I'm not sure how that would mix with the ginger.

Made this for Easter and thought it was great! Easy and flavorful. Not to beat this issue, but couldn't find ginger in syrup. i used crystallized ginger and soaked it in just enough warm water to soften which worked fine. Made with stir-fried sesame asparagus (also on this site) and baby carrots.

I agree with the cook from South Jersey, although I did find the ginger in the Jelly and Marmalade section, all it is is ginger cooked in syrup. Everyone raved about how nicely it went with the ham, even my finicky brother.

I made this for Easter dinner, and although most of my guests really liked it, I found it too sweet for my taste and I even cut down the sugar! This glaze is something I will not use again for myself, but will use for another dinner party.

Just made this for Easter dinner....rave reviews from all. I cooked it at a lower temperature, for longer, to accomadate my schedule, and it came out beautifully moist and flavorful.

I made this for last Easter. Finding the preserved ginger in syrup was ABSOLUTELY impossible. None of the local specialty stores have it, I checked online, - nothing. I live in the 'burbs of Phila., so you'd think I could find it. Nope. SO - I went to a friend who is a chef. She said it was SO easy to make that buying it was a waste of money: Take karo syrup, add finely chopped ginger and boil it down. That's it. It was perfect. I'm making it again this year...

This recipe is a welcome change from the usual glaze.TO NERVOUS IN INDIANA: Unable to get to a specialty store, I used the pickled ginger in slices, , rinsed it off, added some white syup, and microwaved it 30 seconds at a time till it became syrupy. I did this 48 hours in advance , and it worked extremely well!

Used the glaze for our Thanksgiving ham & guests loved it. We couldn't find the ginger in syrup, either & just went with crystallized & it was superb.

Help! Would something called "pickled ginger" work? It reads that it is in a syrup that contains some vinigar and sugar. It resembles the color of ginger you see served with sushi. But this stuff is shredded. Any suggestions out there? Nervous in Indiana

The glaze is wonderful...though finding the ginger in Northwest Arkansas is next to impossible. I have soaked candied ginger in the rum before blending it up. It is still wonderful. I have also used bourbon as a rum substitute. A great treat for your Easter ham.

Thihs glaze was delicious and easy. With the leftover ginger I would make an appetizer of them on cream cheese on crackers.

I made this for Easter to everyone's delight. The glaze is wonderful--I'm going to try it on other roasted meats, like a pork loin. Definitely a keeper!
