This was a really good recipe. I used some of the suggestions below, for instance, I halved the recipe and left out the carrots. Instead of using all coconut milk or vegetable broth, I used half of each. Also, I threw a little tumeric and a serrano chile to make it a little spicy.

I love this concept. I substituted butternut squash for the potatoes, added more onion and some ginger. It was quite tasty! :)

This is sooo goood!!! I made a much smaller rendition cutting listed ingredients in half and adding eggplant to the mix instead of corn. I also used coconut milk instead of veggie broth and cooked the whole thing on a very low heat for about an hour like a stew. Very delicious!

I used only three carrots, increased the amounts of zucchini, added fresh herbs (basil, parsley, tarragon), doubled the curry amount, and reduced the broth at the end to give it more thickness. I left out the corn and couscous....the potatoes are enough! It was great with the raita and I served a fresh sauteed sole alongside. This is a nice change for summer vegetables...almost a soup...

This is a wonderful dish for a vegetarian!! Not bland at all. I'd leave out the corn and the squash/zuchini. Also add 1/4 teaspoon of tumeric. Tumeric gives the potatoes a nice color and is said to have cancer-fighting properties. Be more generous with the cinnamon too and olive oil. This dish doesn't need the salt. There's enough in the veggie broth. Aslo: replace couscous with jasmati rice...makes it more indian.

What a great recipe! I didn't have the highest expectations because of some of the reviews and the lack of spices, but I have to say that I was impressed. This recipe made great use of my CSA veggies and was very flavorful. I will note that the curry powder you use must be fresh, and if you have access to an indian market or bulk spices I would get it there because it really creates all the flavor in this dish. This makes a lot, so I also made 2 cups of basmati rice and served them together. Left off the raita (even though I love it- I was too lazy to make) and the mint, and didn't miss them; I would include them if I was making for company. Overall I liked this dish and I'm sure I will be making it again as the summer yields more squash and zucchini.

This seemed like a hodgepodge of veggies. Next time, I'd leave out the corn, half the tomatoes and the carrots. Keep the honey, it doesn't make too much of a difference. Keep the pot on the stove longer or take off the lid, there is a lot of extra liquid after 20 minutes. You can play with this one without fear of messing it up!

My husband and I loved this recipe. I did let it cook longer than stated so it wasn't too soupy, and I forgot the mint garnish. I served it with basmati rice with coriander and grilled pork tenderloin. Yum.

Very good. We simmered it uncovered about 40 minutes longer to reduce the liquid. Next time will make the day before as it tasted better when the spices had time to blend.

the secret to this dish is good curry. we picked up some fragrant, spicy curry at the indian market nearby, and this dish was NOT bland. though it's billed as a summer dish, we found it to be a cozy, but not lethargy-inducing antidote to a cold night, particularly made with rice and served like a soup.

Reasonably fast and simple, tasty, just hot enough to feel it but not so much that it burns your tastebuds!

Very good and a nice mixture of vegetables. Cut back on the honey, though.
