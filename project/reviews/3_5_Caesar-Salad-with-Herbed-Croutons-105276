This is very good. I added a splash of the anchovy oil that the fillets came in and I think it added even more yummy flavor. A keeper!

This has become my go to recipe for a sure crowd pleaser. It is amaaaazing and never fails to elicit ooohs and aaaahs. I reduce the anchovies to six but otherwise make no changes to the dressing. The croutons are yummy but I generally make simple croutons (without the herbs) or buy prepackaged. It never seems to diminish the resutls and it frees up some extra time.

I craved a good old fashioned ceasar's salad, and this dressing was the best. It's so simple to put together, and tastes fantastic. Love the garlic and anciovies - gives it a fab bite. There was more than I needed, but I just jarred it, and look forward to my next Ceasar's Salad. Saves cooking time later on when I know I will have it again this week!

Served this last night and it was a hit. I was told that the caesar was a definite "do over" and I couldn't agree more. I have tried several dressings recipes that are a lot more complex and include a raw egg, and this one beat them all hands down. Is very rich in flavor and garlic and for me that is what a caesar dressing should be! I added a splash of worcestershire also and used anchovy paste.

Rating: 3
I thought this was fantastic tasting and really easy to make. I added two or three splashes of worcesteshire, as suggested by other uses, and it added that little extra something. When I first tasted it, I thought it was overwhelmingly mustardy, but when tossed with the romaine it was perfectly zingy. I didn't use all the dressing though, so be sure to toss a little bit at a time.

Rating: 4
Thrilled. Used 6 anchovies instead of 8 and added a bit more lemon just because we like lemon. Could not be more pleased - simple and excellent.

Rating: 3
This dressing was not as 'mustardy' as I had anticipated- which is a good thing - even though I used the exact amount in the recipe and other reviewers suggested cutting back on the mustard, ...I added a dash of worcestershire sauce and freshly ground black pepper. Easy and quite delish. I will be referring back to this recipe often! I always make my own homemade croutons - didn't make this particular crouton recipe.

After reading the reviews it sounded like a salad worth making. Although the family isn't crazy about whole anchovies the recipe purees them into a flavorful dressing. Everyone loved it and it's a do over in this Mystic house. I'll never again buy ceasars dressing knowing a flavorful and healthy version is so easy to make. The croutons are worthy of the time invested. Topped the salad w/ herb grilled chicken for a complete and easy meal.

This is one of the best caesars I have ever had...I always make it for a crowd and someone always asks for the recipe. The dressing recipe makes a lot more than you need for the salad though so you could easily cut the recipe in half (or just use less and save the rest for another day).

I do not usually review recipes, but every time I make this recipe, someone asks for a copy of it! It is delicious! I have made a couple of modifications over time...First, I have found that that amount of garlic in the dressing is not for the weak, so I started cutting it in half, satisfying everybody. I also make it without anchovies. I'm sure they are great in it, I'm just not a fan!

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe several times and add extra garlic into the dressing (for garlic lovers only because it is strong). Instead of baking the croutons, I saute them in a heavy non-stick skillet with butter and herbs; they turned out fantastic. They are buttery, crispy and pack a lot of crunch!

I"m really surprised by all the positive reviews for this recipe. We wanted to make a Caesar at my parent's house but because of my mom's health issues opted to find a mock caesar recipe instead of a traditional one. based on all the positive reviews of this one we tried it. Heavy on mustard and garlic both we didn't care for it much. Of course it wasn't going to be like a traditional version but we didn't expect how it turned out. We followed the recipe and it was also very gloppy. Definitely not something I"d make again.

Rating: 4
Excellent Caesers salad! Every last bit was eaten at dinner tonight and I know I'll be making it often in the future! I followed the recipe exactly as written (unusual for me!) and thought it was perfectly balanced (dijon and all). My only complaint would be the croutons...they're just "OK" ...nothing special. Next time I will experiment a bit with them.

Rating: 4
There will be some who have a problem with this since it is not an authentic dressing. But, my experience is that you will not find a better tasting ceasars salad dressing anywhere-including recipes that call themselves authentic. This is a favorite of ours and I serve this at our dinner parties when we decide to have a ceasars salad. It always meets with rave reviews. There has never been a time where I was not asked how to make it. I don't think you can go wrong.

Used 2 big cloves garlic, 1 heaping TBS dijon & 5 Anchovies. Used my own croutons. Be sure to use fresh grated Parmesan. It makes the dish. Next time I'll double the recipe so I have some left. Makes 4 to 6 not 6 to 8. This is as good as any premade I've ever had anywhere. A Keeper.

I tried this recipe several times. The first time I found the garlic and the mustard (i use strong mustard) too overpowering, since I like the anchovies taste. So next time I decreased the garlic in the dressing to 2 small cloves and 1 Tb mustard. I also added a bit of tabasco, as was recommended in some other recipes. Loved it.

Rating: 3
I made the dressing without the anchovies (didn't have any in my pantry). I doubled up on the garlic and added a splash of balsamic vinegar to give it some extra zing. Also, I substituted lime for lemon and it turned out well. The croutons were very easy to make and tasted delicious. At first it looked as if they didn't have enough oil to fully coat them, but once they started to heat up the olive oil they had absorbed began to seep out. The result was a mostly crispy crouton with a slight give in the center. For an all around crunch ou may want to leave yours in for a little longer. This would be great for entertaining, but is simple enough to make for a weekday dinner.

I made this dish tonight after being faced with a pile of leftover romaine from last nights meal. I left out the anchovies, my family doesn't eat them, and the dressing was still very tasty. I've never made croutons before and these were foolishly easy and yummy.

Rating: 4
This is a great Caesar salad, and I love the "egg-less" but safe dressing! I used a blender, just made sure to have enough liquid at the bottom to keep everything from sticking. I probably used a bit more lemon juice than called for. My husband hates garlic, so did everything without garlic, and it was still really, really good. The croutons I made larger, and used dried herbs since they were on hand. We'll have this again tonight with the leftover dressing and croutons and more romaine!

Rating: 3
I really enjoyed this recipe. Granted, as some have pointed out, this IS a Caesar-"style" dressing, due to the lack of a raw egg. But let's be honest... I was looking for a tasty, easy, Caesar dressing that I could whip up on a weeknight, or, in this case, for a special someone's birthday when we're both working long hours! This fit the bill perfectly, and was tasty to boot.

Made this for an impromptu dinner when some friends just showed up to ski. The room had only a kitchenette but did have interent and we were limited to the itsy-bitsy local market. Even tho the only parmesian cheese we could find came in a green shaker can, the dressing was wonderful!! Definitely a keeper.

Well, the croutons turned out awesome but i would have to say the dressing was alright. I added a little mayo to it to give it a creamy texture and nice flavor. After that.. things went good. I served it with lasagna and garlic bread.

Good recipe. I bought croutons. To add some showmanship to impress my Valentine, I mixed all the ingredients tableside in a wooden bowl. She loved it. All I added to the recipe was a raw egg (mostly for flair) and a bit of salt for flavor.

Nice dressing recipie. I have to agree with one reviewer about the croutons. Since I love Rosemary and Thyme, I thought "this if for me", but the fresh herbs didn;t seem to be able to lend their flavors to the bread. After baking I hit them with a little garlic salt and they were okay. But I agree there are alot of other good crouton recipies to use, so I will make the recipie again using one of them. PS: We enjoyed a good Italian Pinot Grigio with this salad.

This is simply he best ceasar salad dressing I've ever had! I'm glad there are no eggs in it! I followed other cook's advice and cut the mustard to 1 tablespoon. No extra salt or pepper are needed. This is much better than that creamy version of Ceasar's that's available in the store. I'm still working out the kinks in the crouton part of the recipe. Have a hunch that sour dough bread would work best for the croutons.

This recipe is easy as pie and yet I made it even easier. 1) I don't have a food processor so I just chopped the dressing ingredients up fine and whisked in the olive oil to taste. 2) I do have an oven but instead chose to saute the croutons in my cast iron skillet so they had crunch yet chewiness- so good with just butter and garlic. The ratios recommended are good but you can tweak to your taste- Yummy - it is a keeper!

This is an incredible Caesar salad! There's no egg yolks to worry about, so it's super picnic-friendly. I've made it twice for a potluck, and always get rave reviews. Here's my secret: don't tell anyone there are anchovies, because it freaks them out. They make the dressing what it is!

Very good, but I would leave the Parmesan cheese out of the dressing mixture, and just sprinkle it on top of the salad when you're ready to serve. Makes the dressing too lumpy.

Rating: 3
This was a wonderful, Caesar-style dressing. I used stale garlic baguettes to make the croutons, and used a butter-oil combo instead of straight oil. They weren't at all greasy. I played around with some of the amounts of the dressing a bit before discovering the taste I was looking for: a whole tin of anchovies, a little less oil, a grind of pepper, and a touch more cheese. Throwing everything into the food processor made making this ahead of time a snap, which was the primary appeal of this recipe- and I was pleased to discover it tasted quite nice, as well.

This is the first recipe on this site I have not been happy with, it tasted fine, but it is a Caesar-STYLE dressing, not really Caesar, since it is really more of a lemon-garlic-cheese-vinagrette. It did not come out creamy or rich -- I realize now because of the eggs being left out. In general its fine, and the croutons are great, but I just was hoping to serve Caesar salad to my guests, not this, which is VERY acidic...

I have made many ceasar salads in my day with croutons but this was by far the best. Having very fresh romaine hearts helped. I used more garlic and anchovy paste and it was perfect. My friends all wanted the receipe.

I had the fixins for a chicken Caesar salad (including, yes, a very good Caesar dressing from good ol' Kraft!) and used this recipe strictly for the crouton instructions. They are so scrumptious, even made with dried herbs (I can't stand spending $1.99 each for a teaspoonful of the fresh stuff tho it's plenty accessible at the corner gourmet deli). Even my 6-year-old, a very picky eater, wanted to gobble up these croutons. I placed all the components in a big flour burrito for the best Caesar chicken salad wrap ever.

This recipe hit was exactly what I needed. My entire family liked it so much that they asked me to make it again the next night. I did however make a few adjustments: First Instead of just 8 anchovies, I used a complete tin (approx 16 to 20) as well as the olive salt solution to add some infused anchovie flavor. I also increased the amount of Parm to a cup. Finally instead of Dijon mustard I used a creole mustard ( I'm from Louisiana, so I happened to have a lot more creole (a whole grain mustard with a little kick) than the pure Dijon. Finally, I didn't run into any problems with greasy croutons. I used an round italian loaf. Now my cubs were a little large, and maybe that's what saved me from the greasy effect.

This is the only caesar I ever make, after trying every recipe I could find. We all love this one. A tip: finish the croutons in the skillet, if you like them easier to eat. The oven tends to make them really hard before they get truly golden.

Vwery nice taste! Eliminates the egg which is fine. So add some mayo if you want some creamy mouth feel. It has some real bite to it so if that isn't to your palate, reduce the mustard..other than that, it really beats most dressing I have tried! Oh, and I think that adding some butter to the oil in whcih to toast the bread cubes is a really good addition..just reduce the oil. If I had any complaints, it would be that the croutons were too greasy in the original..perhaps that's why others complained about too much oil in the recipe. Ya think?

way too much oil, not enough of that pungent, delicious caesar taste. next time i would double the amounts of everything except the oil. perhaps that would even it out.

First time I made it was in a blender and the ingredients got stuck. So I transferred it to a food processor to finish adding the oil. It was incredible!!! Have made it since straight in the food processor and it was not as creamy or good. Prefer the mistake method.

Perfectly okay recipe. I agree with previous reviewers that there is too much mustard, and I would add that there may be too much lemon juice. Frankly, many caeser dressings call for a raw egg, or at least the yolk, and I believe this adds the lusciousness missing here. There are better recipes. In any case, be certain to use good quality cheese, and try shaving it over the salad with a vegetable peeler. Works great!

This is an incredibly easy and delicious Caesar dressing. I don't know why people use bottled Casesar dressing when this one is so good. It's the essence of garlic, Parmesan, and anchovies. Tossing this with hearts of Romaine is one of my favorite salads. And it takes less than 5 minutes to make as written.

This is the best ceasar salad recipie I have made so far. I've tried millions, and this is definitely the best one so far.

Still this one is the best I've ever been able to make at home - plus no raw eggs!
