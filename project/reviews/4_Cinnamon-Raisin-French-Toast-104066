I bought cinnamon swirl and raisin cinnamon swirl bread from a great bread bakery-the Kneaded Bread in Portchester, NY. I was skeptical about using such thick slabs/slices of bread per the recipe but it was really yummy and extremely decadent. A big hit.

I've never really been a french toast person but, this recipe converted me! The dual step of pan frying and then baking gives the french toast a lovely crunchy exterior with a gorgeous, creme brulee like interior. So delectable - you know it's bad for you.

I'd say my non-dairy version was "inspired by" this recipe. I modified the quantities of various ingredients, and used rice milk instead of half and half. Mods per every 5 eggs or so: rice milk, about half a cup; no sugar; half tsp. vanilla; half tsp. cinnamon; 1/8 tsp. nutmeg. Pam on the griddle instead of butter. The flavor of these ingreds together is fantastic! And with the vanilla, I did not miss the sugar. I think it would be way too sweet as written. I was also pleased that it worked so well with rice milk. Baking the toast afterwards was a nice finishing touch, and did not dry them out, even though our guests were late. Someday I'll try the much richer original version, but the lighter one was delicious!

My family of picky eaters loved it. I let it soak for 20 minutes, but will do it longer next time, maybe even overnight. This recipe is a winner!

A winner! The extra step of finishing the french toast in the oven results in a cruncy, satisfying breakfast. Also makes staging breakfast easier as the toast is in the oven while you brew coffee, heat milk, saute the bacon. Made this on a snowy Sunday for breakfast -- great winter fuel!

On a positive note this was easy to assemble. I followed the instructions to the letter, with the exception that half of the portions were flipped over before going into the over, the other half were not. The result was that the un-flipped were crunchier on the top - a texture somewhat strange for french toast. Overall everyone said this was good, but not what they expected - much more eggy and souffle like. Everyone also wanted to have more of the cream cheese filling flavor come through.

This has become a favorite at brunches I host. I prefer to use this recipe without raisins. After baking them, they turn out to be pastry-like. Delicious!

Next time around I would use thinner slices of bread and not soak them so long in the egg mixture. I prefer my french toast to be a little crunchier. Try a fruit compote and confectioners' sugar as a finishing touch. Mmm mmm good!

This was great french toast! I didn't have that much half @ half in the house, so I used 1 1/4 cups half @ half and the other 1 1/4 cups of buttermilk. It was really good, a keeper.

I made this for brunch and everybody loved it; even my finicky kids ate it. A piece was leftover, so the next day I reheated it and the kids come running for it.

Perfect. Use stale Brioche bread if you have it left over, or let the slices dry out over night so they absorb better. Don't skimp on the sugar. Calorie-bomb! Woohoo!

We made this French Toast for the first time today. We had two other couples over, both of whom claim to be French Toast afficianados. Everyone(!) said it was the best French Toast they'd ever had. Next time, we'll soak the bread overnight. I think it is a really good idea to "brown" both sides on a skillet before putting it into a baking tray. Then just bake 20 minutes, no need to flip.

I made this for breakfast for our company last holiday and it was a huge success! I used some leftover Challah bread instead. It was DELICIOUS!I would definitely make this again and again! Thank you, Bonappetit!

This was an excellent recipe, however I omitted the sugar. It's sweet enough, especially if you're using maple syrup. My guests raved about it!
