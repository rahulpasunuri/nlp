This was the first Kugel I've ever made (or eaten for that matter) and I thought it was delicious. With the exception that I used low fat sour cream and cottage cheese, I followed the recipe exactly. I did not find it overly sweet, but I'm not sure if I'd serve it as a dinner side dish nor would I think it a dessert item. I think it would be a great brunch/breakfast item. I guess I could see it complementing a roast chicken, too. I really liked the light orange flavor and the currants were a nice touch - you just get a small bit with your bite, which was nice. Raisins would be similar in flavor, but because they are bigger, I'd think they be overwhelming. I will make this again and I know this sounds strange, but I think some caramelized onions or shallots would be a really nice addition and make it a bit more of a savory dinner side dish.

I had some trepidation, given the reviews, but wanted to make a different kugel for my temple's break-the-fast. I substituted Craisins for currents, as suggested by others, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. FABULOUS. A keeper.

Easy and delicious. I made it with nonfat cottage cheese and nonfat yogurt (in lieu of the sour cream), and Craisins (tm) instead of currants, mostly because I had those ingredients on hand. Also, I'm not even sure if they carry currants at the regular grocery stores near me. It came out well.

A HUGE hit. Substituted brown sugar for regular, and it was sweet, but not yucky sweet. Halved the sour cream. Passed on almonds, used pecans and brown sugar for the topping instead. I think currants were nice but Raisins would have been fine too. The orange zest gave the flavor an original slant and delicate aroma. We loved it.

I made this for a dinner party last night, and served it alongside the main course, borscht. I cut the sugar a third so as not to make it dessert-sweet. I often substitute greek-style low or non-fat yogurt for sour cream (or for part of it) as I did last night. It was a big success. An Israeli friend who loves this kind of food adored it. So it makes a good side dish to something savory if made less sweet. Note: Only greek yogurt, which is strained until it takes on the thick density of sour cream, is good as a substitute.

This is the worst kugel I have ever had -- I would have given it no forks if I'd been able. It was incredibly sweet and had a really nasty taste -- almost like marshmallows had somehow been folded in. I strongly don't recommend making it.

Great kugel. Gets rave reviews all the time. I skip the apples and nuts though. The currants are a must.

This kugel was okay - not great. I won't bother making this again.

My husband loved this dish. I think it would be great with turkey but for our family we use it for a dessert. It was creamy and sweet with a light orange flavor. Great!

Perfect balance of sweet and orange, light and still full. Everyone, from the kids to the seniors, loved this and are still asking for it. Will be a tradition in our family. Made this last time with no cranberries simply because I forgot to add them and this was still great.

Okay. I doubled the almond/butter/sugar/cinnamon topping for the top.

This is the best and most fool-proof recipe for kugel. I was invited to a seder a few years ago and brought this dish. Being a fan of all things sweet(and many savory) I searched the Epicurious site for just the right thing. It is a simple, classic and just plain delightful dish. I pass it on to as many people as I can.

I grew up in a very traditional multigenerational Jewish home where my great-grandmother, grandmother, and then my mother all had outstanding 'signature' kugel dishes. Theirs were a special request at most family gatherings. This one has become mine - a superb accompaniment to a Sunday or New Year's Day brunch, always wining rave reviews. The addition of apples does not make it so sweet as to be considered a dessert. It is a lovely side dish which combines both sweet and savory. Am planning to make this next time in a lower-fat version with egg beaters, and expect the results to be just as good, and even a bit lighter in texture.

I would never eliminate the currants (as other reviewers suggested). These, combined with the the tart apple and other ingredients make this really special. Why don't you recommend freezing this and other recipes more often? Thanks for what has become a terrific dish for a cold buffet dish combined with chicken, etc.

Great Kugel. Just made it for Rosh Hashana, and got requests for Yom Kippur. I left out the apples because I wanted to serve it as a side dish and not a dessert. I also added a bit more cinnimon and vanilla. Everyone loved the orange flavor.

A little "gournet" version of an old traditional favorite.

This is a great kugel recipe. I have made it many time. Sometimes I substitute dried Blueberries and lemon. If you've never had kugel, this is a great start. Perfect comfort food.
