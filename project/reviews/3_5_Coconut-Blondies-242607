Family & friends love love love these. Every time I make them (often) I'm asked for the recipe. One of the few recipes I do not alter. Easy & delish.

I substituted blanched almonds for the pecans and sprinkled white chocolate and the almonds on top for a zing! "Sinfully good" was the best comment on this recipe.

these were excellent.. added choc. chips instead of pecans. (didn't have) really really satisfying.

These were really good the first day, but they decline rapidly once cut. In a few days, they started drying out and getting really crusty. I think it might have to do with the large amount of sugar? The other brownies in this story held up better and had less sugar and more eggs (back page that month was all brownies and blondies).

Yummy!! These blondies are excellent; coconutty, chewy, caramelly. They looked a little dark & I was afraid they were overdone, but, they were perfect. Quick, easy, & delicious.

I used shortening and dairy free chocolate chips for someone with dairy intolerence. I also used coconut extract instead of vanilla and unsweetened ribbon coconut. They baked and have a texture like a brownie and are really different and delicious.

Got rave reviews at a party with this recipe -- I even converted it to gluten-free and no one noticed any difference. It's very, very rich because of the amount of butter, so instead of using sweetened coconut like the recipe calls for, I used unsweetened. People who claimed they hated coconut loved the blondies!

Just OK....and that is coming from someone who loves sweets. The directions for determining whether or not they are done are well, not good. 20-25 minutes is all they need. If you wait for their suggested charecteristics, these will already be burnt. I wish the coconut flavour was stronger. It would have given these Blondies an improvement or something. Maybe a dash of coconut extract? I didn't have any chocolate chips, so I cut up baker's chocolate into small chunks. I liked the difference size and texture of the chocolate.

These are the ones to make! I tried several blondie recipes before trying this one. I happen to love coconut, but the coconut flavor was not pronounced, so family members who don't like it still loved these blondies.

These were spectacular. My husband commented that it's the best "non-chocolate" dessert he's ever had. After tasting one, I immediately froze half of them because I knew we wouldn't be able to stop eating them otherwise! I selected this recipe one day when I needed a quick dessert. I was looking for a bar cookie type of thing. I had no chocolate in the house and didn't want to go to the store. But lucky me, I had a bag of coconut. I will make these again and again!! Oh and by the way, they are excellent when still very cold from the freezer......

This recipe is much admired by coconut and rich dessert lovers, myself included. And yet they are not a crowd-pleaser. Too different? I think coconut turns some people off. A must for the rest.

I thought these were amazing...even my husband who does not like shredded coconut devoured them.

My family loved these. They even sprinkled the left over crumbs over vanilla ice cream. I thought the blondies were good - a little greasy as other reviewers have stated- but I like that. This recipe is quick and easy to make - will definately make again.

These were perfect. I used unsweetened coconut and didn't miss the extra sugar.

This was really nice and superquick to make. First I thought the amount of sugar would be a bit too much but was willing to try the recipe as is before tinkering with it. came out just right - not too sweet at all. definitely a keeper.

I, too, expected these to be at least a 3-fork dessert. They were good, but not great. I used unsweetened coconut, which I am glad about because these did not need more sweetness. I found them a bit too thick and not as flavorful or complex as I would like, although my friends liked them and enjoyed their "toasty" quality, as one friend said. They are better the next day.

I was very excited, because I'm always looking for a good blondie recipe. However, I just thought it turned out "pretty good" when I made them. Will try again, because I've been having some trouble with my oven temp of late, so possibly were a little undercooked. They are tasty, but quite chewy and a bit greasy.

Absolutely FABULOUS. And yes, addictive... Kids and hubby loved them!

DO NOT make this recipe unless you are willing to accept the fact you will gobble up an entire pan of Blondies without realizing it. (Perhaps even in one sitting. Beware.) They are really very delicious and easy to make. Oh, and if you throw in a handful of chocolate chips - also quite spectacular.
