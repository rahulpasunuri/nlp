Delicious and creamy. Just like cake frosting should be. I found that I needed to add extra yogurt to get the smooth, creamy consistency I wanted. At first, it starts out mealy and scary but mixing in a few more spoonfuls of yogurt did the trick.

Glossy, spreadable and delicious, not too sweet - will become a firm favourite in our house.

Quite good. I halved the recipe with no trouble. I also whipped it *thoroughly* after the cocoa and the sugar additions to try to get the grit out - pretty successful, but I'm glad I did it with a mixer and not by hand. It piped beautifully. And WOW is it tasty. (4, not 5, stars just because it's not exactly a new or unusual flavor.)

Imagine my panic when at 10 at night I realize that I completely forgot that the next day was my husband's birthday. Since he was out I ran to the kitchen to see what kind of cake I could put together. I had the ingredients to manage a simple vanilla cake and decided to do a chocolate frosting. But I didn't have any cream so this recipe looked like a winner. Except I didn't have yogurt either, which is odd since it's a staple for us. But I did have sour cream so I followed this recipe and substitued the sour cream. It was delicious and so easy! The only reason I don't give four stars is the texture wasn't quite as smooth as I would have liked, but that may have been something in my method. Will bookmark and use again.

This is a soft, dark chocolate-colored frosting with a very subtle tang from the yogurt. Very easy to make (I just used a microwave) and requires no sifting or whipping. I made the whole recipe with just a wooden spoon and a small bowl. It is similar is consistency to canned frosting, but the flavor is much better. I didn't find it thick enough with just 2 cups of sugar so I added more. This also made it sweeter, which I prefer. It's great that the frosting basically repeats ingredients from the cake, so you don't need to purchase anything extra. And it paired very well with the cake.

I would recommend that if you refridgerate the frosting, let it get to room temperature before piping onto cupcakes. Once at room temperature, it's got a good texture and not as sweet or oily as some of the buttercream frostings.

I made this frosting for cupcakes for my son's birthday.After chilling for a while, it was hard as a rock! I had to slowly microwave it to be able to pipe it on the cupcakes.After all this trouble, they had the exact taste and consistency as Duncan Hines from a jar. Yuck! I was embarrassed. Go with a buttercream instead.

This is just "add it to my hips" good. Don't be afraid to add a little more yogurt for smoothness.

Easy to make. Double the recipe if you're using it to frost a double layer cake. I didn't necessarily taste a 'tangy' taste, but I liked the fact that it wasn't overly sweet.

Quick, easy, excellent! And not too sweet. Definitely a keeper!

I used almost 3 oz of chocolate (that's what was left in the box I had on hand)...and extra chocolate never hurt anyone. There was enough for 24 cupcakes and leftovers to nosh. The extra fork is because it is so easy and uses only one bowl.

Very good!! I was pleasantly surprised!! I tried cutting the recipe in half, but no go. It doesn't have the right taste, better make the whole thing as stated. Definitely better than what they sell in the store.

This was simply delicious! I added an extra tablespoon of yoghurt as I found it a trifle thick. I used it with the Banana-Pineapple Layer Cake (instead of Cream Cheese Frosting) and it was sooooo good!

I just used a butter recipe boxed cake and coupled with this frosting. Even the most discriminate of chocolate haters (yes I have one in my home) loved it. I noticed at the last minute that I did not have any yogurt so I used ricotta....the taste was heavenly. This is now my basic frosting.

This frosting is fantastic. I also experienced it separating after the first sugar and yogurt, but whisking hard brought it together. So easy!

Unbelievable tasting frosting - more like a dark chocolate frosting.

Very good, VERY chocolately without being cavity-sweet. The graininess described was probably from not disolving the sugar enough in the beginning, I thought it was yummers good, and I am one picky girl when it comes to frostings.

Really liked this recipe - very simple and tasty. I used 2/3 c unsweetened cocoa powder since I didn't have any chocolate squares. The yogurt adds a terrific tang. I'll use this recipe again.

What gives? I followed this recipe to a tee, but the frosting was not tangy, but very bitter and gritty. I kept adding more and more sugar, which just didn't help. If someone can tell me where I went wrong, please do.

This frosting was VERY easy to make, and tasted delicious. The yogurt gave it a little bit of a different flavor, which cut down on the sweetness of the chocolate, and gave it a pleasantly different flavor
