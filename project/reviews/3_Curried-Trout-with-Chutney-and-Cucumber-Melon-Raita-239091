I have been making this dish since the recipe came out. I think it is a great, light, Indian-inspired dish. However, cooking the fish as suggested is virtually impossible. I suggest using an oven-proof pan and starting the fish by sauteing it skin side down for four minutes, then finishing the cooking under a broiler (about 5 minutes). Also, I would suggest seasoning the fish with the salt, pepper and curry powder prior to the addition of the ginger-mango chutney.

Very easy, very flavorful. We couldn't find mango-ginger chutney so we added fresh ginger to a mango chutney. The Raita was mild in in flavor, but it was a perfect compliment for the fish. Turning the fish was a bit tricky.

Very quick recipe. The flavor was good. I would not make the raita again...the fish can stand by itself. I would bake the fish in the oven to prevent scorching and loss of almonds when flipping.

This is one of the WORST recipes I have ever made! My husband and I ended up throwing it out. Do not even bother with this one. Sometimes I wonder how much recipe testing the magazine actually does.
