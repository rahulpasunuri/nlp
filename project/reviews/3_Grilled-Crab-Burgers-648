I have made these burgers for years. They're great! Yes, they can stick. Yes, be sure your grill is clean and well oiled. And, yes, spray or bursh a little oil on the burgers. Keep a zone of low or no heat to move the burgers to keep warm while toasting the bread. A fish grate can be very usful. I use a coated expanded steel one, it really helps. Charcoal adds a lot of flavor. Lump crab makes a decadent burger.

I thought this was very nice. Added egg white instead of egg yolk to hold it together better. Not bad.

I agree that brushing these crabburgers with a little olive oil is helpful. Also, to help them hold together, try tweaking the amount of crumbs & mayo until they hold together and refrigerating them for a couple of hours before grilling.

I did not like this recipe at all. The burgers kept falling apart and there wasn't much taste to them.

Very tasty, but can't imagine them holding together on the grill. I pan fried them in a little oil instead.

The basic flavor of the crabcakes was good, however I would use less breadcumbs than called for in the recipe.I would also grill on a low temperature.

This was very dry and untasty. The breadcrumbs wre flying all over mykitchen.

WOW what a great "burger". This is a must for those who like low fat, high taste recipe's. Substitute low fat mayo to reduce the fat without changing the taste at all.

Very Very good. It's perfect for those of us that don't eat beef and would like a burger with everyone else at a cook out.

This recipe works better if you brush the burgers and the grill with a little oil. Also it makes two HUGE burgers, could stretch it out to three without any problem. Absolutely delicious, I'll never fry crab cakes again!
