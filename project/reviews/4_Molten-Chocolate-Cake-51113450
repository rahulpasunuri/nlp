I was wondering how many ramekins of what size also. I used 3.6 inch ramekins that we got from Pier 1 (that's the smallest size they sell) because I figured this is probably pretty rich and high in calories. I didn't fill them completely, as they do rise a little. I used 16 of them!

Yes and no - you missed the serving size. 8 ramekins suitably sized for 4 ounces of batter allowing some room for rising.

Recipe doesn't say what size ramekins to use. Did I miss something?

This is an excellent recipe, tastes just like the dessert at one of our favorite restaurants, but now we can make it at home.
