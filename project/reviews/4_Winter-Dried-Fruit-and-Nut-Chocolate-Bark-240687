Too good. I made this for gifts for the holidays. Everyone went nuts. I used cranberries and dried apricots, but I must say that the candied ginger is the special ingredient that makes it so fantastic. I also used 70% Lindt Chocolate. Maker beware, it's hard not to eat it!

So easy, so festive-looking - I hardly got this in the door before people started taking pieces off the tray. I used a ScharffenBerger 70% bittersweet bar, although it's only 9.7 oz, dried fruit from the farmer's market that was alrady cut in tiny pieces (raisins, peaches, pears,apricots, figs) and mixed walnuts, almonds and pistachios. I microwaved the chocolated until it was almost melted and then stirred until there were no lumps left. The pan was cold when I put the chocolate micture in so the fruit, nuts and ginger didn't really stick so I put it back in a 200 degree over for a couple of minutes and then used my rolling pin to make sure things were stuck in the chocolate. Pretty forgiving recipe. I toasted the nuts but didn't like the flavor so used untoasted nuts. I used crystallized ginger chips from The Ginger People, out of Australia, that I found at Raleys/Nob Hill in the natural foods section. The second time, I cut the strips from ginger coins (Dynasty brand)but I liked the chips best. I used one quarter teaspoon of fleur del sel instead of one eighth. Yum! I hope I can get this batch to my mom's tomorrow without eating it all today!

It's a very simple quick recipe. I thought it was a bit to rich and might use light chocolate next time. I used cranberries and pecans with good dark chocolate. I sent it to a pary and people loved it. I would like to try white chocolate with apricots next time.

I use a high quality dark chocolate bar and melt it in the oven on parchment paper set on a cookie sheet. I then do the add-ins and spread it out to desired thickness. Works great.

Super easy and CRAZY good. The sprinkling of salt and slivers of ginger take it from ordinary to outlandish gourmet. I'm making more to give away.

An easy, sure-fire way to temper chocolate is in the microwave, stirring after every 30 seconds until chocolate is smooth. Also, you MUST use a good quality chocolate bar-the chocolate bits are too oily by comparison. Since I only make this in the winter, I don't put my finished product in the frig-that sometimes slightly discolors the chocolate. Hide the bark in a cool room and it will set in 2-4 hours. In my home, if I don't hide it, the bark never hardens, it disappears.

I've made this before, using cranberries & pistachios - and I suggest anyone having problems with the salt....add crushed pretzels instead. Works really well.

This is a really great easy recipe but BE CAREFUL MELTING THE CHOCOLATE especially if you're using good quality Belgian chocolate. Do not melt it over simmering water as indicated - it gets too hot and the chocolate breaks down, causing it to lose its creamy texture and become crumbly when cool. Melt it over hot water and remove from heat before all the chocolate is melted. Then stir to melt remaining chocolate.

I mixed the fruit and nuts into the chocolate -- the kosher salt mostly disappeared into the warm chocolate and the ginger looked a little sparse there by itself. Tasted great, but next time I will mix half of the fruit and nuts into the chocolate and sprinkle on the rest, and look for a coarser salt.

So good, fast and easy and just the right bit of dessert after a lovely meal. Definitely use more salt and good quality chocolate. I use one fruit and one nut combos - and make a few different kinds, and pack that up as holiday gifts. Makes for a little variety. My favorites combos are dried apricot/pecans/white chocolate/ginger/salt. White chocolate/ dried cranberries/ pistachios/ginger/salt. Dark chocolate/dried cherries/walnuts/ginger/salt. Dark chocolate/dried blueberries/pecans/ginger/salt. This is an excellent holiday gift, way faster, and more original than cookies!

Excellent and incredibly easy. We made it with ingredients we had on hand so used a combination of bittersweet and semi-sweet chocolate, cherries, apricot, cranberries and fig. We toasted the nuts -- almonds, pecans, cashews and walnuts -- but otherwise followed the recipe. Love it!

Very tasty. I used 70% cacao chocolate bars instead of the chocolate chips. I choppped up macadamia nuts, peanuts, cherries and raisins, and mixed everything in w/ the chocolate before I spread it in the pan. I like bark w/ the nuts and stuff in the chocolate more than just on top. Still sprinkled the ginger and salt on top after spreading. It turned out very well :)

This is a winner. Very easy to make, great flavors, and impresses everyone. How can you miss with that combo? Great for gift giving.

This is delicious and easy to make. I used a very wide variety of fruits and nuts and next time I will limit the selection. Next time I will make one batch with dried apricots and hazelnuts and another batch with dried cherries and pistachios. Next time I will also use better chocolate instead of chocolate chips, which are low quality compared to bars. I used almost twice as much ginger and salt and would do the same thing again. The salt was the best part! My guests raved about the chocolate-salt combination.

This was so easy and made a delicious gift. Was also great served as a small treat with coffee after dinner.

So simple, and so good! I would double the amount of fleur de sel though. The crystallized ginger added so much to the recipe, everyone loved it. I used apricots and cranberries, and it turned out great. I think next time I will melt white chocolate as well, and then swirl the two together on the pan before sprinkling, I think it will turn out more festive and pretty that way.

I love this little treat. It will be great packaged as gifts, at parties, the possibilties are endless. I used a bittersweet Scharffen berger baking bar, crannberries, apricots, almonds, ginger, and pistachios for great flavor and color. The salt is a really nice touch. I found you can make it on any flat baking sheet and spread to the desired thickness. I will definately make this super easy deliciousness again.

This is a fabulous and easy recipe. It is great for gifts, with coffee after dinner and really anytime. I keep it in the freezer and it doesn't matter to me if it is frozen or thawed. Really delicious.

Fantastic! This was gobbled up (and oohed and ahhed a LOT). Great idea for a quickie gift.

This is a wonderful dessert; it is easy and tasty and perfect for nibbling after a casual dinner. (It's become a favorite for my gourmet pizza parties: people are so full from pizza, a formal dessert is too much.) I agree entirely that it benefits from more salt than called for and definitely more candied ginger: it is the ginger that makes it special. Thanks much to other reviewers for those tips. (The ginger I bought in the Chinese section of the store was about 1/5 as costly as the ginger in the spice section).

Such a hit - great to put out after dinner for people to nibble.

Absolutely needs more ginger and salt. Even if you do not do the ginger, the salt addition is a must!

Looks and tastes great and is so easy! I used more salt the second batch. Everyone loved it! Keep any extras in plastic containers for a quick start next time.

An easy, quick, relatively healthy dessert for the holidays. It would make a great gift.

This is a new fav. I also used TJ's berry combo + dried cranberries. I also thought the 1/8 tsp. salt was skimpy so added a bit more. I'll make this again!

Adding to my previous review this is delicious. I lined a 9x13 with foil and spread the choc on it. It was still nice and thick and the fruit and nuts adhere well. White chocolate and coconut "'snow" could be fun.

This is really just a fancy way of serving trail mix (I realized as I was making it) but you can use really pretty combinations of fruit and it's nice. I used raw pecans, dried cherries, and golden raisins. I think 1/8 teaspoon of fleur de sel is pretty scant... I love the chocolate/salt combo though. The possible combinations are endless.

Took this to a party where wine distributors were drinking up some incredible reds -- was fantastic w/ it & made me the hit of the party! Make this to treat yourself & then make a second batch to give to friends. I will add more fleur de sel & ginger next time. Hint: Use a brownie pan for the right thickness.

The directions for this recipe do not specify what size pan would work best. My cookie sheet seemed too big and the cake pan was being otherwise used so I used a brownie pan but it was too small and it came out a bit too thick, making it hard to break up into pieces. Also there was way too much fruit & nuts called for with that amount of chocolate, which I'm not sure would be solved with a bigger pan. I would next time use the 13" cake pan. Also I used wax paper instead of tin foil and it worked fine except in the corners where some of the paper got stuck in the cooled chocolate. For the fruit I used Trader Joe's Berry Combo mix which was perfect. Finally, I would recommend using a high quality chocolate and not chocolate chips. This was really simple to make and fun to eat and I will make it next time and it will come out better.
