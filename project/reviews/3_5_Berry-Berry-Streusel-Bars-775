Very good, the hint of lemon really makes it. I did however end up using maybe 20 ounces of blueberries, and a about 3/4 a cup of raspberry jam. And instead of mincing lemon peel, zesting the whole peel worked out much better, and was less trouble.

This was great - quite buttery and more like a crumble than a bar, but still delicious. It does lend itself well to variations - I didn't have enough frozen blueberries on hand, so supplemented with frozen raspberries. Likewise, I didn't have enough raspberry jam, so I just mixed in a number of other berry jams. I used Meyer lemons for the peel, and upped the quantity of lemon peel a bit. It's really nice served hot with a sprinkling of cinnamon and a scoop of vanilla icecream.

will make this again, but suggest adding more than the suggested 12 ounces of fruit. used low fat margarine instead of butter, and turned out well.

My mistake in making this was using a little Splenda brown sugar baking blend. It definitely needs a full cup of regular-old brown sugar or else the crust/strudel is a little difficult to work with. Regardless, the end result was moist and yummy!

I really like these; they were easy to put together and they tasted really good. I would definately make these again and perhaps experiment with other fruit fillings. I did add some cinnamon to the struesel.

This recipe was a real disappointment, to say the least. As "the baker" in the family, I can tell you that I will not be making this recipe again. I followed the recipe to the "t" (except I used fresh blueberries) and all I got was a hard bottom crust that was extremely hard to cut. The recipe needed more blueberries and more toppping / crust. I made this for a get together for some friends. They thought what I made was a crumble, rather than bars. I agreed with them. This was more of a crumble. No, my bars didn't fall apart like some other reviews, mine were the opposite, too hard. Cutting was a lot of work. Next time, I'll try plain lemon bars.

Made these for a potluck situation this summer. It received rave reviews and I got several requests for the recipe. I used fresh blueberries instead of frozen, since they were in season.

The addition of lemon zest makes all the difference in flavor. Otherwise, the bars are reminiscent of an average blueberry crisp (with crumbs both on top and bottom).

The first time I made this it was good, but I have added a few simple tweaks that make it fantastic. 1. Add 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon to the crust mixture. 2. Use 2 rounded teaspoons lemon rind instead of 1 1/2. 3. Use strawberry jam instead of raspberry (the raspberry is too sweet and overpowers the blueberry flavor). 4. Press about 2/3 of the crust into the bottom of the pan instead of just 1/2. Enjoy!

I bake professionally, and these delicious bars are part of my repetoire. I also use a little more lemon zest. I've always used thawed, frozen wild blueberries with great success. They definitely need to be served same day, however; if held overnight, the filling makes the crust very soft. Still delicious to eat, but without the nice contrast of crisp crust/soft filling.

Made modifications that (if I may say so myself) greatly improved the results: 1. Substitute 1/8 - 1/4 cup of butter with oil. 2. Add a small amount of granola which provides more substance. 3. Use a layer of jam or similar (eg: boil dried fruit with water to soften then food process it). My kids loved it, so you know it's a winner!

Great! Used half whole wheat flour and half regular, scant cup brown sugar instead of firmly packed, four cups fresh blueberries instead of frozen, strawberry Polaner All Fruit instead of jam, lime zest instead of lemon, and added one cup chopped pecans to the final streusel. Definitely try these!

I really enjoyed these bars, however, I thought the recipe called for too much butter. I think my crust was a bit greasy, still tasted fabulous, but I didn't like that your fingers were greasy after you ate one. Next time I will reduce the butter to mayeb 1.5 sticks or less.

definetly use fresh blueberries. i have added variations of raspberries or blackberries, but always use blueberry jam. a touch more lemon zest gives everything a nice tart flavor. bake the crust about 5 minutes longer.

I'm not crazy about blueberries, however this recipe made my mouth water. I added a little extra butter and had no problems with the crust. I also used blackberry jam, dried grated lemon zest and my own homegrown blueberries. This is one that's a keeper!

I love these bars! I find the blueberries a little too bland for my taste, so I switched to using a combination of blueberries, marion berries, and raspberries (Remlinger Farms' berry medley in the freezer section of most Seattle grocers). The flavor is fabulous. For those who have trouble with them crumbling, I use a paster cutter to cut the butter into the dry ingredients (plus I use slightly softened butter instead of cold). Make sure that you press the crumbs into the pan firmly when making the crust.

This is a great recipe, it is super simple and delicious! I've used both fresh and frozen berries with success. I substituted the flour with 3 tablespoons of tapioca starch and haven't experienced the bars falling apart. I omitted the lemon zest, but added cinnamon.

I followed another reviewers suggestion to use some buttermilk in the recipe and I ended up with a less-than appetizing, slightly spongy dessert. After wasting a good deal of our fresh blueberries, I probably won't bother trying to make these again.

I made these as a dessert for a casual cocktail party recently and they received rave reviews! I did not experience the crust falling apart at all, but did knead the butter into the flour and oats longer than instructed. I also made with the bars with fresh blueberries and they were delicious!

Wonderful! They did fall apart, but who cares. I just spooned some ice cream over the bars. Have made it twice so far. Would recommend it!

I've made these several times, with varying fruit. Every time they were great tasting. My kids and everyone I've served them to, loves em. Once, I had the problem of them falling apart like the PA reviewer, but they still tasted great. I don't know why they fall apart that ONE time, but haven't since. She should try to make them again. This is a thumbs up all the way recipe.

This was a big disappointment. Although the bars, and I use that term loosely, had a good taste, they were too soft and fell apart in my hands at room temperature. Would not make them again.

I'm too cheap to put in the blueberries, so here's changes I made. I think they could almost be called "PB&J Bars"! Great and easy. crust: used only 1.5 sticks of butter added cinnamon filling: 1)put on 1 cup butterscotch chips, did not spread though 2)omitted flour--seemed potentially goopy just stirred up the jam really well and poured over the chips (but not spread) Baked 30 minutes. Good!

I made this for a dessert catering tray I was putting together. It was a hit----all gone and added some nice blue colour to the tray. I used more of the crumbs for the bottom so that the topping would not cover the top completely as I wanted some colour. VERY tasty and so easy. Just pulled some blueberries out of the freezer and a jar of homemade raspberry jam and it's done. I'd highly recommend it!

These bars are better than the berry bars sold at Starbucks!! I cut down the sugar by 1/4 cup - still taste great. I have made them using any leftover frozen fruit (blueberries, rasberries or boysenberries).

I made this for my sister's moving day and it was a big hit (and I used up the extra berries in the fridge!) Definitely cut down on the butter AND the sugar - 3/4 c. was still too much, I'll probably go with 2/3 c. next time. I also added extra fruit - raspberries especially. The touch of cinnamon suggested by another reviewer was a nice addition, and I did a mix of jams (strawberry, raspberry and blackberry). I'll definitely make this again - simple and good as a breakfast or dessert.

I couldn't resist a sale on blueberries and scourred this site to pick the perfect recipt to showcase them...my family and I weren't sorry. This recipe is very easy to make with pantry friendly ingredients I already had on hand. I eliminated one stick of butter and added a little buttermilk instead. Moist and "crummy" tasting...but in a good way. The blueberries tartness was a nice complement to the sweetness of the jam. Might try making with homemade lemon curd instead of the jam next time.

These were sooo easy and yummy too. I halved the recipe and made them in an 8x8, so I was a little short on streusel, but they were still good. I added raspberries, which gave them a great tartness; I think they might have been a little bland with just blueberries.

I enjoyed this recipe with minor adjustments. Since I love nuts, I added 1 cup of chopped walnuts to the streusel mixture and used 1 package of fresh cranberries instead of blueberries. I even mixed 1 - 8 ounce pkg. of Neufchatel cream cheese with apricot preserves (available preserves in my cabinet!)then carefully mixed in the fresh cranberries. I sprinkled 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips (can use chocolate also) on top of the crust after the crust's first baking before fruit mixture was spread. The bars were delicious and tart, which I prefer, not too sweet.

Thought it needed more fruit than called for, but the flavor was great. Will try with different fruit combos and add some spice next time.

This is a very easy recipe, and it is interchangeable with other fruit. I used Stonewall Kitchen Wild Maine Blueberry Jam instead of the raspberry.They were a huge hit at work. I also tried chopped peaches mixed with a strawberry-apricot jam. Another hit. Would definitely make this again!

Wonderful! Easy and beautiful too. I followed the recipe pretty much as written, except I took the advice of the cook from Bonita Springs, FL, and sprinkled a bit of ground cinnamon over the top of the bars just before their last baking. These hold up well and are a big hit. Who doesn't love blueberries?

I added some walnuts and alittle cinnamon. Basically simple and usable.

Since fresh strawberries are in season, I chopped up a pint of them and used blueberry jam. Because the strawberries were somewhat tart, I also omitted the lemon peel. This variation turned out very well--the filling smelled really good! The bars didn't disappoint, either!
