Simple, flexible and easy. Made twice - first exactly as written and second used diced canned tomatoes. Both good, but of course, fresh was better. Great side or first coarse.

This is one of my favorite pastas - been making it for years. It impresses company, but it's also fast and easy for a last-minute weeknight dinner. I've begun playing with the recipe - I like it as written, but I also like substituting minced chives for the garlic and basil, which gives it a totally different, more mellow flavor. To the reviewer concerned about cooked tomatoes - your tomatoes really shouldn't cook in the 5 minutes you spend mixing everything together over the heat. They retain their crunch and it's part of what makes the recipe great.

This is a great recipe and has become a family staple. I have served it for guests as well with rave reviews. It's terrific for a weeknight dinner or entertaining when you want something that can be put together at the last minute. I usually try to use fresh rigatoni and often up the garlic and red pepper flakes. Yummy!

This dish is addicting for anyone who loves pasta, tomatoes and CHEESE! When I first made the dish, I had a serving of it and thought it was "so-so" (note that I did not include the olives because I do not like olives). The next day, I ate the rest of it all by myself. It was pure gluttony and pure enjoyment! Not good for a crowd - just make it for yourself and eat it while reading a really good book.

Due to what I had on hand, I used mozzarella di bufala instead of brie and chopped up some tomatoes from my garden instead of the cherry tomatoes. Fabulous, easy, fresh.

i'm debating on making this, I just can't stand cooked tomatoes or olives. Perhaps adding some apples.....grapes? or is that too dessert-y??

I love this recipe because 1 - it's easy and 2 - it's really tasty! What more could you ask for? Perfect as a main weekday meal, or weekend side dish.

Four stars all the way. Creamy goodness. Ok, made some substitutions, used some turkey italian sausage broken up for my meat-loving boyfriend. Secondly, like another recipe, I crushed the tomatoes with a spoon when cooking (about half of them) to release some of the juices. Finally, I had rindless brie because I bought the El Presidente individually wrapped brie wedges. These worked out great, I used about 14 of them and didnt have to remove the rind on the brie. I ate so much of this I am still full!

We really liked this and it was very easy. I, too, used about 3/4 c. of basil (all my plants could spare) and a little bit less brie (probably 10 oz) and it was delicious. Will make again for company, and wouldn't change anything although I might try more basil if I can spare it.

this recipe was SO GOOD. it's actually been awhile since i've given 4 forks. this was sooo easy to make (minimal prep and cooking) and was absolutely delicious. i could only spare 1/2 a cup of basil from my herb garden (the only one that's not proliferating...), it was still great. perfect amount of olives, the grape tomatoes were tasty, the brie made a nice cheesy glaze (why would it need olive oil?). used whole wheat rigtoni which was a good texture. this recipe was awesome.

This recipe was fabulous. You must like tomatoes, because they add the majority of the flavor. My husband picked all of his tomatoes out and he thought it was bland. But the brie made a very nice light but cheesy coating on the pasta. I cooked the garlic and tomatoes for a minute or two before adding the cheese. I also left out the olives, and it was delicious. It also made great leftovers. I can't wait to make it again.

I made this exactly as the recipe, and it was delicious. My meat-eater husband wasn't all that excited with this, so I served the pasta as a side dish for the grilled lamb chops, the second time. He loved it. It is very easy to make, and the clean-up is next to none. Great recipe!

As much as I LOVE brie, I made this with those Laughing Cow light wedges to make it lower in fat for a weeknight dinner and I thought it was delcious and very easy! I also upped the garlic.

Made a tasty sauce but I'd recommend a few changes---less basil, more red pepper, longer cooking time to melt cheese, and a sprinkle of parmesan at the end for a nice saltiness. Probably won't make again---I prefer mascarpone for a creamy sauce.

This dish was very yummy and I will definetly be making it again. It got rave reviews from the 2 people I made it for, it was easy and quick to make as well. I added a little extra garlic, used a full 1lb of the pasta and next time I would even add some more tomatoes.

I loved this recipe. It was very easy to make and the basil and olives gave it great flavor (I added extra garlic, but in our household that's a given). Had no problem with the tomatoes separating because they really weren't cooked - the whole mixture was just tossed with the pasta until the brie melted, which was only a minute or so.

I make a similar dish that is a fresh italian sauce and I believe it is superior in taste and easy clean up to boot. Mix chopped garlic (5 or more cloves) chopped fresh tomatoes, chopped basil and brie with a fair amount of olive oil. Let it sit to marinnate for 6 hours or more at room temp. Then add the hot pasta and toss. Fantastic!

I really liked this. I sauteed the garlic and red pepper in a little olive oil then added the cheese and other ingredients and very quickly tossed that with the hot pasta and pasta water. Very fresh tasting, very simple, good with a green salad.

We found it quite nice and flavourful, but not outstanding. Since it's just the two of us I halved most of the recipe but used the full amount of basil and olives, and I'm happy I did as that likely boosted the flavour. We paired the dish with a crisp salad of romaine hearts and cucumber.

Both my husband and I felt this was totally tasteless, and a waste of good brie. When grape tomatoes are heated, the skin separates and makes them less palatable. Since I have so much left over, I will try to rectify it by ading some olive oil, ricotta cheese, and perhaps some red onion, etc..

This is standard fare at our church potlucks... it's better without the olives, IMO. Pair it with something simple; it's very rich.

Simple and elegant, definately makes a statement. Sometimes a large pasta, such as rigatoni usually denotes "peasant fare", but not so. My guests really liked this.

I added some grilled chicken and it made a quick, delicious meal! I will definitely make it again.
