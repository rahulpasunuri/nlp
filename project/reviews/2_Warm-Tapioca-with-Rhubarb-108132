I found the tapioca to be bland and lifeless. The rhubarb helped to revive it, but this is a really mediocre recipe. I was disappointed, as tapioca and rhubarb are two of my favorite foods.

We all loved it - great mix of wonderful tart and sweet.

The rhubarb sauce was delicious, but I didn't care for the tapioca; it was bland. I think the sauce would be very good with a traditional tapioca recipe.

Wasn't very impressed with the rhubarb portion of this recipe.

The tapioca was good and so was the rhubarb topping, but I will use less topping on each serving if I make it again. I thought it overpowered the taste of the tapioca. This recipe was fun and easy to make.
