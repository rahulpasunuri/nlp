I am a caterer and use this soup frequently during the summer months. It is light and refreshing. The addition of coursely chopped shrimp and chives for garnish makes it lovely for a luncheon entree.

This soup is nicely spicy; mine tasted vaguely of horseradish. It probably depends on what kind of mustard you use. I used superfine dry mustard. The cut-up peppers make for a bright confetti effect, so this is a pretty soup. The flavor didn't grab me enough to want to make it again, however.

A very delicious, easy, perfect-for-warm-weather soup. The dry mustard gives it a tsty kick. If you can get good, fresh pickling cucumbers, use them;then you won't have to bother to seed them. This recipe is very forgiving--you can change the proportions very successfully.
