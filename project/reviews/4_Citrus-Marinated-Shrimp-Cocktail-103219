This recipe was a huge hit with all my girlfriends - lots of recipe requests! Liked how it could be made ahead of time. Prepared it just as recipe states and it was excellent!!!

In order to avoid fresh shrimp having a poor texture, try boiling the fruit juices with spices, take off the heat, add raw shrimp, let sit for 5 min. or so and refrigerate.

It is with some regret that I give such a low rating...the marinade is very very good, but I have tried this recipe by marinating cooked shrimp (as called for)...very rubbery; so I tried using raw shrimp, marinating and then cooking ... same thing...the flavours of the marinade are pleasing, but could not compensate for the unappealing texture...if someone has any other insight I would welcome it, but based on my experience to date, I could not recommend this to others (which pains me, because Epicurious recipes with 4 fork overall ratings are usually successes).

This was a huge hit at our New Years party. Sent everyone for the recipe here. Made it exactly as the recipe called .... so good

I made this for our New Years Eve party. We always have shrimp and I wanted to do something different than plain steamed shrimp with good homemade cocktail sauce. Next year I will return to our simple, elegant standard.

I made this for a Christmas party and it was a big hit. I used large, cooked, frozen shrimp with tails on and made no other changes from the original recipe. Marinated it all day, then drained it before serving. It was a perfect appetizer for a cocktail party. I will do it again for a summer party.

A great change from traditional boiled shrimp cocktail! Next time (tomorrow!) I will undercook the shrimp - they continue to 'cook' in the marinade. I omitted the vodka and still had plenty of liquid for marinating the shrimp. Usually we don't like cilantro so I used about 1/2 and it was just right. Great for a picnic!

Excellent flavors! This appetizer was the hit of my Valentines Day dinner. I added just a touch more hot pepper sauce and also some freshly ground black pepper. Half of the marinade recipe was ample for this amount of shrimp.

Everyone of my guests loved them. Next time I will add more hot sauce.

We just made this and it got rave reviews. We used 41- 50/lb shrimp, frozen then thawed, which we cooked in boiling water for 90 seconds then plunged into ice water. We left out onions because my husband doesn't like them. Everyone asked for the recipe.

I just made this recipe using 4 pounds of shrimp. I didn't double the marinade ingredients and it came out great. Slightly undercooked the shrimp, marinatd for about 2 hours and the shrimp were tender and juicy. I did substitute horseradish for the hot sauce. Next time, I'll put less red onions and leave out the vodka. I don't think it added anything.

We've all gotten tired of the same ol', same ol' Shrimp with Cocktail Sauce(especially if it's frozen Costco shrimp and bottled sauce!). This recipe is a nice new twist on an old standby and eveytime I serve it, guests rave and request the recipe. So easy, too!

Made this for a cocktail party and gave it a new name - "80 Proof Prawns." It was absolutely delicious!!! Used freshly boiled extra large shrimp - everyone loved them!!

Outstanding...shrimp do get tougher as they sit, but I've made this twice in a month to rave reviews. Serve with avocado on the side...they're delicious as one mouthful.

I have made this recipe twice for cocktail parties with great success. I think the key is to barely cook the shrimp. Also, I cook the shrimp with the poached shrimp recipe from Joy of Cooking: 1/4 cup sliced onion, celery ribs w/ leaves, clove of garlic, bay leaf, TBSP and 1/2 of kosher salt. After two minutes, I plunge the shrimp in ice and then add it to the marinade. I've never marinated the shrimp for over three hours, maybe that helps too.

I think the key to this recipe is not over-cooking the shrimp. I found it easy to make and delicious. My guests loved it.

Outstanding and easy. I usually make exactly as written, but sometimes add chopped jalepeno and/or toss in a small amount of chopped grape tomatoes right before serving to add a little color.

Super easy recipe, very fresh tasting. I made it in December for my daughter's birthday party, but I think it would be even more enjoyable in the summer time. Definitely a keeper!

Excellent and easy! I used salad shrimp and substituted lime juice for the lemon juice and added 1 heaping tsp of horseradish. Served in a martini glass over shredded iceberg lettuce.

Excellent appetizer! I have made it many times and am always asked for the recipe. The only change I make is to add 1 heaping tbsp. of creamy horseradish which adds just the right tang/bite to this dish. Enjoy!

I have made this many, many times and each time I am asked for the recipe! Do not over-marinate as the shrimp do indeed get tough. The fresher the ingredients the better. I always fill a large glass bowl about 1/2 way with ice, cover with lettuce leaves and then the shrimp. Top with some fresh lemon and orange slices - it's beautiful and tasty.

This is a wonderful recipe! I prepared it for a cocktail party, and guests raved. My brother, who has spent quite a lot of time in the Mediterranean, said it reminded him of food he's had there. Loved it, and will prepare it again.

This was a big hit, the first appetizer to go! Very nice flavors, very pretty presentation even if you just dump it on the plate from the stainer!I will definitely make this again--had to give out the recipe to guests.

Have made this several times using thawed, precooked,21-25 to the lb frozen shrimp from Costco. If I don't grab one before serving, there are never any left for me. I have found that with this size shrimp, the suggested marinating time is perfect. At last, a simple, delicious recipe that does not need reworking.

This is not the spectacular marinated shrimp recipe that you are seeking. The taste is okay(the marinade was actually lovely), the presentation is fine, but the end result was just so-so. Beware of that fine line between overmarinated=chewy vs. undermarinated=bland. Didn't receive rave reviews, and guests did not attack it like they should.

I tried this recipe this weekend for an appetizer party. It was a big success. Everyone commented about how great it tasted and wanted the recipe. After reading the reviews I decided to marinade the shrimp first and then cooked them on skewers. Not only did they taste sensational but they looked great. Definetely added to my list for appetizers.

modified this a bit. used uncooked shrimp. marinated and then grilled on the BBQ. Cooked the leftover marinade over the BBQ and served together in bowl (the flavours were amazing!). delicious! I loved the marinade and think it is better cooked. The shrimp were tough - don't know if it was b/c they were pre-frozen or cooked too long in the marinade. Loved the combo of flavors though. Maybe another meat or seafood? but great idea.

I have never tried this recipe, but I know that cooked shrimp does not hold a marinade well, and if soaked too long it will become very chewy and lose its tenderness. The ceviche idea is much better.

Rating: 2
This recipe has potential. After reading the recipe and reviews I decided to try 'cooking' the shrimp in the mariade - 1 cup of fresh lemon juice, why not? I let the shrimp marinate overnight. This did not fully 'cook' the shrimp and I didn't expect it too. So I finished the cooking process by slightly sauteing the shrimp and then added them back to the marinade for an hour just to chill. They turned out tough and chewy BUT very flavorful. IF I make this recipe again I will try marinating cooked shrimp overnight and see if the flavors penetrate.

Delicious! I made this as an appetizer for a party and everyone loved it. It was a welcomed change from your normal shrimp cocktail. I did marinate it for at least 6 hours which I am sure added to the success.

Just a few questions...Wouldn't this recipe take the form of a shrimp ceviche if one marinated uncooked shrimp in the citrus marinade overnight? Wouldn't it be more flavorful... as the shrimp would be "cooked" by its marinade? I think I'm going to try this my way, and get back to you. In my experience, cooked shrimp does not hold a marinade well.

I marinated this for three hours, and could only slightly taste the flavor on the shrimp. Apparently, you must marinate this dish longer in order to bring out the flavor. Many of my guests couldn't even tell they were marinated, they thought they were eating plain cocktail shrimp. I will try this again, because it sounds delicious, but I will definitely let them soak for longer this time.

What an interesting dish! I served this as the seafood course, just before serving Spicy Gazpacho (another fabulous recipe from Epicurious.com) on a very hot day, and everyone loved it. It's so easy to prepare and so delicious, why wouldn't I make it again?

This was a very tasty recipe - only comment was that there were too many onions. I will only use half the amount of onion next time. It was very easy to make.

This was very good, great as an appetizer. I would suggest being more creative with the shrimp, however. The next time I prepare this I'll probably buy some uncooked shrimp, and try them in some different marinades and then grill them, set aside to cool, then add them to the mixture in the recipe. This is definitely a winner.
