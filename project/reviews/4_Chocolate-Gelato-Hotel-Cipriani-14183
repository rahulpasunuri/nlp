When I make this gelato, friends tell me it's the best they've ever had. I keep making it for my friends but I enjoy making it best for my husband.

I love chocolate. I love dense gelato. But this recipe... not great. In order to get the hardened melted sugar to melt into the milk, I had to cook it for quite a while which reduced the milk considerably. Maybe that's why, when I added the cup of cocoa powder it thickened into a pudding? I definitely couldn't pour it into the egg/sugar mixture "in streams" - more like dump it in, in glops. It thinned out a bit when mixed with the egg/sugar/chocolate, but it was still so dense, I added a few tablespoons more milk. Even then, it was so thick it didn't need churning in the ice cream maker. I put it directly in the freezer and it's like fudge. And not in a good way. Lots of effort for weird weird weird.

This is incredible gelato. Use the best chocolate you can find as it makes a difference. Great mouth feel.

Excellent - very rich. Worth the work. Letting it set up is a must. I would probalby add more milk next time.

My thought while making this gelato was, "This better be worth all the work and dirty dishes". It totally was. . . I want to eat it all right now. I added 1c half and half to tone down the intense chocolate and added fresh raspberries during the last two minutes of being in the ice cream maker. Scrumptious.

The emperor is naked and running around like a kid who's overdosed on chocolate gelato. I just returned from Italy and enjoyed dozens of gelato recipes while I was there; this recipe is actually too thick and rich to enjoy as written. The consistency would be fine for any other flavor, but the amount of chocolate suggested is overwhelming. And yes, I am a chocolate lover, so it pains me to admit I've been overdosed. I made a double batch with Scharffen Berger Bittersweet chocolate and my end was result was frozen fudge. I adjusted by adding 2 cups of milk (no cream on hand) and a bag of frozen black cherries. Now we're getting somewhere delicious! So, make this recipe a pinch of caution: go light on the cocoa and have extra cream or milk on hand to add when you find yourself panicked, in the thick and agreeing with many of these reviews. Otherwise, it is outrageously good and I will make a version of it again.

I've made no less than 10 recipes looking for the perfect chocolate. This is THE ONE. The base was so thick...almost like a frosting or flourless cake batter. Churning this ultra thick base nearly burned out my maker. I added a cup of cream (so that's 2 cups whole milk + 1 cup cream) and it's perfect. Very thick and creamy.

This is the 2nd time I made this..it was such a huge hit the first time. I also added almost boiling milk to the caramel, and this time I used less cocoa, only 1/2 cup cocoa. Also, I made it chocolate chip with cherries. It is the BEST! The "chocolate chip" was done by melting 3 oz. semi- sweet chocolate and then adding 2 Tblsp. canola oil to the melted chocolate. I added it to the ice cream in the ice cream maker at the very last minute.

I have died and gone to heaven. This is incredible. The flavor is intensely chocolate and the texture is ultra smooth. I followed the cook from Georgia's suggestions on streamlining the preparation; this worked very well. Next time, I will add a hint of orange.

This did take time in the freezer to set up, but I had a good result, very rich. However, I made the mistake of using semi-sweet instead of bittersweet chocolate chips. The result was too sweet. I can see why others found this "too chocolately." I'm looking forward to making this again with bittersweet chocolate. I didn't really understand the purpose of cooling the caramel and then reheating it again.

A Big Hit. Super rich and perfectly creamy. I cheated as others suggested, and poured almost-boiling milk over the still hot caramel to reduce the prep time. I also added 1/4 Cabernet Port right at the end -- it added an extra level of flavor and really made the gelato stand out. at thanksgiving dinner, with 2 ice creams, 2 pies, pumpkin mousse and banana bread all on the table, this was the one dessert that not only did everyone finish, but some actually had seconds of.

This is an excellent recipe for chocolate gelato. My results were thick, smooth and very chocolaty. Very much like the tons of gelato I have eaten in Rome, Florence, Venice, Orvieto, etc. For my electric gelato machine, it took about 30 minutes to freeze up. Enjoy!

This is an excellent recipe. It's the real gelato. I will use the caramel process for all of my gelatos from now one. Excellent. YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS RECIPE!

This is the best chocolate gelato I've ever had. I'm going to add the caramel technique to my next gelato for that amaziing texture. It's much more chocolatey than fudge, it's as chocolatey as you can get, which is just what I'm after in a chocolate gelato. Pour the hot milk right over the liquid caramel but take it off the heat to guard from boiling over. The recipe is otherwise very simple, though it does need some time in the freezer to firm it up.

This gelato is divine...so chocolatty! I think it is very much like the really good gelati I have had in Italy. Enjoyed it very much!

I'm searching for the perfect gelato recipe and although this was good, I would not make it again. It was way too rich and bitter. It tasted like cold fudge. I don't know if it was the chocolate or not.

This was AMAZING! I followed the suggestions given by Lawrenceville, GA and this really made the process much faster! I served it at a dinner party and every one was in love. I added a sprig of mint and some fresh raspberries for presentation. One note: I have a Kitchenaid ice cream maker attachment and with this, it took ~40min before the gelato was converted and it still needed a couple hours in the freezer to get to the correct consistency.

To those who feel that this recipe is "Americanized": Please note the source of the recipe, "Letters From Italy." In other words, this recipe originated in Italy, and (IMO) is a fairly traditional Northern Italian gelato formula. And, it's very good! It is very dense, due to the cocoa butter from the chocolate.

I used Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate & organic whole milk. My husband, who is an ice cream/gelato connoisseur said this was the best ice cream he ever ate! Very rich, very chocolatey, very yummy!

Very smooth and rich with deep chocolate flavor. I tweaked the recipe so I could use ingredients I already had on hand: 2 oz. Baker's UNsweetened chocolate and about 2 ounces dark chocolate chips, 1 1/3 cups sugar, 2/3 cup cocoa, 2 cups half-n-half, and the four egg yolks. We're chocolate snobs, and this was a big hit!

If you love chocolate, this is a fantastic recipe. The consistency was very rich and creamy. I substituted light cream for the milk...a good choice. Exactly what gelato should be!

This was ok. Not exactly up to par but better than overly sweet commercial variety available in this country. I have to agree with the reviewer from Florida, I'm sure this recipe has been adapted for, as she phased it, the crude american palate.

I really didn't like this very much. I think it might have been too chocolately for me (which is strage). Maybe I didn't used good enough chocolate or thought it was too much work.

If you love chocolate, you will love this frozen treat. I used 1% milk to try to cut a little fat, and it still turned out great! Even though I don't like repeating recipies, I have already made it three times!!!

This recipe gives you gelato with a great texture and consistency; however, it was too rich for me. I agree that it can improved with less cocoa. I also simplified the recipe and threw the bittersweet chocolate into the milk mixture to melt, and it turned out great. I will make the recipe again, but I will half the amount of cocoa.

This was easily the best frozen dessert I've ever made, with a texture equal to any professionally made product. It's true the custard that goes into the freezer is very thick; that may aid the encorporation of air into the gelato during the freezing process, which I understand is the key to it not becoming a solid block of ice. I used cocoa sifted into a 1-cup measure; that seemed to be plenty. Roasted nuts would be a perfect addition.

This recipe is great for true dark chocolate lovers. It's amazingly rich. I made it with 2/3 cup Penzy's dutch process coco powder and I can't imagine it would be any better with the full cup. The recipe takes time (I didn't think the caramel would ever melt back into the milk!) but is worth it. Really good with a nice strong after dinner coffee!

Taste and texture was more like frozen chocolate fudge ( if it is possible to imagine such a thing )than gelato . Overly sweet and impossibly gooey .I used all the best ingridients( french bittersweet and cocoa from Holland -not the supermarket variety) and I fell sorry for spoiling so much good stuff .Next time in Venice I'll make sure to check if their gelato really is like this "thing" or this recipe was somehow " adapted" to the crude american palates. the only "good" use for this recipe is to treat severe cases of PMS :)

My husband who loves gelato, says this rates with the very best! I thought it was almost too chocolaty, but maybe I didn't measure accurately!

I serve this gelato to hard-core chocoholics. They swoon. It requires concentration to make, but the results are worth it. Use only a top quality chocolate like Callebaut or Valrhona and a premium cocoa (I use Penzey's) for best results. One pitfall - I have to freeze it in batches, or it stresses the motor on my ice cream freezer. It's thick!
