I had high hopes for this sandwich but it was very bland to me. I even used a Costco rotisserie chicken which is full of flavor. Maybe more lime juice, more jalapeno.

These sandwiches are a HUGE hit with my family. We have them all the time and people beg me for the recipe. We have also bought roasted red peppers when we don't have time to make our own, and we use sourdough bread from the local bakery. Two other changes that I'd recommend trying are substituting MAPLE yogurt for the sour cream (this gives the spread a lovely, slight sweetness) and using "Lemonaise" (from The Ojai Cook) instead of regular mayonnaise. If you are out of mayo, please beware of using Miracle Whip. I did that once and it completely ruined the spread. It really needs authentic mayo. I am not usually a fan of mayonnaise, but as an ingredient for this recipe, some decent mayo is a must.

Terribly dissappointed-I followed the recipe to the letter, and I could only taste the cilantro and the jalapeno. I LOVE cilantro, and all the ingredients, but after making it, I thought I would have happily put fresh cilantro and drizzled lime on the sandwich, and I'd have been happier-(And I LOVE spicy food) Just really didn't have a multilayered flavor, which I thought I'd get, based on all the reviews. This is the first time EVER that I have reviewed a recipe on Epicurious negatively....

Delicious! I used yogourt instead of sour cream and still had great results. I didn't have jalapenos, but found it was still very flavourful. Next time I will get some to try the full recipe.

I normally do not take the time to rate a recipe but this sandwich was so full of flavor and easy to make I had to write a post. The only thing I did differently was use lemon instead of lime and I didn't have any almonds and it was so delisious!!!

Truly enjoyed this sandwich and will make it again!

The star of this recipe is the relish. We grilled the chicken breasts & used roasted red peppers in the sandwiches. We also used tortillas and made wraps. The relish, which we made the day before, was great! We used parsley instead of cilantro - I know, it really changed the flavor but it was still excellent. We will definitely make these again. Nice picnic food.

I love this recipe! I made it with red peppers instead of yellow on ciabatta bread. Will definately make more of this one.

Gorgeous sandwiches, fabulous taste! Have made it exactly as written. Now I make these as finger sandwiches. I add a couple tablespoons sugar to the relish and then stir in a can of chicken breast to make a chicken salad (don't shoot me!). Have also used canned roasted red peppers when I didn't have time to do my own. People still go bananas over the flavor combination. Will continue to make regularly.

What a great sandwich!! Like another cook, I bought the roasted peppers to save time. The first time I made the relish, I didn't use jalapenos but the second time, I used them and it was amazing. Will definitely make this again.

This is a fantastic sandwich!!! I used Ciabatta bread for mine and really slathered on the spread. It kept me happy for a whole week and I'm making more soon! Enjoy this recipe!

This was so good and a big hit with my husband and also made it when friends have come round. I make the relish with my Jalapeno as prefer it hotter. I also use the peppers from a jar of sweet roasted peppers. Excellent!!!

Oh yeah. I agree about poached chicken. Didn't try it but sure it would be blah. Leftover chicken is great. Making a sack lunch for work shouldn't be a hassle. I also used red bell peppers. LOVE them and their sweetness over any other ones.

I pack my own lunches to work and this recipe was delicious! I didn't process the ingredients since I didn't want to clean a processor just for one sandwich and didn't know if I would like the recipe or not. Therefore I diced all the ingredients. I used leftover grilled chicken I had for dinner. (I threw the pepper on the grill as well.) I also added Sriracha (sp) sauce to the mayo and didn't have so omitted the sour cream. I toasted sour dough bread and proceeded to make the sandwich. I took a taste bite and wasn't impressed. I wrapped it up and stuck it in the fridge for lunch next day. Wow! The stay in the fridge infused all the flavors! It's definitely a keeper. I love to cook so never really follow the recipe but rather use it as a guide and add whatever I have. I'm curious to follow this recipe as instructed now to see if it'll taste even better. Still have some leftover chicken so will be making it again tonight for my boyfriend's lunch tomorrow.

Terrific lunch to tote to work...I made the following adjustments: I grilled the peppers and chicken breasts after a short marinade in olive oil and lemon juice. I didn't bother to peel the peppers...just grilled the halves and then sliced into strips. My bush-league local grocery store did not have cilantro, so I used a mix of basil and parsley, 1/3 c. toasted pine nuts, omitted the jalopeno, and used lemon juice instead of lime juice. Served the whole in a flour tortilla. Yummy!! Looking forward next time to the cilantro version.

The cilantro relish is delicious, but I don't think the poached chicken and roasted peppers add as much to the sandwich as they could. Maybe if the chicken was seasoned it would be better.

I was reading so many recipes last night trying to have something to go along with Dry rubbed baby back ribs. I saw the recipe and the great reviews for this cilantro relish, and was reading another for a carrot salad, I forgot they were separate recipes and so proceeded to make a carrot salad with the cilantro relish, grated 3 carrots and left the sliced almonds as they were just toasted them, put the other ingredients in- the best carrot salad ever and a great side for the ribs. I may add raisins next time for a hint of sweet but this was so good!

This is fabulous! I took the easy way out and purchased roasted red peppers which cut the prep time down considerably. If you're looking for a "lo-cal" alternative, substituting plain yogurt for the sour cream and mayo works beautifully.

This was delicious! I changed it a bit though- I marinated the chicken in lime, sugar, and cilantro overnight and then grilled it. I substituted cucumber slices for the peppers. I used the large ciabatta buns from costco and cut the sandwiches in half.

I thought this was alot of work for what ended to be an ok sandwich. My teenage boys ate one then wanted a regular sandwich for seconds. The relish is, as others have stated, very good and worth the effort. This recipe could probably be halfed and still would end up with 6 sandwiches.

Rating: 3
Agree with previous reviews, the spread is delicious and versatile. Recipe is very tasty as written, but I believe you could add ANY roasted chile you like. Tweak the bread the same way. Ciabatta would be wonderful, as would a mexican bolillo. Add greenery like butter lettuce, watercress, etc. Definitely will make a tweaked version often.

Ditto the previous comment about keeping a jar of the relish on hand for a super sandwich spread. The combination of sandwich ingredients is superb but the winner is the relish. Cilantro rules!

This was delicious and my guests loved it. "What's on this?" was a common question as the gobbled up another sandwich. I substituted the chicken with roasted turkey that I purchased at the deli, which saved time.

The relish is fabulous!!! Made the complete sandwich, which is a great combination of flavors, but I had to restrain myself from sticking my fingers in the relish and eating it all. I intend on keeping a small jar full of the relish as an instant, delicious sandwich spread.

I used the relish as a spread on a spinach wrap and then added grilled chicken, baby romaine and didn't bother roasting the yellow peppers...just chopped them up raw. Rolled the wrap and then lightly browned in a skillet. Yummy quick lunch! Next time I may add some sliced avocado.

The cilantro relish is quite wonderful. Worthy to be made on its own and used in any way you can think of. Friends gobbled it down like it was a main dish!

I also got lots of complements on this from the younger generation of my household. I thought the almonds sounded/would be odd in mayonaise, but ground up they gave a lovely subtle crunchiness. I made the following changes: grilled the chicken, since it is August, used roasted red peppers from a jar to save time, and didn't add sour cream since we keep kosher and don't mix milk with meat. THere was not the slightest hint of bitterness to the mayonaise, so perhaps that was from the sour cream. Served this with an Israeli salad- finely chopped cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, carrots with a little oil and vinegar, and a peach pie at Ravinia, the outdoor summer home of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, where everyone picnics and tries to outdo the next with elegant food and wine. We didn't have wine, flowers, and candles on a little table like our neighbors, but I felt suitably well cuisined.

Don't know what I'm missing. I followed the recipe to the word, and it's just too sour and strange-tasting. There are much better chicken sandwich recipes out there.

What a yummy sandwich! The almond-cilantro mixture is absolutely wonderful. Next time I make this, I will use the almond-cilantro mixture on pasta or serve it as a dipping sauce for chips.

I thought these sandwiches were great for entertaining--the perfect finger sandwich. They would also be wonderful on a picnic. You might concider adding more cilantro, garlic and jalapeno to the almond paste, or introduce a new element--soy sauce or tabasco would be good.

I shamefully added a couple of teaspoons of sugar to augment appeal to the masses. Without it, the relish did seem a little tart/bitter. The sandwiches were wonderful and received rave reviews. Flavorful and wonderful combination of ingredients. A good quality bread, of course, is a must. I bought a good dense white sourdough loaf which was presliced from my local all-organic-make-eveything-from-scratch-everyday baker. (If you do not have one of these in your area, you are missing something!) I served these sandwiches for a large teenage cast party, and they were some of the very first items to be gobbled up... the hotdogs and Sloppy Joe's were barely touched. So much for teenage sterotypes: I learned many of them actually have a hankering for gourmet delights.

Made this with the CHICKEN, WATERCRESS, AND AVOCADO SANDWICH WITH TARRAGON AIOLI for the Fourth of July in Riverfront Park in Spokane. We had 16 people and making both of these recipes gave people a good choice. I am not big on peppers of any sort but this recipe was very good. The relish counterbalanced the bitterness that keeps me away from peppers and made a really flavorful sandwich.

My family and I love this recipe. I make enough of the relish and roasted peppers to have with crackers for snacks the following days.

I think this recipe is delish. I marinate the chicken in lime juice and garlic overnight to give it some more flavor and bake it rather than blanch it. I also make a lighter version of the relish.

The relish was excellent. We really liked the sandwiches, though I did bake the chicken breasts - personal quirk, in general boiled chicken grosses me out. Turned out great, would like to make the spread with a little more sour cream or something to serve as a dip. Yes, I admit, I ate it straight from the fridge too.

NY Philharmonic in the park. Picnic essential. The first person to taste this sandwich insisted on giving a taste to others, all of whom raved. Even my gourmand husband said it was the best sandwich he ever ate. Six copies of the recipe were promised, and not a crumb left. The suggested wine is a little pricey but there are lesser priced Gewürztraminer which complement the sandwich perfectly.

Delicious. Great for picnics in the park! Used already roasted red peppers as a time saver. Also made these with roasted pork. We like the "relish" so much we also made chicken salad with it and served it on a bed of lettuce topped with chopped roasted red pepper. I even caught my husband eating the relish by the fingerful.
