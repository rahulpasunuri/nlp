I'm surprised by the poor reviews for this recipe. My husband and I really liked it -- the grated Parmesan cheese created a lovely coating on each strand of linguine. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

I was not impressed by this recipe. I followed some of the suggestions, and was still not pleased with the turnout. It lacked any zest in the flavor, but showcased the vegetables nicely. I don't think I'll be making this recipe again unfortunately.

Yum! I used whole wheat pasta too, so good. Also, I didn't have crushed red peppers so I used smoked Spanish paprika, wow. Yum!

I used whole wheat pasta and it was fabulous.

A good dish, but even with the fresh peppers and basil, it lacks a "wow" factor. I'd make it again, but probably as a side dish with something else as the star of the meal. Very easy to pull together, though.

Great use of garden abundance! I made this tonight after I trimmed my basil & picked some fresh red bell peppers. The garlic & red pepper give the dish nice heat & if you salt your pasta water generously & use plenty of parm there's no need to salt the sauce. I could see adding eggplant, zucchini or mushrooms if you have them & need to use them up. We had it as a main dish, but it would make a great side for italian or greek sausages.

This is a tasty dish and comes together very quickly. The only problem I had was when I added the parmesan at the end the whole thing turned into a big sticky mess--the cheese caught all of the basil and a lot of the red peppers into big globs that cemented onto the tongs I was using. If I make this again, and I probably will because it tasted good, I'll make as directed, but without mixing in the cheese. That can be served on the side and people can sprinkle on however much they like. I also forgot to add the vinegar, but I don't know how much difference that might have made.
