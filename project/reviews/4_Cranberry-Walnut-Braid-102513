Can this be baked in advance and frozen? Instructions? Thanks!

This is fabulous. To make it a bit healthier, I used 1/2 whole wheat flour instead of all white flour. The only other changes I made were to use orange zest in lieu of the extract (didn't have any on hand) and to shape it into three round boules instead of braiding it. Everyone loved it! The flavor and texture are perfect. I will make this many more times!

I accidentally bought cherries instead of cranberries but still made the bread. It was very good and looked beautiful for Thanksgiving dinner! Will definitely do this one again with the right dried berries!

Unfortunately, this bread turned out raw in the middle. Perhaps if one makes two smaller breads instead of one high bread, it might get cooked through. It may be that extra braid on top that causes the height and thickness, which results in a beautiful, yet uncooked in the middle bread. The outside crust of this bread, which was fully cooked, was a winner though.

This bread is truly exceptional. I made a few slight changes as follows: I used Saco's cultured buttermilk powder (which is basically the same as buttermilk since you reconstitute it) and instead of orange extract (I've never been a fan of the flavor) I added about 1.5 tsp. of vanilla extract. The vanilla added just the right note of richness to the bread. It happened that my dried cranberries were a bit dried out (Thanksgiving leftovers) so I re-hydrated them a bit with a quick blanching. I added a little extra flour as needed given the extra water in the berries and it worked out just fine. I decided to make two boule-shaped loaves so that I could give one away (although I wasn't eager to once I tasted it!). Taking the advice of other reviewers, I baked my boules for exactly 30 minutes. They came out perfectly done and beautifully golden. I plan on making this for next Thanksgiving.

This was probably only the 2nd or 3rd time I had ever made bread from scratch. I accidentally used regular yeast instead of quick-acting yeast. And despite all that, the bread still turned out great. It is so nice to be able to present a fresh bread that also looks beautiful! I can't wait to make it again with the right yeast- I think it will be incredible.

Baking has been my hobby for many years, and I can say that this is the most beautiful bread I've ever made. Not only that, the flavor is wonderful, too. I didn't have orange extract, so I substituted concentrated frozen orange juice for the water and added the finely grated rind from one orange. It was perfect. The second time I made it I put the dry ingredients and eggs in my breadmaker. I heated the buttermilk, butter and orange concentrate to lukewarm and added that. When the dough was finished I pressed it out on a board and added 1/3 of the nuts/fruit and rolled up. repeated twice more. The breadmaker version was fast and easy and turned out just as perfectly as the long method.

This is the first bread I have ever made. I followed this recipe verbatim except cooking time where I had to pull the bread out at 30 minutes because it was much too brown and clearly cooked through. Next time I will tent after 15 minutes and again pull it out at 30 minutes. The orange flavor was a bit too strong for me; next time I'm going to use only 1T of orange extract. Otherwise, the flavor & consistency were both good. Though this recipe demands that you be in-and-out of the kitchen over the course of hours, it is not a huge time commitment of actual work time. I found it easy to start the bread and take on another project while it was rising. P.S. My husband keeps raving about the great flavor.

This is a dense bread with a wonderful taste and beautiful presentation. I will definately make it again.

This bread was one of the best homemade breads I have ever made. I loved the taste and texture of the bread. Great served with poultry or toasted for breakfast. I can't wait to make this again.

This bread is wonderful. It is dense almost like a Challah, but has a great mild sweetness. Easy to make with very little "hands on" time, majority is spent rising. I also added some fresh orange zest to give it some visual appeal. The top of the bread started to get a bit brown too fast, but a simple aluminum foil tent did the trick. Will definately make this recipe again.

This is a great recipe, but you should be prepared to spend a bit of time on it. I didn't have any orange extract, so I reduced some orange juice on the stove and that seemed to make a fine substitution. I would disagree with the reviewer who opted to make the braids into individual loaves, though. The presentation is quite nice when it bakes up, particularly if you're careful to put the smaller one exactly in the middle.

This was fabulously easy and beautiful. I added a bit of fresh chopped rosemary in an effort to re-create a bread that I discovered on vacation and it turned out very well. The crust was crispy and lovely and the inside was soft and chewy. I accidentally cooked it at 375 for the first 20 minutes, turned it down for the next 15, then took it out. One thing I would change: make two medium-sized braids, not the two on top of each other. That way you can either have a thicker piece or feed more people with the recipe.

Looks impressive and quite easy to make. 45min was too long in my oven. Loaf came out dry. I will have to try cutting down the time next time.

Lovely and delicious. Would give this recipe 5 forks if I could! The dough was beautiful and easy to work with (I just needed less water), and the taste is wonderful. It looks beautiful too without too much hassle at all. Baked it for 40 minutes and it was perfect. Next time I might add some allspice or cinnamon to it. Will definately make again!

To a cook in Las Vegas--I have been making this bread at holiday time since it appeared in Bon App. It is part of our traditional family Thanksgiving dinner. I remember the picture when it appeared and have always made the smaller braid about 1/3 the size of the larger one and it goes directly on top of the larger one.

this bread has become a tradition for me at holiday time!!!!everyone loves it, and the flavor is wonderful!!!!the house smells wonderful when it is in the oven!!!a treasure!!!thank you peter!!!!

This was a simple, yummy, and impressive looking recipe. Use leftover bread for french toast or a base for bread pudding. I do have one question however regarding the second smaller braid. This may be obvious, and I am just missing something in the directions, but the photo is not showing up and I was wondering exactly how the smaller braid should be positioned on top. Is it laid across, on a diagonal, or directly on top of the larger braid? This was unclear....thanks!

I have been making this bread every Thanksgiving since it was published in November 1999. For an added touch, substitute 1/2 cup of dried bing cherries for 1/2 of the specified dried cranberries. Make extra as this bread is wonderful toasted for breakfest.

If you like soda breads, you may like this one. It rises magnificently and looks lovely, but it is rather bland and has a weak crumb. An addition of graham flour (replace 1/2 C of the white with 1/2 C of graham) improves this recipe, but be aware that the eggs make this a dense and rich bread without much character.

I made this when a friend gave me a five pound sack of dried cranberries. It is a FABULOUS bread. Like some of the other reviewers, I had to use regular yeast instead of fast-acting but it didn't make much difference. (The recipe calls for a hefty amount of yeast anyway) I also did a simple 3 part braid. The combination of the orange flavor (don't omit!) and the fruit and walnuts is out of this world. Give this one a try!

This bread came out so good!! I used a regular dry yeast instead of quick-rising yeast and let the dough rise longer. I'm gonna make it again for next holiday season.

My husband made this bread, and it was wonderful! We substituted orange juice with orange zest,(instead of orange extract) and the result was excellent. The texture is moist and chewy. The color is a beautiful dark golden brown. This bread is fabulous sliced thin and served with orange flavored creamcheese.

This has become another Thanksgiving tradition in our house. The bread looks as wonderful as it tastes.

This is a beautiful and delicious bread to make. I was a little leary about trying to make a braided bread, as I don't have a lot of experience with them, but it was easy to make and came out wonderfully. It even froze well!

I love this recipe! Easy for a yeast bread, it seems to always come out right, and is always gobbled up quickly. If there are leftovers, they make great cinnamon toast too!

I made this bread over the weekend, and it was a delicious delight. The orange extract imparts a lovely fragrance, and the texture was moist and chewy. The color was a beautiful dark golden brown. I used sweetened dried cranberries. This bread is fabulous the next day toasted with butter.

This bread was beautiful and had wonderful flavor and texture! I used brown sugar instead of white, and substituted golden and regular raisins for dried cranberries.

A very easy bread, even for a novice bread maker. The orange extract adds a lovely flavor, and using bread flour vs. all purpose makes the dough easier to handle. This will be on my table for Thanksgiving, and at the school holiday bake sale!

This is a beautiful (& tasty!) bread that my husband and I gave to neighbors at Christmas time last year. I plan to make it again during the holidays later this year. Hint: be sure to tuck the ends under real good so that they stay put during baking. This was my first time making bread and it turned out great! Easy, too!

This bread was delicious and beautiful. My guests wanted to take some of this bread home rather than a piece of the leftover dessert! Most people were surprised to learn that the dried fruit was cranberries. Good texture, flavor and appearance--and easy to make.

This is truly a beautiful and delicious bread. The recipe is well-written and easy to follow. I consider myself to be a good baker, but haven't had much experience with yeast bread. This one turned out so beautifully that I felt like a pro. Everyone at my table loved it.

I made this last Thanksgiving with family out in New England (they had made it before) and it was my first attempt at participating in something like this (normally I am more of a "cook" than a "baker"). IT WAS EASY AND DELICIOUS!! Very simple to put together and it turned out perfectly! All of you hesitant bakers must try! KIMBER

I'm somewhat of a beginner, and this turned out beautifully! My whole family was impressed. I even surprised myself. I plan on taking a loaf to my in-laws this Thanksgiving so they can be amazed, too!

I made this bread many times last fall and everyone who ate it loved it. It is rich and not too sweet, I left out the orange extract the first time because I couldn't find it and have never used it because the bread was great without it. A great addition to any holiday meal.

Everyone who had this loved it! I made one for work and one for Easter dinner at mom's. It turns out beautifully....a really pretty loaf. Addictive, too.

Wonderful heavy winter braid that is excellent toasted. I have used dried cherries or blueberries in lieu of cranberries and I liked them better.

What a beautiful bread - my parents even took a picture of it. A bit sweet and fairly heavy - a terrific special-occasion recipe.
