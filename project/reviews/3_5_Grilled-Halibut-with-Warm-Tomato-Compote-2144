SOO DELISH! My guest loved it.It was incredibly easy as well. I substituted basil for the tarragon and was very pleased with the result. I'll definitely be making this again. Pairs well with the parmesan risotto I made as a side.

Surprisingly tasty. I didn't have shallots so I used a little red onion. The tomatoes, of course, need to be of good quality for best results.

This was quite good. As recommended, I added some capers at the end. I also increased the amount of wine, which provided a bit more flavor. Works well with mahi-mahi as well.

Made this for the first time today. Simple, simple, simple to make and wonderful flavor combination. I used chicken broth instead of wine (was out of wine....go figure!). Wine will probably add another layer of flavor - can't wait to try it! Loved the tarragon-tomato combination. Highly recommend this one!

Good, but not drop-dead-on-the-floor delicious... I recommend you try it for yourself.

Really yummy. The only thing I would do would be to add additional seasoning to the tomatoes. I also baked the fish in the oven (400 for 20 minutes) instead of grilling.

I made this with tilapia (pan seared 2 min each side in butter) with capers and balsalmic in the sauce, as several folks had recommended. Also used thyme (by mistake), which was fine. Served over a bed of wilted spinach with garlic. Delicious, and super fast!

Fantastic! Love the combo of the shallots and tarragon. The flavors are bold yet in perfect harmony with the delicate flavor of the halibut. Since I don't have a grill, I've baked the halibut every time and it turns out great. I've added a little ck stock to richen the sauce and it tastes perfect. Mama loves it.

I've made this twice. The first time with tarragon and capers. The 2nd time I used fresh basil and fresh salted butter and we much preferred it this way. I will make this again and again. Just as good with Mahi Mahi

I am a reasonably experienced cook but a novice when it comes to seafood, and this dish was easy to prepare and very tasty! The tomato compote was great - I added some capers (as previously suggested), otherwise stuck to the recipe and it was awesome. I will definitely make the compote again for other dishes. I served this with fresh peas mixed with baby spinach and shallots (recipe on epicurious), and the flavors melded wonderfully.

I substituted grape tomato, basil (instead of tarragon), and added a few garlic cloves. It was really good.

I really enjoyed it with a couple of tablespoons of capers added to the sauce. It was delicious!

Very simple and delicious! Am anxious to prepare this for company. Went terrific with the suggested grilled zucchini spears (I marinated in peanut oil), as well as a strawberry-spinach salad.

This recipe is so easy and delicious. My whole family loved it and I think it would be great with other fishes as well. THe compote is so tasty, I even think it could stand on it's own with pasta as a light meal.

Was easy, tasted great, and looks impressive. I used swordfish instead of halibut and it was good too.

I prepare this ~ once a month and always get hugs from my spouse who likes simply, healthful meals. I love that it's so easy.

We pan-seared instead of grilled and doubled the compote. Excellent, complex flavors. Belly is happy.

I used wild caught Halibut a friend supplied and received rave reviews. I used whole grape tomatoes in place of the plum tomatoes and brushed the fish with olive oil instead of butter. The sauce was so easy and carefree to make. I let it simmer while I prepared everything else and it cooked down to a nice consistency. Our friends liked the sauce so much that they took home the remaining sauce. This is a keeper.

This is a total keeper. Made it according to the recipe and it was perfect. Love the fact that you can make it at the last minute. This is a great dinner party entree if you want rave reviews.

This is a great, simple dish that takes no time at all. I boiled cubed red potatoes and threw some left-over chopped tarragon into the water. What a nice compliment to a colorful and impressive dish. Guests loved it!

Very good. The tomato compote made the dish!

This was truly the perfect summer dinner, especially for my tomato-loving husband. I did not have fresh tarragon on hand either, but some fresh flat-leaf parsley gave it tons of flavor instead. I think any fresh herb would work, as long as it is fish-friendly -- cilantro? basil? sage? Anyway, it was delicious, IF you can find fresh halibut at your local market (not always readily available). I tried to make it again a week later and couldn't find it! This recipe is really good and hard to mess up, so please try it and be brave and improvise.

Made this tonite with quartered cherry tomatoes and fresh basil (I don't like tarragon and I had all the other ingredients on hand) and we were really impressed. Grilled some asparagus along with the halibut and served it with some brown rice and mushroom pilaf, and it was a really great, simple mid-week dinner. I used more than a cup of quartered tomatoes and a whole shallot, but next time I'll make even more of the compote.

This dish is perfect for summer - fresh, light and easy to make. Husband loved it - I will definitely make again.

This was our first time cooking fish at home and we were pleasantly surprised! We made this recipe last weekend, but grilled seabass on a gril pan. We served it with baked red potatoes and carrots. It was outstanding,and we'll cook it again soon.

This is one of my favorite seafood recipes on this site (that I've found so far!). I've made it several times when looking for an easy and quick weekday receipe. As an American in Ireland, its also the recipe I choose when attempting to convert Irish non-fish eaters (who have often grown up on horrible concoctions like boiled cod). The ingredients are simple, but the tomato compote is very flavorful and makes for a unique and fresh-tasting meal.

What a wonderful dish. I added a splash of balsamic vinegar to the dish. When you use "fresh" tarragon and ripe tomoatoes, it is really a beautiful dish. Nice vibrant red color. Yum!

The tomato compote is what makes this dish for sure - I didn't have white wine so I used vermouth instead - worked great! Nice, light and simple.

Made this tonight with grilled veggies and wild/brown rice mix. My tomatoes were flavorful, but not very red, so the compote looked more orange. I added a couple tsp. of balsamic vinegar near the end, and about 2 tsp. chopped parsley just before spooning over the very fresh halibut fillets. Don't let the simplicity of the recipe fool you--this is a light, helathy, flavorful summer entree.

Very easy and a nice way to serve fish on a week night. We made it with grilled Ono. Also, since my boyfriend is not fond of tarragon, I used chervil instead. Also used chopped grape tomatoes since the plum looked very sad. I think this would be fantastic with basil as the herb, and a little parmesan sprinkled on top at the end.

This was quick and delicious. I wasn't expecting too much because of the simpleness of the ingredients. I used fresh tomatoes and cooked longer because they were quite firm. I added more wine because the sauce kept reducing due to the length of cooking. Served with mashed potatoes underneath the halibut and the sauce over all, garnished with parsley and steamed green beans on side. Awesome!

This was delicious and very easy to make. Very low fat and healthy too. I made it the noodles too which was perfect. I would probably use less fresh tarragon next time.

This was delicious. I didn't have plum tomatoes on hand but had some tomatoes from my friend's garden. They were juicier so had to let them reduce 10 minutes instead of 2 but it turned out wonderful. I loved this with the fresh taragon. Also, I doubled the tomato recipe part because we used the compote on the egg noodles too. It would be a great pasta sauce. I used a small indoor grille with a cover so the halibut didn't have a grilled flavor but was tender and moist.

Very tasty for low effort. Good for when you're in a hurry.
