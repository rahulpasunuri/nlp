I've worked w/puff pastry before and never had this problem - I couldn't cut it with either a knife or a fork once it was all put together! The pastry was hard, but not a nice, crispy hard. It was tough hard. The filling was nice and would have been nice in a sweet pastry tart shell, but I was just too disappointed in the puff pastry. Can't figure out what I did wrong.

I first made this easy recipe when it was published in 1990. I made it again today to fill a special request at a farewell party. It is so easy, so impressive looking and tastes great. In addition to the published recipe, I melt a little red jelly (currant, strawberry, etc.) and brush the tops of the berries for that extra shine. People think you have slaved over this. I love being a Cliff Notes version of a great cook!
