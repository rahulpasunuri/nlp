Made this as instructed, except used regular sliced chicken instead of smoked and melted mozz on top of the chicken. I thought the pesto was lovely, the arugula was a nice touch and all of the flavors blended really nicely. The cheese was a nice addition. Nice, easy sandwich.

very good, a little dry. i was in a time crunch before taking this sandwich on a picnic. i added 4 slices of mozzarella cheese and used wheat french bread from the bakery, i also used pre-made pesto. I used a pre- made oven roasted chicken and pulled it apart. it was a huge sandwich! i preheated the oven to about 275, made the sandwich and threw it in there until the bread was a little toasted and the cheese was melted. VERY tasty. the sun-dried tomatos were amazing but next time i think i'll use a combination of sun-dried and regular tomatos just to make it a little less dry. plenty for left overs and i was told i was an amazing cook..can't get better than that :)

This recipe is easy and delicious. To save time, I used store-bought pesto and added in chopped olives. I also used sliced grilled chicken breast. I made it for a crowd of 20 and it was a hit. For vegetarians, I substituted fresh mozzarella for chicken breast.

Fabulous! I made this to go with my husband's favorite soup, tomato garlic, from the Moosewood Restaurant's Daily Speical cookbook, delicious combo! I used spinach, crusty whole wheat bread and rotisserie chicken, sans sundried tomatoes and it was excellent. This is a keeper for sure!

Exceptional sandwich! I used frensh bread and did not have arugula so used spinach. Also melted fresh provalone cheese on top. The sun dried tomatoes add delicious depth to this dish.

The deli didn't have smoked chicken so I used smoked turkey instead. I also tend to use walnuts rather than pine nuts in my basil. I made a bunch for a ski trip lunch and everyone raved, asking for the recipe. It is a nice gourmet touch to the simple sandwich. I will be making it again.

I have made this several times for boat trips and picnics. I always use rotisserie chicken and substitute roated peppers for the sundried-tomato. This is really terrific and simple!

Just had this for dinner, yum. Used a dark brown bread baguette which some may think overpowers the flavors of the sandwich, but I thought it added to the rustic-ness of it. As another reviewer suggested, I used store-bought (fresh) pesto, and added black olives and a couple Tbs EV Olive Oil. The pesto was good on the bread in itself. Didn't have a food processor (not my kitchen), but used a stick blender to process the olives & mix with the premade pesto with good results. Sliced the tomatoes as it seemed to me like they would be too chewy to bite through easily. Took it to the table for everyone to prepare to their taste, as the barbarians were at the gate and getting cranky. Fast, easy, and good; will definitely make it on future sandwich nights.

I needed a fast, inexpensive, and easy recipe for a picnic. This one worked out beautifully. I just baked some chicken breasts (20 min at 400 degrees) and used store-bought pesto with the olives blended in. Everyone loved it, and many people ate the bread with just the pesto and tomatoes, making me think that it would work well as a appetizer, too.

For the sake of convenience, I purchased a roasted chicken from the grocery store and used that, shredded, instead of sliced, smoked chicken. Unfortunately, the same grocery store didn't have arugula that day, so I ended up using romaine, which was okay, but I'm sure the sandwich is much better with arugula. The only change I made to the pesto was that I toasted the pine nuts, but I'm sure adding or substituting walnuts, as another cook suggested, would be a nice improvement. I served this to friends at a picnic at a local winery, and everyone enjoyed it very much.

This sandwich was a big hit for our Jazz in the Park picnic. I made a few changes such as grilled chicken instead of smoked, pita bread instead of italian (which was great, the bread really absorbed the pesto flavor). I also processed in walnuts to the pesto mixture (a definate must in my book). We all agreed that the pesto was so awesome we will use it as a dip in the future.

I came across this recipe when searching for something a little different to take on a picnic. It was a big hit, and was good with melon balls and deviled eggs, with brownies for dessert. I used the tomatos packed in oil because that's what I had on hand, and even drizzled a little oil on the chicken for more flavor. Yum.

Next time I will try a whole boneless grilled chicken breast instead of it being sliced thin. I'll also try a crisper textured french bread. This might work as an appetizer: layer sliced chicken breast strips, sun-dried tomato, pesto on an oven toasted slice of french bread.

Perfect for Tailgait parties. Bring copies of the recipe, you will be asked.
