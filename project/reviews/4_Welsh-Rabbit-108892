Very easy and quite tasty. Next time I'll use only half the mustard - I found it a little too sharp. Thank you to the reviewer who suggested adding Worcestershire - that was a great touch.

When preparing this recipe, I doubled the flour and halved the dry mustard. Also whisked hot sauce into the egg yolk and then added to simmering sauce for about 30 seconds. With these changes, this Welsh rabbit deserved 4 forks and was the most authentic I have ever served.

this is a good recipe, I used a little more cheese and simmered it a bit longer to really thicken it up. Thats my advice. but overall delicious

This pretty much was beer cheese soup on top of bread. I think a true rarebit has a thicker cheese sauce that is put on the bread before going into the broiler. Next time, I'm going to look for a more traditional recipe.

Tasty! And a good way to sneak an egg in on my vegetarian husband.

The name 'Welsh rabbit' is not "silly". It is humorous and historical. At the time it was coined, there were no rabbits to hunt, raise or eat in Wales!

Very,very tasty! I served it over toasted English muffin halves topped with sauteed 1/4" thick ham and tomato slices. Great meal!

Delicious cheese sauce! The ale adds a really nice flavour. I'm thinking of using this sauce for oven-baked leeks or Belgian endive.

A little dash of worchestershire sauce and a drop or two of tabasco add depth to this dish which is delicious served over toast topped with pineapple slices.

I used this recipe to make Rabbit Eggs (a fun idea for Easter morning) Place about 3 tablespoons of the rarebit on a half of toasted English muffin. Place a poached egg on top then cover with remaining rarebit. An optional thin slice of tomato and a couple of slices of bacon under the egg adds a nice touch.

This is very similar to my own recipe and its a great one. I never tried using milk (at first I shuddered at the idea of combining beer and milk) but it adds a creamniness that my personal recipe lacked. A keeper.

I grew up eating Welsh Rabbit (we called it "Rarebit") and this recipe is even better than my mums. I like it with crumbled, cooked bacon on top and in the summer, a slice of fresh tomato.

To the reviewer from London, UK on 2/16-yes, it's powdered mustard amd it is available with the dried herbs and spices in your market.

Dear London - Dried mustard powder is generally found in the spice aisle. In the US, a commonly found brand is Coleman's. Ours comes in a (go figure) mustard-yellow tin box. Cheers!

Can anyone tell me what dry mustard is? Is it like a mustard powder that you get in the spice/herb section?

My grandmother made this very dish often for me when i was a child. I thought the recipe died with her but here it is! A wonderful dish for a cold winter night!

This is excellent and needs no improvement. If you like this, try a recipe called Rinktum Ditty, a Welsh rendition of the same type. Also, make sure you use grated sharp Cheddar cheese, not the stuff in bags - it makes a difference.

When the recipe calls for aged cheddar, use it for gosh sakes! Convinience food (packaged, shredded cheese) is not allowed in my house with all of those anti-caking agents and junk that you feed your kids. Slow down, grate your own cheese (it doesn't take too long with the proper tools!), and make this dish because it is easy and filled with calcium.

I just saw this recipe a few moments ago,but it sounds great. I'm sure my wife,and I know my grandaughter,will want me to make it soon. Can't wait to try it ! Thanks, Tom S.

Made a half-recipe of this to go with some parsnip soup for a light dinner. Used pre-shredded sharp cheddar instead of grating our own extra-sharp, and it was still very good. Next time I might try sprinkling a little more cheese over the sauce-covered toasts and sticking them back under the broiler for a minute. Tasty!
