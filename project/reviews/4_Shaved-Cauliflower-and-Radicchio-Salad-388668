Made this exactly as written and thought it was great! Love having another way to use cauliflower and another kind of salad, as we're trying to eat low carb as well as less meat.

My whole family loves this salad. It's a great way to get more cruciferous veggies and radicchio is a nutritional powerhouse as well. Fresh chives aren't regularly available in my market, so I tossed dried chives in with the vinaigrette while chopping and assembling the other ingredients.

Love finding different salads to make. This one even tasted good leftover. I used a shallot instead of chives which weren't available to me.

I love the shaved cauliflower slices. It is a unique looking salad. The chives and walnuts make this salad. I find that all raw salads require a good seasoning with salt and pepper after dressing the salad. I used a mandolin but still thought this was a pretty time consuming recipe. Still, I love trying new salad combos and this was worth making!

Considering the other reviews, I was expecting something much better. This was just ok, nothing special.

If you like cauliflour then you will love this salad. The flavors and textures are so good you would expect to get this salad in an upscale restaurant. I toasted my walnuts and I used Belgian Endive instead of the pear. I also did not have walnut oil, so I used a light olive oil. I used a little extra lemon and it was perfect. Leftover salad was good next day for lunch. I will make again soon for a dinner party.

This is an inventive salad, showcasing yet another way to use cauliflower. The combination of ingredients had me skeptical at first, but I love parsley so that is what made me want to make this. The whole parsley leaves in this were delicious. The dressing complemented the ingredients just right (I had to substitute olive oil for walnut oil due to allergies). I think walnut pieces would have been a nice touch if I could use them.

This was fantastic! I made it like called for, except that I did not have walnut oil, so substituted extra virgin olive oil (little less than the 1/4 c). My husband who doesn't like veggies, raved about it. The combination is amazing, very fresh and colorful. "This is not just good for cauliflower, this is great for anything!" Definately would do for company or a holiday, but easy enough for tonight's Tuesday dinner.
