I thought the cake portion was excellent - it was incredibly rich and tender. The frosting I thought was a little on the sweet side, though I didn't use the orange-flower water as recommended, which may have cut the sugary taste. Overall, I would definitely try this recipe again, just maybe with my own frosting. Gorgeous presentation.

I found this recipe poorly written, the batter was thick like bread dough and had to be thinned with water and more milk to mix with the egg whites. Also, the buttercream was grainy with only 4 c powdered sugar. added 1 stick of butter and extra rosewater to correct this. I would not make this recipe again.

Rating Frosting only- Super delicious! Very easy to spread and can even be put into a frosting/decorator bag (after being the fridge a bit) and used to pipe or decorate cakes and cupcakes.

I made the cake part of this recipe with a true buttercream frosting. The cake turned out too dense and sweet. Something lighter would have made this cake edible. In theory this is a great idea.

This is a beautiful cake. I made it a day before frosting and it kept well. In order to ensure the cake is moist, I would prick the cake with a tester all over and then pour the simple syrup on top. My cake was a little dry and I think this would have helped.

This cake was time consuming but delicious! I couldn't find Orange Flower water so I used plain old orange extract instead and it tasted great. The icing was really good considering I have never been a fan of cream cheese. Next time I make it I will use a butter cream or royal icing instad. I had no trouble with the cake falling apart or the icing being runny or clumpy or anything like that. The cake was nice and dense yet moist! It was great!

I have made this recipe a number of times and I wanted to share my "cheater's" version which is great for a large party. Apologies to all the serious foodies out there, of which I usually count myself. Instead of making the scratch cake, I buy two white cake mixes. Instead of using three egg whites, I use one whole egg and two whites and add 1 teaspoon of orange extract and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Then I pour each of the batters (made separately) into two 12 inch layer pans. I then make the icing as directed although I usually skip the step with the orange marmalade. Then I add blackberries to all the berries and use more than double that the recipe suggests for the larger cake. It must be kept refrigerated until an hour before serving or it becomes too soft and falls apart, especially this larger version. I brought it to a Memorial Day party of about 30 people and it was a big hit!!

This has become the new birthday cake of choice for my family and my office. The flavors are so amazing and complex and complimentary all at the same time. My family, friends, and I LOVE this cake!

The cake was nice, but it isn't a buttercream, it's a cream cheese frosting. Used the meringue buttercream recipe instead, so can only rate the cake. The cook from Charleston: use a fine tip squeeze bottle to put the syrup on next time. Much easier and much less clean up. Plus you can store the rest of the syrup for another time.

This was delicious but not worth all the time and effort. I used Grand Marnier when I could not find orange flower water anywhere and it worked just fine. There was too much syrup and it was very tedious brushing it onto the cake. Finally I just gave up and poured out about 1/4 of the syrup. I left my cream cheese and butter out too long and it was not cold enough so the icing was very runny and didn't look pretty at all. However, my office loved it and claimed it to be wonderful.

This is the first cake I have ever made. It is time consuming, but honestly worth it. I made it for an office party and most people couldn't believe it was may first cake and i made it from scratch. I have made it three times now and everytime it is just as good. Would definately recommend this cake!

I made this for my Grandmother's 90th birthday. It was great! I used lemon curd instead of the orange marmalade. Piped it around the middle layer then filled it with raspberry jam. Chill the cake and the buttercream. It will spread so much cleaner

I initially made the cake for my family and they loved it. I thought that there was too much cake for the amount of frosting so I cut the 2 layers and half to make 4 layers, and spread a thin layer of buttercream frosting on the addt'l layers. Yum!

I actually only used the cream cheese buttercream frosting from this recipe, on another type of cake and topped it with fresh strawberry slices and blueberries. The fruit and frosting combo was delicious! I did leave the orange-flower water out of the recipe. It's a nice sweet, yet tangy frosting. My only gripe is that it gets melt-y at room temperature, and somewhat harder to work with unless it is just out of the fridge. I frosted my cake, and had to put the cake and extra frosting in the fridge for about 30 minutes, then I added more frosting to the cake, and it looked smoother and was easier to spread once it had firmed up a bit. I liked the taste better than traditional buttercream with shortening.

I finally made this cake for Mother's Day and it met my every expectation. It was like going to the fanciest wedding and finally getting that delicious slice of gourmet cake without having to buy someone a present! But this was BETTER than ANY wedding cake I have ever tasted. Easy to assemble, looked beautiful, but the taste was the best. I can't say enough. Was a huge hit for my gathering, and normal dieters did not hesitate to take giant pieces of this cake. When people are willing to REALLY ruin their diet for this, it says a lot about its taste!

This cake is truly wonderful. It is light and refreshing. The icing is deliciously sinful. It is also veru simple and straightforward to make. I never use the orange flower water and its delicious every time!

I made this cake for my husband's birthday last summer. The orange-flower water (which I got at Dean and Deluca's,) is subtle, but it gave the cake an interesting flavor. It was popular with the whole family. I used 9 in. pans, and I can't remember if I filled them full or reserved some batter out. I do remember the bottom layer broke apart as I was attempting to pull the strips of parchment paper out from underneath after frosting. That has nothing to do with the recipe, but now I know to be more careful!

I made this cake for a birthday at work and it got rave reviews! The cake itself was a lovely consistency, very light with a lovely flavour. I figured if anything the cake would be dense from reading previous reviews and especially since I made 1 1/2 batches; I was pleasantly surprised. I when I was making the syrup and the icing I couldn't find orange flower water either so I just used orange extract which worked wonderfully.

Rating: 4
I loved this cake, and so did everyone else at the party I brought it to. I had to go to 4 stores to find the orange flower water (found it at Sunflower Market), but it was worth it. The subtle flavor really makes the cake. I did not find it too dense or difficult to ice, and I often have trouble with both these issues. Unlike may labor-intensive recipes, this one is totally worth it. I making it for another party next week!

Transformed this recipe into a wedding cake for 150 people but did not change it in any way. It was a show stopper and everyone loved it. It was a dense cake but was great for me as a new baker. I used the Buttercream icing in a basket weave. The cake was dense but not dry.

I had orange flower water-got it at Beverages and More.Didn't have 10 inch cake pans.To me,the orange marmalade added a bitter taste.The icing was too sweet.The cake was too dense.The whole thing kind of melted apart on the indoor buffet table.My dog just finished eating the leftover cake.Some people liked it,but not me, maybe because I was the one who spent all day making it.A lemon blueberry cake from a few summers ago was far superior.

This cake is beautiful and great for summer- perfect for a summer dinner party. We made it "more elegant" by decorating the plate with homemade blueberry and raspberry sauces. It was a hit.

I made this cake for a family affair and everyone just loved it! I assumed I would not be able to find orange flower, so I used orange juice concentrate instead. I think this cake is totally worth the effort: its presentation is lovely and displays an array of flavor. I would definitely make it again and again!

I thought this was fantastic! I'll be offering it to clients from now on. If your cake texture was heavy - you might be over-folding your egg whites - just fold until no white streaks remain - use a light touch! Also use whole milk - not skim and make sure your sugar is dissolved in your butter - use super-fine if you have to. I don't see how this cake could be dry if you used the syrup - mine was very moist. (If you used a mix - you missed the whole point of this cake.) As for the frosting - a very soft cream cheese frosting usually means you've over mixed it - have butter and cream cheese very soft and DO NOT overmix once you add the cream cheese.

I'm a dork. I just looked at the recipe on the site and noticed the real amount of berries needed. My print out of the recipe mushed the numbers together. That sounds a lot better. I thought that was a little much. Anyone have recipes for berry-stuff?

I made this cake for the 4th and was a little wary after reading all the reviews. But it turned out really well. I only slightly modified the recipe. I took the cakes out a few (4) minuted early and used a lot less berries. 112oz of strawberries seemed like a whole lot to me. I bought 64oz instead and a little extra of the other two and only ended up using half of those. The cake was a little dense, but it was definitely supposed to be like angel food, I just over-folded the egg white mixture into the batter. This one is definitely for those with a sweet-tooth. The buttercream frosting was amazing. It also looked like the picture. I'm not the greatest icer (this was my first attempt at a cake from scratch) but chilling the buttercream first REALLY helped. All-in-all, a lot of work, but worth it.

I didn't include the orange syrup. It was a wonderful moist white cake. Fabulous!

Cake was fantastic! It does take some time to make it, but if you need a show stopper this is it. Need to let the flower water mix really soak it before you frost it or you may have trouble w/ the frosting not staying on as well. I could not find the flower water, so did the sugar water and then sprinkled on orange liquour instead.

My family agreed that this cake would be great without the berries. I get oranfe blosson and rose petal water at my grocery store but you could try a food specialty store.

This cake was just okay. For all the work there are much better recipes that are softer and tastier. Don't waste your time.

I agree with other reviewers that the cake is labor intensive. I reduced the syrup a little too much and it became a little too thick. As a result it didn't soak into the cake as much as I would have liked. The cake was a little dense, but I can't be sure if that was a result of my very thick syrup. Regardless, I brought to a large Father's Day celebration and it was the show stopper. The orange water provides a subtle hint of something, it shouldn't be an overwhelming taste. I had so much fun listening to people try to figure out what the secret ingredient was. I was hoping for leftovers for breakfast, but every last morsel was gone.

Some people mentioned that they did not care for the texture of the cake. I am sure someone called it dense - maybe they made it wrong. As I said, I just really didn't have time for all of the components so I used a mix and it was still very good.

Rating: 4
I made this as cupcakes, and they were phenomenal. I served the berries alongside. The frosting was great, I had no trouble at all. As for the person who used a box mix, it's the incredibly fluffy texture of the cake that makes this so good. You're missing more than half the reason to make this.

I will admit that I cheated and used a white cake mix. I just did not have time for making the cake from scratch and the syrup and the icing so I went with the mix. Also - with no orange flower water easily available I used a bit of pure orange extract in the syrup and the icing. I thought it turned out great. My icing was delicious. I chilled it a bit before icing the cake with it and that was all it needed to reach a spreadable consistency. I'm not sure why others would have so much trouble with the icing. It is a cream cheese icing so it would need to be chilled regardless of the initial consistency.

Defintely not worth the time and effort. The icing was a disaster, although it did firm up a bit in the frig. I am a professional baker and wouldn't touch this recipe again.

I certainly wish epicurious had put this recipe on site in the first June batch...if they had I probably would have tried another recipe for my friends' birthday party! I had to run all around town for the special -expensive!- cake pans, plus this recipe is labor-intensive. The cake is gorgeous, that's its main appeal, but I agree with many of the other reviewers that it's quite dry and bland tasting. The best thing about the recipe (aside from the cake's appearance) is the buttercream icing which, though sweet, is quite nice.

This cake was good, but I am not sure it is worth the effort. I agree with the previous reviewers that the impressive look of this cake is its biggest asset. My family and I thought it tasted good, especially the icing, but we all agreed that the cake was a little stiff. I thought I had mixed it too much after the egg whites addition, but apparently I was not the only one with this problem. Maybe it's just how it is supposed to be.

I made this cake for Father's Day and, for the most part, I really liked it. I agree that the buttercream frosting was less thick than traditional buttercream, but that actually made it easier to work with and it did firm up after refrigeration. I also thought the cake was just a little dry -- maybe this was by design, to make it resemble a strawberry shortcake in texture? I would be interested in hearing any suggestions other reviewers may have for making the cake just a tad more moist.

All looks, no flavor. The cake was dry, the syrup when reduced to proper amount was still too thin, the cream cheese overpowered the orange flavors, and the icing was too soft until refrigerated. Not at all like other wonderful recipes I use from this magazine.

I thought this cake was great! I use high altitude adjustments and made in 9" pans (had left over batter). The cake reminded me of a angel food cake. I couldn't find the orange water so I used a orange liquor. I wish they would list substitute ings to use when they have had to find ings.

The cake is beautiful, but mostly because of the berries. I didn't think the cake itself tasted wonderful enough to justify the prep time. The icing was way too soft when made as directed, although it did firm up in the fridge before serving. I think I might just make the icing and decorate a pound cake or some easier-to-make white cake and add the berries for the same look with less of a time commitment.
