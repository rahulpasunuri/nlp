I've used this recipe for years. It's consistently flaky and delicious. To keep the butter cold for as long as possible, I often grate it in a food processor and then toss with the flour.

This is a marvelous recipe. I made fruit turnovers with it and the buttery pastry as divine. Only note is that the frozen butter begins melting in my fingers before it all gets grated so I recommend planning on using an additional half stick of frozen butter and taking the soft butter to the fridge for other uses.

Wow - I'm in love. What a terrific method of making tart/pie crust! Grating the frozen butter into the downy cake flour is inspired. The pastry dough is incredibly easy to work with, it's very pliable, and it delivers a flaky and tasty crust. Bravo!

I always keep my butter frozen in case I get the urge to bake...but I've always ahd to defrost it beforehand. Finally a recipe with frozen butter! I will definitely make this again! :o9

This is truly the perfect all-purpose pie and tart crust. Easy to make, easy to work with and just sweet and buttery enough. Excellent!

I've made this pastry crust three times - and each time for a different type of tart. It has been flawless every time! So perfect!

I have made this recipe three times and each time it produces a spectacular pastry or pie crust. The method of freezing and grating the butter is a real time saver over the old method of cutting off small pieces of butter while it continues to warm up.
