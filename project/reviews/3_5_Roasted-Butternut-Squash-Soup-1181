I do agree with other reviewers that this is a good base for butternut squash soup. I roasted two heads of garlic and two sweet onions along with the squash, (two whole ones halved). Cut the top off the heads of garlic and wrap in foil. Just squeeze the garlic into the soup before you puree it all. I also season with white pepper. Yummy

Basic recipe that needs spices or garnish for flavor sake. I peeled and cubed the Butternut Squash 5# and added cubed 3 carrots, tossed with EVOO, roasted in the oven at 400 for 25 min. Sauteed 1 large diced onion in EVOO and then pureed in batches with 49 oz can Swanson chicken broth. Added salt and pepper, then garnished with cranberry sauce and fresh thyme for Thanksgiving dinner. Very creamy despite no dairy. Nice because you can take it in many directions with nutmeg or cinnamon, or curry powder etc. Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/reviews/Roasted-Butternut-Squash-Soup-1181#ixzz1ej1jSYJH

Great basic recipe. I added a sprinkle of brown sugar to enhance the sweetness of the squash and some curry for kick. The final product was delicious!

I agree with the other reviewers that this is a good jumping off point. I used the 2 cups of veggie broth and 1 cup of milk, but added 4 carrots and a bit of onion, garlic, thyme, crushed red pepper, and simmered my broth with 2 bay leaves, 2 cinnamon sticks, and some ginger root while the squash and carrots roasted. I think 4 carrots is the limit if you want to maintain the butternut squash flavor.

I didnt like the taste that the broth gave this soup. It was very bland, I added some celery salt to spice it up a bit. It still felt like it was lacking a little.

Boring! Add some other veggies. Maybe carrots.

Such a basic recipe, it needed to altered for flavor sake. I peeled and cubed the Butternut Squash and added one large cubed Onion, roughly chopped 3 stalks of Celery and 3 Carrots. Seasoned the medley with sea salt and fresh ground pepper and 1 teaspoon of Dried Thyme. Tossed in a large bowl with 2 tablespoons of Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Then roasted in the oven at 350 for 40-45 min. (mixing the roasted veggies half way through the roasting). Finished the soup as listed. Serve with a dollop of Sour Cream topped with diced Scallions and Roasted Pepitas and some Fresh Ground Nutmeg.

A delicous soup - I followed the recipe up until serving time. Then I added as I served it, sauteed mushrooms and shallots and croutons (homemade with garlic and olive oil.) It was great. I've just gotten an immersion blender and that made a big difference - the soup was super smooth.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe for people who are willing to experiment. It's a good base for a creamy soup but if you don't spice it up, it will be too bland. I followed some of the review suggestions and mine turned out pretty awesome. I added two stalks of celery, a honey crisp apple, a scallion, two tablespoons of garlic, and lots of spices -curry powder, cumin, ginger, chili powder, cheyenne pepper, sea salt, and fresh ground pepper-didn't measure any of them, so I can't tell you how much, probably about a teaspoon of each. Also, I used half a cup of half and half and half a cup of soy milk because I didn't have nonfat milk. It was like butternut squash soup with a kick, which I like. I will definitely use the recipe over and over. Try it out. It's worth experimenting!!

This is a GREAT basic recipe that allows for whatever creativity strikes you each time you feel like Roasted Butternut Squash Soup. Today I sauteed one onion with ground garlic (it's snowing and I am out of cloves and not venturing out), added 1/2 t ginger, salt, pepper and whole milk instead of nonfat,,,and Voila! I'm lucky I got to have any. My 19 yr old was licking the plate.

This soup was so good I could barely stand it! But, this is based on the modified recipe I used, as I'm sure without a little "doctoring" this would be a rather dull soup. Thank you to all of the people who made suggestions in their comments. Having only a buttercup squash handy, I roasted that instead, along with two cloves of garlic. I also added 1/2 of a sauteed onion, and a generous 1/2 teaspoon of ginger. Today, I just made it for my lunch, but I will definitely be making this for the next dinner party I throw.

Great basic recipe, and you can add all sorts of other spices/ingredients depending on your mood. I sauteed chopped baby carrots, one chopped celery stalk, one medium onion and a little garlic and then combined with the squash in the blender. Also added a handful of candied pecans to blender, along with nutmeg, ginger, spicy paprika and a little cayenne pepper. Topped with dollop creme fraiche, a little toasted sesame oil and chopped candied pecans.

I'm very glad I read the reviews first... I would have been really disappointed if it were bland... I also added some fresh thyme to roast with the squash and the leaves from a few sprigs with the onions (we really like thyme, though...) it was GREAT!

Loved this recipe with these changes suggested by other reviewers. Peeled squash before roasting for more flavor. Roasted three leeks, 3 whole garlic cloves along with squash. Sauteed one chopped granny smith apple and one chopped onion in a little butter, put in blender along with squash. Topped each bowl with a bit of sour cream and some roasted, salted pepitas from Trader Joe's. Absolutely delicious.

It's true that this recipe is very basic, but it's also very healthy, which I believe to be a good thing. I did it when I was hosting a party and I added roasted garlic, cream, black pepper and white wine. It was delicious and more restaurant like. But I also did it for myself for my lunches and I only added roasted garlic and oignons and it was also very good and satisfying. It taste more like something you can have everyday.

Very easy and good. I added a finely chopped onion, and sauteed it with a little butter in the saucepan before adding the squash. Delicious!

This earned only 2 spoons until I made the following tweaks: I sauteed a peeled and chopped granny smith apple and 1 large chopped shallot and added them to the squash when I pureed it. Instead of the cream, I used 1/2 cup vanilla soy milk. I omitted the sour cream all together and of course, freshed grated the nutmeg and was pretty liberal with it. Oh - and my squash was bigger than what was called for (3 lbs). The result was absolutely delicious.

Wonderful roasted squash flavour. Second time I made it I added a little garlic and both times skipped the sour cream. Delicious

I altered this recipe as follows. i used heavy cream instead of nonfat milk. i used regular sour cream to which i carefully folded in some maple syrup. to give the soup some bulk, i added some cut up pieces of canned baby corn and freshy sauted wild mushrooms. along with the grated nutmeg, freshly grated of course, i also used some cinnamon and allspice, salt and pepper. i also roasted garlic and shallots with the squash and pureed them with the squash to give it more flavor. great for thanksgiving.

Excellent soup! I too added a couple cloves of garlic and a leek to the roasting pan as other reviewers had recommended. I used half-and-half instead of milk because that's all I had. I skipped the sour cream and the chives and did not feel the recipe was lacking.

This was delicious. I too did what the other cooks recommended which was slice up some garlic (2 cloves) and some leeks (8 slices of the whites) and roasted them with the squash. Also used half and half instead of milk - but I don't think that did anything for the flavor just made it creamier. I also added a few sprinkles of salt. MMmmm. Delicious! And easy too!

Rating: 3
A good, solid recipe that's easy to make and very tweakable. I'm giving it three forks because this is a good base recipe that can be embellished very easily. As it is, it's a satisfying, healthy soup with a very mild flavour. Next time, I plan to saute shallots (or an onion/garlic mixture) and minced rosemary with a bit of white wine, then add the squash puree to that, and then whisk in the broth and milk.

Rating: 3
I too modified this. I only had half a squash, so added a carrot to the roasting pan (along with some garlic cloves and baby leeks). The squash tasted good out of the oven, so I didn't change too much else. I braised the roast veg in a stock pot, added three small potatoes to fill out the soup, then simmered all in my own stock (veg), and followed the recipe, but blended it in the pot and left out the cream and chives. Quite nice really, warming and smooth.

Rating: 3
This was a pretty solid recipe. I followed previous suggestions and baked one leek and a few garlic cloves (in their skins) along with the squash. Also added 1/4 c. of apple cider and used about 1/2 c. of whipping cream instead of milk. Omitted the sour cream and chives and drizzled a little more whipping cream over top before serving. It gave it a more rich texture and flavor. It's hard to believe there are so few ingredients and it tastes like it is more difficult to make!

Rating: 4
I tweaked this a little for more flavor, roasting 5 cloves of garlic next to the squash, adding 1/3 cup sauteed Spanish onion and 1 Tbsp sauteed fresh ginger to the puree, and substituting vegetable broth for my vegetarian guests. I served it with very thin homemade baguette slices -french bread baked with olive oil, thyme and sage. What a soup --it was so rich and flavorful -- bisque is more like it! It was the hit of my Thanksgiving celebration and everyone wanted the recipe.

This is my favorite butternut squash soup recipe. Roasting the squash first really brings out the rich, nutty flavor.

Needed to double this but didn't have enough butternut on hand so I add baby carrots. Also roasted garlic (in the pods) and shallots, then squeezed the garlic into the processor. Added white pepper, used half milk/half heavy cream and not the entire amount. Garnished with a dollop of room temp sour cream and homemade croutons tossed in butter, sage, and pepper. Served with Epicurious' Apple, Walnut Salad with Maple Syrup dressing prior to dinner of Vermont Chicken pot pie (Savuer).

This is a wonderful, fast and delicious soup. I have tried a number of Squash Soup recipes and so far this is the top of my list. I did add about 2 T. sauted, minced onion to the puree and a pinch of red pepper.

Loved it, loved it, loved it. We took earlier recommendations and roasted a leek and some garlic, which definitely gave it more depth. Fresh squash would be the only way to go, in my opinion, as well. sprinkled some parmesan, a few chives, and some creme fraiche on the top which were great but not necessarily necessary. i look forward to making this dish at a big gathering next - it's sure to please!

Rating: 3
the big variable here is the sweetness of the squash. Made this 3 x's and one time was terribly bland with all regular additions, but i realized the fresh squash was woody with little flavor. Definitely add garlic, onion, dash of cayenne and, if you like it, sauteed apple. but taste the roasted squash FIRST to see if it needs more oomph than that.

This soup was great. My kids asked for seconds! Definitely use fresh squash though, don't substitute for canned or frozen. Whenever available always use fresh veggies. Will definitely make this again and again and again ...

Maybe the big piece of butternut squash I had leftover from another (delicious) recipe had somehow lost its flavor in 4 days. I took others' advice, roasting a leek and 2 big garlic cloves with the squash. Used freshly-grated nutmeg, and seasoned at the end with fleur de sel. Still not very impressed with the flavor, I added butter to the pot before erving. It was simple, though, and at least one household member thought it was delicious.

This recipe is delicious! I had been looking for a simple, down-to-earth butternut squash soup, and this is it. I would, however, encourage going wild with creative spice ideas because the recipe is a little too simply seasoned. I added roasted garlic as per a prior reviewer, a shot of orange juice, and sauteed onions to the soup prior to pureeing it.

Rating: 3
Easy, delicious and nutritious--the three things I look for in a recipe! Following the advice of the other reviewers I roasted a leek and several cloves of garlic with the squash. I roasted these ahead of time, so they were cool by the time I pureed them in the food processor, which probably made this even easier!

I've been making this recipe since it was first published in Bon Appetit in 1996 and it is still my favorite winter soup recipe. It's lowfat and not weighed down with heavy cream, leaving my dinner guests with lots of other things in which to indulge without the guilt!

Yum. I roasted the squash with garlic and an apple. I didn't have any chicken broth, so added a little water and lowfat milk to get the right consistancy. At the end, I added a small amount of lowfat coconut milk just before serving. Nice to have leftovers tomorrow after a busy day. Will make again this Fall. Next time may try some white beans for extra protein.

Add me to this growing list of thrilled cooks making this dish. I followed others' recommendations and roasted a leek and several cloves of garlic along with the squash, then pureed them all together. I also added heavy cream and a little sherry to kick it up a notch. After bring to a hard boil, I poured the soup into a tureen and topped it with a layer of shredded Parmesan and allowed it to melt. Yummy! This is one of those recipes that gives you a lot of bang for your buck -- little time, little money, big results!

This soup is so great - I have made it 2 or 3 times in only a few weeks. It is pretty sweet - a clove or 2 of roasted garlic in the food processor when you put in the squash makes it a little more savory.

After reading the reviews, I made a couple changes of my own. I roasted the squash with a little bit of fresh thyme and olive oil.

I added onions and garlic to the roasing pan with the squash and then pureed all of them before continuing with the recipe. Shallots and celery would be nice additions too. I used part milk and part half and half to give it a creamier texture. Last, I served the soup topped with chopped toasted hazelnuts. Very good.

Yummy, yummy, yummy. I've made it several times, each time tweaking the recipe a bit, adding a bit more flavour to it. Good as presented, but for more flavour, try chopping up an onion, placing some inside the cavity of the squash, some in the pan. I also add 1 clove of garlic - half in each cavity. I also sprinkle squash and pan with oregano, basil and Herbamare. Sour cream is nice add on, but fresh parmesan is really good too. Easy to make, nice soup - keeps well.

This soup was really simple and delicious. For all you vegetarians out there, I substituted a vegetable bullion cube dissolved in two cups water for the chicken broth.

This soup was very easy and doubled well. I did like that I was able to do this a day ahead. I baked the squash in a glass dish exactly 45 minutes and let them cool completely before scrapping them to remove the squash. I found that I needed to add some salt to wake up the flavor a bit. I served the soup with crisp parmesan baguettes for more contrasting flavor. This is an excellent first course for a fall dinner party.

Rating: 3
Using the other reviewers suggestions, I tweaked it a bit and it came out rich and wonderful. I added diced celery, carrots, shallot, and a peeled, seeded and diced apple to the roasting. Splashed a little white wine over the vegies while roasting and added a little more to the soup after I pureed it. Instead of using a food processor or blender I used a hand-held immersion blender. Also, I added a pinch of cinnamon and allspice along with the nutmeg. Finished it with salt and pepper and a small sprinkle of parmesan instead of the sour cream for garnish. It took about an hour to roast instead of 45 minutes and also took three cups of chicken stock instead of two. Yummy indeed.

I made this for my parents last night and we all loved it. My father has a heart condition and is on a no-fat, low-sodium diet, so I used organic chicken broth because it both tastes better and has less sodium, and the results were terrific. (One could probably also substitute 1 cup of dry white wine for 1 cup of the stock.) I also followed a lot of other reviewers' advice and roasted a large shallot, cut in half, with the squash. Finally, I added about 1/4 teaspoon of freshly grated ginger. A great, easy fall dinner with a salad or risotto on the side.

I love this dish! It's a so delicious and very easy to make. It ends up being such an elegant first course for a dinner party. I've served it several times and it always gets compliments. It's probably my favorite soup. I add a little cayenne pepper to it which gives it a nice added kick - I think someone earlier suggested this and it's how I've always made it. The dollop of sour cream when serving make a nice presentation.

This was so easy and even better than I expected! I used organic butternut squash, which I think made the flavor even more delightful. I heeded the advice of other reviewers and added allspice and cinnamon to add more flavor. I also used parmesean cheese instead of sour cream for the topping and it was delicious. I would make this again.

This was one of the best and easiest butternut squash soup recipes I've ever had. Roasting the squash beats peeling, cubing, and boiling it hands-down. I made lots of changes - roasted the squash with an onion (peeled and cubed), 3 shallots (peeled), 2 cloves of garlic (peeled), two carrots (peeled and cut into 3-inch pieces), a stalk of celery, and a sprinkling of fresh herbs (thyme and cervil, since I had them in the freezer.) Sprinkled the whole thing with a bit of salt and olive oil, and roasted for about an hour. Then added 2 cups of chicken broth, a bit of nutmeg, and some allspice and pureed everything (except the squash peel, of course).

This was great and EASY. I added an onion, which I sauteed in butter and pureed with the squash. I also roasted a couple of garlic cloves with the squash -- though next time I will skip the garlic and add carrot instead. (I like my soup sweeter.) I also added some cinnamon along with the nutmeg. I topped my soup with chives and parmasean cheese -- I think the parmesean is a great topping for squah soups, better than sour cream. It's the perfect soup for winter or fall. Next time I am going to double the batch and freeze it. Also, like some of the other people suggested, I am going to brush my squash with real maple syrup next time I make it, I think it will add a nice flavor. Highly recommend this!

Thought this was quite tasty, with the following modifications: added some chardonnay and veggie stock to thin it, some brown sugar, nutmeg, and cayenne pepper, and topped it with maple-sweetened sour cream and spiced pecans (recipe from bon appetit).

This soup was a huge hit at our family's thanksgiving supper. I tripled it, since we're a big family. I used cream rather than milk. 1/2 10% and 1/2 35%. Made it 2 days early, then thinned it with chicken broth and a bit mroe 10% cream right before serving. Topped each bowl with a dollop of maple syrup whipped cream. Everyone loved it, even the squash haters.

I use vegetable broth (or vegetarian chicken broth) and it tastes excellent. For added richness add one cup of heavy cream. Also, you can add a dollop of sour cream and some roasted salted pumpkin seeds as garnish and it looks just beautiful! I brought this to a Christmas open house and a lot of people commented on it. It is really easy!

This was a nice soup for a light dinner. I made it last night for myself and my husband (who isn't much of a soup eater, but liked it). I didn't have nutmeg on hand, so I added a little bit of pumpkin pie spice and then at the last second decided to add a pinch of cayenne pepper to spice it up a little. It was overall pretty good - not as rich as I've had elsewhere - I might try all milk in the future. I just served it with a plate of sliced, cored Granny Smith apples. Nice fall meal.

I took the suggestions of some other reviewers and sauteed half on onion, clove of chopped garlic and some apple in butter and processed this with the roasted squash. (I also added one roasted yam.) Seasoned it with cinnamon and dash of nutmeg. I also used only 1 cup each of broth and skim milk so it had a rich consistency. Yum.

Rating: 3
I also roasted two good-sized carrots and an onion (halved) with the squash and pureed these into the soup; I think that they did a lot for the complexity of the flavors. The amount of stock called for in the recipe might be too low; I liked it as it was, but my family was divided on whether the soup should have been thinner. I opted against the sour cream, instead using gruyere cheese toasted into a "crisp" as a topping for each serving: 1 Tbsp grated gruyere spread into a circle on a greased baking sheet and baked at 325°F for 8 minutes. This was not as nice visually as I'd hoped (the gruyere and the soup aren't different enough in color for there to be much contrast), but very nice from a flavor standpoint.

Rating: 4
Easy and tasty recipe! I used my own chicken stock and instead of 1 cup of nonfat milk, used 1/4 c heavy whipping cream and 3/4 c nonfat milk. Remembering other cook's comments, I added a pinch of cinnamon as well. The soup was really good. I decorated with a spoon of non-fat sour cream and chopped parsley. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

The reviews were so varied, and so many added extra ingredients. After reading the review from a Cook from Chicago, I decided to make it. I agree with him/her, the beauty of this recipe is its simplicity. My husband and I enjoyed it quite well, and I'll be making it again.

Because I don't like low-fat foods, instead of the skim milk I used 2% milk and a little cream in it. I added half a head of garlic which I roasted along with the squash. I added a few tablespoons of sherry to the soup. It was delicious - even my husband who doesn't like veggies loved it.
