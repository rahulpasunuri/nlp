This has quickly become a household favorite! Fresh cilantro is imperative. I serve it on a bed of arugula after drizzling EVOO over the shrimps & mangos.

With my New Year's resolution, I am looking for healthier options. Although the flavors of this dish did not dance in my mouth, it wasn't all that bad. I'll probably look for other dishes though.

I made this for a family reunion. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I did not add the jalapeno pepper though so that everyone could eat it. Next time I will try it though. I was not able to grill the shrimp, so I broiled them with salt and pepper. It was still very good.

My in-laws make almost the exact same salad except they shred the mango and julienne the sweet pepper, as well as steam then half the shrimp so that it's much smaller pieces which marinate better in the lime. But all in all it's an amazing dish!

Awesome flavors! Adjust recipe to 1 lb shrimp with 2 mangoes OR 2 lbs shrimp with 3 mangoes. Excellent summer dish--light and fresh!! Can't wait to have it again!

This was a huge hit at a summer party. Made as is except did did not grill the shrimp. Am making it again this weekend. I may try it with peaches since I have plenty.

My mangos were ripe and the whole thing turned into a mushy mess. I wish I'd kept the shrimp separate and served them on top of the mango salad. I won't bother with this again.

I steamed the shrimp in old bay instead of grilling and omitted the jalapeno pepper. Everyone loved it, even my picky 15 year old.

This salad was awesome. The fresh taste of mango, cilantro and red pepper, with a subtle burst of heat,was magnificent! I just need to learn an easier way to peel and chop mangos! I only used two and it was still delicious.

I love this salad. I made it without red pepper and red onion. It is ideal for summer.

Made this for a picnic. Flavors were great, and it traveled well - we used tortilla wraps to eat it. Will definitely make again

This meets all my criteria for fantastic summer dinner party fare or as a first course: quick, easy and spectacular flavor. I use whole small shrimp; also I add raw pepitas to give it more crunch.

This was a great recipe, I didn't have any cilantro so I used parsley instead, also added grape tomatoes and craisins. I also roasted the red peppers for like 7 mins before adding it. I didn't use any jalapeno pepper but I added "crushed red pepper" when grilling the shrimp. It came out delicious, my wife saved it to pack for lunch.

This was delicious! Grilled the shrimp with oil, salt and pepper. Didnt' have a jalapeno pepper so I used 1/3 of a habenero. I served with homemade pita chips. I would definitely make this again!

This was the quickest easiest alternative to a green salad ever. I left out the Jalapeno pepper. It took almost no time to prepare and once the lime juice marinated with all the other flavors there was an orgy of flavor in my mouth....Cilantro is my new favorite flavor.
