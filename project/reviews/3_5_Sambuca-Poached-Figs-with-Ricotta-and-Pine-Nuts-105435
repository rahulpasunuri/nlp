Lovely.... Fresh cheese is a must. I also served it it with simple, thin crunchy sugar cookies. A huge hit.

Made this recipe for a dinner party and got rave reviews. One of our favorite summer recipes.

I agree with another reviewer that you must know your crowd, but this is a great dish for foodies. Definitely use purple figs as the syrup took on a most lovely lavender color. The salt and pepper in the ricotta really spark it up--get the good ricotta from the deli counter or don't bother making this. The sambucca is strong and will definitely flavor this--however, I tried it with Marsala and less sugar for the licorice-phobes and it just isn't as cool!

This dish appears to be classic high risk/high reward if you are not very familiar with your guest's tastes. Probably better suited for a restaurant offering than a surprise ending for 10 in-home guests. Potential risk reduction: 1) Poach the figs in simple syrup and offer Sambuca when serving and 2) Offer a choice of the seasoned ricotta or simple cookies.

Oh my gosh, this was so good. I made it with fresh peaches and poached them for a longer time than called for. The Sambucca sauce was incredible. I want to make this again and this time I'll look harder for the fresh figs.

At no point in this recipe are you to 'slit the bottom of the figs'. You remove a slice at the bottom so that they stand upright. If you do NOT like Sambuca do not make this. This is fine and worth doing again, certainly.

Yuck? What did I do wrong? Slitting the bottom of the figs before simmering is the only thing I DIDN'T follow. My husband thought this was o.k. I thought the Sambuca was overwhelming. Should I have cooked off more of the alcohol? I would only try it one more time, this time slitting the bottom; maybe more fig juice leaks. If it tastes the same, then yuck for sure and I won't make it again.

I had to substitute a different liquer than Sambuca because my husband does not like anise flavor - I used Frangelico and ommitted the sugar. Very delicious and a great light desert for summer lunchtime. I will use it for a dinner party in the future if I can find fresh ricotta.

Excellent. One of the best desserts we've ever had. I recommend cooking the pine nuts over medium heat, rather than high, as they brown very quickly and could easily burn. Salt the nuts as soon as they're removed from the pan, and drain on lots of paper towels. Also, if 12 figs don't quite fill up the pan, it's fine to add a few extra, as there is plenty of poaching liquid.

We LOVED it!! It was super easy to make, and my boyfriend actually starting licking the sauce off the plate when he thought I wasn't looking. Don't be scared off by the sambuca--it mellows wonderfully in the saucepan. The flavor of the finished dish is incomparable.

The third time I made this superb dessert, I lucked into fresh ricotta. It made a difference. I found it at Fresh Fields, a Whole Foods market. Try Italian groceries, too

Absolutely fabulous. One only needs to find fresh figs.

The only change I made was to toast the pinenuts in the toaster oven instead of on the stove with the olive oil. A wonderful combination!

My type of dessert...Not too sweet..I substituted anise liquor for Sambucca and it worked ok.. For people that are having trouble with figs I tried pears with the leftover liquid..They were great . Peaches, nectarines would work as well. I let the liquid simmer a little after removing fruit to thicken it.

excellent finale

Two liquers that can be substituted for Sambuca are: Anisette and Pernod. The latter is the more expensive item, and will change colour from clear to a murky white. This is a characteristic of the liquer that can work for, or against it, depending on what you are looking for as a final effect. Both liquers are anise based and quite common in liquor stores.

I'm travelling to Italy tomorrow and taking this recipe with me: see what they say there! Sambuca is an "anis" basis so I can imagine using Pastis or even an Anis sirup? (if these exist where you are!)

Does anyone have a suggestion for a Sambuca substitute?

I'm a reformed alcoholic, so this recipe is a real "no-no" for me. I tried to substitute O'Doul's for the Sambuca and it didn't come out so great. The only person who would eat it was Charlie, the guy who always shows up to our AA meetings drunk. Sorry, gotta run, the bottle of vanilla extract is calling my name...

Made this last night-- a major hit

Let me first say that I, personally, loved everything about it--the flavors, the textures and the appearance. However, out of my 3 guests, could you imagine that one hated Sambuca and another hated ricotta cheese. (This left 2 of us to finish it off and, unfortunately, some of it got thrown out.) Little did I know that these are potentially hazardous dessert materials! So I'll be saving this recipe for my more licorice-inclined, ricotta-friendly friends.

A celebration of the palate!! Simply wonderful. I made it with white figs because I couldn't get the black ones, and it was still divine!

Exquisite, subtle, refined and beautiful.
