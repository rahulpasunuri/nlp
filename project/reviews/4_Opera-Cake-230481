Great recipe! Came out perfect on my first attempt...rave reviews from my family. Doubled the recipe a day later (that's how good it was!!!)... Used a half sheet baking tray for the sponge...perfect! I highly recommend doubling up the whole recipe...so much more to enjoy (& share:)

Excellent cake. A bit more on the advanced cake, but if you have baked a cake from scratch you can handle this. I didn't feel like spending the money on almond flour, so I made my own. All I did was roast about a pound of almonds and removed the skin. Then I put them in a food processor and ground them down to a medium powder. Then I put it on a cookie sheet with parchment and stuck it in the oven for a few minutes. It turned out great, gave the cake a bit more texture.

Love this recipe. I made it twice. I think it would be better doubled or tripled. Especially, the buttercream would be easier to make having larger quantities of eggs. Plus, it's so labor intensive, it'd be great to have 2 cakes, or a lot of servings. I know I'll find plenty of volunteers to eat it!

This recipe certainly keeps you busy during the entire duration of making the cake from start to finish. It is delicious, but extremely rich (which one should expect w/ espresso as an ingredient). Definitely worth the work, but definitely not a cake to be done on a whim.

I love this cake. It is impressive to look at, delicious, and easy (but time-consuming) to make. I used slivered almonds, half of which I toasted; as the recipe suggests, I ground them to a powder with the confectioner's sugar. As one reviewer said, the texture is different than it would be with almond flour, but I like the cake with a little texture to it. if your buttercream "breaks," keep beating; it will smooth itself out.

I am looking for a "fancy" bite-sized dessert. I need to make 250 servings. I wish there were pictures - when sliced is this impressive? Any thoughts/hints?

Turns out this a really easy cake to make. Leads to rave reviews. Will absolutely do it again!

I bought almond flour from Trader Joe's, for a much more reasonable price than $14. (Maybe around $5?)

cant wait to try, but does anyone know where to get almond flour? Ipicked up a small bag for 14 bucks, is that how much it should cost?

The buttercream curdled, and I'm fastidious to a fault about buying the best ingredients and following directions - my parents were both chemists that love to bake. I will go back to making buttercream the traditional way, cooking over a double boiler with a whisk, it's pretty much just very very rich pudding when made that way. I used the recipe in the book "Mastering the Art of French Pastry" by Bruce Healy, borrowed from the local library. It was an all day affair - this recipe llooked easier, but wasn't worth the shortcuts.

Let me put it to you this way. It has become my most requested cake. I have to make it for my boss' birthday every year and have been asked to make it for an opening at a gallery I was doing an internship at. If it seems like a lot just be patient and follow the directions. It is absolutely worth it. Unbelievably delicious cake.

here is the missing paragraph that explains "Cut into strips and squares" -- from the Kitchen Notebook on page 193 of the 09/04 issue: ...Pour the batter into one 15- by 10-inch shallow pan and cut the baked cake to form three square layers. Here's how it's done: First, cut the cake in half crosswise, cutting through the paper used to line the pan. Then cut off a 3 1/4-inch-wide strip from the bottom of each half so that you have a total of 2 (roughly 7-inch) squares and 2 (roughly 3- by 7-inch) rectangles. Put the two rectangles together to make the square middle cake layer, et voila. Enjoy this cake, it is delicious and never fails to wow a crowd.

Originally intimated by this cake, it was surprisingly easy. You must look at the diagram on how to cut the cake to stack the layers (not included in the online version). Also, buy the almond flour, don't try to make it from fresh almonds - the consistency doesn't work. Once complete, it is the most delicious elegant cake I have made - FABULOUS!
