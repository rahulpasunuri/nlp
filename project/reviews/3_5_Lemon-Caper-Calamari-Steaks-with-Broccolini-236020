This was delicious and easy. I made it exactly per the instructions except for one tiny thing. I don't eat grains so I used coconut flour instead of all purpose flour. You could not tell. It turned out perfect and delicious!

This was awesome! I bought calamari steak tonight, not knowing what to do with it and came across this recipe. I did as other reviewers said and dipped the calamari in flour, then egg, then flour again. I also did it atop a salad instead of broccolini because I didn't have any. I am soooo making this again and again! I not only impressed myself, but my boyfriend loved it too.

Loved this! Super easy and flexible. I used corn meal in place of the flour and stir fry veggies. I had not had calamari steaks in a while. A great thing to have on hand for a quick dinner party!

I only made the calamari steaks and they were just eh. Not much of a taste to it. Maybe I am just not crazy about calamari steaks?

Enjoyed this meal tremendously! I invited my neighbors, and we all got into the kitchen and cooked. I had a great time going to the seafood store to get the squid. I got a huge frozen block of juvenile bodies plus the tentacles at the top. We followed the recipe, and decided we would cook the tentacles as an appetizer and then cook the steaks. (Oh, yeah, I cut all the squid open, and the first round I pounded, but that made them too thin.) Boy, those fried tentacles were good! I just cracked open an ordinary jar full of marinara sauce to dip them in. Then we cooked the steaks. I think you have to watch out and be sure you don't over-cook the steaks. We did OK. Anyway, it was a great meal and a fun time had by all, I'll definitely do it again!

Used this for thin sliced chicken breast - fabulous! Did double-dip in cheese/flout mix with excellent results - be sure to double that portion of the recipe.

Giving this 3 stars because we did not use the broccoli amd eliminated the cheese. I was lucky enough to find calamari steaks at Whole Foods in Chicago. Being a west coast gal this was a real treat.

Can't believe this is the only recipe on this website for Calamari Steaks! Only used recipe for steak prep. Followed other reviewer's suggestion, and placed calamari back into flour/cheese mixture after egg wash. Excellent result. Golden, moist steaks. Would love more recipes..please.

This was really, really good. I've made it only once, and next time, I plan to be more careful about the temp. of the oil before frying the calamari steaks. It was hot, but not hot enough! The first steak didn't get golden or cooked enough in 1.5 minutes, but the 2nd did. If you do it right, the breading should be golden-brown, and the steak won't be chewy. I added the 1st steak back into super hot oil again, and after about 45 seconds, it browned up and then, the meat was tender - not rubbery. Added some panko and black pepper to the flour mix. The spicy broccolini was a perfect pairing.

Not sure what the one-fork reviewer did wrong. There shouldn't be a strong egg flavor if you follow the directions and let the extra egg drain off. You could also dip it in the flour/cheese mix again afterward for a crispier crust. I made both parts of the recipe as written, only substituting broccoli rabe for broccolini. My wife begged me to make it again, which I have. The kick of the red pepper in the greens went beautifully with the tartness of the lemon-caper sauce.

One fork is generous for this recipe. The egg totally ruins it. I am still tasting eggs as I type this review. The only way I would make it again is if I used only a flour and parm coating on the calamari because I LOVE the lemon, butter, and caper flavors of a picatta style. This is the only dish that my husband has not liked in five years.

The dish was excellent and easy to make. Calamari steaks were tender and the crust was good. Broccolini had a nice kick to it. We enjoyed this dish very much. FYI: calamari steak = squid, just w/out its head. Labeling may vary from market to market. Enjoy!

I also loved squid and this recipe is wonderful. The combination of flavors was perfect. My squid was so tender and perfectly cooked. I will definitely be making this again.

Perfect! I've love calamari steaks for years (thanks to the Fishwife in Pacific Grove, CA) and love how easy and quick this dish is. The steaks cook perfectly with the 1 1/2 minute recommendation and the broccoli is really wonderful - has just enough kick thanks to the red pepper flakes.
