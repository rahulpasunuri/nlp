The salsa is fine but the meat could use a brief marinade in lime juice, oregano, sage, onion, garlic and cumin (and a shot of tequila if you're feelin' loco). Try with short ribs or hangar steak as well. Hint: for really tender meat, add some kiwi fruit or papaya- they have natural enzymes that break down tough meat. Just don't overdo the marinade- an hour or two is quite enough.

Easy to prepare. Fun and filling to eat.

Excellent, reminded me of a little family owned restaurant in Matamoros, Mexico, where we would eat dinner every night when we took a vacation to the Mexican Gulf Coast one summer. Wonderful!
