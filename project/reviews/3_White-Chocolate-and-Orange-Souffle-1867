This is the first souffle I made. It turned out amazing, puffy, beautiful, and totally delicious. I make it for special occasions.

This tasted good, albeit quite really sweet, but it was too dense. Not light an airy as you expect from a souffle. Not sure if it was me or the recipe.

This recipe is absolutely amazing. I frequently make souffles when entertaining and this one is always a hit and requested time and again.

While fairly easy to make I would not repeat this one. I found that the addition of the chocolate made it too dense and much too sweet. It lacked the light and airy quality of a genuinely good souffle.

This dessert was delicious and received a thumbs up from 6 out of 6 people. I used small 1 1/2 cup size souffle cups and cooked 3 with the cup in water and the other cups only on a cookie sheet. The ones cooked in water were more evenly cooked and stayed up longer, so next time all 6 will get the water treatment. Also I mistakenly put in on-half of the white chocolate but the taste was rich enough that no one noticed.
