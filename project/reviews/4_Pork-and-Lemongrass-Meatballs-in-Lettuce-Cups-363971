I thought I'd love this, but it was somewhere between 2 and 3 forks. The components tasted good, but was a mess to eat. As soon we took a bite, dipping sauce was everywhere. Not really a terrible problem for a meal with my boyfriend, but knowing this, I would never make it for company. If I were to make this again I would either add warm white rice to help absorb the sauce, or "skewer and dip" like others did. Side note, the Pork Meatball Banh Mi recipe (this site) has a very similar meatball that I prefer -- it is lighter on the fish sauce, a little spicier, and in my opinion, more pork flavor comes through.

I didn't find it too salty at all! Delicious. Hit with guests.

This is excellent! I used beef instead of pork. Served as an appetizer. To make it easier to eat, I used skewers - first a slice of cucumber then the meatball. People dipped the meatball into the dipping sauce.

Loved this recipe. The meatballs were SO tasty.

Very easy to make and the flavors are very "authentic". Lettuce wraps can be a pain but they're fun. Just don't overload them. You can skip making lemongrass paste and smashing stalks by using the prepared lemongrass stuff that's in a tube in your grocer's produce department. Note that the veg oil is in the wrong spot in the list of ingredients and should NOT go in the meatball paste! The older your fish sauce is, the stronger/saltier it is. Can also adapt to make as an hors douevre (whatever spelling) to pass by making the balls smaller and setting on a thicker slice of cucumber with a toothpick through. Marinate the cukes in the dipping sauce and also drip on as well.

Yummy. Great change from traditional lettuce wraps. Most is make ahead.

Definitely go easy on the salt. To make it a one-dish-meal, I boiled some thai rice noodles, rinsed with cold water (to prevent sticking), and tossed the noodles with all of the dipping sauce. This also made assembly at the table much easier (important as we eat with two little boys!). To make this "sauce" less assertive, I added some rice wine vinegar (mirin) to taste. It made it a better compliment to the noodles. I also highly recommend sprinkling with chopped MINT!!!! mmmm

Ok. This makes a truly beautiful presentation - I put the meatballs in a bowl, and piled everything around it. It was gorgous. However, at the end of the night, most of the accompaniments were still there. The guests loved these meatballs, but found them difficult to manage in the lettuce wraps. They just wanted them on a skewer and dip them in a bit of the sauce! I never make meatballs - they just aren't my thing, but these looked interesting, plus, I could make them ahead of time. I had to agree, they were good, but hard to manage in the lettuce wrap, but they were super tasty all on their own. For make-ahead and easier cleanup, I roasted them in a 450 oven on parchment, turning them half way through. I don't know about the salty factor, but I used half the fish sauce, as I usually do, and they turned out great.

Substututed soy sauce for the fish sauce due to a friends allergy to fish sauce. Turned out amazing !

I thought this recipe was EXCELLENT! Yes I agree a little salty and so I won't add the 1/2 tsp salt in the meatballs next time. I always double up garlic anyhow. I used a hotter pepper. We used Boston Bib lettuce and it didn't have the 'hold up' strength. But otherwise a definite keeper. Very easy to make

I made this for friends for lunch and everyone said it was as good as being at PF Changs. I did omit the chile in the sauce as my friends do not like spice, and it was still excellent. This is a recipe I'll make again.

Different fish sauce brands vary wildly in terms of saltiness, so definitely reduce the amount used if you use a saltier brand, like Three Crabs. It is, however, a very tasty recipe. A really good sear on the meatballs gave it a nice depth of flavor. The dipping sauce was plenty flavorful, so the meatballs could stand to go lighter on the seasoning. I served the wraps with fresh mint, cilantro, slivered carrots and cucumbers. Refreshing and delicious.

True, a little salty. That being said, our 2 and 4 year olds LOVE it!

I read some of the previous reviews and used just 1 Tablespoon of fish sauce in my meatballs and they seemed just about right. (I also used chicken.) The dipping sauce was good, but a little thick so I added a little water and then needed a little soy sauce. I added mint leaves, yellow bell pepper, extra carrots and lots of cucumbers and served this as a salad with some whole wheat noodles. Pretty tasty!

I wish I'd read A Cook in Seattle's review before I made this. The meatballs are WAY too salty. I agree that half as much fish sauce would have been plenty. Instead of putting the shredded carrots and cilantro in the sauce, I served them on the side (did not chop the cilantro) and also included some cooked vermicelli. Even with the noodles, my BF and I couldn't stomach the saltiness. A shame.

This recipe has potential but the fish sauce was so salty and overpowering that it was hard to really know. The other flavors, such as the lemongrass and cilantro, were struggling to come through. I would recommend trying it with HALF the amount of fish sauce since you can always add back the salt but it is difficult to take it out.

I made the meatballs the day before and kept them overnight in the fridge. The next day just mixed up the sauce ingredients and browned the meatballs. Delicious! I just made some cilantro infused rice with pine nuts on the side and it was a great dinner. This one is a keeper.
