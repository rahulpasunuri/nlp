Well, I might make it if I was stuck in a cabin far from a grocery store and the only nonperishables were spinach and pimientos, and someone brought in some freshly caught cod. The spinach mixture ended up watery, and had no flavor. It was much better after I added plenty of Mrs. Dash (thanks to the previous reviewer), as well as some salt, the juice of half a lemon, extra butter, and some sesame oil. If I had thought of it when I was pureeing I would have used sesame seeds instead of oil. Even so, a recipe whose main flavors are salt and cayenne pepper doesn't really do it for me. I thought I ended up with too much spinach puree. And I was unsuccessful at attractively swirling the pimiento puree (which sure is pretty!) into the spinach. My personal preference is also for a spinach dish with more intact leaves.

Delicate flavors, low-fat, very yummy. Have made this several times, added more spinach and used Mrs. Dash to season puree. Perfect for those of us trying to drop those love handles.
