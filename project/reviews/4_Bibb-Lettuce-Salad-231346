This was a wonderful salad perfect if your are serving a heavy entree and a good go to salad that is flavorful and elegant.

Excellent. I was a little skeptical thinking it wasn't enough after reconstructing. Drizzled the dressing over, didn't toss. It was a light salad to a heavy entree and turned out perfect. 3 grocery stores didn't have bibb lettuce. I used butter lettuce. Perhaps they are the same?

Delicious salad. I used baby bibb lettuces because that was what was available, and it was great. Also makes a fantastic salad if you toss it with any good young greens from the farmer's market.

I am learning that sometimes less actually is more. This was so simple and lovely with the house vinaigrette.

the bill lettuce and associated salad dressing are good. the reconstruction of the bill lettuce head is just way too much work especially if you are cooking for more than two people. I could see doing the reconstructed lettuce head for a special romantic meal for two but for a family or a gathering, forget it! Just tear the lettuce into bite size pieces and toss!

I make this constantly. Lots of chefs copy this recipe as well as the beautiful presentation, and once you make it, you'll know why. It is perfect. You can replace the parsley with more chervil, but not vice versa.

It doesn't get more elegant than this, a perfect salad if you have a heavier entree to serve.

I make this twice a week at least. It is simple and wonderful.

This is the classic recipe I was looking for. I used little gems lettuce instead of bibb because they looked better at the Farmers' Market. I also tried the dressing (with the herbs, shallots, and lemon) on roasted beets and blanched green beans, and it was delicious.
