This was very good and easy. The pumking DEFINITELY needs to be drained. I left it in cheese cloth in a colander over night which really did very little. What you need to do is literally wring out the puree. Put your cheese cloth in a clean dish towel and just wring it out. There is A LOT of water in there that would detract from any recipe. A great way to prepare pumpikins from your garden.

I have never drained my pumpkin pure and have had no problems with making pumpkin pie but I did get my recipe from Google and it came with a pumpkin pie recipe. But other then that I freeze the pure and then make all kinds of things with it.

I just couldn't say that the puree was delicious (3 forks) because it's simply just pumpkin puree. It's what you do with the puree later that will make it delicious. Regardless of that, it was pretty easy to make and a good way to use up the abundance of pumpkins I have growing in my garden. The one thing I disagree with in the recipe is how much puree you end up with. I basically doubled the recipe and ended up with about 2 cups of puree after it was drained.

Followed the directions pretty closely except I didn't have a baking dish large enough so I just wrapped each pumpkin quarter in aluminum foil and placed them on a very large cookie sheet. Like the previous reviewer I found it only took 1-1/2 hrs. to get soft. A lot of liquid strained out of the puree. I let it sit in the colander for about 15 hours. Great homemade pumpkin puree, but watch out. By the time you are done, you will have pumpkin everywhere!

This is an easy way to make pumpkin puree as you don't need to peel the pumpkin but only quarter and seed it. The baking time was only 1.5 hour.
