I really liked this. My husband can't have grapefruit juice. Therefore, I substituted orange juice and added a little bit more lime juice. I admit that I was generous with the curry and cumin, but I hardly thought that this lacked flavor.

A nice light summer lunch salad.

This salad was definitely a nice, light meal, but it needed something . . . perhaps more curry powder or some garlic sauteed into the couscous? I liked it, but probably won't make again. If I'm going to save on calories and fat, I definitely want flavor, flavor, flavor!
