Sooooo tasty! I have to admit, I used Harris Teeter brand foie gras with pistachios. Could eat this for dessert!

Have made this recipe multiple times. Always a hit. Absolutely amazing... Don't understand the confusion about what kind of foie gras to use - there is a picture of it!!!! You can use any kind of terrine - have tried duck, goose, with / without truffles. It is a family favorite that our mothers always make if we don't :)

I just read the introduction that showed what kind of foie gras to use. It was not in the actual recipe, thus the confusion. And I don't seem able to delete my previous post.

The recipe is not clear! Is the foie gras from a can? Is it pate? I have raw foie gras in my refrigerator, and I very much doubt they recommend raw goose liver.

Easy and delicious. I don't care but I love foie gras. I'm now going to check out the veal recipes to see if there is this much vitriol.

WONDERFUL! And so simple. I've made it both with foie gras and en masse with duck (around 100 pieces- still easy but dull to pit those dates) and every time it is a super-hit. "How did you think of this?" everyone asks and I just smile. Obviously, if you don't like foie gras for whatever political reason, you won't like this, but that's no excuse to say this dish is one fork: you need to TRY the dish to know whether or not it is one fork.

This is very, very good...a creative use of foie gras is always welcome. If you don't like it, don't eat it. And no, the average person would never make this. That is what is so appealing!

I personally enjoyed the sweet/salty mix, but absolutely everyone else at my Thanksgiving dinner only ate these to be polite.

To "taxlady" from Indiana, on 11/17; perhaps more folks should make things like this. The ability to cook and serve good food is dissapearing in our society! Introduce kids to really great food, and they won't want the trash that our fast food corporations pass off as food.

Very easy and delicious. Sheesh -- if you don't think it is complicated enough, then don't make it. And for heaven's sake, if you don't approve of the practice of making foie gras, then don't eat it! What are you doing looking up foie gras recipes, anyway?

Given the attitude of some of the people reviewing this recipe, it's a wonder you can bear to eat at all. Snowpeas have feelings, too, you know.

I did not make it, but it sounds great. To reply to the animal activists: in the wild all ducks and gees get enlarged liver in the fall, it helps them through the winter or migration (I am not certain which). All man did is to improve on natures design.

Foie Gras is a wonderful thing. Being that this is a culinary web site, I ask that you keep your animal activism where it belongs. But thanks! This is a great recipe btw. Enjoy! Live, love, eat foie gras!
