Excellent! Huge hit with my teenagers. I wanted a recipe that they could grab and run with at 6:30 am and this was the ticket. Made 18 muffins, froze a dozen, pull a few out the night before and ready to go in the morning. I used regular oats, ground flax seed (for the wheat germ) and 2 mashed very ripe bananas (large). I added the boiling water and only let it sit for 2 mins. Next time, might skip the wait as the bananas added a lot of moistness and we liked the chewiness of the rolled oats.

Excellent! I add minced crystallized ginger and sub a little more oats for oat bran and wheat germ. I get an even 18 every time.

There is a reason this recipe has a 100% user rating. The muffins are absolutely delicious. Always toast your nuts before adding to any recipe for their fullest flavor. I made a dozen from this recipe which were the perfect size.

I substituted-whole spelt flour, all oat bran, coconut oil, all brown sugar, and pwdr buttermilk. I also added a few more frozen blueberries. Good good good.

Excellent base for modifying. Used flax seed like another reviewer and instead of blueberries, used bananas. Also replaced the white sugar with Splenda. Left them in the pan a little too long after taking them out of the oven so they were a little harder to get out. Used mini-muffin tins and 18 min cooking @ 350F convection.

These were wonderful. I didn't have oat bran or wheat germ so I subbed 4T of chia seeds. I also used skim milk and lemon juice instead of buttermilk. Lastly I subbed old fashioned oats instead of quick oats because that's what I had. I think the quick oats would have held it together better but the old fashioned gave it a nice, chewy texture. My young kids loved it. This one is a keeper.

I forgot the oil and thought I'd probably ruined them but they were delicious! We didn't even miss the oil! I used ground flax instead of wheat germ. Will most definitely make them again without the oil - why bother with the extra fat if not necessary!

Very tasty and substantial muffins. Keep well. I used 1/4 cup whole bran cereal instead of the oat bran and wheat germ and 2 cups of blueberries and then filed the recipe under "Oatmeal Blueberry Muffins".

I don't even normally review things but I just had to with these muffins! They were truly yummy! I made a batch for work and every single person asked me for the recipe. I made only one sub and that was regular milk for buttermilk. If I had buttermilk I would have used it. I would not change anything about this recipe. I was told by everyone that these need to be in the PERMANENT rotation!

Just to follow up on the Fairfax, Virginia's explanation with regard to sugar: Note the one_blessed_momma reviewer also said she substituted coconut oil. Isn't coconut oil super high in cholesterol while canola oil is not? LOL. Also, I agree with what the reviewer from Montreal said about substitutions. Muffins I made following this recipe as precisely as I could turned out well. In fact, I think they were better the day after rather than fresh out of the oven. I did not use wild blueberries as they're not in season where I live right now. I've never seen them for sale in the grocery store. Seems a bit esoteric. I used domestic blueberries.

FYI- brown sugar is not a healthy substitute as stated by someone in their review: How is sugar made? It begins as sap in tropical sugarcane plants, which are crushed to make sugar juice. The juice extract is heated, creating dark molasses that contain sugar crystals. This is then spun in a centrifuge to remove the molasses. The final product is white granulated sugar. To get its colour, brown sugar has some molasses added back to the white sugar. And raw sugar is just slightly less refined than white sugar, so it retains the last bits of molasses coating. But the amount of nutrients in that small amount of molasses is so insignificant that you have to eat nine teaspoon of sugar that is brown to get the amount of iron and calcium from one slice of whole-wheat bread. In other words, the trace or touch of molasses found in brown sugar or raw sugar is not good enough to make them any more valuable as a source of nutrients.

I don't think you should rate a recipe with four forks if you have made all kinds of substitutions, it is no longer the same recipe! These were great AS IS!

i eat oatmeal and fruit in the morning and was looking for something a little different but still healthy. this was a good base, but i substituted very ripe bananas for most of the sugar and the oil/egg. 2% milk instead of buttermilk. i'm used to full-fat/sugar muffins and this wasn't bad! next time i might add the egg for a little more fat and to make them lighter, but ripe bananas are a great substitute for the sugar and oil. If you're eating one medium muffin for breakfast (they're very hearty so you won't need more), the calories and fat in this recipe aren't bad for the amount of fiber and fruit you're getting at the same time.

Blueberry season is here and this was the perfect recipe for my farmers' market purchase! Excellent as mini-muffins to bring to a potluck. My friends loved them (even people who would never pick up a whole regular sized muffin ate 3-4... they were that good!) The recipe yielded around 50 minis at 12-15 min per batch. (I think it was about 65 calories per muffin which is much healthier than the full size or *gasp* jumbo size in the recipe.) Highly recommended.

I LOVE these muffins. I have made them every week for the past three weeks. My husband and I are very healthy and I have adjusted the recipe a bit, but it is very healthy already! These are the changes- no nuts, 3/4 cup brown sugar (no refined sugar), double the vanilla (2 tsp), I don't keep oat bran and wheat germ in the house but I do use flax meal and wheat bran instead (I also double both of these ingredients), finally I used milk/half and half this last time as I had no buttermilk. They were awesome, again.

I substituted walnuts for pecans, flax meals for oat bran and wheat germ, and dried blueberries. Loved it! Served to guests who adored them too.

Just sampled this muffin fresh from the oven...yum! I've been looking for some "snacks" that are high in fiber to keep in the freezer, and I thought I'd give this one a try. To make it ever so slightly healthier, I omitted the white sugar entirely and used just a little more brown sugar, I used coconut oil instead of canola, and omitted the blueberries (only because I didn't have any on hand) but added chopped dates. I used conventional muffin tins and left them in for only 18 minutes and they are perfect. Great basic recipe, I look forward to experimenting with other variations!

This recipe was exceptional. My daughter loved the batter. I would definitely make it again.

SO easy and SO good! This muffin both looked and tasted great. Using what was on hand, I subbed white flour, grnd flax seed for the wheat germ and chp dates for the blueberries. Wouldn't do it any other way. These are a WOW!. Rarely give 4 stars. these deserve more. My grandson away at college will love them. Made 16 regular size muffins.

A great muffin. Had to substitute the nuts and fruit for what I had on hand but I don't think that changed anything. Took them to a 4-H function. 2 moms asked for the recipe and even the kids liked them.

Solid oatmeal muffins. Used olive oil instead of canola without a problem. I'll be making these again!

This is a great base recipe that can be altered in so many ways. I didn't have buttermilk so I used 1% and old fashioned oats, no white sugar. They were delicious! I had to cut my 4 year old off after he ate 4 in a row...Not the super sweet store bought flavor, but a homemade, hearty, filling, delicious and satisfying treat! I will make many times more!

Rating: 3
very yummy muffins! I omitted the nuts and added a tablespoon of flax seed. I feel they are slightly too sweet. Next time I will cut out all or most of the white sugar (but my kids will probably disagree with me!) I will remind you to let them sit for at least the full 5 minutes before baking to soften the oats. I will make them again for certain. It is a great way to get whole grains into the kids!

I made traditional size muffins, the toothpick came clean at about 18' and they were very moist, so if you're worried about dryness I'd watch them closely, they might be done sooner than you expect. I also decided to add the blueberries still frozen to keep them from turning the batter purple. Lots of requests for the recipe at brunch.

Pretty tasty muffins. They do get crumbly after time and taste best the day you make them. I made the batter 1/2 into muffins and 1/2 into a small loaf - worked fine.

Rating: 4
Seriously the best muffin recipe around and actually healthy! I couldn't believe they were going to be good when I measured out all those rolled oats, but they baked into prettily puffed and tender muffins. All you want in a muffin that can actually be considered breakfast.Do yourself a favor and give them a shot.

My six-year-old daughter and I just made these and I must say, "WOW!". So good and so healthy! We did make a few substitutions--molasses and white sugar for the brown sugar, 1/4 cup of applesauce for 1/4 cup of the canola oil, flaxmeal and flaxseeds instead of wheat germ and an extra 1/2 cup of pecans. So good. My only change might be to reduce the white sugar down to 1/4 cup, or less. These are very sweet, but very yummy. Nice way to get my kids to eat flaxseed.

I love this recipe! I also added a glaze to the muffin. I have done several variations of this recipe including pumpkin, maple, and banana. All have been awesome.

I thought these were hearty and yummy so did all my guests! I used regular oats, 2T flax since I had no oat bran/wheat germ on hand. I left off the nuts per other reviewers comments and even though I subbed 1/4 applesauce for 1/4 oil I had no problem getting them out of my silicone muffin cups. Delicious! I will definitely make them again.

Instead of using 1/2c brown and 1/2c white sugar, I just used 1/2 xylitol with everything else exactly the same. Turned out GREAT with no sugar except blueberries!! My friends raved and had no idea they were sugar free.

Excellent muffin recipe. Very tasty, and moist! I didn't have blueberries, so I used frozen cranberries. The tartness worked fine. Also, I wanted it nut-free so my kids could take it for lunch... and substituted those with dried cranberries. Today I'm cooking them again, and will use frozen Saskatoon berries!!

Overall a very delicious batter, and I am really drawn to the great fiber content. However, I'm curious to try substituting all the oil with applesauce. I've made other muffin recipes that way and it turned out well. I agree with one of the reviewers below in that the pecans were not very noticeable in the muffins. Perhaps next time I'll just sprinkle a few on top for some nice crunch. I baked these as 8 large muffins and unfortunately had a really hard time getting the muffins out of the pan. I was hoping that these muffins would be a little more solid and thus release more easily, but the muffin tops prevented me from being able to slide a knife down under and release them. Next time I will DEFINITELY use muffin cup liners! So, 3 forks instead of 4, because the recipe led me to believe that greasing the pan would mean I'd be able to get the muffins out! :)

Fabulous as is!! + made once again with other ingredients to lower fat and missing ingredients. SO REPLACED... - Oil WITH applesauce - Pecans WITH 1/4 cup Sunflower seeds - Blueberries WITH Strawberries/Pineapple - Cinnamon WITH All-spice - Buttermilk WITH 1% Milk - All dark sugar - FANTASTIC!!!

Rating: 3
These were easy and tasty but they really aren't that healthy in my book at about 250 calories and 11 grams of fat each for 15 regular-sized muffins. Almost 4 gram of fiber though. Next time I'll try subbing applesauce for the oil and maybe leaving out the pecans, which I didn't really notice in the final product.

Excellent muffins! Made it just like the recipe the 1st time & they are fantastic. Next time I may try to substitute applesauce, bananas, & yogurt for the oil, blueberries, & buttermilk as others have tried. I'm hoping they are just as good as the original version!

Great muffins! I didn't read the reviews til after I made them, but they would have been even better with a little turbinado sugar on top :) I used melted butter instead of the oil. Not too sweet, and very satisfying without the unappealing raw-ish taste whole wheat can add. I used white whole wheat. On a side note, I used Pam in XLG muffin tins, and they all came out in one piece after a few minutes on a rack and running a knife around the edge.

WOW! I love these muffins and so does my family. The first time I made them I used blueberries, but I just finished making them again and this time used mashed banana, which is equally good. They are very easy, delicious, and so nutritious... I don't feel guilty eating them :-) This will be my go- to muffin recipe going forward. One note to add - I never have buttermilk on hand, so I make it by putting 1 T of lemon juice in a measuring cup, and filling it to the 1 c line with 1% milk (let it stand for 5 min before using).

Loved these muffins! They were not too sweet and turned out really moist. A great muffin all the way around for breakfast or snack. I substituted with regular oats for quick, light brown sugar with 1T. molasses for the dark, wheat bran for wheat germ, and for buttermilk used 1% with 1T. vinegar. Will be sharing this recipe with friends and family to try.

Delicious. I didn't have oat bran or wheat germ on hand, so used 2T of flax seed meal instead. Also didn't have buttermilk so I substituted whole milk. Skipped the blueberries and pecans and added a cup of mini chocolate chips. I made mini muffins and baked for only 10 minutes. Turned out perfect. Seems to be a very forgiving recipe. Quick and easy. Will make these again for sure.

Just made these delicious muffins with a few changes. Instead of natural oat bran and wheat germ, I used almond flour and flaxseed; swapped 3/4cup nonfat milk and 1/4c heavy cream for the buttermilk; applesauce instead of canola oil; used 1c blueberries and. 1/2c blackberries (cut in half to make them the same size as blueberries). Muffins are moist, not overly sweet, an excellent muffin to jump start a morning.

These are outstanding. I've made them with blueberries, fresh cranberries that I boiled briefly in simple syrup then drained, and dried cranberries. All were wonderful. They're moist but not dense, the nuts give them an interesting texture, they have a subtle sweetness, and they keep well.

I used everything as listed except I added 2 Tbsp whole flaxseed, and used safflower oil instead of canola oil. I used the small cupcake cups, and it made 24. Baked just 20 minutes at 350 in a convection bake oven. I topped each muffin with loose oats, which made them look more like breakfast muffins. They turned out pretty purple with all of those blueberries. :) They are great breakfast muffins :)

I loved this recipe, made a few changes because of what i had in the pantry and will save it that way. Exchanged the buttermilk for 1/2 plain nonfat yogurt and 1/2 1% milk. I had blackberries in the freezer from this season and used those instead of blueberries. Wonderful, will definately make it again

These muffins are wholesome and delicious! They're wonderful still warm from the oven. They sound like they could be on the heavy side, but are moist and fluffy. I used huckleberries, and sprinkled some turbinado sugar on top before baking. A big spoon will work much better than a whisk. Pretty close to 4 forks! I'll be making these again.
