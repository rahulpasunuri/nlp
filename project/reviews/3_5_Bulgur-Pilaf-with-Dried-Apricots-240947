Just made this as written and I thought it was a revelation! Wonderful combination of sweet and spicy. The cayenne has quite a kick. Made it with Rosemary Pork Chops from the same issue of Gourmet. The pairing was better than you might think at first glance. Will definitely add to my regular rotation.

Very quick and very easy. I like to follow a recipe as written the first time to see how it was intended to come out but I agree with the other reviewers: experiment with the recipe by exchanging broth for water if you prefer to do so, add toasted nuts for greater depth, try different dried fruits like cranberries, cherries or dates with the apricots. I will be making grilled tofu steaks and greens to pair with this grain dish for a wintery vegetarian meal.

This pilaf is that nice combo of sweet and savory that I like a lot. I used the suggestion of making the rice part with vegetable broth, as well as adding more cinnamon and some dried cranberries. Also, I subbed barley for bulgar and then stuffed the mixture in 1/2 of an acorn squash.

Yummy! Just made this dish to add to my lunch tomorrow. Super quick, healthy and delicious. I, too, cooked the bulgur in vegetable stock and increased the cayenne because I like things a bit more spicey! Enjoy!!

Very good, I'd recommend using chicken broth instead of water, and add a little more apricots, or raisins.

Wonderful easy side dish. Found Bulgar with Goya beans in latin foods section of store. Apricots give nice flavor, cayenne adds a little zip.

I did not have dried apricots so used dried cranberries. I almost always sub broth for water when cooking grains and used 2 cups of organic chicken broth and organic bulgar. Added some chopped pecans o the top. Delicious.My husband loved the combination of spicy and sweet. The leftovers will be served cold today as part of a lunch salad platter.

Just made adding 1 can chicken broth and about a half cup of golden raisins and toasted almonds. Served with Spanish Chicken: 3-4 lbs cut up chicken, salt, pepper and paprika to taste. Garlic Powder, optional. 1 6 oz can tomato paste, mixed with 3/4 cup beer and 1 small jar (3/4 cup) stuffed olives and juice cooked in crock pot 7-9 hours. Tasted great after all the indulgences of the holiday!

This is an Armenian grain I grew up with, but when using this grain we always used chicken broth. The broth will give it much more depth. It is also made in many different ways.

I made this for a family Hanukkah party. I served it as a side dish with a beef stew for the omnivores and as a main dish with my version of a greek salad for the vegetarians. Everyone loved it and it was really really easy!

I expected to really like this recipe but was disappointed by the lack of depth, like something was missing. Maybe more sweetness, more apricots, or as others have done, adding other fruits like cranberries or raisins. My husband and guests didn't care for it much either. I followed the recipe to a tee, and will not be making this one again.

I really expected to like this and was disappointed by it's lack of depth. It needed something -- maybe a little more sweetness. I ate a fair share of it and threw the rest out.

Correction to my last comment. I increased the water to 2 cups. Sorry.

I couldn't find bulgar, so I substituted quinoa (found it at Trader Joe's) Increased the water to 1 cup. Everyone loved it, especially my 4 year old grandson, who had 3 servings. Quinoa is very nutritious, being a complete protein, so would be especially good for vegetarians.

This dish is really delicious!!! Wonderful flavor!!! I just made it for lunch and I can't wait to make it again (and add the recipe to my Taste Book!) I added extra water, dried cranberries, and I cut up almonds and mixed them in at the end.

The bulgur I used required more water. I liked the taste of this easy side dish, it reminded me of Moroccan dishes. You could use raisins if you don't have apricots and maybe add some nuts to top it off.
