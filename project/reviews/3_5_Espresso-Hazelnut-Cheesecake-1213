Good. Flavorful. The cake took longer to bake than 1 hour 15 minutes. I did not beat the remaining 2/3 cup cream. Too too much fat! I topped each slice with Cool Whip Free and it worked.

Just took this out of the pan in preparation to garnish....a big thumbs up! Very flavorful and rich--the perfect ending to our Easter celebration. I used chocolate wafer cookies for the crust, since I didn't have any of the called-for butter cookies. Also added some unsweetened cocoa powder {about 1/4 c.} to the cake batter itself. {You can never have too much chocolate.} Terrific!

This dessert would be a hit at any party. Rich and delicious. However, the preparation takes a while, so i would only recommend forspecial occasions when you have the time and patience.

I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday. People loved it and came back for more! It was absolutely mouthwatering. The roasted hazelnut crust is delicious, and instead of using chocolate covered espresso beans for garnish, I used ghirardelli's bittersweet chocolate squares and a single gardenia to top the whipped cream.
