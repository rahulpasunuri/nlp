As written, these muffins would be way too sweet. I can't see how you can classify these as healthy when there is nearly 1 Tbl of sugar in each muffin and that's not counting the topping, the apple, or the raisins. That said, I reduced the sugar by half, left off the topping and they were quite good. They are not big risers (even at an altitude of 5400 ft) so make sure to fill the cups nearly full. Good way to use up part of a can of pumpkin.

Muffins were the worst that I have ever made. Especially from Epicurious. Followed recipe exactly as shown, and only took out the raisins and the nuts as they were supposed to be for a grade school function for my son in Kindergarten. I doubled the recipe as well, as he needed muffins for 20 kids. The batter never raised. The batter when cooked, tasted like it was still uncooked even though i gave them the 30 minutes plus an extra 15 minutes longer in the oven in hopes that this would help. If i could give this recipe zero forks in rating, i would have. I had to throw the entire double batch in the garbage. I will not be making this muffins again.

Muffins are quite good but do require some changes. Sugar should be cut down (very sweet) and the topping is useless and does just crack off when cooked. No issue with the muffins not rising, etc.

Rating: 2
Nothing special even after making suggested alterations. Mine did not rise hardly at all and so the consistency was not what I would have liked.

These are delicious! I cut the sugar to 1.5 cups and used regular flour, because that was all we had. Used hazelnuts instead of walnuts. The topping isn't crumbly once cooked - more like a crunch glaze. Yum.

Rating: 3
Followed the recipe pretty closely and they are yummy muffins! I would probably reduce the sugar next time as they are certainly plenty sweet. Used a generous mixture of cinnamon, nutmeg, ground ginger and allspice. I added the topping, but I think the amount of butter should be reduced. I ended up with more of a paste than a nice crumbled topping. Worked out fine once baked.

These were good, very tasty. I did make some adjustments though. I used Kobacha squash pureed with some rum, I doubled the spices, doubled the apple and omitted the raisins and walnuts. Turned out very good.

These are a big hit in our house. I also use half the sugar, and I use oats instead of white flour. A hearty muffin for busy mornings.

Made lovely mini muffins. I made some changes, that made these wonderful for a weekday breakfast on the go. I used all whole wheat flour. Thanks to a previous reviewer I cut the sugar to 1 cup. I used 2 large egg whites, golden raisins and did not use the topping. I would add a little more spices next time. But overall, a moist, and plenty sweet with the fruit little muffin!

These muffins were really excellent, but I cut the sugar in half (yes, in half!) and they were still perfectly sweet, with a great texture. I also reduced the oil by maybe a quarter. So, I'm giving the recipe as-written 3 stars -- why on earth would you need 2 cups of sugar?! I'd say the muffins as I made them, though, were 4-star muffins, definitely a go-to recipe. I also didn't use the topping, but I did sprinkle a bit of raw sugar on top before baking. The batter seemed a little bit dry when I was spooning it into the pan, but they puffed up beautifully, and came out moist and delicious. My husband and 3-year-old son thought they were fantastic as well.

Delicious muffins! Husband said these are now his favorite! Followed the recipe exactly but would probably use less sugar next time. Are these really healthy? Would be curious to see the nutritional info.

This was a really good recipe. Could use more cinnamon. Omitted the walnuts. It was fairly easy and smelled delicious. The muffins DID taste better after they had cooled, I thought.

I've made these twice & they aren't socks-knockers. Added a streusel topping & even that didn't do it. Maybe the canned pumpkin is to blame...

My 4-year old and I thought these were really good! Very moist and flavorful. I only used 1-3/4 cups sugar and would reduce that by anther 1/4 cup the next time, since the topping is so sweet. I also only used about 1/2 of the topping.

I got lots of compliments on these, even without the topping. Mine, at least, didn't rise much - all the juicy pumpkin and apple kept them kind of squat, but they are tasty!

These muffins were awesome. Everyone who has had one has loved it. A few things that I did differently though were that I puréed real pumpkin instead of canned, I used agave nectar instead of sugar and I cut the walnuts. They came out great, not too sweet but still really delicious. Highly recommend

This is my second time this week to make these muffins, they are amazing! Everyone has their own go-to pumpkin muffin recipe and this is now mine. What I did differently: I did 1 1/2 times the recipe- this way I used a whole 15 oz. can of pumpkin, I also grated the apple instead of chopping it. I never use pumpkin pie spice, so instead did a mix of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, allspice, and cardamom. Makes about 30 muffins- yum! Great for kids. Great with or without topping.

Rating: 4
These muffins are yummy. They do have a heavy texture, might be great as a bread. I will cut the fruit pieces smaller next time. Did not make the topping and they were just fine. Made the kitchen smell wonderful.

Try reducing flour to 1 1/2 cups (I used 1 cup all-purpose and 1/2 cup w/wheat) and sugar to only 1 cup. I substitute baking soda for baking powder, you can also cut back on raisins to 1/2 cup. This recipe will make 12 perfect muffins.

Rating: 4
These are great. I used 2 1/2 cups whole wheat pastry flower, and left out 1/2 cup of the sugar, added about a 1/4 cup OJ instead. They came out moist and very flavorful. Next time I'll try to substitute some of the oil with apple sauce. (Always trying to make healthier for my toddler.) Take or leave the topping and they're still great.

Rating: 4
These were incredible. Fall, Fall, Fall! Very moist and flavorful! In response to other comments, I switched the proportions of white and wheat flour. Maybe that took care of the dreaded dry muffin syndrome? I added a little orange zest too for complexity. You might want to try topping them with a simple glaze of molasses and powdered sugar (and orange if you used it) just to change them up a bit.

Rating: 2
These muffins were bland and heavy. The pumpkin flavor did not come through, only the apple and a hint of the pumpkin pie spice. The only change I made was to add 1/3 cup of yogurt as the mixture looked dry and dense. It didn't help. Will not be making these again.

Rating: 4
Yummy! With or without the topping. Pair a warm muffin with some fresh cheese curds and a mug of hot chocolate and settle into fall!

I have made these several times, both with pureed pumpkin as well as with canned. They always turn out wonderful. I experimented with added spice, and a bit more apple. I brought them to work and my co-workers were blown away! I have to bring them the recipe now...

This recipe was ok, but it tastes a lot better when you use real pureed pumpkin instead of canned. The real pumpkin also adds a bit of needed moisture.

The muffins were wonderful, and not too sweet for my family, as some reviews suggested. I did put a few less apple pieces in and added a 1/2 cup applesauce because the batter seemed too thick. I didn't want dry muffins. They turned out great, but they may have turned out great if I had just followed the written recipe. Very moist, tasty and filled the house with a wonderful scent.

This was great (though a bit sweet)! Everyone raved about it. The topping makes a sweet caramelized crust on top. I prefer to put dribbles on so that the top has bits of chewy caramely topping and bits of regular muffin showing through. This is definitely on my favorites list.

Rating: 3
The comments intrigued me so I set about to make a muffin and fix the complaints. I reduced the sugar to one cup, increased the baking powder to 1 1/2 tablespoons. Both of these corrections are based on baker's percentages for muffins. I then added 1/2 cup of nonfat yogurt to make up for the lack of liquid. I keep a standard streusel mix in my freezer so I used that instead of the one everyone seemed to complain about. The muffins are delicious.

Rating: 2
I was really excited about making these and I was really upset when they didn't come out the way I expected. They didn't spread in the cupcake cups, they never really seemed to cook properly and they smelled so good...My family was disappointed. Maybe I did something wrong...

Rating: 3
I made these without the streusel topping for my son's preschool class, where only "healthy" treats are allowed. I cut back the sugar slightly and added dried cranberries. The result was fruity sweet, not sugary. 23 of the 25 kids gobbled them down, some even peaking around the corner to see if there were more. I would definitely make these again, but probably would keep the topping if it was just for my family.

Rating: 0
These are in the oven now, so not sure how they'll taste or turn out, but I had to comment on the topping....the proportions seem all wrong. This might explain several reviewers issues with brown or hardened sugar on top. Mine was nowhere near crumbly, so I added 2 tablespoons oatmeal, then several more tablespoons of flour, still didn't seem quite right. I have a recipe for a Dutch apple pie with a crumb topping consisting of: 1/2 c. flour, 1/4 c. butter, 1/4 c. brown sugar. Turns out great every time.

Rating: 3
Really like the texture of these muffins! They are moist, although a bit sweet. Read the other reviews after I made them...will cut the sugar next time. I used craisins instead of raisins, extra granny smith apples and no nuts. Liked the crunchy texture of the topping, but too sweet. My kids love them!

Rating: 4
Everyone loved these muffins! I took someone's suggestion to use Granny Smith apples. They were so moist! I made 1/2 without the topping and they were good, but I think the topping helped bring out the flavor. I will definitely make these again!

Rating: 2
Tried to make mini-muffins -- disaster! They were flat & misshapen. Put the rest of the batter in a loaf pan, but it fell apart when I tried to take it out. Both so ugly! However I did like the moist texture and the flavor. I might try to make it as a bread again, or even spread it out into a brownie pan and make bars. As a bar cookie, you wouldn't notice that they don't rise at all. I used 1 and 1/4 cup sugar, and no nuts.

Rating: 2
All I can say is that these are edible at best. I agree with one reviewer that called them "little rocks". I did not want them too sweet so I reduced sugar to 1 cup. My topping also turned out into a brown goo, which I debated on using at all, but then just smothered it on top. So the top came out hard. I almost always love recipes from this website, but this one was not good...sorry...

Rating: 3
I made these last week and I have another batch in the oven right now. I replaced 1/2 cup of the white flour with bran and added dry oats. I enjoy a muffin with some sweetness on top but I only used half the topping - very tasty and not overly sweet. This week I replaced the apples with rhubarb, omitted the raisans, added more walnuts and topped the muffins off with some of the topping and a couple peices of chopped rhubarb. Haven't tasted them yet, still cooking, BUT they look pretty tasty.

Very tasty! My whole family loved it. I substituted 1/2 cup sugar for the real stuff and it was still excellent.

My kids will not lay off these--a sure sign of success. I made some adjustments--1 cup of sugar only (1/2 brown; 1/2 golden), 1 1/2 c. all-purpose flour, 1/2 c. corn meal, 1/4 c. whole wheat flour, 1/4 c. wheat germ and about a 1/4 c. raw oats, and no topping. Wow--they're really tasty. Not too sweet, not too dense--just right. And like I said, my kids won't leave them alone!

Rating: 4
These were delicious and very easy. I skipped the nuts and raisins but doubled the amount of apples which was fine. The one recommendation I would make is to make sure to cut the apples pretty small or they get in the way putting the batter in the cups. Also, the topping is very sweet so I think I'll skip it next time or use just a tiny bit.

Rating: 2
I wish I had read all of the reviews before making these muffins. I reduced the sugar to 1 -1/2 cups and omitted the topping but still found them to be too sweet. I didn't take into account the sweet apple, rasins, and "Sugar Pie" pumpkin. I suppose it all depends on one's personal preference, though. Overall, I thought the muffins had a nice flavor and I would make them again, with less sugar.

Delicious muffins. As suggested by another reviewer, I omitted the crumb topping for a healthier muffin, and were very pleased.

I've used this recipe as a staple for fall pot lucks for a few years now. I halve the sugar and usually don't bother with the streusel, and it is always fantastic! It's a satisfyingly sweet yet hearty dish, and makes a great bread too.

I think these are fantastic! Mine baked perfectly with a crunchy brown sugar and butter crust on the top. They were dense and moist with just the right amount of sweet. I used a granny smith apple, maybe that is why the sweetness was subtle. I will definitely make again.

Excellent muffins! I wanted a "wholesome" bran-ish pumpkin apple muffin. So I combined this recipe with a bran flax muffin recipe. I took the substitution advice and replaced the pumpkin pie spice with 2t cin. 1t ginger, 1t allspice & 1/2t nutmeg, reduced the sugar to 1/2c brown & 3/4c white( which I think I will reduce even more, still pretty sweet) replaced the oil with 1/4c canola oil 1/4c applesauce to lower the fat. No raisins instead upped the apples to about 1 1/2c and switched the 1c white flour to 1/2c bran and 1/2c flaxseed meal. Make sure you tap the muffin pan, the thick batter does not settle while baking. Delicious & Healthy!!

I really wanted to love these muffins, but they just didn't turn out well. A friend said that they tasted more like fruitcake than a muffin and I think he's right--the texture is too heavy for a muffin. And I even left out the nuts! The recipe might be better if it were modified into pumpkin-apple bread, but I was disappointed with these muffins. Finally, I found that they had the slightly bitter taste that I sometimes get when I bake with pumpkin. It's almost like a baking soda aftertaste. Any suggestions for how to get rid of this unpleasant finish?

Rating: 2
The muffins were very tasty. I omitted the pumpkin pie spice and instead used cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. My only complaint was the topping. It didn't turn out crumbly at all. I had a melted dark splatter on top of each muffin instead. Next time I think I will omit the topping and just make the muffins.

I don't usually give reviews to recipes that I don't find to be exceptional; however, I have been on the search for a fabulous pumpkin muffin recipe and have come up short again. I write this for those of you who are also on this quest. Although a moist muffin, I felt the flavors were a bit overwhelming. The molasses conflicted with the clove, in turn stifling any hint of the delicate pumpkin flavor. One more down...the search goes on. If anyone has a stellar pumpkin muffin recipe, please, please pass it my way.

With a few changes, this is a great muffin recipe. I used all whole-wheat flour, 1 1/4 cups sugar, 1 1/4 - 1 1/2 pumpkin, and 3/4 c. raisins. Instead of pumpkin pie spice, i used 2 t cinnamon, 1 tsp each of ginger and allspice and 1/2 t nutmeg (from another reviewer). I made 12 BIG muffins (baked for 34 min.), so i decreased the butter to 3T for the topping. My 4 year old loves these! I also find them very moist and flavorful with the changes mentioned above.

Didn't absolutely love the muffins. I reduced the sugar to one cup (as suggested by other reviewers) but found the muffins to be bland...maybe pumpkin is just not flavorful enoug. Also, instead of pumpkin pie spice I would add fresh nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger all separately. Topping was good.

I was well into mixing the ingredients for this recipe before I opened my can of pumpkin to find that it was bad. So I looked around the kitchen for something to substitute . . . I put a large sweet potato in the microwave, then mashed the flesh, and voila! I used 2 cups of chopped apple and no raisins or nuts. My co-workers are raving about the muffins, and one of them asked if I'd e-mail the recipe to his wife.

I just made these muffins--anything pumpkin is a favorite of mine--for my New Year's Day breakfast. Yum. The recipe I found had a few variations from this one, and I would make a few of my own. I used two cups of unbleached flour (maybe that helps texture?), I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I threw in about a T of cinnomon, and lesser amounts of ginger, nutmeg, and cloves. I also used two cups of apples and no raisins. I found the recipe to be overly sweet, so like other reviewers I'll probably use a half cup less sugar next time. But if you're a fan of pumpkin and sweets, I think you'll find this recipe to be irresitable.

Rating: 2
Like other reviewers, I cut the sugar in half and I'm glad I did. I was torn with this recipe, though. On the one hand I was happy to find a recipe that had whole wheat flour incorporated into it. But, as expected, they were somewhat bland. If you're looking for a recipe that is healthy, go for it!

What is everyone talking about! I have this recipe from a different cookbook--seems to be exactly the same recipe--and i really like these muffins. i especially like the crumbly topping. I suppose, though that they are _very_ moist, more like a yummy pumpkin bread than what one normally thinks of a "muffin" being. So if that's what puts you off, bake them in a different sort of container!

I modified this recipe according to one of the other ratings and this recipe was terrible. I would never make it again. The muffins were dense and too moist. The texture was not enjoyable at all. I added spices such as ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg because the original recipe did not call for them and it still did not help.

I had to try this recipe to see how bad it really was. I only made half and it was pretty bad. So I was on a quest to moisten and zip this recipe up. I split the sugar 1 cup of white and 1 cup of dark brown. Instead of vegtable oil I used sweet butter and/or blue bonnet for cooking and added a 1/2 cup of applesauce. I shredded the apples instead of chopped and replaced raisin with cranberry raisins. They were delicious.

After reviewing the recipe and reading the reviews, I thought I would give this recipe a try. I LOVE pumpkin muffins! But this recipe fell way short of my expectations. Pumpkin, apples, walnuts, pumpkin spice, etc. all add up to a big disappointment! This recipe was average at best. The outcome was not as rich tasting and dark as I would have liked either. I haven't given up though, maybe I'll have better luck with the SPICED PUMPKIN BREAD recipe also on this site.

Wonderful muffins! The combination of nut and apple and raisin is fabulous. The pumpkin is very subtle. I held back on the sugar, because of other user reviews, but still I used 1 and 1/2 cups because I like sweet muffins. They are sweet enough I didn't feel compelled to make the topping either. I should have only used 1 cup that would have been ideal.
