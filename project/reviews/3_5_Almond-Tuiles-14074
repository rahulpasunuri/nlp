Absolutely delicious! Easy to make and I usually have all the ingredients in my kitchen. I've made them four times now and they are a hit every time and I'm always asked for the recipe. Two modifications: 1) I cook them for 10 mins, turning once in the middle of cook time. 2) I don't bother rolling them. Just let them dry flat on a cooling rack and they're great. I serve them with vanilla ice cream and homemade creme de cocao chocolate sauce.

Both temperature, and baking time had to be adjusted or tuiles were not done, only the third batch turned out. The finl 5 were very tasty, but too frustrating to be following a recipe exactly and not have things turn out.

These are a family favorite. My mother had a very similar recipe from her cookbook she brought to the states over 50 years ago. I have made them multiple times using different techniques - stoneware, steel pans, parchament paper, higher temp/shorter time, lower temp longer time, and they all come out good. But I have found that the metal pan works best. I bake about 8 minutes then turn the pan around and bake for another minute or so to get a nice golden rim all around the cookie.

This was a great recipe-simple and easy. I do prefer using the parchment paper over the spray for a less oily cookie. I also change the parchment with each batch for same reason. Cookies are much easier to lift off. Served this as the dessert course(with a scoop of ginger sorbet inside)for an elegant Asian dinner party.

Very good and easier than other tuile recipes I have previously tried. I ground a few coffee beans with the almonds, which added a nice subtle coffee flavor.

So easy to make and so tasty and beautiful! I used some left over egg whites, skipped the almond paste. My husband devoured the whole batch in one sitting.

These turned out so tasty. Thin and crisp and golden brown. I used a baking stone, and it made the cooking time take twice as long, but the results were very good. Yumm!

the cookies are supposed to be really thin and really crispy and they didn't turn out that way. Since i've allready made a different type of tuiles in the past, I'll be making some modifications next time around. more liquid less flower. lower baking temp and more time to cook. An Idea: I use these cookies in a really magnificant dessert it's a strawberry tower with whipped cream: place a cookie on a personal serving plate. using a decorating bag, make whipping cream circle close to the cookies' edge. place strawberries on the whipped cream. between the strawberries add whipped cream poles. put some whipped cream on top of each strawberry and place a cookie on top of the strawberries. repeat. serve with a little passion fruit sprinkled around the strawberry tower. bon apetit

The recipe is simple and the cookies are beautiful and delicious. I've used the recipe to make more refined fortune cookies as favors for parties. A suggestion if you're short on rolling pins or drying space: Let the cookies cool for a moment, then while they're still pliable, place them in styrofoam cups to cool. Make sure the cookie isn't too hot, or you'll melt the cups. I find that the cookies tend to slip off the rolling pin, and easily shatter.
