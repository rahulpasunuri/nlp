I've made this a few times and my family loves it. I go a little heavier on the ginger and the soy sauce, but not much more than what's here and otherwise follow the recipe. It's light and flavorful.

The worst dish I have made in a long time. Big disclaimer: I used veggie "chicken" and sherry wine vinegar (instead of sherry).

Pretty good. The kids liked it. It is simple and filling. But not great.

2.5 Needed something, but it was easy and quick! Maybe it needed Oyster sauce

This was good, but could use more flavor, maybe red pepper flakes or something to add heat. I've had luck with Scotch as a replacement for Sherry.

Chicken needed to be cooked longer before adding cornstarch. I also added in some chicken broth as the sauce was too thick. Flavors are fine without the extra salt. I put a little sricha red jalepeno sauce with this and my rice and that really made the dish "pop"I also added some black pepper at the end of the sautee.

Seriously, will Scotch make a good substitute for sherry? Sounds crazy to me.
