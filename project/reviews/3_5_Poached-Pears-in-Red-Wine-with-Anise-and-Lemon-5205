I received a shipment of pears for a christmas gift and racked my brains figuring out what to do with them. Most I gave to neighbors, but I reserved 2 pears for my own use. The dish was easy to prepare and delicious. I cut the ingredients since I was only cooking for 2. I substituted a cinnamon stick for aniseed, because that is what I had. My husband is diabetic so I used Splenda instead of sugar. Otherwise, I did not change the recipe. I will definitely make this again.

I used pears that were not so ripe, I wanted to simmer them for a longer time to infuse the wine, it came out wonderful. A great fall desert that isn't that high in calories. The reduced syrup made for an great presentation and the taste was so wonderful!

While this dish was pretty, I don't think the results were worth the effort or the ingredients.

also, try the wine reduction as a drink: 1 part wine reduction to 1 part vodka

This is an elegant dessert and the wine reduction is superb on ice-cream too! However, for a real show-stopper, I added the following twist: Make a mascarpone cream by lightening the mascarpone with some whipped cream, using a piping bag, fill the core hollows with the cream and top with warm chocolate sauce. Basil leaves are a lovely garnish!

I used two star anise instead of the anise seeds -- and the dish was delightful and reminescent of Parisian bistro pears I've often enjoyed. My husband liked the reduced syrup so much he insisted I save it -- and used it to make a spicy and fruity "kir" with sparkling white wine.

I reduced the recipe for 2 pears. I used about 1/2 to 3/4 of a bottle of fruity red wine ($14). I added 1/2 tsp vanilla instead of the bean, which I didn't have around and also used orange peel instead of lemon. This would be an excellent recipe if you have your own pear tree and need to use up fruit!

A wonderful, uncomplicated-tasting, yet different dessert! I'd do this recipe again, but will also try other variations on the red wine theme. Great!
