I made this for a friend's BBQ over the weekend, and everyone loved it! It was cool and crisp, and a nice foil to all the meat we were eating! I made it just as a salad, though, and not with the pita bread (or chickpeas), but it still came out great! I made the dressing in advance and it seemed to have more (garlic and oregano) flavor when we used it.

A delicious salad for lunch with the girls! I did have to spice up the dressing with more of everything but the oil and then I spiced up the chickpea puree with extra garlic and salt. Other than that, it was fabulous! The flavors were very well balanced and the puree was so easy! For all of you who haven't tried making the puree, using the dressing for seasoning really brings all the flavors together!

Fresh and delicious goodness! Added extra an garlic to the chick peas, whizzed it up in the food processor, drizzled some olive oil and sprinkled paprika on top. Great hummus!

This salad is amazingly good! I made it exactly as it is written, except adding a bit more oregano and more lemon juice. I couldn't find anything labeled as "pocketless pitas", but did find some wonderful wheat flatbreads in the grocery store. They are round and the size of a large pita. I grilled mine in a le creuset grill pan. They aren't much thicker than pitas but without the pocket, they stay moist and chewy on the inside and get golden and crispy on the outside. Every time I make this recipe I am surprised at how good it is. It sounds like nothing too special but it is a completely satisfying dinner (and I'm not vegetarian). I rarely make recipes over and over again, always wanting to try something new. I have made this several times, and my husband and I can't stop eating it!

This is perfect and simple. The chickpea puree has less fat than hummus, sporting an austere but satisfying flavor profile.

I make this salad every other week and I have worked out some things. I buy the hummus already made and I make the dressing and pita. I have found a better dressing which is this; 1/4 cup olive oil, 4-6 tsp lemon juice, 1/4 tsp kosher salt, 1/8 tsp black pepper, 2 tsp capers, minced and a pinch of dried oregano. The pita is super easy and very worth making. It comes from Mark Bittman. In a food processor put 3 cups all- purpose flour, 3 tbl olive oil, 2 Tsp instant dry active yeast, 2 tsp kosher salt, 1/2 tsp sugar. Turn on and blend. Pour 1 cup of warm water in the tube and blend until it forms a ball. Turn dough into a lightly oiled bowl, cover and let rise, 1 to 2 hours. Cut dough into 8 to 12 even pieces. Cover pieces and let rise 20 minutes. Roll out dough to less than 1/4 inch thick and let rise another 20 minutes. I cook it on a cast iron grill pan (flat side) for a couple of minutes each side. You can also cook it in a 500 degree oven on an oiled baking sheet or pizza stone for 5 to 10 minutes. Excellent!

Really tasty. Adding grilled chicken for the non-vegs is a great addition. Also, make your own pitas, wicked easy and already hot and ready to stuff out of the oven

I hate to argue with the "cooks note" at the bottom of the recipe, but when my pitas ballooned up out on the grill I just went with it, cut them in half, smeared the insides the chickpea spread, and stuffed the salad inside It was AMAZING! Also, since my family is anything BUT vegetarian, it was a fantastic way to use up the single leftover greek marinated chicken breast grilled the night b4, chopped up & mixed with the salad. Definitely a keeper and a tweaker.

Love this salad. Salty with the feta and olives. Tart with the lemone and feta. Crunchy with the cucumber and chick pea and creamy with the feta and hummus. I increased the oregano in the dressing and added thinly sliced sweet oniion. So additonally it was sweet with the grape tomatoes and onion. The pita bread was a great alternative to croutons. I kept the pita sort of soft and chewy, so this added another dimension. I have never had a better Greek Salad.

This is an excellent fresh, healthy meal with lots of flavor. I will definitely make it again and again. A word of caution; it takes more than 10 minutes for the chopping, dressing, and chickpeas.

Made as written- really good except for the hummus part, it didn't taste exactly right. The second time I made it I ended up buying hummus from TJs and skipping that step-- saved time and tasted better.

We double the spices for the dressing/ hummus cut the oil to 2 tbsp. and use 1/3 cup of lime juice.

This is so delicious and so easy. It's so satisfying. I love the hummus part, too. I can't find pocketless pitas in my area, so I've been using whole wheat wrap bread, and that works really well.

I did follow the recipe exactly, and it's just a really tasty quick meal. have made again and again... The chickpea spread makes a great and very easy hummus-like dip on its own.

this will be one of those reviews that say-- well, I didn't follow the recipe but it was really good! Made fava bean and chick pea hummus, used Newman's own Oil and vinegar, feta cheese, greens, cherry tomatoes grilled chicken and grilled salmon and it was YUMMY! An excellent starting point to create your own salad--used the grill to actually grill the pocketless pita bread--just a great meal.
