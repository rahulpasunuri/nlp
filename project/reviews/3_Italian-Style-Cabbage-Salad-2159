I love this recipe, it's simple, delicious, healthy & always gets great reviews. My guests always pleasantly surprised at its simplicity. The flavors continue to develop & it lasts a few days.

Refreshing change of pace for fresh cabbage. It's flavor is subtle, and a nice accompaniment for spicier dishes.

This is just DELICIOUS. However, it needs a bit tweaking. I used one can of white beans (great addition) and added an extra tablespoon each of olive oil, red wine vinegar and capers (two is just not enough) - otherwise the sauce was too thin. My husband and I savored this wonderful salad on a warm summer night with a thick juicy steak! Wonderful!

Very simple and delicious. I used fresh green cabbage and also added canned white beans suggested by another member. Served leftovers topped with tuna. VERY good!

I have made this several times. It is very quick and good. I substituted chopped green olives once when I had no capers and that was good too. (Capers are better though)

This is an excellent and incredibly easy salad. I've made it several times and everyone has loved it. I've also added white beans and/or Italian canned tuna.

Caraway seeds and spring onions go very well with the recipe. But crushed garlic is a must!!

This recipe was tasty and quick. I decided to make dinner for myslef tonight as my lovely wife is working late. I was looking for something healthy(a promise made to the aforementioned spousal type). it took me five minutes to chop and 2 minutes to make the dressing and 20 seconds to open the can of tuna and about the same time to eat it. I varied the recipe slightly, as mentioned by several others who made comments, doubling the vinegar oil and capers. That made more dressing than was necessary but I think it would have been a little "dry" for me if I hadn't so maybe somewhere in the middle. Anyway I had no fresh garlic as we used all the remaining last night and I didn't want to mess with a trip to the store, so i used a teaspoon of granulated garlic powder and I also added 2 tsp. of a creole seasoning mix (Emeril's Essence) that I keep on hand and use in place of salt. And of course a can of albacore tuna. Excellent

Let it sit 2-4 hours before you serve it, definitely! The cabbage gets mellower as it marinates in the dressing. I also added finely sliced red onions. Use a bread knife to cut the cabbage finely if you don't have a food processor -- trying to chop it won't get it thin enough. It's easy if you cut it into quarters, and then shave off slices with the knife.

I agree that the cabbage has to be very finely shredded.A couple of hours at room temp.between preparation and serving brings out the flavor.I found the amounts of oil & vinegar to be just right,but like salt and pepper they can be adjusted to taste.It added lovely color and a pleasant crunch beside grilled swordfish and potato salad.

I agree with the remarks below from Durham, NC. Double the vinegar, oil, and capers, and make it a day or two in advance so the flavors have time to meld and the shredded cabbage is less "cabbagey". It was a wonderful recipe as modified above, and it was especially delicious 2 days later!

VERY disappointing. I followed the recipe exactly, but I would recommend the following changes: DOUBLE the amount of vinegar, DOUBLE the capers (the best part), use some salt and sugar, and shred the cabbage VERY finely. Also, allow some time for the flavors to set up. We found this to be very bland - like biting into a head of cabbage.

This dish was too cabbage-y.

This is a delicious, crunchy salad. I loved the flavors. My sister, who doesn't like raw cabbage, sauteed half & it was just as yummy. Tastes great the next day.

A nice alternative to a green salad. It's quick and easy and looks pretty on a plate. Be sure to cover this tightly or it'll stink up the fridge!
