I was very disappointed in this cake, because it was rated so highly. I made it as directed, and this is not any better than any other chocolate cake, in fact not as good as many. If you really want to try it, make a test cake before the occasion you want to serve it at, you may well decide to serve something else.

a delicious cake! to make it easier, you can skip making the brittle and just chop up a few salty peanuts...works just as well. if a 10" cake is too much for you, a half recipe yields an 8" round...it will bake in 30-35 minutes instead of 45.

I made this for a Latin-themed dinner party last night. It was delicious and got rave reviews from my guests. I had no problem baking it. The recommended times were perfect. Only change I made was I had to use sour cream instead of whole milk yogurt and added a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. I served it with Cinnamon Rum Ice Cream (also from this site). I couldn't find Dulce de Leche and didn't want to fuss with making it so I purchased a jar from Williams-Sonoma. The cake is even more rich the second day around.

Mamma mia. Followed this to the letter and it is easy and delicious!

One thing I want to add is that the recipe calls for cooking the cake :25 minutes. Its still soupy at that stage. I had to cook it another :10 or :15 minutes.

This cake is fabulous and easy. I too made the hazelnut brittle on Food and Wine's website. I made the coffee extra strong, only drizzled a zig zag of the dulce de leche across the cake and than schmeared it around the outer 1/2 inch rim of the cake to hold the brittle in place. This cake takes the cake! You'll want to take a picture before letting anyone near it!

This is an excellent cake recipe. I made it for a 'boys' dinner to excellent reviews. I didn't have dulce de leche, so made my own caramel sauce and garnished with crushed Skor bars along the rim (for my teenaged crowd), instead of the hazelnut brittle. The caramel keeps the cake very moist. Even after a couple of days, the cake was really yummy.

Just go ahead and bake this! I made it for my fiance's 1st of 2 birthday cakes, and everybody om-nom-nomed it. This was my first cake in a 10" pan. One hugely important tip that I learned in minutes 45-70 of continued, increasingly-panicked baking--cake pans 10" or larger need some sort of heating core for the center to cook evenly with the top and sides. Now I know. Get yourself a flower nail for the center before you start this cake. Despite the significant overbaking that mine required to set the center, the cake was perfectly moist, dense and rich. A testament to how resilient this batter is. I used Valrhona cocoa for the batter and the pan prep, David Lebovitz' super easy dulce de leche recipe, and a different hazelnut brittle recipe from Food & Wine. Happy Baking!

I've made this cake twice in less than 7 days it is so good. I think this is the only cake I've actually looked for an excuse to make. It is that perfect combination of rich, moist and flavourful that most cakes lack. The dulce de leche and toasted hazelnuts make this an almost perfect dessert for the dark chocolate lover. I say almost perfect because I found I had a lot of brittle left over after dusting the cake. I think it would have been far too sweet if I'd used it all.

I'm an experienced baker and this is an exceptional cake! Incredible flavor with interesting flavor counterpoints- love the sweet, salty, caramel-y flavors. Use the full amount of kosher salt, and top with the Dulce de leche and brittle when ready to serve. We reserved part of the brittle to top each slice upon serving- best to reserve some for leftovers as brittle on the cake top loses part of its crunch. Highly recommend!

This was OK. Definitely moist but not very chocolatey tasting. I followed redreba's suggestion for the dulce de leche and it turned out great. (I cooked it a little too much but thinned it with some heavy cream.) The brittle recipe did not work at all (too much butter) and I ditched that batch and used the old-fashioned peanut brittle recipe from this site instead. The cake took about 10-12 minutes longer to bake than suggested by the directions.

This is, truly, the most moist, chocolate cake - I can't seem to go back to any of my old stand-bys after I found this one - and you certainly don't need to use the dulce de leche (IT's delicious, don't get me wrong)topping. The cake, by itself, is just SO good and very easy to make!

Made this for my husband 's 40th Birthday to rave reviews! I am an experienced baker and this is one fantastic dessert. I covered the top of the cake with crunched ( not crushed) brittle- other than that we made exactly per recipe. Highly recommend!

Exellent cake. Easy to make. Watch the cooking time. The edges seem to be done before the center. I too make it with pecans. Really great flavor with the salty sweet.

I made this for the first time over the weekend for a Superbowl party. The cake is SO moist and delicious. I will use the recipe for the cake repeatedly, I'm sure. I had a hard time finding dulce de leche... so I cheated and found this funny little recipe for quickly making your own using sweetened, condensed milk. You can find it here... http://www.cookingforengineers.com/recipe/255/Dulce-de-Leche Also... I burnt the hazelnut brittle a little... so be careful with that. All in all... the cake came out wonderfully. I LOVE the salt... make sure you use kosher salt. In the future, I might try it with pecans instead of hazelnuts. I'm going to make it again in a few weeks for a party I'm hosting.
