This was good but was way too sweet made as suggested. Would cut the sugar in both the filling and topping in half next time to not over-power the peaches. Like other reviewers, I used a pre-made crust and added some cinnamon (1/2 tsp) to spice it up a bit. Will make again.

This is certainly the best peach pie recipe I've ever made. I did however add a little pinch of cinnamon and allspice which gave it the kick it needed. Every one raves every time I make it.

I love this recipe! Although I did make some changes. I used store bought crust, which was excellent. After cooking the peaches I strained them reserving the juices, and simmered the juice until it became thicker (about 10 additional minutes). I then added the peaches to the liquid with a pinch of nutmeg and a pinch of cinnamon. This created the perfect consistency.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I added a whole vanilla bean to the cream. The first time I made it, I used brown sugar for the strudel. I liked it either way. I would say though after the second and third day it had more flavor. We will diffinatly make again.

This recipe was disappointing. There are many good peach desserts, but this one was bland.

I love this pie. Friends rave about it whenever I serve it. The topping is mouth-watering, the peaches divine. The crust and filling are relatively easy to make, however I agree with the other reviewers -- the filling gets runny. To fix this, I add cornstarch and also a jar of preserved peaches so the peaches have some definition (they're mushy otherwise). Still, it's my summer favorite and tradition now.

Good, not great, but I'll definitely make it again. I accidentally used white peaches, so it didn't taste as "peachy" as I expected, but it was still good. I think I'll use less sugar in the streusel next time--it was little sweet for my taste.

Great recipe! I didn't have enough peaches so I threw some blueberries in. Also used a premade crust. I didn't have some of the problems of the other reviews, but I made sure that the sugar was 'melted' and added the peaches all at once so they didn't overcook. I also used a slotted spoon and left some of the juice in the pan. Have made it several times since!

In general I thought this pie was a waste of good peaches. I used my favorite cream cheese pastry which was great as usual, but the peaches in this were overcooked by the time you cooked them and then baked the pie. They lacked the fresh goodness that you eat peaches for. Maybe some brown sugar and spices would have livened things up a bit, but will not be making this one again.

Pie was good, but definitely runny. Took other user's advise but didn't seem to help.

This was one of the best peach pies I have ever tasted, even with a store-bought crust. Two things: like another writer, I had to add some cornstarch and water to thicken the very juicy mix and the butter in the topping should not be melted but cut into pats cold and then added to the other ingredients with a pastry blender to make it crumbly.

I have made this pie twice and both times it was a Huge hit. I bought a store bought deep dish pie crust both times. Both times the pie fell apart when it was served, no one cared cause the taste is to die for. Maybe next time I will try to make my own crust and maybe it will hold up better. In any case, this pie is a winner.

i made this pie for Father's Day, and it was a huge hit. even great as leftovers - i ate it for breakfast the next morning! i made the pie crust and it turned out ok, but probably not worth the effort when you can buy such good pre-made crusts these days!

This pie turned out delicious. I used a ready made pie crust (and a little extra whipping cream). I definitely recommend to all. One question - how many peaches did you use to make 5 lbs? I used 9 peaches myself and it turned out okay.

Yummy! Very peachy! I could have eaten the cooked peaches alone.

I agree with the other reviews in regards to the crust. Extremely difficult to work with. I even froze the pastry. I had to use a couple of tbsps of flour. Amazingly enough though the flavor and texture of the crust was great. Best peach pie I've ever had. Will make this pie again but will probably use a different crust.

I made this pie for a Memorial Day picnic and everyone loved it. I added a little cornstarch to the peach mixture to thicken the juices. I didn't have trouble with the crust falling apart like the other reviewers; however, I felt like the recipe didn't make enough dough to sufficiently cover my pie pan and create a nice edge. I too will use another crust recipe next time I make this pie, and I will definitely be making this pie again!

I made this pie in 93% humidity....and it still came out great. I adapted it a little: I didn't boil my peaches, but I did peel them (I used 12 peaches, bought 3 days ahead of time so they could ripen). I also used the pie crust recipe from the Spirited Pumpkin Pie -- even in the heat, it still was crisp and flaky.

I tried everything I know but couldn't get the crust to stay together. (It was 90 that day!) The filling had the most peach flavor of any pie that I've ever tasted. Topping was good. Will make this ofter, with my own crust.
