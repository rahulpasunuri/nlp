I used Organic Valley heavy cream instead of half and half. I served it over brownies with vanilla ice cream and it was amazing! I tend to stay away from corn syrup for health reasons, so I was happy to find this recipe!

This sauce has a nice flavor and is fast and easy to make, and I would use it again IF I were cooking for someone who had to avoid corn syrup (e.g., for allergies) or I wanted a quick sauce and had no corn syrup in the house. However, the March 2005 Hot Fudge sauce recipe at this site, which uses corn syrup instead of butter, has a much better texture, especially when chilled and reheated. This one has to be reheated extremely carefully as even a few seconds too long will cause the butter to separate out and be impossible to reincorporate. The other one is a bit deeper in chocolate flavor, too, though, as written, it is also a bit sweeter which some may not prefer.

This was an easy recipe, although I mistaked using whole milk- I didnt have half and half. It seemed VERY thin when I stirred the chocolate in, and then I stuck it in the fridge to chill for about 10 minutes to see if it would make a difference. However, it didnt so I waited a little bit longer, till it was slightly warm, and it had thickened slightly... it tasted REALLY good cuz i used some german chocolate(the more inexpensive kind to cook it with. I poured it over my icecream with wipped cream ontop, and it got a little bit chewy, which was good :)

This is one of the easiest hot fudge recipes I've found. A group of us worked together on brownies with hot fudge, but we couldn't find corn syrup, which made this recipe even better! We ended up using 10 fl. oz. of double cream instead of a cup of half and half, but the end result was really wonderful. Since the fudge was going over brownies, it didn't need to be particularly sweet (which was good, considering that we used too much cream), and the texture was wonderful.

Made it for my husbands birthday! Very easy and deliciouse. I used good quality milk chocolate chips and didn't have half and half so I used heavy cream instead. I liked this recipe better then others because of the simplisity, no corn syrup needed!

With this fast and easy recipe, no one should ever use pre-processed fudge sauce again. Home made is just so much better! Do use the best possible quality chocolate. Belgian-made Cote d'Or Noir (dark) (with the elephant) is fabulous.

I made this to go over pound cake for a birthday at work. Everyone loved it, but me. I thought it was too thin and could have been sweater (duh, no added sugar)!
