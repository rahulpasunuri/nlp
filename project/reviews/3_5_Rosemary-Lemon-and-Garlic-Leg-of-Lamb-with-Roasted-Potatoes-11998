Not so special. It was ok, perhaps it was the cut of meat? but it just didn't taste overwhelmingly of lamb. Somewhat tasteless. Still ok, but don't think I would make the recipe again. All at the table felt the same way.

Made this for Thanksgiving this year - I wanted something a little different from the "usual" roast leg of lamb - it turned out great! The lemon flavour added a new dimension and my husband, a Kiwi who grew up with lamb for Sunday dinners, loved this! I cooked it longer than usual as both my husband and I prefer lamb well done (2.8kg for 3.5 hours) and I even accomplished the "crackling" my husband loves so much! One comment I would add is to make sure you use NZ spring lamb - it really makes a difference what type of grass it grazes on - and I find the taste to be far superior to Canadian or Australian lamb.

My father-in-law, the food critic LOVED this. The meat was perfect, the potatoes were great.

I thought the recipe worked out well. Not the best lamb I've ever had, but certainly a fine recipe for a weekend dinner. I thought the lemon flavor was excellent with the potatos - used russets cut into wedges instead and cooked them the full time with the lamb.

I toned down the lemon and threw in a few extra garlic gloves. Delicous. If using grass- fed lamb, reduce cooking time by at least a half hour and reduce the heat halfway through.

I have made this dish countless times and it has always been a major hit. Our guests have loved the lemon-flavored potatoes and the lamb is sensational.

This was a mistake! Don't get me wrong, it was edible but NEVER again. I love lemon and thought that I would like the flavor of lemon with the lamb and potatoes but it was just not right. I would cook it again but totally leave out the lemon. Potatoes were NOT meant to have lemon flavor! Rosemary...yes, Garlic....yes... Lemon...No!

Tastiest lamb that I have ever, ever made. The lemon on the bottom added a delightful taste to the gravy. To extend the gravy I use a can of chicken broth. The potatoes were wonderful. Can't say enough beyond good and easy.

I would make this again but I would either brown the leg in the pan prior to placing in the oven or I or would increase the cooking temp. to help brown the leg. I prepared a five and a half pound leg following the recipe and cooked it at the suggested time and temp. and it did not brown sufficently enough on the outside. I do agree with the review that suggested cooking the leg on the bbq that sounds excellent.

Very simple and good recipe. Potatoes came out nice, but you may want to watch the amount of salt and lemon. The potatoes soak those flavors up more than the lamb does.

This was good, but not great. I've had much better lamb recipes. Probably won't do it again.

I don't like lamb, but made this dish for my husband, because he loves it. I found this to be an excellent recipe, one thing I don't like about lamb is the taste and smell while it is cooking. Not a problem here, no oders except the garlic, and the taste was out standing. I would diffently try it again. I did cut down on the rosemary as others have suggested, but left everything else the same. The potatoes were excellent also. Served with caesar salad, the red potatoes, and aspargus. Great.

This was quite wonderful. I agree with various comments on the "heaviness of the rosemary and the lemon." THUS, I cut down on the amounts, and this was a delicious dinner. I had large red potatoes, which i cut into eighths, and it worked just as well. Served with fresh buttered asparagus, sliced yellow and red tomatoes with a light olive oil, pepper and salt dressing this was a wonderful springtime dinner. The baklava for dessert was the final "zing" for a Greek type of Mediterranean dinner. TRY IT, and see if you agree!

Just Great! I made it for Easter dinner and my family raved about it. I like the lemon flavor in the vegetables, but wasn't fond of the strong rosemarry flavor. Next time I will back off on it a little.

I cooked the lamb on the bbq, as that is how we prefer our lamb. The marinate is perfect for this method of cooking.

Delicious. Easy. However, vegetables took on a very lemony taste. Would make again.
