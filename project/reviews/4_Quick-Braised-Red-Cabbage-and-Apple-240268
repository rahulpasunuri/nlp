I made this for our German food themed gourmet dinner group party. I doubled the recipe as it was but found it rather bland. I added sugar to taste, a bit more salt, an extra apple and Red Apple Balsamic vinegar. I also simmered on extra low so the flavors had a chance to develop. Everyone loved it. Served with Brisket braised in Porter and German fried potatoes.

So delicious in winter! However, next time I make it I will add the apples after the cabbage has cooked for a bit. They were a touch too mushy.

Pretty darn tasty! The caraway seeds really gave this dish the little extra something it needed...don't forgo the cider either!

Made this last night as part of our New Year's day dinner. Beautiful colour and flavor. Non cabbage eaters thought it was very good too. Served it with rosemary & dijon leg of lamb, roasted potatoes, roasted carrots and sweet onions. Wonderful way to start the year!

This recipe tasted amazing. I wish I had made more. We served it at Christmas dinner and it was a hit. All I would say is that it took a little longer to cook than the recipe calls for but other then that exceptional. Cook more like 40 minutes and add the apples towards the end so they don't go too mushy.

I served this with the pretzel crusted pork chop with mustard cream sauce recipe off this site and it was DIVINE! One change I made was to add four pieces of cooked, crumbled bacon to the pot when you add the cabbage

Excellent! The first time, I made it with apple juice since it was all I had, and I would have rated it at 3 forks. The cider makes all the difference in depth of flavor. I suspect it would be good with a little boiled cider, if fresh isn't available... King Arthur Flour carries it, and it's quite good.

I didn't love this as much as other reviewers but it was pretty good. I made 2 substitutes, green for red cabbage and apple juice for cider so maybe that made a difference. I held off until the last 10 min before I put the apples in so they wouldn't turn to mush but they were still pretty soft anyway. Served it as a side to potato pierogies.

Even the 15 year old enjoyed this dish. It did not taste like cabbage, the apples mellowed the taste and smell. I used one head of cabbage and it was overflowing my pan and made more than we could eat, for us 1/2 a head of cabbage would have been just right.

Amazing and delicious! Couldn't find any caraway seeds this time but will try again. The depth of apple flavor is impressive.

I added additional caraway and allspice halfway through the braising time because it was not terribly aromatic. I also salted the dish at the same time. Served it with spiced pecans and it was quite good.

A very good dish that is different from the usual side. I tasted it when it was almost cooked and thought it was just okay, but adding the cider vinegar at the end (along with a pinch of sugar) really made it all come together.

I made this as written - it was very good! Like the previous cook we had the dish with chicken sausage and roasted potatoes.

Excellent side dish. We skipped the caraway seeds and used sparkling cider instead of unfiltered cider. Paired wonderfully with organic apple chicken sausages which complemented the apple and salty roasted potatoes which served as a nice poil to this recipe's sweetness.

this was quite good! and i'm not a big fan of cabbage. it was really easy to make though it did take a little bit longer than the estimated time. i'll probably use less caraway next time i make it but i'm sure i'll be making it again soon.

Had a bumper crop of red cabbage but no wine on hand so I tried this recipe and found it to be quite delicious.
