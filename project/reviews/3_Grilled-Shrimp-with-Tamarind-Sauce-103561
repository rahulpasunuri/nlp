I made this one night when I needed a quick dinner. I used salmon instead of shrimp and steamed it over spinach leaves with sea salt and cracked pepper on top. When it was close to done I flipped in down into the pan with sauce and finished it off...it was wonderful! I did not have the hot sricha sauce so I used sambukol chili paste, and I did not have cilantro root so I used cilantro...YUM! My husband loved it also!

Delicious recipe and really easy to make. I used frozen tamarind pulp ("La Fe" brand). It costs next to nothing and I also use it in smoothies.

We found the sauce to be delicious. I used slightly less fish sauce, as I always do, and it provided it's usual pungent background flavor. I use a tad more tamarind and have never found the solid, so I use a ready made paste. Only thing we don't care for is the awkwardness of getting the shrimp out of the shells.

Sauce was not good at first so I used 2 teaspoons of fish sauce and all the tamarind juice. Make sure to cook until the fishy taste is gone (about 5 min). Good taste- 3 forks.

I will never make this one again! The sauce was 100% inedible. Even the smell was terrible. The taste of fish sauce was waaaaaay to strong for me - and I only used half of what the recipe called for. I could barely taste the tamarind. For all of you that gave high marks to this recipe: Did you wisely omit the fish sauce? Or, do you just like the taste of fish sauce? To the uninitiated....BEWARE OF FISH SAUCE!!!!!!!

Haven't tried the recipe, so I didn't rate it, but I just wanted to weigh in on the availability of ingredients - I live in a city much smaller than "Cincinnasty," and have no trouble finding these ingredients.

I don't understand the negative reviews. This sauce is delicious, and I am always looking for different ways to use up coriander root--the best part!! I have also used the sauce with things other than shrimp, such as tofu, for a change.

Very so-so.

Sublime - the sweet shrimp are complimented wonderfully by the tangy tamarind. I didn't run into any trouble finding the ingredients, but then I live in a large city...and I know how to use mail order. ;-)

Absolutely delicious and the entire article about shrimp was excellent and has prompted my first, 2 and 3 visits to an Asian Market! What fun for a senior who who has subscribed to Gourmet since its inception

Are you serious? Maybe we should sprinkle this recipe with moondust. Or perhaps travel to the planet Krypton for some extra special Kryptonite. Then we could mine it and push it through a sieve. "Pick a Peppa" makes a good Tamarind sauce. Buy it. Grill shrimp then brush on. Easier and tastier than this recipe.
