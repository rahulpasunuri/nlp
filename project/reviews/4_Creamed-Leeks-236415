Absolutely delicious! made a few changes: added half a red onion that was in my fridge and added garlic and Gruyere to the crouton topping. Will take this to Thanksgiving this year!

A crowd pleaser! I've made it several times and this recipe is now a staple of my holiday menu. Can't figure out why it calls for 2 cups of bread crumbs, though - I normally use only half as much and it still seems like a lot.

LOVE this recipe - simple and wonderfully delicious. Used half of a red onion that was in the fridge and leftover focaccia for the breadcrumbs and topped with parm. Will try the gruyere and the spinach as suggested above.

loved this recipe! Added garlic to the bread crumbs as suggested by another cook. Made the breadcrumbs from a few days old ciabatta bread. Also used light cream instead of the heavy cream, but definitely needed more than the recipe called for. Will defintely make again- great flavor. Served as a side dish with Fennel Rubbed Pork Loin Roast.

I make this every year for thanksgiving. I absolutely love it! Next year I will DEFINITELY try that great suggestion of adding spinach--thanks Cook from Milwaukee!! I don't bother with the parchment paper, I just cook them in a pan covered with a lid. (Make sure the leeks are really completely cooked at the frying stage, even before baking, because they can retain a little tiny bit too much crunch if they're not really cooked through at the beginning. This happened to me once.) I can vouch that the whole thing really CAN be assembled in advance, and the breadcrumbs CAN be stored in an airtight container. SO easy and delish.

Added a big bag of chopped spinach to the leeks near the end of the saute time (just enough to wilt), and topped with panko with grated bellavitano cheese grated in. Rave reviews every time!

This is my absolute favourite leek side dish recipe. Make garlic bread from sourdough bread for the topping and enjoy!

Great recipe which I've made several times to great response. I add a bit of grated Gruyere cheese to the breadcrumb topping which gives it another dimension of flavor and texture.Just use a light hand with cheese, a little goes a long way.

This has become a family tradition, some people come for dinner just because they have heard how good this dish is. I first made it in 2006 when the recipe was in Gourmet mag. I have not tried any of the additions others have used and I am not sure that I will. I have to double and triple the recipe this year I think I will use 8 lbs of leeks, wow. If you are considering making this dish do it, totally unchanged it is one of my most favorite Thanks(taking)giving dishes.

I just love these (made again for the 2nd time). A nice companion for meats or turkey The great thing about it you can do much of the work ahead of time, then assemble and pop into the oven. A great time-saver for big meals!

Just plain great will make over and over. I agree that this is just perfect the way it is, having said that I will try the garlic, and maybe flavored bread. This dish will become a family tradition, mine and all those who had dinner at our home.

I loved this dish but added a finely chopped clove of garlic to the breadcrumbs For anyone interested it works very well for passover using one piece of wholewheat matza, crumbed and treated exactly the same as the breadcrumbs

This is one to add to my collection of "The Most Perfect Recipes of All Time" It was easy to put together, tasted fabulous, looked and smelled wonderful. Even the leftovers were great.It has a pleasant balance between the silkiness of the leeks and the crispiness of the topping. Best of all, as a side dish, it complimented the main dishes as opposed to competing with them. I used a parmesan semolina loaf for the bread crumbs which was a great choice.

EVERYBODY loved this dish for thanksgiving. I also added a package of frozen pearl onions and 1/4 cup chopped sun dried tomatoes.
