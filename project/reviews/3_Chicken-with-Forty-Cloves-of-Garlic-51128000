I've made this recipe at least a thousand times. When I was a single parent, I could buy cheap chicken legs -- like five pounds of them -- make garlic chicken (which my children begged for), use the remaining chicken for chicken Tetrazzini, and turn everything that was left into soup. My only suggestion is that you take off the skin. It's tedious if you're making a lot of this, but it removes a lot of the fat and you won't feel obligated to skim it.

Made a few substitutions due to what I had on hand. Used sliced onions instead of celery and fresh thyme instead of parsley, otherwise I followed the recipe. Chicken was very moist and fell off of the bone, but came out a very unappealing white color. Put it under the broiler for @ 5 to 10 minutes to brown up the skin and that helped a lot. Be sure to have some bread to spread the roasted garlic on, otherwise that's 40 cloves that go to waste. Pretty easy and tasty. I'll try it again.
