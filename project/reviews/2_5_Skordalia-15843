Not Skordalia but very good none the less. I added parsley rather than mint and served with lamb kabobs - it was delicious.

I use 2 1/2 lbs. mashed russet potatoes, about 10-12 cloves of crushed garlic mixed with a generous pinch of salt and SLOWLY add 1 1/2 cups olive oil and about 3/4 cup fresh lemon juice, alternating the oil and juice (use the whip attachment to mixer) to the potato mixture. This one is HOT with garlic but fantastic and my Greek in-laws love it.

We make this frequently to have with lamb. Not truely a skordalia, but a nice complement to greek marinated foods. We leave out the mint, and ocassionally will add a touch of cucumber.

I absolutely love love love this!! I have made this at least 5 times and will be making it again this evening. No it's not traditional Skordalia as all the previous reviewers seemed to be so appalled by. But if you read the introduction to the recipe it definately mentions that, it says, usually made with bread or potatoes. This is just another take on it, so lighten up. Ohh and guess what? It's delicious.

This is not Skordalia. You want REAL Skordalia? Here's a recipe that I found in a cookbook that we purchased in Santorini. I've made it and it's amazing. * 6 slices thick white bread, crust removed * 4-6 cloves of garlic * Vinegar (I mixed white vinegar and apple cider vinegar half and half) * Olive oil (GREEK olive oil, not Italian or Spanish - the flavor is SO much better with Greek olive oil). Pour the vinegar over the peeled cloves of garlic. Let marinate for 3-5 hours. Soak the bread in water for 5-10 minutes. Squeeze the bread dry and put in a food processor. Add the garlic cloves and 3-5 tablespoons of vinegar. Blend to a nice consistency. Slowly add olive oil until it's a creamy paste. (No amounts were given on the vinegar or olive oil, just play with it. It's REALLY easy.) I found that if left in the fridge overnight, even the strongest skordalia becomes more mellow. So if it's too sharp, refrigerate overnight. YUM... Great with squash, zucchini, cukes, chicken or straight off the spoon!

If we all know that this is not the Skordalia that we were looking for, then can someone post their version? Especially the person living in Greece.

This was an excellent accompaniment to the excellent grilled lamb dish.

Today's New York Times has a recipe for skordalia that uses bread soaked in milk and walnuts.

As an American of Greek heritage (living in Greece) I can empathize with the other cooks as to the authenticity of the SKORDALIA. Your recipe appears closer to the "Yiaourtlou" commonly served in Greece with grilled meats, and it is certainly a delicious version. Skordalia is classically made with bread or potatoes, though my aunt from Poli (Constantinople) made it with mostly walnuts (great with seafood or fried veggies). I would certainly make this version again for grilled meats.

I don't know why they made this change to yogurt. If you make it with yogurt as directed it is Tatziki not Skordalia.

You will never find Scordalia in Greece made of yogurt! Use bread soaked in water and then squeeze the water out. Avoid using fresh bread. It stays more solid in the water if the bread is not fresh. Also in Scordalia we use vinegar and not lemon juice. Don't mix everything at once. Put your bread in a big bowl and according to taste, add the rest of your ingredients. Some people like strong scordalia and add more garlic and some prefer it lighter in which case you should use less garlic.

My Greek Grandmother would role over in her grave if she saw or tasted this recipe for Skordalia. Any chance of getting a more authentic recipe on the web? And not one with potatoes, but one with bread, as the primary filling component.

It was a good accent for the lamb. I would also use it on sandwiches and salads. My brother-in-law thought the "hot" was horseradish, so I would suggest making it ahead to let the garlic mellow.

Skordalia is a dish made of potatoes, garlic and olive oil (dash of salt). What is this?
