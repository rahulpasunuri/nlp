This is one of my all time fav recipes --I make this to herald fall in New Orleans. The Aioli is crucial. I love the orange & concur fresh bay needs the orange. I tend to use more shell/seafood than fish just as a preference. I either use a homemade shell or fish stock and make the Aioli a few days ahead. I also use the Aoili recipe for others (hatch chili season etc.) I work on the premise of the effort one puts into a recipe is equal to the outcome.

I love this soup and have made it for guests many times. The day prior, you can prepare the fish stock and early in the day of, I prepare the soup base, aioli (and the bread/ rosemary fougasse which was part of the original Bon Appetit menu) leaving only the fish to be added minutes before serving. I think the orange is important as the flavor is working with the bay leaves. I have fresh bay in my yard, so it is potent and needs the orange to round it. The aioli recipe make A LOT with the 2 cups of olive oil, so I half it. I highly recommend the Lemon and Rosemary Fougasse made with all semolina, too.

Great soup alternative to traditional cream-based chowders. Made with fish stock and rockfish, and no orange peel as several reviewers did not like the taste. I did not make the aioli and planned to substitute mayo with diced garlic added, however I ran out of mayo! Final aioli substitute: 3/4 cup of regular mayo, 2 diced garlic cloves, and the remainder was made up of jarred tarragon Bearnaise. (My pantry came through in the clutch...)

Agreed, the orange zest is extraneous. In addition to adding a bit of saffron to the stew itself, add a splash or two of Pernod. This will build the flavor profile, like sherry does, but in keeping with the Provencal flavors. Of course, one must serve toasted bread on the side! Slice an artisinal loaf thinly, season with an olive oil and toast to crispness. I don't need the egg yolks as thickener because I make my own stock using halibut bones, skin, etc, r. Find a hands-on seafood purveyor and they will be happy to freeze fish carcass for you. I throw the lot in with 2/3 water 1/3 white wine and slow cook for 3 or 4 hours. Don't salt you stock! Become accustomed to the purity of the flavors. I don't like chervil, instead I create a mild topping of finely minced scallion, parsley, lemon zest and shallot.

I don't want to rate this as I'm probably not the best judge. I used a homemade whitefish stock for this recipe and ended up feeling that the dish tasted too fishy for my preferences. I tend to like lightly flavored white fishes such as cod and not like stronger tasting fishes such as salmon or tuna, so this recipe was probably not a wise choice for me. It wasn't a loss, though: I can't bear to waste food and I knew that the stock was the part that was overwhelmingly fishy to me, so I drained the stock, added about a cup of flour and two eggs to the veggie/fish mixture, and fried spoonfuls up in olive oil to make fish cakes. I served them on slices of buttermilk bread with a drop of mayonnaise and was delighted with the results. I'll be making this recipe again just so I can make the delicious fish cakes again! As fish cakes this recipe made enough to serve 6-8.

I've made this twice now. First time as is and though it was enjoyed by all, I felt I should tweak a bit to make it like the classic bourride I tried years ago. MORE GARLIC! No orange peel and I received rave reviews from my dinner guests. Living in the pacific north west, I also used halibut and spot prawns as the protein. Sublime. Will amke again and again.

This didn't work out for me. The orange zest seemed like it didn't work with the dish. Disappointing, because I'm trying to get more fish in my diet.

This was a delicious hearty stew. I do think if I made it again I'd like a bit more liquid. There seemed to be hardly any. I served the rest of the aioli on the side with crusty bread as suggested and it was a hit.

To the reviewer who asked about the aioli, simply click on "Lemon aioli" and you'll be directed to the recipe for it. Bon chance!

I haven't made this recipe yet but would like to. I find it a bit confusing - can anyone help? Which ingredients are used for the aioli?

This was delicious! The only problem I had was I made the aioli the day before, as the recipe indicates you can, but it got really runny in the fridge. It still worked fine in the recipe.

Fabulous! I made only enough aioli to thicken the stew. It is VERY rich, so we ate fresh bread w/o aioli on the side. Tastes genuinely French!
