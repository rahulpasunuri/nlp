Delicious recipe however a little time consuming. Not a good idea to layer ravioli in the water tray after boiling, the ones on the bottom stuck and broke open. Would definitly cook this again as a smaller intimate meal.

I made this recipe with fresh pasta. It turned out great. I took the advice from other chefs and substituted walnuts (didn't have hazelnuts). The flavor was good, but nothing special. I might make it again, but I'm thinking next time I'm gonna go for pumpkin filling.

I"m really only rating the filling because I made fresh pasta. Seriously good combination. I added chopped proscuitto and it really made it great. Everything comes together like a party in your mouth! I substituted walnuts for hazelnuts and I think I would do it again next time, the walnut flavor profile really worked with everything.

The flavors in this recipe are great but DO NOT use wonton skins - the flavor did not work. I served this with toasted hazelnuts, fried sage leaves, and a drizzle of olive oil and this was a nice light appetizer. With a fresh pasta, this would be perfect.

Fabulous! Our family and guests loved it: rich, flavourful and very elegant. I used fresh pasta (store bought fresh lasagna noodles) and cut them to size vs wonton wrappers. I would definitely do that again. I garnished the finished raviolis with chopped fresh sage, crumbled soft goat cheese, a small drizzle of the browned butter, the toasted hazelnuts and then a drizzle of reduced balsamic glaze as a much needed hit of acidity. Five star dining! As other reviewers have said, makes far more filling than required. One of our favourite Epicurious recipes!

This was good. I am not super patient so instead of using two wonton wrappers, made more of an agnolotti style with one wrapper folded over on the bias....then to get a nice seal, I used a crimping wheel. They looked great and very uniform and went way quicker for me. I liked the hazelnut sauce, but also added some baby arugula to the pan a couple of times (it made a lot) and loved that - it was a good match in my opinion.

We loved this recipe and I will make it again. But there was a moment in assembling them that I wondered why in the world I had decided to try this recipe. I'd like to share with you what I did after putting four together, wanting to pull my hair out, and deciding there had to be an easier way to make them than doing them one by one. I had baked the squash as directed, but next time I'd microwave it and then remove the squash from the shell as others have suggested. The real time saver for me, though, was putting them together assembly style. Won ton wrappers are not like fillo dough. They don't have to be covered and babied. So I laid two dish towels on two large cookies sheets. Then I divided the remaining wanton wrappers between each. I had an egg yolk wash in a small bowl with a spreader at the ready, and the filling in another bowl. I then dampened all four sides of all the wrappers with the egg wash, dumped a tablespoon or so of the squash mixture on each one, then covered each with the remaining wrappers. I then used a fork to firmly press down on the four sides of each one. When all were finished, I covered them with another dish towel and let them sit until I was ready to LIGHTLY simmer them. I cooked only half of the ravioli for the two of us, and the next day the remaining ones still cooked up great. Every one of them stayed together, with no leakage. The recipe makes way too much filling. I may freeze or make soup out of what's left. The hazelnut butter sauce is a must, in our opinions.

My entire family (including my "must have meat and potatoes for dinner" husband) LOVED this recipe! I misplaced the hazelnuts so I ended up not using them but I did add sage leaves to the brown butter as others had recommended. Absolutely delish! This goes in the 'keep' file!

I first tried this when I found it in the Gourmet anniversary cookbook.It is exquisite, a well-rounded panoply of distinct tastes. Interestingly, this was published as using "won ton wrappers." Don't use that, make it with your own fresh ravioli or large-shell pasta. If you want a lighter, less "French" taste, omit the brown butter. It is a rich addition but some palates might prefer this lush recipe with simpler finish.

Rating: 3
Made this filling with my own fresh pasta, and, yes, it makes way too much filling; I halved the recipe, used a shallot instead of an onion, fresh goat cheese, and skipped the heavy sauce; instead for the sauce I just used a drizzle of olive oil, some fried sage leaves, and shavings of good parmesan. toasted hazelnuts or walnuts would have been even nicer if I'd had some handy. Half the recipe was enough for at least 50 ravioli at a tsp. of filling each. be sure to salt to taste.

Rating: 4
I thought the filling flavor was outstanding and rich. I did use the aged goat cheese as recommended. But I did choose to make my own whole wheet pasta ravioli instead of using the wonton wrappers. As for the butter sauce... I would rather have just sprinkled roasted hazelnuts on top and drizzled the pasta with olive oil - the butter is too much.

Rating: 3
I wanted to like this dish so much. I followed the instructions, including the aged goat cheese, though I made my own pasta instead of using the wontons, which worked well. But there was just something about this dish that didn't "cohere." The flavors--despite all that richness--just didn't come together. The sauce is, as someone else commented, too rich and doesn't really work, even though my hazelnuts were toasted to perfection and I used wonderful butter. This dish just didn't work for me.

Rating: 4
I made a couple of changes to the recipe. I used fresh, crumbled goat cheese and I served the filling as a side dish. I got frustrated with the wonton ravioli wrappers, so I served up the filling as a side dish and made something else. This is a phenomenal way to serve butternut squash and is now a holiday staple for our family. It's easy to make and is a great option for those who don't like yams or pumpkin.

very good. Made our own ravioli dough -- added prosciutto to the filling and subbed in black walnuts, as we had some locally grown. Just a couple filled us up nicely!

I made this according to the recipe. I love the flavors of the squash, sage and (fresh) goat cheese. But the won ton wrappers just seemed too gross--translucent and slimy. Not a shortcut worth taking. If I make this again I will make my own fresh pasta instead.

Overall this was a really tasty dish! I bought fresh pasta to use instead of the won ton wrappers and it worked really well. I also used fresh goat cheese instead of aged. The hazelnut butter sauce was good but a little rich. I think next time I would prefer to use just plain olive oil with some extra sage sprinkled on top.

I loved the combination of squash and goat cheese in these ravioli. I used homemade pasta instead of the wontons and substituted walnuts for hazlenuts. I would make it again exactly the same as I did this time.

Rating: 4
This is delicious! Made a few changes. 1) Subbed ~1 Tbsp chopped fresh sage instead of dried, since I had it on hand. 2) Used ~4 oz fresh goat cheese instead of aged (easier to find). 3) Cut back the butter by about half (otherwise it's way too rich for our taste) and added some fresh sage leaves to brighten up the sauce. Since a lot of people have been having problems with the ravioli coming apart, here's a trick which I learned from my local Italian shop. Make sure the water is only simmering, not boiling. Otherwise even "real" ravioli will fall apart. I had no problems using water to seal, and my ravioli were stuffed quite fat! We will definitely be making this again - and for company, too.

We love this recipe! I made it exactly as written. The wonton wrappers worked fine. I froze half (before boiling) and do hope they won't turn into a mess when I use them, as one reviewer warned! I made the filling a day ahead; flavors married nicely.

Rating: 2
The filling has great flavor, but i added more garlic and cheese to round out the flavors. Squash can be a little too dominant. I found that a 2lb squash makes filling for closer to double the amount noted here. Therefore, I suggest getting 2 packets of the gyoza wrappers. Also, the gyoza wrappers are much thinner than normal ravioli dough, so they are prone to drying out VERY quickly, so you might want to lay a moist paper towel over the ravioli while you are filling and cooking. They seem to be almost too fragile to make it through the waterbath in one piece, so water should barely simmer and maybe use a starch wash to seal them instead of just water. Aside from minor execution problems, very tasty and the look very nice on plate. Though a little time consuming, great things to freeze!

I wanted to like this so much. We made it exactly as the recipe instructed, but we used the egg yolk (mixed with a little water) to seal the wontons. They held together fairly well - I think only two came apart. They dish looked beautiful on our plates, and the first couple of bites were even okay. However, after that I just couldn't stomach it. My husband said he didn't like the wonton wrapper encasing. I just did not like the flavor of the raviolis with the hazelnut brown butter. So, although this looked pretty, it is not worth making. I don't mind spending a lot of time preparing when the dish turns out well, but this one just didn't.

I nearly turned away from the dish because of the number of mixed reviews, and I'm sincerely glad I didn't. Despite the number of people who claimed that wonton wrappers all fell apart, not a single one of my ravioli was bad. As did previous reviewers, I took care to use egg yolk instead of water to seal, and perhaps this is what made the difference. Please note that I did not use goat cheese but substituted marscapone. I was worried there would be a "something missing"-ness, but quite frankly, nobody missed it. Finally, although fresh pasta I'm sure would add something to the dish, the thinness of the wanton was absolutely crucial to the success of the dish. It really allowed the flavors of the vegetables and spices to come out. Even my *very* vegatable averse father had seconds and admitted that he'd never had better butternut squash ravioli.

i made this using wonton wrappers without issue. i used a pastry brush to seal the pasta and then brushed the ravioli with water again after i trimmed them. i did not make the hazelnut butter, rather drizzeled this with really good olive oil and sprinkled with grated parmesan. delicious!!

Hmm. I will make this again with changes. Also note that i did not make the sauce as written. I used the wontons and really regretted it. Guess it is time to invest in a pasta maker! The filling to this was absolutely delicious. I confess i don't like sage so much. I made a sage brown butter cream sauce with some Tabasco for abit of kick. Didn't like my own creation. I will try this again with real pasta, not sure what i will do for aauce. Again, the filling rocked- i made it with a fresh organic pumpkin from a friend, yum yum yum! And i did like the sage in this part of it.

I actually changed a bunch of aspects of the ingredients to this recipe, but I have a suggestion for everyone worrying about how to enclose the raviolis. I ended up not having time to make my own pasta and couldn't find decent goyza wrappers (usually more durable than wonton) so I used pre-made pizza dough! If you have one of those ravioli presses, it's incredibly easy, quick, and works really well. I boiled each about 1 tsp-size ravioli for 2 min (in chicken broth), they puffed up only slightly from the dough, and were fabulous.

These ravioli looked ok before they went into the water, they even looked vaguely tolerable after they came out, but a plate of them sauced up reminded me of a paragraph penned by H.P. Lovecraft. I should have made these on Halloween and given them out as party favors. The filling was good. I would have put the hazelnuts inside the ravioli had I known how frightful these would end up being, just for the extra "surprise". I second the reviewers that insist on omitting the wonton wrappers for any ravioli dish. Huge mistake. Use fresh pasta.

I tried this recipe after reading a lot of the reviews. I am a student and unfortunately don't have a method or time to make pasta, so I used the wonton wrapper which worked well. I found that when I bioled them they were really soggy so instead I steamed them. It was better that way. I made the butter hazelnut sauce and found it was a really rich dish but good just the same. It did take a long time.

Rating: 2
Warning: If you make this give yourself at least 4-6 hours. By the time you roast the squash, scoop it out and stuff the won tons your patience is worn thin. I can only imagine the trouble real pasta would be. I agree with the other chefs that you should use egg yolk to seal the won tons, water just won't work the stuffing will seap out when you boil them. Once everything was made and put together the end results were delicious. I didn't have any cider so I used 1/2 cup of non-sweetened apple sauce and 1/4 cup of orange juice. The sauce turned out really tasty. I would make the sauce again to put onto store bought ravioli.

Rating: 3
I agree, partially, with the reviewer below - don't skip the onions, but cut back a bit, as they do tend to overpower the other flavors. But oh, how delicious this dish is! The pungent goat cheese sets off the delicately sweet/nutty flavors just perfectly. I've had this same dish at a four star restaurant, but I think this recipe is better! By the way, if you have the time, do use freshly made pasta instead of wonton wrappers - a dish this special deserves it.

Skip the onions. They overpower the delicate butternut, sage, and goat cheese (which are just fine on their own). The hazelnut butter sauce is fine, but I think it would be better with a sage butter sauce.

On January 2nd, 2006 there were no Hazelnuts to be found --few stores were open. I used pistaschios. Excellent!The recipe makes too much filling -- which is fine, I've frozen the remainder for another feast. We make our own pasta and used #7 and our ravioli maker. My husband, who actually eats pasta to please me, rather than loving it ate about 15 ravioli!

This dish was absolutely fabulous and very easy to prepare. I used Butternut squash puree which made it even more simple. Make your own pasta dough. This is also very easy and makes the dish beyond compare. The hazelnut butter sauce went well with the goat cheese.

This was my first time making homemade ravioli. My book club really liked this dish and got rave reviews because the flavors are sooo good, but next time I will try making it using real pasta as some other reviewers suggested. The wonton wrappers are good if you are really pressed for time, but they are chewier and slimier than pasta. (I've made empanadas with won tons which came out great but perhaps because they are deep fried). I also added cream to the butter/hazelnut sauce. It tasted good but the cream and butter didn't really blend very well - perhaps because I added the cream afterwards. The presentation didn't look too great because of this (or because of my inexperience cooking ravioli). The butter sauce is REALLY rich. Any suggestions for a less rich sauce would be great.

Rating: 4
One of my favorite fillings. Ravioli dough made with 100% semolina flour, eggs, olive oil and water in a food processor makes nice and stretchy dough to roll out by hand (or pasta maker to #5). These freeze well and impress guests as a side dish. I did mine with a sage butter sauce.

Rating: 3
This is a great recipe! I deviated from the recipe in a few ways. I used red kuri squash instead of the butternut, substituted a younger goat cheese (and used about 5 ounces), and used toasted walnuts for the butter sauce. I also used fresh pasta from a local Italian market; both plain and spinach. The spinach pasta was a delicious combination, adding just a bit of bitterness to contrast the mildly sweet filling. The filled ravioli froze well for leftovers, but there was way too much filling, even after making several dozen ravioli. I froze the leftover filling, but haven't tried thawing it yet.

I followed the recipe almost verbatim and the ravioli and hazelnut brown-butter were both excellent and worked very well together. The wonton wrappers also worked perfectly, were easy to use, and tasted great too. I've had similar ravioli in many restaurants and these are certainly comparable. The one change I made involved the hazelnuts. I chopped them in a blender for about 30 seconds until they were very finely chopped. This made for an excellent and nicely-textured sauce

THIS IS NOT A MUSHROOM RECIPE!! I do not see the word mushroom once in the recipe name or ingredients. So I don't understand why you would expect it to taste good with a 'mushroom sauce'. I mean, really, think about it. I made this recipe by the directions. It is sweet, but it was more or less what I expected for a recipe with roasted squash (which carmelizes) and hazelnuts (which are traditionally used in sweet dishes). Obviously, I would expect something more savory if I was to make a mushroom dish. BUT THIS ISN'T A MUSHROOM DISH.

I really liked this recipe, but I've never had luck with won-ton wrappers for ravioli. I made this once and put them in the freezer, and they were a disaster. The fell apart when they cooked. I've made it since, and used fresh pasta sheets, and they were great. Fresh sheets of pasta for lasagne are becoming more readily available in stores, and they work great for ravioli. I prefer to substitute fresh sage for the dried, and also shallots for all or part of the onion. I think it's a keeper, great as a starter.

I followed both the other raters' suggestions on how to roast the squash, and to make the mushroom sauce, and was very disappointed. It was a ton of work, for nothing spectacular. The filling was too sweet, and the mushroom sauce was ok, but I didn't think it was obvious that there were so many different kinds of shrooms. I may use the sauce again, and the won-ton wrappers to make ravioli, but won't make the same filling.

The filling for this is very good, I followed Katherine from Denver's suggestions for roasting the squash. However, the hazelnut-butter sauce was terrible--bland and colorless. I made it again with a mushroom-marsala sauce (http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=102670) that was fabulous with the ravioli. It was a great meal with a nice bottle of chianti.

This is a fabulous recipe, particularly for a multi-course meal. I have found you can play around quite a bit with the variety of cheeses and herbs. It also works well whether going with homemade pasta or store-bought won-ton wrappers. Homemade is best of course.

I made a few minor changes to the recipe due to the ingredients I had on hand (herbed chevre and fresh sage) with excellent results. To those cooks who have had problems with won ton wrappers -- The trick to not having them fall apart in the water is to use egg wash around the entire edge of the bottom won ton and then crimp the two wrappers together with the tines of a fork. The won ton wrappers are a good substitute for fresh pasta because they cut your preparation time in half and are a very similar dough. This recipe made six dozen for me. In this regard, a bit of advice with regard to the number of won tons: Buy double (120) the stated amount (60) of won ton wrappers -- I had half of the filling left and no more wrappers!

Rating: 3
I modified the recipe based on some suggestions made by other posters. First I used acorn squash because my grocer didn't have butternut. I substituted mascarpone for the goat cheese, and used the sage cream sauce from another Epicurious recipe. DH loved it, I thought it 'ok'. Perhaps next time I will use goat cheese, as I think the filling needed the zing that it adds.

Rating: 4
This recipe was wonderful! But I changed it. First I roasted the squash with salt, pepper and brown sugar face-up until it was brown. Then I added water into the cookie sheet and cooked it unitl it was tender. Since I live at altitude I had to increase the cooking time. I then scooped out the indsides and put them in a cuisinart with more brown sugar (to taste), goat cheese, sage and basil (all to taste). I blended until smooth. For the wrappers I made my own pasta with semonilia flour. It was very easy. Wonton wrappers are not the way to go since I did not have luck with them.

I had eaten a dish at an Italian restaurant in Uptown Minneapolis about 6 months ago...acorn squash ravioli in cream sauce with mushrooms and candied walnuts. This was the closest recipe I could find. I used canned pumpkin with wonderful results, left out the sage, used shredded asiago instead of goat cheese, and added some italian seasoning, cayenne pepper, and plenty of salt and pepper to the ravioli filling. Then I made a cream/cheese sauce with butter, flour, whipping cream, dash of nutmeg, and more grated asiago. I sauteed some shittake mushrooms, and then topped the whole thing off with candied walnuts. It was probably the most delicious dish I have ever made. I found that the wontons were just fine. Maybe not as pretty or authentic as pasta but they tasted fine. I even impressed myself with this one!

My first experience trying to make ravioli, and the wonton wrappers were a disaster. I never even got to taste the filling as the finished product was just a heaping slimy mess! The wonton wrappers are just too thin to make this work well. I don't know how other cooks could make them work. Nothing less than real pasta for me ever again! And PS., I also love many of the recipe's I've tried here!

I deviated from this recipe in a couple of ways. First of all since I don't like goat cheese that well, I used mascarpone. I also didn't pay attention to the cook from Warren, NJ. I used wonton wrappers and found them well worth the time and mess saved. They are more consistent and very easy to work with....and the taste is fine by me if not overcooked (max of 2-1/2 mins). The brown butter sauce was made with toasted pecans. My wife said these were the best ravioli she's ever had. Had more the next night using toasted pine nuts which were just as good.

I have to say that I was the toast of my dinner party when I served these delicious raviolis. The won ton wrappers worked like a charm--just remember to keep the raviolis in the boiling water for just a few minutes. I'd also recommend roasting the squash longer.

I hate to be the lone dissenting reviewer on this one since I enjoy so many wonderful recipes from Gourmet and Bon Appetit. Both magazines need to stop recommending the use of wonton or gyoza wrappers. They simply are not an acceptable substitute for genuine pasta especially for this kind of recipe. I went against my better judgement and used them and even was careful not to keep them in the boiling water for more than one minute--didn't matter, they still came out slimy and limp and difficult to dress. Frankly, the recipe seems contrived to me. All of the ingredients are all tasteful and genuine, but the combination just doesn't work. There's a reason for classic filled pasta recipes that everyone is familiar with and everytime we try to get creative with combinations such as this, it comes away disappointing and contrived. Don't bother with this one. Make real filled pasta that have withstood the test of time.

I didn't have any hazelnuts or squash on hand, so I used walnuts and canned pumpkin instead with delicious results. In fact, the canned pumpkin cut prep time to virtually nothing! This recipe is also a great foundation for experimentation like adding pignoli nuts or golden raisins to the stuffing, nutmeg to the sauce, etc. Fun!

The won ton wrappers worked great for making the ravioli. The squash stuffing needs some help, if tastes like it is missing something. I thought it was bland tasting. I also did not like how mushy they came out. We only ate a few and I froze the rest. I think I will try cooking and then crisping them up in a fry pan or even try deep frying them.

The ravioli were delicious and suprisingly easy to make with the pre-made won ton wrappers. I would suggest using a food processer or hand blender instead of a fork when trying to smooth out the butternut squash then add the onion/garlic and goat cheese. I also changed a few things in the recipe: substituted pecans for hazelnuts and used 2 tablespoons on fresh minced sage instead of the dry ground sage. For presentation and taste purposes I grated some fresh parmesan reggiano cheese and placed a few fresh sage leave on top of the ravioli before serving. I froze half of the ravioli and plan to use them in the near future. It would probably be easier to make the ravioli a day before you actually need them. Try this dish you won't be disappointed!

Baked sweet potato is a good substitute for the squash. Perhaps it's even better because the sweet potatoe is less watery. Instead of the hazelnut-butter sauce, I served this as an acompaniment to sauted pork chops. I made a pan sauce by sauteing some shallots in the pan the pork was cooked in. Then deglazed with 1/2 cup each of white wine and chicken stock. Finish the sauce with about 1 tablespoon of fresh chopped sage and then add the ravioli and some wilted spinach.
