Delicious with our dinner, and even more delicious the next morning as Bubble and Squeak.

Who would have thought that the simple addition of green onions to mashed potatoes could make such a difference? I chopped the green onions in a mini-food processor, to avoid complaints from young diners, otherwise, otherwise followed the recipe as written. It did take a bit of work to peel very hot potatoes, but the end result was delicious. I made the Champ a couple hours ahead of time, and heated as recommended in oven for 30 minutes, covered with foil, and then added butter to the hot potatoes. Worked great! Highly recommended.

YUM. I am a classic mashed potato gal (heavy cream & butter!), but this is a very nice change. I used a 5-lb bag of Yukon Gold; 2 bunches of scallions & 1 bunch chives. I pulsated the herbs in a mini-Cuisinart (separately). Used 1% milk. Followed recipe, adding chives to milk mixture during the simmer. I heated 3 cups of milk, but when it came to mashing, only added in about 1 1/2 cups. Used way more butter than called for, but we like butter :) DELICIOUS. Will reheat later tonight when I cook the corned beef & make the shredded cabbage. Now if I were only Irish ;-)

Made this last week on St. Patrick's Day (added ~ 1 cup of finely chopped kale to the green onions and milk) with Yukon Golds and got RAVE reviews! My husband, who always makes the BEST mashed potatoes on special occasions, said let's always have them this way. Delicious!

Also known as a gooey but good version of mashed potatoes. Use less milk.

Wonderful addition to a St. Pattys Day dinner served next to corn beef and cabbage. I made a triple batch several hours before the dinner then baked it in a large covered fry pan which left a brown crust on the bottom which added a little extra. Garlic powder was a nice touch. Served to a large gathering of the Sons of Norway  everyone is Irish on St. Pattys Day.

I think next time I would increase the amount of green onions, maybe even double as it was very subtle. In Ireland they use green cabbage too, when a poor starving student we used to bake the potatoes in a dish make a hollow and bake an egg on the top.

I used half and half in place of the milk, other than that followed the recipe exactly. Absolutely outstanding.

I cooked the option with peas (used 1/2 bag of frozen peas as instructed), and it was great! Even the scallions slipped by my 6yo DD, who's usually repulsed by onions - I gave them a rough chop and put them into the food processor until they were chopped very finely and didn't resemble onions! Make sure to add PLENTY of salt - I felt like I kept adding too much, but they still ended up needing some salt once on the plate, IMO. Made this with some other items the weekend before St. Patty's Day since I have more time then than during the work week.
