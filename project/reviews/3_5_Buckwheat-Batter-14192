This is a pretty good recipe. I didn't mind the flavor of the brown butter, which definitely comes through. The only change I made was to strain the batter before chilling it, as it initially came out really lumpy no matter how much I whisked.

I grew up in a house where my mother cooked good French food nightly, often crepes. I'm a professional chef and I too make crepes all the time, but I tried this recipe tonight and wish I hadn't. I've had buckwheat crepes in France and at good French restaurants in the US, and they've never been this dull or heavy. Even adding additional liquid did nothing to make the recipe better. Tomorrow's our anniversary, and I wanted to prep the crepes for the dinner I'll be making. Now I'm glad I did, so I have time to make another batch of crepes with my usual recipe.

I made this last night, using soy milk and with half the butter called for. Came out perfectly and is part of our regular dinner "rotation". I filled the crepes with gruyere and a mix of sauteed mushrooms, onion, garlic and spinach. The buckwheat gives a wonderfully earthy flavor. We plan to try a sweet version next time with fruit.

Great recipe, I found it too thick but don't be afraid to add more milk it won't screw up the recipe. I saute leeks and mushrooms, a little heavy cream, grated gruyere before folding, it was very nice. I made extra crepes with the left over batter. After letting them cool completely, I piled them up with a sheet of foil in between each one of them, they freeze very nicely. I warm them up in a toaster oven with foil on top to protect from drying out. I had lunch done in no time.

Good recipe, although I found the taste of butter to be slightly too strong. I made them with whole wheat pastry flour, and stone ground buckwheat flour, and served them with molasses for a hearty breakfast. And despite being a bit dense (which is to be expected), if you spread the batter in the pan with your spoon/ladle using swirling motions, you can get them pretty thin.

These crepes are heartier than those made with white flour, but they still have a tender delicate quality. The buckwheat makes them a bit sturdier and they beg to be filled with flavorful tidbits of things. I recently wrapped up some roasted turkey bacon with a dab of homemade apricot jam and cut them in half for a pot-luck brunch. Regarding the batter being too thick, I solved that problem right away by turning down the heat a little more toward medium. I used an 8-inch crepe pan and swirled the batter around... they were ready to be flipped quickly and are very easy to work with being a bit sturdier than crepes made with delicate white flour. They also keep nicely for a few days in the fridge with or without plastic wrap between them.

I love the earthy taste of these crepes. I didn't have any problem with the batter being too thick, and I used a french crepe pan. I usually put a very finely sliced piece or two of ham and a sprinkle of whatever cheese is handy; cheddar, provolone, gruyere all work very well. Then they can be folded in half, and folded again, or just rolled. And we like them with a bit of warm molasses for a terrific breakfast!

My rating is contingent upon modifying the recipe! The batter was far too thick to produce a good crépe. Adding at least an eighth of a cup of water (be unafraid to use a little more if you know what consistency such a batter should have)produced a better Breton-style crépe. Also, let the batter stand longer, Jacques and Julia recommend at least 2 hours and I agree. The batter was even better the next day when we used the leftovers for lunch.

Very good taste and texture. Cut salt to 1/4 tsp and use whole milk. And don't overbeat batter (tough crepes). Perfect filled with classic ham and cheese. Or try our favourite - wild mushrooms, gruyere and a drizzle of truffle oil!
