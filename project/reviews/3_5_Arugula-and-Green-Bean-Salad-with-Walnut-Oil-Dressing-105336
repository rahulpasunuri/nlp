Delicious but you must use the walnut oil! Nice because it is really easy to make.

I only cooked the green beans for 3 minutes and then immersed them in ice water immediately. Then I drained and dried them before chilling them for a couple hours. Walnut oil is smooth and fabulous. I am sure olive oil works but I'd go for walnut myself. I used Orange Muscat Champagne Vinegar from Trader Joe's. Next time, I'd up the amount of vinegar a bit for some extra flavor. Eggs were farm-fresh with giant orange yolks -- quality matters when you have so few ingredients. I would add some super-crisp bacon to this recipe, to jazz it up. This is a nice-looking salad -- good for serving to guests. Also makes a good light summer meal with some bread and gazpacho on the side.

I made this for lunch for two. I used walnut oil and chopped walnuts as suggested. Made a very satisfying lunch.

Yum. A regular at our home. Also, this recipe is a mother-in-law pleaser. She's made it herself to entertain guests. I've been wanting to try it with anchovies, which are great with green beans and eggs as in salade nicoise but on second thought might be very odd with walnut oil.

Excellent for a picnic

Since I never have walnut oil, I add toasted walnuts along with a sprinking of blue cheese.

This is a great salad. Perfect just the way it is -- I've even served it without the eggs (just beans and arugula and dressing) to rave reviews from my guests. Of course, given the simplicity of the dish, the quality of the ingredients is critical.

I bought walnut oil at a flea market and didn't know what to do with it. Wonderful combination of flavors! I also added toasted walnuts to the recipe, and chilled the salad for a couple of hours to blend the flavors.

This was awesome! I couldn't find arugula alone so I used a mixed baby greens. It was VERY good!

Very fast and easy. Fresh! A bit out of the ordinary. I think I will add this to my staple salad list especially in summer when the arugula is out of the garden.

I had macadamia nut oil and mixed baby spinach leaves with my garden arugula. We enjoyed this as a side to the tuna, tomatoe and caper spaghetti. On it's own, it could use the previous reviewer's suggestions, but with the spaghetti, it is very pleasant as is.

Prepared the salad according to the directions and found it incredibly bland. So I doctored it up some by mixing in some baby spinach, toasted walnuts, goat cheese and plenty of S & P. Was MUCH better...very earthy. My husband liked it very much.
