These are good. I tried them with both red skinned & russets; be sure to use the red skinned. I also cut the larger ones into halves or quarters to saute, and that gave much more golden brown surface area, which we liked better than leaving them whole and just browning the skins.

Made this the other night as a side dish to porterhouse steaks. Delicious. Added some extra herbs (basil and chives) since I had them on hand. Also good for breakfast the next day, reheated with a bit of onion.

I only like very small new potatoes boiled and then served with butter and parsley. So, I had some largish new potatoes and decided to try this technique. I quartered them, left the skins on and boiled them. I then sauteed them in butter. We loved them, very nice crispy texture and the fresh parsley was a nice addition. Nice change of pace, sort of a combination of boiled potatoes and hash browns. Good with other more strongly flavored dishes.

Extremely easy to make and delicious! Served it as a side dish for New Year's Eve dinner and it was a huge it. Many asked for the recipe and couldn't believe how easy it was to make. I think the key is getting very small new potatoes. They're creamier than the bigger ones. Would definitely make again.
