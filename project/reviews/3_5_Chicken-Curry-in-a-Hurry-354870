This curry is a great go-to weeknight dinner that I will definitely keep in my books. I made it exactly as the recipe said EXCEPT I cooked it in a pot instead of a pan and let the curry boil with the chicken in it for about 1.5 hours, so that the chicken was nearly falling off the bone. Very good!! Not spicy at all, so I will probably add some hot peppers or hot sauce next time because I prefer spicy indian food.

Loving this recipe so much! I made it at my grandmas house. The combination of recipes goes well with each other and the taste is certainly admirable. www.gourmandia.ca and www.coffeefashion .com also have interesting recipes that youll surely want to try!

I was making this for a lunch potluck, so instead of the whole chicken pieces I used pieces of cut up boneless breast, which of course didn't need as long to brown. I did not use a processor - just mix the curry up in a bowl. Mine was so juicy that I would saute the onions first next time. After adding the tomatoes and simmering, I mixed the chicken back in and stored it in the fridge overnite. The next day I put it in a crockpot, added about a cup of water and let it cook on low for 4 hours. Served it with rice. Everyone loved it, even those that don't like spicy food - but it still has a kick to it. I had several requests for the recipe. Delicious!

This is one of my go-to weeknight recipes. It's very flavorful and easy to make. To cut time, I used the pre-minced ginger (the kind in a tube) and it turns out fine. I usually serve it over couscous. I love this recipe.

Oh and forgot, I didn't bother to food process the pate, just blended it together. Maybe the point was to eally mash up the ginger, I just minced it really tiny.

Great fast curry. I didn't have white wine vinegar so I used red and it came out fine. Also substituted mulchi curry for cardamom. I'm a single guy so 3 pounds of bird is a bit much for a dinner, I pretty much thirded the recipe and cooked it with a pound of chicken breasts. Definitely would make again. If I keep a little pataks on hand it can be a dinner in a pinch any time.

Way too much ginger, it overpowered the dish. Also it was a lot more time and work than it looks like; definitely not a quick and easy recipe.

This is good and tasty. Sure, it's not really authentic Indian, but it doesn't claim to be either. It claims to be curry in a hurry; and that's what it is. Not life-changing, but fast and easy to make after work. Added cayenne pepper for more heat and served over basmati rice. Good times.

Yum! this was a extremely fast yummy curry. I put in some coriander seeds as well and less tomato, since I wanted less zing and a more creamy texture. I also added some salt and chillies. I'll definitely make this again since it was delicious and FAST.

Quick and Easy for sure. Used skinless, boneless chicken breasts, omitted cilantro and didn't see any use for food processing the paste and spices, so just mixed them in a bowl and added the chicken. I served over Jasmin rice and the only thing that seems missing is some vegetables.

a worthwhile addition to any curry is a quantity of fenugreek leaves

The recipe sadly isnt indian or Anglo Indian, if anything its a western take on indian food which is bland. I actually made the recipe "a cook from India" posted below, I didnt have the cardomen pods or the cloves but i followed everything else to the T. It is the exact replica of the dish i eat at the flavour of India restaurant! I LOVE IT. oh but i added 2 table spoons of real Indian curry I bought from the market.

To A Cook from india: Thank you for what looks like a full-flavored curry that is relatively quick wot make. I just hope you see this. It would be so nice if you could please clarify a few things for this cook. 1. What is the quantity of tomato puree that you use? 2. Also, what quantity of chicken do you use? I can hardly wait to try your recipe. Thank you, again!

This is probably the biggest disappointment of any recipe I've made from epicurious. It was so bad it's hard to pinpoint exactly what the problem was and would be better to just start with a good recipe. Even my husband scraped it into the trash after a few bites, and I've never seen him do that.

This was really good for quick dinner. I thought the canned tomatoes fit in just fine. I used Patak's Madras curry paste, which made it a bit spicier probably but very edible, and I added a can of garbanzo beans to stretch the meal a bit.

I liked this dish - it was quick and flavorful. Have I had better curries - sure. But rating this particular recipe - I thought it fit the bill for a quick weeknight dinner. I made the recipe exactly except I forgot the cilantro and used boneless chicken breasts. I didn't have to cook the chicken as long, but I did simmer until the juice from the tomatoes had thickened. Pretty good.

I thought this dish was really yummy and would go over well with family members that don't appreciate spicy food. Let me say that I DID read the reviews here before making the dish. Consequently, I did things slightly differently: 1.) I marinated the chicken in the spice paste for 5 -6 hours. 2.) I used chicken thighs (boneless and skinless) for simplicity. 3.) I pain painstakingly shelled whole Cardamoms with care and ground them in my mortar & pestle, because I didn't have the pre-ground version. I believe this improved the spice's flavor in the dish. 4.)I used fresh chopped tomatoes from my garden instead of the canned version. 5.) Lastly, we forgot to add the chopped fresh cilantro, bummer! But the dish was wonderful anyway. I always feel that food should not be so spicy hot that you cannot taste the other flavors in it. This entree fits that category. If you want your food hotter, you can always add more spice, but you can't subtract it. In my opinion, this meal had heat, but you could still taste the other ingredients. I'll make it again, definitely!

This meal was okay. I was really in the mood for Indian food, but this recipe did not live up to my expectations. I used the Patak curry that the recipe recommends, but I think the tomatoes just ended up watering the whole recipe down. Next time I would just cook the chicken and onions and add the curry in at the end. Marinating the chicken might be a better idea also.

Curry varies so much-everyone has their idea of how it should be. You just can't look for a single recipe, Nor can you really say one is better than another on any absolute scale. It all comes down to preference, and frankly you should not care about strangers' personal opinions--unless you resemble a lemming (which are quite tasty when lightly sauteed)!

Going along with the previous users comment, I've come across a great curry chicken recipe from another online recipe page. The total time from start to finish is only 40 minutes and there are a lot less ingredients...which makes it so much simpler...but still delish! Here is the link to the curry chicken recipe: http://youchef.ca/recipe/show/Easy-Curry-Chicken Also, that website has curry recipes for curried tomatoes and curried beef! These are also very delicious!

an even better chicken curry is the Gourmet Feb 2007 Chicken curry with okra. Awesome and so easy. People lick it out of the bowl. And by people, I mean me. But others, too...

YUM, YUM,YUM! Great recipe! Make this. Minimal effort with outstanding results. I followed the recipe exactly. I was not sure if DH would find it too spicy, but he loved it. It has a kick without "after burn." The garnish of chopped cilantro adds a fresh spike of flavor and color. I served it with brown Basmati rice and a vegetable mix of peas and julienne carrots. This recipe is a keeper.
