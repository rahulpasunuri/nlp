I am reviewing this a second time and adjusting my review upward. With a couple of further adjustments, we've become completely addicted to this for shrimp dip (for some reason, the shrimp calms the habanero), fish cakes (instead of tarter sauce), sandwich spread (especially good on ham sandwiches), a dip for crudite and pita chips, and as a condiment for baked fish. The trick is allow the all of the vegetable flavors to come through with just enough habanero flavor. I now roast the vegetables in a smaller shallow baking dish so the juices don't evaporate entirely. After roasting is complete, I remove the habanero entirely because the remaining mixture is pretty spicy. I double vegetables and use 50-50 mayo to greek yogurt. Try it - you'll like it!

If you don't like spicy food, this would be good without the habenero or using a milder chile. I've made this twice now and I will make it regularly since it's nice to have around to perk up leftovers, broiled fish, or as a sandwich spread. The Aioli keeps for a couple of weeks in the fridge and it's pretty easy. I followed the recipe exactly the first time except I cut the mayo with 1/3 greek yogurt. Also, I kept the skins from the vegetables. On the second try I made the following adjustments: 1)Used 50-50 yogurt to mayo 2) cut the total mayo/yogurt mixture to 1 cup. 3) roasted the garlic with the other vegetables.

This was delicious as a veggie dip. Yes, it's alot more work than mixing a packet of instant french onion soup into some sour cream, but soooo delicious. Would make a great accompaniment to fish or chicken or roasted veggies. But next time I make it as a dip I will try returning the dip to the food processor after adding the roasted vegetables to make a slightly smoother consistency.
