Chopped all of the ingredients the day before and placed them in ziploc bags with towels to absorb the liquids. When assembled and served, our guests raved about the freshness of the salad, the crunchy texture of the watermelon and cucumber juxtaposed with the softness and tastiness of home grown August tomatoes was refreshing and different!

This is a nice, fresh tasting side salad, especially for summer. I added rice wine vinegar and upped the basil so it wouldn't be bland.

This was terrible. A waste of watermelon and tomatoes.

Good change-of-pace salad, but even better if you add some balsamic vinegar.
