DELICIOUS!! I can't cut them because they are falling off the bone as I touch them. My husband thinks I'm a genius!! Nothing needs to be altered in this recipe. Yummmmmmmmy!!

Disappointing 3-4 hours in a low oven is my usual method of cooking ribs. They turned out tender. My problem was the sauce. It was heavy and completely overwhelmed the meat. When I use the second half of the marinade, I will put a small amount on the ribs before they go into the oven so that the meat has some flavour and then I will use a much thinner coat on the outside at the end. I doubt I will make this again, but if I did, I would reduce the balsamic first. I used the cheapest available and the fumes were harsh right to the end. It wasn't bad on the ribs, but the smell as I was basting put me off a bit.

Loved the way the slow-cooked ribs turned out. Was iffy on glaze. Think it might work well with bottled BBQ sauce, and much easier.

This was my first time making ribs and I didn't have any beer,but they still turned out well,but next time I will get the beer because it would have rounded the glaze out nicely. I also halved the recipe because I only had 2 racks. These turned out great! Can't wait to try these in the summer for the grill.

These were delicious. Followed recipe exactly. Meat was falling off the bones, sauce was delicious and the thyme was an interesting contrast with the sauce (although i think it was a little too much thyme - if i did it again, I'd cut back by a third). The recipe makes a lot of sauce, you could cut it by half and still have plenty for brushing and to serve alongside, but we are looking forward to using the leftover.

Tried this on ribs and it is delicious. Followed the recipe exactly. Just the sticky delicious coating I had been looking for. Have just used the last of the marinade on chicken nibbles. Fantastic! A really good balance of sweet, heat, and sharp.

I'd be afraid to try this with my good ribs! To those who try the recipe, please tell me how it comes out! Tim

Responding to krsteiner, to cook meat safely it should reach an internal temperature of at least 165, so 250 over 3 to 4 hours should be fine.

long, low and slow is the mantra of smoking/bbq for that fall off the bone tenderness!

It sounds wonderful and I'm going to try it, but I'm responding to krsteiner's question about cooking meat at 250. As long as "boiling" is 212, 250 will cook meat beautifully over a long period. Long and low. That's the way ribs should be!

Is it safe to cook meat at 250 degrees?
