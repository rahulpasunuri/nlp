I love this recipe, but have made the following modifications. Like another reviewer, I drain my own yogurt so it is very thick. I also mix the honey with the sour cream and yogurt. Instead of using good quality vinegar, I make a balsamic syrup. It is a little sweeter and thicker and really enhances the dish. The turbinado sugar works fine for me, but sometimes when I want to make it ahead of time I will make a creme brulee disc by spraying tin foil with a little cooking spray, sprinkling a teaspoon of turbinado sugar and using a kitchen torch to make a disc. Once it has cooled down you can peel it off the foil. When I am ready to serve, I just stick the disc in the center of the dish.

This recipe tastes great, but i can't ever get the broiling right. I now use a flambe kit from dessertsnow.com & it comes out perfect every time. No torching & great aromas

I'd make this again, with changes. I found using whole milk yogurt or the greek yogurt in the stores here to be too runny. Note to self: get strained yogurt or strain it myself. Rather than drizzle with honey, to get lost under the brulee, I'd mix honey in with the yogurt/sour cream blend to taste. Finally, you can't brulee turbinado sugar; it burns. Haven't tried oven dried brown sugar. Either way, test it first and have some plain white sugar on hand just in case! Oh, also, I second another reviewer's noting that the quality of this dish hangs on the quality of the vinegar you use.

Fabulous....I would not call it creme brulee, but it is fantastic. Make sure you use the finest vinegar. This was a HUGE hit with my dinner guests

Hardly a brulee but makes a nice dessert all the same.

To call this a "creme brulee" is a stretch but it was easy and delicious and more healthy. We enjoyed it.
