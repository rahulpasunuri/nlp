Wow! It was so tasty that I ate it as my main course. Works with kalamata olives too.

this recipe is beautiful. i added chives and basil to the recipe and doubled the dressing, and it made it even better. this will be my new favorite way to eat chick peas!

Simple and tasty. I added a mix of different types of olives...and used flat leaf parsley for bigger flavour.

Very quick, possible to make in 5 minutes. A tangy way to eat more chick peas. Mustard dressings never fail!

This is quick and easy to make and a good way to get chick peas into your diet. I didn't have Dijon mustard the first time I made this so had to use regular deli mustard - it was equally as good.

I have made this recipe several times. I like the flavor the green olives give this recipe. I make this as it is and it is excellent.

I thought this was very tastey. You have to love chick peas ans olives which I do. I didnt measure the olives and they were strong so next time I would chop the olives smaller and add a little less because they tend to over power the other flavors. Did I mention how much I love good food?

We're having a BBQ in our 80 degree weather here today, and this is an absolutely delicious addition to the grilled chicken we're having! Love the combination of garbanzos and olives. I did add a little more fresh parsley because I had alot on hand, but it is not necessary. If you're looking for something unique for a summer-type side dish give this a try. I'll certainly make this alot! KIMBER
