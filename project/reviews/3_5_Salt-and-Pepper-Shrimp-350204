Well, that ruined 2 pounds of good shrimp. They were FAR too salty, and I didn't even use all the salt this recipe called for. I did peel my shrimp, which perhaps made a difference, but I imagine that 2 tablespoons of salt in the breading would make anything far too salty.

This recipe turns out beautifully. Big question....do you eat it shell and all? I did and it was wonderful. My wife turned her nose up at eating the shells. My mother always said not to do that as it will give you some terrible disease .

I haven't actually made this recipe, but I had these shrimp at the actual Lantern Restaurant and they were absolutely amazing.
