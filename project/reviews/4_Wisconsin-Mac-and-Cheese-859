A keeper. I don't think I'll ever use a different homemade mac & cheese recipe. This is it.

A very easy and rewarding mac and cheese. We added a teaspoon and half of adobo sauce and some smoked ham. We'll be playing with this recipe for years!

Previous review - I did NOT add shredded chicken. Confusion with another recipe:)

Rating: 3
I made this for my family as part of our Super Bowl Sunday dinner and it was a big hit especially with my 7 yr old granddaughter! I used all skim milk/no broth; a shredded rotisserie chicken (about 14 ounces); 2 cups dry pasta; 3 green onions; and a combination of low fat sharp and mild cheddar cheese. Also, panko for the topping. Easy, quick and creamy.

have made this recipe since it was published in 1995. It is a family favorite. My kids LOVE the green onions. I have never changed the recipe except to double or triple it and use a little more pasta than called for. I think I might try a few of the suggestions here though. Love the idea of adding Lobster, I might go for crab, it's easier to get in Seattle.

This has become my go-to recipe for mac and cheese. It's so tasty and very kid-friendly. I have made a couple of tweaks along the way: I use 2 1/2 cups of pasta, add a squirt of dijon mustard, use panko crumbs for the topping, and sneak in a bit of pureed butternut squash for the sake of my two sons!

I was looking for a mac and cheese for two, so I tried this. I made a couple of changes. First, I used gobetti pasta, a fat but compact pasta that appears to be the ultimate for mac and cheese. It has thick walls, and it made this dish a bit more toothsome, something I enjoy. Second, I used a cup of cheddar and a half-cup of parmesan. I didn't use all of the sauce because, as I poured it over the pasta, I realized I had more than enough with about a half-cup left; my wife wanted more, though. Result? Hands down, the best mac and cheese, ever.

I really like this version of mac and cheese. It is easy and I prepared pretty much as is other than I used planko for the bread crumbs and added some cayenne pepper to that for a little zing. You also need to have a good sharp cheddar or it can be bland.

Worked when I made it with soy milk. I doubled the green onions and cut butter in half and it came out great.

Rating: 4
Surprisingly delicious. I'm not a huge fan of mac & cheese but this version was simple and turned super tasty. Best of all, it reheats well, the noodles don't suck up all the sauce as tends to happen. I used 2 cups of pasta since the reviewers said the recipe made too much sauce. Don't skip the green onions, they make the dish.

Loved the suggestions. I doubled the recipe (used a whole box of pasta) substituted vegetable broth with chicken broth and tossed in a teaspoon of country dijon mustard. It has plenty of flavor for a simple mac and cheese recipe and it is just what I was looking for.

We have made this several times and changed a few things. 1/4 cup of bread crumbs instead of wheat bread. Chicken broth instead of vegtable broth. 2 oz each of shredded sharp cheddar, shredded muenster. 2 oz of velveeta, and 2 oz cream cheese. Everything else we did 1 1/2 times the amounts shown.

Rating: 3
Great mac and cheese. The recipe is wonderful in its simplicity. I made this dish with my 2+ year old son, who loved grating the cheese and making breadcrumbs. I agree with earlier posts suggesting the use of more pasta. I used two cups, which seemed about right.

I used whole wheat macaroni, skipped the green onions, used low fat cheddar, and topped with steamed broccoli before covering with breadcrumbs. Excellent, easy weekday dinner and the leftovers kept very well.

SO GOOOOOOD!!!! I loved the sauce! Too much for the amount of macaroni though. I would add more macaroni

This was excellent! Cooking out of my boyfriend's fridge, I used half pepperjack and half mild chedder, chicken stock, and added sliced chicken and broccoli into the mix. I also took the advice to use 2 cups of pasta. I had rave reviews at dinner! Definitely will make again.

This is my new go-to macaroni and cheese recipe. Relatively simple, and my preschooler loves it. I layer the macaroni with steamed broccoli in the casserole dish. I also use panko for the topping, skip the green onions, and substitute reduced-fat for regular cheese.

Rating: 4
This was surprisingly exceptional. As per other reviewers I increased the pasta (two two cups), but I used rigatoni and feel like I could have easily used 3 cups to soak up all the cheese sauce. I loved the low butter content. (So many mac and cheese recipes needlessly add fat when there's enough in the cheese already!). I used a mix of about half cheddar and half muenster since that's what I had on had. I thought this added another layer of interest to the dish. The scallions were wonderful and the breadcrumb topping was perfection. I think this is better than the "Cheesemonger's Mac and Cheese" recipe that appears on this site!

I thought this was kind of blah so I added bacon - that helped a lot.

Yum! I modified based on what I had on hand, chicken broth, shallots, and Jarlsberg and Gruyere instead of cheddar. Also increased pasta to 1.5 cups, and used panko flakes on top. Turned out great, will definitely make this again.

...Additionally, if you double the sauce recipe and add one whole box of pasta, it works out nicely, and is a great way to feed the whole family instead of just two people. :-)

The sauce here reminds me of cheese-flavored silk sheets... The constant stirring gave my arms a workout, but it's essential to achieve that lovely consistency. I used Tillamook Extra Sharp White Cheddar, since I had some left over from the Gratin of Potato and White Cheddar from Thanksgiving. I also used radiatore pasta instead of elbow macaroni, and it lends a wonderful, unexpected texture to the dish, in addition to providing nice little nooks for the sauce to settle into and go *squish* when they're in your mouth. I took the advice of adding the dijon and the worcestershire, along with shallots and an abundance of black pepper and sea salt, which rounded out the flavors and brought the green onions in perfect harmony with the sharp cheese.

Rating: 3
like others, i found this recipe to be a bit too saucy, would up the pasta to 2 cups next time. green onions seemed odd when i was reading the recipe over, but definitely glad i used them. also, lots of fresh ground black pepper helped cut through the richness of the cheese.

Rating: 4
This recipe was wonderful but very cheesy. I forgot to buy green onions but it was still excellent without them. We did increase the amount of noodles to 1 ½ cups. I chose to use Cracker Barrel Extra Sharp Cheddar for the cheese and only used the amount listed in the recipe. Next time I may use half Cracker Barrel Extra Sharp and half Crack Barrel White just to mellow out the sharpness of the cheese. My husband thought it was great. Definitely a keeper.

Rating: 4
Well, I messed with this recipe also, but the basic technique is great. I used penne and added black pepper and dijon mustard, as one reviewer suggested. It turned out great, even with low grade cheddar. I would say that the green onions are absolutely essential.

Rating: 4
This is a great, easy recipe! I used an 8oz block of Tilamook extra sharp cheddar and chicken broth as suggested by others. I salted the pasta water and the salt level was perfect. Next time I'm going to try shallots instead of green onions.

Fabulous! I used 2 cups of bowtie pasta and 2 cups of cheese (extra sharp white cheddar and sharp yellow cheddar). I added ham before putting it in the oven, served with a salad. Heavenly...

I was looking for a "saucy" mac and cheese, not the baked dried out stuff my mother used to make. This was exactly what I was looking for. I omitted the bread crumbs and increased the macaroni to 1 1/2 cups as others suggested. I was hesitant about the green onions, but they added just enough flavor. Classic mac and cheese.

Rating: 4
Very good Mac and Cheese. To make it more decadent, I added cubed lobster. For some additional kick, I added 1/2 teas. cayenne pepper. Something was still missing, maybe just a little salt.

Rating: 4
This is thin the first time around even though I always add extra cheese. Definately a great second-day meal. I have made this several times, it's always a hit. I never use pre-shredded cheese, as it is combined with a substance that keeps it from clumping in the bag; which is bad when you want a good creamy and smooth cheese sauce. This is definately the best, easy and quick mac and cheese I've found!

Rating: 2
I AM guilty for changing the recipe. I was inspired by and went by the ratios of this one however, and am very grateful to it. I used 2 c pasta, 2 c. non-fat milk (no stock), 2 c. sharp cheddar, 2 tbs butter, 2 tbs flour, 1 shredded onion, a tbs of old bay seasoning and a tablespoon of mustard. Not exceptional, but lovely creamy and just the right amount of sauce to pasta.

Rating: 4
I have made several times and love this recipe. I agree w/ reviewers on going w/ sharp cheddar (but might just be a preference). I add more pasta because I think it's too saucy and it's an easy way to stretch the recipe (leftovers are loved here!). I like the suggestions other reviewers have made for additions and will likely try, but for your first attempt I would recommend trying as-is because it's very good!

Rating: 4
This is best, simple mac and cheese recipe I have ever made. I did find that there was enough sauce for 1 1/2 cups pasta. I also added 1/2 tsp. dijon mustard and a couple drops of worcestershire sauce. Don't forget to add salt to your pasta water otherwise it will always be bland.

Rating: 3
almost forgot to mention - like another reviewer i added about %50 more cheese than the recipe called for!

Rating: 3
good as is. better with bacon - about 1/2 lb, or prosciutto. also used chicken instead of veg stock b/c that is what we had. also like other reviewers, i mixed a variety of cheese - sharp cheddar was a little bland on it own so used aged gouda, a sharp parm and a few others we had around. all around a good texture - you may want to make more breadcrumbs as this seemed skimpy.

Rating: 3
I followed the advice of previous reviewers and used the 3 cups past and 2 cups cheese. I also used a diced shallot instead of the green onion and chicken broth. This was decent, but if I make it again, I will use an extremely sharp cheddar - such as Cracker Barrel extra sharp white cheddar - not the extra sharp pre-shredded kind, since this was a little bland to me and required tons of salt to make it tasty. The kids loved this recipe.

Rating: 4
Yummy! I have been looking for recipes to feed my picky toddler. This is fantastic! I doubled the recipe and used whole milk. Not too liquidy at all! Very creamy. I also used a full 4 cups of cheese and added bacon crumbles along with the macaroni. I omitted the onion, simply because I forgot to buy any at the store...and it was terrific. The bacon really gave it a lovely, slightly smoky flavor. Definitely use store-bought bread crumbs! Great recipe. Everyone loved it, and it's going in the rotation. Thanks!

Used large macaroni, bread crumbs, chicken broth, white onion (sauteed) and doubled the recipe to use the whole package of noodles. Loved this recipe and it was so easy! Creamy with a crusty top.

I took the advice given by the reviewers below me and cut the amount of liquid. I used half a cup of broth and half a cup of half & half because I ran out of milk. The texture was perfect, but the taste was super boring and bland. Next time I will try different cheeses and maybe some paprika or dry mustard or something to give it a kick of flavor.

Pretty darn good. Next time I'll use a little less liquid, or bake it for a few minutes before broiling, it was a little thin.

I wanted to use up some cheese I had in the fridge, so I grated aged gouda, some chipotle cheddar and a bit of chevre. Delicious. I bet that you could throw in any good cheeses and have a great dish. (Also, I used less liquid and added just a touch of sun-dried tomato paste, which did nice things for the color.)

This is going to be my standard mac and cheese recipe going forward. Used good quality aged cheddar and added some leftover diced ham that was in the fridge. Baked for 20 mins. at 350 until golden brown. Used regular bread crumbs in place of the whole wheat bread, with touch of paprika for colour. This serves four very nicely.

Rating: 4
Fabulous. Made a few changes. Used organic chicken broth, instead of vegetable. Added a sprinkle of nutmeg to the finished sauce. Plus, I used Panko breadcrumbs because they were in the house. Oh, and it's winter and my green onions all froze last night, so I chopped up half a shallot and added it to the sauce, absolutely killer!

I always leave the green onions out, just because I don't like them on principle. But this always turns out GREAT and is never rejected by those I'm cooking for. It's the perfect example of comfort food that will always bring a smile and satisfied look to the faces of those eating it.

Now I know were noodles and co. got it from.. Delish!! Use scallions instead of onions... It makes kraft look disgusting...

Finally! A recipe for Mac & Cheese that is creamy, flavorful and easy. I, too, followed West Linn's recommendations for 3 cups pasta, 2 cups cheese. Used half a bouillon cube in hot water for the broth, used whole wheat macaroni, and a raw milk sharp cheddar. I also grated a small onion and sauteed it in the butter before adding the flour instead of the green onions, which weren't available. I divided the sauced macaroni between eight one-cup ramekins and baked for the suggested 15 minutes, with a 2-minute broil. Perfect! Creamy inside with a soft, slightly crusty top.

I made some changes that were really delicious -- used a bit less milk and a dollop of sour cream, small dollop of dill-dijon mustard, chives instead of green onion, some paprika, and a bay leaf in the milk during its simmering process. A regular 8oz. bar of extra-sharp white cheddar and 3 cups of pasta was the right proportion. I topped it with buttered panko, baked in 2 pie tins as suggested below, then broiled for a few minutes. It was fantastic.

I made this with the changes the cook from West Linn gave (3c shells, 2c cheese, bake) and it was not soupy at all. I added 1/4c of sour cream because of the reviews that it was flavorless and this made it AMAZING!

This is the best mac n cheese recipe I have ever made. If you don't have scallions you can add shallots or red onion. Instead of vegetable broth, I use chicken broth.

I agree it's rather soupy. Next time I might try putting in less milk and broth to see if that helps. Flavor was great, but aftertaste was slightly bland so I added a small can of diced green chiles to the mix. Overall it was pretty good. BTW, 1 slice bread makes about 3/4 c. crumbs (not sure what that translates to if you want to use dry bread crumbs... maybe 1/2 c?)

A very good Mac & Cheese Recipe. A problem with using sharp cheese of any kind is graininess. To smooth out, use four slices of American processed cheese. (I know, but it really works). Also used three cups pasta shells,two cups cheese and baked for 15 minutes at 350 in individual casserole dishes. This eliminates the soupiness and makes this dish a true homerun.

A family favorite. Kraft in the box it is not.

I agree with the others; too soupy. I used 3 cups of elbow macaroni. I also added a bit of cayenne pepper and about 1/4 cup of blue cheese. the results were very tasty.

Cook in Chicago is right - this does not double well! I used four cups of large elbow macaroni (al dente), and it still was a bit soupy. Nice mild "All American" taste that begs for something more - tomatoes, mushrooms, jalepenos. I added 1/2 tsp. of cayenne to give it a kick. I still think it could be sharper.

Love this recipe. I make and pour into 2 individual ramkins. I never use the butter/crumb mixture rather just pour over some breadcrums. It's a little more moist than the home mac and cheese my grandmother and mom make but then again, I could just add more macaroni. Why spoil great cheese sauce though right. Comfort food at it's best.

We thought it was good but a little bland. My husband still prefers Kraft-from-the-box.

Very good and extremely quick and easy! I didn't have green onions so I used scallions and it was a little strong. Next time I will use a little garlic and skip the onions. I added a tiny bit of Asiago to the sauce and used whole wheat pasta. I was very impressed that the sauce could compete with the strong whole wheat taste. My husband said he can never go back to mac and cheese from a box after having had this recipe!

I make this recipe quite often, and it always comes out great. Last time, I didn't have scallions, so I used onion powder, and it changed the taste of the dish but was good nonetheless. Instead of broiling, I bake in the oven, and I use beef broth instead of chicken broth. You can double or even triple the recipe if needed.

Contrary to what it may say, this recipe does not double well. I now have a casserole dish full of cheese and macaroni soup. I'm waiting for it to cool so I can throw it away. If I could rate this recipe a 0 I would.

Great Mac and Cheese. It was so good before baking-- I was tempted to eat straight from the pan. I used sharp cheddar and gruyere. Added some cayenne and dry mustard. Went great with the bbq chicken legs and cherry tomato salad.

This is the BEST macaroni and cheese ever! I made a few amendments to the recipe (i.e. I used chicken instead of vegetable broth, replaced the green onion with dill, and baked the finished product in a serving dish rather than broil it) DELICIOUS! It is our favorite comfort food.

I used a combination of cheddar, provolone & mozz cheese mix. It needed something. So I added some of Emeril's Essence & bam! Just what it needed for my taste buds! Next time I will use Wisconsin cheddar. Maybe then I won't have to add anything more. I gave it 3 forks for taste & 1 for ease of prep. A great do ahead recipe!

My husband and kids flipped out over this. I doubled the recipe and after dinner last night and lunch this afternoon, there is not a speck left. I used two cups each of sharp cheddar and provolone, which was a nice blend. I made it in the morning, then baked it (covered) at 350 for about 15-20 minutes, before broiling it to brown the breadcrumbs. I'll definitely be making it again soon!

I have to agree with all the others. As far as mac & cheese goes, this is the best. So creamy and delicious. (As long as you follow the instructions...the first time I made it I just threw everything together sans the directed whisk time. It was delicious, but a little gritty. The second time I whisked as directed---smooooooth!) My husband who does not like mac and cheese likes this recipe--a lot! P.S. I stand by REAL WISCONSIN CHEESE. Velveeta's flavor just doesn't measure up.

Rating: 0
I haven't made this recipe, but it's very close to mine! I don't use broth, but use 1 cup lowfat milk, and 1/4 cup mayonnaise (adds a great zing) when making the cheese sauce. I also use regular onions, chopped, and saute them in the butter before adding the flour to make the roux. Try mixing more grated cheese to the breadcrumbs (and use coarse crumbs for more crunch). To the folks who had texture problems with the cheddar, try adding some colby, or co-jack to the mixture. It seems to help with this problem.

havn't tried it yet, but thinking of different cheeses brings to mind trying a processed sharp american that melts easily, I usually use Velveeta for mac & cheese, and have had it with the sharp american and it's very good.

I doubled this recipe and used 2 pie plates. We ate it as a side with a grilled chicken salad and you definitely would not have to double it, there was plenty for two people and a child with the one pie plate. I didn't love using all sharp cheddar because I found the sauce a bit gritty in texture. I would love to hear suggestions on other combination of cheeses with the cheddar though.

I like this recipe as is, but sometimes I'll double the recipe, then add 1 small clove of garlic, minced. The garlic adds to this recipe, but be careful not to put too much in. It will overpower it, especially if there's leftovers.
