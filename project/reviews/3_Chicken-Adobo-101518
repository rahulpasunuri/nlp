I make this dish all the time. My recipe is similar, but with some differences. The main difference being that I use a 1/2 cup soy sauce and a 1/4 cup vinegar instead of the other way around. I also simmer my Adobo for a lot longer. Adobo should be balanced in flavor. Not too sour or salty.

This worked out very well! I would recommend NOT using whole peppercorns, though. They are overpowering when you bite into them. I doubled the sauce ingredients and had plenty to spoon over rice, etc. I found the Phillipino vinegar (datu puti) at my Safeway! I will make this a part of my regular rotation.

Really easy and pretty tasty. I simmered it at least 20 minutes longer than the recipe said for better tenderness and flavor penetration. However, I prefer the similar "adobo style" chicken recipe also on this site because even though it's not "real" adobo (that's why it's called adobo STYLE- it's not claiming to be traditional), the marinating makes the chicken more tender and flavorful throughout than this recipe, especially when using breasts or a whole cut-up chicken.

It's as close as it can get to the authentic way of cooking it! Some would be off-putted with the sourness owing to the vinegar but there is a way out of lessening the vinegar's acidity. Try cooking this with the lid off for the next 5 minutes upon introducing the vinegar to the pot. Then cover up to reduce the sauce. By the way, try using cane vinegar available at some oriental grocery, it's mildly sour and slighty sweet, will surely makes a big difference to your adobo!

Four forks for the ease and goodness of the dish. I used a deep skillet/pot to allow for more of a boil (as suggested by another reviewer - I agree it's meant to be like a boil). The point of this dish, I believe, is a bit of that vinegar tang, so while that may be a put-off to some, that's what I'm after when craving adobo. I had broiled chicken breasts a day before and just cut and used those, but having a bone-in cut of chicken (I'd prefer thigh over leg) would be more desirable. I also swapped whole coriander vs. pepper, resulting in an interestingly good variation. I'd recommend a 50/50 blend if you were to try this, though, as I miss a bit of pepper.

I love chicken this way, but my husband finds it too vinegary. Cooking at a simmer is important to get the tender texture. Yum!

This is a great base recipe. I switched the cider vinegar for Trader Joe's rice wine vinegar plus regular white distilled vinegar to give a little extra tanginess and instead of peppercorns I used some garlic pepper and added extra garlic). Try this recipe!

Love adobo but make quite a few revisions to this recipe just to add depth to the flavors. Include some sherry wine, brown sugar, pineapple juice, white vinegar in place of some of the cider vinegar. Broil to finish to thicken up sauce and make the chicken slightly crispy. I've also marinated in this mixture, then stewed it with potatoes and onions. Delicious in many many variations.

Honestly, being that I am filipino, theres a few things I disagree with...okay two things only. The oil? My family nor myself has ever used oil and perhaps thats because of my second disagreement, being use of a skillet. Traditional preparation for this dish has always been to boil it and somewhat of a reduction for a good gravy from all of the contents. Given this recipe I do agree that this makes the vinegar dominate which defeats the purpose of the entire dish as would adding even more soy sauce(someones suggestion). The soy sauce would cause a bad bad bad salty flavor not doing any better than too much vinegar. I say good try but practice this dish a bit more and BALANCE all of your flavors as that is the purpose of this dish.

I made this recipe exactly as it is written...and it was delicious! I have tried other recipes over the years, trying to match the adobo prepared by the housekeeper who worked for my parents when they were on assignment in Manilla in the 1960's. This was the closest yet in flavor, but in her version, the skin was more crispy. Perhaps she fried it after stewing, as one member suggested in her review. Nevertheless, I will stick to the broiling method to cut down on the fat and definitely make this again.

This was delicious! I'm not sure about the comments about it being too sour??? As long as you cook down the sauce as directed I can't see how the dish would come out so sour. Make sure you are using cider vinegar it is richer and milder in flavor than white vinegar! I substituted pickling spices for the black pepper and bay leaves (which basically adds a little clove and some red pepper flakes); I also added additional red pepper flakes as my husband and I both like spicy food.

I am not sure what problems the other reviewers had, but I am pretty snobbish about food, what with being French and all, as well as an experience cook, but I liked this dish very much and so has everyone who had it at my house. One guest could not stop eating it and even had it for breakfast.

This is a nice dish, but the vinegar is a bit overpowering...perhaps a little more soy and a little less vinegar?

for being filipino and watching my mother make adobo w/out measuring ingredients, this was a disaster. i've made this before using the same technique and the measurements were more in the TBLs caliber. Being an epicurious fan, I followed the instructions and i've never had MAJOR kitchen disaster where i didn't even want to eat it. this recipe tells the story of vinegar being the boss. not exactly the ruler of ingredients in your dishes. this was sorry big time.

The previous reviewer described it correctly, but I loved it from the first time I tasted it at Mike Zamora's Phillipino restaurant in Juneau, AK. This recipe tasted very close to what I remember. It is as important to read all the reviews as it is to read the recipe to understand what to expect. It is delicious, quick, and uses ingredients you probably already have on hand.

I was so pleased to find this dish! Followed it exactly as written. Tastes just like the chicken adobo made by Filipina co-workers & shared at pot lucks in California. I will definitely make this again! Best with either skinless, boneless thighs or bone-in. Using cider vinegar is a must. White distilled vinegar is too sour.

I don't think I'll be repeating the part about using whole peppercorns--probably better to just grind pepper. Also: way too little of the delicious sauce. Next time I'll double the soy and vinegar. Yummy!

This is delicious, and I am not a chicken-lover. My family loved it, too. I cooked the Chicken Adobo according to the recipe, making no changes. Perfect as it is. I also used the sauce, made separately, as a marinade and basting sauce for pork ribs that we cooked over charcoal. Also delicious. Definitely a saver!

I admit that I haven't tried THIS recipe for adobo but just wanted to recommend adding pineapple and the juice that it's packed in to balance the saltiness from the soy sauce, and the acidic bite from the vinegar. That is the adobo that I grew up with. Using bone-in dark meat from the chicken, and combining with cubes of pork (pork butt or shoulder) is great too. Try it!

I was a little nervous about this dish while I was cooking it. The sauce tasted a little strange to me. I even made extra plain chicken thighs just in case. Well, I needn't have worried. This came out delicious. My guests loved it. I added a sliced onion when cooking the garlic. When I make this again, I'll probably experiment with other vinegars.

After having one stab at a mediocre adobo recipe, I was reluctant to try this one. However, it was a tasty surprise! I only used 1/3 cup of vinegar, but I added an extra bay leaf. Really nice recipe for boneless, skinless chicken thighs.

I agree with a previous reviewer who said that this dish would taste better with filipino soy sauce and vinegar, although my mom always used regular heinz white vinegar. I would increase the soy and vinegar by 2, and I always add 1 to 2 cups of water. My mom always added 1-2 tablespoons of brown sugar to counteract the sourness, but it all depends on your taste. Filipino recipes are never exact. Using chicken with the bone is a must, and I think using drums is best.

I prefer my adobo with pork and also mirin, or a little sugar. My fiancee cooks it with sliced garlic which is lightly browned before the meat is added. Adobo is a great dish, easily my favorite Philippino food.

This was ok. It could have been me using chicken breasts that screwed it up, but I also thought it was too salty, and there wasn't much sauce at all...barely 2 teaspoonfuls per person. I guess I'd try a different recipe or try it with legs as written if I wasn't trying to lose a few pounds. Not terrible, just not great.

This has become a standard in my household. Delicious, easy, and requires few ingredients - most of which are already on hand. Excellent with rice or mashed potatoes. Can't speak to its authenticity, but it's definitely a favorite.

OUTSTANDING! it seems like i cooked it perfectly, the way the flavours blended together and made the chicken so juicy and slightly salty (but not too salty at all). the most flavourful chicken yet. this recipe tastes very authentic, just like my friend karen used to make. also, i would recommend making more sauce, to add over vegetables or rice (i used broccoli). maybe multiply by 1.5, especially if you plan to use leftovers. YUMMMMMMMMMMMM!

Must use Filipino soy sauce and Filipino vinegar. You would be surprised the different in taste. It's so much better. Preferably, Datu Puti Vinegar made out of coconut, and Silver Swan soysauce or Marca Pina soy sauce. Can be purchased in any oriental stores. Use lots of garlic I use about 2 bulbs of garlic evertime I cook and marinate overnight and bring to a boil til chicken is tender or half cooked. Remove chicken from mixture and let mixture boil for 15 more mins til it thickens. Then either fry or broil chicken til brown, pour over mixture to the chicken and serve.

Adobo is a staple dish in thousands of Filipino homes, and there are probably just as many variations on preparing it. I personally, would prefer to use less vinegar, more garlic, and maybe another bay leaf to make it taste more like how my mother and my grandmother made it. Chicken legs and thighs work great, I remove the skin to reduce the fat content, but I always leave the meat on the bone. Boneless chicken doesn't seem very authentic. Baby back ribs, Pork butt or shoulder, cut into 2 inch cubes, also works great in this preparation.

This recipe has it backwards: first you poach the chicken in the vinegar (white, not cider) mix, then you brown. And use more bay leaves.
