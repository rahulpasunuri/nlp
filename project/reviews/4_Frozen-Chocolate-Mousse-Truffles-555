Delicious - Yes! Easy - Yes! Messy - Yes! My sister recommends rolling not more than 7 revolutions per truffle and keeping your hands ice-cold. Seriously, best for single service ie: after dinner to seated guests, not on a party buffet where they do melt down and need refreezing.

These were absolutely delish, but they were very hard to serve, because even straight from the freezer they were not firm enough. Like ice cream, they couldn't sit out for more then a few seconds before becoming really mushy. And they were quite a lot of work for the small yield.

super and very easy. i dusted them w/cocoa powder and used triple sec (i llove the orange/chocolate combo) to great success. will definitely make again.

These truffles were delicious. I melted the chocolate in a double boiler - much easier to blend with the custard. I also doubled the amaretto. They seemed better after freezing at least 24 hours.

Excellent dessert. I doubled the amount of amaretto and loved the results. I recommend this one. Easy too.

Absolutely marvelous - and so easy to make. My friends and family think I'm a genius. I'll not tell them my very own secret.

I made two different kinds of truffles over the weekend, and my boyfriend and I decided this was the best recipe! The amaretto offers a really nice flavor, and the custard makes them soft and delicious!

This recipe is a keeper, and I have made these truffles several times. I have used rum, Baileys, and amaretto. All were fabulous!! They are easy to make, and I have served them to my favorite guests.

These are delicious and VERY rich. If you are a chocolate lover, then this is something you should try.
