Caution with the dressing - if I were to do it again, I'd add to the lobster, not the other way around. In my take on the recipe, I ended up overpowering the lobster flavor, which was a dissapointment. Not bad, but not great.

Although this may seem tacky, I used surimi lobster to make this for my children for lunch. I did have to guess on the proportions of ingredients since I don't know how much meat 4 lobsters yield, but it was very lemony and fresh. All of us loved it and have made it several times.

I thought this was delicious, but I did make a few changes. First, I used about half the recommended amount of lemon juice and celery. I also put some lettuce on the rolls before filling them. But the biggest change, and what I think made this meal so much better for me than the other reviewers, is that I added chopped avocado. It added the creamy texture that was missing without the normal mayo.

I have to agree with the other review, and I didn't use ANY celery leaves. I did use lobster tails instead of the whole lobster, and steamed them. But the lobster taste was totally lost--too much lemon juice? Parsley? I'd recommend cutting everything but the lobster by half. Maybe the reason the classic lobster roll recipes use mayo is because it enhances the lobster flavor. I'm trying this again, but not using the proportions suggested here.

This had too much celery for our taste. We will make it again, because the vinaigrette was good, but would cut down on the celery and celery leaves drastically.
