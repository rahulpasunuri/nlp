Have made this 3 times, to rave reviews. Takes some effort but totally worth it.

I have made this a few times now and it always gets rave reviews - no one fails to ask for the recipe. I do make a slightly revised version - I skip the olives as my family doesn't eat them. Instead of browning the chicken first on the fire, I broil it for about 5 minutes and then pour on the onion - wine mixture and remaining ingredients. I used less oil and shortened the cooking time to caramelize the onions, and then just add wine etc on top of onions in the skillet. (I'm sure browning the chicken in the pan is even better, but I don't usually have the time for it). I baked my chicken uncovered on a higher temp - about 400. Overall, a fabulous tasty and tender chicken recipe!

This is one of my favorite recipes on Epicurious. I've never made it with whole chickens, but have used skinless, boneless chicken breasts instead. I have also made it with short ribs- both were delicious! It is perfect for company and gets better the longer it sits.

A wonderful dish! I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and my Hannukah party guests ate every bit of it. It's easy to do ahead of time, in fact I caramelized the onion the night before, seasoned the chicken the next morning and then put the whole thing together and baked it an hour before serving. I did cut back in the olives by half, and there were still plenty of them. I will make this again. and again. Goes great with potato latkes!

this looks delicious, which side dishes can i pair it with to make it an elegant yet robust meal?

I have made this twice: when the recipe first appeared in 2004 and again this month, after reading such great reviews. I was disappointed. The dish was not bad, but not delicious or spectacular. I made it exactly as stated. The onions caramelized beautifully; the chicken with the spice rub browned up very nicely, the shallots and garlic got nice and soft, and the wine nicely deglazed the browned bits in the pan. The chicken did stay moist, which is a plus. However, the end result for me was just so-so. I made it with the suggested bulghur/lentil side dish (which I also do not recommend).

Absolutely delicious but takes forever to make - set aside time on the weekend for this one, or plan ahead for when you're entertaining. The flavors are wonderful, and all the time and effort is really worth it. Sometimes I make it without olives (I know, kind of the focus of the dish, but my husband hates olives so what can you do), and it is still delicious without them.

I not only squealed in delight when I tasted this, but have craved it since. Such a great depth of flavors. I did make one substitution on the pilaf (could not find bulgar) I used couscous instead. The whole meal was lovely and a big hit with my guests.

This was quite tasty although maybe a touch sweet. Lot's of flavours, though, and the chicken was very tender. I admit I didn't add the olives, and that might have made it perfect.

This recipe was so wonderful that my husband had me make it three times in one week and he usually complains when I make chicken!

EXCELLENT. OK, so I usually make too much food, so last night I served brisket and roasted off 2 chickens using this recipe. By the time guests finished eating the brisket/making room on their plates, no one was going to try the chicken . Then I started carving up the chicken breasts... and in spite of not wanting to eat another bite, everyone loved this! Definitely making this again and again.

I made this recipe last night, and though it was the first chicken dish I've ever made (I'm a vegetarian), it was really easy. I made this dish for my carnivorous honey, but I have to admit that it looked and smelled so good, I was tempted to sneak a bite myself. The only thing you need to know is that it takes a while - almost two hours start to finish. But from the reaction I got, I'd say it was worth it!

Amazing! This is my husband's favorite dinner - before I made this dish he was convinced that he hated onions... Very forgiving recipe.

Fantastic! I made it as written except reduced the amount of olives. EVERYONE loved it! Even my picky 8 and 3 year old boys ate it! Will make it again and again! Flavorful, lovely presentation.

I tried this due to the other reviews for a dinner party and EVERYONE loved it even a couple guys who "don't even like chicken". It was simple to prepare ahead, cover and then just pop in the oven when company came. I used chicken legs (thighs with drumsticks). Left overs were great too!

Phenomenal! Made this a few christmas' ago when my family decided it was too late to plan a dinner. Came together easily at the last minute and was still extremely elegant and incredibly delicious! This recipe saved christmas!

This is a tasty dish, but not nearly spicy enough for me and my husband and I used the same amount of spice for two chicken breasts as is called for in the recipe for two whole chickens! I would make this again but with more spice and more heat.

I served this at a dinner party, and it was a big hit. I made it as is, with the exception of the amount of the olives (I used one and a half cups). Would definitely make again.

This turned out to be a nice chicken dish, but not as great as anticipated. Overall, the presentation was impressive, but taste was somewhat lacking. Would recommend adding extra cumin, garam masala, and chili powder to spice it up a bit more. Olives are a must for this dish.

This was fabulous. Beautiful presentation, lucious flavors, this is a special occasion recipe you can trust! I served it with warm onion and olive foccacia so people could wipe up all the delicious sauce. Would recommend a light salad as well.

Phenomenal. I make this dish with skinned and boned chicken breasts and cook for the same time indicated in the recipe. The result is tender and packed with flavor.

Considering all the dynamic ingrediants in this thing I was a bit disappointed in the outcome, which was a bit lackluster. Not much zing. I wouldn't make this to impress guests, but its ok for inlaws : )

Made this for a dinner party of 8 adults and 3 children this evening. Everyone raved! I made it almost just as described, except I only had about a cup and a half of pitted kalamata olives and I used 6 boneless, skinless chicken breasts along with 6 drumsticks. I also made it earlier in the morning then simply heated it, covered in a 325F oven for about 40 minutes. The presentation is lovely right in the baking dish. I also made the orzo, feta and tomato salad from this site, and green salad. Add pita bread, some store bought hummus and olives from the olive bar and voila! and wonderful Mediterranean meal that appeals to everyone, even our 4 and 6 year olds!

I made the recipe exactly as described, next time I would use more sage. I served the chicken over rice pilaf with steamed broccoli, it was delicious.

I'm looking for recipes for a relatively fancy Hannukah dinner and tried this out last night. It was very good, fantastic according to my daughter and excellent from my husband. I think the addition of preserved lemon would be great. Like others, I cut down on the olives. Nice presentation, although the pilaf was too brown looking for my taste. Next time I'd use all the onions with the chicken and make a rice pilaf. Also served haricots vert for color. Very nice.

It is not often I would RAVE about a chicken dish. Let's face it, chicken is rarely knock your socks off fantastic. This dish however not only looks gorgeous when served (I served it right in a pretty backing dish) but it is so full of layers and layers of flavor it can't be described. I added 1/4 of a chopped preserved lemon to the sauce to give it a bit of brightness, other than that, I made no changes

Rating: 4
This was a little time-consuming, but not difficult, and absolutely worth it. A huge hit, flavorful and moist, and we can't wait for leftovers today. If I did it again I would probably use half or less of the amount of olives suggested. Also, the recipe says it serves eight, but I served seven and we had about a third of it leftover (even after some people had seconds).

I've made this recipe numerous times and each time it's garnered rave reviews. I agree with the reviewer who said that the caremlized onions were especially delicious--make sure to serve lots of them with the bird--the combination is fabulous!

I have made this recipe several times and even my picky children request it. They especially love the carmelized onions, which I would never have predicted. I have this recipe high in my rotation!

Oh my gosh, such a delicious dish! I will definitely make this again. I loved the chicken, but the juices that collected at the bottom of the roasting pan really made the meal for me. I poured these juices and all the lovely caramelized onions the chicken cooked with over some bulgur I made as a side dish. A great meal to make for company. I'd rate this five forks if I could!

Rating: 4
Absolutely fabulous made just the way the recipe says! And I even found that it doesn't take as long to saute and carmelize the onions as allowed. The sauce is wonderful over a side dish of linguine.

This recipe was AMAZING. I wanted to (ok, I DID) lick my plate! My only regret is I did not realize until after making it that it had a pilaf to accompany it. It would have been delicious as is, but I made a few changes. Instead of cumin, I used an equal amount of garam masala; boneless chicken breasts and thighs; a full head of garlic; and only 1 cup of Kalamata olives because 3 seemed to be too many. I don't agree that it took a lot of time to make. I thought it was rather quick. I just found other things to do in the kitchen while I waited for the onions to carmelize. Make this recipe, you will LOVE it!!!

Absolutely delicious. I didn't change a thing. The pilaf was the best bulgur dish I have ever had. I usually prefer bulgur in taboulleh salad, but not in a hot dish. The chicken with the pilaf on the side was such a wonderful blend of flavors. The honey added a nice depth of flavor to the onions, and not so much sweetness as I expected.

Rating: 2
The spices were wonderful and the chicken was very flavorful - but I found the recipe to be much too heavy on oil - It didn't need 2/3 cups of olive oil to carmelize the onions and cerainly ended up too oily to make a nice broth for the end. I would restrict the oil for carmelizing the onion to maybe less than 1/3 cup and then add chicken broth just after wine was added and reduce the wine and the broth and the oil down for a flavorful sauce while the chicken was baking. I kept reading the recipe to be sure that I wasn't supposed to drain the oil before adding the wine.

I made this for company and it was delicious and beautiful looking too. There are a number of steps, so it takes some work, but I made it a day ahead, so it only needed reheating to serve. I mixed the dry spices in an empty spice bottle and that made the "sprinkling" easy and uniform over the chicken. This recipe ranks up there with Chicken Mirabella ( from the Silver Palate) as the perfect, savory dinner party dish.

Rating: 4
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!! You have to be in the mood to cook this, since there are alot of steps. But, well worth the outcome!! I used just kalmata pitted olives, and I marinated my chicken in buttermilk for a few hours (as I have found this really tenderizes the meat) but other than that, followed the recipe to a T. My husband and I will definitely make this again, and next time, for a dinner party.

TRY SAUCE ON FISH! While in the Florida Keyes, I had a fish dish with a very robust sauce. Since I have 150 lbs. of halibut from an AK trip and have cooked many chowders, stews, tempuras and modified many recipes originally calling for chichen or shrimp to fish dishes, I decided to try this robust sauce for halibut. I do all the steps except do not put the fish fillet in until the last 5-10 minutes. WONDERFUL!

I made this for a supper party recently and got rave reviews. The dish does take a little while to prepare, but the complexity and depth of flavour is worth every minute. It was, for us, and unsusal combination of flavours, which was a treat too. We had the lentil and bulgur pilaf and took the suggestion of a Californian Zinfandel to accompany - both huge successes. I will certainly be making this again.

This dish has such a wonderful, full, rich flavor. Its one of those things that tastes so authentic, like it took all day to make, and is deeply satisfying. Made this on a Sunday, not too time consuming for a weekend dinner. We were short on the quantity of wine (I usually keep the mini-bottles on hand for cooking) and since it was Sunday we could not buy more. We substituted stock for the rest of the wine and it was fabulous. The best chicken dish I've had in years.

This dish has such delicious complexity of flavor--I don't think the recipe needs to be altered at all. I did buy pitted Kalamata olives, which saved some time.

We prepared this for a large dinner party and it was a great hit-- I did substitute boneless and skinless thighs and breasts for the chicken. I let it sit cooked for several hours and then reheated it in the oven before I added the olives and removed the foil...

This is a great dish, and yes, time consuming. For a special meal or a party it is worth the effort. I took it to a New Year's party and everyone loved it. Plus it looks beautiful. Go easy on the salt, as the olives add alot of salt at the end.

Definitely will try this. To all about pitting olives: I have an olive pitter which I use frequently.

A very intense dish!!! DO NOT leave out the bottle of wine in this dish. You will be reduceing the flavor, and takeing flavor away from the dish. I used 9 bottles, one for the recipe, 8 for me and guest to enjoy with the dinner!!

I concur with other reviewers that this is a labor intensive recipe. The chicken however has a depth of flavor that makes it worth the time on occasion.

Rating: 3
I made this dish over the holidays when I had 2 people to help me -- nice having extra hands. The dish is very flavorful. Make the lentil and bulgur pilaf (in the same issue) as a companion dish, the flavors really complement each other. Flatten olives by smashing with a knife and picking out the pit. I'd layer the ingredients in a shallow baking dish, like a 13x9, for the baking.

I just made this for dinner; it looked fabulous and tasted even better. I will agree that it is very time-intensive (not really labor-intensive, as there's not much chopping, the bulk of the time is spent waiting for the dish to cook, and I didn't pit the olives--no one seemed to care), but it'll be perfect for a weekend dinner when I have lots of time. Definitely a keeper

Very labor intensive pitting all of those olives, but fantastic flavor. Yes, you need to reduce the entire bottle of wine. The dish would lack a certain depth of flavor without it.

Rating: 0
Sounds "earthy" and wonderful--haven't cooked it yet. One thing stands out in the prep: Not a good idea to let raw chicken "rest" for over 30 minutes while you prepare the onions, etc. I would keep it refrigerated, maybe in a plastic bag to help speed up the seasoning.

Rating: 3
A whole bottle of wine is not too much. You're reducing the wine to 2 cups to intensify the flavor.

To lhodgos from Toronto--If you are making this dish for 8, buy 5 or 6 bottles of wine, use one for the pot(which will be a bit) and the rest for the cook-and the guests. Obviously you could sub chicken broth(or even water) but then it would not be the same recipe would it? This looks delicious, and I am going to try it(with all the wine) this weekend.

Rating: 0
This recipe calls for an entire bottle of wine. Is that really necessary? What about "a bit for the pot, and more for the cook?"!! With the caramelized onions and all that wine reducing, it must be very rich and delicious. Not your ordinary chicken! Does anyone think could reduce the wine and substitute chicken broth?
