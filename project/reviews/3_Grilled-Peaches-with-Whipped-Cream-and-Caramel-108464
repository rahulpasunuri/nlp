I made these for supper. They were delicious. The caramel and whipped cream really added to their sweetness. I will definitely make them again.

I make this a lot - and serve it with a dollop of mascarpone cheese instead, and sprinkle the whole thing with a little cocoa powder for some contrast. Also, a *small* amount of butter along with the sugar on each peach seems to help. I do this under the broiler sometimes, since the grill can get messy from the fruit.

Thanks for all the great suggestions... I plan to make this for a birthday dinner on our boat, and just wanted to add a few ideas: 1) marinate the peaches in orange juice before grilling, and 2) sprinkle candied pecans/walnuts on top of whatever topping you use (ice cream or whipped cream) to add some texture and interest on top. Ice cream w/honey strikes me as an easy presentation that will get good reviews, so thanks again!

For a 'Too Busy to Cook' I agree with the Cook from Tulsa ... delicious with good quality, vanilla icecream. Even my picky kids liked it! Something different yet classy for a last minute BBQ.

excellent; however, the special whipped cream is not needed if you just serve the peaches over vanilla ice cream and drizzle with caramel. my guests adored it

Toronto's point is a good one--especially in the "Too Busy to Cook?" section, Bon Appetit will often refer to convenience items from the store. You can typically find fat-free caramel sauce as well; by omitting the whipped cream and just using the caramel, you can make this a healthy dessert that seems indulgent.

To the cook from Norwalk: Bon Appetit often calls for purchased ingredients to help save time. They are doing that here as well; look for carmel sauce down the ice cream aisle in almost any grocery store. And if you are inclined to make your own, there are many recipes on Epicurious that give very specific instructions.

The grilling is for carmelization, which adds another depth of flavor.

the peaches tasted good, but what did grilling do? they were heated a little, but otherwise i didnt see the point.

This is a wonderful easy summer grilling recipes that only takes minutes and is very satisfying and very tasty. We loved it and so did our guests. Even the men loved it.

I really liked the concept of this but could not figure out from the ingredients or instructions where the caramel sauce came from. I liked Nan's idea for the almond brittle sprinkled on top. This would make a nice presentation with a trace of the sauce swirled on the plate, a dolop of the cream on the peach centers and the brickle sprinkled over all. Caramel sauces vary and it would be nice to know how the cook submitting the recipe created the one used in this recipe.

Thought this was a nice ending to a summer cookout, and with the following addition, it was a sure hit: lightly toasted sliced almonds in a saute pan, added some butter and brown sugar until the mixture came together. Chilled in fridge and then broke up into pieces (resembing brittle), sprinkled over dessert - yum!

We love grilled peaches (nectarines, apricots) but the caramel is only "ok". We much prefer putting about a tablespoon of brown sugar on top of each peach half and drizzling with a little balsamic vinegar. Grill with the cut side up and the grill lid closed for a few minutes. Serve with a big old spoonful of whipped cream! Yum!

Peaches were great with whipped cream, did not like the caramel.

Carmel is good with peaches. I peel and slice peaches,remove excess liquid and place them in an oven proof dish - a nice moulded glass one - whip 1 cup whipping cream and spread over top. Freeze up to two hours. Just before serving, cover totally with layer of brown sugar. Heat under the broiler until brown sugar carmelizes, (about 3 -5 min) Watch it doesn't burn - Delicious Yummy

If you're looking for a really delicious grilled fruit recipe with character and depth of flavor, find the Grilled Nectarine recipe on this site. Its balsamic vinegar and honey glaze may seem unappealing to a novice cook, but its far more delicious and impressive than plain grilled fruit.

I agree with ssmnita@aol.com. Do not ruin the grilled peach taste with something as strong as caramel. I personally serve, after grilling, cut side UP with a scoop of vanilla and drizzled with honey. Not alot but just enough for presentation ( the honey hardens a bit and you can make interesting presentation especially if one colors the honey first) garnish with a fresh sprig of mint.

Being a Georgia peach, I found this different, but not exciting. Grilled peaches, YES. Halve them and then dip in lemon juice and sprinkle with fruit fresh to prevent browning. Sugar is fine. Even a bit of cinnamon is OK, BUT why ruin the taste of the peach with caramel or visa versa. Stick with peaches and vanilla ice cream or whipped cream!
