I've been making this recipe every summer since it was first published in Gourmet in 2000! I entertain with it and it always gets raves from my guests. Can't wait to make it again this summer when fresh corn shows up at the farmers' markets.

really enjoyed this recipe, followed it for the most part, but added diced red bell pepper, and used 2 jalapenos. excellent flavor, will definitely make again.

Okay... i did omit the bacon for the vegitarians, as well as the vinegar and basil (didn't have it). Loved the true, fresh taste of the veggies without the herbs and vinegar. I would make it the same way again (and again...). Easy to make ahead and warm when needed.

We liked this succotash when served warm. However, we loved it the following day when we ate it cold. FANTASTIC!

I substituted edamame for the lima beans and doubled the jalapeno. It's a wonderful summer dish especially when corn is at its peak.

I have never liked succotash, but this recipe changes all of that. The only changes I made to the recipe was switching grape tomatoes for the cherry tomatoes and using two jalapeno chiles. The fresh crunch and in your face taste of this dish will demand that you add this recipe to your recipe box for future meals.
