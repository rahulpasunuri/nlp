I followed the recipe exactly and it came out beautifully. It is a stunning dish, perfect for holiday celebrations or just a fancy dessert.

I tried following this recipe (less all the nuts and lemon) and what I got was a hard, overly sweet and muddy mess, not the clear, neat and delicious cookie my grandma used to make. The trick in getting it right, I think, is in choosing the right kind of honey. My aunt told me that grandma used artificial. Next time I'll try just that.

Unfortunately this came out hard as a rock. I couldn't bite into it. It is alot of work. It was very disappointing.

This dish takes me back to my childhood. I used to wait for the holidays, just so my grandmother would make some Taiglach. It's a bit of work, but it is worth it. Every bite is as good as the first one. You better stack up on milk, because this thing is SWEEEEET.
