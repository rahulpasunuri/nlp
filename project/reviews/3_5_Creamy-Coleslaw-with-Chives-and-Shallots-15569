This is a delicious cole slaw, but be careful not to overdo it on the shallots. They can overwhelm the flavors. I tossed in finely chopped spinach for added color and nutrients.

Amazing! Very fresh. Husband said it's the best one I've made. Likes better than Carolina Coleslaw found on this site. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed.

Good base recipe to which I added / changed the following: Toasted shelled Sunflower seeds, Grated carrots for colour, 1 Tablespoon grainy mustard, put 1/2 cup sour cream instead of 1 cup and added 1/2 cup mayo (used light mayo.I also increased the chives and added some cilantro (can use parsley if you don't like cilantro). The sunflower seeds make it!

This was an excellent cole slaw. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, so I'd probably cut back 1 TBSP on the sugar the next time. But, I'm clearly in the minority on that.

This is one of my signature recipes for bbq's - my friends request that I bring this dish. I make it exactly as written - okay maybe I throw in a little extra shallot. Yummers.

I was expecting more from the rave reviews. It was good but no one asked for seconds... pretty boring.

The creamy dressing is wonderful! I used a little less dressing than called for (we like our coleslaw to have a little more crunch) and it came out perfect. Also substituted fat-free sour cream and mayo to make it a little healthier!

Great recipe, though I cut the sugar in half and added a lot more pepper. I've also tried with 1 lb green, 1 lb red cabbage for bicolor effect----works well too.

I hosted a summer bbq party and the coleslaw was a hit. I'm a fan of coleslaw and this was really good. I used a mixture of red and white cabbage along with shredded carrots to add some colour and taste. Awesome.

I was out of white vinegar, so I substituted unseasoned rice wine vinegar--delicious!

This dish was wonderful!! I'm a personal chef and all 5 of my families loved it and asked for it again. I doubled the pepper (for a little more spice) and chives and it was great. I'll make this one again for sure.

This is an excellent coleslaw. I have made it several times and everyone just raves about it; even my friends who claim they don't eat coleslaw! It's a real winner & great for the summer season!

Quick and easy. If you love dill as much as I do, increase the amount of fresh dill used.

I made this recipe for a BBQ party. It was amazing. The best part is that I had doubled the recipe and had left-overs!!

The dressing was delicious and different- I might double the recipe next time so I can drizzle extra over the top. I worked in a restaurant several years ago that used a similar sauce. I've been trying to duplicate that taste for years and this is the closest I've come.

Great recipe. I find that when time is of the essence - substitute the chopped onion instead of the chives and shallots. Add a little chopped carrot for colour.

simple and delicious. I cut down on the sugar and added a bit more vinegar. Great with barbecued pork.

Excellent recipe. Easy and very delicious. I've made it 5 times this summer and everyone just raves about it. It's a perfect side dish for a bar-b-que. It easly serves 8 people.

It was fun to try but not good enough to make again.
