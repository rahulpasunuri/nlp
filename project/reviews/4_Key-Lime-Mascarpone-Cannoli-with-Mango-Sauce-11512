The taste was excellent. The cannoli shells were a bit problematic. Mine melted into a big mess in the oven. I then came up with the bright idea of putting a ramekin over the big gooey mess to achieve a round shape. Although this worked pretty well I still had trouble bending each round into the cannoli shape. I ended up Putting a round "cannoli" on the side of each plate, piping the filling over one end of the cookie and sticking two leftover wedges of cannoli shells into the filling. I drizzled the mango sauce in between two wedges and sprinkled some fruit around the other side of the cookie. In the end it looked better and was more manageable than a traditional cannoli. There was also plenty leftover mango sauce which I put on the table for people to add.

Excellent base recipe. The mango sauce is good and so is the raspberry sauce or raspberry, starfruit or kiwi on the plate. I bought the shells from Publix. Added semisweet chocolate bites to the cream. Of all the recipes I checked online, I think this one with the mascarpone and cream cheese is the best.

I've made this recipe for a party recently and used mini-cannoli shells. It was a hit (there was nothing left of it) even without the mango sauce. The presentation was just eye catching! Loved it!

Today was my best friend's birthday and I wanted a special dessert. I made the filling for this recipe and it was fantastic. I followed the advice of fellow reviewer and made the orange- pistachio lace cookie recipe also featured on this web site instead of cannoli shell recipe (I used Triple Sec instead of Grand Marnier). I formed the cookies into little tart cups over shot glasses that I covered with a little piece of parchment paper...piped in the filling, topped with whipped cream, drizzled the mango sauce and garnished with a slice of kiwi fruit. If you ever have company you want to wow...make this recipe! You won't be sorry!

I commented earlier about how great this dessert is and that I'd make it again. This has become one of my husband's favorite desserts. I also make it lo-carb by using splenda and not making the shell. I serve the filling as a mousse with fresh berries. I also made the orange almond lace cookies from this site and used that as a shell. Like I said earlier, a dessert worthy of company.

If you don't want to go thru the trouble of making the cannoli shells, try rough crushing some biscotti and drizzling lime filling and mango sauce over.

Stupendous!! The blend of color, flavor and texture is quite phenomenal. The parchment paper is essential for forming the cannoli. The receipe actually makes many more than needed for six people. Once you get the rhythm of making them, it works well, and I agree with one of the other writers' suggestion about using the handle of a wire whisk for a form. Making the filling and the sauce is pretty easy, and the assembly of the dessert was easier and faster than I had anticipated. The mangos that I could find were not very ripe, so I used quite a bit more sugar than called for. With really ripe mangos, the amount called for would be plenty. Bottom line: the riper the mango, the better for the sauce. And it's great that you can make all three elements a day ahead. I got rave reviews! This is a definite keeper of a recipe, and one which will be repeated many times.

This is wonderful as is. For special event desserts, I pipe the filling into tiny phyllo shells, top with small pieces of fruit (raspberries, mangos, kiwi, blueberries, blackberries) sprinkle with lime zest. It is an often requested dessert for showers, weddings and other special events. Adjust cream flavoring to suit fruit or other decorative food used.

The cream filling came out great. The cannoli shells came out more like candy than cookie. Very thin carmelized and fragile. They tasted great but were too delicate. I will make a few changes next time such as adding more flour and only cutting four parchment squares and reusing them, since you can only deal with four at a time. My shells only cooked in 3.5 to 4 minutes, so keep an eye on them. Another tip would be to use the handle of a whisk as the canoli form. The stainless steel is non-stick and just the right size for a 1 tsp shell. Don't waste the time and money buying a form, just in case YOU do not like the recipe, your stuck with it. But all in all the flavor was there, just needs alittle tweaking. Enjoy!!

The "cannoli" shells were a DISASTER using the recipe. TOO SOFT to hold form or shape even after cooled. I ended up adding 8T of flour instead of 2T and it worked MUCH EASIER and held up much better. I also made the shells slightly larger by using 1T of the dough per shell; this allowed me to use a bigger "cannoli form" about 1.25" I didn't have cannoli forms so I improvised and used an empty tube from a roll of paper towel covered with aluminum foil; which worked beautifully. The filling was easy and VERY TASTY. The mango sauce was excellent....I used powdered sugar instead of the superfine sugar (just add a little extra to sweeten to taste) and the results WERE AMAZING! This is not a recipe for beginner cooks or for an instant dessert but it is well worth the effort especially when paired up with a "caribbean" menu!

I have made this several times and each time it has been a major success. I also use the filling for bite size key lime tartlets - perfect for brunch. Just don't overwhip the mascarpone cheese, as someone else said, because it the texture wont be the same. I did this one time and ended up folding it into stiffly whipped cream and putting it in a pie crust!

Wonderful recipe. Very easy to make. I suggest using Reynolds Release if you don't have parchment for the cookies. Only drawback is that the cannoli must be filled right before serving!

Made these for a Carribean theme party, they are the perfect summer dessert and well worth the time and effort. Served with a combination mango and raspberry sauce. WOW!

Wow! This dessert is really impressive. I was going to cheat and bought the cannoli shells from the bakery. As I got to thinking about it, I decided to make the cannoli shells. I'm glad I did. The coconut and brown sugar and butter (LOTS of butter) make a yummy complement to all the other flavors of this dessert. A Tip: Marscapone is fussy and won't respond well to over beating. It will become liquidy so make sure you add the marcapone after every other ingredient is well combined. The texture works well for the crunchy shells and smooth mango sauce. I will definitely treat my guests to this exotic dish. It's all timing but worth every moment.

Its a great receipe. The shells are a bit time consuming but I use the lime mascarpone cream with tarts and other desserts.

I cheated and bought the shells, but store-bought or homemade a fabulous dessert with a spectacular presentation. The real bonus is that it is make ahead. I put some mango sauce sprinkled with coconut on the plate, topped it with one cannoli (large shells) and garnished the plate with starfruit, a small amaretti cookie, and a pirlouette.

Not only are these desserts extremely tasty, they are beautiful with the color contrast of the key lime filling and mango sauce. I served them as the finale at a South Florida-themed dinner party.

Spectacular presentation! Different and delicious. I had one problem tho', I doubled this, as I was serving 10. The mousse just would not set up enough to pipe into the shells. Despite my adding additional cream cheese and gelatin, it just would not set up enough to hold the piped shape. Finally stuck it in the freezer to set up enough for piping into the shells. Any suggestions on how to remedy this would be greatly appreciated, as I do plan to make this again. Suggestions can be emailed to me. Thanks!

I was looking for a key-lime based dessert to take to a dinner party when I stumbled on this recipe. It was a big hit. Making the cannoli shells was a bit tricky the first time and they're very fragile. Since I was going to transport them, I made more than I thought I needed & was glad I did. I'm about to make them again for my birthday dessert--much better than cake!

Cook from Washington State. These are not traditional Italian Cannoli, however, this recipe is fantastic for a gourmet dessert. It is something like a key-lime pie with a cannoli-shaped tube as the crust. I used a raspberry sauce and starfruit for garnish with powdered sugar. It's a great dessert with Thai food. Thanks Epicurious!

Made this and took into work and it got rave reviews. Will definitely make this again.My only problem was that I had no parchment paper- waxed paper WILL NOT, but freezer paper works ok. For the person who had problems with the shells burning- she had best check her oven temp - They need at least 9 minutes. They do get very brown in color, but aren't burnt.

I had no problem with the shells... they were light, crispy, and delicious. Although a bit more work than recipes I usually go for, the results were stunning!

This recipe was incredible. I did cheat a little. I did not have time to make the cannoli shells. So I went to my local bakery and purchased empty shells and filled them. Then I toasted coconut and sprinkled it on the ends of the cannoli. I then swirled the mango sauce on the plate, and added pieces of tropical fruit and sprinkled more toasted coconut....well worth making!

I got lots of wows for this dish. The best thing about the recipe is that everything can be made ahead. All you had to do was assemble it last minute. I also used a small amount of raspberry sauce to drop and swirl in the mango sauce to make the plate pretty. Definitly a keeper.

The recipe for the shells were completely off. I took the shells out of the oven in about 3-4 minutes because they were already burning and than was not able to shape the shells. I was very disappointed in this recipe.
