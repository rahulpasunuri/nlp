Ok it might be a little bland, but it is so good, such a pleasant taste, that it deserves four forks. I used twice as many parsnips, had a smaller cabbage, 8 ounces of marscapone, it came out great. Thank you to all the other cooks who warned me about strict time limits for par boiling, that really helped.

This was pretty good. I cut the vegetables much larger than called for but cooked them for the recommended time to avoid the mushiness others complained of. I used port Salut cheese which was nice but I think it needs more cheese and much more seasoning. I'll probably make it again but seasoned much more liberally, although unfortunately I did not have much of the "broth that accumulates at the bottom" that the recipe note advertises.

I cut this recipe in half - and it fit perfectly into my 2-quart casserole. To avoid mushiness I made sure that the parboiled veggies were spread out while they cooled so that they were fairly dry before assembly - it seemed to work well.

I liked this and I would make it again. My only complaint is that the vegatables were mushy. I think I would cut them slightly thicker next time so that they hold their shape better. The cabbage/Robiola mixture was delicious on its own; I might consider serving it as a side dish. The cabbage leaves folded over made a nice presentation.

The process was a little long, but not difficult. The recipe failed to mention what to do with the onions so I mixed them in with the cabbage while in the saute pan. Probably would have cut back on the cabbage a bit, but overall it was really tasty. The Robiola cheese was a nice addition, however my dish didn't turn out very "creamy". It was more brothy. Still, it added a nice flavor.

The prep work is a little lengthy but well worth it. My dinner guests all asked for second servings, despite one of them not liking cabbage or parsnips!

This was very bland and boring. I used the robiola but cdn't really taste it. there is far too much cabbage called for- didn't use it all. And the casserole dish size is a joke- the whole thing was overflowing. Very uninspiring.

I agree with Robin, a bit of work but worth it! I couldn't find Robiola so I used Marscarpone. I timed the parboil section and didn't have any problems with mushiness. I let my onions carmelize a bit before I added the cabbage because I like the sweetness. Great results! Thanks.

Very yummy--bit of work, but not hard. Served this as part of my Christmas dinner, with pork tenderloin.

I thought this dish was excellent. I've made it several times in the past as part of the Gourmet Christmas menu for 1998, and I've always received rave reviews. As far as the previous reviewer's comment about mushiness, I have found it is very important not to overcook the potatoes and cabbage at the parboiling stage, or it will indeed get mushy. That being said, has anyone made this with robiola cheese? I've always made it with marscapone, but this year I've actually located some robiola and plan to try it. Wondering what the differences are in taste....

I was not pleased with the results. I followed the recipe to the letter (though using mascarpone instead of robiola which I couldn't find). The dish was bland and mushy. Not nice. Also, the recipe calls for a smaller baking dish than is actually needed.

Half the family loved it and half the family thought it was just fine. I found it impossible to get the recipe into the size of casserole indicated!

We had this as part of a new years celebration and it was wonderful. Easy to make ahead, wonderful blend of flavors!
