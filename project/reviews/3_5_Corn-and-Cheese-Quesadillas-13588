Very flavorful and quick! A great summer recipe, especially during the busy work week.

I made these along with "Goat Cheese Quesadillas" and "Chicken and Mushroom Quesadillas" (both from epicurious) and they were all tasty. Great summer dinner or appetizer-I cooked them all on the grill, so the cooking step was part of the fun. Brush 1/2 of tortillas w/olive oil and put oil-side down on baking sheet. Top with whichever filling you're using, then cover with remaining tortillas. Brush top tortilla w/olive oil too. Grill over medium heat (3-4 min.?)or till lightly browned and filling is melty. Tip for turning them: use two large grilling spatulas and flip carefully. The melted cheese will help hold the filling in, but flip quickly to minimize spills.

This isn't spectacular, but it is a simple tasty recipe that is made with ingredients I usually have on hand. I added some black beans and chicken to make it a little more substantial. Also, I grilled my quesidillas on a George Foreman grill. Worked great...toasted both sides (no need for flipping).

Have made this dish several times and love it. I found it easier to to turn the quesadillas if I cut the tortillas in half before putting them under the broiler.

I made this dish when our Gourmet Group served Mexican food and everyone went WILD over these!! Fresh corn off the cob is essential as is lots of cilantro. Enjoy!

Very easy but yummy, everybody liked these. I especially liked the manner of cooking them (in the oven). I used hot pepper jack cheese instead of cheese plus peppers, and fresh frozen sweet white corn.
