I used goat cheese for a tangier flavor and I didn't bother with the mushrooms or chives because I was feeling lazy (though I contemplated shallots). It turned out well overall, but the chicken breast halves took far too long to cook at nearly 40 minutes. I think the skin is nice, but perhaps next time I'll opt for boneless chicken breasts. I did add some breadcrumbs on top of the mustard per another reviewers suggestion and that made for a nice "crust."

This wasn't a big winner in our house. I used fresh spinach vs frozen; the dijon didn't go over well. Doubt I'd make it again.

I thought stuffed chicken would be difficult, but this recipe made it easy. I used tofutti chive cream cheese, red peppers, yellow onion, and garlic because I had no mushrooms. the chive/cream cheese and dijon mustard really blended together nicely. Paranoid often-vegetarians need not worry about cooking the chicken poorly. 23 minutes and a meat-savvy friend helped mine (cage-free, veg-fed) turn out perfectly. Dericious.

I can't believe how many people are afraid of chicken skin. I used actual skin-on, bone-in breast and made it nearly as written. My package of breasts included four large halves, but I made all the stuffing with extra mushrooms. The stuffing was tasty..like spinach pie, only better, and the mustard added a nice flavor. The meat was moist. It did take an extra ten minutes to cook & I broiled for a bit at the end to crispify the skin. I will make this again as it was so cheap ($1/lb chicken), easy, and good.

An easy dish. Per other reviews I used goat cheese, I didn't have cream cheese. It was terrific. Great for a weeknight and for company too. The leftovers were good too.

This is really good. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, so I cut a slit in them and secured the opening with toothpicks. I used green onions, so I used the light green part, too, to add more flavor. I also added just a little bit of salt and pepper. I sprinkled bread crumbs on the top. I will definitely make this again.

For those who don't like mushrooms, leave them out and add to the spinach & cream cheese filling, chopped yellow onion which of course you saute first with the onion and garlic. Just before removing it from the heat, add 1/4 cup of seasoned bread crumbs. I also added 1/2 tsp of cumin which was spectacular with the spinach/cream cheese so it wouldn't be so bland. For the sauce, use WHOLE GRAIN mustard instead of Dijon, along with 1/4 cup honey, 1 TB of lemon juice. Wow, it was good!

I think this was a good recipe but can be great with a few modifications to enhance the flavor. I sautéed mushrooms using extra virgin olive oil rather than butter, added a clove of fresh garlic (minced), and added fresh spinach rather than frozen. I then added cream cheese and added Asiago cheese to the mixture. The results were delicious. I paired the dish with a simple baked acorn squash with butter, ginger, cinnamon and sugar. Although the squash was tasty it was not aesthetically pleasing. I think next time I will scoop out the squash on the side of the dish or make with spaghetti squash.

We were most disappointed with this dish. The ingredients look great, but the combo leaves something to be desired. I added garlic, dill seed and Cavendar's Greek seasoning to the filling, but it still was tasteless. My husband refused to eat it.

This was so good! The stuffing reminded me on a warm spinach dip. I made as directed except I had to bake it about 10 minutes longer.

This is an easy and very tasty dish that lends itself well to improvisation/modification. (That having been said, ignore the previous post from the dolt from NM). I agree that the cheese mixture could use a little kick -- so Bulgarian feta was added (which provided some needed salt and zing). A little freshly ground pepper and a bit of cilantro (which helped coax out more spinachey flavor) and it was a restaurant quality filling. To make things easier, I just pulsed everything (but the chicken, of course!) in the food processor. I gave this three forks as it is written verbatim. With the changes I made, I think it deserved 3 1/2 forks.

Rating: 3
I made this tonight for the first time. Used fresh chives and a mixture of porcini and white mushrooms. Forgot to add the mustard but it still turned out fine. i agree with an earlier opinion that the ingredients make the dish. The freshness of the chives and flavor of the mushrooms carried the dish.

I have made this dish now countless times (my friend's beg me to about every other month). I definitely recommend honey dijon mustard to reg dijon as it adds extra flavor. I think I will try a cheese skin the next time, just for variety. This recipe has definitely become one of my favorites.

We liked this dish very much. I used fresh spinach and just threw it in at the end with the mushrooms. It turned out great and saved a step.

The quality of this recipe is only as good as the ingredients. I brined the breasts, used extra shrooms (1/2 shiitake and 1/2 crimini) and goat cheese. I cooked the breasts for 30 minutes, and they were done just right. The dijon was a nice touch.

Rating: 3
Quite tasty and easy to prepare. I wilted some fresh spinach to use instead of frozen. The taste did lack a little zip for me; next time I will use goat's cheese, or perhaps some feta. Loved the taste, easily adjusted to suit, and looked quite attractive, all those fresh greens bursting from crispy, browned skin. Try it!

Rating: 3
This was fantastic and so quick and easy. I cheated and used the chive and onion cream cheese and just added some extra chives. I also used the boneless skinless chicken breast and cooked covered for 15 minutes then uncovered for the browning effect and it was very moist and delicious. A new favorite.

Rating: 2
I have to agree with another poster that this dish was kind of bland. I added pine nuts, chopped red pepper, and used goat cheese instead of cream cheese. I used the dijon but think it either needs more dijon or a more zippy sauce. I think it might be better w/ pesto. I'll definitely try again.

Rating: 3
Excellent dish, here are my suggestions / modifications: 1. I used fat free cream cheese to cut back on the fat, you could not tell at all. It worked great. 2. If you love mushrooms, I would double the order, I will next time. 3. I think my chicken breasts were much thicker than the recipe used, therefore the cooking time was nearly doubled, keep that in mind. All in all, very simple, affordable, and healthy option that I would make again in a second.

Rating: 2
I wasn't thrilled with the recipe. However, I used skinless breasts (so the lack of fat may have impacted flavor) and had no mushrooms. Still, it has potential. Next time I would use a more flavorful cheese, marscapone would ROCK, or maybe something with bite like goats cheese. The flavors were good, just too cream cheesy for my taste.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious. I prepared and served this dish at a baby shower the other day, and my guests couldn't get enough of the chicken. I did, however, skip the dijon mustard, and I also breaded the chicken. I will be serving this dish again!

Rating: 3
I really love this recipe... I do change it a bit... I add red onions, finely chopped broccoli, feta cheese, and crushed walnuts. I sometimes have to use toothpicks to hold everything together... I also mix the Dijon mustard with honey, which helps to seal in the juices. If you have any of the "stuffing" left over after stuffing your chicken breast pockets, you can mix it with a fresh green salad as a side dish.

Rating: 3
Had I read the other reviews first, I would have had more confidence in my decision to create a "pocket" in skinless chicken breasts when I couldn't find any other kind. I also made a substitution to accommodate a vegetarian guest. For her, I lightly oiled a portabello mushroom, spread the mustard on the underside, and topped it with the spinach "stuffing". Both versions were delicious and very well received.

Rating: 3
I gave 3 forks, but I am stingy with my ratings... I really enjoyed this dish and it was so easy to make. Though, I did cheat and use cream cheese with chives & onions (pre-mixed) and then I just cut a pocket in boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I also omitted the dijon spread and tossed the stuffed chicken in a bread crumb mixture with spices and parmesean. It was good enough for a casual dinner for 2 or 4. This recipe made it into my recipe book.

I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts pounded to 1/8 inch. I used yellow onion instead of green. Seasoned with black pepper and garlic salt. Placed mixture in middle of breast and wrapped around securing w/ toothpick. Brushed w/dijon. Baked approx. 23 minutes. Delicious.

Rating: 3
Delicious! I used honey dijon mustard instead of regular dijon. Also, the bake time should be extended by about 10 minutes in order for the chicken to be fully cooked. Other than that, a very good recipe. I will try it with mozz cheese on top next time as suggested by one reviewer.

Rating: 3
Three forks after I modified a bit. Used boneless, skinless breasts, piled the spinach mix on top, and used a thin slice of cheese over top as the "skin". I used mozzerella, but I'm sure pretty much any mild cheese would suffice. Also added sauteed garlic and onion (threw in w/the shrooms). Added half the amount of dijon called for. Pretty easy. Could prob. get away with using lowfat cream cheese, y'know, if you follow one a dem low fat diets or sumpin'.

Rating: 3
I tried to make it lower in fat, so I sauteed the mushrooms in a little olive oil instead of butter. I also used low-fat ricotta instead of cream cheese. I pounded boneless skinless breasts flat and wrapped it around the filling, pinning with toothpicks. Baked for about 25 minutes. Good, but lacked a certain punch. I'll have to add some garlic and onion to the saute pan next time.

Rating: 2
I was silly and brought fresh spinach at the store: obviously a large mistake. This was very good, but I would most definitely double the cooking time if you are using large breasts. I took mine out at the suggested time, and after a few pokes served them up. They were raw on the inside(and I started with refrigerated chicken too). Had to put them in for at least 15 minutes more. Granted, they were large, but geez. That's why I have to give this 2 forks, because I never want to accidentally eat raw chicken again.

Very good, and definitely a keeper. But like others, I made some modifications. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, and cut pockets in them. I also cooked three strips of bacon, and crumbled them into the stuffing. The result was delicious!

Great recipe. I followed the advice of reviewers before and pounded boneless skinless chicken breasts, rolled the filling up and held with toothpicks. I think next time I will cut a slice down the middle instead and let the filling ooze over the top rather than out the sides.

Rating: 3
I would give this 4 forks, but I made a few changes so the recipe itself may not quite have made the full 4. I also saute garlic with the mushrooms and didn't have cream cheese but used a soft herbed Havarti insteand and drizzled some olive oil around the base of the chicken before it went into the oven. Also used boneless/skinless and rolled up.

Rating: 4
I make this recipe often as it has become a family favorite. I use boneless, skinless chicken breasts but instead of pounding flat I insert a knife in the centre of the breast creating a channel and stuff the mixture in there. So I sometimes open a hole in the side, it's not a runny mixture so you don't have to worry about it leaking out.

Rating: 3
This recipe was very easy to follow and delish on top of that. I used garlic to saute the mushroom and made sure to season the chicken breast heavily. Using the chicken breast halves instead of the boneless breat (and rolling) saves on a lot of time to me for a midweek meal. My husband loved it too. I will definitely make this again

Rating: 4
I also used boneless breast and put the stuffing in the middle and rolled them up. I first dipped the chicken in egg and milk mixture, then coated outside with flavored bread crumbs. I added the garlic which spiced it up. Everyone really enjoyed these and I will definitely make again. I think next time I may add some feda cheese to spice it up a bit.

I would make it, but would change it by omitting the cream cheese. I think a little olive oil would be nice instead. I was lured by the many 4 fork ratings to try it, but I just didn't care for the cream cheese and chicken combo

I did roll and stuff the chicken breast. There was extra stuffing so I smeared it over the top and then added the mustard. My guests thought it was great. I did use both chives and green onions and it gave it a good flavor. There was extra so I preheated the food in the oven with a flavored chicken broth in the pan. It was great.

This recipe is fabulous! I made it on a busy week night and we were surprised at how good it was. I took a shortcut and used chive cream cheese instead of fresh chives. I also used the light brand and the consistency was great. I usually don't like recipes the first time around, but this is a definite keeper!

I have made this recipe several times for various friends. I usually omit the mushrooms, and add a small amount of milk to the pan to keep chicken moist during baking. Also I use honey-dijon mustard instead, and it is always a crowd pleaser, even among the younger ones.

Let me preface this review by noting I am very stingy about giving 4 forks - thus the 3 fork rating. Like others before me, I used boneless, skinless chicken breast, pounded flat, with the stuffing rolled inside. I rolled the chicken in flour before browning in melted butter prior to putting the (same) pan in the oven. After the chicken was cooked (about 10 more minutes)I put the chicken onto the plates and then deglazed the pan with a splash of white wine. I'm glad I did - the sauce added a lot of flavor. In the same vein, when I make this again (and I intend to), I will salt and pepper the chicken prior to rolling it in flour. Other revisions to the written recipe: I omitted the mustard. I used the green onion tops, used 1 1/2 tablespoons of cream cheese (all I had) and substituted freshly grated parm. cheese for the remainder. Also, I added 2 pressed garlic cloves and a splash of white wine to the mushroom saute. Oh, and chopped Fresh Spinach rather than frozen (it was on sale this week). The filling was very tasty. With a little salt and pepper and a bit more sauce from deglazing the pan this will be a 4-forker for sure!

My hubby and I have on a low carb diet and this worked into that fine. It was delicious although I didn't have cream cheese and used some ricotta mixed with cottage cheese and a couple tablespoons of grated cheddar. Very tasty. I would, however, recommend cooking longer than 20 minutes; we cooked it 35 minutes, due to the extra thickness and it was just done. My 13 yr old son asked me to keep this recipe and be sure I make it again!

made this tonight, delish! I followed some others before me, and had to make do with no cream cheese. I used a couple of tablespoons of marscapone (all I had), added 4 cloves of garlic and some white wine to the mushroom saute, and a little each of parmesean and romano cheese. Then dredged the tied, stuffed, pounded chicken breasts in flour, sauted in butter until brown on both sides, then finished in the oven. Deglazed pan with white wine, and added that to the pan juices just before serving. B'friend said "better than any restuarant". Was terrific! Thanks to all who helped make this moment possible!

This was excellent!! I took some liberty with the recipe. Used fresh spinach; 8 oz cream cheese (instead of 6); 3 cloves of garlic and some fresh nutmeg and parmesian. Eliminated the mustard. Used boneless breasts; pounded them & stuffed with above and rolled. I then freeze them for about 45 minutes and then brown them in heavy fry pan in butter. Put them in a baking dish with pan drippings on top and bake at 400 convect 15 - 20 minutes. I served this with fresh green beans braised in chicken stock and topped with browned almonds.

Great recipe....what I love about this site is the input from cooks who have "been there, done that" and I benefit from their experiences. We very much liked the recipe for the wonderful flavors that come together, and the moist quality of the chicken. Chicken skin is not in our diet, but this time, keeping the skin during cooking time created a superbly moist meat. We simply removed the skin before devouring the stuffed chicken. I incorporated all of the suggestions from the cooks. Thank you!

Great dish. And I agree, don't leave out the mustard. Brush the chicken breast with it or it will look so pale and unappetizing. I also added some bacon bits into the filling, giving it a little twist in texture and flavor. My children loved it and had to serve them a whole breast each.

I used skinless breasts and pounded them until they were uniform in thickness...then I simply placed the filling on them and folded them over. They cooked beautifully! I also added garlic (as suggested above). To minimize the breasts drying out I dredged them in seasoned flour, skipping the dijon. This resulted in a crunchy coating and moist meat!

This was so easy and tasty. My husband said that this is a "keeper". I used boneless skinless breasts and stuffed the spinach mixture inside a pocket I had cut into the breast. I also used Boursin cheese for added flavor. I served over some egg noodles. Instead of Dijon, next time I will used more Boursin cheese on top. The dijon added one too many flavors into the dish. It was tasty, but didn't really belong in the dish.

I'm a college student with Sam's card. Buy a big bag of chicken breasts, and make this recipe over and over again. I don't use the mustard, and lay chicken on a bed of rice. Also I use Boursin cheese w/ herbs instead of cream cheese. Stuffed Chicken... Holding it down for the broke students.

Liked it, but thought it was a little bland. I had skinless chicken at home, so I had to make a cut in the breast and sew in the stuffing, which, surprisingly, was very easy to do.

I pounded skinless, bonless chicken breasts flat, put stuffing in the middle, turned in all sides of chicken and turned over, tucking in sides. Some needed to be tied. Then I rolled gently in a flour, salt and pepper mixture to keep chicken moist and baked. Basting 1/2 way through. It was fabulous! Made for a dinner party and served with rice.

I only had 3 bonless-skinless chicken breasts not the 6 breasts w/ skin & bone. Except for using 3 bonless skinless breasts and cuting a pouch vs. stuffing under skin, I stayed w/ orignal recipe. Family loved it!! Will cook for guests. Makes a rich recipe when doubling the amout of stuffing per chicken. Served with rice.
