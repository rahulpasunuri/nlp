I made this as written but with a little fresh dill added. Could probably use a little more lemon too, but I was out. My husband and I loved it, as did our 3 yr. old granddaughter. The 10 yr olds not quite so much.

I made this recipe as described, but did add extra lemon as suggested. It was not anything that either my husband nor I would lick the plate for, nor make again. Don't waste your time on this recipe. UGH!

This was a little hard on my husband's digestive system but we both loved it. I accidentally bought cilantro instead of Italian parsley -- but it was fine. It does make waaaayyy to much for two people. Funny how cottage cheese was so popular in the late 1960s/early 1970s and now no one (no one I know anyway) thinks of eating it.

If your man likes this salad, you have accidentally married a woman. Please contact the county marriage license bureau or clerk's office immediately for an annulment.

This is a great change from cole slaw. It goes very well with anything from the grill. We love this salad and it is even good the next day.

I was intrigued by the name of the recipe when I first saw it in the 65th anniversary issue - since then, I've made it tons of times and love it - but I'm a woman!! The only thing I've noticed is that it makes a TON - I used half the cabbage it said to use, with other amounts the same. Maybe the cabbage heads I'm buying are super big. Have made this so many times that I almost have the recipe memorized. Don't read the bad reviews of this recipe - they are WRONG!!

This is a big hit in our house, and pairs really well with some good bbq. We prefer to use red onion and red cabbage - more vitamins and a nicer presentation.

Neither the men nor the women enjoyed this salad tonight. I followed the recipe exactly and still had an almost full bowl by the end of the night.

I must admit that I tried this because it's so retro. I updated it slightly - I use crumbled goat milk feta, just enough mayo to moisten, vidalia onion, and a little extra lemon juice. This has become a staple in our household - easy to make and I often make it when I need to take something for a summer pot luck. People RAVE about it and always ask for the recipe. I've never tried it with cottage cheese, but I might someday.

Added a little extra lemon. I like the creaminess the cottage cheese gives.

Made this for a Super Bowl party and received many compliments. I did use extar Duke's mayo (which is a bit tangy).

I have a house full of coleslaw lover's so I was anxious to make this dish. It was delicious! Just be careful with the salt, the cottage cheese I purchaed was very salty. I will deffinately make this again.
