This turkey turned out superb -- moist, flavorful, and beautiful in color. I did adjust the temperature down to 325 deg. for a portion of the cooking, (my oven seems to be running a bit hot recently) but you can't go wrong with that maple herb butter. I too was worried about the sweetness of the gravy (to the point where I added in a little lemon juice and more salt to finish it.) The family however, just gobbled it up and practically drank the gravy. 3 cheers for this new family favorite.

An absolute keeper. I didn't think anything could dethrone the herb roasted turkey with shallots but this is my new go to recipe. I was concerned people would think the gravy was too sweet but everyone raved and asked for this again for Christmas. I didn't use the neck or giblets or celery and did add some shallots for about half the onions. The apple brandy would probably be nice but didn't have any. May add more maple for the butter rub since I didn't really taste it. Fabulous, fabulous.

I have been using this same recipe for 7 years and I make it for both Thanksgiving and Christmas. My family won't let me change the menu because it tastes so good! I have people tell me that even when they don't really like turkey, they love this! Had to come to website today to make a copy of recipe for my best friend.

Excellent turkey! I cooked everything in an oven bag with the breast side down but otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I wouldn't change a thing. Everyone loved it and the turkey came out so moist. The gravy was amazing too. It's definitely sweeter than traditional gravy but not overly sweet. Just be generous with the salt when making the cider/syrup reduction. This recipe is a keeper!

It's my first time experimenting on a whole turkey and I have to say this a great recipe. The white meat was so moist. My husband can't stop eating. Worked really well with the suggested stuffing. Will be making this when it's time to impress guests! Happy thanksgiving Canada!

I made only the flavored butter component of this recipe, then rubbed it both under and over the skin of my turkey. I used a different roasting method (Cooks Illustrated Nov. 2006- I highly recommend this recipe, as it calls for icing down the breast for an hour before roasting, preventing dry or overcooked breast meat). I've made this a few times before and it's always fabulous. I made some modifications, including subbing homegrown oregano for the marjoram and adding some fresh rosemary. I noticed at least one previous reviewer thought it had too much lemon zest, but I disagree. I love the lemon flavor, which is quite prominent, especially in the skin. I will continue to use this recipe or at least a play on it every year at Thanksgiving.

The ultimate. My guest list keeps increasing year after year -- I'd like to think it's because of the company, but it just might be that the word is out on the stuffing! Somewhat time consuming to make, but worth every single minute. I'm trying not to cry as a see my leftovers rapidly diminishing...

Okay this is crazy b/c I have made this every year as well and actually the last couple of years I have become vegetarian and I have made a Tofurkey version but also regular version for my turkey loving friends and it is ALWAYS a hit. I am giggling seeing that so many have made this recipe since it was first published in 94 like me (and I agree that issue was the best ever!). I get tempted to try something different but always return to this recipe!

I echo the raves! I am right now boiling down the maple syrup and apple cider...I have used the recipe since it came out in 1994. I've varied amounts, especially more maple syrup (I don't measure, just eyeball it!) and it is resilient. No doubt the combination of butter and the character of the reduced syrup preserve the moisture of the bird. It has been a hit at parties and with family. Probably the best turkey recipe ever! It is unuaual enough that people still remember me for "that guy with the Maple Turkey!"

This, as well as almost ALL of the recipes from November '94 BA are the best! I have used so many of the recipes from that issue, and treasure it; I've not seen an issue since (BA,Gourmet,etc) that hit so many recipes so well

Rating: 4
I too have made it every year since it was first published in 1994. It just amazes my friends, and produces a very moist bird. I've played with some of the parameters and I have become very liberal with the Maple Syrup (I'm addicted...I lived in Vermont for a few years!). The only moister bird would be a brined one, but you don't get the saltiness you do with that method, plus what I feel is a kind of blandness. Highly recommended!

Rating: 4
I have made this Turkey almost every year since Bon Appetit published this recipe. I recommend to the chef below to tent the turkey to keep the juices from evaporating so quickly. Also I like to bake the turkey breast side down for an hour or two. I find this causes the breast to be more tender and juicy. I have make all the other Turkey recipes in this particular 1994 BA, and although good, I keep returning to this recipe. The thyme and lemon zest along wtih the apple flavor are definate keepers

Wonderful flavor!

Beginners here, never roasted a turkey before. Brined turkey. Doubled the maple butter portions as others have recommended. Put apples under the skin with the maple butter and marinated overnight. We had a good quarter of the maple butter leftover and were afraid to use all of it for fear the flavor would be too strong. During roasting, we took the turkey out every half hour to baste. We found the stock in the bottom of the pan was getting quickly dried out and was not replaced by turkey juices. By the time we realized it, vegetables in the pan were a little burnt. Next time we would watch the juices in the bottom of the pan more carefully and add water as needed to keep it liquidy. As for the maple butter, the turkey had a nice flavor but it was quite subtle, so next time we will definitely use all of our double portion of maple butter generously to bring out the flavor. More apples wouldn't have hurt. Our turkey thigh never hit 180 degrees, it only got to 170, but we took it out after 3 hours anyway and the meat was not dry. We also did the sausage with apple and cranberry stuffing which was excellent. A good first try for us, we hope next time will turn out even better!

Rating: 4
I make this turkey every year...my family LOVES it... the maple butter & seasonings are a must...I do just what it says and rub the butter under the skin & all over the outside..(to answer the previous poster...no brining is needed) One typo that this recipe has is this...you reduce the maple butter mixture to one half of what it is orginally (not 1/2 cup, you wouldn't have enough ...1/2c & 1/4c needed for the bird)

We're beginners. This recipe does not indicate the turkey should be brined or that you should use a kosher turkey. Does anyone know?

This is a great recipe which I pair with the Sausage Apple Cranberry Stuffing from this site. I have been making it for at least six years and always get rave reviews. The first time I made it, it seperated, but now I simply boil down the liquids and add slowly to creamed butter, then add the herbs later. I have used this with chicken as well, and made a compound butter of pancetta lemon and herbs for chicken which my husband just loves! Thanks Epicurious for making me look like a star!

Rating: 4
Very similar to recipe on NBC's Today show. I stuff the turkey with apples and even slide them under the skin. Gives it a great flavor. The carrots cooked with the turkey are always a big hit, so I make sure there are plenty. Always made basting the day of, usually an hour before, and it's always been fine. The easier the better! Everyone always claims it's the best turkey they ever had. Apples and maple syrup are the key!!!

This was an exellent turkey , and the drippings and maple butter made great gravy. Everyone loved it. I would definitely make this again.

First, let me say the gravy and recommended dressing are excellent. The turkey, however, not so great. The skin of the turkey completely browned and nearly burned in the first instructed half-hour(the oven is fairly new). And the turkey was not moist, but admittedly, I fear salmonella and always add a little extra time. I have also tried the Maple Glazed Roasted Turkey with Mixed Herb Gravy also on this site and it is far superior. In the future, I will adapt that recipe with this gravy and dressing.

This year will be number 2 in a long list of years to come. This recipe is awesome and received tremendous compliments last year. I stuffed the turkey with apples, a trick I learned on the Today show and hands down, the best tureky I have ever had. Think its the apples and maple syrup combo. To make it easier I stir in all the maple butter ingredients, boil and just use right away. No need to marinate for 2 hours!

I have been making this turkey recipe for the last 5 years and would not even consider trying another. This recipe is awesome!!! I have received so many compliments over the years, I just sit back and smile. The only thing I do different is I immediately marinade (over and under the skin) the turkey with the butter the night before. Again, the taste is out of this world.

Very good! The maple butter was delicious by itself (I'm tempted to make it again, minus the herbs, and experiment with yeast breads), and made for a yummy, moist bird. Father-in-law, a paraplegic stroke victim with a vocabulary of maybe a dozen words, kept saying, "OK! OK!" as he helped himself to yet another slice of breast meat.

I agree with the last person. The flavor of the maple and herbs didn't come through as much as I would have liked. Also, the gravy was weird. I missed the deep turykey flavor that you can get with the drippings that stick to the bottom of the pan. I would try a different recipe next time.

This turned out great. The meat was very juicy and tender. I had to use apple juice instead of cider, since cider was nowhere to be found. I also didn't have any apple brandy, so I just used plain brandy. I served it with Midwestern whole wheat stuffing with dried fruit, and the combination was delectable.

Extremely moist and delicious. Even the pickiest eaters went back for seconds. I did not add the apple brandy to the gravy and it was still a huge hit. I doubled the maple butter as someone suggested -- it was way too much for the roasting but is yummy for heating up leftovers. A DEFINITE hit with all guests, and a keeper!!!

Rating: 3
I have some doubts about covering the bird for most of the cooking time. I suspect that was the reason behind the leathery skin of my bird. Yet I suppose it needs to be covered to prevent burning due to the sugar (maple) content of the butter. Fortunately, the skin looked great and few people eat skin anymore anyway...

I've made this turkey 4 years out of the last 6. Today I found that I lost my prized recipe and thankfully found it on this website!!

I made this recipe the first year my husband and I were married and my parents were visiting as well (my mother is a fabulous cook and I was a bit nervous). The maple herb butter gave this turkey a wonderful flavor and the gravy (which I made with bourbon and apple cider) was incredibly unique and tasty. I have made it every year since - and my mother now asks me to do the turkey when we are together!

Absolutely fabulous! I first made this as a new bride three Thanksgivings ago - I had scoured Epicurious for all the recipes for the dinner and was delighted with every one of them. I don't normally care for gravy but I would drink this one from a spoon. A suggestion - make and use twice the amount of maple butter for the turkey itself (not the gravy). It really infuses the bird with the maple flavor. Finally, I would also recommend both the cranberry sauce and the Stilton blue potatoes found in the holiday recipe section - great with this turkey!

Rating: 3
I have made this turkey several times and it IS excellent...with a word of caution. It is NOT traditional. As the cook from Chicago pointed out, the gravy is very sweet and not at all like traditional Thanksgiving turkey gravy. So if you're looking for a traditional roast turkey flavor for Thanksgiving then this is not the recipe for you. I would strongly sugggest trying it later in the year when palates are more adventurous and open to change. It is a wonderful recipe and the aroma is to die for!

This is the only turkey I'll ever make. Have made it twice with great results both times. The second time, I soaked a cheese cloth in melted butter and covered the turkey with it while it roasted. It made the turkey even more moist and beautiful. The gravy is the best I've ever tasted. I typically don't care for gravy but I'd drink this stuff through a straw!!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and was a little disappointed. The turkey looked great and tasted delicious, but the gravy was just too sweet. A little sweetness is fine but on Thanksgiving there is a tendancy to put the gravy on the dressing and the mashed potatoes as well as the turkey. I also made the traditional yams with maple syrup and butter so it was one big sugar fest -- not quite what I had intended.

The turkey was good, although a little uninteresting. The gravy was very good and easy to prepare, but I would put less fresh herbs in it next time. The recipe called for 3 Tlb. which was definitely too much.

I felt alittle let-down by this recipe. The maple herb butter under the skin didn't pack the punch I was expecting. If I had known I might have doubled the butter recipe to have more to baste the turkey with while it was roasting. It did make a tasty gravy. I would recommend the accompanying stuffing recipe though.

I thought this turkey was delicious. My maple herb butter did not separate in the fridge. I brined the turkey in a gallon of water, 1/2 cup kosher salt, and 1/2 cup brown sugar overnight. I also roasted it 2/3rd of the time breast down, and turned it over the last 1/3rd of the time. It came out extremely moist. As far as the taste, it was a wonderful blend of slightly different yet traditional, and certainly a gourmet dish. I'll be making this again and again.

This is an excellent recipe.The gravy is particularly good especially when made with real turkey stock. We used a free range, organic bird. To keep the it moist we brined it for 24 hours.We roasted it as Cook's Illus. recommends: breast side down 400 for 1hr; 250 for 1-3/4 hr; breast side up 400 for 1-1/4 hr or until done.

My husband and friends named this their favorite turkey yet. The gravy, with its rich maple-butter aroma, was absolutely scrumptuous. A note to cooks with convection ovens: decrease the oven temperature to about 325 ~ 350, and keep the foil on until the last 20 minutes. The sugar content in the maple glaze burned to a black crisp within the first half hour! Also, I only used about half of the maple butter I made...

I really don't care for turkey. It has always been bland and dry in the past. This was my first Thanksgiving and my family wanted turkey. I found this recipe and it was excellent. I love this website! This turkey was so flavorful and moist, even the white meat! One thing I added was injecting the meat. I made an extra batch of the herb butter. Before it cooled completely, I injected the bird and let it marinate for a day. I will make this turkey again and again!

My friend and cooking partner both have made this several times and everyone who has been fortunate to taste this dish have all loved it! We have followed the recipe exactly as stated, the only thing additional we have done is got a meat injector and used the juices throughout the cooking to inject directly in the turkey(usually every 45 min or so)we felt it made the turkey even more flavorful and juicy.

Absolutely sublime! This recipe is beyond "four forks"... it is simply the very best turkey I've ever had, and my dinner guests agreed. The Maple Herb Butter makes the meat buttery & sweet. I was able to get about 4 cups of drippings from the (fresh) bird, taking some from the pan every half hour or so. I didn't need to use chicken stock - to be a purist, I was only going to use homemade turkey stock anyway, otherwise the flavor wouldn't be the same. The gravy was divine even though I didn't use brandy because it was already quite sweet from the maple syrup. I also stuffed the bird with chopped onion, carrot and celery stalks, to roast for the drippings. Enjoy!
