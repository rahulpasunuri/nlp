I don't understand what all the rave reviews were about. I followed the recipe, and it was edible, but far from good. It was bland and boring. Very disappointed.

Used this recipe to break in my new dutch oven. It was a huge hit! Went with brown rice instead of noodles and beef broth because I grabbed the wrong can out of the cabinet. I don't think either sub hurt the recipe at all. Will definitely be making it again.

Turned out excellent! I made it just how the recipe stated other than swapping the shiitake mushrooms for brown(no shiitake at the grocery store). Very happy with this recipe and the pork turned out very flavourful and tender. This would also work with rice as well, which I will try next time. Highly suggest this one.

Delicious and very satisfying--anything with pork, ginger and scallions/green onions makes my day. I had to hunt down a recipe for hoisin sauce (is there one on the site?)and I used dried shiitake mushrooms that I had on hand.

This was so delicious that I ate the leftovers for breakfast. The only thing I changed was the pork shoulder. I only had pork chops, so I cut the meat off the bone and cubed it. Did everything else exactly as written in the recipe and it was so very tasty!

Really delicious. I used country ribs and served it with rice noodles. I think the cut of meat is important- it needs to have enough fat to stand the long slow cooking. Will definitely make it again.

This type of recipe is so great for a weeknight because it is very good as written, but lends itself to lots of variations on the protein (chicken thighs?) and the vegetables. Husband loves it, picky kids like it. Great quick, nutritious weeknight meal!

These flavors were very well balanced. I was nervous about the 5 spice, but needn't have been. It is a bit laborious, but the thought occurred to me: What if I prepped and put in the...dare I say it...crockpot? Then you could come home, chop the beans (I also added garlic and red bell pepper), prep the pasta, and have a quick weekday meal.

I have made this several times, frequently substituting and always comes out great. I've used olive oil, Gilroy Farms minced ginger, and regular Chinese noodles (available in my local supermarkets) and various meats. The latest was chicken sausage, which was very good. I eliminated the sesame oil at the end, just for calorie considerations. I want to try a vegetarian style with tofu crumbles, and vegetable broth. THese substitutions keep it from being "authentic" but excellent everyday eaters.

Would almost give 4 forks but it's hard to say it's "beyond compare". It IS really really delicious though. We loved it and it is definitely worth making as written; the cooking time was exactly right and on the whole the recipe is very easy. Extremely tasty, the five spice flavor was not overly pronounced nor was the hoisin - it all melded together beautifully. We will absolutely make this again (and we don't make too many things twice in this house!)!

This is a great recipe. I didn't know what was meant by the "rounds" of ginger, but I think I put in more than the recipe called for. Anyway, it's delicious. I'll serve it on chinese egg noodles, with an Asian type of salad on the side.

Great flavour...but in order to like this dish you do have to enjoy the chinese 5 spice. I made with just white mushrooms (what I had on hand) and served with white sticky rice. I also increased the amount of ginger (just used minced out of jar).Next time I'll try asparagus and maybe some snow peas.

Awesome! I loved this dish...especially considering it's pretty easy to make...definitely use the Chinese 5 Spice seasoning -- it's wonderful. Definitely use pork butt (TONS of flavor). Substitutions I made: peanut oil for vegetable oil, frozen green beans for fresh, couscous tossed with sesame oil instead of egg noodles (gotta use what you've got). I think the braise should be cooked a MINIMUM of 50 minutes, but another 30 or so would just continue to tenderize the meat. Perfect to reheat when it is way too cold out there...

Excellent and easy for entertaining "Family style"

I'm sorry to say this after so many great reviews, but I have to go along with one of the first reviews. The 5-spice powder did give the dish an odd flavor. We threw it out and ordered pizza. But this is our personal opinion. We just didn't care for the 5-spice powder.

Very good dish. As a diffrent reviwer called it "comfort food". I am making it for the forth time. the only thing I changed was I have used egg noodles instead of linguine.

Update: yes, I made this again with much better results. Used pork shoulder rather than tenderloin, added lime juice/zest, 3 cloves garlic, doubled the ginger, lots of fresh ground pepper, revised mushrooms to mix of white/shiitake/porcini and subbed asparagus for the green beans, garnished with toasted sesame seeds and minced cilantro. Really enjoyed it this time and will make again with these changes. Initial comments March/02: Good but probably not good enough to make again. Used pork tenderloin, otherwise followed the recipe. Had to increase chicken broth to 2-1/2 cups in order to have enough sauce. My husband and house guests loved it, I wasn't that impressed. However, I was asked for the recipe, so maybe my taste buds are just harder to please.

I make this recipe regularly -- my husband and my 4-year-old son love it, and it is just as appropriate for company as it is for family. Try it over mashed potatoes instead of noodles sometime for a real treat. It reheats beautifully.

I definetly would make this again. Husband and toddler loved it. I was pregnant when I made it and it was easy on the digestion. Great comfort food and I wouldn't change a thing.

Great dish!!!! Family loved it. I will definately make it again.

This needs to be made according to the recipe using a piece of pork than can stand to be cooked for awhile. It is in the style of Red Cookery in China.. that is stews braised for a period of time using blends of spices. If you use tenderloin or chicken, the meat will cook and dry out long before the flavors have a chance to meld. Five Spice powder is a unique flavor, a combination of cinnamon, star anise, fennel, cloves and a hint of pepper.. a complez spice that gives this dish its unique flavor. It is not hot. Make this dish verbatim and you won't be sorry. Its a lot simpler and evey bit as good as some more complex recipies for a similar dish.

very good. didn't have pork so substituted chicken and reduced the cooking time. added cashew nuts at the end.

This was really good. I used butterfly pork chops, regular onion, pea pods, regular linguini and added shredded carrots. I was unable to find the Chinese five spice powder in my grocery market, so I added some cayenne and paprika. It worked out beautifully. Next time I'll add more vegetables and use another type of pork. My husband raved about it.

This dish is fantastic! I wouldn't change anything about this recipe.

I made this recipe exactly as directed, but used pork loin. It was so tasty, and fun to make. My husband and I could not stop eating it...after the two of us were done, there was barely a cup of noodles leftover. Definitely use the fresh linguine, it makes a difference.

I used pork tenderloin and didn't cook for quite as long as the recipe said since tenderloin doesn't need as much time. Also used sugar snap peas and some bok choy as they were the green vegetables I had on hand. Served with rice, since that's what I had on hand too. My husband pronounced it delicious.

We loved this but next time I will start with 1 tsp. of five spice. I may add more as the pork simmers but it was a snick heavy with 2 tsp. This is addicting! I wok'd up Chinese noodles to make them crispy, added onion, red pepper and garlic - really good.

This dish was delicious and was even better reheated as leftovers. I served it over rice. The whole family enjoyed it, especially our 10-yr old, who usually will only eat his rice without a sauce on it.

This is the second time I have made this dish and both my husband and I found it to be fantastic. I used broccoli instead of green beans this time and preferred it. I plan to make this the next time I have company.

This dish was very heavy. The flavors were a little muddy, nothing sparkled. I left out the beans and substituted blanched bok choy, but I don't think that it changed the overall character of the dish.

I've made this dish twice. The first time, the novelty of it made it special, and my husband and I enjoyed the flavors. The second time, we decided it wasn't that spectacular, and therefore not a keeper. I agree that the pork was very tender when cooked this way. I plan to use this braising technique again, modifying the seasonings and vegetables a bit.

Used beef instead of pork, same effect.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe finding it to be an interesting combinations of flavors. The pork was really tender and there was plenty of sauce for the noodles. I agree with the reviewer regarding the sesame oil - it adds additional interest. Be sure and take the ginger out before serving!

we liked this because it was different. Not thrilling but another option on the age old "What's for dinner?". I would try broccoli instead of the green beans next time.

This is a wonderfully tasty dish. I have made it several times with raves from everyone. Be sure to add the sesame seed oil to the pasta in the already warm pot - the nutty aroma and flavor is greatly intensified.

I've made this twice now and both my husband and I really enjoyed it. We too liked the flavor of the chinese 5 spice. The second time I made it, I varied the recipe my using broccoli instead of green beans, and used rice in lieu of the pasta.

I really enjoyed this dish. I thought the five spice made it more exotic and was a wonderful compliment to the hoisin sauce. It would be lovely with chicken and beef as well.

If you're a fan of Chinese Five-Spice Powder you may like this dish. However, we thought it conveyed a very odd flavor to this dish--we didn't like it at all--had to disguise it with lots of soy sauce. On the other hand, the rest of the ingredients were great. I might try making this again and substituting something more palatable for the 5 Spice Powder.
