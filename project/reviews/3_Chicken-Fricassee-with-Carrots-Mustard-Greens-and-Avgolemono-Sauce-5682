I just made a coup that has most of the ingredients in it and it is really great with no effort. Complex and earthy flavor. I use baby mustard greens for a little more mellow flavor and ginger for more heat.

I am of Greek descent on my mother's side, & having grown up in a house where mustard greens, avgolemono, garlicky-lemony greens and complex,savory meals were the norm, I was thrilled when I came across this recipe... So I had to try it. I followed the recipe exactly, and the result was, in my biased opinion, fabulous. The balance of the creamy avgolemono mellows the bite of the mustard greens. Still, I think that this is not a recipe for those who do not really like or have not developed an affinity for bitter greens.

This was good and unusual. It does take significant prep time (and uses lots of pots) and I thought some of the ingredients got lost (the dill) while others were unnecessary (the mustard and spring onions). It was also difficult to achieve a nice presentation. In the end I couldn't bear to mix the great avgolemono in with the greens so I served it on top of the chicken. I used spinach instead of mustard greens (couldn't find them). Unlike some other reviewers, I did not find it too lemony or bitter at all. Lemon is after all a natural partner with spinach, carrots and chicken. I expect the leftovers will taste even better.

This recipe did take quite a bit of time to make, but was delicious! If you love lemon, you'll love this. I served it to company and they were quite impressed. I used fresh baby spinach instead of the mustard greens, and it worked great. I am going to try again and take a few shortcuts.

I needed to use up a whole chicken I had frozen and I came across this recipe. The recipe sounded interesting, but what struck me even more were the three reviews by other cooks. It did not seem reasonable to have one great and two terrible. In the words of the cook from Dallas. "I wholeheartedly agree with," Tara, the cook from Lodi. I did not have any mustard greens so I used fresh collard greens. The meal was excellant and my only regret is that I did not take Tara's suggestion and make some rice to go with the meal. The sauce is very special and well worth the effort to prepare it. Despites the rather long preperation procedure the recipe is rather easy to put together. If you're not a lemon fan, you probably would want to find another way to cook your chicken and greens. If you like flavorful citrus, try this recipe and make the rice to go with it.

I wholeheartedly agree with the cook from PA. Too much lemon flavor did not mix well with mustard greens. I am stick with the old-fashioned fricassee recipe in the Fannie Farmer cookbook.

When I made this it was just too bitter. Mustard greens are very bitter and add all the lemon to it, my mouth was puckering. Perhaps spinach leaves would be a better choice.

This is recipe is out of this world... it is full of taste & flavorfully delicious!! Somewhat time-consuming in preparation but well worth the effort. The sauce is so good it tastes great by itself on rice as well. I love it!
