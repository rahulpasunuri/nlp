I've made this turkey year after year and it's delicious. I start the bird breast side down and flip it half way through the cooking -- which keeps the breast moist. (Another way to keep the breast from overcooking is to ice it for two hours while the rest of the turkey comes to room temperature before cooking -- just put crushed ice into a plastic bag and drape it over the bird.)

Took the advice of another reviewer and roasted the (organic) turkey upside-down for 1-1.5 hrs. This makes it self-basting. Did not baste much and it still turned out great. Left out the sherry from the gravy and it was still delicious.

This was so easy, and my husband thought this was possibly the best gravy he'd ever had. I used the sparkling apple cider, and he thought it tasted "champagny". I forgot to reserve fat to make the roux, so I made roux using butter. I ended up with small flour lumps in the gravy (you could see them, but not taste them). I usually thicken gravy by adding a flour/water mix which doesn't cause the lump problems. Still trying to figure out the purpose of the whole wheat bread. Will definitely make it many times in the future.

I wish you could give half forks. I would give this one 31/2. The turkey was golden brown and looked fabulous although the dark meat was a little underdone. I did follow the recipe exactly. The temperature was right on the thermometer and even the plastic popper popped up. Oh well. I cut the breast off and returned the rest to cook some more. The gravy was FABULOUS! I'm not much of a gravy person but this stuff is so good. I will deffinately do the gravy again!

I have made this in years past and it's fabulous! One alteration I do is to make a compound butter with minced sage and rub it under the skin of the turkey. The bird is really moist and subtly infused with the sage.

I have made this for 3 Thanksgiving's so far, and this year will be the 4th. It is the best recipe, you must also make the bacon chestnut stuffing that was from the same issue. This is awesome!

Once I found this recipe, I never had to look for another Thanksgiving turkey recipe again. This is the best and my family looks forward to it every year.

The turkey had a great flavor; made pan gravy without the sherry and apple cider and it was very tasty. Will definitely use this recipe again.

This is an awesome and absolutely simple recipe. The turkey was moist and tender and had a slight and elegant touch of apple flavour. I would suggest marinating the turkey the day before you bake it and rub the seasoning underneath the skin. I didn't put sherry in my gravy but the turkey was delicious just by itself

My daughter and I created this dish for Thanksgiving dinner. It turned out just beautiful and was one of the best tasing turkey's We've ever had. This is one I will use many times in the future.

I've made this recipe several times and it's always a winner. The turkey is moist, the flavor is delightful, and my guests rave! I cook my turkey breast-side down down for the first hour,although that's not specified in the recipe. I've never made it any other way.
