Tart, crisp, savory, rich. I used Plochman's mustard (stoneground with a little horseradish; a nice rough German-style mustard), added some thinly sliced yellow and red bell pepper, and substituted dillWEED for dill SEED, which added just the right subtle sweetness to round out the flavor.

I loved it. I thought the mustard gave it wonderful flavor. I chose to leave out the onion. This will be a staple in our house.

I made it according to the recipe and it was ok, but next time I'll add less mustard, because it overpowered the other flavors.

This is on regular rotation in our house now. I usually halve it, and add in some celery and red peppers (cut very thin) for some extra color and texture. Simple, healthy, and a perfect side for the chili-rubbed chicken (on this site).

Considering the calories and fiber in this recipe, it is not bad. I thought that the mustard was a bit too strong and would use less next time. Worth a try.
