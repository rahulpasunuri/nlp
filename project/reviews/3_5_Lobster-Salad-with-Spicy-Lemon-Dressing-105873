This salad was amazing. I used olive oil instead of grapeseed, and used two lobster tails for two people (I don't think that my kids would eat this). I cannot wait to make it again!

I grated some ginger. Used olive oil. Found it too soy-saucy. Use less. Read More http://www.epicurious.com:80/recipes/food/notes/Lobster-Salad-with-Spicy-Lemon-Dressing-105873#ixzz1tRyRBWX8

This is SUCH a fantastic recipe. I made this salad for my clients and they were very pleased. They do not eat mushrooms so I did not add them to the salad; but it was still a hit. The dressing is simply amazing and has a great kick to it. I do love the hint of flavor the garlic chips at to the salad. I've already made it a second time!

Very good salad, but it was enough lobster for the two of us. For 4 I would use 2 lobsters. Used chili oil instead of chili garlic and it was fine. I sauted the garlic, didn't need to fry it.

See my review of Lobster Salad Canapes on this site. Lobster Salad with Spicy Lemon Dressing came in second in my lobster salad "taste test."

I really love this recipe and use the left over dressing on Mache greens.

I made this salad for a dinner party...my husband is a lobster purist and I was afraid he would say that this dressing ruins the wonderful taste of the lobster - but he liked it! I was surprised. The other guests liked it too. I tried to get a real balance so it was neither too salty nor too lemony. Used the grapeseed oil, which I thought would be hard to find, but saw it in about three stores, from the supermarket to the little Italian grocery. Also found the chili garlic sauce in the tabasco etc. dept of the supermarket. We had the supermarket cook the lobsters and then my husband took the meat out. Served it on a little Boston lettuce leaf - easy and delicious.

the dressing is great. As for concerns regarding the dressing being overpowering, all dressings should be used sparingly, they're meant to enhance a salad, not be the main ingredient.

I made this for a lunch for a friends birthday and it was a hit. I didn't think the dressing overpowered the lobster at all. I love lots of lemon with fish so I thought it was great. I will definitely make it again.

The dressing overpowered the lobster. Both my husband and I were disappointed in this recipe.

I would actually give this a 3 1/2 forks! This was refreshing, and delicious. My guests raved over it. I didn't use all the soy, but I did include the sea salt which I am told brightens the flavor of all foods. I agree. I would gladly serve this up again! Presentation looked lovely too!

Not sure if I missed the boat somewhere but I didn't think this was that great...I think the lobster is lost in the dressing and I was a little disappointed. My husband didn't rave either but said he enjoyed the textures and it was nice to try something different, besides, lobster is always good... try the lobster salad with grapefruit and avacado...simple but flavourful

Delicious! I prepared this for Father's Day dinner, with some slight variations. Grapeseed oil proved elusive, so I used Extra Light Olive Oil instead, which was fine. (I will definitely seek out the grapeseed oil for next time.) I served this as an entrée salad, so used one whole lobster per person. I doubled the amount of the chili paste in the dressing, and frankly, could have quadrupled it--- we enjoy spicy food. However, I found the soy flavor to be overwhelming and will reduce that a bit next time. And because the soy was so salty, I found the dressing needed no additional salt. I also forgot to put the fried garlic chips on the top, and dispensed with the sautéed mushrooms as well. Because I prepared the lobsters and the dressing the day before, putting this together was very easy. I served it with warm goat cheese toasts with walnuts and honey (also from Epicurious), and I highly recommend the combination---the warm, crispy and creamy toasts along with the sweetness of the honey offset the rich lobster, tart and spicy dressing and bitter greens beautifully. This would make an outstanding and very romantic summer date meal. A definite four-forker....

I thought this was a great change of pace for the type of salads I've served in the past. I thought the spicey taste was just right.

Not too shabby, though I would HARDLY call it spicy. I added some slivered bird's eye peppers and some slivered pickled ginger. The grapeseed flavor makes it. Also replaced the deep fried garlic with assorted asian pickles.

Fantastic! It is a really perfect starter dish for guests because it is easy to make and can be prepared before. & very imressive. I used large shrimps (in Germany it's not easy to get lobster) and reduced lemon a little bit as recommended. Will make it again and again.

A very light dressing loaded with taste. A very nice fusion dish.

This salad is amazing. Fabulous combination of flavors. My guests took the rest of the dressing home.

Would I make this again? I made it twice in one day! Had it with the lobster for guests at lunch and was so pleased with it, I served it again for supper (for ten) with everything but the lobster. My supper guests demanded the recipe before I had a chance to clear the plates. Try this one. Follow the dressing ingredients exactly (grapeseed oil seems particularly crucial), and improvise with lobster or shrimp or no shellfish at all.

Excellent salad - I will use less lemon juice next time because it tasted slightly too much like lemon and I used olive oil instead of grape seed oil which worked out well. I also used some of the vinaigrette and sauteed the mushrooms in it instead of grilling them.

This was mighty delicious even without the grapeseed oil (still searching) - made a stab at a substitute by using garlic olive oil (as suggested by previous reviewer). Wasn't crazy about the garlic chips, but this could have been "operator error" - next time will use very, very fresh garlic to avoid any possibility of bitterness (was that it?) and go a little shorter with my frying time.

Very good but I might use less expensive crab meat or shrimp or even scallops next time. The dressing was a great change of pace but was so strong it overpowered the lobster. i will make again.

Rating: 4
What a treat! Very unusual. The grapeseed oil is worth the purchase. Will serve it for company. I think it would work with scallops too...maybe sauteed in butter and cooleds lightly.

This was incredibly expensive, not easy to make and would have been just as tasty with crab meat or some other shellfish that isn't as costly as lobster. The dressing was disappointing as well - lemon flavor was too strong.

Amazing flavor... just amazing. I can't wait to make it again. My boyfriend said it was the best salad he'd ever had. I added a bit of extra chili kick with some La-Yu chili sauce in the dressing... otherwise I made it according to the recipe. Used 2 1.5 lb lobsters and had enough meat to make the salad a meal.

I made this for a get together and what a hit! The crunchy garlic on the salad was a surprising topping and everyone loved it. I also used frozen tails and marinated the lobster in lime juice most of the day before putting the salad together. One of the best recipes I've tasted!

Amazing dressing. Tangy, salty, full of wonderful flavor. Use a microplaner to grate the garlic - it's easy and quick. I think I grated a little too much garlic, however - the salad left my mouth a little less than kissable. ;)

Had to midify ingredients slightly as I could not find either grapeseed oil or garlic chili sauce. Used garlic olive oil and thai chili sauce and fresh chopped garlic. Everyone loved it. (I may have been heavy handed with the fresh garlic) I have found Grapeseed oil and am making it a third time

This is the same dish that my husband and I had Nobu (in London); it was the highlight of our meal at the restaurant and the recipe translates perfectly to a home kitchen. Very elegant, flavorful, and light. Wonderful as a main course for a lunch or a light supper. It goes well with a wedge of baked polenta or a wedge of baked potato "kugel."

I've made this a couple of times. Our friends loved it as much as we do. I've used frozen lobster tail and haven't marinated it in lime juice. The dressing is phenomenal for its taste and simplicity.

Most delicious and this is coming from a non-seafood eater. I took the advise about marinating the lobster in a little lime juice. My husband just devoured it. We will make this again soon for our gormet supper club! YUM!!!

The recipe was very nice and amazingly flavorful. The deep fried garlic loses all pungent qualities and attains more of crunchy french fry-like (pommes frites) quality. I recommend frying the minced garlic twice; padding dry in between first and second frying segment. Fried garlic was a very unique idea on behalf of Chef Nobuyuki Matsuhisa Noba. I used frozen lobster tail instead of fresh. However, I only blanched the tail for two minutes total and then after placing the tail in the iced water, I shelled the flesh and marinated in lime juice for one hour. This provided the salad with a South American "ceviche-feel". The dish is real fun to work with when it comes to garnishing! Light your candles and dazzle your guests!

Sublime. Served as a starter for our Christmas dinner. The grapeseed oil gave the salad a clean, juicy taste as opposed to an oily one. Used store-bought lobster tails and didn't mess with the boiling/shelling on the eve of Christmas! My husband rated it "an eleven."
