I made this for my husband's co-workers and they loved it! It was gone in minutes. I did omit the spices, halved the coconut, and added an equal amount of sour cream to whipped topping. I also added fresh fruit in season (i.e. strawberries, blueberries, tangerine...) I will definitely make this, again.

My family always made a much more simplified, but much better version. Take 20 navel orages and cut them in half. Pull out the flesh with a grapefruit knife. Add a bag of shredded ccoconut and a cup and a half of diced pecans. You can make it the day before. It's labor intensive, but excellent.

Our family used a much more toned down recipe for Thanksgiving and Christmas. You use about 20 navel oranges that you cut in half. Pull out the flesh with a grapefruit knife. Add one bag of shredded coconut and a cup and a half of diced pecans. It's labor intensive and delicious. Anyone who gets this for a special meal will know that they are loved.

This is very so-so. Why bother? I mean where is the fiz and pizzaz? Ambrosia usually has some kind of light and creamy sauce, nectar and/ or sometimes a bit of effervescence. If its really good it has a subtle spice and tartness too. Try some light cream, yogurt, soy or rice milk, fruit juice, sparkling fruit cider, white vinegar, ginger or five spice or something like that. And, please, I mean really (??), flaked coconut and marshmellows is the wrong idea for giving it that cetain "surprise." At least this recipe saved us from that.

For those that think fresh coconut is just a little too much trouble try the fresh frozen coconut at you local grocer. It is sooooo much faster. Loved the receipe and will make again.

Wonderful! Just what we were looking for. I added green apples and a couple bananas. (soak the apples w/ a little lemon juice to avoid the brown) - Used fewer marshmellows. WONDERFUL! Will definitely make again!!

We always serve this as an appetizer for Christmas dinner so it is nicer to keep it simple using only fresh fruit (oranges) and only a little sugar. Remove the peel along with all the pith from the oranges with a paring knife, then cut out the sections between the membranes. Finally squeeze out all the remaining juice. Much easier then fooling around with your fingers!

I was not able to get the recipe for ambrosia from my grandfather before he died and this is the only one I have seen so far that comes anywhere close to his.

The basic recipe is fine, but it doesn't say what size cans of fruit to use, for example. Also, my idea of Ambrosia involved marshmallows and whipping cream. Modifications: Package coconut (about 2 cups), 1 15 oz can mandarine oranges, 9 oz Cool Whip, 2 cups mini-marshmallows. For Pineapple, I liked it better with the 5.5 oz can.

My mother's recipe is still my favorite- except for all the work involved! Skip the fruit cocktail-add pink grapefruit sections. Use only fresh fruit and confectioner's sugar. The one exception to fresh was the coconut- guess we couldn't get that so she used the grated version found in the baking section of the grocery store. Try using both red and green maraschino cherries- if you can find them! Don't remember if her recipe had nuts, but if it did, pecans would have been ourchoice. Be sure you get rid of all of the citrus fruits' membranes and no white pith either! Try it you'll like it!

There's a little too much STUFF in the recipe. Try a simplified version which consists of canned mandarin orange and pinapple, sour cream, mini-marshmallows and shredded coconut. This is very light & refreshing and not too sweet.

Quick, easy, a classic.
