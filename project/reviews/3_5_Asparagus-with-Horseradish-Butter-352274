Did my usual tweaks. Added lemon zest, salt, pepper. Next time I'd steam the asparagus. The horseradish really brighten up the dish.

Meh. This is a little more labor-intensive than the results justify. Why not just steam the asparagus & toss w/olive oil, lemon juice, S + P?

Nice Flavor. The butter tones down the harseradish - so it is not overpowering.

Yum, gotta love asparagus, and butter only makes it better. Oh, and horseradish. Mmm.

This recipe had people that didn't like asparagus asking for seconds. We kept the stalks whole as they were nice and thin, roasted them, tossed and served. An easy and elegant dish to serve a crowd and a great accompaniment to Beef Wellingtons with Gorgonzola for our Christmas Eve feast!

This was so yummy! I'm hooked on horseradish butter!

For me, asparagus does best when cooked simply. The horseradish didn't do it for me, and I think the best way to cook it is in a pan with a bit of salt and pepper and oil.

It was definitely a nice way to prepare asparagus. However, the halving asparagus stalks, is quite a production and I'd say it may save cooking time, but it doubles the preparation time. Next time I'll roast whole. The only issue is I've looked at other recipes and can't believe the number of differing temperatures and times for roasting asparagus - 350 for 15 min, 400 for 12 min, 450 for 20 min and 500 for 7 min. Guess I'll have to experiment.

Must agree with the reviewer who wondered if this would be a disaster, or terrific... It is definitely a winner. We grilled the asparagus before tossing with the horseradish butter and served with grilled salmon. We will be serving this again soon since local asparagus is available!

I thought it would be hard to improve upon fresh steamed asparagus, but this recipe is truly a nice twist! -- I served with the lemon oregano chicken (in the same issue), so easy to cook both in the oven at the same time.

When my husband mentioned this recipe, I said, well it will either be a disaster, or terrific. I served the asparagus with lamb chops and it was terrific! Who would have thought...I simply boiled the asparagus in salted water until tender, drained and dried in the pan, then added the butter and horseradish, stirred, and served - easy new taste. I recommend highly!
