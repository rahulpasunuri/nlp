We love this cake! I have made it several times and it is always met with rave reviews. I replace 1 cup of the oil with unsweetened apple sauce. I increase the cinnamon to 3 teaspoons and I omit the nuts. We love it. Be careful not to get your caramel too hot/boiling - that is what causes it to harden and not soak into the cake.

This turned out great although I did think the sugar asked for was excessive and reduced it by almost 1/2 cup. Otherwise it is well worth making again and again especially now that it's apple season.

I was just starting to make this recipe for the umpteenth time and just wanted to say how much we all love it - just as is!

This simply didn't turn out well for me and was way too sweet. The caramel looked good after I made it but when I drizzled it over the bottom of the cake, it never absorbed into it. It just hardened. And when I drizzled the rest of the caramel onto the top of the cake, the texture came out grainy. I'm sure it had to be something I did wrong, but it's not worth it to play around with the ingredients and try again.

This cake is incredible! We picked apples over the weekend and I was looking for a dessert recipe for a party using apples. I made the recipe exactly as is and it was fantastic. Several people at the party asked for the recipe. It was very sweet so I will play around with the amount of sugar next time I make it.

Good cake, however I don't like using vegetable oil in my cakes due to the taste it gives. Wish I knew how much butter to substitute instead.

I don't know whether I did something wrong, or not, but I felt this cake was way too salty. I know for sure, that I used the right amount of salt.

Wow! This cake is really exceptional! I made it exactly as written except that I omitted the nuts (well, I also added 1T of flour and 1T of water, but that's a high- altitude thing that most of you can disregard). I almost didn't make the caramel sauce, but I'm so glad I did. Next time I may decrease the white and brown sugars slightly. *** Be sure to note that the brown sugar and vanilla should both say "divided" after them. Some goes in the cake batter and some goes in the caramel. Make this cake today!

I have made this cake in the past and it is delicious. My daughter picked apples last week and I wanted to use them up. The only thing I am going to do is break up the measurements. This time I put all 2 cups of brown sugar into the cake and it was a disaster! i definetly learned my lesson and will make it again tomorrow.

Hard to eat only one piece, this is a perfect fall cake. I omitted the nuts due to allergies. With all the sugar I thought the cake itself would be too sweet but it wasn't. Really worth the effort. I used about 3 1/2 golden delish apples.

I think you could separate the cake ingredients from the topping. I made the mistake of putting 2 cups of brown sugar in the cake. It's silly to have all the ingredients in the list. I'm sure others made the same mistake. Not sure how it will taste. I have to take it to a friend's house tonight.

Oh my gosh! This cake is awesome! At the very last minute, I realized I didn't have pecans or ANY nuts for that matter, so I used about a cup of old fashioned oats...I also didn't have much brown sugar left, but I had those milk maid caramels, so I melted in 6 of those to make up the rest...I also added nutmeg and allspice - a little more than 1/8 tsp each, and it is delectable! I also only had 1 1/2 sticks of butter, so I substituted some olive oil...I only had Washington apples, which didn't give it the oomph it needs - the granny smith or galas or fujis would be perfect! I need to go to the grocery store because I'm out of everything! All in all, this cake is GREAT - I'm going to make it again for Thanksgiving, too! The only laborous part is peeling/coring the apples, which I did first and put lemon juice on and tossed. This is a great cake!

This recipe sounded SO good to me I HAD to try it! Was NOT disappointed at all! I substituted Empire apples, and I found the cook time to be about 1 hour, 20 mins. Brought it in to share with my co- workers, and they all loved it! This is a winner, and I'd definitely make it again!

There are definately some tricks to making this cake great... I've made the recipie a few times here's what I've learned - Use fresh juicy apples(I like MacIntosh), that will keep the cake moist. Cut the apples into large chunks, after baking these will form velvety pockets in the cake. -As the recipie instructs, pour that caramel topping on the bottom of the cake, while it's still in the bundt pan. Do this while the cake is still hot it will make the cake moist and sweet - it's the best part of the cake!

Rating: 2
I made the cake following the recipe as written, except that I used Cameo apples instead of Golden Delicious. It is a nice cake, but not outstanding. I don't think the end result justifies the amount of fat in the recipe -- it is not so delicious that I would want to make it again w/ so much oil. The next time, I will try substituting 1C applesauce for 1C of the oil in the cake recipe (as several reviewers have suggested) and reducing the amount of butter in the topping recipe.

Easy to make, though it needed 3+ bowls. Sort of tasty, but nothing special - and whoa, lots of oil and sugar. I also thought the caramel sauce was strangely runny, with a weird consistency. OK, but I will not make it again.

Very disappointing! I'm not sure what I did wrong but I followed the recipe carefully and the mixture turned out to be extremely thick and once baked, it came out very dense. The taste was okay though not acceptable enough to serve to others. The caramel sauce was good but the cake itself was a complete disappoint especially after having read great reviews.

I just made this for a meeting, so it was still slightly warm when we tried it. Everyone loved it, although I would use a different caramel sauce for it next time, (Rose Levy Beranbaum has a great one in "The Pie and Pastry Bible." I used Granny Smiths because that's what I had and added a bit of allspice and nutmeg. A nice, easy all-purpose recipe. Definitely something I'll make again.

I was pleasantly surprised by the carmel sauce, wich was one of the highlights of this recipe. In the future, I think I might make a bit extra and pool it in my plates before serving the slices of cake. I might also consider a bit of creme freche or whipped cream to accompany the cake, which alone is good but not exceptional.

The cake is delicious. Next time I will use the caramel icing just to drizzle over the cake. It thickens after it sits and will drizzle beautifully over the bundt cake. My family loves it!!!

I just have a quick question: lots of the reviewers have called the caramel icing a sauce. Is it more saucy than an icing? Does it travel well or it is a cake better made to serve immediately where it was cooked?

This cake was a hit. I made it almost as exactly as the recipe called for except I think I may have used more apples than called for and the apples I used were a drier baking apple but the results were fabulous. I served this cake to adults and children this weekend and everyone loved it. My husband was crazy about it. I can't wait to make this again. Oh, the only other thing I did was as a previous reviewer suggested, I poked holes in the cake before pouring the caramel sauce over the bottom. I thought the amount of caramel sauce perfect. The cake was sweet enough, I don't think it needs anything with it, other than a good cup of coffee.

I made this for a dinner party with Empire apples. It got RAVE reviews. I found that it took much longer than an hour to bake through, and was still so moist it almost fell apart! Next time I may use a bit less oil, but people went nuts for it as it is...

After reading the reviews I decided to keep the sugar and oil but double the apples and add a ½ cup of store bought applesauce. I used Cortland apples that are a bit tarter than the gold delicious. I waited the cake to cool, poured half of the caramel sauce on top and with the other half I added 1 cup of pecans and arranged on the side of the cake. Let me tell you, this will be the third time I'' make this cake this week! It has been a success for the holidays.

Cake turned out lovely, moist, and sweet. I found it kept well, and enjoyed it for breakfast with my coffee! Next time I'm going to try a different caramel sauce, as this one turned out a bit too buttery for my taste (but not for one of my other cake tasters, who said 'no! don't change the sauce!'). Very easy to make, too.

made this cake multiple times, and each time everyone loved it. in fact, my brother said that it was possibly the best cake i've ever made, and i've made a lot of cakes. just to let you know, though, when pouring on the caramel, it is pretty thin, and mostly runs down to the bottom of the plate. as it cools, it thickens, and if you keep on spooning it over the cake as it cools, it forms a very nice glaze and makes the cake taste even better.

I discovered this recipe because I couldn't bear to call my Mom and tell her I had lost her apple cake recipe yet again (4th time!). I am really glad I did because this recipe is better than hers! (Sorry Ma!) I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious! I considered cutting back on the oil and sugar but decided to try it as written and, as far as the ingredients go, I don't think I would change a thing . I did cook the caramel a minute or two longer than the recipe called for to darken it and thicken it a little more. Instead of pouring the glaze over the cake I waited until the cake was almost completely cool then used a pastry brush and put a thin coat of glaze over the entire cake. I only used about half the glaze so I took what was left over, threw in a few chopped pecans and poured it onto wax paper to cool and it made a very nice praline!

Rating: 3
This cake comes together pretty quickly and tastes great. I substituted half the oil with applesauce (3/4 cup of each) and it was great without that gumminess that sometimes happens when you substitute in that way. The caramel sauce is just that - a sauce, not a frosting so it is supposed to run over the sides of the cake. It looks beautiful, but it does waste a fair amount of it. I liked the suggestion of saving the run-off (I put the cake on a rack over a piece of parchment paper) for spooning over individual slices.

Rating: 4
An absolutely delicious cake! I made it the first time exactly as directed and it was very good but I felt that the caramel on top was a bit runny. The second time while the bottom was 'soaking' I reheated the sauce, added a tablespoon more butter and an 8th cup confectioers sugar. I whisked until boiling then beat off the heat until icing consistency. That allowed me to 'frost' the cake making a beautiful presentation.

I used 2 extra large fuji apples that were not as crisp as they used to be for eating plain. I didn't put in any pecans, and I definitely used more than the amount of apples called for, but this recipe allows for modifications in amt/type of apples and spices. I used 1 cup of veg oil, 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/4 cup of apple sauce and baked in a 10-in bundt pan for 55 min. The texture of the cake was perfectly moist.

I have made this cake again and again. The secret is to scroll down the reviews and replace the oil with applesauce (it cuts fat and enhances the apple taste) and cut down the sugar by 1/4 C ea. like a few of the reviewers recommended.

Great cake - I used a lot more apples, a lot less sugar and baked in 9x12 pan and it turned out fine. The caramel sauce was yummy until I added the vanilla and then I just thought it tasted too sweet - more like honey than caramel so I'm not putting it on the cake. I'd try again with no vanilla.

Absolutely wonderful! This is a family favorite, I make it every year after we go to New England on our early apple-picking trip.

My 15 month old has severe milk allergies. I am always looking for a recipe that can be adapted for her. This one was perfect. I used soy milk and margarine in the caramel sauce.

I have made this cake several times, and always to rave reviews. This past Christmas, I made this cake in mini bundt pans, and gave them as gifts with Christmas cookies, they were so cute and tasty. This has become a family favorite. If you let the caramel topping cool long enough, it will be much thicker and won't run off the cake so quickly, but let it sit too long and it will be too thick (then you have to rewarm it to loosen it up).

Drew some great reviews from the people I served it to. I did not find the cake too sweet, but felt there was a little too much salt. Was definitely a moist cake. I used heavy cream instead of whole milk for the caramel topping and did not put it on the bottom of the cake. I had made the cake the night before, and unmolded the cake. The sauce was not runny, and it did ooze decoratively over the cake. I added a sprinkling of coarsely crushed pecans to the top of the cake before the caramel set. Might add a touch of Apple Jack or Calvados next time.

This is a very good and very easy cake. I think I would add a little more cinammon next time as the flavor kind of got lost with the caramel. My caramel seemed ready way before 5 minutes and I didn't have any problems with it being too thin. Oven time seemed right on. In the past, I have had a lot of problems with cakes sticking in my bundt pan. I used Crisco and the suggested flour and had no problems getting it out. Everyone at my dinner party raved and all took a piece home.

I love this cake! I have made it 3 times so far. The first time, we didn't boil the caramel long enough so it was very thin like a syrup. Since then, I have timed it 5 minutes from the point it starts to boil. This has yielded a thicker sauce. Also, I have had to bake the cake an additional 10 minutes. I love having this great tasting cake in the house to snack on. It has a strong cinnamon flavor with subtle apple and crunch from the pecans. To comment on previous reviews, I do not find it too sweet nor too oily.

An okay cake, a little too sweet and OILY...to the cook who commented about the caramel running off, you have to do it on the rack over wax paper and keep scooping up the run off and reapplying it. If you wait until the caramel cools and thickens, then it won't run evenly down the cake. It lookedbeautiful, but it doesn'y tempt me to break my diet

This cake is great! I brought it to a party and everyone loved it. Very moist. I did have trouble with the caramel topping. When I put it on the bottom of the cake, it ran between the cake and sides of the pan and I was concerned it would make the cake stick. So I quickly un-molded the cake rather than wait 15 minutes. Also, the topping on top just ran off the cake. Maybe I will let the caramel cool more next time, so it thickens a bit. But overall, this cake was fantastic and doesn't really even need the topping.

Although I really liked this recipe (and it received rave reviews from my guests), the next time I make it I will omit the second stage of the topping (adding the second half).
