I tried this recipe for the first time this Christmas. It was fabulous! I made it in individual ramekins so watch the baking time. I will make this again and get a larger ceramic pan. It's wonderful....and even better after a second day!

This has become a regular at Christmas dinner. Everyone loves it, and would be disappointed if I didn't serve it! It's great that it makes one dish instead of individual servings.

Next time I make this I will definately add some vanilla.

I had high hopes for this recipe but was really, really disappointed with the final product. The taste was just OK. My guests liked it - I didn't.For the cook that had the 'scrambled egg' consistency - you didn't temper your eggs correctly. You put the hot cream mixture into the cold eggs to quickly.

I adore this! I might not be as into it away from the holidays, but it is a delicious flavor for creme brulee. I will definitely keep it in the winter repetoire.

I love this recipe. It's my go-to recipe anytime I need a creme brulee. I don't care for a strong liquor taste in food, so the changes I always make are to do 1 tablespoon of brandy and 1 tablespoon of rum. I also sub regular sugar for the brown sugar called for. I always get rave reviews and it is very creamy, every time.

Made this for guests without trying it before, everyone thought it was delicious! Planning on adding it to my holiday menu this year.

This was my first attempt at making creme brulee and we liked it. At the last minute I decided to make this recipe and unfortunately the nutmeg I had was too old to use. I'll make it again with fresh nutmeg.

Very tasty IF you really enjoy eggnog. I used half eggnog, half heavy cream and it was still very eggnoggy (but those who love eggnog were excited!). I tried torching with brown sugar but it didn't crystallize as nicely as white sugar, or a blend. I also used ramekins- used eight of them and had to throw away the rest of the mixture. This should make about 10-12 ramekinds if you choose to go that route. Yummy!

I made this for our anual New Year's Day soup party and everyone raved about it. I have since made it several times and every time it turns out beautifully.

I was looking for a way to use up the remaining Christmas eggnog and found this recipe - substituted the cream with the eggnog and used all brown sugar. I didn't begin making it till two hours before a dinner party - even noting the amount of chill time called for. This was FABULOUS! It was the most creamy creme brulee I have ever had. I use a blow torch for the caramelization process which makes it quite easy to control. It was sweet (what's the point of dessert if it's not sweet?) and guests were raving! Funny how people can have such different experiences...kudos to the cook who provided the "one tablespoon at a time" reference as to how slow is slow for combining the yolk/cream mixture - that's the ticket to success. Nice to know the recipe will work well in individual ramekins, too.

i gave it two forks only for the concept. this recipe yields a creme brulee which tastes like rum and creme, not like eggnog. we resolved this by burning the alcohol out of the liquors before adding them to the other ingredients (do this by igniting the liquor in a pan on the stove and letting it burn until it stops). to the person who got "scrambled egg" consistency, it would help to cover the pan before baking the creme brulees, and to make sure your oven is not too hot.

This has become a favorite in our home. I bring dessert every holiday to family gatherings, and everyone keeps asking for this one.

If you like eggnog you must try this! It was so easy and so delicious. The eggnog flavor was unmistakeable - I don't understand how anyone could think otherwise unless they didn't chill it long enough? As for the "scrambled eggs" those cooks must have added the hot mixture too quickly to the eggs. Try again and have someone else pour the hot mixture very slowly for you so that you can whisk constantly. It was the perfect ending to our Christmas dinner.

I don't understand why cooks are having trouble with this - it's easy and DIVINE!!!!! I personally love the strong eggnog flavor. Why else would you make it? This one's a keeper!

I haven't tried this particular recipe yet, but to speak to those who are having difficulties, it's probably one of 2 things. If your problem is the milk curdling, try bringing your alcohol and milk to closer relative temperatures (i.e. if one is cold and one is hot, cool one and/or warm the other so there's not such a temperature differential). If the problem is scrambled eggs, or your eggs cooked before being put in the oven, your milk mixture was still too warm when you added it to the eggs. Allow it to cool a little more next time, and when it says to gradually add the warm milk, start with a Tablespoon at a time, whisking constantly to help equalize the temperature (after the first 1/2 cup or so is added, you can probably start pouring in a slow steady stream, still constantly whisking to prevent hot spots).

I made this 3 times, in 7 oz ramekins as well as the 8 cup baking dish, and the individual servings make for a better presentation. No problems like some of the other reviewers, and I've substituted all sorts of combinations of heavy and light cream, and even accidentally sloshed some of the water bath in the cups (don't ask) and still got rave reviews. Will make again and again.

My mother made this for a New Years Eve party along with a bunch of other desserts. She had to beat them off the dish to save me a bite for the next day. Very yummy!

Excellent, and surprisingly easy to make. My Christmas guests were highly impressed. Note; it tastes like real eggnog, so don't make this if you don't like the taste of alcohol. I did substitute Cognac for the rum, and rum for the brandy, but that's personal preference.

I don't know what I was expecting, but not this. Too sweet and too strong a flavor. My guests were polite, but I could tell they didn't much care for it. And even my desert-loving husband didn't want the leftovers. I'll go back to my standby creme brulee recipe.

I used the ingredients for this but my own time-tested creme brulee method, which does not involve stove-top cooking (which I've found adds catastrophe potential far exceeding benefits). I mixed the eggs and sugar in a mixer, added cold cream, the booze and nutmeg and then put it in individual ramekins. Baked it for 40-45 minutes (until set) at slightly lower temperature in water bath. Was a big hit. In fact, such a big hit that my husband requested I make another batch over the weekend. Recipe loses a "fork" with me due to unnecessarily complicated directions.

I did not like this recipe. I guess I added the eggs too quickly and the sugar did not melt well in my broiler.

I don't love egg nog, but guests that did loved this. For the cooks below with the "scrambles egg / curdling" problem, I suspect that you added the hot liquid too fast to the eggs and basically cooked them (like egg drop soup). The liquid must be added very slowly in small amounts to give the eggs time to adjust to the temp. change. Try it again to give it a chance.

I was stunned by the success of this recipe. Desserts are not my strength. My dinner guests raved and went for seconds. Not having any rum or brandy in the house I just used vanilla extract.

This is absolutely one of the best creme brulee recipes I have ever made. I have fixed it in one large dish and also individually. So cremey and delicious. Very easy too! Definitely will keep it in my recipe index.

Didn't have the scrambled egg problem, but the filling didn't set properly, even after cooking it for 10 minutes more and chilling for 4 hours. Also agree that the eggnog flavor wasn't obvious enough. I'd make it again (and maybe the ramekins would help the setting problem) using some store bought eggnog to bring out the flavor.

Wow, I wonder what happened to the cooks below? This was one of the most delicious creme brulées I've ever eaten. The texture was incredibly luxurious and creamy and the flavor was irresistible. I followed the recipe exactly and my guests were swooning.

I love this dish and so did my guests. I added just a hint of eggnog from a carton. It is a must for creme brulee lovers.

This recipe is incredible. I made it for Christmas eve and served it with raspberries on top. Wonderfully creamy texture with the light crunch of the carmelized sugar. You have to watch it carefully under the broiler -- it can burn easily. I had no trouble with curdling as other people described. I plan to make it again and again.

Okay, my sister made this recipe, and she is an excellent cook and baker. Evidently, when she added the liquor to the egg concoction, it coagulated and looked liked scrambled eggs. It tasted more like a custard and the eggnog flavor was not that obvious. It did taste good but did not look like the magazine's photo. Any ideas what might have gone wrong? I'd like to make it but am apprehensive about the result. Luckily, she made the cranberry orange cheesecake, which got rave reviews and looked beautiful.

I pride myself on my cooking, but WHAT HAPPENED HERE?!? It tasted like scrambled eggs with nutmeg and the top never carmelized under the broiler. Total disaster. Nobody liked it. Thank God for the beautiful recipe for the triple chocolate cake with peppermint filling, saved the night.

Too sweet. And there's better creme brulee recipes out there.

Ooooo-kay...Loved the eggnog part of the creme brulee, but, the topping tasted like a campfire toasted marshmallow. Perhaps drying out the brown sugar would allow for a thinner and more even distribution. Agreeing with others, the big dish is not the most lovely way to serve this. Pony up for the individual ramekins.

I have made this twice already and plan to do so again. It is an easy, yet elegant, dessert. I prefer the individual serving ramekins as it is more elegant. I also increased the recipe by 50% and it was still excellent.

I made this recipe last night for a party. I've made a lot of creme brulees and normally love them, but this one was a little sweet for my liking. Also, I didn't like the "one big creme brulee" idea... it wasn't that pretty once it was served. If I did make this again, I would lower the sugar a bit and make it in individual ramekins.

So good! So decadent! So easy! Made it 1 day ahead for a party (except for the crunchy topping) everyone loved it. But definately keep it away from the kids!
