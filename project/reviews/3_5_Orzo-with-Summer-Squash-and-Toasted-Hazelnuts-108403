Great suggestions from previous reviewers - I added fresh lemon juice and feta, which really improved this. I was also more generous with the fresh herbs and steamed some green beans to use instead of the green zucchini. I think the slight change makes for a much prettier and more interesting dish.

I can see why some people thought this recipe is a bit bland. Make sure to brown the summer squash (I used a mix from the farmer's market) and add extra lemon juice for flavor. Salt helps bring out the flavors. It is a clean, light summer dish. The hazelnuts are almost unnecessary in my opinion.

I used some fresh squash from my favorite Austin farm, Boggy Creek, and added some roasted hatch chili as it's that time of year around here and it was delicious.

I thought this recipe was really great! But I did make 1 modification: at the very end of the shallots and squash cooking time, I threw in 1 can of drained "fire roasted" diced tomatoes. I would have used fresh cherry/grape tomatoes, but I thought of it at the last minute and didn't have time to even halve them. So I used canned and it was great!!

Wow. This was so easy and so delicious. A farmer's market left us with a plethora of summer squash, and this was a delicious summer salad. The combination of flavors - lemon, hazelnut, basil - is terrific. I left out the parsley because it fresh herbs are expensive and you only need a little, and it was fine without it. This one's a keeper.

I made this as part of a 4th of July BBQ to take advantage of the squash and zucchini in my garden, and while it was good, it was a little bland and we had tons left over. We added lemon juice and crumbled feta to the leftovers and it became instantly more exciting. More herbs might be nice too. The hazelnuts work well, though they are a fair amount of work.

I love this recipe! I often use sliced almonds instead of hazelnuts because I have them on hand. Also, rather than adding the pasta water if the dish needs more moisture, I squeeze that lemon I've just zested. If I want this as a more substantial main dish I fry up a couple of italian sausages separately, then slice & toss with everything else. Yum! So glad spring has come so I can cycle back to this recipe!

This recipe was easy to make and tasty. I used regular onion because we didn't have shallot in the house. My husband didn't read the recipe and cut the squash and zucchini into rounds, which came out fine. This was a nice, light dish and the lemon really gave it a brightness that was perfect for summer.

Excellent-made as a side dish to fish which was a nice compliment-two changes-added parmesan and pine nuts instead of hazelnuts-would consider adding sundried tomatoes next time.

I could LIVE off this stuff. I freakin' loved it. I don't think that my family liked it quite as much as I did, but that's too bad, because they'll be eating it again anyway. I used a half cup more orzo, and I used pecans instead of hazelnuts, because I sometimes find that hazelnuts are too sweet. I can see why people used pine nuts. I always burn them, though, so I didn't feel like messing with them. The recipe says to cook the squash for far less time than what I think is adequate--I think that it should be browned. That may be why some people found it bland. Also, it does need more salt, and a little Parmesan doesn't hurt. The prep work is really not that bad, either. I only used a quarter cup of shallots because I didn't read the recipe well enough before going to the store, so I added a couple garlic cloves, which may have helped cut down on prep time (shallots can be a pain). I think that this is a wonderful summer dish, and you can have it pretty much prepped (or ready) before guests arrive.

This recipe is quite good. I made it last night and have plenty of leftovers for lunch this week. I substituted onion for the shallots and pine nuts for the hazelnuts in order to keep the costs down. I cant recommend this dish enough. Its an excellent way to use up some of the bounty from the summer garden. The lemon and basil add nice, subtle notes.

I made this tonight for my family (who, by the way, love squash). Even my littlest (6 years-old) had thirds. It was delicious. I forgot to buy hazlenuts so used toasted pinenuts . . . otherwise followed recipe exactly (but used a bit more than 1/2 cup of basil, since my garden is abundant right now.) It was delicious -- light, but flavorful (I used white pepper and kosher salt). Don't overcook squash! Served with a green salad with feta and spanish rose.

This is a great summer dish to make - the touch of citrus makes it light and satisfying. I used summer squash fresh from the garden and I used toasted almonds instead of hazelnuts - it was a success!

My rating is based on having this as a main course. As a side dish I would rate this as 3 forks. Not quite robust enough flavors to stand on its own.

I made this for a dinner party to go with chicken and everyone loved it. It is very flavorful and the cold leftovers straight from the fridge were still delicious. The zucchini and squash were crisp, and not mushy like a previous reviewer said. Just don't overcook.

I made this recipe as written, except I substituted pine nuts for the hazelnuts. It was very good; I thought the flavor was very subtle in a good way. I did not care for the consistency of the zucchini/squash (mushy), and will be looking for other vegetables to substitute, maybe diced asparagus or peas.

My husband who hates squash loved this. I had to make a couple of substitutions...pine nuts for hazelnuts, onion for shallot, and I had no zucchini. I followed other's advice and added parm - big hit! We served it with pan fried tilapia.

I thought this was great. Delicious flavor, great textures. This is a really nice summer side dish that I'll definitely make again.

This is truly delicious. I used whole wheat orzo, and only 1 T each of butter and olive oil. It helps to prep the shallot, zucchini, squash, and hazelnuts the night before. For vegetarians, grilled lemon-garlic tofu would be a good accompaniment.

Recipe was very good with no changes. Hazelnuts make the recipe and I would not substitute. The recipe says 40 active minutes, but it took me much longer than that. It was great, but labor intensive.

Excellent! Hazelnuts really make it, would not substitue pine nuts. Feels like an exciting composition, but with very accessible ingredients. Second time we added grilled shrimp for one-dish meal.

I make 1/2 this recipe, and it feeds 8 generously. I use toasted pine nuts, and, as suggested by a previous reviewer, some parmesan cheese. It's great warm or cold.

I was totally surprised at how very tasty this dish was. I was expecting another summer dish trying to get rid of zucchini but instead got a really flavorful yet light feeling dish. The herbs and the lemon give it tang. Would be good served cold as well I think. I used pinenutes instead of hazelnuts and they worked great. Otherwise I did everything by the book for the first run and don't regret it one bit!

Loved this. Didn't have hazelnuts so I substituted pignoli nuts. Will make again and again. Much better than rice.

I made this with couscous (my husband does not like orzo), adding currants and substituting toasted pine nuts for the hazelnuts. I did have to add extra salt & pepper. Next time, I think I'll also substitute coriander for the parsley (better with the pine nuts). It was very good --- I will serve it at a dinner party tomorrow night.

I substituted two cups of wheat grain cooked in chicken stock for the orzo and omitted the olive oil to cut fat and boost nutrition. I served it with spicy grilled shrimp and loved it-- even my squash-hating husband ate every bite.

I served this with dinner yesterday to my kids. I toasted almonds large chop, to which I added dried ground cumin and corriander while toasting. Everyone loved it. Did have to add more salt. I also added dried tarragon, and dill. Gave some to my neighbors also, they loved it.

Excellent, very simple dish. Ditto on substituting toasted pignolli. We have a home in Italy and spend quite a bit of time there. I served this to a group of milanese relatives who loved it and asked for the recipe!

My family loves orzo but this recipe was not very well liked by any of us. Perhaps with the other reviewers suggestions of some red pepper flakes and parmesan it would be better but as it is it's a a repeater for us. Simple orzo with a little butter would have been a better side to the game hens with raspberry and balsamic glaze (they were very good,so the whole meal wasn't a bust!)

Rating: 2
I followed the recipe exactly and found the results too bland and dry, so I added a sauce from another recipe made with melted butter, Dijon mustard, garlic, and balsamic vinegar. With that sauce and topped with grated Parmesan, I liked it quite a bit. I think a little extra fat is worth it in this case!

Rating: 3
This was a very tasty dish and quick and easy to prepare. Apparently my idea of a lot of chopping and prep work is different from others; forty minutes is not long at all. My only substitution was cashews for hazelnuts because that's what I had on hand. My fiance liked it, and he usually only likes his own cooking! I will make it again.

Rating: 3
I followed previous reviews and added red pepper flakes and about a cup of grated Parmesan cheese - terrific! I also halved most of the recipie but used almost a whole pound of orzo to stretch it further. Now we have plenty to nibble on for a few days. Like many casseroles, it tastes better as it gets older. This will become a regular dish at my house!

I liked the crunch of the hazlenuts but that was about all I liked--too much work chopping and sauteeing for a so-so result. Nice to look at but too subtle--not a keeper according to the family.

This was really good and my kids even enjoyed it (they are very picky). I halved the recipe for the 4 of us. I omitted fresh basil (I used a little dried) and fresh parsley (didn't have any). I also substituted toasted pine nuts for the hazel nuts. Looked very bistro-ish.

When I originally looked at this recipe it had a fair amount of decent reviews, but when I pulled it up to make it today the reviews were mixed so I was kind of hesitant...let me just say I was pleasantly surprised! The flavors aren't powerful, but I wouldn't call them bland...I threw in a few red pepper flakes, but other than that I followed the directions to the T - and was happy with the results. It could probably do with a handful of parmesean, but it's fine without. Defintely a keeper and a perfect side with spicy grilled prawns, for example.

Easy to prepare and I liked the starch and vegetable combination. It accompanied Roast Beef and a spinach salad with raspberry vinaigrette. Dessert was Chocolate Truffle Hazelnut Tart. This will definitely become a part of my cooking repertoire.

We loved this but agree it needs a little lift in seasoning. I substituted pine nuts for hazelnuts and a couple of handfuls of parmesan cheese as well as a little extra lemon zest. Can also swirl in a little bit of butter at end. I would definately make this again.

I thought this recipe was very bland. My family hated it. They felt there was no flavor and the texture of the orzo combined with the vegetables was sickening. Needless to say I won't make this again.

Made this with toasted pine nuts instead of hazelnuts; served it with sauted scallops in a Pernod-based sauce. Agree that the orzo dish needs to accompany something with LOTS of flavor. Theses 2 dishes complemented each other nicely.

This recipe was flavorless. We added lots more lemon rind, some lemon juice, more pepper and some other seasonings which made it edible. Only make this if you like food that is really bland.

Update: my family loves pasta, they just feel that it needs to be bigger/longer to make them happy! (As I said, I loved this). I think if I'd done this with angel hair, or spaghetti or penne, they would have gobbled it up. It would then become a pasta dish, rather than a wonderful side, in my opinion. (I can't believe you took the time just to comment on whether my family eats pasta, much less that I bothered to reply to you) Original review on 8/26: I thought this was wonderful! Made a half recipe (for four of us). Easy (I just sauteed all the veggies together) and flavorful. The only problem? It turns out that the rest of my family doesn't like orzo! I'll probably make this with rice in the future, just to make them happy.

Try making it with toasted pine nuts instead of hazel nuts. It's more amusing as pine nuts are just about the same size as individual orzo.

This is a GREAT quick recipe for a colorful, light summer side dish. I didn't have yellow squash so I substituted with tomatoes chopped with no seeds and it was really delicious. Also, I left out the nuts and I think it was probably even better because of that.

I cut the recipe in half as we were only four. Next time would decrease the hazlenut quantity as we all found it overpowered the entire dish.
