I wasn't a big fan of this dish. The texture and appearance were both unappealing, and there was something off about the flavors. I added a few other spices, but that didn't help much. Definitely would not make this again, and probably will end up throwing out the leftovers.

Not great. The texture was not ideal. And the spices really didn't meld into the other ingredients. Made it with the recommended chicken dish and used the pan juices from the chicken as suggested.

I think the texture of the dish could be greatly improved by using more lentils and less bulgur. Half and half perhaps.

Gummy. I did exactly what the recipe said and got a gluey mass of well-formed lentils and bulgur. The seasonings were OK, but the texture was undesirable.

Mmmmm, that was great! I made some adjustments due to my circumstances (I halved the recipe and added some chopped flat leaf parsley and blanched'n'diced tomatoes at the very end). It came out delicious. Next time I will make the full portion, and I am sure it'll be gone quickly:) Great flavour in this dish.

A really nice dish, and a good accompaniment for the Chicken with caramelised onions, too. Easy, and very tasty as leftovers. A keeper.
