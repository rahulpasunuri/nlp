Take II: the second time around I got what I wanted - a softer version, closer to home. It might remind of a French fruit cake to some. So, what did it take: 200grams poppy seed [ground]; 400 grams golden resins [shredded]; five eggs [separated]; 100 grams sugar [powder]; 50 grams butter [cut and softened to room temperature]; dash of milk [just happened]; salt [of course]. Tray lined with baking paper. How did it go: Butter, sugar, yolks, salt - mixed to a fluffy cream [this is where a couple of spoons of milk helped - the mix demanded liquid; would rather try a gin next time]. Adding the poppy seeds and resins gave a stiff mixture. Eg whites beaten stiff went in last: first a third of the volume went in to softened the mix, so the rest could be folded in. In the end, the result has a strange texture: fairly runny, yet heavy and dense. The mixture went in the hot oven spread somewhat well less then two centimeters thick. Took around half an hour on very low heat. Because of the resin overload, this is still very moist when ready. The 'done' sign: a wooden toothpick stuck into the cake layer comes out sticky [rather then dry, as it would with a classic sponge cake], but clean. The surprise in the end: all the resin did not displace the strong poppy taste, on the contrary - this version gives a stronger poppy seed flavor then the fluffy original. This, is love! [walnuts? next time... it is sorbet season already]

This is one memorable cake! And news to me, despite the Central-European label it comes with [OK, there is plenty in Berlin, Prague... not so much where I am from]. I used only lemon for flavor, and a few more raisins then prescribed. The result was surprisingly airy - would have expected a denser texture. Next time will try just that. There is a version with ground and chopped walnuts instead of poppy seeds baking - fingers crossed!

all in our family love this cake - except i've put in some changes:instead of lemon i make it with orange peel, and half a spoon of baking powder,and leave out the nutmeg and cinnamon, to get a "cleaner" taste. it really has a "central european" charm. when we entertain, i add on top chocolate ganache, which goes perfect with the orange scent.
