We made these for the kids to give as gifts in little tins. They were great for that: beautiful, unique, easy for the kids to decorate nicely themselves. They were yummy and reminded us of lemon shortbread. People liked them and they were all eaten quickly, but they weren't great and no one LOVED them. Their flavor is good, but their texture is only alright--it's like other reviewers said: a little too crumbly, a little sandy (we followed the recipe exactly). They were fun to make if you like cookie projects (and we do), but I probably would not make them again.

I made these for my annual Christmas party and they were beautiful on the buffet. However, the minute you tried to eat them, they crumbled and I had cookie crumbs all over the floor. They were small enough for one bite but most didn't. The amount of time spent making these and the mess eating them outweighs the cuteness and taste. I also used a different frosting recipe. I would not make these again but would make some other cookie recipe using the colorful sugars.

I made these for the first time today. they are very pretty with the colored sugars, but too sweet, even though I doubled the amount of lemon juice in filling and added some in the dough as well. I skipped the cornstarch and only used flower.that gave it the right consistency to roll the dough by hand . The cookies came out sandy (I baked them for about 12 min) but the smoothness of the filling somewhat offsets that.I'm a little disappointed about that... I replaced the butter in the filling with mascarpone cream cheese and added some yellow food coloring. made that a couple of hrs ahead and chilled it so it was very easy to work with. It came out very smooth and tangy.I have a lot left because I could only use about half a teaspoon for each sandwich. not sure if I'll make them again, but if I do I'll definitely add the cornstarch to see if the original recipe is still sandy.

These are delicious! They are time consuming but they are well worth it. The cookie just melts in your mouth and the filling is really good too.

Yummy cookie! Before I made these cookies, I read all the reviews from this recipe and the identical 2010 recipe. Here are some tips: First, make the filling well in advance and chill. I chilled my frosting 2 hours before starting the cookies, and it was firm and easy to work with. However, it softens up pretty quickly, but never gets runny. Second, make sure to use the SCANT teaspoon when rolling the cookies. Any bigger and they just look weird. Third, press down each ball slightly. After the cookies are done cooking, they will look like the picture: round on top with a flat bottom. You won't have to worry about dumbbell-looking cookies :) Follow these tips, and your cookie will end up looking like the picture. Out of all the cookies I made during the holiday season, this was the crowd favorite. A note about the cornstarch in the cookie: I advise not altering the amount of cornstarch you put in the cookie. If you taste the cookie dough, you will get an overwhelming cornstarchy taste. After it cooks, however, the cornstarch taste is less prevalent. I personally enjoy the slight starch/lemon combo; they work perfectly together. And these cookies are not soft by any means. They can't if you want them to stay put together. But they do melt in your mouth and the contrast of the firm cookie and soft filling in phenomenal. Don't skip these cookies because of the bad reviews! Make them and you won't be sorry! Also, I don't understand the problems people were having with the yield of cookies. I followed the recipe exactly and came out with 58 sandwiches.

The cookies were very tasty, but I had similar issues as other reviewers. The little dough balls were quite tedious to make - I could have used a helper. Also, the frosting got soupy very quickly so I had to keep stopping and putting it back in the refrigerator. Overall, they were beautiful and I got a lot of compliments on the look and taste.

Delicious but not as easy as it could be. The filling is REALLY soft as written, meaning the round cookies have to be perfectly balanced to set without sliding apart. I would add 50% more confectioners sugar to the filling next time. Other than that, these are quick and tasty!

To achieve success with this recipe, here are some helpful hints: 1. Use "tapioca starch" instead of cornstarch. Some people complained of being able to taste the cornstarch. I use a full 6 oz box of tapioca starch, and I can find it in my organic section of my gourmet supermarket. It is more expensive, maybe $4 for the box. Tapioca starch is different than tapioca, if it doesn't say "tapioca starch", than it isn't. 2. Don't use the corn syrup in the buttercream. It makes it too runny. To get the buttercream fluffy, it should be whipped for 3-5 minutes in your mixer. 3. Use a scoop to make the cookies perfectly round. I made the cookies larger, using a #20 scoop. They do take a long time to form and coat with sugar. It helps to have a person helping, or, scoop 10-20 cookies out at a time onto a plate. Then smooth and shape each cookie, dip it and place it on the sheet. It takes MUCH longer scooping, shaping, and dipping each cookie seperately because you have to keep picking up and putting down the scoop. The perfect cooking time for the #20 scoop was bout 15-16 minutes. The cookies just melt in your mouth and the frosting was excellent. We used 6 different colored sugars and ended up with about 100+ sandwiches (can't remember how many batches we made, but it was at least 4) They looked magnificent piled high on a platter and people loved how beautiful they are.

Based on other reviews, I substituted rice flour for corn starch and the cookie tasted just fine. I accidentally overbaked the second batch of cookies by about 20 minutes, and they actually tasted better -- had a nuttiness. I made my dough the night before, removed from fridge 2 hours before proceeding. Pretty, and tasty. The icing is especially great

Definitely chill the filling! Mine was so runny, it slid right off the cookies, and I ended up using only about half of it. They would have been much better with more filling. I did get almost the full number of sandwiches, but rolling all thoses little bits of dough was not my idea of a good time - more trouble than they were worth, I think.

Like others, I got only half the indicated cookies from the recipe, and I felt the cornstarch made them quite dry and gave them an off taste. Too bad, because they are very pretty.

These cookies are pretty heady, but I made them way too big. You really have to make these small if you want them to come out like the picture. Oh, you should use regular lemons if you want that lemony zing.

Overall this was a successful recipe for me: the cookies turned out looking just like the picture, and I think the texture/taste is quite nice (I can taste the cornstarch if I think about it, but if I didn't know it was in there I'm not sure I'd notice). I didn't have to refrigerate the dough before shaping the cookies, but then too, my kitchen is usually kept at about 69 degrees. My two complaints are that, even though I carefully measured my dough portions, the recipe still only made 40 completed sandwich cookies for me, and also, the filling showed a tendency to melt from the heat of my hand while I was filling them. A tip to keep the cookies from sliding apart while cooling: fill them, then set them carefully on a rack -- if you position them right, the wires act as a kind of cradle for each cookie, holding them upright and keeping them from sliding apart.

I have to say that they are not that difficult to make. The issues that people had I believe came from not chilling the dough. The dough should be chilled in between batches to ensure that it stays cold. That will prevent the cookies from spreading so much I think. I used meyer lemons and more than instructed, and still they didnt taste that lemony. They are quite pretty. I provided them at a cookie exchange for my book club and set them next to chocolate truffles for contrast and it looked quite festive. However, as for taste, I agree with one reviewer that you can indeed tast the conrstarch which I didnt favor so much. And the real proof today is that they are still around my house and the other cookies are all gone. So, they are pretty to look at but less tasty than one would hope. BTW- didnt use the paper as I didnt have any- followed the advice of one reviewer and put the cookies on the top third of the oven and it worked fine.

These were as pretty as the picture in Gourmet, but are a bit difficult to keep from sliding apart as the filling dries. But they are delicious and crumbly and melt in your mouth.

These cookies saved Christmas at my house. They gave my anemic holiday spirit a much-needed kick in the butt. They were so easy and cheery that I was inspired to take on a few other holiday tasks, like getting the decorations up. I only yielded about 30 cookies per batch and even though they were not picture perfect, I thought they were pretty.

These came out just as pretty as the photos. I used a small cookie scoop, then cut the scoop in half to form each ball, and thus got the proper yield. Also, I made the dough the night before, and had no problems with it flattening out as it cooked; perhaps the dough should be chilled? I made the filling a few hours before I filled the cookies and also allowed the cookies to cool completely before filling. I used a very small amount of filling, which was fine, since it has a big flavor. I also chilled the finished cookies for an hour to let the filling set. These were a huge hit with my office - they were the first among 8 kinds of cookie to go. Highly recommended!

These were not as pretty as the photo.. Too tipsy and messy...I added extra confectionary sugar to provide enough body so they'd stick. I personally feel they are too awkward to frost and eat.. should make them 1/2 tsp for sure and chill frosting.. and next time I would flatten them out as well.

Easy and pretty cookies. My family loved them although I didn't think they were my favorite. Recipe yielded 42 completed sandwich cookies.

Forgot to add that I sure didn't get 50 sandwiches! I got 50 halves so ended up with 25 cookies. I also mixed the dough and the filling in my food processer, so easy!

Just finished my first batch of these cookies. They taste great and melt in your mouth, but aren't quite as pretty as the picture. I didn't have parchment paper so I made a test cookie without it, just raised the oven rack one notch, and it turned out fine. After the first pan, I flattened the rest of the cookies a little bit and they looked better than my round ones. I also just spread the filling with a knife, didn't bother with the plastic bag. If your filling is too runny, try chilling it for a while.

These turned out as beautiful as the picture. The filling needed a while to set, and in the meantime the tops and bottoms tended to slide around- some needed to be adjusted as they sat. The only thing I would change if I could was the slight cornstarchy taste. Despite that, this is one of my new favorite cookies- so beautiful!

I figured out what I did wrong and my second go around was a success! These are actually quite easy to make and the end result is very impressive looking.

I just finished baking my first batch and these cookies taste divine but mine look a mess. Out of 24 only 2 came out like the picture. And I am having trouble getting the lemon cream to "stick" both sides together. Also, the dough on some of the cookies sort of melted and they came out more pancake looking than half spheres. Any suggestions?

Made these for a cookie exchange; everyone loved them. I followed the recipe exactly; no changes. In making the balls, I found that near the end, the dough was dryer (I think not quite enough butter had mixed into the bottom of the bowl, and I didn't realize it until 3/4 of the dough was rolled with sugar, so there was no going back); they didn't even melt into half circles, but just stayed as balls when baked. Maybe the balls that melted flat had too much butter? I started filling and assembling the cookie sandwiches as soon as the cookies were cool, and had problems with the cream melting. Then I had to deal with children and the whole production had to wait a few hours- and then I found the cream worked great. So wait before assembly.

I made these yesterday too. although not quite as symetical as the picture they tasted light and wonderful. Use a meyers lemon for a really great flavor. The filling is soft at first. I found that after they sat overnight the filling firmed up, so these cookies should be made a day ahead of time. I plan on making these Friday for a cookie exchange on Sunday.
