I like this very much. Yes, a lot of ingredients, but not a problem with a food processor. I also found that canned pineapple is just fine, and is a less expensive choice.

I've made this dish many times over the past 10 years. I've found that you can replace fresh pineapple with canned, if necessary. And I like to add a bit extra honey to the sauce and thicken it a bit. Delish.

Be careful to scrape all the marinade off the chicken or you get a strange pineapple coat. I didn't think this recipe was very good. There are better uses for pineapple and chicken.

I, too, found the sauce too tart so added some pinot during the reducing stage. Everyone loved the result.

For all the work that went into making this dish it was very average! Don't waste your time.

Terrific...worth marinating overnight. We loved it and will make it again.

This was a great dish. I served it as an appetizer, so I cut the chicken in strips and mixed it with the sauce instead of letting the guest dip it. I did think that the remaining sauce, the boiled down sauce was way too tangy so we added some honey to make it sweet and sour and it was great. Also, the taste of the basil seemed to be left out, maybe because it has so many other strong flavors, so I might omit that next time. Other than that, it was delicious!

This marinade was deliciously tangy and sweet. The boiled down sauce was a little tart but I served it over couscous, which sopped it up and cut some of the acidity. It reminded me of some Thai/Asian dishes and I'll probably serve it next time with some kind of fried rice. The only change I made was to leave out the peels and I used canned, drained pineapple chunks rather than fresh. I think that really helped cut the prep time.

This recipe has the most surprising taste; warm, richly layered citrus. It has summer written all through it!

the marinade (and resultant sauce) took a great deal of effort to prepare and was just not worth the trouble. As a sauce, the enriched and boiled-down marinade was just too pasty. Most of my guests preferred the chicken without the sauce. will not make this again - flavor was not good for the amount of effort.

My friends LOVED this recipe & especially the sauce. However, I left out (ok - I actually forgot) the pepper, basil, orange & lime peel. May be that made the recipe quicker but I thought it was pretty speedy to prepare.

Maybe I got lucky, but I did not think that this took long to prepare (there are other dishes on these boards that take considerably longer. I also found the flavor to be freshing and tangy; though the basil does get lost in the shuffle. I would recommend this to anyone...but keep in mind that the jalapeno and black pepper make this spicer than one would think. Give it a whirl; it is a freshing change of pace for chicken breasts.

This dish had a nice flavor and was quite tasty. However, given the degree of preparation required, I was disappointed that the pineapple and basil flavors were totally overwhelmed by the citrus and cilantro. Will probably not bother with it again.

This was an easy, unique and very tasty chicken dish. I will make it many times again. I substituted lemon for lime since I was out of limes and this worked well. One of the more piquant sauces!!

Pineapple flavor was a little too intense for my liking. Definitely let the chicken marinate over night, very tender.

The chicken turned out fine, but the marinade (and resultant sauce) took a great deal of effort to prepare and was just not worth the trouble. As a sauce, the enriched and boiled-down marinade was just too citrus-flavored. It lacked body and subtlety. Most of my guests preferred the chicken without the sauce.

This dish was really delicious! My husband and three teenaged sons couldn't get enough of the sauce, and there was a scramble for second helpings! I served this with an herbed Orzo salad, and the combination of flavors was very pleasing.

Very good! The combinations are fabulous, although I did use dried cilantro and basil instead.

Great flavor combinations and low in fat to boot...what more could one ask for!
