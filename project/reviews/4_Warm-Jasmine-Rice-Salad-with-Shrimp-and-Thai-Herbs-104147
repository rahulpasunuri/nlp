easy lovely tasty light luncheon dish. i served it with a favorite:chilled carrot and coconut soup from this site and a chopped israeli salad that had mint in it so i substituted basil in the rice salad. i didnt have dried shrimp as many others stated. i subbed ground cashews for peanuts. i doubled the recipe but next time will make more of the dressing which was wonderful. i had a funny experience tho' that you should know about. i was using the last of my fish sauce and i noticed some tinkling in the bowl as i put the sauce in. i looked and there were pieces of what looked exactly like broken glass. i called the number on the bottle and was told that it is salt crystals and to warm up the fish sauce. this worked but i had already discarded almost all the fish sauce so filled in with soy sauce. that worked. at any rate my friends thought i was a gourmet chef and suggested i open a restaurant the recipes were that good!

Fantastic and easy! Did not use dried shrimp and didn't have cilantro or lettuce - still was great! Doubled and used 1 lb of shrimp.

The recipe was great but next time I will add some chile oil to give it more kick and i will double the dressing recipe overall.

I made this as written minus the dried shrimp and added some mahi. It's really delicious and different. I would make it again.

This was really great. I didn't have the dried shrimp or cilantro on hand, and the recipe was still turned out well.

this is awesome, even with some necessary modifications due to missing ingredients. used spanish black radish instead of cucumber and didnt have mint. still amazing.

Really love this dish - I've made it numerous times. The fresh herbs with the dressing are outstanding. I hunted down dried shrimp, (I'm a stickler for staying true to the recipe if I can the first time around), and although the smell is less than desirable, I can't imagine getting the same Thai flavor without it. I would highly recommend using it - don't be afraid! My husband didn't notice the smell, so maybe it was just me because I had to grind it up.

This is a summer crowd pleaser! I also didn't have the dried shrimp and left it out. Added julienned red bell pepper and chopped scallions, and substituted jalepeno for the fresno chile pepper.

Added julienne carrots to add crunchiness. This is a version of Bun but instead of the noodles the rice make it!! Did not use any dried shrimp.

Yum, this is one of my favorites! I like to bring it to dinner parties, it's different yet delicious (and pretty!). Didn't have dried shrimp so I skipped it. Increased the peanuts, added bean sprouts for more crunch. Also added soy sauce to the dressing for more salt.

This recipe was great. It's light and yet filling. It's also a good leftover for lunch the next day.

this was absolutely delish--and hot! i used leftover brown rice and natural peanut butter instead of ground peanuts, so it was much more of a creamy dressing. next time i'll try with the ground peanuts instead, but i'm definitely making this again!

I made this recipe as a side dish, leaving out the shrimp. It was wonderful. Didn't have chilis, so I used chili paste (the asian type).

Delicious... Some notes: Couldnt find fish sauce so I used the same amount of water with 1/4tsp of dried dashi stock. Couldnt find chiles so I used red jalapenos which were a bit too spicy. Also I used 1 cup uncooked rice which provided quite a bit more rice per person. Lastly I used frozen pre-cooked medium shrimp - about 16 of them or so. Was delicious, but in the future will definitely double the amt. of ground shrimp & peanuts for the flavor (since I used more rice) ... I served it with Spicy Thai peanut-crusted baked chicken.

I worked for Matt and Bruce when they were opening "Big Bowl Cafe" in Chicago. I was a culinary student at the time and waiting tables at Big Bowl. I was so pleasantly surprised to find this recipe on Epicurious! Way to go, guys. The recipe is flawless and so very, very good. So much flavor! I couldn't find dried shrimp at our grocery store, so I just omitted it and the salad still had plenty of flavor. I used about 16-20 medium-sized shrimp because we were eating this as a main course. I served the rice over greens consisting mostly of arugala and raddichio. I will make this again and again!

Very good. Great Thai taste. I couldn't find ground dried shrimp, so I substituted shrimp powder with chiles. This stuff was pretty hot, so I elminated the fresno chile and added julienned sweet red bell pepper instead. I also added sliced green onions. I didn't think the dressing was enough so I probably tripled the recipe. I substituted basil for the mint leaves too. I served it with lime wedges and thought it tasted great with the fresh lime squeezed over it. It looked great and everyone asked for the recipe. Definitely a keeper.

Yum, not the best ever - but really really good. I suggest thinly slicing some napa cabbage for the salad and even though I am not a huge iceberg fan, I think it works best here.

Very easy and low-fat. My family loved it. I had small shrimp so I steamed them and didn't butterfly them. I added additional mint and cilantro and increased the dressing amount with more lime juice. A delicious blend of flavors for a light summer meal!
