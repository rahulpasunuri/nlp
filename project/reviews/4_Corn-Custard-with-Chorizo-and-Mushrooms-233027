This was the hit of my Easter brunch! Everyone loved it, even a guest that does not like corn.

We made this last night. It was pretty good, but not as impressive as I had hoped. We did add a clove of garlic and a bit of pepper. It was good, but not terrific and we probably won't make it again.

Make this for tailgating. Every time I have to give the recipe to many

Made this almost as written; subbed hatch peppers for the jalepeno, fresh corn for frozen and low fat milk, and served for dinner. It really is more of a lunch or brunch dish, but I served it with a nice green salad and it was satisfying to me. My only problem is not with the recipe, but my oven; it went a little crazy (some code popped up) and the top was burned...in spite of that it was really tasty!!!

Really this is a 3.5 star recipe...very solid and flexible. The mushrooms added very little flavor...will try with green peppers instead next time. Also, my oven runs low yet this dish was ready is 1 hour...I suggest you keep an eye on the dish...I bet 45 to 50 minutes is all it needs.

It turned out great-very moist and flavorful!

This recipe is a true crowd pleaser. I have made this recipe many times in my holiday breakfast's.

Made for a brunch and everyone loved it! I also multiplied this by 1.5 and used a 9x13 pan and it worked well. I used 1.25 pounds of chorizo, but should have increased the mushrooms, too. My food processor died so I used 1/4 cup of the milk so that the blender could handle it, and that worked well.

I made this for Christmas brunch and it was a big hit. I'm not much for measuring, so I threw in as much chorizo as I had. I used cremini mushrooms, but honestly, am not sure that this ingredient is essential. I like lots of chorizo, good sweet corn, and sharp cheddar in combo with the Jack. Definitely don't skimp on the jalapenos, and I think the presentation would be better if the items were better incorporated and not so "layered." (The sausage and mushrooms stayed too close to the bottom) All in all a winner, and different from your typical breakfast casserole.

I think I'm missing something... this was just ok. I doubled the sausage (as was suggested earlier) and if not for that, it would have almost no taste at all... do I need more jalapeno? some italian seasoning? different kind of cheese? like I said, it's ok, but it seems like it should be better...

I loved this! Not much to say that hasn't been said already... I will double the chorizo and mushrooms next time, and I'm confident that you can add a number of things to suit your mood (spinach, etc.). The corn makes it a unique dish for brunches, but not too hard to make or different-tasting for group to enjoy. Very tasty, very solid recipe that I will absolutely make again and again!

Made this for sunday brunch, and it was a huge hit -- I made no changes or substitutions, I will try to add some more mushrooms next time, but it was perfect as is! The prep work was a little time consuming, and since we loved it hot and fluffy out of the oven the next time I will prepare everything except the eggs the night before and just layer it up and cook it in the morning.

This was novel and good; I'll make it again.

Made this for a block party yesterday. It was absolutely fabulous!!! As another reviewer stated, i would add more chorizo to this dish

I used fresh corn, since it was in season and gourmet sausage instead of chorizo (people who radically alter recipes annoy me too, but in my defense, the sausage has a fraction of the fat while still being packed with flavour!) It turned out wonderfully. Like other reviewers, I found I preferred the recipe with more mushrooms, so I doubled the quantity. Point being, you can embellish a lot with this recipe and it still turns out great!

Worked out awesome, have made this a couple times. Recommend doubling the chorizo for a more meaty, less-subtle taste.

Fan-F$@#ing-tastic!!! My guests raved about this one. I would probably double the amounts on the chorizo and mushrooms next time, however. And be sure to thaw the corn out as specified. I missed that step and had an interesting morning. :o)

Made this for Thankgiving as an alternative to the usual side veggie dishes. Even the picky eaters loved it. I also make a great breakfast version, substituting breakfast sausage for the chorizo, and adding sauteed spinach and mushrooms. Wonderful!

Fantastic! As usual, I felt compelled to lighten it up, so I omitted the oil and 2 of the egg yolks, and used skim milk and reduced fat cheese. It turned out beautifully, and the leftovers re-heated nicely too. Thanks!

A wonderful recipe. Good for dinner and for brunch parties. I loved it!

Omigod! This was lovely! Made just as directed (except 1-1/2 times the ingredients in a 9 x 13 glass dish). Light but delicious comfort food. You could play with all kinds of other ingredients, I'm sure.

Yum! Modified this with veggie (soy) chorizo and neufchatel cheese. Warm and comforting!

I made this in a baking that was a bit too big and it was rather dry. I used the larger pan because it looked like the mixture would spill over in the dish size specified. I'll try it again in a smaller dish. Also, I might mix the meat and mushrooms into the batter, rather than lay them on the bottom.

Delicious! I cut recipe in half and baked in 9 X 9 pan. Made perfect 4 main dish servings, along with salad. Everything was just as called for in recipe, except for chorizo, which I used about half less than recipe called for (so half of half). Baked about 55 minutes.

delicious. made for sunday brunch. substituted chicken sausage for chorizo. less fatty, still yummy. this is great comfort food...

I made this dish by the letter (although discarded the insane amount of fat that came out of my chorizo). It was very tasty, but seemed unnecessarily heavy and fattening. If I make it again, I'll definitely modify, probably with some combination of less chorizo, less monterey jack, reduced fat milk, and the neufchatel cream cheese. Maybe more cornmeal. Also, I would use more jalapeno next time. I used one chile, which came out to about 1.5 tbsp, but I like it spicier.

Made it healthier by substituting egg beater for whole eggs and neufchatal instead of cream cheese. It was still really awesome!

Cooked this dish last night, it is wonderful. My husband is a big fan of chorizo and the corn, eggs and cheese made this a very light dish. This will become a regular at our house!
