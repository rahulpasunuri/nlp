I only made the fish and served it with roasted asparagus and an Asian salad made with red cabbage, cucumbers, carrots, scallions and a light dressing made from the miso sauce. The fish and miso recipe was spot on with two exceptions: salt the fish slightly before putting on the sauce and then marinade it in the sauce for 30 minutes before cooking. With these very slight adjustments, I will make this recipe many times, I am sure.

Made the cod and the wasabi mashed potatoes: whereas the sauce and the baking method for the fish was fantastic, I didn't care for the wasabi potatoes (but my wasabi powder may be at fault here). Definitely a crowd pleaser: we served this with grilled asparagus and the mashed potatoes. Next time I might reduce the amount of miso as it makes a very thick sauce, but guests loved it and added spoonfuls to dip the asparagus and mix in the potatoes.

I liked the flavors but I used cheap frozen cod and it def affected the outcome of the dish. Next time I might pan sear the fish and then add the glaze and broil to finish it off. It is essential to get the glaze to carmelize, otherwise the miso can taste a bit "yeasty" as another reviewer described. Wasabi mashed potatos are a great accompaniment.

Delicious and nutritious, a sprinkle of scallions pairs nicely with miso. We did not drizzle additional sauce over the dish, there was enough flavour in both the cod and the wasabi potatoes.

Chives are the perfect garnish for both the fish and potatoes.

The miso glaze is excellent on fish but also very good brushed on asparagus before grilling. The wasabi mashed potatoes are such a great combination with the glazed fish.

I had this dish at the restaurant. Be aware, use yellow miso, use fresh fish.....it will be delicious. A small amount of sauce (minimalist) on the plate is al that is needed. A sprinkling of herbs (cilantro) helps.

This was absolutely fantastic! The glaze/sauce was fabo and I wouldn't change a thing. The wasabi mashed were perfect as written - a nice subtle wasabi flavor not at all overwhelming.

I made this exactly according to the recipe except I used chilean sea bass filets instead of cod and broiled longer to accomodate the thickness. The sauce was very good, my boyfriend said it tasted restaurant quality. It is however very strongly flavored. Upon serving, I spooned extra sauce over the fish and mashed potatoes which made it overpowering. The simplicity of the potatoes compliment the strong flavor of the sauce on the fish. Worth making but don't bother drizzling sauce over the potatoes! Wasabli mashed potatoes were perfect. They have a mild wasabi taste, (more aromatic than a flavor) but this mildness goes well with the fish.

Looking at the negative reviews of this recipe, I wonder if some of the reviewers had something else in mind when they chose to make this one. I didn't make the potatoes-- served it with plain jasmine rice and a baby bok choy stirfry with garlic, ginger, scallions and a dash each of soy and mirin--and I roasted the cod instead of broiling it. However, I made the recipe for the miso glaze as directed. It was just like the miso glaze I have had on sablefish in various restaurants over the years--savory, a tad sweet, not dramatic, and very tasty on the fish. I will use it on other fishes since I think it will be a nice and easy flavor enhancer. I served this with a fairly dry riesling. Everyone had seconds.

Rating: 3
I don't use the container of Miso anymore. It's too heavy on the taste of the fish & cod catches flavor quickly. I suggest the packages of miso poweder instead. And def make sure you are broiling at the very end to get the glaze. I forgot to and it looked like i was serving human parts.

My husband and I thought this was wonderful. It was so quick and easy too. I made the recipe exactly as written except I let the cod marinate for at least an hour before putting it in the oven. I served the extra marinade on the side after reading all of the bad reviews but we loved it! I served the cod with wasabi mashed potatoes with sauteed green onions in sesame oil (another recipe from epicurious) and I always double or triple the wasabi. All in all, I thought this was a great meal and it was even better the next day!

Delish! I agreed with a comment below: I didn't put any sugar in, but just a squeeze of honey. I also added a bit of lime juice to the marinade and it turned out really well. I opted not to drizzle more of the sauce on the fish once cooked, but I am going to use the extra marinade to season some grilled tofu another night.

This was awful. I followed the recipe exactly as stated and had to throw out all of the fish because it was basically inedible.

Rating: 1
The miso so totally overwhelmed the delicate taste of the cod that it seemed like a disconnected element. A fraction of the miso called for would have been sufficient, and adding the extra marinating glaze atop the fish before broiling not necessary or desirable.

The Miso Glaze was dull and disapointing.

Rating: 4
Very nice. The readiness of the fish is self-evident, as the filets flake beautifully within the time frame in the recipe. Sweet, light, lovely. Perhaps a bit more soy & cayene, but otherwise--Yum. Try it w/ sake instead of wine.

Rating: 3
The miso tastes great, though it is extremely salty - I would leave the soy sauce out next time. The cooking directions for the cod were perfect and the fish came out flaky, thoroghly done - yet moist. The extra sauce is not needed and does not go well at all with the potatoes which are not worth the effort.

Rating: 4
The glaze was very fast to make, and tasted fantastic on the cod. The cod browned nicely, and didn't really need the additional half of miso glaze after baking. I cut down the oil and sugar, without compromising taste. Great for a fast and delicious meal anytime.

just made the miso glaze w/o the potatoes side-dish and loved it. used very good black cod and it came out just like those fancy dishes restaurants charge $25+ for! i would definitely make it again. i had fewer cods so i eyeballed the recipe but it came out very juicy and flavorful.

I'm surprised by all the high marks this dish has gotten. The miso was too overpowering and tasted yeasty. The potatoes on the other hand were bland--I was disappointed because I like wasabi potatoes. Maybe they needed more wasabi (like 10 times more).

This dish rocks! You can use any type of miso, I suggest tasting as you go and the combo may be whisked in a bowl for easier prep/cleaning. Not sure the cayenne is very necessary.

Rating: 4
I absolutely love this recipe. I've made it with good quality cod as well as halibut, and it has turned out perfect every time. Guests rave about this one. I never use the full 1/4 c. of oil, as I find that 1/8 c. is sufficient, and I add thinly julienned scallions as a garnish. Other than that, there is no need to change a thing as far as I'm concerned.

This dish is fantastic! I LOVE that the fish and miso make a gravy automatically! Just scrape the yummy deliciousness up and into a gravy boat. Do NOT use a different kind of fish....I did and it was GROSS! Use only the top notch cod and you will not be unhappy. I can also fool myself thinking that the gravy has little fat and calories because it is mostly miso. :) Oh: I always need to make the mashed potatos more wasabi-i.

This dish was amazing. This sweet gravy is such a treat drizzled on the mashed potatoes and many other things. Yummy!

Hey New York, I just made this delicious dish and I used a broiling pan...sprayed with a bit of canola oil spray first. No sticking and no major liquid problems. My guests licked up the yumminess. I will definitely make this again and also...we hated the mashed potatoes. I guess I love wasabi, and mashed potatoes, but miles from each other!

Rating: 3
I've made this dish a number of times, and I will happily make it again. HOWEVER, every time I've prepared the recipe, following the cooking instructions carefully, I've always had the same unappealing result: the fish always gives off a whole lot of liquid (first on the cookie sheet, and then on the plate, where it ends up lying in a really unapealing, soupy mess). I can't attribute this to the quality or type of fish I'm using (I've tried different kinds of filets, and I'm buying from a very reputable fish market with high turnover). Does anyone have any thoughts as to why this happens, or how to prevent this? If it weren't for the ooze, this recipe would be a four-forker.

Excellent! I used wasabi from the tube for the potatoes because the paste always tastes funny to me. Fish and potatoes were both fantastic.

a very impressive dish and so easy. I have made it many times with various adjustments. the best is using chile garlic sauce instead of cayenne, double the amount of rice vinegar and substitute honey for the sugar. The potaoes are amazing as well, I like to use LOTS of wasabi paste and heavy cream. My guests always rave!

this dish is so amazing! And incredibly easy. I used chile garlic sauce instead of cayenne and doubled the amount of rice vinegar. The 2nd time I made this I used honey instead of sugar and it was fabu! Also using wasabi paste instead of powder for the potatoes helped alot. I brought the 1/2&1/2, butter and wasabi paste to a simmer then mashed the potatoes with them,they were so creamy!

great recipe! The cod with the wasabi potatoes made each more creamy. i doubled the amount of wasabi to get a fuller flavor. will definitely make both of these dishes again!

I was astonished to find that this miso glaze exactly reproduces the wonderful Japanese flavor that I have been searching for ever since I left Japan. I incorporated it into a Japanese meal so didn't try the mashed potatoes, but as far as the fish is concerned I would not change a thing, except maybe try it with other kinds of fish. It is a winner.

The miso sauce was excellent. I used salmon instead of cod. I added a little chili-garlic sauce instead of the cayenne and scallions to the mashed potatoes. I seared some baby bok choy in peanut oil, stacked the potatoes on top, and then placed the fish on the very top and drizzled with sauce. It looked impressive.

Rating: 3
I had red miso in the house so used it. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and the result was great. My guests raved and asked for the recipe. I think you need to serve the mashed potatoes to contrast with the full-flavored fish. I served the Stir fried Bok Choy also on this site. Awesome presentation!

As an American living in Singapore for 12 years, we enjoy Asian food. This recipe was VERY easy to make and impressive for guests. The wasabi mashed potatoes are a perfect match! I used black cod and followed the recipe.

Although it didn't taste exactly like the Miso Cod you'd get at a Japanese resteraunt, it was really yummy and not too salty. (Miso can be salty!) This was very easy for a novice cook like me...and I served it with the wasabe potatoes - a hit! I also did snow peas and sliced siitake mushrooms sauted with Sweet Chili Suace for Chicken. Very simple and tasty.

The leftover sauce went unused, as the cod had plenty of flavor from the marinade.

I found this recipe disappointing. I am a moderately experienced cook and usually my dishes turn out. I thought the sauce was really strong and not really complex in its flavors. It just tasted like miso. However, I would try this again with modifications and perhaps black cod. First I will try the famous Nobu recipe.

I made fish and wasabi mashed potatoes last night amd my fiance was extremely impressed. It was extremely simple, very elegant and will become a regular dinner feature at our house. I did use black grouper instead of black cod and red miso instead of yellow. I will definitely be using the miso marinade in other recipes.

I used black sea bass on the grill instead of the cod. My boyfriend enjoyed the glaze, but I found it just OK, and a bit too much for my tastes. I remedied the situation by scraping as much of it off the fish as I could. Served with the wasabi potatoes (great!) and sesame stir-fried asparagus (also great!).

Rating: 3
This was a tasty dish -- fairly simple to make (although it helps if you've already aquired some of the oils, etc. that you often use for asian cooking). Perhaps I made too much sauce, but we ended up scraping some of it off, so that it would be a bit lighter. The wasabi mashed potatoes complimented the cod wonderfully.

Rating: 3
This dish was flavorful, and best of all, quick and easy. I found black cod fillets at Whole Foods so I used them. Delicious! I too used white miso and thought the glaze was terrific. Your guests will think you spent all day on this. I served it with the Wasabi Mashed Potatoes and a stir-fry of snow peas and mushrooms, and then topped the whole thing off with a garnish of Thai Basil chiffonade. It looked as good as it tasted.

From the rave reviews, I was so excited about making this recipe. I whipped up the sauce (easy) and then a bell rang in my feeble brain. I went to my PC recipe files and found I'd been making this very same miso glaze for years, with great success. Usually I put it on tilapia fillets, because cod and Chilean sea bass are scarce in my area. Anyway, its a terrific glaze and sauce. I'm confessing what I did with the wasabi mashed potatoes under that recipe's reviews.

I have made this recipe many, many times. It is simple and incredibly delicate and delicious--IF you use black cod (sablefish). The first time I made it with regular cod. It was okay, but not great. Then I was able to find black cod, and tried it--PHENOMENAL. I have made it with black cod many times since, and will no longer make it with regular cod--the regular cod just doesn't do the recipe justice. Also, the potatoes definitely need more wasabi powder than suggested.

Rating: 3
The cod was excellent- I used white miso because I couldn't find yellow and it worked great. I didn't put in the entire 1/2 stick of butter so the potatoes were a little dry, so I added some lowfat margarine. The sauce from the fish also helped. My husband and company loved this!

Unfortunately, we had leftover miso glaze... and kept licking it with our fingers! The glaze is GREAT! FYI, line your cookie sheet with foil, then you won't have the clean-up problem.

Unbelievable. I'm about to make this for the second time this week. I increased the wasabi by 4 times as others had recommended, I used sea bass which was incredible, and I used white miso because I couldn't find yellow. This is by far the best fish dish (and easy too) that I have ever made!!

My first review ever but I use the site all the time. This recipe is YUMMY and yes, as everyone has said already: EASY. My mom makes a very similar sauce for firm tofu which is very yummy as well. The sugar in the sauce will quickly burn under the broiler so be sure to use a thick-bottomed broiler pan or else you will ruin your cookie sheet.

Rating: 4
A winner! This dish has become a favorite at home, and always impresses dinner party guests. Instead of potatoes, I serve the cod with stir-fried, julienne vegetables (such as zucchini, green onions, carrots, bok choy, sugar snap peas) seasoned with fish sauce, lime juice, sesame oil and sambal ulek. Also, I don't cook the fish as long as suggested (after broiling, I just turn off the over and let it sit for 3 minutes so it doesn't overcook). Usually a salad follows, with a soy/sesame vinaigrette and rice crackers. A crisp, clean white wine complements all the dishes. Yum!

I've made this recipe several times and have always had rave reviews. Aside from its great flavor, it saved me recently when a mango I had for a salsa let me down and I had to scurry for another solution for my sea bass - I had all the ingredients on hand to make this one. Once again, I got raves.

This was absolutely fantastic. I used Chilean Sea Bass - it was amazing. I have had a very similar dish at a nearby restaurant (Candela) made with Black Cod, and always wished I had a recipe to make it at home. This is it! I didn't make the potatoes, but made the Braised Baby Bok Choy instead - it went perfectly with the fish.

Should be served with a green vegetable (without the sauce on it!) to break up the strong, salty and sweet flavored miso sauce. The potatoes are excellent and I would definately try them again, maybe with a roast beef.

Absolutely wonderful!! Unfortunately I could find any Cod so I used Salmon and Chilian Sea Bass. The Sea Bass was the best. It was firm and took on all the flavor of the recipe. I also used white miso instead of yellow which gave it a milder taste. Truly restaurant quality per the Mr.

I used this recipe in an Asian-themed dinner party and got rave reviews. It was quite tasty and everyone wanted the recipe. I personally thought the sauce was a touch too heavy, but everyone disagreed with me (maybe they were being polite since I cooked). I used Halibut instead of Cod. It was good, though, and definitely easy to make for a dinner party if you make the sauce ahead of time. Just don't overcook the fish. That always ruins everything.

This has become one of my favorite dishes - it's easy and delicious. I find that using black cod makes all the difference in taste. Black cod costs alot more and is more difficult to find than plain old cod, but it makes this dish sublime.

I didn't use cod filet; I mixed with salmon; it was delicious! To make it to be more flavor, instead of vinega, I used a little water and cooking wine with miso mixture so paste stays less thickness,and soak it 1/2 to 1hour. Then bake it. I assure you, you will enjoy it better. It sure is a wonderful dish to make again!

WOW!!! Talk about restaurant quality meal at home...this with the Wasabi Mash Potatoes was a perfect 10 and prepared in 45 minutes!

absolutely delicious, just as tasty as in the restaurant and so easy to make. I would use low sodium soy sauce though, and put the extra miso glaze on the side, since it is a bit salty to put over the fish once it has already been glazed and cooked with it.

This was an incredibly quick and easy dish to make (once you locate the miso paste) and would work well for a dinner party since all the fish would cook at the same time. For a non fish lover like me, this recipe is a keeper.
