I am giving this 4 forks because everyone devoured it, after several modifications were made as previously suggested. Added extra 8 ox cream cheese, 1 more egg and 4 more ox of white chocolate. I personally thought it was too much cream cheese to both the flavor and the texture.

Easily the most beautiful cheesecake I've ever made! Made changes similar to those other users have mentioned: Made a graham cracker crust instead of the Nilla wafer one. I took others comments re: amount of filling into consideration and added another 8 oz block of cream cheese, 1 more egg, and a total of 7 oz of white chocolate, then I put it in a 9-inch springform and it was the perfect amount. Used frozen berries in the middle and heaped fresh ones on top. Was a huge huge hit at Easter this year!

Sensational :) Made a number of changes to the original recipe, though. Used almonds and honey graham crackers for the base, added sugar and more butter to it as well. The batter baked up to perfection. Light, creamy and delicious. Experienced a few brown spots on the top of my cake but all was fixed with the sour cream topping.

I have a fair number of favorite dessert recipes but friends are choosing this one hands down. None want too much of the yummy leftovers because they know they'd eat it...diets be gone and such. My suggestions: Try Trader Joes vanilla wafers w/vanilla bean flecks--nice color and MUCH better flavor than the 'nilla wafers or graham crackers. I boosted the white choc to 8oz (2 bars of Ghiradelli's) but the gr cardemon really made it (subtle). BTW, no one ever guessed the "mystery" ingred: white choc. It's a winner.

I guess all the rave reviews are from better chefs than I, or at least those who are able to fill in the blanks (seriously, steps are missing) and wing it. This CLEARLY is a doubled recipe and should say so, but I made it anyway because of the rating. I'm going to take it to a dinner tomorrow with friends, so right now it's sitting in my refrigerator along with my hope that all the hassle was worth it. Thanks to all the heads-up warnings from other reviewers -- but you Epicurious folks really should ride better herd over the recipes. This is the second recipe in a row where either the amounts or temperatures or times were way off.

This was my first attempt at making this recipe and I would definitely make it again. I made it for a dinner party last night and it was a hit. I know this because when I tried to take a slice of cheesecake home with me, I was told by the host that the cheesecake was not leaving the house. :) Overall the recipe is great but I do admit I made some changes. Instead of the vanilla wafer crust, I made a graham cracker pecan crust with 2 cups of finely crush graham crackers, 1/2 cup of finely chopped pecan and 6 tbsp of butter. The filling is perfect without adding the raspberries and the topping was great. I finished the cheesecake by adding fresh raspberries along the edge of the cheesecake.

I made this for a dinner party. The overall consensus was that it was very good, but it was not my favorite cheesecake. I agree with previous reviews that there was not enough filling. I also did not particularly like the crust...too much almond, not flavorful enough. The texture of the filling was slightly grainy also.

Rating: 3
This is really tasty. The white chocolate is a delicious combination with the raspberries. But there is something wrong with the amounts as written. I needed to add 50% percent more filling to make an 8-inch cheesecake, and it sounds like other reviewers even doubled it. It's best on day 4 or 5. Make it way ahead. I might make a graham cracker crust next time. For me, this crust was too almondy. A little dark chocolate melted on top was a nice addition.

I have made this several times a year since it was published in Bon Appetite. It is by far the most requested specialty desert by my children. I made it for a church auction several years ago and it brought in the most donations and is requested every year.

I have made this cheesecake about 4 times since it was first published in 1994. It always gets rave reviews. I break up the preparataion so that it's not all done at once. I also make it 48 hours in advance so that it has time to set and the flavors meld. I make the crust one night and the refrigerate it. Then I bake the cheesecake the next night. On the night before I am serving this I do the sour cream topping. Just before serving I will add the raspberries on top and brush them with the jam. This year I entered it in our county fair and won 3rd place with it. It's truly a winner :D

Almost perfect... would have used a bit more white chocolate (or scrapped it altogether and called it a raspberry cheesecake and it would have been phenomenal as just that) -- also would have used one more 8-oz package of cream cheese, if only to make more filling.

I have made this several times and it has always been a great hit. My family loves it . . . . but I omit the white chocolate, and make a chocolate covered raspberry cheesecake. I follow the chocolate truffle recipe and pour it over the top of the cheesecake after it has cooled. Then back into the frig it goes. If you are a chocolate lover -- especially a dark chocolate lover . . . . this is just the best.

Really tasty dessert that turned out to be a hit for Thanksgiving dinner! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and doubled the recipe, increased the amount of the white chocolate, and used Lorna Doone cookies for the crust. I found the Lorna Doones too greasy and next time I'll just use graham crackers (I don't like vanilla wafers). The other thing I should have done was use my BIGGEST springform pan since I doubled the amount of batter. I have a 12" pan and wish I'd used it. It took much longer to bake than the recipe indicated, which makes sense if one is doubling the amount of batter. I ended up leaving the cheesecake out over- night to cool and didn't decide to do the sourcream topping until the next morning. However, it still turned out okay. The only other suggestion I have is to make sure the raspberries are good and thawed! I ran out of time and had start cooking before they were completely thawed. However, it was still a good dessert and I plan to make it again.

Fantastic cheesecake. Doubled the recipe and made for Father's day to rave reviews. Only had one small slice left over after everyone left. This goes to the top of my list along with the cranberry swirl cheescake. Baked the double recipe in a 10 inch spring form and baked for 1 hr 10 min. It craked slightly as it rose almost over the pan but when it cooled the crack disappeared.

Made this for a dinner party and used the crust recommendations and added 6 oz white chocolate, fantastic. Used shortbread cookies as we do not have Lorna Doone here in Sydney.

I have made this dessert twice - my future mother-in-law says it's better than her cheesecake, so I'd call that a ringing endorsement. :) I double the recipe, and the white chocolate amount, and it comes out beautifully. I also skip the jam and just put berries on top of the sour cream.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe - added 1 cup of cream with melted white chocolate in cake per other reviewer - crust change was 1 1/2 cup ground nilla waffers, 1 1/2 cup ground almond, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4+ cup melted butter - bring crust about 2" up side of 10"w pan - put 3/4 cup of raspberrys inside cake per recipe - did not add whole raspberry to top but criss-crossed warm raspberry jelly and melted while chocolate on top

Excellent. I have made this 5 times. It is a winner. I have even made 2 at the same time and used 2 different springform pans- the better pan always produced a better cheesecake.

Rating: 4
Live dangerously: Add a scant 1 teaspoon of cardamon to the filling (and 1/8 t. or less of cardamon to sour cream topping, if you like). If you decide to add cardamon, use almonds & vanilla wafers (or, preferably, shortbread) in the crust. A chocolate or oreo crust would compete with the cardamon. I also like to add 1/4 cup heavy cream to the filling, as I think the cake is a bit too dense without it.

Rating: 3
This was very good, but not excellent (as I was hoping it would be based on the reviews). The texture was fine but not spectacular, and I would have preferred to taste the chocolate a bit more. I also found the crust to be a bit too particular--in retrospect I wish I had ground it much finer.

Rating: 4
I've probably made this 20+ times since the recipe was first published -- people just go crazy over it. I've started baking them for friends for B-day and Christmas presents. I follow others' suggestions (Lorna Doones, no almonds, 6oz white chocolate). I typically make it with either raspberries or blueberries, depending on which look nicer at the grocery. Either way, it's delicious and beautiful!

I made this cake for a co-worker who was leaving. As everyone was eating, someone asked him, "would you please come back next Friday and leave again?" It was truly amazing. Thanks to the other reviewers who recommended using Lorna Doones for the crust and 6 oz. of white chocolate (the perfect amount ... you could taste it but it wasn't overpowering). I also did not put the raspberries in the filling and there was more than enough raspberry flavor. Once again, Epicurious done me right!

Delicious! This is my first cheesecake, and I found the directions of this recipe to be pretty easy to follow. My husband says it is the best cheesecake he's had in his entire life! I would make it again for him, although I'm not entirely satisfied with the filling : it tasted good but was a bit too dense for me. I did everything as directed except for the crust: I used home-made white chocolate and almonds cookies instead of wafers from the store, and I'm so glad I did, it was so yummy!! I topped the cake with raspberries and added a little bit a gelatin to the seedless raspberry jam to make it more jelly-like. It was a beautiful cheesecake and I would give it 3 and a half stars if I could.

to ladyneptune, the way to do a water bath without getting the water into the springform is to use a LOT of aluminum foil. first take the bottom, put silver foil on it with it hanging off to the height of your pan on each side, then put the springform part on top and close it, pulling up the silver foil along the outside of the pan after. then put the pan on another sheet of aluminum foil and cover up the sides. this should keep any (or at least most) water from getting into the pan. whenever i have to use a water bath i do this and the cakes come out great.

I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and used a different crust. I just don't like store packaged cookies--too many horrible ingredients (like partially hydrogenated oils). I made a simple shortbread type crust, added 1/4 cup almonds and a bit more sugar, then baked it in a 9-inch springform pan at 300 for about 20 mins till gold. I was going to add more chocolate (I used Ghiardelli), but wound up having to double the recipe in order to fill the entire pan. Next time I would definitely add more chocolate, as I didn't taste the chocolate as much as I'd hoped. Everyone loved this cake, but I was a tiny bit disappointed--after reading these reviews I thought this was going to have me down on my knees. The cake did crack--after reading the instructions on this site for the NY Cheesecake I now know why--the temp needs to be very high for ten minutes, then lowered to 200 for quite a while. However, this was almost a blessing, because I had decided not to make the sour cream topping, but when I saw the cracks I wanted something to cover them. Hence, I made the sour cream topping and am so glad that I did. Oh do make that part; don't skip it. It was heavenly. I used frozen organic berries and it was fine. I think next time, other than changing the temps/cook time, I will try a water bath (but HOW in a springform, w/out the water getting inside?), and make a raspberry coulis to go with it. Very, very good, got rave reviews. I just need to tweak this a bit. Also--do check out the NY Cheesecake recipe on this site. We'll be making that for Easter and are really looking forward to it. Now, we just have to eat the rest of this one in order to get the springform pan and the cake plate back--oh, such torture. Maybe we'll have it for breakfast!

This is a standard recipe in our family but with a different crust. I did not like the crust (no surprise) and tried an oreo crumb crust. It was a huge hit. I make this even in the winter with raspberries frozen from my patch. (Drain!!) I leave off the fresh on top in the winter as they are just so expensive. No one seems to mind. I have offered a sieved raspberry sauce to compensate but most folks like it just fine plain.

I first made this cheesecake in 1999 and I've made it a thousand times since then. People absolutely rave over it. I have used different berries and even changed the white chocolate for 4ozs of marcarpone just for a change sometimes, it comes out delicious every single time. Truly one of the best.

I made this recipe for a July long week-end BBQ & it was a HUGE hit. I substituted fresh raspberries for wild blueberries as they were in season at the time. I beg to differ on the crust - it was a nice change from graham cracker.

Beautiful presentation, easy and it tastes as wonderful as it looks! Very creamy texture. Many negative comments about the nut crust so I skipped them completely and used an entire box (10oz?)of Lorna Doone shortbread cookies insteady. Glad I did since everyone raved about the crust. With or without nuts this recipe requires more cookies than listed. Next time I'll try a chocolate crust or different berry.

I made this cheesecake by request of my boyfriend who loves raspberries and cheesecake. It turned out amazing! I didn't have an 8" springform, so I used my 7" one. It needed to bake a little longer than called for since it was taller, and the top browned more than I would have liked, but the topping fixed that and when the cake chilled, you couldn't even tell! Even chilling the cake for a day still left the cheesecake softer than I would like, but it tasted like heaven! My boyfriend polished it off in under 2 days, eating it for breakfast, lunch and dinner! I will make this again and again, but I think I'll invest in an 8" pan first! DELICIOUS!!!!!

I made this exactly as written, and thought that it was just okay. Even used the heart shaped pan. I've had much better cheesecakes. This one lacked something. There are MUCH better crusts out there. If I make it again (which I probably won't), I would use a different crust. Also, if you are using a dark or nonstick pan, you need to turn the heat down 25 degrees and cook it a little longer, or else it will get too brown. Think I keep looking for a better recipe.

Delicious! A true four-fork dessert. The delicate white chocolate flavor enhances the cheesecake flavor, and the lemon peel complements the cake perfectly. With a modest 2 pkgs. of cream cheese, note that this is a smaller scale cheesecake. The topping ingredients were perfect; I wouldn't change a thing. The only recipe modification I would make is to the crust; increasing the wafers and decreasing the almonds. Otherwise, this is sheer perfection!

I was wondering if someone could help me...? I just popped this cake in the oven but not sure if I should start over. After melting the chocolate I think I let it sit 5 minutes too long. It started to slightly solidify again. When I added it to the filling there were little lumps of white chocolate throughout. Will this change the cake at all? Is it worth it to start over? I have the time, but I'd rather not due to cost. What to do? This cake is for my holiday party. Help!

I used a chocolate crust with cinnamon and sugar instead. I prepared it in a 9" springform pan and should have increased the filling and topping (more cheesecake to love!).

Loved this recipe when it first came out, still have the original magazine with the beautiful picture...but it is easier to look up the recipe on the web than to find the original in my cluttered house. I've made this twice, the first for my wife as a surprise for Valentines and the second for a wedding....both were well-received. This Valentines I'm making it again as a surprise for my wife. Love the suggestions from others, so I'll probably add the extra wafers and white chocolate. I will also use 8 oz cream cheese and 8 oz marscapone to kick it up a notch, this has worked well before. I'll use the next couple days to scour the city for out-of-season fresh raspberries...I usually have no trouble finding them. Happy Valentines everybody!

I've been making this cheesecake ever since the recipe first appeared in '94, sometimes as many as ten times a year! I always get rave reviews and am frequently asked to make it for parties. I use a chocolate crust instead of the vanilla one, and I use a circular springform pan. Don't overdo the berries in the filling, or you will get a soggy plate. I've had great success with covering the top with berries and drizzling with several types of chocolate. You must try this one!

This is a delicious cheesecake! The one thing I would change is the crust - I felt the toasted almonds were too intense a flavor for such a delicate filling. Next time I will try either the 'all vanilla wafer' crust or the 'shortbread' crust that were both mentioned in other reviews. It was very simple to prepare and seeing how I decided to start making it at 9pm - this was a plus. The raspberries I used were fresh from a friends organic garden - another plus to such a wonderful dessert! The presentation had people not wanting to cut into such a beautiful piece of work - I did use a heart shaped springform pan to bake it in. Thanks for the great recipes! I check Epicurious daily on-line to find what I can 'wow' people with next time.

This cheesecake is super-duper-fabulous! I made several modifications because I didn't have alot of $$ to spend. First, the crust required 35-40 WAFERS, NOT 18!! I like a thick side crust, so this may be part of the reason. I used FROZEN raspberries INSIDE the cake, but a 1/2 pint of fresh ones on the top for presentation. I only used Nestle's white confection ($2 a box) and the cake was still fabulous without the fancy Lindt stuff! I did add 6 oz. instead of 4 though! Also, I did not have seedless jam, so I just strained my seeded jam that was on sale! Also, I took the other persons suggestion to put the cheesecake on a bed of Chambord and Raspberry Jam, and people FLIPPED!! Everyone loved it, and oooohed and ahhhed at the dinner party, so I would absolutely make it again... Be sure to make it 1 day ahead and chill it overnight!!!!!!!!!

I made this for a party and it was a huge hit! Some changes and advice: 1. I increased the cookies to 24 because of the comments I read. It was great. Use your fingers to press the crust in the pan evenly. 2. For the crust, buy blanched almonds and toast in a oven. Spread in one layer on a cookie sheet and put in a cold oven - then heat to 350. 12-15 minutes. Keep an eye on them so they do not burn. 3. Use good quality white chocolate! I used Lindt. Fresh ingredients and good quality make all the difference in the world! Have fun.

Outstanding!!!! I made the recipe in a 12 inch sprinform pan and adjusted the amounts 1 1/2 times. It was delicious. I can't wait to make it again!

I originally prepared this recipe in Feb of 94 for a tea time at my home. It was a great sucess. Since then I have made it many times always I receive rave reviews! It is a time consuming recipe and requires delicate preparation but to anyone wanting a truly magnificent cheesecake I recommend this one! Many times when there is a party at our home my guests always request this dessert!!

Guests LOVE this recipe. I made this without the crust, works fine. Try a combination of berries (I used blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, raspberries). I actually get better results with the lower fat cream cheese, tastes creamier and a bit lighter.

I made the recipe just as it was -- no changes, additions or substitutions, even though I'd read earlier reviews suggesting changes. My guests loved it and there were NO leftovers. It was worth the expense to use fresh raspberries out of season, easy to make looked, as well as tasted, divine.

I made this cheesecake and submitted in a Chili/chocolate cookoff. It won the raves of almost everyone that ate it. Not just good they said but EXCELLENT. I would definately make it again. I read previous reviews and added six ounces white chocolate (actually called white confection). The cake was moist, light and a real hit. It is well worth the time and effort to make it.

I've pnly ever made it for company, and they declare it to be the best cheesecake they've ever eaten. I added an extra two ounces of white chocolate once, by mistake, and it was delicious. People seem to prefer the graham cracker crust, and I've left out the berries altogether with no ill effects.

This is a fabulous dessert, one that your guests won't be able to stop raving over. I use about 27 cookies(instead of 18) to adquately cover a 9-inch springform; another tip for the winter months when good fresh berries are scarce is to toss some fresh-frozen raspberries in with the preserves and reduce till slightly thickened, then top the cake with the mixture - I've got one in the oven as I type!!

I admit not following directions. Substituted strawberries for raspberries. Also was concerned about the weight of the cake so I separated the eggs and folded the stiffly beaten whites in last to lighten the batter. The crust needed more cookie crumbs, but maybe the cookies were smaller than others I've used. This goes into my favorites file.

The almond crust was too overpowering for the delicate cake. I would make this again, but with about 1/3 of the almonds and more cookie crumbs. My guests loved the cheesecake, but did not eat more than the first fork full of the crust. The raspberries in the cake were delish!
