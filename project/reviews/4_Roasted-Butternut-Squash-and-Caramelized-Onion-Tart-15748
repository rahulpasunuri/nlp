This was good but not worth the amount of effort. It was too bland for our taste...needs more of a kick. Maybe more spices, or more goat cheese or ???

Delicious. I've been making this for a few years now and it's always a big hit. The pasty dough is my go-to recipe for sweet or savory. I like to caramelize the onions to the point of being just a little bit crispy (but never burnt!). Fresh rosemary and thyme are great. Tip: Roast a larger squash ahead of time and freeze in 2-cup portions to save time.

Didn't add the goat cheese, increased the carmelized onion 3x. A nice delicate flavor.

I've not made this but I tasted it at a potluck dinner last weekend. The cook put in 6 strips of bacon and some extra onion. It was absolutely delicous and will be added to our Thanksgiving menu this year!

Just a warning - this is a heavy dish, but a fantastic vegetarian main course. My hubby loves this, even though I usually make a lightened version. I use phyllo instead of pastry, almond or regular milk, standard grocery store cheeses of the 2% variety - it's very adaptable and makes great leftovers. Oh and I generally sub panko for breadcrumbs, but thats a personal preference.

YUM! Interesting new way to use squash. I doubled the onion, which I believe kept it from tasting like a pumpkin/squash pie and made it "umami" delicious. I kept to the measurements but used what was in my fridge: mozzarella, romano and goat cheese with herbs, also threw in 3 cooked pieces of bacon, at another user's suggestion, since I had on hand. Had fresh-frozen thyme and sage, which also added immensely! Used milk instead of cream, a frozen crust, and skipped the bread crumbs. A very forgiving recipe--add/take out whatever floats your boat!

Tasty! I used frozn puff pastry to save some time. Great combo of flavors, will definitely be a winter staple.

A first rate entrée! The carmelized onion gave it a wonderful quality, not to mention eye appeal. I didn't have Fontina, so I used a good quality Swiss cheese. I used dried marjoram and it was still great. Next time though, I will use fresh. Is now part of permanent collection.

Disclaimer: I significantly lightened the recipe, but it turned out really well. I used phyllo instead of pie crust & breadcrumbs, milk instead of cream, cream cheese instead of goat (that one was budgetary), and added spinach to up the veggies. The original is much more decadent, but even a light version is fantastic. I agree, don't eat it cold/make extra, not good.

Rating: 4
This is truly a wonderful recipe. I added in chopped up crispy bacon, and used the bacon fat to cook the onions, which added another layer of flavor and made the tart perfectly appealing to my meat-eating boyfriend and brother (who both normally eschew squash-related meals). Of course, it isn't necessary as the tart is delicious as it is, but I think it added a nice flavor note. Highly, highly recommend this tart, which reminds me of French quiche I had while spending a year there.

So good. I usually just mash the squash by hand and save the step of washing the food processor. A suggestion: buy a slightly larger squash and a large onion. Then use leftover puree, caramelized onions and goat cheese the next day to make gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches.

Definitely not healthy for you, but pretty tasty! When eaten cold it felt a little brick-ish, but when straight out of the oven it was good. Maybe I will make it again.

I forgot to include in my review below: I used frozen squash, which was a brilliant time saver, (I still roasted it). I noticed nothing special about the use of the Fontina Cheese, and would definitely substitute with a smoked gruyere next time.

This was delicious, but fell short of exceptional. Most of it can be made a day ahead, which is great. I used the caramelized onion recipe from Rebar, and did incorporate the onions into the tart - I felt this would be less fussy, as I was taking the dish to a pot-luck, but will be sure to chop onions, rather than slice, if I do this again (sliced onions were stringy in the tart).

I could not find Italian Fontina at the store, so I used Manchego. Also, I substituted light cream for heavy cream and I used more onions than the recipe called for, and cooked them until they were nice and caramelized. Really delicious and a huge hit at my bookclub's brunch.

This was wonderful, as others have already expressed. While there were a lot of steps, the recipe wasn't difficult. I would not, however, recommend this for Thanksgiving. It is too involved and too much for one recipe when you're trying to pull a whole dinner together. It would be great for brunch, with a salad.

Excellent. I thought I had all the cheeses until I started, but ended up subbing manchego, and used extra parm. Turned out great. I think you could use any cheeses, really. Used a store bought crust to speed things up and it worked fine.

Great fall tart served with a pumpkin ale. I used my grandmother's pie crust recipe instead, using flour and shortening and a 9 inch pie dish. The crust was perfect and the consistency of the filling was ambrosial!

This was okay, but that's about it. Overall it was far more eggy than I hoped for. I really just love butternut squash and chevre with caramelized onions...and I guess I should have just done something with those three ingredients. This was salty, eggy, and not squashy at all. Bummer.

Rating: 4
I can't wait for butternut squash to be in season so I can make this tart every year. It is absolutely fantastic, and a total no-brainer. I use store bought crust, which does seem to affect the taste, but this year I will try a homemade crust, or possibly Trader Joe's crust, which I've heard good things about.

Rating: 4
Spectacular! I use a large squash and double the rest of the ingredients to make two tarts. I prick the squash all over with a fork before roasting it whole; it's far easier to cut and seed a cooked squash. I cheat and use a purchased frozen pastry crust, which doesn't seem to hurt the quality. I've been asked for the recipe everywhere I've taken it, and my 18-month-olds always ask for seconds and third servings. This is now my potluck standard.

Rating: 0
This was not a success and I'm still scratching my head to figure out why. Followed the ingredients except the squash I used was on the big side and the handcrafted Vermont goat cheese was soft and therefore did not crumble. The result, a really squashy, pumpkiny pie textured filling with little globs of white unmelted cheese. not good.

Rating: 4
Very rich, so a small slice along with a salad, soup &/or some protein would make a great meal. I didn't change amounts of ingredients, and there is no need to. 1 onion is enough as long as you slice the onion v.thinly, carmelize, & then distribute it well. I added cheese by weight instead of measure-- don't know if mattered, but it was plenty. Used fresh rosemary, sage, thyme, parsley. I like to roast the butternut squash whole, just prick it a few times, set it on a piece of foil, roast until v.soft. After it cools, cut in half, remove seeds and peel the flesh away from the skin; this could be done a few days ahead, kept in fridge. For the crumb topping, I melted the butter in the micro then stirred it into panko (japanese bread crumbs). 9.5 in tart pan worked well (the only size I had).

Made 5 different quiches from this site for a ladies lunch and this was the most popular with a few suggesting they would make the filling as a Christmas side dish. Prepared the squash and onions the day before so it came together quickly.

fantastic dish...i don't enjoy fontina by itself but it tastes great in the tart. i used 1/2 a cheddar cheese pie crust recipe from an old cooking light apple pie recipe for the crust. i think this may even taste better when it is heated up the next day. well worth the four forks.

Fun to make. Like most others I will use a large onion when I make it again.

A great fall dish. Only made 1 change to the recipe. Added fresh sprigs of thyme and rosemary while sauteing the onions to give them added flavor. Removed before adding to the squash. I saved some onions to sprinkle on top --skipped the breadcrumbs--and garnished with more fresh herbs. A definite keeper recipe.

Rating: 3
This was very good, but not quite as awe-inspiring as the reviews led me to believe. The squash was completely overpowered by the cheese (admittedly, I used 2x what the recipe called for based on other people's reviews). Or perhaps my problem was the cheese itself, the fontina, which I had never tasted until this dish came along. Fontina is definitely not one of my favorite cheeses, and I probably would have enjoyed this with more of the goat gouda). Next time, I will substitute something else for the fontina, use maybe 30% more of the other cheeses, and use 5 small onions instead of 4.

Thanks to all the previous reviewers, I made this fantastic tart with confidence for my guests last night. Everyone raved. I added extra onions (put some on top as previously suggested) and extra fresh herbs. I didn't have any goat cheese, but increased the fontina to 1 cup and added more parmesan too. I forogt to add salt and pepper, so sprinkled on top with my bread crumbs. Also, I did not have an 11" tart pan; baked mine in a 9" tart pan and put extra filling in individual ramekins and froze for side dish later. The 9" tart was fine for small appetizer wedges that fed my group of 8 prior to serving dinner. It is rich so small is fine. This is a keeper. I will try again using acorn and maybe adding maple syrup to the filling for a "sweeter" variety. Delicious!

WOW, this is amazing! My guests are still talking about it. Followed exact recipe except used a cheddar cheese crust which was prebaked to give it a crispness.

Wow! Wow! Wow! This was heavenly.I actually practiced this tart before serving it to company as I was uncertain as to how the squash would balance with the cheese and onions. First time out, I doubled the cheese, onions and herbs. It was delicious, but the strong cheese flavor overtook the squash. The second try was much better because I bought a larger squash and cut back just a little on the cheese. I also used a fine grater for thecheese and it proved to be much more subtle. The squash was more prominent, but not overpowering, and even the people who were not fond of squash gobbled it up and asked for more. The larger squash produced extra filling, so I made tartlettes which I have frozen and served succesfully in weeks following. I used Pierre Hermes tart dough recipe. Amazing! Not to be missed!

The best new recipe I've tried for winter squash. I used milk instead of cream and substituted feta for all of the cheeses. The salty chunks of feta were great with the sweet squash.

I can't rave enough on this recipe--I have given it to 3 people already! Following the guidance of those who had gone before, I doubled the onions and cheeses, and then herbs as well. I used a ready-to-bake crust in my Pyrex plate and with the pre-freezing, it tasted homemade. I also made a double batch to make 2 tarts at once which worked well. It was easy to bake the crust and squash the night before and with the onions pre-sliced as well, I found assembly to be a snap the next morning.

**Excellent.** Increased onions and used a mix of squashes. Was too wimpy to make crust from scratch, so I balled up some premade crust and rolled it out--but too thick!! Ended up with a tart pan that was half crust. Oh, well. Everyone loved it. I served with a ham and green salad for Sunday brunch. Not sure about reviewers who complained of its richness--thought it was perfect as directed (perhaps with a hair more cheese).

I've made this tart twice in a month -- the first using a homemade crust, the second using a store-bought pie crust. I definitely upped the amount of onion -- it adds a lot to the flavor -- and probably upped the cheese a bit, but overall it turned out excellent. I've had requests for the recipe, too.

Followed the advice of several reviewers (many thanks)...used pie crust, milk, double the onion, double the cheese, double the spices. It was delish! My personal tase: I'd cut back to the recommended amount of cheese and add even more spices. Preparation was not quite quick enough for a weeknight meal, but it was excellent leftover.

Tasty, but I would make it again as a gratin, same recipe but without the crust, turning it into a side dish to Thanksgiving turkey or roasted meat. Would save some calories, and I thought a puree was kind of odd as a tart filling here -- I would have preferred chunks of squash. But a nice side dish, and next time I will double the amount of onions, bread crumbs, herbs. Used milk instead of cream without a problem.

I think I am in the minority here in that I didn't think this was all that great. I expected greatness from the reviews and because I have had awesome meals at the Dahlia Lounge, but it was just so-so. However, I would make it again with some changes. The crust recipe, as written, is too brittle, it needs some Crisco for flakiness, I would also try with no crust. It needs more onions and more squash and more herbs. I would also try it with milk instead of cream. Still, if you are a fan of these flavors, try making it as written and see what you think.

I agree with previous reviewers that the crust is not necessary--the flavors in this could hold their own as a casserole. I also think milk could be used instead of cream without a loss. Delicious!

All and all this was a great dish. What I'd do differently next time is cut down on the cheeses, especially the fontina, as I think the pungency of it turned off a few of my Thanksgiving dinner guests. But if you love fontina, go for it! I'd probably also try going with milk instead of cream, because it's so rich as it is. Also, I'd give it more time to sit before serving... i think it would be a bit better at room temperature. For those of you considering it, definitely give it a try!

i made this twice. the first time i followed the recipe and found it too rich. so, i cut out the fontina and added more squash. it was much better. i also pureed the onions and cheese with the squash so it has a smoother texture.

This recipe has become a family favorite for special occasions like Christmas and Thanksgiving. As vegetarians, it's perfect. We've found that the weight of the squash is actually critical to getting the right consistency for the mixture. If the squash is heavier, cut it and use only the portion required. It doesn't fill the crust completely, but the resulting mixture will have a beautiful texture.

Great recipe. Needs at least two onions instead of just one. I used a frozen pie crust and it worked great. Also, I used whole milk rather than heavy cream b/c of health reasons, and it also didn't make a difference.

An awesome Fall dish. I'm sure it will be a family favorite for years to come. I too added more onions and played with the cheeses. Also - I doubt you will find a 1 pound butternut squash - I used a 2 1/2 (smallest I could find) - glad I did as it filled the crust just right including the extra onions and cheese.

this could very well be my absolute favorite recipe on Epicurious. I've made several variations with different amounts of cheese and different herbs, and it always gets rave reviews from everyone who tries it. The one change I am quite consistent about is using 4-5 onions instead of 1, of course cooking them WAY down, probably longer than 20 nminutes.

I've made this recipe with a few adjustments about 3X and always get compliments. It's tasty but very rich - a great way to serve squash and a terrific addition to any holiday meal. I've never made the crust - I do it as a casserole. I don't use oil for the squash - just put 1/4" of water in the pan and roast the squash. As far as onions, I use a about 3X what the recipe calls for, 3X the goat cheese as I like it tart, 2X the fontina cheese and 2X the parmesan. I bake in the oven as the recipe suggests and then reheat via the oven after the turkey is out or in the microwave as required. It's a terrific holiday dish for this reason. It can be made ahead and reheated via oven or microwave. It's rich but very very yummy!!! I cook a lot and I LOVE this recipe. Would recommend at most 1 other starch as part of the holiday meal or maybe none, but for sure 1 or 2 lighter veggies like green beans,brussel sprouts, broccoli or carrots as part of the holiday meal. I'm sure you'll enjoy!!!

The perfect autumn recipe! But I need some help in figuring out how far in advance I can prepare this or if anyone has tried freezing it...I would love to take it to Christmas dinner but I will have almost no time to for preparations that day,and the day before is iffy too.

I had been anticipating making this recipe, which I planned to bring over to the folks house for Thanksgiving. It is a bit involved, but, my daughters were involved and helpful. As the dish was finishing baking, and I was just combing my hair before we left, I asked my husband to take it out of the oven (with a pizza paddle, I find is easiest with tartsbecause of the removeable bottom. Well, something happened, I was upstairs and heard a very loud expletive. I shrieked in horror. As I raced down the stairs, I saw and gasped as my husband was cleaning up the splattered (upside down no less) squash tart from the floor. At least I had a taste of the filling before the bake. It was delicious. I am dreaming of another date with this squash tart recipe. I still believe a pizza paddle works best. I will just carefully finish the last step (removal from the oven) myself, thank you. I didn't stay mad. It was an accident. But, he missed something, even though squash isn't his favorite veggie.

I thought this was wonderful. My family doesn't like goat cheese so I just left it out and added a bit more fontina. I made if for Thanksgiving this year and there were no leftovers! I had to make it again for Saturday's lunch. I used frozen pie crust and it was fine.

This was undoubtably the smash hit of the entire dinner party! This recipe is a perfect mixture of flavours-and the pastry is VERY tender!

I loved this! The version I made was very different; First, instead of a tart dough, I used a pre-made cornmeal pizza crust made by viccolo in San Francisco ("Webvan" carries it). Even though its a pizza crust, it has a tart-crust quality to it. Relative to the filling, I simply layered into the pizza/tart crust the following: Carmelized onions, sliced butternut squash that was first roasted, and crumbled goat cheese over the top. Very simple and very delicious...makes a great dinner servied with salad.

Dynamite flavors - good roast onions are essential, I did them in the oven at 400 til some were dark brown, not just gold.
