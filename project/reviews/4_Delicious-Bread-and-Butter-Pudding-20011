Wonderful! I knew when it was a James Beard receipe with great ratings I was on to something, but was unprepared for the yum factor. I soaked the raisins in a vanilla cognac (navan) and used challah bread. So easy! Rave reviews from our guests last night.

I made this for a meeting for 8 people and people raved. It was so warm, comforting, sweet-but-not-too- sweet, just right for a January night in Minnesota. I used cognac to soak the raisins and I threw in a few dried cherries; I used challah bread, which was really wonderful, and i left the crusts in tact; I cut the bread into chunks, which was nice; I sprinkled a tablespoon or two of cinnamon and sugar over the top before baking; I added a couple tablespoons of cognac into the batter; I served with cognac whip cream. A real winning recipe.

I soaked raisins in Amaretto and then added some of the liquid to the egg mixture before straining it. Everyone loved it and requested I make it again. I used French bread that was made earlier that day. I also melted the butter first then dipped each piece in to cover well.

Pass the Lipitor... But this was to die for! Just make sure you use a souffle dish (what the heck is a "pudding dish"?) because it will rise and bubble over a regular, 2 inch deep baking dish. Served with slightly sweetened whipped cream, it was a hit at my dinner party. Even those who "don't do dessert" could not resist.

Found this recipe really easy and pretty good - I used a bread that seemed a bit too salty for the recipe though. Next time will try with an egg bread.

I make this dessert every six months or so, usually for holidays. One time, I had only a pint of 1/2 and 1/2 and it came out dense, rich and yummy. Both ways it is great!

Fabulous dessert. Had this on my dessert buffet table for a party and it became the topic of conversation. I went further than serving it with cream and made a vanilla custard sauce as a topping. This dish took center stage.

I looked at a couple of these recipes before deciding on this one. And I'm sooooooo glad I did :-) I used panettone instead of the bread and soaked the fruit in Muscat overnight. Decadence!! I have been hounded by my friends ever since to make it again. But they will have to wait for Christmas :-) Excellent!!!!!!

Classic,simple, traditional bread pudding. My two-year-old and I made it for Daddy while I took a phone call. Subistituted Wonder Bread, no raisins, doubled the sugar and used 2% milk. It reminded us so much of baked french toast that we had it as a decadent Saturday morning breakfast with a tiny drop of syrup and warm milk.

It's a good thing I only made a half-recipe, or I'd have eaten the whole thing! Delicious. I liked the amount of sugar in the recipe - just sweet enough. Substituted dried cranberries, soaked in peach brandy and sherry. Also added the soaking liquid to the milk mixture, as someone else suggested.

I finally tried this, after reading the recipe many times. What a great dessert! And easy, too. I didn't have cognac, so soaked the raisins in some amaretto, which I then added to the custard. Based on other reviews, I upped the sugar to 2/3 cup, and the result was sublime. My "I don't really like dessert" husband ate large servings. This will definitely reappear at our house.

Great and easy! Next time I will double the sugar. The family loved it!

I was almost out of raisins, so I added chunks of apple. No brandy, so they got soaked in peach schnapps. Then I mis-set the microwave, so the butter melted - to which I added a little more peach schnapps and brushed it on to both sides of the bread - and added the liqueur in which the fruit had soaked to the cream. Too bad I can't give this 5 forks - it was the best I've ever had! Next time I'm trying it with grand marnier!

This is absolutely the moistest, sinfully delicious bread pudding I have ever eaten. This is worth breaking your diet for! Bread pudding lovers should try this one!
