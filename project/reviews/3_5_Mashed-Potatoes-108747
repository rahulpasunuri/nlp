Easy, simple, good old fashioned mashed potatoes -- just like granny used to make!

I added roasted garlic and substituted heavy cream for half of the milk; it was delicious!

This is a good basic recipe. Yukon Gold potatoes make all the difference!

My 14 year old daughter makes these potatoes for the holidays, so they must be easy and they taste great. We added heavy whipped cream to maximize the fluffiness. I know it's unhealthy, but hey, it's once a year why not enjoy?

Good, but I added Maile dijon mustard instead of some of the liquid ingredients, (just enough for the potatoes to start to change color). I experimented further until I was just adding about 2T of that brand of mustard, and the butter. Other brands didn't work as well, and the other ingredients took away from the taste. The flavor of the potatoes wasn't mustard, but was deep and complex... received rave reviews!

This is a very traditional mashed potato recipe. I added a few roasted garlic cloves and chives to jazz it up. It was good.. just nothing special.

OK, add some sour cream, parsley, whatever! In fact, skip the milk! Who needs it? Load it up with sour cream, and butter. Enough said.

Expected rich flavor from the this recipe but it fell flat. I've used many fantastic recipes from epicurious.com and this is the first one that won't be making a repeat performance. I'll give the mashed potatoes with EVOO a spin next time we're craving the spuds.

Added the roasted garlic, which was very mild, but gave the potatoes a fuller flavor...could there be a more indulgent comfort food? The bowl was scrapped clean.

I have made these potatoes a couple of times and as a novice they are a quick and easy dish. They compliment any roast or chicken dish and reheat well for leftovers.

this was my first time ever trying a new recipe other than my mothers mashed potatoes and they came out AWESOME. I used 1% milk instead of whole and 5lbs of potatoes intstead of 4lbs. I also added 1/2 tsp. of thyme for flavor....mixed with an electric mixer and they were delicious. light, fluffy and flavorful, just how i love them. I found my new favorite recipe for sure.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, and it was a big hit. I used 7 potatoes instead of 4 as I like my mashed potatos lumpy, and the amount of liquid suggested would have made the potatos too loose. On the minus side, this recipe is quite unhealthy. I think good mashed potatos can be made with skim milk and the type of margarine that aids one cholesterol. This would cut down on its unhealthy aspects.

Unfortunately this came out very bland. I added fresh snipped chives for color and it still didn't have enough gusto. I would suggest adding sour cream and perhaps boiling the potatoes in chicken stock instead of water.

I am a mash potato lover and until I tried this recipe I would not eat any other mashed potatoes than the ones my mother would make. Now I don't have to go home to get some good mashed potatoes! Thank you epicurious!

Piece of cake to make. Variation: try adding a couple of turnips and several cloves of garlic to the potatoes before boiling (I did this one night when I had more guests than I had planned for). I also added thyme to the milk before heating.

This was easy to make and simply delicious. I addes mozarella cheese to the mix and my family loved it!
