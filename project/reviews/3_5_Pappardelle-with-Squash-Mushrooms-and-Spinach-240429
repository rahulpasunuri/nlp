Hints for butternut squash: if you microwave it for 3-4 minutes, it is easy to peel and slice. For faster sauteeing (I had no problem with its not cooking), try cutting into matchsticke-- should cut it down to 4 or 5 minutes. This is a fabulous recipe! I agree with the reviewer who added a couple of garlic cloves, sliced or minced.

I've made this a couple times and its really delicious! I usually roast the squash cubes (takes about 20-25 min at 400) and use only 2 Tbsp of butter. I use veggie broth to keep it most, as needed. Also, I toss in a couple cloves of minced garlic as butter, cheese and spinach are lost without it. Bon apetit!

Made it exactly as written, turned out beautifully. Only thing I changed was to roast the squash seeds with oil and salt and then toss them on top for a little crunch. Yummy!

If you're not familiar with preparing butternut squash, you should go with frozen or pre-diced squash. They are very dense (thus full of fiber), and require a pretty strong person to cut. Watch a video on how to prepare butternut squash first. Once you get past that part, this recipe is delicious!!! Even if the squash overcooks and gets mushy, it sticks to the pasta and makes it even easier to get as much squash as possible.

First things first: there is nothing "quick" about this "quick & easy" recipe. i echo another reviewer in saying that the butternut squash takes far more than 8 minutes. i only used 2 TBSP of butter and olive oil for the rest, and while the squash etc was simmering, i stirred in a bit of chicken brother to keep the veggies moist. lastly, it needed a fair amount of salt (and now, we are not big salty food eaters) but we did feel that even with the parmesan, salt was a bit low. overall, not a bad recipe, but needs a fair bit of tweaking.

These classic flavors turned out beautifully -- the sage, squash & parm cheese are just so delightful together, and the butter makes it truly sing. I used only about 2 Tbs of butter, instead of a whole stick (which just seemed excessive)and let the squash cook covered after other reviewers said it took longer to cook. My only suggestion would be some toasted chopped nuts as a final flourish to make it absolutely perfect (hazelnuts, or walnuts, or pine nuts).

i was dubious when i saw this recipe was supposed to take 25 minutes - it's butternut squash. and i was right. 45 minutes later, after adding probably 1.5 c of liquid to basically braise the squash so it was soft enough to eat, i was able to go on and add the spinach, etc. i was close to throwing the whole mess away but i was hungry, so i finished it off and added the cheese. the cheese transformed it! the bottom line: you're planning to go healthy and skip most of the butter and cheese, find a different recipe. it ended up being delicious, but not the quick and healthy dinner i imagined. i probably won't make it again.

We enjoyed this dish, but I think next time I will make it without the squash (I have never cooked squash before and I think I might have overcooked it). I used way less butter that the recipe called for, and found this dish still quite rich and creamy. I like the idea of adding pine nuts. I think I will also use truffle salt to finish it next time.

I would make this again, but I did find it rich, so maybe a little less butter. But overall, it was a great dish.

I had low expectation for this recipe from the ingredient list. A chef at L'academie de Cuisine in Maryland had us make it in a class exactly as written. Wonderful! I love bold flavors (don't we all), but the subtlety of the butter and sage let the squash really sing. That said, I'll probably add shallots, chicken broth and white wine next time. Garlic and onions might be too strong. Made with fresh, handmade pappardelle.

With a few additions, this is a great, autumnal recipe. Start off by sauteing half an onion and two cloves of garlic in 1 T of olive oil and 1 T of butter. Then only add another 3-4 T of butter when you add in the squash. Follow the rest of the recipe as is. I used dried mushrooms instead of fresh and then used the mushroom poaching liquid instead of the pasta water to moisten the dish. Also used dried sage instead of fresh b/c that's all I had. In the end, it was delicious!

Was craving a squash and pasta combo and this fit the bill. I subbed fresh oregano for fresh sage which was good, but I suspect the sage would have given the dish a little more depth. Also added pine nuts (per others suggestions) and sauteed squash in lots of garlic and some white wine. Used portebello mushrooms (what I had in the kitchen). It was a very satisfying autumn meal. Will certainly make again - with sage!!

Yum-o! Have done this as is with wonderful results. Tonight I used leftover squash, a mixture of mushrooms, and topped with sauteed turkey breast. Hubby said it was "de-lish".

I love this recipe, but not everybody does. The only change I make is that I use a whole pound of fettucine and a whole squash (because you usually get more than 3 cups from 1) and extra spinach--I have also addeed beet greens or chard if I had extra. Yum...

The second time I made this recipe I included BACON! I fried the bacon, took it out, then cooked the veggies in the bacon grease....delicious. Fugetabout the butta!

Squash takes quite a while to cook, and is helped by adding some chicken broth partway in. As suggested, I also included olive oil, toasted pine nuts, and nutmeg. Used yummy chanterelle mushrooms.

Quick and easy to make. I used 2 T of butter and 2 T olive oil instead of all butter, and I added about 1/4 cup of dry white wine instead of more butter with the muchrooms and sage. I also added a pinch of Kosher salt when I was cooking the squash. Delicious!

This one is just OK. I tried adding some roasted garlic but it just didn't cut it.I replaced the butter with olive oil and added the sage at the very end so it didn't lose all of its flavour in the hot pan. If you like sweet in your main courses, you will probably like this. I prefer savoury so I believe it wasn't the recipie, it was personal preference.

I added a little freshly grated nutmeg, which seemd to provide the flavor lift that others were looking for in this dish. Nutmeg pairs wonderfully with both squash and spinach. A big hit served alongside medallions of pork tenderloin, but definitely would hold up equally as well as a main course. Perfect for an autumn evening.

I made it exactly as written. I thought it was wonderful, although I intially worried that it wouldn't have enough flavor with just sage as the seasoning. It was fine. The only addition that I've read in the other reviews that I might try is toasted pine nuts. Otherwise, I don't think it needs to be tampered with.

My family and friends really enjoyed this dish. Something about the mixture of the flavours really worked for them - I didn't use pappardelle or fettuccine pasta though, I used a spinach/ricotta ravioli, which was a bonus because of the continuity in use of ingredients.

I love the foundation of this but I skipped the greens and used whole-wheat pasta - more flavorful. I soak dried shitake's and use the water to make a chicken bouillon. FAB! Toss it all together in the end.

Delicious and so easy! I made the following substitutions because these ingredients are what I had: a mix of baby squash instead of butternut, button instead of shiitake mushrooms, kale instead of spinach, and dried sage instead of fresh. I loved it--though would like to use fresh sage next time if I have it.

I really liked this- it was delicious and easy to make for a quick dinner party!

I read the reviews before making this, so I added onions, lots of s&p, and cut the butter with broth, and added pine nuts. i think next time i will try without onions, which may actually take away from the sweetness of the squash. i loved the flavors in this and will definately make this again!

My husband loved this, I didn't. I think it comes down to whether you really like squash as the flavor is rather strong.

Duh, I just read the other reviews and realized what this recipe needs: aromatics! It has no onions, garlic, celery, etc. Even then, the flavor will still need to be upped somehow.

I prepared it to the tee and it was boring at best. The flavor needed more brightening -- but with what? Lemon juice? Balsamic vinegar? Just more salt? Not sure.

Great dish - a really great simple fall dish for a weeknight meal. I sauted some shallots with the squash, and added some toasted pumpkin seeds as a garnish for some added crunch.

Absolutely delicious! And comes together quickly, too. Served it over whole-wheat linguine with extra grated Parmiggiano-Reggiano cheese on top...yum!

My mother made this for my sister and me - we both loved it. It was a restaurant quality meal. She made it exactly as written. I will make it soon and try it replacing some of the butter with stock.

A fantastic easy meal packed with veggies. I made a few changes: Added a diced onion and a little crushed red pepper when sauteeing the spinach; also used baby bellas instead of shitake. Next time, I might use veggie stock instead of pasta water to add more flavor. A repeater!

This was a really delicious weeknight dinner packed with veggies. I made a few alterations by adding one diced onion and a little crushed red pepper when sauteeing the squash. Might try using vegetable stock instead of pasta water the next time to add more flavor and maybe cut down on the butter.

I really enjoyed this. A simple dish, but is fancy enough to serve with a nice dinner. I used farfalle because it was all I had on hand.

This just wasn't that flavorful. I followed the recipe exactly and added quite a bit of sea salt at the end. My daughter took two bites and pushed her plate away. Probably I should use fettuccini next time (if I make it) and a few things to bump up the flavor, like onions and garlic.

I thought this was excellent, and SO easy to make! I used fettuccini instead of the pappardelle, and I sauted some onions with the butternut squash. Also used baby portabellas instead of the shiitakes because I had them on hand. Very autumnal - a great weekday meal!

Very good - good enough to serve to guests. I'm planning to make this again soon using homemade pasta instead next time.
