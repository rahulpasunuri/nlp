This is the second year we've made this for Xmas eve. We use fresh dungeness crab which is just wonderful. This year we thought the sherry flavor was a bit strong, perhaps because we served it in pastry shells. Last year, over basmati rice, it was perfect. So depending on how we serve it next year, we might adjust the amount of sherry a bit.

Why do so many recipes include nutmeg with crab? I hides the delicate flavor of fresh crab. Otherwise a good recipe.

this was very tasty. i used a premium canned crab and mixed in some chopped shrimp and added extra parmesan, otherwise i followed the recipe exactly. rich, creamy, satisfying. i served this as one of many appetizers for a valentines tapas dinner. will make again!

I think it is absolutely wonderful. However I made some changes. Instead of fresh crab, I used the crab imitation, it was creamy and still had that taste of crab, and instead of sherry I used cooking wine. It was nice but didn't have that strong flavor of sherry. Oh and milk, I just added enough for the mixture not to be think. Other then that I simply love it. I will definitely do it again, actually I'll serve it for my husbands step-fathers b-day party on Saturday!

I thought this was divine. I didn't know how much milk to add so I started with 1/2 cup of milk and then thought it could use a little more; I used about 3/4 cup whole milk total. I thought the sherry taste was good but quite strong; I might cut back to 1/4 cup of sherry. Mine took 10 minutes (not 5) to bake, probably because I made 4 6-oz servings, rather than 6 4-oz servings. I used Chicken of the Sea canned lump crab meat.

This is heavenly. My husband loves to go crabbing and brings home lots of dungeness and red crab - It substitutes just fine for the king crab legs.

Absolutely wonderful. I have this in "My Book".

This was good. The sauce was very tasty, but I agree with the fact that it may be a little overpowering for the delicate taste of the king crab meat. Next time I will probably use a less expensive type of meat like crab or shrimp.

This was very good and very rich. A nice change from our usual melted butter, but it was time-consuming to make, so I'd only do it for special occasions.

I used the Jumbo Lump Crabmeat and instead of bread crumbs and Parmigiano substituted Panko and Sharp Cheddar Cheese. It served 4.

I didn't love it. Very rich and the delicate crabmeat flavor was somewhat obscured. Wish I had just warmed the meat in butter with maybe a splash of sherry, and served on toast points.

I used fresh San Francisco crab and did everything else re: the recipe. We thought it was great, very savory and easy to prepare ahead. The servings were a little small though we all agreed we generally eat too much anyway!

I used jumbo lump crab meat. This was a very good use of crab meat, which can be expensive and most recipes try to stretch it out using fillers - blech! The only breadcrumbs in this recipe are in the topping. I thought the sherry flavor could have been a little stronger, and will add more spices next time (probably a little Old Bay). Will definitely make this again - very nice presentation.
