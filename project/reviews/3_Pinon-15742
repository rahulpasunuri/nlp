OK, you purists out there may scream but here it goes: I've been asked to bring a vegetarian dish for Thanksgiving and I'm thinking of making a pinon, however, I plan to substitute the beef red sauce with a bechamel and crab meat. A chef friend suggested that I add some red sauce on top b/c it will need some acid. I think that's overkill. Thoughts?

I do not use the raisins or parmesan. What is traditional is to add a can of green beans. I make THIS version of pinon quite frequently.

This was my first time trying to make Pinon myself. It truely brought back many childhood memories of vacations at abuela's house in PR. I had my dad try it the day after and he melted! Thanks. I do suggest that a clove or two of crushed garlic and some oregano be added to the filling and the parmasian be omitted entirely though. If you have the privelage of having Quezo de Oja with some guava paste, that would make for a great desert!

this is probably my favorite dish from childhood, and i've made--and experimented with--this recipe several times. it's fine as is, but my mom always added a can or two of french-cut green beans, and i do as well. i don't care for olives, so i use capers instead. i've made a veggie version of this using ground beef-style gimme lean! meat substitute, and it holds up. oh, a tip from my mom: you can also microwave the plantain strips: 4 minutes per plantain. it really saves on time and mess. always a fine dish.

Different yet very good. Next time I will cook the sauce less so the dish won't be as dry. Bought the achiote but don't think it made much of a difference.

The recipe is great, but it is very rich. If I would make it again next time I would use less plantains and leave it in the oven a little bit less longer than the recipe call for. The combination of the recipe is great.

My husband and I enjoyed this but felt it was generally lacking in spice. I added extra olives, chili powder and a smidgen of chipolte peppers for more heat.

This is a typical Puerto Rican dish I grew up with. I used to think it was an acquired taste until I dare serve it as appetizers at my very large rehearsal dinner party in Washington DC with people from all over the US and it was a hit! This recipe freezes very well and if you don't mind it being a little drier, instead of frying the plantains you can spray them with Pam or olive oil and cook them in the oven. That way, they won't be as fatty. There is another nifty way to serve this, instead of making this as a pie, slice the ripe plantains lenghtwise into long slices. Fry or bake them. Put the meat filling (taking out the sauce) lenghtwise and roll. Dip the rolls in an egg and parmesan cheese mixture and sautee in olive oil or butter. They are great, look fabulous and although a little fuzzy to make, will be a hit.

Very good flavor. If your guests do no like plantains, substitute sliced, boiled potatoes. This dish is a bit time consuming, but felt it had a really good result.
