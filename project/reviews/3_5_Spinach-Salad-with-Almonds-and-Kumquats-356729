I'm new to kumquats and absolutely loved this salad. I used the mushrooms and thought they added good texture and flavor. Will be making this again!

I have no idea how much spinach in a 5-oz package. I will guess and hope for the best.

Delicious & healthy. The citrus flavors were especially nice in midwinter.

I used mandarin oranges instead of kumquats and the salad was great.

Super easy way to use the last of the kumquats. I thought the mushrooms added a lot too.

WONDERFUL! Served with Roast Pork Loin and Potatoes, Butternut Squash and Rutabaga Purée and Sweet-and-Sour Red Cabbage and Fennel. Our guests went back for seconds ... and thirds!
