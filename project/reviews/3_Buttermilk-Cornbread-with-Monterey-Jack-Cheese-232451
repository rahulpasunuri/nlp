This recipe is fine, but nothing special.

One other note - we also spice it up with Pepper jack cheese, and add extra cheese!

My family LOVES this cornbread! To add moisture and texture, I mix in a bag of frozen corn just prior to putting it in the baking pan. I'd suggest organic sweet corn. We've also tried a frozen corn with bacon that everyone loved. We usually make it with chili or with ham, mac & cheese.

It was like a brick and VERY dry-would never make this again!

Excellent cornbread. Turned out moist and interesting. Won a prize for this bread at a chili festival!!!

Very good. I used (real) maple syrup instead of honey and thinned the batter at the end with a little extra buttermilk. Slightly sweet, but not too much.

I made this for dinner party and my guests gobbled it. The bread basket was passed several times. Personally, I like the the old standby Betty Crocker cornbread recipe better which uses regular milk instead of buttermilk. I do think the buttermilk gives the recipe a "truer" southern flavor and as stated, they are dense.
