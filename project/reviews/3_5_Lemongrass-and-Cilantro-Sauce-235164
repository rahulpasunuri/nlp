They are growing jalapenos so big these days that "two large" ones might be more than is required except by those "love to eat liquid fire" types. After chopping one of the large jalapenos I'd bought I thought that looked like enough. It really, really was. I made this two days ahead, and it really helped the flavours sort themselves out. I imagine this would be a good sauce on any fish and probably chicken, too.

I used 1 can of low fat coconut milk, 1 cut cilantro leaves, 1 TBSP rooster chili sauce ( I didnt' hv jalapenos), and 2 garlic cloves. Also, per other reviewers suggestions, I used 1 TBSP fish sauce, 1/2 lemon's juice, and the zest from 1 lemon. After pureeing, I sauteed with a bag of frozen mixed seafood from Trader Joe's, and also added frozen chopped spinach and some mushrooms. It was EXCELLENT!

Excellent. Added the sauce to both mahi-mahi and tossed it with bok choi and baked the whole thing. Very nice. I did add fish sauce, good tip.

We decided to make this for the platter of shellfish in spite of the reviews. Made according to directions except I "packed tightly" the cilntro in the measuring cup. We then added zest of 1 small lemon, juice of 1/2 of the small lemon (it was a juicy one), and then added 1-1/2 teaspoons of Thai fish sauce which gave the sauce a little more depth. We also made it one day ahead which allowed the cilantro, citrus & jalapeno to meld. Everyone loved it. This would be a great sauce with salmon or a firm white fish.

try adding fish sauce... it's a southeast asian condiment, very salty sorta like anchovies... toss in a couple of tablespoons for depth of flavor plus saltiness. add that and the curry paste plus the full recipe

Found this to be very bland. Also added lime juice and green curry paste, but still somehing missing for our taste buds. Used fresh ingredients so it was't that.

I used the ingredients as listed and family really liked it. I took advice of previous reviewer and added a sqeeze of fresh lime juice.

I made this recipe today and was somewhat underwhelmed. I didn't have fresh lemongrass or nor the jalapeno chilies, so I substituted jarred lemongrass and jalapeno sauce. Maybe the substitutions threw the recipe off balance, but it just lacked "oomph" to me. I used it as a dressing for a seared scallop salad; my husband remarked that it was too bland. A squeeze or two of fresh lime juice kicked up the flavor considerably. I would probably give this one more try with fresh lemongrass and jalapenos, just to see if it makes a difference.
