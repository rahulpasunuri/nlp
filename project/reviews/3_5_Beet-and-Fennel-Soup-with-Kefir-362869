This is a lovely, lovely soup. The color is exquisite, and the proportions of onion, fennel, and beet are perfect. I used water instead of chicken broth, to maintain the pure flavor of the vegetables. I didn't have kefir on hand, so I used plain nonfat yogurt, which created just the right texture and tang. I used baby beets and had no problem with them getting tender in the suggested 20 minutes of simmering. I think this will be my go-to recipe when our CSA presents us with fennel.

Tasty and smooth. I added a little too much fennel, or perhaps not enough beets, so the fennel taste was slightly overpowering for me. To temper the taste I added about a teaspoon of agave syrup and a teaspoon of chopped fresh thyme! I think the thyme complimented it perfectly! I followed others reviews and boiled my beets before hand so the taste was great and texture smooth.

Should have read the reviews before making this recipe! Used chioggia beets & they never really got tender even after over 30 minutes of simmering. The kefir curdled a bit even though it was brought to room temp. Used a hand blender & didn't care for the consistency.

When I make this next time, I'll roast the beets first, because they took forever, and the soup wasn't smooth. On that note, I will probably also bring the kefir to room temperature before adding, because mine curdled too. I was really suspicious about the lack of spices, but just a little bit of salt and pepper at the end was all I added. Boyfriend, of course, said it needed some meat, but other than that, only compliments on this recipe from us.

Just polished off this soup and it was scrumptious! I subbed gold beets for the red ones and my soup was a golden color. Kefir adds the right touch. This soup is light and healthy, perfect for lunch or supper. I will definitely be returning to this recipe, especially when I have guests coming.

This is a simple and tasty soup. I did spice it up a bit to balance the sweetness of the roasted beets I used.

Easy, tasty and nutritious - love this kind of recipe. Used leftover roasted beets, and I didn't have any kefir so I substituted Greek yogurt. Will use kefir next time - I kept wishing it was a little tangier. Back in the day, all yogurts had quite a tangy taste, but I can't find any like that anymore. I wonder if buttermilk would also work in this soup.

I thought this soup was very flavorful. I agree with some of the other reveiwer suggestion about more fennel and it did take a little more time to get the beets soft and tender. I used a food processor and left some cubes of beets and fennel for a heartier soup. Also, I make my own kefir and thought that it did curdle a little bit when added to the soup. It didn't affect the taste at all though.

Easy and delicious! Followed some of the other reviewer suggestions, and I also added a few sprigs of thyme and a clove of garlic to the broth. Before serving I added a bit of grated orange rind, which really perked up the flavor. Next time I'll float some toasts/croutons on top for an easy vegetarian winter dinner.

I made this for a fun and healthy Valentine's themed dinner with friends. The kefir added a really nice tang/touch, and some extra fennel per the other reviewers. Everyone loved the dish (even those pesky beet-naysayers). I think what elevates this dish from 3 stars to 4 is the brilliant color, and fun kefir "hearts" you can add on the top of the soup.

Was certainly tasty, but the effort didn't seem worth it. The beets will take about twice the time to cook (if you want a smooth soup) compared to what is listed in the recipe. I think I stick to my stand-by of roasted beets.

Delicious! I didn't add fennel seeds but would love more of a fennel presence in the soup. This was fast and easy and pleased someone who was suspicious about beets. This will be a monthly recipe around here!

Surprisingly delicious! Easy too! Made as written and even my 3 year old gave it the thumbs up. I didn't use a blender - used an immersion blender which left it a little chunky. The kefir did seem to curdle. Didn't affect the taste.

Delicious soup! Easy, but with good depth of flavor. I roasted my beets, and used Greek yogurt, which worked well. This was a great Valentine's dinner first course!

This soup is wonderful! I had to cook the beets much longer than 20 minutes, and I used 2 tsp fennel as suggested by others. I had no Kefir, so used plain yogurt instead. Delicious! I will be making this often.

I'm a big beet fan, so I loved the soup. Contrary to most on here I found that 2 cups of stock was too much, and made the soup too watery for my taste. Easily fixed next time, though!

if you do not change anything of the recipe the result is worth the preparation time. It is one of the best soups I ever had and one of the best ways to eat beets even for those who do not like them too much -like me.

Amazing color - exceptional texture - complex flavor - now has a permanent spot in my recipe collection. It was so easy to make and has an impressive presentation. Excellent cold too!

Delicious -- used mixture of golden and chioggia beets, since that's what I had on hand -- used 2 1/2 C diced; soup was golden pale color, but still had great flavor. Used more chicken broth and cooked longer than 20 minutes. Took advice of others and sweated onions & used more fennel seeds for greater flavor. Used greek yogurt in place of kefir. Will definitely make again.

Very good -- used mixture of golden beets and chioggia beets since that's what I had -- so soup was pale golden color, but flavor was still great. Used 2 1/2 C diced beets and more chicken broth. Per suggestion of others, sweated onions & used 2 tsp fennel seeds for more flavor. Also had no kefir, so subsituted greek yogurt. Will definitely make again.

This was very good. I did as two reviewer said and added more fennel and fennel seed as well as the truffle oil. The soup has beautiful color, very flavorful as well as healthy!!

Really nice, simple flavours and healthy! Would recommend instead of sautéing onions and fennel bulb for only 5mins, sweat them on very low heat for about 10mins so they become really soft and sweet. For those who are not familiar with kefir, make sure you select the plain kind that is NOT effervescent for this soup unless you want a little fizz. I needed to add more chicken broth, almost a cup more, as most of it had boiled off. Also, high quality blenders are worth the investment- if you try to use something like a Magic Bullet you won't be happy with the results- you need something powerful enough to homogenize all ingredients. Enjoy!

Delicious... did use more fennel as others mentioned and also reserved some raw diced fennel for topping (to add texture). Finished with a little cracked pepper and a few drops of truffle oil which i found complimented the earthiness of the beets.

This is a very great recipe- loved the fennel - because of what others said - I added a 1/4 TSP more seeds and about 1/4 cup more fennel bulb and the flavour came through

This recipe was simple, relatively quick, and very tasty. I used an immersion blender in place of blending in batches (to save myself from the spilling that would surely happen), and it made the process less labor-intensive. I even found Dairy-Free Kefir, so the recipe is suitable for those who have lactose intolerances. Delicious, warm, and I'll definitely be making this again.

Try adding more fennel seeds to boost the fennel flavor - and maybe even grinding some in the spice mill or mortar.

sour cream or yogurt would work perfectly!

I can't find kefir. Would sour cream or yoghurt do instead?

You make the hearts by simply adding dollops of keifir and drawing a butter knife down through the middle of the circles...viola - hearts.

Rating: 0
To "A Cook from Merion, PA": You can make those hearts by placing several little dollops of kefir onto the soup and dragging a toothpick through the middle of them.

I'm giving this 4 forks even before I make it. Love beet borscht! How do you make those adorable hearts?

Rating: 2
I give 2 forks for "good." As written, you really don't taste much fennel. The recipe should be called Beet Soup and fennels should be saved as a starring role in another recipe! The resulting beet puree is a stain liability on all surfaces. Beware when transferring between the pot to the blender (my immersion blender couldn't do the job.)

Delicious soup! I took a chance and cooked it for a soup exchange. In future I would alter the amount of fennel - I think it needs a bit more. Looking forward to seeing how the flavours blend further in the morning.
