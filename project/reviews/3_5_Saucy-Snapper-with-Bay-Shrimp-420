This recipe was incredible. The sauce was delicious and made the fish so flavorful. The only change I made was omitting the fennel seeds. This dish was a total hit and I'm sure my husband will be asking for it again very soon.

Left out fennel but I got tremendous compliments from my guests. Would make it again and again. Served with baked potato rolled in olive oil and drenched with sea salt then baked for hour.

Loved this recipe! I'm a vegetarian, so fish/meat dishes have to be fool-proof b/c I don't taste for flavor. I made this for my boyfriend and he loved the mix of flavors. And I loved how easy it was to make. Served this with Twice Baked Potatoes with Goat Cheese and Chives (from this site) and it was a huge hit.

The sauce has enough flavor that even people who don't like fish can still enjoy this dish. But if you're sensitive to licorice, the fennel seeds do jump out on occasion.

Very good and will definitely prepare again. However, I used fresh shrimp instead of the pre-cooked, adding them when I poured the sauce over the snapper for the last 10 minutes of cooking. I believe this improved both the presentation and the taste.

Hmm. i made everything according to the directions, but i was not too impressed; however, my boyfriend was. maybe it was b/c i got in a fight w/ the fish counter boy?

I made this twice and my family loved it. I used an herb mixture and cut down on the amount of green pepper.

This dish is so flavorful and so easy and quick to prepare. I added tabasco for a little extra spice.
