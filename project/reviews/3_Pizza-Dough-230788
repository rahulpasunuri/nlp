this makes a very good, very simple pizza dough. It is def. in the top 3 that I have done. It is fairly quick to make, and not as challenging as some that I have done. You really dont want to skimp on the flour when you are forming the pizza crusts. The recipie tied in with it gives a good account on how to form them

I really do not believe that I have ever seen a recipe that ended with letting the dough rise. And then what? I used this recipe and treated as I did other pizza doughs. Terrible. Very sticky dough with a dry and hard crust result. This is not my first attempt and decided to try this because my partner picked it out. This is really the very first recipe from Epicurious that I would never make again and never recommend.

Not as good as Giada's recipe from 2007.

Great recipe..very tasty! I added 1tsp sugar and brushed raw edges of crust with olive oil prior to baking. Next time I would let the dough rise longer before using. Careful to not overwork the dough as it will toughen up on you. We cooked our pizzas on a stone (preheated for an hour at 500F) at 500F for 8-10. Overcooking makes for a tough, chewy crust.

I have never made homemade pizza before but this past weekend we gave it a try and this dough was perfect. Easy to make, and turned out perfectly.

I've tried quite a few pizza dough recipes, and this one is going to be my standard from now on! Be sure not to add too much flour - I went tablespoon by tablespoon and needed only 2 1/4 cups. The dough should be soft and sticky, and will have a bit of trouble holding its shape in the bowl. But once rolled out *very* thinly and baked (500 degrees for 15 minutes in my oven) it made for a crisp and chewy, yet tender crust. Perfect!

Easy to make and to eat.

I use this recipe, modified, for grilled pizza, and it makes an excellent crust. Double the yeast, and use two cups of flour plus 3/4 cup of (yellow) corn meal. Works great in a bread machine, and use more corn meal for forming the crusts.

Nice dough! The pizza was just the way I like it. If you use too little dough, it will come out hard. Use just a bit more than you think you need and it will be amazing!

The final product looked absolutely beautiful but failed the taste test. After 18 minutes at 450F on a pizza stone, the crust was just way too hard and dry. Salty, too.

I've never made my own pizza dough before, but I was having a party with my girlfriends and their kids so I tried this recipe. It is so simple and the crust turns out so beautifully, that I'll be making this one again and again. Be sure to use a pizza stone if you have one for a really nice crust.

This is an awesome recipe. The dough is unbelievably simple to make, easy to work with, and simply delicious. I used it for a pizza that was cooked at 500 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes, and it was just perfect.

This recipe has turned out perfectly every time I've made it. Even my fiance who lived in Rome agrees it's the best he's ever had in the States.
