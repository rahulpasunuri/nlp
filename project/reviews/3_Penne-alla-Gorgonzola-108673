I made this for dinner this evening and my kid loved it! Served it with a side salad and garlic toast. I made a few alterations/subtitutions: 1. heavy cream instead of milk (wanted a creamier sauce) 2. bow tie pasta instead of penne 3. omitted nutmeg (didn't have any)and pasta reserve water 4. added shrimp

I'm not going to rate the recipe, since I made so many changes: I used whole-wheat rotini rather than penne, fresh oregano rather than sage, added some vermouth to the sauce (right before adding the milk), cooked some broccoli with the pasta as it boiled, and added some pine nuts and julienned sun-dried tomatoes to the dish at the end. The result was a good, simple, one-dish summer meal that I would make again.

Dried sage tasted bitter...followed the recipe very closely (used 1/2 and 1/2 as I didn't have milk) but used shell wheat pasta. I'm sure this would have turned out excellent had my gorgonzola been decent - I didn't taste it before making the sauce and then realized it tasted like feta, not gorgonzola. The package said "stella gorgonzola" on it so it wasn't incorrect, just really crappy gorgonzola. Make sure that your cheese has enough "punch" before wasting a meal on it. No stars assigned as I need to remake this with better cheese.

Not bad, although I thought it would've been a lot better with broccoli and/or mushrooms added. I skipped the parmigiano to save costs, and added 1/4 cup white wine instead of reserved cooking water, which I would recommend.

My wife and I love this recipe and make it regularly; we prefer it with the Gorgonzola over the Blue cheese and typically substitute dried sage, though fresh is better.

My friend made this for dinner the other night, but added sun dried tomatoes. It was unbelievable. Very rich, like a sophisticated version of mac & cheese. I'm making it for some other friends tonight because I couldn't get enough of it.

I halved the recipe to see if I would like it, and the only change was to leave out the sage (didn't have any). I would only make this dish again if I added some carmelized onion or something else since the cheese sauce alone was so intense.

So-so. I tried as an alternative to a favoruite recipe that bakes penne in a bechamel sauce mixed with gorgonzola and fresh spinach. I will stick with that. I do believe you need both more liquid and some thickening in the sauce. Did like the sage.

I didn't find it to be dry, but I did find it to be very strong. I used extra nutmeg to soften the flavor; I would make it as a side dish next time - it was overwhelming as the entree.

Both my husband and I found the recipe to be a little dry even though I used the entire 1/2 cup of reserved water and did not use the entire cup of parmesan. I'd suggest reserving a bit more water or adding some chicken broth as I did to loosen it up a bit.
