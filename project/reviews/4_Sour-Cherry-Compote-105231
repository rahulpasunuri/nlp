As another reviewer suggested, I substituted almond extract for the rosewater. I cut the water back to 1/3 cup and found the consistency to be just right. Next time I will decrease the sugar slightly as I found that the sweetness overpowered the flavor of the cherries. We thought it was delicious and I'll be making it again.

Like a previous reviewer, I had no rosewater (French or otherwise) so I skipped it. It may be why this seemed to lack a little depth. Either that or it was the excess liquid. Next time I will make it with 1/2 cup or even 1/3 cup of water. I poured off the extra liquid and will use it in some sort of mixed drink or baked good so that it doesn't go to waste. I served it over vanilla ice cream and it certainly made it a Dessert with a capital D and not plain old dessert.

Having had trouble with runniness in my sour-cherry pies, I've tried using this recipe tonight to make sour-cherry filling ahead of baking a pie and thus control the filling thickness. The cornstarch given in the recipe was too little to adequately thicken the cherry syrup (my cherries were juicy), so I doubled it. The result was a good thickish syrup, apt for either compote or filling.

This was delicious. Not too sweet, it would be lovely with cheesecake. I used almond extract instead of rosewater, as it beautifully enhances the sour cherry flavor.

No rosewter on hand, so skipped it. Tastes like cherry pie without the work or calories. It was wonderful with lemon sorbet, and would also be good on vanilla ice cream. Not as much liquid is needed as is calle for; next time, I'd just use the cherry juice, plus water if nexesary, to equal no more than half a cup.
