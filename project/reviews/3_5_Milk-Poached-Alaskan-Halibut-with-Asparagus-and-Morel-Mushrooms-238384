I found an abundance of morels in my yard this year (yay!!) and was looking for a great way to use them. The fish in this recipe was incredibly expensive, so I used just four filets, and they were indeed small, but what a treat... I agree that the vinegar should be added to taste, using champagne vinegar as it was what I had on hand. I also sauteed up a fair amount of minced shallot with the morels (love that combo), which I think added great flavor. I grilled the asparagus as other reviewers had suggested. My chief complaint was that the sauce curdled when I added the wine. I should have expected this, but did not. It didn't affect the flavor, but I wasn't fond of the consistency. However, the fish was so delicious, and like silk on the tongue; the morels were the most delicious I've ever had. Great recipe.

Outstanding! This was SO good and a perfect spring meal made with morels I found growing in the garden. My 5 year old loved it too. I did modify it a little...didn't have fresh thyme so I omitted it. I didn't have a ton of morels, so I also made up some carmelized/crispy brown onions which extended that great morel flavor. I also roasted the asparagus instead of boiling because I love the flavor the roasting brings out. I had trouble getting the filets out of the milk bath because they are somewhat thin; I used tongs which was a mistake. But either way it turned out great, even if that issue affected the presentation a bit. YUM!

I think this is a great recipe but the sherry vinegar overpowers the morel mushrooms (I love morels). Next time I will use a lot less vinegar so it adds a hint of flavor. I would recommend adding the vinegar to taste.

Outstanding recipe. I used Haddock as halibut is prohibitively expensive, morels from the woods nearby and fresh roasted asparagus. Pretty presentation and the tangy morels with the cream sauce were yummy. Be sure and remove the skin before adding the sauce. This is a winner.

Great spring recipe! I used Halibut from the farmer's market (no skin). I roasted the asparagus instead of boiling it. I used skim milk with some cream. These are great flavors.

Wow! Very simple, yet delicious. It isn't asparagus season yet so I used frozen asparagus. Fresh Halibut and Chanterelles were obtained at Deluxe foods in Aptos, ca. The fish was perfect. Next time I will add half of the sherry vinegar and thyme to the Chanterelles.

Used 4x8 ounce filets as a 4 ounce filet is too small. I love halibut and the fresh morels combination. Full marks for this one!

This dish was excellent. My only substitution was to use chanterelles. The cooking method causes the halibut to soak up a lot of sauce flavor, which is great because halibut can be a little bland often. The sauce is also surprisingly delicious. It's rich, but not in a cloying way. Some of the fish juice sort of permeates it and lightens it up. 4 oz. is kind of small for a main dish, though.
