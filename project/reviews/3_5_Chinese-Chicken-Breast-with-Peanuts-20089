Pretty decent Chinese dish-I followed one of the other reviewers suggestions and doubled the ingredients for the sauce. I also added water chestnuts and celery. I found that sesame oil was critical for the recipe. I just kept tasting and adding as appropriate. Definitely an easy and welcome addition to the weekday repertoire!

This was really good, but REALLY salty tasting... can't have imagined it with the MSG (does anyone still use that?!). A fun, ethnic recipe...used 3/4 pepper flakes and it was perfectly spicy. Added approx. 1/2 c water at end to cut salt in increase the sauce's liquid.

I found this recipe easy to make and quite tasty. I also needed to add additional ingredients to make more sauce. In response to usernameme's memo of additional ingredients and procedure. I cook the chicken first and remove from heat, then add more oil and the veggies. When the veggies are ready I add the sauce and the chicken both. I serve it as soon as the sauce has thickened. Chicken stays moist that way.

UPDATE TO MY LAST REVIEW: Add more honey, soy, ginger, hoisin etc to the sauce and really try to get a tangy, sweet, sticky, spicy marinade. Otherwise, it's kind of dull. When you get good Kung Pao at a restaurant, you make this recipe and go "Mine stinks". We still make it many times per month.

Good. Better than most take out and you can control how the chicken is chopped. As most have said, need to up the quantities for the sauce. Didn't have peanuts, used cashews. Added diced zuc, water chestnuts and squash.

I read all the reviews before going to Whole Foods to buy the ingredients. I decided to triple only the ingredients that are used in the sauce (as I was having rice with this) and added 2 veggies. My recipe tonight was: BOWL #1: 1 cup unsalted peanuts (I boiled for a few minutes first), 2/3 cup diced red pepper, 1 can diced water chestnuts. BOWL #2: 2.5 boneless skinless chicken breasts diced, 1/2 tsp sea salt, 1 tsp soy sauce, 1 TBL cornstarch. BOWL #3: 3 TBL soy sauce, 3 tsp cornstarch, 3 tsp organic sugar, 10 drops white rice vinegar, 3 tsp white wine vinegar (didnt have sherry or rice wine), 2 large scallions, 2 cloves garlic, 1 TBL minced ginger from jar, 20 drops sesame oil, 1/4 cup of water. I heated the wok to high, added organic canola oil, then added veggies (BOWL #1). Stirred for about 1 minute added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes. (At this point, I should have moved the veggies to side of wok before adding chicken so the chicken could cook faster) I added chicken (BOWL #2) cooked for 1-2 minutes, stirring (I did have to add a tiny bit of water when cooking the chicken because I did not move veggies to the sides first and it was not cooking fast enough because it was mixed with the other stuff) and then poured BOWL #3 on top. I paired with steamed brown rice w/the tiniest pinch of organic sugar during steaming. The red pepper heat was perfect for me. As a rule, I like mild wings if that helps to understand MY heat preference w/the red pepper. I will DEF make this again; boyfriend loved it and Kung Pao is his FAVORITE Asian dish. I imagine you could use diced celery too and that some of the cooking oils could be tested (peanut oil etc) instead of canola. Weve already discussed making this with Shrimp next!

This is so, so good! And easy. Spicy, too (I used about 3/4 tsp of red pepper flakes). I think next time I will try less salt (it was really salty), and less oil. But, really, what a tasty, addictive dish.

To the cook from Valparaiso, Ch'ao means to stir-fry

Hubby and I both thought this was as good as anything we could get at a chinese restaurant! Due to using what I had on hand, I made the following adjustments: No peanuts, no MSG, used chopped shallot in place of scallion, dry ginger in place of fresh, added chopped red peppers and increased the amount of soy sauce to both the chicken and veggie/sauce mix. I have the "real" ingredients now and look forward to making it again soon

Pretty good and extremely easy. I added diced red peppers and used yellow onion, diced, instead of scallions. Excellent as lettuce wrap filling.

Not bad, but just kind of ordinary. The sauce smelled excellent but wasn't super to eat. I think take-out would have been better. Definitely needed the full amount of pepper flakes.

Followed this recipe nearly word for word, but did add more garlic and ginger as we love them both. It was like a dish from a good Chinese restaurant! It was a little more spicy than I expected. My husband and I liked, but almost too spicy for my 8 and 10 year olds. Will definitely make again.

I made this when looking for fast, easy recipes with common ingredients (no extra trip to the store), and this one is excellent. I have never added MSG, and sometimes omit the scallions if I don't have them handy, but still have great results. It's a great mid-week dinner.

Hold onto your hats because this recipe is absolutely phenomenal. I made it with the MSG and it's positively addictive. I served it over rice with a little vinegar and I couldn't get enough of it. Tastes just like it was made in a restaurant.

After much disgust with low quality, over preserved Chinese take out I decided the only way I would eat Chinese again is if I made it myself. This was really tasty and worth tweaking. I guess MSG must be a big factor,however, this still has good flavor. I doubled the scallions for color and added 2 TBS of soy sauce at the end for a little extra sauce.

This was really good, almost better than my favorite Chinese Restaurant! For the first time since using Epicurious, I followed this recipe almost exactly to the letter (didn't use MSG and used a lo-carb thickener instead). I don't think I'd change anything except use a bit more scallion. It's easy, quick and hits the spot. My husband didn't even miss the rice. Do-over!

Me and My Husband both loved this. I also tripled the sauce ingredients and added alot of garlic since its the consummate seasoning around our house. the fried peanuts were spicy and delicious. I will definately make this again. Perhaps with the addition of some snow peas and carrots for color. :) yummy yummy yummy :) for those that dont think that this dish is too bland I would suggest slightly charring the chili peppers to release the oils 8*)I also ressomend throwing in a little bit of worchestershire sauce and enought vinegar so you can actually taste it

I've made this twice and found it a very good, though not great, dish. It's important to add the full amount of red pepper; last time I didn't, and the dish was too bland. Also, I suggest hardly giving the peanuts extra heat at all -- maybe 15 or 20 seconds, not a full minute -- or you may burn them. Last, eat this all in the first go -- it's excellent right away but just mediocre as a leftover (the peanuts soften).

This is damn good. If you close your eyes, you'd swear you were eating chinese from your favorite take out spot. We make this often, always quadrupling the sauce and adding shitake mushrooms, or whatever. Make this, you won't regret it.

Wonderful! I served over white rice - we all loved it and I have made it several times. I did rinse the salt off the peanuts first.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I think it could use a bit less salt (or maybe just use low-salt soy sauce), and it did not need the entire 1/4 cup of oil. But this was divine and very easy!

This recipe had a great fresh flavor. I tripled the ingredients for the sauce and it was just barely enough to provide seasoning for the chicken & rice. I would definitely repeat this one.

Quick,easy,and delicious! Next time I will double the sauce so that I'll have enough of it left after thickening to easily flavor the rice. I love the sauce!

Be liberal with spices. I put 1 T. red pepper flakes instead of what was called for, and it could have been a little spicier. I also put in a lot of walnuts instead of the peanuts, and added blanched broccoli florets for some color and vegetable/fiber. Very quick prep and cook-up. Big hit with family, including picky daughter. It made a lot of servings, so count on leftovers.

Wonderful and easy! I did add one more scallion, which made it perfect.
