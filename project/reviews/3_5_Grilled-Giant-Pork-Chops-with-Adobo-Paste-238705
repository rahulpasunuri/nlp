I scraped some of the paste off immediately before putting on the grill (was cooking with gas). This allowed me to reapply it when I took the heat down for the indirect heat portion, which I think preserved a lot of the flavor of this excellent paste (I doubled the amount of cumin and used fresh oregano instead, also doubled).

This rub is fantastic! I had it on boneless loin chops (7 small ones) and I just loved it. Can't wait to try it on chicken and beef. I served the pork with a mango/shallot/chipotle salsa and it was a nice, but probably not necessary, complement.

Give pork chops a new sophisticated flavor. Highly recommended as a dinner party recipe also very cost effective while showing good taste.

This was pretty good. We dropped the chili down to 1/2 a tsp, but other than that, we followed the recipe perfectly. I guess my one issue with this marinade would be that it's so strong that you lose the pork flavour. Other than that, it's good and we will probably make it again.

These were fab. 2" boneless chops, marinated 1/2 day and grilled. Definitely a repeat meal!

I used pork ribs instead of porch chops. Country style not spare rib and I wasn't exactly impress with the dish. I like rich deep flavors and I wasn't able to achieve that with this recipe. I'm not writing the review months after I have prepared the dish and I can't even remember how it tasted... Not a something I would cook again.

The spice aspect of this recipe was delish and we will make it again, but with fresh oregano. The dried oregano had the texture of dirt. I was flossing it out of my teeth all night. I used the rub on BBQ baby back ribs and it was a good match. I marinated the ribs in the rub for 2 hours, then baked (covered in foil) for an hour, then grilled for about 10 minutes. Subbed smoked paprika for 25% of the regular. Even with all the advance marinating and the hour in the oven, the spice flavor was great. Oddly, the dried oregano never softened up. Easy to assemble.

In Australia we don't find recipes like this - I grilled the pork chops on the barbecue with a smoking packet underneath on the gas barbecue. The flavours were fantastic - will do this recipe often.

It was okay. Decent flavor, but didn't wow me. I have been grilling for years, and I can not imagine charcoal making enough difference to make me rate this higher. I did use a gas grill (have charcoal too), but it was lacking some taste...maybe a little more salt and garlic? It had the essence of Chili powder, but didn't taste like it. Who knows, but it was fun, good, and interesting, but nothing I am going to run to again.

Tremendous. When I reach for pork, I reach for this recipe. Leftovers work great in wraps.

This is really great. I made it with thick-cut boneless chops and the times listed in the recipe were perfect. If you don't feel like breaking out the barbeque or don't have one, remember what Alton Brown said, your broiler is just an upside down barbeque! Broil on the top rack for direct heat, and then move to the bottom heat for indirect heat. No need for the roasting pan, either, your oven insulates it for you!

This is a very easy and flavorful recipe. I have made it with chicken and pork. Definitely experiment with different whole dried chilies instead of pepper flakes, whole cumin, and mexican oregano to add complexity. Using quality ingredients will make this dish company-worthy! I also mash the paste with a mortar and pestle to release more flavor. To the previous post, I find no need for the roasting pan, just cover your charcoal grill.

Just a question, before I try to make this: is there any way around buying a disposable roasting dish, which seems like a lot of work? What about just covering the grill?

i'm not normally a big meat and potatoes kinda gal, but this recipe was wonderful. the meat was tender and quite flavorful. i used boneless pork chops instead. i plan to make this dish for guests very soon.

I've made this 3 times now. It really made grilled chicken special. I also used thick cut loin chops. I increased the oil to 4 tablespoons but everything else was the same. I wrapped the meat in plastic and refridgerated for 4 hours before cooking. The meat was moist and very flavorful.

My husband and I both loved this recipe. We are even planning a dinner party around it! We found that really getting the taste of the lime zest to come out is the key. I would also say that refrigerating the chops must be a mistake because the cook who found it surprisingly unflavorful missed out on some awesome flavor!

Found it surprisingly unflavorful, even after spending about 45 minutes in the fridge covered in chili paste.

Don't get me wrong the flavor was good with the flavor added by Charcoal but i just don't think anything was really special about it and my rubs i used generally are more flavorful. I did use pasilla powder as recommend for a more complex flavor.

Quick and Delicious We had these chops with a mango salsa and fresh guacamole. YUM. Definitely something to make again. I made no alterations to the original recipe.

Simple and delicious. Great flavour. Will definitely try again with chicken and/or steak.

Delicious and extremely simple. We just seared them on the stovetop in a skillet and covered the pan with the heat lowered to finish.

First I brined the chops overnight in a mix of 1C brown sugar, 1C regular sugar, 1/4 C kosher salt and 1 qt. water. The only change I made to the paste recipe was to substitute orange for the lime. I put them on the smoker with a mix of hickory and applewood chips. Smoked for about 45-50 minutes. AWESOME! I'm going to use this same method to do some turkey mignons next!

Delicious...got restaurant quality pork loin chops and they were incredibly moist. I will make this all summer long. Served with 3 Bean Salad on this site (2007--one with celery) and grilled zuchinni slices with olive oil, s and p....

I used the adobo paste with thick filet mignon and grilled it on an indoor (two burrner) grill instead of using pork and as the blurb says, it was excellent

Awesome. We used thinner pork chops and I paired it with the chayote and hearts of palm salad from May 07 and some polenta. It was a big hit!

this was amazing. Brined the chops first with apple cider,salt, brown sugar and water. Put on the paste and threw on the grill. Very flavorful and moist.
