This recipe worked great for me. The muffin tins were missing from the house I was working at, so I used their silicone ice cube trays. Slightly square, but it worked great!

I made this recipe the first time and mistakenly opened the over door to add another pan...what a disaster! I made it again the next day, following the recipe to the law, and success! I'll do this again, this time with the roast beef!

Great taste, but a ZERO for puffability. I followed everyone's hints: room temp, higher heat etc. Nothing puffed at all. Nothing. So we had great biscuits. Next time, I'll find another recipe when I want popovers.

Note to dipofi: Try putting the popover or muffin tin in the oven and make the batter while the oven is preheating. Put the batter in the fridge while waiting and once the oven is up to temp, take the popover tin out and immediately pour the COLD batter in.

I have made this popover recipe about 10 times with absolute success every time. I tried another popover recipe but it didn't provide as much creaminess in the center. This recipe doesn't need it but I brush the popover cavities with melted butter before pouring the batter in which gives the popovers a nice buttery crust. I always come back to this recipe. Dead easy to make and a family favorite.

Our refridgerator rarely contains WHOLE milk. We buy either 1% milk or 2% milk. Therefore I use one cup of the LOW FAT milk I have and OMIT THE 1/4 CUP WATER. In the cooler months I set out my one cup low fat milk and two eggs on the counter for several hours to raise them to room temperature before I whisk up the batter.....this help the popovers rise to their full potential consistently. If you have ambient temperature milk and ambient temperature eggs baking time will be reduced to 30-35 minutes. Because Popovers rise so dramatically try to divide batter in the tins fairly fairly equally or your Popovers will vary a lot in size....but all will be deliscious in taste regardless. I often add ground Cardoman or some ground Anise to my batter for variety. Tasty, tasty!

I've made these twice in muffin tins (small and large depending on how many I want) - quick and easy, better than dinner rolls. A key to make them "pop" is to generously spray the tins with PAM, put into preheated oven at 425 for 3 mins. then pour batter to 2/3 full and cook at 425 for 25 mins. Came out very light with big tops. Looking forward to experimenting by adding herbs and a little cheese to the mix! Yum,

This recipe was so horrible. There is nothing in it to make the popovers raise!!! They turned out like bricks. Do not make this!

they were all delicious and almost all popped wonderfully; many compliments on the taste. however, be sure to check them after 30 minutes, ours were all but done at that point so we slitted the tops and let them go a few minutes longer.

FANTASTIC but after lots of experimenting to get these to "POP", the ingredients must be at room temperature and turn up the oven to 400 degrees. The oven has to be hotter at the very start. Watch until the are golden brown cooking for 35 to 40 minutes. Love these and so does everyone else.

I never had a popover until I made these. They were great, although they need to come out of the oven 15-20 minutes before scheduled.

This is a solid popover recipe. A few tips for popover newbies: 1. Heat your popover pans in the oven while it is preheating. Remove pans from the oven, spray or butter and pour batter into hot tins. This makes very light and fluffy popovers. 2. Remember to pierce the popovers with a knife tip just as they come out of the oven to allow the steam to escape and prevent collapse.

So delicious! Loved these! I used the smaller muffin tins. I think bigger would be better. This is a pretty easy, straight-forward recipe to make.

They were tasty but didn't pop up very much. I'll try another recipe next time.

Very good and very easy. I used all-purpose flour but added 1/2 tsp. baking powder and they turned out very fluffy. I used an extra egg but they still turned out slightly doughy. Next time I will probably add a bit more milk as well.

Very easy to make and delicious. This will become a staple. I added some gruyere and rosemary; a good basic recipe to add flavors of your choice.

I am a 12 year old baker and this recipe amazing! A BIG hint is to heat the pan in the oven while you cook!! The outcome of this is very fluffy and light popovers. I have made this recipe many times and have never had a bad batch!

Ut oh--something is wrong with the timing on this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, using muffin tins instead of popover tins and set the timer for 30 minutes (having read the warnings in other reviews). I checked the oven at 28 minutes and they were over done--cooked inside and out and slightly dry. Some also stuck to the pan, despite buttering. With butter they were certainly tasty while still hot, but I'm glad I tried these today as a pre-Thanksgiving dry run. I think I might try another recipe for tomorrow.

Simple to make and much less fat than Yorkshire Pudding or other popover recipes that I have. Mine cooked in 30 minutes, so as others said, watch the time.

I tried this recipe on Mother's Day. It was very simple to make and the popovers turned out delicious! My family love it and ask for more right away.

We followed the recipe exactly and they burned. I'll use a different recipe next time, but for those who want to try this one ... watch and make sure they don't burn

Why have popovers been forgotten in the march of time? Easy to make, delicious, and this recipe does them justice. And who says the English can't cook?

I had never made popovers before but they sounded so delicious, I had to try it. It's amazingly simple and the taste and texture were incredible. Was delicious with the Puerto Rican Stew (recipe available from epicurious also).

I actually used the original recipe from my Gourmet Annual Cookbook which this recipe is almost identical too. As far as popovers go, you will not find an easier recipe with such flawless results as this one. We cooked ours at 400, not 375. We also extended the cooking time by 10 minutes to almost an hour total. Venting the tops is a must if you want them cooked throughout.

I had to get an A for my Food's class because i had a bet with a friend that i could beat her grade. My teacher said if we made a pop-over recipe she would give us extra credit(we were working on qiuck breads) and i made them and i am currently winning the bet!

the recipe made six huge popovers in my 1/2 cup muffin pans. I'd start checking them after 35 minutes, as they browned quite a bit. They were so moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside-delicious!!

I wonder what happened with the cook that only gave this recipe "one fork"? I've used this recipe numerous times and always get great results and rave reviews. If their problem was with the popovers being overdone, try lower the oven temp by about 5 or 10 degrees...this works for me.

This is an almost fool-proof recipe. The popovers held their shape 100% better than the ones I always used to make from the Moosewood book. In my fancy-schmancy convection oven, though, I did have to watch not to over-bake; I ended up knocking about ten minutes off the recommended time, but that seems to usually be the case with my new toy.

My husband loves popovers. I would say this is probably the best recipe, very very easy. Great for company. I used a big six muffin tin which worked great. Will make them again.
