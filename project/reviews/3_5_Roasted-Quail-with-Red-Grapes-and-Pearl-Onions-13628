I agree with the previous reviewers on the sauce and roasted grape onion combo...super great. I will use this prep again, but with a Cornish game hen or pork. I liked the quail, great flavor, but something easier to find for everyday would be good. To the recipe, I didn't bother with the ghee, just used regular butter. Trader Joes has a great pound bag of frozen, peeled pearl onions, used those...awesome! To the previous reviewer regarding the extra glaze, I think they wanted you to deglaze the pan after you plated the quail, onions, and grapes. I did that, but I really think it made a very slim difference either way. All in all, i would definitely make the sauce again.

This was a very good recipe; the onion/grape stuff was really fantastic. The quail came out a bit dry, and my oven is even on the cool side (I cooked as directed, time and temperature). I recommend checking it a few minutes ahead of the recommended cooking time. One thing confused me: after I made the butter/glaze mixture, what to do with the remaining glaze? I couldn't find anything in the recipe that indicated what to do with it, except maybe that last part about the drizzling, but it doesn't make sense because it was already less than half a cup, so I wouldn't reduce it any more to get to that quantity. So it goes. It was really good.

It may take a while to cook but it's all worth it. The red grapes and pearl onions combination is maybe one of the best "unexpected" sides I have ever tried. Beware of the oven temperatures though, especially if you have one of the newer, convection models.
