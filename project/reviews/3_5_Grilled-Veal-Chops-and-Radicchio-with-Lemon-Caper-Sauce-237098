I have made this dish for Supper Club and special dinners. I always cook more Radicchio and sauce. I have done this with boneless, skinless chicken breasts and center cut boneless pork chops with equally excellent results.

I have been making this dish since it first appeared. I make it at least 3 times a year. We love it! It is simple and elegant. Can't go wrong with this.

This is an all time favorite of ours. The flavors are fabulous and it is so easy to make. The first time I made it I didn't serve it over the radicchio. However, now I ALWAYS do the Radicchio. Itried it with a rib eye but we prefer the veal chop. Yummy yum!!!!

This dinner was easy to make (though a bit pricey with the cost of the veal and radicchio) and it was delicious. I wouldn't change a thing and will make it again. Great with a crisp sauvignon blanc. We also made the roasted potatoes ... excellent.

I made this for valentines day and i thought it was really good! I used pork chops instead and added a little sugar to the sauce. It was also really easy to make

We made these for our Valentine's Day dinner. They were absolutely delicious. You need just a spoonful of the sauce over the chops. Instead of preparing the radicchio as in this recipe, we did a grilled romaine/radicchio salad w/balsamic vinegar. Delicious!

This dish was good. The capers added great flavor. We cooked in a cast iron. It was a bit too oily with the sauce, but the radicchio was terrific.

I did not use the radicchio in this recipe but the lemon-caper sauce oever the grilled veal chop was wonderful! Really easy combination. The sauce would be good on many things-meats and veggies. I doubled the sauce and added some lemon juice from the lemon.
