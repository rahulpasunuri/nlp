A-MA-ZING! This is my favorite stuffing of all time! All of my guests had seconds and I think some had thirds. What little was left was gone by the next day. If you love Savory, you will love this recipe!

I made this with gluten free french style bread and it came out great!!

I really enjoyed this dressing/stuffing. It goes well with everything that was made for Thanksgiving and would work well in any situation. I felt that by doing the items ahead of time just added to the flavor and made it so easy to put together.

We have made this for Thanksgiving for the last two years and it has been fantastic both times!

Generally I jump at the opportunity to use prosciutto, but in this case, I felt justice wasn't done to either the dressing or the prosciutto! The recipe is great, but for the cost of prosciutto, I think it would have been better to use bacon. I probably will next time. Yummy still~

I used 4 ounces of pancetta rather than prosciutto and it was phenomenal.

This was fabulous except that I think the rosemary flavor was a bit too strong. Next time I'd use fresh rosemary or fresh thyme. Definitely great for mushroom lovers.

I made this last year when I hosted my first-ever Thanksgiving dinner, and it was so good that I am here in October making sure I have the recipe-- we are going to make a tiny 2 person early Thanksgiving meal this year almost entirely so that we can have this, as my husband's family has a different recipe that they use.

This was absolutely fabulous! Followed the directions exactly and did the prep work, as suggested, a day ahead. Just phenomenal!

Easily made into a accompanying dressing for a Standing Rib Roast Beef Stock instead of Chicken broth Red Wine instead of White

My favorite dressing up to date. Love mushrooms, especially the little buttons!

This is great! It can be too salty because of the prosciutto so make sure to use low-salt broth and unsalted butter.

Earthy and delicious. No more ultradense dressings for me. Prosciutto and green onion garnishes lend nice crisp textures.

Flavor was good. Turned out a littel too soggy for my tast. If I make this again I will lessen the amount of liquid and keep it in the oven longer. Served at a dinner party and results were not worth the effort

Simply awesome, not much more to say. Will likely make this every opportunity I get.

This was absolutely fabulous - will make again and again! A couple of things - first, I didn't have rustic rosemary bread so I took ciabatta and brushed with olive oil and crushed rosemary and cooked until toasty - about 10-15 min. I then cut into the squares and my hubby kept telling me to cut off the crust but thankfully I didn't listen to him. Second, I used shallots instead of galic as one of my guests is allergic to garlic.

A hit with the family, as they do not like fruit or dried fruit in their dressing, but love mushrooms. However it came out a little dry to my taste, so next time I will increase the mushroom liquid/chicken broth to 2 1/2 cups. Also, as the rosemary bread I used was already quite aromatic, the additional dried crushed rosemary made the complete dish just a tad overpowering. Will add a little less next time.

so straightforward and simple that I made it exactly according to the directions (for once!). cooked up beautifully. agree w/prior review, the flavor is great. as long as our guests like mushrooms this will be The stuffing recipe for us.

Assuming your guests like mushrooms, this is fantastic. It has a wonderful flavor. I made the dressing then left it in the fridge prior to baking it while I made other parts of the meal and then baked it, and it was great.
