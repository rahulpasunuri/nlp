Soooo, I'm not sure what makes this good or unusual. Addiing the oil without frying or sauteing the veggies just makes this an oily dish. Next time I'll just steam the veggies and then toss with a tiny bit of olive oil and spices.

This dish was wonderful! I made it for dinner with friends and everyone raved about it. I would make a couple of edits next time around: add more parsnips ~ they were absolutely delicious, a bit spicy and very moist and tender. The fingerling potatoes were ok ~ a bit bland and dry. I would do baby red potatoes next time to add more color. Fabulous overall. This is a keeper

I doubled the quantities on potatoes and carrots for a large dinner party (Passover) and could have used 1/2 (recipt amount) for the butter sauce. I made it 2 hrs ahead and simply heated in a low oven before serving. It made a lovely presentation. Delicious, light and easy.

Very tasty! I added 3 cloves of roasted garlic with the butter during the last step of the recipe -- it was wonderful! I highly recommond this recipe!

We very much enjoyed this dish and so did our company. I've made it since and it's also good with just the fingerling potatoes.

This is a wonderful summer substitute for the oven-cooking method we use for vegetables all winter long (based on a very old Gourmet recipe!) There's just something very special about baby vegetables, so elegent and delicious.
