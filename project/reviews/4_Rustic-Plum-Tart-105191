I am madly in love with this recipe. I've made it three times this week! I first made it with plums, using about 2 pounds of plums. Then, I tried with peaches and then with apples. I added about half a teaspoon each of cinnamon, ginger and a pinch of nutmeg to the crust. And before putting down the fruit, I did 2 Tbls of flour 2 Tbls sugar and 1/4 cup ground almonds. This made a nice bed to soak up the fruit juices and kept the crust really crispy.

Overall, this was a decent recipe, however it doesn't state weather or not you should remove the skins from the plums. Also, for a nine inch pie, one and half pounds of plums is not enough -- I used over twice that amount. The crust is very good, but also not enough for a nine inch round. I ended up making a rectangular tart -- 4.5" x 14"

Delicious, everyone loves it that has had it. I will be making this for many years to come!

Delicious. I added a hand full of processor ground walnuts to the flour and sugar that are placed on the pastry before the plums are arranged. This tart tastes like autumn looks.

Made this for friends and everyone asked for seconds! Only changes - I added 1 Tablespoon of brandy to the plum mixture, and I reserved the plum liquid (after placing the plums on the dough) to drizzle over the plums halfway through baking, and completely left out the apricot preserves. The dough was great and easy to work with - however, I might have rolled it out too thin in parts and that contributed to some leaking from the dough while baking. Otherwise, great dessert! And easy!

This was delicious - used plums from the farmer's market, so they were extremely juicy.. cutting each half into 6 slices wasn't happening. I probably got four slices out of each plum, and I just threw them all in the middle of the dough, no layering here, but it looked fine.. rustic! I didn't use the apricot glaze and I don't think it's necessary if you have nice ripe plums. It was plenty sweet. The dough was really good, I'll use it again for sure.

Made this tonight and it turned out fantastic! Plums are in season now and therefore on sale. Great dessert! Used ready made pie crust in the refrigerated section with success.

Delicious plum tart; the combination of ginger, cinnamon, and sugar is perfect. I made this as parve so I used organic shortening for the crust, instead of butter. I also substituted confectioners sugar in the crust instead of regular sugar. I upped the sugar in the topping to 8 tablespoons instead of 6, and drizzled the assembled tart with a tablespoon of brandy before it went in the oven. I also omitted the butter drizzle (again because I was making parve) and omitted the apricot preserves at the end; it didn't need the apricot preserves. I recommend not using plums that are too ripe, otherwise they don't hold their shape and become very watery.

again this lovely plum tart was a "wow" at some late summer gatherings I attended. I did add lemon zest to the crust and it was a good touch.

The crust is amazing! Tender and flaky with a buttery (but not greasy) texture. For the filling, I tossed plums and peaches together, little sugar, little lemon juice, and spoonful of flour, no spices. The summer stone fruits are so good, not much is needed!

Wow!! This was really good! My plums were not very ripe. My pastry skills mediocre and I was in a hurry. I put a little bit too much water in the food processor at the end of the pastry making. However, the end result was far beyond my expectations. The pastry was incredibly flaky. The plums were tart/sweet and I got rave reviews! What more could I want?

For sake of time I used store bought pie crust (next time I will try the dough recipe) and followed instructions for the topping. It was pretty good considering it was plums. The dessert was not overly sweet which is nice if you pair it with some whip cream or ice cream which we did. Before I baked it I thought the ginger was going to be too strong but in the end I could barely tell it was in there. The apricot glaze was a nice touch since the plums weren't overly sweet. The juices that oozed out of the tart were yummy! Will definitely make this again.

This made for an impressive fast desert. I served it with a scoop vanilla ice cream. We had 8 dinner guests and it was just enough for all of us. The crust is THE best. I have already used the crust recipe for other things and it will be my pastry crust from now on.

We tried this with a bunch of satsuma plums picked fresh from grandpa's tree. It blew my mind. The flavor was intense, both sweet and tart, with a very flaky crust. We couldn't leave it alone (bad news for dad & I as we are diabetics)! But I now serve this to others whenever possible. It made a great end to a fun outdoor dinner at grandpa's.

I didn't care for the crust, as it was too crumbly. I believe the baking time is off, as well. At 45 minutes, it was far too brown.

best fruit tart i have ever had, really! i omitted 1 tbs of sugar since it seemed too much (my fruit was very ripe to say the least) and omitted the last tbs of butter on top. it was amazing - not too sweet, the perfect ratio of fruit to crust. with slices of vanilla ice cream, 3 people finished the whole tart in one night! the previous reviewer must have used too much water, with 2 tbs of ice water my dough was crumbly and perfect.

I will have to try this recipe again with a different crust. I let the dough chill for a few hours, and it was much too hard to roll out. When I let it warm up a bit, the dough became too delicate to handle. The fruit mixture was declicious, so I salvaged it in a crisp instead.

This tart is wonderful (one's in the oven right now). A couple modifications: I used Julia Child's pastry crust, which yielded a very thick crust, didn't use any preserves, and added some lemon juice to the plum mix. Once I replaced the cinnamon with garam masala when someone was allergic to it. I will definitely make it again and again, especially when plums are in season. Also, you really don't need a food processor.

This recipe was AWFUL with the plums from our tree. Sour, unattractrive, just plain bad. But since so many reviewers said it was good with other fruit, I tried it again -- this time with APPLES. Other than using no preserves, I followed the recipe to a "T" with Fuji apples, and it was delicious. Three guests asked for the recipe. I would definitely make this again. Plus, it was EASY.

The crust was great--will definitely try again, perhaps with a different filling, like peaches. I also added some flour to the fruit before baking rather than just sprinkling it on the crust. I realized that I didn't have any apricot jam after I decided to make it, but I went ahead anyway and it was still very good.

When I need a blow-out dessert, a rustic tart is the way to go. It's easy, impressive, and delicious. Also, this recipe includes a very versatile pastry - if desired, you could leave out most of the sugar and use for savory pies or tarts.

This crust recipe is the best one i have tried. If only I could find a savory crust that tastes as wonderful and flaky. I had some leftover spiced plum mixture, which tasted wonderful baked in the oven until soft and topped with a touch of vanilla ice cream.

The tart was a hit and quite tasty, but the plums were too tart, and the crust looked nothing like the picture.

This dessert is high in flavor and looks like you spent all day slaving over. I've mixed nectarines with the plums and its wonderful. I would suggest you roll out the dough on parchment paper, cut to rimmed baking sheet size, then add the fruit, etc. When finished baking, cool slightly then remove with two large spatulas to a serving platter. Works every time; easy clean-up. Best with vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt with berries on top. (`:

Pretty darn good with not a lot of time required. I added a little flour to the fruit before placing on the dough to make sure it'd not be too runny and it turned out great.

I found the crust difficult to roll out. I had cracks, and the juice leaked out onto pan and burned. I got it out of the pan onto a big plate, breaking off one edge. I patted it back on and it looked fine and was very tasty. It tasted a bit like a yummy cherry pie. Next time refrigerated the crust in a flat disk, rather than a round, but I still had the problem. The third time was the charm. I followed the directions from rustic plum pie. I added an extra tablespoon of butter, and used my old fashioned pastry cutter. I started with 2 T water and added 3T more. Gathered dough into a ball. On a work surface smear dough with heel of hand in 3 or 4 forward motions to make dough easier to work with. Form dough into a ball and flatten into a disk. Chill dough, wrapped in plastic wrap, 1 hour. Finally it worked OK.

i really love this receipe -the pastry is delicious and this is an easy easy pie! the only thing i would change is the egg wash - next time i am going to brush the crust with a little cream instead of egg the egg wash driped inside the filling some - will also try it with peaches this summer! yum!

This is an excellent recipe. I cut the cooking time by 5-10 minutes. I also have made it with apples, omitting the ginger but keeping the sugar & cinnamon measurements the same, and it comes out great as well.

This is also excellent with nectarines and blackberry jam substituted for the plums and apricot preserves. It's a HUGE hit whenever I make it and so simple, too.

This will be the second time I have made thie tart. It is delicious!! And with plums being in season right now, I may make it again.

When I use peaches, I add a tablespoon of Tapioca to them to compensate for the juice and 1/4 tsp. almond extract. It works perfect... I have made this using Nectarines at least 6 times and it always disappears fast. Another one is in the making...

I tried this for my dad who loves plum. It came out perfect. Except for there was too much liquid. After tossing the plums they sprang alot water which I poured over them before putting it in te oven..The result liquid everywhere. Next time I'll add cornstarch. or just reserve the liquid for another time!!! Yummy yummy and so easy!!

This is a terrific dessert for all of the ownderful plums available now! I took the advice of those who reduced the ginger and cinnamon and was glad that I did. This is definitely a keeper. Be sure to line your baking sheet as the juices can run despite the most careful pleating of the crust.

I've made this three times so far this summer and get rave reviews each time I serve it. It is so simple, yet so elegant. The crust is delicious and unlike other recipes I've tried, this one comes out consistently good. A bit of vanilla ice cream, and a mint sprig top this dessert off perfectly. I want to try making it as individual tarts next time for a small dinner party.

this is a great recipes; simple, quick, and delicious. i agree with the other reviewer about cutting back on the ginger and cinnamon. otherwise, the spices would have overwhelm the plum. i also sprinkled an additional 2T of sugar over the plum after it was drizzled with butter because the plums where on the tart side. this one is going into my recipe box.

After reading the recipe, I thought it can't be that good. However I had lots of plums and no other recipe. I thought it was worth a try. I was wrong. It wasn't just so-so, it was excellent! I will make this one again and again. I've already shared this recipe and I just baked it an hour ago.

What a tasty, simple recipe! I plan to make this again this weekend, and will also try it with nectarines before the summer is over. I might reduce the amount of giner and cinnamon to let the fruit test come through more, and I will decrease the amount of drizzled butter to just 1 tablespoon. You should definitely try this recipe.

This was easy and delicious. It would also work with other fruit, and I plan to make it with apples in the fall.

This tart was delicious and fun to make. Its eelegance lies in its simplicity and I cant wait to make this one again. I agree with the last reviewer to check the oven after thirty-five minutes as the crust was darker than I prefer after forty-five.

This was a delicious summer dessert! Be sure to watch it while baking - it was ready after 30-35 minutes.
