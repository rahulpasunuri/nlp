I did not think, as other posters wrote, that these were too thin. They were thick and fluffy - the thickest and fluffiest Ive tasted. Not sure why we had that difference. A trick I found: put batter intro a teacup and then pour over the griddle/ pan - onto one spot. The pancake will spread out to form a perfect circle and they will also be thicker than if you try to pour the batter into a round area.

These were rubbery, and not because we mixed them too much. The bananas on top don't caramelize, rather they get soggy and then that makes the entire pancake soggy. Not sure how to fix this recipe... Also not sure if the buttermilk is really helping anything in this recipe. Walnuts would improve the situation, but only slightly. Definitely won't make this again.

We loved these. Delicious and satisfying. The batch for just for my husband and me, so it was too many pancakes, but they were great. I used soymilk instead of buttermilk (lactose intolerance) and found the pancakes needed a little more sugra, but otehrwise great. The bananas were not fully carmelized, but sweet and delicious bursts of flavor. I fried up some bananas for a topping.

Really quick and simple to make. Each pancake takes a little longer than 2 minutes on each side, so if using a skillet I recommend two on the stove at a time or you will be making pancakes for longer than you hoped. I served them with regular syrup and they were still delicious!

I found the batter rather thin and the pancakes were also thin. I added some Greek yogurt and an additional 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder hoping to bulk up the results. They tasted fine but were not what I expected - the bananas did not carmelize enough - and I did slice them thin. I added walnuts as well as blueberries, since I had both on hand. I would make them again - but I would mess around with it some more.

I made the pancakes using oil and taking the advice of another reviewer to slice the bananas thinner. I also adjusted the number of slices depending on each pancake's size, usually using more than four per pancake. It's an easy and delicious brunch option. The carmelized bananas add a nice sweetness. My currently fussy toddler ate up the small ones I made specially for him.

Note: my rating here is just for the technique used to incorporate the banana into the pancakes. I don't like banana pancakes and neither does my husband, but I had lots of bananas to use up. We loved this. I used my own favorite pancake recipe, and added the bananas as described in the recipe. I cooked the pancakes in a little extra oil (actually used Earth Balance Buttery Sticks) and the bananas were perfectly caramelized. Not too sweet, either.

i totally screwed this one up, only because i didn't read the directions. i tried to cook the sliced bananas in maple syrup (in a skillet) the bananas turned to mush (as i'm sure you guessed). i only printed this so that you don't think to try it that way, it was not good. i will try it the correct way because that sounds much better.

We loved it! I added a little extra buttermilk to thin the batter a little but, the bananas turned out incredible. They tasted excellent and have become a favorite pancake recipe! I haven't had one person turn their nose up at them!

I followed the recipe exactly and my pancakes turned out very heavy and kind of dry. The bananas were not carmelized enough either. There are better buttermilk pancake recipes out there. This one wasn't worth the effort.

I thought that the pancakes were ok, but not great. Too time consuming with the sliced bananas, would be much easier just to add the bananas to the batter, either chopped up or roughly mashed. I sprinkled walnuts around the bananas. Make sure that you slice the bananas thinner than 1/4 inch that the recipe calls for so the other side of the pancake cook properly. Also the batter was on the thin side.

This is my favorite pancake recipe. Made it for brunch for company and they raved about it. I call it Bananas Foster in the AM. Great breakfast.

These were excellent buttermilk pancakes! The banana made them a bit sweeter than my husband liked but I loved them.

I have made this twice now and both times with different berries or fruits. Wonderful.

These were pretty good, but I guess I was expecting more caramelized flavor from the bananas. All in all, a decent pancake.
