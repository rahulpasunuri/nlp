aged balsamic vinegar is best superfine sugar is a wonderful ingredient to have on hand (particularly in berry recipes) and speeds things along

This is delicious! The key is to use a GOOD balsamic vinegar. I used a higher-end balsamic, and the results were sublime.

This was fabulous!!! It was the highlight of the entire meal. The balsamic vinegar with sugar and strawberries sounds disastrous, but it was truly a sensation! I got rave reviews from my guests who said that they felt like they were dining in a gourmet restaurant! The sugared pine nuts were a perfect touch. A light and refreshing dessert!

very good desert, be sure to melt the sugar over low heat so as not to burn it. Tyhe longer the strawberies marinate the better it seems to taste !

This is an outstanding dessert. The combination of sour and sweet flavors, soft and crunchy textures is the best. This is a very elegant dessert!! I serve this often at the conclusion of a Northern Italian dinner.

Excellent!! I added butter to the sugar and pine nuts so the sugar would melt easier.
