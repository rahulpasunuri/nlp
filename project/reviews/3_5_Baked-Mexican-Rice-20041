Substituted fresh mushrooms and cubed chicken breast. Might cut back on the chili powder.

Good side dish for any mexican meal. I omitted the meat and used fresh crimini mushrooms, and a bit more garlic - for the stock I used beef stock. I also added fresh chopped cilantro. Next time I would use less oil, I found it slightly greasy - but still quite good!

Just too easy for words - this time I used chicken chorizo from Trader Joe's, left out 'shrooms, added black beans and roasted corn (frozen from Trader Joe's), used queso fresca - went perfectly with the Mexican Meatball soup on this site (I left rice out of soup) - perfect for a large crowd!

I have been using Epicurious for years and I figured it about time I rated one. Four forks for ease: If I could I would give it more for taste, based on how simple it was and how I can never seem to get rice right! I sauted half a large onion and a couple of garlic cloves as printed. I did not use any meat. I used one can of swansens beef broth which I think flavored it very well. I did not add any extra salt. I also used fresh chopped mushrooms when I was sauting the rice. Added chili powder and pepper also while sauting rice . Warmed up the stock and also added about half a cup of water. Put the pot in the oven and took it out 30 minutes later , added half cup of parmesan, which I think is important for flavor, and let it sit for 10 minutes + Was so very tasty, almost tasted like wild rice, it was dark too, because of the broth I assume. Dry and fluffy and very tasty for little effort!

3+, because this is so easy and so tasty. Don't substitute -- use 1/2 lb. fresh ground chorizo. But add away: black beans, fresh cilantro, corn, etc. This (doubled) was a hit at our World Cup pot luck today ... with 11-year-old boys AND parents.

Like the others, I took many liberties with the recipe, but it was delicious! Substituted ground sirloin & green bell pepper for sausage & mushrooms. Also added some tomato juice with the chicken stock. It was wonderful, but my 89 year old mother kept calling it meat loaf! She still tells me that growing up in San Antonio she remembers her mother's spanish rice as the best she has ever had.

This is really good, although I omitted the chorizo sausage....too greasy, and subsituted turkey italian sausage. Had it with shrimp enchiladas and gor rave reviews.

This really was good. I did use less than a 1/3 oil, probably more like 1 & 1/2 tblsp. Also, I think this recipe calls for the chorizo that is not raw, meaing like the way italian sausage is raw in a skin lining. I had some chorizo that my butcher told me was dried, similar to Eckridge Farm sausage. The recipe calls for "sliced" chroizo, which would not be possible with the "raw" kind in the skin. Anyway, this kind of chorizo is less fatty, therefore didn't make the dish as greasy. I also tossed fresh sliced mushrooms in when I sauted the onions and garlic and it turned out fantastic. The recipe is easy and really wonderful. I used a little over 2 cups of chicken stock and that worked very well. Served with verde pork enchiladas (from this site)...rave reviews!!

I'm one of those reviewers. I 'm rating it based on the version I made and not as written. I didn't have sausage or mushrooms. I added 8 oz tomato sauce, some frozen corn and chopped roasted green chiles. My changes required much more stock and longer cooking time but it was worth it. It's going to be the staple now for all our mexican meals. It made more than 4 servings so I stored the rest in the freezer for future use.

absolutely the best rice dish we have ever had. I did make a few changes - I omitted the mushrooms and chili powder. I added fresh chopped cilantro and I sauteed the chorizo before adding. What a dish!!

We eat this all the time in the winter. I use fresh mushrooms instead of jarred, and usually red onions andouille sausage. I also add green peppers and use a mixed mexican blend of shredded cheese instead of the parmesan.

This is so so good! And easy. Instead of parm cheese, I prefer a grated jack for a more authentic taste. Perfect for Mexican night at home!

I made this dish with soyrizo, which is made with soy beans, in lieu of chorizo. It was delicious

I'm not a big fan of sausage, so I cook lean ground beef in some taco seasoning, and then add that to the rice just before baking. It comes out fantastic and is a great main dish.

This was the HIT of our fiesta night. We used chorizo and just cut it open and crumbled it into the rice uncooked. The ground chorizo mixed up into the rice for an unbelievable flavor. The best rice I've had!

smoked turkey sausage? Disgusting!

very good flavors. Even as left overs. Think it remains moist when re-heated due to the amount of olive oil. Cooked sausage separately as suggested.

Yes, it is not mexican by far, however it is still a good recipe. I nixed the sausage and added 3/4 c. of corn.

This is a great dish not too hard to make and just throw together and leave. The taste is out of this world even my pickie mexican boyfriend liked it.

I thought this was a pretty tasty recipe. I cooked the chorizo, mushrooms etc... first however. I also added some diced jalapeno peppers. It's a pretty flexible dish and it doesn't take ages to make.

I made this rice twice and to its just ok. Lisen, I like chorizo as much as the next guy but it just sort of gets lost in this rice. I like the idea of frying it before adding 2 rice but I did not trai that idea. Better than fast food mexican rice thats 4 sure.

Rating: 3
Excellent! And I'm not a rice person! I didn't find it too greasy at all and I used a canned version of chorizo that I found at a local "carniceria". I omitted the mushrooms, a generous dash or two of cayenne and topped with fresh chopped cilantro right before serving. Took it to work for a pot luck and got *many* compliments and recipe requests.

This recipe stinks!! "Gosh, I think I will put some chile powder in it and call it Mexican". I think the date on the recipe (1962) is the clue here. I would rather eat Rice-A-Roni.

Delicious! I also omitted the mushrooms. I also fried and ground up the chorizo before adding it to the rice. This one's a keeper!

This is a HIT! I used loose Chorizo and eliminated the mushrooms. I've made this several times, doubled the recipe, stored in flatten plastic bags and freeze for a quick Mexican breakfast served with over-easy eggs on top and garnished with chopped green onions. YUMMMMMM!

This was very easy and tasty. I omitted the sausage and mushrooms, but I included about a cup of frozen peas which brought some color and crunch to the rice. Very good!

I left out the mushrooms and sausage, and instead added some diced raw carrots and a splash of enchilada sauce. It was easy and delicious.

I used no-salt Tomato Sauce as the Cook from Midland, TX suggested in addition to adding Cayenne pepper to give it more kick. I also omitted the mushrooms, added an extra 1/3 cup of rice and an extra 1/2 cup of chicken stock, and cooked this on the stove instead of the oven. Everyone loved it - especially my boyfriend from El Paso, TX!!!

Being so close to the border, access to a wide range of Mexican food (homestyle to up-scale)is close at hand. We find this rice to be comparable to many of the restaurants we enjoy regularly... to the point where we made it a habit of including this rice as a side dish anytime we are having a Mexican-theme dinner with friends!

Rating: 3
Great and easy recipe! I doubled it for a party yesterday and only added 1 jar of mushroom instead of 2 full jars. I also added a packet of seasoning from a box of Mexican Rice from the store. Gave it a little spice. Will make again!

Like all the other reviews said, make sure to cut back on the oil. I should have read their comments first. I left out the mushrooms, used some chicken andoulle sausage I had, and added extra chipolte pepper. I ended up throwing a cooked chicken breast in for the last half of the cooking time, and it was great.

I too browned the chorizo before adding to the rice so it wouldn't be so greasy, as well as cut down on the oil. In response to a recipe for the rice at mexican food restaurants here's mine: Use same rice, stock, onion as this one, 2 garlic cloves, plus also add either half can tomato sauce/chopped tomatoes to pan when browning rice. I cook mine in the microwave from that point in a dish with the stock added along with some cumin and chicken boillon granules instead of salt, at this point you could add corn or maybe chopped chilis. Then microwave for 12 minutes, stir and maybe add more boiling liquid, and cook 3 minutes longer. You might have to play with times and liquid to adjust to your oven, but 15 total is pretty close.

Easy recipe and great side with all types of Mexican dishes. I also cut down on the oil and use garlic sausage instead of chorizo...

This was good, but not roll your eyes in estacy good. I may try cooking it for a few minutes less next time, and adding some plum tomatoes, or maybe sundried. But, it is definintly worth making again.

This is a simple recipe and I made it and was able to forget about it as I prepared the rest of the meal. I used 2 tablespoons of oil and 3/4 tablespoon of chili powder. It went really well with the beef faijtas. Everyone liked it. quick and simple!! i will definitely make this again.

This was OK. I also used less oil and glad I did because I still found it to be somewhat greasy. It was very easy but probably wouldn't make it again.

I used the comments from others and made the recipe with one tablespoon of oil. For a different twist, I added homemade italian sausage and it turned out excellent. I definately recommend this to anyone at any cooking level.

great dish. i didn't use any meat, and i think that's why i didn't have problems w/ greasiness (though i did cut back on the oil just a bit, using approx 1/4 cup). added a diced pepper and used fresh baby bello mushrooms. enjoyed by my guests, even the finicky eater who says she doesn't like mushrooms. (she picked out 2 larger sized pieces, but didn't realize she was still eating some!)

It wasn't the worst meal I've had...or even really close for that matter. The recipe is WAY to greasy. The chili powder was neat, so I put a lot more in.

My husband does not care for Mexican or Spanish rice but he enjoyed this one. I also thought it was excellent. I precooked the italian style chicken sausage and used only a tablespoon of oil.I believe it would have been unpleasantly greasy had I followed directions.

This recipe is great. I partially cooked in a different pan, and drained the fat from the chorizo. I then added it to the onion etc.. I also added fresh mushrooms, instead of bottled.

I found this recipe to be a little too greasy for my taste in rice. However, we did like it. I didn't precook the chorizo. I'm thinking that if I cook it a bit before adding it to bake with the rice that the end result wouldn't be so greasy.
