I wanted a recipe for parsnips that had horseradish and was pleased to find this one! It is excellent as is, but also nice to add chopped parsley and chopped spring onion if you want extra texture (and used milk instead of cream). Really nice change from mashed potatoes.

Easy and delicious. I've been looking for decent recipes for root vegetables for soem time:this is the best one I've found yet. I substituted soy milk, just as one reviewer said. Worked perfectly.

Excellent! I made this tonight with ginger soy marinated sirloin steaks from this site. I used horseradish instead of wasbi. My husband doesn't want plain mashed potatoes ever again. It's the perfect pairing of sweet and spicey.

This is an excellent side dish. I used rutabagas rather than turnips as I prefer the taste. Also used 3 tbsp prepared creamy horseradish rather than fresh grated. Made the Basic Pot Roast also from this site and it was a hearty, savory and oh, so delicious dinner!

This is a great recipe, savory comfort food, yet with a complex flavor. It's gotten rave reviews from friends when I've served it. I find bottled horseradish just as good, and a lot less time consuming. I've also made a vegan (and lower fat) version, substituting margarine for the butter and soy milk for the cream. I didn't notice any difference in flavor-- if anything, the nuttiness of the soy milk worked quite well with the root vegetables.

We thoroughly enjoyed this dish. It is delicious and open to adaptations. I added rutabaga, and frozen peas when the vegetables were finished...nice color compliment. Best part, it is a "forgiving dish" because it can wait until you are ready to serve the rest of the meal.

This dish has great complimentary tastes of sweet and tart. I served it as a side to roast prime rib with good results. It is easy to prepare. The recipe was more than doubled. Yukon Gold potatoes were substituted and a celery root was added. A guest offered to "taste" the dish until the right amount of horseradish was added. I put the mash in a casserole, topped with a little grated hard cheese and put it in the oven until the cheese was bubbly. All the guests were delightfully surprised when they discovered it wasn't just mashed potatoes. 12 people(including 3 small kids)enjoyed the dish. There were no leftovers.
