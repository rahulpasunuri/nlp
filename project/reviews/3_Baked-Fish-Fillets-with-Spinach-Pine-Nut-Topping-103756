This was a pretty good basic recipe, but I listened to the other reviews and made a few adjustments to pump it up. I used a full bunch of green onions (around 5), a shallot, three cloves of crushed garlic and most of a lemon's worth of peel. I sauteed all these in some oil, then put in fresh spinach to wilt. Added most of the lemon's worth of juice and a hint of white wine. Then topped the fish (Haddock fillets) and baked as recommended. It came out GREAT! Would have been perfect over some white rice. Some might have thought that was too much lemon, but we loved it. Flavorful and tender and pretty healthy! Would definitely make again.

Added a bit of dried mustard and a tiny shake of cayenne to up the flavor a bit. Beautiful dish!

Sometimes you just need to get something on the table really quick that is healthy and nutritious and this dish fills that bill very well. If you also want intense or spicy flavor, then look elsewhere.

This is a wonderful light fish recipe. I just added a bit more salt as I used plain spinach. I also splashed some white wine (Albarino) in before baking and dusted the fish with a bit of panko breadcrumbs, but that really wasn't necessary. I used Tilapia and it worked quite well. Great dish! Will make again. Even my picky boyfriend liked it.

Absolutely delicious! I used orange roughy fillets and followed the directions exactly. It was divine. I will definitely make this dish again. Very easy. Tasty!

About as easy as fixing fancy fish dishes can get. Presented extremely well and tasted very good. Served on a bed of fresh spinich with a tomato pasta side dish.

My mom made this for me and I loved it so much I looked it up on this website. Beautiful and tasty. Would go great with tomatoes provencal for a variety of colors on the table. I'm also going to try this with halibut. Great recipe.

Terrible. Pinenut spinach topping would have been good without the fish, but fish didn't go with topping. Cooking time had to be increased too. UGH.

Lots of folks critiqued as bland. Folks: Fish with spinach, okay? I personally think this is very good (with additional garlic) AND I am including this on my Xmas Eve buffet for the fish entree along with Epicurious Beef with Mushrooms and Glazed Onions and Wine and Ham Croquettes along a number of Epicurious side dishes and desserts? This is obviously my favorite recipe website!

Very tasty and quick. We used grouper instead of sea bass. My wife thinks that shredded mozarella added at the last minute would be a good touch.

Has the flavour and punch of a hospital dinner meal

Very easy for weeknight meal. For spinach used creamed versus souffle. At first i thought would be too garlicky, but any less really loses out to more spinach flavor. It's pretty light. Good with mashed potatoes or rice to fill you up.

I tried this recipe because it seemed quick and easy. It was quick and easy but did not taste to good. It was bland and I did not like the combination of flavors. I don't think I would try it again.

Simple to make, but too bland for my taste.

This recipe was easy to make. The flavors were fine. Just not something I liked enough to make again

Great fish recipe for those of us who like something "on" our fish!!! I used creamed spinach since I couldn't find spinach souffle, and I think that added more flavor. (I then skipped the parmesan- it was creamy enough...)

I made a lot of changes . . . I skipped the pinenuts, increased the lemon and cheese and topped with fresh herbed bread crumbs.

Thought it was okay - was a bit bland. I may try it again but will definitely add something to give more flavor.

This recipe is delicious. I altered it by searing the fish then baking it with the topping to seal in the fishes juices. Also, I added a cup of coarsely chopped fresh basil to the topping. Fresh chilean sea bass is perfect for this dish!
