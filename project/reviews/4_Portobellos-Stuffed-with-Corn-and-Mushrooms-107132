Terrific! I omitted the wild mushrooms and cream and it was still great. I only broiled the tops first, then flipped over and filled with corn mixture, then put feta on top and broiled the top for a minute or so. I would definitely serve this as a main course for vegetarians.

We love this recipe! Make sure you slice the stems and additional mushrooms well, I have made them chopped in my food processor as well and hand chopped and I like the finer chop better. We also used olive oil instead of corn oil which worked out fine. I also de-gill my portobellos for stuffing. Overall this is a great recipe, quick and easy to make and very delicious!

Would make it over and over. Is a great dish for a food tasting...1st course. Would also only broil one side and for a shorter period of time or on low broil. Have also used it as the mail course for the vegens in my group!

Great side dish! The only step I may not do next time is broiling both sides of the portobellos. Mine shrunk up and weren't deep enough for the quantity of filling. It still worked out and the presentation was still great. I didn't use the portobello stems. Also, it doesn't tell you to scoop out the dark gills but I did. You can use any favorite cheese with this recipe. I accidently put all the herbs into the oil and that was okay. I would not reduce the amount of oil. I used olive oil.

This recipe was awesome. I also agree with the other folks that the stuffing was great alone! I would definately cut back on some of the oil, I used monterrey jack cheese and the mushrooms and stuffing were to melt in your mouth great!!

Since I fixed this for a weeknight dinner, I settled for dried herbs - fresh would definately be better. Despite that this recipe is a keeper! I splashed some sauvignon blanc into the saute and added some onion and red pepper as well. Will definately make again - for guests.

You can't lose with this one! Fresh ingredients is the key.

I made this as a first course at a Wine Pairing Potluck last night and it was fantastic! A perfect light starter in loo of a salad, I do suggest a Sav Blanc instead of a Chardonnay to accompany the dish. I made it ahead of time and it held up great - quick and easy! Everyone asked for the recipe - which is always a good sign in my book.

This was great - everyone asked for the recipe. Maybe the best part was using some of the leftover filling for omletes the next morning!

I loved these portobellos! Mine had a lot thicker, creamier sauce than the picture in BA, but I liked it that way. I guess I added a little too much cream. Regardless, I will definitely make them again.

this is an awesome appetizer (mini-entree) to make for friends on any occasion... i've made this recipe twice now (my brother first turned me on to it), and it stands out as one of my all-time favorites... i wouldn't alter a thing...

Wow. These are AMAZING. Even my boyfriend who's not a mushroom fan devoured these and requested I make them again. Very rich w/ all of that oil and cream, though, so save these for the occasional splurge. My portobellas were on the small side and shrunk even more after broiling, so there was a lot of leftover filling. We ended up eating the filling on its own as a side, and that was great, too! The extra filling probably would've been tasty on brown rice, quinoa or some other whole grain. . . I had a lot of extra liquid when cooking the mushrooms in the skillet, but once you pile them on the caps (w/o all the extra liquid) and broil them, they turn out fantastic. I'll definitely make these again (and not just b/c my boyfriend requested it!).

An absolute hit of a dinner party! It is spicy but wonderful texture and flavors and looks so appealing as well!

I used feta cheese and it turned out great! Yes, it is rich, though. (Fine as a main course) Also, I did not chop the ingredients finely, but coarsely. As luck would have it, my broiler died so I had to use a toaster oven. It slowed the process, but did not impact the dish at all. Definitetly ** THE BEST ** mushroom dish yet. I also used frozen corn and had no problems. It's a MUST MAKE!!!!

San Francisco - Try "Stuffed Marinated Portabella Mushrooms" on this website. If you are vegetarian, omitting the prosciutto did not negatively affect the outcome (in my opinion). Cheers!

Excellent appetizer or vegetarian meal. Our gourmet group of eight loved it. Easy to make and can be made ahead. I had leftover filling and made some more the next day.

Something is missing - no zing! Tasted kind of watery. I served it w/ brown rice and my plate was half full at the end of dinner. Just wondering if anyone has any better stuffed portobello recipies to recommend?

One of the best recipes out there! I have made this several times and it never gets anything but rave reviews. The crunchiness of the corn is a great combination with the mushrooms. I forgot to sprinkle them with the extra herbs to finish and it really didn't matter - it was still delicious!

Best mushroom dish yet! I cut the recipe way down because I was eating alone, but couldn't help adding extra "goodies" like chives. Nearly doubled the proportion of corn and feta. Prep & cooking took less time than expected. I had wild rice, polenta & salad on the side. Mmmmm yum.

I made this twice - it was more delicious the first time than the second. The mistake I made second time was adding too much whipping cream, which diluted the herbs and cheese, and halved the flavor. Do not add enough cream to make a broth!! (plus, I thought it needed more herbs than called for). Morrels were in season, so I used fresh ones, which was magical. Lastly, I recommend that you stir in the corn kernels only SECONDS before serving. Otherwise they soak up the mushroom juice and turn the unappealing brownish color of canned corn. At the same time as adding the corn, I stirred in coarse chopped arugula. It was stunning.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone liked it. I would *not* cut back on the oil -- most of the oil gets brushed on the caps, which need it to stay moist under the broiler. One thing to note: I found that while broiling the caps empty, the first 1/2 (with cap up) took 5 minutes as instructed, but the second part (flipped over) took significantly less time -- 2-3 minutes. I used fresh corn and it was lovely, but I expect frozen would have been just fine as well.

The filling is really good - I just used canned corn, but still turned out great!

Very good but, way too much oil. It was almost slimey. I made the FILLING only and basically halfed it. Used only 2 1/2 table oil total and half of the other ingredients. Next time will reduce to 1 table. Also the corn to mushroom ratio was off - I forgot to account for the portabello stems in the filling so would use 12 oz rather than 8 oz mushrooms

I really liked this recipe, even if it did take quite a while to prepare. I thought you could easily leave out the cream to make it much lower-fat and just as tasty. I topped it with toasted pine nuts for a little crunch.

Amazing! I made this last night as a side dish to a light fish dinner, but it would certainly work as a main dish when made with larger portobellos. I used frozen corn instead of fresh, regular balsamic vinigar instead of white, and vitamin D milk instead of cream. Although I can't compare my results to the results I would've gotten with the listed ingrediants, it was an absolute delight with the adjustments.

Made this last night along with Warm Goat Cheese Salad with Pears and Walnuts for a vegetarian dinner, and even my meat-addicted fiance loved it! Didn't have white balsamic vinegar so I used regular balsamic instead. For mushroom lovers, this dish is pure heaven.

I made this when the issue was new and it was wonderful, rich, satisfying, and great presentation. I am doing a report on corn for my culinary class and will use this as my demo recipe. I'm happy to see everyone enjoyed it that tried it. I hope my class will too!!!! sal\cook,Sleepy Hollow

It doesn't get much better than this! If it had, I might have fainted!! Served this with a crusty ciabatta and had this as a main course. Just fantastic!!

Remarkably fun and delicious! Served to three women friends who themselves, are very experienced and fairly critical cooks. They absolutely loved it. I have been hearing about it for days!!! The corn seemed like a strange ingredient, but it absolutely MADE IT!!! I used frozen corn and it didn't seem to have a negative impact on the texture at all. Also used regular balsamic instead of white balsamic. Served as a main course in a vegatarian dinner with the lemon-poppyseed pasta from this site and a green salad with goat cheese, pecans, dried cranberries and pears. I did make the mushrooms several hours in advance, them broiled them just before serving. Accidentally forgot the fresh herbs that go on top - not a problem!!!

I served this dish as the appetizer course on Thanksgiving to my in-laws. Everyone repeatedly complemented me literally between mouthfuls. I have had to promise to make this again. This dish is delicious as is and for a change I served it to my hubby using goat cheese and it was different but just as good.

This was excellent. Definitely rich, but the corn added just the right amount of sweetness and contrast. We enjoyed the stuffing so much that I would serve it again as a side dish, if I didn't have portobellos.

All my guests and I loved this recipe. I did cut back on the oil, though. I served it as a sidedish because we had a couple vegetarians at the table. I premade them as chilled them before broiling and that worked great. Everything was done at just the right time. Everyone asked for the recipe. A definite do-again.

This was a great and easy dish. I did not have fresh herbs so I used dried. I used half the recomended measurements in the herbs(as dried herbs are more potent in flavor). Will make again.

The fresh herbs overpowered the other flavors. There was a lot of extra liquid in the bottom of the pan as well that made the mushrooms fall apart. If I try this again I'll halve the herbs or use dried.
