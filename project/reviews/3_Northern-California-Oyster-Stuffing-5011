This was excellent!!! I used Fresh spinach, and dried tarragon, cut the bread into 1/2" to 3/4" squares I used 3-8 ounce mini boules sour dough, so a pound and 1/2 half of sour dough bread. 1 can of very well known name brand chicken broth. a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of pepper. Also I cooked a bit longer 1 hour, then remove foil and 20 minutes without foil on top. So, the ones here not raving about the recipe, must have done something wrong, or their just not oyster stuffing fans.

I found this recipe years ago and it is a huge hit every Christmas

My mom and I made this stuffing the first year the recipe was published and everyone loved it! I'm not a big oyster fan, but this came out delicious. In fact, we've made it at Christmas or Thanksgiving almost every year since (if we don't, we get complaints!) We have baked it inside the turkey and in a dish and both have come out well for us (although the texture is different). I'm sure we'll be making this again this year!

I followed the recipe and read the suggestions but I must say, this turned out terribly. In the end, it tasted like soggy sourdough. I love sourdough and oysters but this recipe was a waste of money I felt.

Maybe it's because I didn't know what I was doing but this was a disaster for me! Turned out very dry (directions for how much bread to use could be more specific)—anyway, next year, for Thanksgiving, I'll be using Stovetop®.

Wonderful! The sourdough cut larger than the "package" bread cubes made a large difference in the texture. It is now a regular dish for the holidays!

I was surprised so many would not make this again. I stuffed my turkey w/this and toasted hazelnut and sausage stuffing(at different ends) last year and when I suggested to my large family that we do a different thing- it started a war.

We adore oyster stuffing and were looking for some fresh changes. This recipie was wonderful! the spinach and sourdough brighten the flavor and complement the oysters beautifully. will definitely make it again!

This recipe wasn't all that bad, but... The spinach with the oysters gave this dish a slight muddy taste. Also, I'd suggest cutting the bread pieces a little smaller than 1 inch cubes. One last note: I wouldn't substitute a sourdough round for the loaf. The rounds are more dense giving you less bread and the crust is thicker making the stuffing tough.

absolutely sublime! I've never made oyster stuffing so I was eager to try this recipe. As Sara Moulton would say...wow!!the sourdough, tarragon and oysters really sing. One great thing about this recipe is that there is really not alot of butter in it. Made a cranberry Grand Marnier sauce also from the recipe file. Easy and delicious!!

Although I am not a fan of oysters, being from New England I should be! My husband asked me to make it, he grew up on oyster stuffing drowned in butter and mixed with ritz crackers. This one is soooo much better and tastier even I ate it. Have made it a traditional Thanksgiving side dish Delicious!

This has become a Thanksgiving favorite at our house. I had never made oyster stuffing before, but this one sounded so good, with the addition of sourdough bread and spinach, that I couldn't pass it up. It's fantastic.
