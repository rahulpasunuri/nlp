I made this for a x-mas party and everyone loved it. It truley does look like a plate of jewels. I served it on a glass cake stand and it made the fruit shine even more! The strawberries are to die for. I will most certainly make this again! Make sure that you place it in a very cool place until you are ready to serve it.
