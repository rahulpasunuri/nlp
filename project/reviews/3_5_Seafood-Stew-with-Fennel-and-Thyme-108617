Added in 1/2 lb shrimp as other reviewer suggested - great idea. Accidentally used a sweeter white wine and dish was still extraordinary. Definitely a show-stopper but a bit of work.

OMG, show-stopper. jaw-dropper. made as directed except: added a few shrimp to the mix, and used herbs du provence instead of straight thyme. Served with a loaf of warm, crusty sourdough, mixed greens with a blueberry viniegrette, and a grand cru chablis. OMG. Will definitely make this again.

Delicious! Elegant and tasty but easy to make and not too "fancy." I used monkfish in place of halibut and one large scallop per person, and served with homemade bread and an endive & pear salad. We did a Normady dinner, starting with sparkling cider & Normandy cheeses, and ending with apple tart & Calvados. Fun and easy dinner party.

I made this recipe for some friends and family and they absolutely loved it!! I skipped the creme fraiche and just used the cream and a little bit of roux. I also added shrimp and clams to the recipe and it came out great!!

Excellent soup. I followed the recipe exactly but did substitute fat free, plain yogurt for the cream to make it a little healthier and it turned out fantastic! Served with fresh bread and a simple salad of greens, grapes, goat cheese and candied pecans. Everyone raved.

I'd give this 3 and a half forks if I could. Really delicious. Somewhat time consuming though. I didn't use the scallops (had planned a scallop dinner for the following night) and used monkfish instead of halibut (all I could find). It was as if some wonderful French granny had come to make some stylish comfort food.

We really love this. I've made it 3 times, and it has been well received by everyone who has had it. I didn't use the cream because I didn't think it needed it, as long as the seafood was very fresh. On one occasion I made my own stock, but I have used just the clam juice as well. Twice I left out the mussels because it was easier without it. A versatile, delicious recipe.

a lovely rich thick stew; good with sea bass as well as halibut; served with the suggested salad; I think the chardonnay is better than the chablis--the chardonnay because the stew is rich and the fuller more feminine chardonnay holds up to it well, the chablis if you like the green flinty quality to compliment the seafood and cut the richness a bit; crusty French whole grain or country bread and Provencale butter. this may be a little crazy, but I served cheese and port after -- a very warming, satisfying meal

I made this recipe for just my husband and myself, and decided it was worthy of company fare. We were correct...it was outstanding!!!

I made this soup to freeze. I made did everything but add the seafood before freezing. It re-cooks very well and gets raves. I also added just a bit of tabasco for a kick.

I've recently had a delicious seafood stew with fennel in Stockholm and while wondering how it could be made, found this one which looks quite similar. Planning to make it on the weekend for some guests, I wonder if i could prepare it a few hours beforehand and reheat before serving?

This is one of the best seafood stews I (and my guests) have had. I did change some things: lowered the amount of onions and cooked them a lot longer than suggested (this mellows them out more), I added shrimp, both whole ones and about a cup that I had pureed in the cuisinart, and I used cream instead of creme fraiche. I agree that using bigger pieces of halibut is better.

To much work for what it was. The flavours were great and so was the sauce. Definately don't add potatoes, it would become too thick. Also, be sure to serve it right away. also, make sure the halibut is cut in large chunks. I would have added more mussels too.

My husband and I really liked this stew. I followed much of the previous reviewers' advice, with great results: reduced the onions and added a little more fennel, reduced the halibut and added red potatoes. Also, I sauteed the scallops on high heat with some butter before adding to stew--great flavor. Finally, a die-hard Sara Moulton (Cooking Live) trick: I added salt and pepper to taste throughout the process instead of just at the end.

Very good, however, the next time I make it I would also add some shrimp (large ones) and maybe also some lobster pieces. Also, be sure to serve some lemon wedges so that guests can squeeze extra fresh lemon juice into their portion just before eating. Yummy!

Although my guests loved this soup, I thought that the stew was overpowered by onion and leek. The creme fraiche complimented the fresh seafood beautifully. If I made it again I would cut the amount of leek and onion in half but keep the fennel and maybe add some potatoes.
