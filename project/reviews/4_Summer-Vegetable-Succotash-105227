This would have been bland and dry if i had not tweaked the recipe. I used sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes, and butternut squash. I also added zucchini, fresh jalenenos, garlic and basil. After sautéing the onion, chives, corn, squash, zucchini mixture for a minute or so, I added a splash of dry white wine and then a mixture of 1/2c chicken broth with about a clove of garlic. Then added the edamame with the jalepeno. Like another reviewer, I added the potatoes back in at the end, mixed it all together before serving. I also ended up adding a little more broth to each bowl. It was delicious. I topped the succotash with another recipe from Epi, "Fish fillets w tomato, squash, and basil" That recipe is also a little bland so I used chili flavored olive oil and added garlic. All in all, it was time consuming but worth it!

Excellent side dish, I served with roasted salmon. Could not find pattypan at Whole Foods so I used 1 zucchini. I cut the butter/oil in half, and added 1 roasted hatch green chile (peeled and diced) at the same time as the edamame. I threw the potatoes, onion and chives back into the skillet with the other veggies & tossed to combine, to keep it hot for serving.

I had high expectations based on the reviews for this recipe. Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed. It seemed to be lacking some punch...basil, perhaps?

This is just great all around! We've made it several times this summer, and even my baby(15mo) loves gobbling it up!

Totally, unexpectedly delish! Trader Joes has the frozen shelled edamame... makes it so much easier! everyone loved it, we will make it at least a few more times each week this summer. Used yellow squash, since it was what came in my CSA this week...

totally tasty. I used frozen corn (half cooked before dropping into the butter in this recipe) and a yellow summer squash because I couldn't find a pattypan this time of year. I also cut down on the butter when I got to stage 2 of the veggie cooking (corn & squash) and my husband still raved about it.

when I first prepared this, I was not sure I was going to like it. It was delicious. My whole family liked it. This will become a regular.

This is about the best summer side dish ever! We make it on average every two weeks all summer long. It's fresh, healthy and tasty.

Delicious and a little different. Definitely use the edamame. I pan-roasted the corn for a little more flavor.

Very good, and even better the next day. I added a chopped jalapeno for a little extra kick but did everything else according to directions. I will continue to make this as my squash plants produce more and more over the summer...

I cooked this dish last minute for a party i was throwing. People seemed to like it. My roommate loved it so much, he had it every day for lunch, so i never got to taste it. It was fairly easy to make, though. Loved using edamame.

My whole family loved this (including my two finicky toddlers!). I added a little bit of bacon. I didn't know what pattypan squash was, so I used baby summer squash.

Loved everything about this recipe. It was really delicious. We especially liked the soy beans. Would not change a thing in the recipe.

I doubled this recipe for a summer party and everyone loved it. Many requested the recipe. I cooked it just before going over to the hosts' house; it was 1-1/2 hours before we ate and it held up well. My husband loves it. I usually put the red onion in the pan with the edamame to take the edge off.

Love, love, love this recipe. Okay, I do change it a little, substituting cut green beans for the edamame--just a personal preference. But this really is a delicious way to use all kinds of fresh summer produce and herbs together.

I had to substitute yellow squash because pattypan wasn't available. Still, it was delicious! Everyone loved it and I can't wait to make it again.

A friend who I hadn't seen for sometimejoined forces with me and we prepared the entire menu in the July issue and each dish was better than the last. The vegetable succotash was a special surprise. The fresh corn added the right amount of crunch, the dish was colorful and it was the perfect summer accompaniment to the grilled cornish hens.
