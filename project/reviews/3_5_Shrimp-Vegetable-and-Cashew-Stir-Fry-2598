This is a great recipe-fast, easy and delicous. Looks beautiful on a platter surrounded by rice. I think the cornstarch method is perfect with the shrimp and am wondering if it works with chicken? Mine did clump a little but still looked and tasted great. I added red pepper, onion, and asparagus instead of broccoli. You could use anything you want. Cashews were great in it. I thought the sauce amount was just right for stir fry.

i'm back tweaking up this recipe. i par-boiled the broccolli just a bit as i felt it didn't get done enough as written. i substituted hoisin for the teriyaki just for a change. i sauteed the veggies before doing the shrimp due to cornstarch mixture clumping in the pan and requiring extra cleaning step if shrimp is cooked prior the veggies. Don't skip the cornstarch/egg white marinade with shrimp as it changes the shrimps' texture and is exceptionally delicious prepared that way. all in all a very good recipe.

Easy. Dropping out the shrimp, then adding an onion and thickening with kuzu made a fabulous vegetarian meal served over bifun (rice noodles).

I thought this was a very tasty, simple stir-fry recipe. Instead of using purchased teriyaki sauce, which is too sweet, in my opinion, I made my own using equal parts soy sauce and mirin, and adding a little sugar and cornstarch. I also upped the flavor by adding a couple teaspoons of chili garlic paste to the sauce.

Very good and lots of flavor....my husband loved it so much he was picking from the pan at the end of the meal. So easy to make, which makes it even better! I also added mushrooms but would follow suggestions of other reviewers to add onions, pea pods, etc.

I haven't made this recipe. I want to comment on the batter prep. I used to make a sweet and sour pork recipe that had a similar egg/cornstarch batter. In that prep, I seasoned/dry rubbed the cubed protein ingredient, dipped in the cornstarch/egg, then rolled in seasoned flour or flour/crumbs. The result came out with a lovely crunch and was as flavorful as whatever seasonings were used. The only problem is that the flour/crumbs made the oil really messy, so you need to clean the pan before you add the other ingredients. This may be old news to many of you, or it may be irrelevant to this recipe. I just thought I'd add my two cents worth.

I think the only problem with this recipe is that it tells you to cook the shrimp over med-high heat. The egg/cornstarch mixture won't work if it's not stir-fried as stir-fry was intended... hot pan, ergo high heat.

I also had difficulty with the "batter" falling off and clumping in the pan. Next time I plan to reverse the steps and stir fry the veggies first. However, my hubby declared the shrimp succulent! i also added mushrooms which worked well but found that stir frying was insufficient to get the veggies to the right doneness. I added a bit of chicken stock after stir frying and covered the pan for a few minutes which worked well. Then i added the shrimp, sauce and nuts to the pan.The flavors were excellent.

Will not repeat this as is, but really liked the shrimp preparation and will use it in a different recipe. Made with sugar snap peas in place of broccoli. Sauce was awful! Should have heeded my first instinct when I saw the use of teriyaki in the sauce. It totally overpowered my beautiful butterflied shrimp.

I liked this, but wasn't crazy about it. But I will make it again.

I used catfish chunks, and it was fine. A great all-around Asian stir-fry.

Very tasty. My family loves it. I would not suggest omitting the shrimp/cornstarch step as some suggest. It's very good this way. I did add onions to the vegetable mix. Quick, easy, and delicious!

Per the other cooks, I placed the shrimp in the wok one at a time and cooked in 3 batches. Added about a tablespoon more oil to continue. This is a rave keeper

Made this tonight, for Ash Wednesday and it was very good. Other than the chopping and shrimp cleaning, very quick and easy to cook. I LOVED the shrimp with the cornstarch 'batter', I think it's good enough to eat on it's own, or in other recipes. I also added extra veggies (snow peas, red pepper, onions and mushrooms) and because of that, I tripled the teriyaki/sherry mixture and added a good sized splash of pineapple juice (per previous reviewer suggestion). I wish the gravy had been thicker but very good none-the-less.

Yummy, but don't need the cashews!

There was not enough flavor in this dish-very bland.

This was very good, we made as is, except used more of the liquid measurements for more sauce, and would do that again. Also added some other veggies ... mushrooms, green onions, and snow peas, but many would work there as well. Followed the recipe with the cornstarch part ... it comes out fine, just whisk well before adding the shrimp. Will definitely make again.

Made this last night and loved it! Cooked the vegies first while the shrimp mixture sat on the counter for 20 min. Also, used snow peas, bean sprouts, crimini mushrooms and whole red and yellow peppers and a sweet onion. Substituted mirin, a sweet sake, for the sherry and served over white rice with store bought egg rolls. Yummy,yummy!

My family loves this recipe and I make it every two weeks. The coating for the shrimp is key. don't miss it. Pat the shrimp dry and fry them in small batches. It is a little like tempura. It really adds to the recipe. Try it, you'll like it.

Very good. I had read the reviews beforehand, so knew going in to pat the shrimp dry before dipping in the cornstarch mixture; it came out perfectly. I also added red onion and red peppers which added to both the flavor and the presentation, but left out the cashews as a matter of personal preference. Finally, I used Asian red pepper paste (1 tsp.) instead of flakes and will double to 2 tsp. next time. Same goes for the garlic; it probably needs more zing because of the vegetables I added.

I loved this. Fantastic. I wanted to review this recipe to say that the coating is the best part of this and not to be missed. I had no problem with this by making sure that the shrimp were patted dry. This is key. I'm making this again tonight for supper at my family's request!enjoy!

This was amazing! If you like spicier foods increase the red pepper to taste.

I too had trouble with the egg-white/cornstarch mixture getting clumpy in the pan. I think the dish would be good if I added some pinapple with juice to sweeten the sauce a little.

We thought this was great. I'll admit I did cook the veggies in sesame oil instead of peanut..Definately will make again, and I will make the cornstarch/egg white mixture next time as well. I definately thought it added something.

We enjoyed this recipe! No problem at all with the cornstarch/egg white coating. Really added to the dish. Used sweet red pepper, carrots and red onions for the vegetables.

Delicious! Don't let the bad reviews regarding the corn starch/egg whites fiascos scare you away, I had no problem with it at all and I didn't even have a whisk! I added green and red peppers, sweet onions, the taste was great! And to think I put off making this dish because of some of those reviews....

I made this dish for some unexpected company at the last minute. It was delicious!

We had trouble with this -- the egg white+corn starch was "gunky" and the teriyaki sauce overpowered the vegetables. I'm willing to try again based on reviewers comments and the belief that even "basic" recipes can fail occasionally. I did substitute olive for peanut oil and peanuts for cashews -- and added onion and red pepper. Can't think they'd be the problem though ...

Great super-easy dish! Buy the pre-pealed shrimp and you can make this in 30 minutes. Our two-year-old loved it, and he is a really picky eater. I agree with comments below, too, that this is a great basic recipe that you can experiment with. Definitely a keeper.

I had trouble with the cornstarch/egg white coating. I.e. would not stick. I believe it was caused by the shrimp being too cold (they had thawed in the refrig) and a little water. Next time I'll make sure I pat the shrimp dry. Also, I would suggest putting the shrimp into the pan one or two at a time so the mixture doesn't clump. I added an onion and four shitake mushrooms to the carrots and broccoli. Instead of rice I added cooked spaghetti noodles after I had put the shrimp back in the wok. I also added some chicken bouillon at the end as it seemed dry. After serving, we sprinkled some sesame oil over the noodles and shrimp stir fry.

I disagree and think the cornstarch step is necessary. Good flavors and easy to make. I will make this again.

Excellent. I agree that the corn starch sept is unnecessary. I would salt the shrimp before cooking and salt the vegs. as they cook.

This was so delicious and very versatile! I did use the cornstarch/egg mixture and the shrimp turned out perfectly. I omitted the chili due to an allergy, but it still had plenty of flavor. I also added snow peas and mushrooms. This is a great dish to experiment with different ingredients.

This was very good, but I increased both the garlic and ginger, added snow peas, brocolli and used chicken broth to replace some of the oil. I would skip the cornstarch step next time. I think it would be much "cleaner" tasting. It is a good basic recipe that could go many directions

We love this dish. I went with the advise of A Cook from New York and have never done the cornstarch step. We've had this for dinner almost weekly since we first tried it.

Instead of using fresh ginger, I used 2t. of chopped ginger from the jar. I reduced the amount of corn starch and added another teaspon of the chopped ginger to that mix. It was delicious!

Skip the cornstarch/egg white mixture -- doesn't work very well (just stir-fry the shrimp). However, rest of recipe is easy and delicious.
