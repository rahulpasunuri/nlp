I very much liked this recipe. I did make one modification: I blended the entire concoction, minus the bay leaf. I was using this recipe to serve with a Stilton cheesecake and needed something that was thicker and more evenly spreadable. It was marvelous and leftovers were used with varying cheese plates. It also keep well in the fridge.

This was good. Made some modifications - used 1/2 figs, 1/2 frozen cherries & blueberries. Used zest of one orange added toward end. Used organic apple juice instead of cider. Omitted bay leaves because I couldn't find them in my crammed spice draer. Served as a dessert sauce, wish I had used slightly less pepper. Really luscious! Can't wait to try with cheese. Give this one a go! Good with chocolate!

Scrumptious! This recipe will give your kitchen the most wonderful aroma. Can be used as a sauce for a sweet and savory dinner or as a dessert topping. I served this over pork chops seasoned with white pepper and salt for the a modernized version of the tradition New Years meal with Sauteed Kale, the Pickled Black Peas and corn bread. The combination was lovely as well. This fig compote was also wonderful with turkey. I have made this twice now and made a few adjustments the second time around. I prefer the texture of medium-coarse ground peppercorn to the coarser, simply crushed peppercorn. I also tried finely grated orange zest (used the whole orange) instead of the rind that would later be removed. Either way works well. One tip: Make sure the figs are not too dried out (i.e. they are no good if they look sandy on the inside). The drier ones don't plump as nicely or have a good texture.
