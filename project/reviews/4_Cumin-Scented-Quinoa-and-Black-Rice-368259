Really delicious - makes for a nice, fulsome lunch. Tweaked the recipe a bit: upped the cumin seeds to 3 tsp; upped the garlic; used all of one bunch of cilantro and no parsley; added about 1/2 c. of toasted, coarsely chopped almonds; instead of lemon wedges, served with lime wedges, and hot sriracha sauce. I think the almonds and sriracha sauce were key to jazzing this salad up.

YUM! I made this according to the recipe and loved it! My husband and 2-year old did, as well. I think it would be a wonderful side dish for fish or chicken and am really happy to have another main dish option for vegetarian friends!

Exceptionally delicious! I doubled the cumin and cilantro (maybe more than doubled even!), but I love both those flavors. Also added a bit more lemon juice. The Avocado and/or lemon wedges are not necessary, but definitely adds to the end result. Make a double batch and have quick easy lunches as it is good cold, and reheats well too.

Love this recipe! We make it (or a version) about once a week. We've experimented with various adds/deletes. The steadfast items to make this work, is the cumin and avocado (with or without the rice). We love caramelizing the onions, and often subbing with shallots or leek. Another twist is soaking some dried shiitake mushrooms and using the "broth" to cook the grains. I served as a main for a vegan friend and he said it was the best quinoa he'd ever had, and he eats quinoa a lot!

Excellent! Very tasty!

This was lovely. I did change it slightly to suit my tastes (NO cilantro, more cumin, 2tbs parsley). I would also add more avocado next time. It was enough for two main meals (added a fried egg for the hubby).

I love quinoa and I found this to be fresh and delicious.

We've made this twice now, and loved it both times. Cooked the rice in broth and added red pepper flakes to the broth for a little extra zing. Also increased onion and spices, after reading other comments that the taste was a little bland. It's not bland -- it's subtle.

Yum! Loved this salad....I could not stop sneaking bites. I forgot the avocado and did not have chives, but it was still great. I'll definitely make this one again.

I had this at a dinner party and loved it and the host pointed me to this recipe. This is really yummy and very easy to make! I like to boil the quinoa in extra water, like pasta.

It's definitely better with the avocado. Didn't have one first time I made it. Good for lunches as you can eat cold or warm.

My first time with quinoa and I am a very happy woman. This recipe was easy to prepare and I loved the avocado on the the side. I'm not vegetarian but I preferred this to my steak at the dinner table.

Although this combination of ingredients is unusual and unexpected, the overall result is outstanding. My guests raved about beautiful appearance and flavor.

I really loved this recipe as a healthy base for a larger meal. The only things I changed about the original recipe were the onion size and amount of chives. I used a large onion instead of a small one and tripled the amount of chives. I tasted it several times and it was delicious. To make it into a larger and more nutritionally complete meal, I added lots of black beans and tomatoes. Altogether, it was great, although incredibly filling.

made some changes/additions - didn't add rice - added sauteed mushrooms, sweet potato and spinach - left out olive oil since the butter from the sauteed veggies was enough flavor - added chicken buillon to quinoa cooking water (and left out additional salt) - used ground cumin - left off the chives - added a bit of chopped fresh mint on top Really delicious, healthy and easy meal.

It was a good base but needs fixing because it was kind of bland. More spices and maybe cook the quinoa in broth. Despite 2 forks, I will make it again- as a base recipe - because of the healthy ingredients. I also added canned chickpeas making it heartier for a main course.

This was the dish that everyone loved best at our Thanksgiving feast - omnivore, carnivore, vegan or raw foodie! Everyone wanted the recipe.

Fantastic recipe -vegan friends loved it. Add whatever you like but make it the first time exactly as printed. Great the next day.

I made this exactly as written and it's perfect. If you want to substitute ingredients or just imagine you made it, you have something to say, but not about this recipe.

Excellent dish. I added some crumbled chevre and enjoyed that addition.

This was excellent. The first time I prepared it, I made it as the recipe states. The second time I used white quinoa and added crimini mushrooms when sauteing the onion. Both were delicious but I liked it more with the added mushrooms. It's good hot, room temperature, and cold.

I'm imagining it to be 3 forks and will definitely prepare this recipe. However, the nutritional analysis leaves much to be desired. Please give more detailed protein counts, thanks.

This is a great dish-- sneakily vegan!-- both as a side or main dish. The lemon really makes the dish, so don't skip on that, and the cumin as well. I used black rice and regular quinoa, and it was wonderful. Made it for a potluck dinner-- travels well and keeps well!

This dish was delicious. I made it exactly as specified accept for the avocado at the end. Needs more salt and perhaps cumin. The bay leaf in the Quinoa makes a huge difference in the flavor of the quinoa. Will make this for Thanksgiving for sure.

Ok, I did not have all of the ingredients. And so, I feel a bit reluctant reviewing but it is still good. I used plain quinoa, did not have bay leaves, parsley, chives or cilantro. Am thinking I wounldn't have liked the cilantro anyway. Still tasty.
