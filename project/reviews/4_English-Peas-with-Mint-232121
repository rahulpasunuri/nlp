I loved it although I made a few changes, less onion, used butter, more mint and only enough water to steam the peas very briefly, 1-2 minutes tops.

This is so simple and such a great way to highlight a fantastic fresh crop of peas. It manages to taste buttery and clean at the same time. Great side for lamb.

Very good, light side dish. I didn't have spring onions or mint so I used shallots and thyme and it turned out lovely. Used English peas if you can find them - big, crunchy and taste just like Spring.
