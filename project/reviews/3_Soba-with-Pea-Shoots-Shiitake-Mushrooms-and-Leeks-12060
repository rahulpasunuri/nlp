I added sauteed chicken breast, used fresh soba noodles which I hydrated slightly in vegetable broth, and added sesame oil. I thought it was an excellent fresh dish. I also cut up the pea shoots more than the recipe suggests which worked well.

I liked this alot - I added extra rice vinegar and soy sauce and let the mushrooms cook a little long because I like them soft. When I make it next time I will cut up the pea shoots into smaller pieces before cutting them.

I didn't have any pea sprouts so added in some asparagus tips with the mushrooms which gave it some extra taste and a bit of a bite. Quick and tasty, I shall be making this again!

I love this recipe; I've made it many times; I originally had it in print; I found it on line and added it to my recipe box. I'm surprised at the other negative reactions. I've always followed the directions exactly.

All the ingredients seemed promising, but the result was *too* spare and simple: flavorless and unforgiving of imperfections. The leek-mushroom mixture looked fresh and colorful, but it dulled soon after adding the sauce. I'd recommend removing the vegetables from the heat immediately after adding the scallions, soy sauce, and vinegar. The pea shoots were a bit tough to chew on the first day but better on the second day; I would suggest removing the coarse stems and cutting the bunches of leaves into smaller sprigs. To rescue the flavor, I tried adding mirin (Japanese rice wine) and soy sauce. I might throw in some wasabi to make the remaining leftovers more palatable. It's a shame, because I love all the individual ingredients and have enjoyed cooking them in other combinations.

I'd use fewer pea shoots next time. I felt that the sharp taste overwhelmed the mellowness of the leeks. The dish as a whole is very light and clean; perfect summer eating.

I had to make a few modifications to this recipe, but overall it was very good. I couldn't find pea shoots so I substituted julienned snow peas instead, adding them a couple of minutes after the mushrooms. Also, it was a bit dry so I added additional soy, rice vinegar, and also some sesame oil at the end.
