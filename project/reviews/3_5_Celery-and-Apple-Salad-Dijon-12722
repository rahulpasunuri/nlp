My Bountiful Baskets (bountifulbaskets.org) have had a lot of celery and apples in them lately, due to the seasonal harvest. I made this today for our lunch along with simple thin sliced pork satay on the grill. Incredible flavor! I did it as directed, and it was crunchy, flavorful, and completely a wonderful way to use the celery and apples! I will add this recipe over and over again, we all loved it!

I did everything as the recipe said, but I replaced the apple with a star fruit as I live in a country where they are in abundance. A slightly different flavour, but still a very juicy, crisp, tart fruit. Next time I may replace one of the spoons of mayonnaise with one of low fat yogurt, just to make slightly more slimline!

I discovered this recipe because my local farmers market offered some fabulous looking celery with beautiful leaves and relatively thin stalks with a beautiful deep green color. The resulting salad was a wonderful showcase for really good celery and crisp apples. Note: cut and add the apples at the very last minute so that they don't get brown. Also you might consider just a hint of pressed garlic in the mayonnaise. Anyway, for a small effort you get really great results with this salad!

I make this frequently but cut celery and apple in bite size pieces and use less celery (personal preference), and slightly more sugar to the dressing. This is a very good recipe, quick, easy, with simple ingredients.

Very easy and good; a little different, but good. (I was looking to use up celery, too.) But please, Mount Vernon, if you don't like an ingredient, don't throw off the "make-again ratings" by slamming a recipe that features that ingredient; that doesn't make sense.

Very simple but quite tasty. I used a Jonagold apple and doubled the sugar and vinegar and added an extra tablespoon of mayo. The result was tangy and bright. Best of all, the apples didn't get soggy, so the leftovers were still delicious 2 days later!

Have made this many times since recipe came out in 1993 and it has been well received.

We liked this very much. It was simple and tasted very refreshing. I added toasted walnuts.

I had leftover celery from a vegtable platter, so I made this recipe. I give it a 2 just because I don't love mayonaise-based dressings. My husband liked it though. He thought it was crisp and refreshing - different. Good for using leftover celery.
