It's really very good. I like plain foods; I also like spicy food and garlicky food and bright tomato- flavored food and lots of things. I also like this dish; uh, maybe I prefer "light" flavor or "subtly- flavored" to "bland." Hey, I even used CANNED garbanzos (horrors! Heresy! Sacrilege!! OMG!!!) (run screaming from the room!!!) It still tasted good. Oh, well. That's the wages of not being a picky eater.

Followed recipe exactly. Very bland. I wish I had read the reviews prior to cooking. I have lots of leftovers which I will spice up.

A nice recipe that I'm definitely going to try. Perhaps some cumin and cayenne could kick it up a bit. And garlic and lemon juice might be a good idea.

Made half the recipe. Added cinnamon, a pinch of cayenne, a clove of garlic and golden raisins. Topped off with parsley. Delicious!

Very tasty. I made it to accompany portugese Bacalao. Caveat: I adjusted the recipie a little based on reviews that said it was a little bland. After reading several other saffron rice recipies on the site, I decided to add some pine nuts, fresh lemon juice and fresh parsley. These complemented the saffron, peas, and chickpeas with a really nice fresh brightness.

This dish was very bland.

This recipe is very good. I added the Garbanzo beans with the broth, salt and saffron. They taste better if they cook with the rice.

I really like this recipe. I even bought a ten lb bag of basmati rice so I can make it all the time. For my next chicken broth I'm going to crack open the bones and put the marrow in the broth to make it richer (sorry vegetarians). I agree with leaving out the garbonzos. I prefer fresh and they're only found germinated at some health food stores. If I germinated them myself I couldn't miss one day of washing and rotating or they'd go bad. Would fresh curry leaves go with this?

This was a great recipe. I did adjust it a bit--left out the garbanzos, used 3/4 teaspoon saffron, and subsituted vegetarian stock for the chicken stock. Everyone loved it.

I liked this rice and so did my family. One problem though-- I thought I had garbanzo beans and found out at the last minute I didn't, so I left them out. The flavor of the rice is very good and the saffron gives it a wonderful color. Next time I make it I'll make sure I have the beans!

My family really enjoyed this, even my 1 and 3 yr. olds. Next time, I will add a little more saffron, otherwise very good. Left over, we ate it cold like a salad. Yum!

A good dish and easy to prepare. Keep in the chickpeas.

This was good, but much preferred the saffron cardamom rice recipe on this web site. I made exactly to recipe but will substitute the garbanzos for something else next time.

Great dish - not an ounce of leftovers. Simple and delicious, a definite make again.

I had some asparagus in the fridge and the recipe sounded like shrimp should be in it so I added it along with the asparagus. It was really good!

I too left out the garbanzo beans and just used peas. I also substituted saffron powder for the threads with excellent results. This rice is a great accompaniment to the Coconut Curry Marinade.

I just needed a simple rice side, so I left out the peas and chickpeas, and it was great, a big hit! Next time, I'll put the peas and chickpeas in and have it for an easy night-home main dish.

we've made this twice, and find it quite tasty.

Somewhat bland, and the garbanzos are a bit much with the rice. I substituted a little shredded carrot for the chick peas and added a dash of cinnamon and pepper, plus a touch of garlic to give more flavor.
