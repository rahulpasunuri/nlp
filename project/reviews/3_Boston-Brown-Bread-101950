This bread was so easy to assemble, nutritious and tasty. I have made this on several occasions and everyone who tasted it raved about how good it was. I cooked this bread in a crock pot in the summer time so my kitchen will stay cool. The bread makes a great accompaniment to a traditional New England dinner.

My mom makes this in her slow-cooker. Cooking times will vary widely -- test after 4 hrs.

This is a delicious bread. Easy to prepare. The flavor and texture are great. The flavor of the molasses is just right and the corn meal adds body to the texture. I will make it again.
