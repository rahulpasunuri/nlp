Fish sauce is a sauce commonly used on fish, not a sauce made out of fish. Plenty of vegetarian versions available. This is a great recipe

I agree with prior reviewer that this is easy and tasty, but if you save any of it, the smell becomes incredibly overpowering. It must have something to do with the broccoli and daikon exuding some gases when combined and kept overnight. So, eat it all on the same day.

Very very good. I didn't have chili garlic sauce - just chili sauce. So i added a couple small pressed cloves of garlic.

I thought it was tasty and very easy to prepare, but am not going to make it for lunch again because my office-mates took offense to the aroma--they said it smelled like, "hot garbage."

Excellent! The dressing is what makes this great! Took the leftovers on our flight the next day, and is was still excellent!

As previous reviewer stated...this makes a LOT of slaw. It was very tasty at first, but you can't let a batch of this sit for long. Something in it's makeup, makes it bitter after about 2 hours in the fridge. Make it fresh, eat it right away, bin any leftovers. Unless you're prepping for in immediate large gathering, I'd suggest either halving this recipe, or finding another way to use the ingredients on hand.

Maybe I'm missing something, but I really disliked this salad. I made it according to the recipe (except the chili oil, didn't have any so I added red pepper flakes and a bit of canola). The results were not good, so then I tried adding an apple, as suggested by another reviewer. Still no good. Even my garbage disposal-never let anything go to waste-eats other peoples' leftovers boyfriend didn't finish this (it made a LOT). The slaw was really bitter and several 'foodie' friends who tasted it couldn't come up with any way to salvage it.

This was a tasty and refreshing salad. I added some chopped, fresh coriander to mine, which was very tasty. I did make it using the original seasonings (including chili garlic sauce), which I thought were spot on. It is not too spicy, but the garlic sauce gives this salad a nice kick.

This recipe is a nice vinegar-based slaw that stands up well with liberal veggie substitution. Fresh ginger, rice vinegar, chili sauce, and sesame oil are key- I wouldn't mess with that part too much. The veggies that ended up in my slaw were: purple kholrabi (related to broccoli- very much like broccoli stem), red carrot and radish. Being in a CSA, I am always challenged trying to find ways to use whatever I happen to get each week. This slaw was really great for me!

Very nice and light! I too cut back on the daikon a little. The apple sounds good. I'll have to try that next time. Curious what the difference is between using regular rice vinegar and seasoned rice vinegar?

I found the green onion incredibly over powering breath wise and will definitely use a smaller amount next time. The vegetable combination was light and refreshing, a great alternative to mayo-based slaw (I used Goddess dressing)

Tasty, though next time I will skip the hot sauce. I don't think it's necessary. Tangy and crisp when fresh, though it didn't hold up very well past a day.

I made this the original way (great) and the altered way (great). The altered way used half the amount of daikon, used cauliflower (chopped) instead of broccoli, used 2 green onions instead of 1 cup, added one chopped apple (Gala), and added 3 T. sugar. Both ways were incredibly good.
