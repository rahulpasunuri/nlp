I added carmelized onions to the sandwich and a pinch of cayenne pepper to the cheese sauce. I also used 2% milk - gotta remember to keep stirring or a film develops. Served with a frissee sandwich and Alta Luna Pinot Grigio.

Made exactly as written. This was incredibly delicious!!! I was nervous about the fried egg (sometimes they creep me out) but it is absolutely essential to the dish. Served with green salad and vinaigrette. Good enough for company, but not fancy.

Amazingly good. I thought I didn't care for Croque-Madame's much until I tried this recipe. It's extremely rich, leaving you with a brick-filled tummy, but I don't care, I eat every last crumb. Don't skip out on the Dijon, it adds a really nice flavor.

Looking for something special for Easter Brunch--liked the reviews and gave it a whirl. It was good, but definitely not exceptional. Way too rich for our palate. The only substitution made was using whole wheat bread--followed everything else to a tee. Too many other good ones out there more deserving of 4 forks. I am glad I tried it, but once was enough in my humble opinion.

This sandwich is great, I mixed a bit of mayo with the dijon mustard to smear inside bread then served after I broiled the sauce on the sandwich. I did not add the egg, we were having for dinner with a cup of homemade soup. It was perfect and sooooo good.

Sinfully good. Better than any croque madame I had in Paris. Definitely heavy, and not for eating all the time, but so delicious.

This recipe was so-so for me. Not exceptional, but not horrible either. Having eaten in a French bistro nearly everyday and enjoying many croque-Madames, there is something this recipe is lacking.

VERY RICH and decadent. This is a sophisticated brunch item but KID FRIENDLY as well. My eleven and twelve year old keep asking for it but alas the calorie count makes it for special occasions only.

Very tasty. A little on the rich, heavy side, of course.

OMG! If you have never had one of these and you want something special Dash to your store right now and get the ingredients to make this fabulous sandwich! You will not regret it. I used 1% milk instead of whole, and whole grain bread because that is what i had. Don't forget your nutmeg! Excellet.

OMG this recipe was divine. I was looking for a good recipe because this month's issue of Texas Monthly Magazine features great places to find cheap food, and one of the places is in Austin called Chez Nous. There's a pic on the front page and on the front of the feature of this awesome looking croque madame and I've been craving it since the article came out: http://www.texasmonthly.com/preview/2009-04-01/feature I have to say, this recipe is tops. And yes, the nutmeg added to the bechamel is just fantastic. Can't say enough good things and I will definitely make this again.

This is a winner, and it takes me back to France everytime.

Delicious! And not as difficult as the recipe makes it out to be. I didn't have gruyere (subbed cheddar + mozz), nutmeg, and used a wheaty bread, and it was still tasty. Though I think it must have had at least a million calories. Be sure to watch the broiler carefully, or you will be very sad.

OMG! This was so good. I made this last night and used French Ham and Brioche. Served with a simple salad of Baby Romaine and a light Dijon dressing. To die for. We love Breakfast for dinner and this was over the top! Very rich so we will probably only have this once a month or so.

This is a fantastic recipe for a truly decadent breakfast. I cooked it for my boyfriend because he likes to have Moons Over My Hammy at Denny's for dinner and I thought it would be nice to step it up a notch towards gourmet. It was. He loved it so much that he hurt himself trying to finish a second one. They are indeed the tastiest little heart attacks on plates. Men seem to slobber at the idea of this--he was bragging to his friends about his delicious meal at the bar later on.

I recently printed this recipe for my girlfriend, and she made this for me for breakfast on my birthday, it was amazing...will have again in the near future. For me, there need be no changes for the recipe.

Really delicious, and not as much work as I'd thought. The sauce cooks quickly. Very rich and delicious. Who needs to go out and spend a lot on brunch? Tastes absolutely authentic!

This was SO good! It's a little bit time consuming for the average brunch, but incredibly tasty, perfect for weekends. It had great spice from the mustard and great texture from the sauce. Yum!

yeah - so this is really easy - it's really good. What more can I say?

Unique and tasty. The only thing I might do next time is give the sauce more heat and make more sauce, saving some (warmed) to pour over the finished product.

Delicious- makes me glad to be a subscriber to gourmet- instead of hot sauce as hell's kitchen suggests, I use a bit of cayenne pepper. Same effect, though

Hello! Like Nutmeg goes really well with bechemel and gruyere. Like everyone knows that. Whatever! A roasted garlic clove and a dash of hot sauce added to the Bechemel would make it really fun. Would I make it again.........Heck Yes!

A rich, filling meal. Was a little skeptical about the nutmeg but it really blended well with the gruyere. A good, quick meal on a cool night.
