The description of this recipe says they would go well with tea, which they do, but it also says they are savory, which they are not, in my opinion. They are wonderful freshly baked and have a delicate sweetness. Not as tasty leftover. Because of the description, I believed they could be served with dinner, but they are more of a cookie, almost shortbread-like, better suited for a snack.
