Ugh! This gets a no-fork rating. In my opinion, this recipe showcases a horrible combination of flavors--while also managing to be entirely bland.

My husband and I really enjoyed this pasta dish as a side for some roasted chicken. I made some changes and added some canned diced tomatoes and fresh mushrooms, then used fresh taragon and it was really just lovely. I'm making it again to serve with salmon tomorrow night.

This is quick and easy and is also a perfect jumping off point for something more. As long as you let the sauce simmer the full eight minutes, the vodka flavor isn't overwhelming, just light. I used dried herbs and whole wheat spaghetti.

I was rather disapointed in this dish, I foound it to be rather bland.

I made this according to the recipe with dried herbs, making sure to give the vodka a little extra time to simmer (as someone recommended) and it was great. Easy, different from the usual pasta sauce, and probably good with chicken too.

This recipe is a precursor to something very yummy. It needed a little spicing up, so along with the onions, I sauteed garlic and baby portabello mushrooms. I added diced (I am also going to try it with sun-dried)tomato after adding the cream to the mix. In a separate pan, I lightly sauteed some proscuitto in olive oil, which I added at the same time I added the tomato. If you want the sauce a little thicker, cream of tartar helps too. All in all, this is easy to prepare but looks and tastes pretty impressive. YUM!

Haven't made this particular recipe, but NOTHING can compare to Rigatoni with Vodka-Tomato Sauce featured in Bon Appetit's R.S.V.P. October '94 (Ristorante Lunas, Delray Beach, Florida)...olive oil, shallots, crushed red pepper, fresh basil, parley, prosciutto, Asiago cheese, cream, tomato sauce, and of course, fire up the vodka! Couldn't find it on this site, though. sorry.

I can't imagine how you could screw this recipe up, but it was really good when I made it. I don't know how people gave it such bad reviews. I do agree with adding more to it. I added a bunch of garlic, salt, and black pepper. I will definitely add mushrooms next time, and adding the tomatoes and red pepper sounds good too.

I just made this without basic nor thyme (had none on hand) and very light on the terragon (ala the reviews).. I sort of guesstimated all of the ingrients, and added some leek and garlic. You know... i think you can't go wrong. Just add any of these ingredients together and you are ready to rock! :D Oh look, there's some vodka left...

I was looking for a cream sauce I could make with the few ingredients I had on hand. Since we don't keep it on hand, I made it without the vodka. It was easy and delicious, my finicky three year old had three helpings! Next time I'm going to add peas, etc. As another commented this recipe is a great starting point.

"Sauce Rosee," available at allrecipes.com, is similar to this recipe and very delicious with pasta (particuarly tortellini!). If you try that recipe, I recommend using only 3 T. olive oil, 1/4 t. thyme, 1 t. sugar and a dash of pepper flakes. Use the full 8 oz. of tomato sauce and cream too. Yum!

This meal was a huge dissapointment. Not only did it lack in flavor, but I felt as if I was eating a big bowl of nothing. Defintely not worth the time.

I will make this again with one huge change: leave out the tarragon. That was awful! It overwhelmed the whole sauce. I think next time, I will just use thyme and basil, or maybe add some oregano also. Definitely can use more vodka

This was wonderful. Just thinking about this, I am craving it again.

Just follow the recipe... The only thing you may want to do differently is add the Vodka first and simmer a little before adding the cream. Other then that, this is a easy, fast and great dish.

I thought this dish was just OK. I wanted it to taste MORE of Vodka. It ended up tasting only of parmesian cheese and cream so it was like an Alfredo sauce. I followed the directions to a T. The only thing I changed was I used half and half instead of heavy cream. I did used dried herbs so if I made it again I would use fresh.

Nice and easy recipe. Simmering the vodka is a must as is using fresh herbs if you have them. I only had lemon thyme in the garden...what a wonderful twist! (No pun intended!)

This dish is marvelous, but you have to be used to food prepared with alcohol. Otherwise, the taste may be overwhelming. Try adding the vodka before you add the whipping cream, and allow to simmer until the acrid alcohol smell gets less and less. Then add the cream. If you're hit with an overpowering taste of vodka, you didn't let it simmer enough. Alcohol needs time to burn off a bit. Light and creamy- I loved this recipe!

Wow! I wanted to make this sauce for a special dinner with my boyfriend tonite, but was so scared by the bad reviews that I made a half batch for my lunch just now as a test. I followed the recipe exactly - just a little salt and pepper at the end and I'm not sure that was even necessary. I used fresh thyme and basil, but dried tarragon. It does NOT taste of alcohol; the people who said that it did obviously did not simmer as directed. Also, mine thickened beautifully. Of course I did make just a 1/2 batch, but I'm sure just a little more simmering on a full batch would yield the same results. It is really a unique and delicious sauce!

I made this recipe with lobster ravioli. It was absolutely delicious. I would definitely make it again.

I used 2 shallots instead of the onion and 2 cloves of garlic and 2-3 tbls of tomato paste and the rest of the ingredients and served it over lobster ravoli. It was wonderful. The herbs are what made the sauce.

Yuck! Although I love vodka and am an adventurous cook, I found this recipe to be almost inedible - I ended up throwing dinner away! The flavor of vodka was too strong and simply tasted much to wierd with pasta. I tried to rescue the taste by adding 1/2 tsp hot pepper flakes and a can of tomatoes, but it didn't do the trick.

To enhance this recipes flavor - I added 2 cans of chopped tomato and simmered them along with the vodka and onion for about 10 minutes - this really sets the vodka flavor and you won't have to use more than 1/3 cup (more for the martinis!) I would definitely add 1/4 tsp or more of red pepper flakes and add the cream and fresh basil at the end.

This dish rocks!! It has a strong vodka flavor. It is so good with cocktails. Oh yeah, rock on with this delicious pasta. I will definitely make this for my next dinner party with the Jones.

Made this dish with the addition of a cup of pureed tomatoes, and a little more vodka. Still came out kind of bland. I really think yu could up the vodka to a cup, and double all the other herbs/seasoning (my standard recipe criticism). Finally, I used angel-hair pasta to be a little different. Wouldn't do that again. It tends to clump up.

Good grief! Why do people get so riled up about a recipe? If you don't like it, just say so and state your reasons -- then move on. Who cares about "authentic" (authentic what?) if it tastes good? I enjoyed this dish and will make it again. It's a good springboard for creativity or fine on its own. Seafood would be great in it and so, I think, would a light marinara sauce. Very satisfying.

Rating: 3
this can be lightened by adding a simple marinara sauce to the cream sauce, getting a nice pink vodka sauce. try it over tortellini with some peas and prosciutto. mmmm.

Having read the reviews, I was hesitant to make this pasta dish for my Italian husband and did not know who to believe.Oxford or Los Angelos?Berkley or Milwaukee? So I made it and we LOVED it!! I was told to add this recipe to our collection.

I liked this - after dressing it up a bit. I increased the onions and added 8 oz sliced crimini mushrooms (sauteed with the onions). For texture, I topped this with toasted pine nuts. I agree that this needs quite a bit of salt and pepper. I served this with roasted turkey; and the next day, I combined the left-overs (turkey & pasta) for a delicious pasta entree.

I must say I found the peanut butter and jelly sandwich I made after abandoning this nightmarish train wreck of a tase disaster to be quite satisfying. The sandwich took on the culinary quality of a tenderly prepared filet mignon at the finest 5-star restaurant. I could go on, but I have to clean up my peanut butter and jelly plate and go throw that other crap out. Thanks. Im from New Jersey too, so we know what we are talking about. Yeah.

I had a similar sauce at a friend's house and was looking for a recipe that would compare. Fortunately I found it. This was delicious. I served it over lobster ravioli and it was a hit.I would definitely make it again.

I made this for my husband and I, and we absolutely loved it, with a few changes. I substituted fresh rosemary (uncut) for the other herbs, and added five fresh roma tomatoes seeded and peeled to the sauce. You don't need to make a roux to thicken the sauce if you use heavy cream. Add your pasta to the saute' pan with your herbs, tomatoes and onions, and vodka and pour your heavy cream over that mixture and let it saute' for a few minutes and you will have a beautiful pasta dish. Next time I'm going to use lemon flavored vodka, and add a bit of fresh seafood. But remember to add enough salt to bring out the flavors without overdoing it. Under cook your pasta just slightly before it reaches al dente', and remember to salt your water. Enjoy!

The herb combination is very nice, although dried herbs make for a little bitterness. To thicken the sauce, try adding a bit of flour with the herbs, and cook for at least two minutes - make sure there is enough butter, so that it doesn't all just clump up.

I have made this dish a dozen times. Everyone has enjoyed it. Try adding sauted shrimp and portabello mushrooms. Use fresh herbs and do not rush the sauce.
