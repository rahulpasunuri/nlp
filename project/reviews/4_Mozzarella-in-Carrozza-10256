This is a dish that used to be served at a great Italian restaurant in NY. Their version: take a square loaf of unsliced bread. Trim off all crusts, then cut a 1/2" slice off one end, and reserve. Hollow out the rest of the loaf, leaving at least a 1/2" border. Use scooped out bread for crumbs in another recipe. Fill hollow loaf with cheese, stuff reserved slice into the end of the loaf to seal in cheese, then coat with egg and bread crumbs and fry until golden on all sides. The anchovy paste is used in the sauce, not spread on the bread. When ready to serve, slice the "spiedini" with a serrated knife, and spoon sauce over the slices. Wonderful!! (P.S. If you don't use the anchovy paste in the sauce, it comes out too bland. Used sparingly, this will add great flavor to this dish.

I didn't use the anchovy paste at all. This was fantastic and got great reviews. I made a vodka sauce on the side for dipping. Great appetizer.

the anchovy paste could be omitted
