Re: subbing thin sliced potatoes (yum!): do potatoes need to be cooked (parboiled?) before adding to tart and baking, or do they cook enough during indicated bake time? Thanks for a great suggestion, will try it with potatoes and pesto.

While not rock-your-world great, these little tarts weren't bad at all. I added lots more Parm as well as thyme (dried) to boost the flavor. Next time I might try the tomatoes idea and sub basil for the thyme.

This recipe was nice but it could be better. Next time, I will add mushroom.

Absolutely bland, even though I added some ectra sharp cheddar. The amount of ricotta overwhelms all of the other flavors. Also, the butter on the leeks made it super greasy. I would not make this again.

Good as is, but even better if you want to play with the ingredients. Nice leftover, too; I took one on a hike the next day and ate it on the trail for lunch; it was perfect: hand-held, filling, and tastier than a sandwich. Some variants I have tried: -I had the best luck with Dufour Pastry Kitchen's frozen puff pastry. Pepperidge Farm and La Boulange didn't puff enough for my preference. Dufour cooks more evenly and is probably a larger sheet -- make 6 tarts, or 4 bigger ones. -One night I ended up using sharp Vermont cheddar instead of the parmesan (hubby took the parm to work for his pasta) and it worked great; the tang and creaminess worked well with the ricotta. -Fresh whole milk ricotta is key. -Use a mandoline for your leeks and especially if you are also going to use potatoes. Potatoes need to be small (fingerling are good) and paper, paper thin. -Mushrooms are a nice addition, especially if you get a mix of wild/exotic ones and drizzle the baked tarts with a bit of truffle oil. -Definitely use fresh herbs for this, and experiment with other herbs/a mix. I grabbed a bundle of thyme, marjoram, italian parsley and rosemary and a bit of each was very nice (go easy on the rosemary, tho, and save some parsley to sprinkle on top of the baked tarts). -Onions, shallots and/or garlic are good. Do the onions and shallots on your mandoline and toss with the leeks before assembly. -I prefer one egg in the cheese mixture; it's less runny and holds everything together just fine.

Substituted about 3/4 of the cheese as goat cheese instead of ricotta. added mushrooms. This was quick, easy, and delicious! My boyfriend and I made it for my family, and everyone was impressed. It would be a great dish for easy entertaining.

We really enjoyed this! I made one large tart instead of cutting the dough into 4 parts, which shaved a couple of minutes off prep time, but I had to add those minutes back on for the cooking time, as the center section was not completely set at the end of the cooking time. I also added extra leeks and some extra fresh parm on top.

This is my first time using puff pastry. I thought it was excellent. I didn't find it bland.

I make this a lot, but substitute Gruyere for the Parmesan, creamy goat cheese for the ricotta, and add mushrooms to the leeks. I love it!

Really tasty and they taste great hot or at room temperature.

I made this as described, but I thought this was quite bland. The basic concept is good, but I think you should give fork ratings for the actual recipe, not the result when you had to snazz it up, hence the two forks. I have to say, I made these two from the same menu (for a book club), and I was disappointed with the results of both. I would make this better by using some wild mushrooms and more flavorful cheese, as other reviewers noted.

Even after reading the reviews & trying to snazz it up, this was still a little bland. You really can be creative, though. I put portobello mushrooms, which were excellent, plus some goat cheese. I think more goat cheese would have been a great idea, and sliced tomatoes would have been good too. Will try again.

I found that adding a little more salt and parmesan to the ricotta mixture helped. Also subbing some of the ricotta for goat cheese. These were a hit at my dinner party.

I felt it was a little on the boring side. I think it could be improved with adding a slightly more flavorfull cheese. Perhaps some Gruyere. I may play with the recipe because it was very fast, easy, and looked good. It just needs a little more umpf.
