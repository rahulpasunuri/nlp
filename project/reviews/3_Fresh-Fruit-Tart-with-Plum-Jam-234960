This was both fantastic and easy--with modifications. I used 1/2 cup of crushed hazelnuts to make the flour. I used plum jam that I had on hand. For my fruit, I used blackberries and pluots which I fanned out in an overlapping circle so I definitely did not use 8 cups of fruit. It was a huge hit at my dinner party --rave reviews from everyone, even the pickiest of gourmets!
