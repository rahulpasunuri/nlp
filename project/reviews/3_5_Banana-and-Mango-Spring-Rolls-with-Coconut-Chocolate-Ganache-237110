As I did not want to fry the rolls, I wrapped the bananas in Filo pastry (3 sheets) and baked them in the oven for 10 minutes. They turned-out great! I found the ganache rather dull. Next time I will add some chili powder to kick-it up a bit.

We liked these very much - I agree with a previous review, it's a bit much for a dinner party to make and serve hot. There was quite a bit of ganache left but I added 2 cups of heavy cream, mixed well and processed the mixture in the ice cream attachment to my kitchen set. DELICIOUS!!!!

This recipe is a crowd pleaser! I added cinnamon and sugar to the bananas before wrapping so once fried then had a nice cinnamon sugar glaze inside. So delicious. Pair this with some organic blackberry ice cream and it gives it a nice tartness.

This recipe was great! The ganache is to die for. I used wonton wrappers as I couldn't find spring roll wrappers, and it was delicious. The only complaint I have is that it really requires frying and serving almost immediately, which is not something I want to do at the end of a meal with company present.

A fantastic and unexpected dessert! No one could get enough. I served it with vanilla ice cream which went nicely. If you don't have experience rolling spring rolls it may take a few rolls to get it right. It helped me to put the bananas and mangos a little bit below the center. I will definitely be making this again soon!

This is a wonderful dessert for an Asian dinner theme. I have made this for a Thai dinner party and guests loved it.Be sure to use ripe fruit, 1/2 the ganache or save for another recipe. makes a beautiful plate. Try again if you were not happy the first time you made it!

I appreciate someone saying to halve the amount of ganache, thanks! and, to "A Cook from gfd": that's not Mozart. It's Beethoven's 5th symphony.

I was somewhat dissapointed with this recipe. It presented very nicely but the flavor just didn't make me want to make it again. The gananche however was very good. I would maybe use that recipe to put on icecream or for some other purpose. With some work this recipe could be helped out but who has the time when there's so many other new things to make!

Made this about a week ago, and it has taken me this long to get up the courage to review it. This recipe has potential, but not the way I made it!! Halved it to make 4 rolls. No palm sugar so used golden brown, no spring rolls in this town so used egg rolls, and used a regular banana. Couldn't make 1 thick slice of mango per roll--my mango was more slivered. Chose to bake them instead of frying. The mango leaked out the bottom of the rolls and basically disintegrated, the rolls were tough, and the genache was twice what would have been good (too rich). I would make this again if I had spring rolls, a mango that I could cut in thick strips, and also halve again the amount of genache.

We didn't really enjoy the blend of banana, mango and the strong ganache. Maybe we were expecting something else.

I tried baking instead of frying, so the crust wasn't as crispy. I'd also recommend getting the spring roll wrapper at an asian market. The thinner the better, for more crispness.

Absolutely delicious and easy. A big hit at a recent dessert party; everyone got in on the act. Variations are a breeze.
