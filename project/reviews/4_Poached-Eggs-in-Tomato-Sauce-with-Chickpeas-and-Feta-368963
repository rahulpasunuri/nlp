I've made this dish twice- in the last week. I was initially wary of the recipe's ability to develop rich, hearty flavors with such a quick and simple prep, but it certainly does. My husband usually cringes at the word 'vegetarian,' but he almost licked the bowl he loved it so much. I have been splitting into 2 pans and cooking approx. 7 minutes for a perfect egg that runs when broken. Amazing!

So easy to make and to keep the ingredients on hand. This is going to become a go-to recipe for our family. I ended up using Smoked Spanish Paprika because it's all I had, it makes it so good, I highly recommend making this change!

So pretty and flavorful and easy and cheap. What more could you ask for?

This is a favorite. Simple, healthy and so flavorful. Any good bread works well with this sauce. I want to point out that on my Ipad version of epicurious, the recipe said to cook the eggs 58 minutes, not 5-8. Obviously the dash was lost in translation. Mine turned out well at 8 minutes.

I was looking for a rather healthy breakfast alternative during Hurricane Sandy, and ran across this one. I am so glad that I decided to use it! It is amazing! My wife and I, along with an impromptu visit from a friend, thoroughly enjoyed this!! I took the liberty of adding a piece of whole wheat pita to the bottom of the bowl before serving. Ridiculousness ensued, and it was amazing!

Good flavors and very satisfying breakfast or even dinner. We didn't have flatbread and served with corn tortillas, but it was still delicious. Only problem..iPad app users beware. The recipe reads to bake for 58 minutes, rather than 5-8. I should've noticed that was odd, but didn't, and about 30 minutes into it, decided to pull it out. Still tasted good, but the eggs were WAY overdone.

Quickly became a favorite, although still struggling to find the perfect timing for the eggs. Also great with polenta (creamy or fried up).

Oh, also - I served the pita bread with honey and the mixture of flavors were amazing. Just saying!

I had high expectations for this meal given the other reviews and I think the dish stood up to the hype for the most part. While I personally wouldn't call it over the top amazing, it did have good flavor and everyone in my family loved it (particularly our two year old). I wanted to add more veggies to the dish, so I added torn arugula with the tomatoes and that was a nice touch. Also, I don't have an oven proof skillet, so I used individual souffle dishes (preheated in the oven so as to not lose heat in transfer from cooktop to oven) which worked out perfectly. I'll definitely make this again given how simple it was and how well it went over.

Easy, delicious, pretty. Great for a healthy weeknight meal.

Just made this for a brunch with friends and it was a big hit. I used navy beans instead of garbanzo (really, any white bean will do). I rarely make the recipe as it, but did in this same (minus the bean substitution) and this recipe was dead one. The eggs did take longer than 8 minutes. Probably more like 10 and they will still cook once out. I served with some sour cream and avocado. Yum!

My husband LOVED this! I had some misgivings about the egg whites after reading some of the reviews here, and mine ended up being overdone as well. After more than 10 minutes, they still looked underdone when I took the skillet out of the oven, but a taste test did not yield an egg white gag reflex. My theory is that juices from the pan and melted feta both look similar to undercooked egg whites, hence the overcooking on my part! Next time I'll trust the recipe time and taste for myself before cooking further. By the way, even with overcooked eggs, it was delish. :)

I followed the recipe as written, but used 4 eggs instead of 8. I didn't take the pan out of the oven after 8 minutes becuase the whites didn't look set, but at 10 minutes the yolks were more soft-boiled than runny. Next time I'll take the pan out of the oven at 8 minutes and let the whites finish setting in the pan, wihtout the heat on the yolks. Otherwise, this was a great success, incredibly flavorful and filling.

I've made this several times. This has become my husband's favorite dish. I've also used navy beans in place of chick peas and think it soaked up the juices better. I omitted the jalapenos as I didn't have them at both times. It was still flavorful without them. Clean up was super easy which is why we keep making this dish again and again.

Made this with a can of crushed tomatoes and it was delicious! We don't eat a lot of meat will put this on our regular rotation - healthy and filling. Served with a piece of naan. I was worried about overcooking the eggs though, and they ended up being overcooked - I think 10-12 minutes would have been perfect. But I kept the sauce and made a few freshly poached eggs with the leftovers.

Very yummy! I only used one pepper and it was just spicy enough but not too much for my 4 yr old son! I think that the eggs would cook better if you don't make wells for them to go into. I did this and by the time the whites cooked the yolks were getting set.

A really lovely dish that is filling without being heavy. The chickpeas add a nice texture contrast to the tomato sauce and eggs. After 8 minutes in the oven, the egg whites were still runny so I turned on the broiler. Then I accidentally cooked it too long so the yolks were firm. Even so, the dish was delicious. I will definitely make this dish again.

Not my favorite. The tomatoes overpowered everything. Needed more spices. Beware ... iPad recipe says bake for 58 minutes...not 5-8.

This was excellent! I made the recipe as stated but did cook longer (more like 15 min) and finished it in the broiler for a minute because I like my yolks to be cooked fully. I put chopped cilantro and scallions on top before serving. It was awesome! Love it and will totally make it again. My fiance said it reminded him of huevos rancheros.

This was amazing and easy. I cut the recipe in half, but kept it with one entire can of chickpeas. I had forgotten the Jalapeno peppers, but had chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and used them instead....gave a very nice smoky flavor to it. I rarely make a recipe more than once, but plan to use this quite frequently for quick dinners and brunches.

Oh my goodness, this was delicious, and will be a fixture in my brunch repertoire from now on. I used the spice amounts in the recipe, plus approx a half teaspoon of salt. I used Penzey's sweet Hungarian paprika... you want a good paprika for this dish. This is a very adaptable dish. In the future I may add sauteed spinach, roasted cauliflower, mild white fish, or shrimp. The eggs are great, though. I served with sliced sourdough, which worked well as a substitution for pita, but cornbread would be tasty, too... and you have the oven hot enough to make cornbread in a cast iron skillet while the eggs bake.

Easy to make and tasty. I also made pockets for the eggs after the first egg spread all over the surface. Eggs needed 8 minutes to cook, but yes, very difficult to know for sure when exactly they were done. I used goat feta preserved in brine. Should have rinsed the feta before using it to cut down on the salt. Not sure if I was happy with the cumin. Curry or chili powder might have been more to my taste. I'm sure either would work.

I have made a Mexican version of this for many years. No chickpeas, chili powder instead of paprika, Jack or Cheddar cheese instead of feta, fried corn tortilla instead of pita. Serve the egg and tomato sauce made like this recipe on top of the tortilla. Sprinkle cheese and cilantro on top. Voila! Huevos Rancheros how a Mexican momma taught me to make them.

I am curious, what kind of pans are in the photograph?

Exceptional and great alternative to a heavy carb strata for brunch. Everyone raved about it. The eggs were done perfectly with a little extra time. I made pockets for the eggs to go in so maybe they cooked better. Pleased the vegaterians at the table. I will make this again!

Very delicious. Next time I'll go half cumin and maybe a teaspoon of pasilla chili powder. VERY hard for me to tell when the eggs were done. We ended up going about 14 minutes w/ the eggs, because the whites still looked soft, but the yolks were cooked solid. Winning or learning! Definitely going to have it again.

This is very easy and delicious. I made it for dinner, and while it was good, it felt a little too "weeknight." I had it the next morning and it was much better. For the leftovers, I fried the egg instead, and used a little dutch goat cheese and it was yummy!
