This recipe is delightful -- almost a Caesar dressing on pasta feeling, and we know Caesar salad is a well-loved dish, so Caesar-type pasta is an instant winner! We see some variations here that compliment the recipe well, and adding some shrimp makes it an easy side dish for fish!

I have to say that I would never have guested just how much the anchoives DO increase the flavor of this recipe. Also, I do agree that you need to double the dressing ratio to the pasta.

I felt the salad was dry and needed more dressing. I doubled all the ingredients, tossed with pasta and voila--a summer favorite!

I doubled the recipe and found it dry so added more mayo and yogurt (2 tbs. each). Also used a full pint of cherry tomatoes and freshly ground black pepper to give it more kick. I'm not a dill fan so I substituted fresh basil and oregano, but I think any fresh herbs would work well. This is a recipe that almost teases you to be creative. Next time I will definitely add sliced black olives. Might try chopped zucchini, celery or red onions or maybe some cubed mozzarella as well. Overall, a nice summer side dish.

I like this recipe, although I added chives, basil and parsley - I've been making a green goddess dip for years and think its great on pasta!

Mediocre, although very quick and easy. I added a bit of basil and mint and that didn't help its inherent blandness.

This was delicious, although I modified it. I blended the dressing to make it smooth and creamy, and left out the anchovies, because I didn't have any. I added white wine vinegar and garlic. Yum!! I'm going to make the dressing as a vegetable dip from now on. It was delicious!

This recipe is easy and tasty. I couldn't find anchovy fillets so guessed on the amount of paste to use. I tripled the recipe and came up a little short on the dressing so had to add a few ingredients (from the recipe) so it wasn't dry. I also added thinly sliced carrots and whole olives for color. I think this will become an old stand-by.

We really enjoyed this pasta salad--it has a great flavor. I served it along with hamburgers and corn on the cob as part of a summer dinner. The only changes I made were to replace the yogurt with 2 additional tablespoons of mayonnaise and add a few more tomatoes. Also, because of an oversight, I did not rinse the pasta under cold water and therefore served it warm. I would serve it the same way next time.
