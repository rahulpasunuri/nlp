YUMMY! I made this as written, but without the cilantro, and it was still one of the best guacamole/avocado salsa recipes I've made. I added an extra avocado and half a tomato to the leftovers and that made it better for eating it with chips.

It's just good. I would suggest thickening it up with a bit more meat than recommended... but that's my personal taste I suppose... keeps it on the chips better.

This made a great, no-cook meal on a hot summer day. We skipped the meat and ate it with just tortilla chips.
