This was deliious. We did it in the microwave with rhubarb from the garden. It was the one of the last garden meals of the season (pesto, tomatoes, zucchini) It is not pretty but it tastes great.

I love rhubarb and this is delicious. I cooked in on the stove and left in nice and chunky. Will serve it with ice cream, maybe some whipped cream and chopped hazelnuts.

Ginger and rhubarb! How can you go wrong? Fresh strawberries are killer with this. I nixed the microwave and did this on the stove. As long as you stir it just often enough, it still comes out nice and chunky and doesn't burn. We ate it over vanilla frozen yogurt, but even straight out of the dish on its own is to die for!

You know, I would've given the gingered rhubarb compote four forks on taste alone, but it looks like hell, so I cut it to three. I used the microwave, and 5 minutes is WAY TOO LONG. It is now mush. However, it tastes like mush from heaven. We're going to have it over pound cake with whipped cream.

This was delicious. Having a huge rhubarb patch in my garden, I am always looking for different ways to prepare it and am surprised I am the first reviewer. I did not use a microwave (don't have one) so added a little more OJ and cooked in a pot. Still quick and easy preparation. The ginger is a real winner. You can also add strawberries after the rhubarb is cooked.
