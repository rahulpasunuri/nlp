This is a wonderful recipe which I serve often. It looks great and tastes even better.

There's a serious error in this recipe that I didn't catch until I'd ruined 12 oz of beautiful (and expensive) crabmeat. The ingredients list indicates 1 tsp of kosher salt is to be added to the crab mixture. Although I was doubling the amount of crab, I only added 1 tsp, since even that seemed a bit much. I figured I'd add more salt as needed, as the preparation instructions states "season with salt and pepper." The result--again, i was using half the amount of salt for the amount of crab I was using--was so salty it was absolutely inedible. Blech.

Just great. We served it as a small first course/ starter salad with a light fruity wine and it was delightful! Served this way, the recipe easily served six people.

I'd give it 5 stars if possible. Absolutely fantastic recipe. The ingredients sound odd together, but making the recipe as is hits a home run!!

Tried this while on vacation down in Florida. It tasted like florida sunshine salad to me. We even picked some of the Ruby Red grapefruit down in the Indian River Valley from a place called Hale Groves. http://www.halegroves.com Their were plenty of other road side stands but this placed worked out for us. We actually replaced the crabmeat with imitation and it was still tasty. 4 forks!!
