My sage leaves keep coming out with a burnt taste. Sad face! What is the key to success here?

Big disappointment. Very bland, even with additional seasoning. The flavors just didn't go together well. Wouldn't make again.

All the previous suggestions were very helpful, especially the note to heavily season the ricotta. Adding pecorino romano cheese added to the flavor. I fried the sage in the olive oil, let it cool and then crumbled on top - better than slicing.

The appetizer was great! I followed the instructions of one of the prior reviewers and brushed my crostini on both sides with a butter and olive oil spread and then put it in the oven for ~10 minutes at 400F to get them nice and crispy. After everything was put together, I also sprinkled some truffle olive oil on the crostinis and that actually pulled it all together! The smells, the tastes.....yum! Great colors, smells, tastes, and textures.

I was so impressed with the visual presentation of the dish that I didn't read the reviews beforehand. So, I made the butternut squash, ricotta and sage crostini for sunday brunch with friends and it was a disappointment. I will definitely read all reviews before preparing anything else.

Reading the reviews helped me make sure to season well every step of the way. Finished product was delicious. I think properly making the crostini also helped. I melted butter and added some olive oil. I brushed both sides of thinly sliced baguette with mix. Used a microplane to just shave a pinch of pecorino romano and a fresh crack of pepper and a pinch of kosher salt. Don't go overboard with the salt as the pecorino is salty. Toasted at 400* turning once until golden. Garlic would be a great addition to the oil/butter mix. The sage leaves I had were very large. After frying them I snipped strips onto the crostini. The flavor and color of the sage really added a lot to the finished dish. Thanks to a previous review I sprinkled a few toasted pine nuts on each. Delicious.

Tried this for my nieghbourhood's 3rd annual Halloween Party. I would say that that everyone is right about seasoning the ricotta and squash properly. I will never really know as I made a rookie mistake and chopped part of my thumb off while trying to chop sage as I didn't have quite enough for whole leaves for each. Needless to say I left the sage at home, wrapped up my thumb and went to the party. The crostini as I left it was a disappointment (bland), but that was probably my own fault and not that of the recipe entirely.

These were delicious and my guests devoured them. I think the key to this recipe is seasoning. Without proper seasoning, the ricotta and squash could easily be bland. Follow the instructions, but keep that in mind when seasoning and adding the lemon juice.

A lot of work for a marginal dish. Very disappointed.

Excellent recipe. Many layers of flavor. The lemon is an excellent backnote, and the fried sage is a wonderful, gourmet finishing touch. I fed the neighborhood with this one, and everyone loved it.

Delicious! I tried the recipe using both ricotta then a second time with chevre with the addition of toasted pine nuts. Both were excellent, but as ricotta is milder it allowed the sweetness of the squash and sage take center stage. Stick to the original recipe! It's perfect!

Any ideas for a substitute for ricotta? This sounds great, although the texture of ricotta is not a favorite in our house. Maybe I will try with fresh buffalo mozarella... Other thoughts?

Made these for an autumn-inspired dinner party - were a big hit! I did not drizzle the lemon juice and olive oil at the end - I thought the lemon juice would overpower the flavor, and the oil would make it messy. The dish turned out fabulously without!
