This recipe did not work at all on a variety of levels. First, the microwaving of the beets took at least 3 times as long as stated, so it would have been about the same as on top of the stove, which would have made for easier peeling. I've never microwaved beets before, but they were very difficult to peel after this method. Additionally, I made it very close to the recipe (subbed pecans for walnuts and shallots for green onions) but we both found it very bland. It needs at least twice as much dressing. As recommended by another, we added goat cheese, whihc was a good idea.

This was very good--better if left to sit for a while so the flavors meld. It really should be called coriander beet salad, though!

I love this recipe. I've made it 4-5 times already. It's great served on top of bibb lettuce, topped with extra walnuts and pieces of goat cheese. I do leave out the coriander and have never tried the recipe with it.
