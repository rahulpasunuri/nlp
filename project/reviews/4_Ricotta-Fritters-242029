I loved these. I used the lemon after zesting and made a quick icing. My 9 and 7 year old loved them. Easy peasy.

I CANNOT believe how easy these were to make. I was so sure making these would go horribly wrong. Super easy, and super delicious. The only downside is that you need to be making these and serving them almost simultaneously as they aren't very good at all after they've cooled.

I made these tonight for my family, and they were absolutely devine. The only thing I did differently was pair it with a remoulade sauce for dipping. Thanks for the great recipe!

Absolutely delicious! Made them nice and small and they cooked up beautifully - they even flipped themselves over. Agree that the lemon zest is essential.

4 forks because there is nothing I would change about this.

These are delicious and super, super, super easy to make. Whipped up the batter in about 2 minutes and the lemon zest makes it, in my opinion. It is a gentle sweetness, not overpowering. I might add a touch more sugar next time, depending on my mood.

These are so freakin good and a snap to make. Not as heavy as you might expect. I've made them twice this week! The first time, I made them a bit too big and cooked them too quickly (winging it without a thermometer for the oil), so they were a little batter-y in the middle but still delicious. Second time, I got the frying perfect and also tried adding dark chocolate chips to the batter. I know the chocolate may make them less traditional (and it can get a little messy), but it's so good!! Worth a try. Also, I wouldn't leave out the lemon zest - it gives a great, bright flavor.

Really great way to use any ricotta that you need to use up. Fabulous....my guests devoured them!

Great treat. Made it for a holiday gathering for our apartment building. Kids and adults loved it. It yielded far fewer than 3 dozen, though.

This is a recipe I will return to time and time again. I even made the batter ahead of time and kept it in the fridge for a few hours until I was ready to fry them up. They were delicious. Not too heavy and not too sweet. I served with with some lemon curd on the side. I can't wait to make them again.

I found this when searching for "Passover Recipes". There must be a mistake as flour, baking powder, powdered sugar and non- passover Vanilla Extract are certainly not kosher for Passover. Do not mistake this for a Passover Recipe and serve it to someone who observes the holiday!

Might be awesome but this should not be in the Passover section. NOT KOSHER FOR PASSOVER.

I have not made this, but it is NOT kosher for passover - it calls for flour in the recipe!

A winner!! I read this recipe and immediately wanted to try it. I had part skim ricotta on hand so that's what I used. I halved the recipe and it turned out great. My husband loved them but agrees that they're not Passover food. These were easy to make and delicious.

Delicious and simple. Certain to become a new favorite around here!

I agree, no flour for Passover!

These were delicious and gone in an instant. Not for everyday because of calories, but what a nice treat now and then. Loved the hint of lemon.

Sounds great, but in addition to the other non-Passover ingredients already mentioned, any leavening is a no-no, so no baking powder either. However, there are a couple of recipes for Passover confectioner's sugar on the website.

Neither the flour nor the confectioners sugar are Kosher for Passover. But great for any other time!!

just btw, if they are for passover, they should be matzah meal, not flour. didn't try it, but should work?

Made these for breakfast this morning. My oldest boy claims these are the best non yeast doughnuts he has ever had. As for the younger three the meal passed without comment - the silence of food appreciation. These doughnuts will be made again.

Light, lemony, and delicious. It tasted very similar to a cheese blintz, only a lot easier to make.

These fritters have a nice citrus background flavor, are very tender, with a nice outer crust. I used a small ice cream scoop (which is a little more than a tablespoon) and that made the process of dropping dough into the oil very easy. As an alternative to dusting with confectioner's sugar, the fritters could be very lightly drizzled with a mixture of confectioners sugar, lemon juice, and milk. Go easy on the sugar dusting or glazing, since these already are somewhat sweet. I made these for my son and his two friends for breakfast, and they couldn't get enough to eat.
