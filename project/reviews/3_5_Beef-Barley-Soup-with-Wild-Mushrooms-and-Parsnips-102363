I made this recipe as stated, except I used beef for stew meat and a beef shoulder roast. Although it say that it makes 8 servings, it is more like 15-20 servings. It truly does need 15 cups of liquid if you make the recipe with all of the ingredients stated. It was sooo delicious! The barley makes the broth thick, and the meat and veggies are very tender. Note that the red peppers add an overpowering taste to this soup. Although I LOVE raw red peppers, I think I'd cut back or eliminate them from the soup as it is a bit much.

Since it is the 1st autumn storm of the season, I decided to make a hearty soup. It has been a few yrs since I made this, but I did remember how much the recipe makes. I decided to make half the recipe. I also followed others advice to use beef short ribs. I also used the button mushrooms instead of wild, to save cost. One thing I do recommend, deglaze the pan with a cup of wine, and reduce with a dash of Worcestershire sauce for more depth. I also cut back the amount of barley. It is a yummy, old world style soup!

This is a great winter soup recipe. I followed the recipe as writen but reduced the barley to 1/4 cup and next time I would add more meat. This makes a ton of soup so we froze half.By far the best beef barley soup ever

This soup is fabulous, if you make a few changes. First, as someone mentioned, beef shanks are flavorful, but tough. I used left over standing rib roast from Christmas dinner. I had 1 rib left, probably 2 lbs of meat that I cut into soup size pieces, and added 3 beef soup bones. These are basically shanks without the meat, but with wonderful marrow. And I cut way down on the liquid. 15 cups? That has to be a misprint. I probably had 8 total, a combo of unsalted broth (canned broth us the yuk) and water. And as someone else suggested, I soaked the porcini in hot water for 20 minutes and then chopped them. Added the soaking water (careful not to add the grit that drops to the bottom) with the rest of the liquid. Also used a mix of crimini and shitake mushrooms. Oyster and trumpet mushrooms were not available but exotic mushrooms are worth it. I cut the barley back to 1 cup, as I cut the liquid, but probably could have gone with a bit more. Now, using prime rib meat and bones made this a little fatty but let it cool over night and you can scrape as much fat off as you like.

I loved this recipe. I made it for my grandson's birthday during a big snowstorm in Seattle and everyone enjoyed it. I used dried wild mushrooms from Whole Foods (in a plastic tub) as well as a variety of fresh mushrooms. Soak the dried mushrooms in boiling water for 20 min and use the water in the soup- adds loads of flavor. I omitted 5 cups of water. And I used thin sliced short ribs as suggested by another reviewer- browned them on both sides, removed from the pan and then sauted the onions and mushrooms.

Fantastic! Just made it for the 5th time. I use short ribs, brown them in the olive oil first, reserve them. Sautee mushrooms and onion and garlic in remaining fat. Then put the rest of the ingredients (except barley) in. Bring to a boil. Rinse the barley first, then add it in, cut the heat back to a simmer. Voila! finger-licking good! I too, use cremini and button mushrooms. Does not need added expense of wild ones...

I'm sure I don't know what the critics are speaking of regarding this recipe, it's simply fabulous! I generally hate parsnips but found that I do not mind them at all in this recipe. It never fails to bring rave reviews whenever I make it. The only thing I do differently is I use thin sliced short ribs instead of the shanks because the meat is much easier to separate and is very tender.

What a wonderful soup! I doubled the beef and used a mix of baby portabella, white button, and crimini mushrooms. It was fabulous but please note that it makes A LOT OF SOUP!

If you need to follow a recipe exactly, don't make this recipe. I have used this recipe as a guide several times with wonderful results. I use 1 1/2 lbs. shiitake mushrooms, don't bother with the porcini, change the meat to stew or sirloin (brown and deglaze with wine), & decrease the barley to 1 - 1 1/4 cup. Really does need good homemade beef broth. Add about 2 tbsp. fish sauce, 1 tsp. red pepper flakes & 1 tbsp. worcestershire to add to complexity of flavour. Serve sprinkled with fresh parsley and grated parm. cheese. Wonderful on a cold winter night. My husband loves it.

I was disappointed with this soup....I made half a batch and I thought it had too much barley in it....if I do make it again - I'll use half the barley. Taste was okay - but needs something.

What a disappointment! The expense of the wild mushrooms was a total waste. You need nothing less than a STOCKPOT to cook this in. I would suggest (if you INSIST upon trying this recipe)that: 1) you cut it in half 2) cook it in a pressure cooker to tenderize this tough cut of meat and 3) cook it with some salt instead of adding it only at the end. Fresh herbs may also make a difference and I agree with previous interviewers: I like parsnips but not in this dish. Perhaps a good piece of hubbard squash instead. I definitely will NOT make this again, even with modifications to the recipe.

This soup is excellent. Very hearty and delicious. I made it when it first appeared in Bon Appetit a few years ago. Have been making it a couple times yearly ever since. My friends and family all love it! Make it without meat and it is still delicious. Be sure to use pearl barley not the quick cooking barley. The pearl barley releases more starch into the broth and makes it velvety.

I used button mushrooms instead of wild and turnip instead of parsnips. I also used less liquid and less barley. This soup is much better reheated the next day.

I'm glad I ignored the previous negative reviews for this soup- we all loved it! The wild mushrooms added a great earthy flavor and gave me something to do with the abundance that my husband picks. I did omit the parsnips (I just don't like them) and added a pinch of our own dried habanero flakes for a kick. I will definately make this again, and again and again- everyone asked for the recipe.

I just made this for the 5th time or so. I made a half recipe and it fed 10 people a good-sized bowl. as usual i left out the wild mushrooms cause i'm sure their flavour would only be overwhelmed. But this time i also left out the parsnips and found the soup tasted better withouth them, although i like parsnips they are just a little odd in this recipe. so i don't think this is a great "gourmet" or unusual recipe, but if you like beef barley soup this is a great basic recipe that went over great with my guests, in fact i am back here to send one of them the recipe. Tastes even better the next day and freezes well in individual portions to bring to work.

Substituted regular rather than wild mushrooms, added a fair bit of red wine and the pot couldn't hold the full amount of liquid - So this made a very rich hearty stew. Next time, I will cut the recipe in half.

This soup had a delicious earthy taste. Though it was a long list of ingredients, it was well worth the effort. I did make 3 changes: omitted the oil; cut back the meat to 1 1/2 pounds and used boneless chuck stew meat; used button mushrooms instead of wild ones. By the way, it makes a TON of soup - I got 18 cups out of it! I had to freeze some as well as give some away. I hope it tastes as good thawed and reheated as it does fresh...

NOT WORTH EVEN ONE FORK!! I have to wholeheartedly endorse the review dated 31JAN02 by "A Cook from Calif". The flavors were bland at best. I took the advice of previous reviews and used common mushrooms. Glad I did; I would have kicked myself if I had spent a boatload of money on such a disappointing meal. Also glad I halved the recipe. Nothing worse than feeling compelled to eat unappetizing leftovers because of residual parental guilt about the starving children in (choose the country).....

One of those silly recipes that seems to think that the more ingredients you have the better it is. It manages to have too many conflicting flavors, and to be boring at the same time. And the fancy mushrooms are a total waste.

I really love this recipe! My only pet peeve is that I usually spend over $20 in wild mushrooms! Add everything else up and you're looking at $10 a bowl. I would suggest using regular mushrooms and possibly the dried porcini for the flavor.

Absolutely wonderful soup. Like many of the other reviewers, I used button mushrooms and beef chuck instead of shank, and it was just great. Made half the recipe and still had a big pot of soup. A definite keeper.

Anyone who thinks that this soup has no flavor must be doing something wrong. This has become a fall/winter staple in our house. Easy to make, lasts a long time. We love it.

What a waste of expensive mushrooms! After making this soup, I ran back to my computer to see if I had been mistaken about this soup receiving a re-make rating of 85%. While there were plenty of ingredients, there was very little flavor. This was even after having added some Kitchen Bouquet and Worcestershire Sauce.

I have rarely made soup, but you would never know that from the results! This soup had a wonderful flavor and was very filling. I used chuck roast, substituted button mushrooms and make 1/3 the recipe as others suggested. My husband had a lukewarm response (at best!) when I told him I was making soup. He had a second serving, as did I. I felt vindicated... :)

I made this soup last winter and am doing so again this week. We found it to be very satisfying and comforting on a cold night. It freezes very well, giving us the opportunity to enjoy it several times and share it with others.

Great soup! We used all lower-sodium beef broth and eliminated the water, also I wouldn't omit the dried mushrooms and their liquid - deepens the flavor, but could substitute button mushrooms for the more expensive wild types. It makes a lot, but we like leftovers, especially soup! I'm going to make it again today!

Very good hearty soup. I made 1/3 the recipe for 2 and it was enough for 2 meals. I used rutabagas because the store was out of parsnips and it worked out fine. When complete the consistency was really thick so I added more beef broth.

This soup was fantastic! My husband says it's the best he's ever had. I substituted ready-cut stew beef and button mushrooms and it came out just wonderful. Also, I only made 1/3 of the recipie and we still had leftovers! I will definitely make this again.

The time it takes to make this soup is well worth it! I did substitute a beef roast - easier to prepare and added more meat. Family and friends gave rave reviews, so it is in my "make often" recipe list.

good tasting but very time consuming to make. Because of high fat content from beef shanks I had to defat the soup. I put mine in the refrigerator until the fat rose to the top and was hard.

GREAT soup for fall/winter. Although the amounts seemed excessive, in the end the liquid was absorbed by the barley, and we ate every last bit of the result. We substituted sirloin tips for the hard-to-find (and work with) cut suggested in the recipe - it worked just fine.

Fresh mushrooms from the farmers market really enhance the flavor. Be sure to have a crowd coming over or your freezer containers ready; this makes a ton of soup!

We halved the recipe and still had soup to eat a week later. Due to ingrediants on hand used rutabaga instead of the parsnips, it was very tasty, but the flavor of expensive wild mushrooms seemed to get lost with all the other ingrediants. I would probably just make this with fresh button mushrooms next time, and keep the wild mushrooms for a dish where they will be the focus.
