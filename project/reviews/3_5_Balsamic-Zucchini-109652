Very good and easy zucchini recipe! I followed the recipe exactly however i am still getting used to using the broiler in my new gas stove so I accidentally burnt it however it still tasted really good so I think that speaks to how delicious the recipe is!

Extremely good. Made as directed but ended up broiling close to 16 minutes to brown. Will make again!

Great flavor and so easy to prepare. Had to cook a little longer than the recipe states based on my oven temp and desired doneness.

Delicious and could not be easier. Highly recommend giving it a try. Roasting keeps the zucchini in tact where sauteing always seems to make them break apart no matter how hot the pan. The cheese gets perfectly crisp as well.

Easy and delicious, made with one of my giant garden zucchinis and as written. Just had to broil a couple minutes longer for the first step. Yum!

I'm not sure if I found this average because I'm sick of zucchini or if it was really just ok. Because there are so few ingredients you really should use the best quality stuff you can afford/find. I used a nice Parm, balsamic, and olive oil from my local Italian market and it was good enough I'll try it again just to see how I feel about it. I halved the recipe and there was enough for 2 main course servings. My husband loved it. Maybe as a meatless main dish with some good quality bread would make it more complete.

A simple yet very tasty recipe. There were some weaknesses due to "user error." I used a lower quality balsamic and cheese that I should've because that's what I had on hand. I'm going to try it in the future with different nuts besides pine nuts just to cut expense and fat. Maybe walnuts and/or pistachios.

delicious delicious delicious! instead of parmesan cheese, i used goat cheese, and threw this on top of pasta with some extra EVOO. hoooooooooly delicious i want to eat more and more and more of it. ALSO, i realize, looking at the recipe again, that i cut my zucchini much thinner - i was using my mandoline, on its largest setting but it is still maybe 1/4 of an inch thick at the most. still delicious! maybe will try the thicker slices if am eating them alone or something.

Fantastic! Even my zucchini-disparaging husband gobbled it up!

Some tips preparing the recipe for just two people: one pound is ample; cut as described, but toss with balsamic first, then with olive oil, salt, and pepper; broil for two minutes, then turn and broil other side for two minutes; top with parmesan and broil (just that side, of course) one minute longer; top with nuts and serve warm. OUTSTANDING!!!!

This was good and I look forward to making it again. Don't skimp on the ingredients, use only the real parmesean. The toasted pine nuts are a very nice touch. Nice enough for company!

Yummy. Slight modifications made - used parmesan in lieu of parmigiano-reggiano. Roasted twice as many pine nuts and added one whole on top of each. It was a nice touch, added appeal and texture.

Yummy and a nice change from the usual steamed or in pasta. I sliced the zucchini as directed and cooked only until a few brown spots appeared. I added the balsamic, broiled a minute longer, then added the cheese and broiled another minute. Result: tender but not mushy. Definitely add nuts.

This is also great to cook on a BBQ if you have a griddle - very easy!

This has become a neighborhood favorite and has been passed along to many households with over-abundant zucchini crops. It's just fine with the pine nuts too.

My husband and I both loved this. I didn't chop the nuts, and I think they add a lot to the dish. We had it room temp but will try again hot. Half recipe was enough for 4 people. Followed the recipe for 3/4 inch thick slices, and it was not mushy at all. Will also try with eggplant.

Pretty good recipe for side dish. Important to not overdo the oil. The second time around, I added Roma tomatoes and oregano on top of the zucchini and under the cheese, after broiling the zucchini with the vinegar. Works well at room temperature, but I much prefer them hot.

I had a couple of major conflagrations but managed not to burn the zukes. Requires careful watching.

I loved the recipe, but enhanced it even further by drizzling the finished dish with a balsamic glaze. It added an extra punch that my family loved, and finished the dish to perfection.

I loved this recipe. I did cut the zucchini thick and cooked for less time. Everyone enjoyed it!

This was okay. Nothing to write home about. I have had more exciting vegetables before.

I could eat this every night! The key is to slice the zucchini fairly thick, and broil until just BEFORE you think it's done! It doesn't get mushy that way, and the textures and flavors are wonderful. I prefer it served hot, not cold or room temperature.

I loved this dish! I cooked it again substituting eggplant for the zucchini and it was even better!

For people with mushy problems - note the width of the veggies. Pretty thick! Ours turned out great. We served this with the grilled tenderloin and hobo packs. Delicious!

I was dissapointed after reading all the great reviews...This recipe was just ok.

Very good. I would think it would be a very good way to broil eggplant as well.

I would make this again, only I think it tastes much better hot. I used red-pepper infused olive oil as well. When cold, it just lost its sparkle.

Yuck. Followed the recipe and completely agree with the Cook from NYC: if you want overcooked, mushy zucchini with overbearing balsamic vinegar, this is indeed the perfect recipe for it.

A different version that has similar flavors but much better texture: slice zucchini in half length-wise, toss in a little olive oil. Grill (or put under broiler)for a few minutes each side till browned but not mushy. Remove to a rack and immediately sprinkle with sea salt, balsamic vinegar and finely shredded asiago. If you wish, cut into chunks when ready to eat. Even the leftovers are good.

Very good dish with a buffet - I used ridged Italian zucchini from the farmer's market which are a bit heartier in texture and taste than the smooth ones. Don't broil them too long if you don't want them mushy, and let the disch come to room temp and then sprinkle on the toasted pine nuts just before serving. Received very positive reviews.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend and my parents with a broiled mahi mahi and it was a hit. In fact my mom liked it so much she called me from Colorado the next weekend to ask me for the recipe. Oh and I used bell peppers in my recipe as well and the taste was fantastic.

Interesting way to make/serve the lowly zucchini. Enjoyed the combo of flavours that added much to the zuchs. Toasted the pine nuts but did not chop them and really enjoyed the texture of the whole nuts especially since the zuchs were quite soft. Suggest you do not broil them as long as the recipe states, or else they could be too mushy.

4 lbs of zuccini was too much for 4 people, so I halved the recipe and it was still way too much. The toasted pine nuts became soft during the meal which turned off my diners to having seconds. If you like mushy zuccini w/soft toasted pine nuts, this is the recipe for it.

I would make this again for myself, but not for people who don't like the texture of cooked zucchini.

I have made this recipe for years, minus the parm and the pinenuts. It came from the Kingsford charcoal recipe book, and calls for using the grill instead of the broiler (obviously), which makes a huge difference in flavor. A small grill rack for cooking fish, etc. makes it easier, but you can always just slice the veggies larger if you don't have one. I also use portobellas, asparagus, onions, yellow squash...whatever. This is a great recipe, and versatile enough to be served at any temp. Muy Delicioso!

I didn't have any pinenuts, so I skipped that part, which is a pity, as that is what appealed to me most in the photo. However, I would still give this 3 1/2 forks, as it really is a wonderful and interesting flavor combination. Definately one of those rare Keeper recipes.

I made this for an afternoon lunch and it was a hit. Very easy and can be made ahead of time which I really like.

So simple, quick and easy. I used zucchini, asparagus and red pepper and some grated Gouda. The extra step of drizzling the balsamic vinegar made this so much more interesting than regular roasted veggies w/evoo.
