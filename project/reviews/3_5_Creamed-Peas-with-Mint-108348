Excellent. Made as written the first time but second time I added cooked pearl onions as another reviewer has suggested as well as toasted slivered almonds and a bit of roasted garlic. (made a very nice twist on an amandine). Will defintely make again.

we love the mint fusion in the cream ! when making this we added teeny pearl onions (boiled 5 minutes; dunked in ice water; trimmed and popped pearl onions in with the thawed peas). we topped this with fresh ground nutmeg, white pepper and grated asiago cheese.

This was just okay... nothing special.

I grew up on this dish. It is a classic in my family and I am so glad that it is being shared with a new generation. Serve over toast and enjoy. :)

Anything cooked in cream would be good, but this was superb. I used 1 tsp butter and sweated the celery and onion. I cooked the frozen peas in the cream until it was reduced and they were done.

I've made this a couple times now. I've used fresh peas, and each time I end up wishing I had cooked the peas a little longer. I don't like them crunchy. Other than that...It's delicious. Serve it with the lamb burgers with mint yogurt...Yum.
