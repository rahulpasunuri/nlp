Halved beautifully and was delicious but I found the pecans way too salty.

This was a hit at my house. The cake was light had a nice banana flavor without tasting like banana bread. The icing was not as sweet as some are saying. I would make it again...but it was time consuming.

This came out really well. I nixed the lime and used standard rum instead of dark since I did not have any in stock. The frosting was great. Not too sweet at all. I will make the cake again definitely. It had a cake consistency unlike some banana cakes which taste more like a banana bread. But the frosting was time consuming so I may use another frosting

I only used the Caramel Cream part of this recipe. It was delicious. I did, however whip the cream to harder peaks as some reviewers suggested and I think it did help with the consistency.

I make this cake exactly as described with no modifications and it was easily one of the best cakes I've had. Everyone in our group loved it. I didn't think it was too sweet as others are saying. Pic: http://bit.ly/aoXmBK

This cake was a hit. I halved the recipe to two layers and further reduced the sugar (maybe by 20%), which worked great. The result would have been even better, if I hadn't gotten carried away and added a mushed banana to the cake batter. The upshot is that the cake was too dense and banana-y (surprise!) for my taste, but my husband and our guests devoured it. My only complaint was that it wasn't quick and easy, as promised by the search key. And, I have to admit that I would have preferred some chocolate fudge swirls to the salted pecans.

So I am not sure why this cake is thought to be too sweet or too big. I made it with minor changes (per reviewers suggestions) and thought that it was slightly bland when made w/less sugar. The cake is a great cake as is. I also iced each cake individually which created a less grandiose, more boring cake. It is hard to say wheter I like the caramel cream or not. I thought it tasted too much like bananas, not enough like caramel. Try using half a banana instead of a whole one. and whip the cream more than the recipe calls for. mine was too fluid to spread on the cake. The pecans are PERFECT!!!!

The best banana cake I've ever tasted! I halved the recipe and simply sliced the one cake in half to have a double-layer cake. I made a few changes to the recipe: 1) Used about half the sugar called for and it was definitely sweet enough. 2) Used one extra banana for the cake. 3) For 1/3 of the buttermilk amount, I used sour cream instead. It's still delicious a couple of days later!

I really liked this one. The cake is dense but nice and moist. The lime/rum mixture gave it just the right tang that kept the whole thing from being too sweet. The caramel cream was pretty easy, I just beat the cream until it was pretty stiff. Here's how it turned out: http://ourlifeinthekitchen.blogspot.com/2009/09/banana-layer-cake-with-caramel-cream.html

Made for my baby's first birthday with cream cheese frosting. The first time I made it exactly as it is written. I found it too sweet and a bit too dense for cake. I did not make the caramel cream. The second time I adjusted the following for the cake. Cut sugar in half - 1 1/4c which was plenty. I substituted half of buttermilk w sour cream - 1/2 c + 2 T buttermilk and 1/2 c sour cream. I also used 4 bananas (2 c). I think the measurement of bananas is more important than the number of bananas. With the changes the cake was less sweet, lighter and more cake like. I made it into cupcakes - got 2 dozen.

We loved this cake! It is perfect with the different flavors and dreamy combination. A wonderful birthday cake.

This cake was so absolutely fabulous. All of the flavors came together beautifully and I have to say it tasted so much better days 2 and 3. Yum!

The cupcake idea is great! That saves the work of cutting the cake layers and then layering the icing. It also avoids the problems with cutting such a tall, filled cake. I love this recipe. I have made it 3 times and people love it. You really have blend the banana caramel mixture in a processor so it's smooth AND you do have to use a candy thermometer to get the right consistency for your icing.

I made this a while ago and it was amazing. I don't know why people are complaining. It was a lot of work and my cake was kinda sloppy but it tasted amazing. It is a huge cake so next time i will make half as much, and because it's so big, it took a while to eat. On the third day the cake was pretty soggy.

I thought this cake was great, but gigantic, so I made it as cupcakes the second time. I swirled on the topping and placed a pecan or two on the top of each cupcake. You can make the cake, pecans and carmel ahead of time. It also took a lot less time the second time I made it, because I knew what I was doing by then.

This recipe as it is has WAY to much sugar, sickeningly sweet, about 1 1/2 cups excess sugar. After reading the other reviews, I made changes to the recipe w/ GREAT SUCCESS. I made some major adjustments to the recipe, see below: Cake Changes *only used 1 1/2 cups sugar instead of 2 1/2 cups (1 cup sugar & 1/2 cup brown sugar) *3 bananas instead of 2 (so 4 total including icing) *1/4 sour cream & 1/2 buttermilk instead of 1 1/8 cup all buttermilk I noticed the moist ingredients & dry ingredients weren't in balance. So since I was adding an extra banana, I cut back on the moisture/buttermilk. *cake took longer than 35 minutes to bake, more like 45+ Icing Changes *only used 1 cup brown sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups I could taste the lime juice, but not the alcohol. Next time I will double the amount of alcohol I drizzle on the cakes. Sea Salt-Roasted Pecans Changes They were absolutely wonderful!! *used about 2 1/2 cups chopped pecans instead of 2 cups pecan halves *only roasted in oven about 7-10 minutes, instead of 15 *I put pecans in the middle, on top & on the sides It turned out great, a new fav! http://flickr.com/photos/heathashli/1131525495/

The caramel cream sounded like heaven but was hell to make. Guess I really do need a candy thermometer because what I got was not appealing. The cake was very flavorful though and I'll make that again but will not bother with the fancy schmancy cream stuff.

Make sure you have a candy thermometer for the caramel! It took forever to make this for my mom's birthday but it was a hit. Leftovers in the freezer were a treat too... kids loved it.

After reading such diverse reviews, I decided to make this cake along with another recipe for back- up in case this flopped. My cake turned out great! It was very moist and everyone loved the frosting. The toasted nuts were essential to offset the very sweet icing and cake. The whole cake was eaten in one sitting. I asume that people who ended up with a dry cake either overbeat it or overbaked it.

There is nothing about this recipe that I liked. The preparation was FAR too long, the cake was too dense for such a light frosting, and it didn't taste that good... certainly not for all the work that went into it! After having tried this recipe, I have two regrets; one, that I couldn't rate it lower than one fork, and two, that I ever made it in the first place!

I can't believe that this got such high ratings. The cake is far too dense and the whole thing took too long. There are much better desert recipes out there...

One of the most amazing cake recipies I've ever made. The cake itself is wonderful.. you just have to be careful to follow the instructions EXACTLY. Baking is a science. It will come out light and flavorful. Every single person raved about it!

This cake was so much work and while I LOVED the caramel cream and the salted pecans, the cake itself was so dense that I will not make it again. I was glad to hear someone else thought it was like banana cornbread. My guests called it ugali cake, after the Kenyan staple made from cornmeal.

I loved the caramel cream and will use it again and again in any way I can think of!! HOWEVER the cake itself was a real bust ... like slabs of foam rubber that tasted like banana-flavored corn bread. I made it a second time substituting a yellow rum cake recipe and it was perfect!! Do make sure to heat the caramel to exactly 128 degrees ... it goes up to about 125 pretty quickly and you have to wait for quite a while before it ticks up to the point you need it. Also don't bother trying to whisk the whipping cream ... let's be honest, use an electric mixer; you're making whipped cream !! With the tweaking, it's absolutely delicious, and you shouldn't have a problem with runny filling.

I don't understand why this is not rated higher. It is one of the best desserts I have ever tasted! The only negative is the amount of time it takes to prepare. But the results are so worth it!

Love the bananas foster flavor of the icing. it would make a great ice cream base. the only problem is cutting? how do you cut through the dense cake without the icing oozing out or the layers sliding? (carefully with a very sharp knife) i have the same problem with other multiplex cakes.

Yummy...dense banana cake with sweet, soft cream and salty nuts. We could definitely taste the dizzles of lime and dark rum; but not in every bite. I recommend making the cake, cream and nuts the day before; and then putting it together the day that you will be serving. I thought the cake tasted best cold.

It sounds as though some people may not have cooked their caramel to a high enough temperature. That could explain "soupy" caramel cream. Mine came togehter and was plenty thick for spreading. It's worth another try if you had trouble with it the first time!

The flavors in this cake were truly remarkable. It was like a bananas foster cake! The pecans also are a "must have." My relatives loved it, and because it is rich, small slices can be served. Yes, the cake is dense, but the icing provides a great contrast. The caramel for the frosting is so great that I'm making it again as a stand alone caramel sauce for ice cream. The only problem I had was the caramel overspilling from the pan so make sure you are cooking it in a pan that can handle about triple the original volume.

This was a huge disappointment -- it went ok until the frosting -- mixing the whipping cream into the caramel left me with a soupy mess. I had to put it in the freezer to harden before serving. Most of my book group just ate a few bites.

I found this cake to be superb. Yes, the cake is dense, but the frosting was a good complement with it's lighter consistency. The addition of the lime juice and rum brought it to a higher level. Everyone raved!

This turned out great! The cake is a little more dense than some but that doesn't make it a bad cake! It was very moist. My caramel cream turned out great too-plenty thick to spread. I am making it for another birthday in a couple of weeks.

I made this for Christmas dinner and have been looking to see what others have written and what their experience was. I agree, the cake was very dense, but the mix of the cake, the cream and the nuts was terrific. As usual I had way too much food, so I had a half of this cake left over and after a couple days, it tasted even better! I might substitute another cake recipe, maybe my homemade cakes just come out too dense.

ICK ICK ICK. I was so excited for this cake but we threw 2/3 of it away. THe cake was way too dense and didn't have good flavor. the caramel cream was yummy, but was way too light to work with the dense cake so the cream smushed out the sides and dripped down (and everything was plenty chilled when I frosted). I was really bummed that it didn't turn out - had to make a make-up dessert for my weekend guests the next night (chocolate mousse from Cook's Illustated - much better)...

While making the icing I thought "This is devine" ---reminded me of Bananas Foster. My boys couldn't wait to taste if but each one of them said "something is weird". The bananas seemed out of place in the icing. The cake itself was too dense. Loved the salted pecans with the sweet icing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Next time will make a lighter banana cake recipe that I have and leave the bananas out of the icing. Don't really think the lime and rum made any impact on the taste. Will definately use the salted pecans but might use peices instead of halves so you get a little in every bite. This recipe was not good enough to make as is but good enough to try again with some tweeking.

This cake is delicious. It's a wonderful and sophisticated blend of sweet and salty. I ended up making this as trifle because the layers began to slide around and I knew it would never make it in one piece to the partry we were attending. It was a comical scene as my son held the cake in place as I ran to my basement closet for the trifle dish. Be sure that the layer cakes are completely cooled - perhaps refrigerate before beginning to layer -that may help to reduce the "slide" factor. It's a time consuming cake to make, but definately worth the effort.
