Made this for Superbowl Sunday. I went to the local Safeway and found 3 pounds of boneless, skinless chicken thighs on sale for $1.99 per pound vs. one pound of ground chicken for $5.99 per pound. No brainer decision to take the better tasting thigh meat and triple the recipe. The Pancetta was good but I agree you can easily substitute thinly sliced bacon and get similar results. I left the milk in the bread and added a bunch more bread crumbs to make these really stick together. I made the Peperonata as is which was a great accompaniment but after the meatballs were done in the oven (and I made each one the size of a baseball so cooking time was doubled) I put them in two jars of spaghetti sauce out of a jar and just let them simmer in there for an hour or so covered instead of using the tomato paste routine. Excellent tasting and served Penne Pasta on the side.

For any Primal or Paleo chefs out there, I omitted the breadcrumbs with delicious results! I added shredded parmesan for texture, but I'm sure it could be omitted. The meatballs hold together just fine without bread. The flavors in this recipe work together beautifully, and the peperonata is the perfect complement to the meatballs.

Tastes great! The texture is a bit meatloaf-like though which was a surprise to me for some reason. I made two batches, one with salted pork belly, and then when I found pancetta another with that. Both equally as great. The red peppers are something I will definitely make again as an easy side to other recipes.

I come back to this recipe time and time again. An old favorite now. A gourmet twist on classic spaghetti and meatballs, and guests are in awe!

Everyone loved these. The only changes I made were that I used regular old bacon instead of pancetta, as the store was out (Madness!). Turned out great anyways. I didn't think it needed more salt, as some other reviewers said, maybe because I used bacon instead of pancetta? I didn't make the peperonata, but I definitely will next time I make these!

very bland. Needed to add alot of salt and it still tasted lousy. Couldn't taste the panceta. will not make again.

These are great. It's hard to find ground chicken here, so we use turkey, and they come out just fine. Also, sometimes our market doesn't have pancetta, and I substitute prosciutto with no ill effects. The peperonata, I make all the time to go with other things as well. Nice on bruschetta.

Quick dinner and comfort food! Short cuts: I used 1/2 c italian bread crumbs from the pantry (put a little milk on to moisten them just before mixing in to the chicken) I used 4 strips of the already cooked bacon I had in the freezer and didn't make the peperonata - just used condiments from the frig. Make extra and put them in the freezer before cooking - pull them out and bake for a quick week night dinner.

This recipe does take longer to cook than 25 minutes--more in the 1 hour range. Some changes -- leave in the oven until they start to brown (gets rid of the mushy) "brown food tastes better!" Also, try pureeing the pepper to make it more like a dip.

I agree with a previous reader's review. Total time exceeded 45 minutes. I accounted my first attempt attributable to the initial learning curve. But even after my second attempt(with short cuts taken)the total time still took a bit over an hour, at best. And Im pretty advanced & organized cook. Nonetheless, this recipe is easy & tasty. I also used turkey meat in this recipe and it was delicous..The peperonata was an excellent complement to the meatballs. tangy & healthy..

Just took these out of the oven, tasted them, and tossed in the garbage. Thank god we do not have company coming over. I followed the recipe to a tee and we both thought these were wet, mushy, fatty tasting meatballs. The pancetta overpowers the chicken and makes it taste like pure fat. I do not recommend making these. Very happy I made fresh marinara so we have something to eat!

I am giving this 3 stars, not because it didn't taste great, but because it WAS NOT 25 mins ACTIVE time. This was a lot of work and my dinner was late! I am great cook and take on very difficult recipes but this was way more work than I counted on. Having said that I did take others advice on basil, cilantro, and extra tomato paste. The pancetta was way to fat so I used prosciutto instead it added very good flavor. I also added sun dried tomatoes to the meat mixture, delicious! I will make it again and allow more time!

This was really yummy! Thanks to all the other reviewers for suggestions. I added a little extra garlic to the ground turkey I used, added 1/4 cup of finely chopped (peeled) roasted red pepper to the meatball mix, and brushed on more tomato paste (this was key). The peperonata was surprisingly tasty and was, as others have said, a great complement.

Rating: 3
This was a fast and easy recipe. I was expecting that I wouldn't care much for the peperonata, but it really complimented the meatballs well. I used ground chicken, and doubled the tomato sauce on top. next time I will add some tomato paste to the meatball mixture as others have suggested.

This is now my favorite meatball recipe, I absolutely love them. I've made it as written, and I've made some substitutions, and I always like it. The changes I've gradually made are to sub canadian bacon for the pancetta (the pancetta I get at Trader Joe's is a little too fatty and tastes a little too 'porky' for us) and using more tomato paste--1 heaping T in the meatball mixture, and 2 more for mixing with the oil and brushing on top. The peperonata is delicious, but I don't love the skin--I blister, steam and peel the peppers before roasting, then roast them on a non-stick surface. For some reason, any roasted spring or summer vegetable seems to go with these meatballs--asparagus, green beans, peppers, tomatoes, squash--but not the winter/root ones.

Excellent recipe. My husband was insistent that I make it regularly. Super easy and VERY flavorful. Thanks!

We really like these and it seemed light with the chicken so it felt much healthier then your standard beef meatball. I would double the red sauce though. I didn't make the pepperonata since I was pressed for time and they were just fine without it.

This is a keeper. It goes together quickly and is super simple. Next time I'm doubling the peperonata portion though, it's that good!

Terrific. I will make this again and again! I made a few changes, though: I added a tablespoon of tomato paste to the meat mixture, and used a small cookie dough/ice cream scoop to make smaller meatballs. Also, I zapped the peperonata in the food processor to make it more of a chunky sauce. Served on garlicky pieces of Italian bread, with deli-sliced provolone, for the BEST meatball sandwich in the world. My brother hates chicken meatballs and devoured this. Served it with broccoli rabe. Amazing!

Better with turkey! At least turkey's good for something...

GREAT recipe! I pretty much followed it to a tee. I used 50/50 on dark/light meat. I served Classico tomato and basil spaghetti sauce on the side which was a nice complement. The peperonata is good but I'm not sure it fits in with the meatballs. I served with garlic bread as suggested for a great weeknight dinner. I think you could make smaller meatballs and serve as an appetizer with toothpicks. The pancetta is a must.

I would rate this recipe @ 3 forks, but it lacked some of the luster that i would expect out of the effort put into creating the dish. For example: The red peppers are an excellent accent to the 'meatloaf' meatballs, but in reality it over powers versus accents the dish. I wish i had finely chopped the red peppers after roasting them and threw them in with the meatball mixture. A quarter cup would have put more flavor into the meatballs. The topping of the tomato sauce is a key here for adding that sweet/bitter you need from any meatloaf type recipe. Again another modification i will try with the left overs is blending the red peppers/capers into a puree, and serving the meatballs over it. It may be a better way of smoothing out the flavor of the peppers while accenting the meatballs. I used sour dough bread in the meatballs. I also served this along some oven braised cauliflower.

I thought this was really good - and forgiving - I doubled the recipe - used wheat bread and even threw in some oats - I thought the tomato paste topping was amazing and will use more of that next time. the irony is that I think this is more of a meatloaf recipe than pasta type meatball recipe - I might try it that way next time - either way yum!

Rating: 3
Yum! I skipped the peperonata because i am not a fan of peppers - but the little meatballs were delicious. I used panko since i had it on hand and i think there are a zillion ways to customize these. My husband devoured them and he is most definately not a meatball fan.

Rating: 3
I like these so much better than the 'standard' kind of meat balls. I agree that the recipe needs more garlic, and a lot more salt. I feel like it's still missing something, but I can't figure out what. Maybe turkey would work better. These were so fast and easy, I'll definitely be making them again.

Rating: 3
This was pretty good. I loved the peperonata flavor! Make sure to cut the pancetta into very very small bits before you saute. I had to add some more bread (I used crumbs) to get the right "meatball" consistancy, but it worked out fine and they baked up well. I would make a little bit extra of the tomato glaze because it was good and there was not enough, I thought. Great with mashed potatoes and green peas!

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe! I used ground turkey, 3 slices of wheat bread and egg whites since that is what I had on hand. Per the other reviews, I added fresh basil to the meatballs. I served this with a green salad and whole wheat penne. Don't skip the peperonata sauce - the flavors of the sauce and the meatballs go exceptionally well together. My husband loved this meal (and is looking forward to the leftovers!) and I will be adding this recipe to my regular rotation.

I made this for hubby's birthday dinner tonight. It was fantastic. Great flavours....great instructions...simple but with that sense of a lot of fuss. I will definitely be doing this for company. Thanks so much !

My husband loved this recipe. We're not pepper fans so the next time I make it, I'll just skip the peperonata stuff. I had read previous reviews about how it needed salt so I just added a little more salt then the recipe recommended. Overall, it was pretty yummy and made a lot for just 2 people. We liked the idea of leftover meatball sandwiches though!

These were AMAZING. I used ground turkey and green peppers because that's what I had on hand. Best new recipe I've made in maybe a year, despite the fact that I cook new stuff from this site several times a week. Try these for sure-- moist and juicy, amazing melding of flavors.

I loved how light these meatballs were thanks to the use of chicken instead of beef. They were like little "meatball clouds", and the leftovers were excellent for lunch. My only criticism is that more salt would have been nice. See http://joleneeatshere.blogspot.com for my pics and more.

This was insanely good! The meatballs were moist, meaty and very flavorful - thanks to the pancetta and a ton of parsley. The tomato paste/olive oil topping was also a nice touch. The peperonata is fantastic and goes amazingly well with these meatballs. Plus we made awesome subs with the leftovers! GREAT recipe I'll definetly make these again!

This made a tasty meal, served with Italian bread and a green salad. I used turkey meat (more readily available than ground chicken) and added extra salt to the meatballs. Even still, I think the meatballs could have used more salt. Be sure to brush the tops with tomato paste--that's what will give the baked meatballs a nice roasty color. Visit http://apricosa.blogspot.com for pictures and notes!

Super tasty recipe. I used 1/2 white and 1/2 dark meat and bacon just because I had it in the frig. The only thing I might do differently next time is mix the tomato paste with a little white wine to make it a little thinner for easier spreading.

I made this recipe this past weekend for guests. It was so good and our guests absolutely raved. The presentation was very good as well. I put 3 meat balls on top of the peperonata on each plate. I served it with roasted red potatoes from the farmer's market. The prep is a lot of work but it was worth it. They were moist and cooked perfectly as written in this recipe.

Turned out very bland...should have guessed since it called for no salt. Red peppers were good, but the meatballs aren't worth making.

I made this entirely with ground turkey, rather than chicken, and it was delicious and easy. I'll definitely make it again.

I'm a personal chef and I regularly try the gourmet mag's recipes. This one was fast, easy, and super flavorful. The teenager I cook for ate them all before his parents got home and I had to make more. I stuck to the recipe this time and it was wonderful!

Innovative take on traditional meatballs. I made with white meat chicken and they were very moist. But I also made with pancetta as suggested by the recipe. The pancetta adds lots of flavor and keeps the meatballs moist. I baked the meatballs for about ten minutes before brushing with tomato paste/olive oil mixture. Also less messy than frying traditional meatballs.

This was delicious! I used 1/2 ground chicken and 1/2 ground turkey (93% lean). I also added a generous amount of fresh Basil and Cilantro to the meatballs instead of parsley, as well as a dash of dried thyme, rosemary and cinnamon. Lastly I skipped the pancetta. I used the peperonata as inspiration for a roasted red pepper sauce. I roasted the red pepper and mixed with the vinegar per the recipe, however, I added 1 more tsp of the red wine vinegar and added it all to a saute pan where I had sauteed 1 onion, 3 garlic cloves, and the 1 can of diced tomatoes. I then blended half of this and recombined it all and served it over pasta with the meat balls...delicious!

I thought this was too much work for the product. For all of their ingredients, I found the meatballs bland and dry, not "moist" as the header promised. To salvage them, I made a marinara sauce to go with them and served them with a sprinkling of Parmesan. My husband and son loved the result, but I wouldn't make it again.

Delicious! Couldn't find lean ground chicken, so I subbed 93% lean turkey. Also used leftover marinara instead of the tomato paste. My husband LOVED them and he is not usually a meatball fan.

One more thing... I added a bit of fresh rosemary and thyme. Probably needs it.

I thought "how good can this be with poultry?" The butcher didn't have chicken in the case, so I used ground dark meat of turkey. Because of inattention I was concerned I over browned the pancetta, onion and garlic. I sliced a large fresh red onion and put the slices in with the red pepper. The result was wonderful. Both my husband and I were shocked that such good meatballs could come from a turkey. Truly 4 forks. Great with the onion and bell pepper.

I bought the ingredients for this recipe before I read the review from Milwaukee. After reading that review, I decided to make a few modifications to the recipe -- I added fresh basil to the meatball mixture, 8 cloves of garlic to the pancetta/onion mix and another 4 cloves to the pepperonata, and because the meatballs turned out really wet, I added another cup of dry bread (diced up fine). I skipped the tomato paste and just salt and peppered the meatballs before putting them in the oven. After all of that, the meal turned out great. We tossed it all together with some pasta and olive oil.

Meatballs were really, really good. Definitely go with the thigh meat if you want them a little more moist. Also, don't leave out salt when you mix the meatballs themselves. Without it, they can be a touch bland. However, the peperonata *makes* this recipe. Don't skimp on it, and be liberal with it. Pretty sure the leftovers will make a rippin' good hoagie as well. We'll definitely make these again.
