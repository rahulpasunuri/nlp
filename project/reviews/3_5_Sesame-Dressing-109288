Very good salad dressing! Based on other reviews, I used only 1 Tbls tahini, 1 clove of garlic and 1 Tbls sugar. I also added a squirt or two of honey. Next time, I would probably increase the garlic to 2 cloves and use honey instead of sugar.

Very authentic just the way it is written. You can buy tahini which is nut butter made from sesame and keep it in the refrigerator and you will always be ready!

I substituted sesame seeds I ground in a coffee grinder. Excellent.

This salad dressing is so yummy and smells so good that everyone who passes by it gets a whiff and wants some. I omit the sesame paste since I never have any and sometimes the ginger for the same reason, and it still tastes great.

i used the dark toasty sesame oil and it was too strong, so i added more sugar and more vinegar. i also put way less garlic (more like one clove) because i was going to use it the next day and thought it might get too garlicky. also i don't know what asian sesame paste is so used tahini - figured it would be similar (if not the same)? anyway, it made the dressing nice and creamy. would make this again, but as a springboard for something more interesting.

I didn't have any sesame paste, so I omitted it, but used all other ingredients. DELICIOUS! Used it with a green salad to serve with vegetable curry and basmati rice.
