I've made this punch several times over the past few winters. It is very popular for an after-dinner sweet, and makes the whole house smell incredible.

Very enjoyable, I inserted the cloves into and orange instead of an apple for a smoother taste. I replaced the orange right before presentation.

The apples disintegrated, so the cider was full of applesaucey particles, but the taste was respectable.

This one goes in my permanent recipe file. Excellent flavors. I made it while family and friends were out hiking; when they arrived home, the entire house smelled delicious!
