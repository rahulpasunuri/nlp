2 forks- good but wouldn't make again. I've never made creamed onions before- but decided to make this because I had so many white onions (that were quite small) from the garden this year. A lot of work to peal all the onions- I wouldn't ever to buy and do from scratch. Flavor was good except the 1.5 cups of bread crumbs was too much- I used exact amts and size pan, but the crumbs made too thick of a coating, wasn't just a nice crunchy top.

Yum. Just made them for the first time. I followed amylousgar suggestion of cartelizing the onions first. Wow was that a great suggestion! I also used frozen pearl onions to save time. Will make again for Christmas!

As a time saver, I used frozen onions that I picked up at Trader Joe's that really sped up the process. One tip, thaw the onions first - otherwise it takes twice as long to cook. Otherwise, this dish was a success and would definitely recommend for all those Creamed Onions fans!

These onions were the hit of my Thanksgiving table this year. The only adjustment I made to the receipe was to caremelize the onions in some butter instead of boiling them...it made all the difference in the world. My husband is already asking for me to make them again!

Found this to be a wonderful addition to our Thanksgiving menu. Everyone loved it rather than the previous "yuk, creamed onions".

I added this recipe to my Thanksgiving menu for the first time this year, hoping to replicate a wonderful dish I remembered from a dinner 20+ years ago. It's certainly earned a permanent place on the T-Day table. It is scrumptious, and aside from the chore of peeling the hot onions (totally worth it), very easy to put together. Everybody loved it. I used half-and-half and the dish was plenty rich, and the sauce was very thick. I think heavy cream would be overkill.

This has been a family favorite at Thanksgiving... I also use frozen pearl onions (Birds Eye) and they come out perfect.

this recipe was amazing! I made them for a mini pre-Thanksgiving for my boyfriend and I, and they were so good I will be making them for the rest of my family for the holiday this year! I hope she will not see this, but my boyfriend said this recipe was hands-down better than his aunt's famous creamed onions, which he never thought was possible. definitely worth the homemade bread crumbs, and blanching first makes them so much easier to peel! best recipe I have found!

I make these every year for Easter, and they are always a hit, and a request. I use frozen onions rather than peeling them, and nobody knows the better. Delish!

I thought this was decadent! Had this for thanksgiving and will be having it again for Christmas. Peeling the onions did take time but so worth it. Even the kids enjoyed this creamy delicious dish!

I made these for Thanksgiving and they were Great! My Mom cheats and makes the frozen kind at her Thanksgivings.I always make things from scratch and I had thanksgiving at my house this year so I did all the cooking from scratch. Mom loves the taste of this freshly made onion recipe as much as her beloved frozen creamed onions from the store and these taste even better she said. I agree. I will make this a permanent part of my Thanksgiving menu.

I have been making Creamed Onions for years as a Thanksgiving staple as we loved them. Since I was looking for something a little different this year, I discovered this recipe. My recipe is the same except for the heavy cream (I always use milk) and the bread crumb topping is new. I doubled the overall recipe and made the bread crumb topping with Panko bread crumbs. Everyone love them and the bread crumb topping was a very nice touch. Certainly an added bonus was learning how to "quick blanch" the onions and shock into ice water to very easily remove the skins. I trimmed the tops and bottoms before the blanch and it worked perfectly. Very yummy and my guests are lucky I didn't eat them all my self. Every year I wonder why I wait for Thanksgiving to make these? I will definitely make these again!

This was an excellent recipe. I have never had homemade just the frozen in a box kind. I used heavy cream and it was outrageously decadent and had a really nice flavor with the nutmeg. Since it was for Thanksgiving and we also had stuffing we skipped the bread crumbs but I imagine it would be excellent. I will definitely make this again. The onion peeling was a lot of work. I might consider using a bag of frozen ones in a pinch. But it really was excellent.

Great recipe and a labor of love! My mother loves creamed onions, so for Thanksgiving this year I thought I'd try this recipe. I followed the instructions and recipe for making the onions the day ahead, it it made Thanksgiving day so much easier! The recipe was a hit, I would definitely make them for her again, but now I know ... those little onions take a long time to peel, even when blanched! So there you have it, we really liked the recipe, but next time I'll leave myself plenty of time and patience to peel those little pearls!

Sorry, I haven't made this but I can't persuade my husband to try any variation on the original English version, onions in cheese sauce. It's just boiled baby onions covered in cheese sauce (made with approx 1tbsp flour to 1 cup of milk and 4 oz of grated cheese - the better the cheese the better the sauce) and this is the absolute best side dish in the world with roast lamb!
