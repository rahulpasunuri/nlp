Yuck! Tasted like too-salty potatoes blended w/pickles, could hardly even taste the bacon.

I will make this again and again. First time, I used 2 TBSP of vinegar and that is enough! The second time I used 3 tbsp and it was overpowering the bacon. This belongs in my regular rotation!

This recipe was good, but not as good as many other mashed potato recipes I have tried.

Lovely rich potato dish - has challenged my mothers establishes au gartin as the potato dish for our get togethers. Love the vinegar to split the bacon fat.

I used small chunks of pancetta instead of bacon, and fresh thyme instead of dill - fantastic!

Great recipe! Dill & vinegar made it exceptional (not to mention all the bacon & drippings). Steaming the potatoes and smashing them took some of the mashed potato stress out of Thanksgiving. Would definitely make again. A big hit.

This recipe is divine. I tried it because I don't really like mashed potatoes. The dill cuts the richness of normal mp's. I will definately make it again.

Why would you put lettuce in smashed potatoes?

Ooops, actually less healthy. Reread it and it uses bacon grease and no lettuce, but bet it's yummy.

This looks like slightly healthier version of what was my Grandma's special ... Except she also put in a lot of the bacon grease and added about half a head of torn up iceberg lettuce. Vinegar went on top, not in. It was a big favorite!
