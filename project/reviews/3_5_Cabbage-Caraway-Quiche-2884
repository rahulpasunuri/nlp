Great way to use up some of the cabbage from the csa. Used veggie bacon and olive oil for fat, added some fennel and used 2x the caraway as recommended. Added a wee bit of smoked fontina that I had on hand. Went nicely with a beet salad

Found this last nite when I was looking thru my repertoire of recipes for something to do with fresh cabbage. Even tho it dates back to 1990, and I had typed it into my recipe collection in 1994, I had never tried it. Twas Delicious!! Did sub mostly condensed fat-free milk for the 1/2 & 1/2 (with enough 2% milk to make the 1 cup, Butterball 65% less fat for the high fat bacon, and Guggisberg for the Gruyere Swiss. Next time I would increase the caraway seeds and sub a bit of extra sharp cheddar for some of the Swiss. Good recipe for something VERY different!!!

This is a great recipe! I too thought the ingredients sounded a little odd but, being a cabbage lover, I took the plunge. It doesn't specify what kind of cabbage or onion to use so I used green and yellow, respectively. It was really good but I think it would also be good with red cabbage and maybe even a purple onion! I thought it could have used a bit more caraway - but maybe that's just me. Anyway, I will be making this again soon; loved it!

I have made this many times, always a favorite even with the people who typically do not like cabbage. A case where the sum is really much more than the parts.

Yes, as other people have said, the ingredients list makes this sound odd, but it really is delicious. And there really IS a ton of filling. I halved the filling recipe and still had a little left over.

delicious. the cabbage keeps the texture of the quiche moist and light -- great flavor from the bacon and gruyere -- friends gobbled it up. as a sidenote, somehow there was a shortage of caraway seeds in the three places i looked in manhattan, so i subbed a good grating of fresh nutmeg. quite different, i'm sure, but yummers. also, i used the crust recipe from the "YELLOW SQUASH AND MOZZARELLA QUICHE WITH FRESH THYME". great, easy recipe that rolls out well and is flaky and has no vegetable shortening (ick).

Looked at the ingredients - yuck. Looked at the reviews - ok, I'll apologize to the family if all of these people are wrong. Excellent quiche! Many complements, no leftovers. Fried veggies in bacon grease (reducing kitchen cleanup), added chopped, smoked ham. Served this with grilled T-bones, french bread and a bowl of grapes.

Really good! I used cubed pastrami instead of bacon, added garlic, and increased the caraway to 3/4 tbsp. Turned out fine!

This is and excellent quiche. I'm just an 11 year old, but I've been raised by gourmets, and I know a good dish when I taste one. This recipe makes enough filing for two pie shells.

excellent! It was very tasty and only lasted a day. We fought over the leftovers!

Very very good! Made this for brunch and loved it! Too much filling for one pie shell.

A tasty and different quiche. Very good, and easy to make.

Just fantastic. Still ashamed that I ate almost an entire quiche by myself. Was also tempted to abandon the shell and just scarf down the filling.

Was different. Tht would try since I had this wonderful fresh cabbage. My husband and I tht it was good. If I red d . more cabbage probably would do again. Added a little paprika on top ...gave it a nice brown topping. Added a little elephant garlic. Yes...if you like quiche..try this one for a change. Thank you epicurious for your recipes, etc...

I made this quiche exactly as the recipe dictates. It was delicious and hearty, with a nice flavor -- the cabbage was a interesting twist in the texture department.

This was good. I used vegetarian bacon bits i/o the bacon slices, and it was still very flavorful and with less fat. I added a tablespoon to the onions before I added the cabbage. Next time I may roast the caraway seeds first.

Excellent! Can hardly wait to make this dish again! Everybody loved it. Our kids don't like cabbage or onions, but loved this. My son asked for it again.

At 79 and living in a Residential Care Facility, I don't cook any more but have opportunity of giving this recipe to someone that might cook it for me. Sounds a little heavy on the calories with the half and half, but bet it really tasts very good!
