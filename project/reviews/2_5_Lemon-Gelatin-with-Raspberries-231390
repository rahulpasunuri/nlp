This is a strange, and not enjoyable dessert. The flavor was bright, but the consistency was revolting. Will not make this again.

Excellent recipe. Substituted and used Meyer Lemons. Served Lemon Gelatin topped with Mint Granita (recipe from epicurious. Easy to make). Garnished with candied Meyer Lemon zests (epicurious: candied lemon/orange peels. Easy to make). A great combination and a refreshing spring/summer treat. Enjoy!
