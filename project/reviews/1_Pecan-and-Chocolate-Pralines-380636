We followed the recipe as written and I told my wife we should place the pan in a bowl of ice when "stirring vigorusly" we did not and it looked to be too thin We then looked at the reviews and noticed that everyone else had the same issues We promtle placed the trays in the freezer and I hope we solved the problem note we only left them in the freezer for 3-5 minutes... looks like it is goint to work, we have 15 people tomorrow for a Christmas party and we will let you know how they turned out!

this did not turn out for me either but my mom explained why, which should have been in the recipe. once you get to the right temp you must immediately put the pot into a bowl of ice water. this will stop the cooking and allow for the right consistency to form. mine was delicious but it turned to sand because it kept cooking. bad instructions ba test kitchen!

the cook from South Amherst misread the directions it DOES SAY 236 but still did not turn into syrup after vigorous stirring so I thought maybe they meant hard ball stage but that just turned into sand. Too bad trying to make for a birthday gift the night before and wasted a whole bag of pecans. Plus, it's too sweet.

Bad directions. After I made this I checked other websites -- the temp should have been 238-241 -- SOFT BALL! It smoked and burned at 263!! Beware!!
