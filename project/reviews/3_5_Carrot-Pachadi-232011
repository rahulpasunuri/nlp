This is one of the easiest, most versatile Indian side dishes I've tried. My family loves it as a salad or on it's own.

Very tasty! We served this to a friend of mine who doesn't like cooked carrots and she finished off ALL our leftovers! I thought I had curry leaves at home and ended up having to substitute keffir lime leaves instead and it still turned out great. It's a nice accompaniment to beef vindaloo.

Thanks to all who explained curry leaves! I never knew about this. I'm going to make this soon.

I haven't made this, but wanted to confirm that yes, some South Indian and Sri Lankan people call the leaves of the neem plant "curry leaves." Also, I wanted to note that although they have a lovely subtle flavor, I think they are largely fragrant, like a bay leaf. Thus, if you can't find them fresh, you can probably just make the dish without them. Most Indian food has plenty of other flavoring.

Tried this but not the entire menu. This was very good. To the cooks from Santa Clara and Pittsburgh, here is what Epicurious.com defines "curry leaves" as from the chicken recipe that is part of the menu in which this dish is included: *Sometimes called meetha neem or kari patta, curry leaves are available at Indian and Asian markets. Luckily our neighbors are from Sri Lanka or I would have been lost too...

I was also going to ask about the curry leaves. The curry plant that I have seen is an herb that looks much like rosemary, but with a tender stem and a light sage/silver colored leaf. Eight of those tiny leaves would not add much flavor to any dish. The curry leaves in this recipe must be some other type. Where can they be found?

It sounds terrific, but what are "curry leaves?" Do they come from a curry tree? A curry bush? To think I always thought curry referred to a combination of spices ground into a powder!

This is one of my favorite side dishes to make with Curry. The toasted mustard seeds make it do not substitute. It's the most important part of the recipe. DELICIOUS!
