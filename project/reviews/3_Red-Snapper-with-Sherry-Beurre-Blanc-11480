I made this and thought it was amazing. Be sure to reduce the sauce enough befor adding the butter at the end and the sauce should be a great consistency.

I think this quickie is getting a bad rap. The only variation I made was to saute the shallots in a little bit of the butter before adding the liquid. We thought it was quite tasty and super fast/easy.

Very easy to make, but the flavor was just okay. I would probably not make it again.

my girlfriend and i were excited about this tasty sounding recipe. Then we cooked it and it was absolutely horrible. I love sherry but the sauce was thin and over powered with vinegar. we both tasted it and without hesitation it hit the garbage, fortunately i quickly whipped up a delicious beurre rouge to save the day.

This was probably one of the worst recipes I have ever made, and I wish I could rate it 0 forks. Is it me or are the other reviewers just use to mediocre?

I made this recipe but did not have wine or wine vinegar. Added a bit of apple-cider vinegar instead. (half of what was recommended)Was fast and excellent!

Quick,easy and delicious. I usually bake snapper in white wine, butter, lemon and herbs. Broiling was a nice change. I brushed filets with olive oil and lemon juice before broiling.

Very delicious and, even with the butter, this dish was very light-tasting. Sherry vinegar is my new favorite ingredient!

Easy to make, and surprising with the little amount of effort to prepare, this dish was very good.

This was very good. I didn't have a shallot handy so a yellow onion worked just as well. I didn't have any sherry so I used Marsala instead. It was still good. A great dish with lots of flexibility that's easy to prepare.

I really enjoyed this dish. It was simple and quick to make on a busy week night. My fiance, who can be wary of fish recipes, liked it also.

Loved this, but must confess I lushed up the dish by serving the fish on potato/garlic puree. The combination of flavours was wonderful.
