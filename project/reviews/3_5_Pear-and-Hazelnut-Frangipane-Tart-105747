Try using some rice flour in both the filling and dough recipe. You will get a crust and filling a taste similar to shortbread cookies.

So this is a classic french tart using hazelnuts in ace of the usual almonds. It is fabulous. I have also made it with Apples and blackberries. The only reason I could imagine it being bland would be if you neglected to toast your nuts - this step is what really makes the flavor intense. So don't skip that step, pulse the nuts thoroughly with the sugar, and enjoy!!

Basically pretty good but probably not a repeat for me. Mine never browned so it was pale and unattractive even though the flavor was good. I used Anjou pears which were maybe could have been firmer. Everyone ate it all, but no ecstatic comments.

I really loved it! I cook a lot and did it for a friends Birthday. All the guests loved it. The pastry was really outstanding, i didnt have to add any water. It was completely melt in the mouth. Maybe i would have put a little more pear but it really was delicious as is. Also really easy to prepare. Highly recomend it!

Very very good. Would make it again but just cut my pears thinner and different design on the top.

This is simply fabulous. It's beautiful and easy. I used almonds in place of the hazelnuts. After every bite my husband would say, "Mmmmm this is SO delicious." The tart shell recipe is a keeper; so flaky, even days afterward. As soon as summer rolls around and fresh peaches are in, I'm going to make it with peaches and almonds.

I went ahead and processed the nuts very finely with the sugar. After reading reviews about it being grainy, I thought a smoother texture could be attained by running the machine 'on' instead of just pulsing to combine. This worked well, and you will not overprocess if you do so with sugar added. I have made many frangipane tarts on this site, this is the first one with hazelnuts. This is an excellent combination of flavors, and the crust recipe is a standard for all tarts I make. For easier and more even baking, make sure that you fan the pears out as widely as you can, closer to the outside edge. I used D'Anjou pears and they were exceptionally good. This is a great winter tart recipe and I will definitely make this again.

I gotta say for the work (minimal), this is one good looking, tasty tart. I baked up some individual sized tarts featuring a single pear. Hot stuff.

I was so excited to make this once reading the rave reviews, but was extremely dissapointed!! It was not worth the time and effort. It was not even appealing to the eye, very bland looking. I followed the recipe to the letter, but was very deflated when I took a piece.

This was fabulous! I replaced the hazlenuts with 1 cup almond meal, omitted the apricot glaze and used butter instead of shortening for the shell. It also took a little longer in the over. Amazing!!

I used roasted almonds instead of hazelnuts due to an allergy. I think the pears could be sauteed in pear liquer prior to baking.

Made it for Thanksgiving. Lovely! I didn't have quite enough hazelnuts so added some almonds to make up the difference..also used an extra pear. The finished product tastes as good as it looks.

Have made this twice and each time I varied the recipe and had great results. The first variance was using part orange extract and part almond extract instead of all almond extract. The second time I made it for a friend who has egg and wheat allergies. I omitted the tart shell completely. The filling made its own shell which was a bit crumbly but excellent anyways. When the ring was taken off the tart pan you couldn't tell that it didn't have a tart shell. I also subsituted black walnut and orange extracts instead of the almond extract. The other changes were to replace the wheat flour with 1/4 cup rice flour, replace the eggs with 1/4 cup of pureed canned pears with 1/4 tsp each of baking soda and baking powder to leaven. This version turned out just as wonderful as the first tart. A great dessert for someone with these kinds of food allergies.

made this last night with now in-season (in california) bartletts. left out the vanilla and just used almond extract and used almonds instead of hazelnuts. served it with sour cream that i blended with sugar and rum to taste. the results were a blissful combo.

I am a novice cook and pulled this off well, greatly impressing my new Italian husband who is an amazing cook. It tastes fantastic. I made it with a puff pastry shell just b-c i am a beginner. It was fine but I would buy a regular ready made pie shell for a shortcut next time because the puff pastry made the tart hard to cut.

This is a very good but very mild tasting tart. I made it for the day before Thanksgiving dinner and everyone said how terrific it was but personally I feel it's a better sweet for a breakfast or brunch event. That said, I substituted almonds for the hazelnuts as well, and used amaretto liquer in place of the almond extract. I also found that I only needed two pears (four halves) for the size of the pan. It turned out very nice, especially considering this was the first tart I've ever made. Presentation wise, this is *exceptional*. It's stunning, like something a professional bakery would produce, and my family oo'd and ahh'd over it. I would make it again for a brunch or for an awe-inspiring gift, for sure.

I, too substituted almonds for hazelnuts. The tart was served with fresh whipped cream (with a dash of sugar and ground cardamum) and chopped, dried apricots were sprinkled on top for a final touch! The flavors all worked wonderfully together!

This was a beautiful and tasty dessert. I used a combination of toasted almonds and walnuts instead of hazelnuts and served it with a vanilla custard sauce.

One thing threw me as I was measuring ingredients: cold, softened butter? How can one have both? I used softened butter since that made more sense to me. I also did everything in the cuisinart, which worked out great. I also used a 9" tart pan so two pears was really enough and I used frangelico in place of the almond extract as people have suggested below. The tart itself is delicious and easy.

I found this recipe when it was published in the 2001 Thanksgiving issue of Gourmet. I thought it was a very attractive dessert, so I made it for that Thanksgiving. It turned out very pleasing to both the eye and the palate. I have made many of these since, all just as pretty, and I've never heard a negative comment. I think I've found a new holiday tradition to add to the old standards! I've served this for two Thanksgivings and two Christmases now, and I've given about a dozen as gifts, and they have all turned out beautifully. For gifts, I use an aluminum cake pan for ease (not a pie tin with the slanted sides), and increase the amount of frangipane to fill. For us at home, though, I always use the fluted tart pan with the removeable bottom so it looks just as pretty as can be. I use just barely ripe pears (bosc, anjou...red or green) and if I open the oven and see that the pears haven't lightly browned yet, I leave it in. My old oven is so funky that I never follow the temp/time recommendations in recipes... instead I cook by experience, feel, look. Sometimes the pears are juicier than others so I have needed to dab some pooled liquid off the top of the tart, which I do about 10 minutes before removing from the oven so the frangipane under the liquid has a chance to surface-cook a little. As a ginger lover, I think I'll take a hint from Meg's improvisation, and add a little ginger to the strained apricot preserves... next time... and there will be a next time...

Very good. I left out the almond extract. Used a smaller tart pan, and just had enough filling. Pears Must be ripe (next time I'll try poaching them).Took longer to cook crust which was great. Thought nuts were finely ground, but they still had "texture" to them in frangipane.

Rating: 4
Excellent tart. Even though I've never been the biggest fan of hazelnuts, the flavors blend extremely well. I reduced the almond extract to 1/4 tsp., as recommended, and it was beauteous and excellent. Rich, buttery, with a nice nutty flavor (I had to talk myself out of having a slice for breakfast). Great w/ Hagen Daas Vanilla ice cream. Next time I'll grind the nuts a little more finely, but otherwise, DE-vine.

Rating: 3
I liked this tart BECAUSE it's not a sweet concoction; however, I thought the frangipane could have been a little more flavorful. Next time I plan to add Hazelnut liquor instead of almond extract. And I might even increase the amount of filling to balance the pears. (Since I come from Oregon, the pears (local) are intensely good this time of year,)

While toasting my hazelnuts I forgot about them and they burned, so I substituted with ground almonds. The Tart Pastry was amazingly flaky and really buttery, but the tart looked dull and the white pears blended into the grey Frangipane.

I have been baking my boyfriend a pie or a tart every week since we have been together...& this tart went over as one of the top 3 desserts I have ever made... I agree the ALMOND taste is very strong (but good) and I even cut it to 1/4 tea-spoon... Next time I might cut it to a drop or two but even at 1/4 teasppon it was great... I mixed ginger preserves into the fruit preserves and it added a nice touch to the glaze...this is delicious and easy to make!

It's not hard to make. Easy, in fact. But it's time-consuming. A good dessert to bring if you're not making the dinner, too. I made it for Christmas, and it was so good and so gorgeous I made it again for New Years (different crowd). It may become my standard WOW! dessert.

I made this for Christmas Day and everyone loved it plus it was beautiful even though it didn't look like the picture. I actually made it a day ahead thinking I would serve it on Christmas Eve so now I know it can be made ahead without compromising the flavor or appearance. I like the idea of the Frangelico so may try that next time.

I wish I had paid more attention to the reviews. The tart was excellent but definitely overpowered by the almond extract. I would cut in half or eliminate altogether next time. The pastry was difficult to work with but nice & flaky so worth the fuss. It presents really well too, and tastes as good as it looks.

What a beautiful dessert. My only disappointment was the wonderful hazelnut flavor was overpowered by the almond flavoring and my guests all thought it was almond paste. My next attempt will be with Frangelica that I have heated and burned off the alcohol to strengthen the flavor. The tart crust was wonderful and wonderful to work with. Don't be intimidated by some of the previous ratings. This recipe is worth the effort. Just prepare as directed and sit back and take your compliments. My dessert was highly complimented and delicious.

I really hate to give anything a 4 but 3 just didn't do it. Was concerned about pre-baking tart shell as directed before filling and pears were added but followed directions and it was perfect. Took to a dinner party and everyone kept raving about what a fabulous dessert it was. It looked and tasted so wonderful that I felt like a real patissière!

Made this tart for Thanksgiving (30 plus family and friends) and am still receiving compliments.I had leftover jellied sugar syrup (from poaching pears and quinces with spices a week earlier) and used that to glaze the pears. It looked beautiful, too, as if it came from an (actual) French bakery.

This tart was outstanding -- gorgeous, sophisticated, delicious and not overly sweet! The crust is fabulous -- buttery and flaky. While it's a bit difficult to work with, it's definitely worth the trouble. I baked the tart Thanksgiving morning and while it was very good that day, we found it was even better the next day! The flavors had time to mellow and blend together and to my amazement, the crust stayed very crisp and flaky. Make sure your pears are perfectly ripe. Mine weren't, so I poached the halves in a very light sugar syrup flavored with a little vanilla and lemon until they were easily pierced with a skewer. Came out great, and don't throw away the syrup; strain, refrigerate and use it to sweeten hot or iced tea. Yum. Brushed the baked pears with a little melted apple jelly (had no apricot preserves). Tasted great; looked beautiful.

To reduce or eliminate the grainy nature of the hazelnuts, simply roast them slower and longer to eliminate some of their moisture. Be careful not to burn them, but they taste good with a little color, too.

To a cook from Minneapolis, I've seen it done both ways, but I think it's best to pre-bake the crust, at least part of the way. When I've made this without blind-baking the crust, the crust turns out soggy. I would prepare the crust as the recipe says, but bake it for only the initial 20 minutes, then let it cool, fill it, and return it to the oven.

A very disappointing dish. The crust was great, and the presentation wonderful -- but I also found the hazelnuts to be grainy, and the pears undercooked. Lots of other wonderful things to choose from next Thanksgiving...

Very nice tart looked great and tasted great. I particularly liked this crust, easy and very crisp and buttery.

The tart shell was just fine with prior baking; but if you think that yours is starting to look brown you just need to put a narrow strip of tinfoil around the edge to stop it from browning further. The toasted hazelnut 'butter' was delish with the pears and the attached pastry recipe is one of the best I've ever found. Hope you enjoy it! To the cook from Salem: calling names is downright unkind. Everyone should be able to enjoy the site without fear of beating. After all, we all make mistakes!

Rating: 0
A quick, silly question. Do you bake the tart shell completely, as the tart shell directions state, prior to baking the tart with the filling? Does the edge get overly browned if you do bake it prior? I'm looking forward to making this, but I don't want to ruin the pastry!

Rating: 3
I loved this recipe. The pastry crust was a little difficult to work with, but the effort was well worth it. The Hazelnut filling is "to die for", but be sure to use completely ripe pears. I topped it off with a little whipping cream laced with almond flavor, or you could a drop or two of Frangelico to the cream during beating. Hal, your comments made me take this on as a challenge. Thank you - My well travelled, discerning family loved it.

A little work, but nothing too complicated, and I was very happy with the results. Three pears seem too much, so I cut down to two, but I think that next time I'll use all three, and layer the pears a bit.

Hal-- it's a pity you misread the recipe; you must be new to epicurious.
