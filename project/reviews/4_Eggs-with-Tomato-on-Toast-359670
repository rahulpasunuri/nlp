This recipe was so delicious and easy! I added a chopped onion to the garlic saute and mixed in Sriracha into the tomato sauce. I used diced tomatos instead of whole and dried basil. I didn't separate the eggs and just put them into the mixture whole so it comes out much more like a poached egg. It was really delicious on sourdough bread. This would be great for an easy group breakfast. Definitely making this again!

This was really delicious and filling! Mine started looking a little pink when I added the egg whites-maybe i stirred them too much. I also didn't have any fresh basil so I added green onion, and threw in a bit of fresh thyme with the oregano.

excellent and very easy. I would try better quality bread next time.
