I've made these for years and they're always a hit. I make them in advance, freeze them, and then bake frozen for a few extra minutes. I've struggled with the cornet shape, but think I'm going for half-rounds this year.

I made 100 of these for a party recently and they were consumed in minutes. Just a few notes that may help others: - Did not make cornets but turnovers instead - as did many other people. Use a 2 1/2 in diameter cookie cutter and 3 sheets of puff pastry rolled as thin as possible without tearing.(Pepperidge Farm is OK) Smaller than 2 1/2 in are very difficult to fill/seal and larger will reduce the yield too much. - Use one lb of shrimps and be careful to not overfill the turnovers. Less that 1/2 tsp. - butter the cookie sheets generously - did not have tarragon so used 1 tsp of herbs de provence instead. - add 1/2 tsp of cayenne and season shrimp mixture generously with salt and pepper - use convection oven set at 375 degrees if possible to avoid rotating the cookie sheets. - you can make the filling one day ahead and keep covered in the fridge (don't freeze) Fiddly but worth the effort!

Very good but modified: used 'fake crab'and mini, pre-baked puff pastry shells; needed a dash of Worchestershire sauce in the mix; I left out the salt because I put grated cheese on top. Obviously left out milk and egg. Baked at 350 for about 5min - just long enough to warm the filling and melt the cheese.

Do you freeze them after they have been cooked and then reheat them?

a little putzy--but not hard--the finished product was way better than the sum of its parts--seemed too simple to be this good. Rich-elegant, simple-very good!!

Fantastic! 8 people devoured all 48 pieces in about 5 minutes. Be sure to use all-butter puff pastry (available at gourmet markets) for unbelievable flavor. The filling is simple yet a classic, delicious combination of flavors and I wouldn't change a thing.

Excellent recipe, very sophisticated, subtle flavoring. I always serve these, after everyone seems contently satiated, they are usually the final hors' doeuvre at my cocktail parties and they instantly disappear- In fact, the guests impatiently await the cooling period when I pull the second round from the oven! Very important that you use quality sheryy, mild onion, fresh tarragon and I personally add a touch of Hungarian Paprika and Freshly ground White Pepper to add a hint of piquant.

I know this is probably a silly question but do you cook the shrimp first and then mix with the rest of the ingredients?

These are fantastic--people always ask me to make them for parties and they're snapped up right away. They're kind of time-consuming, but at least you can make them in advance and freeze them.

A really great finger food... they fly off the plate. They freeze well too. Fold them in rounds as mentioned previously - or in squares folded on the diagonal. Never really got the cornet shape, but who cares about the shape when it tastes so good?

I also made these from cut-out rounds, which was easy. But frankly the flavor didn't overwhelm me, although they were gobbled up. I added the prosciutto for flavor, but it still needs something.

Made these for another party yesterday. Decided to follow another reviewers recommendation and just cut out rounds from the puff pastry. This worked much better. To add a little flair, after folding and sealing the rounds, I used the end of a fork and pressed all around the seal. This made for an appetizing look. I tried the prosciutto idea, as well as sliding some feta cheese into some just to try it--in this case, I think the people at Gourmet got it right: don't mess with it! I give it four forks this time, with the change in the shape of the pastry. Plus, it's perfect for preparing ahead of time. I plan to try to keep some of these in the freezer for impromptu guests. Definite winner, and impressive to your guests.

These are definitely worth the effort. They are absolutely delicious and making them in advance is always a great option. Took them to a luncheon and they were gone in a minute. Eveyone asked for the recipe.

Somewhat time intensive, but well worth it. The beauty of this recipe is that the bulk of the work can be done ahead of time, then frozen. I made this 2 days ahead, froze it, then continued on. FANTASTIC. These were gone within minutes. You can save a great deal of time by using a round cookie cutter and place the filling in the round pastry, fold it over and crimp it, like an empanada. It may not be as visually striking, but still eye catching, and much less time consuming.

I tried this for appetizers for Thanksgiving. They were tasty, and different, and featuring shrimp and puff pastry they're almost automatically a hit. I thought they'd be nice with a little bit of pancetta or prosciutto would be nice in there too. The nice thing about a recipe like this is that it gives you ideas of other things to try. One thing: I did have trouble figuring out exactly how to create the "cornet" shape, but any old shape you can make with this should work out fine.
