These were good, and very pretty, but not as flavorful as I had hoped. I would add more Dijon next time.

These straight-forward deviled eggs are fun and delicious. The time consuming part was peeling the eggs. One site I found suggested tapping each end of the egg, peeling a small circle in each end, and then blowing hard into each of the ends. This did seem to make peeling somewhat easier. I plan on using this recipe in the future and look forward to using it as a jumping-off point to experiment further.

We used to say fettucini alfredo was a heart attack on a plate. I'd think these eggs are as well. Not the incredible taste that one would hope to justify the mayo, butter and bacon fat. Will pass on this one.
