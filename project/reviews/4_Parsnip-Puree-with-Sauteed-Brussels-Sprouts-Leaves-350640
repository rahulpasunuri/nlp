Ever since stumbling across this recipe 3 years ago, it has become a go-to side dish for the holidays or for when company is coming over. It's beautiful to look at and ridiculously tasty (and easy). Change absolutely nothing. I've yet to meet a person who didn't like it.

Exceptional. Definitely fancy dinner party worthy. I wouldn't change a thing to the recipe.

This parsnip puree is insanely delicious and a light alternative to mashed potatoes- which everyone at our dinner appreciated after so many heavy TDay meals. Great thing is you can use the puree as a base and add different things. I've made it with the brussel sprouts which were fine, but last night I made it with fried sage leaves instead and made the brussel sprout and carrot recipe from this site alongside. Big hit!

This is good but it's really nothing special. The brussel sprouts alone are a more interesting recipe when you braise and season them.

Excellent. Sauteed thin sliced red cabbage instead of brussel sprout leaves to top it off.

This recipe hit's that sweet spot of quick, easy and delicious. The real star is the parsnip puree which is surprisingly complex and satisfying. Much like good mashed potatoes, you can cheat on the whole milk and butter and it will still taste good, but it also won't be as good as the real deal. I think the slight green bite of the Brussels sprouts is the perfect and necessary compliment to the sweetness of the parsnips. The preparation there (peeling the leaves) seems almost gimmicky. Because it does look nice - and is super tasty - but I'd rather they had a little more mouthfeel to contrast the soft puree and quarter them myself. But definitely try this recipe.

Served this with rack of lamb. Family loved it. Parsnips will be on our table more often because of this recipe.

i used almond milk as i didn't have regular whole milk, but otherwise followed the ingredients and recipe. i'm not sure if i cooked the Brussels sprouts correctly--they seemed a maybe a bit too soggy sitting on top of the warm puree by the time this was served. it was delicious, though. the puree itself was so tasty and soft. this was my first time eating parsnips, and i was so pleased. i also think the almond milk gave it a hint of sweetness. this was so good paired with a bite of Tofurkey dumplings.

I really enjoyed this recipe and was a bit surprised at how mild the usual "parsnip" flavor was. Certainy I could tell it was there, but it wasn't as prominent as roasted parsnips are. Subbed soy milk creamer for whole milk and omitted brussels. Very easy to with handheld blender so I could just keep everything in the pot. Served with grilled chicken flavored wih mccormicks grill mates spicy montreal steak seasoning. Thought the spicy of the chicken went splendidly with the mild, smooth sweetness of parsnip puree.

Delicious! This was ridiculously easy to make (though my boyfriend got a bit bored of peeling the brussels sprouts leaves). Who knew that parsnips would come out so light, smooth and creamy? With the natural sweetness and texture of the puree agains the salty, soft crunch of the sprouts, it made a perfect juxtaposition. Not to mention how pretty it looks! This will definitely make it into the regular rotation of easy but impressive holiday dishes. It's also a great one to make if you're bringing a dish with you as it could be served at room temperature and still be delicious.

Very good! Easy to do ahead. Delicious with the brussels and a nice complement to turkey.

Delicious and easy! Just like making mashed potatoes. I had to cook the parsnips a bit longer than 20 minutes as I wanted to be sure they could be mashed by a hand mixer. I didn't top them with the brussels sprout leaves since it seemed more like a garnish than an integral part of the dish. Didn't miss them at all. Will definitely make these again when parsnips are on hand.

everyone loved this dish. I will definitely make this again and will probably serve it at Thanksgiving.

These were excellent, but I made a small mistake. Thought I had parsnips and then realized they were turnips. Did not matter as the dish was delicious.

I thought it was just so, so. Interesting taste, but just kinda boring. look forward to seeing other comments.

Flawless! Almost the best dish of the entire dinner. My boyfriend made this and it was super silky in texture and the sautéed brussel sprouts give it the perfect bitter/burnt/salty edge that enhances the parsnips' flavor. I think I found a new favorite vegetable!
