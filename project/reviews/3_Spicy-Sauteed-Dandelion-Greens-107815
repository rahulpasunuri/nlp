Followed the recipe exactly, using farmer's market dandelion green's. Maybe I'm merely rating the greens, because I couldn't ignore the bitterness. Taking bites of the smashed garlic helped make the medicine go down at least.

This recipe saved the day. Thank you for writing it. I weeded, saved my dandelions out from among the weeds, and decided to try sauteing them. I don't like them fresh. This was great--I had everything on hand (unlike recipes calling for bacon, lemon juice, etc.) Lucky me! Not to mention, it was scaleable (I wouldn't have opened a whole pack of bacon for a handful of greens anyway). Now I'm eating my weeds. (I didn't boil them to save dishes and nutrients, but I can stand the bitterness when I tell myself I'm being healthy.)

Delicious! A great recipe for dandelion greens. Boiling them first is essential to the success of this recipe. I added salt, garlic and a few splashes of lemon juice to the final stage of this recipe and it was simply perfect.

This recipe tastes just like spinach except it was a little bitter - but tasty. Not sure if it is worth the work to pick the dandelions for an everyday meal, but this would definitley wow a dinner party.

I also added crimini mushrooms, shallots, and crushed heirloom tomatoes with a little white wine to the sautee. It was delicious and not too bitter but I boiled them in lots of water first. You can boil them longer if you are afraid they are too bitter just don't boil them until they turn brown.

To the reviewer who complained that the dish was bitter: that's why you have to boil the dandelions first. Omitting this step will guarantee excessive bitterness. Also, you could use the commercially available "Italian dandelions" instead of the common lawn variety--they are much less bitter.

Very good side dish for an Italian meal featuring grilled chicken. Spiciness can be decreased for those who prefer, without harming the overall effect. Be careful not to overcook.

Very good; different. We followed the recipe but, did not boil the greens first (does that make a big difference?). Dandelions are very bitter, as in very bitter. But, we added a little lemon juice towards the end and, a bit of fresh grated parmesan at the table. Likely a very good side dish for a rich entree. Would make again. We got ours at the Green Market and, since they are seasonal, they are certainly worth cooking in season. One caveat, there are many little stems and they do take time to remove both when washing and in the pan.

The most difficult part of this recipe is picking the blades of grass out the 2 lbs. of greens if harvested from your own pesticide, herbicide-free lawn. It's a tasty, simple recipe and worthy of incorporating into your celebration of "Spring is Finally Here!" recipes. (I'm certain it would be good tossed with some orechietti or other pasta, along with some toasted pine nuts and a sprinkle of reggiano).

This is how I prepare my greens but I usually use less oil. Definitely use lots of garlic and crushed red pepper. I also use escarole, chickory, arugula or broccoli rabe. Great stuff. Leftover greens are delicious in a quesadilla or on a sandwich.

I use this same recipe with spinach. It's super quick and easy. No excuse to let spinach go bad in the fridge.

Perfect way to control dandelion population for those that don't use pesticides. I start with a large finely sliced onion fried in the olive oil till almost caramellized, then add the garlic etc. Skip the pepper flakes and substitute a squeeze of fresh lemon for mediterranian variation.

Yum! This was very easy and good tasting, with no bitterness whatsoever. My dandelion -- one of those 27" tall types -- was freshly harvested and organic so that may be a factor. I replaced the red pepper flakes with cayenne, which was on hand. So good I'll try it next with arugula!
