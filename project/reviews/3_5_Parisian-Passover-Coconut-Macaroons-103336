I found that this recipe worked best if you let the coconut absorb the meringue, sugar mix for several hours or over night. I also added another cup and half of coconut. I used a small pastry scoop (from Target) to scoop small balls onto a baking stone sprayed with butter. I then sprayed the top of the balls with a little of the butter spray (kosher parve) and put in the oven for 20 minutes at 350 instead of 325. The macaroons looked perfect and tasted great!

FYI- Whole Foods has unsweetened coconut. I gave this 3 forks since most people at our dinner really loved the lightness of these cookies but honestly they didn't thrill me at all. I followed the instructions exactly and they were really easy to make - I don't have a candy thermometer and just simmered the syrup for a few minutes after it boiled and they came out well. They sort of taste like homemade marshmallows with coconut in them. I ended up dipping the bottoms of half the batch in a dark chocolate and the additional flavor/texture of the chocolate made them much better in my opinion. I won't be making these again but if you do make them I would at least add a bit of vanilla.

These are light as air and as riverdalecook says, ethereal. Very light and lovely, good after a big meal. (I used reduced fat coconut and I think that's why mine were a tad dry.) If you are looking to make dense, chewy, moist macaroons, this is not the recipe. These macaroons are elegant and fluffy. This is a very easy recipe; easier than it seems.

totally fabulous, completely fun to make. I bet these would be wonderful with chocolate chips (minis) and or chopped pecans. Perhaps even some vanilla. One comment-the recipe made 40 cookies not 60...or maybe I just made mine too big, but boy are they tasty!

This is ethereal food at its best.

Great recipe - it even impressed my mother-in-law :) My sister and I made this last year, with no thermometer, never having made sugar syrup or meringue before. We got great results following the recipe as written, except for using sweetened dessicated coconut because we couldn't find the other kind.

I couldn't find unsweetened coconut, so I used sweetened, and it was still delicious.

These were very interesting to make (watching the hot syrup combine w/ the egg whites was wild) but the results, I thought were a little disappointing. They were tasty, but, in my opinion, tasted EXACTLY like an Almond Joy candy bar--not the result I was after!

I served these treats for Pesach along with a flourless chocolate cake and fresh strawberry puree. They were fantastic! I don't have a candy thermometer but boiled the syrup without stirring for about ten minutes. My children liked them so much, they asked if we could make them even when it's not Passover.

I made these for passover and people were gushing. I found that following the recipe put me in good stead, although I wasn't really sure how long it would take me to boil the sugar and water to the right temperature, so my egg whites were whipped long before the syrup was ready (thankfully, it didn't impare the results). I used parchment paper on the cookie sheets instead of matzo cake meal, and I improvised when the cookies were done by melting dark chocolate on the double boiler, and half-dipping the macaroons in choclate, followed by a quick dip in the coconut flakes. It produced elegant results.

Last year, I tried to change this recipe to use it to make plain meringues. (My parents won't eat coconut, and I thought I could just leave it out and bake.) It was a big mess! The cookies were limp and gloopy. I think the Amsterdam cook is right that these need to be baked longer--and I would not recommend that anyone try what I did!

Heavenly! The egg whites can also be beaten with a whisk. Add a dash of salt at the start and secure the bowl with a slightly damp tea towel twisted around the base. I baked them slightly longer than twelve minutes, however converting celcius to fahrenheit usually results in slight variations on baking times.
