I love this recipe! The lemongrass paste makes a great crust and is also good with pork.

This recipe is fabulous--be sure to use fresh (not dried) ingredients. (Double the lemongrass.)

For a grilling marinade that needs to be precooked, this is just not that great. Not worth the effort.

A very tasty recipe. Works great done on the bbq. I would recommend a green salad and a cucumber raita to go with this dish.

nuwbeads from San Diego, this photo is a mistake-- it is of a veal chop with mushroom sauce from the same page in this month's Gourmet Magazine (the article is about chops). Other than that, this is a lovely recipe (as is the veal chop with mushroom sauce, for that matter...)

You add the herbs where it tells you to! After you spoon the lime sauce on you then sprinkle the dish with herbs. Also, the picture is beautiful, you could add mushrooms to this but I think we should just say, "pretty picture along side a comparable recipe". The recipe is quite delicious. I had never thought to use lemongrass in this manner before. I will again.

I haven't made this recipe so it's not fair of me to judge but where in the instructions does it tell you when to add the mint, cilantro and basil? Why is there a picture of mushroom sauce??
