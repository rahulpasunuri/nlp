Very nice vegetarian side or main course. I made it for a friends BBQ and it was the first side gone.

This is a great dish to make for a back-yard barbecue for company. It is very tasty and pretty easy to make.

I made this recipe in a cast iron grill pan. It needed more zing, so I added more Worcestshire sauce to it which helped it immensely.
