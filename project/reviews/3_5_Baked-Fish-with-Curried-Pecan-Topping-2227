We really enjoyed this recipe. Before cooking I read the reviews which was helpful. I decided to reduce the curry powder and cumin by 25%, also I used salmon because I felt a more delicate flavored fish could be overpowered by the topping. It was delicious, I'll definitely make it again.

Very good as is. Very easy once you make the pecan sauce. Went well with couscous and small green salad.

To those reviewers who complain the fish is over-powered: what would you expect from a breaded, curried, baked fish recipe? This is the perfect recipe for that cheap, frozen tilapia you have in the back of your freezer. For the breading: double the garlic, triple the onion, halve the cumin and add 1/4 cup chopped cilantro. Serve the fish over a bed of rice and top it with a salsa made of finely chopped red onions (marinated in lemon juice), diced tomatoes and chopped cilantro.

Well, I can honestly say this crumb topping is delicious! Although it could have been baked over an old shoe for all the taste that came through of the bass. Totally overwhelmed the fish, way too rich. Although, come to think of it, this may be the perfect way to get a seafood hater to eat fish. Hey honey, look, you cant even taste it!

Rich! The pecans add substantial body to this dish, making it quite the statement. Liked the flavor a lot and appreciated that it was so different than what I usually cook. After reading others' comments about it perhaps being too dry, I used salmon. It was definately moist and rich. Next time, I might try swordfish or tuna.

OK so here is the story, everyone loved this recipe except me! I searched all over to find this recipe and I will make it again only because every one begs me for it! Maybe the taste will grow on me?

Nice! I used perch caught last summer instead of sea bass (it was in the freezer, and I'm uncomfortable supporting the overfishing of the Chilean sea bass)...beyond that, I didn't change a thing. My 4-yr old loved it & helped herself to more!

Wonderful! Used sea bass, slightly less curry, and lemon wedge on the side. Served with roasted sweet potatoes and asparagus. This recipe is a KEEPER!

Although slightly time consuming, it turned out wonderful. I am partial to sauces, and I personally would have made one but the rest of the guests didn't think it needed any sauce. I never use store bought curry, instead I make my own from the array of spices that are found in 'real' curry. Much better. I would make this again!

I substituted just over one pound of salmon. I made the same amount of topping--maybe a few more bread crumbs! I paired it with curried rice with raisins. My husband and I loved it!

Very good dish. Pretty easy, though I also felt it was more time consuming that implied. (I don't get home til well after 7pm so I don't have a lot of time) . I substituted snapper and it worked well save for not having enough topping to get a good coating on all the fish. I would double the topping next time for sure. I also made a yogurt dressing to go with. I highly recommend something like that for a little extra added flavor. I mixed plain yogurt with crushed ginger and mango chutney but you could try another combo. Served it with couscous with scallions, raisins and cinnamon. Very nice.

This dish was suprisingly good, but a sauce would have made it better. I substituted vegetable oil with toasted sesame oil and skipped the cayenne pepper. I forgot to mix in the bread crumb, but I didn't miss it. I would make this dish again because of the easy prep work and short cooking time, and the mild flavor.

Incredibly quick to prepare. We didn't use the oil, and it was still delicious.

sucks. tasteless.

This is our all-time favorite fish dish. We add more breadcrumbs and tone down the curry if pairing it with side dishes with complex flavors (such as asparagus). Other times we make it as-is with mango chutney on the side and serve with couscous or rice pilaf. We served this for Thanksgiving for the non-turkey-eaters. A big hit!

THIS IS NOT A GOOD MAKE AHEAD DISH. We used Tilapia and it was bone dry and BLAND. We may try it again and serve it immediately.

Love this recipe!!! It's so easy that I make it all the time. I don't like Sea Bass for I often substitute Tilapia or Snapper. Excellent over rice with green beans. It's a great recipe to reduce if you're cooking for one.

This was a very pleasing meal, I used red snapper which worked well. To improve this recipe next time I would leave the pecans chunkier than finely chopped. I also added plum chutney on the side to moisten up the dish. All around it was a hit.

Made this with monkfish fillets which were thick, lobster-like, and juicy, so had to cook slightly longer. The topping was nice, but not all that exciting. My bland-palate parents loved it, my adventurous-eating husband did not. I _might_ make it again, but with a lot more spices, and with a little bit of a curry cream sauce to go over the fish. Don't know what the other reviewer was talking about--the giant plus in favor of this dish is that it _is_ incredibly quick to prepare.

Delicious, if deceptively time-consuming. I found the dish doesn't come together QUITE as quickly as mentioned; there's a lot of prep work to get out of the way. I've made this several times. But I've learned to do my prep work well in advance!

Excellent. For a few of our guests we substituted tofu for the fish. (The tofu takes just a few minutes to bake.)

I have already reviewed this once before but I have made it several times since. I now serve it with fried bananas and a mango chutney on the side which really complements the dish. It is probably our favorite fish recipe. I recommend it highly.

I've made this many times, with a few adjustments - instead of using bread crumbs, I prefer "panko" - it's a crispier, tastier Japanese bread crumb, used for tempura, etc. The plain bread crumbs work fine, but if you can find it, the panko adds a nice touch!

Love this dish!!! Have made it several times. The key is in the ingredients. Use fresh french bread and make your own crumbs. The fish needs to be fresh. Be generous with the bread crumbs and pecans, it mellows the curry flavor. Enjoy!!!

My partner says it deserves 10 forks. I made half recipe for two - but probably had more than half the topping amount. My sea bass fillets were a bit thicker than 1 1/4 inches and it took a total of about 20 minutes. Fortunately I always check with a thermometer and didn't serve until they reached 140 in center.

I substituted escolar for the sea bass and it was great. I found the French bread crumbs gave a lot of texture to the fish and made a better "presentation."

I was skeptical about the recipe from the start, but tried it anyway. In my opinion, the seasonings, especially the curry, overpower the sweet, delicate flavor of sea bass. Also, I needed to increase the cooking time by about 8 minutes. I'd suggest using a different fish.

My husband doesn't usually like fish but he loves this. I served it with a lemon dill suace and it was fantastic. Easy to prepare, too!

I used grouper and it was excellent except that next time I may double the topping recipe so the fish is completely covered.

This was an excellent recipe. I made it with escolar instead of sea bass and it was delicious. Also added a pinch of sugar to the pecan mixture after tasting it - I think that helped the flavor. Fabulous dish - have made it twice already in the last two weeks.

Guests loved it! Fantastic Would use non-stick spray on pan next time, was a bear to clean up. Fish also took longer to cook than what recipe said.

he sea bass plumped up and the topping got crisp. This easy to make recipe was a hit with my family and I will make it agin for friends or another special occasion
