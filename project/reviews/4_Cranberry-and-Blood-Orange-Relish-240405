I used clementines instead and it turned out very well! Definitely a favorite and tastes great served over cheeses like Brie.

I have made this several times, and it is always well received. i use regular oranges and add some (1 fruit worth) pomegranate seeds to the mix.

I can't say I really made this because I wasn't able to find blood oranges, but it was otherwise very tasty. I gave the recipe to my brother to bring to the meal and he was concerned with the amount of liquid and undisolved sugar, but it all worked out in the end and everyone enjoyed an uncooked cranberry relish.

This has a very refreshing taste. I would put in a little less sugar next time as I feel the sweetness masked the fruit flavors to some extent.

I used several different kinds of oranges and it turned into pure deliciousness!

So easy, and I liked the tartness. I just used regular oranges.
