This was great! The vanilla really adds richness to the flavor without changing the texture. I only used 1/3 cup sugar, which made the sweetness more like coffee with sugar than like coffee ice cream. Also, let it cool for an hour or two before you put it in the freezer.

forn those who have not made granita before, this is a great intro to a technique that you can take far (think campari and grapefruit, or yuzu and midori). A reall beautiful, elegant dessert that takes litle effort and no special equipment. i use espresso crystals for speed and consistency, and often spike it with bourbon. serve with barely sweetened whipped cream and chocolate shavings.
