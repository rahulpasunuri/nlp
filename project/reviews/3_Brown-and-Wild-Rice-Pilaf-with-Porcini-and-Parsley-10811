Nice pilaf; good combination of textures with the crunchiness of the wild rice and softness of the porcini.

I'd never made a dish with wild rice before, but found this one to be easy and very satisfying. I did use less dried porcini than the recipe called for (3/4 oz), and the flavor seemed just right.

Very good with Roasted Rack of Venison and Shallots with Dried-Cranberry Gravy, also on this site.

I thought this was very boring. Perhaps using broth instead of water would give it more flavor, but as is (and I followed the recipe exactly) I would not make it again.

This is a master recipe that can be augmented. I was in a hurry & had only 1/2 oz of porcini. I used 1 T butter & 1 T olive oil in the rice cooker and squished 4 cloves of garlic in and let that saute then added brown basmati, soaked wild rice, water, salt, and chopped soaked porcinis and liquid all at once. It was great! Next time want to try as written then start variations green onion, dried cranberries etc.

This is a delicious pilaf type dish with complex flavours and an interesting texture. I had only half an ounce of porcini mushrooms on hand to use in this dish but they were more than adequate. I also added a mushroom stock cube from my local Italian market.

A little bland, I drizzled some lemon juice on top for a little zing, but there's a really good taste and texture.
