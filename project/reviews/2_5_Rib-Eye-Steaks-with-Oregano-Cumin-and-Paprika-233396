This was good! The sauce certainly has a flavor you either like or don't like but my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it. We plan to try it again, backing off a little bit on the cumin to see if it balances the flavors a little more evenly. Have some bread to catch the extra sauce! Yum!

Yeah, so, this was not good. There are many good steak options, but this is not one to bother with

Very good indeed. This one had the family going back to the pan with bread to mop up every last drop of the sauce. The only variation I introduced was to slice the steaks diagonally across the vein and trim off some fat (AFTER cooking), then dress the steak slices with the sauce. Overall not spectacular, but definitely a keeper.
