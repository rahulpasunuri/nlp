This is a nice way to use extra beets during the warmer months. I only used 1 tbls of vinegar because I am not a huge vinegar fan. The only other suggestion is to add croutons - this adds a little texture to the soup. My husband does not like beets but ate a whole plate of this soup - with the croutons.

If you're a juicer, take the leftover pulp from beets, beet greens & celery then simmer with the other ingredients listed. After blender step, we garnished with sour cream, horse radish & fresh dill. Used stevia instead of sugar for a healthy, organic soup treat!

This was delicious and so pretty. I served it in wine glasses.

This was simply and yummy! I didn't thin out the soup and I'm glad. I also had it warm and really enjoyed it. A great use of beets in an easy, quick way!

This soup was wonderful. I hate to admit this but I used canned beats for lack of fresh ones. I imagine it is much better with the fresh beats. Like many other reviewers I also served it hot and it was a hit. I can't wait for the chilled left overs tommorow.

Didn't think to try it hot; I will have to give that a go. Very good chilled, I thought. The beet and celery flavours went well together and were nicely balanced. Much more than a mere beet purée.

Very good served warm. I have not tried it cold. A little sour cream makes it. I think only people who like beets would like this one though. Everyone at work wrinkles up their noses when I bring it.

I noticed after making the soup that the 3 previous reviewers ate the soup hot. I ate it cold after a night in the fridge. It was nothing more than pureed beets. The leaves, cooked as greens, were much better than the soup.

I served this hot, topped with a dollup of creme fraiche and chopped fresh chives. It was very pretty, and everyone loved it! It freezes well, too.

WOW. this soup was amazing, despite a blender disaster i had which ruined about half the batch (plastic lid piece fell into the blender... ugh). i had celery and beets in the fridge and found this recipe. i will definitely make it again, probably for company -- it's a gorgeous soup, especially when served in white bowls. the only real change i made to the recipe was adding a cored and chopped apple, on a whim. i accidentally used too much vinegar and it turned out fine. also, i didn't really measure the onions and celery but it would have been fine with more (i used one large onion and 5 stalks of celery). also, in lieu of sour cream, i added cream into the soup just before eating (ate it hot -- couldn't resist), which was tasty as well. try this recipe -- it's different and absolutely delicious.

This was an unexpected surprise! We came home from our local Farmers' Market with a small bunch of beets. We were planning a dinner party that evening and needed a first course, so I logged on to Epicurious and found this soup. Although planning to serve it cold, time was elapsing, so I served it hot before pureeing it. I only used 6 SMALL beets - perfect. Also, I used 2 cups of onions and used homemade chicken stock from our freezer. Not only was the flavor great, but the color of the soup, garnished only with chopped chives, was spectacular. I will try the cold version too.
