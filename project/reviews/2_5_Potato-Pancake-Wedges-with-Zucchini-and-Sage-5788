way too salty and really not crispy enough.

I get rave reviews when I make this. Sour cream and applesauce are a must as side servings. I have made it on the stove top and in the oven- works either way.

Wow- SO salty! I can't believe no one else commented on this. Perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. The taste was fine, but the salt was just overpowering. It definitely need something to counteract it- sour cream or applesauce.

I had great preparation success with this recipe and the outcome was crisp and had great flavor. I think the secret to the frying is keeping the temperature medium high. After frying to a deep golden brown, per the recipe, I baked them for about 25 minutes - 10 min. longer than suggested. One pan was larger than then other and took a little longer. I let them sit at room temp. until just before serving then I heated them for about 10 minutes (400 degrees) than set them under the broiler for the golden brown finish. They were an accompaniment to the Brisket with Portobello Mushroom and Dried Cranberries - excellent meal.

Putting potatoes into all that oil and butter is, to me frying them. Unfortunately, despite frying, baking, broiling and then more baking, the so-called pancakes never got firm, much less crisp. The top never browned. If I attempt these again, I would use much less potato mixture in each pan, and would probably add some eggs and/or flour to bind the stuff together. Very disappointing.

I was very disappointed to find that this recipie calls for baking, rather than frying, the latkes. Although I am fat conscious on a regular basis, it is traditional during Hanukkah to eat fried foods, since the oil is meant to commemorate the story of Hanukkah. I shall make this recipie and deep fry every last bit of it!

Great flavor and very pretty on the plate. Portions are very, very generous so you may want to cut back on ingredient amounts.
