Made 1/2 of this recipe during the Lent season, 2007. Never reviewed it because we were not impressed. Some of the pieces of fish were mush, while others were firm, Unless I can find 3 flounder fillets of the same size and weight, I would not make this again. Also, the bread crumb topping was a total waste.

Made it as stated with two exceptions. One, I added a few cloves of chopped garlic, and two, used Pepperidge Farm cornbread stuffing mix in lieu of the breadcrumbs. Rave reviews from everyone including my kids. Served with roasted spagetti squash side and it was just AWESOME.

It was our first time having flounder and we really enjoyed this dish. Next time I would drain some of the tomato juice since the sauce was a bit runny. Otherwise, it turned out great. Served the Leek-Tomato Quinoa from this site on the side.

Went back to eating fish after a while and liked the tomato combo as it blended with a nice thin spagetti and yielded a decent side sauce. I have no clue why the bread crumbs were a part of it as they did nothing. The bacon was more benign and I did add some garlic to a combo of chopped tomatoes and homemade sauce. Not a party dish but a decent family dish, especially for fish shy kids. Other problem is not all fish fillets are equal, so some were thicker, others thinner. Don't know how to resolve that problem. I'll try it again but it did not WOW the family.

It's Lent, and hey it's nice to prepare a dish that is delicious. This was very easy. I did the bacon in the microwave, (plenty of grease for the pan), finely chopped the green pepper and used a fresh tomato with some sauce I had on hand. Very delicious!! I personally would serve to good friends as a quick no-fuss meal. Prepared this with steamed brocolli, roasted butternut squash (with cinnamon) and a green salad. What more could you ask for???

Instead of chopped tomatoes, I added Garlic flavored diced tomatoes. It added even more flavor. Recipe was simple, quick and tasty. My husband is the yardstick. I always ask if I should save the recipe and he told me it was a keeper.

This was a very nice recipe, although a bit more work than I like, considering the final result. My husband told me to leave off the bacon next time, but I thought it was okay. Not company-worthy, but good for a family dinner -- a nice way to make flounder.

The sauce for this dish was wonderful! I used yellow bell peppers for extra color and also used Vidalia onions, which added a nice flavor to the dish. This sauce would be great over pasta.

I loved this dish! Because of what i had in my fridge i varied it slightly. Used freshly diced yellow and orange tomotoes, and added some tomato sauce. Had no bacon, so, sauted sweet sausage crumbled out of the casing, it was incredible. I will make this again many times. Delishious.

Excellent blend of flavors. Sole makes a nice substitute for the flounder. Serve with simply steamed vegetables as this is rich

This recipe has nice presentation, wonderful flavor and is easy. The sauce is very flavorful and I am sure could be used on various other fish, meats and poulty. A good dish for entertaining.

I have been making this dish since it first came out, always with great success! It is simple yet fancy enough for dinner guests. Don't skip the bacon!

What a nice meal!!! I had everything on hand for this recipe except the fresh parsley, so I substituted the parsley with chopped fresh tarragon leaves. The tarragon gave it a nice flavor. I followed the recipe to a "T" and broiled the whole dish during the last minute of baking. Try this one....you'll like it!!

Flounder is one of my favorite fish and this recipe melted in everyone's mouth. The flounder stayed extremely moist and flavorful in the tomato sauce. I pureed the tomatoes instead of chopping them and substituted a mix of green and red peppers for the wine sauce. I finished the dish by serving it over a bed of white rice.
