I am asked all the time to bring this salad to get-togethers. I use any combination of fresh fruit that looks good at the local grocery store, but I always include fresh pineapple! The great thing is that you can mix up the dressing ahead of time so that the lime-honey mixture gets infused with the mint. Then just pour it over the salad right before serving! One of my go to summer recipes!

Now this may not be for everyone but I used fresh basil instead of mint. My crowd loved it!

What's not to love about this salad?! It's the best fruit salad we have had.

So delicious and so incredibly easy. I used this syrup with strawberries and raspberries because that is what I had on hand and it was a huge hit. Too easy not to do and jazzed up fruit for dessert

Fabulous. Just be sure to use a light honey.

I think I would have liked this better with a simple syrup standing in for the honey. It has an earthy musk that didn't sync up with brightness of the lime and mint. Like a cinder block on my kite tail. Different strokes...

This was a big hit at our last dinner party, especially as we had a guest who is allergic to dairy and wheat. It's very easy to put together, and the syrup is the perfect mixture of sweet and fresh. Definitely don't leave out the mint. It's essential to the flavour of the dish!

This recipe was perfect! I made the recipe to the letter and the sauce was a great combination with the fruit. It was a hit!!!

Made this twice for dinner parties. Haven't had mint but just the lime-honey syrup with lime zest is a knockout. I served it with whatever fruit looked best at the market. Guests raved. Absolute keeper. Looking forward to adding mint next time!

Made this recipe exact with one exception. I didn't know how my guests would like green mint in their fruit so I used pure mint extract for a subliminal freshness. It doesn't take very much to really notice it. Very good dish though and would make again for sure.

Possibly the best fruit salad I have ever had the pleasure of making, it is especially admirable in its simplicity. Although using mint extract was easier, I definitely prefer the added taste provided by fresh mint. However, the fruit can blend quite well together on their own, with the syrup served on the side--especially if one is expecting guests who may prefer their fruit unsauced. Incidentally, if you have any kind of cut or scratch at all on your hands, wear gloves! Lime juice stings! An all-around excellent dish.--I also recommend doubling the recipe, as seconds will be requested!

I did not like the taste of lime and honey in this dish. It was edible, but not my favorite.

Recipe was very easy to prepare and a hit at brunch. The dressing gave it a fresh flavor. I added some blueberries and it was very colorful. It went so fast, I might have to double the recipe next time.

Wonderful recipe!!!!!! So easy and so delicious! The flavor is just perfect- not too strong and not too sweet. I only added a couple of tablespoons of mint. I used cantelope, strawberries, blueberries, and mango.

I didn't use the full amount of mint and served the syrup on the side, but it turned out wonderfully. Nice mix of flavors. Fairly easy and inexpensive (save the strawberries) to make this dish, perfect for a little splash of color and sweetness for a winter table.

Made this for BBQ and it was a hit. Everyone love it. I added Grand Marnier to the mix.

THIS IS REALLY GOOD. MAKE IT RIGHT BEFORE SERVING, 'CUZ IT DOESN'T LAST. WILL SURELY MAKE IT AGAIN.

This is a very refreshing fruit salad. I used a variety of fruits and it turned out wonderful. I brought it to a luncheon and everyone raved. Little did they know how easy it was to make :).

Thanks to another reviewer, I too added grated lime zest from 1 lime + a splash of Cointreau liquor to the dressing (thanks for the terrific tip!) This salad was easy to prepare & it was a hit at the BBQ I brought it to. Impressive looking as well. A definite "keeper".

This is simple, lovely and tastey! Use whatever fruits are available but vary the colors. Kids will be adverse to trying this if the full amount of mint is used (green just scares them!). Can always cut down on the mint or use extract. Do keep the mint, though. The mint, lime and honey provide a delightfully fresh sweetness.

A big hit for the 4th of July. I changed the fruits a bit (used apples and banans instead of cantaloupe and strawberries), but all my guests loved it. A scoop of vanilla ice cream adds enough sweet creaminess to complement the tartness of the lime juice.

I pared back a lot on the mint..it seemed that it would be overpowering, so I used 2 TB instead of 1/4 cup. I also used Key Limes, which are what limes are here in Mexico, they added more tartness, which everyone seemed to like. I took the suggestion of a previous reviewer and added minced lime peel as well. Used persian melon, grapes, strawberries, peaches, pineapple and apples. My guests went wild over it and the one little piece I ate was great (I'm diabetic, so no honey for me :-)).

I make this at least once aweek. It is so refreshing. My 4 children gooble it up. Rasberry honey is also very good with this.

Really good!!! I added bananas---really made a beautiful salad with the fresh mint. Just a hint of honey and lime made this dish extraordinary.

Excellent! This received rave reviews for the combination of lime, honey and mint. I used completely different fruit as I couldn't find some off season (I live in Switzerland). Highly recommend lychees, pineapple, apple, charentais melon and mango!

Great-- Fresh and delicious flavor! The mint complimented the fruit beautifully!

I made this salad for a potluck party and used raspberries instead of the grapes and honeydew instead of kiwi. Everyone loved it. I made it many times since and it's a geat success - I think the combination of the colors with the wonderful fresh taste(mint)makes it a winner.

This is incredibly simple to make, and it's delicious. Fruit salads are usually not the star of a meal, but for some reason this one catches people's attention. I make it fairly often. For the folks who think the mint is too strong -- taste it before you add it. Different mints can be various strengths (and it seems to matter how old the mint is too.

The salad looked beautiful, but to my surprise, the mint didn't seem to complement the fruits well. Be careful when you add the fruit to the syrup that you have shaken off the rinsing water water so that the salad doesn't become too wet.

I'll be making this one frequently. It's so easy, and everyone loved it.

This is so refreshing - a perfect balance of tart and sweet with the mint accent. We used lots of summer fruits. Great summer dessert.

I substituted honeydew for cantalope. The honey sweetens and brings out the flavor of the fruits. The lime juice counterbalances the honey and makes the dish a keeper.

Excellent fruit salad which I brought to a summer barbeque. I mixed all fruit together except strawberries and dressing. Just before serving I added the berries and tossed with dressing. Added sliced starfruit to decorate the top. It disappeared very quickly.

Mint flavor was a bit strong, I would cut down on that. Fruit became a bit soggy, due to the honey, I believe. Good, not great. Don't know if I'd do it again.

So fresh and wonderful! Just the right amount of everything. I mixed the cantaloupe, grapes and kiwi up the night before I served this salad at a birthday luncheon. I mixed the dressing up separately and prepared the strawberries in a separate container. The next morning I tossed the dressing in with the cantaloupe mixture and added the strawberries about 1/2 hour before serving. Fabulous, beautiful stuff.

Best fruit salad i've ever had. Skip the ice cream-- there's no need for it. The salad is a perfect dessert on its own.

This easy to make fruit salad is not only delicious, but visually appealing. It would be the perfect addition to a Sunday brunch or bridal shower buffet. The only change I made was to add a little extra honey to sweeten the syrup.

This is by far the BEST fruit salad I have ever eaten. It's quick and easy to prepare, and leftovers are excellent.
