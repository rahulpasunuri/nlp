Delicious!! Although, instead of straining the mixture, I blended it and rewarmed it before serving over french toast. It's excellent and super thick. My mom poured it over the strawberries and banana's I'd cut up for breakfast and ate it all by the end of the day.

Loved it--- the lemon juice added the magic touch.

I made this EASY recipe to top home made ice cream, and it was fantastic. I decided not to strain out the cooked berries, and am so glad. They added just the right texture. A definite keeper!

I made this to extend the life of perfectly ripe farmer's market berries and was very happy with the result. The syrup had a fresh flavor and the lemon juice kept it from being cloyingly sweet. It was awesome with dessert but also made a seriously yummy drink mixer-- I like it with champagne or the sparkling limeade from Trader Joe's.

I loved this recipe! It is SO much better than store-boughten strawberry syrup (it's strawberry season here, so we have a bounty of them)... it's got a pleasant fruitiness/ tartness that is just wonderful!

This was excellent! I used it all week on top of ice cream, angel food cake, and more. I will however decrease the amount of lemon juice by half next time I make it.

Wow?! Simply excellent! Almost DID NOT make this recipe because it called for corn syrup. Do not let that deter you - the result is superb. Best with fresh-squeezed lemon. I served a slice of chocolate ganache cake in a puddle of this syrup - the flavors and colors both collected rave reviews from my guests.
