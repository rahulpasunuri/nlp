I made this for company and everyone went crazy over it. The chocolate sauce got hard after sitting on the plate with the ice cream on it, but it was still delicious.

Wonderful! I served this at a dinner party and everyone raved! The chocolate sauce was so simple yet outstanding. I agree with the previous review, use a good vanilla bean ice cream, it makes a big difference.

I made this simple dessert on a busy week night. Easy, and delicious. I substituted brandy with added juice from an orange in lieu of the orange liqueur. The pecans are a must.

This is absolutely THE best "quick" dessert there is! Everyone here raved, just make sure to use a good gourmet ice cream - I used vanilla bean and it was outstanding. Thanks for this one, Epicurious!
