These were fabulous! I reduced down the marinade to a glaze and brushed it onto the shrimp after broiling so the shrimp would crisp up more under the broiler.

Also, I used large shrimp instead of jumbo and it still came out wonderful.

I made this for Valentines Day and it was amazing. So easy and nicely presented. Made me look like a pro. Not to mention I am still craving them.

This is elegant and delicious -- make SURE you use the freshest possible jumbo shrimp and super-thin prosciutto di Parma (NOT the domestic stuff!) Simply excellent -- it's our favorite go-to meal for a romantic dinner.

The only difficult part of this recipe is finding decent prosciutto! Otherwise, it's fabulous!

Made this as an appetizer for Mother's Day and it was a huge hit, had to leave the recipe with my mom as she wants to make it again soon. Took other reviewers suggestions and marinated overnite using 3 huge cloves of garlic. Just before putting into the broiler I squeezed fresh lemon juice over the shrimp and it added a nice zip to the taste. Thanks for all the helpful comments.

These were very tasty as an appetizer and really simple to make. I recommend marinating the shrimps overnight or for a few hours to give them lots of flavor. My guests kept going back to the shrimp and when there was only one left, there was an actual discussion about who should have it.

Delicious. Made as an appetizer for Valentine's Day. Everyone liked them. I didn't think they were too salty. I did add a little extra garlic and marinated overnight.

PHENOMENAL! I ended up using "colossal" shrimp as that's all the market had at the time, and only cut the prosciutto lengthwise (and not in half again) to wrap around the larger shrimp. I also doubled the garlic and the pepper flakes for a little extra kick. YUMMMMMMMMMY! Served with a nice German Gewurtstraminer, which was perfect! Looking forward to serving this again SOON!

Suggestion for simplifying (and VERY tasty) - Wrap each shrimp in slice of prosciutto; chop some garlic and add w/ squeeze of lemon to olive oil; brush shrimp with garlic oil; put in wire grill contraption (especially made for fish etc. so it doesn't fall through the grates) and grill over the hot coals in your fireplace if you're lucky enough to have one (or improvise with a broiler or grill). SO good!

We made this as an appetizer for our New Year's Eve dinner. Outstanding flavor and our guests raved about it. We increased the garlic and marinated about two hours before cooking. We used beautiful fresh Caledonia shrimp that were closer in size to what most people call prawns. I'm sure the quality of the shrimp would make a big difference in how this dish tastes. We plan on making it many more times.

Yes, the shrimp were too bland -- needed more garlic. The prosciutto was a nice flavor. I served this on a bed of pasta tossed with parmesan and butter as a main course.

Made this for New Years. The Proscuitto overpowers the shrimp. Perhaps the reader who used the scallops had the right idea. I marinated jumbo shrimp overnight (21-25 per pound size). These were mostly uneaten.

I did not enjoy this as much as the other viewers did. I found it to be pretty tasteless. The white wine kind of overpowered the dish for my taste. To me scampi needs a little butter. I have some better recipes on hand I think I will stick to those.

Served this scampi recipe at a brunch and loved it. We used large tiger prawns. We took some hints from other reviewers and decided to marinate the prawns overnight, and it turned out great. As the shrimp shrink during cooking, next time I will try to find even larger prawns.

Great stuff. I used large, fresh, sea scallops in place of the shrimp, but everything else was the same. You have to cook the scallops a LITTLE longer than the shrimp. This really spiced up my old prosciutto wrapped scallop recipe.

Very, very good. However, this is definitely an appetizer, not a main dish. The prosciutto is very salty, so three or four of these per person as an appetizer is great....and not overwhelming. Highly recommended as a appetizer.

I make a variation of this dish stuffed with pesto. You simply butterfly the shrimp and stuff with a teaspoon or so of good pesto then wrap in the prosciutto. Then either saute in olive oil and garlic or grill, basting with a garlic infused oil. Grilled, I serve it as an appitizer, sauted we put in over Angel Hair pasta, dress with garlic oil and some good pecorino and serve as a main course. The pesto really takes this dish to the next level, I think.

Excellent. I wrapped prosciutto around shrimp and secured with toothpick. Needs to marinade longer than 1 hour.

Rating: 3
This is a nice dish but can be a bit salty due to the proscuitto ham. The shrimp need to marinate for longer than 1 hour, I would suggest overnight to get the full flavour. But overall it's a nice easy dish

I made this recipe for my boyfriend since he and I are shrimp lovers. He has never raved about anything as he did with this dish. I served it with a light angel hair past dish. This recipe is most definately not just for an appetizer. I will make it again and again!

AWESOME! I served this appetizer at a supper club last weekend and everyone RAVED about them. I was amazed at how such an easy recipe could get such praise. To add a little bit of color I tied a green onion stalk around each individusl shrimp, to make it look like the prosciutto was tied on, the appearance of the appetizer was extrememly attractive.

AWESOME and EASY to make. I made up the marinade a day ahead to meld the flavors. Our guests devoured them and were looking for more.

INCREDIBLE!!! I ad-libbed a bit and served it over asparagus spears that were par cooked and marinated in same mixture....then, when done, topped it with bread crumbs from stale italian loaf and some parm and romano, and broiled until cheese melts...GREAT!!

A great first course. I have heard that some people don't like the prosciutto with the shrimp, but I think it works very well.
