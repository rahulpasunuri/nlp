Delicious! I added extra mushrooms (about 7 oz). I reccommend using chantrelles in the mix of wild mushrooms. I also added 2 more tbs of parmesan on top. No prob w/ egginess; just be sure to keep an eye on it, as most bread puddings will become eggy if overcooked.

What a delightful recipe!!! I was inspired at the farmers market by a huge bundle of oyster mushrooms and didnt know what to make. This was such a lovely surprise. I served it with filet mignon and red chard with lemon and garlic. It was the perfect rich balance. I took other readers advice and bulked way up on the spices. I didnt have any sage but used fresh thyme and about a cup of chopped basil. I also used hallah bread instead of french. I will definitely make this again!

10 forks ... if possible! Definitely use challah bread.

Made this recipe for a brunch, and it was a great hit. It is very forgiving, and I seasoned liberally. I recommend using challah bread.

I made this on Valentine's Day this year because my boyfriend loves anything eggy and Quiche-Like...it was remarkable! I did add more spices than it called for, but it was a huge hit. Making it again on Easter.

easy with plenty of room to adjust to your personal tastes, it works as breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner and fantastic reheated. I will work it into regular rotation.

I'm revisiting this recipe, made it and rated it as three forks two years ago. This time I believe it deserves a resounding four. First, I made half again as much because people love it and it makes great leftovers-reheating in the microwave works very well. Second, I more than doubled the proportion of wild mushrooms, this time using a few ounces of oyster and shiitake, with lots of crimini and portobello. I think you can use any combination of wild mushrooms but it's important not to cut them up too small. You'll think they'll never fit in the baking dish when you start the saute but they cook way down. Third, since I found the flavor a bit bland last time even after adding more of everything, this time I used all fresh herbs, tripled the equivalent amounts, and doubled the garlic. I also added four chopped fat shallots to the saute. Fourth,I used fat-free half and half, quite rich enough, lots of pepper, and nine cups of day-old challah bread with the crust still on. Fifth, I was very liberal with the cheese, this time using both freshly grated romano and asiago in the body of the bread pudding and sprinkled on top. I'll admit to at least three quarters of a cup of each but it could easily have been more. Last, I didn't want to worry about coordinating the baking with the many other dishes I prepared for Christmas, so I baked the bread pudding the day before and reheated it, covered, for maybe forty minutes at 350. This dish now ranks as amazing in my book. It's succulent and earthy with herbs and mushrooms, and the texture is both firm and spongy. It's a great vegetarian, but not vegan, main dish and the flavor just gets deeper and deeper the longer it sits. But beware: If you make it in the amounts I did the baking dish will weigh a ton!

We had this dish with beef tenderloin on Christmas Eve. It was a hit. We also added extra mushrooms. There was no problem with "eggi-ness." And the dish tastes great reheated. We added a bit of whole milk and put back in the oven for a side dish two nights later. Will definitely make again.

This is a perfect option for vegetarians. I also make this for Teacher Appreciation luncheons as it is easy to make in advance and reheat.

Wonderful company dish, but be warned it's quite heavy and filling. It has become a demanded dish for my in-laws at Thanksgiving. Feel free to experiment with mushroom ratios. Hearty rye works very well for the bread as well.

I love savory bread puddings and their kissing-cousins, the strata. I used chanterelles, baby portobellos, wild brown champignon, and oyster; was liberal with the herbs. Made this for a buffet potluck for a mixed Euro crowd. after some explanation of the pudding, I went back about 10 minutes later to find the dish emptyand got requests for the recipe later.

I did not remove the crust from the French bread. Excellent! The next day I added a TBLS of cream to one serving of the leftovers and it reheated beautifully in the Microwave.

Tastes like quiche but is more work. I liked it, but probably won't make it again.

I've been making mushroom bread pudding as a Christmas side dish for years now. I add a few dashes of Tabasco and Worcestershire sauces more onions and no herbs. Also, one of the groceries near me carries a pre-mixed blend of mushrooms which makes it even easier. I serve it with frikadeller, red cabbage, and vegetables and have never thought it bland, but I think that it balances out the meal perfectly. My guests think so too.

This has become a family favorite for the holidays. I did change the recipe a bit. Instead of using oyster mushrooms, I added some baby portabellas and also omitted the basil and parsley in favor of more thyme, sage and added some oregano. I did increase the garlis just a bit (2 extra teaspoons) and used day old rosemary bread. It is simply delicous!

This looked just great, brown and plump and inviting, rose quite a bit during the baking. I almost doubled the mushrooms, based on earlier suggestions, using about 1/3 shiitakes and 2/3 crimini and portobello and made sure not to slice them up too small. I used challah with the crust on and 3 cups of fat free half and half. I also used lots of both gruyere and parmesan in the body of the dish and sprinkled on top, and upped the garlic to at least 6 teaspoons. The dish was tender and spongy, the top crust was great, but it was still a bit blander than I had hoped. All that creaminess just kinds of blands it out. However, it's great comfort food, and if you like the feeling of mac and cheese this may be one for you.

Rating: 3
Great recipe. But as mentioned in other reviews, leave the crusts on the bread and increase the amount of mushrooms. I used shallots in the mushroom mix. Only change I will make the next time is to increase the amount of cheese

DELICIOUS!! I've made this several times and there are never any leftovers. You can play around with the amount and type of mushrooms..I use the fat-free half and half and it's still wonderful.

This dish is excellent, and I will defintiely make it again. However, I would make a few changes next time: More mushrooms are in order, and I would use a little more spice all around. The body of the dish is good, but it needs something else to bring out the flavor - maybe some finely chopped rosemary. I used shredded parmesean on top instead of grated, which gave it a nice browned look. I think the heavy whipping cream can be reduced - maybe in half substituting more whole milk - this dish is so rich, I don't think it needs all that extra fat. I also used a little gruyere cheese in the body and on top, which added a nice touch. All around excellent.

Yum! I loved this recipe! I made this in place of regular dressing with a turkey dinner, and everybody liked it. I also didn't cut the crusts off the bread, and it worked fine. I mixed in some regular mushrooms to make the dish a little less expensive, and it was delicious.

Basically delicious, but slightly dry. Next time I would cook a bit shorter time, or perhaps increase the cream.

A wonderful dish. I've made it twice. First time, I used half-and-half instead of the whipping cream. Both times I've not been too concerned about the exact type of mushroom I used ~ mostly portobello though. I've also left the crusts on the bread. Each time it has vanished off the table in minutes! And I've had repeated requests for the recipe. A definite WINNER !

Delicious. Comfort food but elegant enough to be served as a side dish for a fancy dinner as well.

I made this dish for a Christmas Eve dinner with Prime Rib....it was fabulous and easy. I doubled it and prepared it in 10 1-cup ramekins, the rest went into a casserole for second helpings. Great presentation, and the casserole was emptied too! I would offer this to any client.

Made this for a party on Saturday night and everyone raved about it. I did make some slight variations. I used a hearty country loaf (kind of like a sourdough) and kept the crusts on. I also added a chopped leek to the mushroom mixture before sauteeing. Instead of letting it sit for 15 minutes, I poured it straight into the baking dish and put it in the fridge for a few hoursbefore the party started and it was DELICIOUS.

This was my first attempt at Bread Pudding of any type and it was a huge success. The only thing I changed was I increased the mushrooms by about 4 oz and doubled the parmesan cheese. I made this as a side for the Filet Mignon with Merlot sauce for a small dinner party yesterday. Can not wait to have the left overs tonight!!

This received rave reviews from my husband on the trial run. I froze the remainder for a cottage brunch, thawed and reheated - it was GREAT. In the future I'll keep one in the freezer for the unexpected.

My husband made this for me and I loved it! He used a 7.5" souffle pan and added an extra 4 oz of mushrooms and might even use more next time. He did not decrust the bread. It looked beautiful coming out of the oven, excellent presentation in the souffle dish. It went great with steaks and was a unique alternative to the typical side dishes. We'll definitely make it again!

I made this to accompany my beef tenderloin, but it worked really well as a main dish for my vegetarian daughters. I prepared the mushrooms the day before and then the assembly was easy and quick.

I love this recipe. Make sure the mushrooms are crispy. I always add extra. It is great for brunches and in place of stuffing. I've reworked this a couple times. Now I use a heavy country wheat bread with the crusts removed. I use dry spices because it is harder to get fresh in Ohio in winter. They also absorb the milk. I mix the bread, cheese (use more), and mushroom mixture in the 9x13 pan and then pour the eggs over. Be sure to soak it long enough for most of the eggs to absorb. I used to use a deeper pan, but have gone to the shallower pan and I like it better this way.

I made this several hours ahead and reheated it with no problems. It was still absolutely delicious. I do agree that it has a bit of an eggy texture (pudding or somewhat souffle like) but the flavor is great! We had it alongside with a beef tenderloin, very rich, very tasty.

I had a lot of very stale sourdough bread on my hands and found this recipe. My husband has to watch his cholesterol intake, so I substituted egg beaters for 3 of the the 5 eggs and fat free half and half for the heavy cream. I also reduced the amount of fat. The dish was still incredibly good, perfect for a brunch party. All thumbs up.

I recently made this for Thanksgiving and my in-laws were fighting for more! I also do not de-crust the bread. I cut slightly back on the garlic since I used a botted, minced version. Surberb recipie!

This was great! I made 1.5 times the amount in the recipe. It was creamy, definitely not eggy, and delicious. One major bonus I made it a day before the party with absolutely no ill effects of reheating. And I didn't decrust the bread, french bread crust is the best. Nor was I obsessive about cubing it, just broke it up with my hands. The didn't have the quantity of all the mushroom so I used some regular white buttons along with the others-still great.Well worth it!

This was amazing. I grilled the bread lightly before using it in the recipe - brought out a bit of the smokiness of the mushrooms. I will definitely serve this again - a true hit!

I don't see what all the fuss is about this dish. I cut it in half as other reviewers had done and also baked it in a souffle dish. I found that it had a strong egg taste that I disliked. (This was my first attempt at a bread pudding that was not meant for dessert. Maybe it's supposed to be 'eggy?')

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this dish. The flavor and the texture went well with the cornish game hens I made the first night, and equally as well with the sirloin steak I made the next night. Even though the french bread I used was fresh, the texture still worked. This one is a definite keeper.

Delicious and quite successful even though I halved the recipe - still ample servings for four. I took the reviewer's advice about the souffle dish and it was wonderful!

Fantabulous! Took liberties with both the bread and the mushrooms, and it still turned out great. I'll probably make this for my next dinner party! 12/11/99: just wanted to add that i doubled this recipe and used a shallower dish: i recommend that something more like a taller casserole or a souffle dish is better than a shallower pan - i understood the dry/eggy criticism better when i cooked this is a shallower pan. In my souffle dish, I tested for doneness with a toothpick, and that worked quite well. Bottom line: don't overbake this.

This was a HUGE hit! Very easy to prepare... very light and tasty. I used regular white bread without the crust since I was out of Frech (probably harder to remove the crust anyway!. There was noticeable difference. Definitely a keeper

Very expensive; eggy and dry...too much bread vs. mushrooms for my family, and I carefully measured and weighed everything. Would not fix again.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic! It is rich and sumptuous. It's also expensive to make, but worth every penny. I made a small adaptation -- I added lightly steamed, very coarsely chopped swiss chard (with water squeezed out). Ît was a good addition that cut the richness of the dish a little. Everyone at the table raved and some asked for the recipe.

It turned out really wonderful...all the guests raved and I would definitely make it again. Great side dish with roasted chicken!
