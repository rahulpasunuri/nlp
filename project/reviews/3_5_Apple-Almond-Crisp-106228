I like this for apple crisp lovers - to surprise them a bit and for a bit more crunch in the topping, which never hurts!

I have made this a few times.I don't use granny smiths, I find they shrink too much. I use a medly of apples, whatever looks good at the grocery store. I don't cut them thin, I cut them thick so I don't end up with apple mush. I replace some of the white flour in the topping with oatmeal that I grind in the blender. And I sub 1 & 1/2 TB of cornstarch for the flour that is mixed with the apples. Sometimes I tossed in a bit of grated fresh ginger. YUMMM

I love this recipe! I substituted oats for the almonds, increased sugar to 1 cup, omitted the lemon peel, decreased nutmeg to 1/4 tsp and used Cortland apples. Delicious!!!

My husband and I both thought this was delicious. I left out the almond extract and added a little more vanilla instead. I'll definitely make this again!

I made this for my brother and me while my parents were away in Mexico! I forgot to peel the apples but it still was really good, i think it may have added a little touch! He didn't want any almonds (picky) so I used regular old oats and it turned out just delicious! It took a little longer than 1 hour, about 15-20 minutes more. We topped it with praline ice cream, It was awesome!!! I'll make it (for him) again for sure :)

I've made this recipe several times to rave reviews however, I prefer it without the almond extract. I thought that overpowered the recipe. Also, I usually add raisins just because we like them.

A delicious and easy recipe. I've also substituted mangos and peaches for the apples, and the newly resulting cobblers have been wonderful.

Yummy enough fresh from the oven, but leftovers don't hold up or reheat well (if you reheat, use oven only; microwaving makes it gummy & worse than airline food). Found myself wondering whether grated lemon peel should be packed or left fluffy when measuring (how come recipes never specify?) I tamped, and everybody thought it was way too much lemon. Very unsubtle.

coupled with vanilla ice cream, this crisp rivals the crisps from my childhood. the almond adds a nice roundness, not overpowering. there is a lot of topping, which may account for one reviewer's "flouriness", so i would suggest using as many apples as fits into your dish. definately will be making this again.

I love most desserts but I thought this was awful! Maybe I should try to make it again because everyone else rated it so well. We thought it was grainy or flourery.

This dessert is FABULOUS! You can assemble it a few hours ahead and place in the refrigerator. I have made it several times and everyone has loved it! And yes, don't forget the vanilla ice cream

I'm not a cook - this was the first dessert I've ever made (but my mom's a pastry chef) and it was a total hit with friends at a dinner party. Easy to make, and the flavors were delicious. Unforgettable with vanilla ice cream.

This was delicious! I served it to a big family and we all agreed the topping is one of the best parts- it almost seemed to taste a bit like caramel- probably due to the brown sugar melting a little bit on the top, the almonds were a great crunch and it tasted fabulous with ice cream.

A blue ribbon dessert if dressed up with a Tablespoon of apple brandy(or cognac) and crystallized ginger substituted for regular. Don't forget the ice cream! Fabulous

Very tasty. Everyone loves this - although we called it "apple crapple." Would probably be good with granola used in lieu of flour in topping as well.

Easy and delicious - I made this for dessert for a potluck "Bon Appetit" dinner and we all enjoyed it very much. I gave the leftovers to my neighbors when I got home and they loved it, too! I will definitely make this again.

I didn't actually make it, but my friend did. She made it on a Wednesday and I had it reheated in the microwave the following Monday and it was still really good. She says it will be something she makes again and again. I agree, it was very good.
