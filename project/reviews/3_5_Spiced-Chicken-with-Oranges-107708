Very simple to make and tasty. Cooked with corn oil instead of butter based on earlier reviews that mad sense to me. I used hot pepper sesame oil (2t). I made a roux with 1T flour after cooking the onion, that worked out to be the right consistency. I also added about 1T more sesame seeds to the sauce.

I also marinated the chicken in marachino cherry juice and orange juice for about 30 minutes prior to cooking.I also put the cherries in with the sauce along with a few tablespoons of the juice. This dish was flavorful and a huge hit with my guests. It was both sweet and spicy. I did not experience any of the bitterness mentioned by others. I would definately make this again!

Easy fast and yummy. My kids and husband loved it. Perfect for a weeknight dinner or something a little fancier. I served it with couscous underneath and green beans sauted with a little garlic and orange juice

This was easy, quick, and delicious. I used canola oil instead of butter, an ordinary yellow onion (since it was being cooked), and a little Asian hot chili sauce instead of pepper oil. I used a navel orange from my tree, and since navel oranges can turn bitter when cooked, added the orange at serving time. The sauce was sweet from the onion and orange juice. The five-spice powder gives the breasts a nice coloring as well as flavor.

Guess all the comments about bitterness must be because of the particular orange juice used. Ours was not bitter. Also nothing to write home about.

I marinated the chicken in orange juice, marachino cherry juice, and seasoned salt for about an hour before cooking. I also threw the cherries in with the oranges and onions. It added a very nice sweet aspect to the flavor, and it was a hit with my guests. I would definately make it again!

I made this last night for dinner because I needed something fast. Wow was it great. I made exactly as directed and found it to be flavorful, not bitter and very moist. The heat was perfect, just as an underlying note. Served with steamed carrots, broccoli and fresh baby corn. Reisling went well with it too. we were stuffed and still I lost a pound and a half! I don't know if this was the problem with "bitterness" some others experienced but make sure to keep your seasame seeds in the fridge or they will go rancid.

I LOVE this recipe. It came out a little hotter than I expected (probably my choice of pepper oil) but in my house that's not a bad thing. This will be a regular menu item.

This was a nice weeknight dinner. I had no problems with bitterness, I thought it was sweet and fragrant. I substituted olive oil for the butter and used pineapple-orange-banana (yum yum yum!) juice and juice oranges.

Loved this for a quick meal; had no problems with bitterness. Actually, I thought the combination of flavors was terrific. I used blood orange slices because they were in season, and they enhanced the presentation.

Having read the above negative criticism, about bitterness, lingering odours etc. and tough or thick breasts, I would like to suggest some modifications. First never use butter to cook with.Use olive oil with a touch of sesame oil added to cook with instead. I cut my chicken breasts into very thin small slices much like I would do for stir fry. Fresh orange juice is better than boxed. If it is too bitter , add a bit of sugar or better yet, balsamic vinegar.

Initially I saw this recipe and thought hmmm...interesting and simple! The finished product was MARVELOUS! I added cornstarch to thicken the juices for I favor its adherence to the jasmine rice I served it over. I will definately be making this again. I substituted chicken thighs instead, I am a fan of dark meat.

I thought this was a great, fast entree. Though, when pan searing, I always pound my chicken breasts thin to make sure they cook evenly and are tender. I omitted the pepper oil and just used a few red pepper flakes. Made it for "foodie" guests and everyone enjoyed. Didn't have the problem with bitterness that others expressed.

I too thought the dish was bitter and uninteresting. My husband thought it was okay, but I never want to make it again.

This was definitely a flop. The spice combination on the chicken was uninteresting and bitter, and the sauce too mild to make up for it. Maybe the chicken breasts I used were unusually thick, but it took FOREVER to cook, and was basically black on the outside, which further ruined the sauce. I will use some other recipe next time.

Although this recipe was delicious, I could not get the smell of the sauteed red onions out of my house for days. There has got to be a way to achieve the taste without the lingering odor, which was quite unpleasant.
