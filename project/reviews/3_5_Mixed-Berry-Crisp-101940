Just made this this morning for me and the girls. The topping was so buttery delicious and the filling was thick and yummy. We used an antioxidant berry mix from Costco that had strawberries, raspberries, cherries and pomegranates. Yum!! g^á^f

Used this recipe to make in individual 1 pint wide mouth mason jars as part of a birthday/4th of July BBQ. I made one and a half times the recipe and it was perfect for 13 desserts. Baked one off last evening and it turned out exactly as I wanted it to. I cannot wait to serve these today!

Outstanding!! I made it exactly as stated in the recipe, except I think I had closer to 7 cups of berries. My guests raved! Can't wait to make again. Would be an easy recipe to multiply for a large group.

Made this after receiving a last minute invite to a dinner party, had everything on hand and used ingredients exactly as written. There was plenty of topping, in fact if anything I'd have gone for a cup or two more berries. Sugar level was just right.

Easy and so yummy - especially with vanilla bean ice cream. After making this once, I will never make berry pie again. My new go-to dessert.

Rating: 4
easy and delicious. I used half rappadura half sugar for the white sugar. definitely best served fresh and warm, but heated up in the microwave next day was still tasty. serve with breyers vanilla ice cream with fresh ground cinnamon and a few fresh berries. topping was a little much, but I'd just add more frozen berries to even it out. yum!

This was so easy and very delicious! I made 1.5x the topping, and it was just the right amount. Like other reviewers, I did add a bit of extra sugar to the fruit for fear that the fruit would be too tart, but I would not do that next time. With the extra bit of topping, it was just a bit too sweet.

My family loved this! I read other reviews and "tweeked" it a bit also. I added 2 MORE T. of sugar to berries as the recipe only calls for 1/4 C and was tart. I used frozen mixed berries (blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, and rasberries) from Hy-Vee. I also doubled the topping part of the recipe. Which actually didn't need to be doubled, but maybe just half again, because recipe wasn't enough and doubling it was too much. WIll definately make again and this one is a KEEPER! Serve warm with vanilla icecream. ( haagen dazs)

I made this exactly as the recipe said (except I cut everything in half) and thought it was delicious. My topping to fruit ratio was a little off but I think that's because I should have taken it out of the oven earlier given the halving of the ingredients. I used blackberries and strawberries. Definitely a keeper!

Rating: 4
This is delicious! i used 6 cups of frozen and fresh blueberries, strawberries, raspberries and a handful of frozen cherries. I doubled the topping but probably didn't need to since when I cut in to the crisp, it was very thick with crust (though delicious tasting). I love the smell and taste of the ginger and nutmeg. I only cooked it for 45 minutes because last time I made it, I cooked it for 1 hour and thought it was too long. Serve it with vanilla ice cream! All the grownups at my friend's party loved it!

Rating: 4
I bumped up the sugar, as one reviewer had suggested and doubled the topping as a few others did. My family loved it! I made the crisp Memorial Day weekend. On Tuesday when I returned to work, I brought some leftovers for my co-workers. I had some very unhappy family members!! I will be making this again.

I have a surplus of frozen blueberries in the freezer, and have made this recipe twice using just blueberries. It has a very nice taste and texture, without being overly sweet.

My family loved this. I did increase the topping a bit (1 c. whole wheat pastry flour, 1 cup oats, ect.). I used 2 cups raspberries, 2 cups blueberries, and 2 cups strawberries. The strawberries seemed almost out of place, but they were a good addition.

Super quick, good for entertaining.

Simple and yummy. I used a combination of blackberries and blueberries, more fruit than the recipe suggested so I adjusted flour etc accordingly. I took the other reviewers' suggestion and doubled the topping which I think works out well as the fruit is pretty tart. Served with vanilla ice cream.

Prepared "as is" with fresh berries instead of frozen. Turned out perfectly. Nice crispy crust with delicious tart/sweet berries. A keeper.

I wanted to add that I did not double the topping. If you double it - you will have more topping than fruit - which is not a true crisp.

Rating: 4
I made this with fresh strawberries & blackberries. I modified by using 1/2 cup sugar and 1 T vanilla extract. It came out delicious. Actually - I could have kept it at the 1/4 cup sugar- it was a little sweet. I am unsure why people feel the consistency isn't right. It was just thick enough and me and my husband devoured it! It is really yummy as is-but I would add the 1T vanilla

This dish was ok, but I agree with the previous poster who said the topping should be doubled. The layer of topping was thin. Other than that, it tasted pretty good.

Rating: 2
Ehhh...after all the rave reviews I didn't expect to have any trouble, but I guess I have different taste in crisp from most people. It definitely has potential for me--flavors were good--but next time I will double the crisp topping part. I followed the directions exactly this time and I don't know if my berries were extra juicy or what, but I wound up with much more berry-oatmeal goop than crisp.

Rating: 3
I've made this recipe twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly (except that I use fresh ginger instead of dried) and I thought the berries were way too congealed for my liking. There was too much flour in the berries. The second time I used a mix of berries and cherries, and I only added 2 tsp. of flour to the berries before baking and it was just right. The crisp is fabulous with the spices, and I also add a bit of cloves to it. Served with vanilla ice cream on top while still warm, everyone loved this dessert and it was gobbled up to the last piece!

This dish was excellent. I made it exactly as the recipe said -- with one twist. I divided the recipe up into individual ramekins so that everyone had their own personal dessert for the occasion. What a treat and it made for a more impressive occasion. With the ramekins I used, they made (7) seven individual desserts.

I used all fresh berries and decided that it was cooked too long. The berries had no shape of their own and it was just a berry mash with crisp topping. I served with whipped cream, but it would be much better with ice cream - the berries were too condensed and overpowered the whipped cream. I would cook it for less time if I made it again, but I will probably try others before I try this one a second time.

This crisp was just ok. My guests really enjoyed it, but maybe it was the ginger and nutmeg spice combination that was a bit much for me.

I made this crisp using the mixed berries with limited success. The next time, I used sour cherries in light syrup. I drained the cherries, mixed the sugar with about 3 tsp. of guar gum (for thickening) and voila, a perfect sour cherry crisp. The topping this recipe provides is the best crisp topping ever.

This dessert is great! It's become a requested dessert for parties. Really good served warm with vanilla bean ice cream. I used frozen berries and added a little more sugar. I also added some minute tapioca to the fruit to thicken it just a bit so it isn't so runny/liquidy.

The only problem that I had with this dish was there were too many seeds from the Raspberries. Next time I would use more blueberries and only a little bit of raspberries.

This was such a treat. I used fresh raspberries, and they held up really well. I served this with ice cream when it was hot, which was great. Then, I justified eating it for breakfast the following day because of the oatmeal-yum.

I make this all the time...for potlucks, office parties, guests, the family, everything. It could not be easier, and I can't remember one time I've served it, taken it somewhere, or sent it with my husband to a work function when I haven't had at least a few requests for the recipe! It's always a huge hit. Serve with whipped cream or ice cream...yum!

This is a really great recipe. I have made it 5 times already. I partially baked the crust and the berries half way seperately by themselves, then I put them together and baked it the rest of the way. This method doesn't make the crust soggy. Everyone love it the new way.

Yummy is about the only word I think completely covers this dessert. Made it for Mother's Day and the simplicity was key as I was bringing everything over to mom's house to make dinner. Prepare the crumb mixture at home and put in a ziploc bag so assembly was really easy. Served it with homemade cinnamon ice cream. I bet the leftovers are all gone by tonite.

Really liked this recipe for a quick dessert. I used a 16 ounce bag of blueberries with half the sugar, flour and crust. Very nice and relatively healthy. I also agree that it is great the next morning with or without yogurt. A keeper!

Delicious berry crisp overall w/ a nice oat-filled topping. I thought the nutmeg might not work w/ berries, but it tasted great. I used 1/4c pre-cooked tapioca to thicken instead of flour to prevent the filling from getting cloudy, and it worked perfectly. Added 1.5 tsp of vanilla extract, which gave the dish a nice fuller flavor. I used frozen strawberries and a mix of frozen blueberries, raspberries and marionberries. The strawberries became a bit "melted" and gray in color, so maybe I'll try fresh next time. Use either a 10" pan to prevent overflow, or put a baking sheet on the bottom of the oven to prevent mess.

I increased the sugar from 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup as per the advice of other reviewers - perfect! I cooked the crisp in a 10" pyrex pie plate rather than a 9"; this prevented the filling from bubbling over the side. I prepared this Easter morning for Easter lunch, and noticed that the fruit filling got soupy and the crust got soggy from standing around. It still tasted delicious, but this is best served shortly after baking.

I have to say that I have rated the flavor of this recipe according to the comments of my fiancee, since I can't eat sugar or bleached flour. He loved it. So did my sick friend who got a Tupperware-ful of it. It keeps quite well, so my fiancee has eaten it for almost a week now. I used only strawberries because I had about 3 pounds of fresh ones. I cut the fresh strawberries in half and worried the entire time that it wouldn't work out. But it did. The topping was crusty and beautiful, and the berry mixture was perfect. Serve this one with either ice cream or whipped cream. Overall, not the prettiest dessert to serve, but usually the best tasting things come in less than spectacular packages.

I've made this dish many times and it always gets rave reviews. I get requests to make it for birthdays and other events. Sometimes I add up to 1/2 cup of sugar, like previous reveiws have suggested.

I made this for my husband who loves crisps. I used 2 pounds of raspberries and blueberries that had been in my freezer for a long time and sprinkled a teaspoon of vanilla over the berries as someone suggested. Although I'm not crazy about cooked fruit, my husband loved it. Served with Dreyer's Vanilla Bean Ice Cream. This has to be the fastest dessert I've ever made (as far as assembly goes). I cooked it for 55 minutes.

This recipe was incredible (it's perfection served with breyers vanilla ice cream) and probably the easiest dessert I have ever made. I skipped the nutmeg and ginger and baked it at 425 for 10 minutes...then 375 for about 15 and then it was done! A new weeknight dessert.

Yummy! I made a few changes as suggested: increased sugar to 1/2 cup and added a generous splash of chambourd and a splash of vanilla also to the berries. I added some lightly toasted pecans to the topping and it was a nice and crunchy flavourful contrast. I have made this type of crisp before, but I really liked the suggestions and will definitely be making this again!

I made this with 4 cups of fresh raspberries from my garden and 2 cups of frozen strawberries, and it was delicious! I would definitely use the 3/4 cup sugar and cookie sheet as suggested by the other reviewers though. Also since most of my berries weren't frozen, it only took @45 min to bake, instead of the full hour. All in all a wonderful dessert, and would have been superb with a little ice cream :)

This recipe was delicious and super easy. I was hesitant about using frozen berries, to me fresh is better, but it turned out wonderful. Everyone loved it, and asked for the recipe. I took the suggestion from another review and added a little more sugar to the berries, about 1/2 cup or so to cut the tartness. I served it warm with fresh whip cream but ice cream would be much better. Make sure to leave it in the oven the full cooking time so the crisp gets done. I will surely make again, great recipe.

I am glad I used 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/4 cup, though, otherwise this would have been way too tart. Also, I used a 10" pie plate and put a cookie sheet underneath it to minimize oven mess.
