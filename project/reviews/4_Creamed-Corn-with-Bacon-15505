Made this for Thanksgiving dinner! Everyone loved it (including my 6 year old!). I added 2 more slices of bacon because more bacon = better! I followed other's suggestions of not adding water (used milk instead) and pureed a small amount of corn mixture to create a creamier texture. Store didn't have any fresh corn so I did use frozen but it worked out fine! Really yummy and was asked to make again...soon!!!

This is so good. I followed the recipe except used 3 cups of frozen, thawed corn and no water. Great flavor. You could probably use less cream.

this was absolutely DELICIOUS. it had such a great flavor. I didn't add any water as suggested by other users, and just used a full cup of half and half because I didn't have any cream. as a result, it didn't thicken as much as I would have hoped, but I just added a bit of slurry and it thickened up nicely. yummy yum.

This is the first time I have ever made creamed corn and it turned out simply wonderful. I made a few substitutions because I didn't plan to make it and used what I had in the frig. I replaced the bacon with hard salami, used half and half, no water, and red onions. I like my cream corn creamy so I let it simmer until it was very smooth, adding half and half as needed.

I cooked this with left over corn, used maple bacon and ran out of heavy cream so put in some creme fraiche. Sooo good.

Easy and delicious. Substituted organic frozen corn (far better than December 'fresh' corn in NY), so I left out the water.

This recipe is glorious! Cutting the corn off the cob is not that much effort but so worth it. I remember eating the horrid canned corn as a child, yuck. The bacon and scallions were wonderful. The store was out of heavy cream so I sufficed with half and half, and added additional milk (no water). I couldn't taste the lemon, but I don't think I would add more as it was just perfect. My husband even asked for a package to take to work the next day which he has never done!

The sweetness and flavour of fresh corn can't be beaten. This was a simple and wonderfully flavourful recipe. Like others, I omitted the 1/4 water, and used buttermilk instead of heavy cream. I'll definitely be making this again.

Great recipe. I think that using frozen corn (as someone suggested) would be a lot of effort for nothing. Fresh corn gives the taste you want. Also, I definitely agree with processing 1/4 of the mixture to help in thickening. Use milk instead of water. (Why would you put water in something you want to thicken up?) Make sure to scrape the "milk" from the cobs - that's essenatial Also, a shake of Tabasco helps.

We also used frozen corn and it turned out great. Adding a hot chili pepper gave it some nice pizzazz, though it then nearly overpowered the other dishes.

Very good and simple. I used frozen corn, which worked fine. I think that it would benefit the consistency to pulse a 1/2 cup or so of the corn in the food processor.
