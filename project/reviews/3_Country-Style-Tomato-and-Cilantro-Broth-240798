Simple, yet delicious. the spices impart an unusual but delicate taste and compliment the tomatoes.

I am a huge fan of tomato soups of all kind and this one is delicious. Layers of flavors. It was perfect before a spicy lamb vindaloo.

Too hot with the ginger, by the time it's done - gave my husband instant heartburn. I like other curry tomato soup recipes I've tried more.

Very interesting taste. The spices overpower the tomato taste but it still peeks through a little bit.

this was fantastic! We went a little heavy on the ginger (don't do this! it was a bit much). We ate some of the soup the first day, and saved the rest for lunches throughout the week, it just got better with age! Also, I didn't have cheesecloth, a tea strainer worked just fine.

I made this as part of the meal for a "dinner/movie date" I had with a friend of mine and we both thought it was delicious! He accidentally used it as a sauce for the rest of our meal, but it was really great that way too! I have to say that I made a major change to the recipe...I added some sugar! It was HORRIBLY bitter without it! I also added just a touch of lime juice to help cut the acidic flavor from the tomatoes. The sugar though is a MUST!! I didn't do an exact measurement, but I think it was about a 1/4 of a cup or so...but dump and taste carefully b/c you can always add, but you can't take out! Try it w/sugar...you'll love it...we did!!!
