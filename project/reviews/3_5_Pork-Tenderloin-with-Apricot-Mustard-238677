I was somewhat underwhelmed by this dish. After the reviews, I was expecting a lot more. It was OK - good - but nothing more. I think there are better recipes out there.

This recipe was exceptional! I was stunned because it was so simple to put together. Followed the recipe, using Grey Poupon mustard and a fancy apricot jam. Broiled the top of tenderloin to get a semi-crust. Served with the remainder of the mustard-jam sauce and bulghur wheat. Probably the best dish I've made in weeks! Highly recommended.

i really like this recipe-- i make it for parties frequently. My changes include adding diced, unsulphured dried apricots to the mustard-jam mix as well as some chopped fresh thyme; i rub the tenderloins with this mix then grill them and use the reserved jam blend as a dip.

Delicious and easy for a week night dinner. Used nectarines as I didn't have apricots and it worked very well. Highly recommend this recipe and would absolutely make again. Served with pan roasted potatoes and sauteed baby bok choy (bitterness was a nice contrast to the sweetness of the pork and fruit). Enjoy!

My husband and I were anxious to try this recipe- it had great reviews. The recipe was easy, but both of us just thought it was ok. We couldn't find fresh apricots so we substituted canned, maybe that was the difference, even so I would not make again even with fresh apricots.

Made recipe as written, with exception of not having fresh apricots. Pork tenderloin with mustard/jam mixture was delicious.

This was excellent with peaches, which are easier to find in this area. My husband loved it.

This is a great tasting, easy, and quick recipe. The only real change I made was to add all the garlic to the mustard mixture using more garlic than called for. Believe it or not, I couldn't find apricots at 5 different grocers. It was suggested that I use plucots. The flavors worked great together. I served this with a very high cal, over the top Mac 'n Cheese with Garlic Bread Crumbs (this site) and borccoli.

Served at a dinner party. Everyone loved it. Extremely easy to make and quick. Will absolutely make over and over again.

This was delicious! We failed to read the recipe and ended up coating the pork in the apricot-mustard mix as well (so no garlic) and it turned out great -- I'm going to repeat the jam-mustard mix for easy winter dinners. Also, we didn't have a meat thermometer which wasn't an issue, however it did take longer to cook than specified.

It was a nice summer meal, but the apricot/mustard glaze really overpowered the sweetness of the apricots themselves. The sauce was great for the pork, but I prob. would put less sauce on the apricots next time. I roasted some baby bliss potatoes with onions and mustard to complement the meal, and paired it with a good German Riesling - which could not have been a better choice. Worth making because it's quick, easy and takes advantage of seasonal fruit.

I thought this recipe was delicious however, I made a two significant changes to it. Instead of apricot jam, i chopped up dried apricots into small pieces and added them to the mustard sauce. I retained the fresh apricots but I'm not sure they made much difference. The recipe was much less sweet and more apricotty. I also substituted pork for chicken pieces and after the chicken was cooked in the mustard and apricots, I broiled the tops of the pieces just to give the chicken a nice crispy crust. It was good enough for a dinner party!

This was one of the best meals ever!! The fresh apricots with the garlic made the meat the tangiest and tastiest I ever had. Great pairing of the two. It was definately a treat and so easy!

I thought this was pretty good, loved the sauce, but probably wouldn't bother with the fresh apricots again.

I agree with victoria 13 though I cooked the rice in stock with some sage. perhaps I am a bit of a hooligan, ha ha, but I must say the result was divine and even my wife and daughters gave me the thumbs up. Many thanks victoria 13 I would never have thought of rice

My husband adored the sauce, I loved the broiled apricots. Nevertheless I felt I could have kicked it up a notch. I used one tenderloin slightly over a pound. It was a bit large; in the future I would slit it and stuff with garlic and mustard; perhaps allowing the meat to marinate in the garlic- jam-mustard as well. Otherwise, a wonderful simple recipe for a weeknight with little time to spare. Served with basmati rice spiced with a little cardamom and broccolini.
