I have made this a few times, with very ripe kiwis. This time, I forgot to reduce the sugar and it was much too sweet, as the lime concentrate also has lot of sugar, I think. Will try it again with reduced sugar or with fresh lime juice as indicated by another reviewer.

I turned to this recipe because I have an inordinate amount of kiwis from my CSA box. It turned out wonderfully and is so easy to make. I followed one of the other commenters recipes for the limeade concentrate (I didn't want to run to the store) and it worked great. Also, I substituted in a tangerine and a mandarine with a few limes to get to 1 cup. I'd like to try this again with just limes, but we were short (again, just trying to get rid of those kiwis) but the citrus combo version still tastes great and kept an overall green color. Lastly, we don't have an ice cream maker. I poured the mixture out of a food processor into a shallow dish and froze it over night. The next morning I spooned the frozen slush back into the food processor and churned it up. It turned out great! Now that I know how easy sorbet is, this summer is going to be awesome!

I made this with the lime recipe from Kelly (below) and it turned out wonderfully! My guests all seemed to like it, but my husband said it had a weird "stinging" or "numbing" feeling on his tongue, which he blamed on the kiwi seeds. Don't know quite what he was talking about, but nobody else complained.

My family loves this recipe. My kids say it tastes like frozen Sweet Tarts. Once I used fresh lemon instead of the lime, but don't recommend making that substitution. The lime really brings out the flavor of the kiwi. Be sure the kiwis are very ripe; otherwise the sorbet will be too tart and you won't get the full kiwi flavor.

Thanks For The Tip Kelly!

This is absolutely sublime. I used fresh squeezed lime juice instead of the concentrate. The texture is amazing and the taste pure and tangy!

I thought this was just ok. All my guests loved it though (and I'm pretty sure they just weren't being polite) so it just might be me. I liked that it was different to any other sorbet I'd seen or made and it was pretty to look at but I thought it was a bit odd tasting. I would never serve this on its own but in a wine glass with other sorbets it was quite nice.

To the cook from Mexico: I don't know what the lemonade equivalent would be but we don't have limeade concentrate here either but you can make it using the following recipe- 1 cup lime juice, 1 1/2 cups water and 1 1/2 cups sugar. Boil the sugar and water together to make a sugar syrup and then mix it with the lime juice. I haven't made this recipe yet but will be making it this weekend for guests so hope it tastes as good as everyone says :)

This was so easy and great tasting. It's the perfect light dessert after any meal. I also made a mango sorbet; the sweet-tartness of the kiwi-lime was a perfect foil against the sweet-smoothness of the mango. The green & orange color combo was eye pleasing too.

I don't have an ice cream maker, so I poured the processed mixture into a shallow pan, froze for two-three hours, then put it back into the food processor. Then I put it into a regular container and froze it for about three hours. Excellent!
