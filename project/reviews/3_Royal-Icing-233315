I also used egg whites in place of the relatively expensive powdered egg whites. I adjusted the amount of powdered sugar to achieve a consistency more condusive to icing cookies. After a little practice with application I had beautiful iced cookies.

Easy, good, tasty. I subbed 3 egg whites for the powder/water combo and added lemon extract. Good consistency.
