Made the arugula mayonnaise to put on a buffet with lunch meats and other stuff. My guests wound up using it as a dip for the crudites-- another delicious use for it. I'm not a big mayo fan, but I could seriously eat this stuff with a spoon.

A perfect snack for the Olympic Opening Ceremonies...along with hummus and veggies! Only recommendation: CUT OFF THE CRUSTS FIRST before adding all the yummy ingredients. You don't want to waste ANY of the arugula mayo!

I'm clearly not into the American way of thinking that you throw a huge bunch of stuff into your sandwiches yet! I guess I went a little too easy on the mayo, and in doing so I think I lost a lot of the flavour of this dish. Can't bring myself to pile it on in huge quantities though!

This is a very yummy sandwich. Great for a light lunch. Keeps well for several hours, in fact gets better as flavors deepen. Use homemade mayo for the best taste.

These were fun and yummy. The mayonnaise was delicious with the smoked turkey

The arugula mayo was scrumptious! My husband and I joked that we could have left out the turkey. We added very thinly sliced tomato, which wasn't necessary but did add a little mroe character. We will try the mayo on two other sandwiches: roast beef, and chopped shrimp.

I did like the arugula mayo, but thought it overpowered the flavor of the smoked turkey. I'll bet the mayo is great with burgers.

In response to those asking about storage times... A friend who is a microbiologist shared her rule-of-thumb with me for storing prepared foods. When you combine several ingredients, the one with the shortest shelf life is the one that determines the time limit of the mixture. In other words, for this recipe, I would guess that the arugula would last about 3 or 4 days, so that is the maximum time you should keep the mixture. Of course, that also depends on how clean your hands are when you prepared the food, how well you wash the ingredients, etc., especially when you combine foods with mayonaise, eggs or other foods that cultivate bacteria quickly. Often spoiled foods don't appear, taste or smell 'spoiled', so use common sense and toss foods early rather than risk food poisoning.

Excellent and easy to make. I will make this again.

I made the arugula mayo just to have for my lunch sandwich. I loved it and will use it with tuna next time. No one has answered the question concerning the length of time this mayo will keep with refridgeration.

Amazing. I used whole wheat bread and it was still good but I'm sure it would be simply heavenly with white bread. Also, I definitely have leftover mayonnaise, I'm wondering if anyone could tell me how long it can last?

This recipe is a must for argula lovers. I made it for a picinic and everyone loves it. After reading all the great reviews, I made sure to prepare alot of the pread and I was glad I did. The shallot was omitted since I am not an onion fan. Excellent!!

These were delicious. I plan to make them again on full-sized sandwiches for lunches. The mayo was great (and I made it the night before), and it went really well with the turkey and arugula.

Absolutely delicious and easy to make. Served the sandwich on toasted whole grain bread but I have a feeling you can do this with any bread. The mayo really elevates a turkey sandwich.

The mayonnaise was incredibly flavorful! Everyone commented on how good the lemon peel was in the mayo. It got rave reviews; I will definitely make it again.

Incredible! After making it for a baby shower, and a tea party, I now make the mayo up a few times a month, just for my husband and daughter (she's 2) They LOVE it. Add an english cucumber or sprouts. Yummy!

I was excited to try this recipe after reading all of the good reviews. I was expecting the mayo mixture to be really good because the ingredients sounded like good ideas, etc. but I was disappointed. Maybe it was the mayo I used as the base to start with but it ended up mostly just tasting like mayo. I would not make this again.

Heavenly. I've served these at two separate parties and they've been a hit both times. The strong flavors of the turkey and the arugula elevate these sandwiches beyond ditzy ladies' tea party fare. My husband (a hearty carnivore) loves them. Do NOT substitute a heavy, whole-grain bread, however. I tried that once and regretted it.

It's all about the mayo. This has become a staple in my house. Great with turkey, ham, grilled chicken breasts. Even used it when trying the South Beach diet, a thin layer on a slice of turkey, slice of tomato, roll it up, and voila!

I made this for a very un-lady-like affair.. I'll spare you the details - but it was awesome! I think I will make this mayo and keep it bottled for all my sandwiches!

What an excellent recipe. It was easy to make and delicious to eat. I have made this recipe a few times; the last time I made it, I used roast beef, and it was also excellent.

My favorite of 3 from this site that I made for a baby-shower. This was the most filling of them. Mmm, yummy - I wish there had been more leftovers!

FANTASTIC!!!! I used Pepperidge Farm Thin white bread and it was a hit. The Arugula mayonnaise coudl be used on a variety of different things.

Made this for a "high tea" for my friends who are gourmet cooks. This was a favorite. I loved the arugula mayo it added something special. I didn't know how much I could like arugula.

I have to admit I never made the tea sandwiches. However, the ARUGULA MAYONNAISE is great with many, many fish and meats. Try it on hamburgers, try it as a side sauce for a fresh baked, broiled, or fired fish. Even chicken salad mixed with this is a pleasant surprise for your taste buds.

This was really yummy! We made this for my sister's baby shower and it was a hit. We used french bagette's instead of the white bread. Just cut lengthwise, put all the ingredients in and then cut into small slices and it's a lovely finger food sandwich. Will definitely make this one again.

These are simply divine. They are tasty enough for those who tremble at the thought of putting a bland morsel in their mouth yet they don't pack the dreadful punch of other recipes that get their kick from tons of garlic and wasabi. You really can't go wrong with serving these.

This is a really good recipe, I made these for my son's birthday party, and they were a big hit. I read a previous review about too much arugula in the recipe and bought two bunches instead of four, even that was too much. One bunch from the supermarket was more than enough.

Wonderful recipe. It was the hit of the party.

The mayonnaise spread was so tasty. I do recommend using it on both slices of bread. I used it on just one and had non-stick issues. This is definitely a winner! A wet paper towel placed on the sandwiches before they are served really helped keep the bread moist

The arugula mayonnaise was excellent, but the final sandwich product was just okay in comparison to the three other types of tea sandwiches I served at a recent baby shower. Maybe it was just because the others were so good...?

This tea sandwich was a knock out at a tea party I had for little girls. I had made several varieties for them to try, even peanut butter and jelly in case they didn't like the cucumber mint or smoked turkey. There were 11 girls age 7-8, and 5 adults (I really made the smoked turkey for the adults to enjoy) Well, the girls loved the smoked turnkey & arugala sandwiches and the cucumber & mint were good too! - but the peanut butter and jelly were left behind. We love this recipe - Allyson Good

I served these sandwiches at a luncheon celebrating my daughters first birthday. They were a big hit will all of the (adult) guests and were the first to be eaten. They are very easy to prepare, and the mayonnaise can be made the day before. I only needed one large bunch of arugula, not 4 as the recipe stated. I will definitely make these again.

These were soooo good. I agree 100% with the previous reviewer - my situation was very similar - made it for a tea party and they were devoured before any of the other foods!

I made this recipe for a tea-party I had and this sandwich was a huge success. With so many sweet things this was a perfect counterbalance, besides the fact that it was incredibly moist and tasty. They loved them and ate every single one and I found myself making extras. Excellent.

Delicious and simple to prepare...I used mixed mesclun greens instead of straight arugula, and they were happily devoured by all. I'd like to try the arugula mayonnaise on turkey burgers.

I actually took a chance & made these sandwiches for a superbowl party! I wasn't too sure how well it would go over with the men. I did use good Portuguese wheat rolls to make it more appealing for them. I am happy to say they were a hit!
