I have to say that I really like the squid with cornstarch - fried it in canola oil - it was very light and tasty with just salt and pepper. I have calamari in every restaurant that I go to and this is definately better than most. Served this with fennel/leek stirfry and homemade tzatziki and curry aioli. Yum!
