So simple and so delicious - my guests loved it and so did I. The important thing to know is that some of the ingredients you need to include are on a different recipe - look for Roasted Turkey with Herbed Bread Stuffing and Giblet Gravy. Make sure you include the additional ingredients for a moist stuffing - it will still brown nicely. Lastly, I used fresh herbs (and increased the amount) vs. dried but otherwise followed all steps and loved it. Would make this again in a heartbeat.

We stopped stuffing turkey over 10 years ago, instead boning the turkey then making a turkey ballotine then brining and smoking it. No gravy, no stuffing, but fabulous! This year, we decided to make a "traditional" stuffed turkey. I had forgotten how to make stuffing so found this recipe. The only change I made was to add 10 ounces of home-made English "banger" sausage -- seasoned with ginger and sage. While our brined & smoked turkey had become a "signature" dish in our home, this is the best stuffing recipe I have found. I would recomend against baking the left-over stuffing, freeze it and use it to stuff pork chops -- add a little blue cheese for the chops.

I got rave reviews for this! The only slight changes I made to the recipe were: added 1 extra cup of chicken broth since I didn't bake it in a bird, used a mix of fresh and dried herbs, and baked it at 325, 45 minutes covered with foil and 10 minutes uncovered.

This came out dry even though I added lots of chicken broth. It was ok in the turkey but the baked part was not very good.

I think I've made this stuffing every year since it was published. It's the best. The only things I have changed are substituting fresh rosemary and thyme. I always use dried sage because it seems to be more flavorful. If you want the best stuffing to actually "stuff" with - this is it!!

I made this *almost* as stated except I added 1 lb cooked crumbled sausage (use Jamestown brand). I also used all chicken broth and extra spices to taste. After I assembled the day ahead of time, I baked covered in the oven for 30 mins or so at 350.

While I have not yet made this, I just wanted to add a note to those that think this recipe needs more directions. The fact is, that this recipe is for a STUFFING... that means that when you are done making it, you must then stuff something with it, i.e. your turkey. If you want something easier and possibly with more complete directions, please search for a DRESSING.

This recipe is a supplement to a recipe for "Roast Turkey with Herbed Bread Stuffing and Giblet Gravy". The instructions for finishing the stuffing are under that recipe. It has you add broth, water, and butter and then bake it.

Let me say first that if you are going to make this stuffing, you need more info than is in the original recipe. I'm making this stuffing right now, and I think it's telling, the number of reviewers who say, "this is GREAT and SIMPLE, all I had to do was (insert 5 extra ingredients and steps)..." And this recipe does NOT indicate actually cooking the stuffing. One of the reviewers tries to help by adding that one must "mix all the ingredients then cook as directed". Well, that's great, except that there's no actual direction vis-a-vis cooking, except the toasting of the bread. Perhaps they mean you to stuff it into your bird. They do not, however, say that. I am following the cooking directions of other stuffing recipes (i.e., put it into a buttered casserole, bake at 325º under foil until heated through, then bake uncovered to brown). Okay, this recipe is a starting point, but by itself it's boring and incomplete. Simple it may be, but it's only great if you turn it into a different recipe. I knew when the onion celery mixture was cooking that it was going to be really bland, and I'd already been generous with the herbs. I ended up doubling the herbs AND adding fresh ones. I also added apples and dried cranberries as well as 1/4 cup more broth and 1/4 cup vermouth (as suggested by a couple of people). It'll probably taste great! :-) Oh yeah, I agree - skip the water.

This is a tasty bread stuffing recipe. I used a generous amount of dry italian seasoning (thyme, sage, rosemary, savory, marjoram, basil and oregano), and everyone said it was the best bread stuffing I've made. It's quick, simple, and tasty. It will be my standard stuffing recipe from now on.

Good basic stuffing, I used fresh herbs, be sure to uncover and let get crispy last 10 min of baking.

Ugh - this recipe is little more than potential. Needs an egg, dried out when prepared as written (cooked in pan at 375F), too few herbs and oomph. So disappointing for a basic dry dressing.

Rating: 3
I made this stuffing with my Thanksgiving dinner this year. The next time that I make it I will double the quantity of the herbs, since I felt that the taste was a bit too subtle. I like a moist stuffing and with this recipe I found the stuffing pan needs to be covered for only the first 15 min. of baking.

To the cook from Heidelberg, yes, I think they forgot part of the recipe. You should assemble everything. Do not bake until you are ready to serve. This can be made a day ahead. Then, when you want to cook it, take it out of the refrigerator and bring it to room temperature. Then cook it according to the directions.

A question: when do you put it in the oven? Recipe says to preheat oven, but there's no mention of oven later on. Just stir together ingredients and then cool completely. So does it get baked or not? I'm kind of assuming it does... but then how long? And if it does get baked and I want to make it 1 day in advance, do I bake it on the day before and then reheat to serve? Or do I chill it unbaked and then bake for the first time just prior to serving? Your help is appreciated.

I am hosting thanksgiving for 20 people and decided to do a test run of stuffing this weekend. WOW! This was great! The dried herbs worked perfectly, the aroma was amazing, and the stuffing was awesome! My hubby  the tester  was looking for leftovers. I did take advice from previous reviewers and added the egg. Great stuffing, will make one day ahead.

very good basic stuffing recipe. i made a vegetarian version using pacific brand veg broth, replaced the water with vermouth, and crumbled two vegetarian sausage patties into the mix. prepared two days ahead, then finished by adding one cup broth and an egg before heating for 40 minutes at 375.

Savory and subtle. The perfect Thanksgiving flavors and a total classic. I make it just as written here, including with the (gasp!) dried herbs, and it is wonderful. We look forward to having it every year.

This is my favorite Thanksgiving stuffing recipe because its subtle but very aromatic and flavorful  a nice counterpoint to richer dishes. I make it just as written. Dried herbs work fine if they are not old or stale. My 22-year old son called for the recipe yesterday, so I think it is on its way to becoming a generational staple.

I skipped the bread crumbs part, and substituted it with pepridge farm herbed stuffing and then added everything else plus 1 egg. My husband who insisted that the only good stuffing ever came from his mother (who won't share her receipe), thought that this by far beat his mother's. Next time we are going to add some sweet uncased sausage.

My grandmother has a recipe similar to this but for extra moistness she adds applesauce which also gives the stuffing a sweet/savory flavor.

This is very similar to my Mom's stuffing but she added an egg, diced bacon that had been sauted till almost crisp, the bacon drippings and instead of the seperate seasonings she used Bell's seasoning to taste.

A nice stuffing that doesn't overpower the other flavors in your Thanksgiving dinner. However, there is nothing "special" about this stuffing.

My family and I thought this had too many onions and celery. It was also dry. It needed more broth or something.

Excellent! I felt that this needed a bit more chicken broth. I think Iused two cans. I also added sauteed mushrooms and sprinkled pan drippings on top prior to baking (at the suggestion of previous reviewers). I made this TWO days before Thanksgiving and just brought to room temp. before baking... AWESOME!

Very nice-- used a mix of leeks, white and yellow onions, substituted dry vermouth for the water, and added an egg. Fresh herbs add a lot of flavor (gotta be chopped up very fine to give even flavor in such a large amount of bread) Had to make two batches for thanksgiving, so on a lark I added some GimmeLean sausage-style soy-based meat substitute to the second batch (sounds weird, but that batch got rated as tastier by all present) Might add some mushrooms or finely chopped nuts another time.

I thought this stuffing was delicious! I did add the egg, cooked the stuffing at 350 for 20min, then 10min uncovered. Didn't add any more butter or liquid, and the stuffing was very moist. I did use fresh herbs.

Just made this recipe. I added chopped walnuts and used 2 tsp fresh sage instead of the dried. Tasted the mix prior to putting in the egg (thanks for the tip)and it is really yummy! Will pop in the oven at 375, 30 min. covered, 10 min. uncovered prior to serving. Looking forward to tasting it with all the Thanksgiving trimmings!

I'm making this today and noticed that one problem with the recipe is it is not a stand-alone -- it ran as part of another recipe in Gourmet. So not all the directions are here! Here's what the original recipe says to do with the stuffing if you are going to bake it in the oven separately: Increase temperature to 375°F. Stir together 1/4 cup chicken broth and 1/4 cup water and drizzle over uncooked stuffing in baking dish. Dot stuffing with remaining 2 tablespoons butter and bake in middle of oven 40 minutes while turkey stands; for moist stuffing, bake covered entire time; for less moist stuffing with a slightly crisp top, uncover after 10 minutes. I'll come back to rate it after we taste it tonight!

To the cook in Seattle - you asked a really good question! The purpose of the egg is typically to bind the stuffing together, so you would crack the egg, wisk it, and add it to the bread mixture and mix. It will make it a little moist too. Good luck!!!

for beginner with egg question - I hope you get this in time for 10 cups I would beat 2 extra large eggs and mix them into the stuffing just before baking It is used to bind stuffing Don't cook it with the veggies The great thing about this stuffing is that you can play with the recipe with many different ingredients with fantastic results. Happy Thanksgiving !

After reading all the reviews I have a beginner's question: How do you add the egg? I can't imagine everyone is suggesting that you add one egg directly to 10 cups of bread crumbs and adding it to the saute mixture will cook it. Any advice?

This stuffing was very delicious (for a person that is not a big fan of stuffing). My family just raved over this and I'll have to make it again soon. I used organic bagette bread and cut it into 1/2 inch cubes. Followed the recipe pretty much, but cut back on the onions since my children don't like onions. It was delicious!

FOR THOSE OF YOU WIHT A BREAD MACHINE HERE IS YOUR CHANCE TO USE IT!!! This is a very easy recipe. I have been making a variation of this for several years now and will again this week. I have 30 people every year for Thanksgiving and need to triple this recipe in order to have any leftovers. I also increase the herbs and stock and add 2 or 3 eggs depending on how dry the bread. If you have never made stuffing before GO FOR IT this is as easy as it gets

What a wonderful recipe! I made this for my first thanksgiving dinner at my house and everyone loved it! This coming from people who aren't stuffing fans, was a big compliment. During assembly, I sampled it and did add about a 1/4 tsp more spices and an additional 1/2 cup of stock. Don't listen to me though! This was my first attempt at stuffing and all I have to compare to is Stouffers! :) I will definitely make this again though.

I agree with the egg but I also recommend sliced almonds and mushrooms. And I sprinkled poultry seasoning over the bread cubes before toasting them.

Pretty good stuffing. Was a little more moist than we would have like but that could be from when we basted the turkey and the liquid got in. We stuffed as much as we could in the turkey and baked the rest in an oven dish.

I have to admit I didn't really measure anything, just went by sight, so I probably added more broth, since my bread cubes were very toasty. I also added an egg because my mom always did that. Baked some in a dish and most in the turkey. Both were excellent, basically my ideal stuffing. I ate it cold out of the fridge for the next three days. People who are worried about moistness--add an egg!

This was a good stuffing. I used smaller sized bread cubes, and would probably go even smaller next time (maybe a quick pulse in the food processor). Used all stock based on others recommendations.

Reading all the other comments, I guess we must have widely divergent view of what a turkey-stuffing should be. The taste was fine but what about eggs to bind it together? We found it a bit soupy.

My mother makes the ultimate stuffing and this almost compared to it. As the others said, replace water with chicken stock and add more stock so it is moist. I used fresh sage instead of dried and added more than the recipe called for. I'm made it last Christmas and I'm going to make it for Canadian Thanksgiving in a couple weeks. This is definitely a winner!

This is a good recipe to start with. Make a few modifications and it's great. Find the largest ready-made bread crumbs you can find -- too small and the stuffing loses any texture. Cook the onions without the celery until they're close to being carmelized. Add the celery for the last few minutes (it will finish cooking in the bird). Use a mortar and pestle to get all the flavor out of the herbs - especially the rosemary. Forget the water, increase the chicken broth 1/2 cup. Add Add 1/2 cup sweet vermouth. If still too dry, add more broth. The vermouth imparts a really nice flavor with the herbs. You can also take the giblets, minus the liver, you boiled to make the gravy, finely dice them and add them to the mixture. I'll make this recipe again and again.

Kudos on this wonderful stuffing recipe. The aroma of the herbs is festive and delicious and toasting the bread in the oven a bit as suggested gives it the perfect consistency. I used a day-old french bread and took the advice of other reviewers to cut the bread into smaller cubes. I served with a roasted turkey, mashed potatoes, rolls and cranberry sauce.

At Thanksgiving, this got great reviews and a request for the recipe from the only other guest who cooks. I made it (the day before) just as the recipe stated, then right before I put it in the oven I added about 1/4 cup minced fresh thyme leaves, about 8 medium minced fresh sage leaves, and about 3 Tbsps. minced fresh rosemary leaves. I poured on 1-1/2 cups canned chicken broth, covered it with a piece of buttered aluminum foil and baked for 40 minutes at 350; then uncovered and baked for another 20 minutes.

A great traditional stuffing; I also added 1/2 cup of It.flat leaf parsley, as well as scallion(green onion). Forget the water, make it 2 cups of stock instead, also bake it for 15min @ 350, add more stock if it gets too dry...it's a can't miss!!

Delicious and simple! We like lots of flavor in the foods we cook, so I doubled the amounts of herbs in this recipe. The result was an incredible aroma while cooking the onions and celery and a richly flavorful end product. Oh, and use homemade broth if you can! As other reivewers suggested, I kept the bread cubes (I used a loaf of crusty french bread, yummy!) slightly smaller than the recipe advises; they adequately soaked up the wonderful flavors of the herbs and broth and didn't wind up just being large chunks of dried-out bread. This recipe makes enough to stuff a good size turkey; in our 11-pound bird, we could fit only half. We baked the rest in a glass baking dish at 350-degrees for about 20-25 minutes, until it was heated through and was nicely browned on top. A great, traditional, simple stuffing recipe.

Agree with other comments about making the size of the bread cubes smaller (to make sure they soak up the broth) I also add sausage (Jimmy Dean Hot) which I fry into small crumbles which really gives this a tangy bite.

This stuffing turned out wonderfully. I would however make the bread cubes smaller, they were a bit large for my tastes. I paired it with the carmalized onion and balsamic gravy (also from this website) and it was delicious. I will definitely be making this a staple in my holiday meals.

This is a really great "stove top" stuffing - it's so versatile... you can add raisins (or any other dried fruit), nuts, mushrooms, pears, apples, etc. And, you can use generous helpings of whatever fresh herbs you like. It's easy and fast, which are pluses, especially when making a turkey in the oven. Or it's great made a day ahead.

This will become a favorite of mine! No more boxed stuffings for me. I served this on Thanksgiving and got rave reviews. I made it two days ahead of time and kept it covered in the fridge. I drizzled turkey giblet and pan drippings, stirred it up and put it in the oven just before serving to get it warm and crispy on top. Great flavor from the herbs, although it could have benefited from texture like chopped mushrooms or something different. Great as a leftover, too!
