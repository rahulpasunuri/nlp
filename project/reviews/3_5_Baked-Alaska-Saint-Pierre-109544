I had great success with this dessert, it was not as complicated as it sounds. The only issue I had was with the sorbet, it didn't freeze solidly and was a bit difficult to get out of the pan. But definitely worth the effort; the meringue was fantastic!

For génoise 3 large eggs If I were to make this again, I would use egg whites to make more of a sponge cake and give it more volume. I haven't tryed it yet though! It's waiting for tomorow!

I can sympathize with the cook from Atlanta--I could easily have made such a mistake--I think the last portion of this recipe is confusingly written. If I were to make this recipe, I would line the 2 8" cake pans with plastic wrap, and then freeze the ice cream mixture and sorbet in each of them, as directed. That way the next day I could remove the frozen mixtures and wrap each tightly with plastic wrap and refreeze them until needed for the cake. Then I would bake the cake in a vacated 8" cake pan. (I don't have a 9" pan.) Also, when it comes to assembling the ice-cream cake (minus the meringue), I would assemble the cake layers on a 10" aluminum pizza pan--not too pretty, but practical, and it won't break!!! I definitely would make this cake in stages, as it sounds time consuming.

This was absolutely delicious! Of course there will be a few dingbats who will not use common sense and will break glass cookware.

My son wanted an ice cream cake for his birthday and instead of buying one I made this cake and it was a success. Everyone loved. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

Hardly worth the effort. If you bother, be sure to use a non-glass cake plate. My favorite one broke in the oven (freezer to oven, I didn't consider, a note in the recipe would have been helpful). Needless to say, that was a disaster.
