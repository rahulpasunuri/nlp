I made the Almond Frosting only, to pair with the Cinnamon-scented Devil's Food. Very easy to make, delicious.

Question ?? Any way to cut this recipe in 1/2 without losing its flavor or creamy-ness? I have only a small cake that I am using the frosting for I don't need 7 1/2 C of frosting, any help?

I've never bothered making the almond version, but the vanilla is the best -- smooth, creamy, and fluffy.

This really tasted good, spread well. I found it a little too powerfully almond flavored, however, so I would lessen the amount of almond extract next time.

Delicious and simple. I have made this many times. Easy to make a 1/2 batch for cupcakes.

I followed the proportions that one of the other reviewer's gave below and it was fantastic. I made the almond buttercream for the cinnamon-scented devil's food cupcakes. They were a huge hit. I made this a day ahead and kept it in the fridge and frosted the cupcakes the next day - I won't do that again. I couldn't get the same consistency after it came back to room temp. The original recipe seems like it woudl be WAY too sweet for me. I will make this again for sure.

Awesome Frosting! OK I admit a serious almond addiction. Half this recipe is enough to cover a 2-layer cake with some left over. All my guests loved it.

I used this frosting recipe for a chocolate birthday cake (Double Chocolate Layer Cake, on this site, fabulous cake). Good basic buttercream & MUCH less work than the classic, which calls for eggs & beating over the stove & using a thermometer. However, for my proportions, I think the sugar quantity should be half what the butter is -- that's about as sweet as I can take it. Also, I found that the longer you whip the butter in the first place, the whiter it gets, which is great when you're going to be adding food coloring. I made 1/2 the recipe for frosting my cake, and I did add the almond extract, which was lovely.

I give this recipes four forks after modifying it. I used 4 sticks of butter, 2 cups sugar, 2 tbs cream, 1 tsp vanilla and almond and then extra of both to taste. This was very creamy and because I cut way down on the sugar it had the perfect amount of sweetness without being too strong. This frosting is so delicate, I absolutely love it.

I am not a fan of buttercream frosting; but this almond one is a perfect accompaniment to the cinnamon-chocolate cupcakes.

I made 1/3 of the recipe to go with the orange-cardamom cupcakes (on this site). It's very easy to make and easy to handle, even my 10-year old daughter didn't have trouble piping a simple design on top of the cakes. Like other reviewers, I cut way down on the sugar, tasting as I went along until it was sweet enough for me.

This frosting was simple to make, delicious, and easy to work with. Like some other cooks, I used less than one box of confectioner's sugar (1 pound), and it was PLENTY sweet. A pinch of salt made this recipe fabulous. I used this recipe for a layer cake, and made the whole batch vanilla. Definitely a keeper.

This is an easy to make standard frosting- and it looks beautiful on a chocolate cake. The only thing is how anyone could use all the sugar recommended. Unless your taste buds are dead or numb- the prescribed amount of sugar is WAY too much. I made it with 1 lb (1 box of Domino's confectioner's) which is less than 4 cups and this is bordering on too sweet. Cut back on the sugar big time and you are in good shape. I used this amount for a 2 layer cake and had plenty to spare.

I made the vanilla frosting for the Orange Cardamom Cupcakes for this site. I only made 1/3 of this recipe (mini-cupcakes), but otherwise followed recipe exactly. The frosting was excellent. Just the right balance of creamy, rich and sweet. I got lots of compliments from everyone, and even had a couple of people ask for the frosting recipe, specifically.

i made half of this recipe (i only made the chocolate cupcakes), but i slowly added the sugar, eventually using only about 4 cups of confectioner's sugar. the almond frosting turned out very light and tasty (i enjoyed it, and i'm not even a big frosting fan), and i got tons of compliments. would definitely recommend, as long as you cut back on the sugar a tad.

Very delicious and complimentary of the cupcakes. I recommend going by the weight of the confectioner's sugar as opposed to the cup measurements.

All buttercream icing is too sweet for me, but this one was pretty good. I used it on a rich chocolate cake and everyone loved it.

Very easy to make but I did not like this frosting - too sweet.
