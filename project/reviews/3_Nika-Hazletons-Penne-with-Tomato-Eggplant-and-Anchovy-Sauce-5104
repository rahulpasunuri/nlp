Nice receipe - and yes, use salt- packed anchovies - it's such a massive difference. I used fresh tomatoes because they were very much in season and quite juicy. Other times of year, I would just use the canned (not the dreadful pink "fresh" things). Anyhow - yummy stuff. I added a couple table spoons of toasted pine nuts because I just love mixing eggplant with pine nuts. Not sure if it needed it, but it didn't hurt :)

I didn't have fresh basil or tomatoes, so I think the dish suffered from that. Also, it was too winey tasting.

A wonderful recipe! I roasted the eggplant slices in the oven instead of frying: spread 2-3 tbs oil on baking sheet, flipped slices in oil as I placed them on pan, put them in the oven at 400 degrees and baked 15 minutes while I cooked the rest of the sauce. I used the canned anchovies (no need to rinse), about seven filets since I love their taste, but next time I'll use the whole can (~10 filets). The addition of the wine in the end really enriched the flavors. Delicious!

I was looking for a use for 2 eggplants and what I had in the cubbord, so I doctored up a jar of Barilla Onion and Garlic tomato sauce with the rest of the ingredients. I'm glad I had fresh basil on hand. I agree with previous poster that only salted anchovies need to be soaked (not specified in ingredient list, but noted in instructions "to remove the salt"). The anchovies just melt into the dish and are not identifiable, just a nice deep back note. Nice, and I'll be trying it again with tomatoes instead of pasta sauce.

This was pretty good - the white wine really makes it work - in the future I would follow the hints from the test kitchen about baking the eggplant slices while the tomato sauce cooks. Halved the recipe except for anchovies and could have used even more, they pretty much disappear into the sauce.

I couldn't believe this recipe has been neglected, I thought it was just wonderful. Made as written, but halved it for two. One note, I used canned anchovies and see no need to soak them. I think the recipe may be referring to the dry, salted variety. The canned fillets started to fall apart and lost flavor when put in water. Next time I will just give them a quick rinse.

This was delicious. I didn't have garden plum tomatoes ready so I used canned. Also, I used a very thick spaghetti "bucatini" because I did not have any macaroni in the house. However, everything worked out fine.
