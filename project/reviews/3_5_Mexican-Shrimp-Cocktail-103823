Super yummy - fresh, flavorful, and healthy. I made sure the tomatoes were pretty red - that is where a lot of the flavor comes from. Would def. make it again. Some reviewers added cumin or olive oil. I could try that, but the flavors are really good without. Reminds me of the lime and salt chicken in the gourmet cookbook, which should be here on this website.

I would give it 4 forks w/a few changes -- I have made it several times and each time I have added either a chopped fresh or pickled jalapeno or serrano pepper; I also added 1/3 cup olive oil and some pickled jalapeno juice & or apple cider vinegar because we prefer a spicier version of this recipe. If you know you are having guests, it is not a problem to make a day ahead and add the diced avocado at the last minute before serving with either tortilla chips or water crackers.

I chop up the shrimp and add it to the sauce and serve it with tortilla chips. Yum!

I also added jalapeno and cilantro. With those changes I would give it 4 forks fabulous and light with tons of flavor.

I made this receipe the first time for a Mexican dinner party. Everyone seemed to like it. I added a little olive oil as I thought the citrus flavor was too tart without it. I also added cilantro which was a plus. The second time I made it I also added some ground cumin. next time I think I might try adding something, hot. I think the receipe, as is, though good needs some zip.

I live in an area with a Mexican Restaurant on every corner, owned, operated, and employing Mexicans. I can get this dish readily nearby, and it is not as chunky as this one. It comes in a goblet and you have to fish around with a spoon to get the shrimp out. This one is very tasty, however, I added cilantro and hotsauce. Adding tomato juice would make it more like the traditional ones I have gotten in local restaurants. I say use this as a base and doctor it as you like.

I make this all the time, but I make it as a dip instead of a salad or coctail. Everyone loves it.

I didn't make this exact recipe, but one like it. The recipe I had was great! Try cooking the shrimp in the juice of 2 limes and 1 cup water. Add to the tomato mixture, 1 tblsp chopped carrot, 2 seeded/chopped jalapenos (less if you don't want very hot), 2 tblsp snipped cilantro, 2 tblsp olive oil. Then serve the shrimp and salsa mixture over a bed of finely shredded lettuce. It was great!

This was just ok - not enough flavor - I would rather make a gazpacho using some hot sauce and adding shrimp to it.

I put about a 1/2 tablespoon of habanero chili powder in the salted water with the shrimp to give the shrimp a little spice. I also added cilantro and jalapano peppers to salsa. The salsa was too chunky to dip the shrimp in, and I wanted more of a coctail sauce, so I pureed the salsa before i added the avacado and served it in the skins of four avacados. I made guacamole out of the rest of the avacadoes.

I made this for a neighborhood gathering, arranging the shrimp on a platter around the chopped tomato mixture. The salsa was too chunky (even with everything chopped fine) to dip the shrimp into, and we wound up using tortilla chips to scoop up the salsa and then topped off the chip with a shrimp. Though rather messy to eat, it tasted delicious. Everyone raved and the platter disappeared within minutes. I added some hot sauce to the salsa for some zip, and doubled the recipe altogether. This is a wonderful summertime appetizer, fresh and cool.

I added cilantro and jalapeno to the tomatoes. Served it in brightly colored martini glasses with shrimp around rim. Very pretty and delicious.

Neat dish. Do not add all the salt - just add to taste. I added more shrimp and mixed the shrimp in with the salsa and served with spoons. Everyone loved it.
