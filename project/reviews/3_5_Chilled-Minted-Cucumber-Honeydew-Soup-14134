Deliciously light and refreshing . . .

Found this much better as an appetizer, not dessert, by adding garlic (1-2 cloves), lemon juice (2 tsp) and a dash of your favorite hot sauce. Actually served as a kind of amuse-gueule between snacks and dinner at a dinner party - served from a pitcher into small cups.

Four forks, but only if you can get your hands on a truly divine melon. I used to buy melon for this recipe from a Persian green grocer who carried only the best (or none at all!). I don't live near him anymore, alas, so these days I hardly ever make this wonderful soup.

I thought this was good. It definitely needs the salt and pepper to bring up the flavors--it's pretty subtle. It would be a nice complement to a spicy summer dish.

EXCELLENT...not necessary to pass it through a sieve. I always double the honeydew and add more lime juice as well to keep it from being overwhelmed by the cucumber.

Really nice for the summer. I followed the recipe to the letter except I didn't strain it. It is not necessary.Very quick and easy.

I didn't care for this recipe. It was more watery than I expected and frothed up unattractively in the blender. I ended up adding the rest of the honeydew melon, 3 tbsp sugar and an extra container of yogurt, and liked it much better.

This is a terrific summer soup; refreshing and flavorful. In fact, I like it better than just plain cucumber soup--it has a few more notes in it, thanks to the honeydew. I didn't strain it through a sieve; just put it in the blender (not in batches, either), and it was perfect. Served it with curried chicken salad for an easy weeknight summer dinner.

This is now my favorite chilled cucumber soup recipe! I don't have a fine sieve -- only a colander whose holes are too large -- so I did not strain the soup. It made no difference; it was excellent. I served it as a main course and found it made 2-3 main dish servings.

Yuck is all I have to say.

This soup is really wonderful in the hot summer months when we don't want to use the oven. Just make sure that the melon is ripe and yummy or the soup will flop. We have use many different types of mint from the garden - all delicious. A pinch of salt brings all the flavors together. We did try it with whole milk yogurt once and found it a little too tangy. All in all a fantastic recipe that will wow your guests!

This soup was delicious! I'm not a big soup fan, but this had just the right amount of sweetness.

I might try this again....without the mint. I love the melon flavor, and the idea of a cold soup (I wish I could find a recipe my mother used to have for a cold berry soup--that was delicious!). The mint overpowered the melon flavor to me, so I can't fairly judge the rest of the product. I don't think I'm going to be able to eat it all, though!

This soup was great. I served it on a hot, humid night, and my guests loved it. I was embarassed to admit how easy it was (the only time consuming thing was passing the soup through the sieve). I'm making it again tomorrow for company.

A very easy to make, healthy soup. Perfect for a summers day, plus guests don't realise you have served them ``diet" food. An ideal dish for those who are watching their waistlines and their cholestrol levels. For those not weight watching a dollop of sourcream and finely julienned or grated cucumber makes an attractive finish to the top of the soup at serving time.
