Um, wow. It was so good last night that I bought more asparagus so I can make it again tonight. I substituted Rittenhouse Rye for the scotch, and added a little sriracha. Because I'm that way.

My girlfriend and I had this for the first time tonight as a side dish with singapore noodles and it stole the meal. Delicious!

I only used the sauce in this recipe - I doubled the sauce (except the soy sauce, I kept that at the original level) and added broccoli, snow peas, carrots, chicken, and shallots. While it would've been a little bland on its own, it was delicious after I added a bit of sweet chili sauce. Just the right amount of sweetness, spice, and depth of flavor. The doubled sauce recipe worked just fine, even for all those veggies - even had a bit left over. I didn't double the cornstarch, either, and while it was a little runny, I wouldn't have wanted it to be too much thicker. I'm making this again the same way I did it last night!

Delicious and easy. I used a teaspoon of hot chili oil instead of the tablespoon of vegetable oil to reduce fat and punch up the spice.

I made this but used broccoli, carrots and snow peas instead of asparagus. I also added red pepper flakes to make it spicy. It turned out to be pretty good--not earth-shattering or anything, but good. It was very simple to make

Very good. Don't let the other reviews keep you from making this. The beauty of this recipe is that you can have your spices and big flavor and/or heat in the other dishes that you make that accompany this. It compliments them extremely well. I very highly recommend! Not a superstar recipe, but one that is extremely versatile.

Simply amazing. Perfect compliment to any Chinese meal. It taste just like it was made in a restaurant.

Oh that's good! My husband usually likes his asparagus limp but he snarfed up every crisp bite of this and commented several times on how good it is, and how perfect with the teriyaki salmon it accompanied. If the sauce quantity is doubled, shrimp or chicken or pork or beef could be incorporated beautifully.

This was fine, not great. I think this will be better over rice, than as a side dish. Was looking for an Asian style recipe for asparagus. Added some red pepper flakes. Served it w/Chinese roasted chicken thighs & Asian cole slaw.

Very, very delicious and not too complicated to prepare. Still, I don't think I would make it again, as I don't see that this is so much better than plain asparagus.

Very yummy!! It's so quick and easy to make, too.

A group of us made this and added shrimp, sugar snap peas and water chestnuts to make it an entree and it was a great success!

This was very good. I think it could use some heat - maybe in the form of chili garlic sauce or just chopped chilies. But it was definitely a nice addition to an asian meal, and went well over rice.

This is very good. Good compliment to pork, as it has the asian flavors. Next time I might cut the cornstarch down a bit. Might also try adding chicken or shrimp to the stir fry.

This recipe is quick and easy to make. Even my young son asked for seconds. I made a large pot of rice and poured the extra sauce over it. It makes a great vegetarian entree.

We also made this to go with the Grilled Lamb Chops with Asian Butter Sauce. It was outstanding!

This recipe had me excited as I found it so easy to prepare. Along with its wonderful flavors and texture it was lovely to look at as well. I served it over basmati rice for a vegetarian entree. This is a keeper.

Great way to enjoy asparagus. I made it with under 2 pounds of asparagus..which resulted in more sauce to enjoy mixed with the rice. Perfect for me! Would highly recommend.

We served this dish with an Asian butter rack of lamb (see receipe file) and it was awesome! We used pencil thin asparagus instead of larger pieces cut in half. Will make this again and again.

I use to make a variation of this dish all the time. But when I made this recipe, it was far beter then the one I use to make. Everyone loved it...... a winner.

Like the reviewer before me, I also served this asparagus dish to guests during the weekend with Honey Ginger Salmon (see recipe file) and steamed jasmine rice. It is every bit as wonderful as everyone says. We finished the meal with Lemon Almond Buttermilk Loaf with Balsamic Strawberries, which was also outstanding (see recipe file). Our friends said they couldn't think of a restaurant experience when they've had a more enjoyable meal. All three of these recipes are keepers and work well together as a menu.

I microwaved the asparagus. The dish came out great. I found that when the sauce boiled, I needed to cover the skillet for a few minutes so that the asparagus were cooked enough. I served it at a casual dinner party with hoisin-genger glazed salmon and everyone asked for the recipe.

IF YOU DO ADD CHICKEN OR SHRIMP, DOUBLE THE SAUCE RECIPE, THE CHICKEN SOAKS SOME UP.

Absolutely the best side dish Epicurious has to offer. A must try. Goes well with anything and easy to make.

This was delicious, and nice that the aspargus can be steamed ahead, just stir-fry quickly to serve.
