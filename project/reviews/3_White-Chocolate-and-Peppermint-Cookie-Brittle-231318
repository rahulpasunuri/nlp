A pretty good cookie. After reading other reviews, I cut the baking time to about 23 minutes for a chewier cookie and that worked well. I cut the amount of peppermint by 1/2 cup but think it would have been fine with the whole amount. After crushing the peppermint in a food processor so that the "sprinkles" would be smaller, I added the residual "sugar" to the melting chocolate. Also, to ensure that the chocolate adhered to the surface, I broke the cookie apart before I drizzled the chocolate. I'd make them again.

I have made this several times...I took to a party, and almost everyone ask for the recipe. I am not a peppermint fan, so I reduce the amount of peppermint.

It is soooo nice... I've looked at several recepies but this one took me strait away. But I've done em without the peppermints. Easy to prepare, extremely delicious and they were eaten after about two days (even in my german family, where they are not really into eating cookies). Just enjoy preparing and sharing them!

Wow! SOOOO Sweet, it's like eating straight sugar. Definitely cut into SMALL pieces if you're going to put them out for people to eat. I would have enjoyed more cookie and less brittle (as a previous reviewer said), and couldn't get my top layer of white chocolate to "drizzle" on top. Instead, I got big globs that fell from the spoon (probably from lack of experience with this technique). I'm going to stick to the traditional chocolate "bark" recipe. It's easier to make, and tastes much better.

Considering several reviews that stated that cookie was too brittle and drizzled white chocolate topping came off, I thinned topping white chocolate with a few tablespoons of milk. After cookie cooled just a few minutes, I applied thinned white chocolate more like a frosting. Cookie then took on a very crunchy & chewy consistency; peppermint pieces adhered fine and the end result was an extraordinary treat!! A definite keeper!! Thanks!!

I made this recipe as a gift for the teacher but I should have read the prior reviews. My cookie was far too dry and it doesn't taste that great, either. Back to the drawing board...or mixing bowl...for something that is actually worth the effort!

Wow! This is perhaps the best "cookie" I've ever made (a liker of crisp cookies). This is definitely a brittle cookie, with a great combination of brown sugar, white chocolate, and peppermint. I happen to think that the white chocolate/peppermint combo is better than dark chocolate/peppermint in a cookie...Also, b/c a previous review said they were greasy, I used skim milk instead of butter...and they turned out great! I heartily recommend this cookie, especially for the holiday season!

Everyone loved the flavor of these cookies. However, I had problems getting the white chocolate and peppermint to adhere. When I broke the cookie into pieces, the white chocolate just fell off. Any suggestions?

I found the 30 minute baking time much too long, because the brittle burns VERY quickly. Really watch it and take out of the oven when golden (mine was ready after 15 min). I had to throw half out (the burnt) and found the "cookie" really greasy - recipe not worth the effort.

These are a holiday favorite around my house. They look beautiful AND taste delicious! For those who had trouble crushing the peppermints: I place candy canes in a large zip block bag and crush them with a mallet (it helps to divide them into two 'crushing batches'). If you have too much 'peppermint dust' left over, it can be used to infuse the dough with peppermint flavor, or save it for the end--it sticks easily to the drizzled white chocolate.

This recipe had so many great reviews I thought I would try it. I found that it was too dry, and the peppermint was overwhelming to the white chocolate. I wouldn't make this one again.

I made this around Christmas for the cookie exchange. It was a GREAT hit. My husband loved it so much that he has asked for it twice. Today, his birthday, I am making it again. It's not just for the holidays!

I make many a cookie during the holidays and this one is GREAT/EASY, esp. for gift giving. I skipped the peppermint for the topping - too hard to adhere and not needed!

This was a quick/easy recipe & was a delicious dessert when served with ice cream. The cookie came out more like a crisp/chewy cookie rather than a brittle. Some possible reasons for this outcome: I accidentally added the white chocolate & peppermint to the butter/sugar mixture first, then combined with the flour mixture. Also baked on a silpat mat & just spread the cookie to its edges (approx. the same size as the pan) rather than the edges of the 14"X8" pan, so it was probably a little thicker than the 3/8". When I pulled it out of the oven it wasn't as dark as the magazine photo, either. I had the same problems with drizzling the chocolate (I used what was available at Trader Joes) but would agree that it still tastes wonderful.

I personally loved these cookies - perfect mix of salt and sweet. My chocolate was not so soft so it didn't drizzle quite right, but they tasted great.

These are pretty, taste good, and are great as a gift or for guests. I think the recipe works well as written, just make sure the peppermints for the topping are chopped small enough so they adhere well to the surface with the chocolate icing.

This was easy to make and looks good. Especially for guests or a gift. Next time for the topping, I would break the peppermint candies into the smallest possible pieces so that they will "stick" better with the white chocolate icing.

This was a great new twist on Christmas cookies. Easy to make (except for crunching up the mints), but I would cook 25 minutes so that cookie is not so hard. Definitely invest in the Lindt chocolate. Kids and adults loved these.

I was really excited to make this recipe, but wasn't impressed with the results. I think it might taste better if it were a little more "cookie" and a little less "brittle"
