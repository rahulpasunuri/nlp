this one of my essential go to recipes for when I need a make-ahead dessert. Its simple, elegant, and unbelievably good. Sometimes I use graham crackers if I dont have chocolate wafers. I also dont bother with the step which includes melting chocolate on the crust. It just makes it hard to cut and doesnt really add anything.

Amazing. Total showstopper. First of all, do NOT, I repeat do NOT use a premade, store-bought crust. It will simply not do justice to this pie. The filling is rich and intense and not too sweet, but the crust is probably the best part. Second, I took other reviewers' advice and left the pie out of the fridge for 30 mins before serving and I had no problems cutting it-- so I think that does the trick. Finally, I added an extra half tablespoon of corn starch to make sure the filling was firm, and I'd recommend that.

Yummy - Got rave reviews on this when I made it for a party. My only complaint was that the crust was difficult to cut. Next time I might just make the pudding and topping.

Very tasty, added another tblspn rum. However, I had trouble with the crust - very HARD to cut. Topping was made on a day that was in 90's and humid - so it (and I) wept. But anyone have any idea why the crust was so hard? It chewed fine, just couldn't cut it. It was put in the freezer for 1/2 hour to solidify the topping.

I love this pie! I have made it many times, always to rave reviews. My deviation is to use 2T powdered sugar in the topping as well as 1 to 2 Tablespoons Grand Marnier. You will not be disappointed!

It was delicious but I too had a hard time cutting the cookie crust. I would skip the chocolate layer on the crust and would work on getting the crust even thinner.

Easy to make and very delicious! I loved the tanginess of the topping and the cookie crust. It's important to use good quality chocolate for the crust and the pudding. Didn't have problems with cutting or serving-- I think taking it out of the fridge 30 minutes before serving helps. Would make it again!

I've made this several times, it is soooo easy to make and comes out beautifully. The cornstarch is the trick, the pudding sets up like a dream. Very chocolately, and not too sweet. I don't bother with the creme fraiche topping, not worth the expense, plain old whipped cream works fine. One modification I have tried is adding some raspberry liqueur with the vanilla and topping the pie with fresh raspberries instead of whipped cream. Highly recommended.

This is fantastic. I don't change anything and it comes out perfectly everytime. My family LOVES it. I highly recommend trying this recipe. It's fairly simple and doesn't take a ton of time but makes a stunning dessert!

When I read from another reviwer that she dreamed of this every day, I had to try it. Fabulous is an understatement! I cut the topping in half, and it was more than enough. I made my own creme fraiche (insanely easy, just need to plan ahead). I will be making this again, and again, and again....

I loved, loved, loved this recipe. I agree with the other review, though--the topping can be cut in half or 3/4. Raspberries lining the bottom would also be fantastic!

WOW!!! it is AMAZING! I couldn't find the creme fraiche but I didn't wanted to ruin it with just whipping cream, so I did a merengue: put 4 egg whites in the electric mixter until peaks form, then add 12 tablespoons of sugar, one by one and finish up with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. I did it yesterday and I was lucky to have one little piece left behind. Let me tell you that the day after tastes even better!!! I'll do it again w/the creme fraiche

The perfect pie for chocolate lovers. I served this on Christmas Eve to rave reviews from family and friends, and I've been craving it since! Might have to make it again for New Year! Followed the recipe exactly. It was quite easy and everything turned out perfectly. Would agree with other reviewers that there is a lot of topping, but loved the flavor - not too sweet - just might make less next time. Filling and crust were amazing!

I love this recipe- the filling is delicious, although I have never made the topping, and topped with whipped cream. I made this recipe for a local pie contest, adding raspberries to the pie pan before dumping in the filling, making the filling with raspberry liquer, and topping with whipped cream and more raspberries- and it won!

Very good, but there was too much topping -- it overwhelmed the chocolate. In the future I would make half as much. Note for those who had trouble getting it to set: cornstarch mixtures need to boil for one minute for proper thickening.

This was a delicious, rich, over-the-top chocolate experience. I used light rum, which tasted fine. Will try espresso next time for variation; coffee really compliments dark choc. Crust was a bit hard to cut into but wouldn't change thing: the flavor was excellent. Sent home a piece for a friend and he called that night raving.Nice combo of comfort food with sophisticated twist. (Used high end chocolate.)

This was really good, everything was perfect and so easy to make. Crust was hard but the pudding and cream was soft so it was a great combination, used ghirardelli chocolate and it worked great! Made too much cream so we used it as berries and cream dessert. This does not taste too rich, it was so perfect

Rating: 3
This pie is extremely rich but good!! When I made it, I used Sharffenberger chocolate, and when my friend made it, she used Nestle chocolate. Hers was definately rich but not as much as mine so I would stick with the cheaper chocolate. I won't make it again though because it hurt my stomach from being too rich.

I have made this twice now and everyone loves it. The crust was a pain so the second time I just made a chocolate graham crust. The pudding set without a problem, but did take longer than the suggested five minutes. I used Grand Marnier the second time around too. Loved the creme fraiche topping...thought it made the dessert.

Rating: 3
Wow! The ultimate chocaholic's pie! It was runny and a bit hard to cut through the crust but it tasted absolutely decadent and fabulous. I wouldn't cut back on the rum - it adds a great dimension and when the pie is served as called for (crust and creme topping) - it works (alone, it probably does overpower the pudding). I would make it again, but it's probably too messy for a dinner party.

Rating: 3
Overall very good. Boo for the crust, though. I agree with other reviewers that the melted/solidified chocolate makes it too stiff. I cut back the amount of rum based on folks' suggestions that it's too strong. I'd probably make it again - I like the suggestion of making pudding cups and topping them with a dollop of the creme topping.

I've made the pudding twice (once as pie filling, once alone), and I've never had trouble with it setting up properly. I think it does take longer than five minutes--you definitely have to wait for bubbles form, and you have to keep stirring once they do. The crust is pretty dense, but if you let the pie sit out of the fridge for a few minuts before you slice it, it's not a big problem. My family--who are NOT chocaholics--loved this pie.

I made this for my husband as a dry run for a dinner party and I'm glad I did. The rum in the filling takes too much away from the chocolate. I had to use an Oreo crust because my grocery store didn't have chocolate wafer crackers.

What a disaster. The pudding did not set up right and was a soupy mess. Crust was too hard and difficult to cut. Threw this one away.

This was my first Bon Appetit recipe,and I loved it. The pie is rich but light, and the tangy creme fraiche topping is a nice balance to the darkness of the chocolate. My only issue was with the crust. I think that coating the crust with the chocolate made it very hard in places, and difficult to fork through. I would probably omit this step next time.

a totally decadent dessert for the dark chocolate lover! I used 1/2 Valhrona 74% dark chocolate and 1/2 Valhrona 56% chocolate and it came out soooo good! Didn't think it was too messy or difficult to serve.

I agree with most everyone here that this should not be the dessert of the year. I thought the taste was very good - especially the contrast between the pudding and the topping, but it was too difficult and messy to cut/serve and there was way too much topping. If I make it again, I will make the pudding and put it in a parfait glass and top it with a little creme fraiche-whipped cream and forgo the crust altogether.

As a bittersweet chocolate lover, I enjoyed this pie very much - the creme fraiche whipped cream is a must! I agree that the crumb crust was not enough, although mine was not difficult to cut. I chilled the pie out of the refrigerator for the hour before serviing (in the cold garage -- I live in Switzerland so I thought this would be ok), but after a night in the refrigerator the pie was set like it should and was delicious. I will make this again and use really good (instead of just 'good') Swiss chocolate!

All in all quite good. I really liked it, my wife's first words were "Wow!". It was also a lot of fun to make. I've started writing about my experience with writing about bon appetit cover recipes on my blog at - http://12monthsofcooking.com. Take a look if you want more details on my experience.

A co-worker of mine just made this and brought it into the office. We devoured it! This is by far THE BEST chocolate pudding and cream type pie that I have ever had. It has been two weeks and everyone in the office is STILL talking about this pie! I loved it so much that I am now preparing to make it myself for an upcoming party. This is going to become a staple in my recipe collection.

This was good...very rich chocolate taste and fairly simple to assemble. I used a store bought pie crust (I know, I know, but I was making lots of other things and had to take a few shortcuts) and just used fresh whipped cream for the topping (grocer was out of creme fraiche). Some of my guests had seconds.

Rating: 3
The crust recipe did not yield enough to make a decent amount of crust. Maybe that's why the crust was very hard to cut through (I used a steak knife & sawed!) Filling was decadent & rich w/ a few modifications. I added 4 egg yolks to the dry ingreds. to make thick paste, and then added all the milk at one time (a real home-made pudding) To the bittersweet chocolate I added 2-oz. semi-sweet to cut the richness somewhat. Too much topping, the creme fraiche made it heavy. Sweetened whipped cream is wonderful. Serve sprinkled with fresh raspberries!!

Made this for Christmas dinner and it's been selected as a repeat dish and asked to be added to the Thanksgiving Day menu. The filling thickened just fine - it should be thick before you take it off the burner. The topping amount initially seemed excessive, so we put some on the side for those who wanted more and there was none leftover. My only recommendation: make the whole thing a day ahead if you can. The chocolate flavor deepened over 24 hours and those of us who got a leftover piece tasted something exquisite.

I made this for New Years eve, and while everyone agreed that it looked beautiful, people found the chocolate much too bitter and the creme fraiche topping too sour. The consistancy was fine, but I agree that the pudding took longer than 5 minutes to set. If I tried this again, I would definitely mix in some semisweet chocolate, and I would skip the creme fraiche and make a more traditional whipped cream topping. Overall, this was a disappointment.

Rating: 2
I loved the flavors, but the chocolate filling didn't set. I cooked until it thickened, chilled over night, but once I sliced it, the chocolate filling ran out all over the plate and pie dish, esp. under the weight of the topping (which could be cut in half to great effect, there is way too much). Any suggestions on the thickening? How thick should it be before you remove from the heat? Would using more corn starch help?

Rating: 3
Made this for a late Christmas dinner, and it was very well received. I, too, had issues with the crust being too hard to cut, and made a mess of the presentation as a result. Good balance between the topping and the filling. Had a hard time finding the wafers, but Nabisco's famous chocolate wafers can be found near ice cream cones at the grocer.

Rating: 3
I added 1.5 tablespoons of espresso and some very spicy chipolte seasoning to the pudding mixture. Those flavors with the richness of the chocolate were exceptional. I would recommend using Dutch processed cocoa (I used Droste). I was not impressed with the creme fraiche topping and there was way too much of it. When I make it again I will use a different topping recipe.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a disaster. followed the recipe, and pudding did not set; after reading reviews realize it should have cooked to thicker consistancy. impossible to cut from the pie plate and on dessert dish. Flavor is delicious (used Valhrona choc., yum), but would recommend trial run before making for company.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner, following the recipe exactly as written but omitting the rum. It looked as yummy as the picture, but for me the bittersweet chocolate/creme fraiche topping was a little too sour. I would perhaps experiment with using a partial amount of semi sweet chocolate next time.

I made this for a pre-Christmas dinner party with friends. I read some of the early reviews and was kind of expecting to be underwhelmed. Suprisingly good! I don't think it was recipe of the year material either, but very good. I was very concerned about my crust turning out like a rock - especially after cutting it, but the crust was not the problem. The melted chocolate layer - while adding a tremedous flavor profile, made cuttine and eating very hard. Will think next time of maybe making a chocoate dipped florentine or tweel (sp?)cookie or something to garnish on top. I cut way down of the ratio of creme fraiche - added jsut enough to make it interesting.

Great recipe...used Ghirardelli bittersweet and it turned out perfectly.

Great recipe! My husband loved it. The pie crust turned out to be a little bit hard, but I believe it's my fault for baking it longer than the recipe asked for. At first I also thought that there was way too much topping. But that's how it's supposed to be and it definitely compliments the richness of chocolate. Creme fraiche worked very well in it! I making it again for New Year's night/

This was a terrific dessert. Except for the fact that I too had to cook the pudding longer than 5 minutes, I followed the directions exactly with great results. VERY rich, chocolatey, and not too sweet. To those who didn't care for the recipe, maybe you used the wrong chocolate OR don't like bittersweet chocolate. To the cook from Madison, if you ended up with ganache, YOU did something wrong. Plus you didn't make the creme fraiche topping (which was excellent! So much richer than regular whipped creme), and you didn't add the rum. If you don't follow the recipe, please don't give a review! As others have mentioned, make sure your plastic wrap doesn't touch the top of the pudding as you would with any pudding recipe. We made this 2 days ahead ( except for the topping) and it kept beautifully. I made Julia Child's favorite creme fraiche: 1/2 pint sour cream and 1 pint heavy cream. Warm together slightly. Pour into container, partially cover,and leave out to sit 8- 24 hours until thickened. Refrigerate. Will definately make this pie again!

I thought this was a great dessert, but I am an admitted pudding fanatic. The texture of the pudding/filling was silky and rich and set up wonderfully and wasn't overly sweet. The rum added a bit of richness, although you can hardly taste it. The filling was offset perfectly by the creme fraiche topping which was sweet yet slightly richer than plain whipped cream. I would definitely use the creme fraiche if you can find it--it really does add a lovely texture and flavor. I do agree, though, that the crust was a bit hard to cut. I assume the chocolate was there to keep the crust from getting soggy, but it was a bit of a pain. I thought this was a great dessert--"homey" but really delicious, and a more sophisticated take on a plain chocolate cream pie. Note--it did take longer than 5 minutes for the filling to cook, so watch the consistency rather than the clock!

OK..Its sets up fine if you let it set overnight as directed...and DON'T put the plastic wrap directly ON the filling. Just stretch it over the top without toouching the filling. Just before you put the topping on, use a paper towel to soak up any condensation on the top of the filling. I did not use the Creme Fraiche since it was not available, but I used 1 1/2 cups of Heavy Whipping Creme, with 1 1/2 TBSP of Sugar and 1/2 TSP of Vanilla and Whisked to soft peaks in a chilled steel bowl, place on top and served right away. Everone thought it was great. Not too rich or sickning sweet..just right for the chocolate fix. I did use a 60% Cocoa, Ghirridelli...don't use 70% or higher...even thought you may think it is better chocolate. I will make again...very easy!! Not sure it should be the dessert of the year, but it was good enough for me to save in my favorites.

I did a trial run on this dessert before serving it for Christmas dinner, and am really glad that I did. While it's good in a Jell-O pudding type of way, it's definitely nothing to write home about. As for the good, the filling set up beautifully, and the topping stayed nice and fluffy for over 24 hours. On the down side, although I used Scharffen Berger chocolate, one of the best quality chocolates you can get, the flavor of the filling and the topping together was, well, bland. I don't know what could be done to improve the flavor. I just won't make the pie again and waste great chocolate when there are so many other absolutely delicious chocolate desserts out there.

Rating: 3
Followed recipe per instructions - I had no troubles getting it to cut clean - and thanks to the comments on the plastic wrap, I used some well placed toothpicks to create a tent to solve the sticking problem. Complex flavors is one way to describe it, but really not a top notch chocolate play for dessert - likely would add more sugar to the pudding mix to sweeten it - which may offset the (sour?) tinge to the taste.

Ok. Here's the scoop. This was not the dessert of the year. It wasn't really a pudding...rather a ganache filling, which disappointed me and my husband. I would surely revise the recipe to make the filling more "pudding" like. I didn't not use Creme Fraiche just whipped cream and did not use the rum. It turned out just perfectly despite the hard filling consistency. I will not make again and would suggest that you make something else. It's really not the "dessert of the year"!

This was good, easy to make. It wasn't that easy to cut but didn't end up destroyed when cut either, maybe I chilled the chocolate layer too much. Did make WAY too much topping. I would half it next time. I didn't put the topping on until the end and had no problem with plastic sticking.

Rating: 3
O.K. this was really yummy (the rum may have been too much). But I agree with the cook from Ft. Washington. I made two. One I didn't stir long enough (5 minutes is not enough to get it to bubble around the edges) and that one never set at all and was chocolate soup on a cookie crust with chocolate hardened on top. The second I must have cooked long enough, it set more than the first, but still not enough to make it stand up like in the picture on the cover of the magazine. But, who can turn down chocolate cookies, butter and more chocolate? I am not sure if I'd make it again...I'd probably leave out the rum...but cook it way longer.

It's hard to believe that this was rated as "best of the year" It's hard to cut with the chilled chocolate layer over the crust.

Good pie, really easy to make, nothing too special though. Definitely satisfies the chocolate craving, and the rum is a nice little touch, adds an extra subtle layer.
