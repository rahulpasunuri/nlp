Loved this! So easy to make and lots of bold flavor. I used fire-roasted tomatoes and regular (as opposed to low sodium) organic chicken broth. I omitted the fennel, per husband (though I may make another batch just for me with it!). Being of Sicilean descent, I loved the robust and hearty flavor. Wouldn't change a thing. Except next time: I'd make more!

This is my favorite chicken soup. With bread and salad, it is a full meal. Try adding white beans or pasta. Everyone loves it. The fennel gives it a unique flavor.

Light yet flavorful. The chicken thighs stay nice and tender. The addition of chopped fresh fennel also worked. Next time I'll try fresh roma tomatoes. Will make this often. Very good.

I love this recipe. I chose fire-roasted tomatoes and organic chicken stock...delicious. I love the fennel flavor. Always better the next day and freezes nicely.

After making this recipe several times I have concluded that there is too much oregano and perhaps there shouldn't be any at all. It is somewhat overpowering. Next time I will try it without. Anyone else think so?

I bought bone-in chicken thighs, skinned them and cut in pieces. I added the chicken bones to the soup and cooked it 40 minutes. The broth was rich and the meat tender. Bones removed easily and I saved a little money too. The spicy tomatoes recommended by a previous reviewer was also a good idea. Very easy and quick to make. .

Yum! I thought this was wonderfully tasty (thanks to the fennel seeds) & easy to make. My new favorite chicken soup. The only changes I made were to add diced tomatoes with green chiles (here in New Mexico we add green chiles to everything) which added a bit of heat, and I also threw in a handful of orzo (I am not afraid of carbs!). Great week night dinner when there's not much time.
