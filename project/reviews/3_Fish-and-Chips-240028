For the chips use high starch potatoes instead of Russets. Russets are for baking. Use Yukon Gold and the finished fries will be much creamier inside. Cut them 1/4" or 3/8" thick. Be sure and rinse the freshly cut fries well as the cutting will release a lot of the starch. Dry them well after. Follow the chef's cooking directions. He has the correct temperatures and when to take out the first batch. Be sure and let them rest for at least 15 minutes, 25-30 minutes is even better before the second frying. These are correct way to make Belgian Fries. And by the way the debate over Cod vs. Halibut is subjective. In fact any whiting fish, Cod, Halibut, Whiting, or Pollock will be very good. Good Eating!

Great recipe, with a couple notes. As Topstewer noted the amount of batter is crazy-unless those cod pieces are are about 3 pounds each. Can easily cut the amount by 75%. Also, the chips should be soaked about 5 min. and rinsed in cold water repeatedly until water is clear after soaking to remove excess starch.

Cod? Halibut please. Soda water? Dark beer! Double frying chips is correct, but submerse in ice water after first fry to stop cooking...this will result in a crisper chip after the second fry.

excellent food all time favourite,i feel quick boiling of the potato fingers in water for 1-2min and then flash frying it will make the chips taste better

An enormous amount of batter, but a good batter. It was light and crispy. Chips were good too. I like them with mayonaise since I'm Dutch and seem to have no taste.
