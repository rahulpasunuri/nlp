Awesome yumminess and so easy to make! I can't imagine hummus without tahini and this recipe gets it right. I admit to adding extra lemon juice and garlic. I will be making this often!

Delicious! As other reviewers suggested, I reduced the amount of tahini to 1/4 c. and cumin to 1 tsp. and added a bit more of both along the way to taste. I highly recommend home cooked garbanzo beans over canned. The taste is far superior and if you plan ahead it's easy.

I disagree with Chef Bittman's opinion about tahini being more or less optional. When I have had hummus that is soley made from chickpeas, it's very one dimensional and lacks in smoothness as well. Do not forget the tahini. But please refrigerate it. I also contend that cumin is not necessary if the balance of the other flavors is present. It can be added to taste, but is certainly not necessary.

Perfect as is, also great for adapting. To cut calories a bit, I have made it with 1/4 c. tahini and it's equally good. I always used chickpeas I've cooked myself, so I don't know if that makes a difference in texture, but this is really a great recipe with things that I always have on hand.

Wonderful and simple to put together. I added additional fresh lemon juice to taste, along with a touch more extra virgin olive oil. Spreading it on fresh, think pita with falafel made for a great snack.

This is a really tasty base recipe. I have made it multiple times. I add the cumin AND smoked paprika and juice from 1 1/2 to 2 lemons. It is excellent, but you do need to season to taste.

This is a very good, simple recipe to accommodate other food. I use it on things like falafel where I don't want to distract from the other items. I don't use tahini. The one thing I'd suggest is to remove the skins from the chickpeas. It makes the hummus much smoother.

Rating: 4
This was super tasty, as most of the other reviews state. I used 1/2 the tahini and the cumin, no paprika. A word of caution: Taste your chickpeas BEFORE you season with salt. I put just a little salt in, thinking I would start conservatively and then build from there, and I used the liquid from the can to thin it out. When I tasted it after processing to smooth, beautiful perfection it tasted like perfect hummus and WAY too much salt. Tasted some of the liquid, and low and behold, it also tastes like WAY too much salt. I guess it is what I get for buying store brand chickpeas. Of course, my problem is easy to fix with another can of chickpeas (well rinsed this time), but frustrating and now I have a ton of hummus!

Used the 1/4 cup tahini & 1 tsp cumin, doubled the lemon but they were VERY big & my guests said it was a little too lemony, but they still said it was excellent.

Great as it is, but I don't think the tahini is optional and I'd use cumin, not paprika! Based on comments, I used half as much cumin, which tasted right to me. You can always add more if you want.

Just a note.. even though this is listed under Passover recipes for some folks this is not Kosher for Passover. If you are of Ashkenazic descent this doesn't work.

Hummus ingredients vary greatly...quality of chickpeas, type of tahini, tartness of lemon, etc., so rarely is the hummus exactly the same as it was the time before. This recipe worked very well for me. Only used 1 tsp cumin & 1 tsp cayenne(senior moment) instead of paprika. Delicious with some olive oil & paprika to finish.

I've eaten hummus many, many times before, and have made it several times, so I know what it should taste like. And this is off. The recipe is simply wrong when it says that tahini is optional when making hummus. If you don't include the tahini, it's not hummus. To say tahini is optional in hummus is akin to saying that ground beef is optional when making a hamburger. It would be nice if the recipe included an actual measurement of lemon juice (in tsp or Tbsp), since lemons come in many different sizes. Unless your lemon is gigantic, you almost certainly want to use the juice from more than just one. Unlike tahini, cumin and black pepper truly are optional. I prefer the cumin left out, and I've never even heard of including black pepper. If including the cumin, a tablespoon for this amount of hummus would be too much, it would overpower the other flavors (unless you have some old cumin that's been sitting around for a while and lost its flavor). Better to add a teaspoon, taste, and go from there.

Although this is a nice recipe, it should be noted that Hummus is not a food that is for use on Passover. Hummus is made with chickpeas, a legume which is not allowed during Passover.

I love this recipe. I love it in it's original, as-written form, and I love all the ways you can switch it up. I've recently gone off dairy, which played havoc with my "wine and cheese with the girls" evenings - until I found this. Now, I can whip this up nearly as quickly as I can pull a block of cheese out of the fridge... but this is so much healthier (shhh... don't tell the girls), and I can change the flavours as whim dictates (for example - a touch more lemon and the addition of cooked and cooled edamame beans gives it a beautiful, light flavour that's perfect for pairing with white wine. Or I'll add some roasted red peppers, a little more garlic and maybe a dash of smoked paprika for a deeper, richer incarnation.) Can't go wrong with this recipe as a jumping-off point!

I'm ashamed to say the only hummus I've ever had is from a store. I just made this recipe, however, and WOW! Have I ever been missing out on a world of goodness! Dead simple... why haven't I made this before? I made it exactly to recipe this time, but this is a recipe that I can change to my whims - adding in roasted red peppers (as suggested), cooked edamame (great protein!), even subbing in black beans for some or all of the bean portion. What a great recipe - thanks, Mark Bittman!

A keeper. Best recipe I have found for hummos in terms of results, and ease. Husband and teenagers loved. Note: I do like double the lemon, but let the lemon/garlic/cumin sink in and taste after a half hour as they intensify.

Wow, this hummus recipe is truly IT. I followed the directions almost exactly, I only used one can of garbanzo beans (almost 2 cups) and also played with it a little to get it to where I wanted, starting off with lesser amounts. I liked that it said to keep the garbanzo water aside because I definitely used it to soften it up. Mmmm! Can't wait to have a party and make this again!

Rating: 4
I never knew hummus was so easy. We sometimes add roasted red pepper and always use more than 2 garlic cloves to make our own home-made hummus. It steals the party and leaves enough for us to keep some for ourselves. Beware of adding too much lemon as it can overwhelm the more delicate chickpea flavor.

Rating: 4
This is such a simple and great recipe. I didn't have tahini, so added in ~1 tsp quality (i.e., concentrated) sesame oil. I also roasted the garlic in my toaster oven before throwing them in. I meant to take just a small sampling to taste, but ended up eating nearly the entire tub. I am never buying store-packaged hummus again.

I have made this several times - family and guests always rave! Even my son who is a picky eater! So easy to make and blows all store- bought away! I use about 6 cloves of roasted garlic and 1/4 cup tahini and the cumin along with everything else. If using canned beans, you can cut down on the evoo & add more of the liquid. Wonderful!

Excellent recipe. I prefer a using a couple of lemons. Also I cook my chickpeas with a quartered onion, some parsley sprigs, a few crushed garlic cloves and a pinch of asafetida. For a nice change of pace try this with freshly cooked lady peas... really tasty.

Just bought some high quality imported tahini from a greek market in Tarpon Springs FL (HUGE Greek community) and was excited to come home and make some hummus. I only have a small food processer, so I used half a can of beans, juice of 3/4 of a lemon, a tablespoon or so of olive oil, one clove of garlic and a dash of cumin and cayenne. YUM. Nice and smooth with a great strong flavor. Going to use with my Greek marinated chicken kebobs I bought at the same market tomorrow. Great hummus staple, makes store bought look like a joke.

I made this recipe yesterday for the very first time. I followed the directions and proportions exactly as stated in the printed recipe, to set a baseline. I had a huge bag of dried chickpeas in the pantry, so I soaked/cooked them overnight in the slow cooker (on low heat with water). Measured out 2 cups of cooked chickpeas for the recipe and saved the leftovers for a chickpea salad later this week. End result, I personally would not change a thing in the original recipe. It was delicious and my dinner guests loved it - comparable to restaurant caliber hummus - lots of garlic, lemon and olive oil. I will be adding this recipe to my personal cookbook and I plan to make it often. Using dried chickpeas is super-economical and it makes such a healthy and delicious dinner side.

No need to use store-bought ever again. Very easy and adaptable recipe. One can of chickpeas (slightly less than 2 full cups) and 1/4 c tahini was just right for me. Used juice of 1 and a half lemons.

I'm not quite sure about the lesbian/san francisco/hummus connection, but whatev . . . This is a fantastic basic recipe that lends itself well to variations - throw in a few roasted red peppers, some oil- marinated dried tomatoes, whatever suits your fancy. I've even substituted almond and peanut butter for the tahini.

I am straight and not from San Francisco, but I still enjoyed this hummus. I guess it can be enjoyed regardless of sexual orientation, so its a winner in my book. I cut back the tahini as suggested by another reviewer and went with cumin.

I added one full head of roasted garlic and extra cumin and paprika. I used the amount of raw garlic the recipe calls for, but since I also added roasted garlic, next time I will only use one clove of raw garlic (it was pretty overpowering). I used about 1/2 of a lemon and two full cans of garbonzo beans. Overall, this recipe is fantastic. Better than any store-bought hummus I've ever had.

Very Nice Recipe. I make Hummous every week. It is a staple in our house. To make it extra creamy for special occasions, try taking the skins off the chick peas. Our family never used cumin but I have tasted it that way and it is good. For me 2 Lemons are a must. Great post thanks for sharing... Jim

Easy to make and really delicious. I blended the cumin into the mix and then when serving, drizzled a little extra olive oil over it (without blending), then sprinkled the hummus with a pinch of paprika and chopped fresh parsley. If you don't want the garlic overpowering the rest of the ingredients, use one clove and cut out the little root in the centre of the it. Also if it seems too bitter, use less tahini. I served it with warm Arabic pita bread (flat stuff) cut into triangles.

This is truly a well defined basic hummus recipe to use as a foundation. Make it as originally scripted and alter it the next you make it -to your taste. I always get compliments when I serve different variations of this dish. Many reviewers here say it's too bland or that it has too much of this or too much of that. They're all right, since everyone likes their hummus differently. Personally, I use two cans (instead of just two cups) of drained chickpeas and follow the rest of the recipe as is, although I usually add extra lemon juice also. From there you can take it a step further and add any of your favorite roasted vegetables and make it your own. Just be sure to keep the chickpea liquid on hand to get the blender or food processor going.

I have made this a couple of times now. I think it is wonderful, but I do make a couple of changes: I saute the garlic on low heat in the olive oil - it makes for a smoother, less biting garlic flavor. I also add a roasted red pepper. Spices are to taste, used both cumin and paprika. Top with chopped black and green olives and enjoy!!

This recipe produces bland hummus. I had to double the garlic, the lemon juice and used both cumin and hot paprika. There was still something missing. I too agree there is too much Tahini. I didn't cut the olive oil though. As I'm not a purist, I added a few tablespoons of sour cream (greek yogurt would worked too), to produce a creamier result.

Exceptionally easy- I like lots of seasoning, so I used both cumin and smoked paprika, as well as more lemon and a little zest. I used no olive oil, but used a bit of water to thin to the right consistency. I also folded parsley in. Reviews very helpful! Have made three times so far.

Hummus is a wonderfully simple dish. This is a great example of true traditional hummus. Any recipe is dependent upon the quality of ingredients. Different tahinis have different strengths and fresh lemon juice is very different from bottled. Use this great recipe as a starting point to build your own hummus. Everyone has different tastes and no recipe is carved in stone. I prefer to use more lemon juice and oil at the start and then add my beans. This allows the blender to make a smooth mix.

I really liked this recipe. I made it in Honduras, where tahini isn't too readily available, and I more or less guessed on the spices. I also left out the oil. It turned out great even with all the alterations. This is one of those recipes that works more as a starting point and allows for a lot of room for experimentation and adjustment. Definately worth bookmarking.

I'm not sure why this recipe has such a high rating; most of the people who gave 4 forks made a lot of changes to the original. I also thought it called for way too much tahini. I had to add a LOT of extra seasoning and lemon juice to counteract the taste, and it was still overwhelming. Next time, I will use only 1/4 cup.

Not impressed. I followed the recipe exactly and it was bland as could be. Went back and added lots more garlic, more lemon juice and roasted red peppers to give it some taste. Still wasnt as good as the many hummus I've just thrown together without alot of thought. The amount of tahini really overpowered the fresh taste I strive for in my hummus. Lots leftover at the end of the day,,,highly unusual in a greek family!!

Thank heavens we have Bittman. I felt ZERO pressure making this, as is usually the case with his recipes. I, too, added more lemon juice. I also added the parsley into the mix (I like it that way) and some cayenne (not much, maybe one-half to one teaspoon), just enough to give it a wee bit of heat. Perhaps not revelatory, but darn good. And forgiving; add the spices you like to enhance it as I did.
