These bars are fantastic. I've been making them since I found the recipe here in 2006, and they never fail to please.I make a lot of baked goods during the holidays and these bars are a huge reward for little effort - unlike many of the more complicated recipies I've tried over the years. The only substitution I make is to use 1/4 tsp. orange oil instead of the liqueur called for in the filling. Make some!

Incredibly good. I made my own custom filling from cooked pureed dried apricots so I could control the sweetness. If you like almonds, apricots and shortbread, you will have a hard time keeping away from these. I think I ate half the pan myself, so next time I will only make them for company. They are rich and you only need a little. They would be ecxcellent for tea or coffee in the afternoon.

These are delicious. I followed the recipe exactly. I've even tried it with cherry perserves. I think any filling would be delicious in these. Thanks.

I had to make these after reading the excellent reviews. With my changes these are a 4-fork....They would have been much too sweet and too almondy for me as written. I used salted butter and omitted the 1/4 teaspoon salt. I used 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract. I added just a light sprinkling of sea salt after I tasted the finished product because it was still too sweet and I like a multi-dimensional tasting treat-almond apricot plus the sweet-salty. I also lightly toasted the sliced almonds before I added them. The almonds were perfect and not burned after baking 1 hour.

These bars are amazing. I didn't (nor would I) change one thing. Loved by all every single time I make these. My new favorite bar. Fancy them up a bit by sprinkling a little bit of powder sugar on top.

The surprise hit of this year's Christmas cookie platter. They were sweet, but not too sweet, and the tartness of the apricot jam offset the sweet shortbread. I would recommend trying it exactly as written before making any changes. Quite delicious as is!

This is really yummy , cuts nicely and is easy to put together I loved it and so did my friends . I think it was a nice sunny flavour that looked festive for the Holidays . I would certainly make again !

I had trouble finding almond paste, so ended up making my own. Have made this at least 5 times in 2 weeks and everywhere I take it ... rave reviews. I did double the almond paste, mostly because I wanted to use up what I made [which was quite a lot]. I have changed the preserves and combined different ones. Always delicious !!

Mmmm - gorgeous to look at and tasty to nibble on! These ended up being a surprise hit and I couldn't get enough of them. So deliciously chewy, not too sweet, and refreshing after too many other cloying sweet treats, this is going to be a mainstay for the holiday cookie tray and year-round too. Easy and satisfying to make.

Originally got this recipe from a friend who had made them for a brunch party - they definitely stood out amongst all other items at the brunch. Since then, I've made them 3 times and everyone raves about them!! I follow the recipe to a T and it has worked well, I do take the scant cup out earlier, so that it really crumbles well as the top layer and doesn't stick to my fingers! It is a sweet dessert well balanced by the nuttiness of the almonds...very filling after just one!

After reading the reviews I was a little nervous that these bars would be too sweet. I followed the recipe as written and they were delicious. Another plus is that they are easy to make.

Homey and heavenly and easy. My boyfriend, who initially proclaimed he wouldn't eat them because he's not a fan of either apricot or orange, gobbled up three of these within the first 2 minutes of their being ready, and quickly admitted he'd been wrong and they were scrumptious. Just a lovely recipe - I have no qualms at all.

I added this cookie to my Christmas cookie collection. They were a HUGE hit! Unusual and delicious. I have made the recipe 3 times and still only tasted 2, they were gone soooooo fast. I used a 8x8 and trimmed the edges for a prettier presentation.

Very good. A little sweet as written. My solution is to use less preserves... maybe 1/2 of what the recipe calls for. But overall... delicious!

I've made this recipe twice in a week. Very simple. I did double it and it worked well using a 13 X 9 pan, but needs longer than a hour to bake. Also ran out of Cointreau (I prefer it over Grand Marnier) and used Apricot-Pineapple preserves with Rock & Rye Liqueur. It came out wonderful. Took one reviewer's suggestion of pulling the cup of dough out before you add too much flour for the topping. It was a bit easier to deal with. Will continue to make for holidays.

Rating: 4
I didn't have any Grand Marnier and not enough apricot preserves; I used what I could find in my pantry: 10 oz jar of Harry & David marionberry preserves and Chamboard liqueor. The taste was perfect! I do agree with other reviewers that these were a bit sweet, but next time I will use a sugarfree preserve which I have done in the past with other recipes with great results. The cookies were gobbled up today at a work holiday party.

This is my third year making these and they are absolutely fabulous. I have never had a problem with sweetness! I tripled the recipe and baked two 13x9 inch pans, which worked out perfectly. Also used triple sec. They are rich and can be cut small, so I was able to get 48 cookies out of each pan- great for a cookie exchange!

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful recipe. I am usually shy about using salt, but in this recipe, it is important, particularly to help cut through the sweetness of the topping. I would also recommend using Cointreau as the liqueur. I find using this instead of Grand Marnier helps to cut down on the sweetness.

Delicious! Used a pure fruit topping to avoid cloying sweetness, and mixed in some dried apricots I cooked down in water. Very good for a party/shower.

SECOND TIME AROUND, ALSO MADE WITH VEGAN MARGARINE. DISCOVERED THERE WAS NO APRICOT JAM..USED RASPBERRY AND THE RESULT IS DELICIOUS

These bars are very good. I followed the recipe exactly. Here is the only comment that I have... if you do not like a strong almond taste, these are not for you. Otherwise, go for it. They are yummy and simple.

I used half pureed apricots and half apricot jam. The Grand Marnier added nothing to the flavor- I will eliminate it next time.

Update to my posting from July 28: I've now tried this recipe again with reduced sugar (1/2 C. plus just a little), reduced almond paste (1/8 C., packed), increased filling (1 1/2 C.) and orange zest in the bottom crust. It was wonderful -- not too sweet, happily almond-y and fruity, and a lovely blend of flavors. The one drawback I found (and could have prevented, but didn't think to) was that the decreased sugar made the dough quite soft: this became a fork- dessert rather than finger-food. I'll boost the flour a bit next time, to keep the dough firm enough. Enjoy, everyone -- this is a lovely recipe!

I liked this recipe and will make it again (easy to make, wonderful consistency, very rich flavor), but I found it to be far too sweet. I suggest reducing the amount of sugar to 1/2 C. and almond paste to 1/8 C. (I love all things almond, but this was overpowering even for me), and adding fresh orange zest to the dough. I also found the fruit filling to be scarce (I couldn't taste it much), so will increase the amount by half or more (I used all-fruit spread, and will do so again), possibly adding a little fresh lemon juice, to temper the sweet factor a bit.

We all loved these - made them with tart plum jam and left out the liqueur.

Excellent. Only cookie recipe from Epicurious (and I've tried probably a dozen or so from past years) that I will repeat in my annual Christmas Cookie gift bags in the upcoming years. 2 hints: 1. If you are going to double the recipe, use a 10 X 15 pan to get the proportions correct. 2. Pull out the scant cup for the topping right before the dough comes together and then cut in the paste and almonds. Makes it much easier to sprinkle over top.

We also made a batch of these several years ago for a Christmas party, and like others have said, they were a smash success. Now they have become part of our holiday cookie tradition. Delicious shortbread, a subtle hint of orange, easy to make, but elegant-looking: this is possibly my husband's all-time favorite cookie. I'm not sure what to make of the complaints about "richness" or the amount of preserves. I have never altered the recipe and they've always been really excellent cookies, among the first to be eaten off the cookie table. That said, I do cut them into pretty narrow rectangles. But I've never been tempted to change a thing.

A couple years ago I included these in the tins of assorted Christmas cookies I give to friends and neighbors. They were by far the stand-out. Everyone raved about them. Now I make them every year.

I think this is an awesome cookie and will have it every year as a Christmas tradition. I'm not sure I understand any of the bad reviews because it really is a great shortbread and perfect amount of preserves. I omit the orange liqueur when I make these and they turn out great. This is a keeper!

Way, way too rich. If I were to make again would cut preserves in half.

This was a simple and delicious dessert. Great for a brunch or get together. I made it for our teach appreciation day and everyone asked for the recipe. I left out the liqueur because I didn't have any, and also used a no sugar apricot preserve, but it still tasted great. The almond flavor is sooooo good!

I loved these bars! I took someone's suggestion and did half the pan with one flavor of jam (raspberry) and one half with another (persimmon), and I used amaretto in both. Be sure to let it cool completely as instructed (if you can wait!), as it continues to crisp up when cool.

To be a Christmas Regular: I made these for our Christmas party and they were a big hit. My husband who normally does not like almond paste even loved them. They were gone in seconds.

I doubled the recipe and used a 9X13 pan. I should have listened to a previous reviewer and decreased the amount of preserves: too thickly sweet and gooey in the center. I used high quality ingredients, but ruined it by not using top-of-the-line apricot preserves. I'm going to try it again with a smaller amount of better quality preserves. The shortbread part of this is delicious.

Rating: 4
I loved this recipe and have made it a few times. Doubled the entire recipe for a 9 x 13 pan which created a thicker crust (which I liked) but a little too much apricot filling. These bars have a pronounced almond flavor that goes perfectly with the apricot-orange. Made my first batch for a holiday party, froze (about a week) and they tasted like they were made that day. Cut them into small squares because they're very rich.

I don't know why my effort was so disappointing, as I followed the recipe exactly, save for using the availabile 8"x8" pan and no dusting of confectioner's sugar, but I thought these bars were really blah. Rich in the sense that they have a lot of fat in them from the butter and almond paste, but lacking in much actual flavor. I used Bon Maman apricot preserves, too, so I didn't skimp on what should have provided that punch. In light of the cost of the ingredients - considerable - I'd bake my tried-and-true lemon bars over these any day of the week and twice on the weekend. Not a keeper in my book.

I doubled the batch and used the recipe's filling on half the batch, dark cherry preserves on the other. They are both really good! My dough was really soft, I wonder if I accidentally left out a cup of flour?

Everyone loved this recipe. I didn't have any orange liqueur so I used Amaretto instead; and I only had apricot-pineapple preserves. Even with the changes it came out great. I'm thinking next time I might try rasberry preserves with Chambord.

Very good. I think I took too much of the dough for the topping, so my bottom layer stretched a little thin. Next time I will use maybe 3/4 cup mixed with the almond paste and almonds. But overall - yum! I didn't add any powdered sugar, they look great on their own. Can't wait to have another one (or two!) for dessert tonight.

I thought this was a great recipe. I added some coconut flakes when I realized halfway through that I was out of almonds -- really tasty. The only change I might make is to use a bigger plan -- I felt they seem a little thick to me.

Very good fresh and fruity flavour. I thought the almond paste would be overwhelming in the topping but it's not. Also a very pretty looking bar. It did take the full hour to bake and still wasn't all that browned either on top or bottom.

Imade these yesterday-yummy, rich, and almondy! I used Cointreau for the orange liquor, and almond filling(solo brand)instead of the paste. I agree-paste was expensive, filling cheaper, but not much. the topping was gooey (probably more so than with the paste), but they tasted wonderful!! Making another pan to give away for Christmas treats Nice change from chocolate or mint treats

So easy,yet so elegant for a "bar"! I agree about not having a strong orange flavor but everyone who tried them asked what else was in it besides apricots so they tasted something nummy. A winner!

Oustanding! Intense almond flavor, buttery shortbread, and apricots--what more could you ask for?

Rating: 3
These cookies are delightfully buttery and melt in your mouth yummy. The apricot-orange name is a bit of a misnomer as you don't taste any orange at all. Although I didn't have any Grand Marnier on hand and used Triple-Sec instead so that may have something to do with it. Would also like to find something instead of the almond paste because it's so expensive.

Rating: 3
My husband, who loves anything almond, loves these cookies. I was suspect about the long baking time and worried that the topping would burn, but they really did take an hour. The topping gets very sticky around the edges, so definitely wouldn't want to skip the buttered parchment paper step or you will never get them out of the pan.
