Made this with fresh mint instead of parsley and let it sit in the salt mixture for only 1/2 hour, but it was still delicious!

Delicious as a first course - very light and showcases the fresh pasta.

Simple, and very nice. Obviously you need to use good quality olive oil. Other herbs along with the parsley would also be good.

I made this dish on Christmas Eve, and although it is simple, it was very pretty and festive. A great recipe if you love lemons!

Simple dish with rustic flavors. To other reviewer who substituted items in the recipe: you were making an entirely different recipe so why even rate this one!

Sorry, but thought it was just okay. Perhaps better as a side dish... Dish was plain and uneventful.

I added one sliced roma to macerate in the oil with the other ingredients. I used a liberal amount of Kosher salt and even squeezed in some of the lemon juice. I only had one lemon to work with, and that was plenty. I didn't need copius amounts of pepper - like the recipe notes said. AND, I didn't have any tagliatelle, but I did have some potato gnocchi, and that was dreamy with this sauce. I was in pasta heaven.
