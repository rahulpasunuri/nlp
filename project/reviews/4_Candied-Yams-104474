i made this recipe to accompany Christmas dinner, and it turned out beautifully. Everyone loved it. I suggest using the butter - I dotted veg with about 2 tablespoons total.

I made this with just a few modifications, most suggested by other reviewers: used a zester tool for the orange (which produces very fine strings - excellent for this recipe); used a few good shakes of ground cinnamon instead of sticks; doubled the ginger; and covered the pan with foil the first 45 min so needed to baste just once or twice in 15-min intervals after that. My only criticism is that it was too sweet for my taste and my husband's. (I love plain baked yams with skin on, but I made this for a big holiday potluck which called for a fancier preparation.) Next time I will halve the maple syrup.

This was a huge hit at my Thanksgiving table. I do not like the overly sweet recipe with marshmellows. I had pecan syrup in the pantry so I used it instead. Absolutely MARVELOUS

I haven't had candied yams in years...I've always thought they are too sweet but for some reason....I wanted them...and boy oh boy were these great...I followed the recipe exactly and covered them will foil as suggested. They were not overly sweet ..just wonderful. I'm thinking you could also use this recipe to make candied carrots.

This recipe is a staple in my family for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Its so much better than the over sweet marshmallow dishes. It was an instant hit. I tend to leave my sweet potato slices a little larger and cook it longer so the juice has time to caramelize. Great dish!!!!

i have made this recipes many times. use just sesame oil. can cut potatoes into a dice, but will still need to baste. the trick to making the syrup is finding a sweet orange: squeeze as much juice as possible and then as much pulp without the pith, separate the pulp...then, it'll reduce into a nice thick syrup: don't worry about going over 1/2c orange juice, but at least a 1/2c. otherwise, you can reduce the leftover the liquid over the stove. add 2T. of fresh ginger, add as much as you want. i add probably 1/4 c. i love this recipe! it's so flavorful and not too sweet. the orange zest without the pith turns into candied orange peel. this is incredibly tasty and sweet; don't throw this out! it's also a beautiful presentation addition.

The key is covering the yams for most of the cooking to avoid the mixture from drying too fast, keep basting, and remove foil when yams are almost cooked through. Then, the sauce thickens nicely.

i've made this recipe a couple of times, and it's so wonderful. don't throw out the orange zest. it is so yummy and sweet after it gets candied, but make sure you remove as much of the bitter pith as possible and it's very decorative looking. if you're glaze doesn't thicken in the oven, reduce the sauce on the stove and then drizzle it over the yams and the orange zest, which makes it look even more appealing.

A very elegant version of candied yams. It's made for every holdiay meal at our home and no one tires of it. The key is the freshest ingredients and high-quality maple syrup. Definately a keeper.

I used sweet potatoes and brushed the mixture on thin slices, pre-oiled with an olive oil and sesame oil mixture. I baked at 400 for about 15 minutes per side which made great "crisps" that I put with fresh berries and a dollop of whipped cream. Excellent textures of moist and crisp.

This was really delicious. I basted as indicated but kept foil over the dish until the last 15 minutes and used sweet potatoes instead of yams. They retained a beautiful bright orange color and the wedges were moist but not mushy. We'll definitely serve this again.

I'll make it again to see if I did something wrong, but on Thanksgiving day what came out was absolutely inedible. It was the first Thanksgiving my family celebrated without yams, but they were truly awful.

This was a great version of candied yams. I added some dark brown sugar for a little extra flavor and also cut the yams into smaller portions than the recipe recommended. Everyone loved it this Thanksgiving!

Rating: 2
With all the other rave reviews, I was expecting something better. I used a 8x8 baking dish and probably didn't baste enough so the syrup was to too runny. Next time I would add brown sugar and use a larger dish.

In attempting to produce a healthier Thanksgiving dinner this year, this recipe was the perfect alternative to the usual candied yams with loads of butter, brown sugar and marshmallows. I loved the unique addition of the sesame oil. I do admit that I prepared these the day before, but sprinkled with 2T. of brown sugar while re-heating them. The foil suggestion was right on.

This recipe is fabulous. The suggestion for using foil is a great one, too. Thanks! Instead of orange peels, I used kumquat peels and a 1 inch peel of lemon. This gave it a little extra flavor, but it really is great on it's own. I love the ginger and cinnamon and orange all together, and it makes the house smell SO good when it's cooking! For those who's recipe failed, I just don't know what to say!!

Everyone loved these yams! The citrus and ginger gave the yams a zing without being sickeningly sweet.

This was really, really nice! The yams were wonderfully tender, and the flavor was subtle, but oh, so divine! I wanted to eat the whole pan myself and not give any to my husband or kids. Our ten month old especially loved them. I've got a houseful coming for Thanksgiving, including a couple of soldiers recently injured in Iraq, and I'm sure that this will be a hit!

I took a chance with this dish to make for a Pre Thanksgiving Feast, for 200 very pickey co-workers. I multiplied it by 6 and started pealing. Wow!! What a hit. The ginger and maple syrup with a hint of cinnamon is outragious! They raved about it. Thank you so much. This is going to be a nice lite addition to our Thanksgiving meal. I simmered everything except the Yams, including long stripps of Orange Zest and Cinnamon sticks for 45 min the night before then put it together the next morning. Very easy and what a reward.

This is sure to make your friend's and family's favorite list. Even the most die hard canned yam eaters will be lured away and into a a lovely melody of sweet yams, real maple syrup, orange zest and spice a-plenty. If you have been making yams from a can, you never will again after this recipe. Very delicious !!!!

Great! I served this as a side dish, and a single recipe was enough for 12.

If you make this and expect to have left overs, you should increase the quantity per person. Personally I thought the yams were good but the maple syrup made it a litle sweet for me. However, the rest of my guests for Christmas really raved about this dish so I would say it deserves four forks. As recomended by another reviewer I also covered it with foil for part of the cooking to decrease the amount of basting.

To be honest, after reading the reviews I was a hesitant to try this recipe. I though the same thing - with those kind of spices and ingredients, how could these yams be bland?! I was pleased that this dish was hit at our Christmas dinner. In fact, a few guests were not big fans of yams to begin with but ended up going back for seconds and thirds! To cut down the number of times they needed basting, I covered the dish with foil for the first 45 minutes and only basted once. I removed the foil for the remaining 30 minutes and basted 2 or 3 times. They weren't the least bit dry and just full of great flavor. I've already received several requests for "my recipe"! Excellent dish and a welcomed addition to my holiday menu.

I can't understand why the others would rate this poorly...bland? with ginger, orange and maple syrup? Maybe your yams were bad - try organic - flavor is much better. This was OUTSTANDING. I made one dish but it was gone before Thanksgiving dinner was served so I had to make two more dishes! For the first batch I followed the recipe exactly. For other batches I reduced salt by half, grated orange zest, used meyer lemons and increased butter a tad (never hurts!) The first batch was great but then when we tasted the second batch...WOW - FIVE forks! Yumm! Am making again for Christmas.

I wouldn't make this recipe again if you paid me! Tried it for Thanksgiving and they were barely touched. Even went for the sesame oil/butter combo suggestion. Threw the leftovers out - didn't even see if the dog wanted them. Had such high hopes.....

It was not overly sweet for our taste, and the ginger added a nice touch. But it was also a little bland for us.

WOW ROX! Thanks for the advice. I made them last night along with Cornish Game hens with sweet potatoe risotto and cranberry sauce (also on this most excellant web site) to a family four thumber feast. We will make these again. Baste these often during preparation. ps tried the endive,argula and orange salad recipe from epicurious.com for the compete menu.

These were really, really scrumptious. I am going to make them again very very very soon. I highly recommend using 1/2 sesame oil and 1/2 olive oil, or if you love sesame oil, all sesame oil for a buttery taste. Rather than mucking with the nestling steps, I food processed all the sauce ingredients together before pouring them on the yams (so instead of cinnamon sticks I used 1 teaspoon of cinnamon - that was a lot). I also bumped up the Ginger. I also recommend heeding the basting steps as they ensure getting the sauce all over the yams, as well as adding a little bit of water to the pan 3/4 through cooking if the sauce starts to carmelize in the pan. It will come back to life instantaneously. You must make these!!!

I prepared this dish for Thanksgiving. There were no leftovers. I enjoyed it because the yams had a great zesty flavor & were not soupy. I'm going to prepare this dish again for Easter Sunday.

The juices never became syrupy enough and were very runny for a poor presentation. Definitely mild compared to traditional recipes. Planning to make sweet potato pie with all the leftovers.

This was delicious! The ginger flavor is very subtle but adds a little "zing."
