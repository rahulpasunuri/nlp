I'll echo the advice to wring out the apple a bit -- I made this as directed and the mixture was very wet. And yet, despite that, the patties were a little dry. I'd suggest using ground dark meat rather than white meat for the extra fat. Try substituting tarragon for the sage, too -- it's a nice change of pace.

yummy! i followed the recipe exactly and the patties were easy to form and cook in my stovetop grill pan. i did take the advice of previous cooks about squeezing the moisture from the apple and chilling the chicken mixture before forming the patties. the result was perfect little "burgers" that were delicious with the sweet & sour red cabbage recipe from this site.

This sausage was delicious! I had my husband make it for a potluck while I made butternut squash risotto. He doesn't like to cook, but he didn't mind this recipe at all. We used ground turkey as I couldn't find chicken and we tripled the recipe (for a potluck). I wouldn't change anything. The blend of flavors was fantastic. We cooked it in a grill pan to save time, but I bet over a fire would add a great smokey flavor. Just be sure to flatten the patties out so they cook in the middle. We'll be making this one again!

This chicken was really moist and tasted delicious with brie on top. It was a little too liquidy, but I think I just need to master shredding the apple.

Pleasantly lighter and less greasy, yet mistaken for pork sausage. + Easy to mix up. (The juices caramelized a lot on buttered stovetop skillet; will go for grill or alternate cook surface next time.)

Made several batches of these sausages for a baby shower and they were a hit. We followed the suggestion for squeezing the water from the apple and had no trouble with everything sticking together, though we didn't grill them, just cooked them in a skillet on the stove top. the only change I'd recommend is to increase the salt a bit.

Was recreating the recipe from memory and left out the sage and egg. Oops! It was still delicious and I had no problem with the patties falling apart in my skillet. Next time, I may caramelize some onions or shallots and add that to the mix.

These are really great. I did as others, and squeezed the juice from the apples. I also used chicken thighs, they are more flavorful and moist, and they only add a little more fat. My son ate 4 patties, and could not believe they were chicken. Have made them many times.

these are so good. it makes regular breakfast sausage seem like grease laden grisly gross fest. these sausages are really flavorful with a really nice lively texture.

Site just ate my post so here it is again...These were excellent, I was very surprised at the great flavor! I grated the apple and squeezed dry, added lots of dried sage from the garden, and some bread crumbs to keep them together better. Chilled about 1 hour before cooking and grilled about 12 min total on indoor grill pan and still very moist. Will try with turkey, etc..in the future!

As others I was surprised at how much I liked this dish! I grilled them inside on my grill pan, about 6 minutes each side and they were very moist. To the recipie I grated and squeezed dry the apple, added lots of dried sage from my garden, and also added some bread crumbs so they would hold together better. I chilled them in the fridge for about 1 hour before cooking. Excellent, will try with turkey, etc.. as well. Thanks!

Made this recipe when I had some ground chicken and no idea how to get rid of it. We were pleasantly surprised! It was so easy and tasted just like 'real' chicken apple sausage; minus all the preservatives! Will definitely keep this as a staple recipe.

I'd never made sausage before, so I was a little dubious about doing this, but I was so pleased with the results. These were really delicious. I'll make them whenever I want sausage at breakfast from now on.

I eat no red meat and very little chicken, and both my husband and I thought this was superb. I shredded the apple and then squeezed out all of the moisture. I had no trouble with the patties falling apart. Just do on a very hot-ridged pan and do not turn the patties for at least five minutes. You might even roll these in the shape of links and serve on a breakfast buffet. Great recipe!

Made this for breakfast with an omlet. And used dried sage instead of fresh, and did not use the allspice. It was awesome! even my 18 mo old loved them.

I add 1/2 cup almond flour and an extra egg to make sure the mixure binds properly while cooking. Tastes like your favourite sausage, only it's low fat - I just have to have it with eggs or it doesn't seem right!

We,ve made thhese twice and really enjoyed them. The first time I did not oil the grill and they stuck some. Also as suggested by one of the reviewers I took the moisture out of the apple. The second time I followed the recipe exactly but added about l tablespoon of chopped shallots. They were delicious. WLill definitely make these over and over.

Very, very tasty dish. I even got my 5 year old to eat it. That's the highest compliment I can give any dish.

The taste was great... light, yet flavorful. When the patties were made, it did not seem like they would hold together for the grilling, but they did, without a problem. I will make this the next time I have friends over for brunch.

Talk about an easy way to use ANY ground meat! I've made this with both ground turkey as well as ground chuck, and both times it turned out great. Plus, I'd never really used sage much before (who knows why) and now I've become a huge fan. I served this dish with mashed potatoes blended with low-fat ricotta cheese and ... you guessed it-- Sage!

My husband and I loved this recipe. However, instead of chicken, I used ground turkey breast (fewer calories) and extra sage. Otherwise, I followed the directions to a "T." Our "burgers" were moist, did not fall apart on the grill, and delightful to the palate. I also mixed up some nonfat mayo with chipolte peppers and adobo sauce and roasted red peppers and served on a multi grain bun. Viola a flavorful and unique supper.

To avoid the patties falling apart on the grill, especially if the chicken mixture seems too moist, try adding 1/3 cup or more of dry breadcrumbs. Allow the patties to cook for 5 full minutes before trying to turn them, too. Finally, I'd recommend adding crushed fennel seeds and a little chopped fresh thyme to this, too, for additional flavor.

I made this for dinner on the 4th of July and it was great! It was easy to prepare and grill and delicious! I highly recommend it. We'll definately eat it again. This whole issue of Gourmet was filled with great recipes.

To the person that said there is no sausage you should eat out!!! Sausage is what you want it to be not the crap you buy in the store. when you make this dish try serving it with a chutney it will bring out flavors you have never had before.

At least one ingredient is missing from this recipe. There is no sausage.

joseph was right, as is this recipe does suck.... so i changed it and it was awesome i shredded my own chicken (becuase you never know what you're getting in pre ground), and instead of shreading the apple i diced it finely and ended up only using about 1/2 of a medium granny smith, left out the egg, added ALLOT of garlic ground fennel, rosemary, thyme, oregano, basil, and marjoram... a dash of cayane, little minced onion.... let it all sit togehter for a few hours and then sauted the patties in a high quality ev olive oil, served it with a spicy nectarine and cranberry relish and it was great oh, also drained as much liquid as possible from the chicken pulp and apples, (pressed with paper towels).... had no problems keeping it togehter and the flavor was great

Worst recipe I ever tried. It should not belong in Gourmet Mag. It fell apart on the grill. It tasted terrible. I tried cooking it two diffrent times and both times were bad.
