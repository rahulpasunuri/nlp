This has become my "go-to" recipe for Korean Ribs. Love the flavor, love the tender beef, love the ease. I do marinate overnight, or even pour the marinade over the ribs and toss into the freezer until ready to BBQ. Excellent.

Delicious and easy to make, and an authentic recipe. I usually add some fresh ginger for added punch and depth of flavor. I've also subbed in lime or lemon juice when kiwis weren't on hand, and it still came out great.

The marinade itself was very good; however, we used it for tuna which we think was to heavy for this marinade .Next time we may use a lighter fish .

Very good! The family loved it. I didn't have any kiwi. I used an apple instead. I heard that an asian pear is also a good fruit to use for tenderizing. The short ribs were marinated for 4 hours and I used a nonstick pan. It is too cold to use the outdoor grill. But you have to make sure the garlic & fruit are off the meat. Otherwise, it will starting burning and smoking up the house. Turned out great and tasty! I will definitely try the kiwi next time to see if the meat is more tender.

Excellent recipe. No kiwi? Substitute 2 Tbsp lime juice. I only make it this way and we marinade overnight, grill the short ribs and pull off the meat to make fresh rolls.

I made these last night for dinner. Made a few changes - tossed the beef with sugar, then instead of rubbbing the kiwi on the beef, I put it, along with the rest of the ingredients in the food processor. I also added a little fresh ginger. Marinated the meat 2 hours, and grilled it on my wolf indoor grill. Delicious!!. My kids loved it. Will def make again. Great balance of flavors....might use a smidge less sugar next time.

It can be made without the kiwi and is still as wonderful. I had never had bulgogi and always heard about it from my past roomate. He raved and raved about it and I found this recipe many years later and he was right. This recipe is amazing!!!

This was delicious...but does anyone know of something I can substitue for the kiwi? My huband is allergic and wasn't able to eat any. The rest of the family didn't complain though!

This recipe is really good. I didn't have any sake, so substituted mirin - the extra sweetness did no harm, particularly since these ribs aren't overly sweet to begin with. The ribs were falling apart tender, which caused my husband some grief at the grill. I felt they were still missing a little sparkle and realised after the meal that I'd forgotten the kimchee! My husband was still craving them a few days later (ironic since we rarely eat meat in this household), so I made them again, but using a different recipe with no kiwi and where the sugar is mixed in with the soya sauce, etc. The 2nd recipe was certainly easier to grill, but the meat was tougher and drier with a certain "stewed" quality to it. The kiwi and brown sugar in the first version gives the meat a delicious caramelisation (sp?)that was missing the second time around. So, to make a long story short, this recipe won the taste test. Grease your grill well and perhaps add a few red pepper flakes for additional zing.

Excellent recipe. Flavor was terrific and meat was so tender and juicy.I followed it exactly and we loved it. I have had kalbi at several Korean restaurants in Seattle and these were better.

This recipe was not very good at all. Did not taste anything like the sweet yummyness found at our local Korean BBQ. I was disappointed.

I've had better. While it was tender and had good flavor I didn't love the texture of the meat. I wouldn't prepare this dish again.

Yum, yum. Great flavours that accent the beef, not mask it. Really a nice way to barbeque. I've done this with serloin and entrecote also, and then sliced the steak before serving, making a more shareable dish. A huge hit.

this dish turned out to be the accidental hit of the bbq. i substituted the rice wine with sake and a teaspoon of sugar, and i used beef chuck short ribs from costco, which were only $2.99 a pound. came out great and got rave reviews from everyone.

Outstanding, especially when grilled over a hot charcoal fire--nothing like a little wood-smoke to add to the flavor! The beef really falls apart if you use too much kiwi, so err on the side of caution and use just a little fruit.

This was wonderful. I learned how to make these many years ago from the wife of a Korean student at Univ. of Colorado. Hers were good, but these are better. Maybe it was the kiwi, but they were incredibly tender.

Purchased boneless short ribs at the asain market. The kiwi juice certainly did the trick. The ribs were falling apart they were so tender. Served "plate lunch" style with macaroni salad, rice, and spicy kimchee.

This recipe is great! The trick of letting the meat sit after using brown sugar was perfect! (My roommates & I have tried various recipes in the past...always resulting in very salty kalbi). I've heard of kiwi in other beef recipes & think it works wonders. Will definitely use this recipe again!
