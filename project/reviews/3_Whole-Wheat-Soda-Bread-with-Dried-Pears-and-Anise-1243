I loved the flavor and texture of this bread - and it was fast and easy to whip up a couple of loaves. The pear/anise combo is inspired. Wouldn't change a thing. I'm thinking this may adapt to incredible scones for Christmas morning.

Although it is difficult to find dried pears in the midwest, I have made this bread several times. It is DELICIOUS warm with cream cheese spread on it!

I've been looking for a recipe for dried fig and anise bread. Santa Barbara bakery used to make one, and I've had the one from Il Fornaio. I'm willing to try this with dried figs instead of the pears.

This was...certainly different. I don't think I'll make it again. I was intrigued enough by the mix of pears and anise to try it...but I felt the anise was overpowering. I liked the pears, though, and may add pears and apricots and maybe dired apples? to my next regualr soda loaf.
