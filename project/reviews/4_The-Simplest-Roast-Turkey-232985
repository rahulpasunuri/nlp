Fast, easy, perfect! Better than other recipes I've tried that were much more work and took longer. I followed the other reviewers suggestions and added a cup of water to the roasting pan and had no problems with smoking.

The name says it all, it is simply the best. I made this recipe again today with huge success. I did, however, brine my turkey overnight and then once he started to get golden brown covered him with aluminum foil. Simple and perfect - can't ask for more.

I had a 12½ pound turkey -- which is way more than you need for 6 people. Cooked it for about 2 hours and it worked out beautifully! I did add a cup of water to pan per other reviewers' suggestios and that made the gravy so easy to make. The recipe doesn't say whether it should be cooked uncovered or not but I cooked it covered except for about 15 minutes near the end so that it was brown on top. Will definitely use this method again if and when I ever cook another turkey.

This is the best recipe I have tried, and like others, I added water to the bottom of the pan. Because cooking time is short, the day is relaxed!

Best turkey that ever came out of my oven! Took longer to thaw bird than to roast. Easy and just delicious. Looks like the turkeys that are used in photo shoots. Will be using this method again for sure.

I tried this recipe on my first turkey and it was excellent! My 15lb turkey cooked beautifully...although I accidently left it in the oven too long at 3 hours and the thermometer read overcooked. Still, it was so juicy, so easy, so delicious. Can't wait to use this recipe again.

I tried this recipe for the first time and was very pleased with the results. I took others recommendations and added a cup of water to the bottom of the roasting pan to prevent smoking. I also rubbed the bird with butter, salt, pepper and dried thyme. My 13.5 lb bird was cooked perfectly in 2 hrs 15 minutes.

I have spent far more time and effort in the past with results no better than this simple method. I have used this 3 times this year with great results each time. My 20 lb turkey was done in just under 3 hours.

Got to agree that this is such a great turkey with such little effort. Since I don't have don't have a self cleaning oven, I used my Weber Gas grill. The turkey was the juiciest bird and it looked like the Turkey from the Rockwell painting. Since the turkey was still a bit slushy, I didn't stuff it. I cook my chicken using the same method and it's always a hit.

Amazing! What a beautiful turkey! 15.75lb bird in a little under 1.75 hours, and beautiful brown. The drippings made a wonderful gravy with madeira and crushed chicken livers. I will NEVER go back to the hovering basting hours-long process.

second year using this method, I love the quick cook time and no fuss prep.I don't have to tent with foil, and birds are evenly and nicly browned.

I can't think of a better way to make a turkey. This is so simple and the results are amazing. The turkey was very moist, and I appreciated the brief cooking time. My house also got a little smokey, but it wasn't too bad.

This was unbelievably delicious. My family likes only one turkey a year, but after they had this at Thanksgiving, they want to forego the Christmas ham for another turkey. My 69-year-old Dad said it was the best turkey he's every had--we all agree! I added 1 cup of water in the pan to start, and added about 1 cup more 45 minutes into cooking. I cooked a 14 pound turkey in an hour and a half!

Great quick recipe, but don't stuff the bird even though it gives directions how to. At the right temp, the stuffing was still stained with lots of red juices. I put it back in for a bit and still cooked the stuffing solo too.

I first cooked my turkey (and turkey breast) this way in 2005, and it was great. This year (2006) I decided to brine the turkey in a salt/brown sugar solution, and the results were even better! No one believes it is this simple. Just make sure you keep enough liquid in the roasting pan to keep smoking down to a minimum.

This is the easiest turkey roasting method I've ever seen and the results are incredible. I rubbed the skin with a little olive oil before salting, stuck an electric thermometer in the breast and that was it. The drippings splattered everywhere and smoked up the kitchen, but it was totally worth it. Juicy white and dark meat, 2 hours total cooking time. What more can anyone ask for?

Easiest turkey I've ever made, and delicious too! I brine my poultry, so 2 to 2 1/2 teaspoons of salt is too much to use. The pan drippings were so salty that I nearly had a disaster with my gravy.

Everyone scoffed when I told them that I was going to cook a 14 pound turkey in 2 1/2 hours. BUT WHO'S LAUGHING NOW!?!? This came out just great, I kept adding water to the pan to absorb the splatter and give some liquid for basting. Slow cooking is old and busted. This recipie is the new hotness.

I tested this out first on a large roasting chicken. After success, I now use the high heat method combined with an overnite herb brine. Since I use a convection oven, I turned down the heat to 400 degress. Keeping a water bath in the pan catches the drippings,containing most of the smoke, however the bird still pops and spatters so turn on an exhaust fan.

My turkey was just under 14lb. and took 2 hr. to cook. I put 1 c. water in my high sided roasting pan and had no smoking at all. Each time I turned the pan I tipped it to drain the liquid out of the cavity. Golden brown bird, moist throughout. Second only to deep fried (you can't beat 45 minute cook time).

This is one of the BEST Roast Turkey's I have EVER had. It was my first attempt at a turkey, and this is definately a recipe I recommend for the first timer!!!

My problem with this recipe was the smoking. Even with a freshly cleaned oven the smoke started within the first 25 minutes. The problem was the grease from the turkey skin dripped into the roasting pan and spattered onto the sides of the oven. I had to have my exhaust fan running at all times. I wonder if some water in the bottom of the roasting pan might have helped?

This recipe could not have been simpler or more successful! My family raved about it. My 15lb.+ turkey cooked perfectly in 1 3/4 hours. No smoke at all - I took your advice & started with a clean oven. I always thought of making a turkey as a major undertaking. However, this recipe is foolproof - so simple, so fast and so delicious, that it has earned the title of an "instant favourite" at our house. Thank you!

Awesome. I usually don't like the white meat on the turkey because it gets dried out by the time the dark meat is cooked. Not so with this recipe. This was the best turkey I have ever had. I did a 10 1/2 pounder in 1 hour 45 minutes with very little smoking. I neglected to tuck under the wing tips, so the very ends were a touch burnt. The rest of the turkey was perfect.

I was skeptical, but with an 80 degree Fl. Christmas I decided to go for less oven time. A 14 # stuffed turkey took 2 1/2 hrs. and was delicious.....perfectly browned and all meat was moist and delicious. No smoke either using lower third of oven as directed.

Easy and GREAT! I'm glad I didn't read the reviews here before roasting my Thanksgiving bird according to the recipe in the magazine- I might have been daunted by the comments regarding smoke! As it was, I cooked a 15 pounder, in about 1 hour 50 minutes, with no smoke that anyone noticed. Guests absolutely swooned over it, proclaiming it the best turkey they'd ever had! OK, the fact that it was a Bourbon Red Heritage turkey may have had something to do with it, but this recipe certainly showed off that bird to its best advantage.

I wish they explained why this method is not recommended for birds larger than 14 pounds. I decided against this method because I had an 18 pound bird. Instead, I brined it and used Alton Brown's method (from this site) which is to start at 500 and then reduce to 350 once the breast browned. I have to say, that produced an AMAZING turkey and not so much smoke because the oven temp came down before the splatters really burned much.

I read the hype. I bought the hype. I lived the hype. It is no hype. It works (and it smokes)!

Fantastic! The house filled with smoke...we opened the doors, turned on fans and put on sweaters. My 23-pounder was done in just over 2 hours. He was gorgeous, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. All guests agreed that this is the best way to roast a turkey! I thought that the charred goo in the bottom of the pan would taste burnt and be unsuitable for gravy...but I deglazed and tasted; it was great. The gravy had a rich flavor and dark color. What a hit!

I've been roasting turkeys for many, many years and not only was this the juciest bird ever, it was unbelievably easy and quick! Wow! Thanks for all your research. I'll use this method from now on.

Well I chickened or should I say turkeyed out at the very last moment mainly due to the treat of smoke with a house full of people. However I will try this another time! And since I was planning on this recipe I didn't brine the bird and there was a notable difference in the texture.

I will never bother to cook turkey any other way. I spent about five minutes prep time before I put the turkey in the oven to roast, and another two minutes rotating the pan. Two hours later, I had a beautifully browned and juicy bird, as promised. I did get worried when the bird really browned in the first hour, but I left it alone as directed. It's hard to believe, but it really worked. It may be the best Thanksgiving turkey I've had.

My husband moaned and complained that it might not turn out right and we should use the usual recipe. Then when it came out of the oven beautifully golden and moist, he took full credit for the experiment. The extra two hours of oven time was perfect. This was just as good as the brined turkey basted for hours from last year.

Really tasty and fast but it's a good thing I live in a warm climate because the smoke caused us to open all the windows and turn on the whole house fan. The smoke still seems to be lingering.

This lived up to its promise. I used a large turkey breast and followed the recipe exactly, using a meat thermometer. Very easy, crisp on the outside, moist and delicious inside. This will be my Thanksgiving bird from now on. I will change the gravy--really a lot of trouble, confusing directions. I'll replace it with an adjusted version of the parsley pan gravy that goes with the roast chicken breasts on this website--its delicious, very easy and rather healthy as gravy goes.

I was amazed that an 11 pound fresh, amish natural turkey (unstuffed)cooked in one and half hours and was truly delicious! While both white and dark meat were very juicy, I had a lot of smoke in the kitchen from the rendering fat and juices. I followed the directions and started with a clean oven, but I ended up having to cover the bird and pan with foil after 45 minutes to contain the splatter from smoking. This was the only drawback I found, but enough to lose a fork :-( For me, the aroma of a roast bird in the house is part of the holiday experience. This recipe however, would be great for game day!!

Hard to believe that simpler is better! I'm not usually a big fan of turkey, but this was very moist and tender. I cooked a 14lb. turkey in just over an hour....so much for hanging out all day waiting for the turkey to cook! This recipe yielded the best turkey I've had - I'll use this recipe on Thanksgiving!

I made this turkey tonight, it was the first time I had ever cooked a turkey and it turned out very good. The white meat was moist and delicious.
