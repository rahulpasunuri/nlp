I liked this. I served it with salmon and we both agreed it made a good accompaniment. I wish I'd read the reviews before making it because I think the recommendation to saute the scallions would have been a good one--I'm still tasting them today!

Delicious and very easy. I made this per instructions except used only 3/4 tsp salt instead of 1 tsp. Very good rice dish and wish I'd actually doubled the recipe as we both wanted more.

This is a very easy and good side dish. I sauteed the scallions instead of adding them raw per the previous review, and it turned out quite nicely.

As is this recipe is pretty good. It was a nice side dish for my pork loin with peach mustard sauce. I find though when using mustard seeds the flavor of your dish will go from good to Zowie just by toasting the mustard seeds until they pop a little. They next time I make this I will add more mustard seeds and toast them.

I thought this was okay for a side dish, but I did not receive rave reviews. Maybe it was because I didn't have any jasmine rice, so I substituted basmati rice. In any case, I wish mine had tasted as good as the other reviewers!

Terrific. Didn't think a simple receipe like this could be so flavorful. I even left out the scallions.

I doubled the recipe, added 1/2c shredded zucchini and handful of chopped cilantro leaves. This accompanied by haddock dish well. Delicious.

Definitely saute scallions with the shallot. My guests gobbled it up.

Very delicious. I agree with the earlier reviewer, saute the scallions with the mustard seeds. My wife really liked it, after a lot of hesitation because she thought it sounded "weird". We served this with baked salmon ala Simbajak. We slather dijon mustard on the salmon, then cover with a heaping of brown sugar, bake or broil. Now we have "Mustard Night" at our household.

Delicious! Even my two-year-old ate this. The second time I made it, I sauteed the chopped scallions in the hot oil after adding the mustard seeds and everybody who tried it agreed that this was even better than mixing them in raw at the end, as the recipe calls for.
