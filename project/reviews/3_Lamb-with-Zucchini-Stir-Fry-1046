I will make this again with beef or chicken or even ground turkey. I tweaked the recipe a bit by adding basil to the sauce as it was cooking down. I also added snow peas. It was a hit and my partner isnt a lamb fan. He loved it!

I have been making this dish since 1995 when it appeared. First, I think this is a very tasty meal, but I will concede the criticisms. It is not at all appealing visually, looks like a grey mash. It does involve a significant mise en place. It is very fatty if you go by the recipe. I have easily reduced the fat both by draining the meat, and by reducing the amount of oil used without regret. It will however always look the same. I think the lamb is excellent and love the integrity of the spices. In short tastes great-looks bad.

I liked all the ingredients but something was missing with this recipe. I don't think that I will make it again. It was very fatty using ground lamb and the recipe did not tell you to drain the fat. I would reccomend draining the fat.

I used this recipe as a base to create my own rendition. First with both oils I stir-fried the onions and zucchini with the minced ginger and garlic until crisp-tender. Remove from wok. Then I substituted sliced chinese roast pork, aka. "char siu" for the lamb and just stir fried until warmed through. I then returned the veggies to the wok, splashed in the soy sauce and garlic chili sauce, and green onions. Next came the chicken broth thickened with a cornstarch slurry. Served with steamed white jasmine rice.

I agree with the cook from Athens, GA and think that this dish leaves quite a bit to be desired visually. And, while my husband liked it, I didn't quite fall in love with the unique combination of ingredients and flavorings. It just didn't grab me.

I wasn't quite sure of this recipe after reading the other readers' comments, so I was surprised when I sat down to eat this dish. Although lamb with distictively Asian ingredients sounds odd, the flavors in this dish come together quite nicely. Like another reader, I served this over couscous, which was delicious. It tastes much better than the aromas during preparation, too. Overall, a very tasty dish.

I used strips of lamb instead and found that it made an easy, lean and very tasty substitute. I also served it with couscous instead of rice which gave it a more Morrocan feel (even though some of the spices are so obviouly Asian) as I find lamb and couscous go so well together. My guests loved it!

I won't be making this again. I'm not sure if I did something wrong but it was rather sloppy - didn't look at all appetising. The flavor was quite good but not good enough to make up for the revolting appearance.

Ground lamb tends to be very fat. Since we are watching our fat and cholesteros intake, I first browned the lamb in a non stick skillet, drained off the fat, and rinsed the meat with hot water. Then I proceeded with the recipe using half the recommended amount of oil in a non stick wok. It worked just fine. We're drowning in zucchini right now, and this is a very good good dish; easy to prepare and tasty.

Although it was a lot of trouble to put together it was very good. The prep time was long about 40 minutes and I had to drain the fat twice (not an easy job in a wok) but for all that the dish was very good and very spicey. Next time I will try one teaspoon of garlic chili sauce.
