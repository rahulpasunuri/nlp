Great recipe. Read the reviews and upped the fennel seed - also roasted and ground it to intensify flavor. The orange garnish sounds odd but really looks gorgeous and definitely adds brightness. I also used smaller strips of orange which worked well. Served as an appetizer to some foodie friends who thought it was the best mussel recipe they'd had. Definitely a hit.

Really good. I skipped the orange pulp and just used zest, plus a squeeze of orange juice with the wine. We added another half-pound of mussels and had it for dinner for two, with bread and the rest of the wine of course. Easy, fast, healthy and tasty.

This was unique and we enjoyed it but I'd have to say it was blander than I expected. I halved the butter, doubled the fennel seeds, added extra orange (tangerine actually) reduced more wine and added extra shallots. It was good and I'd make it again because it's low fat, and quick, but we love big flavours and hoped this would have more presence.

This dish is fabulous. Every time I try to make another mussel recipe, I get shouts of protest. For the amount of broth that this recipe makes, you can certainly double the amount of mussels. Make sure that you plenty of crusty bread on hand!!

This is a lovely combination of flavors, but my husband, who made this dish, would do two things differently next time: 1) we thought all the orange overwhelmed the mussel taste. Next time he will add orange zest only. 2) He used two pounds mussels, not one, and the proportion of mussels to cooked vegs and broth was exactly right. Maybe one pound would have made for a vegetable broth topped with some mussels. In any case, this recipe is worth some tinkering.

THIS IS A FANTASTIC RECIPE. THE COMBINATION OF FENNEL AND ORANGE IS TOTALLY EXOTIC, EXCITINGLY DIFFERENT FROM THE RUN-OF-THE-MILL MUSSEL BROTH. WITHOUT A DOUBT A FOUR FORK DELICACY.
