Very good and very easy. My boyfriend who isn't normally a fan of couscous really enjoyed it. I did make two changes. I browned the butter which I would highly recommend and I took another reviewer's suggestion and added lemon juice.

I always forget how easily and quickly couscous cooks up. I've never added butter to couscous and so added half as much as was called for. I did add in some olive oil to reach the desired moistness. I loved the balance between the sweet and nutty and oniony. Served this with the Curried Cauliflower and Chickpea Stew- a recipe from this site- and it was super good!

Delicious and very easy. Used toasted almonds instead of pine nuts, and it worked well. Flavorful without being overpowering. A side dish most in our party overlooked (myself included) until they tried it - and then everyone went back for seconds. Will definitely make again.

Very good. Mild-tasting. Great for weekday dinner -- quick & easy.

Love this recipe with or without the butter, but I think using isreali couscous is better - it is plumper and therefore will not taste/look like grits.

YUM! What a great side dish! I added the juice of a lemon to brighten the flavor and a touch a olive oil too. Added shredded chicken the next day for a simple supper.

3 1/2 forks. This is very quick and tasty. A stick of butter is not necessary - I just toasted the cous cous in 4T of olive oil first and then added the broth and raisins.

This was easy for a novice cook like me. I made it with the "Spinach with Pine Nuts and Raisins..." just to use up similar ingredients: They actually tasted great together! I was going to use vegetable broth but glad I went with the low-sodium chicken. That and the recommended amount of salt is plenty. I used microwaved frozen spinach, used olive oil and added mint at the end. I think I will try this with rice the next time.

Made as a side dish for Christmas dinner. Easy and delicious.

This got raves alongside what I thought was a so-so Tajine. Substituted Olive oil for the butter; mixed dried cranberries with the raisins to make up the specified amount; added a cup or so of chopped fresh corriander

Was bland at first. I added some salt, about 1/4 tsp of sugar, olive oil instead of butter and then the secret ingedient: MINT

Excellent. Everyone loved it.

This dish was quite bland. I used a combination of golden raisins and dried cranberries, and regular chicken broth (not low salt). It tasted like grits, and I panicked (one hour before a holiday dinner), so I added a can of drained mandarin oranges. That helped, but I found myself wanting to add something spicy. After it settled for an hour or so, it was better (the onion needed to permeate). I would consider this a starting point; next time I will definitely add a hefty amount of a fresh herb, use chopped pistachios instead of pine nuts (for color and taste) and maybe add diced granny smith apples or some other tart ingredient.

This is a favourite staple in our house now. The recipe makes a ton, but we never half it, instead just happily eat it over several days.

Maybe the person from Kobe can share their recipes...I am curious as to their taste because this recipe is quite good. The mixture of raisins and nuts is a great combination and the butter makes it rich. Try it, I think you will like it. I have made it many times and my family and friends love it.

I wasn't impressed. It came out tasting pretty bland. Maybe I did something wrong...

A tasty side dish that's easy to make.

I use this recipe as a general guide and modify according to what's on hand and it is always great. I like to use a combination of "golden raisins and cherries" and I use whatever nuts I have available (pecans, walnuts, etc.) It also benefits from cilantro...tons of cilantro. And no butter...only olive oil, please!

Delightful! You really don't need the butter, but it is tasty!

Perfect combonation of flavors, sweet from the raisins with a salty from the chicken broth. Also, not necessary to add the butter. I have made it without butter to cut down, and get great results. This is my favorite couscous recipe.

This was addictive. The raisins really add a lot to the recipe and I would definitely stick with the pine nuts. Everyone wanted seconds of this dish.

Nice combination for the couscous - agree that it calls for too much butter.

Rating: 3
this is a tasty and flavorful side that i suspect would work well with both fish and white meat (prepared fairly simply--parseley and lemon come to mind). i halved the butter and yet a rich buttery presence pleasantly remained. i found myself low on pine nuts; toasted walnut pieces worked well in their place. i am mostly self-taught in the kitchen and while this usually serves me well, occasionally i stumble upon an issue without resources upon which to draw. my question: while some recipes specifically call for the green or white part of the scallion, when it is not specified (such as in this recipe), which part is assumed? if anyone with a bit of culinary training could help me out on this, i'd be grateful.

Super easy. This recipe makes a ton of couscous. Can easily be halved to make 4 reasonable side servings. Or stick with the original recipe to make enough for 4+ hungry people. The only reason I wouldn't make this a '4 forks' is because it is pretty basic. (But it is tasty)

Truly wonderful! Cannot think of a thing to add

Easy, do-ahead recipe (have everything chopped so all you have to do is boil the broth, add the couscous and throw the rest of the ingredients in right before serving). I served it to company twice, both times with kids involved, and made "castles" out of the couscous with a metal 1/3 cup measuring cup (scooped the couscous into the cup, pressed it in gently, and turned the cup upside-down onto the plates next to the entree). Made a great presentation!

This was incredibly easy to make; I had never tried cooking couscous before, and I'd gladly serve this again.

Great alternative to rice or pasta. Also reduced the butter.

Also works useing dry apracot and I have thought about dry cherrys. I use Olive oil in place of butter

I needed a fast side dish with everyday ingredients for an impromptu dinner party. I didn't have terribly high expectations for this, but it turned out to be delicious! My guests and I loved it, and it'll be something that appears regularly on the dinner table from now on.

Thought this was great. Reduced the butter by half. Nice subsititute for rice.

This is a classic flavor combination; I have made several similar couscous dishes and they always work well. When I saw that it called for a stick of butter, I decided that would be entirely too much, but then later, while talking I absent-mindedly added it all. It was tasty, but didn't need the full amount of butter at all. I would think 3 tablespoons or so would be sufficient.
