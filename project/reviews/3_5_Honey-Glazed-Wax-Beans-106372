Made with both wax and green beans. I upped the zest and added a little cayenne, and the beans were delicious. In the future, I think I'd decrease the honey a bit.

I too wanted a novel way to use yellow wax beans. Bean salad and steamed beans are great but it's good to have a recipe where the yellow beans are a solo dish. The lemon and honey are delicous companions- perfect with the beans. Thank you!

This is a nice change from the usual steamed wax beans. I was looking for something different, and boy is this it! My husband looked up and said: "Nice beans!" I was intriqued by the combination of honey and lemon on the beans, and it works!

When you see wax beans in the store and wonder what else to do with them besides make 3 bean salad, THIS IS WHAT YOU DO WITH THEM! Easy and has alot of flavor. A Super YUM!

Easy and lots of flavor. We made this to go with a meal of Dijon Chicken Breasts with Lemon-Pistachio Pilaf and the honey flavor was a very nice accompaniment to all that tangy lemon and mustard.
