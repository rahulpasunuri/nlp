This is now my "go-to" alfredo recipe. It's so easy, and VERY tasty. It works with just about any pasta type - I've made it with rotini (favorite 'cause it catches the sauce well), elbows, and linguini. I use extra cream & cheese 'cause I like my pasta saucy. Also, after the first few times I stopped chopping the proscuitto before cooking it - I just fry up the slices & crumble them into the pan just before serving. I agree that the Kraft parmesan results in an inferior texture - but the pre-shredded Sargento parmesan is a good enough quality to make the effort worth while. I had not thought of adding mozzarella and garlic, but will certainly try those adaptations next! One other recommendation - I love making a heap of this as it reheats really well, but if stored in one bowl it can be challenging to spoon out (one glass bowl has already lost its life to this!) - I recommend portioning out into the amounts you'll want while it's warm, and THEN refrigerate.

This was really good. I made it last night for my son's birthday and everyone enjoyed it. I was having eight people for dinner so I quadrupled the recipe. Because I made so much I had a hard time getting the cheese to melt into the sauce so there were some clumps, but no one seemed to mind. The only thing I will change next time I make it is to make the sauce separate and then add the pasta to it. I probably would add a little lemon and garlic to it as well.

I had proscuitto but no heavy cream and a huge case of jet lag. What I did have was goat cheese and non-fat milk. I also had basil in lieu of parsley. Like other reviewers I minced some garlic and added that to the olive oil prior to the proscuitto. Also rather than sprinkling the proscuitto on top of the pasta I stirred it into it. I would make this again and I would try it with cream instead of goat cheese as well.

This recipe is quick and easy but needs a little something-maybe some cayenne pepper and garlic.

I jazzed it up with some garlic & grilled chicken thighs. My husband and I enjoyed it, but the kids just kinda picked at it. I agree, it's a great midweek quick and easy recipe.

This is a very nice, savory, and easy recipe. I've made it several times, and it's slowly evolving. I'm now substituting spicy-hot coppa for the prosciutto, and farfalle for the gemelli, which together make the recipe a little lighter in the mouth and a bit more complex.

Wow, this was really really good! We added peas and used fettucine, but didn't change anything else. My boyfriend and I both cleaned our plates and his toddler (a picky eater) did a fair amount of damage as well. Will definitely make again, although only once in a while because it was so incredibly rich and right now I feel like a lead weight :)

The best things are always simple. I whip up this easy and delicious recipe once a week. It couldn't be easier to remember and grab groceries for!

My fork rating includes slight modifications. I made this by the book except used bacon seasoned with garlic salt instead of proscuitto and used cheap parmesan-in-a-can. I made the sauce in the pan with the bacon drippings, cutting down on the butter, before adding to pasta. I also added about a clove of pureed garlic. The flavor and thickness of the sauce was excellent, and the bacon worked really well. There was a slight graininess to my sauce which I would guess is due to the cheap parmesan... so use the real stuff! It was still very good and I will be trying again with good cheese :-)

This recipe is PERFECTION. I wouldn't change a thing. Every time I make the dish it receives rave reviews.

The recipe is very good as written, but I made a few additions. First, I boiled fresh green peas in salted water and then used that water to cook the pasta. I also added garlic powder and creole seasoning to the sauce and grilled chicken to the final product. Excellent with some fresh ground pepper to top!

This was great! I changed it up a little, I used fettucine and I made the sauce in the pan I cooked the prosciutto in. I also added some whole milk and a little less cream and I cooked up some garlic after the proscuitto. I also used some mozzarella cheese and it was AWESOME!! Oh, I also used more prosciutto then it said.

This is very delicious. We had it at a holiday party, and it was a big hit!

Well, because I substituted several ingredients and added a few others, this technically isn't a review. But you may find valuable reading what worked for me. First I doubled the amount of sauce and cheese, subbed half-n-half for cream and basil for parsley. Lots of basil. Added chopped, grilled chicken breast and chopped asparagus for a one-dish meal. Kept pasta and proscuitto amounts the same. Husband went back for seconds. A rarity. Oh and a 1/2 pound of pasta makes far more than 2 servings. I'd say this recipe, as is, could easily feed 4.

I, too, served this with grilled chicken. Loved by all from the toddler to the teenager.

Great pasta, I sauteed the proscuitto with garlic, added toasted pine nuts like another user suggested. Next time I think I will add roasted red peppers too. Yum!

This was a great, easy weeknite dinner with some grilled chicken added. Next time will make more sauce, since the chicken makes it use more. YUMMY!

This was pretty good for a quick weeknight dish...It's a bit bland, so you definitely need the proscuitto and some garlic.

I made this recipe for a friend's birthday dinner, I added some chicken & roasted red pepper. My friends were beyond enthusiastic & have all been requesting it ever since.It's fairly easy also so it's a good week night dinner party option.

Having some Proscuitto remaining from previous night dinner party, I searched Epicurious for a receipe. This was easy, very tasty and I had all the ingredients on hand. I used half and half rather than cream and it was still rich and satisfying. I added some sun-dried tomatoes (in oil) and some toasted pinenuts. It's a keeper and next time I am going to cut the half and half with whole milk.

even though i made this dish with fat-free half and half, we thought it was great! i did saute some mushrooms in the oil with a little basil before cooking the proscuitto because we had them on hand, but i'm sure the recipe was a very tasty and simple winner no matter what! served a salad of several greens and some crumbled feta, drizzled with basil and balsamic vineagrette, and we had a terrific dinner.

This is a very tasty, easy weekday pasta dish. The sauteed proscuitto adds a nice flavor. A little rich, but tasty!
