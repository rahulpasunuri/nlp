This is probably the lowest effort desert with the highest payoff I I've ever made -- really delicious.

This was an amazingly simple dish that brought rave reviews from everyone. I used my homemade apricot rosemary jam and the slight herbiness brought a lovely and unexpected complexity. Here's the jam recipe: http://www.foodinjars.com/2011/07/urban- preserving-apricot-rosemary-jam/

This was quick and easy. The whole family loved it. When I don't have time to bake an apple pie this is what I whip up.

This was great for a non-baker like me. Made it the first time w/ 2 apples & 1 plum, topped w/ homemade strawberry jelly and it was such a big hit that now I'm taking it to a friend's for Thanksgiving. Followed the tips about adding a squeeze of lemon and some extra cinnamon sugar before the apples. Love the idea of adding raisins and/or sliced almonds.

Made this with pears and it was lovely with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Also great with morning coffee the next day.

Absolutely delicious! Quickly has become one of my favourite deserts, and it's so easy. I used a bit larger portions, as I was making this for a few people. So lovely!

Amazing, easy but looks like you spent hours. Delicious!

I really enjoy this recipe. I do make a few changes, such as I add 1/3 stick of butter and 4 tablespoons of sugar. I sprinkle the top with a bit of extra cinnamon because I love cinnamon, and I have gotten so many rave reviews and requests for me to make it. I have 4 sitting on my bakers rack right now, and I have had to run my husband out of the kitchen to keep him from cutting into them.

Love this recipe. So easy and perfect for a non-baker like myself who wanted to do something a little special for dessert.

Super simple that you don't even really need a recipe. Also happens to be pretty delicious. A go-to favorite of mine for weeknight meals with a special someone.

this was an excellent recipe -- and sooo simple!! Friends came over for a casual dinner... this was an extremely simple dessert to make and we all loved it!!! I would definitely make it again. I used "Du Four" frozen puff pastry -- all butter, absolutely delicious!!

used homemade crust...it was fresh and good but not worth the effort...apple pie and apple crisp are better apple recipes(in my opinion)

This has become my favorite quick and impressive dessert. I like using mango jam (Goya brand) instead of apricot. Key to the beauty of this tart is very thin slices of apple artistically laid out in rows. Makes even a beginner seem like a pasty chef!

this recipe was so easy to make and very tasty. i used half the sugar and used one golden delicious apple (sweet tasting) and 2 tart tasting apples to increase depth of taste. i'd say though that three apples is too much, two would be enough.

I used a ready-made Pillsbury pie crust instead of the puff pastry because I had it on hand and needed a quick dessert. I rolled out the pie crust and put everything in the center, leaving about 1 inch around the edges, then folded the edges up and over the apples. It was more of a rustic-looking tart, but very pretty and certainly delicious warm out of the oven. Fast and easy, I'll make it again.

This is truly a quick way to make an apple tart that looks and tastes as though it took more effort to produce.

Very simple and fast. Thought the puff pastry was a little tough, perhaps because I prepared it and then let it sit about an hour before baking. The flavor was good and I served it with vanilla ice cream on top. Definitely a keeper.

Super easy and very yummy too. A keeper. I served about 1 hour after I cooked it. Next time, I'd wait to cook and would serve it warm out of the oven.

Add some raisins. Absolutely fabulous!

Excellent apple tart. Very simple and quick to prepare -- but LOOKS like you went to lots of trouble. First time I made this I followed the instructions to cook it on waxed paper. But the tart stuck to the paper. So the second time, I cooked it on aluminum foil which I had sprayed with non-stick cooking spray. That did the trick -- crust was still crispy and flaky and it didn't stick to the foil.

I made this recipe for a family brunch and have been asked to make it several times since. It's wonderful!

Fabulous! So easy and nearly effortless, and it looks like something I would have found at the French place in the neighborhood for $15! Next time, I might try reducing the sugar by about 1/3, since the apricot glaze (I used sugar-free) is pretty sweet on it's own, and I am always trying to reduce sugar and calories... As-is, though, the recipe is really, really great.

Made this to finish Easter dinner & it got rave reviews with multiple requests for the recipe - if they only knew how easy it was! I had extra apples so I cut one more and did a double layer of apples. Otherwise, I made it exactly as written. Served with vanilla ice cream - delicious!

This is nice. My apples were huge and I ended up slicing each quarter, fanning the slices, and placing them in quadrants on the puff pastry. Just a suggestion: substitute thinly sliced apples in the Apricot Galette recipe on this website. I use all kinds of fruit with that basic recipe and it's one of the best desserts I make.

I agree with everyone, this is a delicious, fast and even fancy tart. I love being able to just buy the puff pastry and then make something that tastes homemade. Terrific recipe.

This was deliecious. I did not have apricot jam so I used guava and I added chopped toasted peacans on top. It was a very pretty presentation. I just wish I had a square dish on which to place it. It would have been even more yummy warm with some ice cream or whipped cream on top. I think pears with gorgonzola and nuts on top would be incredible.

This was SO easy, looks great, and tasted wonderful. I love to cook, but am not much of a baker, so this was right up my alley. I'm going to make it again for Thanksgiving....

The puff pastry makes this so easy, I've used different fruits-- pears or plums and added different spices and nuts-it always turns out great!

Wonderful. Very close to what I used eat in France. A keeper!!

This is a great, quick, easy recipe. I brushed the apple slices with lemon before brushing with butter to enhance the apple flavor. I also used mango fruit spread instead of apricot - rave reviews from everyone.

Gorgeous and delicious! I used 1 granny and 2 braeburn and dripped lemon on all the slices prior to placing on the pastry. I also scattered cinn-sugar over the pastry before topping with apples. Make sure your apples aren't too wet when you place them. Very tasty and lovely and due for a repeat performance in the future. I topped mine with small dollops of homemade creole cream cheese and praline icecream. To die for.

I omitted cinnamon and instead added some lemon juice and sprinkled with sliced almonds. SO good!!

This was so easy and looks very impressive! The only things I would change are maybe not using as much fruit and watching the glaze carefully. I only used 2 medium sized apples and it seemed just right. Melt the apricot preserves just prior to brushing on the tart. Otherwise the preserves go back to being thick, sticky and hard to brush. Great dessert to serve with vanilla ice cream too.
