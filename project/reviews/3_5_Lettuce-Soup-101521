Very simple to make and surprisingly elegant.

This soup is SO delicious!! Since I wanted just a little bit more, but didn't want to double the recipe, I added two extra cups of water and two extra bouillon cubes (I substituted the cubes for the broth) and after pureeing added enough corn starch to make it creamy. I will definitely be making this again soon!

this recipe is great and you can add shrimp to it to make it even better
