This review is for basically the same recipe from Bon Appetit, May, 2010. We had trouble w the Creme Fraiche as it didn't thicken properly, but we mixed it w sour cream to what we thought was the proper consistency, so it didn't run. It was very well received by the dining group, and eaten up. The recipe called for black pepper chips and lemon creme fraiche. The second time we tried it, the chips got a little soggy towards the end, but that really didn't stop anybody. Would suggest putting the salmon and rest on the chips just prior to serving. Will make again; it was good.

Quick, easy and tasty. I agree that a good quality 'kettle' chip should be used.

OK, here's how you can make this work for an elegant cocktail party treat: First, use high quality chips. If you don't care to make your own (which isn't hard by the way), then use "kettle" style chips - either black pepper and sea salt, or rosemary work particularly well. Select only the best appearing chips from the bag to use for this recipe. Blend about 1/2 tsp freshly grated lemon peel into the container of creme fraiche. Decorate with freshly snipped chives. You can also make this same recipe using smoked mackerel. Try topping those with creme fraiche AND inexpensive fish roe (salmon is nice because of the color). I guarantee your guests will be wowed and they will all be gone early into the party!

Ok, it was good. I guess this is one of those recipes some people think they are to refined for. And still at (casual) parties this would be the first thing to vanish... The flavors work well together and I like the contrast of the crunchy chip and the smooth salmon. Liked it and would make it again. Have to admit that this is not for everybody, thank goodness the title alerts you to what this is. Don't try it if you don't think that chips and smoked salmon fit together - it is that easy...

You're kidding, right? Did I stumble on to Rachel Ray's site by mistake?

I happen to think that this sounds great! It sounds very much like something done in Germany, where they serve smoked salmon on potato latkes. I know - greasy - but so good. And it's christmas! We are going to try this during the holidays - I will let you know how we liked it.

This is not a recipe. Whatever it is, it's not even particularly good or inspired. Salmon on potato chips? Nice.

If you get the organic chips, like spinach, sweet potato etc. and put the smoked salmon slices on with a little cheese, it's really kinda tasty, and quick for the kids to help make!!
