What wonderful flavor combinations. I added sliced mushrooms and, based upon other reviews, used equal amounts of broth and heavy cream. Sauce consistency was perfect!

Only reviewing the sauteed onion and fennel part. Absolutely incredible! I've made it many times.

LOVELY! Would make a wonderful entree for an elegant dinner. The recipe is said to feed 4 but, with sides and at least 3-4 other courses you could possibly feed 8 (we are BIG eaters). The only thing I didn't do was cut the tenderloin in half, cooking it for only a couple minutes longer. Otherwise, the recipe was made as printed. Perfect and Excellent!

Yummy. Slightly reduced quantity of chicken broth and subbed 10% cream. Sauce was more than thick enough and tenderloin was very moist. Perfect cold winter meal with roasted squash and broccoli. Will definitely make again.

I found the flavors of this recipe sort of flat. I added cumin to the sauce, which was quite watery, to brighten the flavor and added tomatoes to the fennel/onion mixture. It was edible but I wouldn't go out of my way to make it again.

I started out with a pork tenderloin in mind, however, my house-guest who had been away for a day exploring turned up after I had already started on the fennel mixture with a fresh whole trout he had caught. So I baked that and served it with the rest of this recipe, saving the pork for another recipe the next night. I spent well over an hour trying to caramalise the onion and fennel, but it still didn't quite become soft enough like when you caramalise onion alone. I agree with the reviewer who mentioned the bland presentation - a very washed out looking plate of food. However, the flavours were lovely, and I found the plate of food very comforting. I served it with some sliced potatoes that I boiled very quickly with some milk and a splash of white wine, then roasted/browned in the oven (quick potato gratin). An interesting meal.

Ok I read all of your reviews but I couldn't find a pork tenderloin in Chicago over Christmas so we used a pork loin roast. I also eliminated the fennel seed but added the fennel leaves which added a sublte flavor. The loin took an hour which allowed me to roast potatoes, carrotes with the roast and allowed me more time to prepare the meal. I just liked the pace not to rushed. I have made it another time and our family loves it.

Very tasty, though I would probably use less chicken broth next time as I found the sauce to be quite watery even after reducing for about 10 min. I followed the recipe as written apart from using onions in place of the shallots, and I didn't cut the pork fillet in half since we like ours quite rosy. I ended up cooking the pork for about 10 min in the oven after browning it and it was pink and juicy. Would def make this again,

I have made this recipe many times and have always had rave reviews. I find it easy to make, and enjoy its flavors.

This recipe is delicious and easy. I made it as written, just made a couple of technique changes. I cooked the fennel & onion in a non- stick skillet on low heat to caramelize. Meanwhile I browned the pork in an ovenproof Calphalon skillet and put that directly in the oven to roast. I transferred the fennel mixture to a glass bowl, then sauteed the shallots & garlic for the sauce in the non-stick skillet. I omitted the extra fennel seeds from the sauce so the anise flavor would not be overpowering (did put them in the fennel mixture, though). As soon as the pork tested done I wrapped it in foil to sit and deglazed the Calphalon pan with the wine, then stock, and transferred the rest of the sauce ingredients to the Calphalon. After nuking the fennel for a few seconds I was ready to plate. The entire recipe took about 45 minutes to make. I thought the sauce was the best part and plan to make more of that next time.

Made this last night for a dinner party, and everyone loved it. For 6 people I doubled the pan roasted fennel mix, omitted the garlic, and cooked it at least i hour til it was where I wanted it. I made it ahead, and rewarmed at the end. Before my guests arrived, I sauteed the two pork tenderloins, and transferred them to a pan for oven roasting. I then made the sauce in the sauteing pan, using two tbsp. of smooshed roasted garlic instead of the raw garlic. I added some ground fennel as well, and kept the sauce covered and off heat until I was ready for it. When I put the pork and asparagus pans in the oven to roast, it was 400* for about 18 minutes and everything came out perfectly. The asparagus was big peeled spears, so the timing was right. The asparagus and added raw fennel fronds added nice green touches to the plates, and it was a hit!.

I didn't think it was much work at all. It's worth serving to guests. Just make sure you don't overcook the meat. Tenderloin should be eaten a bit pink in the middle otherwise it's very dry. It's not a dieters special though. It is a heavy dish with the cream and all.

I enjoyed this dish but I'm not sure I'd make it again as it was a fair amount of work. I gave it a 3 forks althought i think it somewhere in between 2 and 3. I agree with an earlier reviewer that the colors/presentation is lacking - normally this wouldn't matter to me, but the dish borders on looking unappetizing on the plate. Overall thought it is good, just a little more work than I expected.

I wasn't interested in pork tonight so I gave this a try with fresh Coho salmon. Absolutely incredible. Terrific. I skinned the salmon, lightly floured it with Wondra and sauteed in olive oil. For the sauce in place of pork pan juice I substituted a little butter and olive oil. Killer. My wife loved it. A definite do again.

This was a great recipe and a nice change of flavors! I did not have any anise seed, so I substituted Sambuca for flavor. This sauce would be great on chicken and fish too. I'm even thinking about adding celery and more chicken stock and making a winter soup out of the sauce.

This was a wonderful dish that received raves from our guests. We made it for an Easter dinner which was a nice change from the traditionally ham. The fennel is sweet and complements the tenderloin nicely. We had to cook it longer than just the five minutes in the oven. It was closer to 20. I also added apples when roasting as suggested by another reviewer.

This was a great combo of flavors (if you like the strong licorice flavor). I substituted thin-sliced pork chops instead of the loin, it worked very well and was very quick (total prep time about an hour).

We grilled our pork tenderloin and I made the sauce right in with the sauteed fennel and onion. I used marsala wine to sweeten it just a bit, very good.

Rating: 3
Excellent and simple to prepare. Substituted thick boneless chops because I had them, so no slicing at the end. Just need to remember to allow time for the onions and fennel to caramelize (and try to keep them hidden from a family who loves to nibble as they cook). The fennel flavor in the sauce was even better the next day - definitely a keeper for the winter menu circuit.

Extremely tasty recipe - everyone in our dinner party raved, even the kids! The sauce was so good we were scraping the bottom of the bowl. We'll definitely make this again often.

This dish was delicious. Different flavors with pork. Nice change. Will definitely do again. The only reason I didn't give it 4 forks was because the dish lacked color. You definitely need to brighten the plate up with plenty of color. 4 forks for taste and 2 forks for presentation.

What a delightful dish. My children and husband all loved this. I used a boneless pork roast adjusting cooking time of course. I also tossed in quartered apples with the roast. The sweet of the roasted apples complimented the savory onion and fennel and the delightful cream sauce all came together to make a terrific rememberable meal. Thanks for the recipe!

A delicious dish with comparatively few ingredients and reasonable level of complexity (that is, not too time consuming). Unusual enough (pork and the fennel bulbs) to be a wonderful company dish. I'm making it again after a few years hiatus for Christmas this year.

Loved this recipe...here are a few other pork recipes that came out great. Pear and brandy cream sauce with carmelized shallots, Pork tenderloin cranberry port sauce.

What makes this recipe so special is that most of your guests had never eaten fennel. It is easy to make and has been a great hit both times I have made it. It is a difinete that you should make extra fennel. I am certain that everyone will want seconds.

This is one of our family's favorites for guests. prepare the vegetables ahead of time, just leave enough time for the sauce to reduce. It makes a nice presentation, too!

This dish is spectacular. I have made it several times now and am hailed as a gourmet chef by my husband's friends!!! Definitely a keeper.

This recipe is near show stopper. Made the dish for 6 by doubling the onion/fennel mix. The veggie mix was wonderful, but could have been even greater, as guests asked for more. The sauce was very good, but too salty, as it was made with double strength canned broth. I'll make it with home made broth next time and keep salt levels low.

I made this dish for my parents and they loved it. The pork was very moist and the onion fennel mixture was great. My mom who thought she did not like fennel requested to have this dish again soon.

Great fresh flavor. Would make again but with a little sambuca added! yum

Excellent and easily done. The 5 minute oven roast time seemed to me to be too brief to ensure complete cooking of the pork. I left it in the oven for 20-25 minutes before removing and covering. The result was meat that was succulent and perfectly cooked.

Excellent dish for sophisticated adults and young children as well. Make more fennel and sauce -- you will be glad you did! Worth the time in waiting for the fennel to cook just right.

I cooked this dish for Christman Eve and it was pretty good. I am not a big fan of fennel, but the sauce was delicious. If I cook this again I would make more sauce for the pork, my famliy was asking for more.

Very Very Good! I used sambucca to add a little more flavour to the fennel.

A great hit with 12 guests out on the patio in Mexico where the pork is great and the fennel grows wonderfully well in my garden. I took the sauce and blended it then strained it, much more elegant and pungent.

Smashing! I've made this for my families on both sides of the Atlantic and I can honestly report it is an INTERNATIONAL success! I encrust the tenderloin with crushed black pepper and yet more garlic before searing, mmmmm yum! I also use the sauce for pasta and add sauted pine nuts and mushrooms. My six year twin girls just love help aswell as eat this. Thanks.

Mmmmmmm... This was really good. I used Pernod (anise liquier) in place of the wine for added fennel flavour. I also used only one pork tenderloin as was just cooking for two but made the full recipe of the sauce and onion mixture. 10 minutes is too long to brown the tenderloin - I did it for 6 and it came out just right. This would be a great dish for an elegant dinner party.

A Thanksgiving tradition (by popular request)since I first prepared it in 1995! Impressive and simple, but timely (caramelizing the onions). This is one recipe which I actually follow with no recommended changes! Enjoy!
