This was fantastic. Made exactly as directed. However I will double the sauce next time. Served with rice, corn tortillas and black beans. Made from scratch margaritas...yum!

Great flavor - hard to stop eating. Didn't change a thing -- next time will brown the chicken and finish cooking in the crock pot. The hominy really makes this recipe -- don't sub corn, it won't deliver the same flavor or texture. Definitely will make again.

Oh, gosh, I just made this dish and I have to say, it was much better than I expected--sublime! And that's after I took shameless liberties w/ the ingredients....granted, one was fresh roma tomatoes in place of the can ( and a bit of chipotle sauce)....But I also subbed corn (and a little green pepper--hey, it was in my fridge) and black beans for the hominy--and believe me, it would be MUCH better w/ the hominy--and it still rocked. I rarely weigh in when so many people have said same, but, really--this is a recipe that can stand substitutions and still hold up. I did dice up chicken breasts and it was more of a soupy stew....but thighs and thicker would be awesome--I'm sure.

Yum, this is good! I used a can of regular tomatoes with Penzey's Chili 3000 seasoning, and water instead of broth. Didn't add chicken, but it's delicious without (I'm sure it's great with chicken as well, I'm just not a chicken fan). The hominy is crucial to the taste. I rinsed it a few times to take away the canned flavor. It's hard to describe what hominy adds- sort of a creamy body. Corn would be ok, but the dish would be entirely different.

Both weird and wonderful. The chicken thighs are absolutely more flavorful than white meat, and I loved the combination of flavors and textures. I will make this again, but will add more cilantro and probably more chicken and tomatoes. Hominey is the weird part of this dish. I can't decide if I like it but can't imagine the dish without it.

This was a great one dish meal that combined some of my favorite flavors. Although I'm not sure if I'd serve this to company I would definitely make it for the family again - not exactly an "attractive" presentation. I pretty much followed the recipe as written and it was delicious.

I have to add my two cents to the scores of reviews. This meal was fantastic. I ordered green chile sauce from a great place in NM (I'm in NC), and searched for something worthy of putting underneath it. This was the thing. I used chicken breasts (brined ahead of time) and Rotel mild stewed tomatoes(still gave it a kick). I also omitted the chiles (Rotel had them) and used the green chile sauce instead of the taco sauce. It was fantastic. I may make it for our Christmas late lunch / early supper. I love this recipe.

This was very good. I used boneles, skinless thighs. Make sure to track down the hominy...it makes it.

I won't add any more superlatives than others have already done. Just want to say that if you haven't used hominy before, you're missing out. Serve with rice and tortillas. Isn't it Santa Fe?

Followed recipe exactly. If I were to make it again, I'd remove the skin from the thighs before cooking--as it stews, the skin becomes soggy and oily. As long as I'm removing the skin, I wouldn't bother browning the chicken. I liked the yam in combo with the other flavors--something I never would have thought to add.

I made the recipe as called for & we loved it. Next time I will use medium taco sauce as we like heat.

Wow! This was great-I would have never thought of yams in a Southwest/Mesican recipe but the combination of ingredients was wonderful. Will make this a regular!

This has quickly become a staple. I usually make a lasagna or a big pot of soup on Sunday so I won't have to cook for a few nights and this has been a favorite since the first time I made it. My version is generally a little more stew-like (I de-bone the chicken and add a lot more salsa and double the stock) but it re-heats beautifully. The heat is easily toned down with a dollop of sour cream for sensitive palates.

This was delicious! The hominy added a nice chewy texture and the fresh cilantro on top at the end adds a delicious fresh zestyness to the dish. I crumbled queso fresco on top for a little creaminess to balance out the spice. I will absolutely make this again!

Rating: 3
Vastly satisfying and simple to prepare. I used salsa verde rather than taco sauce, a touch of cayenne and extra cilantro; I also shredded the chicken after cooking to make it more stew-like. The sweet potatoes work so nicely in this dish. And left overs galore. Top it with a dollop of plain yogurt or sour cream and dig in.

Fabulous! I've made this many times and have shared the recipe with others who all love it. I substitute green salsa verde for the taco sauce for an extra kick. You really don't need to change a thing!

This was a great one-pot meal - it has more interesting and developed flavors than you'd usually expect to get from a pretty modest and short list of ingredients and simple preparation. But I am vexed by the unspecified use of "yams" in the ingredient list - I would like to know whether they really mean yams...or sweet potatoes. My grocery store does not distinguish between the two, calling sweet potatoes yams, but then they sell what appear to be yams by the name "namé". Confusing...and since a lot of people seem to interpret yam to mean sweet potato, it'd be helpful if the recipe would specify. In any case, I used a sweet potato and it was a fine choice. Loved the color of this dish also. I prepared it with boneless skinless thighs and served it over rice.

Hominy is corn treated with lye until it becomes puffy. It is in the canned vegetable aisle. Hmm . . . treated with lye. Sounds delicious, doesn't it? But this dish is delicious -- made it exactly as indicated (except substituting salsa verde for the taco sauce), and it's a lovely one-dish meal. Very good. And the odd thing is that the yams don't taste exactly like yams. I just wish they'd spell Santa Fe correctly so I could find the recipe when I search for it.

Rating: 3
Delicious. This will become a regular at our house. I used corn because I couldn't find hominy. What's hominy anyway? Red taco sauce because I couldn't find green. Left out the chiles because I forgot to put them on the shopping list. And used regular flavor stewed tomatoes with a tsp of cumin and a tbs of Emeril's essence mixed in. As for other comments on the appearance, it looks great in the pot but somewhat less elegant over a pile of rice on individual plates which is what I think accounts for the differing comments.

Rating: 4
I LOVED this dish. Especially loved the sweet potatoes. I used corn instead of the hominy, but think either way would be great. Also couldn't find green taco sauce so used red. I doubled the recipe and used boneless/skinless thighs, and it was just incredible on a cool night. Maybe not company worthy (just because it doesn't seem "fancy") but really delicious.

Very good flavors, especially the sweet potatoes and the cilantro. I made enough to serve this to my sister tomorrow since it seemed like the kind of recipe that would improve overnight but I'm not sure if I loved it enough to have it again. My husband really liked it though.

Easy and very nice flavors. Couldn't find golden Hominy, so I used white hominy and it was fine. I'll make this again.

Delicious. I will "crock pot" it next time, as that is a convenient way for me to cook. I will also serve it over rice next time. Last, I will cube the chicken instead of serving whole breasts. Like I said, though, it is already good without those changes.

This was a nice change from making the same ole chicken. Very good flavor...even better the second day. I couldn't find hominy so I substituted a can of white corn. I also used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and cut them into pieces.

Yes, I'll make it again. I'll memorize it and keep the ingredients stocked at all times. This recipe is fantastic - easy, quick, beautiful, delicious, healthy. (I don't know what the problem is with the husband of the cook in AZ who didn't like the looks of this dish - surely he's seen southwestern food before!) All those oranges, reds, and yellows were set off perfectly by the green cilantro and chiles. And the taste! Outstanding. My BF (also a cook) exclaimed "delicious!" at the first bite (and he's not easy to impress). I made it exactly as written, but for the meekest palates, a little sour cream might be in order. Fabulous recipe. Make it today, don't deprive yourself any longer.

This dish is fantastic. A wonderful combination of flavors. I used the canned salsa verde in place of the green taco sause as did the cook from Pompano Beach, FL. This adds just a bit more spice to the dish. My teenage son is the only one who does not like this meal. My husband who is a extreme low carb guy..can't stay away from the hominy and yams! This meal makes you want more.

This is an extremely scalable dish - I made it for thirty people, folks!! I even lost track of the exact measurements at some point; I guess that happens when you are multiplying a recipe by 6! I substituted fresh chopped green pepper for some of the chilis - and I forgot the green salsa alltogther. The chicken was a huge success at the dinner party, and even better the next day as leftovers. This recipe is a sure bet.

Rating: 4
Delicious. The chicken itself is very good, but the accompanying vegetables nearly steal the show! Our little market didn't carry the green taco sauce, but I think mild red was a fine substitution. Spanish-style rice, per another reviewer's suggestion, was an ideal side. A definite keeper.

This was fabulous! I was surprised because I hate yams and sweet potatoes, but they weren't too sweet cooked this way, they were good! Used white hominy because my store was out of golden,great! Also used 1/2 cup of canned salsa verde (green salsa readily available in my market) instead of the mild taco sauce. This recipe could easily adapt to more diner's by just increasing the amount of chicken thighs and nothing else. My spoiled husband loved it and wants me to make it again. Very easy!

I've made this dish several times and I keep coming back to it. It's hearty like a chili or stew. I use diced boneless chicken breasts (Costco), stewed tomatoes with jalapenos for extra kick, add 1 tablespoon of cumin, and substitute corn and a little barley for the hominy. It's a versatile dish and you can spice it up to your liking.

I tripled this and prepared it for our casual Christmas Eve supper which included adults and a variety of ages of children. It was a great success. I pretty much followed the recipe as written although my husband brought home Italian style stewed tomatoes instead of Mexican from the market. The combination of texture and flavor is wonderful. We served it with brown rice, crispy tostadas with hand mashed frijoles, and a big green salad followed by The Perfect Flan. We made Posole (I used the Pork and Hominy Stew With Red Chiles) for our Christmas Day meal and by Saturday, we combined all the leftovers from both meals in one pot, simmered it for a bit and topped with all the posole fixings. It was divine. Although I had meant to have enough to freeze for at least one more meal, not a morsel was left.

I've made this recipe many times for my family. To make really come together quickly, I prepare all of the ingredients ahead of time (i.e., combine in a bowl those items that go in together) and use boneless chicken breasts. I find that bone-in thighs take more than 20 minutes to cook, thus lengthening the overall prep time. This is even a hit with my daughter (4 years old) and it's a great way to get in her orange veggies. YUM!!!

I agree with the cook who added fresh peppers to this, though I've cooked it both ways, now. I didn't have any canned chilies this time, but I did have one fresh poblano pepper, which I roasted and chopped....deeee-licious!!! A very nice recipe, either way you do it.

FABULOUS! My husband hasn't stopped raving for two weeks, and over such an easy supper. The recipe was easy to pull together on a weeknight, and the flavors complimented each other very well. I followed a previous reviewer and used medium salsa verde - great suggestion! The only thing I'll do differently next time is add 1/2 cup of baby lima beans to add some more color and texture.

This was really good, a definite success. I used boneless skinless breasts instead of thighs, and served over rice as suggested. Both great. If you've never tried hominy, make this dish and use the hominy because you'll really like it, it's just a sweeter, softer corn. I've eaten it all my life, comfort food extraordinaire.

Because I had left-over saffron rice in the refrigerator, I did not use the hominy, (besides, I have never eaten hominy before in my life). I must say, the color of the yellow saffron rice, the orange yams and the green chile sauce was a beautiful sight to behold. The smell... magnificent! The taste... outstanding!

This has become a family favorite. I've made it about 6 times. I always have to double the recipe, next-day leftovers are even better. The aroma while cooking will draw people in off the street. I generally increase the cilantro and use a tomatillo-based salsa verde instead of the taco sauce. It tastes better and it's also easier to find.

This is a great " make on the weekend - reheat on a work night " dish. Meat and veggies in a one pot recipe. I was doubtful about the yams, but it was a major "make it again!" dish for our family. I added a bit of extra hot sauce for more zing. make the yams cubes smaller for a shorter cooking time. Marty

This is a generous recipe. For a party, I made it in two versions (one for guest who couldn't deal with the spiciness). For the very mild, I omitted the chiles and used plain canned tomatoes. Good, but not exciting. But for the other, next time I would use the hotter pepper version of the tomatoes; I increased the amount of taco sauce, too. Not too spicy after all, but a very interesting play of flavors. My guests loved it.

This is not only a winner, but an easy and forgiving dish. I've made it when I've been missing several ingredients, even w/out the yams. It works with just canned tomatoes rather than Mexican, and with jalapeno or other hot sauce if you don't have the taco sauce. Do not cheat on the hominy/pozole, however. It's the soul of the dish. I've served this for a big crowd with seasoned rice (sauteed onion and garlic and chicken broth)and a side dish of Anaheim chilis stuffed with a mixture of ricotta and Monterey Jack cheese to great effect!
