excellent recipe! I did not use the extra chiles -- just used the red curry paste + less than 1 tsp. sambal chile pepper sauce. It had a slow, back of the throat heat that was perfect. I also used creamy peanut butter and coconut milk instead of water. Went perfect w/ the chicken sates.

Followed the recipe, with the exception of using 3 tablespoons peanut butter instead of grinding them. Also, could only find green Thai chiles. It's a really tasty sauce, and while certainly spicy, not overwhelmingly so. I'm sure the spiciness is dictated by the kind of peppers used. Replace or mix with mayo and put on a crusty french baguette for a sandwich - YUM!

Woo! Cutting it w/ coconut milk was a great call. The serrano & curry paste created a FIRE situation. The coconut milk helped but it was still hot.

I thought it would be too hot but everyone loved it. I've also added coconut milk to calm it down and that worked well.

I used two green serano peppers and it was too hot. But its packed with flavor and a good compliment to the chicken sates recipe.

Made this to go with the chicken sate for a party. Everyone loved it. Used natural peanut butter instead of peanuts so the texture was pretty smooth. People were spooning it over their side dishes and my sister-in-law said she could eat it with a spoon...

curry paste really benefits from a bisk saute over med-high heat before incorporating into sauce. Prefer using coconut milk rather than ground peanuts/water mix as mealy texture from ground peanuts - less than ideal mouth appeal. Start with the peppers seeded first - then decide whether to add entire peppers on second batch - we love hot Thai & Malay condiments & this with seeds is certainly hot - another reason to use coconut milk as a base. Recommend using peanut butter rather than ground peanuts - will not make again.
