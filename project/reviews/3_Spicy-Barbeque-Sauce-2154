Yum, I have this simmering on the stove and I can't stop taste testing. I used balsamic as well (everything tastes better with balsamic) If it's not sweet enough add some brown sugar. I added a squeeze of lime juice added a little red wine and had no celery, but used shallots instead of onion. Yummmm

I was skeptical, but this turned out great. Added black pepper, Only about 2 tablespoons of honey and also about a tablespoon of Jack Daniels (a secret of the south). I liked my onion and celery chopped really fine.

good flavor, but didn't come through much on my grilled chicken. maybe i just didn't put enough on?

I added the half cup of honey and some fresh black pepper. I also made the suggested substitution of balsamic vinegar for apple cide vinegar. Afterwards, I tried to use the sauce with 2.5 lbs of pork ribs in my slow cooker, but I had to add another half cup of beer to have enough liquid. I will definitely make this again!

I felt this recipe was excellent,the tangy sauce is a very nice change from sweet. I pulled pork from a Tenderloin and mixed it with this barbeque, served on roll with sharp white cheese and it was great. Fresh Garlic and Celery salt were the only substitites.

I added 1/2 cup of honey and replaced the cider vinegar with balsamic vinegar. Gave it a real kick and a bit of sweetness. We really liked it!

Just did not like.

I chose this recipe because it is unsweetened. We liked the sauce, but my husband said he would like to have another sauce next time. Something is missing, unfortunately I think it is the sweetener. I plan on trying it once again, next time adding some honey and seeing if I like it better. My parents said they liked it a lot, as did my husband, but I wasn't that crazy about it.

This is a very nice, full-bodied not to sweet barbeque sauce. I recommend adding the ketchup to your taste at the end. I added a minced chili in adobo sauce and wowee.

I used this recipe to add to some leftover smoked pork ribs and it was perfect!

This recipe was good. It was not over-powering so I'de recommend it on chicken "not" beef/ribs. I did add a half cup of honey for extra sweetness, this helped.

This is one of the best homemade barbeque sauces I have ever made, it is the perfect sauce for my own homemade beancrock.
