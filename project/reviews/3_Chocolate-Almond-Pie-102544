Made this for Thanksgiving, without variation except that I used my tried-and-true pate brisee. I'll try the crust some other time. It was simple and really good. A note to our friend in Atlanta, who "followed directions to the letter:" BITTERSWEET chocolate is NOT the same as UNSWEETENED chocolate. That's why it "wasn't sweet enough." There are lots of people who can't cook, thank goodness only a few of them have the hubris to blast perfectly good recipes.

To the pate brisee cook, how would you know Atlanta used bittersweet chocolate? Aren't we quick to judge. This recipe was chock full o'nuts. Some of my company loved it, some did not.

I made this again with 2 cups of nuts and my usual pie crust with the spices added. I agree with the Atlanta review regarding the unaltered recipe. I think the rest of the filling was excellent made with 3oz. of semi-sweet chocolate and 2/3 cup of sugar. Next time I will use 1 and 1/2 cups of nuts.

This pie got fabulous reviews at my Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone wanted seconds!! I didn't find it too dry at all. It came out just perfect.

This pie was fabulous! I used semi-sweet chocolate chips for the chocolate and not bittersweet. The crust was increible - and would be wonderful on a fruit pie (just use water in lieu of the liquer). My guests all raved. This is a keeper.

This pie recipe was awful. I actually threw it out after serving it to 3 people, no one ate more than a few bites. Too many nuts ( and I LOVE nuts) not sweet enough,dry crust. I followed directions to the letter. MOVE ON.
