This is a great alternative to the more traditional succotash. I have made it two years in a row for Thanksgiving, to rave reviews. Both times I found the vegetables needed to roast for about 15 minutes longer than the recipe calls for, to bring out their sweetness. Although it's a little labor intensive, it's straightforward and consistently good.
