We found the dressing to be overpowering. It would serve better as a marinade, then use a chili-lime dressing for the actual salad. We will not be making this, as written, again.

a nice light dinner- I'd recommend marinating the tuna a little longer, especially thick steaks. Watercress is a nice change from the usual salad blends. Overall, worth trying- easy too.
