I love the flavors of this bread. I always use Rhodes Frozen Bread Dough, it tastes just like homemade. Thank you for sharing.

I used fresh herbs from my garden (rosemary, oregano, basil and thyme) and it turned out excellent. Everyone at the party loved the bread. Wish I would have made 2 loaves!

I was skeptical, but the bread was delicious. Very easy too. The first time I forgot the pepper, but I think it was just as delicious--just more subtle. My husband wants it again with supper tonight.

I made homemade white bread dough and added the spices. Very good.
