KevintheCaterer from New York City It really peeves me when people like you criticize a recipe that the good people at Epicurious do their best to find the RECIPES for the 1000"s of people worldwide who like me ( SYDNEY AUSTRALIA) log in for. If you think you can do better, why don't you be kind enough & share your superior recipe with the rest of us - BUT you know what they say about opinions??

I live in Chinatown East. I make this alsmost daily, this recipe is not even close to authentic.

I concur with Susan from Florida, it's best to marinate and grill the pork tenderloin whole rather than slicing it first. This recipe makes a fairly authentic Char Siew, is delicious and great to use in a curry laksa.

We used this recipe for grilling a pork tenderloin whole, rather than doing any of the skewer or slicing thing. Good!

Recipe tasted better when printed on glossy paper. Tried on a variety of colored papers with just so so results.
