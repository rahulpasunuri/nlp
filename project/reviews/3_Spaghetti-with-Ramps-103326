Good but not great. I tried it last week. It was just lacking something. For this week's ramps, I used a recipe my friend adapted from Batali's ramp spaghetti. Now that was good. The link for any who are interested: http://www.neurotickitchen.com/2012/04/ramped-up-spaghetti-with-ramps.html

Worst recipe. I love ramps but if there's one way for me to hate it, it's to put it in pasta. No matter how you make it, ramps are just totally lost in pasta dishes-- even if you put 1000 lbs of ramps in it! Seriously. I was very disappointed. Even after adding this and that to "ramp" up the flavor factor. Try ramps with eggs and tiny bit of garlic and salt. After cooking. sprinkle with a tiny bit of pecorino and freshly ground black pepper. Pinot blanc is a great pairing with this dish. Now that's what I'm talkin' about..

I started researching ramps after reading http://eattheview.barndiva.com/2011/06/14/prix-fixe-menu-art-gallery-wedding/ and I love this recipe. I am so excited about a new ingredient- and a new vegetable. My kids will love it! Thank you!

I threw in a handful of parsley, a handful of pine nuts, and used just a squeeze of lemon. Delicious! And a beautiful, vibrant color! This is a keeper.

To the Confused San Fransiscans, Ramps are wild leeks that are only in season in early Spring and they grow primarily in mountainous areas on the east coast, that's why you don't see them in your grocery stores. Their flavor has more piquancy than normal leeks and add an amazing flavor to all kinds of dishes. If you're traveling on the east coast in April give them a try.

I liked this, but it needed more umami. The lemon zest was odd. I once did something similar, but added the juices from a roast beef, and that made all the difference in the world... I'll keep trying, though! It's the very beginning of the ramps season here, so there is much opportunity for experimentation

Extremely mild, the lemon nearly overpowered the ramps and made us wonder why the heck we dug up all those dang ramps anyway. Would probably be better with garlic and toasted pine nuts as a pesto.

I didn't use the lemon zest, which I didn't miss, or the cheese, which I did. I used the sauce as I would a pesto--it has that same sense of freshness and spice. The heat, similar to that in raw garlic, is a bit overwhelming if you blanch the ramps for only a few seconds. A good compromise would be to blanch, say, two thirds of them for half a minute, and the last third for 3 seconds or so, as the recipe indicates. That would probably mellow out the flavors while still having enough spice to keep things interesting.

This recipe works well with regular leeks. I like to use the juice of a roasted lemon and very little zest when making this pesto, softening the taste nicely.

Delicious and easy. I get ramps from the ravine behind my house!

Ramps, also called wild leeks, always sell out quickly at the farmer's market. This pesto-like recipe is supereasy and delicious. I also used fresh-ground black pepper and squeezed on some lemon juice. Since ramps do belong in the onion family and have a garlicky-oniony flavor, the dish is more pungent than basil pesto and has a slight bitterness. Take the pasta out of the water a minute before al dente, since you have to cook it with the sauce for a couple of minutes.

Do tell!! A recipe for Ramps! These "wild garlic/onion type plants" were celebrated with a festival in the Great Smoky Mountains when I was there in the early 1970's while attending the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. They are strong and flavorful, and for lovers of garlic absolutely medicinal. Enjoy!

I'm another San Franciscan who isn't familar with "ramps." Is this an East Coast exclusive or do we Left Coasters simply call it (them?) something else?

I have been waiting for a recipe to try ramps. Each Spring, when ramps are fresh in the produce section, I wonder what they are. Finally a chance to try them out. They add a delcious and mild flavor to the pasta. This is a great simple dish.

Don't know what ramps is.
