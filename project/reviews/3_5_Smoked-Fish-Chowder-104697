So quick and easy and rich and delicious. It even made a supposed non-fish eater happy!

This is an excellent, easy soup that I have made with canned smoked sturgeon and fresh smoked trout. It's perfect with oyster crackers sprinkled on top!

Oh my gosh!! This is a great recipe. I am lucky enough to live in Alaska, so i used salmon that was smoked by my brother. Used the hints from others and put in corn and substituted tarragon in place of thyme. Turned out great. Careful when simmering after the addition of the milk, do not let it boil. Will definately make this again.

Hailing from the prime trout waters of Wyoming, I have used this recipe as a popular means to dispense with all the fish I had been catching. Fortune has caused me to move to South Carolina where I've had to make adjustments. Replace the trout with packaged smoked salmon and replace the thyme with tarragon and you have a killer salmon chowder (I also use smoked baby clams).

This is the perfect recipe for busy moms who entertain! It has alot bang for the buck (time wise that is; smoked trout can be expensive). I've used non smoked salmon also; delicious, but the smoked trout was much tastier.

This is a very tasty weeknight meal. I substituted with smoked peppered mackerel and got great results.

I think the taste of this recipe depends a lot on the quality of the smoked fish. My chowder was much too salty and the smoky flavor overpowered the taste of the other ingredients. I think the problem's probably not the recipe, but the trout I purchased.

I added some dry white wine, garlic and cayenne because it needed some added flavor. It tasted great! Will make again.

Doubled and made this for company, substituting mushroom broth for the clam juice for the shellfish-allergic, and throwing in some corn for the full "chowda" effect. Easy and so delicious!
