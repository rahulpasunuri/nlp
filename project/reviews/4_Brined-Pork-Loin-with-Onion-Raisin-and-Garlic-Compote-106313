I chose to grill-roast this recipe and used a 4 lb section of loin. Flavor and texture turned out OK but ending roast at 140 degrees is going to overcook in the end as thermal mass is quite high in this cut and expect a 15-20 degree maturation of internal temp. I would recommend ending roast at 130 or so and waiting for a final temp of 145-150 for medium. says I

Beyond S & P, it says a lot about the quality of meat and/or whether your diners are purists to just go with herbs, but I like that and so found this to be a very nice way to compliment the natural, albeit enhanced via brining, pork flavor. My only note is actually a question to anyone who'd like to educate me: I like roasts that have been seared first but this recipe makes no mention of searing.. when would I do that, if at all... before or after the herbs have been adhered to the roast?

This was fabulous! The pork was moist and the compote was to die for. I did use chopped yellow onions, chopped garlic and cranberries for the compote which I made the day before. It was an easy yet impressive meal to make for guests.

This is a wonderful recipe but the roast would be thoroughly overcooked at the temp the receipe calls for. Ina Garten says to cook a pork loin roast to 138 degrees and that is exactly perfect with the meat being slightly pink throughout and no chance of dryness.

Delicious--roast & the compote! The compote especially garnered rave reviews at a recent dinner. I used white onion rather than the pearl, but otherwise followed recipes.

Brining the pork insures that it will be moist, which is such a relief. The flavor of the brining spices penetrated the meat perfectly. I did have a loin roast consisting of two pieces tied together, so it was thick and the roast took about two hours to reach 150 degrees. This was Christmas dinner at our house, and it went over very well with everyone.

Best Christmas dinner in 35 years. I made a butter/flour roux and stirred it into the compote, as we like a little something that's a distant relative of gravy to adhere to the pork. Next time I'll use little red or sliced yellow onions, as the white ones were a bit too powerful for the delicate herb flavor of the roast and compote.

Brined two days. Used dried marjoram,leaf sage, fresh thyme, rosemary.

A few words regarding this recipe: succulent and delicious!!!! Do make sure that you use the fresh water bath to remove the brine. On the Compote, I messed up and only had regular onions to use and it was wonderful!!!

Moist and delicious pork, but the star is the compote.

This was the main attraction for this years Christmas dinner. Moist and very flavourful and everyone commented on just that. Served with, cauliflower with rye crumbs, and sauteed haricots verts, red bell peppers & pine nuts, all from this site. Also Lundberg brown and wild rice done in veggie stock. Also had pan fried Digby scallops and giant prawns. I will definetely make all again!

This recipe is extraordinary, I've been making it for years. The brining makes for a moist meat, which is not easy with the low-fat pork we find in supermarkets. The only things I've adjusted: buy the frozen pearl onions, peeling pearl onions is a huge waste of time. And either decrease the onions or increase the port, to make more liquid.

This was a spectacular Christmas dinner. The herb crust makes the roast pork and the compote was the star of the whole dinner! Made more or less as it was written; the compote took much longer to cook down to soften the onions and thicken the sauce, 45-50mins. Absolutely worth it. Served w/mashed potatoes and a glazed beet/cabbage dish.

Wow! What a wonderful and tasty recipe! The pork was absolutely juicy and tasty but the star of the night was the onion, raisin and garlic compote. My friends couldn't stop raving about it. I served this with gnocchi with mushrooms and butternut sqash as well as green beans sauted with garlic and red onion. Yum!

I've made this recipe several times over the holidays in the last year and every time it is a phenomenal success. I too substitute cider for water, and dried cranberries for the raisins in the compote, and my family and guests just go wild. I too have guests having seconds and thirds and BEGGING for the recipe. I agree with another reviewer - great for the holidays because you can make it ahead and it's very easy to just put in the oven. The onion raisin and garlic compote is an absolute must have, not because the pork isn't already wonderful, but because the compote is such a perfect compliment to the pork that, having had it, I can't imagine serving this dish with anything else. Some lovely lightly sauteed green beans with oven roasted baby red potatoes and a great bottle of red wine and you have a marvelous feast that isn't heavy but oh so satisfying.

excellent!! Great presentation and very impressive yet easy to prepare...would definitely make again. The pork was very moist, the compote very tasty

The brine was excellent, however I did add some fresh thyme, rosemarry and sage to it. I also changed the compote because I can only eat sweet onions. I used a medium sweet onion which I sauteed in butter, then deglazed with the Port and reduced by half. I then added 1 quart of chicken broth with other ingredients, minus the raisins, and cooked for about 25 - 30 minutes. Added the thyme and topped off with about 1/4 cup of cream. I served this with sliced apples cooked in a little butter, then softened with some cider and added raisins and thyme sprigs. I cater small dinner parties and have gotten rave reviews on this one.

I made this recipe with a few revisions to the compote based on what I had in my cupboard. Instead of regular sugar, I used maple sugar and instead of white wine vinegar I used red wine vinegar. What an amazing recipe! My husband loved it!

The only reason I'm not giving this four forks is that roasting the pork to 150 degrees is a bum steer. Next time I will roast to 145. It was just a little too overcooked. I brined in apple juice and ground coriander (instead of the water and coriander seed) and didn't bother to do the water soak, it was fine. Compote is great, but I had to cook mine wa-a-a-ay longer than 9 minutes to soften the onions. More like 45 mins. And I wished the onions were smaller. Next time might try halving them.

Brining this pork was spectacular - it made the pork incredibly tender. I did not even get as far as the compote, my family wanted it as was.

Actually, I give this recipe 3.75 forks! I am surprised that only 83% of reviewers would make it again, as all the reviews I read (which were helpful) were so incredibly positive. My husband's quote was "It's the best pork loin I've ever had". We grilled it until it reached 148 and then let it sit for 10-15 minutes. It was suculent and tender and absolutely delicious. As per another reviewer, I did 4 c apple cider/4 c water on the brine. Also, I used approximately 3/4 tsp of dried herbs in place of fresh (as I didn't have them). We will DEFINITELY make this again. I'm sure it will be our standard for pork loin from now on. I didn't make the compote, but am tempted to just because the reviews were so positive for that as well. This recipe may seem a bit labor intensive and require some advance planning, but it is SOOOOO worth it. You will not be sorry! I can't wait to make sandwiches out of the leftovers!

This dish was wonderful. Even though I over cooked the pork (on the grill) it was still very moist. I also substituted dried cranberries for the raisins and it was delicious.

FANTASTIC! This dish surprised me - I have never done a brine before and took the advice of a previous chef and did a 2-day brine. Then I also included the accompanying compote - I have to admit that while making this it just didn't smell appetizing but I just kept with it... the final product was incredible! The pork and compote got rave reviews at our XMas Eve dinner tonight! I couldn't wait to write this review.

This is one of the best brines I've tried. I used it on loin chops, which I froze in the brine and thawed about a week later. This wasn't my original plan, but turned out to be so convenient and delicious that I think I'll try to keep these stocked for fast dinners in the future.

Was absolutely delicious. I didn't have any fennel seeds, so I used 2 T of herbs de provence instead. I also let the roast soak for 2 days. I didn't make the compote and i didn't coat the roast w herbs. instead I glazed it with Fischer Wieser roasted raspberry chipotle sauce and put a generous grinding of coarse black pepper over the top. Every bit of the roast was moist and delicious.

The Onion, Raisin and Garlic Compote really makes this pork dish happen. I don't recommend the pork loin without it, but together it's amazing.

Came out very juicy, but wasn't as tasty as expected. Probably needs the compote to add more flavor to it...

This recipe took a little advance planning, but it turned out great. And my guests thought I was a gourmet cook. I used the white pearl onions, but I think I would prefer red. The compote is a must and it presents well. I will make this again - it's a winner if you want something special.

The recipe for the pork was absolutely wonderful! Very moist - and soaking the pork loin in the brine really helped me to thaw it out. I grilled it for 30 minutes, turning halfway (it was about 5 or so pounds of pork) until it was juicy pink inside. However, of my guests only 1 or 2 liked the compote - one person absolutely loved it. I was not overly thrilled myself, so I would skip the compote.

The brining produced a moist tenderloin with a great flavor. I used 4 cups vinegar and 4 cups water for the brine instead of only water and cooked the loin in a cooking bag. Definitely a keeper recipe.

Easy and delicious! Beautifully moist pork loin - I can't imagine how a previous reviewer ended up with dry pork! The compote is also fabulous.

I cut the recipe in half to try it out on my husband and a friend with a 1-kg loin. I generally have pretty good luck getting moist pork, so I wasn't immediately convinced that the brining made a difference (apart from adding a nice taste dimension) ... but nibbling on leftovers the next day made me a convert: even cold and day-old, the pork was juicy and succulent! Didn't make the compote, but served it with haricots verts and pine nuts and gratin dauphinois, and the cranberry-ginger chutney also on the site. Mmmmmm!

I made this twice now and it just keeps getting better. This time I made it for a New Years Eve gathering that I took to Killington. So I not only made everything ahead, but I also frozed the brine and the compote. The only adjustment that I made was that I use 4 cups of water with 4 cups of apple cider. In the compote, I found the little red onions are much nicer then the white one's. Also, this time I added in a handful of quarted figs, and I split the raisen portion in half and mixed in currents. I soaked this in a large ziploc bag that I then place in a plastic container and store in the fridge overnight. Then I soak it again in a ziploc bag that stands on the counter. If I can, I try and change the water twice. This is a wonderful, easy recipe if you plan everything ahead. I served this with the mixed green salad with oranges, dried cranberries and pecans (again, made everything ahead) and baked potatoes! A good bottle of wine and you have yourself a $50 dinner per person. Not a morsal of food was left!

We served this using a 5-1/2 lb roast, serving 12 people. Outstanding results....excellent flavor (the onion compote is a perfect companion). We adjusted the time (upward) to account for the larger roast, and it came out perfectly. Easy to make (if you do everything the prior day) and all the guests loved it....the man helping us at the party (head of catering at the Chicago Peninsula Hotel) thought this was the best pork recipe he had ever had (a great endorsement!). Highly recommedned without any alterations from this recipe.

I've used this on everything but my cheerios. The first time I made this recipe I didn't really read the instructions because I was just looking for a brine recipe. I put all of the herbs and spices in the brine recipe by mistake. I didn't soak the meat in water later, either. I just rinsed it off. It wasn't too salty and the meat was divine roasted on the grill. I've used it this way with turkey, chicken, ribs and flank steak. I always use a thermometer and the meat is always perfect.

I am giving this 4 forks because my dinner guests just loved it! All had seconds, and some even had thirds! I did this for a holiday dinner, and the fact that you have to brine it overnight was actually quite helpful...just roast and eat. I don't know what the previous cook did that made the pork come out dry; mine was very juicy. One change: I had a 5 1/2 pound roast, so I made a recipe and a half of the brine. If I did that again, I'd keep the salt at 1/2 cup. I think the extra 1/4 cup made it a little salty. Oh, and you must make the compote! The combination of savory and sweet was unbeatable!

Was a bit put off by other cook's comments, but had really wonderful results with the dish. Added a touch of balsamic to marinade; cooked the roast without a rack to amelierate dryness; the compote adds to the final flavor.

I thought it was a lot of work for another dry pork recipe. Maybe I overcooked it, but I just think that pork is always dry. It was moist when I cut into it, but it was dry when it went on the plate. The compote was good--would make it again, but add only 1/8 cup of vineagar this time.

I was skeptical about the brine, it smelled potent, but I went ahead with the instructions. I also went out on my own for a topping and made an apricot curry glaze, from this month's Parenting Magazine. The pork was delicious and moist. I used an instant read thermometer and the roast was done in 65 minutes. The length of 1 hour and 40 would have ruined it I fear.

To cook from Palm Springs: just click on the red line for the compote and it takes you to the recipe. This is common on this site - separate recipe. That is why it is highlighted in red - you simply follow the link. Also, the compote recipe is listed in the "what's new" group - just scroll down until you find it.

Where is the compote recipe? I have had brined pork and love it...the compote sounds good too??But where is it hidden? I tried search to no avail...

I wanted to follow this recipe to the letter (I know many posters get angry when you don't!) but I coudn't resist substituting 1/2 apple cider for 1/2 the water in the brining proccess. It added such a depth of flavor to the pork and blended perfectly with the spices. The compote was a wonderful change of pace. However the pork recipe alone would be great with a number of other things as well, even just apple sauce, a salad and roasted potatos. A great easy after work meal if you remember to start the brining prcess the night before or in the morning. Being a new Mom (who works full time) it nice to have easy, flavorful meals to enjoy since dinner is the one time my husband and I have to catch up!
