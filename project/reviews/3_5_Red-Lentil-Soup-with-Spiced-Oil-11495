I doubled the lentils, cumin, coriander. Used gr.cumin and Aleppo peppers in the oil. This was very good soup. A hand blender makes slick work of blended soups like this.

This soup was great on its own, but the spiced oil put it over the top. I used red chili flakes instead of fresh chili.

Unlike others, I thought this soup had a really nice balance of flavors. I would not accuse it of being bland. I used a minced Thai chili AND additional cayenne pepper to get it to my desired heat level. The lentils detract from some of the heat so I might use 2 Thai chilis next time. I'm looking forward to leftovers tomorrow!

I LOVE this soup. I have made it many times, and everyone always wants a second bowl.

I made this with just what I had in my cupboard. I only had one red onion, so I added 1 potato to take the other onions place and to make it thicker and more filling. Worked great! I can't believe people thought this was bland. Maybe the potato helped, but I didn't even need the salt and pepper, so tasty!

I liked the flavors in this soup and it was easy to make. However, it wasn't very filling. Maybe next time I'd add more lentils to give it more bulk. We ate ours with some purchased Garlic Naan, and that was really good combo.

This is quite possibly the simplest and most delicious lentil soup I've ever eaten. My husband and son adore it. Don't change a thing -- it's the balance of spices that makes it heavenly.

Lovely, complex, subtle, very impressive for such a simple preparation. I use veg stock.

I followed the recipe as shown and agree with the reviewer who said this soup was rather bland.The hot oil is a must as it really adds to the flavor and kicks the spice up. I did not have pappadams so served the soup with grilled pita bread which was nice. I would definitely make this again but would increase the spice as suggested by other reviewers

My husband and I love this recipe, it is very easy, inexpensive, and delicious. I tend to increase all the spices to taste.Our favorite lentil soup recipe!

Yum & more yum. I increased the cumin & added more cayenne. Also tried with a spoon of yogurt & that was excellent. The next day cold out of the fridge is yum as well!

I followed the recipe to a T, including spiced oil, and it was just ok - not great or fantastic, just ok. Really bland and dull. Had to doctor it with hot sauce to give it a bit of a kick. It's amazing how something with all these great ingredients can come out so underwhelming.

Great soup for a snow day. DO NOT skip the hot oil! It is the step that transforms this soup and gives it depth and a nice zing. I strained mine (the hot oil blackened everything instantly)and poured it into the rest of the soup. Stick to the freshly grated ginger, I don't think you'll get the same taste from a powdered ginger. I only wish I'd been able to find some pappadams to complete it, had to settle for pita instead.

Make this dish as directed, including the spiced oil! I used crushed dried red peppers instead of fresh, and the result was terrific: The oil is a typically Indian addition, and it adds a delicious depth of flavor, plus a mild kick from the peppers. I didn't have poppadoms, but I'm certain they are the perfect accompaniment. This is the best Indian red lentil soup I've tasted, and it's all made from pantry ingredients. Perfect for a cold day.

I made this recipe exactly as shown, minus the spiced oil (instead I just sprinkled some turmeric atop of it). I was getting a little anxious toward the end of cooking time because it looked...well...just unappealing and really watery (not my favorite soup texture). After blending, however, a nice texture and color was achieved. I made brown basmati rice with the intention of spooning the soup/stew over it. Instead, everyone added the rice to the soup which gave it a wonderful flavor and a much more favorable texture (for me at least). Served it with the naan bread recipe on Emeril's web site (but did partially whole wheat...it's a good recipe, but not really authentic). All in all, I would definitely make this again but will do some research into other spices and ingredients I can add to make it more authentically Indian (and thus a little more multidimensional and exciting on the palate).

Great soup! I made a few changes depending on what I had at hand ... used my curry spice mix instead of the recommended spices being out of coriander and ginger. I added also added more galic. I skipped the blender too. Be great to use it as a topping for rice also. YUM!

I really enjoyed this soup! I did not bother with the spiced oil or the pappadams...the soup is delicious on its own...and very easy and quick.

Delicious and simple. i almost didn't puree it because i like a lumpy soup, but in the end i did and i didn't regret it. this is, by far, my favorite lentil soup recipe. (i used vegetable broth instead of chicken and it was fine). i didn't bother with the spiced oil and just had it with some homemade bread. i'll definitely make this again soon on a cold night.

This was a quick and easy recipe. I thought it was pretty good but my husband loved it.

We love this soup, and the leftovers are even better! I add chopped carrot along with the lentils and blend the whole thing right in the pot with my immersion blender. The spiced oil is a must, as is lots of fresh coriander.

Delicious! A fabulous precursor to tandoori chicken and vegetable patties with coconut ice cream topped with mangos for dessert!

Hmmm. What to say? We HATED this just off the stove, deemed it inedible and went out for ice cream to stave off hunger. Later when cleaning lentil cement off the dishes (rinse quickly or forever suffer the consequences!) it tasted "hmm, better ..." so I decided not to discard. Today for lunch? Pretty good! Can't explain the reaction: we LIKE soup, we LIKE cumin/corinader, we LIKE lentils. I know soups often improve overnight but have never before encountered something going from inedible to otherwise. And I used homemade broth from the freezer and quite typically, only 1 T fat. So ... will try again but not plan to serve the first night and THEN see what the reaction is.

Red lentil soup was comfort food in college, and this was a great way to reminisce without the stress of papers and exams. I found the oil to be somewhat superfluous, and I didn't bother to puree the soup as the lentils pretty much disintegrate anyway once you cook it thoroughly. A good crusty bread and a green salad make this a complete meal.

The flavours in this soup are wonderful. Great on a winter's day! Fresh ginger is essential and I love the flavour it provides, but I do not like the texture it has a tendency to leave behind (sometimes it's stringy even after it's pureed). Next time I make this soup I will leave the ginger in thin slices so that I can remove it before it is pureed in the food processor.

Loved it...used more spiced oil than the recipe suggests though.

I love this soup!! It is so simple to make and taste delicious! I do alter the recipe a little. I extra coriander and cumin about 3 times as much. I add a few crushed red peppers to the soup. I also had two cans of tomatoes. This makes the soup a little thicker. And I always blend in the blender. Enjoy!!

Hmm...I just loved rubbing the oils all over my beans. They were just so scrumptious and tasty! I liked how the oil gets all warm and rolls all around the pan, I'm gonna have to get my husband to help on the next one. Go pappa-pappa-pappadams! Yummy to my tummy!

excellent! Careful not to burn the oil, it's easy to do.

This is an excellent, warming, beautiful soup. I made it four a large family dinner and everyone was licking their bowls clean, even the kids. The spiced oil is a wonderful addition, and definitely serve with pappadams if you can find them. Yumm...

I love this recipe! It is, by far, one of the best soups that I have ever made! I do increase the amount of cumin and coriander to 2tb and never make the spiced oil, but aside from that, I leave everything the same and it turns out great each time. Plus it is super easy and the family loves it!

I combined this recipe with a similar one (http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=13487) to make a more substantial dinner. Basically, I added carrots and red pepper, is what that means :) Also, I have no blender so I let it simmer for 40 minutes and the lentils fell apart to make a thick, stewy soup. It was really good! Delicate and aromatic, but really substantial. Plus there was a ton left over for the freezer. Served with purchased babaganoush and pita and it was lovely.

An excellent beginning to a meal. If your guests find it too thick, they can add yogurt with lemon juice and cayenne pepper to thin it a little.

I added a little cayenne and a squeeze of lemon juice before serving and it came out tasting very similar to the lentil soup that my favorite Moroccan restaurant serves!

a very common ,everyday indian food, it can be made interesting by adding some tamarind juiceto it once the lentils are completely boiled and adding red chilli powder gives it an authenticindian flavour.

Everyone that I have served this to has asked for the recipe! This is simple and yummy. I love the exotic flavors and now that I found pappadams and red lentils on ethnicgrocer.com I can make it more often! PS pappadams can also be cooked in the microwave (I usually don't use it but thought I would mention it anyway.)

Easy to do, fabulous taste!, I will make it again, my wife was surprised. Next time I will be sure to have indian or pita bread at hand, because the intense and delicious flavor requires that kind of accompaniment.
