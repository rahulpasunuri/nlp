This is a great recipe. As others suggested, I substituted wine for the water. In addition, I did not push the mixture through the sieve -- it's delicious and so much less work to save the solids for the sauce. My husband isn't a fan of shrimp, so I poached halibut in the sauce. It was really excellent!!

Wow! Quite a bit of work, but totally worth it. I used dried habanero pepper because I did not have the poblanos. Served with thai spicy watermelon soup, coconut rice, and grilled veggies. One of the best meals I've ever eaten.

I've made this dish many times and I thought it was delicious as is. However I thought it was even better by adding white wine instead of water. Not pushing the mixture thru the sieve, just really blending it up in the food processor.. oh and using a lot more cilantro almost twice as much. I also added a few shakes of garlic salt and red pepper flakes, and juice of a small lime.

This was good but I did not discard all the solids, I kept half to make a more substantial sauce

After all the rave reviews, maybe my expectations were too high. Although I liked this dish, I didn't think it was anything special. It took a bit of time and effort to prepare (and used a lot of pots/pans/plus the blender) so I wouldn't make it again, it just wasn't worth it.

I've made this dish twice for my friends and family. Both times were a hit. Added a jalepeno pepper and some wine along with the water to give it a little more kick.

This was great! I only had 1 1/2# of shrimp, so I had a lot of sauce which is excellent! I put a couple of serrano peppers in it, next time I will try it with some lime juice.

I tried the recipe just as printed but had leftovers and reheated them the next day. The dish was MUCH better reheated. The shrimp taste permeated the sauce. Next time I'll make this in advance. Those enjoying a spicy dish should heed other reviewers' advice about using different peppers or adding hot sauce, as the dish is mild. I used the leftover shrimp in wraps with mango. The extra sauce can be added to pork or chicken for creative warm-overs. Four forks for versatility.

I thought it was really good. I have never had tomatillos but thought they were great. I also used the wrong peppers so it was pretty mild. Still good though. I also didn't strain like the recipe said to. It was really good and a nice change of pace.

I love it hot, so I substituted the 1 jalepeno for the pablanos and added about 1/4 cup fabulous dry white wine while I was reducing the sauce. Rave reviews! I served the shrimp by itself on the plate over cilantro sauce for presentation w/ crusted whole grain bread toasted. Mixed green salad on the side, YUM!

Great, served it at a brunch and everyone loved it.

I love cilantro so I had to try this one. The second time I made it I added half a small white onion to the sauce plus I used 1 jalapeno chili in place of a poblano. I also substituted lime juice for the water. This took care of the blandness. A little more salt and a few turns of fresh black pepper punched it up as well. I didn't strain it either and it turned out just fine.

DELIGHTED to find this recipe listed here! After having tasted it at Sol Azteca, I have been trying to replicate it. I was fairly close but used jalapenos instead of poblanos. It definitely needs to be poblanos which adds a more mellow spicyness. Although I was only cooking for two, I made the full amount of sauce which I intend to try over fish or chicken breasts. A delicious dish for cilantro lovers!

Excellent. I cut back on the Poblanos by a 1/4 lb. and added a 1/4 lb. of serranos. I used jumbo shrimp and beleive large shrimp are important in this dish.

Just made this, it was very good. I didn't love the cilantro sauce until it was combined with the butter and garlic to cook the shrimp. At that point I thought it was an excellent sauce (butter is a good thing!) I liked it very much, three forks!

My kids and I really enjoyed this! However, I made a funny error. I was at a farmer's market and bought a basket of what I thought were small fiery peppers. Oops. They were small, sweet peppers! Pays to ask, I guess. I decided to forge ahead with this dish and use the sweet peppers in place of the spicy ones required. The results were fantastic, but, seeing as I like spicy, I will definitely make this again and maybe do 1/2 sweet peppers and 1/2 spicy peppers. I served this with jasmine rice and steamed broccoli A definite "keeper."

This was fairly simple and really delicious. I've noticed that the heat of poblanos varies quite a bit--sometimes they're quite hot and other times mild--no idea why. Still, not all Mexican food is spicy and this is a great example of a milder but tasty dish. It would be easy to add some serranos for those addicted to the burn.

THANK YOU FOR GETTING THIS RECIPE!!!!It is exactly like being at Sol Azteca. For anyone who hasn't eaten this at the restaurant, it is a mild dish. But it is served with spicy refried black beans, spanish rice, & a purple cabbage slaw w/cilantro & lime. It also comes with lime wedges. Without these side dishes it is mild, but oh so worth making it! Thanks again!

I agree... this was okay but not exceptional. Needed more heat, more salt, more depth. I added a splash of beer during the cooking process - that seemed to spark it up a bit -but on the whole, I'd much rather have just plain ol' garlic shrimp.

we thought this was blah. easy enough, but no depth, no pizazz. if you give it a try, have on hand some fresh lime wedges and addtl fresh cilantro for garnish. we used both and they made a vast improvement, salvaging the meal. perhaps roasting the chiles, or adding a bit of a spicy pepper would help? also needed more salt.
