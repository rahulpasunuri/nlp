I altered this recipe to a different level, after reading the reviews. I made mashed potato's instead of baking them, made the beef accordingly, and then I made the sauce with just the yogurt and garlic paste, then added the meat and sauce to the mashed potato's. Next time I will do it differently by putting the mashed potato to a roasting pan and add a layer of pita split in two on top, then add the yogurt that the garlic was marinated in it for at least two hours (if not marinated the garlic will turn green) on top and bake for 30 minutes. What happens to the pita is that it thickens up and makes like a bachemal sauce on top.This idea was adopted from my mother in law who grew up in Cairo so it will make the recipe Egyptian :)

I've been making this for years and really like it. I also use either ground lamb or ground pork and think that both are very good. It's easy to make and a nice change from usual meat and potatoes recipes. Kids really like it,too. Try it!

I wasn't too impressed with this dish. The potato skin was quite dry, perhaps I should have sprinkled some water over the baking sheet. The yogurt sauce was a bit starchy due to the cornstarch. I should have used Greek yogurt (10% fat) and an egg yolk to stabilize it. However, the overall flavours were good, I liked the walnuts and the cinnamon.

I wasn't too impressed with it. I thought the potato skin was too dry, perhaps a little water should have been sprinkled on the baking sheet. And the yogurt had a bit of a starchy flavour, I suppose I should have used Greek yogurt with 10% fat and some egg yolk whisked through to stabilize it. Apart from that the overall flavour was good, I liked the walnuts and cinnamon. I'll probably try it again.

instead of wisking, which can break the sauce, try folding continualy as it heats through.

I find it hard to believe anyone cannot like the cinnamon and beef flavors together, and the yogurt sauce just adds! I do have to say though...that this does not make a particularly pretty presentation...(I had the same problem with the yogurt separating) and when you serve it kind of looks a little odd...definitely could use a special garnish! Will make again, when I do not have small kids at the table.

to the "cook" from reensboro - these are classic lebanese flavors - just because they don't appeal to you and yours does not mean they should not be "mixed" - cooking is an adventure.

My husband and I really enjoyed this. I added fresh ginger in w/ the onions and added the seasonings (plus cumin)to the meat while it was cooking. I also mixed fat-free yogurt and fat-free sour cream for the sauce. I substitued water chestnuts for the walnuts. Quite tasty!

Unlike the other reviewer, my husband and I liked this dish - and I will make it again. I think if you like cinnamon and beef together, you'll like this - and the walnuts add nice crunch. Would have given it four forks, but the yogurt sauce separated - still tasted good, just didn't look pretty. Next time I'll add salt and pepper to the filling.

Really did not care for this flavor combination. No one in my family was able to finish. Everyone said that just because you can mix any flavors, that doesn't mean you should.
