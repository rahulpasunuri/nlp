I was surprised by this tart. I actually didn't get around to trying it until 2 days after I served it, so the syrup had all soaked into the tart. At first bite I thought the crust was too sweet, and didn't expect to like it, but then everything came together, and wow...it was delicious! I'll definitely make again.

lovely base recipe...which, i modified and had amazingly insane results. Used 1 cup of flour with 1/2 cup of almond meal instead of the 1-1/2 c flour. Allowed the dough to rest in cool space while preparing the fruit mixture and was ready to be rolled out without issue as directed. Added a little almond meal and tbsp of pear wine to the fruit mixture of baby Bosc pears and allowed them to sit in cool place while i rolled out the dough... and topped off the final beautiful assembly with slivered almonds and pearl sugar...the result was far from disappointing. the crust was delicate and flavorful with the fruit just a little wet - but, nice as it cooled off. while the syrup made the mouth water for more. and yes, reheats nicely...serve with vanilla ice cream and enjoy! i bake often and find i rarely go by the book. the kitchen is a place to follow one's instincts. have since remade it with apples and calvados...genius + delicious as well.

made this exactly as per recipe, except with luscious ripe La France pears, and was disappointed for having "wasted" the beautiful pears and and late harvest Riesling on it. The pastry was cloying (the one in the Epicurious recipe for Fig and Raspberry Galette is much flakier), and the sauce lost most of the Riesling taste by reducing so much. Would have much rather made the tart with the galette crust and drunk the wine as a side!

Crust was a bit difficult to work with but the taste was well worth the effort. Used a dessert moscato from Costco (Eos) and it was delicious. Next time may add cranberries or raisins.

I did a trial run on this recipe before taking it to a dinner, and my husband and I loved it! The only thing I changed was the crust recipe. Because it seemed pretty dry, I added an extra tablesppon of Riesling (which I think gave it more flavor) and an extra egg yolk. I had no problems with it cracking or leaking. It came out beautifully! I do wonder if adding a touch of salt to the pears might bring out the flavor a little more. It also took longer to bake than the recipe says. Very easy and tasty dessert!

I've made this a couple of times and the exact recipe works very well for me. That being said, feel free to substitute an inexpensive dry white wine for the late-harvest Riesling. My other suggestion is to ensure that whatever variety of pears you use, ensure they are ripe.

My husband and I made this for a dinner party last night and the reviews were fabulous! People were still complimenting us today. I was surprised and delighted to learn how much people loved this tart because it looked a little palid and unexceptional when we took it out of the oven. The reisling sauce does not thicken much, even after boiling for 20 minutes, but it is delicious. I sprinkled dried cranberries on top of the pears just to add a little color.

Really delicious as is. I left the skins on and it added a nice texture.

I've made this recipe twice to RAVE reviews. Seriously, my guests freaked out over it! The first time I made it I accidentally dumped the whole 1/2 cup of sugar in with the pears and then tried to scoop most of it out but the pears were totally covered. I was worried it would taste horribly sweet and it was sugary, but surprisingly it wasn't inediblein fact, everyone loved it. The second time I only put the T of sugar with the pears and it was perfect. A huge winner and SUPER easy. I will make this again and again!

I was first served this tart at a day-after-Thanksgiving dinner and couldn't wait have it again. It has turned out well each time, but I do think that it's difficult to time the ripeness of pears to coincide with a dinner party. The reserved syrup is nice over ice cream.

Very nice dish, and not too heavy after a big Thanksgiving meal!. I made the tart shell with whole wheat and it was just lovely. Terrific with a little vanilla fro-yo.

This tart was a great hit. I agree with the previous reviews that it and the syrup needed to be cooked longer--I found that it took a little more than 60 minutes to achieve the golden brown color for the tart and the syrup took about 20 minutes. I used Montbazillac wine and it was delicious. For some additional taste, I added cardamom. Everyone loved the tart, especially the crust.

I like this recipe because it's SIMPLE. The folks that think this has no flavor,all I can say is,It's not apple pie. pears have a lighter flavor.although I don't use as much syrup as called for,my guests rave about this tart.I will also confess,i've used a jiffy pie crust more often than not w/ great results.a pinch more flour and atouch less syrup should help with leakage.no raisin either!

I used dessert muscato wine instead. I loved the crust for this recipe. It was flaky and just right. Super simple to make in the food processor. To condense the syrup actually took closer to 20 minutes at medium-high to high temperature. Thankfully, I only used about 3 tablespoons of the syrup on top of the pears during the baking time, as I could see it was already full with juice. Mine cooked in exactly 40 minutes. After the 40 minutes, I did, however, put it under the broiler for less than 5 minutes, wrapping the outer crust portion with foil to protect it from buring. That gave it the needed golden color. I served this with vanilla ice cream. I'd definitely make this again. However, I might soak some raisins in the wine first and add about a 1/4 cup next time.

I wasn't thrilled with this tart. I found the crust cracked when I folded it over and the syrup totally leaked out during baking and the result was that the tart had little taste. If I did make it again I would add a little shortening to the crust for stability and use far less wine.

I used a muscat (less expensive but just as sweet) instead of the late-harvest riesling. I also added double the pears required and added more cinnamon. The reserve syrup was unnecessary as the tart was sufficiently moist post-baking.

I made this tart for Thanksgiving and everyone really enjoyed it. I used some of the suggestions made by other reviewers and added some changes of my own: to the pears I added a tablespoon of the Reisling, a tablespoon of brown sugar (instead of white), along with a teaspoon of vanilla and pinch of cloves and let them sit for about 20 minutes. I think this really enhanced the flavor of the pears. I also like a sweeter crust so I added an extra tablespoon of sugar and pinch of nutmeg to the flour mixture.

The pastry was easy to make but a chore to roll out and the edges tended to break when wrapped around the fruit. The pears were bland on their own so I spiced them up with a sprinkling of ground cloves. The reisling syrup leaked out of the pastry case so I would suggest 1-2tbls only. Finally, the cooking time was inadequate, I needed to cook my tart for over 60mins. I served this to 8 people who felt that the tart was so-so but really loved the richness of the pastry

Ithought the tart was delicious however, I adjust the recipe somewhat. When cooking down wine,sugar and water I added 1/4 tsp vanilla paste and a piece of cinammon taste was great. I did find the dough a little difficult to roll but managed. I have made many variations of this type of tart all have been great. Will add this to my recipe collection.

I am trying to find the recipe for the Carmelized upside-down pear tart you are spaeking of and cannot find it. Does anyone know what issue/month/date/year? Thanks!

I made this last weekend for an dinner at friends. Everyone was polite but I could tell no one was thrilled. I thought it was just ok myself. I usually make the Carmelized Upside Down Pear tart also found on this site whenver pears are in season. This always get raves. I add crystallized ginger to carmel mixture. Once when I had to make 5 of them for neighborhood bake sale I used ready made pie crust dough from my local bakery and they were still yummy. They were the first things to sell out!

Made this dish last night. It was easy to prepare and very quick. Although I might add some cinnamon next time because the pears were a tad bland. I will also bake it a bit longer than the 40 minutes because the color was a tad pale. Excellent though!

This recipe merits 4 forks for the wonderful flavor combination of pear and late-harvest wine and the flaky, delicious crust. But, I found that it needs several major modifications to turn out as something worth eating. First, it needs more fruit. I used 6 Anjou pears instead of the 3 called for. Three would have cooked down to almost nothing and resulted in a concave tart dominated by crust. My tart using 2x as much fruit ended up the same height as the one in Bon Appetit's picture...hmmmm. Second, the syrup drizzled over the tart during baking is problematic. Almost 100% of it leaked out of the bottom of the crust, creating a sticky, caramelized mess. Because of the leakage the syrup added almost nothing to the flavor, so next time I'd either omit it completely or reduce it to 1-2 TB before adding. Finally, the cooking time is insufficient. After the 40 minutes called for in the recipe, the crust was pale and undercooked. I ended up cooking my tart for slightly over an hour to obtain the golden-brown color in the photo.

This tart was easy to make and very pretty....made the dough in the food processor. Didn't have reisling, so I added a splash of port to the dough instead. I used Bartlett pears, cinamon, and again, a bit of port in the filling...no boiling. The crust is very tender and rich. Great dessert for entertaining.
