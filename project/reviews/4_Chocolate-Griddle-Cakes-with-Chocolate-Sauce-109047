These were delightful even with the changes I made. I reduced the sugar to half a cup and the flour to 1 cup based on other reviews and kept everything else the same. I will make them again. Easy and fun.

Rich and decadent Sunday brunch. I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup, used 3 separated eggs and beat the egg whites for extra fluffiness. Next time I might try thinning the batter a bit more; as it is I probably used more than 1 cup of buttermilk. Served with berries and a thin layer of ganache. Yummmmmmmm!

Amazing! I reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup (because they were for breakfast) and the oil to 2 tablespoons, and they still turned out great. I, too, did not feel the need for the chocolate sauce. Definitely a keeper!

Delicious! Fixed for Valentine's Day for my kids sleepover. Did not do the chocolate syrup, instead just added some whipped cream. Yummy! Substituted applesauce for the vegetable oil.

Yummy! I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used 1/2&1/2, I think it would have been better w/ buttermilk. I also did not make the chocolate suace, but instead made a fresh raspberry puree and whipped cream. Good Gracious these were decadent.

I did not make the sauce but the griddle cakes were very good.

These turn out great. I've made the recipe multiple times for my family. Since I tend to make it as a weekend brunch, I leave out the chocolate sauce and instead serve it with fresh berries. The batter is a bit thick. I agree with the review that said to cook them slowly over a low/medium heat and watch carefully.

We actually prepare this dish in a waffle iron which makes a very nice presentation. Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and fresh berries, it makes a very elegant desert! It is always a hit at our house.

Oooh, chocolate cake with ganache for breakfast! Although I love chocolate, I omitted the sauce and served with berries. I also substituted applesauce for the oil. We loved these!

These were very good, although I also did not make the sauce (not a chocolate fan as it is). I would heat up one for breakfast and spread some peanut butter on it, very yummy. I would probably not use 1/4 cup of batter the next time - they are very large, and if you're counting calories you can only eat about one. Using less batter, you can make smaller ones and trick yourself into believing you're eating more.

I thought this was very good. I substituted Splenda for the sugar and I used about 1/4 cup less. Still quite sweet. I also used ground up Somersweet Chocolate Bars for the bittersweet chocolate and it worked well. Hubby couldn't tell the difference. I do wonder why there is no baking powder, just baking soda. Most pancake recipes include both. They did rise so that wasn't a problem. These were delicious. A great way to start the day.

I will make again my way. Can't eat wheat, so substituted oatmeal flour. Also like Chocolate Mocha by Ghirardelli instead Dutch cocoa. Added 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon. Served with fruited yogurt. Yumm!!!

Didn't make the sauce (I like chocolate but that would've been overkill). The pancakes, however, were excellent and a nice twist on the everyday plain ones.

Big hit at our New Year's Brunch. Best of all, the pancakes froze well and were a VERY filling breakfast a week or two later. The sauce recipe, however, makes more than enough sauce. I still have some left over.

The first thing you have to realize about this recipe is that it's not for everyone. The cakes (and sauce) are supremely chocolate-y. If that makes you weak in the knees, then go ahead and make a big batch. If that makes you feel ill, don't make them. I think most people would prefer them as a brunch or dessert item, but I actually make them for breakfast. This will probably get me thrown off this board, but I usually don't make the chocolate sauce included here - instead, we pour a little Hershey's syrup on them. It's just easier and a lot less fattening. I know, a travesty...

Very chocolaty, very easy and very good! I didn't use the chocolate sauce but, for next time, I think I will prepare a creme anglaise, which may balance the strong chocolate flavor better.

I read the reviews and went w/ adding the cognac and also used berries on the side, YUMMY!! Thank you.

We used Valrhona 70% bitter dark chocolate which made the recipe densely bitter. Thick batter made cooking difficult; recommend low temp and long duration to avoid charring. Weight and consistency is definitely closer to cake than a traditional pancake, as the name implies. In our opinion, definitely more of a dessert dish than brunch entree.

Just a great desert or brunch dish. Enjoy, MOM

Oh My chocolate heaven!! As a serious chocophile, this dessert went straight to 4 forks! I added a little bit of cognac in the sauce, and served with rasberries & blueberries on the side... My guests loved it! As absolute Christmas "new-classic"!!
