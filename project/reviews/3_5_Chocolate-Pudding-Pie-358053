This is quick, easy, and relatively healthy (low sugar, no eggs). I used 2% milk. It's great as pudding too, just skip crust & pour into ramekins.

I made this for a friend who loves chocolate pudding..he adored it! I thought it was incredibly easy to make, and incredibly rich to eat. Just a little sliver did it for me!
