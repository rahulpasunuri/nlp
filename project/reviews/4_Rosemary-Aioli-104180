This Aioli is wonderful. The only thing I would do different is add a little less balsamic, espeically if you are using a homemade may to start. For a softer taste you can eliminate the balsamic all together.

As a topping for the portobello bruschetta (with rosemary aioli) this stuffs the best! I can imagine all the other great uses for this. Definitely will make many times.

Made this for Memorial day to go on grilled burgers. A word of warning: when I tasted it as I was making it, the raw garlic was so overwhelming I started over using only one garlic clove. Once I got it on the burgers however it really didn't stand up. I missed those two other garlic cloves. I'll also use white balsamic vinegar and more rosemary next time.

This is quite good. I added a bit more lemon juice. I also made my own mayo (3/4 cup canola oil, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp dry mustard, one egg - blend all but oil in Food Processor and drizzle oil through feed tube until mixed well).

Love it! I'm not opposed to taking a few shortcuts and starting with mayonnaise (instead of raw egg) makes this easy and quick. I use it as a dipping sauce for roasted potatoes. Gets rave reviews every time!

Excellent aioli. For delicate foods such as grilled asparagus, I use a toned-down version using more lemon juice and less basalmic vinegar and rosemary.

I'd give this more forks if I could. Fantastic taste - better than the Tapas restaurant's Aioli! I used more garlic and white balsamic. This was a hit and couldn't be easier!

This is a delicious addition to the bruschetta recipe. I did have it on sandwiches for several days! I wouldn't change anything about it!

it's almost unfortunate how delicious this is. I made it for the portobello bruschetta and had quite a bit left over, but it didn't last for very long! my housemates and I ate it on everything from sandwiches to breadsticks.

Yummy, yummy aioli. Used rosemary from the garden. Spread it on ciabatta bread for grilled chicken sandwiches with provolone, kalamata olives, and roasted red pepper. Very good meal. Also spread it on grilled tuna with delicious results.

I've made this for a Bastille Day party tomorrow as an option to the "true"(sic: raw egg yolk) aioli. It's far easier to prepare and I think it's delicious!!

Great flavor, increased garlic for the garlic lovers. Made once with balsamic.. gave a muddy color. Would use white balsamic next time. Made once w/o balsamic and it was very good, but better with balsamic.

This is excellent, especially on the Portobello Bruschetta appetiser. I made it in the morning so the flavors could mingle. I didn't change a thing in the recipe. There was quite a lot left over for a turkey sandwhich the next day. The appetiser was a huge hit too.
