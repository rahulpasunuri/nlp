this is more work than necessary to make a yummy rice + lentils + caramelized onions dish (mujadara). i would skip the layering/baking/inverting steps and just mix the onions into the rice and lentils, and serve. another variation is to add the onions (after caramelized; all of them, or just part) to the lentils as they're cooking, so that the flavor of the onion permeates the lentils a bit more.

This was OK, there are much better recipes for lentils and rice.

Great recipe. I have made it several times adding chopped tofu to increase protein. I enjoy the delicate flavors. Will continue to make it.

This needs a souce or something. Somebody suggested sour cream and diced tomatoes. Sound good. Will try that next time. I will also look for an Indian sauce of some kind. Maybe sothing with yogart and cucumber? I like it spicier then the whole spices will make it; so I added a bit of ground allspice and cardemum. It worked very well. Next time, I will also add more lentils in proportions to rice. Now, the lentils almost got lost.

The secret to basmati rice is SOAKING. Basmati rice needs to pre-soak in water in order to fully expand. Here's what to do for any recipe in which basmati rice is used: Clean rice first. Even if the package says "pre-washed, needs no washing", ignore it. Rinse the rice in a large bowl, filling the bowl with water and rubbing rice between your fingers. Dump water, and refill, rub, and discard water. Do this for at least 9 rinses. Next, drain rice. Place in bowl and add twice as much water. For instance, 1 cup rice, use 2 cups water. 3/4 cup rice, use 1 1/2 cups water. Let rice soak for 30 minutes. Next, drain rice carefully, saving the soaking water. Use rice in recipe, but use the soaking water to cook it in, or in place of liquid the recipe calls for. I have tried to use the same quantity of fresh water as the amount left over after soaking, but the results were not the same. My best results came with using the soaking water.

I liked this recipe well enough to make it again. I did not follow the recipe this time but will next time. I only used one onion this time because it was all I had but will use the correct amount next time. I also used Calrose rice and it was not mushy but a bit too dry so next time I will try to keep it a bit on the moist side.

I've often had a dish similar to this at a deli, and looked for a recipe for this seemingly simple dish for a long time. This one is listed as being "Indian" but the one I was looking for is Syrian. It's called "mujadara," "mojadara," and "emjaddara," in various places. Anyway, this recipe really is too much work and the rice does come out mushy. I now follow a recipe from "The Brooklyn Cookbook" by Lyn Stallwroth and Rod Kennedy Jr. (published by Alfred A. Knopf, NY, 1991). In it you carmelize 2 onions in up to 1/2 c olive oil (I don't use that much). Cook 1 c lentils until they're 3/4 done in 4 c water w/2 t salt, then add 3/4 c long-grain rice (you don't need basmati). Cook until the rice is done. Transfer the rice/lentils to a platter, spoon the onion on top, and top with plain yogurt or a salad of diced tomato/cucumber/parsley in lime juice. Simple and yummy.

I made this dish as one of five main coures for a catered brunch to serve 100. I substituted the butter for olive oil so it could serve as a vegan alternative. Not only is this recipe delicious, it is an inexpensive, quick, and easy way to feed a big crowd. I like garnish it with bay leaves.

Tasty but a lot of work for basically just basmati rice with onions. I served it as a side dish, it doesn't have enough oomph for a main. I may borrow the lentil idea but simplify.

My only complaint was that the rice did not turn out fluffy and dry like at Indian restaurants. Otherwise, it was delicious and would compliment any Indian-style meat dish.
