We've made this three times now and it always gets rave reviews. The recipe makes more dressing than you need, so use good judgment and don't overdress. Twice we've used leftover olive mixes that we've made for hors d'oeuvres and ground that up in the food processor to make our own "tapenade".

We loved this salad! The special croutons and the pine nuts really make for a special treat. Two of us gobbled up the entire thing, but it is definitely enough for four. We weren't sure if the Belgian endive was imagined to be larger than ours usually are (about 1" by 4"), so we used 4 heads. We didn't need all the salad dressing.

I enjoyed this dressing. I tossed it with some field greens,croutons, and feta cheese. The dressing reminded me of a dressing I had at Macaroni Grill a few years ago.

Great dressing! I used romaine and baby spinach instead of endive.

Very simple and tasty vinaigrette. The parmesan is a nice touch. I used mixed spring greens instead (curly lettuce, radiccio, dandelion, etc).
