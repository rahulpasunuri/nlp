This was more like barbecue salsa than barbecue sauce. The end product is very dependent on the quality of the stock.

Wonderful sauce. Had to sub yellow onion for shallot, about 1 Tblsp tom paste (thanks to comments!) for tomatoes & last but not least, 2 Tblsp brown sugar for dates. Next time will do the dates. Simmered for hours rather than boil. Poured over beer can bbq chicken after off the grill (try it-fantastic!). Next time will make more.

made this barbecue sauce without the dates, and added some tomato paste to thicken it up a bit. also added some Frank's RedHot to spice it up.... delicious! if you like your barbecue a bit sweeter adding honey is good as well.

I knew it would be good coming from Magnolia Grill, but wow! It was fantastic. You can make it even better by adding a tablespoon of Worcestershire's sauce. I've also made it without the dates and it's still great.

Delicious. It takes a while to reduce, though. Subbing a tablespoon of tomato paste for the chopped tomato might save a couple of minutes.

We love this and make it often. I usually make two or more batches in advance and freeze it. Foolproof and delicious!

Since we barbeque all summer in this neck of the woods, I am forever searching for new sauce recipes. This sauce went together in a matter of minutes, and was a great solution for that jar of molasses that had been sitting in my pantry since the beginning of time! This barbeque sauce is savory, spicy, and sweet all at once, and was raved by all. We ran out and needed to make a second batch. My husband (who should never quit his day job!) volunteered to make the sauce AND follow the recipe. He accidently substituted pure maple syrup for the molasses, and the sauce was phenomenal. We'll use both recipes often in the future.
