I made this to go with a vegetarian tagine for Christmas Eve and it was a hit. Dough hooks didn't work to cut the fat in, so I used a pastry cutter, and then the dough tried to climb my hooks when I added the wet ingredients, so beat by hand. I followed pizzabaker's suggestion to dock the dough and I slightly underbaked it so it wasn't too crispy and it came out lovely and chewy.

It was easy to make. I would suggest docking the bread before baking so large bubbles don't form.
