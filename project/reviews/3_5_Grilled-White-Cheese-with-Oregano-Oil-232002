It was just ok. I had to forgo the skewers as the cheese (Haloumi) was too dry and started to split.

I have had this grilled white cheese on the beaches in Rio and was trying to figure out how to replicate it when I saw this recipe. It's perfect! This is such a delicious appetizer or light evening snack. Goes great with light beer.

I have fried Haloumi many times in olive oil and love it. Try adding a squeeze of fresh lime to the cheese once it is fried/grilled. Wonderful!

We could not actually find Haloumi cheese but in our selection of grocery stores we did find frying cheese. My husband researched what he could and found the only difference to be that Haloumi cheese is made with mint and the other is not so for those of you who could not find Haloumi cheese try searching for the frying variety. To make up for the lack of mint in the cheese, we made our cold water soak by first boiling some fresh crumbled mint in the water. Next time I will also either use fresh oregano or leave it out all together.

I didn't make this because I can't find Haloumi cheese. Since I am unfamiliar with it I don't know what to substitute.Is it strong or mild, dense or soft,etc.? Help please.

I made this recipe on a grill pan on top of the stove using the Haloumi cheese. When I tried to put the skewer into the cheese it split apart so I just grilled the chunks on the grill pan and served them with tooth picks. The cheese had nice grill marks and the cheese had a crispy outside and creamy inside. After I turned them in the oregano olive oil I felt they needed more flavor so I sprinkled kosher salt and freshly ground pepper over them and then put some fresh chopped oregano on top. I think the fresh oregano and salt and pepper really helped to bring out the flavors. This is a nice, different hors d'oeuvres to serve and easy to do.
