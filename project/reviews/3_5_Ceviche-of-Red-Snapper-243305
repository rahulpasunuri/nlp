Currently in the Grenadine Islands, we headed down to the dock when the village was hailed with the blowing of a conch shell to announce the arrival of the local fishing boat. Magic! We picked out some gorgeous red snapper for cerviche and here were our changes to make this the main course for dinner: -- MOST IMPORTANT!!, only marinate 30min to 1hr only, or else you'll have mush!!! -- double the quantity of lime juice. -- swapped jalapeno for local firey goat pepper. -- skipped the green onion as none avail in this village, same with cilantro (though we would have loved to have added that). -- added about 1/2cup diced celery. -- added about 3/4cup diced, seeded cucumber. -- served on plate of lettuce to make it a filling meal. - garnished with fresh coconut, dry-pan- sauteed with sprinkle of sea salt & sugar. We won't hesitate to make this again while we're here and the snapper is so wonderfully fresh. Brilliant!!!

The ingredients advised here are great- but 8 hours is an absurd time to marinate. Ten minutes is perfect.

Used fresh Halibut. SO GOOD! After the day we had, husband wasn't expecting me to cook; chopped everything up (took me all of 15 minutes) and left it marinating while we put the kids to bed. 45 minutes later, VOILA! Made us feel better instantly! Ate the whole thing between the two of us with avocado and tortilla chips - husband was begging for more! Tonight, I'm trying it with tuna.

Do not leave it for 8 hours!!!!!! Ceviche has to be fresh and it does have something to do with sushi, because its raw fish!!!! the quicker the better and some chefs put a couple of ice cubes to retard the lime action... ceviche is one of the most delicious dishes ever but trust me , it doesnt have to be completely lemon cooked and if the fish was selected properly, (bonito or lenguado,I dont know the names in english:-)) ... if you leave it its going to be awful ... and try to use peruvian yellow chilli or aji limo... and of course lime...

I make ceviche all the time and never use tomatoes, but that is an individual preference. The reason one reviewers fish was mushy was because it sat for too long. If the fish is cut small it only needs about 30 to 45 minutes to become opaque and "cooked". I usually use both lemon and limes in mine and quite a lot. Also, I don't use oil. It is a clean fresh taste without the oil. Yes, mine is more Mexican than Peruvian.

I msut have done something wrong because it turned out with the snapper a limey mush. I thought I followed the recipe almost exactly and waited 8 hours but it all except for the initial taste ended in the garbage. Shame because I ordered fresh whole red snapper. Glad I din't more than one

We made it with cooked shrimp and langostinos, but they can just be added all at once (no need to 'cook' it with the lime for 8 hours). We also added avocado, and replaced the jalapeno with a roasted poblano. Really nice recipe to start off from.

I made this with Hog Snapper and it was fantastic!

Who said it was "Peruvian" but I agree that I've never had ceviche with tomatoes. On the other hand, if you serve ceviche 10 minutes, the ceviche does not have time to "cook" and it would then be more of a sushi dish.

The peruvian ceviche is a very, very fresh and quick dish, made without tomatoes, or avocado (that version is mexican). I held the CIA as great culinary school, please research before you publish.

Please make your research! if you say classical peruvian ceviche it is not with olive oil, avocado and tomatoes! And you cannot put it for 8 hours in the refrigerator! Ceviche is prepare with very fresh fish and no more than 10 minutes ahead.

classical peruvian cebiche..with tomatoes?? NOT REALLY!I thought the recipes displayed in this section were authentic but at least in this case this recipe is not peruvian and much less classical peruvian. Real peruvian ceviche is made with fresh fish, lime juice, aji limo and onions. Usually accompanied of corn or sweet potato.
