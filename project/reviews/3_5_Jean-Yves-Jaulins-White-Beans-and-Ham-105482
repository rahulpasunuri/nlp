In clarification of my rating: This is two forks without the below modifications, and four forks with! 1) After rinsing and sorting, *ALWAYS* soak beans overnight before cooking. (I only use the quick soak method in cooking "emergencies)." PLEASE NOTE: A mis-print in recipe calls a quick soak a "quick-cook" method which has confused some of our fellow cooks. 2) Re: ingredients add to the list/substitute the following: A) Sea salt -substitute with kosher salt. It's *way* cheaper and has a better consistency for cooking. B) Add one small onion C) substitute ham steaks. I mean, I have to say this...ham steaks? REALLY? For flavoring beans? Sacrilege! Use leftover bone-in ham or smoked ham hocks. D) Add the following herbs: 1 bay leaf 1 tsp dried rubbed sage 1 T herbes de provence E) Optional: 1 dash "Liquid Smoke" Prepare basically as instructed. Add onion to shallots, when onion and shallots are almost done (nearly translucent) add herbs and the minced garlic. In answer to a precvious poster's question add the garlic last, as it burns easily. Plan on cooking the beans for at least 2-3 hours. You'll want to pull the bone out when the meat loosens, and remove the bone from the beans, and replace the meat into the beans. if you like it more soupy, add more water (I increased my water by about 50%). ENJOY!

the recipe calls for garlic, but then it seems that it was forgotten in the instructions. i'm guessing that i toss it in with the shallots, but you never know.

Instead of serving a ham slice along side of the beans, I deleated the salt, diced the ham, heated it and added the ham to the beans. Was wonderful and have had many requests for the recipe.

We have been making this for yaers expect we make ours a tad better by adding 2 Cups sour cream and 2 split ham hocks.

For the record, Great Northern beans cook in less than 1 1/2 hours - without any soaking. They just cook faster than other beans.

It's a typo folks, it should say pre-soaked not pre-cooked!!!!

Any time one cooks dried beans, there are 2 methods of soaking. 1. The beans must be soaked overnite, or 2. You can bring them to a boil, cover and let them sit for 1 hour. NOte the latter method is listed in the recipe above. Then after adding the new ingredients, cook the beans for an additional 1 1/2-2 hours to get the beans soft. The recipe tells you to do this additional cooking in Paragraph 2. I have a wonderful Pinto beans recipe I have prepared both ways, but you can't omit the initial soaking using method 1 or 2!

Beans should be soaked overnight in cold water or cooked slowly for 3-4 hours. No way is one hour enough. The recipe is delecious with baked cornbread as a side also.

Jean: Did you read paragraph number 2? It says to cook the beans (after adding them to the shallot/butter mixture) for an hour and a half.

I am in the process of making this recipe now, but I know that the method described for cooking the beans doesn't do it. Anyone who thinks so may be in for a nasty shock in the form of a broken tooth! Covering the beans with cold water, bringing them to a boil and letting them sit for an hour takes the place of soaking them overnight. It does not cook them. You need to drain and replace the water, bring it to a boil and simmer them for an hour. Just thought you might want to check into this. Jean Weston jweston@ptd.net
