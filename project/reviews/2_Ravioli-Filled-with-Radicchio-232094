Wow! I feel like I follow a different recipe than the previous reviewer. I make ravioli once a week/once every other week. This is not my favorite ravioli filling because it's so mild. I can't imagine what the other reviewer did that made it harsh. In any case, if you like to play with homemade pasta, this is definitely worth trying. (Oh--I used a fraction of the butter suggested by the recipe and half the parmesan cheese.)

The filling is extremely bitter and very flat. Also, the pasta does not have any redeming qualities that would overcome the fillings harsh flavor. Without a sauce, this was a very difficult dish to eat but I don't think any sauce could save this recipe! I would never make this again. It was a lot of work for a very objectionable result.
