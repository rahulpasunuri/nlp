This recipe is very similar to an Italian recipe from Aeolian islands, with a sauce made with the Mediterranean flavors: capers, olives (green and black), oregano, San Marzano tomatoes and garlic. Usually this dish is done with penne rigate. The recipe is here: http://www.academiabarilla.com/italian-recipes/sicilia/pasta-with-aeolian-style-sauce.aspx

The recipe is a bit off in several respects. We find that adding more dressing really helps it out. If it dries out overnight in the frige, we just add more olive oil. In general, we like to add more of the ingredients to give it more flavor. Adding lemon juice and feta also really jazzes it up. In this modified format, it's always a crowd pleaser.

Very tasty and healthy but dressing absorbed into pasta and I had to add a bit more olive oil and balsamic vinegar to keep it moist. I used tricolored bowtie pasta.

Loved this recipe. I didn't double the dressing, but I used a 12oz box of rotini whole wheat pasta instead of the full pound. My only complaint is that this wasn't as quick as suggested. It's a lot of chopping, but it's worth it. I would make it a day ahead of time; the leftovers were even better next day. I would also use extra Kalamata olives and extra capers. Warning: The dressing is very thick... but it melts over the pasta and just sort of coats it. It's not a juicy pasta salad, but it's very tasty and it's a pretty dish. My dinner guests loved it, and I'll definitely make it again.

Made with plum tomatoes and fennel that I just collected at our local CSA organic farm. Very disappointing and bland even though I doubled the dressing. And, although I used about 2 1/2 cups of fennel, the fennel taste did not come through. Did not add cheese (I prepared this pasta salad to bring to a kosher meat dinner) but did add some toasted pine nuts and fennel fronds as a garnish. Quite tasteless and not very attractive either.

Not being a big fan of pasta salads, I'm always hesitant to make one. This one is great! The fennel really adds something and I definitely agree to double the dressing. I also added goat cheese once - yum and slices of grilled chicken to serve on the side. This makes a ton of salad. My houseguests raved (one was a vegetarian) and continued to make bowls of the salad the next day.

I, too doubled the dressing using only one garlic clove. The only other change was to throw in some sliced green olives from a hot antipasto mix. A winner! I agree about using the fennel, too.

Have made twice and love it each time. You can play around with the veggie choices, but the fennel does add a difference not found in most pasta salads. Easy for a hot day in Richmond.

Give this a "B" for Bland. I doubled the dressing as one reader advised and threw in the feta, yet it still lacked any real flavor. My family did not rave at all. Have had many better pasta salads with a Med flair. This one won't make it to my box for a repeat attempt.

I felt the undertones of fennel contrac=sted well with acidity of the dressing. I used yellow baby plum tomatos and got raves from my guests!!

I made this for a 4th of July party at my "very Italian" inlaws' house. I added a few drops more of olive oil, only 1 1/4 cups of fennel, about 1/2 cup of italian parsley and a handful of lemon zest to the mixture. It got rave reviews!

The dressing for this is fabulous. The dish comes across a bit bland though without a bit of tweaking. So, first off--make 1.5 to 2 times as much dressing as called for. Second--add some Feta or other goat cheese. Finally--be sure to use fresh tomatoes not canned. And if you do these things it will be marvy!

I normally am not a fan of pasta salads, but this one is really wonderful. The flavors are very subtle and the blend is very delicate. But I agree, the ingredients have to all be of a very high quality for it to work (as with almost all Mediterranean food). Word of advice: Try not to skip the fennel, I think it really makes this dish go above and beyond.

I live in nyc and I love McDonald's. But wowie-zowie - this pasta salad is wonderful! I'm not wild about garlic so I reduced it some. But it is a keeper!

How a recipe that includes tomatoes, capers, olives, fennel, basil, garlic and olive oil can be vile and loathsome is beyond my comprehension unless the quality of these ingredients was not the best. Considering the availability of these ingredients in New York City I find that to be another impossibility. Perhaps some people shouldn't stray too far from McDonalds.

This recipe was awesome! I wasn't sure about the flavor of the ingredients when reading the recipe, but it tasted great. Great taste, wonderful color and even your vegan friends will appreciate it.

Truly loathsome, absolutely vile. Stay away.
