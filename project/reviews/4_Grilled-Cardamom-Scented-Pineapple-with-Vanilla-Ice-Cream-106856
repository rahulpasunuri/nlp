Used dark cane syrup instead of molasses. Several in gourmet dinner group said it was the best desert ever.

Used the glaze on both pineapple and cantaloupe, then drizzled with the Vanilla mint yogurt sauce from another recipe on this site. Very good.

I really, really liked the grilled pineapple. I think the next time I make it I would try to thicken the sauce up even more. It didn't stick to the pinapple as much as I would have liked.

Very unusual and extremely delicious. Instead of vanilla ice cream, I served it with homemade honey ice cream. This dessert works really well with Indian food.
