Good recipe but not my favourite. Liked the recipe from Osterio and from Daniel B. much better. Could not find dried pears so used dried apricots. No prune juice that I could find so used two jars of baby food strained prunes and added water to make 1 cup. There was certainly not enough sauce to boil - but I used the 3 tbsp of flour and the sauce was a good thickness. Didn't freeze sauce, just used a fat separator. Served with squash ravioli and that worked great.

This was delicious. I used a 3 pound boneless chuck roast, trimmed off the fat and cut it into 2 inch chunks. It was tender and wasn't as fatty as short ribs.

This was really delicious and it made a wonderful sauce. Everyone loved it and I was asked for the recipe. Easy to make, too!

I made this for guests who own a restaurant and they went nuts. I made it again for New Year's Eve and people just couldn't stop raving over the flavor. I bought my meat at Cost** and they only had boneless short ribs and that's what I've used both times. It's hard to imagine on the bone could've been much more flavorful. I served it with the Honey Glazed Squash and an apricot & almond couscous (a Tyler Florence recipe) and it was pretty much a perfect menu! Oh, I also mixed cultures and served naan with it - you want to have something to get every drop of the yummy sauce.

Great recipe -- amazing flavor. You can use this sauce to cook chicken, lamb, it all tastes great. I added some additional dried fruit to mine (apricots too) -- and think it tastes better when you don't strain everything out.

Made this on a cold, rainy day and it was a big hit. I didn't have all the ingredients, so made the following substitutions: instead of prune juice, I used pomegranate juice. Couldn't find dried pears, so I used dried apricots instead. Also, I carmelized the onions in a half a bottle of chardonnay, and used beef stock (canned) instead of chicken stock. The sauce was sweet enough that I omitted the honey. I did have to strain it though, as the addition of the flour left lumps! Served with couscous, and everyone raved!

Amazing. Amazing. Amazing.

This was just okay. I just purchased the mid size Emile Henry tagine which is pretty big and the ribs did not fit in my tagine and I only used 12 pieces. Perhaps it will be better tomorrow. My guests didn't seem to like it all that much. It was just okay. I wouldn't make it again.

I've been trying to replicate the short ribs I had at Josie in Santa Monica a while back and this recipe is it. My sauce had just the right sweetness without the honey so I did not add it. The meat literally falls off the bone, really delicious!

This dish was simply amazing. Instead of prune juice I simmered mixed dried fruit (apple/pear/prune/apricot) in some water and added the liquid to the braise. I also forwent adding the flour and it still came out thick and luscious. I also added some toasted almonds which added a nice touch to the dish. Served with couscous. Highly recommended, great for entertaining.

Delicious! I made this in my new Emile Henry tagine and the meat was so tender in just an hour. I really didn't think I was going to like this that much b/c I am usually not a fan or cinnamon in my savory dishes, but wanted to make a tagine in my new tagine. My husband and kids thought it was wonderful. Served with plain couscous and roasted squash with salt and butter. The squash really adds something.

I also removed the flour and used fresh ginger instead of ground. I added chopped dried plums, pears, apples, apricots, and dates for the total amount of dried fruit. For additional complexity and a bit of depth I added 2 tbsp. of tamarind paste. I served it with tagliatelle pasta. The dish was wonderful and I would definitely make it again.

To the cook from NY. 02/17/06; As of November 06 the recipe that you're seeking is back again! I wonder how many people who ask questions on this site actually go back and check for answers!

Tasty short ribs. I used beef stock instead of chicken, doubled the spices, added a bit of cayenne and omitted the flour. Once reduced, the sauce was added back to the meat and served with the squash and couscous. On the squash, I cut back on the oil and added a little orange juice. The squash took about 20 minutes on medium heat. Then glazed with orange marmalade instead of honey(more flavorful). Make sure you salt and pepper generously. The combination of sweet/tart/salt was outstanding with the meat.

I've made this recipe many times and it has been a hit with everyone. You might think some of the spices are odd, but it all works, and works well. It's simply delicious and would recommend it to everyone. And certainly, as good the day after as it is the day it is cooked -- perhaps even better.

Tender, favorful, delicious. Made it for neighborhood holiday dinner. Rave reviews all around.

I made this for friday dinner and it is delicious. I also made the honey glazed squash, substituting acorn for butternut. Easy and good. I couldn't find dried pears at the store, but I did find dried persimmons. (Go figure.:)) They gave it a wonderful rich flavor. It was a little time consuming to do the browning and then the reducing but if you have time, I think it is worth it.

Tested this recipe last night using beef broth and omitted the step to strain the liquids at the end. The flavors were really fabulous, but I agree with Vermont... next time I will omit the flour - makes the consistency of the sauce too gravy like. The onions, pears, and dates cook down to create a great sauce consistency all on their own, and it's a shame to strain them out and lose all those flavors! Served with Couscous made with dried cranberries and slivered almonds, and Moroccan Spiced Roasted Vegetables (found on this site). Wonderful with a dry bold red wine.

i enjoyed this, even though i'm not a rib fan. couldn't find dried pears and the beef ribs up here in canada are harder to find and very expensive so i just used baby back pork ribs and it was just as good.

As with most of the recipes on Epicurious.com, I enjoy reading everyone's comments before I choose a recipe. I wanted to try this recipe to the exact letter - it was soooo delicious. I didn't remove or add anything from the recipe and it worked fantastically. I am going to make this again and try freezing it - I am sure as with most type of casseroles, time will further intensify the end product.

Delicious and simple. As suggested in prior messages, I substituted beef broth for the chicken and doubled the spices. Ran out of allspice so I used garam masala instead. Added red chili flakes and about 1 Tbsp chilpote with the honey for some kick. Definitely a keeper.

Eliminated the flour, reduced broth by 1 cup and upon removing meat from sauce , placed sauce in blender with all the onions and fruit. Gave the sauce a great consistency.

I made this for a NY's Eve dinner for 12 -- for dietary, monetary and availablity reasons I made it with skinless trimmed chicken thighs instead of beef, which also eliminated the defatting step. Otherwise followed the recipe pretty closely except doubled spices (as recommended), added a pinch of red pepper flakes and used pears/prunes and dried cranberries for fruit. Served with cranberry/orange cous cous. Excellent dish. One question -- the recipe seems to advise throwing away all those yummy fruit bits -- why on earth?

This was a rich and delicious dish. I doubled the spices, used beef broth instead of chxn and dried prunes and apricots instead of pears and dates and served it over oven baked polenta. I think the prune juice was the secret to the sauce and plan to use it again for pot roast, stew and any saucy beef dish.

Very delicious, served it with tangerine and olive salad (used baby spinach). morrocan carrots, and Israeli couscous. I used dates and leftover dried cherries, banana chips, and figs for the tangine. I found that boneless ribs are much less fatty than those on the bone. A big hit for company.

I thought this recipie was very nice. flavorful and not to difficult. I made it with the squash and it was enjoyed by my children and my parents a all around hit. I will make it again.

We have already done this one 4 times! The sauce is so rich, thick, dark and flavorfull! Just bought a real tagine dish, looking forward to making it again.

This was somewhat time consuming but not complicated at all. It could have used a little more kick, though--next time I'd use a heavier hand with the spices. It got huge raves from our dinner guests. The recommended presentation with glazed squash worked well, too.

This was excellent. I used dried banana chips because I didn't have dried pears. I also put it back in the oven @ 250 for 1 1/2 hours - after the fat was cooled and the sauce rejoined the meat. I'm not sure if my oven temp is off....but I like the meat to be flaking off the bones and it was'nt so I added the additional cooking time.
