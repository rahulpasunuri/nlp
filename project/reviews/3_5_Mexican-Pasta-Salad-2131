This recipe just didn't work for me as is. I read some of the other reviews and made the following changes: doubled the dressing and added about a 1/4 cup mayonnaise. Added chopped chipotle peppers to taste (quite a bit, actually), took out the carrots and added kidney beans, red pepper, and shredded pepper jack cheese. It then became salvageable. Not sure I would make it again, though.

Very disappointing. I would not make it again. I did use a bit more lime juice to perk it up but it didn't work. I made 1/2 the recipe and used the stated amount of dressing....not flavorful despite the snappy ingredients in the dressing.

I use 2 tablespoons of dijon mustard and 1/2 cup of mayonnaise. I also add a cup of roasted red bell pepper, chopped. I think the carrots add a lot if they are julienned. I use those little grape or cherry tomatoes and cut them into quarters instead of dicing up whole tomatoes. This is a great departure from vinegar-based pasta salads. I showed up with it to a family dinner, and they had never seen a pasta salad like this. It was a hit.

Absolutely wonderful, I suggest that you avoid the corn and carrots, use rinsed canned red beans instead.

I made this for a mexican buffet in the neighborhood. Instead of chicken I thawed a pkg of Carnitas from Trader Joe's - when I left the party, the host and her sister were ladelling the remaining salad into containers to eat later...I guess everyone liked it!

Took this to a pot-luck picnic in new German town; my husband warned me that no one would appreciate the "mexican" flavors, but everyone loved it (including kids!). Did make a few changes: as several others suggested (thank you!!), doubled the dressing (except jalapenos - I will double these too for ourselves, but I think it would have been way too much for this group), added black beans and red bell pepper. I also marinated the shredded chicken in the dressing for 30 mins prior to adding to the pasta and veggies, which helped retain the moisture and intensify the flavors a bit. Definitely a keeper!

I always get rave reviews for this! I made a few small changes: Instead of a whole roasted chicken, I save time by using Perdue Short Cuts Fajita style chicken. I ommit the carrots...not really Mexican, in my opinion, and add some diced avacado and sliced black olives. Also add some garlic powder to the dressing.

Used only 1 very large, nearly seedless tomato (heirloom) and added 2 roasted orange bell peppers. Roasted the corn as well. Doubled the dressing, with the exception of the jalapeno, and added probably 2 tsp of salt. I might add a diced mango next time for sweetness, but the roasted peppers definitely helped with that. VERY tasty!

Bursting with flavor! No leftovers. Will make again and again in the summer.

After I made the dressing I wasn't sure if I was going to like this recipe, but it turned out quite well. The dressing needs to sit a bit to let the flavors meld, particularly the sharp mustard flavor. I still felt it needed something to balance the mustard, so I added 2 T. light mayo and a smashed garlic clove. Like other reviewers, I added black beans. I also added a yellow bell pepper and used a combination of red and orange tomatoes. You will likely get more than 10 servings from the recipe. I halved it and got about 8 servings, not including seconds! I did make the full amount of dressing though, based on comments from previous reviewers, and I needed all of it. All in all, I would make this again. The flavors ended up melding quite nicely.

I used black beans, rather than chicken, for a vegetarian option, and used Jalepeno Jack cheese, finely cubed, instead of Parmesan. It was a great crowd pleaser for a tailgate party.

Made this for a neighborhood bbq. Was delicious and light on a warm summer evening. Added chopped red pepper for extra crunch and used grilled sweet corn (frozen from Trader Joe's) which added a little smoky flavor. I used precooked chicken from TJ's too to save time but think the dish would be made better if the dressing was doubled and the meat was marinated in it beforehand, and then grilled. Don't skimp on the dressing. Nothing worse than dry pasta salad. Will definately keep recipe for good make-ahead summertime fare.

I made this recipe with half the pasta (whole-wheat), added red bell peppers, substituted Vidalia onions for the red onions, and omitted the chicken. We thought it was fabulous & a wonderfully different sort of pasta salad.

Pretty good for a mexican salad. No modifications. Healthy and different.

This turned out well - the guests enjoyed it very much. I took other reviewers advice and doubled the dressing - this was a great suggestion. I would also add a bit more olive oil to coat the pasta. I'm not one to drown my salads in dressing, and even with doubling the dressing, this dish could have used a bit more moisture. I used a roasted chicken from the store, which helped on time.

Just made this dish for a potluck and got rave reviews. Made it with no chicken and added black beans instead (for my vegetarian friends). Bought the already slivered carrots from the store. Made the dressing in a blender (doubled it) and added canola oil instead of olive oil because it refridgerates better. Made a day ahead but didn't add the tomatoes until just before serving. Very, very tasty. My family insisted I make more just for them.

This makes a ton of pasta salad, next time I'll make half. It does get a little dry so I would add extra lime juice. Everyone loved it!

Pretty good, but I was starting to get tired of it toward the end....it makes a bunch! There didn't seem to be enough sauce, so I added some tequila and more lime juice. I also added a bit of crushed red pepper. Very tasty.

I love the flavors of this salad - so unlike your typical pasta salad. When I make it I substitute black beans for the chicken to make it vegetarian, and also usually only make half the recipe because it does make quite a lot. Yummy and fairly healthy too.

This was a good recipe but not great. Added red pepper, olive and doubled the dressing. It is better if the flavors blend overnight. It does make a lot and goes nice with a sumer buffet.

Yuck! It sounded like it would be good from the ingredient list, and ended up just tasting weird. I thought I hated it because I was pregnant, but my husband hated it just as much. This one ended up in the garbage disposal - and like another reviewer said, there was a lot of it left to get rid of!

Quite boring. And the dressing ingredients need some tweaking.

love this salad, I've made is many times over the past few years, and have had many people ask for the recipe. Especially good for pot lucks, can easily be doubled.

We used yellow pepper instead of carrots, and added garlic salt and all of our friends raved about it! It's best to make extra dressing for the salad because it tends to be a little dry without.

I've made this twice now, last summer and just this week. My husband and I didn't care for it much. We took it to work because it makes an awful lot. I'd recommend cutting back on the pasta you add to the salad. Anyhow everyone at work said it was good, so it just must be something we don't like.

I thought it was great. I added a can of black beans as well. It was a hit. I even took the corn, red onion, black beans,chili powder and cumin. Sauted them as directed mixed with cream cheese, baked and used as a dip. Everyone loved it.

This was a great alternative to regular pasta salad. I ended up making twice as much dressing which worked out perfectly.

I also would suggest additional lime juice or perhaps a little more of the dressing mixture. It was certainly enjoyed!

This pasta salad was excellent. It does make a lot! I used more lime juice than called for (about 4 T) and a bit less cilantro. I also added a bit of red pepper as one cook suggested. It was very easy and as a time saver would buy the cooked chicken from the market. Will make again! My family loved it!

I made this pasta salad with stuff that I had in my refigerator and it came out great! I substituted red bell peppers for the carrots. I left out the chicken and used a can of red beans instead. I also left out cilantro because no one here really likes it. I highly recommend this salad, its quick and easy. The amount of jalapenos is a lot so if you don't like it too hot, use less.

Great spin on pasta salad. I left out the chicken and substituted red pepper for the carrot. I served this to friends along with marinated, grilled shrimp and grilled veges and it was a big hit.

Made a modified version of this recipe for a potluck, and was nicely surprised by the blend of flavors. Use ground coriander instead of cumin in the dressing, and add some balsalmic vinegar, garlic powder, and sugar to taste; ditch the chillies, and just use spicy chipotle chilli powder instead (very flavorful and pretty hot); ditch the carrots, using instead 1 green and 1 yellow pepper, chopped; only use 1 red onion and some scallions; add 1 can drained & rinsed black beans; only use 2 T olive oil instead of the large amount listed here; and add some feta, as someone else suggested. I also tossed the shredded chicken w/lemon juice, garlic powder, & chipotle chilli powder before adding it to the salad. Very good--different, not boring, and nicely flavored.

i wanted to serve this as a side dish, so i left out the chicken, then as we were dishing it up at the table i realized i forgot to add the oil to the dressing. it was delicious anyways, through my accident i have discovered a new, now low fat dish that is easy to prepare and good enough for company

This salad was a big hit with everyone I served it to. I left out the chicken and added sliced black olives and crumbled Feta cheese. I also added a half cup of mild salsa - I thought it was a little dry without it.

I really enjoyed this salad. I made it without the chicken and served it with the Southwest Chicken with Ancho-Chile Sauce. I did add ingredients to layer in more flavor: a little mayo, sliced black olives and artichoke hearts. It was more than spicy enough for my taste. If you are making this as a side dish, sonsider halving the recipe because the recipes makes a TON!

It did need a bit more seasoning, I added some cayenne and more lime juice. The best part is that you can leave it out and not worry. Next time I will add some red or green pepper strips too for crunch.

Very mild. After tasting it, I added lots of green Tabasco Sauce. Next time I will use hotter chiles than jalapenos. Also added lots more lime juice.

This is a fabulous recipe. I have been making this pasta salad since it's debute in 1994. Purchasing a supermarket roasted chicken is so easy and convenient. I shred the chicken and chop all the veggies in my food processor to cut down on time. It is a real crowd pleaser.
