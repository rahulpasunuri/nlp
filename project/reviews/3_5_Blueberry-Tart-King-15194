I'm usually a "real crust" baker but this was a refreshing change and fairly easy to work with. I mixed fresh blueberries and blackberries. I used a heart-shaped tart pan with crimped circle cut-out shapes..dusted with powdered sugar and the result looked like more work than it really was. Imagine the interpretations galore with seasonal fruits and various cut- out shpaes!

Has become a summer standard for me since I first read the recipe in 1998. The stars make it perfect for 4th of July, and it's even tastier served with vanilla bean ice cream.

Very easy and quick to make but looks as if it was complicated and time consuming. Even those who didn't like blueberry pie, really enjoyed this tart.
