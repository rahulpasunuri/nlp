This is a delicious light soup. The "toppings" of pancetta and green onions make it that much more delicious. My husband is a big eater and he found that it wasn't quite enough for dinner so this time I am going to serve it with brown rice.

My husband and I thought this soup was delicious! I used bacon instead of pancetta ( about 1/4 pound), which used as the topping would garnish a number of bowls. I didn't use any of the bacon fat to saute the veggies, but olive oil instead. I didn't have an onion, much to my surprise, so I used two shallots. And instead of discarding the garlic, I blended half of the head with the soup. Make sure you pick out all of garlic skins before blending/serving. They come off during cooking.

This was easy to make and delicious. My pancetta was thin (pre-packaged and shaved thinly like proscuitto) and didn't render enough fat to saute my veg. so i added a little olive oil. I was making this quickly just with what was in my cupboard so i skipped the green onions, cream, and vinegar. But I think they would make it really special and won't skip them next time...would bring it from a nice, tasty, every day lentil (yet delicious)-- to something that packs more of a punch. Definitely recommend it for a cosy, healthy dinner.

I followed this recipe exactly except I didn't add the cream and vinegar at the end. I decided to stop right there and it was delicious. I was hesitant because my husband doesn't love things creamy and I was also trying to serve this to my two-year olds (well, they didn't eat it but husband and I loved it). I just had the leftovers and was reminded how good this is. Great lentil soup recipe!

Oh how I loved this soup when I had it at Towne. This recipe is so easy. I cut some of the broth with water when my pancetta seems especially salty. During the colder months this is a once a week staple.

Adjusted a little, used a can of diced tomatoes and, per Nigela, a few tablespoons of mustard. Also added a little caynene pepper and some ham top notch!

Just made this tonight and it was delicious. Followed recipe exactly, except left out the green onions, only because I ran out of steam. It was still wonderful, husband loved it and I am sure to make it again!

I made this soup to eat after a chilly morning at the pumpkin patch and it was warm and flavorful. I made a few changes that didn't hurt it: cutting the broth in half with water to cut that salty taste, and as I couldn't find pancetta I used some ham instead with gave it a lot of meaty flavor. Delish and not to hard.

Here I am, being the rebel w/ this soup. I just made it today, and I really didn't find anything distinctive about it. The bacon and green onion topping was nice, but there are so many other lentil soups out there with some character, I won't make this one again. Now, I will say, that I prefer a soup with some zip -- curry, or some heat, or something that makes it stand out -- a great vegetable combination or wild rice, anything. This soup didn't do it for me.

It is sooo yummy..and as some others I didn't make it exact as i couldn't get pancetta, instead i added ham, and left it in. Delish! I also stretched it by adding water with no ill effects.

Fabulous. I made it w/ just bacon, and without reserving lentils for presentation AND without the scallion garnish and it was still wonderful.

I brought this into work and got rave reviews! Using the pancetta drippings for the sauteing of vegies and bacon left the soup with a great smoky flavor. I followed the recipe as is and was so happy that it didn't require any adjustments.

I made this for the second time this weekend. My boss is a good cook and approved of this one the first time around, even though she is very Eastern with the all of the great family recipes for lentil soup. The trick was getting my husband, who does not care for "beans" (except for Yankee baked) and certainly not the cumin that many lentil soups call for, to try it. Of course the pancetta helps. He did finally induldge me and had a huge bowl. While it is not top on his list he did give it a thumbs up. Perhaps it was the snow and the Patriots big WIN that made him appreciate this hearty soup. I love it! It it so easy, no ham hocks-the pancetta takes care of that. I buy the Lentils du Puy in bulk at Whole Foods Market. One time I cut the garlic head in half and another, I just tossed in huge cloves, but with the same result. Now if I could just get him to try the pea or bean soup...

This recipe is great as is, but when we didn't have pancetta we substituted sweet Italian sausage and it was delicious!

I hated the lentil soup my grandmother fed us as little kids when we arrived at her Connecticut home each November after a very long drive. So, I guess I can thank nostalgia for trying this absolutely fabulous recipe. I made it exactly as written and my husband and I enjoyed every bite. It was comfort food in every sense and for me, brought back wonderful memories of a fabulous woman (who with this one exception was a dynamite cook in her own right.)

This is an excellent, easy to make lentil soup. I use sherry vinegar and cream fraiche instead of whipping cream and white wine vinegar.

Nice texture, nicely balanced flavor.

This is pretty good as far as lentil soups go. I doubled the recipe but used less liquid as I don't like a watery soup. I also didn't puree quite as much of the soup as the recipe called for as we're not used to pureed lentil soup. My Mother never pureed her lentil soups at all but it tastes fine to puree some of it.

This recipe has displace the lentil soup that I've been making for 10+ years. Easy, quick, and delicious.

Delicious! We also left the garlic in the soup. The guest of honor is allergic to vinegar, so we added about 1/4 cup of dry red wine (cabernet). Also, I deglazed the pan with a little dry white wine. Had to make the soup a day in advance - I think it was even better after the flavors had a chance to combine. I was doubtful about the pancetta and green onion garnish, but it was perfect. I never thought a lentil soup could be so good!

this is just lovely. We made this excatly as stated except the garlic fell apart so we minced 4 large cloves and added them. Served to company with a greek salad. Sooo satisfying. We like the fact that there is no more meat in it. Even the texture is perfect. We were afraid it would be too smooth but when pured in the food processor it comes our very nice. Do try this if you like lentils. It is wounderful.
