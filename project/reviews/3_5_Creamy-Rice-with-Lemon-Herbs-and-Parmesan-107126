This is delicious especially served with just about any kind of seafood, but we love it with broiled haddock and wilted spinach. Superb!

One of my favourite standard recipes. Always delicious, no matter what rice you us.

Just made this again last night - we love it! I added the parm this time, it makes this even better. The brown rice was perfectly creamy again. Made it with crab cakes and baby greens with lemon vinaigrette, and enjoyed sparkling wine. GREAT dinner!

This was great. I made it with Lundberg short-grained brown rice, and although it took 50 minutes to cook that, it still turned out creamy. Didn't use the parm, so added a touch more lemon and salt. I paired it with Spicy Sauteed Fish with Olives and Cherry Tomatoes (from epicurious) and a nice fruity Pino Gris (a pairing suggested by my wine guy.)

This had a nice flavor of predominantly lemon, then the onion, and lastly Parmesan. My dish did not end up creamy, but I was also a bit concerned about adding so much water that it turned mushy. A nice variety for rice and I'd make again, but can't say it was a big hit.

This was really enjoyed by my husband and me. I used a short grain rice, but next time I am going to try it with quinoa.

I make this all the time and it is never less than creamy and delicious. A reliable favorite with the kids, too.

This was awesome, easy to do and very yummy. The only thing I found that was stopping me from giving it 4 forks is that Basil can be overpowering. If you can control that, it is very good!

This was a wonderful recipe, and everyone in the family enjoyed it. It is simple to make and very tasty. I've made it many times.

This dish was just so-so. I brought it for Thanksgiving dinner, and barely anybody touched it. I would not make this again! It was mushy too!

This side paired nicely with a strong, flovrful wine-based chicken dish. Creamy and delicate.

I give this one fork because it really was "just so-so". Maybe it's because I used the only rice I had on hand...basmati, instead of a shorter grain rice? I thought the flavors were quite bland. Definitely nothing I would bother cooking for guests. Maybe using chicken broth instead of water and adding some garlic would help, but disregarding other people's tips, this recipe is definitely bland.

Emmmm.. Delicious! I ever ate once a prepackaged ready to use parmesan rice and was soo tasty. I have been since looking for a rice recipe that gives me the same consistency and taste.. here it is found it ! I used brown rice and had to increase the cooking time.. of course with the lid on, as one reviewer noted. I also like the rice to be well done so I made sure of that.. I also used I can't believe it is not butter, to reduce my WW points.. a little disappointing since nothing beats the real butter but, ooh well, I got what I wanted and needed :) I had the rice with a lemony fish dish... emmmmm sooo good... This a simple and quick recipe .. A Keeper

This was terrific and got great reviews from my guests! I will definitely make it again. I used brown rice (which tripled the cooking time) and I added minced garlic with the onion & rice (per a previous review). It's like risotto but so much easier! The lemon gave it great zing. Delicious!

I think this is a wonderful simple recipe. Will definitely be making it again.

I love this recipe.........it is as creamy as risotta that I have spent much time adding liquid and stirring. I will make this again and again.

This was excellent--light and flavorful. Top-quality ingredients are necessary though--maybe other users didn't try it with good parmesan?

Obviously some of the previous cooks have done something to spoil the recipe because when I made it, it was absolutely divine. I used less butter, maybe more lemon juice.

Previous reviewer: what a terrible thing to do to your dog! :-) It's awful. Bland and definitely NOT risotto.

We found this rice to be extremely bland and somewhat greasy tasting. Plain white rice or rice cooked in stock would have been far better for our tastes. We fed it to the dog, and would not make it again.

After cooking the rice for 10 mins., I added chopped white cabbage and frozen spinach - it was excellent!!

On it's own, I would only rate this with 3 forks, however, I served this with the Pan-Baked Lemon Sole with Spinach, Olives and Tomatoes (from epicurious as well). These two dishes were absolutely divine together. A perfect balance of flavors. My husband who is a gourmet food enthusiast and restaurant owner, told me, "Save this recipe!". *The two of them together. I did make a few changes, first of all, be aware, that unless you are making this as a main dish, this makes a HUGE portion! I had even cut it in 1/2 and I have enough left-overs to have a small dinner party! I would cut the recipe in 1/4 th, for a couple, and there would still be leftovers. I have a little bone to pick with the author of this recipe as they did not say to COVER the rice/onion mixture after it was boiling. I did, do so, and apparently that is what you should do as it came out fine. Also, I used about 4 tablespoons more rice then asked for, as I didn't want the dish to end up "runny". This worked out fine. I did use fresh herbs from my garden and follow all other directions EXCEPT-I used a lime instead of lemon, and I omitted the "peel" as I have a huge Happy lime tree in my yard. I do think that pairing this recipe with some sort of tomato/garlic main dish, is what brought this up to a 4 star. Of course, we like robust flavors, so, if you're from England or Scottland, you might prefer it as it is..... :-)

wow! this was delicious. very creamy lemony taste. i omitted the basil and used lots of fresh parsley. served it with bbq'd ribs and sauted green beans. rave reviews all round.

This was easy to make and delicious to eat. I have always been a bit intimidated by risottos and this made creating a similar dish virtually fool proof. The subtle lemon flavor was wonderful as well. Don't skimp on using fresh herbs and do make sure you use the real arborio rice - it's worth it.

I love risotto, but on my diet I am not allowed white starches of any kind. Substituted brown rice for arborio, chicken stock for water, added chopped fresh italian flat leaf parsley and rosemary to the basil...It was wonderful! Served it with broiled scallops and prawns on rosemary skewers. A celebration fit for a king!

A very good and easy recipe. Nice with grilled food.

Very tasty and very quick and easy. I boiled the rice in chicken broth and added minced garlic with the rice and onion. Also used less butter and parmesan. Good for everynight or company.

This dish was an excellent quick and easy alternative to a risotto (which takes a lot of time right before serving). I served it with a Greek stuffed meatloaf (lamb and beef combined with a spinach and feta stuffing) and it was excellent! My company loved it as well. Just start it 20 minutes before you're ready to eat and it is done!

Loved it! It was a refreshing change to plain old rice. Great with grilled Honey-Ginger pork tenderloin.

I quartered this recipe for just my husband and me. It turned out great. I added salt and extra fresh grated parmesan. I had to use dried basil but the flavor was very nice.

Absolutely Delicious! It was simple to make and a great base recipe for creating my own little concoction of spices.I would advise using less water because 4 quarts are not needed.

This was different. It was deffintaly very creamy but it was almost like all the rice molded together and I couldn't taste the texture. The flavor was okay, it tasted cheesy with a bit of lemon flavor in it- so a little different...

Delicious and easy to make. A nice change of pace from regular rice. Will make again!

A real hit at my gourmet club! I added a bit of orange rind as well. It went great with an Asian beef tenderloin and roasted fresh tomatoes!!
