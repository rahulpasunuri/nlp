Mine came out slightly undercooked. Instead of being jiggly in the middle, it was still jiggly everywhere. I left it in the oven and it seemed to fix the problem (I've only tried the firmer of my two pies so far). Unfortunately I didn't know that freeze-dried corn (for the corn powder) was so difficult to come by on the day I made the pie so I omitted it. Will make again...but with corn powder (via the internet, I guess). Still tasty nonetheless though!

I tried Crack Pie at Momofuku Milk Bar this weekend, then made this recipe. I like the way the recipe came out better. The oat crust seemed thicker, which I liked, and it had a little crunch. The only change I made to the recipe was to substitute the milk powder with cornstarch. I don't know how it affects the flavor or texture - it wasn't a discernible difference to me. I thought the milk powder would just give it some body, so I used the cornstarch. I took the suggestions and upped the salt slightly, but not enough to actually taste a saltiness in the pie. it probably just balanced the sweetness a little. This recipe is really a brown sugar and butter delivery system. Yup, that's why they call it crack pie. Texturally and taste wise, I like this better than pecan pie. The oat crust kind of blends into the filling. Not as goopy as pecan pie. Using the freezer, the total prep time was closer to 4 hours, not 15.

I was skeptical given so many of the "too sweet" comments. I'm not usually a fan of super sweet desserts. I can only comment on the filling, as I used a different oatmeal cookie crust recipe that I love that doesn't require the extra work of this recipe. (I compared the crust recipes and they are very similar, a little less sugar in my recipe). But I'm assuming that because of using a different crust, I didn't have the problems with burning or overbaking as noted in many reviews. The filling was sweet, but enjoyable. I made two 5 inch tarts rather than a pie pan (couldn't find my pie pan), and that may have helped. The filling layer was thinner, and balanced by the cookie crust. It was a really interesting flavor and texture - I'd say like a cross between a custard and a barely cooked brownie with a caramelly-like flavor. I would make it again. I'd probably give it 3 1/2 stars

Again, way too sweet! All 3 recipes from this "article" were huge disappointments and tasted nothing like described.

I took a plunge and made this for Thanksgiving. I doubled the recipe and made two fairly thin pies that I had baked in two ceramic tart/flan dishes. After spreading the crust and mixture, I was a little worried that I might have too much crust and too little filling. :( Fortunately, everything worked out great! Many of my guests loved it and even took some of the extra pie home. Personally, I found it to be pretty rich and really sweet. It took some getting used to, but I found that a nice sliver of pie really hits the spot with a cup of strong, hot coffee. Mmm!

The best thing I have ever made!!! We love sweet things in our home, so this was perfect!! After making it a few times, we learned to use a crust cover and the crust turns out fine. This is not for people who can't handle sweet!!! Also is completely different than a pecan pie......not even close!!! Would highly recommend!!!!

Fantastic! so rich and delicious everyone who tried it loved it. I served it with homemade vanilla ice cream. the hardest part was waiting for it to get cold, it tasted so good warm and goey!

My husband and I are now joining a "12 step program" because of this pie! I made it two weeks in a row, we just couldn't get enough! Thanks to the other reviewers, I made a few changes that kept it from being too sweet. I doubled the salt in both the oatmeal cookie and the filling. When making the crust with the crumbled cookie, I omitted the extra Tablespoon and a half of the brown sugar. The ratio to salt/sweet was PERFECT! I also sprayed my pie pan and used a crust shield during the second half of baking. These changes made it one of our favorite pies ever! Oh, it did NOT remind us of pecan pie without the pecans...more of a dulce de leche/caramel thing. DELICIOUS!

This is good - I liked the crust and the flavor. Very sweet - like mainlining sugar but if that is what you are craving that is what you will get! Was trying to think of a good garnish or side - maybe something lemon, like a tart lemon jam? or something with nuts and a little heat? I'd try it again.

I can't attest to crack's addictiveness personally but I can say I am not addicted to this. While it is tasty, I wouldn't call it awful, it could use some crunch to cut the cloying richness (the crust isn't enough). I cut the pie into 16 slices, and even the smallest slice of this makes me feel ill. The whole time I thought it would be so much better with nuts on top (ie. if it was pecan pie). Just not my thing, people ate it and send it was good, but very sweet-- all agreed it wouldn't go in the 'favorites' bin.

I was thrilled with this recipe, it was delicious and super easy to make. I was at first reluctant to make it because of the 15 hour start to finish time but it is really simple and almost all of that time is cooling and refrigeration time. It's not a pretty pie but it is delicious! I don't know why people had difficulty with it. I cooked it as directed. If people have problems with the edges of the crust burning use a cover around them like you would do with any pie. Loved this! Will make it again.

This is truly the most addictive dessert I have ever experienced. Absolutely fantastic. I have made it 3 times now, the last 2 because of requests from friends. Do serve it cold, it really is better.

I really wanted this recipe to be a success, but I have a feeling there is no fixing it without substantial changes. I had trouble getting the filling to set up without burning the crust. After reading the other reviews, here are the changes I made: intentionally undercooked the oat cookie in phase 1 so that it would have a better chance of not burning in phase 2, amped up the salt in the crust for a heightened salty-sweet reaction, threw in some mini chocolate chips for an extra flavor kick, watched the oven like a hawk for the first signs of burning. Results: overcooked crust and undercooked filling. I consider myself a pretty experienced pie baker, but this did not go well! Taste was okay, but not near what I was expecting based on reviews of the "real" crack pie at Milk Bar in NYC. I might try it again with pre-cooking the filling in a saucepan with a little bit of thickener, like corn starch, to help it set up quicker, and I will probably form the cookie batter into a crust-shape and not pre-bake it.

I dont know what happend to the pies some of you all made... but this is the most amazing pie i have ever made! :) came out light bit crunchy creamy smooth salty sweet and perfect! everyones oven is dffernt just keep checking on your crusts and thep pie, the times that they give are only estimates bc everyones oven does heat differently... my oven sometimes needs longer sometimes shorter on different recipes... but i get amazing reviews from friends and family when i make this and make sure i make it for holidays and event even the occasional "thank you" :) good luckk!

This came out great! I was concerned about the reviews mentioning how the crust was burning. I decided to make the cookie batter as described, but I put it directly into the pie pan and baked it at 350 for about 10 min. just to set it. I then filled it with the filling ingredients and baked as directed. The results were great; no burned crust and I was able to skip the step of baking the cookie and crumbling it. It also required less butter since I did away with the final steps of the crust preparation.

Amazing! My husband & I loved this. But I definitely heeded the warnings of other reviewers to watch the pie carefully for burning, and did put a homemade foil pie shield around the edges once the crust looked as dark as I wanted it. I highly recommend this!

I'm not normally a baker but was excited to try this recipe after hearing so much about Crack Pie. To me it was super sweet and lacked the balance of salty sweet that I love. That said, I'll have to try the original next time I'm in NYC. Is it me or am I just a bad baker?

I've made this pie several times, and received nothing but raves every time! I believe that the key is to watch it while it's cooking, and not blindly trust the time/temp of the recipe. I've pulled it out of the oven 20 minutes early if I felt that it was getting too dark, and it still came out perfect. As long as the filling slightly shakes a little bit in the middle, it's done. Sometimes, the crust gets a little dark and it doesn't look that great in the pie pan, but I find that a generous sifting of powdered sugar covers that up very well. I will defintely continue to make this again and again.

Made this for a dinner party and it looked awful in the pie plate but tasted sublime. The crust darkened during baking but I covered it halfway through with a piecrust shield and it was fine. Though it was dark, the crust was not burned. This pie definitely had a nice salty/sweet combination that was universally loved. Definitely will make it again.

I was happy to try this because I had heard so much about it but it must be something better baked in the bakery oven! Filling seemed curdled and not smooth like other reviewers. And crust was burnt tasting.

I've made this pie twice; the first time is was perfect, the second time disgusting. In the first one the filling was very smooth like a custard with about the consistency of a creme brulee or a thick dulce de leche. The second time it seemed like the filling curdled. It was lumpy and greasy and the crust stuck to the pan. Pretty much inedible. For the first pie I was in a hurry so I didn't let the butter cool after melting it and I mixed the cream, eggs and vanilla together before adding them to the sugar-butter mixture. The second time I followed the recipe procedure exactly. I don't know if that made the difference, but if this pie had turned out the first time the way it did the second, I'd be giving it 1 fork instead of 3 right now. The only change I made was to double the salt in the oat cookie crust to amp up the sweet salty factor other reviews mentioned it was lacking. I plan on trying this one more time to see if I can identify the problem.

I have made this 2x now with less than stellar results. It's okay. My pies were much darker. And I agree with others, crust almost seems burnt. I also don't taste the salty sweet, just sweet. Not that impressive overall.

I loved it and so did my guests. I found a lot of truth in the other reviewers comments. It is loaded with butter, sugar, and cream so its not really a "Diet" pie, but lets be honest pie has never really been a diet food. I watched my baking carefully to make sure it didn't burn. And it turned out perfectly. This is in the David Chang style of cooking where you try to activate as many sensations in the mouth at one time as you possibly can. So its sweet, salty, gooey, and crunchy, all in one bite. Several of my guests likened it to a pecan pie without the pecans. I'll add another analogy. For me it was similar to a very dense blondie that still had a slightly gooey center. However you describe it, it is definitely saved to my recipe box, and I am very much looking forward to serving it again.

Mine turned out great! And everyone wanted the recipe. I did not find it anything like pecan pie. When I noticed the crust was getting a bit too dark, I used a pie crust ring to shield it. Watch the color on the first baking, and as a previous reviewer said, there's a reason that people pay $44 for a pie.

What a disappointment. I agree with others, a pecan pie without the pecans, but not as good. Would not make again. The crust stuck to the dish and looked and tasted burned. Emily, a cook in Mich.

Delicious with understated flavors. Brought to a friend's house yesterday and even their 9 and 12 year old children loved it. Would definitely make again -- it's simple flavor is what makes it good. Could complement it with a fun ice cream flavor like dulce de leche or ginger or mint or ?

Wish I could give this zero forks. What a waste of time and ingredients. "Re-baking" an already baked oatmeal cookie just leads to an overdark crust. Agree with the previous reviewer who said there was no salt flavor--it's all sweet, sweet, sweet. It's not even like a good pecan pie without the pecans- -it's just flavorless. Disastrous.

This was good. I initially turned my nose up at it when I saw it in the magazine, but am glad I made it. I won't be making it any time soon though. It is too fattening and WAY too sweet for me - and I am the dessert QUEEN. This dessert is very interesting though, so if you have a few staples and would like to change it up, GO FOR it! It was good! The texture is something between a candy and a pecan pie filling. The crust is just delish!

Took this pie to a church supper & it received rave reviews! That is even after I forgot the cream & had to stir it into the filling in the crust!! I'm making it again tonight, & this time will remember all the ingredients.

This pie was definitely not worth the effort. It's just pecan pie without the pecans; and not as good either. I can't imagine why anyone would pay $44 for a whole pie. Plus, how can you call anything crack when it doesn't have chocolate (imho)!!

It was good, but don't know what the fuss is all about, or why according to some articles I read online, it sells for $44 for a whole pie at the milk bar. It reminded me of gooey butter cake, a St. Louis favorite. I put I would make a again, but really more of a maybe.

As mentioned by other reviewers, it's pecan pie minus the pecans -- although I admit, better. I was expecting the promise of addictive, and I just don't think it lived up. It was good, but I won't make it again.

This is absolutely delicious. But I made it in an aluminum pan and by the time it had cooked for 20 minutes I turned it down to about 340 and then when it was time to turn it down to 325 I only left it in for about 5 minutes. I thought it was ruined but tasted fine although much darker than the recipe. So watch it carefully

As someone who is obsessed with the Crack Pie at Milk Bar, I was so excited to see the recipe in print. But the final result wasn't at all the same. It didn't have the same salty-sweet thing going on...I found the salt to hardly register at all. I'm not sure I'd make it again...I agree with the previous reviewer that it does taste exactly like pecan pie without the pecans (actually exactly what I said to my husband as I tasted this homemade verson). I'd instead recommend the Blueberry and Cream cookies from the same article. They come out exactly like the ones at Milk Bar and were a total hit.

This was AMAZING...!! I agree that it was similar to a pecan pie without the pecans, but I kind of expected that. I used a little more butter than it calls for when mixing the cookie part with the brown sugar for the crust. I also think I overbaked it a little bit (the crust was very brown), but it didn't taste burnt at all. Next time I'll keep a closer eye after turning the temp down on the oven. This is worth the time it takes!!! It will be my go to dessert for my next party!!!

I was underwhelmed by this recipe. I just didn't feel that it lived up to the hype. It was basically like a pecan pie without the pecans. Very sweet, gooey, but it didn't do much for me. I will say that the crust was good on the edge of the pie pan, but the crust underneath just disintegrated into the filling & was soggy. And what's with the 1 Tablespoon of powdered milk? I'm not sure it was really necessary. I bought a box of the powdered milk for 5 bucks (the smallest size available) just for this recipe. Now I guess I'll have to make the milk crumbs for one of the other recipes in the article.

I will reserve rating until I try this recipe a second time. But I suspect that there is a magic color of the first round cookie that will support being recooked once crumbled for the crust. I, apparently, did not start with that magical color. I will endeavor to do better next time. But be forewarned my cooking friends, there is an art to this and that's why they charge $44 per pie.

This pie is so good and it is true, you just can't stop eating it!!!! I can't describe it, but it is gooey and yummy. I don't think I will be making it again soon though, not because it isn't good because I don't trust myself to not eat the whole pie.

EXCELLENT pie. It's a variation of the southern-style chess pie but not as sweet and the inside is more "caramel-y". The salty- sweetness takes people by surprise. Fairly easy to make, be careful on the baking as it may take less time. Most labor-intensive was the crust because you had to make the oatmeal cookie first. And it really does taste better after being refridgerated overnight.
