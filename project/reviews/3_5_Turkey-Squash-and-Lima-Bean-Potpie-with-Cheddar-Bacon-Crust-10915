This turned out pretty well, and my kids loved it. My husband and I thought it tasted good. I made a few minor changes based on what I had on hand. I substituted sweet potatoes for the squash and instead of whole pearl onions, I chopped a 5 oz. onion and sauted it in the butter before making the roux. I also omitted the bacon from the topping. The only problem with this dish for me, was the biscuits (particularly the middle ones) didn't bake all the way through. Next time instead of using a 1.5 qt round baking dish, I plan to use a wider shallower dish, so the topping is not so thick.

This was slightly disappointing. It was easy to prepare, and the crust turned out really well, but it was very bland. I might try it again, maybe with garlic and curry powder, or something to give it a little flavor.

I have used this recipe over the years as a PERFECT cover dish casserole and for holiday leftovers. I have shared this recipe with many friends over the years and it has remained one of my favorite recipes.

This is my favorite use of leftover turkey. EVen my kids liek this recipe. I make biscuits instead of a crust with the topping and that works fine too. I did not think this was an invloved recipe it only takes about 25 minutes of prep time. Helen

This is a involved recipe and takes a while to make, but it looked very good and tasted good, especially the piecrust. Fancy way to get rid of leftover turkey.
