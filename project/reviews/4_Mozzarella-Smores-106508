Followed the recipe, except added garlic to the sun-dried tomato oil and brushed the bread before grilling. Wouldn't do that again, it made the bread too greasy. The taste was good but not the texture. If I make this again, I would make a pesto out of the oil, sun-dried tomato, basil, add some garlic. I would grill the bread without oil, spread the pesto, and then add the hot cheese. I think that would rate 4 forks.

Flavorful and delicious. I topped half baguette (that wasn't grilled) with olive oil, garlic, mozzarella and sun-dried tomatoes. Then I baked in the oven until the cheese melted and topped it with the basil.

This is one of my favorite summer party appetizers. We use our fire pit to roast the chunks of cheese before pulling them off the skewers with the tomatoes and grilled bread. Fresh basil is a must, and my herb garden took quite a beating one night as we pulled fresh leaves off the plants to make more and more s'mores.

What a fun recipe! Had a fire in the fire pit and this was the perfect dish to serve. I soaked BBQ wooden skewers in water for our "sticks". Excellent taste with good campfire fun.

I don't know what I did wrong, but this recipe didn't work at all. The mozzarella simply would not melt or brown, no matter how long we held it over the fire. It just dripped water. I'm so sad, because the recipe looked great!

Simple and delightful twist on traditional bruschetta. Toasting the mozzarella "marshmellows" is a fun addition to the unbeatable basil/olive oil/garlic/tomato flavor combination. Loved it! I couldn't make them fast enough and my friends and I wolfed them down.

I'm the hit of the Jersey Shore, I tell ya! They're rated "100% would make it again". Whattaya got to lose, besides some very happy eaters? Make it. Be happy.

Easy, fun, and delicious. Made this over a fire just like s'mores and everyone loved it!

I don't think I've ever made an appetizer that got more kudos. It's THE PERFECT summer appetizer... easy to prepare, tasty beyond belief, and a real party starter (gathering around the grill)! I brushed the French bread slices with garlic olive oil and toasted them lightly under the broiler. I know that I'm going to make this over and over... as are all the others at the barbeque last night.
