I love this recipe - I always make it exactly as written. I will make it on the weekend and then take it for lunch for the whole week - very light and refreshing.

This salad was a delight: light, refreshing and very tasty even the next day. My only change was to use white balsamic vinegar instead of the white wine in the potato preparation.

This is a really lovely chicken salad. Made it to use up some roast chicken leftovers, and it was very flavorful. Skipped the potatoes and made the chicken for a sandwich filling delish!

We loved the chicken salad and tomato salad, which I made true to the recipe. I thought the potato salad was sort of weird, I wasn't sure I liked the wine with onion combination. But I'll follow the advice of the other commenters and taste it again tomorrow.

Both times I've made this, the people I cooked for wanted to take photos because it is really beautiful on the plate. And it's delicious too! I had a little extra chicken salad which I ate the next day and it is much tastier if you leave it overnight. I added vinegar and garlic to the potato salad the second time because I also thought it was too winey as written.

Yummy. I only made the chicken salad since that's the recipe I wanted (and didn't want to use grapes or celery) and this chicken salad turned out great - the tomatoes and walnuts really added to the flavor. I also mixed in a little low-fat mayo.

i tried all 3 composed salads in the june 'cooking for health' department, and this was the best, a very nice combo of flavors. i wonder if i might like a little lemon juice or vinegar on the potatoes, rather than the 1/2 cup of wine--or less wine. they tasted prettty winey. but overall, this was a good recipe.

I combined the chicken and tomato salad (minus the olives plus a little mayonnaise for consistency)and it was very, very good.

Easy and good. I substituted artichoke hearts for the olives, and added a dash of white wine vinegar to make it tart. Everybody liked it.

I only made the potato salad part. I haven't made the chicken salad yet. But I loved the potato salad. Yesterday when I first made it and it was still warm, it really did nothing for me and I was almost about to throw it out, but today I had some cold and it was really good. It actually tastes like it has mayonnaise in it. The blandness that other reviewers mention might have to do with the wine that is used. I used a chardonnay that is drinkable (about $13.00 a bottle).

My daughter made this salad for us and out-of-town guests over the 4th of July Week-end. I have to disagree with the person who thought the potato salad was too bland. It was very refreshing on a very hot day.

I too left out the potato salad. I substituted roasted pine nuts for the walnuts and added goat cheese instead of the grated cheese....it was wonderful. Got rave reviews from the whole family!!!

Mmmm! Chicken Salad & Tomato Salad is always good. Adjusted the spices to my taste. For a quick variation my mother adds dried cranberries. Very delicious. Great for summer
