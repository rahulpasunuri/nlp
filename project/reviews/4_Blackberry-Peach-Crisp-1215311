Very tasty. I tossed some pecans into the topping b/c I had some to use up, and I think that worked well. Great for breakfast with a dollop of vanilla yogurt.

I used fresh strawberries and peaches and thought it was pretty tasty. The topping wasn't crumbly but it came out great anyway. I can't say this was the most delicious dessert I ever made, but it's an easy way to take advantage of fresh seasonal fruit.

I made this with a 16oz bag of frozen peaches (and no blackberries) since it's March. The frozen peaches weren't terribly sweet, so I gave them a sprinkle of a TB or so of sugar. The topping was great, I found these needed the full 20 minutes to get crispy. A great and nearly guilt-less way to have a satisfying dessert, will definitely make again! Maybe next time with apples and pears.

I made mine with apples and thawed blacberries. The result was quite nice, but I would have preferred to have a crispier/crunchier topping. Maybe next time I'd add almonds or some kind of nut. My husband liked it, but he told me to get his mom's crisp recipe next time... Hahaha...

This is an outstanding recipe, super-easy, fast, healthy, tastes great. My girls didn't like it though, as it's not very sweet. This is definitely a new standard.

Mmm - pretty good! Mine was a bit tart (even without the OJ, which I skipped) but it was still a satisfyingly sweet dessert that didn't have the "health food" feeling!

Yum! I used frozen peaches since there were no fresh to be had and it was still delicious. Worked out to about 3 ramekins (with some topping left over) for me, otherwise they were too sparse. Definitely a keeper. Will look forward to trying other fruit combos.

This recipe is ideal if you are looking for simplicity and love fruit. The peaches seem to be the fruit that makes all the difference, as you can pair it with other fruit that is less sweet and you'll still have your sweet buds satisfied. I altered the recipie by using coarse wholegrain flower and added frozen blueberries instead of fresh blackberries. Next time, I'll put some walnuts in with the flour, which is the only thing I missed. Simple, sweet and healthy.

Very easy to make. I've made it several times using different fruit.

I am always looking for great healthy desserts, and this one is perfect. My boyfriend loved it. I paired it with a great blackberry cabernet sorbet.

For a healthy dessert that isn't loaded with calories, this is very good. I added 1/4 cup of chopped pecans to the topping and a small piece of butter on top of each one before baking. I would make it again and experiment with different fruit.

Easy, delicious and healty. I sprayed some whipped topping on top and it was great. I would definitely make this again. While it won't take your breath away, I would make this again, and I would even make it for company.
