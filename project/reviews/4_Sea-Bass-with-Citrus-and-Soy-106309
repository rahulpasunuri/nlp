Superb. This may have been the BEST fish dish I have ever eaten. Used a rice steamer (top of stove variety) and placed the fish in the top basket. The texture of the fish and moistness was incredible. The fish was rather thick, so I cooked an additional 3 minutes. Did not have pineapple, so used more orange juice.

This sauce is a wonderful compliment to the richness of sea bass. Grilled the sea bass and basted with the sauce then when it was done divided the flakes and drizzled the remaining sauce on it. Can't wait to have it again! Served with sauteed Baby Bok Choy and Ginger Cilantro Rice.

This a delicious recipe. I did a slighty modification: I baked the sea bass with just salt and pepper. And for the sauce, I use some saute shallots. It was awesome! My friends still talking about it....

This was a fantastic no fuss, delicious recipe. I made it on a weeknight and did not have pineapple juice (subbed more orange) or ginger and it was still great. I used a bit of sesame oil to brown the outside of the sea bass in the pan, then poured in the marinade and covered the pan to steam. Mmmm Loved it. Light and flavorful. I wish all recipies were this healthy and tasty. Served with brown jasmati rice and a salad with tomato, baby greens, artichoke, roasted red pepper, marinated mozzarella and avocado with a bit of olive oil and balsamic for dressing. Would definitely serve for company or a special family dinner.

This is a marvelous dish..Easy to make, flavorful, and good for you! I steamed baby bok choy over the marinade before steaming the fish, and the pairing was light yet satisfying..YUM!! Will make this many times over.

I have not made this yet, but after reading everyone talking about Chilean Sea Bass being overfished(which it was)-our local seafood market had this about it "A widely enjoyed, yet misunderstood fish. The Patagonian Toothfish is found all around the world...not just in Chilean waters where is has been overfished in the past. It is widely referred to as Chilean Sea Bass since the name is so recognized." So it could be that you're all really eating the other fish, which is fine, it's not overfished. I will be making this during the week- I can't wait!

This was easy, healthy and delicious! Husband, 4-year-old son and I loved it. This recipe is a keeper! Made exactly as written. Yum!

the sauce is great - i tried this with some corvina sea bass I had hanging around- I know steaming is a great way to keep it healthy which is why I even made this in the first place, but I think if it were crusted instead of steamed...it would add a nice crunchy element - I still liked it very much!

definitely steam this...low-fat and locks in flavor, virtually impossible to overcook or dry out the fish. very delicate and impressive. just serve with good dry rice and some stir-fried green beans or other veggies. best with sea bass or halibut. watch the liquid levels when steaming.

This is really, really delicious.Watch the marinade, mine boiled down dangerously low before the fish was cooked.Just added water. First time cooking Sea Bass, used Chilean sea bass and blew my guests minds. I will make as often as I can afford to buy the fish!!!!

The recipe can be made easily by baking the filets instead of steaming them. Leave some of the marinate in the baking dish and bake for 20 minutes at 350. It's a great dish and other types of fish can be substituted for the sea bass. Black cod and halibut work well.

The best. We don't steam the sea bass. We always broil them --this is delicious and we've made this dish over 20 times in the past 4 years. Amazing.

this was one of the tastiest and easiest dinners I've made for a dinner party. It was just so easy - pull it from the fridge, pop the steamer in the pot, pour in marinade & boil for 10 minutes. My filets were very thick, so I went a little longer on the steam (about 15 min) and I thickened the sauce with some corn starch. Serve with some wild rice, mango salsa and sauvingnon blanc - it's a KNOCK OUT dinner. Not easy on the check book, but well worth the expense.

Great with Salmon steaks too. Tried this twice and thought i'd pan fry the second time. Big mistake...the sugar in the marinade burns easily.

Absolutely will be making this again! Served at an impromptu cookout yesterday. Easy to prepare, marinaded while the guests talked, cooked quickly -- on a grill, no less. And several guests asked for the recipe before leaving.

The sauce in this recipe was just awful. If you make this, go easy on the reduction sauce - it's way too salty.

I made this recipe as written except baked it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. I found that the marinade was too sweet for me. If I do make this again, will alter it. It looked gorgeous but I think the amount of pineapple juice was too much.

I used Talapia- at 1/4 of the cost of Sea Bass it was a great substitute. Wonderful flavour and very light.

Just wonderful - and so easy. I, like others, substituted something else for the poor over-fished sea bass. I used tilapia. Quick, easy, and nearly impossible to mess up.

Really delicious multi-purpose sauce. I added about a half tablespoon of brown sugar because the orange juice I used was quite tart - and I like sweeter sauces. Marinated tuna steaks in half the marinade. Then seared the steaks in a dry pan, reduced the remaining sauce and drizzled over the rare steaks. Best part was eating sushi rice drenched in the sauce - so good! So fast and easy - a great weeknight dish.

I made this for a dinner party & it was a huge hit, absolutely delicious. To the cook from CT, you actually don't speak for everyone on this site. Some of us are not deaf, or dumb (or just lacking a conscience). I used tilapia steaks instead of endangered sea bass, and it was perfect. I added more pineapple juice and slightly less soy sauce, added snow peas to the sauce & served it over mash with a salad that included toasted almonds & green apple with a dressing made with fresh basil. Yum!

I love this recipe. It's impossible to mess up the fish by steaming it. I have come out with different results on the topping each time I've prepared the dish. I prefer it syrupy/thick.

I've never tried steaming fish before and this was so easy and very impressive to my guests! I used striped bass, but it still went very nicely with the marinade. I also added one clove of chopped garlic to the marinade. I'm very excited to make this again and I highly recommend it!

A quest to find the ultimate lobster roll led us downtown to chelsea food market where we were greeted with a fish market with the most beautiful sashimi quality yellowfin tuna and scottish salmon Being seafoodies my bf and I could not pass up the sea bass so we searched for a recipe online that matched the meager ingredients that we had available in the fridge and voila here it was Now we never cook and really do not know how to cook but with a few clever adjustments we made a delicious sea bass dish that rivaled even Bond St First adjustment was due to a lack of preparation time we had no time to marinade so we simply baked the fish in half of the mixture for about fifteen minutes at four hundred in the oven Secondly to the marinade we added sugar basically a pack of equal and a pack of raw brown sugar thanks starbucks so we poured the pineapple orange juice soy sauce wasabi ginger sugar and olive oil into a martini mixer and shook it up reduced it until it caramelized poured it over the baked fish and voila seabass that makes me think i should open my own restaurant

I didn't love this dish as much as others did (although my daughter thought it was spectacular). But one suggestion, to those of you who are straining the grated ginger from the sauce: have you tried Ginger Juice, by The Ginger People? It's great, and saves a lot of time -- and available at a many gourmet stores, and the Ginger People website.

this dish comes out so sophisticated, it's hard to believe it's so easy to make! we were short on time, so we marinated the fish for only 1 hour and 15 min, and it was still wonderful. like others, I baked it instead of steaming it (20 min at 400). would be great to serve with a sweeter wine, like riesling.

Rating: 4
A great recipe. This is the best sea bass recipe I've tried yet. I changed the cooking directions a little bit (baked the fish in a little sauce, reduced the rest of the sauce to then pour over the cooked fish). My rockfish came from the lovely Chesapeake Bay, caught by yours truly... not from Chile :-P

My husband had three words for this dish: "Better than Nobu". That pretty much says it all (referring to the famed New York City restaurant, where he's eaten many times). I followed the recipe for the marinade exactly, marinated the fish for about 2 hrs, but baked it at 400 for 15 minutes -- it was to-die-for tender and so tasty, better than any chilean sea bass I've had in a restaurant EVER. I was tempted to add garlic to the marinade (love garlic) but didn't, and it was incredible without it. Maybe next time. Baking it gave it a lovely sweet glaze, and I spooned the reduced marinade over top when serving. Oh, and if you disapprove of eating chilean sea bass (or foie gras, or lobster, or whatever) then PLEASE don't vent your opinion here; it is falling on deaf ears, as we epicurians aren't listening to your preaching while searching for ways to prepare our favorite foods. Thank you, and enjoy the sea bass!

Before you make this recipe (or any recipe calling for sea bass), please be aware that Chilean sea bass are being overfished to the point that some experts consider them in danger of becoming extinct within the next decade. Much of the sea bass that reaches American markets has been harvested illegally. Many environmentally conscious chefs are actually taking sea bass off their menus for this reason.

Great taste and presentation. I baked the sea bass instead of steaming and it worked really well. The mixture of the flavors from the marinade were wonderful. I marinated the fish overnight. The touch of the green scallions added to the presentation with texture and color as well as to the flavor. This is a keeper

This marinade smelled wonderful but I found the reduction too salty as well. At $16.99 for good sea bass (Wegman's), I decided that it doesn't need any marinades at all! The sea bass was the star and the sauce just detracted. My fave prep for this fish? Brush with olive oil, sprinkle with salt, pepper, and cayenne, squeeze a bit of lime juice on top and roast at 500 until cooked through. Actually I use that prep on just about all flakey fish (scrod cod, haddock, salmon, whitefish, flounder).

The first time I tried this, I got a too salty sauce (maybe I boiled the sauce too long to get a thicker result), but felt it had good flavors so tried again. The second time around, I used 1/2 the amount of soy sauce listed and more pineapple juice. I also added a little corn starch mixed with juice when boiling the sauce to make it a little thicker. It is a keeper this way and the reason I gave it 3 spoons up.

Absolutely wonderful! It was VERY easy and had super flavor. It could use less oil. Instead of rice, I served it over sauteed polenta which was really outstanding!

I put a little of this sauce on cod before I put it in the oven to bake. I did not want to marinate the fish because I did not want the fish to get mushy. I am going to try this on shrimp which can be marinated for a little while.

It is a great recipie and so simple too. I did not have pineapple juice so I skipped that. Also I added just a little bit of wasabi flavored soy-sauce. Finally, after the fish was cooked, I added some asparagus to the marinade and broiled it for 5 minutes. The combination was very tasty and so easy to make. Definitely will make it next time.

I made this on Valentine's Day and served it with Jasmine rice mixed with scallions along with some other dishes. It is so easy to make and extremely tasty. Sea bass is a heavier fish so I feel it's nice to have side dishes that are on the lighter side. Can't wait to make to make it again!

This recipe deserves a rarely given (by me) "four forks" because of its ease of preparation and cooking. Even though I did not have orange juice and forgot to put the green onions on as a finishing touch, it was still fabulous. Next time I will strain the ginger pieces from the sauce. Excellent with rice and asparagus.

This recipe is a classic in our home. I have made it with Halibut and Sea Bass, and both are incredible. The fish tastes great cooked on the grill provided you have a grate to put it on so the fish does not fall through. I like to make the sauce a little spicier than the recipe calls for and serve the fish on a bed of soba noodles...everyone always wants the recipe.

I have made this dish a number of times and each time it gets better. Here are some tips: Watch the boil down on the sauce. Do NOT let it get too thick as it increases the saltiness. Also, substitutu chinese wheat noodles for the rice. place fish on top of noodles. The sauce is just enough to flavor both the fish and the noodles. Try garnishing with grilled pineapple. My friend Dave suggested this and it is now the gold standard.

This recipe was much too salty for our taste (even though I used low sodium soy sauce). Like some other reviewers, I marinaded the fish for several hours, grilled it, and served it with the sauce. It was okay, but I probably would not make it again.

TRULY OUTSTANDING!!! My husband is not a fan of fish at all and has only recently been willing to try certain types after much effort on my part. He literally cleaned his plate and raved throughout the meal. I steamed the fish in foil on the grill making sure that some of the marinade was at the bottom of my foil packet. I the fish servd over orzo tossed with butter, shredded parmesan and minced chives. Spooned the reduced sauce over and then garnished with black sesame seeds and green onions. Would be a fabulous dish for company! Very easy and quick to prepare.

This was delicious and very easy. I used Chilean Sea Bass and marinated for 4 hours. I also grilled the bass and doubled the sauce so I could continue basting. When the remaining sauce had reduced to a nice thickness, I poured over the top and served. I forgot the green onions but I think that would have made a nice final touch as would toasted sesame seeds. Definitely recommend.
