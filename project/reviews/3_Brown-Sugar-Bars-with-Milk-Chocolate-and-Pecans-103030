These are good because the orange and milk chocolate flavor is unique in a blondie. Biscotti flavor with a cake texture. I used 1 Tbsp grated orange peel instead of candied and drizzled browned butter glaze over after cutting.

A very nice basic blondie recipe. Be sure to let the batter cool thoroughly before adding the milk chocolate chips. Mine was still a bit warm and I ended up with something like marble blondies. Tasty, though.

I tried to put the batter in muffin cups so maybe that affected the texture (it was VERY dry) but I think the batter itself wasn't flavorful enough. Maybe it needs more DARK brown sugar??

This was a great success at work. I used very good milk chocolate and grated peel vs candied. Very easy to make.

These are super! Simply the best blondie recipe I ever made--incomparably moist and wonderfully flavored. Use good-quality milk chocolate chips, otherwise make as is--or double! If you wrap these individually in saran wrap after cutting, they will stay perfect. On another occasion, I made them into cookies (18 in all, baked 12 minutes on greased uninsulated sheets) with orange extract, orange juice, and plain old bottled orange peel instead of the candied zest and Grand Marnier--a very nice, cakey cookie with a great orange flavor. I love them both ways.

I would have given this recipe 21/2 forks instead of 3 if that had been an option ! They were easy to make & turned out well. Tasted great the first day (you have to like the taste of Grand Marnier & orange peel though, as these flavours are quite strong) but were too dry for me on day two, despite careful wrapping in clingfilm. Particularly the edges. Cutting the pecans fairly small makes for neater cutting when the bars are cooked.
