I just made this since I'm going to try to make the fish in foil. I tasted it before I added the sherry vinegar because, to be honest, I just forgot. It is so good, I'm leaving out the vinegar since I like it just the way it is. And since I had an avocado out, I tried a little bit on the avocado - I think if you were cooking for people who like avocado (I'm not so lucky), that you could blend in a little avocado just before serving and turn it into a creamy delicious sauce - different than the original sauce, but also delicious. I wasn't sure about the tomatillos and roasting the garlic, but it is wonderful. I just hope it is well-received because I'm making it again even if it isn't. I like it that much.

LOVE this sauce, and it was amazing with the fish. I didn't want to take the time to roast the garlic, so I used 4 large cloves of fresh garlic, minced, and when they didn't have Poblanos at the store, I substituted with one green pepper and a jalapeno - GENIUS. The sauce was AMAZING and one I'm adding to my favorites!

I only had one pablano pepper so I added two large jalapena peppers and used the oil from garlic in the recipe. This is a really good sauce. We used on the red snapper recipe as suggested and had enough extra for guests to pour on the fish themselves to add even more flavor.

I was utterly disappointed with this recipe. Everything tasted great before it went into the foil and the oven. Once cooked, the onions had lost all their sweetness, the Mojo Verde all its lemony tang. The fish and the entire dish had a singular blandness. Luckily the fresh Mojo Verde added something, but you may as well just eat that with a spoon and skip the rest.

Delicious! This is different from Mexican green salsa and green enchilada sauce -- it is less lemony despite the tomatillos, and the roasted garlic and cumin add depth of flavor. It's more sultry and complex than Mexican tomatillo salsas. I used this in a variation of his fish recipe and it was outstanding. I've already made it a second time and doubled the recipe to try in chicken enchiladas. One suggestion: his method of roasting the garlic is quite wasteful of olive oil; use another.

This was an incredibly good sauce! We made it to go with the roasted fish recipe with which it is associated and it was wonderful with that, but we can think of all sorts of things for which this sauce would be a great companion. It's "a keeper".
