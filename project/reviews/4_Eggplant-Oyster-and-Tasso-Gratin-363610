Haven't tried the recipe yet, but if its from Susan Spicer I don't have to try it to know that it's good. As far as tasso acquisition is concerned, you might be in a pickle if you don't live in south Louisiana. Here in NOLA and pretty much everywhere within a 100 mile radius, you are probably within walking distance of tasso and andouille and all of the other wonderful treats special to the area at any given time.(The best tasso I've ever come across was at a gas station) Here are a few vendors of genuine regional products that ship nation-wide at reasonable rates for Louisiana ex-pats and aspiring cajun/creole gourmands alike: www.beststopinscott.com (personal favorite - best boudin and cracklins on earth) www.bourquespecialties.com www.cajungrocer.com Now you can start cooking your way through any Louisiana cookbook without having to search high and low for the good stuff! Bonus points if you attempt to make stuffed beef tongue.

This was really delicious. I couldn't find tasso either so I substituted a spicy smoked sausage. Turned out great.

This sounds fabulous, but where do I find tasso? I'll keep checking back to find out. Thanks in advance. Can't wait to make this. I love eggplant and hubby loves oysters,.
