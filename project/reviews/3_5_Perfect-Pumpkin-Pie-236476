I used this as the base for Amaretto-Almond Streusel Pumpkin Pie. Used a purchased crust but no other changes.Thought the filling was too soft and lacking in flavor.

I made this for the first time last Thanksgiving, 2011 and it was a huge success. The hint of citrus lightens up the pumpkin pie. The best part, the grand marnier in the whipped cream. You could simply do the whipped cream and it will make any pump. pie a gourmet dessert. Everyone lapped it up. Making it again this year.

Delicious! Tried this for the first time last week (for Thanksgiving) and couldn't believe how much we liked it - really is perfect pumpkin pie. I've made and really liked the pumpkin, pecan & honey pie recipe available on epicurious for years, but wanted to try something a little different. Intended to do the upgrade to citrus pumpkin with Grand Marnier cream, but never got around to the modifications. Glad I didn't because now I have a new and very easy favorite - especially when served with my homemade cinnamon ice cream. Yum! Don't usually go nuts for all-butter crusts, but this one was super good. Enjoy!

The pie filling here is great, but I do not understand the recommendation to spray the pie plate with nonstick spray. . .the crust slid down the sides of the plate while baking, leaving my pie looking more like a tart. Next time I'll skip the spray.

Compared to some other pumpkin pies I've made this was not impressive. I made this for the "Almond Amaretto Pumpkin Pie" recipe, and knowing that I like a bit spicier pie, I added a bit more ginger and amaretto, but it was still bland; texturally good, but bland nonetheless. I even used homemade pumpkin puree. The butter crust was delicious, however. If you're looking for a really standout pie, I'd go with something else.

Really good. I'd suggest using just one cup of cream and/or three huge eggs, or else four. I made it according to the recipe and it was a little too soft and creamy for me. Also, I'd recommend using at least a full teaspoon of cinnamon and/or ginger, and maybe two pinches of ground cloves and/or ground allspice and/or ground cardamom.

This is the best pumpkin pie recipe ever. We are a family of sweet potato pie bakers and eaters and this Perfect Pumpkin Pie passed everyone's taste test. The amount of spices is well balanced and the texture is smooth. I've made it every year since '06. BTW this easily converts to sweet potatoes, just bake a large fresh one in the oven (like a baked russet), let it cool a bit, peel the skin, use 15oz. of the potato and follow the recipe from there.

This pie was amazing. Perfect consistency and flavor. I used a store-bought crust, but followed the directions here for the crust. I'll certainly make this my go-to pumpkin pie recipe!

This is the best pumpkin pie I have ever tasted. I'm not sure why, but both times I followed the recipe exactly and there was too much liquid for a deep dish and it overflowed. I might cut back on the cream next time and see if that helps.

Yummy! Was a big hit! The first time I made it was with whipping cream (not heavy) and was delicious. The second time I made with heavy whipping cream and my dad noticed it was even better!

Wonderful, old-fashioned, classic pumpkin pie. The crust is fantastic, flaky and remained crisp on the bottom. The custard is lovely: creamy, light, brimming with holiday flavor. Wouldn't change a thing. I converted a number of skeptical Europeans with this recipe!

Have made this twice. First followed the recipe exactly-good texture-more smooth and creamy than my usual pumpkin pie. Second time used real pumpkin, not canned, and punched up the spices. that made it delicious and a four fork p;ie.

Perfect? No. Very good? Yes. This was certainly an easy and delicious version of pumpkin pie, but nothing elevated it from countless similar pies I've had over the years. Try it, but don't expect fireworks.

I have made at least half of the pumpkin pies from Bon Appetit over the past 25 years. This pie was good but not great because it was a little too bland. (If I could I would give it two and a half stars.)I must prefer a pie with more depth of flavor, perhaps using maple syrup or more spices.

This pumpkin pie was excellent. Very light. I don't even like pumpkin pie and normally just make it for my husband but this one was delicious. The pastry came out very well too. It will now be my staple pumpkin pie recipe.

I don't love pumpkin pie, but thought this was truly wonderful -- very creamy and nicely flavored. I did not make the crust but used my own standard recipe.

I tested recipes this month and ended up making 5 of these pies. Very very easy. Tasted great and creamy. All fo my guests loved it.

I thought this pumpkin pie was just OK. I followed the recipe to the letter, and the pie simply wasn't rich or full-flavored enough. I thought it might be better the next day after the flavors had time to marry, but it was still pretty bland. The texture wasn't that great either. Served with a big dollop of whipped cream and a good cup of coffee, it was definitely good, but it certainly didn't measure up to my aunt's, whose recipe I wasn't able to get in time for Thanksgiving.

We made this pie both for Thanksgiving and for the Thanksgiving Redux 2 days later. The first pie was made exactly according to the recipe. I always freeze my pie shells prior either to blind baking or baking when filled, and this made a critical difference in the flakiness of the crust; the second pie was not frozen prior to its blind baking, and wasn't quite as well done. It should be noted that both crusts--using the all-butter crust specified--barely filled a deep-dish pie plate, so they didn't have a fluted edge...if this matters to anyone. Although the first pie was delicious, most of us would have preferred more spicing; when we made the second pie, we added more spices AND a splash of Cognac...and that was a marked improvement in the flavor. Both pies have a lovely, soft, creamy texture. All in all, delicious and worthy of being made again.

This was really good. I only made 1 substitution: baked, pureed, drained pumpkin for canned. My only problem was the crust. When it says "FILL" it with beans, you really must fill it to the brim or your crust will slouch down the sides like mine did, which makes the crust too shallow to hold all the filling. I would also re-chill the crust before baking with the weights to see if that helps hold it's structure better. I baked the extra filling in a casserole along side the pie and that was great too. I would think one could cut down on the cream with no problems as it is very creamy.

This is being added to my Thanksgiving file. The pie was awesome!!

Very rich and delicious. I whisked it by hand and it was fluffy and creamy. the first one i made followed amounts accurately, and it was great, but for the second pie i spiced it up a lot more. i like a spicy pie, and the ingredients used in the recipe go very well together. (I used a different recipe for crust, so i cannot vouch for the crust called for here.)

I made this pie today to 'test' it out before Thanksgiving and it is delicious! My son-in-law says it's the best pumpkin pie he's ever had. I had to cook about 10 minutes longer than the recipe said. Crust is perfect.

This was the very best pumpkin pie recipe- fabulous. I am a real foodie and I have a real sweet tooth. Reminded me of the pies that my mother would make.
