This recipe was AMAZING good! Next time I will peel the apples though (my own fault). I am not a nut fan, so I didn't add the nuts, and I took the advice of many on here and cooked for 40 minutes instead. And it turned out perfectly! I also doubled the batch of the topping so that it had a lot of crisp. This is the best of all apple crisp recipes I have tried. And SO fast to prepare!

Such an easy recipe, and so delectable! There's nothing like a locally-picked apple to make this dessert delish. We used a combination of Cortlands and Honey Crisp. I also used the juice of a whole lemon, about 4 tbsp, and mixed in a pinch of br. sugar and cinnamon to the lemon. The recommendation of 40 minutes was right on.

The perfect apple crisp recipe, and sooooo easy. I used Granny Smith apples, and they added the perfect tang to go with the sweet topping!

A quick and easy dessert perfect for the season. I pulled the crisp after 45 minutes and I'm glad I did. The apples had begun to really break down and I prefer my apples to be soft but retain their shape. I think the optimal time would be around 35-40 minutes. I cut my apples a bit larger than called for based on other reviews. Vanilla ice cream sends it over the top!

Just ok. Cooked for 45 minutes as suggested. Topping was a little dry.

This has been my "go-to" apple crisp recipe since I found it! I love the topping! I omit the nuts and add a lil bit of nutmeg and cloves. I also chop my apples pretty thick so they don't get so mushy.

I made this recipe as directed and found the baking time to be far too long. The apples were so softened it was like eating apple sauce. I recommend baking for 35-40 minutes instead. I also think slightly less lemon juice is better.

Crunchy topping and nicely caramelized apples - just the way I like it!

This was exteremly yummy!! However, I did make some alterations on the recipe! Instead of walnuts I used slivered almonds. Also, I doubled the recipe in all ingredients....but added an extra apple. So 9 apples. They were granny smith... sweet and tart at the same time! Apple Crisp is supposed to be crisp so it was perfecto! Love it and will be making it again......

This would be a much better recipe if the flour is totally omitted, there is absolutley no reason to add flour to the topping.

Try adding your own extras to make it a little better! i put nutmeg and cinnamon with the apples as well as a little extra brown sugar to caramelize them more. Also needed a little extra butter for the crust ( I also added a little in the apples). 1 hour is too long for baking, maybe 45 mins and I turned it up a notch to 375 degrees about half way through. With all the extras it tasted really yummy. To make more decadent, I added a little caramel sauce over the topping ( Caramel dip near apples in grocery store). Will probably make again :)

This recipe could have used a lot of improvements. The apples needed to have something mixed with them besides just lemon juice & the topping was much too crispy. Too much sugar & the cooking time is far too long.I'm sure there are much better recipes out there.

I made this for my boyfriend, and he tried to eat the whole thing it was so good!!! The only things I changed was that I needed extra butter to make the crisp so it wasn't dry, I added some nutmeg, and I added some fresh cranberries to the apples. Delicious! I am definately going to make this again.

I made 4 times what the recipe called for a family gathering and it came out awesome! Everyone loved it! I will definately make it again.

Taste was ok, but crisp came out very dry. Topping was not crumbly enough, and the oatmeal tasted very dry and raw.

This was delicious. I didn't use a lemon because I didn't have one. I used granny smith and pink lady apples. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe turned out ok. It was a little crispy. I didn't know what kind of apples to use, so I chose macintosh. They were a little on the soft and gritty side. The topping was good though. My guests ate it all, so I guess it turned out alright.

Quite simple and very delicious. Doubles very easily. I choose not to use the lemon and it was quite perfect!!

My mom is 84 years old and is known by her church family for her Apple Pie. She recommends Paul Red and Ida Red as the best pie apples. These are tart apples but have a tremendous amount of flavor. Make sure however that you add all of the sugar and possibly a dab more. If the apples bubble and run over, it's excellent crisp or pie. Fall in Michigan is the best time and place to make this!

I can safely say that you can throw away all of your other apple crisp recipes. This recipe is the one. It takes a homely-but-loved standard and tweaks it to something a bit more elegant. To my mind, though, pecans surpass walnuts. As for apples, I always follow the advice of my mother (truly the best apple pie baker out there): use at least two different varieties -- MacIntosh, Cortland, Rome, Nothern Spy, whatever -- and you'll have more interesting texture and better flavor.

I made this for a Sunday morning brunch dessert but I doubled the recipe and modified it a bit. I did not use lemon juice b/c I don't like when you have apple dishes that taste like lemon or the walnuts. I used most of but not all of the topping, so it wouldn't be too sweet. I also used Braeburn apples b/c I can not get Cortland around here. All my guests raved about it, so I am going to try it again.

This was very good made with golden delicious apples& a LOT of cinnamon!!!

I really liked the topping - sweet enough but not too sweet. My guests loved it and asked for the recipe, and was the only dessert on the table to completely disappear. I used white instead of brown sugar (was less brown in the pantry than I'd thought), and that came out fine. I wish the recipe had given a hint on whether to use sweet or tart baking apples. I used Cortland and the apples seemed a bit sweet, next time I'll probably mix Cortland and Granny Smith.

Oatmeal and nuts, along with the apples made this desert not only delicious but nutritious. I definitely will make again.

An easy, tasty version of an old standby. Next time I will use slightly less sugar.

Very good! If you like applecrisp, this is an excellent recipe. Walnuts are also a very nice touch.

Although easy to make, would have rather put more work into something more tasteful.
