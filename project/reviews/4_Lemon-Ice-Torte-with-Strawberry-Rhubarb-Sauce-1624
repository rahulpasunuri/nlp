Really good dessert and easy to make. I did not make the sauce as directed but instead used frozen mixed fruits and add a little sugar to them along with lemon zest and juice from one lemon. Warmed up the sauce and then let it cool. I had it in a pretty bowl to serve along with the dessert but forgot to put it out. Oh well. It is now in the freezer for a later date. Obviously, the dessert was yummy without any sauce. Enjoy making it.

This is a wonderful recipe that can be easily adjusted- 5 years ago I brought this to a Passover seder and my hosts have insisted I bring it every year since. I have tried melting chocolate chips on the crust, using raspberry jam, vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce. It too was excellent. One friend routinely makes this for 4th of July adding a blueberry garnish to achieve "red,white and blue".

I have made this dessert for our Passover Seder every year since the recipe first appeared. Its such a nice light ending for the heavy seder meal. Everyone loves it.

I have been making this for years at the Seder, and it is so popular I don't dare show up at the family Seder without it! Often use fresh rhubarb for the sauce as it is in season in the spring.

Double Yum!! I've made this for years and always get raves.The crust is fantastic. Though I've made the sauce with rhubarb and love it, I've also used mixed berries (strawberries, blackberries, cherries) along with the vanilla bean. To lighten up the tartness of some lemon sorbets, I mix half sorbet and half vanilla ice cream--it's creamier and still has that nice lemon bite.

This is wonderful, looks elegant and has been " a hit" every time I have made it. For the last 4 years I have been asked repeatedly to bring this, in lieu of a flourless chocolate, for the Passover Seder.

I'd like to try this but I'm not a big rhubarb fan. Would all strawberries work? Or perhaps frozen mixed berries (blueberry/strawberry/raspberry?)

I made this recipe for my son's 11th birthday. He is now 22 and still says this is his favorite dessert.

This was a hit with our guests. The crust is excellent! We used a honeydew melon sorbet instead of the lemon or pineapple, and it was delicious.

I really enjoyed the dessert. The crust was great!! But I realled loved the sauce!!! With the leftover sauce I made an excellent non-alcoholic daiquiri.

In the July heat-wave in New York this was a cool and welcome dessert. The crust was superb! Adults and kids gave rave reviews. I will definitely make it again.
