This recipe was the star of the party! What a great combination to have the hazelnuts and tarragon together -- I'll definitely make this again and will use the vinaigrette in other recipes as well. We served the asparagus on top of spinach leaves. A very showy recipe as well. I think it would go well both warm and cold. This was the best asparagus recipe I have ever eaten by far!

This was great! It was nice to have the asparagus made differently than the classic way. Would make again!

Absolutely Fab.....tarragon is not an herb that you think about often but it definetly works here. I use regular white wine vinegar and only fresh tarragon and ggod quality hazelnut oil, if you've made substitutions for that then you're missing out. It is the perfect party dish. I have given his recipe to everyone I know. If you have this issue of Bon Appetit, the May 1994 French Countryside issue....keep it or get it from Ebay!!! Every dish in that issue is spectacular!

Sorry to disagree with everyone who loved this, but we found the dressing a bit too sharp for the asparagus. I followed the recipe to the letter and didn't car for this.

Great flavor, easy, quick, and advance prep for dinner parties what could be better. I used a little less oil than called for otherwise made the recipe as written.

Wow, I made this for the first time for some friends and family and everyone including the children enjoyed it. Even the ones that were not fans of asparagus. I added a scant teaspoon of sugar to the vinaigrette which mellowed it slightly. The only thing I would do next time is double it. Delicious!!!!

Great recipe. You can substitute other vinegar but the hazelnut oil makes it scrumptious. This recipe has made it to so many Spring and Summer parties. People can't get enough. I make the asparagus a day ahead wrap in apaper towels and chill. I also make the dressing a day ahead, it's better if the flravors meld......and I only use fresh tarragon but I use about 2/3 as much as called for.

Wonderful flavor and a great recipe, but it can be made even easier. First, the hazelnuts do need to be toasted but they definitely don't need to be skinned. The taste and texture is still great with the skins on, and I think they look better that way too. Second, you don't need to chill the asparagus for any length of time--just let the asparagus drain after steaming while you prepare the sauce. The sauce is room temp anyway so the asparagus can't get too hot. You also don't need to use a special vinegar if you don't have it--just use white wine vinegar and plenty of tarragon. It makes a wonderful side dish by itself on a serving platter, but if you're into endive or baby lettuce, then go ahead with the advanced presentation! I served this with seared salmon w/balsamic glaze (also from epicurious) and a Florentine-style risotto.

WOW! Fantastic! I broke asparagus in bite size pieces. Dried Terragon, No shallots used some red onion. White wine vinegar and a little red wine-shallot vinegar. Hazelnut oil(yum) I added fresh small leaf spinach leaves and crumbled goat cheese (yum! yum!) I mixed my nuts in. It was good before the goat cheese but wow after! Did I mention how much I love good food?

Was a nice appetizer, this followed a brushcetta. The only thing I would change is it needed a contrasting flavor since the tarragon was indestinguishable from the mustard. I would also not serve it on the lettuce, but by itself.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. The hazelnuts really make this dish special. I did reduce the olive oil to 5 Tbsps, and it was fine. The only trouble I had was with husking the hazelnuts after they were toasted. Some of the skins would not come off.

THIS IS A TERRIFIC DISH. I'VE SERVED THIS TO GUESTS AND THERE IS NEVER ANY LEFTOVER. THE VINAIGRETTE IS VERY LIGHT TASTING. IT'S A GREAT WAY TO INTRODUCE ASPARAGUS.

I served this dish at a dinner party. It was very easy to prepare as it can be made up to 6 hours in advance. I was unable to find the hazlenuts,(which was disappointing) so I substituted toasted pecans. I think that next time I make this dish I will cut back a little on the oil. The dressing had a nice tangy flavor and great texture.

I had this during a party and it had a great taste. I'll be making this one as a nice change, espcially during the summer since you serve this chilled.

I used red wine vinegar, dried tarragon, pecans instead of hazelnuts, far less oil (about 1 T), and salt and sugar to taste. Make sure to emulsify well, and then pour over just warm or room-temp. microwaved asparagus--a really tasty, nice, chunky dressing. Great as a delicate accompaniment to salty or winey-flavored main courses.

This was delicious! I never would have thought to combine asparagus and hazelnuts, but I'm glad somebody else did. It disappeared rapidly.

I would definitely make this dish again. Except, because my family cannot stand asparagus, I cooked it with fresh green beans instead. A Masterpiece!

I am the head chef at a restaurant in Flint. I made this recipe for a regular visitor of my establishment. They enjoyed it so much they told me to add it to my menu.
