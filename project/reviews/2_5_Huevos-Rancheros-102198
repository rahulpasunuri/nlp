Im sorry to say that this recipe is a bad imitation of the real, traditional one made in Mexico. Its missing a lot of ingredients and some of the ingredients listed shouldnt be used. If you look up huevos rancheros in epicurious you should take a look at the more recent recipe. But even this recipe doesnt get close. I have a recipe, but its in spanish.

This cook liked it better than the other diners. People don't seem to like anything out-of-the-ordinary for breakfast. Maybe better for a brunch than first thing in the morning? The recipe was easy, tasty. A lot depends on the aulity of the sauce; maybe next time I'd serve it milder, with more fresh add-ins like sauteed bits of onion, peppers.

Bottled salsa? C'mon ... You gotta be kidding. Take a little time and make it right: saute some onions and garlic, add a few crushed roasted red chilis and crushed tomatos, salt and pepper, a little fresh cilantro, and perhaps a touch of red wine left over from the night before. Simmer it for 20 minutes or so. Now you've got some good eatin'!

I always wondered what huevos rancheros was. Now I know! But my boyfriend loves it. I make it frequently cuz we have a load of corn tortillas and I'm trying to figure out how to get rid of them. His mother bought those instead of the flour ones. But do try this recipe.

The recipe is good - but to make it even better, just add 1 Tablespoon refried beans, then the eggs, and top with enchilada sauce!!
