Easy recipe and really good. I used ground lamb instead of making patties. I added a little bit of allspice and some fresh parley and oregano. I also made my own tzatziki - Greek yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, cucumbers.

Ever since going to Morocco as a child, I've been trying to find something like the lamb patties there- where we pointed and they'd cut off that chunk of fresh lamb and grind it with fresh mint... This was the closest we've gotten! Made mini patties on the grill and served them with Greek-style plain yogurt with shredded cucumber and diced tomatoes. Big hit, even with the picky eaters!!!

My only modification with this recipe was to make smaller meatballs and to serve them in mini pitas. It still came out great, if a little underspiced. Next time I'll use more cumin and cinnamon.

The recipe is great and easy to make and I have been cooking it over and over again for 2+ years

Whoa this was awesome and so easy!! Definitely a midweek treat yum yum. Had a serrano on hand so added a little minced up to the mixture for an added kick. Also I made into little balls instead of patties.

This is a great recipe and became a staple in my kitchen. I make only the lamb and just stir in a pan, not trying to give it any shape. I serve it with crepes (sour cream and sheep cheese on side) for brunch, or I serve it with potato pancakes for dinner. I don't measure the spices, but I probably double the recommended amount. We like our food really spicy. It is a quick and easy meal and I get a lot of compliments any time I make it!

Twiked this rececipe slightly. I marinated the lamb in an original Jerk seasoning for 4 hours then followed the receipe as stated. Then served on flat bread instead of pitas (which always crumbled). Included the marinated veggies and yogurt dressing, as suggested. Finished with grilled mangoes with a touch of honey! My big honey and little honeys loved the meal.

Excellent taste and very moist, better than the usual hamburgers, or at least a very nice change. Rather than the yogurt mixture mentioned in the introduction, I served our patties with a tomato sauce, which recipe appears on this site as Turkish Lamb Patties with Tomato Sauce. We accompanied this with Middle Eastern Flat Bread (rather than pitas) now readily available in most supermarkets.

Looking for a way to use leftover pita bread. Yum--this had a great flavor and was pretty quick to make.

This was very good, but we cooked the lamb a little long....oops! I couldn't find fresh mint, since the supermarket was sold out, but soaked dried mint worked ok. I agree that the cinnamon really makes the dish, and the spices really make the lamb worth while. We had this with the yoghurt sauce suggested, and it was great! I found that a Greek Salad and cousous with roasted veggies went really well with it.

This was delicious. I used left over leg of lamb and cut it into strips. Then I warmed it in a skillet with some red wine. Served it on the pita's open faced with diced cucumber, tomatos, feta cheese and a yogurt dill sauce. Even my picky teenager liked it.

Great! I made it without the mint (I thought i had some), but it was still wonderful. The cinnamon makes the dish!! I also cooked the lamb on a BBQ. Stuff pitas with cucumber, tomato and yogurt. Nice low calorie meal.
