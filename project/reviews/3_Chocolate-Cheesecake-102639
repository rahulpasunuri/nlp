This was my first cheesecake and I found this recipe easy to follow. I used an 11" springform pan lined with parchment paper, which worked perfectly for me. My old gas oven is temperamental, so I use a thermometer, baking the cake for exactly 1 hour @ 350. This also worked well. In another review, someone mentioned that the 'chocolate is overpowering,' and I agree. The cake is delicious, but VERY RICH. I tasted the cake after cooling it, but slightly warm in the center, and it would just about be enough to make someone sick. The morning after overnight refrigeration, it was amazing. I would definitely make this recipe again, and I want to try making a chocolate glaze for it.

This is a great recipe:simple, rich and creamy. I recommend putting it in a little bigger spring-form pan and baking it with a water bath. I also finish the cheesecake by topping it off with a simple chocolate glaze. It is a favorite among friends.

To the previous cook - maybe your cream cheese was rancid? I'm not sure why the combination would have made your daughter ill, or why the neighbors would complain about the smell? We once had a pan of lasagna at a church potluck mistakenly made with bad cheese and the smell was absolutely horrid. . .

I made this for my kids - they took one whiff and wouldn't eat it, and neither would my husband. My daughter did take one bite but started crying and threw up the next morning. Something about that chocolate-cheese combo just didn't set well with us. One of the upstairs neighbors even called to complain about the smell.

A large heavy cheesecake with a very rich chocolate flavour. The mouthfeel is very creamy and should be refridgerated for a minimum of one day before serving. My first try at this cake, came out with a drier, crumblier texture than most cheesecakes. The edges rose too high and were much drier than the creamier center. Maybe try a waterbath and lower the oven temperature.

I made this for a party and it was a hit. I will cream the cream cheese with the suger BEFORE adding the eggs next time for a creamier consistency. Also, I used orange rum in the batter and in a ganache I added for a topping (heat to melt: 1/2 c. cream, 3/4 c. semi-sweet choc chips, splash of rum). I think the appearance of the cheesecake would be boring without some sort of topping.

i used jumbo eggs instead of large...big mistake! the cheesecake puffed up so high that it left a ring of burnt crust around the top of the pan, then the rest of it was wet and gushy. i might try it again with smaller eggs and a longer baking time. this attempt was inedible.

As a 20 something trying to impress my boyfriend's mother, I made this cake for last Thanksgiving. Boy, she was more than impressed! No one ate her apple pie and they even came for seconds for this recipe. I plan on making it this year just to spite! I would just warn anyone to not use fat-free or reduced fat cream cheese, it really makes the cake very chunky.

If I made this cheesecake again I would change a few things. I think that there was too much chocolate in the recipe and it overpowered the cheesecake. Also, next time I would use less orange flavoring. It also turned out a little mooshy, maybe try cooking it longer than an hour. Better luck next time.

When I saw that this recipe, which sounded perfectly fine, had only one reviewer and that one negative, my curiosity was aroused. The only thing wrong with it that I could see is that the 8-inch pan size is TOO SMALL. The filling overflowed it. I made a glaze out of 3 ounces melted semisweet chocolate, 2 tablespoons butter, and one-half tablespoon evaporated milk to cover up the less-than-pretty top that resulted from the spillage. I also added a chocolate cookie crust--1 cup chocolate cookie crumbs, 1/4 cup melted butter, and one tablespoon sugar. With these adjustments, the recipe was a huge success--the word "orgasmic" was used in connection with it. So don't be scared off, Epicurious readers!

gosh i think this recipe really flopped for me...first of all, the cake was burnt by the time i got to the oven and i followed the directions so perfectly...some of the things in the recipe need to be changed!!!!!!
