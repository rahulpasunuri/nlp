thanks to this recipe I am now famous for my thanksgiving pumpkin pie crust. I fooled it up and didnt precook the crust in my haste...and it was still amazing! Kudos!

Amazing pie , I have even converted previous anti-pumpkin pie people. I have been making this pie annually since 1997 with rave reviews every time. The topping is what makes the pie especially good, I even use the streusel topping for banana breads. The crust is so easy to work with but I prefer to double it as cooking it in advance and then cooking the pie makes it too crunchy crust for my taste. Otherwise I do follow this recipe exactly. (I often use canned pumpkin and evap milk but I do use the spice per this recipe instead)

This pumpkin pie filling is superb! I've been making this recipe for more than 10 years and it is an absolute favorite with the entire family. Don't ruin it by trying to make it low fat. It's perfect just as it is. My only complaint - I've tried making the crust MANY times without success. I'm the baker in the family and I've made many crusts in my lifetime (I'm 47) and this one ALWAYS shrinks. I follow the instructions using chilled ingredients and have tried many types of pie pans to no avail. Now I use my favorite pie dough recipe with vodka & water adding fresh ginger, sugar & cloves.

THIS PIE IS AMAZING!!! I make this pie every Thanksgiving and have since I got the magazine in 1994. I never make the crust, though, I buy the pre-made crusts and just roll them out (I know, I know... sacrilege!!) But I do think that it helps balance out the flavors - not too much ginger. I love all of the spices and the topping really makes for a wonderful spin on the otherwise boring pumpkin pie. I do, however, half the toppings because I find that it calls for way too much in the recipe. Favorite pie EVER!

I've been making this pie for over 10 years... always to rave reviews! It is a much requested part of the holidays. I have made it into mini pies for finger food. I make it exactly as written. (In a pinch one year I even used a store bought pumpkin pie and topped it with the streusel topping, and still got compliments) But the recipe here, for the crust with the fresh ginger and cloves, is totally worth it the effort. Even the kids gobble up this one!

My husband insisted on making a pumpkin pie for Christmas and I printed this recipe for him. We actually boiled fresh pumpkin instead of using the canned one. One challenge which we had was the water content of the pumpkin so the filling was very watery once mixed. I put a little flour, fresh ginger juice, more nutmeg, cinnamon and a touch of spice into it. The result was wonderful. We could not find the crystallized ginger, so we just added some finely grated ginger in the topping. Fantastic taste. We will definitely make again.

I would not make this pie again -- it simply didn't even taste like pumpkin pie. All of my guests for Thanksgiving thought it was a different kind of pie altogether. In addition, I was very excited about the topping, but for all the work, it just tasted like marshmallows. I make tons of pies and am always trying out new recipes -- this is definitely NOT a keeper.

Excellent pie! I made it without the topping (not enough time) and it was still delicious. I also used the "Flaky Pie Crust" recipe you find on this site. Perfect match.

A couple of Thanksgivings ago I was asked to bring a pumpkin pie to a dinner party. I thought that was a boring request, but politely promised the hostess I would do so. Found this receipe and thought it would be different. Everyone loves it and asks for the receipe. This pumpkin pie is now a holiday favorite.

much too sweet, but delicious if you cut back on streusel topping

Except for the fact that canned pumpkin comes in 15 oz cans not 16 oz. cans, this recipe is flawless. This is one of those recipes that you can follow to the letter. I've made this 5 times now, once with a fresh cheese pumpkin which blew everyone away.

My new holiday favorite! Great for days after being made. I only had a cup of whipping cream, and it worked just fine. I didn't have the crystallized ginger, but the ground ginger was tasty enough in the struedel. I cheated and used a store crust. No more boring pumpkin pie!!

Using a store bought graham cracker crust to save time, I made the filling and topping for Christmas this year. For the topping, I added about 3/4c. of ground gingersnap cookies to the mix and it came out perfect! The topping texture was crunchy, crumbly, and delicious. There was plenty of it to pile on top too. The filling had a very creamy and smooth texture. I was expecting firmer, more "cheesecake-like" consistency, but the creamier filling worked out fine too (my husband actually preferred it this way.) All and all I got great reviews and I was really happy with it. I'm tempted to make it again soon, so I don't have to wait until Thanksgiving to have it again!

I will make this one every year from now on. It is one of the best pumpkin pies I have ever eaten.

This pie was a big hit at Thanksgiving this year. I made two whole pies and 12 mini pies in a muffin pan but only one batch of streusel and still threw a lot of streusel out. I thought that the spices and the amount of pumpkin were perfect. It was way better than buying a pumpkin pie at the store and definitely worth the effort.

Rating: 1
We thought this was a terrible pie--the crust was fine but the filling was a sweet, pale foam with only the slightest hint of pumpkin flavouring, even after I doubled the amount of pumpkin. If you want a pumpkin chiffon or a sort of inoffensive pumpkin cheesecake, this is your recipe, but it's not a pumpkin pie.

Rating: 4
This was great. I used a pate brisee crust instead of the ginger crust, only because I made my pie dough ahead of time, for Thanksgiving baking. I added some ground ginger to the streusel. We enjoyed the pie - the spice flavors came through well. As others have said the streusel portion is way more than enough for one pie. Better than your typical pumpkin pie, even without the topping.

Rating: 2
I did not like the crust -- too fussy and the texture wasn't appealing, and the streusel is just too much. I didn't use all the streusel and it still weighed down the pie. I was glad I made teh ultimate pumpkin pie with an all-butter crust on this same site. Not worth the effort.

Pumpkin pie was never a tradition in the UK and I was definitely not a fan when I came to Canada. This one is truly deeelicious. I made it first in Oct 95 for Canadian Thanksgiving with 10 friends. It has been a 'must have' ever since. I use a deep ceramic pie dish and pile on the Streusel...plenty for all so roll on tomorrow mmmmm... Bon appétit! and Happy Thanksgiving xx

I've been making this particular pumpkin pie for years now; no other will do for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Family and friends all request it every year. As another cook mentions, there's a ton of streusel with this recipe, but I agree that you can just go ahead and pile it on and it's delicious! (But if there's really too much to use on the pie, I've also been known to put some in the refrigerator and add it to instant oatmeal for a much yummier breakfast.)

I love pumpkin pie, but didn't know if I'd like a crumble topping on it... but it was very good. The ginger was a great flavor match to the pumpkin, and everyone deemed this one a "keeper".

An excellent pumpkin pie!! It takes a long time to make but the results are worth it. The blind baking produces a nice, crispy bottom crust. I like the full amount of streusel, it's so tasty. The filling is light and fluffy.

Rating: 4
We made this filling and the streusel with a traditional pie crust this Thanksgiving, and thought it was superb! As other reviews have mentioned, it makes too much streusel for one pie, plus I would prefer it to be more gingery, so next time I plan to reduce the butter, sugar, and flour while maintaining the same amount of ginger and nuts. But even as is, this recipe really kicks pumpkin pie up a couple of notches. I'm looking forward to next Thanksgiving!

Every year since 1994 I have made this pie for Thanksgiving. It is a family favorite tradition! One year I made it for a church pie auction. It claimed the highest price tag, going for a whopping $56.00. Everyone who ate it wanted the recipe!

Rating: 3
Tasty, but not as good as I remembered it from when I made it last year. Then again, there was no Libby's style ordinary pumpkin pie to compare it with this year. I used the flaky pie crust recipe from this website, just about doubled the spices and made the pumpkin puree from scratch. I agree with other reviewers who felt there was *way* too much streusel topping; next time I would decrease it by half or perhaps even more -- also it needed more nuts and crystallized ginger and less flour. If you don't make the gingersnap crust, be sure to add some ground ginger to the filling.

Rating: 4
Not a great lover of pumkin pie to begin with, but this is a recipe we would use and serve again. We shopped late and could not buy the can of pumpkin pie filling - used a small sugar pumpkin from scratch. The only mistake that we made was not realizing we should have used cheese cloth to squeeze out the excess liguid in the filling - we compensated by cooking longer and added the topping once the pie was firmer. This is a winner!

I thought the crust on this pie was awful; and I had high hopes for it because of all of the spices and ginger that went into it. It was too hard and tastless. Tere is a good chance I left it in the oven too long, I was concerned about the filling not being cooked enough, but in the process, the crust seemed to get over done. The filling was so so, not great.

I usually don't bake but made this exception. I decided upon the ginger snap crust as others had (so easy, too.) Guests requested to take some home with them. Would make again.

This is great. I don't know what crystallized ginger is so I bought some syrup-marinated ginger instead so I mixed it with some soft ginger candy. I also did not put any ground ginger because I don't want to buy it just for the pie but it still turns out great. Will make this again next week.

Made the exact recipe as printed. Beware: You really need to give this a day to mellow. My daughter ate it a few hours after baking and said it was too spicy (the ginger), but the next day marveled at how good it tasted. We loved it. Will be our standard pumpkin pie. Didn't have any trouble with too much filling. There is a lot of streusel, but I piled every crumb on top. Yum. You could probably cut the streusel quantities in half, but I say go for the whole thing!

Made this for Thanksgiving for a friend who is a big fan of ginger, to rave reviews. The crust had a nice hot ginger bite to it, which was balanced by the creaminess of the filling. The streusel topping was an unusual texture addition, but proved popular. No one touched the "traditional" pumpkin pie I'd made as a back-up!

Made this for Thanksgiving and my friends would not stop talking about it! I used only one can of canned pumpkin (15 oz) and still had some to discard. I thought the crust required some diligence in the pre-baking stage but WOW, was it worth it. An absolute must for the Thanksgiving table. I will certainly make it next year.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and, as a dry run, for a dinner party the weekend before. It was a huge hit; "best pumpkin pie I've ever had" was the comment by several, before asking for the recipe. I made the the ginger snap crust used with the chiffon pumpkin pie recipe also available on Epicurious, and everyone loved the strong ginger presence. I made the streusel topping in the food processor.

Pie filling and topping very tasty and enjoyed by all. Not sold on the crust, and recipe seemed to make not quite enough to roll out to 12". Fussy to handle as well. Substituted another crust recipe and very pleased with results. Didn't use all of the topping prepared...made a lot! Filling was easy and very light and fluffy in texture.

This was good, but not as fabulous as the reviews led me to believe. It does have a "lighter"-tasting filling, which can be refreshing after a heavy meal. I agree that the recipe calls for more topping than necessary.

The simplicity and integrity of a pumpkin pie is overwhelmed by the overly sweet and overly abundent topping in this recipe, of which I only used half and felt it was still too much. The pumpkin filling itself is fine, but that topping ruined it for me. Not a winner for this experienced, experimental and open-minded cook!

This has become an absolute must at my Thanksgiving, and even people who aren't wild about pumpkin pie rave about this one. My family loves it so much that I now make big batches of crystallized ginger so that I'll always have it on hand!

I can see why this recipe has such great reviews. I made it this weekend, pie crust and all, and it was certainly a step up from the traditional pumpkin pie. The filling is fluffier and less dense than the traditional pumpkin pie filling. The topping reminds me of an apple crisp topping. The pie crust wasn't too troublesome to make, you just combine all the ingredients in a food processor, though the need to take it in and out of the fridge and oven makes it somewhat troublesome. I must say, though this recipe is delicious, it's much more fattening than your traditional pumpkin pie - it calls for a lot of butter, cream, and more butter.

Wow this was the best pie i've ever made. Very creamy and flavorful. The ginger adds a really nice zing. I put some almond meal in the food processor with some spices and cut in a little butter, pressed it into a pie dish and baked it for 12 mins to set before adding the filling. It went very well!

I just won the local pumpkin pie contest with this recipe (3 course dinner for 4 cooked by a local chef). I used the filling and streusel from this recipe except I made the filling the night before and let it sit overnight for the flavours to develop which I think makes a difference. I used the flaky pie crust recipe from the June 2002 (I think, it's on the website) Bon Appetit. The judges said the pie was superb and the pastry was spectacular. Highly recommended.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and everyone loved it. My only substitution was to use evaporated skim milk instead of heavy cream, but I also served it with whipped cream. Like Allison, I noted that the streusel topping seemed like twice what was pictured, but I used ALL of it, and it really was excellent...not too sweet at all, and it added nice texture. I was concerned as I handled the crust, which I found to be very soft; but it turned out well. A most unusual combination of flavors and textures, and the perfect finale to an occasion such as Thanksgiving.

This is the pumpkin pie recipe I keep going back to. I used it the first time in 1994, when it came out in the Thanksgiving issue, and got RAVE reviews. Thought about trying something different the following year, but wasn't allowed to. EVERY member of the family said to stick with this one. Now all my kids are having their own families, and THEY make this recipe for Thanksgiving - its now a family tradition. The only alteration I have made is that I use fresh Japanese pumpkin - baked in halves, NOT boiled, then puree it when its cold. Do this a couple of days in advance and you will taste the difference.

I made this pie last year for my husband who is a big pumpkin pie fan. Everyone loved it including me and I don't like traditional pumpkin pie! I didn't have time to do the crust, just used a plain one I had on hand and it was still very good. Will try the crust this time.

This pie is delicious. The crust has an excellent texture, the filling is creamy, and the topping is a unique and festive touch.

incredibly good pie!!! It was eaten by all at Thanksgiving, and everyone wanted to take some home with them. I did use a regular Pillsbury pie crust to save time, and it was good, I will try the recipe next time though. To save time, I mixed all the dry ingredients for the filling in a baggie that I labelled, so it was quick to mix up the day before. I did the same with the streusel topping. I served it with some whipped cream with a little cinnamon in it - delicious. I will be making this every year! ***One tip I have to pass on- buy the crystallized ginger at Williams - Sonoma. It is $5 for 7 ounces- versus $8 for 2 ounces in a small jar at the grocery store!!
