First, I made it following the recipe - no substitutions. The fish was good, but why not put the rice flakes on both sides of the fish. My eaters did not eat the skin side so all that flavor was somewhat wasted. The sauce is probably really good to someone wholikes coconut. I had hoped with making a puree out of it, the texture of the coconut would not come through, but it did. That is just my personal preference, so your mileage may vary. Otherwise, the sauce is good. It is spicy, so govern yourself accordingly. Considering the work it took to find tamarind paste and rice flakes, I don't think it was worth it.
