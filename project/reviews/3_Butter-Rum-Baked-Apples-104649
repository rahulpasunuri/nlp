This is a nice light dessert for winter. I didn't include any ice cream or whipped cream, but I think this stands on its own. The cloves and lemon give the dish some nice layers of flavor.

I didn't think this recipe tasted as remarkable as it sounds. It might be better with some doctoring to the sauce.

Nice baked apples. I used brandy instead of rum and they were lovely. Vanilla ice-cream is not a must, but my husband likes them with it.

Very yummy and simple! A scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side and it was the perfect light dessert to a big meal.

Made this last night-cooked it in the microwave for 10 minutes. Great-especially on a cold, damp evening. I added a few chopped nuts and raisins in the filling and doubled the syrup mixture. Will def. make again
