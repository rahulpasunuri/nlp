Delicious!This is a perfect winter dinner party dish. It makes enough to feed a crowd and can be made in advance. I made two minor substitutions based on what I had on hand: dried chanterelles instead of porcini and pancetta instead of prosciutto; incidentally, these subs likely brought the total cost of the dish down. Next time I'm going to try with wide noodles instead of gnocchi.

very pleasant, but not extraordinary. the porcini get lost among the tomatoes, & in my opinion it all ends up tasting like a very good... sausage & mushroom pizza. which is great, and maybe my sausage was just too sausagey, but it just didn't seem worth it to me. in my local shop porcini are about $50 a pound, so if i use a whole ounce of them i'd like to taste it more than i do here.

This is amazing! It is very expensive to make, what with the porcini mushrooms, prosciutto, fresh basil, 3/4 bottle of wine, etc., but I will definitely be making it again when I can afford to. I made my own favorite recipe for the gnocchi, but I prepared the ragu just as instructed here (well, okay, I doubled the prosciutto), and it was scrumptious! Make sure to use country-style ribs cut from the pork shoulder rather than the loin, trim them before weighing, and observe the instuction to cook until tender (which took longer than the suggested hour in my case).

I was unimpressed. This recipe is very tomato-heavy, and therefore the other ingredients' flavors just didn't shine through. It would have been better with less tomato and more garlic and herbs/spices.

I really enjoyed making this, but wasn't totally happy with the end result. I found the flavors to be a little murky. I tried "brightening" it with a little lemon juice, but still wasn't totally happy with the result.

Great flavor. Don't skip the porcini mushrooms...I think they made the dish.

Really delicious and not difficult. I used chanterelles because I couldn't find porcini and softened them in chicken broth instead of water. I left the pork in to cook all the way through instead of removing it. The pork was very tender, flavors were great, sausage was subtle, crimini were juicy. Yum.

This is the best pork dish I have ever had

This was a great recipe the night of and even better the next day. I served the leftovers over soft polenta with a dollop of goat cheese. It was so good that I'm serving it this way from now on.

First let me say that I am not good at working with any dough, whether it be pie dough, pizza dough, pasta dough, etc., but I do enjoy a good challenge, and encouraged by prior reviews of this recipe, I took a deep breath and dug in. The mere fact that the gnocchi could be made in advance lifted my spirits because then I knew if I failed, I could always go out and buy gnocchi at the supermarket. Well, I was in for a surprise because not only was the gnocchi easy to make, the end result were these soft, little bundles of deliciousness which when combined with the extrordinary ragu, made for a superior dining experience. In fact, it was so good the first time, I made the ragu again the following weekend when guests were here, only this time, due to time constraints, I used store bought cavatappi instead of gnocchi which was just as good. I am, however, looking forward to the next time my hands meet dough and produce a heavenly result.

Bruce Aidell's develops the best recipes! Ethereal gnocchi with a delicious sauce. (I even think the flavor of the sauce was even better, when it sat as a leftover.) Just delicious. Definitely a keeper-great warm dish for a cold, wintery day.

Wow! Made this recipe for a dinner party I hosted two weeks ago and the guests are still raving! It has been short-listed on the must make again and again list. Because the party size was large, I doubled the recipe without any issue (eventually using two stock pots). Even then guests licked the bowls and pots clean.

This was absolutely delicious! I will definitely be making this again in the future. I made the crimini mushrooms ahead and then forgot to add them to the ragu until we sat down at the table to eat, so I would also suggest making them while things simmer. I made the gnocchi also...it didn't turn out to be that great, but it was my first time making gnocchi.

My wife and I cooked this as a Valentine's Day gift to each other. What a treat! Spent the morning shopping for ingredients (and flowers!) at Eastern Market and the afternoon cooking. It was a perfect match for what we wanted - a work-intensive meal that we could do as a couple that culminated in an awesome dish. We made our gnocchi using the linked recipe and it turned out great (and we've definitely screwed up gnocchi before). Paired with Sauteed Brussels Sprouts with Lemon and Pistachios. I'll second the comments about how the timing in the recipe is a little odd, I cooked the baby bella mushrooms in the wine at the very end and then added to the ragu. No harm done. (Due to some dietary restrictions, we dropped garlic and onion from the recipe--again, didn't stop us from having a great meal).

This dish is incredible. Making it again for a dinner party!! Used store bought gnocchi.

I really enjoyed both making and eating this dish. My gnocchi didn't turn out quite so well, but I followed another recipe that I found on the web. It included ricotta cheese; so, I thought it might make a lighter, more nicely textured gnocchi. Well, I was wrong, and my gnocchi fell apart after 1 min in the boiling water. That being said, the ragu was great! Very flavorful and fun to make. Like another reviewer said, you can prepare the baby bella mushroom mixture while while the pork/porcini mixture is simmering. This will save some time. I also did not need to simmer for 1 hr the recipe called for-probably about 45min or maybe a little less. I will certainly make this again, but next time I will try this gnocchi recipe or cheat and get some from the store.

Oooh, yum! It is a lot of prep, but it is sooo worth it. Mind you, I had to cheat and use store bought gnocchi and it was still quite a bit of prep. I love cooking, though, so I didn't mind. I did modify the recipe a little, too--did not use any carrot or celery, which allowed me to cut down the cook time a little (did not need the cover pot cook 8mn step). I chose to simmer the sauce at a slightly higher temp for a shorter time and added only a little more wine once it had reduced somewhat. Simmer time was closer to 45mn and it tasted delightful. I did not make it ahead, so did not get nor need to skim off nay fat from the surface (used cast iron pot, so that may have something to do with it, too). Highly recommend this recipe and will sooooo make again! Served it by itself, no sides, just a lovely Bordeaux wine :)

Forgot to mention this on my earlier review: To save time, I held off preparing the crimini mushrooms until I got the ragu simmering for the one hour. Then I went back to the second paragraph in the recipe and prepared the mushrooms while the ragu was working its magic with the pork...it was just a little more time efficient that way.

Made it. Loved it! I cheated and used store bought gnocchi, but hey, sometimes you just run out of time to do it all! It was wonderful all the same. I have to say, it looked just like the photo in the Feb 2010 issue. It's a keeper!

Absolutely perfect! Such a blend of flavors and textures with wonderful creamy textured gnocchi; great comfort food. A lot of preparation time but totally worth all the effort.

This was sublime and my first attempt at homemade gnocchi. The pork ragu is fabulous and the gnocchi turned out well. Now having made gnocchi and surfing other recipes, I think next time I will use either the whole egg or add 2 T. whipping cream. I believe the dough will be easier to work with. I have now ordered a potato ricer online as I do plan to continue making gnocci. If you like to cook, a fun way to spend some time in the kitchen!

Delicious recipe. Lots of flavor on the plate. Only change I'll make in the future is to saute the gnocchi to give it a bit of texture. Other than that, it goes into my favorite recipe book.

I made this last night and it was fantastic! I had never made gnocchi in any form but this turned out perfectly. The recipe was challenging and fun to make, definitely a weekend recipe. Attention to detail is required. Huge hit in this house last night and we have plenty left over for tonight. I highly recommend this recipe.

Made this last night - it was fantastic. I had never made gnocchi in any form at all and it turned out perfectly. It was a fun and challenging recipe to make (definitely a weekend recipe). Attention to detail is key - but it was a huge hit in this house last night, and there is a lot left over. I would highly recommend this one!
