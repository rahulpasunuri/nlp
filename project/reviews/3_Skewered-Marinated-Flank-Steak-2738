Must've done something wrong. The only thing I omitted was the parsley and the meat came out tough and bland. It just didn't taste good. On to other things!

I really liked this meal. It was a favorite at the table with my very picky eaters. The pepper actually gave it a bit of a kick. Very good, I will definitely be making this dish again.

Much better than I expected after smelling the marinade! I will definitely make this recipe again, possibly for a casual dinner for guests.

This was delicious. I added peppers to the skewered beef and cooked it on the grill. Next time I will halve the oil, there was no need for so much.

Marinated overnight - very good. Next time I will use just a little less wine (maybe 1/4 cup) as we found it a little overpowering. Not a bad thing though, just means more wine for drinking :) Cheers.

I have been searching for a good steak marinade for kebabs for a loooong time. This one is delicious! I marinated for about 6 hours but would rather have done it overnight. I quadrupled the recipe for company, and found that it made much more marinade than was necessary. Our guests raved about it and I am glad to call off my search.

This was a great marinade. I used sirloin and marinated it over night. I also added asparagus to the marinade for 30 minutes or so. The steak was cut into chunks and grilled on skewers along with the asparagus. Very delicious!

We made these for a party along with a number of other items and these were gone as fast as we could cook them, make sure to marinate them for a long time, I have had so many people ask for the recipe!

The flank steak was tender but the sauce was rather bland.

Not quite anichucho--not quite satay--- not quite fajitas---but not bad. Went over well with my guests. It doesn't matter what you call a cow with no legs cause it won't come when you call it.

what cow with 2 legs called? lean beef! What do you call a cow with no legs? ground beef!

This recipe provides a very economical way to serve a large crowd, such as at a summer barbecue. Marinating the meat overnight ensures maximum tenderness, and serving small skewered portions allows each person to take exactly how much they want. This dish was a huge hit with all of my guests.
