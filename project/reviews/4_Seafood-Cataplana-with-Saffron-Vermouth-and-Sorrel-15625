This is a great recipe! I have made it 5 times so far and have mixed it up a few times now. I have made it with no cream at all and actually prefer it this way. In addition to the clam juice, I have added a can of chopped clams and crabmeat to the broth. This drew very positive statements from guests! This is a gem recipe!

Complex and rich but not too heavy, this is seafood saffron perfection. Substituted sea scallops for the crayfish and added them with the shrimp. Fantastic. You must try this recipe!

This was fantastic!We substituted scallops and cod fillets for the clams and crayfish and it turned out great with lots of flavour.We went to Portugal last year and had it there and it was even better! We will keep this recipe and play around with the ingrediants.

This is a lovely complex dish. I substituted silken tofu pureed with clam broth for heavy cream. This bumped the calorie count down to fitting in with my Weight Watchers diet. I also substituted spinach for sorrel (couldn't find it), and sea scallops for crawfish (couldn't find crab claws, I would have gone that direction instead). It makes six portions, not four. It takes 2 hours to prepare, depending on how quick you are at scrubbing, debearding, and shelling I guess. I can't wait to have the leftovers tonight! Mmmm...
