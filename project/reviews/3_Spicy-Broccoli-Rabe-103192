We like this particular recipe un-blanched.With some other Rabe recipes, I would blanch,but sometime greens just need to be a little bitter to complement the other sweetness(es) in a recipe, i.e. the Red Pepper. Another way to add some sweet/tang aspect would be some good balsamic vinegar.

this has become my favorite broccoli rabe recipe. I do blanch it, as the previous reviewer suggested, in the chicken broth. I saute the garlic and red pepper separately, then add the drained rabe to it along with a more generous amount of the red pepper flakes. I have even converted my mother to this recipe and she's Italian!

I would blanch the rabe (cut 2 inches off the stems first, then chop the rest into 2-inch pieces) for 3 minutes to get rid of the bitterness (the longer you blanch it the less bitter it is) and then proceed with the recipe. You can blanch it ahead of time first if that makes it easier.

This dish was very good, although I found the broccoli rabe to be a bit bitter.
