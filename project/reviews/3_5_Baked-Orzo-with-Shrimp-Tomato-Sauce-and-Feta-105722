This is an excellent recipe. I use a large onion and increase the garlic to 4 cloves. I also increase the oregano to 1-2 tsp and the hot pepper flakes to 1 tsp. I also use 2 lbs of shrimp. Delish!

An easy go-to I have made several times. I love the convenience of this casserole style dish, it's so easy to have these ingredients on hand, and much less predictable than serving a lasagna.

Delicious! My hubby made this last night and since it's only two of us, he cut it in half and it STILL served 6. The only substitution was tomato puree instead of crushed tomatoes and was very flavorful.

Good, not great. I made this with a bag of Trader Joe's mixed frozen seafood - shrimp, calamari, and scallops - and I'm glad I did, since the squid and scallops actually turned out much better than the shrimp, which were a little too chewy for my taste. If I were to make this again, I'd use at least twice as much spice, as well as a healthy dose of lemon juice to brighten it up. On the plus side, this makes a tremendous amount of food, and the tomato sauce is nice and tangy.

i thought this was good, not outstanding but good...i added more garlic, oregano, hot peppers and olives than called for, but still felt it needed more, esp the olives. i used fresh mozzeralla for about 50% of the feta which added to the creaminess. i bought the larger sized shrimp and found that 1.5 pounds was not enough, as it seemed like too much orzo relative to the protein (shrimp), so next time i will reduce the orzo or increase the shrimp. i might also sub vermouth for the white wine and add some fresh herbs. i think it's a great potluck dish..hearty and tasty...easy to make and transport. can make it up to the point of baking it, and do that at the last 15 minutes which makes it convenient. it's a keeper with some tweaking.

Outstanding -- the best of many similar recipes. The olives are a nice touch (don't over do them, though). Works fine with the milder cow's milk feta. Tasty leftovers for the next day's lunch. And try Crystal hot sauce instead of red pepper flakes, for a nice vinegary tang.

This is a great meal. The better your ingredients, the better this will taste.

This dish is so easy to make! It has become one of my "regulars" when I am craving comfort food. My only suggestion is to add more garlic and seasoning for the best flavors.

Addictive! While I love shrimp, I'm single and they don't re-heat well. Instead I used a chopped can of artichoke hearts (drained) - I halved the recipe. I didn't have crushed tomatoes, so I used tomato sauce. Struggled to keep myself from going back for seconds.

Yum! I will definitely make this again. I followed the recommendations of the earlier reviewers and increased the garlic, oregano and red pepper flakes in the sauce. I also used 2 lbs of shrimp (since I had a 2-lb bag in the freezer). I cut back on the feta cheese to 8 oz. Next time, I'll probably go back to at least 12 oz. I used a high quality imported feta, which was very creamy. I would definitely not skimp on the quality of the cheese since I think this made the dish.

great - I skipped the olives and added a small can of diced tomoatos along with the large can of crushed tomatos. big hit!

This recipe is excellent- I have made it for guests multiple times, and everyone has loved it! I have found that cutting the feta by about a third works very well.

This is one of my favorite dinners. I have to disagree with the review from seattle. It's very appetizing, I like the way the feta actually holds its shape, it's full of flavor, and reheats well. I cut down on the feta. I use, maybe, 1/2 - 1 cup and that's plenty. Add some hot sauce, too.

Very good for large parties. Easy to make one day ahead. Used this to stuff peppers for a dinner party for 8 ppl and still had leftover pasta.

This is a wonderful dish; we have enjoyed it numerous times! I prefer to make it with fresh Mozzarella rather than Feta. Mozzarella melts better and isn't a salty as the Feta.

This dish ended up very heavy and unappetizing. The feta never came close to melting and it congealed into a brick-like mess in the fridge. Very bland flavors - nothing I'd make again.

I stuffed this into green peppers as an AWESOME first course for sit down dinner party. FABULOUS

My husband made this for dinner last night and it was FABULOUS! He is a recipe follower and so didn't modify anything as far as ingredients and quantities - but had to bake the dish for an additional 10 minutes then allow it to rest for 10 more minutes before serving. He used frozen rock shrimp from Trader Joe's and it was just right. Wonderful, delicious and we'll definitely make it again. It would be great on a buffet too - good idea for the upcoming holidays. Enjoy!

The spices were great. Of course I doubled the spices and threw in a head of garlic. My problem was that the dish came out too much like a casserole. Next time, I'm going to toss all the ingredients together and forgo the baking.

This pasta ROCKS! I do understand why some people might think this is a bland dish. There are a lot of bad olives and feta out there. Those two ingredients really make the dish. The canned ripe black olive variety will result in blandness. I used real Kalamata olives, and a French sheep's milk feta (my fave). I make this dish often, but in smaller quantities.

Halfed recipe but not garlic. Used fire-roasted tomatoes because that's all they had at the co-op that day. Added a nice smoky flavor, but I'd try regular next time. There will definitely be a next time. So easy, so good! Perfect for weeknights or for casual company. Makes a lot - with 1/2 the recipe it fed 2 people for dinner, then for 2-3 lunches each! Good as leftovers, too.

We halved this recipe (except the spices), and it was great! Next time we make it, we'll try mozzerella - my husband thought it was too salty from the feta even though we didn't put any salt in it at all, but there are a lot of salty ingredients in it! I would have liked more olives, but my husband thought there were just enough.

This dish is great! It's easy to prepare and flavorful. I would say more olives, but my partner who is not an olive fan disagrees. That is what is great with this recipe: you can experiment with other ideas. I used fat free feta, and that worked perfectly.

My friends and I really liked this recipe. I used goat cheese instead of feta and it tasted great! The goat cheese melted much better and was more flavorful. I also added salt to the crushed tomatoes.

Great recipe. I keep making it and it keeps delighting my friends. I somewhat agree w/the criticism on the bland flavors, but I get around this by the following: use extra onions and garlic and cook longer to caramelize; use extra tomatoes (2x) and wine (2x-3x) then slowly reduce to thicken the sauce and concentrate the flavors. Also, salt the water for the orzo (obviously), and make sure the sauce is seasoned well. Use plenty of feta and good Kalamata, not canned, olives. Drizzle with a good peppery EVOO just before serving. Good the day after too - if you can leave it that long.

I agree that this was bland and boring. Despite all the good stuff in this recipe, it really lacked flavor. I made this for my husband and father, and the most they could muster was the word, "interesting."

This was excellent. It took a little longer to prepare than suggested, but it was well worth the additional time. I add slightly more olive oil than called for and I also used a little more oregeno. A real winner! I suggest using crushed tomatoes in extra puree.

I made a very similar recipe from Bon Appetite April 2002 and it was excellent. The variations from this recipe were: mixing tomato/basil feta with the orzo; cooking the shrimp first then arranging ontop of the orzo; spooning the tomato mixture ontop of the shrimp and baking for 10 minutes; sprinkling more feta ontop & serve. My very finicky sister loved this recipe so much she asked me to send it to her...now that's a keeper!

We really liked this! Used fresh oregano and added diced canned artichoke hearts. It had more flavor depth than I anticipated. Be sure to look for canned tomatoes marked "San Marzano," which are the best.

Very nice recipe. I had Orzo hanging around and needed to use it up. This was simple to make and feeds a lot of people. Will make again.

Simple and delicious and can be made a few hours before serving. Made minor changes: used a little more olive oil for cooking the onions and doubled the red pepper flakes; left out olives only because I dislike them cooked. After adding shrimp to sauce, reduced cooking time to 2 minutes. I served this with a salad and warm crusty bread. Everyone loved it!

This was very tasty. I used my frozen oregano, and it went very well with all the other ingrediants. I like the recipe so much I made it the next week with cut up chicken. That also turned out very nice.

This was ok, much better the next day, but not out of the ordinary or exciting in any way. If I make it again, I think I'll just leave out the shrimp, grill them on the side, maybe. They seemed to be hidden in the strong flavors which were otherwise good (properly melded with a day's age, as I said.) DON'T try to do with fat free feta - it just gets hard and crusty (duh.)

Rating: 3
I used half the feta to cut down on fat, and it still turned out mighty tasty. The only thing I'd change is maybe doubling up on the red peppers or oregano, as others have suggested. Overall I was pretty surprised that so few ingredients could blend to such tasty results!

Rating: 4
We loved this dish! Instead of orzo, I used penne pasta. Because shrimp cooks so quickly and can get rubbery, I did not cook it before I added it to the pasta and tomato mixture. At 425, 15 minutes is long enough for the shrimp to cook with out it being over-cooked. My feta melted and became creamy. YUM! I have already made this twice with the same excellent results.

Doesn't taste like aything? Wow. Mine sure tasted good, but then again, I followed my basic cooking tenant: "always double all the good stuff listed in a recipe." First, I left out the shrimp as I was using this as a side dish. Second, I doubled all the aromatics, seasonings and olives. Third, I used 12 ounces of feta in the middle and 8 ounces of goat cheese on the top. Fourth, I boiled the orzo in well-salted water. Finally, I added a full cup of pasta water to the tomato sauce as I was making this a day before I planned to bake it and I didn't want it to dry out. Popped it in a 375* oven for an hour and it turned out great. Spicy and flavorful. Served with home-made, grilled lamb patties topped with a touch of Major Grey's Mango Chutney, and a cold, cucumber/yoghurt/mint salad, and an Hardy's Australian Shiraz. Perfect!

Did not make this recipe but made similar ones. One thing I learned in 20 years of cooking, oregano and shrimp don't go well together, try tarragon, white pepper, mint, parsley or saffron. Also for added flavor you can add a chili pepper. Please cut down in half the amount of orzo. Feta needs a good half hour in the oven to melt.

Okay, so it's not gonna knock your tastebuds out, but this is a good, simple pasta casserole that can easily be dressed up. I used extra red pepper, extra olives, and some anchovy paste to give it more flavor and would spice it up further the next time around. Best part is how easy it is and that I've got enough leftover to last for another week.

I've made this 3 times now and it was well received each time. I used a little less feta and a little more red pepper to make it spicier. Fast, easy, and makes great leftovers. This dish easily feeds eight. Will definitely make again (and again).

I have not made this dish yet. I too don't care for bland food but I just can't imagine that this dish will taste bland if done correctly and following the recipe as so many people don't !!! Every time I read readers reviews I notice that they omit ingredients or add things that should not be in the recipe and then they judge.

Though I haven't made THIS specific recipe, I just wanted to let the cook from Virginia know that this is a classic Greek recipe, from the people that brought us feta. So, the feta addition is nothing new to this recipe but rather, traditional.

Rating: 1
This was disappointing, probably because feta doesn't melt and become one with the other ingredients during baking. Instead, it just gets harder, and the pasta and shrimp get dry. I often toss cooked linguine with feta, cooked or fresh tomatoes, olive oil, shrimp, and herbs, with a much better result.
