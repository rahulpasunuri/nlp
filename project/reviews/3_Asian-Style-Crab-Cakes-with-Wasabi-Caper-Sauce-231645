I wanted a sauce for seared tuna. I found the mayo to be too heavy of a mayo taste despite adding 1-2 T. fresh lemon juice..also to thin the sauce. Pinch of salt and extra wasabi to taste. Next time will try creme freche, plain yogurt or sour cream.

Wasabi caper sauce was fabulous served with seared, marinated ahi tuna. Didn't try the crabcakes.

Excellent! I doubled all the ingredients except the crab. Still very crabby and I had more of them to go around.

The sauce was good but I wasn't very impressed with the cakes.

I enjoyed this recipe very much. the crab cakes were easy to cook. sauce may need some lemon and capers are optional. I left out the ginger as well. Pete, you inspired me to add asian ingredients in my everyday recipes!
