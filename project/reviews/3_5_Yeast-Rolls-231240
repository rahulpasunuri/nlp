I thought the bones of this recipe were good, although it did need some tweaking. I added 2 Tbls of sugar to the flour, in addition to an extra 1/2 tsp salt. I wasn't dure that I had a ful tblsp of honey since it was the last of the honeybear bottle, which is why I had a heavy hand with the sugar. I used a previous reviewr's tip for the wash (one egg yolk and an equal amount of cream) and sprinkled with sesame seeds and cracked pepper. My family loved it.

I made these again recently, when I wanted to serve grilled sausages in buns. Instead of shaping into 18 small rolls I divided the dough into 6, formed a hotdog size roll, and baked off. They were better than anything I could have bought in any bakery - very light, tender and flavourful.

I made these using my bread machine up to the first rising and then followed the directions. I did substitute 1/2 cup of King Arthur white whole wheat flour and they were still very light. I sprinkled coarse salt and sesame seeds on some of the rolls which helped with flavor. For an easy recipe, I would recommend over any store bought roll.

These rolls are very easy to make and they do come out with a nice, tender consistency. But the are so BORING! They just don't have very much flavor. While they are tender, they are not very fluffy. Overall, I think there are better recipes out there for yeast rolls.

Very easy recipe. Rolls are light and tender. I increased salt and added a scant 1/4 cup of sugar for a better taste. Rolls form well, bake well and had great flavor. Easy to make.

I made these wonderful rolls for my Christmas party this year and everyone raved about them saying they were the best rolls they had ever had!

These were fine and I think the recipe is fairly easy and fool-proof, however they were fairly bland, perhaps as they are supposed to be. My kids loved them, but I had hoped for something more buttery and irresistible somehow. Nevertheless, they are a perfectly acceptable dinner roll.

Easy recipe and rolls look great, not as much flavor as I would have like. Perhpas the added salt recommendation would help.

I made the first part of this (up to the end of the first rising) in my bread machine on the dough setting, then finished it as directed by hand. Came out well.

I followed the recipe to a "t" and my husband and I both thought the rolls were just so-so. Edible, but not worth making again.

These are great rolls. They are simple, yet elegant. I made these last year for the holidays and people were quite impressed with homemade dinner rolls, usually everyone spends so much time on the main meals that you usually end up with store bought rolls. If you have time, or can make them ahead of time, it's a nice touch, and there is really nothing like homemade bread.

This is an easy and good recipe, I made it exactly as the recipe states the first time, and while it was good, it was better in later batches with the addition of another 1/2 tsp salt. I also like to vary the shape, and prefer the egg wash made with just the yolk mixed with an equal amount of cream. Poppy seeds or black sesame seeds add a nice touch.

like this recipe, but I think I will add a little more sugar and a little less sugar to it.

in two words: easy and wonderful!! I used this recipe to make cinnamon rolls and it turn out to be fantastic. I'm sure I'll make it again.

WOW! These rolls are absolutely fabulous. I cut the butter into the flour instead of melting it but otherwise made the recipe as is. This is a really soft dough and makes a really soft roll. They melt in your mouth. I still can't believe I made something so good!
