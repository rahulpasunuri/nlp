Lamb I have better recipes for but, the cabbage dish is good though more complicated than it needs to be. Delete the wine entirely and don't over steam the cabbage and you have a hit! Works well with any German sausage and my fondest memories are from such a restaurant in Calgary. They served it with dumplings and it was heavenly. I would not pair this with lamb.

I only made the cabbage portion of the recipe and paired it with the Honey Glazed Lamb (sublime!) on this site. This recipe was not worth the expense (Creme de Cassis, wine, balsamic vinegar, etc.) or time, as it got so-so reviews. Perhaps a true cabbage fanatic would be more enthused.

I confess, I didn't make this lamb recipe but I borrowed the spiced cabbage side dish to accompany the cardamom-scented lamb recipe from this website. It was perfect, with the maple mashed sweet potato it made a beautiful presentation. A great alternative to the usual Thanksgiving fare.

Definitely a company dish and easy to make. The cabbage added a wonderful flavor and can be made with other dishes. We had it for dinner this evening and my husband gave me 4 stars. We will have this for dinner again soon.
