to cut the fat content we didn't use any half and half, just non (low)- fat chicken broth. So easy and delicious.

Loved it - added some grilled chicken to it. Would definitely make it again. If you prefer a very creamy sauce, just use heavy cream but I thought it was nice with the half & half.

I made this without the broth, just toss hot pasta on top of arugula, chopped tomato tossed with olive oil, salt & pepper and add a bit more olive oil & grated parmesan. Fresh & fast and really tasty.

I thought this was wonderful. I left out the arugula and topped each serving with a sliced chicken breast hot off the grill since my husband is not one for meatless dishes. The sauce was so good my four-year-old even enjoyed it.

Too much arugula, it overwhelmed everything else. Needed more tomato. 1/2 and 1/2 did nothing for the dish. I won't make this one again.

excellent combination of ingredients, although for personal taste I never mix tomatoes and milk or cream so I left out the 1/2 and 1/2 As a chef I can assure you someone will steal this one
