VERY interesting flavours, terrific with goat cheese. Three notes: 1. chop the rosemary before processing (my food processor couldn't chop it finely enough and keep the mixture slightly coarse). 2. The final product is delicious but it looks ghastly, so beware! 3. It really needs time to blend the flavours, preferably overnight.

Awful. Too sweet, too much rosemary (it wasn't the right herb for this mixture at all) and the walnuts got soggy after it sat for a while. I have to find something else to make for my party.

I had almost no time to put this together, so I eyeballed all the portions. I used dried figs. It was too thick to puree, so I added water. The end result was wonderful. The guests raved about it. It went beautifully on pita with goat cheese. Make this recipe!

Fantastic& made this with dries figs and pine nuts, hand chopped to give it a more rustic texture, and it was delicious. The leftovers from Monday nights dinner party appetizer went on Tuesday nights chicken breast stuffed with goats cheese and it was 5 star!

I make this at the end of summer when figs are in season and freeze a batch for the holidays. I also tried it with green olives, green figs, and honey (in place of the pomegranate molasses) for a different look.

I made this recipe exactly as written except with pine nuts instead of walnuts due to allergies. I served it with crostinis spread with cream cheese and topped with the tapenade. Delicious!!

Must make if you have fresh figs and eat chicken. Rubbed the fresh tapenade under skin of chicken, rubbed skin of chicken with EVOO, fresh pepper and coarse salt, and roasted at 400 for almost an hour. Deglazed pan with white wine (thanks to previous reviewer). Restaurant quality dinner.

This recipe rocks! Simple, easy, flavorful. If you've ever tasted "Jimtown" brand Fig & Olive Tapenade (available at Whole Food etc., or at the Jimtown Grocery in Sonoma Co., CA); this recipe captures that flavor. You can find pomegranate molasses in most Middle Eastern grocery stores. If you store this in the 'fridge, letting it come to room temperature before serving really improves the flavor. I served this at a party last night (spread goat cheese on crackers and spooned the tapenade on top)...got rave reviews!

My friend made this the other night and stuffed it under the skin of a chicken before roasting it. After the chicken roasted one hour at 425 degrees, he deglazed the pan with chicken stock and white wine and finished it with a tablespoon of butter. That was served over the roast chicken with couscous. What a fabulous fall meal! It was easy and great. I will definitely make this again.

I couldn't find pomegranate molasses, so I used regular molasses and some honey. I also used pine nuts instead of walnuts. I loved this! Served with goat cheese, I think it is to die for. I received good response from most people that tried it, but found a lot of people didn't try it once they found out what was in it. If you like figs and olives, you'll enjoy this. Something out of the ordinary to serve with goat cheese.
