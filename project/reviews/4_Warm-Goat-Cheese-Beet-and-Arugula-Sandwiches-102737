Wonderful and light, perfect for summer. I also recommend roasting the beets yourself and followed the earlier suggestions to a T. Be prepared to make many more!

This is a beet salad in a sandwich! It's light, flavorful and pretty. After making this a few times, I have to say that roasting fresh beets is the only way to go, unless you're very time-constrained.

This recipe is always a crowd pleaser. I roast my own beets (which is cheaper and very easy) but otherwise the recipe is absolutely perfect as is. It's a great way to get professed beet-haters to think about changing their minds.

Very good and unique! Fresh tasting, beautiful appearance and healthy. I made per the recipe (except used a toaster oven) and used arugula and sweet candy onions from the CSA (white, looked great against the deep red beets), cooked beets from the freezer (pressure cooked whole last fall), maple balsamic vinegar and multigrain artisan bread. I thinly sliced the beets and layered them with the vinaigrette to marinate. I had 1# of beets and it needed more balsamic vinegar. This recipe really needs a crusty bread for best flavor and texture, very thinly sliced to let the other ingredients take center stage (and for lower carbs). I would suggest S&P on top of the goat cheese, rather than on the oiled bread. It is a great vegetarian sandwich and I also like the other reviewers' ideas about serving as an appetizer using crusty baguette rounds. I definitely will make again.

Delicious, and so simple! I wanted something quick and inexpensive, yet a little sophisticated too.

This is a fantastic sandwich. I usually make it with the cracked pepper foccacia from this site.

After reducing the amount of beets per sandwich by half the recipe was palatable but not worth repeating.

This is easy and really delicious! A great weeknight meal! I roasted fresh beets in the oven rather than use canned. It's really easy to roast beets: just wrap them in foil, roast at 425 for about 60-90 minutes (until a metal skewer slides through easily). Then unwrap, let cool briefly and rub off skins with paper towel. Much nicer than canned, and so easy.

This recipe is fantastic. One of the reasons we first made it,was that we wanted a quick weeknight meal that tasted gourmet. It definitely does - even using canned beets. My husband compares every recipe to this one.

What a great appetizer using individual rounds. Would definately make again!

We've made this twice now, once with roasted red beets and once with yellow beets. We'll probably have it weekly. I can't really imagine making it with canned beets though.

Just chiming in on the beet conversation. I have roasted my own beets but have found that if they are going to be used in a vinaigrette a good jarred (not canned) brand is about the same. I live in New England and use "Greenwood" brand and it is excellent for recipes like this.

This is just a great recipe - nice compliment to a homemade soup. Am making it this weekend as an appetizer using individual rounds. The only change - taking the time to roast your own beets is a must and well worth the time investment!

Excellent recipe! I made smaller sandwiches & served them as an appetizer at a dinner party, even the people that claimed they didn't like beets, LOVED the sandwiches. They were definately the hit of the night. I used julienned beets, which were better at staying in the sandwich. Beet lovers, try this one! Erin

I also make a sandwich similar to this with a wonderful sweet roasted red bell pepper packed in sunflower oil. All the flavors together are wonderful!

This is one of my favorite recipes ever!! At first I was hesitant to make this as the ingredients are kind of not everyday but it was such a surprise. Everyone I have served this to raves about it. Would be a good sandwich to serve to your vegetarian friends and also non-vegetarians. All my non-vegetarian friends can't get over this sandwich! The flavors go so well together that I can't even imagine how this recipe was invented. The one thing I do slighty differently is add the red onions into the marinade so they absorb some of the vinaigrette also. Delicious and easy!

I made these one night after searching for a recipe to use up some arugula and goat chese left in the refrig. Luckily I had beets hiding in the back of the cupboard as well. What a great surprise! These sandwiches were easy to make, but complex and satisfying in flavor and texture. I'll definitely make again!
