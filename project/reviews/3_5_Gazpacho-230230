halved the recipe but still made quite a lot, great with tabasco sauce!

Very good, very simple.

This was terrific and very easy. Spicy V-8 makes a big difference. I also put the garlic through a garlic press before adding it and upped the olive oil to 3 Tbsp.

I'd have given this three, but my husband loved it. Pureeing it all at once doesn't work. You have to do the onions and garlic first otherwise you end up biting into a chunk of raw garlic. I used half a red onion, and that was plenty. I might use a sweet onion next time because the onion seems to be overpowering all the other flavors. Again - blending it first might be a good idea - then adding the cukes, tomatoes,celery, and pepper. I used spicy v-8 just because I like that better than plain tomato juice. I will probably make this again. I usually wing gazpacho - and add chili powder, cumin, cilantro and lemon juice, and skip the olive oil, but this had a nice freshness to it that I enjoyed.

Delicious and easy to make. I used spicy V8 which definitely added to the flavor and helped cut down on the acidity. The soup was a little gritty, which may be solved by blending the vegetables with less liquid before mixing it all together. I'm also used to chunks of avacado in my gazpacho, so I think I'll try that next time.

It is hot and sultry and cold soup sounds fine. The farmers markets are overflowing with fresh tomatoes. This gazpacho was easy to make and delicious. I used V-8 instead of tomato juice. A tasty dish on a hot day. I expect to be making it frequently this summer.

Easy, quick, delicious. What more can you ask for? My only substitution: Spicy V-8 instead of tomato juice, because I like my gazpacho to have a little kick. It was awesome!! A great meal when it's stinking hot outside.

I made double the batch with wine vinegar and pepper. I suggest combining all the vegetables in a food processor and THEN adding the tomato juice. Otherwise it's too sloppy. My friends & family LOVED it!!

Will ABSOLUTELY make this again! I did a double batch and used Snap-E-Tom for 1/2 of the tomato juice so it had a bit of a kick. I also used balsamic vinegar and it was GREAT! My husband even said it was better than the one we love from the gourmet market!

I love gazpacho and this is a pretty good recipe. I did, however, add the juice of a whole lemon, which made all the difference. I omitted the tomato juice. Very refreshing, a great summer starter soup.

As suggested, I used balsamic vinegar -it turned out to strong in the overall batch. Additionally, the onion stuck out a little too much - if I were to make it again, I'd use half the suggested amount of onion and perhaps try a different, more mellow vinegar. Overall, it didn't sit well in the stomach.

I loved it so much! My kids are vegetarians so I'm always having trouble finding something they'll like other than ceaser salad and vegetable sushi. this recipe changed our lives!

It's okay but I'm not a big cold-soup fan
