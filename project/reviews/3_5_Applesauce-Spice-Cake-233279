um, wow, this is fabulous! incredibly moist and flavorful. i love spices so like some of the others added in extra to taste, i also dusted with powdered sugar and it looks great. side of vanilla ice cream and this is a wonderful dessert. i might use a smaller springform pan next time since it is rather flat, but as is it's gorgeous and simple.

Used 1c whole wheat and 1/2 c unbleached white. Cooked about 40 minutes in small bundt pan. Had homemade applesauce that was yummy. Very easy quick recipe. Didn't need any frosting.

Amazing cake! I made some changes by using light brown sugar, added raisins, pecans, cardamom (no nutmeg)and fresh grated ginger instead of ground ginger. I made a glaze of powdered sugar, rum, lemon zest and juice. The fresh ginger and cardamom really give the cake another dimension of flavor. It is a very moist cake and if you choose to make a 9x13 double the recipe. I used a bundt pan and it was beautiful and delicious!

i think this recipe can do no wrong and is a great base for experimentation. I had a little more than half the applesauce, used vanilla instead of rum and and was very loose with the spices and it came out great. I didnt frost it and made it as a loaf bread. One of my guests was embarrassed because he couldnt stop eating it.

This can actually make a nice little layer cake. I split the batter between 2 8" rounds and used a ginger cream cheese frosting. Very moist and flavorful. This cake can also be veganized pretty easily-- I used ener-G replaced for the lone egg. All my guests enjoyed it.

Very moist and flavorful, but (as others have noted)it only rises as high as a standard one layer cake (maybe 1 1/2 inches). I doubled and made it as a 2-layer cake and did not ice the sides, but rather iced the middle and top and allowed the icing to droop over the top sides. Looked very nice.

Delicious. I followed this recipe closely enough to say that the texture and flavor profile are great, plenty of flavor but not overwhelming on the spices. I changed: 1 TBSP apple brandy instead of 2 Tbs. rum (didn't have rum, don't want too strong of an alcohol flavor) brown sugar instead of raw sugar (didn't have it) swapped 1 tsp. baking soda for 1/2 tsp baking soda + 1 tsp baking powder (less soda taste, more rise) and had homemade applesauce that was a little sweetened. So if you are a stickler for The True Recipe Review then I don't pass, but what I did made a great little treat! I totally hate it when someone reviews a recipe and then describes changes they make that basically alter the whole character of the food, I think it's not fair to review a recipe if you're changing significant flavor or texture items--and I get really bugged if I read a review that does that and then COMPLAINS that they didn't like the recipe they never tried--but I think I stayed true enough.

Have made this multiple times but never posted a review. I love this cake! Substituted 1C. whole wheat pastry flour and 1/2C. white. Also soaked some golden raisins in brandy for 30 min. and added to the batter. Threw in some toasted, chopped walnuts too. Used the brandy liquid instead of rum. Baked in a tube pan. Skipped the icing - this cake doesn't need it.

really nice cake. smelled so good i ate some while it was still hot from the oven! very delicate crumb and moist. based on other reviews I used a 9 inch springform pan and only 1 teaspoon of rum (I don't like a strong rum flavor in cake). It turned out delicious. I also used a home made applesauce. Because I was just interested in a spice cake to go with coffee I did not make the icing. It was delicious plain.

This was great. Perfect for a fall treat. I didn't have rum, so I used rum extract and it worked just fine. Loved how moist it was. My kids and my hubby gobbled it up!

I used crab apple sauce left over from making jelly instead of apple sauce so using the raw sugar was perfect. Following other reviewers suggestions, I substituted 1 tsp 5-spice for 1 tsp of cinnamon and added 1 tsp of baking powder to the recipe to get the cake to rise properly. Next time I will use the 2 tsp cinnamon and leave in the baking powder. A moist cake that did not need frosting.

Easy and light. A nice, spicy treat. I soaked apples in lemon to garnish.

This was just what the doctor ordered for a snowy February day. I made it in a 9" rather than 10" springform pan so it had to cook an extra 5 minutes. I used regular white sugar and added a big handful of currants. Instead of icing, a bit of powdered sugar was all that was needed. This is a moist, flavorful cake.

Loved it! I was looking for something comforting on a cold rainy day, and this fit the bill perfectly! I had some local organic apples that were getting a bit soft, so I used them to make applesauce first. That, and using freshly ground spices (I'm not big on ginger, so I substitued allspice) makes such a difference. I wasn't sure what kind of rum to use so I used Puero Rican. My husband said the cake tasted like Christmas, and my preschool boys loved it too. I should have sifted the icing sugar, because I had a few lumps! I just drizzled a bit of the icing over the individual pieces, and while the presentation wasn't spectacular, it was fine for a Sunday night at home. A keeper!

I used a tube pan and it came out great. Moist and delicious. I topped it with cinnamon whipped cream. Yum.

Very moist and flavorful cake (taste is something like gingerbread). The cake did not rise as much as I expected, and I agree that you could double up to make a layer cake. One note of caution - this is not an especially showy cake (visually speaking). That said, all my guests loved it. I followed the very easy recipe to a T this time. Next time,however, I will try with a bit less sugar (hopefully, the apple taste will come through more strongly). Also, I will forego the icing which, although, very tasty, seemed somewhat superfluous. I had lined the bottom of the springform with slices of apple (like a tarte). When I inverted the cake after baking, it looked beautiful.

This a very moist, tasty cake, though it didn't raise as high as I thought it would.. The icing is good, too. The rum is a great addition, and the flavor really comes through. I'll make this again!

The flavor of this cake is exceptional. It was very easy to make. It was one of the favorites at our recent dinner party. The icing is VERY good. The only thing I didn't like was the way that the Icing ran off of the cake and pooled around the bottom. I would recommend refrigerating the cake before icing it, and immediately after to help harden the frosting faster to stop that.

My whole family loves this cake. I double the recipe and make it lower in fat, by using one cube of butter and replacing the other with more applesauce. Yummy. And the icing is like candy--the kids fight over who gets to clean up the bowl and spoon.

This is a great and easy cake. I was generous with the spices and added a bit more applesauce. I also used a 6 inch bundt pan (which means it must be baked longer). Then I iced it with butter cream icing with a touch of rum. Looks great and tastes wonderful!

I'm so glad I doubled the recipe! I substituted a teaspoon of cinnamon with the Chinese Five Spice seasoning I had on hand and the flavor was wonderful. I recommend making this into a layered cake and instead of frosting, use apple butter in the middle. I personally made this into mini layer cakes by using a cupcake pan. I forgot to double the frosting recipe so I only frosted the tops of the cupcakes, but with the apple butter filling half-way down, they were a hit!

I made this cake for the first time a few days ago--and then another one by popular demand. It's easy and tasty. The texture is very nice. I increased the spices, as another reviewer recommended.

OMG!!! My daughter and I totally love this cake. I had the magazine and lost the recipe so on her b-day when I finally found the recipe on the computer she was like, " I want this cake more than any present I got" This cake is moist, not to sweet and the perfect size for family meals. You should so make this cake its the BEST!!!

This was so disappointing. I made this for my Christmas party last night and only two pieces were eaten. I was reluctant to serve this as I tasted it before putting it out on the table. The flavor is floury and pasty. The texture was nice and the icing was fine, but like another reviewer said, there are way better spice cake recipes out there. Don't waste your time with this one. I wish I hadn't.

This is my third time since Nov. making this recipe because everyone is asking for it. I actually love how the icing falls out to the sides after the springform pan is opened. It makes for a beautiful holiday dessert display. And, the flavor was terrific. However, I normally add more flavoring than called for in a recipe. I also like using the springform pan because the cake makes a bit of a dent in the center which traps the icing in the center. I also added a bit more powdered sugar than what was riginally called for to make it a tad bit thicker.

good recipe, a comfor food, my 6 year old loved it, did not use the frosting on the recipe but one that I had from the store and it was very good. I will do it again, even my husband liked it.

Easy, tasty cake. Although I agree with the previous cook who said this recipe isn't terribly unusual, I found that the ease of preparation gives this cake an advantage. I used a 9" springform and got one reasonably sized layer. I also used fresh ground nutmeg which I find improves both taste and aroma. The icing is good and spreads properly if both it and the cake are cooled.

There are better applesauce spice cakes out there!! Using a 10" spring form pan produces a very shallow cake. The frosting is also very thin and just runs down the side of the cake onto the counter. The flavor is decent, but not all that different from other spice cakes.
