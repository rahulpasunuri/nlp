Made this as written (except used thyme instead of cumin, as another reviewer did), including the cook times (letting it sit is important), and served with a rhubarb balsamic compote, new potatoes, and an arugula salad. It was excellent! Not sure if I would insert the garlic slices next time. Straightforward, pretty quick, and tasty, will definitely make again.

Family loved this recipe, will make it again. Next time, for fun will try different herbs. Didn't have wine so used a cup of chicken broth. The cook time is perfect, turned out tender and juicy, cannot wait to make it again.

I made this exactly as written except for the cooking times. At 10 minutes in the oven, mine tenderloin had an internal temp of 130. 4 minutes later, it was at 145 and I pulled it, wrapped it in foil and waited 10 minutes. The thicker parts were still a bit pink in the middle which is fine for me, but my extremely picky wife wanted the smaller end that was more done. The flavor was ok, but not great. Not sure I'd make this again, but it worked today based on the ingredients I had on hand.

My (newly un-vegetarian) boyfriend made this and subbed thyme and rosemary for the cumin. It turned out perfect, though he seared it in an iron skillet for no more than 4 minutes. He promises that next time we can try the cumin-spiced version.

Have to add, ***follow the directions and let it rest a full 10 minutes***. This keeps the moisture in the meat.

I've made this many times and it comes out great always. If you don't have the wine on hand, just double the broth.

Outstanding. No thermometer bull. This was perfect. I served with mashed potatoes and carrots. While the meat was in the oven, I carmelized a medium sized onion. When the meat was taken from the wine/stock, I pulverized the onions in the liquidthen added a little corn starch that had been dissolved in some chicken stock and salt and peppered. What a meal!

I followed the recipe to the detail. Completely raw inside. Very poorly written recipe, needs clarification and more details. Waste of a pork tenderloin and side dishes.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe. Although I hate people who change it before they try it, I did. Used thyme, not cumin, and used 2 tenderloins but kept remaining ingredients the same. Required between 15-20 minutes to reach 140 degrees. Very versatile, tender, flavorul, compliments the side dishes. Next time I might roll tenderloins in flour so that the "jus" is a little thicker. A true "go to" recipe.

This came out wonderful!! I didn't have any white wine, so I substituted the Odwalla Pomagrand juice I had in the refrigerator. I had 2 tenderloins, so doubled the liquid, and also added diced onion to the liquid. I served it with roasted potatoes and asparagus. Yum!

This was a simple, basic recipe for pork tenderloin. I had a pork tenderloin that I had bought at the farmer's market and was looking for a recipe where I had all the ingredients in my pantry. This fit the bill. I served the pork with some apricot chutney. I used roast garlic (from a jar), but otherwise followed the recipe. I did have to cook it a bit longer (about 15 minutes in oven). When I pulled it at 15 minutes, the temperature was just over 140 and I let it sit for 10 minutes and the temperature rose to 155. The pork was perfectly cooked and very tender and moist. I'd make this again and serve with other sides. I thought it was a little plain on its own. Some mango salsa might be nice with it.

Rating: 2
A quick and easy way to cook pork tenderloin. I used vermouth instead of wine like another reveiwer because that is all that I had, I think it gave it kind of a bitter flavor. If you give it a good sear there is no reason to roast it in the oven for more than 10 minutes like other reviewer are doing - use a theromometer and pull it at 145 degrees.

Rating: 4
This is a simple but flavorful dish, easy to make and inexpensive. I use more garlic to satisfy my personal taste and recommend you spoon some of the juice from the saute pan over the meat after it is plated.

Rating: 4
I was a little skeptical because I'm not a fan of cumin. I used dry vermouth instead of white wine, but I forgot to account for a tenderloin larger than 1 pd (so added extra time). YUM! SO easy. Not necessarily "a dish beyond compare" -- but considering all the awful tenderloins I've made in the past, it was for me.

Rating: 3
I love this recipe. It is so easy and delicious. However, I would up the cumin a little, also reducing the sauce after baking and adding a little butter really finishes the flavors quite well.

Rating: 3
This is a great recipe that pleases both adults and children. The only change you need to make is in the baking time. 10 minutes is not nearly enough, and I have a convection oven that normally cooks things faster than a recipe states. I'd bake this at least 20 minutes unless you want your pork dangerously rare.

Rating: 4
This is going to be my new weeknight favorite! Even our kids (9 & 10 yrs.) liked it a lot. I was a little worried about the cumin, thinking it would taste like tacos or TexMex, but it blended very well and the final flavor was excellent - a real pleaser for the adults as well as the kids. The pork came out very tender and succulent, and there was even a nice "jus" in the pan which we spooned over rice. I followed the recipe exactly except since I cooked two pork loins (packaged together) I used one garlic clove for each. Definitely a keeper, and so easy!

I needed a quick and easy Easter dinner because some plans fell through. I had a pork tenderloin in the fridge and I came and looked on epicurious. This recipe got great reviews and looked very simple... And it was and DELICIOUS! I used tarragon instead of cumin because not a huge fan of cumin. Cooked it 15 minutes in the oven instead of 10, and made gravy for mash potatoes with the drippings by adding flour! YUM! So good and easy! My 4 and 2 year old even loved it! It was the best Easter dinner we have had in a long time!

I'm making this tonight for something like the millionth time. It ALWAYS comes out perfect. My boyfriend has abandoned all his grilled pork tenderloin recipes in favor of this one...and asks for it regulary, which is fine with me as it is so easy to prepare, even on a work night. I've experimented with different spice and liquid combinations and it always works as the real secret of this recipe is the cooking technique.

Rating: 4
I made this tonight, It was very testy, the whole family liked it including the kids. I tripled the amount of sauce, since I used close to 3lbs of Pork Tenderloin, and also because my family love the gravy over the meat and the mushed potatoes. I used corn starch to thicken the sauce. I cooked it for about 35min. I am adding this to my recipe box. Thanks.

The family enjoyed this recipe very much. I did use a fair amount of garlic and coated the meat pretty much completely with sprinkled cumin. I didn't have chicken stock or white wine, but used beef stock instead and that worked just fine. It was very tasty, tender and moist. I did have to cook it longer than called for, but that may just be my oven. Great simple recipe.

Estupendo! I'm so-o-o grateful for this recipe, and have meant to review it earlier, having now prepared it several times. As advertised, it's scrumptiously tender and although quick and easy, perfect for both family and guests. One reviewer said it's boring, which amazes me; but, then, we like things on the hot side, so I season with more than one garlic clove, and also slather the pork with a ton of pepper and about half again as much cumin. Enjoy.

Searing the tenderloin before baking really helped. I also found that 10 minutes in the oven and 10 minutes standing was not enough. I ended up slicing the tenderloin and put it back in the juices in the oven for a few more minutes.

Bravo! Wonderfully tender and delicious. I made 2 tenderloins. Added more garlic slivers since we love garlic; seared it in the pan; added the liquids (which I doubled the amts for 2 tenderloins) and cooked for 13 minutes in the oven. Rested, then removed the pork to serving platter. I then took the large amount of pan juices (waste not, want not) and brought it to a simmer on the stove. Added a small amount of cornstarch/water mixture and continued to stir/simmer for few minutes. Seasoned with fresh ground black pepper and spooned the delicious gravy on each serving plate then topped with slices of pork. Yum. Quick, easy, tasty.

I made this just lasy week and my husband is begging for it again. He ate almost the entire pound of pork tenderloin. I loved it too and would have eaten more if there was any left! At first i had trouble keeping the garlic in the meat then realized I was making the holes too wide. I was getting sick of making only fish and chicken all the time and decided to try a new type of meat. This was my first pork tenderloin and was expecting the typical newlywed fiasco of burning the meat but this came out perfectly! I also agree with other recommendations that the pork needs to bake longer than specified in the recipe,

Rating: 4
This was great! Tender and flavorful. Only thing I'd do different is boil down the juices during the "resting" period to make more of a sauce. I cut the garlic very small, per the reviews (thank you all!). Served with butternut squash mashed with maple syrup, butter and cinnamon and it was great! Enjoy....

This is a wonderful way to cook pork tenderloin, which is one of my favourite meats. Like many of the other reviewers I made changes as I didn't have all ingredients but this recipe is so versitile it seems to turn out no matter what. First try I used tarragon instead of cumin and it worked great. Tonight I seared the meat, with bottled minced garlic in the oil, added ginger stir-fry spice and had to use beef stock with the wine as I was out of chicken stock. Wonderful. I think that the success of this recipe is more from the cooking method than the ingredients. Lucky for me-pork tenderloin is on sale for $3.00 a pound here this week so I am going to stock up tomorrow!!!!

The pork melted in your mouth. It was awesome. I did leave out cumin (not my favorite) and seasoned the pork with Old Bay, cinnamon and garlic. Got rave reviews from young and old. Will definitely make again!

Rating: 4
This has to be my favorite pork tenderloin recipe. Easy, quick and every time I've made it it came out perfectly. The garlic is quite key to the flavor. I would not add minced garlic to the pan as the time it takes to brown and cook in the oven may cause the garlic to burn. Just make the garlic slivers smaller and you may avoid the uncooked garlic taste...which, by the way, I find very tasty. Also, if the finished tenderloin slices are too pink, I just put them back in the pan with the hot juices for a minute or two (no longer). The hot juices seem to add just enough cooking to reduce the pink color.

Rating: 4
Judging from my past very positive experiences with recipes from sheila lukins- i followed her recipe to a 't'- searing for a full 10 min- something i might likely have rushed- and ending with resting a full 10 min as well- the internal temp read only 150 when i took it out of the oven then did raise to 156- it was so tender, juicy and flavorful- huge hit with children and dad alike. will make again- next time with black beans i think. a comment on the garlic- sliced very very thin- i did not have the problem other readers had.

I had the same problem regarding the garlic. Next time I'll either roast the garlic first and press into slits or just mince and add to pan.

I have always found the feedback on this site invaluable. I was so disappointed with this recipe. It just didn't taste good. The garlic didn't cook through and even at 155 it wasn't cooked enough. We salvage the tenderloin with BBQ Sauce from the fridge.

as others suggested, the recipe needed more cooking time, unless you like your pork rare (and yes, it was a tenderloin, not a loin). also, the first phase of browning requires a hotter skillet to sear the outside properly. even with these adjustments, however, a finnicky family enjoyed the meal thoroughly and requested that i make it again.

This recipe is excellent! Definitely a keeper. I never would have thought to add cumin to pork tenderloin, but it definitely works. I followed the recipe to the letter except I did use an internal probe set to 155 degrees which took about 15-20 minutes. The inserted garlic slivers also make this dish.

Rating: 4
I didn't find the sauce really added a lot. It will probably be better with the leftovers. I loved the cumin - it will be a standard from now on. I also had to cook the pork for about 20 min longer. And I do know the difference between pork loin and tenderloin. I blame my oven. All the epicurious pork tenderloin recipes need a bit more time.

Tender and moist. Two 1.5 pound tenderloins took 20 minutes to reach 150 degrees. Might skip the cumin next time. Would also make more sauce next time.

This is quite a palate pleaser. I made it exactly per the recipe (I always do it that way the first time)except I added more chicken broth when I removed the meat. I boiled it down just a little bit and it was a really awesome sauce. I had no trouble whatsoever with the cooking timetable. I agree that some of the readers may be mistaking pork loin for pork tenderloin. Completely different cuts.This is a definite keeper.

This is a very good and flavorful recipe. The cooking time is probaly more like double the time given in the recipe so allow for it. Reduce the liquid for a great sauce. I used a white wine that came in an 8oz bottle so I added the rest to the sauce after cooking the meat.

This was an excellent, very easy recipe for Pork Tenderloin. The sauce was wonderful! I did double the recipe for the sauce as I made 5 tenderloins. I did not use Cummin but fresh summery savory instead. Excellent dish!

Rating: 4
I made this last night (on 9/24/03) and my husband and I loved it. But I have a few recommendations. I cut the garlic slivers *tiny* and inserted them pretty deeply into the pork, so the flavor would not overwhelm. Also, instead of cumin, I used rubbed sage and ground coriander, and it was delicious. Finally, I agree with the consensus that 10 minutes in the oven isn't long enough. I have a Polder probe thermometer, which tells me when the meat has reached a desired internal temperature. I set it for 155 and it was perfect - tender and moist. I reduced the remaining pan juices and poured it over the top - just watch the hot handle after you take the pan out of the oven - I almost burned myself!

Rating: 4
This was a great, simple, easy, one pan dish. I used Apple Juice instead of some of the liquid, adding a great flavor to what turns out to be a silky sauce to ladle over the pork once served. The next time I make this, I will be sure to add more liquids - never enough sauce for my family. I served with pan fried polenta and garden fresh greens.

Rating: 3
This was fantastic especially considering how easy it is. Very tender and flavorful. Like others, I had to bake it much longer than the recipe called for but it was worth the wait! Next time I'll use more wine and broth so that there's a bit more juice to pour over the meat for serving.

Rating: 4
Thanks for all the hints and tips. I stuffed my tenderloin with garlic and slivers of fresh ginger, then seared more fresh ginger slices with the pork and left it in the broth/wine mixture. Later in the day, I served it cold with a bottled peanut sauce and jasmine rice. A great summer dish -- loved it and ate the rest on salad the next day.

Rating: 4
I loved this. It was so easy. I used jar garlic and more than one clove worth. Also, was pretty liberal with the cumin and salt/pepper. Not sure if it was the size of my tenderloin, but after the meat was seared on the stove for about 10 minutes, I still had to keep it in the oven at 400 for 30 minutes -- even after it set for about 10, it was just slightly pink inside. However, the flavor was fantastic and because it's so easy, this will become a staple at my house. I served with mushroom rice and fresh green beans. Yum.

The recipe was good, somewhat bland. It was very moist and indeed the meat was tender. We didn't feel that all of the flavor was distributed throughout the meat. Other cooks suggested a cream sauce or more spice...maybe next time.

My entire family loved this recipe. I always double the recipe for my group. It was easy to make and the rewards were so delicious. After making this once ... I have altered the recipe by adding more garlic than the recipe calls for, and after searing the pork, I place the tenderloin in a Reynolds bag and bake (following the directions from the bag, according to the weight). After the baking is complete, I add Knorr's Chicken Boullion cubes to the drippings(1 or 2 to taste), adding pepper, flour and water ... this makes a very delicious gravy to serve with the pork. I have made this numerous times and it has become a family favorite.

This was a good basic recipe for setting off a spicier side dish. I found that if I browned the pork well, for 10 minutes, as the recipe said, the 10 minutes of baking time was adequate - it was pink in the center. I also boiled the garlic clove in water for 5 minutes before stuffing it in the slits - worked fine.

Rating: 3
I personally loved the recipe as is, but I did need to add 20 minutes to the cooking time ... the meat was far too pink otherwise. I have a gas oven, that might be why. My husband and son found the garlic too overpowering, so I will roast the garlic first next time. I served it with creamy mashed potatoes and a brown mushroom and herb gravy. It was so tender and delicious.

Rating: 3
My husband and I love this recipe. I generally make it as is, but last night I did follow the suggestion of one reviewer and used roasted garlic. It worked great! Also, I didn't have chicken stock on hand so used all white wine and then reduced while pork was resting for a nice light sauce.

This is the first time that I have cooked a pork tenderloin and it wasn't dry. After removing the tenderloin from the wine and vegetable stock, I cooked off half of it, thickened it a little and drizzled it over the sliced pork. It was great.

While the pork was very moist & tender, I found that the garlic overpowered any other flavors in this dish. I will make it again, but I plan on using 1/2 clove or less, or perhaps roasting the garlic first. I also had to cook this about 15 minutes more than the recipe called for (and yes, I did use a tenderloin).

A great and easy dish. The flavors were interesting, I wasn't sure how I would like the cumin, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. In fact it reminded me of a pork tenderloin I ate at the Cheesecake Factory in Chicago last fall. I did have to put my tenderloin back in the over for about 5 minutes as it was bordering on res as opposed to pink.Alth, my peice was about 1/3# larger than the recipe called for.

I made this recipe last night with about 1 1/4 pound tenderloin, extending the oven cooking time to 15 minutes, and let it sit for 10. Was out of white wine so I substituted left over dry champagne. Won't use cumin next time. Otherwise it was Perfect! So tender! Will definitely do again soon.

I haven't made this yet but the discrepancies in the reviews makes me think some are using a pork tenderloin (usually 3/4 to 1 lb) and others are using half of a pork loin roast made by tieing 2 halves of loin together- this is not a tenderloin. The recipe calls for the first.

Rating: 3
We loved this recipe! I served it with a spicy side dish, so I was not worried about additional flavour in the pork. Also, I do not have an overproof skillet, so I just used my roasting pan. And, I used my oven's probe to 160F internal temperature, and after waiting 10 minutes to cut, it was the perfect color pink inside. We will definitely make this again!

This dish is easy and great. I doubled the garlic, added fresh rosemary, and cooked 1 1/2 lbs. tenderloin for 20 minutes and let it sit for 10. It was almost perfect. The next time I'll shorten the cooking time to 15-16 minutes. My husband loved it.

Once-made, once-devoured, now our "standby" recipe for pork tenderloin. We seasoned lightly with cumin and another time might substitute another herb for a change of pace.

This is indeed a wonderful recipe for pork tenderloin. Prepared as the recipe, added 2 minutes to the time in the oven. I think the time it takes to sear the tenderloin will affect the oven time. If the meat sears in less than 10 minutes it won't be as warm toward the center and may require more oven time. Served with the APPLE, DRIED CHERRY, AND WALNUT SALAD WITH MAPLE DRESSING on this site, baked buttercup squash and steamed broccoli. Lovely fall meal.

I thought this was a good recipe. Tried it tonight for dinner and we enjoyed it. Since we prefer medium-well I put the pork tenderloin in for 20 min instead of just 10.

The recipe was really nice and the pork was very tender. I am not sure if the cumin was the best choice for seasoning.

I recomend at least 30 minutes.

When I read this recipe I thought the total cooking time seemed too short to cook the pork all the way through but I tried it and it came out perfect. The pork was just slightly pink inside and very juicy. I also thought the ingredients sounded nice but not that interesting but I was desperate for something quick to make. To my surprise the taste was wonderful. This was a quick recipe and very flavorful, a definite keeper.
