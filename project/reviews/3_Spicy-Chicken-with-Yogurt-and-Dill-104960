this was extremely tasty. i mixed greek style (full fat) yogurt and 1.5 tablespoons of chili garlic sauce and marinated the chicken for two hours. i served this with brown rice.

Try using whole milk plain yogurt - the low fat/nonfat ones will curdle if boiled.

this was o.k. but nothing special.

I tried this recipe for the first time today and followed the tip about the sour cream addition to the yougurt.I found the sauce to still be a bit runny even with the sour cream but I added a small amount of corn starch to the sauce at the end and it thickened nicely. All in all I loved the spicy flavors used to prepare this recipe and I would try it again.

Haven't tried this one yet but... I was looking for recipes today using chicken and yogurt. Pierre Franey addressed the issue of yogurt breaking down and his solution was to mix it with about 1/4 up to equal amounts of sour cream.

Turn your monitor off and take out the garbage. NOW.

I was intrigued by the combination of ginger and dill, so I had to try this one. I used dried dill and not so much as was called for and it was surprisingly good. But to prevent the yogurt from curdling is a mystery to me. Perhaps it's just unavoidable. I served it with rice pilaf.

Delicious! I used garlic-chile paste instead of the chile peppers, and served over jasmine rice.

This was absolutely delicious! I couldn't find red jalepeños so I used green ones which worked out fine. Basmati rice is an excellent accompaniment. I will definitely make this again and I've passed it on to friends.

This was terrible.

This dish had good flavors. The dill gave the chicken a surprising twist, although I didn't put in as much as the recipe called for. I, too, had a problem with the yogurt curdling, and the sauce was very watery (and there wasn't much of it). I would love to know the solution to this problem. This is the only reason why I might not make this dish again. Would have liked more sauce and a sauce with better consistency.

Good flavor. An alternative to curry. I served with tzakiki, brasicca, and naan bread

This was a refreshingly different take on chicken. The yogurt curdled a bit while cooking, but I have never tried cooking it before, so I don't know if I did something wrong or not. The spice was nice, and the chicken very moist. I will make this again and probably experiment a little. I'll probably use chunks instead of strips, season the yogurt with garlic, and maybe try curry instead of cumin. I will definitely make a take on this recipe again.

Strange combination of spices. Interesting flavor but I wouldn't make it again.
