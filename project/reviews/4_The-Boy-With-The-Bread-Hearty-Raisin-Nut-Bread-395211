good texture, easy to make but next time i would use more cinnamon and nuts.

soaked half the raisins in aged rum overnight and 1/2 the raisins in water as directed. made an adult loaf and a kid's loaf and they both came out fabulously.

I made half the recipe & a few changes. Rather than kneading the nuts & raisins into the dough, I made a cinnamon-sugar, raisin-nut mixture & rolled it into the dough. This gave it the traditional swirl. It was excellent & easy to make.
