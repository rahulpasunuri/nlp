I agree with the other reviewers that said way too much tomato. Maybe 1/2 the tomato amount and then cut the tomatoes into fourths instead of halves. The cheese and fresh thyme add a nice touch.

For anyone that says this is too much work, I couldn't disagree more! This is probably the sexiest thing I've ever made! I've never roasted my own tomatoes before, but it was so wonderful! I got all of my ingredients (including fresh thyme!) from the farmer's market, and I think that makes all the difference. This is not about whipping up a quick fast dinner, this is recipe that makes you truly appreciate the beauty of the food you are preparing. This is a beautiful, and I have learned my lesson that I will NEVER avoid roasting my own tomatoes!

This is a forgiving recipe and quite good. I played with the proportions to use up what vegies i had in the refrigerator. I also sliced the tomatoes, boiled the potatoes first to save time, added onion, and sprinkled a variety (and greater quantities) of fresh herbs and cheese. The breadcrumb suggestion was a good one, thanks!

This recipe is time intensive, so I tried to make a simplified version which was delicious. I boiled the potatoes, and while they boiled I fried zucchini slices in my skillet (I used equal amts potato/zucchini). While those dried I added some oil to the skillet to quick saute some garlic, onion and pepper. I layered the zucchini, potatoes, onion/pepper mixture, 1 can diced tomatoes (great shortcut- save more for the top), seasoning and cheese 3 times. Whatever oil was left in the pan I used to coat the breadcrumbs and mixed those with a bit more cheese for the topping. Next time I'll try the panko suggestion, but this was super tasty, with less cleanup than the original.

I used purple potatoes instead of the Yukons and that made this pretty, but it was WAY too much work and time for the results. I'd suggest using peeled canned tomatoes instead of roasting tomatoes for an hour, and a sprinkle of Panko breadcrumb at the end gave it a little crunch. It is a good idea for vegetarians like me, but the execution needs tweaking.

I made this with the suggestion of another viewer. I suggest slicing the tomates and cooking in less time. Make as many slices of zucchini and/or summer squash as potato and tomatoes. Otherwise make as directed. I would add more cheese and roasted garlic next time.

Quite time-consuming to prep 3 separate veggies (perhaps especially so because I doubled the recipe for a big Thanksgiving crowd) but this turned out pretty and very tasty. Got enthusiastic reviews - lots of people going back for seconds - so I will make again when I have the time... I sprinkled Parm and seasoning over each layer as another reviewer suggested.

The first time I made this as written and would only have given it 2 forks. The second time I switched the proportion of potatoes to tomatoes, i.e. 2 3/4 lbs tomatoes to 1 lb. tomatoes. Also I sliced the tomatoes instead of halving them - they layer better that way, and I cut the oil in half. I give my version 4 forks!

The flavors mesh together well but it is definitely missing something. It either needs Parmesan and thyme between each layer or a can of the cream of mushroom soup or something...
