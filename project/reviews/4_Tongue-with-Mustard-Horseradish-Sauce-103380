I have ever always liked tongue. This recipe looks really good and appetising but not complicated to make. I'll try it some day soon and forth back with my opinion.

I cooked the tongue in a slow cooker on low for 8 hours, with a mixture of homemade salsa (tomatoes, onions, cilantro, jalapeño), red wine, beef broth and water. It was the first time I had ever cooked or eaten tongue, and it was amazing. So tender and flavorful. I made the sauce according to the recipe except for subbing a milk and half-and-half mixture for the cream, omitting the dill, and adding extra lemon juice to taste. It was delicious. I would use extra shallots next time.

I have always hated tongue (my father loves it). Coming from an Iranian background, I know people who love it (once I was dragged along with a group who wanted to get tongue sandwiches from a certain turkish cafe--I would definitely had chosen something else--but it turned out they had none left). Anyway, my husband bought some (sheep) tongue and I made this recipe. I love the flavours added to the broth (especially the star anise), and, having cooked it myself, I was more willing to try it (I was still pretty squeamish about it). But I have to admit that it was very tasty, and the sauce was great too. I still have trouble getting over the fact of eating a tongue, but I guess this recipe has helped me out a bit.

You have to read the notes by "justiniowa" and add those ingriedients to this very delicious recipe...tender beyond description. I made sauteed cabbage with potatoes as a side. I had to work on my mental state while preparing the tongue and even eating the first bite. Once past those challenges the meal was first class. We rate all of the recipes we try between 1 and 10, this received a glorious 12!

This was my first time to make tongue myself, though I'd seen it made a dozen times or more (it's quite popular here in Russia where I live). The star anise in the cooking broth was a nice surprise. Though it was undetectable in the final dish, it definitely made the kitchen a lot better smelling than without, given tongue's unique and not exactly pleasant odor. Cubed half the meat for use in an "oliv'ye" traditional Russian salad and sliced the rest thinly to be served as an appetizer with the mustard-horseradish sauce. The sauce was an unequivocal hit, even though I had run out of flour and had to use potato starch for the "roux". Followed the rest of the recipe to the letter and couldn't offer any suggestions for improvement for this wonderful recipe!

Four forks easily. Before cooking, I recommend soaking the tongue over night in salt water. in a deep dish that covers the entire tongue. When cooking, I add 3 bay leaves, mustard seeds, and a few caraway seeds and red pepper flakes to the existing recipe. Be mindful of what you add when cooking tongue, because it will really absorb the flavors because of its texture. For the sauce, I added four tempered egg yolks using the hot broth I had strained from cooking the tongue. Adding the egg yolks gave an extra depth and fuller body to the sauce. If you are serving tongue for the very first time, I recommend this recipe. I make this dish occasionally for friends who have never enjoyed the pleasures of beef tongue before. I highly recommend cooking the tongue until you are able to pull off the top layer of the tongue with a fork. That is when you know it is done. Once cooled enough to handle, it should peel off easily and remaining portions can be trimmed with a knife. Lastly, I would recommend an electric knife for cutting and to cut the the tongue at an angle width-wise. If you cut length-wise it is more likely to be tougher.

P.S. continued from my previous posting --A question please: Does anybody out there in epi land know if the origin of this recipe is from 'French' cuisine? I'm assuming it is because of the Rue, Dijon & cream!

4 forks for sure! I followed the recipe exactly as is written. This recipe was an adventure and a good one! You can get over the 'gross' factor If you keep yourself in the mindset of respecting the life taken from an animal by 'using every part' of that animal, just as many groups of Native Americans did/do out of respect and appreciation for the animal whos life has been taken, then it is easy to get over the squeamishness of preparing 'Tongue'. When raw it wasn't as gross as I thought it would be, after it was cooked it was a strange new experience to separate the meat from the fat underneath the tongue but some tasty meat was under there. The rest of the tongue was very easy to cut up I sliced it very thin. Before I had cut all the meat up, the outer covering of the tongue was easily peeled & removed and came off almost like a thick 'plastic' covering in sheets. Once you get past the odd appearance & process of cutting up & peeling the meat you are left with some of the most delicate, soft and flavorful meat you ever tasted! And the sauce was also delicious & creamy but not ridiculously fatty because there is only 2 T of butter & 1/4c. of cream which is not that much compared to some other recipes which I have made. This is a KEEPER recipe for me for those days when I'm feeling adventurous! {p.s. *one more thing, the 'star anise' was a 'strong' scent & flavor but we found it appealing.}

This was the first time I've ever had tongue - I was inspired by a discussion with my parents about things they ate as a child that had fallen out of style. I'm so glad I had such a great introduction - this was so delicious! It was simple to make but came out looking and tasting fancy. If you are curious about trying tongue, I highly recommend this recipe; it was a huge success.

OMG! The best beef tongue I've ever had. The sauce was perfect for the tongue. My husband loved this dish. I used fresh grated horseradish instead of bottled. Which is even better. I left the cooked tongue in the broth overnight to absorb more flavor. I also added celery and 3 whole cloves to the broth. The sauce can be used for other things like chicken, fish, veal or even veggies. Sauce can be made with what ever good flavorful broth you have on hand if you're not making the tongue.

This turned out perfectly. I didn't use star anise, but used fresh bay leaf, 1/4 onion, garlic, mixed peppercorns and juniper berries.

This is an amazingly good recipe. I have made tongue for years and usually find that I have to make several at a time since the whole family loves the leftovers for sandwiches. This was a new recipe for me and although I used my crock pot for the cooking like I usually do, The sauce was wonderful. You do need to have a liking of horseradish and mustard to have a taste for it though (which we do). The reviewers who are chastizing the use of tongue as a food... if you are a vegetarian, why are you looking at meat recipes? And if you eat meat but just have a problem with certain bits, think o fit this way... If you had to die for food... wouldn't you want non of you to go to waste? Try it, you may just like it. I hated tongue as a kid, absolutely love it now!!!

I cooked tongue for the first time, delicious! It will become a regular menu item. I didn't make this recipe, simply cooked it in the crock pot cover with water, seasoned with salt, pepper, onions and celery, I admit I had my doubts and was ready to give to the dog if I had to but it was awesome and tender.

Excellent. Not all that many recipes out there for beef tongue and this may be the best yet. Changed nothing except for using my pressure cooker which saved about ninety minutes cooking time. Sauce made the dish. As for the "cooks" from Toronto and San Antonio, perhaps they'd be happier nibbling their mommies' macaroni and cheese and green bean casseroles and leaving the real cooking to the grown-ups. Stay out of the kitchen, kiddies, and go outside and play.

delightfully simple recipe - the tongue was fork tender and served up beautifully. I added a small handful of golden raisins to the sauce, about 1/4 cup, that added a very nice sweetness - the sauce not only complimented the tongue, but was an excellent addition to the broccoli and rice sides. I would give a longer prep time, about 4 hours, to include the cooling and meat prep afterwards [skinning and de-fatting] - This dish works very well with chilled Chenin Blanc Blanc

My husband made this, he wasn't too sure about tongue at the start, but we loved it!

As someone born in WWII and growing up in Scotland, items such as beef tongue are a regular preference (as are kidneys, brain, sweetbreads, tripe, etc). This recipe nicely augments my various tongue recipes.

I liked the flavorful way the tongue turned out. I was less fond of the sauce. However, it was great on the steamed red potatoes and carrots served with the tongue. I also prefer smoked tongue having grown up in German south St. Louis. The increasing number of Hispanics in my Kansas City neighborhood brings beef tongue tips to a local super market.

Super recipe, very Middle-Europe traditional. I stud the onion with a clove or two, pinning a bay leaf or two, depending on the tongue size. Whole Allspice can substitute. I also add celery/carrot/parsley to the water. If time allows I let the skinned tongue cool in its simmering water over night. This allows flavours to develop and prevents it from drying out. I slice the tongue on an 45 degree bias and do not serve the root of the tongue. Too much gristle, bad optics for an otherwise excellent dish. The horseradish sauce issuperb.

I don't like the consistancy or general flavor of a plain tongue. Smoked is best, and corned is also good. Too much garlic, what is the point, the tooth and flavor of the meat, or the over used garlic mask. Star anise a bit muddy... an onion stuck with cloves, much better, and more subtle. The sauce, over done... think kiss (keep-it-simple-stupid) lemon, sour cream, and horse radish, and mustard on the side

While shopping for fresh meats for the coming week, that included Easter, I picked up a 3 lb. beef tongue and added it to my cart. Not till I came home and started marinating some of the meat for future meals, did it dawn on me, that cooking the tongue would be a major challenge. As a young kid growing up, my father would regularly buy a tongue and I would use it as lunch meat in my school lunches. After my wife and I were married I may have cooked it once so our boys could taste it, but now it was just her and I. There was no doubt in my mind, that tongue was the furthest thing from my wife's mind when she thought about eating. I certainly had ordered it in some restaurants, when it was on the menu but Nann never partook in my meal when I ordered tongue. Now I had the challenge of cooking it for a dinner and having Nann like it. The results were wonderful, and we both had a second helping. I added a tablespoon each of fresh chopped dill, oregano and marjoram as well as the herbs recommended in the recipe. I served the meat sliced very thin with large leaves of romaine lettuce.

Calf tongue is a traditional dish in Quebec. I remember my grandmother used to add some to her summer vegetable stew. This recipe is excellent, the meat is very tender, especially if you use calf tongue. For the sauce, I would maybe prefer Dijon mustard, instead of moutarde de Meaux, but it was excellent anyway.
