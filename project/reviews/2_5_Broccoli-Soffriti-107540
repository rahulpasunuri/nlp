Well, I truly thought I would love this, but I made the mistake of trying it with the broccoli rather than broccoli rabe. The broccoli just did not cook properly this way. I imagine the recipe would work well as originally intended with broccoli rabe.

Delicious and easy. Anchovies give the dish a wonderfully nutty flavor. No need for salt or bread crumbs, IMO.

The broccoli rabe was a bit bitter, but that's the way it's supposed to taste. I loved the flavor of the garlicky-anchovy oil that it was cooked in. I think it would be great to toss this with pasta or serve with crusty bread.

My husband and I love this recipe, however not being a huge fan of broccoli rabe, I always use broccolini (baby broccoli). I saute the toasted bread crumbs in a pan with butter, as well.

Mediocre. The broccoli rabe was bitter despite the blanching and the overall flavor nothing exciting. Might be good for a quick dinner vegetable, but not for Christmas.

This was delicious and not difficult. Don't skip the bread crumbs - they make the dish. I used broccoli rather than rabe, as none was available. Rabe would be even better, I think. Do spare me the rant on anchovies, though. I don't have the kitchen staff to ever consider making my own. Get real, please.
