I don't quite get the last reviewer who added coffee to the mascarpone. This is a marvelous recipe, every last crepe was eaten straight off at the brunch where I served them, with a lot of other stuff; this was by far the favorite. The crepe formula is perfect. I had been given a jar of homemade strawberry preserves and they were so delicious w/the mascarpone filling and the caramelized crepes (I skipped the topping: no strawberries to be found!). I have an 8-1/2-inch Le Creuset non-stick pan that is probably supposed to be used for something else, and I always use it to make these crepes, works perfectly. They can be made ahead of time. Also I just let the butter/sugar caramelize on the crepes in the oven, and don't bother sauteing. They're fabulous!

Made this for a Mother's Day brunch using purchased crepes. It went together fast, although I thinned the mascarpone with a little half and half and coffee. I had no trouble carmelezing the sugar(more butter, higher heat) and served the dish again in the evening, flambeing them with Grand Marnier. Nothing like cookig with fire. I added cornstarch to the leftover marmalade and made strawberry pie.

This recipe went over quite well. I made the crepes a day in advance and they kept very well. The next time I make these, I would skip the carmelization process -- simply brush them with butter, dip them in the sugar/cinnamon mixture and bake them. They carmelize when they are baking, so it seemed pointless to do it twice. The marscapone cream is great, but the crepes are sweet enough without it. So, unless it's winter and marscapone is easy to find, skip the cream.

This is a great make ahead dish. I had a little trouble carmalizing the sugar because the crepes were so moist due to the marmalade. The marscapone cheese really helps this dish.

I made this for a brunch and it went over very well. You can do everything before hand and then just reheat the crepes before serving. Even though the cheese really makes the recipe, most people didn't bother to put some on. Therefore next time I would serve it already on top.
