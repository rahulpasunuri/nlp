This recipe is both simple and perfect. I served it with strawberries and whipped cream. It's definately going into regular rotation.

Fabulous, great light texture and easy. This is the closest to real mousse I've had without having to use eggs. Note that this makes 2 generous cups. Thanks for the great recipe.
