I just finished baking this and want to note that the quantities of fruit/nuts and batter are fine, but it is important to have butter quite soft, eggs at room temp and to beat the sugar into butter very well to make the full volume of batter. I baked this in 12 mini-bundt pans and had enough left for one 5.75 x 3 mini loaf pan. The bundt pans are a bad idea as they formed a dark crust around each cake, almost to the point of being burnt by the time the center was done - 45 minutes. The loaf pan came out great, probably due to lining with parchment which couldn't be done in the bundt pans. Taste is great!

I used about 1.5 pounds of cherries, 1 pound of apricots, 1.25 pounds of almonds and no raisins in this recipe. i had never made fruitcake before and kind of freaked out when it was so thick, so i added 50% more batter mix. It took about 50% longer to cook than listed. I made it 3 days ahead and kept it in the fridge. on serving day, i made an icing with the rum/maple syrup mixture, a bit of skim milk and powdered sugar. i iced it and dribbled some pomegranate seeds over it and it was beautiful. a very nice modern take on a traditional cake.

I made this recipe in 1 regular loaf pan and 5 of the foil gift-size and the hour was about right for baking time. I did not use the full weights of the fruits-total, I used about 7.5 cups of dried fruit-- a mix of about 3c dried cherries, 2c dried apricots, about 1.5c asst-cran, apple, white raisins, and ~1c dark raisins. I agree with the previous comment that cup measurements would have been helpful on the fruits rather than(or in addition to) weights. Love the cake, though! Also added pecans in addition to the almonds and doubled the syrup-half while warm, then other half after 2 days. Used Captain Morgan's rum, which went well with the maple syrup.

I think the recipe writer should have called for 3 cups each of cherries and apricots and 2 cups of almonds. 1.5 pounds each of cherries and apricots plus 1 pound of almonds is too much for this batter to cover, as another cook noted earlier. I think this recipe works better when the fruits and nuts are measured by volume rather than weight.

I hate to be the naysayer but this cake didn't look like a cake at all. First of all, the amount of cake batter is way too little for all that fruit and nuts. I had to double the batter just to get it to coat the fruit and it still wasn't enough. The result was a clump of toasted nuts and dried fruit which was tasty, but definitely not cake-like. It was more like granola than anything else.

This is definitely a keeper!! I made this cake at Christmas; but instead of baking it in the 10" angel food cake pan, I used baby loaf pans and cut the baking time down to just a little over one hour. I gave them out to friends and family - everyone loved it - some even asked for more.

Great fruitcake. I substituted 1.5 lb cherries with 1.5 lb mix of dried cranberries, currants, candied orange peel and it was delicious.

This was my first try at fruitcake, and it was really good. Since my husband and I don't love rum, we substituted Grand Marnier for the rum in the syrup. Thumbs up!! It's moist, slices nicely and is attractive--good recipe!

Wonderful fruitcake; moist, not crumbly, easily sliced. I think the six eggs contribute substantially to the texture. Try it and substitute other fruits; just keep the weights of the fruits the same. Can't fail!
