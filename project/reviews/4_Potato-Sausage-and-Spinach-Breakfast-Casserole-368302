We loved this recipe! It was very easy and although I loved it as I made it, there is room for variation in the future, which is fun. I substituted milk for the heavy cream, and didn't miss it. When I went to make it, I realized that I only had a dozen eggs, so I reduced the rest of the ingredients just a little and it was great. I used really nice sausage and think that this was the key. Although I enjoyed the mix of cheeses, you could easily get by with just one and not miss it. Guests really raved about this for breakfast.

This was excellent! The only changes I made were done unintentionally. I purchased light cream instead of heavy cream and forgot the Parmesan. It still came out very tastey. I brought it to a breakfast buffet and it got great reviews.

The flavor of this is excellent. I substituted asparagus for spinach. I thought the potato pancake step was difficult. It took me 3 tries to get it right. I would do what one person suggested and not flip it next time OR use store bought potato pancakes (Trader Joe's) which would make it even easier. Will make again.

This is a delicious brunch dish for a small gathering. I followed the suggestions of other cooks and used frozen (Trader Joe's) hashbrowns, sweet Italian sausage (1+ lb), casings removed and crumbled, and whole milk instead of cream. I used a bit less salt. I defrosted the spinach and cooked the sausage and the leeks the night before, then made the hashbrowns in the morning in a 12-inch cast iron skillet, added the layered ingredients followed by the egg mixture and the cheese. Baked for 42 minutes at 325 degrees set on convection. It puffed up and browned nicely -- looked delicious and did not disappoint! Next time I'll try substituting chopped asparagus and strips of prosciutto or Canadian bacon.

Great recipe! I chopped up fresh spinach instead of using frozen (since it tastes like hay). Next time I might try crumbled spicy sausage or crumble crispy bacon instead of the links. Still really tasty!

This is a great recipe! I made it for my housewarming party and got rave reviews. I used maple breakfast sausage and frozen hashbrowns. There was no need to flip the hashbrowns, I just stirred them and let them get crispy before adding the other ingredients.

I substituted frozen shredded potatoes and Italian sausage with the casings removed and it turned out great. Definitely plan to make it again.

This takes a bit of work but it's well worth it. The finished product is beautiful. I took this to a gathering a few weeks ago and someone tracked me down today to get the recipe. Yep, it's that good. Because gruyere can cost a fortune, I substituted monterey jack with good results.

Easier than it looks. My family loved it, even my husband who does not like spinach. I used Italian sausage and took them out of the casing instead of the breakfast sausage.

LOVED this recipe - made everything the day before except the eggs - poured the eggs over Christmas morning for my brunch, perfect! I added diced tomatoes for some additional color.

Made this on XMas morning it was a HIT!!! Every last bit was gone - I dr. it up using pre-made hash browns w/ onions and bell peppers, JD sausage crumbles and added asparagus and diced tomato's. Also added some garlic seasoning with the the S&P

I have made this several times and find that it is very adaptable to my family's tastes - decreased the amount of sausage (also removed the casing), used skim milk, whole and half and half - all came out well, used 8 whole eggs+8 egg whites, used frozen leeks from Trader J, used frozen hashbrowns. I have not been able to get the potatoes to remain crisp, we love the taste of the potato layer, but I like the idea of a crisp potato...

This was great. Be sure to use the correct pan. The potatoes are difficult to flip and still keep intact. I put it in a quiche pan after cooking to share with neighbors

It was good, and I cut the sausages into 2 pieces to make serving easier. Unfortunately, the potatoes were gray and gummy. Perhaps I used too many or my pan wasn't hot enough. My son, who loves to cook, suggested making hashbrowns by baking the potatoes in the microwave, cool them then grate them. That's the we always make hashbrowns, and they are crisp and tasty. Then I'd cut back to 2/3 of a # of spinach. I made all the preparations the night before, and this way the cold baked potato would grate easily. It was our Christmas brunch, and I'd do the same again with the above modifications.

This recipe was a HIT at my christmas brunch. I used frozen hash browns, maple sausage and whole milk instead of cream and it turned out perfectly! I dont think that its necessary to flip the hasbrowns, so i probably wouldnt do that the next time. Lots of complements!

This looks delicious. Can it be made in advance? frozen?

" A cook from Charlotte" - No, not outrageous at all. I always use a bag of hashbrowns as my base for xmas morning breakfast bake. Works like a charm each time and SO easy.

I HAVEN'T MADE THIS, BUT IT BE TOO OUTRAGEOUS TO USE FROZEN HASH BROWNS?

Made this for breakfast Thanksgiving morning and it was outstanding! I cut the recipe by half and added more leeks. Did most of the prep work the night before which made it less time consuming that morning. Everyone loved it!

This was just okay for us. It's a quiche with hash brown crust. My potato loving husband wasn't all that impressed with the crust. My son liked it but didn't reach for it cold for breakfast like he would with a quiche. But I agree it came together easily with a glass of Chardonnay in hand.

For a lighter dish, use whole milk instead of heavy cream and substitute strips of cooked ham for sausages. Don't miss this great recipe just because you're not a spinach fan - simply use 1/2 pound of fresh asparagus,cut into 2 inch pieces, and steamed in microwave for 2 minutes.

Yesterday we went to two holiday gatherings. We started our day with a potluck brunch to which I brought this casserole. Later in the day we went to a Mexican dinner party. At the end of the day, my husband said this casserole was the best thing he had eaten all day...quite a compliment considering all the great food we had eaten. The only change I made was using bacon instead of sausage.

I halved this recipe for the two of us for dinner, & we still have enough for break-fast (literally). I used Organic Prairie breakfast sausage sliced into patties rather than links and grated local russets in the food processor. It wasn't too intensive while sipping a glass of Sebastiani Chardonnay.

This was totally delicious...and a lot of work. I prepped a the sausages, leeks, cheeses the night before which saved a lot of time in the morning. My family thoroughly enjoyed it. Beware: it is rich and heavy.
