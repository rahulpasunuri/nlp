I've done a similar pesto with coriander but it's def not "authentic". If you tell an Italian about making pesto with herbs other than basil they'll shudder. It's a good alternative though. I had parsley in the freezer. Basil doesn't keep well frozen. I used pecorino instead of parmesan.

Looks like a tasty recipe! I made winter pesto crostinis with kale, spinach and parsley that came out awesome. Here is a link to the recipe: http://handmeafork.blogspot.com/2011/01/winter-pesto-crostinis.html

This dish was delicious as written. I used fresh herbs rather than dried ones, and substituted farfalle (bow-tie) pasta for the linguine. Next time I will add some halved cherry tomatoes.

Yummy. I shouldn't have added so much olive oil to cover it for leftover-safekeeping, but that's just a matter of experience. Buy good Italian bread to sop up the extra pesto. Oh, I almost forgot -- I didn't have the entire amount suggested of pine nuts, so I toasted and added pecans and walnuts -- also yummy.
