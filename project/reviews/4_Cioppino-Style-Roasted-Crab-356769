This is my new favorite to celebrate crab season in the Pacific Northwest. I doubled the garlic and served with crusty rolls to get every last bit of broth!

This recipe is great! I used fake crab (watching my cholesterol). Please note, if your onions and garlic turn blue as the wine heats up, it's fine. It's a mini chemistry experiment! Plus, you can't tell once you mix in all the other ingredients. I added extra crushed red pepper for a good kick.

I have made this dish 4 or 5 times. It is always delicious! I have adjusted the seafood to our taste, using scallops, crab, shrimp & lobster or a mixture of some of these. I precook the crab in boiling water to remove the excess salt. The shrimp, crab & lobster are shelled, cleaned & deveined. I then put the shells in cheesecloth (it's easier to remove them after cooking). In the last 5-10 minutes, I add the shelled seafood and cook just until done.

This was fabulous. Didn't change a thing although added a half-pound of shrimp. Served it with the Lemon Parsley Linguine which was also a hit.

This is a perfect recipe, it doesn't take long and it tastes GREAT. I used canned crab meat (3 cans) from Trader Joe's and had no problems what so ever. I added a pinch of cumin based on someone's review and I think that helped a lot. I debated whether or not to add some sweet corn, opting out of it, but I think it would have been great even if I did. I also only had one cup of clam juice - made it any way with no problem. Fantastic dish, served with saffron risotto (from this site also, the SELF recipe) and though rich, perfect for the sick boyfriend I was cooking for!

The crab broth is very good, but like others, I had problems with the king grab legs in the soup. I don't know how much the roasted shell contribute to the flavor. I added carrots and celery suggested by others. I used seafood broth instead of water along with the clam juice. Added some Old Bay and white wine vinegar. Next time I will either remove the crab in advance and then roast the shells with the soup or try this with shrimp or just lump crab meat. My wife said it has possibilities.

This recipe was so very easy to prepare. At the recommendation of others, I added diced carrots and celery to the onions. I used Dungeness crab as my local market was having a special (cracked and cleaned for only $1 extra!). The results were amazing - a delicious and savory dish! However, I will never, ever make this recipe again. This was, without a doubt, the messiest, most difficult thing to eat. I'm not unfamiliar with cracking open crab, however I am unfamiliar with trying to crack crab pieces that are swimming in what is essentially steaming hot tomato soup. This would have been a 4-fork review were it not for the mess factor.

easy to make and easy to add other seafood to. living in alaska this is a great base recipe. Celery and carrot are almost essential with the onion and garlic. Color is great and warmth during the winter is wonderful. enjoy with pinot gris or noir and a crusty bread and a nice gelato and sit back and enjoy your own review.

Do you think this would work with lump crabmeat? I dislike the work (and mess) of cracking crab pieces open at dinner.

Excellent and easy! Will definately make it again and will try some of the suggestions in the other comments.

Excellent, and very easy. I used Alaskan King crab, but I think this would be great with shrimp and/or scallops as well. I added 1/4 tsp. cumin.

I made this for four adults yesterday. and it was delicious. I added a diced carrot and celery, used cilantro and added fresh thyme and 1 teasp cajun spice. It was easy. We used 1+1/2 pounds king crab legs and 1/2 pound ready to peel med.shrimp. My husband cut the crab into pieces with a slit up one side for easier peeling. Sourdough bread and a fennel, roasted bell pepper, kalamata olive salad (from this site) were the accompaniments. There's one small portion left.

Overall, the recipe was very good. Replaced the dry wine with a simple white wine. The shell on the crab overpowered the dish. Recommend deshelving the crabs, perhaps, leave a few on for the smell and flavoring. Ate it with a baquette, yummy.

This has instantly become my most favorite recipe to make at home. It is quick, simple and absolutely delicious. We don't make crab very often in our home...probably because it seems like a lot of work. This is SO worth it and we will be making it again. We just made enough for two of us, so next time will double the recipe. I'm thinking the leftovers would be great by adding olives, capers and parmesean cheese. Mmmm mmmm good!
