ok but very very sweet. it seems to be missing some ingredient that might get people to eat it. Not compelling.

I could not get this fudge to harden. I think what my problem must have been is that I could not get the fudge hot enough without burning. I think you MUST use a double boiler for this, which I do not have, but even then, with the burning, I couldn't get it to 238 degrees. I tried to make this FOUR TIMES in one weekend because I love to bake and was determined to make this work

I cooked this and cooked it and cooked it and still did not set. It was the consistency of pecan pie before coming out of the oven. I chilled it over night and when it was still pourable, I decided to put it into a crust and bake it at 350 for 45 minutes. STILL DID NOT SET. I was very disappointed that I couldn't cut it into squares. It does taste good - ultra sweet, but that was expected. I will probably eat it with a spoon, but it was completely unservable.

To make fudge even better, add 1tsp.pumkin pie spice flavor, 1/8 tsp. salt

This came out pretty good, esp. for my first time making fudge. Mine was already getting solid by the time it got down to 140 degrees. I had to scoop it into the pan and press it down with a flat spatula. Next time I will try to beat it down a bit sooner. The pumpkin flavor isn't so prominent, possibly because I used fresh pumpkin from a small pie pumpkin.

The first time I made this, it was a disaster! The bottom of the pot scorched and it was sweet enough to put a diabetic in a coma. I went back to the drawing board because the boy wanted pumpkin something. I cut the sugar down to 3 cups, let it boil on medium low heat till soft ball stage and beat for 1 minute. Creamy perfection!

I love the pumpkin flavor and enjoyed making candy for the first time. The recipe says moderate heat, so I cooked the fudge on medium-low. It took longer than I expected, but turned out very well. I will make the fudge again to experiment with consistency. I would like to find a way to make it creamier like chocolate fudge made with marshmallow whip :o).

This would've been great -- could've been great, but something is wrong with the recipe. It doesn't set. And it is too sugary w/out enough pumpkin flavor. The pumpkin is too watery a consistency. Would not make again.

Well, I too was not as successful as I had hoped. Before I could get the mix to 238, it began sticking and scorching. The recipe was easy to follow. I did it precisely the way the recipe described. Mine only partially set, I assume because of the cooler temp. The flavor is wonderful, if a bit sweet for my taste. I would like to try again, maybe on my Mom's stove. Any suggestions for the next time? Oh, I wish I had read the reviews before I tried this. They are helpful and I will read them for future recipes.

I served this pumpkin fudge to several friends, and everyone raved, and I myself thought it was wonderful.

This fudge was just way to sweet, not to hard to make though. Luckly my mother is a teather so I just gave it to her kids at school to eat.

It tastes wonderful, however, I will only make this recipe again when I get a more accurate thermomater!

I've made this recipe three times now. The first time it turned out perfect -- so creamy and delicious. The second and third times it didn't set up. I can't figure out what I did differently. But it is worth it and I will try again! Like another reader, I used the unset versions as glaze for pumpkin and carrot bread.

From the reviews it was apparent that this recipe took patience and should be made slowly. That's usually not my style, so I'm glad I read all the reviews, especially Leslie's. I followed the recipe meticulously. It turned out wonderfully. Next time, I may add just a hint of pumpkin pie spices.

Thought I would love this as I love pumpkin and am always looking for new pumpkin recipes, but it was just way too sweet. After one piece I just couldn't want any more. But my 12 month old couldn't get enough of it! She kept stealing it off the table!

I followed the recipe to the letter and meticulously monitored my candy thermometer's gauge and the fudge never set. This seems to be a problem for others as well. I contemplated adding some powdered sugar to give it a bit more body but I'm afraid of making it too sweet. I think I'll save it and reheat it as a carmel sauce for the pumpkin bread pudding I'm planning to make on Thanksgiving. On the bright side, my peanut brittle (from the Williams-Sonoma fall catalog) came out absolutely perfect and was a cinch to make. Try it with a mix of salted peanuts and unsalted spanish peanuts. Candy store quality...if I do say so myself.

I really enjoy this recipe! However, I cannot make the fudge set. Both times that I have made this, it turns out runny (makes a yummy ice cream topping). I follow the recipe to the letter, getting the exact temperatures. Can anyone help me? I'm at a higher altitude - would that make a difference? I would really love to give this for Christmas ...

A very grainy, hard fudge. I followed the recipe very closely -- even brought the sugar up to temp slowly -- but had a difficult time getting a good consistency. This is not a creamy fudge. I won't try it again.

I made this fudge substituting pecans for walnuts. I won second place at the Great State Fair of Texas with this fudge in 1998.

This recipe probably could have turned out well for me if my gas stove could have reached the 238 degree temperature it requires! I was only able to get the temp up to 228 degrees. The taste of my semi-firm concoction was good, though. Maybe I could use my neighbor's stove...If once you don't succeed...

Bill, a Chef friend of ours gave us this recipe, and I've since made this fudge several times, replacing pecans for the walnuts. Everytime I made it, it was superb. I find the key to fudge making is take your time. Slowly dissolving sugars (constanly stirring). I tried adding the spices... ehh, wasn't fond of that, but everyone is different. I didn't want my fudge to taste like pie *grin* Lower heat a notch and bring temperature up to 238 not 237 or 239 (be precise - very important) DO NOT TOUCH IT... let it cook undisturbed (this keeps the sugars from crystalizing, causing your fudge to be grainy) Make sure your temperature drops to 140 before you attempt to beat it down. Someone said that it doesn't really beging to lose it's gloss, and they are correct. If you beat it till it lose's it's gloss you'll have a dry unacceptable fudge! I beat mine until it feels really heavy, about 30 seconds to 1 minute. I hope this helped. Don't give up on it, it's great fudge. You can also omit the nuts which will really liven up the flavor of the pumpkin! With the nuts, it's not got much pumpkin flavor. TIP: Cut the fudge BEFORE it sets up. It'll be easier to cut into serving sizes. Hope this will help you make the recipe again. It's a wonderful treat!

Absolutely wonderful! I followed several of the review suggestions, using pumpkin spices, half cream and half milk, and 2 cups confectioner's sugar with 2 cups granular sugar. Also, use 1&1/4 cups cheese pumpkin puree, never halloween pumpkins, for a great pumpkin flavor.

Rating: 2
We found this fudge to be too granular and sugary,with very little pumpkin flavor,even though we added "pumpkin spices".We used 1/2 cup milk & 1/2 cup cream, but it still wasn't creamy enough.Maybe goats milk would work better! Any suggestions, please respond.

It turned out great! I took the advice of one of the reviewers and put in some extra spices. I just used a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice and made it as usual. Please if you chop the walnuts in a food processor, leave out the finer pieces. This was where my fudge ended up a little dry on the edges, but it's still a great recipe!!!

Rating: 3
Well, I will make it again. It tastes good, but I think that next time I will add some spices associated with pumpkin pie. In my effort to "beat the mixture with a wooden spoon - until it loses it's gloss" I over did it (though it never really began to lose it's gloss) and the recipe had to be pressed into the pan rather than poured. Live and learn.

Great recipe! Every other pumpkin fudge recipe that I saw contained butterscotch chips, and you end up with weird tasting butterscotch fudge. This gives you real pumpkin flavor. If you've never made candy before, you must be precise; if it says 238 degrees, that's what it means, not 245 degrees or 225...

I've made this recipe twice, and both attempts were far from wonderful. The center hardened, but the edges were runny. I took it to a family Thanksgiving celebration, and my mom remarked, "I thought that was baked beans!" Needless to say, I won't be trying it again.

This is a wonderful recipe - I have been making it for years at Thanksgiving.
