This was some of the best egg salad I have ever had! I made a few changes: reduced the amount on mayo to just enough to make it all stick together in a sandwich, reduced slightly the amount of tarragon (I find it to have too strong of a licorice flavor for my liking) and added about 2 tablespoons of sweet pickle relish. I made it the night before and brought it to work for lunch on some rye bread with lettuce. I only wish I had brought a second sandwich of it!

Wow! Took this to a tailgate & even the mayo haters loved it! The fresh tarragon was a lovely surprise. My new go-to egg salad! I did reduce the mayo to about 1/3 cup. It was super delish!

This was a very nice variation on the traditional egg salad. I added diced celery just because I like the crunch texture along with the softness of the egg. Definetly a "do again" recipe.

A pleasant change from the season-salt laden egg salads. I followed the recipe and the flavors were fresh and nicely balanced. The tarragon gives it a light and delicate flavor - not licoricy - and it is best appreciated without bread. I served it with both a light rye bread and a buttermilk bread and I think the rye overpowers it. I used duck eggs and followed the cooking directions - the eggs were absolutely perfect - not bouncy or green-edged.

This is my go-to for egg salad. It's great as-is, but my favorite iteration is with some shredded beets on pumpernickel.

As I am not a huge fan of tarragon, I use only a sprinkle of dried, but otherwise this sandwich has always been a huge hit at my house. And actually I've been told several times, the best egg salad ever!

Beware that the tarragon gives this egg salad a very licorice taste...not a flavor that I like, thus the low rating.

Good and easy egg salad recipe-I added celery for some crunch and used dried tarragon as I didn't have fresh.

A nice, solid egg salad recipe that I will go to whenever I need something cheap and easy to eat for lunch. I didn't use the greens, but I think they would have added a nice dimension. Served on toasted white bread and used dried tarragon (used about 1 TB) and the tarragon flavor wasn't too strong for me--though I do love it. It was great the next day when the flavors had mellowed. Overall this recipe is simple and unoffensive.

I love this salad, especially with the crunchy pea shoots

Halfway through making this, I realized I didn't have any tarragon or white wine vinegar, so I used 3/4 tbsp thyme and apple cider vinegar instead. Not the best egg salad I've had, but if I used the ingredients it called for I'm sure it would have been great.

This is the best egg salad recipe for sandwiches there is. I often substitute fresh oregano for tarragon, add 2 oz. of finely chopped capers and use less mayo. An open faced sandwich topped with smoked salmon makes this, accompanied by a salad, an elegant lunch.

I made this just as outlined in the recipe, except I used about 3/4 tablespoon dried tarragon, and served it on homemade white bread with regular green lettuce. Our guest said it was the best egg salad sandwich he's ever had. It'll be my go to recipe from now on - I always have everything for it in the pantry.

Also, I agree with the last reviewer. Peeling cold eggs is painful and time-consuming. Best to peel after cooled and before refrigeration.

I was looking for a recipe to use for my leftover Easter eggs and stumbled upon this. One of the best chicken salads I ever had has fresh tarragon in it, so this sounded good. With so many leftover eggs, I had to double the recipe. I used a bit less mayonnaise. I also actually like a bit more kick to my foods, so I used an extra half of a shallot. I substituted dried tarragon for fresh (availability of fresh herbs in my area is sad)- which means I used a little less than advocated. I thought, overall, it was pretty tasty for my first go-round at egg salad. I would definitely make it again.

This recipe is really good. Super easy to make. I didn't have Tarragon so I substituted Thyme with a dash of Chinese 5 Spice.

This recipe is pretty good. BUT, attempting to peel a cold boiled egg, one that's been in an ice bath for instance, will take forever and you'll most likely end up with half of your eggs peeled off with the shells. The protein sac that covers the egg must be warm in order for it to separate cleanly from the egg itself. So, if you want to do it CORRECTLY you remove the eggs from the boiling pot and place them into another bowl. Then run luke warm water over them and when they are cool enough to touch you can begin peeling them.

We loved this egg salad. The tarragon and shallots make a great enhancement to traditional egg salad. We used the white wine vinegar (many argue for the tarragon vinegar, ehich can be hard to find) and found that it added a great tanginess.

I think this recipe is o.k. but not spectacular. I give it a 'good'.I normally follow recipies exactly as written but in this case I had to decrease the shallots by half. I tasted the salad after adding half and it was very hot and oniony, If I had added more it would have ruined the egg salad. Perhaps I had unusually hot shallots? The tarragon flavor was pleasant. All in all this is a good recipe in my opinion and is a good way to make simple egg salad a little more interesting.

Keep the vinegar, and if it is too sour, add some honey. Honey works well with this recipe, as it does with a similar chicken salad recipe on epicurious

A delicious simple recipe I will definitely make again. I added a little Dijon mustard which added nice flavor, as well as capers which were a bit much flavorwise with this combo.

It was a big hit with my one of my college club meetings! I made it as finger food instead of massive sandwiches, but I can see it as a very filling whole sandwich. The only suggestion I would give is to cook the eggs longer, or at least once you turn off the pot after bringing the eggs to a rolling boil, let the eggs sit in there at least 15 minutes to completely finish cooking. I found that when I followed this recipe's instructions, my eggs we half cooked and a bit runny.

These tea sandwiches were a hit at a birthday high tea party that I hostessed. I thought they were tasty but a little too much tarragon for my taste. I think next time I will use a bit less and maybe some chives.

This is by far the best egg salad I've ever had. Every time I serve it friends ask for the recipe - I've even gone so far as to lend out my seasonings so they could go straight home to make a batch for their families. I sprinkle a bit of dill on the tops of the open-faced sandwiches, too. Delicious!

Absolutely the best egg salad I've ever had. I never really liked egg salad before, but this recipe has turned me into a rabid fan, and now I make this at least once a week. Definitely let it sit at least a few hours so the flavors have a chance to mellow together. Yum!

Very good. Probably doesn't need quite as much mayonnaise. Don't overdo the vinegar. I wonder what it would taste like with a small dollop of pickle relish or just a little bit of pickle relish juice, to give it a little sweet flavor.

A very good standard egg salad recipe. The shallots and tarragon gave a very nice flavor. I used celery salt instead of regular salt. It wasn't amazing, but good enough to make again.

This was infinitely better the next day. The first day I made it, I was very disappointed; it tasted very vinegary, and I added more tarragon (I only had dried) to try to make up for it, which wasn't a great idea. Anyway, the next day, the vinegar taste had really mellowed, and the tarragon was a little overpowering because I had put in too much, but still it was wonderful. I make egg salad often and this may become my standard.

For an egg salad sandwich this was beyond belief!!! I used about 1/3 less low-fat mayo than called for, subbed sweet onion for the shallots, and used dried tarragon leaves instead of fresh (at a ratio of 1:5). MAGNIFICO. It did not need celery.

Egg salad is my favorite kind of sandwich and this recipe is the best of any egg salad I've ever made. The tarragon really adds a nice flavor. The only thing I would do differently when I make this again, is to not use the full amount of mayo without first stirring up the mixture to see if a smaller amount would be sufficient. This was the first time I ever tried pea shoots and I love them!

We're on the South Beach Diet (largely Phase 1)and I was looking for something that fit the bill. The egg mixture is scrumptious. Rather than preparing it for sandwiches I put a generous dollop atop two beds of ribboned red-leaf lettuce and served it with a coupl'a slices of crisp turkey bacon. A guilt-free keeper.

My husband and I watch our fat & cholesterol, so I made this with low-fat mayonnaise and 5 whole eggs plus 5 egg whites and it was really delicious (and I don't usually like egg salad). I thought the fresh tarragon really made the salad. We have friends over for brunch often, and I'll definitely be serving this next time.
