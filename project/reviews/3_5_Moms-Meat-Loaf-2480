This was a great basic meatloaf recipe. I used a 2.5 LB meatloaf mix (typically found in the fresh ground beef section of your local grocery) and added 2 TBSP of Olive Oil in the mix (trying to slip something healthy in). I also found that if you use plain breadcrumbs, you can reduce the overall amount of sodium in the recipe.

So perfect. I just made this to freeze for my sister who has a new baby. I didn't have pork and it still turned out very moist. I bought 2 foil 6-muffin pans and baked them as meatloaf muffins. Took about 35 min to cook through to the right temp. I did put the muffin tins on a baking sheet so the oils wouldn't spill over. Once cooked, I wrapped individually in foil and they make super easy re-heat single servings.

I thought this was great and completely agree with those who say keep all the herbs in. I didn't have any pork and it turned out fine. It was moist, but not strangely so. Everyone loved it.

I've been making this meatloaf for years. The added herbs give it more depth than your run of the mill recipes.

I didn't care for this recipe at all. My son is a big meatloaf lover and he was okay with it. I didn't care for the oregano and basil in it. I too topped it with catsup and brown sugar mixture. The meat crumbled and didn't hold together as it was sliced. I like Martha Stewart's meatloaf much better.

I used Light Life's Gimme Lean vegetarian ground beef and adjusted the recipe to be in proportion. As other reviews suggested, I used chili sauce instead of ketchup and coated the outside of the loaf 20 mins before it was done. It turned out great, very much like the real thing. Even tastes good cold for sandwiches the next day.

This is an excellent recipe for meatloaf. My three year old kept coming back for more. Will definitely make again.

This is a fantastic basic meatloaf! Unlike some reviewers, I add a bit more of the herbs because I like a strong flavour. I used half pork and half beef and cooked as directed. The meatloaf is moist, but held together perfectly. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't feel like excess fat was a problem. A little bit rose to the top, so I just spooned it off, then glazed the top of the loaf with ketchup and brownsugar for the last ten minutes of baking. Delicious!

Straight forward good meatloaf as is. Don't change or add a thing like so many folks have previously suggested.

My husband loves this recipe, the only meatloaf he's ever liked. He thinks it tastes very "Italian"-y. I use honey bbq sauce instead of ketchup, and just use ground beef normally (but the ground pork does add moistness if you have it on hand). We didn't have any bbq sauce once, so I added 1/2 can of bbq manwich sauce instead, and also forgot the eggs, and it was even better. Crumbly, but absolutely delicious, great on top of white rice. I make it at least once a month. Although it takes a long time to bake, the prep is so easy.

Rating: 3
Very good depth of flavour and super easy to make. The only alteration I made to the basic recipe was to use half the oregano (based on other reviews) and felt it was just right. I used ketchup as called for and didn't put anything on the top of it. But for kicks I made it a stuffed meatloaf - using my stuffing recipe for turkey as the centre - and it was very good.

I'm one of those annoying people that changed the recipe. Used 1lb lean beef, .5lb pork, .5lb veal. Cut the oregano in half. Added 1 cup of finely diced carrot, celery, and onion, and roasted one bulb garlic. Added the whole thing. Topped with tomato sauce. Added another roasted garlic bulb to my mash potatoes. Really, really great.

Pretty good. A little too ketchupy for my tastes. Only change I made was using fresh garlic instead of powder.

This is a really good meatloaf! My hubby doesn't like onions, so I leave them out and add an extra 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs to compensate. Also, I brush the top of the meatloaf w/ketchup before baking. It is so yummy and way easy. This will definaetly get added to our "rotation"

When I was growing up in the '30s and'40s, we had meat loaf at least once a week. They didn't taste anywhere near as good as this. I, too, used chili sauce in place of the catsup, and, I also slathered a barbecue sauce across the top before placing the loaf in the oven. It turned out great.

Very easy to make. I loved it and so did my family...although next time I would probably add more worchestershire and maybe some tomato paste, I like it tangy. I topped it with mustard just like MOM used to do!

One of the best meat loaf receipes ever! Used the pre-packaged ground beef, pork veal mixture from the supermarket and didn't cook it in a loaf pan (just free-handed it). Other than that I followed the directions to a "T." Came out dee-lish! Sure beats anything I've made so far. Hungry husband and 2 teenage sons devoured it with enough left over for a school lunch the next day. Definitely a keeper.

No adjustment to the spices was necessary for me on this one. In fact, I ramped up the black pepper a little bit for oomph. This is now in our "top 2" fave meatloaf recipes. I used a small slice of stale bread and some stale tortilla chips for the bread crumbs. Serve with Twice Baked Potato Cups with Carmelized Shallots from this site, plus lima beans. Mmmmm!

This meat loaf is great! I make it exactly as the recipe states and my family loves it - including my 15 month old son. I find the spice level perfect with no need to make adjustments. It tastes great the next day as well made into sandwiches. This is a perfect recipe for me - quick and easy with little mess and I can make it and clean up during one of my sons naps. Smooshing everything together with your hands is fun too! Enjoy!

Although this was flavourable, the consistency wasn't great. I found it to be too moist and it fell apart. I'm not a meatloaf fan anyway, so I likely will not make it again.

I found the flavor to be a bit strong. I'll cut back on the herbs a bit next time.. It was good but not "company" good. I will make it again though..

Great meatloaf! I too cut the herbs in half. I used a little Asian chili sauce with the catsup for a little kick. I shaped the meatloaf in a loaf pan and then inverted it into a larger baking pan because my family likes the exterior nice & brown.

i made the recipe as shown and enjoyed it. my girlfriend likes barbeque sauce, so next time i might try using that instead of ketchup. i'm eating the leftovers right now, with garlic mashed potatoes, and they're great. one little thing - i put a foil-covered baking sheet on the rack below the baking loaf after i heard drippings hitting the bottom of the oven. the loaf gets pretty juicy.

Incredibly moist and flavorful. Our family loves meatloaf and this is the best we've had so far. Reduced the spices and the Worcestershire as recommended by others. Also added some steak sauces to the ketchup to equal 1/2 cup. Incredible. Can't wait to have sandwiches with this one.

I also cut the seasonings in half and used half catsup and half chili sauce. Also baked loaf on rack. Will make again in about 6 months since my family isn't crazy about meat loaf.

This was the first time I ever made meatloaf and it was fantastic. Very very tasty. The only thing I would change is that I thought there was too much oregano--it was a little too strong and I would cut it in half next time. Otherwise, easy and scrumptious!

My family loved this meat loaf - it made great sandwiches the next day. I was out of oregeno, but used the full amount of basil. I also grated the onion instead of chopping. I always cook meat loaf molded into a loaf shape on a baking sheet instead of in a loaf pan to cut down on cooking time. I brushed on a brown sugar/ketchup sauce for the last 20 mins of cooking.

What more can be said? I, too, used chili sauce instead of ketchup. Even my husband, who hates meatloaf, loves it. I've made it several times, and it's wonderful!!!!!

This is a recipe that I think most of us grew up with. I have had it this way all my life (and loved it!). I like to make it a little different each time. I always use the LOWEST fat MAVERICK beef. You can add some oatmeal, instead of breadcrumbs for an interesting twist. I also always stuff cheese in the middle (sometimes w/ some mushrooms). I also like a little mustard powder w/ the ketchup. I also like to cut back to 1 egg, and add a little milk for the breadcrumbs or oatmeal to soak up. A VERY neat twist, is to put a few whole hard boiled eggs in the center w/ a little cheese (or not), for meatloaf surprise! Anyway ya' do it, yum!

One of the best Meat Loaf recipes I have ever encounterd

Rating: 3
This recipe is a keeper, with a few minor changes. I took the advice of one of the reviewers and used Thai chili sauce in place of half the ketchup. If you do this, cut out the salt (1tsp) entirely. My husband liked it but stated that it was at maximum salt level. Next time I will use mostly ketchup with some Thai chili sauce. I didn't cut the worchestire in half and wish that I had. I did cut the basil and the oregano in half and found that to be a great suggestion. The loaf was tender and juicy and full of flavor. Definately will use this recipe from now on, with the small changes suggested above. As an aside, my husband asked that I hollow out the middle and put cheddar cheese and sliced mushrooms like my other meat loaf recipe. Yum.

Absolutely delicious....so tasty and moist. Topped with some jalapeno cheese that made it even better. Served with roasted potatoes and corn on the cob....a great meal.

Very good. I, too, cut back (by half) on the amounts of dried basil and dried oregano, although I'm sure those amounts would be fine if you were more in the mood for an Italian flavor. Delicious flavor. I used a Thai chili sauce with garlic in place of half the ketchup. Makes great meat loaf sandwiches the next day, too!

Very good meatloaf recipie! Used "meat loaf mix" that can be found in some supermarkets - the butcher pre-mixes beef, pork and veal. I find this seems to work just right.

Rating: 4
Definitely a hit. I used a very lean ground beef and didn't encounter the excess fat problem other cooks did. I also recommend the tip from a cook in Seattle: mix the meat separately from the other ingredients then blend afterward. I think it makes everything mix more uniformly.

Have made this recipe many times now frequently using a variety of ground meats along with the beef including lamb, veal and turkey. All have worked well. Also brush some BBQ sauce on the top before baking.

This is a great recipe for meat loaf. The only improvement I make is one Mom always made. Stuff it. She made her own stuffing but I have used a box of Stove Top. Bake it in a large loaf pan or a cake (9X12) pan. Place a layer of the meat mixture first (~ 1 inch thick) and then form the stuffing on top. Cover all with a consistent thickness layer of the meat mixture, sealing in the stuffing. We love it!

Have made this recipe a number of times since it was first published, and it's become my mainstay meatloaf--great comfort food with mashed potatoes. I, too, reduced the onion to 1/2 cup, and I've substituted chili sauce for the ketchup a few times. I covered a wire rack with foil and poked holes in the foil. Then shaped the mixture into a loaf and set it on the wire rack placed in a baking pan. Removes all the grease from the loaf. Cook to internal temp of 160 degrees. This recipe is a keeper.

With four kids, I have tried many meat loaf recipes and this is one everyone likes. I do agree, however, that it needs to be able to drain while cooking because it puts out quite a lot of juices. Otherwise, it's a really nice addition to our dinner possibilities.

Rating: 3
The recipe wasn't "WOW, GREAT!!" - but it was worth another try. I do agree with another reviewer that I would cut down on the spices - perhaps just 1 tsp. each of the oregano, basil and garlic next time. Also, I would make the following change to hopefully better the texture. I would mix the onion, catsup, eggs, worcestershire and spices well, and then add the bread crumbs, and then add that mixture to the pre-mixed meat mixture. I also agree with the reviewer about shaping the loaf then turning it upside down on another baking sheet to cook as this puts off a great deal of fat.

Rating: 4
Great recipe!! Made a brown sugar/catsup sauce and spread it over the meatloaf before baking. Also a great meatloaf tip: Pack the loaf into the pan, then turn upside down on a shallow baking sheet and remove the pan. Coat the top with sauce and bake. No more sitting in grease and it cooks perfectly.

I have made this recipe a couple time now, and it's delicious! This is best meat loaf recipe I have ever made, I will throw away all the others, this is a keeper. However the only modification I had, was I used only a 1/2 cup on onions and that seemed to be plenty.

Rating: 4
Very tasty! I had the following changes: I used 1.5lb ground beef chuck and 1lb ground veal, and I added 1/4 cup fresh minced parsley and used only 1 tsp basil and 1 tsp oregano. Note that this meat loaf is very juicy so I would highly recommend using special meat loaf pan which is perforated on the bottom to enable proper draining of the juices, otherwise your meat loaf may come out soggy.
