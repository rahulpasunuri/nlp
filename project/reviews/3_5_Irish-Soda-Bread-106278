I thought it very easy and simple to make. I made it with half whole wheat. Baked in iron dutch oven that I preheated it before adding the bread dough. It baked up beautifully as one loaf. It is firm and tender. I very much like the taste with the caraway seeds and the raisins. I am quite sure my family will like it as well with our corn beef and cabbage dinner. Will definitely make again!

Made the recipe as written and it was good, but I prefer a sweeter version with less caraway (tasted too much like rye bread to me). Put in 1 Tbl sugar and 1 tsp caraway seeds, also used golden raisins. Will be making this recipe from now on!

Great recipe. Didn't use the caraway seeds because I didn't have any.

This is amazing!!! I was skeptical about the Caraway seeds, but thought that it was a lovely flavor with the raisins. I love this bread! And it really looks beautiful.

Rating: 4
I've been making this recipe since it was published. It is really good. I prefer it without the caraway seeds, but I make it both ways, depending on the occasion. It's great toasted, too, if it lasts more than a day. I mix the dry ingredients ahead of time and store them in a plastic container and then just add the wet ingredients when I'm ready to bake it.

I've been making bread for years and am always very picky about my breads. I thought this bread would be okay, but I didn't have high hopes for it. Wow -- it really was delicious. And I have never made a bread before that was so easy to whip together and also came out looking beautiful. I omitted the caraway seeds since, like the other reviews, I thought they would overwhelm the flavor. Also, I used golden raisins -- don't omit them! They make the bread absolutely perfect. I served it with some stew and it was a brilliant lunch!

I just made this yesterday. We ran out of bread and I didn't feel like going out to buy a loaf and was out of yeast to make real bread. I had never tried Irish Soda bread before, so I halved the recipe just in case I didn't like it. I was also out of buttermilk, so I used about a cup of plain greek yogurt instead. Other than that, followed directions explicitly (except the raisins). It turns out that the time provided is inadequate. 35-40 minutes is really not enough for this bread to bake, which i discovered once it had already cooled and it was too late to stick it back into the oven. Other than that, I still thought it was good, which is why I gave it 2 forks, but next time I make it, I will omit the caraway seeds as well and leave only the flour, soda, salt, sugar, and buttermilk. I will also make it in the shape of biscuits, because that is what this bread tasted like, and that is what the texture was reminiscent of for me. When I do make again and bake for a longer time, maybe I will change my rating, but for now it will remain a 2 forker (good)

A friend of mine makes a delicious irish soda bread using no fats and skim milk. I substituted the buttermilk with 1 % milk and used golden raisins instead of brown raisins. I also baked it as one loaf - not two loves on parchment paper. Added 10 mins to the cooking time but would go for 15 next time. This recipe is the closest I've come to my friends (no, they aren't giving out the recipe!)

For over 100 years Harvey's Chelsea Restaurant in NYC had been known for its soda bread. It was so popular that they gave out its recipe. My efforts never matched Harvey's, but they did with this recipe. Its mild flavors of caraway and raisins mingle to make an ideal complement to savory meat dishes and stews. I have made this bread twice; here is what I've learned. 1. Buttermilk makes a lighter bread with a better, more crumbly texture; lighter milks, such as half-&-half, makes it too dense. 2. Soaking the raisins first (30 min. in simmering water) plumps them up and makes them easier to mix into the dough and to stay put when kneading. (Drain thoroughly.) 3. If desired, increase sugar to taste, but if you want a sweeter soda bread or don't care for the taste of caraway, try this site's Irish Soda Bread with Raisins (Bon Appétit, 02/05); with similar ingredients and procedure, it's quick, easy and a definite four-forker.

Rating: 3
Very good, very quick, very tasty! I recommend this, especially for those of us a little scared to venture into yeast breads quite yet. I followed the recipe, omitting caraway seeds and using half kefir and half 2%, as I was out of buttermilk. It is dense, doughy, and flavorful. I've only had soda bread once before, so I don't know if it's *authentic*, but it sure is yummy, and just what I expected.

Rating: 3
Turned out better than I expected. I was scared it would come out dense and hard (no eggs or baking powder), but it was surprisingly good. I used ground caraway instead of seeds. Served it with lamb stew on St. Patrick's day. Guests loved it too.

I grew up in a huge Irish family. We'd spend several hours every sunday afternoon at the Burke Irish Centre. My sister was a step dancer and we'd attend Feis' all over a five state area. So I've tasted hundreds of soda breads and have never had one with caraway in it before. Now I see why. The caraway is overpowering and makes the bread taste like a rye bread. I made the recipe a second time without the caraway and it was much closer to the soda breads that I remember. I've also never had a soda bread that was moist and/or sweet so it surprises me that so many reviewers are telling people to add several tablespoons of sugar and extra liquid.

Rating: 4
Fantastic!!!! I used the recipe as it except: 2 extra T. buttermilk, only 1 T caraway seeds, and currants instead of raisins. It was moist and flavorful. Everyone at our early Irish dinner asked for seconds.

I made this bread this evening to go with the Corned Beef and Cabbage recipe listed on this site. It was really easy to make and came out perfectly. I'd make this again. And again!

Rating: 3
This is really quite good! I was a bit nervous because the dough was very sticky and difficult to work with, and the loaves are not the prettiest things you've ever seen (but it looks nicer sliced up!). I followed the directions closely except for adding another tablespoon of sugar based on other reviews. I liked the fragrance of the butter you brush on the loaves before baking, but think they would look better with an egg wash. I might try an egg wash with some melted butter added next time. Definitely easy and gives great results!

Rating: 3
Wow! If I had known soda bread was that simple, I would've started making it years ago!! This is a great recipe. I didn't stay exactly true to it though... completely left out the raisins, since no one in the house can stand them. Love the carraway flavor.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I have made many Irish Soda Breads in my time, and this is by far the best. I did cut the recipe in half to make only one loaf, used 2T sugar, 1 cup buttermilk, 3/4 c golden raisins and added 1/2t baking powder. So easy, so quick, I will make this bread often.

Rating: 3
This is delicious. I brought it to my work potluck and everyone is enjoyed it. I also followed the recipe exactly except for doubling the sugar. Don't skip the carraway seeds! They add interesting flavor. A keeper! Oh--it doesn't take nearly as long as 2 1/2 hours to make! That length of time includes cooling COMPLETELY, which is not necessary. It is good warm, too. 10 minutes to whip up and 35 minutes to bake and cool for however long you want.

Very easy and very tasty. I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled the sugar as someone suggested - PERFECT! I will make this agian next St. Patty's Day!!

I made this yesterday for a St.Patrick's Day party. Three loaves disappeared in about ten minutes. So easy that I made the recipe twice. Only thing I did differently was add about two more Tbsp. buttermilk because it seemed too dry and about one teas. of carraway seeds. Everybody loved this bread. I would definitely make this again.

Rating: 3
I have had trouble in the past w/ soda breads either turning out dry b/c of adding too much flour, or coming out undercooked and doughy. This recipe has great directions--esp. helpful is buttering and flouring the baking sheet. The bread turned out just right: fully cooked, yet moist and fragrant. Thanks for this recipe! I wouldn't be afraid to make this for company.

Rating: 4
We've been making this recipe since if first appeared in the magazine and we continue to make this fabulous recipe again and again. It is so quick and, most importantly, delicious! I have reviewed this recipe before and over time, I have made a few adjustments. I have always added 2 tsp. shortening to keep the bread moist and less crumbly (it works very nicely) and I also add 3 Tbs. white sugar and 3 Tbs. brown sugar. I use half dried cranberries (Craisins) and half raisins. Lately, I've been soaking them overnight in cream sherry. The dough is quite sticky after these modifications, so I skip cutting the "X" on top. After baking, I melt 2 Tbs. butter and brush the fresh-from-the-oven loaves. The crust stays soft and, needless to say, it tastes and looks great! We have eaten this bread with Corned Beef and Cabbage with Potatoes and Carrots, but it is a big hit on its own!! We will definitely always keep the caraway seeds. They are a perfect complement to this recipe--yummy!

I served this with the corned beef and cabbage to guests and they all though this was the best soda bread they had ever tasted. I doubled the sugar, eliminated the caraway seeds and used currants. This one is a keeper.

I used unbleached all-purpose flour and omitted the caraway seeds. I served slices of toasted soda bread alongside cheddar (and Lager and Stout) as guests arrived for a St. Patrick's Day supper. Rave reviews for the bread which, unlike many "americanized" recipes, is not too sweet and still tastes of soda. I'll definitely use this recipe again.

Rating: 4
Okay so as usual I read through several of the reviews, and once again am glad I did!! I know nothing re: carraway so I skipped it completely. I did as suggested and use 1/2 c raisins and 1/2 craisins (great for "curb appeal".) I used 2 c white and 2 c wheat flour (yummm!) I have never had soda bread, but seemed like it was supposed to be sweet (according to other reviews). So, I added 2 tbl sugar a&2 tbl brown sugar. AND to make sure it was not too crumbly or hard to cut thru, I add 2 tbl butter (chilled, but not HARD, "cut" it into dry ingredients until it was pea sized) and then added the 1 tbl bacon grease just before adding raisins/craisins. I got rave reviews from the folks at our dinner table tonight!!! All of them had soda bread prior and said my version was the BEST (could actually cut it and have a slice not just crumb). The 2 loaves were gone in seconds!

17Mar03 Just came in from sharing both loaves of bread with my colleagues. Not a crumb left! I did vary the loaves a bit- one with caraway and raisins "Irish" and one with dried cranberries and no caraway "Irish-American".Served homemade apple butter with just a tad of Irish whiskey added, KerryGold butter and some samples of Irish farmhouse cheddar and blue cheeses (great with either version of the bread!) Note that the suggestion of 3 tbs each white and brown sugar was just too sweet for my taste. Otherwise, wonderful!

Very Simple and very delicious straight out of the oven with butter. I skipped the caraway and raisins and sugar. I will experiment with whole wheat flour as well.

Followed the recipe, just as stated. Delicious - LOVED the raisins AND caraway seeds. The buttermilk makes it a bit more moist (thank God) and dense than the typical soda bread recipe. SO EASY and everyone LOVES it - won't wait 'til St. Paddy's day for the next round.

This bread is delicious! We left out the caraway seeds, and instead used half Craisins, half raisins. Needs a little more sugar, so I usually add one tablespoon of brown sugar. Definitely have it toasted with butter and jam. Yum!

After trying many different recipes for soda bread this one is a winner! It is so much like the Irish Soda bread I used to have back home on Long Island made by friends from Dublin! The only thing I did not add were the caraway seeds and I added a little less raisins than the recipe called for. This bread is great straight from the oven or later, toasted for breakfast.

This was fast, easy, and delicious! I took a previous cook's advice and substituted currants for the raisins, added 1/4 c. sugar, and omitted the caraway seeds. Spread with butter, it was a wonderful accompaniment to my morning cup of tea -- tasted like a scone without all the fat!

Wish could go along with all the raves. I found the caraway WAY too overpowering and the crust was so hard I could hardly cut it. Maybe I overbaked it though. My kids spit it out but my husband ate it. Maybe I'll try again with a lot less caraway.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, this was my first time making soda bread, I used 1/2 white, 1/2 whole wheat flour, baked the loaves at 375 for 35 minutes, and we could barely cut it with a very sharp knife, it seemed like it was too done, so kind of dry, hard, etc. We cut a couple slices out of the middle and microwaved it and then used butter, it tasted really good, I like the raisins & caraway seeds, but I need to figure out what I did wrong, did I overbake?, overknead? underknead? Help, I'd like to try again hopefully with better results. - J

I bake bread a lot, and this quickbread (no yeast) recipe by far yielded the nicest, slightly dense, pleaseantly chewy crumb! I love the caraway-raisin flavor contrast. I ground my caraway seeds in a mill before adding, and used reduced fat buttermilk. I'll be taking this recipe out every St. Patrick's Day I bet. Erin go bragh, etc.

I carelessly read the recipe and added 2 T bacon grease to the batter (instead of butter)--and it turned out great. I still brushed the top with melted butter. Also, I soaked the raisins in a little rum. I made it into one loaf instead of two so that lenghthened the baking time. It was great and I will make it again.

I plan to make this recipe along with corned beef and cabbage. I simply buy a corned beef, put it in my pressure cooker along with the included seasonings, cove with water and cook for 20-30 minutes. Then I remove the corned beef and pressure cook the cabbage in the same water. (Refer to your pressure cooker for general time guidelines.) Tender, delicious and QUICK.
