This dish was amazing! It only took minute to throw together too. I will definitely make this again.

Quite good & a quick weeknight dinner. Of course it really comes down to your curry paste - good curry paste will = good dish. Addition of about 1 tblsp of fish sauce in lieu of seasoning with salt helps quite a bit as does about 2 tsp of sugar to get the balance of sour/sweet/salty that most Thai dishes try to achieve.

Very easy, good but not great. Followed original recipe using Thai Kitchen Red Curry paste, tripled the amount and there was just no heat. Disappointed - thought it could have been a tad creamier in texture too.

HONEY!!!!! from whomever posted this recipe....THANK YOU! i luv Thai food....and this recipe is simple but soooooooooo yummy!!!!! me and roomie like it spicy so i doubled the Red Curry Paste but followed everything else to the tee. One thing for sure....allow the sauce to cook down for appropriate thickness. SO YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I added a lot more veggies. Bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, poblano peppers and some green beans (I couldn't find chinese long beans). Plus tons of cilantro. It was good, but it didn't come out quite as flavorful as I like it, and I even added more curry paste than the recipe called for. Will make again...maybe with less juice so it will be thicker. Thanks for the recipe :)

I thought this was a good base to work with. I added many more items juice of one lime, brown sugar, fresh ginger, crushed red pepper. I added an assortment of veggies for an all-in-one meal. I look forward to making this again.

This was EASY and so good! I'd add a little more curry and/or cayenne for a bit of heat.

I thought this was excellent. Very easy and for a fast for a nice weeknight-or any night-meal. I used light milk and simmered longer. I'll try will some veggies next time for a little more color-but delicious as is.

The shrimp, done in this sauce, was EXCEPTIONAL, as should have been the whole recipe if I had read it more thoroughly. I sauteed a little diced poblano pepper in butter before adding the curry "paste". I couldn't figure out why the sauce was SO BLAND before I added the shrimp, so I added lots of black pepper and dry cumin powder. Also, I added some sliced fresh mushrooms when I added the shrimp. Well, the sauce turned out just OK, and now I realize that I used Thai red curry SAUCE (what I had on the shelf), instead of curry PASTE. (Hubby really liked this, despite my goof.) Well, live and learn to READ!!! Does anyone out there know how to sub curry sauce for the paste?? Thanks in advance.

Oh my! What fabulous flavors! I have made with chicken and chicken broth also. I throw in a bit of chicken bouillon to flavor it up a bit more. Rave reviews from my guests. All want the recipe!

I substituted chicken stock and cubed chicken breasts and added diced tomatoes, really excellent, even the 2 yr- old ate it!

Quite good! I added thin sliced onion with the curry paste in the beginning, otherwise followed as written, served over brown rice. Will definitely make again.

This dish was simple, quick, and a fragrant crowd pleaser. I modified it by adding cayenne pepper and fresh ginger. Also, a nutty basmati rice is a wonderful substitute if jasmine rice is hard to find. Overall, this dish is a speedy, tasty winner!

Really delicious and incredibly easy! I've made this many times now, especially on busy weeknights. Green curry paste works well too.

I found this recipe incredibly bland, not worth making again. I much prefer the Thai green curry recipe on this site.

Very good and easy. I added some snow peas at the end to have some veggies (and some more color) in it. Served over jasmine rice, perfect. A definite keeper

Very easy and delicious. Too spicy for the kids. Wouldn't change a thing for me, but for the kids cut red curry paste in half. It took 10 minutes to reduce the liquid to the proper consistency, perfect!

Wonderful! Not only was this fast and easy...it was perfet for the final stages of bronchitis I have. Fiery curry and yummy rice...knocks out the last of that virus. I followed the recipe exactly.

Rating: 4
Amazingly easy. I couldn't find red curry in my grocery store, so I bought yellow curry in these small "bricks". I have never seen them packaged like that and didn't know what to expect but I dropped one into the pan and it melted right away. So it was fine, but yellow in color, not red. (not that I expected it to turn red). Anyway, I made this with jasmine rice and it was delish. Will make again, for sure.

Have made this several times for an easy, weeknight meal and it comes out beautifully every time. I always follow the advice from the Cook from Boston (11/10/03): Add 1 teaspoon of brown sugar to negate the spice and instead of clam juice break in 1/2 cube of chicken boullion. Curry thickens up nicely. I also cut the curry in half for my spice tolerance level, use lite coconut milk and garnish with bean sprouts and chopped peanuts. 4 forks for ease of preparation and intensity of flavor.

My first experience with Thai food. I thought it was very easy and really good. Added peas to stretch the dish.

So easy and quick, and tasty too. Made this for my friends and myself, there were no leftovers. I've never worked with curry before, but this recipe is so simple that I couldn't mess it up. I kicked up the amount of curry slightly, on reflection it did not need it.

This was amazing and so easy to prepare. My husband loved it. I also used low fat coconut, and it worked great. Will definitely make this over and over.

This makes a wonderful, rich, fast and easy, authentic tasting sauce that can be used over other seafood or meats. I tried it with tilapia (pan-broiled the tilapia by itself, then added it to the almost thickened sauce. I know chicken would work well with this EASY delicious sauce! Just adjust the curry paste if you can't take that much heat.

This came out very tasty, and it's so easy! I followed another reviewer's idea to use 1 tsp. red curry paste and 1 tsp. yellow curry powder. Even with the reduced red curry, it's getting near my spiciness tolerance, so do watch out unless you're used to fiery curries!

Rating: 4
Super easy & super yummy! I sqeezed extra lime juice over the top before serving.

Rating: 3
I made this as is but used lite coconut milk. It was too spicy for our taste, so will make again with 1/2 the curry paste. I really liked this recipe for a weekday meal, partly because it was so fast and simple. I think with 1/2 the curry paste it will be fantastic! I plan to add snow peas next time for a little color and crunch.

This dish is out of this world, so delicious!!! It is great to substitute the shrimp with fresh salmon skinned/cut up. It is worth it to do the extra work!! I would make it over again & again!!!

I've just finished this dish, with a few substitutions of what I had on hand like already cooked shrimp, parsley instead of cilantro, and 1tsb of yellow curry mixed with 1tsp of red chili paste to make my curry paste. I also threw in some peas and carrots. It turned out wonderfully well and it was really quick.

I don't know what happened, but I could not get the sauce to thicken. I even tried to save it with the old standby, cornstarch, but with no success. The flavour was okay, but not good enough to repeat this one!

I love it when cooks post recipe reviews, noting that they totally deviated from the original recipe but in the end "something seemed to be missing". Duh.

I doubled the red curry paste, used lite coconut milk and omitted the clam juice. It was good but something seemed to be missing. Next time, I'll add fish sauce and Thai basil.

I liked this recipe very much -- tasty and easy to make. I made some changes: I used scallops instead of shrimp, and green curry instead of red (that was what I had) and it turned out great. I also added some some veggies and a little pineapple I had. Also, I omitted the clam juice (I didn't want to run to the store), I used white wine instead with a splash of fish sauce. Delicious!

Just a note to with regards to spicy, we thought at 1 tbsp of red curry paste it was too spicy, so advice as to adding more curry should be taken based on taste. Also, added carrots and peas to a good effect!

Rating: 3
Very tasty.......took the advice of a previous reviewer and doubled the curry paste as I like it very spicy, lite coconut milk and used a dry sherry in place of clam broth. I find bottled clam broth leaves an unpleasant aftertaste and is too salty....reduced the sauce a bit more to thicken it up. Next time I plan to saute some veggies to add to probably mushrooms, onions, and like the idea of a few nuts as well. Given how quickly it comes together it is a definite keeper

Rating: 4
Very quick and a good change of pace from the usual meat-and-potato fare. I used scallops instead of shrimp and also added a few crushed peanuts at the end. We started the dinner with a pork satay and finished it with coconut ice cream.

I let this reduce until the sauce thickened up, and served it over rice. Also used a light coconut milk (I have substituted it in several recipes, always with good results). Quick, simple and different.

Rating: 2
Way too bland--I would have used about twice the amount of red curry paste. I also think the clam juice dilutes the wonderful flavor and thickness of the coconut milk. Good concept, I just prefer spicier curries. Skip (or at least halve) the clam juice, double the curry, and the rest works well for a quick curry.

Easy to make and very tasty. A repeater for sure.

To those that have complaints about hwo watery the curry is, just let the curry boil down more prior to adding shrimp. It says about 7 minutes, I usually do it about 10 or so. This thickens the sauce and makes it more intense (read spicier). Also note, that when you order curry dishes, the come in copious amounts of curry at the restuarant. This is natural. Just spoon it over your rice. Cant get enough, I say.

Rating: 1
Try the following modifications: add 1 teaspoon of sugar brown (negate the spice), instead of clam juice break in 1/2 cube of chicken bullion. It will still add flavour but the curry won't become as watery.

Rating: 4
Easy and delicious. "Restaurant quality", according to my husband. Took 25 min start to finish. I buy frozen shrimp that is peeled/deveined, but w/tail intact and thaw for this recipe. I used the full amt of curry paste. My daughter, who does not like overly spicy food, loved it. Sticky rice alongside sops up the yummy sauce.

Rating: 4
This was so easy, I had an exotic dinner ready in twenty minutes. I used light coconut milk and it came out fine. Great for Atkins dieters (without the rice, as if it was a soup). I too would tone down the curry paste to about 1/2 tablespoon, unless of course you like it really spicy.

Rating: 3
I love this recipe! It is so easy to fix and has a really great blend of flavors. I also used lite coconut milk, and found that I had to thicken it a bit so it wouldn't be too soupy. My husband loved it and we have made it several times, adding other elements to the recipe like potato and mushroom to add other textures to the delicious flavor.

Rating: 1
This was certainly very quick...and not bad. But it felt like a waste of coconut milk and clam juice--made qay to much sauce and very watery. I'd cut back red curry paste, too. Much better and also very quick--a real wow--is the creamed grits with sauteed shrimp in the same issue (but not on website).

Rating: 2
Sometimes trying too many substitues with such a simple recipe isn't the best thing. I only had lite Coconut milk, so I had to thicken it up with corn starch and only had curry powder instead of curry paste. That being said, it was good with the substitutes, but next time I make it I think it will be better with the ingredients as listed.

This recipe goes into the make over and over again category. Quick and easy to prepare, and delicious. Only made one change, I forgot to buy clam juice, so substituted a homemade shrimp stock. Next time I plan cook the sauce down a little more.

This is so good! I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out because of how simple the recipe was, but it's simplicity makes it even better. I also added cubed tofu. I know it's just shrimp curry, but I gave it 4 forks because of the ease of preparation.
