I meant to give this 4 forks on my earlier review!

I made this as a stand alone salsa (doubled the recipe) and served it with tortilla chips. It was a huge hit and was gone in no time! Next time I will likely add a bit more jalapeno for a little extra kick.

This is my wife's favorite salsa, and I am requested to make it for every get together we have. The only thing I do is make it the night before and let it blend.

My favorite salsa ever--way better than mango salsa or anything else. I love it with those lime tortilla chips (do they even make those anymore?) and nothing else. I will gorge.

Possibly my favorite salsa of all time! I've never bothered actually pairing it with protein--tortilla chips are all I need to enjoy this salsa.

Used chopped grape tomatoes instead of 2 larger ones. This was beautiful as well as delicious. Served over grilled orange roughy for a light supper. UUM!

FABULOUS!! Big hit at Bunco. Very fresh & delish. The mint is wonderful against the fresh pineapple.

This is by far our favorite way to have pork and is a big hit with parties. We love the salsa and generally double it!

I didn't like this but I'm not sure why. Maybe the fruit salsa thing is just not for me. I followed the recipe exactly.

Yum, yum, yum....I have made this one over and over again. Generous portions so halve the recipe.

My husband is not a fan of avocado but this won him over. Very, very good--as is!

This salsa literally disappeared at a cocktail party- I served it with the grilled jerk chicken from this site and tortilla chips. Yum! A nice change from guacamole!

Excellent, but taste before seasoning. I found salt was not necessary.

Try this salsa, it is excellent. The mixture of sweet, savory, and a bit of hot was a perfect foil for the pork!

a great thing to do with an avocado that is not quite ripe enough to mash...delicious

I will go 3-1/2 on this one. Yummy, especially if you are an avocado lover. Tried with pork, will definitely use with fish, chicken or seafood on the grill.

I doubled the recipe for the salsa and used it for the pork tenderloin. There was nothing left and it was suberb.

My Husband saw the recipe and had to try his hand at making it. We had it with grilled chicken and it was so good that he made another batch right after dinner! It definitely works better with fresh pineapple than canned. I could see this working with grilled or southwest dishes too.

This was absolutely wonderful. Excellent companion to the pork tenderloin. The pineapple added a very interesting taste. A definite keeper! I will make this again to accompany many other dishes.

This is a great relish. This was my first attempt at making a relish and my husband loved it. We served it with grilled pork chops. It was a wonderful compliment.

Wow! This was incredible - I changed nothing and followed the recipe exactly. It is definitely worth the trouble to use all fresh ingredients. I served it with grilled Mahi Mahi - yummy!

Wonderful recipe! Served it with Easter dinner with chicken and fish and it was a huge hit, the pineapple makes it very different. Used lemon juice and red onion because I had both on hand and it was fine, next time will try it with a Maui onion for the sweetness. Visually very appealing as well!

Excellent!! A wonderful accompaniment to the SPICED PORK TENDERLOIN AND AVOCADO SALSA it was intended for (here in Epi files). Hubby raved. I'll be making this again and again. Worked great with canned pineapple too. Can't wait to try the salsa as an accompaniment to a grilled fish like maybe halibut, shark or snapper.

This recipe was very tasty. A lot of chopping, but easy to make. Great combination of ingredients. I made it for guests and everyone loved the pork and the salsa. This is a keeper.

Yes, this was delicious, but it was nowhere near all the chopping and all the money spent on preparing it. i doubled it up a bit to make enough for chipping and dipping at a barbeque. I used grape tomatoes, and they were good. My boyfriend says it was awesome, but it should have been juicier. Nice, but I say, save your time and buy premade.

I'm really tired of salsa (I'm convinced that the baby boomers invested heavily in cilantro and jalapeno futures some time back), but tried this because I was intrigued with the pineapple/avocado combination. This is one salsa I'll use again.

This is a good all-purpose fruit salsa. It would probably also be good with chicken or a firm white fish like halibut or swordfish. The oil olive could probably be deleted from the recipe without a problem for someone who is watching the fat intake. Nice recipe.
