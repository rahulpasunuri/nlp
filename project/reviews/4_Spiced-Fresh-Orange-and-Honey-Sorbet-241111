Delicious! I served this as a dessert to boeuf bourguignon. It made a really refreshing and flavorful end to the meal. Because of the spices, it is really well suited to the winter, not to mention because that is when citrus fruit is at its best! I served it with tuilles.

Made the sorbet to bring to a dinner party and it was a huge hit. Served it with Orange-Chocolate Biscotti, also from this site,and homemade chocolate gelato. Followed the recipe to a "t", used cardamom pod vs star anise and the flavors were sublime. I recommend chilling the syrup before processing in ice cream maker and it does take longer than the recipe suggests. Also, on my gas cook top the liquid took longer than 12 minutes to reduce to 2 cups syrup but the end result is worth the wait. Delicious.

If you make sure the sugar is completely dissolved and chill the mixture to about 40 degrees before you add it to the machine, you will get a smoother texture.

Glorious sorbet! I skipped the ginger, star anise and bay leaf and added a couple tablespoons chopped mint with the cloves instead. Served with white stilton with candied lemon peel, more mint and slivered almonds as a pallet cleanser. Delightful!

So good! I made this as one of the desserts for a Greek party and it was a huge hit. I reduced the sugar and it was still plenty sweet. The spice flavors are lovely. People already asking me to make it again!

I make a lot of sorbets but everyone just loved the flavors of this one. I did not have reular oranges so I used blood oranges. There was not enought fresh blood orange juice so I substituted 1 cup of regular orange juice. The color was a very nice deep pink. It does take longer than most sorbets in the ice cream maker about 45 minutes. Definitely a keeper.

Delicious! We were very pleased - the orange, honey and spices are a great combination. It was light, creamy, and refreshing and made a great dessert. The only thing I might change was that I used two big anise stars and would probably only use one next time.

Loved this recipe! It is fresh and nicely spiced. We will undoubtably be making this again.

My husband made this for a party we hosted last night. It was absolutely incredible. Ours was a bit darker orange, but had a creamy look. We agree that you can cut back on the sugar, especially if your OJ is sweet!

You get the light cream color - and a lighter, fluffier sorbet - by putting the cool syrup and juice mixture into a blender and whip it up just before you freeze it ! This works for lots of fruit sorbets.

this stuff is amazing. it is highly sweet but mellowed with butter cookies. i added an extra clove and used cinnamon for the anise/cardamom--who keeps that stuff around. i mean really.

Delicious! What a refreshing, interesting sorbet. The citrus peel and ginger added a little texture, too. I agree that it did not look like the picture, but I enjoyed the brighter orange color. Next time I would use less sugar, but keep the honey the same.

I made this for a family Christmas Eve dinner for which I needed a gluten- and dairy- free dessert. I also made Strawberry Balsamic Vinegar Sorbet and Raspberry Lime Sorbet. They were all delicious, but this was the favorite of most, including a 3-year old whom I did not think would like it because of the spices. Mine was definitely a darker orange than the picture and not as creamy.

Great tasting and smelling, but what we came out with did not look anything like the photo in the magazine. In the photo, it's nearly white and creamy looking, whereas our sorbet was honey colored and not creamy at all. The reduction can be a little bit tricky, too. It could be that we just messed up, but I sort of doubt that, since we made several batches and each turned out the same.
