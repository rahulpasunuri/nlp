The best apple pie I've ever made, and it always gets raves from my guests!! The dough is great made with apple cider or apple juice. Once I accidentally forgot to put the streusel topping underneath the top crust, so I sprinkled it over the dough. It turned out great and everyone loved it. Also, once my apples did not cook through. I don't know what happened -- one of my guests said that had happened to her on another apple pie recipe, too.

Great recipe - my family just loves this apple pie. I have made it twice and the first time I accidentally added the cinnamon to the sour cream mixture, but as everyone loved it, I did the same intentionally the second time. I used Granny Smith apples and a store-bought crust. Yummy!

My favorite apple pie recipe! The only changes I make are leaving out the white sugar in the topping and halving the sugar in the crust. I have given the recipe to a friend who complained that the apples didn't cook - she'd sliced them very thin and stacked them densely in the plate. I cut larger wedges by hand that arrange themselves haphazardly, and I find they cook much better that way.

I wanted to like this pie - I really did - but it really didn't work out that way. It wasn't outright gross, but my husband and I agreed that the pie consists of a bunch of competing tastes and textures that just don't work well together at all.

The sour cream make this recipe fabulous! I make it with store-bought crust - and without the top crust for a streusel-type topping.

I have been making this pie at Thanksgiving for years and it is my absolute favorite special occasion pie. I use my own butter crust but otherwise follow the directions. The only time I had a problem was when I used apples that apparently didn't have enough moisture and just didn't cook through properly. So now I use Yellow Delicious and it is terrific!

Delish! I didnt make the crust, opting instead for the one from Smitten Kitchen, but the pie is perfect as written.

This pie came out so good. I used the plain easy butter crust, and added candied ginger to the topping. Rave reviews.

I LOVE this pie, and so does everyone else to whom I serve it. Flavor is excellent. The apple juice (can also use apple cider) in the crust is a great addition. Just follow the recipe and it's great.

this was the first pie i ever made. and the best! I first made it for national pie day in January and have made it at least half a dozen times since. And I finally figured out the top crust: roll it out and put it in the freezer for a while. when you take it out, it will be hard. within a minute or two, it will soften. work with it immediately, and it will not fall apart on you!and don't forget to put flour on the wax paper when rolling it out. and i wasn't home, so got stuck using a wine bottle instead of a rolling pin! worked just as well. finally i mastered this pie!

I made this pie today, and although I would not say it was horrible, I definately would not make it again.

Saved this recipe since it appeared in 2000 and made it for the first time Jan 07. Can´t tell you what we´ve been missing!!! This is the yummiest apple pie I´ve ever had anywhere. Quite simple to make. The kids not only help, they love it!!! I´ve made it several times since I dusted off the clipping of the recipe earlier this year. I have only changed the flour )use half all purpose, half whole wheat.

Great recipe. I put my own spin on it and added a cup of crasins that I boiled in a cup of water & 2tbls of Grand Manier. (Make after while preparing the crust and cool in fridge. The alcohol cooks out and is so deluted that they only enhance the flavor.)I love cranberrys in apple pies for the holidays. Everyone raved. I used my food processor a lot. Made my crust, sliced the apples and pulsed the walnut topping. I think for those that have complained of a not fully cooked pie probably didn't cut them thin enough. For a delicate, fully cooked apple pie the secret is thin slices. (Same tip for scalloped potatoes or quick cooking for mashed potatoes.) Use the mandoline or the food processor. Its fast and easy.

I took fat and carbs out by using one crust with oil, light sour cream, 1 tsp cinnamon with the apples. Sprinkle walnuts then streusel topping. Still got wow's all around from Thanksgiving guests. All wanted the receipe - Great

I had the same problem as another cook..the pie inside wasn't done but the crust, even tented with foil, was too well done. I followed recipe exactly...maybe the 350 temp was too low? I'm making Barefoot Contessa's apple pie in the morning and tossing this one!

This is the best apple pie I've ever had. I normally don't like pie crust all that much, but this crust is amazing. For the topping I put whole walnut pieces in the food processor with the other ingredients, and added a couple tablespoons of cold butter and flour for a streusel effect. Thanks to the suggestions of other reviewers, I also used the slicer blade on the food processor to cut the apples, and they turned out perfectly - still with a little bit of crispness, but also cooked enough.

This was delicious! I halved the amount of the ingredients for the filling, put it into a pre-made crust, folded the edges inward and it was an excellent, not-to-thick pie. My 7 year-old is raving.

Fantastic....a little different then the usual!

I just made this pie for New Years Eve and it was terrific. So good, in fact, that I am already making it again! It helps to have a mandoline to slice the apples very thin. Also, I used a store-bought pie crust to save time and it was still great!

WOW! I followed the advice of others and added 1 T of lemon juice and 1 t of cinnamon. This was the big hit of my holiday party! I will definitely make this again.

I just tried making this this weekend, I have made many apple pies and this was one of the better ones. Tips: I made the pastry slightly wetter than called for in the recipe and it turned out fine (flaky and tender).If you have a "hot" oven (I do) the pastry will brown faster than expected,and be sure to slice the apples thinly 1/4 inch or thinner so all are cooked through. Finally I would recommend pecans rather than the walnuts called for in the recipe. Nice pie! Easy to make.

I just made this receipe for the second time. My husband loves it. I use frozen pie crust, but the sour cream and walnuts make it special. Very crunchy and sweet.

I made this cake last night out of the Silver Palate cook book. I used a recipe for classic pie crust in stead of the one given here. The cake came out ok, not outstanding. I reccomend the recipe from Bon Apetit that also appears here. I think it is much better.

This is a wonderful alternative to the standard recipes you see. The result is creamy and flavorful. Make sure your nuts are fresh, fresh, fresh and lightly toasted or don't bother adding them at all. A TBS or 2 of lemon juice and a bit more cinammon adds that extra pizzaz that brings this dish to 4 forks.

Help! This recipe sounded good, and the first reviewer gave it 4 FORKS, so what did we do wrong? The apples (fresh-picked Cortlandts)were crispy, as if they hadn't cooked enough. We baked it for an hour, and the juices were running (good thing we put aluminum foil down on the oven floor). It seemed as if the apples and sour cream hadn't melded together. Any suggestions?

This is such a great apple pie recipe! The walnuts give it a kick- and they toast while the pie bakes so they are a little crunchy and give yummy flavor. Definitely will make this one again.
