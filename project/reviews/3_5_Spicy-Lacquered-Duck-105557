I have made this over and over to rave reviews, but with some modifications. The marinade for this is great--but use a different cooking method. Marinate the duck for two days, but less is still ok. Then: Pat the duck dry inside and out with paper towels, then poke the duck through the skin all over with a fork. Roast at 350 and hour on each side, then blast the oven up to 425 and roast for 20 min on each side. It's done! I reduce the marinade with a bit of stock to made a hoisin like sauce, and I serve it with chinese sesame pancakes and pickled vegetables. THIS IS TO DIE. A labor intensive meal, but a wonderful choice if it's someone's birthday or something. You will love it.

This was delicious and easy. I only marinated the duck for one day, but the flavor really shone through.

I made this yesterday and it was my third time I make this dish, sadly this time was not good as the previous ones. I did follow the advice about not discarding the marinade and added lots of port to it, I also whisked 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch and 1/2 of flour to increase consistency... it was fantastic! But the real challenge is the skin, and this time was still greasy and the duck meat perfectly done so I had to take it off the oven. I didn't go for the 400 F because it would burn and that might have been the problem but felt it was going to burn. My advice that had worked previously is to cover the wings and legs with aluminum foil. The flavor was sensational and it is indeed a challenge, I'll try this again and again... Good luck!

i made this tonight and even with a 400 degree oven, the top half of the duck was charred -the wings entirely black carbon. i pat the duck very dry before roasting. i didn't check on it, perhaps that was the problem. any ideas how to keep the duck from going from laquered to blackened?? have not tasted it yet..am almost afraid to.

Don't toss away the sauce. Pour into a sauce pan, Add a pint of port wine & reduce to half; simmer for four minutes & shut off heat: as duck cooks. When the drippings are ready (duck is done), add this to the "sauce". Add garlic oil to taste. Low heat boil "sauce". Medium low if you're in a hurry. Crack black pepper & salt Heat till hot, use as a dip for the duck. Alternate: Add pepper vinegar or hot sauce.

It's a great dish, just have to watch the skin of the duck to be really crunchy! Great Dinner!

I love duck, and this was a very nice, easy variation. I split the duck into quarters before marinating. I added a little grated fresh ginger and a couple of start anise pods to the marinade, and heated it to dissolve the sugar. I left out the Chinese 5-spice because I was out (oops!). Cooked on a foil-lined pan, skin-side down for about 20 minutes, then skin-side up for about 15 minutes, drawing off the fat, periodically. Nice and crispy, in 4 attractive individual portions. Served with plum sauce to dip, rice and sauteed long beans. Yummy.

Loved this recipe. Next time I will remove the skin before I marinate, so the meat gets more of the flavor.

I used this recipe for my Thanksgiving dinner. There were only 4 of us, so we decided to have something smaller but still special. My parents and husband, who are rather picky eaters, absolutely LOVED the way the duck turned out. I used a lower sodium soy sauce (which was plenty salty), and the duck came out with just the right amount of flavor. I did take the duck out after the 2 days of marinating, pat it dry a little, and then let it air dry (on a rack placed on a cookie sheet) in the refrigerator for a day. It helped make the skin a bit crispier, but I think the secret to having a crispier skin is to make sure that the duck never sits in its rendered fat while it's roasting.

I love this recipe. It's true that it's not something I would serve on plates -- a little tricky. It's great as a finger dish when it's cold! Has anyone figured out how to keep it from becoming charred? I've tried using aluminum foil on the wings and legs to no avail. I even lowered the oven temperature.

This recipe was GREAT. I made it and the Garlic Port Duck recipe also for the Washington State Cougars v. Oregon Ducks football game. (We were roasting Duck .. get it.. :-) but I marinated this only 1 day instaed of 2 which I think made all the difference in the world as this marinade could have been way to overpowering otherwise. My kids devoured it and they 3,4 & 8. They kept asking for more!

I thought that this recipe was fantastic. I served it for my family and my in-laws and I got rave reviews from everyone. No complaints here, and it's very easy too!

Loved this recipe! Used an almost 7 pound Muscovy duck so it was enough for 4 with some leftovers. The marinade brought a wonderful subtle flavor to the meat without overpowering it. Only problem - the skin did not crisp up. Four very particular eaters were very happy.

I have to first say that I love duck. I now have to go on to say that I felt that this recipe did not enhance the flavor of the duck, but rather covered it up. This marinade was too strong and too salty for the delicate flavor of duck. Lacquered implies hard and shinny. The skin had a lacquered look, but was soft, not crispy. If you don't love duck, then this recipe is fine for you, if you do love duck, I think you'll be as disappointed as I. Two thumbs down!

I love duck, and get it out all the time. But when faced with presenting this on plates, I was flummoxed. So maybe that colored my view of the recipe. I did think the marinade was wonderful, but would likely be just as good on chicken. I found that it took away a bit from the nice gaminess that duck often has.

I made this for my companion, after the meal, I was upgraded to lover status. I, too thought the marinade was a bit salty and would use the low sodium soy sauce next time. And believe me, after the response I received, there will be a next time. Cheers, Skyye ; )

The aroma coming from the oven was sexually stimulating, the taste of the meat orgasmic.

This marinade is fantastic and really gave the duck a lot of flavor. I had a 4.87# duck and the roasting time was not enough. We ended up putting it in the microwave to finish it off since I had already shut off the oven. I've only made duck twice and I was very disappointed in how little meat there was. In no way would this have served 4 people.

I used boneless duck breasts and marinated 24 hours then cooked them at 450 for about 15 minutes. They were delicous though the skin really didn't get crispy, maybe because of the shorter cooking time. Next time I'll try a whole duck. The marinade is GREAT!

Having read the ingrediants, and not being a fan of duck, I made this with a porkloin, and it was wonderful. I marinated the pork for about 12 hours, and the 'lacquer' was just fine. I'd use low sodium soy sauce, it was a bit salty. I want to try it with chicken, and a pork tenderloin.
