I won't make this again. Other recipes in the book are good but this one was not our favorite. Rather flavorless and an odd texture

Far too much barley in proportion to the rest of the ingredients! If I were to make this again I would halve the amount of barley.

The first time we made this (in a crockpot)I would've rated this 1 fork as it turned out very thick, congealed and unrecognizable. We tried it again but simmered it on the stove for about 45 minutes and it came out perfectly. We also used a very nice Chardonnay, added an extra cup of water and stirred it about every 10 minutes which helped us monitor the consistency. This is a very nice Sunday dinner recipe and holds up well for lunches. Everyone in lunchroom commented on what smelled so amazing. Needless to say bring extra for sharing!

I made this for a fundraiser and it disappeared quickly! It was deliciously aromatic and the orange added a very nice kick to the flavor. I substituted pearl couscous for the barley in the same quantity and the texture was perfect.

This was not a favorite of my family.

Unique flavor balance but poor texture. Too much barley...soaked up all liquids. Perhaps cut barley quantity. Advance prep work worth time for flavor blend but texture needs to change.

This picture does not reflect the proportions in this recipe. Though I used less barley than the recipe directed (1 1/4 c instead of 1 1/2), the barley was overwhelming. I would use half that amount. Also, I needed to add an extra 2 c of liquid (broth) about an hour into the cooking time when it seemed like the drying mass of food was on the verge of sizzling. Finally, you probably need to at least double the vegetables to reflect the proportion in the photo.
