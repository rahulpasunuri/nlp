I have never had homemade chicken and dumplings before and this recipe was spot on perfect. I wasn't able to follow the recipe to a 'T' because we were waiting for the snow plow while I was making this and I discovered that I was out of vegetable oil (so used olive) as well as thyme (not sure how I overlooked that, so I had to use oregano and parsley instead). I also didn't have any apple cider or juice so I just added a little more broth. I imagine it would have been even better if I had been able to follow the recipe exactly. My other comments are otherwise not newsbreaking. I'll definitely make this again but next time I'm going to use boneless chicken for ease of eating. It really is difficult to eat chicken on the bone with a soup spoon. Other comment is that I decided to cut corners and use bisquick (which I usually like) but I think the other reviewers are right about this one: homemade dumplings can't be beat.

I usually make the Chicken with Pan Gravy and Cornmeal Dumplings from this site, and it is reliably good and easy. This recipe was good but it seemed to take an inordinately long time to prepare, with lots of cookware to wash up. The taste was nice, but the vegetables definitely need seasoning. We found it pretty bland as written. I also prefer to use boneless chicken, which browns faster and makes the dish easier to serve. Using chicken pieces, you have to fish around under the dumplings to find what you want.

I used this recipe for the left over turkey from Christmas, which means i had to replace the 'fried' chicken. it seemed like the dredging was important, a little fat, a little flour, so i used some bacon, then removed the bacon, but retained the drippings and added a T of flour. i used many more vegetables, including cauliflower and snow peas, fennel instead of celery, vidalia onions instead of shallots, and added garlic. i think really you can use whatever vegetables you like, and just porportion the liquid accordingly. i did need to use a little more olive oil to accomodate the extra vegetables. the dumplings were fantastic! no corn flavor or texture at all. i followed other reviewers advice and did not peek, i left them undisturbed. i can't imagine why other reviewers thought there was too much grainy texture...perhaps it was the style of corn meal used? i used Bob's Red Mill which is a fairly fine mill, which may have help. they were light and fluffy, very tasty, and absorbed a lot of the liquid, so you may want to add fewer dumplings to have more 'soup'. very robust for a winter's meal.

This is just a review of the dumplings, since we made our own soup . . . outstanding. Loved the cornmeal. We were careful not to overmix and left them undisturbed. They took a little longer to cook than indicated but were fluffy, flavorful, and a reminder that I do actually like dumplings

I have made this dish repeatedly since it first appeared, and always bring it to new parents for a treat. I make it exactly as written except I cook it longer and add abit more chicken stock. The dumplings really need to be undisturbed to be tender.

I only made the dumplings (made a chicken stew with boneless breast & thigh, onion, shallot and celery - peas in for the last 3 minutes - with fresh thyme, parsley and bay. THAT was good). Instead of dill, I put some chopped parsley and thyme in the dumplings. The dumplings were weird in texture (grainy and heavy) and had an overwhelming cornmeal flavor. Perhaps subbing semolina flour for the cornmeal might make for a nicer result?

this is a pretty good recipe, I cooked the chix in a crock pot with onion, garlic and freshly roasted peppers. I used the dumpling recipe and added a lil thyme and granulated garlic and 2 teaspoons of sugar. I have found that whenever I use cornmeal a lil sugar adds a real nice touch.

Rating: 3
Good recipe, but we tweaked it a bit to make it more to our tastes. I added salt and cracked pepper, which did a lot! Then I used only two or three leeks, but added a large onion, garlic, and crimini mushrooms. For the dumplings, I used 3/4 c heavy cream and 1/4 c plus 3 T milk. The dumplings were light and wonderful, and the soup was much better.

Tasty. I made several changes: added potatos and fennel bulb, a touch of rosemary and extra thyme, both of which were ground in a mortar before adding, and white wine along with the apple juice. The dumplings were tough - any suggestions? overall, good comfort food.

My first chicken and dumpling effort for the very Southern mother of my boyfriend. It turned out great despite my nervousness! I wasn't really sure what "chicken parts" referred to so we bought a whole chicken cut in parts. I basically followed the rest of the recipe except that I did saute some mushrooms to add in. And, I forgot to buy the dill for the biscuits so I added chives instead. Everything was delicious!

Too time and labor intensive for what I think are dubious results. Overly complex. What is it about the word "simple" that people on this forum don't seem to understand? An "Organic Chicken from Santa Rosa"? C'mon! I always get kudos whenever I whip up a batch of Cracker Barrel Chicken and Dumplings. After all, anything that is served up to over 12 million happy customers every year can't be all that bad.

Rating: 2
I was very surpised at how "okay but nothing spectacular" this recipe was, based on most of the other reviews. I didn't think it was particularly time-consuming, but it was fairly bland, and the dumplings were like play-dough. I followed the recipe to the letter, my baking powder was brand new, etc. The chicken was tender, sure, but the recipe from 1964 on this web site is much more flavorful. Also, a note to cooks: this is not a "pretty" dish. The vegetables cook down into a chunky colorless mush, and the dumplings take on the same muddy color as everything else. I was making this dish for a friend who'd just had a baby, and I felt I had to make another batch of dumplings and cook them in some leftover chicken broth, in order to have nice white dumplings to give some contrast to the mush. It was fine and we ate it all, but I'll go back to the 1964 recipe the next time I want chicken and dumplings.

This was really delicious and I didn't think it was too much work at all. Worth every cut, chop, and bite. I left out the juice, adding more broth, added a couple of yukon golds, but followed otherwise. I did not like the dumplings taste or texture. I've made better and will stick to those in the future when I make this dish again, which will be very soon.

This is an all time favorite with my family! It's the best Chicken & Dumpling recipe I have ever tried in my 30 plus years of cooking! I always use a cut up organic chicken from Santa Rosa. I have substituted when necessary, onion for leek, celeric for celery, orange juice for apple juice, parsley for dill, leave out the peas when I don't have any, and I use a whole tablespoon of Thyme. Just remember to drop the dumplings and leave them undisturbed until cooked. A wonderfully perfect cold winter meal!

I liked it. This was my first attempt at dumplings, and I had no problems. I didn't do the chicken recipe, but used leftover chicken and mushrooms with a can of cream of soup, and had dinner ready in 30-40 minutes. My son thought the dumplings were a little heavy, but then they're dumplings, right?

I have been making this recipe since it was first published. After over a decade, it is still one of my favorites when the weather turns cool. These dumplings can seem a little tricky to cook, but the key is a wide pot and patience: spoon the batter then let the dumplings sit and simmer before you try to move them about. Enjoy!

What a mess! I had never made dumplings before tonight, and I have to say there was more to it than I'd thought. I made a few mistakes (cornmeal too coarse, pot too deep and not wide enough) and ended up having to scoop out the dumplings and cook them in another pan, sort of like pancakes, because they were taking forever to cook and I was afraid the chicken would be overdone. Despite all this, the flavor was really delicious, and I'll definitely try again.

This dish is excellent! I made it with my own chicken stock which I made double rich, I believe homemade chicken stock makes a world of difference. This dish is so delicious I cannot wait to make it again.

Doubled the recipe and got rave reviews from the firehouse. Use high quality frozen chicken stock from a specialty grocery store (or make your own) The difference is worth the price/effort. Nice twist on the traditional dumplings and GREAT for people who don't like garlic.

I halved this recipe and used two chicken breast halfs instead of "parts". With half of all the ingredients, I added a little extra liquid. It was delicious. The biscuits had a wonderful flavor and texture. Next time I may try it with boneless chicken breast pieces, but it was good the way I made it the first time.

These are my favorite dumplings- I have used half and half or buttermilk-they are always so perfect, tender, perfectly doughy and so satisfying. I did not use the main recipe for the rest so can't speak for it but the dumplings are really good!

I have made this many times and my whole family loves it. I make 1/2 the dumpling recipe the first night. I think this is even better the next day, but I do make new dumplings. The soup gets thicker (sometimes I even add more broth) and the flavor intensifies. I think this would be dreadful with skinless, boneless chicken...it is not the same. I always use legs and thighs for their moistness. This is wonderful comfort food for a fall or winter night.

The dumplings were the best thing about this dish, and they were average at best - honestly the Bisquick recipe better. The cider made the sauce way too sweet, and the dish generally lacked any zip or distinction.

I thought this recipe was excellent. I did however modify it by taking the chicken off the bone before putting it in the mixture (dont like to work more when it is time too eat-just want to dig in) And I simmered the chicken in the mixture for 45 minutes. And instead of the dill in the dumplings I put it in the chicken mixture. It is alot of work but WELL worth the trouble!!

This is an excellent recipe when the the following modifications are made: Omit the cider, add more vegetables (e.g., corn from the cob, chopped fresh green beans) and use bisquick for the dumplings. With these modifications, the recipe results in a devine "comfort food" meal that everyone enjoys.

I too, was disappointed in this. My mother's ancient recipe tasted much better and was a lot easier to prepare. She lightly browned her chicken, added broth, carrots, celery and an onion and let it simmer til the chicken fell off the bone. Then she took it all out of the broth, de-boned the chicken, put it back in and laid the dumplings on top. Nice clear chickeny broth. The dumplings were okay in this recipe but not the best I've ever had.

Rating: 2
After reading all reviews, I was a little disappointed with this recipe. First of all, after reviewing some other similar recipes, chicken is to be deboned (no mention in this recipe) and it just didn't have enough flavor?? Dumplings not outstanding by any means either. I can do better. So will try again but compare some other recipes to combine efforts. Tip: buy baby carrots, why would anyone want to slice or grate carrots?

This was a perfect dinner for a cold, snowy New Year's Day. I let the chicken cook in the vegetable/broth mix for about an hour. The result was tender, delicious, falling-off-the-bone chicken in a rich broth. The dumplings were good, and not too heavy.

This is a meal that my mom has made for years. I will try the leeks in it next time I make it. A few substitutions for you: If you're on a time constraint, or you just don't want to make the dumplings, you can use canned buttermilk biscuits halved and dusted in flour. Also if you are more for the just chicken and dumpling part of it, I would suggest grating all of your veggies, it still has the flavor, but not all of the different textures.

Rating: 3
I only had 2 leeks, so I added more shallot and used a spanish onion as well. I also added 3 cloves of garlic, it did need it. I thought that there was too much carrot, but overall, the flavor was excellent. I probably wouldn't flour the chicken the next time. I think that the dumplings thickened the sauce enough on their own. Next time I'll use sugar snap peas instead of the regular peas.

I used a timer for browning since I am impatient and sometimes cut time (bad move) -browning for the proper time allows the flavors to really develop - after laughing at my timer, my husband recanted after tasting this delicious dinner! We were both surprised! The dumplings were great - they compliment the flavors of the chicken and sauce - wouldn't want them to be overbearing - we ate them all - need to make more when eating the leftovers!

This was really tasty and even better than I expected. The only thing I disliked was the cornmeal in the dumplins. It added and interesting texture, but the taste got mixed reviews. Next time I'm making regular flour dumplings.

The only change I made to this dish was to add a little white wine to simmer down before adding the rest of the liquid. The whacky addition of apple juice was a gift to this recipe. Those of you that make it without are making a mistake. I could imagine adding garlic. The flavor was great. It truly reminded me of home.

Delicious!! Made this last night and used boneless, skinless, chicken tenders. One large onion instead of leeks and shallots. 3 celery ribs, 2 bay leaves (broken), 1 t. dried thyme, 5 cups chicken broth, no apple cider and 2 t. dried dill in broth. I used a cast iron skillet to prepare and be able to scrape the bottom and when ready to put dumplings in, transferred it to a stock pot. I prepared the chicken and veg's ahead of time and refrigerated. When ready to serve, I transferred to a stock pot, brought to a boil and arranged the dumplings over the chicken mixture. Instead of making the dumplings according to the recipe, I used Bisquick and prepared according to the directions on the box. If you are preparing chicken mixture ahead of time be sure not to overcook the veg's. since the dumplings will cook for 20 minutes. This was WONDERFUL and so easy. This recipe is the best chicken and dumplings ever! Browning the chicken and sauteing the veg's make all the difference in the world compared to the normal boiling of everything. The flavors are wonderful. Will definately make it again and again and would not hesitate to serve to company. Can't imagine what the reviewer did who said it was bland. It is a wonderful layer of flavors.

I have never made this dish before and thought I would give it a try, although I had to use some substitutions. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, used regular onion instead of leeks and shallots, omitted the carrot (because I didn't have any), and used dry dill instead of fresh. Everyone enjoyed the dumplings; however we thought the dish on a whole was rather bland. I can't imagine that carrots could make that much of a difference. Maybe we just don't like chicken and dumplings?

This is a wonderful meal for a cool night. I like to add some parsnips in addition to the carrots. I have done this skinless and it is just as good. It is a complete meal in one dish and only takes about 45 min from start to finish. Leftovers are even better than the first serving. Easy and wonderful!!

Second time for this and it's unbelievably good!! Omitted carrots, decreased leeks to two (two was more than enough), sub one cup of onion for shallot (because I didn't have shallots) and subbed 4-5 boneless breasts for the chicken. One would think all of these substitutions would change the dish, but it just made it more convenient for me. Maybe increase salt and add black pepper. Do not, however, omit the apple cider. It's neccesary. Perhaps white wine would do the trick as well. Family and friends loved it and its perfect for cool autumn evenings. Contrary to another review, we had no problem with leftovers. Maybe even better. Don't pass this by!

This is really good - I don't usually like chicken with skin, but feel that in this recipe, it is an important component. Can be frozen nicely BEFORE dumplings are made. (I make a quadruple recipe and freeze it in aluminum trays, adding the dumplings when it is completely reheated and bubbling.)

This is a dish that should be consumed at one sitting, since the dumplings lose their texture and become rather nasty upon re-heating. The flavor is fairly good, but benefits from the addition of garlic, since otherwise it is a little bland.

This has become a classic in my house. We skip the leeks and shallots for plain old onions, and use lots of veggies and boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I also substitute a classic dumpling recipe; we tried the cornmeal dumplings once, and as previous posters have noted, they are somewhat heavy. I always use quality organic chicken broth in this dish; I think that makes a huge difference.

My three dinner guests and I (including Mom) thought this was delicious! It's a definite keeper. I wasn't sure about cornmeal dumplings, but I really liked them.

I made this with my husband; neither of us had ever had it, even though we both have southern mothers! Anyway, I halved the recipe and used just one big, boned chicken breast, and it was plenty.

This recipe was fast, easy, and VERY delish! Tasted like Grammy used to make. However, I didn't exactly follow the recipe to a T. I streamlined it and make it quicker and easier and made it to fit what I had in my kitchen. Here's some easy revisions...I know I didn't use as much but mine tasted fabulous. I used 5 boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite size pieces. I had no leeks or shallots on hand so I just substituted a large onion and increased the other vegetables slightly. I also had no apple cider so I just left it out. Lastly, I used a traditional dumpling recipe. I know it sounds almost too simple the way that I made it, but I think on old-fashioned comfort food, that may be the way to go.

This recipe was a big hit with my family. I substituted skinless chicken breasts, cut into chunks. I browned them in oil along with the onions and carrots, in a large skillet. In another pot, I simmered the celery and seasonings (I also added a few pinches of sage) in the broth. I made the dumplings about half the size and dropped them in the simmering broth the traditional way. When they were about done, I poured the broth and dumplings over the chicken to simmer and dislodge all the browned bits. This method was not any more time consuming, but allowed the chicken, onions and carrots to brown more deeply and slowly...resulting in more flavor. I also added more veggies as suggested by the other reviewers. I regretfully substituted parsley for the dill only because I was afaid my phobic family would reject them. Anyhow, we all loved it! Good comfort food! Oh, and I thickened the broth with a little cornstarch...another little nod to the fam.

Great, great dish! Easy, quick, and smells just so wonderful as it's cooking. The sauce is scrumptious (think leeks, thyme, bay, shallots --ummmm) and the dumplings, PERFECTO!

This recipe was good; however, it was too much like "chicken pot pie" vs. chicken and dumplings. Next time I would only add the onions and maybe add some peas. That's it - no carrots, or potatoes.

The dumplings were not light and fluffy, and the dill was overpowering. I used whole milk instead of half and half, however, so that could be responsible for the lumpy-ness of the dumplings. All other components of the recipe were easy to follow and turned out fine, if bland.

The dill in the dumplings made them a little too flavorful. I am a fan of the "down home" cooking, so next time I will add more veggies, along with an extra half cup broth, with 1/4 cup flour in the broth. It was very good, otherwise! By the way, I put 3.5 lbs of chicken in my batch, and it was waaay to much. I would aim for 2-3 lbs. Does anybody have tips for browing the chicken? It took me almost 30 mins to do so, and the oil/butter mixture was absorbed with the first batch.

Delicious!! The dumplings were light and fluffy, the chicken was tender and the sauce was wonderful. I cut the amount of chicken to 1 lb as we are a family of four (2 toddlers). I adjusted the recipe for this amount of chicken, however, I added 3 cups of leeks, 3 carrots, and a whole can of drained peas. I also used skinless chicken breasts to cut down on the fat and simmered for 1/2 hour.
