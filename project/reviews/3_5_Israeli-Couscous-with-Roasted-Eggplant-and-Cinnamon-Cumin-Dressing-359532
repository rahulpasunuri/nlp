Mixed zucchini and eggplant. Parsley instead of cilantro. Black quinoa instead of couscous. Nice presentation, subtle flavor so it's a good note to pair this with a main that isn't too overpowering.

Crispy, smokey eggplant chunks, sweet golden raisins and the cinnamon and cumion go really well with this! For a healthy recipe this one packs the flavor on! Definitely recommend. I will be making this for our next potluck!

This was easy and delicious. I did amp up the seasonings some and left out the cilantro as my husband doesn't like it. I will definitely be making this again. Especially in summer when the eggplants start coming in. In fact, I may even add some zucchini.

The taste was wonderful but following the directions precisely turned out a rather mushy eggplant. Only about half of the pieces were usable. Next time I'll cut the eggplant into larger pieces and bake a little less time to see if that helps.

We found the flavor combinations to be off and the texture was off-putting.

Delicious. Substituted barley for the couscous as I did not have Israeli couscous on hand. Served it with broiled lamb chops and broiled tomatoes. Perfect meal. Would definitely make this again.

Delicious. Used fresh dates instead of raisins.

Delicious! I didn't have red onion, so I used yellow onion, sauteed it a bit, and added some garlic. Next time, I'll peel the eggplant before roasting - it looks better with the peel on, no doubt, but the skin was a bit tough. Tasty, quick, a winner!

Quite tasty. I didn't have cumin seeds, so I toasted some ground cumin. I also roasted a squash with the eggplant. The raisins made it sweetly delicious. I added a bit of pepper sauce to my own serving. I'd make it again if I were taking it to a party or something--probably not just for dinner at home.

This is a really wonderful dish. Made it with grilled pork loin, a great combo. The recipe perfectly served 4 people. A couple of changes: I lightly sauteed the onion, and used parsley rather than cilantro. I toasted the couscous before cooking, which I always do with the Israeli variety.

I highly recommend this recipe. I doubled it and will do that again next time, as it goes fast. Served it to a crowd who all loved it. Be careful not to serve it with strongly-flavored dishes, as the subtlety of this dish could get drowned out fairly easily.

The salad was delicious - very enticing aroma. But was a lot of work for a small salad.
