The vinegar and brown sugar are way too much. ¼ cup vinegar and 50g B. sugar is the right amount. I included a sauteed celery stalk, one teaspoon of dried mustard and a dash of cayenne pepper for heat. It is important to grind whole allspice. Also the recipe was skimpy on salt. With above deviations and additions this is added to my recipe files. But.. Can I say it's my recipe?

Commercial canned tomatoes and tomato paste can vary widely in sweetness and acidity. Bear in mind when making this ketchup - go easy on the sugar and vinegar. You can always add more if needed, but you can't take it out once it's mixed in!

Very different kind of ketchup.. I did everything exactly as written and everyone thought it was pretty interesting. I had typical Heinz ketchup as an option as well, and more of my friends reached for the stuff I made. My friends like branching out, though. Overall, I having control of what goes in my condiments, so I will continue to make it.. just maybe with less sugar.

Ugh, this isn't ketchup. This is tomato sauce.

I followed the recipe exactly. As others said it is a little too sweet. I would definately cut down on the sugar next time. I'm not sure it tastes like ketchup but it is tasty, sort of like BBQ sauce.

I made this with aging fresh tomatoes, instead of canned. Also did not have cider vinegar, so used rice vinegar instead. I also blended the onions and garlic in with the tomatoes, and skipped the blending at the end, which gave it a little chunkier texture (more home-grown!).It was marvelous--and I'm not a ketchup lover, either. Next time I will put in a bit less sugar, and perhaps some red chili flakes to spice it up a little, but it was terrific just as it was.

We use lots of organic ketchup when we make our shrimp cocktail sauce, so I had to try this recipe. While it doesn't look bright red like the store-bought version, it's a delicious ketchup loaded with flavor notes, almost verging on a barbecue sauce. I allowed it to chill overnight before tasting just now on a spoon and know this will be a favorite. Cost-effective, too, and surprisingly easy to put together while multi-tasking.

Really good! I'm not a ketchup fan, but this was delicious. I served it with mini turkey loaves at a dinner party, and all my guests loved it as much as I did!

Well, this is less sugar than would be in comparable commercial ketchup so if you think that is way too sweet you could reduce it by up to half.

Just a question: This seems like a heck of a lot of sugar; do you think I could reduce it and if so, by how much?
