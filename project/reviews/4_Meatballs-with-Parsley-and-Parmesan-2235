I found this recipe in the Epi cookbook I received for Christmas. I subbed ground turkey for the ground beef and that was the only change I made. The meatballs were delicious. They were so tender. Definitely a keeper!

I actually left the parsley out and added italian herb mix and dry chili pepper. I also cooked in the oven for 10 minutes instead of frying

Either I royally screwed this up, or my personal palette differs significantly from those of the other reviewers. this wasn't bad, but it wasn't mind blowingly delicious either. i followed the recipe for the most part but took some of the other reviewers' suggestions and baked rather than pan fried the meatballs. i felt like they were a bit dry, and wasn't crazy about the consistency. husband said it was alright, but if i were to do it again, i might go for the pan-fry, and would definitely add more seasonings such as crushed red pepper and basil. i just didn't feel like these were flavorful enough. but hey--there's no accounting for taste!

I come from a long line of Italian cooks, and this is the best meatball recipe ever! Thought I would have some leftovers after a dinner party for 8 - NOT! Had some day-old focaccia (lots of rosemary on top) and grated it on a box grater for the crumbs. Delish!

I added some thyme and oregano for flavor and extra breadcrumbs for texture, and used no oil - still plenty moist and delicious!

These meatballs are so good. I've been making them for years. They are great as-is but I have adjusted the recipe just to make it easier for myself. I use Progresso Italian bread crumbs and instead of the parsley I just eyeball some Italian seasoning. Oh and DEFINITELY do not use lean beef but 80% lean which gives is so much more flavor. My family loves when I make these!

Yum! I prepared a double batch for a New Years weekend gathering. The only modification was that I used a mixture of beef and pork (3:1) and baked in the oven instead of frying. The cooked meatballs have been simmering on low in the slow cooker in a homemade tomato and herb sauce. Our guests are so lucky to enjoy these meatball sliders on soft bakery rolls.

Rating: 3
These are pretty good. They've got a really great flavor, but I think the texture's a little too much like meatloaf for my liking. They were a big hit at my dinner (served in a white wine tomato sauce as an hors d'ouvre), and I will probably make them again but tweak them to get a meatier texture.

Three forks for delicious. Since I only had a # of beef, I halved the recipe and followed NebraskaCook's advice to add 2 T of thyme & bake them. I crave them all the time now, so I keep them in the freezer and pop them out when I want them.

I made 1 1/2 times the recipe - because I had a massive amount of ground beef. 3lbs of 80/20 (not lean) beef, plus the contents of one hot italian sausage. The full amount of parsley plus a bit of basil, oregano and thyme from my garden. Panko bread crumbs. No oil or mayo - because it wasn't lean beef. The consistency was fine without this. Everything else as per the recipe. I baked them as I usually do with meatballs. They were lovely in meatball subs with a simple homemade (20 min) tomato sauce and we froze about 1/2. My family wouldn't eat these without sauce - but they were great in the subs.

Rating: 4
Use 1 lb. venison and 1 lb. meatloaf mix, a blend of oregano, parsely, and basil from the garden, and the mayo as others have suggested. Needed more bread crumbs - used whole wheat panko (its what i had.) cooked at 450, then 350 as someone suggested. Awesome! Ate with a simple tomato sauce. Couldn't have been yummier

Really good! Kind of came apart when cooking on the skillet though. Any tips for that?

I made this for an Italian soup recipe on here, using ground turkey instead of beef. The meatballs are wonderful, very easy to come together. You can throw everything into a Kitchenaid stand mixer and bam, meatballs. I think I'll use this recipe in the future instead of the one I'd been relying on.

Rating: 4
This is a new family favorite. I've made them half a dozen times now, using the hint of baking rather than frying. And I use just lean ground turkey. My family tends to balk if I try to trim down a recipe's fat content, but the ground turkey tastes really great here!

This recipe makes a very moist, flavorful meatball. After making it several times, these are the changes I make most often: halve the entire recipe and use only 1 lb lean ground beef; substitute 1-2T fresh finely chopped thyme for the parsley; add 3T finely minced onions; omit the oil; and bake in the oven at 350 for 30-40 minutes, turning once and coating the bottom of the baking dish with a bit of the omitted oil. The result is a smaller portion (I live alone, so 1 lb of meat is enough for dinner for me and my boyfriend with leftovers), a leaner dish, and a great unexpected flavor with the thyme.

Rating: 4
I made this recipe, but was short on 2 lbs burger so I made it with 1.5 pounds and upped my bread crumbs to 1 cup. I used panko breadcrumbs, not fresh. That was the only thing I changed. I thought they were a bit salty will reduce salt next time, but overall they were delicious and definately not dry and everyone loved them. We thought they were very flavorful. Would recommend this recipe to friends.

Oh and to those who had problems with salt, saying there is to much, it's probably because of your cheese. Use very a good parmesan cheese and you won't have this problem.

Rating: 4
These were fantastic. I added a shallot and some crushed red pepper. I also used both parsley and basil. For the meat I used 1/3 ground beef, 1/3 ground pork and 1/3 veal. I cooked some in the oven as others suggested and some in a frying pan. I found the oven roasted ones a bit dryer then the pan fried. Actually what I ended up doing with my last batch, which were my favorite, was cook them in a pan on med-high turning often until they had a nice crust, then I transferred them to a pan on med-low to finish.

* Use a meatloaf mix of equal parts ground beef, ground pork, ground veal. * Add 1 small minced onion. * Use 3T mayo instead of oil. * Bake on parchment paper at 450F for 10 min, then 350 for 15min. You will get a lot of cheese leakage, just wipe it off the meatballs. Or fry them lightly beforehand then bake.

Loved this recipe! I prefer Italian bread for Italian meatballs...makes 24 if you prefer a good size meatball. Baking for 1/2 hr.@ 350 reduces grease by a lot! This is now my staple!

I made these today and am so pleased. I made a few modifications to the original, but it was pretty close. Rather than all beef, I did 50/50 beef and pork. As suggested for moisture, I used mayo instead of oil and also put in half of a chopped vidalia. I upped the amount of garlic to four cloves and omitted the salt completely. I baked these in the oven at 400 for 25 minutes and am freezing half of the batch and putting the others with spaghetti this evening. I will definitely make these again.

These meatballs are great and the recipe is perfect as written. How anyone can say they are bland is a mystery to me. I've made them several times, both fried and baked and they've always been delicious. The only change I make is to use a mix of beef, pork & veal.

Easily a four-forker! I've made these countless times - and each time had fun in modifying the recipe a bit. The recipe itself was already good, but for those afraid their meatballs would become dry can soak the breadcrumbs in milk for around 10 mins. As with IKEA's meatballs, I fried some diced shallots in butter to add to the taste. It turned out excellent!

Rating: 4
Wonderful... I added an onion and some celery and substituted the meat with 1 pound 93% lean beef and 1 pound ground turkey. I was worried that they might come out too dry, but after 20 minutes at 375 in the oven my smaller sized meatballs came out great. I tossed them into my marinara sauce. yummy

EXCELLENT!!!! I have to say, I am one of the pickiest cooks. This recipe is really excellent. It is easy and guest worthy. I made the following modifications: 2.5lb meat, 1/2 ground 15% fat tukey and 1/2 ground meatloaf mix (beef, pork, veal) 3/4 cup Italian bread crumbs, 3T mayo instead of oil, few leaves chopped fresh basil and few shakes dried oregano and ground cayenne pepper, one small diced onion. Other ingredients unchanged. I baked the meatballs for 30 min at 400F on parchment paper. This was ever so slightly salty, so I'd decrease salt to 1.5t salt. These were delicious with Rao's marinara sauce, if you don't want to make your own!!! I really haver never had meatballs this "fluffy" and delicious. Just great.

Excellent recipe. This was the first time I made meatballs, recipe was easy. Boyfriend asked for recipe and got the approval of picky eater types.

This is the best meatball recipe I have ever made and I won't try another. Thanks to previous reviewers, I used a total of 3# meat (1/2 meatloaf mix, 1/2 beef), and so I did increase the other ingredients by 1/2 as well. I baked in the oven, then simmered in my favorite tomato sauce. They are so light and delicious. I made them one other time with 1# sweet italian sausage, 1# meatloaf mix and 1# ground beef, which is my preferred take on the recipe, but my kids don't like the sausage. Either way, they are perfect.

I've made this recipe as written with great results and also with these additions: I use 1/2lb plain ground pork per lb of ground beef and some finely chopped onion. I think we like the softer texture the onions and pork give the meatballs. I also bake them on a silpat. Great recipe!

I made this with two lbs. of lean ground turkey and used 1 cup of breadcrumbs to firm up the meat a little more. I split the meat in half and tried two methods of cooking the meatballs: Sauteeing (you need to be a bit more gentle so they don't fall apart) and baking (easier and uses less fat, but takes longer). Both produced excellent flavor and the family loved them.

Rating: 4
Absolutely addictive, with the following minor changes: I used 1 lb. sweet italian sausage, 1 lb. veal and 1 lb. of organic ground beef and increased the other ingredients by 1/2 to adjust for the extra pound of meat. As per several kind previous reviewers, I also added 4 1/2 T. of mayo, 1 t. of crushed red pepper and 1 small minced yellow onion, and I baked them on parchment paper at 400 degrees for about 40 minutes, turning once during cooking. (Make sure to use parchment and not aluminum foil, which sticks.) Excellent suggestions - many thanks! It seemed like a huge portion until I could not stop eating these last night! I simmered them today in homemade marinara and then broiled them with provolone and mozzarella on crusty demi baguettes for the best meatball sandwiches ever (perfect football fare). I can't imagine what could compel me to make another meatball recipe.

Based on reviews, I thought this would be a big hit with my 2 and 4 year old sons. They ate it and liked it, but I was disappointed. I added mayo, reduced salt, and baked per suggestions. They were too firm and the cheese/mayo sort of oozed out. Next time, I think I'll try chilling mixture for a few hours before baking.

These meatballs were a real hit with the family. I liked that fact that I can make them ahead to have for soccer and hockey nights. I used 1lb ground beef and 1lb ground veal otherwise stuck to the recipe. I found these salty. Next time I would cut the salt by 1/2. I also did 1/2 in the frypan and 1/2 in the oven. Would consider the oven next time to eliminate the extra fat content, although I never worry about using good quality olive oil. I thought 44 meatballs seemed like alot, but they just disappeared!!! Can't wait to make a bigger batch next time.

Incredibly Moist ! made a half cup mixture of store bread crumbs and panko, and used the suggestion of mayonaise rather than oil. Definately am not going to add the salt when I make this again, and also baked it on 400 degrees for 30 minutes. Delicious! They were supposed to made for my little brother's graduation the following day but my boyfriend and I made excuses for why we had to eat them ... ie. wouldn't fit in the dish we were using, that one seems a bit mis-shapen ... :) we ended up having to make a-whole-nother half a batch.

Fabulous meatballs! We were going through an insanely busy time in our lives, and when I first tried this recipe, I needed something that I could freeze and dole out in single portions for my 12-month-old. They were--and still are--a huge hit! They are so moist and so good, I have to keep myself away from them or I end up "popping" them like candy. I make the recipe almost exactly as written, except I use regular unseasoned breadcrumbs (not fresh) and use fresh parsley only if I have it on hand. Following other reviewers' suggestions, I bake them in a 400-degree oven for 30 minutes, and they are awesome! My toddler still loves them, but now I make them for the whole family--hubbie gobbles 'em up too!

YUMMY! I used a couple heaping tablespoons of mayo, Hellmans of course, and some red pepper flakes, baked them in a 350 oven for about 30 minutes and they were crispy, savory and moist.

This is an outstanding recipe for meatballs. The first time I made this I follow the ingredients list exactly and cooked as specified. The next time, instead of frying them and then adding the meatballs with the fat to the sauce, I baked them in the oven on a wire rack for 20 minutes and then added them to the sauce. They still tasted delicious but with a lot less fat.

Great recipe! I also added mayo (in lieu of olive oil) and red pepper flakes (I would put in about 1.5 tsp next time for more bite). I used store-bought bread crumbs, and they're just fine - but you need more than 1/2 cup. I browned the meatballs under the broiler in 2 batches turning once. Then I finished the cooking by simmering in a caramelized onion sauce with 1 can each of crushed and whole tomatoes, basil and a dash of soy sauce. I was able to get 3 meals (for 2) out of this recipe!

Really easy and extremely delicious! As recommended, I added a little mayo and red pepper flakes, also didn't put in as much oil. Put in italian spice mix instead of parsley. Mixed 2/3 beef with 1/3 pork. Baking it only took about 25 minutes at 400. Then I scaped the cheese/fat off the bottom of the pan and added it to sauce. I served them at a new years party in China. Everyone raved, but I shoudl mention that they probably would have raved about any Western food served, since it is such a treat. Will definitely make again.

great basic recipe. we like a little zing so i add a couple of finely chopped serranos and also use the seasoned breadcrumbs like Progresso. the only other difference, and i don't understand why most recipes go the fry route, is to bake the meatballs in the oven at 350+ for 45 min depending on size. they brown up great and the fat's left in the pan.

Very good! I added carrots, mayo, and onion as others suggested, and used a mix of veal, pork, and beef. I used whole grain bread crumbs, too. They were so quick with the food processor.

Drop them in sauce or on a sheet for baking right from the freezer.

Far and away the best meatballs I have ever had or made!! I normally use the recipe from the Cooks Illustrated cookbook - this is a very good recipe, however, this one here on Epicurious is even better. I did follow several suggestions from reviewers: I added 3 T mayo, red pepper flakes and one small onion. Also I used meatloaf mix (beef, veal and pork). And I used a combo of parm and romano cheese and I added more garlic than what was called for. I baked most of the meatballs, although I did pan fry a few so that I would have the brown bits for my sauce. I made my own breadcrumbs (Italian bread sliced, toasted, put into cuisinart with olive oil, parm cheese, salt, pepper, fresh thyme and fresh parsley -- pulsed until crumby). Also I made my own sauce (plum tomatoes, onions, garlic, thyme, parsley, olive oil, salt and pepper -- roasted for about 45 minutes in a 450 oven---- then pureed in the cuisinart with sugar and fresh basil --- then I add a little of this to the pan the meatballs were fried in to get the bits up, then put it all in a large stock pan and add all of the meatballs.) I too had the issue of the cheese melting out of the meatballs when baked in the oven, however, this is an advantage because all of that liquidy cheese is wonderful to add to the sauce - it is a true enhancement - just put it all in and simmer. I rarely am this enthusiastic about a recipe, but these meatballs are so good, particularly with the additions other reviewers suggested, that I just had to rave.

I made this last weekend as a dry run for xmas eve. The meatballs were very good, although I am going to add some minced onion and maybe some additional cheese.

Very satisfying dish, especially with homemade tomato sauce and ladled generously over angel hair pasta. I tried both baking and frying; the baked ones tasted better than the fried ones.

In the interests of time (we wanted something to eat quickly), as well as good old-fashioned curiosity, we prepared the meatballs three ways: pan-fried, in the sauce, and baked in the oven at 400 degrees for 35 minutes. They were all about 2 inches in diameter. Taste-wise, the baked meatballs came out best. They would probably have won appearance-wise as well, if I had bothered to turn them so they wouldn't come out flat on one side. The third thing about the baked meatballs was that the cheese melted right out of them into a pool of oil on the pan. Thank goodness I used foil. Regarding the recipe itself, I followed the instructions precisely, except for the 3 tbps of mayo that another reviewer suggested. That reviewer was right - it did keep the meatballs moist. But there was still something missing. I think an addition of red pepper flakes and minced onion would take it all the way.

Love these! Baking them is easier but I fry them because I then cook sausage in the same pan and then make the spaghetti sauce in the same pan. All those little bits add lots of flavor. Leftovers are used the next day at lunch...meatball sandwiches with jalapenos and a cold beer!

This recipe was so-so. I baked the meatballs instead of frying. As a result, they were a bit dry. Next time I might add some mayo (another recipe I usually use for baked meatballs calls for 3 tblsp of mayo and the meatballs were delicious). I also added some red pepper flakes to give these meatballs some zing.

The only change I made was adding an extra garlic clove...who doesn't do that? These really are great meatballs. I think next time I may make them in a sauce or bake them as frying takes a while and it's messy. This is my first time out making meatballs and my husband thought they were as good as the family italian place down the street that he loves. Might be nice to add fresh basil and oregano as well next time.

I recently made these for my family, I followed the recipe except I added half a small minced onion. I think next time, I may either add the whole onion or an additional clove of garlic. I think it is a great meatball recipe - the meatballs come out nice and tender and flavorful.

I agree that this was a very good, very easy and versatile recipe. I followed the recipe to the letter and served them with spaghetti which was very good. Next time I will add some more garlic and crushed red pepper to give them a little more kick. I also tried dipping them in BBQ sauce which was also very tasty.

I loved this recipe so much I will make it again and again. I substituted minced chicken for ground beef and used regular breadcrumbs and it was extremelt delicious. I also halved the recipe since I live alone and it turned out beautifully.

I halfed this recipe but that was a mistake, I should have doubled it. It was great. I served it with a side of spicy rice.

This has become a new staple in our freezer - a great start to a weeknight meal. Just add sauce!

This is a keeper! I made these meatballs for supper tonight and they are so good. I cut the recipe in half as there are only two of us (and we can't eat 44 meatballs!!). Turned out very delicous. I made these with venison as that is what we have...added Classico Tomato & Basil sauce and had a very good meal with not much fuss. I recommend these highly.

I used Progresso flavored bread crumbs, a little more than half a cup, and next time, I would add even more. I took the advice of making about a dozen large meatballs and baking them at 400 degrees for 45 minutes rather than frying them. Excellent! My husband, who does not regularly like meatballs, loved them!

My boyfroend and I loved these meatballs. We made around 12-15 large meatballs instead and simmered it in our sauce and then the next day crumbled some up and made crumbled meatball sandwiches. I wasn't sure where I could find fresh bread crumbs so I just toasted some french rolls and then put them through the food processor.

VEGETARIAN VERSION: I substituted 6 cups of Harvest Burger Recipe Crumbles (soy protein) for the meat, and added an extra egg for cohesion. I baked the meatballs at 375 for 30 minutes turning once. Each "meatball" has 34 cal., 1.6g fat, 1.76g carbohydrate, and 3g of protein. Delicious and very healthy!!! Great in spicy marinara sauce!

This recipe was so good that my childeren even ate it and they don't like anything (1 year old and 3 year old)!! Instead of frying I put it in the oven on 400 degress for about 45 minutes and they turned out great. Make sure you turn them or they will have one side flat (I did this once, looked funny but still tasted GREAT!) Would positively make again!

Excellent meatballs. I decreased the parm. chz by 1 tsp. and oil. Excellent the next day in a sandwich.

Nice and moist. However I used my crock pot for cooking. Browned the meatballs first then added to my crock pot on low and cooked for 3 or so hours. Then I added brown gravy on top. Very delectable--for meatballs. Everyone asked for the recipe. I also used 1lb. ground beef and 1lb. ground turkey. Not sure I would use 2lb. turkey.

I made this recipe with 2/3 lean, trimmed venison and 1/3 pork, ground together. I used an extra 1/2 pound of meat in the recipe and I baked them at 350. The time depended on the size of the meatball. Really excellent stuff. I think I would add more spice next time - maybe more pepper and a pesto cube. I multiplied the recipe by 3 and it came out just great. The freezer is full! Now I can use the fresh venison for roasts.

I have made these meatballs twice now both times using turkey instead of the beef. The good thing about this recipe is that you can use them in a marinara with spagetti over the weekend and again during the week for the meatball subs. I will try baking next time instead of frying as suggested by some of the others. Good stuff and easy to make. :)

I loved these meatballs! I would use a little less salt because the parmesan adds a lot of flavor. Definitely bake them!

THESE MEATBALLS WERE EASY TO THROW TOGETHER AND DELICIOUS. AS WITH SOME OF THE OTHER REVIEWERS, I ALSO BAKED THEM AND THEM SERVED THEM WITH A TOMATO BASED SAUCE. WILL DEFINATELY MAKE AGAIN.

I baked the meatballs on parchment paper for 20 minutes at 325F for 20 minutes then warmed them up in Classico tomato and basil pasta sauce. My husband can't wait to make a sandwich out of them. I loved avoiding the mess of frying. Also I used half ground beef, one-quarter pork and one-quarter turkey. I will try egg substitute next time.

I made these meatballs and then covered them with Bullseye Origional Bar-B-Que sauce and then baked them. You can use any flavour of sauce and then serve with rice. Excellent!

The recipe was delicious, but instead of frying the meatballs try baking them.
