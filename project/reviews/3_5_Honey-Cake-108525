This recipe was fantastic. For someone who is usually a great failure with cakes, and isn't usually a fan on honey cake I have to say that I thought this turned out to be phenomenal. I usually leave out the whiskey because I don't normally have it on hand, and either way it comes out okay. I also add a pinch of clove and pinch of cardimon - but that's just me.

This was the best honey cake I have ever eaten! It was moist, tasty, and not too sweet ! I brought it to friends in New York who said they were going to give away all the other honey cake they had for the holidays because it was SO MUCH better ! i would definitely make it again. Make sure to wrap it in well sealed plastic wrap after it has cooled. It gets even more moist the second day.

FANTASTIC!

spent 3 hours making this and, well, it sure looks like cake! tastes just a tad burnt, with notes of ginger, tar and stable aroma ...if that makes sense (nope). my friend told me it tastes like cigarettes. I think the buckwheat honey was probably a bit too funky...

I am unsure why my first attempt at this recipe yielded a cake that tasted more like coffee and oil than honey! :-( I followed the recipe exactly as written, except I left out the alcohol. Center of cake fell, probably because I took it out of the oven briefly to cover it. I'll look for another recipe.

I just baked this recipe for honey cake this a.m. I followed the directions and ingredients explicitely and was disappointed to find that the center of the cake sunk. Not happy with the results and the appearance. Taste is yet to be determined.

Great recipe. I used Turbinado sugar and whole wheat pastry flour and it came out great. Big hit for Mother's Day.

Beautiful texture and taste. I added rum and apricot brandy for the spirit. I also added a little sugarless apricot preserves. Yummy

Cook from Mtl, Canada asks how to make pareve. There are many non-dairy oils to use, some in sticks (esp at health Food stores). I've heard of applesauce replacing butter! There are pareve sour cream imitations and various liquid non-dairy coffee creamers to use. I never had a milchig honey cake.

I just made this cake and added about 3/4 of a cup of walnuts to it. It has a delicious flavor and an acceptable level of moistness but is slightly dry. Remember that this cake increases in moistness after a day or two, wrapped in plastic. My grandmother often made honey cake, and I well remember how moist it was the second day, or even a week later.

I was a little concerned when I read the other reviews, but I still made a double portion. My family and I really enjoyed the recipe. It really tasted of honey, the cake did not overflow, but I tented with foil as was suggested, and I took it out a little early so the middle fell a little bit. The cake came out moist and delicious. I will be making it for all Tishrei.

I really didn't like this. I haven't had much honey cake, so I'm not the most expert, but this was drier and less flavorful than I'd hoped.

from reading the reviews my fear that it would run over the rim occured, i wish i knew why it does that. anyways i tried the other honeycake recipe on the regular epicurious search, only one problem it's made with butter and sour cream so its not pareve does anyone know how to replace those two ingredients so i can serve it at mealtime without worrying about it being dairy. ps the dairy version is heavenly

I thought this was a very good honey cake recipe for Rosh Hashanah and I will definitely make it again. I have tried several honey cake recipes over the years, and this one comes closest to the ones I remembered from my childhood - moist, slightly sweet, but flavorful. My batter also overran the pan, so I recommend putting a rimmed baking sheet underneath it while cooking. Also, I was worried it would not be sweet enough, so I used 1/3 cup of brown sugar, not 1/4 cup. It turned out a little too sweet, so I recommend sticking to the original measurements. Also, try allspice instead of ginger!

I made this following the directions to the letter and the center fall. Was okay to serve upside-down so that one did not know. Was a vey good thing that it was not for company or to be taken somewhere as their dessert. Would have been most imbarassing and ruin my reputation as a good baker. Flavor was very good and it was not a heavy cake a many honey cakes are. I may give it another try.

I thought it was very good. I used my home-made espresso (extra strong) and was pleased with the dark color of the final product. I liked the flavor of the scotch wiskey. It was lovely with tea at the end of a fine Rosh Hashanah dinner. I will try a bit of fresh lemon and zest next time, and expect that it will be that much better

I've made many honey cakes over the years and this is the best so far, but that's damning with faint praise. Traditional honey cake is 'bready', real peasant food imo. That's why I give this 3 forks and not four. That said, this one came out moist, not too heavy, and with good flavor. I'd added one T of fresh lemon juice just to brighten the flavors a bit. Do follow the instructions and make it a day or three ahead of time, it does indeed become more moist and flavorful.

I agree. This cake wasnt nearly sweet enough and even though i'm good in the kitchen and followed the recipe very closely, mine turned out more like honey brick than honey cake. I cant even begin to try and edit the recipe to figure out where it went wrong.

This was a great honey cake. Be careful not to over cook though. I'd even suggest taking out a few minutes earlier or it may be a bit dry than some like. I used brandy instead of whiskey which was great. The flavor was a little too strong for my husband so I added on 1 tablespoon the next time with a milder but still nice flavor.

Did we all make the same cake? This cake was moist, sweet - but not cloying - and just got better from day to day. I also had to bake it longer than the recipe specified and it overflowed my 9x5 glass loaf pan. I couldn't get buckwheat honey, so I used mixed honey (clover honey would definitely be too light). I also used bourbon, not whiskey; it has a smokier flavor.

This was a perfectly fine cake, but nothing spectacular. It had a nice rich color and the honey flavor was not overpowering, but I didn't find it moist enough. Also, I wasn't crazy about the ginger.

Admittedly, I've never made a honey cake before. I don't think I've eaten one either. But I made this for Rosh Hashana and was very disappointed. None of my guests enjoyed it much. I made it three days ahead as the recipe suggested that the cake would become more flavorful and moist with time, but it was very dry and not nearly sweet enough. It had a distinctly "spicy" flavor, but overall was not very appealing.

To my taste, it is not sweet enough. I would have liked a more powerful honey taste, and a sweeter cake. Also, I had to bake it half again as long as the recipe called for as it remained loose. This may have been my fault, but I believe I followed the recipe closely? I'll try another recipe next time. Moistness was certainly not a problem.
