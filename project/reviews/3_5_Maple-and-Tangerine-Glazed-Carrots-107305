So good! I use molasses and brown sugar instead of maple syrup and add more cayenne pepper - love it.

I have made this recipe now for two years and it holds up well over time. It is a good Thanksgiving recipe. It's healthy and sweet. It also makes for good presentation.

We made this recipe for Thanksgiving two years ago and it received rave reviews from everyone, including those not a big fan of cooked carrots. We continue to make it!

Very good recipe, I did cook sauce a little longer to thicken it. My daughter who does not like cooked carrots - loved these and asked for seconds.

I made these carrots for Thanksgiving and they were a big hit. It took a quite a bit longer to get the liquid to thicken to a velvety glaze than the recipe said. But, it was worth the extra time.

Following the other comments listed, I made sure to let the juice cook down as much as possible to get a "thickish" coating. This is important to do prior to cooking w/carrots! I also used baby carrots in the interest of saving time, I blanched and then gave them an ice bath to keep them from becoming mush. My family is used to a similar recipe that uses beef broth & honey, but this was a good dish to experiment with. The ones that liked the dish, loved it, the ones that didn't hated it.

A great switch from the Old carrots for dinner. The glaze I cooked alittle longer to get thick. The flavors were slightly sweet and unique. All the family wanted the recipe.

Made it for Thanksgiving, the whole family adored it. Love the combination of sweet citrus and carrots. Also added a little orange juice when we ran out of tangerines, works well.

Delicious and easy to make. Thanks to other reviewers' comments I simmered the glaze until it clearly began to thicken before adding carrots. It turned out perfect - no juice left in pan.

I, too, did not get a glaze. Still, the flavor was so good that I gave it 3 forks. We used less maple syrup for fear of it getting to sweet. The tangerine jiuce was sweet enough. We will make this one again some day. It was great for Christmas dinner as a side to the roasted rack of venison with dried cranberries.

I am so glad to read that others had issues with the supposed "glaze". What I was left with was a lot of juice at the bottom. It never thickened the way I thought so I gave up trying. I still rate it a 2 because I loved the flavor of the tangerine with the carrots and because my guests didn't complain, it just wasn't what I expected from the recipe. Very disappointing.

These carrots were delicious! We served them with our Thanksgiving turkey and the citrus glaze was really nice with our apple cider basted turkey. Easy, too!

Thanksgiving- great side dish, I made it the day ahead, only needed to re-heat.

Didn't care for the addition of the tangerine and, as with other reviewer, didn't really glaze up enough.

For the amount of effort to squeeze tangerines for the juice, it really did not add any additional flavor. I think I could have used orange juice and it would have been the same. On the otherhand, I may have done something wrong because no matter how long I allowed the liquid to simmer and reduce it never became "velvety".

Very fresh and tasty. They got lots od rave reviews. Try to buy carrots from a Farmers Market for the very best flavor. The difference over supermarket produce is amazing.

This dish was just okay. The glaze wasn't thick enough to suit my taste and the adults at the table found it to be a little too sweet.

Simple and delicious. A perfect combination for Thanksgiving dinner. My most favorite carrot dish ever.

These carrots were a HUGE hit. Everyone loved them. It was nice to be able to make them the night before and just warm them and finish them before the meal. I'm going to make them again for Christmas.

My guests liked the flavors of the carrots. And it was an easy dish to make.

Big hit for a vegetable dish on Thanksgiving. I agree with previous reviwer. DO NOT overcook/steam the carrots. The sauce needs to reduce more and you risk making baby food . I reduced the sauce further, THEN added the carrots. Still worked great.

I always taste test recipes before Thanksgiving so there will be no surprises, and this was a big hit!!The flavours were not too strong , so there will be no clashing with other recipes at the table. Yum!
