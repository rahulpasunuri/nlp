Great recipe! Two ideas: --I would increase the amount of squid--- it was a bit heavy on the rice. I might even alter the recipe by adding in some shrimp and mussels, and put them in at the end so they're not dyed by the squid ink. --I would save some parsley from the picada to use as a garnish, and perhaps also garnish the rice with something else colorful such as a diced tomatoes or red pepper.

Sorry for the double review, just realized I didn't sign in. I made this over the weekend and have to say this is the best Arroz Nero I've ever had. We were just in Spain for two weeks and had a few while there, but both hubby and I agree this one is better. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have fish stock so substituted with chicken and I added a few packets of store bought squid inks to make the color darker. I think people who has never made or had this shouldn't just jump to conclusions on how it looks or must taste disgusting, and even if you do, please keep it to yourself, thank you.

Just chiming back in to say that I made this the other day following the recipe as is and it was hands down the best Black Rice I have ever had! And I've eaten lots, as it is one of my favorite dishes to order in restaurants. Definitely, put your prejudices aside, do yourself a huge favor and make this!!

It really breaks my heart to see all the close-minded comments regarding this recipe. Whenever I'm on the coast of Italy or Croatia I always order the black cuttlefish/squid risotto whenever I can get it, and the Arroz Negro here which I was able to have on a resent trip to Spain was equally as fantastic. Squid and cuttlefish ink tastes mostly salty and briny and just a bit fishy--it's like the pure essence of the ocean. It does not have overpowering strange flavors which anyone that really likes seafood would off-putting. I haven't tried this yet (I was just reading reviews in order to find the best recipe for my first attempt at making this dish at home), but it looks good and I think that anyone that is an adventurous cook that loves Mediterranean cuisine must absolutely prepare and try this. When executed properly, it's absolutely heavenly. And anyone that feels like criticizing the food styling, don't bother. That's exactly what the dish is supposed to look like (well, at least this version; some are made in a more paella-like fashion where you don't stir the rice). Yes, it's black, and there isn't a lot of other black food aside from caviar and blackberries. So what? Get over it, man up, and try something new.

I'm as cosmopolitian as the next person, but this would be a really hard sell. It may be a normal menu item in Barcelona, but most of us couldn't get anyone to eat this at gunpoint. It looks just awful.

Arroz Negro is one of the greatest dishes I have ever had. The black color is novel, but no moreso than caviar. The taste of the squid ink on the rice with the squid is one of the most wonderful flavors ever. I've had it with squid, cuttlefish, mussels, etc. Much like a seafood paella. Had it in Barcelona, and it was truly the most memorable meal of a great culinary trip. If you want gross and inedible, try les Tripes de Caen. And I love all things French except French pop music and tripes (degeulasse!!), so that's gotta be bad!

Every New Years Eve my wife and I make diner for the family (30 to 35 people) The entire diner is fish and seafood. One of the dishes we make is very similar to the black calamari. We use onion, sweet and hot peppers, and tomato paste for our sofrito, and a parsley, basil, and thyme pesto. I have no idea what picada is? We also use aboreal rice. This dish is a hit at every New Years diner. My kids, and grand kids love it. We never use all the ink, and with the left over ink we make linguini with mussels, and scungilli.

This looks and sounds very interesting. I think a white garnish would help this esthetically though, maybe enoki mushrooms or daikon radish - kind of a white/black thing.

I alway thought food was supposed to be visually appealing? Disgusting.

I would not, for a moment, consider making this dish. It sounds, and looks, disgusting.

Actually, that is exactly what Black Rice should look like and it is delicious. One of my favorite dishes. The ink is a VERY mild flavor and gives it a creamy taste. This recipe is pretty much exactly like the one I have always used and it turns out wonderfully. A good homemade aiolli is a must. Don´t let cultural food prejudices stop you from trying it.

I think the food stylist needs to be fired for the photo alone. Who would eat soemthing that looked like this?

You know, I'm usually willing to try lots of different foods and I love calamari, but this recipe not only sounds awful but it does not even look appetizing. I'd love to read reviews from someone who actually made this.
