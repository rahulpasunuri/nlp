This tasted like salad

We really liked this. The only change I made was to double the amount of Dijon, since I found that 1/4 teaspoon wasn't enough to fully emusify the dressing. It was a wonderful cool complement to barbecued country style ribs.

My husband hasn't ever really liked vinaigrettes -- his idea of the perfect salad is iceberg wedges smothered in bottled blue cheese dressing. He ate every bite of this and asked for seconds. We both loved it and I will be making it again and again. I cut the lettuce into regular salad-sized pieces instead of ribbons, which I think is easier to manage anyway, and sprinkled his portion with crumbled blue cheese. A hit!

This salad was a total let down. Too tart, the lemon and mustard. Something was terribly missing in the flavor of this dressing - flavor! The lettuces a great combo, just needs something!
