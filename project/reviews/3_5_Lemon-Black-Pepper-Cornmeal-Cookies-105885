Increased the black pepper just a bit and added to the top of a few cookies. The taste is memorable because the cookie is neither sweet or ordinary. Thank you for advising OK to drop instead of chill. I was in a hurry. Watch cookies carefully when baking - mine needed only 8-9 minutes but were burnt by 10.

I'm not sure what I did wrong here, but the dough is too crumbly to use. I chilled it and it isn't any better. Total waste of ingredients.

This is a nice crunchy lemon cookie. Like many other commenters I didn't chill the dough, I just made it into little balls and flattened them with the bottom of a glass. The chill-and-slice method might have given crispier results. The flavor is mild, lemony and sweet. I'll never turn down a lemon dessert, but these cookies would be more up-to-date with less sugar and more spices.

a couple disclaimers: 2 forks seems quite low to me but actually means 'good.' and I am in Europe and converting to the metric system, also without an egg beater, so my measurements may have been off a little, but I am with the person who said the recipe only yielded half. My measurements weren't THAT off. I added a little egg, a tiny bit of milk and some flour. I also added quite a bit more lemon and pepper and would suggest it, it gave them a lot of flavor, which I quite liked.

Made for a spring time luncheon, needed something less rich & gooey, these disappeared! Made a batch as described, great as written but also made one batch with fresh ground green pepper corns, one with pink pepper corns (which are not really pepper, but what the heck) sprinkled them on the top instead of in the batter. Pink & Green on the yellow cookie looked quite festive, the warmth was delightful. A very grown-up cookie.

This is my new favorite cookie! I can`t imagine why anyone would want to tweak this recipe! No need to add extra pepper as others have done. You would have a pepper cookie! It is the perfect amount of heat to give it an interesting warmth. The slight crunchiness of the cornmeal is great too! I didn`t refrigerate the dough, just used a cookie scoop, flattened them slightly and baked them for exactly 8 mins., until lightly browned around the edges. Wonderful!

Hands down my favorite new cookie. I absolutely love the pepper flavor, agree that I could have upped it. Love the grittiness of the corn meal. I didn't refrigerate, just plopped them on the cookie sheet and let 'em go, and they are fine. Definitely not your average cookie. They're like little cakes. Oh yum.

WOW! This is one of my absolute favorite cookie recipes. So interesting and innovative. I don't like overly sweet desserts, so I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup or less, but otherwise perfect. I like adding poppy seeds for a bit more color and crunch, too. The pepper really makes every difference. Last time I made these I added meyer lemon zest and results were excellent, with very pretty visual results with the orange flecks that meyer lemons added. I don't bother measuring the zest--I just zest what I have and call it a day. Smooshing the zest into the sugar releases the fragrant oils so you get more mileage out of the lemons you do use. I halve the recipe because this yields a huge batch and I get overwhelmed by having to bake multiple batches of the same thing.

First time around, despite following other reviewers' tips and doubling the black pepper and adding two tablespoons of lemon juice, and also adding in ground ginger, I found these cookies a bit too flat. The black pepper wasn't really adding the complexity I wanted it to--they were just lemony and sugary. Nothing to write home about. To add some dimension, I sprinkled a tiny bit of coarse salt, mild chipolte chile powder, and cinnamon on top of each cookie right before popping them in the oven. This really complimented the lemon and resulted in a much more sophisticated taste. I still thought they were too sweet, though, so next time I will use less sugar.

I've made this several times and it's always popular. The black pepper is a surprising touch

Don't waste your time putting these puppies in the fridge. As previously posted, dropping on a sheet and squishing with a glass works just fine. I'm wondering if the pepper taste would permeate more through the cookie if it sat before baking though. . .

I took these to a family dinner with some vanilla ice cream. They were a big hit! They are subtle..just a nice lemony and buttery taste.

Doubled the pepper (at least), and baked for 8 minutes only. The cookies were delicate, but delicious. Got a full 6 dozen. These cookies are really unusual, but great.

Come on guys, if you change the recipe, it isn't fair to give it a low rating. I made these cookies exactly to the recipe posted, and they were great. They do cook fast, so be careful. I thought that the amount of black pepper the recipe calls for was perfect; it is supposed to add just a hint of warmth--they shouldn't actually taste like black pepper. These cookies were really wonderful.

An unusual cookie with a great taste -- makes a nice addition to a holiday assortment. Double the pepper!

Am hooked on cornmeal cookies after making those from CORNMEAL COOKIE SUNDAES and had high hopes for this lemon-pepper combination. Too bad: upped the pepper (maybe by 50%) and it was still barely detectable as was the lemon flavor. I did skip the chilling but can't imagine that making the difference.

I don't see what all the excitement is about. I followed the recipe to a tee, these were OK but not great. At least they were easy! But I definitely feel they are missing something. As a practical note, the yield on this recipe is definitely nowhere NEAR 6 dozen. Maybe 3 dozen.

Didn't have enough lemon zest so used lemon extract. Think the extract contributed a rough aftertaste for me. Added 2 tbs of lemon juice, too. Otherwise, very lemony, buttery and if I had (at least!) doubled the pepper, it would have been better. First time I've had cookies made with cornmeal so not used to a gritty texture from cookies. Boyfriend really likes them though!

I made these today, and I love them! Lemony and buttery. I baked them at 400 degrees for 8 to 9 minutes,as they browned too much in 10 minutes and got crumbly.

Being a big fan of both lemons and black pepper, I couldn't wait to try this recipe. B/c of comments below, I, too, added 2 T of lemon juice and doubled the black pepper -- in fact, I might have tripled it. I wasn't really measuring -- just ground the pepper right over the flour bowl. I had only enough lemons for a little less than 1/4 cup of zest, so I added a quarter teaspoon of lemon oil. I also cut the butter to 1.5 sticks instead of 2. In all, I got a tasty, lemony cookie very much reminiscent of sugar cookies. The difference, of course, came from the cornmeal and the pepper. As the recipe points out, the pepper *does* simply add a great warmth and not a sharp imposing flavor. And I unfortunately only had coarse cornmeal, which was a little hard on the teeth. One disappointment was that the cookies were very delicate. I'm not sure if the reduced butter or the coarse corn meal were culprits, but I had to handle the cookies delicately lest they break right in my hand. I'm wondering if dropping spoonfuls of chilled dough would produce a denser cookie that didn't spread as much... Still, I say give this one a whirl!

I'd say the pepper IS essential and this is a terrific recipe, earthy and sophisticated.

I made a few substitutions: 1tsp ground ginger for the pepper, added 2cm fresh grated ginger to zest, and 1/2 brown sugar with granulated (I ran out of regular), and I used polenta instead of regular cornmeal. I think the polenta was a little too coarse- very crunchy cookies. The flavor is pretty good, but not nearly as lemony as I was hoping for. Maybe add some juice too next time?

This was the first recipe I tried when I bought this great cookbook. It has a great crunchy texture and lots of lemon flavor. This cookie is for lemon lovers!

We are partial to cookies that are not too sweet and these were excellent. I took note of the comments, doubled the pepper, used a scant cup of sugar, lots of zest and a tablespoon of lemon juice. The dough was not crumbly, so I did not refrigerate it at all. I rolled them in balls and then flatened them with the bottom of a glass. I was a bit worried about the 400 degree oven, but they came out fine. Definitely will add them to my favorite adult cookie list.

I made these for an Easter sweet-table and they were a hit. Switched the black pepper for pink and green fresh ground peppercorns sprinkled over the top, rolled the dough out and cut them in the shape of chicks - cute & tasty. These are a good foil for other over-sweet items, or as a cocktail snack.

"Beyond compare" is a bit of an overstatement, but these were a big hit at the gathering where I served them. They were incredibly easy, too--I ended up leaving them in the fridge for a lot longer than I intended, and they still turned out great. Next time I'll try them without the pepper, just to see the difference. Oh--I didn't add any lemon juice--just used the peel--and they were plenty lemony.

Yummy, yummy. The cornmeal gives it a good cruch. I like lemon alot. I added 2 tablespoon of lemon juice. Makes the cookies much more flavorful. Worth the try.

To the cook from Wisconsin: The recipe is actually correct. I checked it against the original in the book. It takes about 4 lemons to get the 1/4 cup of lemon zest the recipe calls for.

These are delicious little butter cookies with a twist. Very simple recipe (except maybe for grating the lemon). I had two big lemons and got a heaping 1/4 cup of zest, but I agree you could use even more than 1/4 cup. I agree with using more pepper too. I really could hardly notice it. I like recipes where you have to think about what's in them while eating them. The cornmeal makes you wonder at first. They're a plain little cookie but very good. Oh, and I didn't have time to do the logs, etc., and my dough wasn't crumbly, so I just dropped them with my cookie scoop. Came out fine! You could dress them up with a lemon glaze.

Obviously something is missing. Judging from the comment at the top of the recipe, one needs to add the juice from 3-4 lemons. Not very good "proofreading" on somebody's part

These are really interesting and tasty. For anyone who is a fan of cornmeal and cookies that aren't too sweet, these will be a big hit. Very interesting flavor -- definitely recommend using the pepper and *lots* of lemon. If you like some kick, I'd even use a little extra pepper.
