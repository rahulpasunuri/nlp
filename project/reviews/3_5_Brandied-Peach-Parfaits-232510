These were VERY good. My problem was caramelizing the sugar--don't know what I did wrong, but I had to fish out some sugar "rocks" after cooking the peaches. Also, my peaches were so ripe that I was able to skip the blanch-to-peel step. Since my parfait glasses hold about 7 oz., I used 3 small scoops (#60, 9/16 oz. scooper) of pistachio/almond ice cream in each of the two layers of ice cream. The green and orange colors were pretty, and the dessert was YUMMY!!!

Sorry, but I didn't like this... the end result tasted like canned peaches in a very sweet syrup. By the time you put it on ice cream any brandy flavor was lost. I thought my peaches had better flavor & texture plain.

Outstanding. Everyone loved it. I was worried that there was too much sugar in it and it would be too sweet; not true. I also worried that the sugar wouldn't melt into the proper consistency for the caramel. I had to stir longer than expected, but it was perfect. After placing the peaches in the caramel I had a couple of pieces of caramel harden. I just left it on the stove and stirred until the pieces melted. All was perfect in the end.

We served this at a gourmet dinner party where the host chooses the menu but each couple prepares a course. It was not a very sophisticated dessert, but everyone certainly enjoyed it. The ice cream balls were made ahead to avoid excessive melting (a must), and blackberries and chopped roasted pecans were added to each layer for color and texture. The carmelization of the peaches was time consuming and maybe unnecessary, as they never thickened. Next time I will try just slicing and sugaring the peaches and then adding the brandy.

Awesome! Very liquidy at the end... left it on the stove longer (at a lower temperature, but still hot) to let it thicken up. Great with unsweetened, plain Greek yogurt too!

Easy and elegant. I served with ginger gelato from Trader Joe's instead of vanilla ice cream for an extra layer of flavor. A huge hit.

This is fantastic. My husband said it's one of the best desserts he's ever had. The sugar took longer to melt. Next time I'll try the previous suggestion of adding a little water to the sugar. That might keep the caramel from hardening so much when the peaches are added. The sauce will keep a couple of days in the refrigerator, if you are lucky enough to have some left over. I will definitely serve this to guests!

I've made this twice this week since the peaches are in season - the second time with port instead of brandy. I like both equally. It is very simple to make and the presentation is outstanding. A definite keeper.

I quadrupled the recipe and fed it to 15 people. It received incredible raves and one friend said, "This is incredible! It's a series of rich flavors!" My mother even asked for the recipe. This one is a complete winner.

The flavors were great! The sugar took longer to melt than indicated in the recipe. I used VSOP Cognac and a pinch of vanilla. Although they tasted a bit to sweet on thier own, when paired with the vanilla ice cream, it was a wonderful balance!

Very nice and a great use for fresh peaches. If you have trouble with caramel, use the technique of mixing water with the sugar to get a nice, even caramel. Be sure to cook it back down after you add the peach mixture - there is a lot of water in there. A fantastic dessert - your guests will love it.

This dessert was a big hit on Saturday night. I made the peach/caramel/brandy mixture ahead of time, then assembled the parfaits in a few minutes. They were delicious. The brandy is light and not overpowering. Good ice cream is a must. This is a warm weather keeper!

If your not used to making carmelsauce it can be intimidating. Don't fret. Great recipe and easy to serve over great ice cream. Making it again this weekend for dinner.

So easy and simple! Old fashioned food at its finest. Use the very best ice cream you can. You can also substitute bourbon or southern comfort for the brandy. My guests raved.
