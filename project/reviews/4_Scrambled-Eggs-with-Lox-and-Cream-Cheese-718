Delicious & simple. BUT . . . Eggs would burn up if I cooked them on medium-high heat. I used 3 (I consider that low heat) on my gas range and they still took less than the stated time.

i had this once at sarahbeth's in nyc and loved it. i was hosting a brunch and thought this dish would be perfectalong with french toast and a spinach salad with fruit and toasted nuts. my guests devoured it all and swore it was the best brunch they'd had all year! i will 100% make this dish again and again.

My second review -- Continue to LOVE this recipe, but this time I made a few changes based on what I had (or didn't have) in hands. I substituted the salmon for 1 lobster tail. I diced the meat and then I sauteed with butter and some olive oil. I scrambled the eggs in the grease of the lobster and then added cooked lobster meat and at the end the cream cheese. It was divine and very, very elegant and tasty!

We call this "Jewish Bliss" to contrast with a diner in NJ which serves an almost identical breakfast they call just "Bliss", but served with bacon instead of lox. I also add some chopped green onion

Simply loved this recipe! So easy to make and EVERYONE loved it! Next time I will put the cream cheese in the freezer for a few minutes before cutting it in cubes - it was a little messy! Excellent choice for a very elegant and tasty brunch!

We LOVE this dish, have made it half a dozen times at least, whenever we have family and friends here for the weekend. I add, depending on what's on hand: diced avocado, canned green chilies; sauteed mushrooms, red bell pepper. Sometimes I throw in some extra cheddar cheese. I also make 2 batches: one with the smoked salmon, and another without, as some people do not like fish in thier eggs. This dish is ALWAYS well received!

I had this last spring at Sarabeth's in NY and was thrilled to find the recipe online. If you find yourself outside the U.S. and consequently have a hard time finding cream cheese, I can report that creme fraîche works nearly as well. It is worse at holding together once you put it in, but if you are interested in a heart attack at an early age, it might even be a bit better.

Delicious. Not something you'd want to eat every day (it's quite rich!), but easy and very tasty.

My husband and I thought this tasted good, but would have preferred the cream cheese on bagels as a side rather than mixed into the lox and eggs. I also lightly sauteed red onion and this was a very good addition.

I had this at Sarabeth's and it was awesome! I figured it would be tasty, but it was even better than I expected. It is very rich, but please don't cut back on the cream cheese - just save this recipe for times when you feel like being decadent.

This was very good. A little fresh dill was a nice addition.

An excellent recipe for a decadent weekend breakfast. It's a favourite at our house on Christmas morning. I use the light cream cheese to lower the fat content -- it's not much but it helps!

This is the favorite of the neighborhood guys at their Saturday morning breakfasts. It is very rich, but delicious and easy to make.
