I love this recipe! I've made it again and again with the vegetable quinoa from the same section of the April 2007 Bon Appetit. Gets rave reviews at pot lucks and everybody loves it. I even made a vegan version for my husband where I substituted vegetable broth for chicken broth and plain seitan for the beef chuck roasts. He loves it too and even meat eaters agree. I've made both versions for one dinner and both disappear at equally quick rates.

This is a fantastic basic recipe. I would make the following changes; substitute inexpensive balsamic for "red wine vinegar" and instead of two cups of pitted dates I would use one cup of dates and one cup of cranberries, either fresh or frozen. The cranberries give it a bit of a sweet and sour taste. Finally, I would add the zest of at least one orange, 7 or 8 carrots and 3 or 4 quartered sweet potatoes, all unpeeled.

Gave this one 4 forks with modifications. I had one very small roast to work with, cut unknown (out of the freezer). 1/2 C OJ, 1/3 C balsamic vinegar, 1 can beef broth, 1/4 C red wine, 3 dates, just under 1 C tomato sauce, 5 whole peppercorns, pinch ground cloves, dash allspice, 1 sliced onion caramelized. Seared the roast in a pan and then cooked in the crockpot until fall apart tender. Was very good. Sprinkled with parsley, but wasn't necessary.

What am I missing here? I love a balance of sweet and tart, but I only used a cup of dates and no added sugar and thought this was still overpoweringly sweet. And yes--something is the recipe (the vinegar?) makes the dates turn opaque and pallid-looking, really unattractive. I'd never seen that happen before. There are too many good pot roast recipes out there for me to try this again.

We make this dish every year for our Passover Seder. It always gets rave reviews. I make no changes, except we double or triple the recipe to feed the masses that come to our Seder.

I have now made this twice and received rave reviews each time. Using a fresh chuck roast makes a difference. I added a little chinese five spice and will probably add cloves the next time - it goes so well with the guinoa with carrots and zuccini receipe.

I made this using three silver tip roasts all in one large cast iron pot. I cut down the sugar. After cooking, I cooled it, sliced the meat, and froze it. A week later I defrosted and cooked in large pyrex dish in a 350 degree oven for a good hour (covered). The flavors really melded and the meat was tender and delicious.

Really great. Big hit. I added carrots.

I haven't tried this exactly...but I've cooked a recipe like this for years....in addition add dried apricots and even some dried figs. This gives it a very traditional flavor that many of us remember from our youth. Throw a potato in, it won't hurt you!

I made this dish and was worried by the other reviews about too sweet. When the dish was done I tasted it and thought, "Oh my, they were right!" I added salt and pepper and PERFECT! Next time I will add carrots as it could use some color.

I thought this was a wonderful and unique take on the traditional pot roast. I would leave it in the oven for a little less time, however, as I prefer my meat a little pinker. An hour was good for a perfectly well done pot roast.

Nothing special at all.

I made this for Mother's Day for my grandmother and mother. Both thought it was great. Grandma especially enjoyed it since it was tender enough for her to eat with her tooth situation. I wish some of the other flavors (like onion and vinegar) had come through better.

This is the first 1 fork rating I've ever given, but I actually could not eat this dish. Even without the sugar it was sickly sweet. For whatever reason the roast, even after additional cooking, didn't get to 'fall apart' stage but instead was chewy. The meat I could have dealt with, but the fact that it tasted like it should have been dessert did me in.

I made this for a Passover Seder. All my guests loved it and I will certainly make again (with no changes).

This turned out fabulously in the slow- cooker. I didn't have the nerve to try the dates, which seemed too desserty, but definitely add carrots--they were so tasty. Paired with "Mashed Potatoes with Celery Root and Mascarpone" this was one to lick off the plate!

something different- nice flavor w/ the dates- i sliced them & they melded nicely- but it was very sweet. i might make again- if I do I'll cut out the tsp of sugar on each side, perhaps add more tomato.

Not too appetizing. The way the dates look in the pot at the end of it - let's just say, not too appetizing...

I made this recipe for some friends for a very casual occasion. I followed the recipe exactly, however, I left out the dates since I am not a fan of them. The dinner was excellent. To this day, some months later, those friends still talk about the roast and what a good cook I am. If only they knew how easy this was!

Made this for Passover seder and people not only had seconds, but took the leftovers home with them! I added a bit more vinegar for deglazing because I was using a large pan and similarly used more liquid for the sauce (some extra chicken broth, orange juice and tomato sauce). I made this 2 days ahead, and so skimmed the fat after refrigerating - much easier as it rises to the top.

Absolutely delicious. We served this to our gourmet club friends and we ALL decided this we would make this one again at home.

This was a truly delicious pot roast. I added a bit more tomatoe sauce and found that the sweet flavor was a quite good. I did not expect to enjoy the quinoa to find that it pared perfectly. This was made for our Passover dinner. Second helpings on many a plate. I will surely make it again.

This was totally amazing. Everyone loved it and begged for the recipe. The only change I made was that I sliced it after refrigerating for two days, and then refrigerated one more day, and then reheated for about two hours at 275 degrees. It was unbelievably tender. Will definitely make it again.

I found this recipe very easy to make with amazing results. My husband said it's the best pot roast he's ever had! The quinoa resipe that it is paired with is wonderful as well, and they do compliment each other perfectly.
