Cumin ruins this as too much of a bold flavor to serve this with anything else and have it go well

Good recipe. A good combination of salty, sweet, sour, and spicy. An hour seems a long time to cook carrots. I might recommend adding less water and cooking for a shorter time to maintain crunchiness. Adding raisins could enhance the flavor.

My kids and husband don't generally like cooked carrots but they loved these! I also blanched the carrots first but will try them the other way next time.

I absolutely love this dish! So healthy, tasty and a nice departure from plain boiled carrots. I cut back on the cumin and oil. Also, I reduced the juice mixture until it was just a syrup. So delicious.

Excellent! Probably the best carrot recipe I've ever tried.

Followed the recipe, except for the orange slices. Turned out just fine. Served it w/chicken tikka & cilantro/coconut rice. This is a nice way to do carrots.

My 10 year old daughter started asking for a taste as soon as I put all the ingredients together. At the tabke she kept asking, "Does anyone else want more carrots?". The answer was,"YES".

I found that my dislike for cumin continues - BUT, powdered ginger makes a wonderful substitute!

I made this last night as a practice run for Easter. Wonderful! I was intrigued by the combination of flavors. My husband isn't used to unique combinations of foods so he was skeptical about oranges and carrots together. But he loved it! It was easy (and fun!) to make. I followed the recipe exactly (except I cut it down for just two servings). I love the way the carrots are cut and I learned a new way to get the juicy sections out of an orange. And it was easy for me to cut the recipe down to two servings while still getting the same great flavors. I'll make this as a side dish along with the Ginger-Rum Glazed Ham from Gourmet March 1991.
