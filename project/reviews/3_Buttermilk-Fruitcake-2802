I picked this recipe to use up the dried fruit and buttermilk I had left over. Did not have brandy so I used Grand Marnier instead. Thank God because there was not much to say about this cake. Definitely needs more dried fruit and/or more pecans, something to keep interest and give it texture. Otherwise it is not much to write home about.

This cake didn't turn out as spectacular as I thought it would: it didn't have enough fruit in it, was too dry, and had a heavy butter flavor which was unappetizing. It baked in about 55 minutes - how one can bake it for 1 hour and 15 minutes at 350 degrees without burning it is beyond me.

Since I was really sick of traditional fruitcake(and so was everyone else). I decided to make this cake. It was surprisingly delicious. Made several small ones as gifts and got such great compliments, even was told to quit my job and just bake this cake. Great recipe!!
