Use the recipe adapted by Sardine in Madison, Wisconsin, also on the Epicurious site. Much better depth of flavor achieved by using more coconut and dividing it into half toasted, half as is and also adding a small amt of coconut rum. The coconut is not left in the creme brulee either so it is a smooth, and consequently more traditional texture...and much, much more coconut flavor-delicious.

I stand with the nay-sayers on this recipe. Next time I'll try one of the other coconut creme brulee recipes on this site as the concept sounds delicious.

Every coconut lover should make this creme brulee recipe.It's flavorful without being overly sweet. The bits of coconut flakes added great texture to the creamy creme brulee. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.

Love this recipe. It makes a delicious, creamy coconut creme brulee that is great as a dessert with an Asian dinner. You can substitute regular rum with coconut extract if you don't have coconut rum. Also, I strained the coconut out, and left it in, and 3 out of 3 of us preferred the coconut to be left in the dish. I made it the same day I wanted to cook it, no overnight refrigeration. You can also "reheat" the outside of the brulee by using your kitchen torch on the outside of the ramekin.

I always read reviews before making a new recipe. A lot of previous posters said they omitted the coconut flakes to preserve texture, but the result was a good-textured dish primarily lacking in coconut taste. I made mine with the coconut, and I have to agree to err on the side of texture rather than flavor. The flakes were fine for my husband and his impressed buddies, but I did not like them. I think it's best to leave them out and make up for the lack in coconut flavor by sprinkling the top with toasted flakes (toast them with the torch/broiler).

I was reluctant to spoil the smooth silky texture of a good creme brulee with flaked or shredded coconut, so instead, I added chopped fresh coconut to the cream mixture (could easily use the storebought flaked/shredded), simmered it, and then strained it, before proceeding with the rest of the recipe. This infused a delicious amount of coconut flavour while still maintaining that traditional smooth texture. Perfect! A splash of vanilla or some fresh bean makes a ton of difference in depth of flavour. Golden sugars will brown up a bit easier, but the white sugar gives it that distinctively hard crack on the top. Also, skip the broiler method and spring for a torch, they're cheap, and do the crust immediately before serving. If you're going the fresh coconut route, once you crack it open, run a vegetable peeler around the inside to get some nice curls, toss on a sheet pan and bake in the oven while the brulees bake. A single toasted coconut curl tops it beautifully as a garnish. Top notch.

Really liked the addition of coconut - and I also added a tsp of vanilla to the egg mixture for depth. Turned out gorgeous. I always like to use natural, unrefined (golden) sugar for the top - caramelizes perfectly every time.

Made this to serve as a dessert for a Indian Dinner, worked perfectly!

I needed extra servings of this so I add a third to each ingredient. The first time was a failure, but with an adjustment the second time was exquisite: 3/4 C sugar, 9 yolks/1 whole, 2.5 C cream, 1 C coconut milk... get a bain marie ready, then start heating the liquids, then mix eggs/sugar and whip over bain marie until pale yellow and slightly fluffy. then temper eggs w/ hot cream. pour into custard dishes and place them in pan, in oven, then use bain marie water (boiled)pour into pan half way up side of custard dishes. 30 min @ 375F covered loosely w/ foil, turn pan once at 15 min. I used toasted ribbon coconut as garnish to maintain the creamy texture of a true brulee, as well as, of course, the glazed sugar finish. Awesome!!

I have made this excellent dessert numerous times - with the following revisions: 1. I do not add the shredded coconut to the custard (don't like that texture in there), rather I toast the coconut and add it to the top of the finished dish. 2. I mix about 1T brown sugar to the white sugar that gets topped and brulee'd. This helps achieve that beautiful brown caramelized color to the top of the dessert - then use the toasted coconut to hide any blemishes! Would (and have) make this dessert again, and again!

I used unsweetened coconut and it was definitely sweet and very tasty! Did not use a torch, but it would probably do a better job than the broiler. I definitely would make this again. My guests loved it!

Delicious. For my personal taste however, I would not include the flaked coconut--I didn't like how the shreads "interrupted" the smoothness of the brulee. The coconut milk alone would add the wonderful, although subtle flavor. Also, I wouldn't broil the sugar until an hour or so before serving: I enjoy a hard crust to a soggy one.

This recipe far surpassed my expectations. It makes creme brulee more interesting than the regular one. I also tried a pumpkin one but this one is my favorite.

If you love coconut, this is a delicious alternative to the classic Creme Brulee. I made a test run before serving it at a large dinner party, (so I had it for two nights in a row) and found the coconut so sweet, that the caramelized sugar wasn't really necessary (perhaps made it too sweet). Quite simple to prepare, but not recommended for people on the fence about the texture/flavor of coconut. Will stick with the classic Vanilla Creme Brulee for the dinner party (the one enclosed with the kitchen torch purchased from Williams-Sonoma).

I did modify this recipe alittle, I reduced the coconut milk by a tablespoonand added a tablespoon of Coco Lopez. It turned out excellent, very coconutty. My Husband loves coconut and Creme Brulee and he was in Heaven with this!!!

This was very good. I tested it before a party and was pleased. I did have a problem carmelizing the top. It seemed to take so long in the oven. I have since gotten a creme brulee torch.

Maybe a *little* too sweet. Next time I'd cut down the sugar a bit. Also, a little thicker than a regular creme brulee. Nonetheless, delicious. My guests were happy. I'd make it again for sure.

Wonderful. If you are a C.B. purist, don't try this, the texture will throw you off but try it just for the tasty experience. I will cook this over and over again. We had it for Easter dessert and it was very appropriate.

This was horrible... the texture was terrible. My friends still make fun of me!

I was a little worried about the texture of the coconut in the creme brulee, but it did not bother me at all. If you take care to properly broil or flame the top, you will get enough crunch from the carmelized sugar that the coconut blends right in. I did find it a little bit too sweet, but don't let that stop you from making an otherwise excellent dessert!

I was very disappointed in this recipe... the shredded coconut in the custard just didn't work for me or for my wife... and we both love coconut. I much prefer just plain ole' creme brulee.

I found the taste sensational when I followed the recipe exactly. Instead of burning sugar, I omitted that and served it in a pool of pureed tin mangoes, very tropical and very tasty indeed.

I took some suggestions from other reviews and left out the coconut. (I thought it wouldn't be good for the texture) Then, even with the additional unsweeted coconut milk, it didn't taste like coconut to me at all. I say I would make it again, because it was good if you like a plain creme brulee. In hindsight I should have toatsted coconut and sprinkled it on top or mixed in a small amount of coco lopez. If that doesn't work, maybe chase it with a pina colada.

I recently made this for my family and they loved it! My recommendation would be to skip the coconut flakes. Also I used 1 cup of coconut milk and added an extra tablespoon of sugar. This is truly an easy recipe!

Usually we find that the recipes rated "4-forks" tend to be overrated on this site. Not this one! It's AMAZING. And what's even better (and we have made several creme brulee recipes prior to this), it's SO EASY! Our recommendation, though - use a torch and skip the oven-browning step. Yum!

Everyone raved about this! It was pretty easy to make, and we couldn't wait for it to chill!! It set up great. The coconut milk I used was left over from another great recipe, spicy salmon with tyai vegtables. I have never used coconut milk before these recipies, but they made it worth it!

I have a friend who is a chef and I never can seem to impress him with my cooking even though everyone else raves about my meals. He figures he could have done it as well or better, so rarely get praise from him. Anyway, I made this creme brulee and he loved it. He even asked for the recipe so he could put it in his little black book.

WOW! This was amazing! I have never made creme brulee before- it sounded gourmet and dificult. But this was easy, and I like that it could be prepared ahead. I liked the mixture of chewy coconut and creamy custard. I put brown sugar on the tops of some, and that was good too. I had a little difficulty browning the tops since my oven has only one sweet spot. I will buy a refill for my little torch next time. It was so good that all the cream didn't leave me with any feelings of guilt!

Great Recipe, I got up last Saturday morning and made it. No special occasion just decided to go ahead and make because I was curious about the taste. I halved the recipe and used 4 4oz ramekins that worked perfectly. I didn't add the flaked coconut and I added some vanilla extract. Wonderful flavor, smooth consistency, simply delicious and so easy to make. It took me all of 15 minutes to mix the ingredients and then I popped them in the oven.

This is a very simple and delicious dessert! It was fun to surprise my husband and kids on Valentine's Day with it. Preparing it a day ahead was helpful as it gave me more time to make and enjoy the main course. I may try a little less flaked coconut next time, but I will make this recipe over and over. Thanx! sm

This was a glorious finish for our New Year's Eve party this year. Wonderful recipe! I later made it again for just the two of us and used half the number of eggs and while lighter, it was just as tasty. A real keeper!
