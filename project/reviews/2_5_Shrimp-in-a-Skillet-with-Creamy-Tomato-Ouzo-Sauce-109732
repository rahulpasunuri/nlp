just made it tonight as a pasta sauce and loved it. added a bit more ouzo and used canned tomatoes. That is so quick and easy and the ouzo really makes it special. Admitted: the recipe needs editing. Very unusual for Epicurious.

As others have mentioned, this was a poorly edited recipe. I used Sambuca instead of Ouzo and added it with the tomatoes and then added the shrimp. The flavours were not very strong; I could barely taste the anise flavour of the Sambuca. Perhaps it would have been better with Ouzo or if I added the liquor at a dfferent time. Also, when I added the cream it seemed to curdle because of the lemon juice in the shrimp. It still turned out okay after cooking it for awhile. I think the combination of flavours could work really well togther, but this recipe needs something more to give it that zing. Perhaps some oregano would help???

The recipe is delicious; I would save time by buying pre-cooked shrimp especially if de-veining is not your specialty. You can add the Ouzo to the sauce as you would with any wine based cooking recipe or you may sauté the shrimp with the ouzo to boost the flavor of the shrimp while your are cooking in the skillet. It's all in your preference. The editing for the recipe is horrible but it's not that hard to figure out what you need to do with the Ouzo.

Is this really how the recipe reads in the book? Fire the editor! When do you add the shrimp? When do you add the ouzo (or should the cook just drink it)? I did not make this recipe because it is unmakeable as written. Really bad quality control in the publishing of this.

I haven't made this recipe, but I plan to. I assume that the process is meant to mimic the one used for a vodka sauce, so I'll be adding the ouzo in with the tomatoes.

I haven't made this recipe, but I am always skeptical of recipes that are not carefully edited. Here the ingredients include ouzo, but the instructions never say when to add it. Also, a suggestion for a substitute for the exotic ingredient, pastrouma, would be welcome. Is it like pastrami? I sure wouldn't buy the book that this recipe is taken from.

This recipe does not say when to put the ouzo in. Do you put it in with the cream? Or do you put it in with that last tablespoon of butter?

Same questions as the previous review. Please reprint.

I was going to make this, but while reading through the recipe I noticed that it does not mention putting the shrimp in the pan and then never adds the ouzo. When do the shrimp go in the pan? When should the ouzo be added? I would hesitate to make this until someone adds the missing information. Thanks.
