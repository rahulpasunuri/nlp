I've been making this ever since it was published. For a sweet sauce, this is very good. I am catering a party, and will start off with onion and also add some whole tomatoes crushed up for more depth. I change out my homemade spice rubs, and skip the mop usually so the chicken cooks faster. You can use parts instead of the spatchcock whole chicken preparation, but indirect grilling is the only way I do bone-in chicken. Try a variety of woods like olive, pecan, maple or cherry. My favorite smoking wood with chicken is orange wood.

Awesome chicken. This is so good it is to die for. I make it every summer without fail and it is always a huge hit. OMG.

This is a good recipe but when you don't EVER eat chicken skin you loose a lot of the flavor. We followed the indirect BBQ method with hickory chips. The chicken was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.I don't think the sauce is a WOW but good.

I have used this recipe every summer since it was first published. This is a great all around recipe that appeals to my family, kids, and friends. It seems to hit those who like sweet, savory, and not too spicy. It can easily be altered to any of the above categories with ease. Chicken has always turned out moist, and has a good flavorful skin. (maybe that's my husbands grilling technique) :)

This is our standard summer recipe. Our guests always love it. Be careful if you use a smoker instead of a grill--the chicken can soak up too much smoke.

This is truly the best griled chicken recipe I have ever tried. The root beer barbeque sauce is out of this world.

Did this for 150 people at a golf tournament and it was a big hit. Because it was an older crowd, I cut back on the pepper in the rub by 1/2. Due to size of group BBQ was a commercial one so couldn't due the smoking with chips but didn't seem to have an effect on the outcome or the great comments.

This is great BBQ. My husband who doesn't like chicken even loves it. I brine the chicken and skip the mop but hickory chips are a must.

this is one of our all time favorites. we leave the water out of the brine and we have brined up to 4 days. we also make extra rub with hungarian hot paparika and use a ton of it. we don't even need the root beer sauce. we make this with chicken wings and drumettes, cornish game hens, and just plain chickens too.

The barbeque sauce rocks by itself. Friends who have tasted the food agree with that and all had the same opinion about the rub and mop effect. I would only use the barbeque sauce next time,it also tastes great on steaks and pork chops. The difference in the flavor over other barbecue sauces is refreshing. I would not use the rub or the mop again. The rub has too heavy a paprika flavor and the mop does not do much except wash off some of the rub.

We loved the sauce and the viniagar and spice mopping kept the chicken moist. Frankly I have had success without using the newspaper etc....too time consuming. We usually cook the chicken over indirect heat in the grill.....use woodchips when handy but not all the time. In the winter....we make this in the oven and just bake and use the sauce. This is my nine-year old's favorite sauce.

Considering that all my husband drinks is A&W, he was thrilled that it made it into one of the dishes we were going to prepare. I was wary, but in the end, very impressed. It was great, wouldn't change a thing.

We have wanted to try this recipe since last year when we received the issue. We got everything together to do this ,and the result certainly did not meet our expectations. Quite frankly,our end result was a ham not a chicken. Save yourself the time and purchase a hickory smoked ham. This was not good. Our children thought it was so weird. " We thought this was chicken Mom and Dad!"

The resulting chicken was a little too sweet for my taste. This recipe would probably benefit greatly from cayenne, as some users have said. I also tend to like my chicken crusty (on the edge of burnt) and I would cook this faster, over a higher flame.

This dish was absolutely amazing! The chicken was so tender and the sauce was yummy! A word of caution, though, pull up a chair and read a book. It makes it relaxing while you baste.

Actually, I don't know if I'll ever make this again, even though it was very very good - it's SO MUCH WORK! There are other extremely nice BBQ options that aren't so labor intensive. It's quite rich and complex, though, so if you do make it, make it worthwhile and do a lot at once.

Good tasting bbq chicken but not worth the time and energy. If you have an afternoon to kill, you may want to try it, however, there are better recipes that require half the work.

Made this recipe on a weber gas grill as others did and turned out fine. My family loved the chicken and have the made the barbecue sauce for several other dishes.

This recipe as written was so time-consuming and complicated that I almost didn't try it. But the rub and sauce recipies were so irresistable that I created shortcuts and have now made it twice. I just used chicken breasts (with bone & skin). I used the rub as directed. I pre-cooked the chicken for about 10-15 minutes in the microwave in a reduced amount of the mop mixture (just enough to provide moisture in the bottom of the cooking dish). Then I grilled it with the root beer sauce. It is possibly the best combination of flavors I have ever tasted in barbecued chicken!!

We live in Kansas City, so grilling and bar-b-que are year-round activities at our house. This chicken recipe is much more complicated than it has to be to produce really wonderful results. No chicken should be subjected to ALL of this attention- the rub is great - use it and any of the terrific sauces on the market and you have a winner. Smoked chicken is another dish all together - and should really stand by itself if done properly. Keep it simple - who needs the aggravation?

I have made this at least 8 times in thelast 2 months. To save time, I now make the rub and sauce in batches (store rub in small glass jars and sauce freezes very well). I partially cook the rubbed chicken pieces before grilling (I like my chicken COOKED) and was able to achieve the same results in 45 minutes of grilling without adding more charcoal. We never eat chicken with skin but this is too delicious to resist!

To begin, the sauce is great. It really does taste like root beer, and unlike anything out of a bottle. The recipe for a rub and mop also add to the finished product. I have to say though, my chicken did not cook at such low temperatures. After using indirect heat in a Weber kettle grill for 90 minutes, I had to finish up the chicken in a hot oven. Next time, I would keep my grill in the 350 - 400* zone, mopping (and losing ALL the heat) every fifiteen minutes -or- using a lower temperature but not opening to mop, and instead just adding two coats of barbecue sauce at the end.

This was a lot of work for so/so chicken. I didn't care for the sauce, too much Worcestershire sauce and I didn't care for the flavor of the Root Beer. Since I don't have a chimney starter, I couldn't add hot briquettes and had to finish the chicken in the oven.

I altered this recipe somewhat. Instead of using an entire chicken, I used chicken breasts. I did the rub, but then marinated the chicken in the mop mixture for about 1/2 hour. Then grilled the chicken using the root beer sauce. Turned out fine, and the sauce has a good taste to it.

This was great chicken, everyone like it. A word of caution though, I had to use green ketchup as that was what I had on hand & the bbq sauce turned out bright green; it looked like we were eating frog, but it tasted delicious! Will make again, but with regular ketchup!

I have made this recipe four times and it has turned out great every time! The rub gives it great flavor & spice, the mop adds more flavor and keeps the chicken very moist. I think the loaf pan with water also contributes to the moisture and juiciness. Do not eliminate that step. The last three times I've used chicken pieces and shortened the grilling time slightly,leaving the thighs on a bit longer than the rest. The other night I substituted a good quality bottled Hickory Flavored BBQ Sauce (I didn't have the Root Beer BBQ Sauce ingredients on hand). It worked very well in a pinch!

Outstanding flavor and despite the three steps, (rub, mop and sauce) this was very easy to prepare. Our biggest challenge was reducing the heat of the grill to prevent burning. We have yet to master the skill of "slow cooking" when it comes to grilling. Suggestions welcome.

Everyone at our family dinner gathering declared this the BEST grilled chicken they'd ever had. We used a GAS grill (gasp), with hickory charcoal thrown on, and cooked on the very highest rack and lowest possible temperature, and it turned out tender, juicy, nicely browned -- and without a huge effort to monitor the cooking.

Excellent!!! I didn't have root beer or chicken so I made it with Coca Cola and ribs and marinated the ribs with the rub for about 6 hours. We cooked it in the smoker for about 2 hours brushing with the sauce for about the last 30 minutes. Both my husband and I agree these were the BEST ribs we've made, the meat was very moist even though we had a flame-up which charred the outside. We'll try it with the root beer and chicken next. The sauce maybe a little spicy for some so eliminating 1 TBL of worcestershire may help.

We wanted to try this recipie but didn't have a chimney and really felt we could get the same effect with smoke chips. We followed the ingredients but then simply put the chicken on with some hickory smoke chips on the grill and cooked through. It came out great. I don't think the extra effort would have paid off.

This was a huge hit at my son's first birthday party - in fact, our friends asked us to make it again for their party. We'll be making it again tonight. We ran out of regular ketchup while making the sauce and had to use hot ketchup for the final 1/4 cup - yummy! It added a nice bit of spice and cut the sweetness. This is a labor-intensive recipe but well worth the efforts.

I was very excited to make this dish. When I started the BBQ sauce I was a little uneasy about it. Once the chicken was basted with it everything fell into place. The rub, basting and sauce complimented each other very well. I'm making this same dish this very weekend for a birthday party.

Although this was tasty, it was a lot of time spent running back and forth to the grill. Although most guests loved it, kids didn't like it at all (surprising with root beer in sauce). However, it was great grilled chicken and the recipe worked just fine. Make sure that your side dishes don't need much attention and get a chair by the Webber!

This was absolutely the BEST barbecued chicken EVER! My husband and I made it on 4th of July and think it will become a tradition. Tasted even better the next day, cold. Only hitch - it takes more briquets than called for in the recipe. We're making it again and will adjust.

Very good, not sweet as you might guess from the root beer. Lots of postive comments from guests. Spice rub adds a lot of flavor and matches BBQ sauce well.
