Have made this twice so far and it will continue to appear at my table! Very quick and easy. The balsamic vinegar (regular supermarket type) and charred radicchio go very well together and what doesn't go well with prosciutto and melted cheese? The smokiness of the mozzarella makes the dish taste like it might have been grilled. Great idea. I serve mine over a bed of lightly dressed greens for looks and flavor. I feel the wedges of radicchio on their own aren't quite enough.

Regular balsamic vinegar can be used for roasting process. And I drizzled my end product with more olive oil and some balsamico. If you can not afford high end balsamico (not the vinegar) take your balsamic vinegar and reduce it in a pan over med-low heat until it is half volume. This will produce a syrupy sweet product when cooled. DO NOT ADD SUGAR.
