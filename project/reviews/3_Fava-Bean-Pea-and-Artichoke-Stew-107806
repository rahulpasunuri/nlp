I used this recipe as part of a "happening" to show off some locally made guanciale from locally sourced heirloom pork. Interestingly, you can't really taste the guanciale as it gives over its flavor entirely to the vegetables. As a stew, It wasn't quite what I expected, but if you think of it as an awesome side dish, as the best substitute for mashed potatoes ever, well then, invite me for dinner and I'll be there! Cleaning the artichokes are a pain; I was told that in Italy they use true baby artichokes that you can't get here, and then the prep work is next to nothing. My prep chef and I made a double batch, so we had a heck of a lot of shelling and artichoke-ing; at least shelling fava beans you don't risk getting stabbed like working around the choke! Someone suggested artichoke hearts, but that feels like cheating somehow; I was using fresh peas, so I wanted to use all fresh vegetables. Anyway, I kept noshing on a bowl of this while preparing the other 3 entrees; I enjoyed stealing spoonfuls of this, I even forgot my wine that was on the counter! Final word; the Sicilian chef-owner of the restaurant said this was "very traditional" and that they had this all over Sicily. Buon appetito!

This is a fantastic dish; I try to make it each spring now. It's hearty yet light, and the flavors are a perfect example of what happens when you use great complementary ingredients simply. I've only used favas, peas and artichokes in season, but I imagine frozen peas and artichoke hearts would do well in the off-months.

Postscript: 1) After cooking the artichokes separately, the remaining stewed ingredients should be transferred to the pot containing the artichokes, using a slotted spoon to drain. Then mix and stew together until fully reduced. 2) FROZEN FAVA BEANS imported from China by Whole Foods disintegrate. Don't bother using. It's much better to make this with fresh fava beans when they're available despite the time-consuming process of shelling them.

I prefer David Downie's recipe for the following reasons: 1) While there are many different ways to make this stew, MINT is traditional. Substitute fresh mint for oregano. 2) Artichokes are best if stewed separately, stems separated from globes (easier to clean). Saute 3 T minced mint & 1-3 cloves minced garlic in 4 T EVOO, 1 minute. Season & add 1/2 cup ea. light dry white wine & water, then artichoke slices. Cover & simmer 30-40 minutes, till soft. Meanwhile prepare the rest of vegetables in different pot & mix after both done. What I like about this recipe is the inclusion of pancetta, though the vegetarian version is great, too. Both are traditional. Note that Whole Foods & other supermarkets now sell frozen fava beans if you can't find fresh ones. I agree that waiting a day before serving vignarola is a good idea. Excellent simply with a good crusty bread to mop up juices, or accompanied/followed by veal or chicken scalloppini sauted in butter and sage w lemon wedges on side.

Yummy! I added garlic, doubled the onion and added more oregano. Since it stews for so long, I saw little value in using fresh artichokes. All I had were marinated ones, which added a little vinegary zing. (I rinsed them well so the marinade didn't overpower the other subtle flavors.) Served with cheddar beer biscuits and tossed salad - it was a (surprising) hit!

The flavor on this recipe is quite nice. Try not to use ANY of the artichoke leaves - just the hearts and stems. I tried to use the lower portions of the leaves and I had my family fishing out threads throughout dinner.

A really authentic Italian taste, especially when made a day in advance allowing the flavours time to mature.
