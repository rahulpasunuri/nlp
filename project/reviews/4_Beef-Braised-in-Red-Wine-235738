Awesome. Very much worth the effort. Pretty much stuck to directions except that I browned the marinade onions as I was sauteing shallots in separate pan. Better served over smashed small red potatoes. Stew was even tastier the second day. I doubled recipe.

I was really excited about this recipe because of the glowing reviews. Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed for the amount of work that went into it. I love in-depth recipes where the work pays off, but this just wasn't 1 of them. I could make a 1-pot beef stew that would be just as good or better for far less work.

I tripled the recipe to serve 8 adults and was glad I did. There was just enough left for two light dinner servings. The meat was so tender and flavorful that my guests didn't even ask if there were seconds, they just headed to the pot in the kitchen! Perfect on a cold winter night.

I totally disagree with the rave reviews for this recipe, when there are SO many better boeuf bourguionon choices! Whoever thinks it's OK to brown the meat without flouring with salt and pepper is misguided.

This was really something. I used an inexpensive French red; I was worried about the wine overpowering the dish, but it was just wonderful in the end. Unlike many of the other reviewers, I added the 'solids' to the pot with the marinade, mostly because I simply can't see a reason for marinading something in carrot if it's not going to be in the final product. I'm glad I left them in. While this takes a while because of cooking time, peeling the pearl onions was the only time consuming prep work. However, they are divine so don't skip them. Like many others, I marinaded the meat for 24 hours, cooked it the next day (slightly less time than called for), and reheated on the third (added a bit of water). This would also be excellent with venison.

This turned out really, really well, though my meat (maybe variances in beef?) was done before time. I wasn't able to find unsmoked bacon, so used pancetta instead. This recipe is going in my file.

Made this for a dinner party, and it was a huge hit. Next time I won't go to the trouble of preparing the pearl onions, since they pretty much dissolved by the time I served the dish, and will use sweet onions instead.

You should do fine on top of the stove look at some of the beouf bourgogne recipes.

i'm in a bind and need some guidance....hosting a dinner party for 12 in a few days and am unable to use my oven due to a door gasket in need of repair... therefore, i want to do a braised beef dish that can cook in a dutch oven on my stovetop instead of the oven. if i cook slowly, will i be able to do this dish? is there anything i need to take note of if i do it this way?

Made this for a family dinner for 12 and it was a big hit. Perfect for a dinner party as it is ideal to make ahead. I made it over the course of 3 days...put it in the marinade Wednesday, cooked it on Thursday, reheated it and served on Friday. It may be time-consuming but it is super easy and the results are worth it. Served with buttered noodles, sauteed mushrooms, and roasted fennel and carrots w/pecorino (recipe on Epicurious).

Perfect per the recipe. Leaves nothing to be desired. On a side note, I was tickled by the "partner site" that has suggested wine pairings below the recipe - not a genuine Burgundy to be found, nor any French wines at all for that matter. This needs a touch of work, no?

I made this for a very fat-conscious, low-cal friend who was somewhat skeptical of anything involved with French cuisine. Let me tell you - she said the calories were well worth it and delicious. I used an inexpensive Cote due Rhone, marinated for 2 days, and served with a lovely salad garnished with Gruyeres and it was divine. Easy, and worth every single bite. Just as a note, this makes 4-6 french-size servings, but for Americans this dish services more like 3.

Delicious! We've made this twice, both times with a relatively inexpensive Cote du Rhone, and it's fantastic. After searching several grocery stores for unsmoked bacon, we finally went to a real butcher who informed us that it's called "fat back" when the bacon is unsmoked. The first batch was made with smoked bacon though, and came out fine. As others have said, caramelizing the leftover marinade onions makes a tasty filling for cheesy melt sandwiches.

Rating: 4
Such a unbelievably richly flavored dish. We ended up using smoked bacon, despite the recipe's admonition and it still turned out wonderful. 2 of us managed to almost polish off the whole batch, it was just too good to stop. The onions and carrots from the marinade we caramelized and grilled into sandwiches a couple days later. I highly recommend caramelizing rather then just discarding.

A note to Brevity, WA: Your sarcasm was not wasted on everyone. In the grand traditions of Irma Rombauer, I give it four forks.

Wonderful recipe. I made this for our Christmas dinner. Started marinating it 2 days ahead of time, cooked it the morning of Christmas Eve and served it on Christmas day. Great flavor, easy prep, everyone loved it.

Did not use the pearl onions and served with a root vegetable gratin, not noodles. Wonderful! I'm planning to make it again and will try serving it with soft polenta.

A good alternative to bacon is not prosciutto, but rather pancetta - the unsmoked Italian version of American bacon. If you can't find pancetta, boil the bacon before using it according to the recipe instructions - it removes the smokiness.

Marvelous. I had to stop the cooking process after I added the bacon (all bacon is cured- some is smoked; check the label). Refrigerated overnight, then finished in the morning; my doubled recipe served 10 that evening, although I will triple it for that number next time.

Marvelous. Make it a day ahead; I had to stop the cooking process after I added the bacon (all bacon is cured, only some is smoked- check the label), at which point I cooled and refrigerated overnight. Finished the next morning and served that evening. I doubled the recipe for a dinner party for 10; next time I will triple the recipe for that number.

This dish is simply fantastic! Start a couple of days ahead of time. Marinate the first day, cook as directed the second and then reheat on the third and enjoy. It just keeps getting better and better. Leftovers are a must so make extra. Especially delicious with garlic mashed potatoes. I have served this with a nice California Rombauer Merlot, and it paired rather well.

Yep, the other reviewers are right on this one. Rich flavor, beautiful deep dark color, succulent... a terrific stew. Note: instead of 6 oz unsmoked bacon (where do you find this?) I used 3 oz prosciutto, then browned the onions in olive oil.

This was the perfect Superbowl Sunday meal - I bought a really nice bottle of wine that was inexpenive - a Spanish Tempranillo (sp?) and my husband and I both adored this dish - we couldn't wait for the noodles. Tonight buttered noodles with the left overs and I can't wait!

This is a wonderful dish, we feasted on it on the third day, as suggested. Will be making this often! Serves with roasted fennel, and new potatoes.

Yum! I made this exactly as written except used merlot instead of burgundy and it was an exceptional dish. This may become a Christmas Eve tradition - easy to make, very flavorful, and everyone loved it.

Is anyone else confused by "A Cook from Brevity, WA"? How could you serve this dish with jambalaya? Sounds like waaay too much Cote du Rhone was consumed...and not cooked!

Following the recipe exactly may be time-consuming but the result is very good. My partner and I found the resulting red wine sauce to be flavorful and the meat to be fork tender (we cooked an additional 45 minutes). We served this dish in bowls layered with a very small amount of buttered farfalle on the bottom. Don't skimp on the wine--the wine makes the dish and is nothing without a tasty bottle you would normally drink. This recipe is not our favorite version of beef braised in red wine, but it is very good and, except for th pearl onions, basically utilizes regularly stocked items in your kitchen. The red wine braising liquid is lexx complex and had less depth than some other recipes we have tried, but maybe that was the intent of this particular recipe.

I made this for 10 people and used 6lbs of beef and three bottles of Cote Du Rhone. The result was delicious and my guests loved it. I served it with home made spaetzle which was the perfect accompaniment. I do have some comments/tips though: - I don't think it is a dish you cook up in an evening after work for dinner the same night. It is quite time consuming. - I wondered about reserving the marinade. Was I supposed to re-use all of it including the veges? I think the intent is only to use the liquid marinade reserved sans carrots, onions, parsley etc. I made caramelised onions with the leftover marinaded onions. These turned out fabulous. - For those of you like me wondering about the parchment paper: I think the intent is to have no water/steam dilute the sauce and the parchment paper works brilliantly. Do not substitute a lid for it. I made mine a day in advance and reheated it gently in the oven. It was indeed delicious and I'm enjoying left-overs:)

Delicious and worth the effort. Be sure to make it a couple days ahead. Our French friends LOVED it, too!

This was really delicious and easy to prepare. I marinated the beef 24 hours, browned the beef on the stove and then finished the cooking in the slow cooker for 8 hours on low; I added the onions at the end. In the future I would reduce the cooking time -- the beef was falling apart. Even though I served the next day, I didn't have any fat to skim off of the top ... maybe because I used grass fed beef? I hate wasting stuff, so I went ahead and poured all of the solids (except the herbs) into the slow cooker. The extra onions thickened the dish nicely and pretty much disintegrated during cooking.

I thought that this was a very good version of a classic Beef Burgundy. I love the step of browning the pearl onions in the bacon pan and then deglazing the pan, which adds a lot of extra flavor. One thing I think I'd do next time, though, is cut down on the amount of bacon slightly. Because of the amount of bacon in this dish it's worth making ahead so you can cool and skim the fat off the surface before reheating and serving.

I hesitated between two and three forks and between making it again or not. This was a very rich, tasty and decadent stewed beef dish. It absolutely needs the onions and egg noodles, however, to break it up a little. And consider serving it with a salad to lighten ever so slightly. It took a lot longer than I expected to cook-- it seemed like every step took a while and since I was trying to do it after work it ended up spanning several evenings.

I"d say it was pretty darn good. The beef was very marinated and wine potent since I had marinated it for 24 hours. Very good, would make it again.
