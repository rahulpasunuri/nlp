I did not have fresh oregano so I used fresh rosemary and dried basil. I also added some raw large shrimp with the mussels. My wife said that I could cook that again anytime.

added the wine and red pepper flakes as suggested and it was wonderful!. . . and so fast, perfect weekday dinner. . . crusty bread is an absolute must. next time i might blend the tomatoes first for more of a thick tomato sauce effect, but that's just a personal pref.

yummy! not a huge fan of the tomato chunks in the sauce, so might blend them first next time. also, the wine, pepper flakes and crusty bread are a must. plus a salad makes a great meal!

White wine and red pepper flakes make the dish sing. Fast, easy, delicious - ciabatta and sops up the sauce nicely.

Used 2lbs mussels to serve 3. Excellent. Having a crusty bread to sop up the sauce is essential. Unlike other reviewers, non-mussel fans were not enthusiastic.

I added red pepper flakes and a touch of white wine. It was fantastic. Have alot of crusty bread nearby to mop up the wonderful sauce.

Excellent- I'm a big mussel fan so made with 2 lbs. instead of 1- I made side plate of mussles/sauce and dipped bread... I would put a little less tomato paste- but otherwise De-Lish!

My husband and I loved this recipe. I added white wine, garlic and red pepper flakes to the sauce to give it a little more flavor and used two pounds of mussels. Perfect!

What a simple, easily prepared dish that was delicious. I also used canned baby clams and 1 28 oz. crushed tomatoes instead of the diced tomatoes and it came out great. This recipe is a keeper.

I used dry spices instead of fresh ones and found this dish to be delicious. I loved even more that it took barely 15 minutes!

I substituted a can of baby clams for the mussels and pureed most of the tomato pieces. Goes great with a mushroomy Chilean Merlot. Will definitely make again.
