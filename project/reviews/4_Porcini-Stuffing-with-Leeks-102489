This is a family favorite. We make this every year to rave reviews. We dig it out of the archives each and everything thanksgiving since it was originally in BA.

I have made this stuffing every year since 1999. It gets rave reviews each time. A lot of work, but worth the effort.

I made this dish for Thanksgiving and it was very flavorful. Everyone raved. I used three loaves (3 pounds) of challah, which is more bread than the recipe calls for but I needed alot of stuffing. I also used only two eggs, as I don't like stuffing with alot of binder. I baked it in a roasting pan and it was delicous. I can't imagine what this recipe would be like with only one pound of bread since it was so flavorful and moist with more bread.

Labor intensive but worth the work! I made it twice and both times to rave reviews. Very rich and intense flavors.

I made this with vegtable broth instead of chicken stock, but that didn't seem to make a difference. It was very popular at Thanksgiving.
