We skipped on the sugar but used ice cream instead of frozen yogurt and served this like a parfait. It was a hit- YUMMY, esp with berries in season.

I LOVED IT! Its a healthy, tasty nutritious treat. I prefer less sugar, but it was great. I like to keep it in the fridge and eat it as a healthy breakfast.

O.K. as usual, i had to do mine a bit differently. instead of sundaes i did shakes for the kids as a School's out for the summer treat--and they were too tasty. We used the blender instead of the food processor. I halved the proportions to make only three. The only thing i would change is not as much confectionsers sugar they weren't too sweet but I would have preferred a little less. Our trashman came by while we were outside enjoying them and we offered him some and he said it the best thing he'd ever had!! ***Caution, they are a bit expensive to make as to buy all the berries at the market and the yogurt, I spent $18 which is about $5.75 for each shake! Yikes. But as a mom trying to get her kids to consume more fresh items and less prepackaged preserved processed foods I think its fine once and a while.
