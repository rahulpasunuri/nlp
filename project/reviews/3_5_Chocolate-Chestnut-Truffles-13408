Pecans instead of marrons glaces? It's probably lovely, but it's not the same recipe at all. For any readers who are tempted to just throw in another type of nut in place of chestnuts, be warned that they're not at all similar to each other. And if you get the chance, try the real thing!

Very good - I too used pecans instead of chestnuts - they were divine! (notice I said WERE!) ;->

Absolutely mouyh-watering! Great for the chocolate lover. We used callebaut chocolate and substituted chopped pecans for the chestnuts.
