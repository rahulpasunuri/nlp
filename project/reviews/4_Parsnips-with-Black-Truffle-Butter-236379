Simple and delicious, of course, most dishes with truffle butter are hard not to enjoy! The only change I made was boiling the parsnips in chicken stock, which I had used to poach some chicken for my main. As to the other reviewer's issues, 4-5 minutes should be plenty so long as you have not included the woody cores of thicker parsnips.

1. Make sure the parsnips are tender, even if it takes longer than the 4-5 minutes. Even after 7 minutes, mine weren't done (done is creamy). Being inexperienced with parsnips, I didn't know any better and served them anyway. Though guests commented on their delicious and interesting flavor, very few were eaten. I roasted and served the left-overs tonight and, after roasting, they were fabulous and devoured.

This was so easy -so delicious- so decadent! We bought truffle-butter from Surfas in LA and gave it six thumbs up. What a fab treatment for the humble parnsip.
