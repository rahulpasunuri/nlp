This dish is really gross. If you have ever seen a mystery thing bubbling in a crockpot at a work potluck - it tastes like that. It is basically a sweet barb-que sauce with hot dogs in it, if you are into that kind of thing. The lime sauce is also sweet & gloopy and does not go with the sweet sticky sausages!

Made these for NYE and the are excellent and were gone in no time. The sauce is a must as it really compliments the sausages. I marinated the sausages overnight.

This was really not good. The sauce was very peculiar. The sausages were okay but there has got to be a better use for them in a different recipe.

Excellent recipe. Made these for the superbowl and they went fast! Did not use the dipping sauce, and honestly I don't think you even need it. They stand up very well on their own.

I thought these were OK, but not great. I think the dipping sauce would have better being made from a spicy/sweet mustard. The mayonnaise mixed with the mango chutney was not my cup of tea.

4 forks for the sausages, 2 for the dipping sauce. You might only want to make half the recipe of the dipping sauce as the sausages were popular on their own.

If little smokies are your guilty pleasure, you'll love this recipe! Classic tangy barbeque cocktail sausages dipped in an elegant and exotic sauce that elevates this unsophisticated appetizer into a gourmet delight. I'm making this for my friends for Superbowl Sunday tomorrow!

I made these for our office Christmas party and they were delicious. The mango chutney dipping sauce didn't go over that well. Possibly, a different group of people would like it. I would try making the sauce again and see if I got different results.

Unfussy and addictive is how I would describe these sausages. We added a little more hot sauce though. I agree the sausages don't need the dipping sauce. But it's a really great chutney sauce. I think I'm going to use it to make Chicken salad.

I love this recipe, I have been making it for years and it is sooo easy. I have cooked it ahead of time the night before and rewarmed in the microwave for office parties but it is best straight from the oven. The mango sauce adds a sophisticated flavor, I serve it with and without depending on the crowd - cut the recipe in half if you do make it and make it a day ahead.

People may sniff at cocktail sausages, but this recipe dresses them up nicely, and it was the first thing to go at the hors d'oevres table. Men especially seemed to like something a little less foofy. If you live near a Costco, try the Aidells mini Chicken Apple Sausages with this recipe. The dipping sauce was a little too mayonaissey for me, even with extra chutney and lime juice. Next time, I would use the Apricot Dipping Sauce also on this site and use one tablespoon less ketchup in the basting sauce. But overall, I really liked it.

I enjoyed this dish, but I think the barbecue sauce flavor overwhelms that of the dipping sauce, especially while the sausages are still hot. As per previous reviewers, I will try the dipping sauce with cooked shrimp.

We made the sauce as a dip for shrimp and it was absolutely fabulous! So my rating of four forks was in this context -- we did not make the sausage. Whip this up and grab some cold shrimp -- unbeatable and simple but elegant appetizer!

Very good and tasty. Great party appetizer--but would probably make just the sausages next time. Really liked the dipping sauce (recipe made a lot more than needed for 50 sausages), but thought it better with Jamaican Jerk Chicken Wings.

This is a 3 1/2 Forker. I made these for a party and they were a big hit. Everyone loved the sausages, however, one person didn't like the chutney sauce with them. I loved both the cocktail sausages and chutney sauce. Try them...they are easy to make plus you and your guests won't be disappointed!

Unbelievably good! Whenever I ask my husband what to make for a party - the answer is these! I've been making them for more than 4 years, and they are still as good as the first day we tried them. They are easy, can be prepared ahead of time, and the house smells great when people arrive.

Interesting combination of flavors.I thought the lime dipping sauce would be great with crudites, crustini, as an interesting meat glaze. While I'm NOT a cocktail sausage fan....this recipe might make me reconsider.

absolutely wonderful. I have made this dozens of times for dinner party appetizers, cocktail parties, barbeque munchies, you name it. It is a success everytime - I never have any leftover!!! Its the best!

While the chutney sauce was good (a little delicate) and ample--more than enough for 100 sausages--and the chicken nuggets alongside--my tailgate party found the "deviled" sausage coating delicious and adequate all by itself.

Made this recipe for a Super Bowl party yesterday. I didn't reveal the sauce ingredients until everyone had tried it, fearing no one would want to try something that contained Chutney. No complaints! Everyone loved the combination of tangy/sweet with the sausages. We are all spicy food fans so I used Spicy Mango Chutney and Spicy All Beef Sausages.

The Mango dipping sauce is greeat, and really carries this dish. If you are only using this sauce for the 50 cocktail sausages, you will have more than enough sauce.

This recipe was very simple, and it was the first appetizer GONE from the buffet. The dipping sauce was plentiful. You won't need half. I'll defiitely make this again when I need a quick and tasty crowd-pleaser.

This recipe was a huge hit with my guests. I used precooked, sliced Bradley Ogden chicken sausages (any brand of high quality, pre-cooked sausage will do, but if you can get Bradley Ogden's they are sensational). Just as easy as the original recipe but gets around the tasteless cocktail sausage ingredient.

This was hard to rate because I hated the sausages, but loved the chutney lime sauce. I also made Curried Beef Puffs (from this site) and this sauce goes wonderfully with the Puffs. On the sauce I omited the lime peel and used 1 cup mayo. Try the Curried Beef Puffs with the chutney lime sauce and yum yum.

This recipe is a regular at my annual cocktail/appetizer party. I usually double the recipe, and they still disappear immediately. I highly recommend them as a good dress-up of an old favorite (add champagne/white wine vinegar to the chutney sauce for an interesting salad dressing on spinach or romaine).

I am a caterer and a cooking class instructor and I never thought I would serve smokey joes in such a concoction. Well, I tried it on my daughter's behalf and have been hooked ever since. These are much better than you can imagine. I happen to love the sauce too.

I give ths recipe a 3.5. We've had friends over for New Year's eve for the last two years and have served it both times. I'm making it again this year. It's always a success (although the mango sauce is barely touched) and a great update on a nostalgic dish.

The flavors of the cool mango and lime and the spicy sauce complemeted each other perfectly. The only problem I had was that I ran out early in the party I made them for! What a wonderful alternative to boring old cocktail sausages in barbeque sauce! I loved it!
