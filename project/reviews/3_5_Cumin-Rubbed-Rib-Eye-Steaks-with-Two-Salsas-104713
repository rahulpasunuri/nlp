This was yummy and easy. I too grilled mine. Be generous with the cumin. As some others suggested, I combined the salsas. The flavor was a little bland and had to add lots of S&P. Next time I might also add a splash of low sodium soy sauce. That's an ingredient in a more traditional salsa I make so it might be just what is needed.

Simple and tasty way to cook the ribeye. The salsas were good, but very similar. Next time, I'll probably combine the salsas.

This dish was excellent! The flavors complimented one another without any one being too overbearing. I will definitely make this one again. *I grilled the steaks instead of pan frying, everything just tastes better grilled*

I would make this recipe again - but for my husband and my son who like things really hot! Myself, I could stand it but it was a little "hotter" than I am comfortable with.

I have made this twice...for different groups of people. Everyone, myself included, loved it. While we all seemed to prefer the green sauce, both were well worth the effort. I served it with the polano-roasted mashed potatoes and caesar salad with a bit of chipotle in the dressing. Yum.

My all time favourite! I tried it first a year ago, and absolutely love it!

kick ass. it's been about a year since i've made this, but i remember thinking it was delicious. i also remember, there wasn't much reason to keep the salsas separate. i'm making it again tonight.
