I suspect Charles' quirky "unwrappers" were the crisp spring roll skins which require a quick dip in water in order to become soft and pliable. They are most associated with fresh, not fried, spring rolls.

I have actually made this a couple times. I add a little browned ground pork to it just to make it go a bit farther.

I was completely defeated by this recipe due to the wrappers. I purchased spring roll wrappers (made in Thailand) from a Vietnamese grocery. They are wafer thin and brittle. Obviously an art to folding that requires further investigation. The filling is ok. One intriguing facet: the cost of the dish is virtually nil. Probably needs a dip, though.
