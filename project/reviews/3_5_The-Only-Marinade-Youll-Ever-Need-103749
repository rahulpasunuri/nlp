This marinade is delightfully fresh. I found it a bit too tart so I added a bit of turbanado sugar to balance it out. Scrumptious!

Delicious! Light, fresh, great for chicken and for veggies. I added a diced onion and a tablespoon of raw sugar (turbinado)to even out the taste. The end result was surprisingly flavorful for such a simple marinade. Delicious!

a classic marinade, not over powering, very subtitle and subdued but with remarkable notes of flavor. a note to the preparer: fresh garlic is a must. if you think you can get away with crushed prepared garlic you will be disappointed.

I add 1 tablespoon balsamic and a scoop of Dijon mustard for more zip and complexity, whisk til creamy, then use as a marinade atop grilled veges (zucchini, portabello mushrooms, Japanese egglplant, etc.) as well as for meat - try slathering a bit on salmon before covering with lemons and BBQing in foil. Delicious.

This is an exceptional marinade. I've used it twice now on the BBQ, once on sirloin steaks and again on chicken drumsticks. The steaks were perfectly tenderized and the chicken was crispy and juicy. So quick and easy to make with whatever herbs you have on hand - and best of all DELICIOUS results - that I'll definitely be making this over and over again.

Best damn piece of chicken I've ever had, and I've had lots of pieces of chicken. Four forks.

My family and our guests enjoyed this marinade on chicken and veggies that we grilled. One of our guests had a wheat allergy, and I had a difficult time finding a store bought marinade that didn't contain wheat. So I found this recipe and it was delicious! Nonetheless, my husband is from Nigeria and prefers bolder flavors -- this one is very light, summery, and wonderful, but not our all time favorite.

this is a wonderful change from the usual marinades that I use. This is very light, summery, and Mediterranean. I use a little extra lemon zest and lemon juice. It's excellent with chicken.

I love this marinade!! It's very versatile depending on what you are cooking and what herbs are handy. I sometimes use lime juice and zest with lots of cilantro and basil. FABULOUS!!!!

I've been making this for over a year. I use it mostly on chicken breasts. I have an herb garden, so I grab parsley...and normally basil, oregano and rosemary. Whatever needs cutting! I have a Food Saver and use the marinating container. In just 1/2 hour it tastes like it's been marinating for hours.

We have used the marinade for over a year now. It is delicious and light. Our favorite use it to marinade a chicken breast, then grill it, and cut it up for chicken caesar salads.

This is an average marinade, similar to one I've used in the past. I marinated some boneless chicken breasts and some sirloin steaks for about three hours. The flavors didn't penetrate to the center of the meats and just lacked oomph. I looked up my other marinade and, in addition to the same ingredients for the Epicurious marinade, it calls for 1/2 c soy sauce, 2 T Worcestershire, 1 T dry mustard, and 1/4 c wine vinegar. I'll stick with the more flavorful one, even though it involves a bit more work.

Made this for chicken breasts and it was delicious. Definitely a taste of summer. Would make it again

thought it was a very good recipe. i recommend adding extra spices to it. my husband loved the lemon, but preferred extra salt. had already added extra salt, pepper, and threw in a touch of cayenne. we used it with chicken breasts. overall, would definitely use it again.

This was delicious and I will be making it again. However, I may have gotten the proportions wrong because the red pepper overpowered the other tastes. We don't mind hot pepper, but I was hoping to be able to taste more of the basil, oregano, and garlic.

This was great. I used it on chicken and the only problem I had was that it was a bit salty but I think that's because I couldn't get my salt to dissolve. Next time I'll use a little less salt then I think it'll deserve 4 forks.

This is a great recipe! I mixed up a double batch. I used half to marinate strip steaks, and the other half as a dressing for a spinach, bacon, red onion and swiss cheese salad. I was asked for seconds on the salad. Honestly...who asks for seconds on a salad? I cooked the steak on the grill and the flavor was out of this world. The best part was that, with the ingredients on hand, this takes no longer than 5 minutes to make. I just might start trying this on all sorts of things. You can't beat the taste of fresh ingredients and it is such a wonderful change from the typical vinegrette dressings. I wish I had discovered this marinade/dressing 30 years ago.

EXCELLENT! Very BRIGHT flavor. I used it on lamb steaks that I grilled. I was also roasting some fresh oyster in the shell and said to myself.....I wonder if...... yup - was great spooned on the oysters as well.

Okay, ya'll. If you need more flavor, you have to salt the meat or chicken, too. Made with fresh ingredients, this marinade is delicious! We tried it with chicken tenders, grilled them, and they were excellent. Gorgeous color with flecks of the herb mixture. Leftovers on a salad tomorrow for lunch. Yum!

I used this on pork chops, and only marinaded it for about 2 hours, but the flavor was great!! The pepper flakes added a nice zip, and the freshness of the herbs was really different. I'll be using it on skirt steaks next.

Definetly invest in the fresh herbs. Cilantro is a must and gives the marinade its kick. I've only triedit on grilled steaks so far, can't wait to use it on chicken.

It really is the only marinade you'll ever need! To the "cook" of June 2003: how can you possibly judge a marinade if you leave out a substantial amount of the ingredients?? Sheesh! Quit yer complaining and make the recipe AS IS. Then evaluate.

I have used this marinade on grilled beef and grilled chicken. I always use as many or the four herbs as possible from the garden, oregano, dill, cilantro, and basil as well as the flat leaf parsley. It is excellent!

This marinade has become a staple in our household. I buy enough ingredients to make it twice in one week; once for red meat, and once for chicken. I usually add more lemon & salt for the chicken BBQ. It's a keeper!

Unfortunately, we were out of all fresh herbs but cilantro. We used that, and thought the recipe was unexciting. Used it for chicken breasts, which picked up a nice lemony flavor, but not much else.

I love this marinade and have made it at every opportunity. I have lots of fresh herbs and find that fine parsley with oneothe flavor works best. It is the red pepper appearring in certain bites that is the surprise. O used chicken tenders cut up and then used as shish kebobs with cherry tomatoes,onion and zucchini cooked over charcoal(throw all the veggies into the marinade too. Serve over brown rice. Delicious.

I used my version of this recipe on both chicken breast and steak for a dinner party my husband and I had this past weekend. The chicken was very nice, but the steak was great! The flavour of the marinade was complimentary, rather than overpowering like many BBQ sauces. I'm looking forward to trying it on some pork tenderloin tomorrow.

This was very, very good. I only had fresh basil and cilantro and used dried parsley and oregano and it came out great. We used it on boneless, skinless chicken breasts, only marinated for about an hour and my husband couldn't stop raving. Will definately make this again.

I made this recipe for two reasons: 1)I had fresh cilantro and dill on hand and 2)Is it really the only marinade... The answer is YES! Great flavor and the chicken was tender, moist and juicy! I did 5lbs of legs on a gas grill. I marinated them for 1 1/2 hrs at room temp. They are AWESOME! Don't take my word for it though. Try it yourself!

zesty! we used this on mixed seafood and salmon, and thinly-sliced veggies like zucchini and japanese eggplant. my only question was how long to marinate each type of food;the recipe omits this detail. otherwise, it was very good & everyone ate every last bite!

I was really in a pinch, so I used dried herbs instead of the fresh ones. I cooked the chicken on 'the foreman' and we thought it was quite tasty. We will definately use this again but with the fresh ingredients.

Splendid yet simple. I marinated some chicken breasts for only 1/2 an hour before barbequing, yet, in this time, the flavour had adequately penetrated the meat. Ingredients are common enough to have on hand.

Excellent for those of us who typically forget to marinate until the last minute. An hour on chicken k-bobs was perfect. Excellent for grilling vegetables - patty pan squash, zucchini and roma tomato halves. A definite keeper.

Well, I think the title just might be accurate! I was skeptical at how this would taste with beef, but it was great! We used prime sirloin steaks and grilled them-just wonderful! I used fresh basil from the garden chopped fine....I can't wait to try it with chicken breasts.

Rating: 3
Wonderful marinade! I primarly used cilantro as I did not have parsley and used it on salmon. I marinated it for 1 hour and that was sufficent. It had a clean wonderful taste that would also be good on chicken. The only way this would work for beef or pork is to increase the hot pepper flakes and black pepper and maybe the garlic to give it a more assertive taste. This will not be the "Only Marinade I'll Ever Need" but will be one that I will use alot. P.S. If you are looking for a good book on grilling, Steven Raichlen's books are excellent and very informative

I was skeptical of anything named "The Only Marinade You Will Ever Need". However, this recipe has quickly replaced my other marinades for grilling. I have used on chicken, swordfish, steak tips, and a pork tenderloin and have had rave reviews every time. It is amazing how the flavor changes with the different meat. This is a keeper for sure.

I was looking for a good beef marinade for a 5lb eye of round and I researched many recipes. I came across this one and it sounded good, I never made an herbal type marinade. I made the mixture and rubbed it all over, let it sit for six hours, preheated the oven at 450, put in the roast(let it gain room temp) drop the temp down to 325, took it out at 120 deg, let it cool, sliced it up and " wow" the nicest shade of red, so juicy and the flavor? Well it was awesome,I just added more garlic for my liking, try it.
