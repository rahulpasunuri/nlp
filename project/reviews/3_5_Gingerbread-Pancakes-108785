I plan on making this on Sunday to try them out! Does anybody know the nutritional facts for these though?

as one in love with zazie's gingerbread pancakes (in san francisco), i have a pretty high standard, but was still hoping these would be somewhere in the ballpark. the flavor, while mild, was good, but i agree that the pancakes themselves are a bit dry/tough. i followed the recipe to the letter except for halving it. served them with poached pears, lemon curd, and real maple syrup. without the lubrication they would have been tough to get down. also the vegetable oil flavor was a tinge strange (used to butter, but it would take some careful calibration of heat to use butter, since these do require longer cooking than runnier batters). i might try again with a higher liquid-to-dry-ingredients ratio, but will first seek out a recipe that's better balanced from the get-go.

Followed recipe exactly except for the brown sugar I used sucanat (sugar that still has the molasses in it providing better nutrtion than your other sugars). Made enough panacakes for three of us for dinner with leftovers for the next mornings pancake sanwhiches. My advice is to pour your pancakes on the griddle smaller than normal because they grow as the batter is thick. Will for sure make again. Thanks for posting!

The remarks at the beginning of the recipe says, "they are cake like." The batter will be thick for a cake like pancake. The reviewers who change the ingredients then give a low fork rating are not really rating the origional recipe. Hope that people will give it a try even if it does not have 4 forks and has an 84% user rating.

Loved this recipe. It makes light and fluffy pancakes with a great spicy flavor, but not too overwhelming.

Happy Christmas! This recipe was pretty delicious, but I made some serious alterations. I made a 1/2 recipe and it served 4 adults no problem. That was a lot of pancake batter. Also, when I first whipped it up, the consistency was way too thick (appx a quickbread thickness- not good for a quick, light pancake) so I quadrupled the amount of coffee I put in and it was much more like pancake batter. I also doubled the amount of cinnamon and ginger because I like a spicy gingerbread. They were light as air and very, very flavorful. Although they were really good, they were also really sugary, so this is definitely a once-yearly kind of recipe for me. We ate them with vanilla yogurt on top. Thanks!

I made this recipe for a Saturday morning Christmas party and all were very pleased. I used half whole wheat and half white flour, which suited this recipe well. For topping, I whipped some cream with vanilla and nutmeg. Everyone had seconds and I plan on making them again.

I am not a fan of the recipe at all. I make pancakes from scratch regularly; my go-to recipe is from Joy of Cooking and it is amazing. These pancakes were too cakey, it could be because I overmixed the batter but I had to add about a cup extra milk b/c it was super thick. You need a runny batter for really good pancakes in my opinion. I also halved the recipe and still had a ton of batter left over after I made 4 huge pancakes. Overall disappointing.

Flavor was good, but disappointed with the puffy breadiness. Not just a matter of thinning out the batter, it seems. Something in the recipe makes inflates and breadifies them way beyond what a pancake should be. Won't make these again.

these were wonderful. We couldn't stop eating them..they were a little hard to cook in the middle so i lowered the heat to cook slower. Second time i used buttermilk instead of water. even better.

Rating: 4
Super recipe, but I added 1/4 C molasses and reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 C. Since these are very thick, I cooked them on a much lower heat than regular pancakes so they would cook through without burning. After the first batch, I added water to thin them, and they were still delicious. It brought me back to PennyClou's in Vermont. I'll make these for Christmas morning.

I added coconut milk and unsweetened coconut instead of water and OJ instead of lemon juice and this recipe was great!

Merry Xmas as I made this THIS morning.. Took in many of the reviewers advisos and halved the recipe keeping amount of spices, water/coffee the same. Thinned batter exactly to a consistency I like and produced a pancake we loved. Had only light brown sugar, so they may have been lighter (in color and density) than had dark brown been on hand, but was still thrilled with the result. Agree with many that spice tones could be intensified, and will play with that on the next pass. Will also toy with molasses which gives 'real' gingerbread its' unique properties. All in all a very satisfying first attempt and I will absolutely be making these on a more regular trying to duplicate the great Gingerbread Pancakes at The Pennyclose in Burlington, VT.

I subbed buttermilk for the coffee and water and had great results. These were tasty, especially with pears and lemon curd.

An added note, I served them with poached pears just like I had them at La Note.

This is the first time I have writen a review. We had them at La Note Restaurant in Berkley, went home and looked up gingerbread pancakes to try and duplicate the recipe for my grandchildren. They loved them and so did I!

Rating: 4
These were brilliant; possibly some of the best pancakes I've ever made. I halved the recipe. The only change I made was to separate the eggs: I beat the egg whites to soft peaks and then folded them into the batter. This lightened up the batter and gave the pancakes an airier quality. My whole family was impressed.

I accidentally forgot the sugar! And they were still delicious, just a little dry. Makes me think they can easily be adapted for sugar/health conscious eaters...

Was looking for a special pancake recipe and found it. I made it exactly to the recipe and the fluffy pancakes were a hit... and not too sweet with just a little butter or some strawberry jam. I'll pull this recipe out for myself or to wow guests for part of a special breakfast.

With a few minor changes, I found these pancakes to be delicious. The batter was too thick for me, so I added ~1/4-1/2 c buttermilk. I also doubled all of the spices. In a bizarre cooking accident, I made a recipe with 1 tsp mustard (dry) --- and actually liked the subtle change!

Rating: 2
We made these pancakes exactly as written. They had an excellent flavor, and were quick and easy to mix up. They were, however, very difficult to work with. They also tended to burn easily probably due to the thick batter. I was going to make these for the kids on Christmas morning, but after making them today, I'll look for something else.

Rating: 4
Amazing. A perfect holiday treat. After making these for my room mate, I called up my parents and volunteered to make them Christmas morning for the whole family. I added half again the amount of spices, substituted canola oil for the butter, and two cups of the flour were whole wheat instead of white. I also only had liquid egg whites on hand so I used the equivelent amount of those instead of whole egg. Yes, the batter is irritatingly thick and rather difficult to work with, but I loved the cakey result and will NOT water it down; it worked out fine the way it was.

These were delicious! I added a half amount more of each spice and had to use instant Suisse Mocha International Foods coffee. I thought the thickness of the batter was perfect and made for cake-like pancakes. The batter got thinner as I got toward the bottom of the bowl. I'll definitely make these again since they were so tasty and easy to make!

Rating: 3
Our whole family, ages 3 to 43, loved these. I exactly halved the ingredients which made plenty for four of us. The only substitution I made was canola oil for the melted butter and my batter consistency was just right after it rested. With oil in the batter there was no need to grease the griddle.

Rating: 3
I thought these were extremely good, and they use ingredients one often has on hand already. The flavor was subtle, the texture was fantastic, and they go great with raspberries. It would be four forks except that based on other reviews, I used a lot of extra water, as well as a little extra coffee, lemon juice, and egg. The batter was definitely too thick otherwise.

Delicious--a Sat. morning & I got the urge for pancakes, but something different. Cut this recipe in half except for spices; reduced the sugar and added molasses (upped the other wet ingredients slightly), and mixed in chopped, toasted pecans. Ate/served with maple syrup--perfection!

Rating: 3
Wow. Super bready -- a little too bready for my taste. In my rush, I didn't read other reviews. Next time, I'll halve the flour, or just increase the liquid. (Love that this recipies includes coffee -- brilliant!) But the flavor and fragrance were excellent. A tip: the second day, pop two in the toaster, then make a breakfast sandwich with a scrambled egg and slice of jack cheese between the pancackes. Awesome!

i'm glad i read others' comments before trying this. i halved the recipe, though i kept the spice measurements and coffee/water measurements the same, expecting a lighter result with more spicy flavor. the batter was still thicker than standard pancake batter, and i don't *think* i over-mixed it, though that's possible. given all of that, i enjoyed the results. my tongue would have liked even more of a ginger kick, or else a slightly lighter cake. i will be trying this again, with some more care in mixing and perhaps a few variations on the spices. dressing it with a creamy topping would also have perked it up, i think (like the yoghurt idea from another reviewer)- honey/maple syrup didn't perk up the ginger flavor.

Theses are very, very good. If you are looking for GINGERBREAD!!, then make gingerbread! The flavor is somewhat subtle but there is no mistaking its presence. Great texture, wonderful aroma. Pefect for a fall morning weekend breakfast.

I've made these twice; the first time I followed the recipe exactly, the second time I doubled the spices and doubled the coffee (as some reviewers had suggested). This recipe just does not deliver on it's name. The pancakes are OK, but just do not scream "GINGERBREAD"!

Rating: 3
The pancakes were good but the batter looses some of its spicy flavor when it cooks. The batter is also very thick. If I tried it again I would add molasses and reduce the sugar to give them more flavor and make the batter a little more liquid. I served them with roadted peaches and that was a hit.

Outstanding! I made this for a brunch and the guests raved. I guiltily ate more than my fair share. The batter was thick. I thinned it with more water. This recipe is going into my "specialties" file.

Yum! We were looking for something a little special for Sunday brunch and these absolutely hit the spot. They are delicious - more like real gingerbread than pancakes. I think they are an easy way to impress a crowd for brunch.

Excellent pancakes. Made them for Easter brunch and my guests went nuts. The batter was very thick, so I thinned it to a "pancake batter" consistency with a little milk. I will definitely make these again-- as soon as possible!

I made these this past weekend for my boyfriend and we both loved them. Very light (both in terms of flavor and texture). Served them with homemade apple marmalade and an easy blueberry sauce (1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup water, 2 T. cornstarch and 2 cups of blueberries - cook over medium heat until thick and bubbly). Also amazingly good with maple syrup. We'll definitely make these again.

Loved these! I made just as written and served with Devonshire cream (left over from scones yesterday) and warm maple syrup. Yum! My kids loved them, my husband loved them, and my house smelled wonderful too! Will do again!

Fabulous! I used half whole wheat pastry flour for a more hearty flavor and replaced the melted butter with canola oil. The light, cake-like texture is a nice break from buttermilk pancakes. Great served with mascarpone cheese instead of butter.

We really enjoyed these pancakes - very yummy with maple syrup. I did, however, double the amount of water to make the batter a little more manageable. Even then it was still pretty thick. These had a really nice flavour though and we will definitely make them again.

I loved these soft, cake-like pancakes, with their lightly crisp edges - and I am not a pancake fan! Fantastic with maple syrup. I agree that using fresh spices improves the flavor (I grated the nutmeg right into the batter). I suggest using room-temperature eggs and other liquid ingredients, to avoid cold liquids solidifying the melted butter.

Rating: 3
I used our waffle iron to make these into waffles. Also, I only had whole wheat flour in the house, so they were nuttier and crisper on the outside than usual. Definitely works best with nice fresh spices. I served them with warmed maple syrup for myself, and for my partner who hates syrups, I had a bowl of Liberty Mediterrean Lemon Yoghurt. She dipped them into the yoghurt piece by piece. I strongly suggest trying this. The Mediterrean Yoghurt (by Liberty at least, not sure of others) is really really thick, almost like a Devonshire Cream. Fantastic with the little bit of lemon flavour in the waffles.

Rating: 4
A real winner!! Another "spice solution" is to cut sugar in half, allowing spices to shine through the sweetness. (I cut sugar at LEAST in half all the time, actually improves the intended flavor on virtually all dishes. My friends have named the practice after me!) Very enjoyable without either butter or syrup. We also would prefer a thinner cake so next time will add more 50:50 coffee:water, maybe add'l lemon juice as well.

What a great recipe for this holiday season...I poured the batter into a gingerbread pancake mold and my relatives raved all morning. As for the discrepancy in reviews to ADD MORE SPICES/NOT ADD MORE SPICES...the solution is simple. if you do not use freshly ground nutmeg or the highest quality cinnamon, or if your spices arent the freshest...you may need to double up. Otherwise...I think its great as it is and so did my nephews who bit the heads off first!

I made these for our annual tree-trimming brunch and *all* the guests raved and I had 3 requests for the recipe. I made them a little less cholesteral heavy by substituting the melted butter for canola oil, and replacing 4 large eggs with an all-natural egg white product. I served with warmed maple syrup but think that a fruit based syrup would be delicious as well.

OK this was a success the second time when made with twice the amount of fluids (double up on water, coffee & lemon juice) and double the amount of spices. Retained it's unique cake-like texture but was much more moist, thiner and tasty.

I was really disappointed in this recipe. I expected a flavorful, gingerbread-y taste, but instead the cakes were quite bland. The maple syrup I served with them overpowered any gingerbread flavor. I even tasted one without the syrup and it was so boring! After finally cooking through, the cakes were very dry. Don't waste your time on these!

I actually made half the recipe. I had to add more water because the pancakes were too thick and dense. Spices were just right. Next time I will try making the full recipe to see if this makes a difference.

Those looking for a truly good 'gingerbread-tasting' pancake might want to try the 'pumpkin walnut flapjacks'also available on this site. Much better.

I wasn't very impressed with these pancakes. I found they were extremely thick and difficult to cook throughout. They tasted okay but I would have added more of the spices. The raspberry suggestion was terrific.

I came looking for a recipe I saw in the 11/03 Bon Appetit for Whole Wheat Gingerbread Pancakes. I remember they contained apple juice concentrate. It looks like the last reviewer used that recipe, rather than the one printed here that contains coffee. Can someone help with the list of ingredients for the "other" gingerbread pancakes?

Rating: 3
I thought these were great. I didn't have the apple juice concentrate, so I used about 1 1/2 cups of unsweetned applesauce plus about a quarter cup of sugar. They came out thick and fluffy. Also, I sub-ed a sprinkle of allspice for the cloves, and used a mix of all purpose and whole wheat flour (mostly whole wheat). The apple butter is great on these, especially with the maple syrup. Very quick to make, too.

I made these one Saturday morning for my two boys and husband. They were really well-received. They taste so yummy that I felt a bit guilty eating them at 8:00 in the morning!

I very rarely send in comments on recipes, but with this one I felt compelled...it is outstanding! I served them with fresh raspberries and the 100% pure maple syrup is always a must. Wonderful!
