I really enjoy the recipe exactly as listed (and gave it 3 stars as listed). I like it even better with garlic paste sauteed in the oil just briefly before adding the greens. I've made this about 5 times since discovering the recipe a couple months ago, pairing it with quite a variety of entrees.

Sorry--I guess I am just a girl from Virginia who likes her collard greens cooked beyond the "crisp" stage. I made the recipe and even tried to jazz them up with some bacon and onions and hot pepper flakes. (as others suggested) The problem is that (I think) the flavor of collard greens is really enhanced with longer cooking than just sauteeing. My kids didn't care for this recipe either. I was determined to use my collard greens that I had not used last weekend so I tried again. On this website go to "Collard Greens with Red Onions and Bacon". The smell alone is divine. Delicious!! Now THAT is the southern way to cook collard greens. Read More http://www.epicurious.com:80/recipes/food/notes/Sauteed-Collard-Greens-108108#ixzz1oqkinYgq

I love this cooking method for Collards. If your greens are bitter add a squirt of Agave Nectar. My favorite additions are cubed Chorizo and Red Pepper Flakes.

Im accustomed to the slow-cooked collards version. But I was willing to give this a try. I added onions, garlic, and red pepper& but 3 minutes just didnt do it. Another reviewer mentioned the difference between younger and older leaves. That may be the key& I had older leaves& but I ended up cooking the greens for at least 40 minutes& even though sliced sliver thin  they are still cooking  just to get rid of the natural bitterness of the greens. Would I do this again? Hell to the no.

If you have tender collards, not a lot of time, and no ham-hock (for the traditional method) this is a good basic guide. Other reviewers' suggestions-- to add garlic, lemon, hot pepper flakes, onion, etc-- are good. I sauteed a few baby portobello mushrooms in butter, set aside, then sauteed the collards, added back the mushrooms and a shaving of parmesan. Good side dish.

I had never made collard greens before and I was really pleased to find this recipe. I find simple recipes are the best when you are working with an new ingredient. I used Ghee and a touch of garlic loved it!

Is this a recipe? Not even salt?

Quick and easy. I served these with barbecued chicken wings, blue cheese dip (the one from this site - Blue Cheese Dip with Pecans) and celery sticks. It wasn't the star of the meal (the blue cheese was and always is) but I'd certainly make it again.

Y'know, people eat collards and kale and other greens in other parts of the world too, not just the southern US. This method (it's hardly a recipe!) is closer to the Brazilian style, though that might include some onion and garlic. As another reviewer stated, collards are sweet and tender when grown in cool weather (and picked young) and can even be delicious as a salad! But they get tough and bitter when grown in hot weather and picked at a more mature state. THAT'S when you need to cook them a long time and offset the bitterness with bacon or other adjustments. Match the method to the available ingredients.

Very easy for a last minute solution. I used olive oil and threw minced garlic in to brown before adding the greens as suggested by other cooks. I did use lemon juice to dress it but also ended up sprinkling some rice vinegar on my portion as well. Yum. My kids were not fans though so I don't know that this will be a go to recipe.

it's my first time making collard greens, and I understand that usually this isn't the way they are done, but it worked great for me. I don't like heavy fatty vegetables and these fit beautifully in with trying to eat healthy and have great tasting food. I added some minced garlic to the oil before sauteing the greens and a dash of lemon juice after and they were delicious and quick.

This totally made my day, as I could grab the greens out of the fridge and have them on the plate in no time flat! Slicing them thin is so key to getting the texture right, and you know there are so many more vitamins in it because it isn't cooked to death!

Last week I revisited a quick saute of collards but wondered about using some of the very plentiful lemon grass I just harvested. I crushed a couple of hunks of lemon grass and a couple cloves of garlic in the pan to season the oil for a few moments. I removed the bits from the oil and cooked the collards - wonderful! Depending upon what time of the season - the collards may be more or less sweet. After a few frosts, they are sweeter.

I thought this recipe was great. Can be used for any type of leafy green. Saute some garlic (or not), add salt, lemon or lime and you're done. I finally found a way to cook the beautiful leafy greens I find at my local farmer's market. Way cooked collards are gone, but this is much better.

No no no no no! The way you make collard greens is to cook them for 45 minutes with bacon, a little butter and some red pepper flakes. There is no substituting the flavor. Another problem I have with this recipe is that there's no pot likker (juices left over from the cooking). What's the point of making collards if you don't get your pot likker? That's the best part. You dunk corn bread into it, and you've got a MEAL, not a side dish.

This recipe is good, quick and easy for New Year's Day with Hoppin' John, thus ensuring good luck and financial well being. I used olive oil and dressed the greens with a little lemon juice. The previous reviewer from Brooklyn - what was he or she reviewing? Boiled? Garlic? Does this person know how to read or follow instructions?

Good and healthy. It's best feature is that it's quick. I used less greens and should have boiled less time- came out soggier than I think they were supposed to. Also would sautee the garlic a little longer before putting greens in- ended up with almost-raw pieces of garlic on peoples' plates. I loved the lemon, so used extra.

I also leave on the stem, but remove the tough end. Also, I find it takes more like 3 minutes to cook them the way I like them. Splash in some good quality shoyu or tamari after a minute or so, and perhaps a bit of garlic. My teenaged son absolutely inhales collards made this way!

This was a nice quick way to make collard greens. While cooking I tossed the greens with some chile pepper flakes and some sea salt. Pretty yummy and healthy and done in no time.

the pasta-like texture was more interesting than the finished taste. having grown up on cooked down southern turnip greens, i was expecting more of a gourmet soul food flair, which was not what came out. the greens were tough even though i cooked them longer than the recipe stipulated.

im a true southerener and loved the recipe.as a true southerener you should never remove the middle stem of the collard, thats where all the sweetness is.I also add some fat such as bacon drippings for a better taste. I will cook this one again. Hilde
