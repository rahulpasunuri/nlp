You really can't go wrong with this recipe. I make it for every Christmas and then again for Valentine's Day for presents. I suggest you make it exactly how the recipe says; then try your own variations. For example, I like using matzo crackers the best (I buy them right after each Passover and stock up). I also buy candy bars (heath, today it wa butterfinger crisps) and crush them up and use them instead of walnuts. I always make two batches, one has to have shredded coconut. Another tip: since I know I am going to make these each Christmas, I stock up on Halloween candy (after halloween, to stock my supply for Christmas holidays.) Lastly, I too have had success using only 1 stick of butter.

Wowza, these are amazing! I added crushed salted cashews, which made for a perfect mixture of sweet and salty.

I made 2 versions of this, one as written and one with a sleeve of Saltines instead of graham crackers and only 1 stick of butter. The saltine version was the winner by a long shot.

Oh my gosh these are FANTASTIC! I used walnuts and I grinded them in the food processor until they were really fine, and they turned out delicious! I used a 9 by 13 metal baking dish and added 2c of choc chips instead of 1.5. Worked out really well. Also, don't worry if you have to break the crackers up to fit in the pan, they all get sucked into the toffee so the crumbs are held in the mixture.

Another 4-fork review! I stumbled on this when looking for an easy recipe for my son and I to do for a school assignment. I wasn't expecting it to be this delicious too! Like candy! Will I make it again? As soon as I buy more chocolate!

Delicious and very simple--made these for a bake sale and a teen came back at his mother's request to buy all the rest! Perfect for tucking into a Christmas cookie box...try using saltines instead of graham crackers.

I made these for a bake sale. I suggested they give samples as they taste great and more then sell themselves. My son sampled them and was impressed. I poked a knife into the crackers to create a perforation, since my warm hands would melt the chocolate. I'll definitely make these again.

Pretty good, not gourmet, but hey. Kinda like crispy magic cookie bars. Made some variations too, white choc/coconut/macadamia nuts on some, good too! Need to be kept in the fridge if warm out, so keep that in mind.

This is basically the same recipe as published in the November 1992 Bon Appetit as Natchez Cookies. Hard to go wrong with this. That recipe used 1 cup butter and 1 cup dark brown sugar, the rest the same. Yum!! And very easy. I sometimes substitute crushed pretzels for the nuts for a salty, nut-free, and less expensive version.

I've made this a few times and everyone always loves it. I've also tried it with saltines and that works great for something a bit less sweet. I like to use the salted chopped peanuts used for ice cream toppings - it adds that great salty-sweet taste.

Yes, this is easy, but it is a mess trying to break it into pieces, and I became so frustrated I wondered if it was worth it. Then I served it, and everyone went absolutely nuts like it was the best thing they had ever tasted. Just goes to show ya.

This is an amazingly easy and delicious recipe!!! I made this as a really quick last minute dessert to bring to some friends' house. I can't believe how much it tastes like Almond Roca! (My husband was in heaven as Almond Roca is his favorite candy). The batch was gone by the end of the night and I got raves left and right for these quick and easy crackers!! I will definitely make them again and again, and what a great addition to my Christmas baking!!

Can I just say how much my friends and family love this recipe?! I have been making it since it first came out in the 2003 issue and I have given out this recipe too many times to count. I do substitute toffee pieces on top instead of nuts since that seems to be the most popular with everyone. I just love how quick and easy it is and yet a novel thing to give as gifts over the holiday!

This is great but I've also made the version with Saltines and I think that one adds a nice salty taste that this one lacks, even with salted butter.

These are fabulous, but it takes about 5 minutes for the butter & sugar to caramelize; at the 1 minute mark it's still just melt-y butter & grainy sugar!

This recipe is quick, easy, and delicious. My son has a nut allergy, so I substitute crushed pretzels for the nuts and it really sends this recipe over the top---everywhere I bring it people ask for the recipe. One thing---this needs to be kept in the fridge, or else it gets soggy , plus the chocolate gets pretty soft at room temperature---do not try to bring this recipe along on a picnic or to a summer potluck, and if you give it as a gift make sure to remind the recipient to keep it in the fridge (unless they are going to eat it all right then and there, which has been known to happen!). Enjoy!

I have made this many times. It always turns out great. Kids and adults like it. It is an easy version of toffee. You can use any chocolate, white or regular, add coconut, marshmellos and/or nuts.

This is a great, low fuss recipe. I have tried many variations and the biggest hit has been using white 'chocolate' sprinkled with toasted coconut. It works best to melt the white chocolate first as it does not spread as well as dark chocolate.

I've made this recipe 3 times, and each time I've liked it more. Recently, I made it for my family reunion, and it was a total hit! My uncle likes to tease me, and when I was breaking them apart he came into the kitchen, and teasingly exclaimed "we waited an hour for these trainwreck!?".... My family has since named them "trainwreck cookies" and has requested them extremely frequently! Awesome recipe!

I've been making a very similar recipe for years, using extra dark chocolate bars, chopped, and finely chopped pecans. When these turn out really well, and I admit, they don't always-- I think humidity and the variations of 'cooking a minute or so' make a big difference--they are like a really good toffee bar.

This was okay. It was easy to make. But nothing special for the calories and fat involved.

This was good, but not great. Not so much "Carmel" graham crackers as brown sugar graham crackers. Had it been less like chunks of brown sugar I would have been more pleased. The plus is that it is DEAD EASY to make, and it was appreciated, but fell short of my expectations. Will tweak the idea to my tastes in the future.

At first I thought "how weird". I started off with a small batch in a 9x9 pan. Very easy to make, no mess. I used the microwave for the caramel. I took note and increased the salt a bit and it has a great taste. Satisfies that salt sweet craving. Excellent. A grown up taste. Our teenager loves these better than smores.

Rating: 3
These were delicious and easy-- but I craved a little more salty taste to balance the chocolate and really bring out the butteriness of the caramel. Next time I will try as other reviewers suggested and substitute saltines for graham crackers in the base, or maybe I will use salted butter and almonds instead of unsalted.

I made these for church coffee hour and they were demolished in minutes! I heard at least 2 people direct others to that particular dish as a "must-try". That said, they were a bit sweet for my taste (and I love sweets!). I remember a version of these with saltines, instead of grahams, as a base that I remember liking better. I may try that substitution next time. Glad to hear it freezes, also. These are VERY good and easy for a crowd!

I made this recipe over the weekend for my sister in law who was craving something sweet. I liked it, didn't love it. She hated it. I think if it had a different chocolate topping it would have been better. The melted chocolate chips tasted bitter to me. Loved the cookie part on the bottom though. Will make again for something fast and easy. Maybe for kid's halloween party this year.

Though this recipe isn't jaw-droppingly amazing, its versatility and ease to prepare boost it to a four-fork rating. I, too, made it in a 13X9 inch pan--college students subleasing apartments tend to lack luxuries such as large pans, a whisk, an offset spatula....I made it twice, messed around with the amounts of butter/sugar, chocolate and nuts both times, and everybody who tried it loved it. Definitely a new favorite.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe twice, once with pecans and semi sweet chocolate chips and once with almonds and milk chocolate chips, both times the recipe is delish! It is sweet and rich, like candy, but I love this recipe and so easy to make. I let the chocolate chips set on top of the caramel mixture for one minute (did not put it back in the oven) the chips melted and spread easily. I lightly pressed the nuts into the chocolate mixture. Barbara, great recipe, thank you for sharing it with us. Jan

I've been accused of being a "food snob" but this is proof: I'm not! I used chocolate graham crackers and toasted walnuts and these turned out yummy-delicious. At a dinner party last night, I watched several people (not kids, grown-ups!) reach for these again and again, hoping no one would notice. For the Weight Watchers in the crowd, they're not bad: 2 pts for 1 1.5" square. Oh: and be sure your baking sheet will fit into your freezer otherwise you'll have to transfer to something else for the freezing step.

I have been making this for years and it's always great. My mother-in-law gave me the recipe-she mixed the nuts with the caramel before pouring it over and baking. She never used chocolate, but I do! I toast the nuts, however before sprinkling them. One other note: you should try other varieties of graham crackers, i.e., oatmeal crunch and chocolate.

I've made a recipe similar to this for Passover, using matzo boards instead of graham crackers. As I recall, my recipe uses an equal amount of butter and brown sugar (3/4 cup of each, I believe). The original recipe called for a little less of both, but it's best if you have a lot of the toffee coating the crackers. That way the toffee saturates the crackers and you won't taste any dry or gritty taste. Very good and easy!

This is like quick toffee and sooo good. Brought some to work and it was gone in a flash. Great holiday candy treat. Very rich and buttery. Husband didn't like it - said it was too sweet and granular (they are crackers, I told him). One square inch piece goes a long way. Used 12oz of chocolate chips and lightly toasted walnuts. Will make every year for holiday tins.
