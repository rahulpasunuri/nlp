This was delicious-- I also spent about an hour searching for a nice, simple lamb recipe and was excited to find this one. I only had time to marinate it for 20hrs, and i used a very good Cabernet Franc. The flavor was exceptional.

Excellent! I Piqued the lamb and stuffed it with half a head of garlic. I also used a generous splash Balsamic vinegar for a little additional flavour; I also find it helps to tenderize the meat. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks!

This was my fist time cooking lamb. I used chops instead of leg. I also used a white wine (chenin blanc). It truly was "melt in your mouth" delicious.

After looking through several leg of lamb recipes, I settled on this one. Simple is sometimes best, and this recipe is very easy. I cooked the lamb on one of those rotisseries you can buy on TV for Easter dinner & it was excellent!

The lesson here: Old, classic recipes can still be the best! When I was looking for a great lamb recipe, I stopped when I found this one by James Beard. It was terrific! Easy to put together, and it smelled great as it marinated. We made mashed potatoes to go with it. Next time, I would marinate it even longer than I did--the flavor was wonderful!
