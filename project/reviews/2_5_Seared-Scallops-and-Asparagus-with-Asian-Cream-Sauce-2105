After two years using of it, I just registered with the site solely so I could give this recipe a big ole one-star review. It's so bad that I threw my perfectly good scallops in the trash rather than eat these (and I eat ANYTHING). I reread the recipe five times to make sure I didn't do anything wrong. As far as I can tell, I did it all correctly. Blech.

Not much going for this receipe. It is simple and decent, but not worthy of making again. Too many other good things to do with scallop and asparagus, both.

I didn't have the right peppercorns, but I know that the schezwan peppercorns are very spicy. So I used a combination of black peppercorns and crushed red pepper; it was too spicy. Next time I will try to get the right peppercorns. Very good though.

We made this exactly as the recipe said and loved it. It's one of my favorites! I'll definitely make it again.

We added a little fresh minced Cilantro as a garnish. It set the ginger flavor off nicely! We served it over some fresh angel hair and it was a perfect size meal. Very good and easy to prepare!

I'm afraid I didn't care for this one at all. It was way too hot (and we LOVE spicy foods) and the ginger flavor was overwhelming. I won't be making this one again.

This was a great basis for a meal - as usual I can't follow a recipe to the letter but I almost did here. I sauteed asparagus,red peppers & snow peas with some ginger & garlic tossed it with lemon-pepper linguini and topped it with the scallops & sauce for a delightful flavor & full meal. The pepper & ginger with the sake are fantastic.
