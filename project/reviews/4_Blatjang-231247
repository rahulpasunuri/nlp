This with the Bobotie recipe was amazing. The reason I gave it 3 forks instead of four, is based on what it did to my house for the next week. This stuff was pungent! My house smelled like I had doused it in vinegar and set a blaze! Thank goodness I made the whole recipe and canned it for later. Great STRONG flavor that was excellent. I also served it recently with Crostinis and Brie in place of fig confit. Worked well as an cheese plate condiment too!

This was great. I made only 1/4 of the recipe as there are just the two of us. We had it with Bobotie and Yellow Rice from this site.

Oh my goodness, is that ever delicious! I was a little confused by the two different measurements on the recipe, since I didn't know whether the ounces were in metric or imperial ounces, but what came out was a candidate for my new favorite condiment. Spicy, but not in a lingering way that overshadows the food, and with undertones of fruit and vinegar.

This was my first try at making chutney and it worked beautifully. I used apple cider vinegar and plain sugar and the family raved about it. We also use it to top cheese filled mushrooms, then grill them til the chutney caramelizes. Delicious.

I made this to go with bobotie as suggested. It is truly unique. The combination of tastes is pretty hard to describe - sweet, sour, spicy, tangy, salty. All together it makes a wonderful accompaniment to the main dish. I used kind of a mix of onion types as I was low on regular onions. So used some shallots and small red onions too. I think that made the whole concoction even more colorful and interesting. Used cider vinegar for the base.
