I paid attention to the other reviews and doubled my sauce and red chili peppers. Added some lemon grass and cilantro (from another review). It was good but prep time took me about three hours. for that it should have been better!

I thought that this recipe might be a little on the bland side, based on the proportions, so I added a little sea salt and substituted some forward for the crushed red pepper, doubling down on the amount. I definitely agree on the pop of color this dish brings to the presentation. I will be trying this again, for sure, with another tweak or two until I think I've got that fourth star. Cheers.

Followed the recipe carefully to make sure all was made in proper sequence. I find it difficult to beleive Bon Appetit and others gave this such a high rating.

This recipe was very good, but not over the top, followed the recipe as stated. I just feel it was missing something in the flavors...needed some zing of some sort. I will make again and maybe add more ginger, garlic and hot pepper flakes, but definitly a keeper. You must prep everything before starting. I placed over brown basmata rice! healthy dinner for 4 with leftovers!

Great colors and delicious, not too sweet or salty as other reviewers thought. I used tamari so maybe that made a difference. This comes together easily too.

an enjoyable weekday recipe. followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with the result. Served with jasmine rice and a dry Riesling. Will definitely make this again.

I just finished making the shrimp for my family, and they all liked it very much. I left out the pineapple, and it was still scrumptious.

Rating: 3
Followed recipe exactly. It was very very good, but the shrimp was over cooked. Big mushy disappointment. It also could use a little more heat. Next time (and I would certainly make this again), I will watch the shrimp carefully, and double the red pepper.

It's rare that I follow a recipe closely, but in this case, that's what I did...too bad. While the vegetables were crisp-tender, just as I like, there just wasn't the depth of flavor that one might desire. When I make this dish again, IF there is a next time, I think I'll add cilantro and perhaps peanuts for crunch (I did double the sauce, as everyone suggested, and was glad I did. The pepper flakes I used were thai chilis that I dried and ground; The amount of heat was fine.)

This is a very good recipe, and i will make it again. It is very similar to any "sweet and sour" recipes as others have mentioned, so if you don't like sweet Chinese food, stay away! Like others, I doubled the sauce, which probably wan't necessary. Next time, I'll do 1.5 times the sauce. Also, I added asparagus because I had some in the fridge I needed to use, and in the future I won't make without it. It added a nuttiness and crunch that was so good with it, that I don't know how it would be without it. Also, I doubled the red pepper, and there was still no bite. Next time, I'll add more, or some chile or habanero sauce.

The sauce is excellent (1st 5 ingredients). Was very please with the final product. The fresh pineapple does add a great deal of flavor. Bet you this would be great with chicken, too.

Rating: 3
This dish is healthy, balanced, and visually appealing. It is not spicy at all as written. Changes that I would make the next time would be to double the sauce except the sesame oil, add more crushed red pepper, and make sure not to overcook the shrimp. I love the combination of shrimp, fresh pineapple, and ginger. Also, make sure you prep all the ingredients before beginning the cooking process.

This is a great, easy, midweek meal. I used slightly less soy sauce that it called for the second time I made it, because i thought it was a little heavy on the soy the first time. I used regular bok choy b/c the store I was at didn't have baby. Very easy, especially with two people in the kitchen. One can be stir-frying while the other chops the next ingredient.

Rating: 3
Tasty, easy, nice presentation. Will definitely make again. Since previous reviewers seemed to think that the dish was sweet, I used pineapple juice instead of honey in the sauce, it worked just fine

Great taste!!!!! I enjoyed the combination of sweet and spicy. would make this again

EXCELLENT! Definitely double the sauce. This was quite spicy, with the addition of a thai hot pepper. I thought I could get away without adding the honey, but it needed it with all the vinegar and soy. Don't forget: hot, sour, salty, sweet .....

I thought this was pretty good...a lot of prep work for the result. My husband, however, loved it and really liked the sauce (which I doubled). Using fresh pineapple makes a difference. I also added some chopped fresh basil to the final result. I used a combo of shrimp & chicken, sliced carrots, mushrooms, & shallots--what I had on hand basically. Overall, pretty yummy but not spectacular.

Wonder dish, I took the advise of the other reviews and doubled the sauce, thank you, everyone loved the dish and had to give the recipe out to all.

Rating: 3
I really liked this, however, I didn't think it was spicy at all. It had a lot of flavor, just not that spicy. Next time I would add some fresno peppers to give it a little more zip. For those who aren't accustomed to "stir fry," make sure you have all of your ingredients chopped and prepared BEFORE you start to cook. Things go pretty quickly once you get going!

Rating: 3
I really enjoyed this dish, but I must confess to making double the amount of sauce. I think that with the recommended amount it would not have enough flavor. My husband, who is a creature of habit, even liked this and said that it was worthy of making again. I would consider making it with a chile sesame oil if a little more "bite" was desired.

I made this recipe as written, but doubled the amount of sauce. Flavors blended well together, and the variety of colors made for a visually pleasing dish. I garnished with cilantro.

FABULOUS!!! My fiance usually doesn't care for bok choy, but he ate every last bite on his plate! Try adding a litle asian garlic chili sauce (found in he asian aisle at your grocery store) The pineapple definitely makes the dish... don't even THINK of buying canned!

I loved this, despite the fact that the phone rang when I was in the middle of cooking the bok choy, and it ended up overcooked. Everyone loved it, including the kids.

My husband said this was "pretty good". I added asparagus but thought that broccoli would also be tasty. I tossed this with udon noodles but might try it with jasmine rice next time.

Made this dish last night. I don't know why the previous reviewer was disappointed, the recipe is great. All the flavors in my dish were clear and complimentary. Didn't have red pepper subbed thinly sliced carrots and added water chestnuts. We loved it. Will try fish next time instead of shrimp and add some cilantro at the end for punch.

I was oh so disappointed in this dish. I made it because 100% said they would make it again. I thought there were too many competing flavors and none of them stood out distinctly. I'm all in favor on contrasting flavors in one dish but not when they turn into one indistinguishable mush. I will definitely not make this again. I don't even think it is worth experimenting on.

Rating: 4
This recipe is by far one of the BEST off this website! I did however make a few changes: doubled the sauce,tripled the bok choy because they wilt away to almost half their original size, used orange and yellow peppers & added some asparagus and basil. Don't be afraid of the red pepper, its a great compliment to the sweet sauce.

Rating: 4
Thanks to all the other reviewers! With your suggestions, a good recipe became almost perfect! Added 1/4t Mongolian Fire Oil and an extra shake of crushed red peppers. That made it quite spicy - perfect! If you do this you will not find it bland. The vegetables: 1 regular bok choy, 2 stalks celery sliced on the diagonal, 1/2 green pepper and one package sugar snap peas. Can't imagine it without the sugar snap peas. Used chunks of regular onion instead of green onions, and liked it that way. Don't let the comparison to "restaurant sweet and sour" keep you away. This recipe is nothing like the pink goo you find on a restaurant buffet. One of the prettiest and most delicious recipes I've made!!!

I made this dish adding about 1/4 teaspoon of chili oil and snow peas as suggested by other reviewers. Both my husband and I thought this dish was marvelous! The combination of spicy and sweet flavors was perfect. My husband mentioned more than once that this recipe was a "keeper".

This is a great low-fat, one-pot meal. Although it looks like it has a lot of prep, it was quick to prepare. It is very light and fresh tasting, and the serving portions are very generous. I will definitely add this recipe to my list of regulars.

very good recipe, I made it for my family and they gobbled it up. I changed the veggies around though, using julienned carrots, celery and snow peas and no bok choy. I also added some mongolian fire oil to the sauce to spice it up a bit.

Not only quick and delicious, but BEAUTIFUL!

Great dish! I did it w/o the bok choy and used fresh pineapple which is key for flavor. It was not as spicy as I would have expected and would throw some extra red pepper and even some chili oil in next time. I also used cooked shrimp and cooked it half the time then stated in the recipe. Definitely a keeper!

Rating: 2
I wish there were a "maybe I would make this again" choice. It was good, but definately a sweet dish. If you like sweet and sour dishes in the Chinese restaurant, you definately will enjoy this one. We added more dried hot chile, but still. . .If I did it again, I'd probably add some chunks of Vidalia onion.

Rating: 4
We loved this dish!! I didn't have any bok choy, so I substituted with fresh chopped Kale (much healthier, anyway). I used canned pineapple, but used crushed instead of chunks and I added some of the juice to the soy mixture. I substituted regular, diced onion instead of the scallions. I thought it added more flavor. I'll definitely make this dish again.

Rating: 3
Unlike other reviewers, I don't find bok choy bland (not if you use baby bok choy), but we did punch the seasonings up just a hair. Amazingly, my 18 month old son gobbled it up right alongside my husband. We also tried it with tofu and that was pretty good, too.

I left out the pineapple and green onion. Added extra red pepper and garlic and served over brown rice that I had steamed in chicken broth. Next time, I will not use as much oil. Very hearty and healthy!

Loved it! I followed some of the other suggestions and substituted celery for bok choy (only because I had it) and used canned pineapple for simplicity. I doubled the crushed red pepper and added more soy sauce and garlic. I tossed it with Chinese egg noodles and it was delicious. I will definitely make this one again!

Fantastic!! Substituted celery for bok choy, added garlic salt at the end.

We really liked this dish. I served it with the Asian spinach salad and the two dished worked very nice together. I generally don't make chinese food at home, however, I will make this again. I couldn't find any bok choy so I used a ready to cook bag of fresh stir fry veggies (carrots, broccoli and sugar snap peas). The meal looked great and tasted even better. My husband thought the fresh ginger made a big difference (I sometime use the minced stuff in a jar). I think that is debatable but this meal is yummy. Enjoy.

Rating: 2
It was OK. Recipe should advise to use Large or Jumbo Shrimp, and higher heat, medium on my stove is much too low. Doubled the crushed red pepper- which gave heat, but the Bok Choy has less flavor than celery- which rendered it overall somewhat bland despite the ginger and garlic. Served with asian beer and avacado slices with soy sauce.

In celebration of Chinese New Year, we made this last night along with the Oriental Spinach Salad on this website. The salad stole the show, but we also really enjoyed the stir-fry. We increased the crushed red peppers and would do so again.

I followed the recipe exactly and would make these suggestions. Add more soy sauce, or add salt. I was not too happy with the baby bok choy results. I think it would be better to keep the baby bok choy whole, and serve it on the side. Overall, the dish is good but needs some tweaking. I would suggest adding some fresh cilantro to boost the flavor. Or using coconut milk base for the sauce. Presentation wise, top marks.

I am the loser this time -- Don't get me wrong, it was good and we even ate the leftovers (they were even better)....it just wasn't as spicy as I had anticipated (I will have to follow the suggestions below..thanks).

We loved this dish. I didn't have red pepper so I just used lots of cracked fresh mixed peppercorns. Used pork tenderloin cut in small pieces instead of shrimp. Fresh pineapple makes a huge difference. Served it with sticky sushi rice. Loved it!

yum! i used hot sesame oil and doubled the red pepper. no baby bok choy in my hood, so i used one large head, but would have preferred more green. this was as good as any carry-out i've had. will do again soon.

I made this last night for my husband and he devoured it. It's not spicy at all. If you'd like to add heat try substituting hot pepper oil or mongolian fire oil for the veg and sesame oils. I thawed frozen, raw cleaned shrimp to save time and used bottled sliced ginger instead of the fresh.

Rating: 3
What fun. I love to stir fry! I kicked it up a notch and used A LOT more crushed red pepper - about 2-3 teaspoons - and thought the spice was just right with that amount. I used prepared shrimp to save time - shelled, deveined, and frozen. This dish was great. I would definitely make it again - maybe next week.

Rating: 3
This recipe was very flavorful. Next time, though, I'd probably reduce the amount of sesame oil slightly and double the crushed red pepper. I didn't find the dish very spicy at all. Also, it was quite time consuming to make - with shelling and cleaning shrimp, chopping the ginger and garlic, and slicing the peppers and bok choy -- 2 hours total from start to sitting at the table.
