I used this recipe as a base and added Sherry to glaze the pan and then to get the consistency I wanted with my sauce. I also squirted in, oh, a tablespoon of Dijon and a tablespoon of honey. Delicious!! I didn't overcook the pork, just put the lid on and checked with a thermometer until the chops were done. I let them rest for a few while I finished up the sauce with butter and mashed the figs a bit more.

I make this with a pork loin, I brown the loin in the pan and then transfer it to the oven and roast. When I do the compote, I add some fig spread or apricot marmalade and squash the figs down with a fork. I also add fresh thyme. It's a really good recipe but you have to work it a little!

Very disappointing. I love all of these ingredients! But something wasn't right...I couldn't taste any ginger. And the lemon was overpowering and unpleasant. I want to give this another chance, so I'd double the ginger, half the lemon, and add quite a bit of salt and pepper. As other reviewers suggested, reduce the cooking time for the pork unless it's a particularly thick chop.

This was a lovely dish and simple! I took the advice from the other reviewers-doubled the liquids and cooked it slower over a lower temp. Will be making this again!

The pork was tough and there is not much compote. Not worth the effort. I followed this recipe exactly and tried not to let the pork over cook.

delicious sauce - the pork was a little chewy.

The compote tasted good, however, the pork was very tough. I might try it again cooking the pork and compote seperately.

I've made this twice and enjoyed it both times. The second time I didn't have any figs, so I threw in a couple of tablespoons of apricot preserves for that sweet/tart tang. It was better than the figs.

Served this with squash and broccoli with ginger butter (also on your website)--yum. My chops were slightly thicker than called for, so I actually seared them for 3 minutes on each side and simmered for 15 minutes and they came out perfectly. A different, but delicious, combination, and relatively simple.

This was a relatively simple dish to make, and a great combination of sweet and savory. The compote does need to reduce a bit more at the end, and the cooking time for the pork was slightly too long. I would cook it for a few minutes less next time. Overall a great recipe.
