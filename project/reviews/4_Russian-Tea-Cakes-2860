After eating some Russian Tea Cakes from a local upscale bakery, I was inspired to try this recipe. They were divine! I used my OXO medium cookie scoop, baked them at 350 F for 15 minutes on parchment paper as other reviewers suggested. Perfect results. My son and husband couldn't stop eating them.

I usually make the cookies about 1.5" diameter and 3/4" tall when fully cooked, which doesn't yield more than 2 dozen. This recipe for Russian Tea Cakes is melt-in-your mouth, can't stop yourself from eating more, delicious! I've chopped up peppermint candies (i.e., candy canes) to replace the hazelnuts around Christman, and that's a hit! I've made this over and over and it's never gone wrong!

If you're using an electric oven 400 degrees I think is too high. You want to dry the cookies out and mine kept ending up with much darker bottoms than they should have. When using electric (not convection) I would suggest dropping the temp to 350 and keep a close eye on them. The same amount of time (15 minutes) should do it.

Have been making this recipe for Christmas for many years. These cookies are like a little puff of heaven. I found that the temp was too high as other people have mentioned. After experimenting I get good results baking at 375 for 11 - 13 minutes. Leave on sheet 2 minutes, then cool to just warm on rack. I keep a big Tupperware container full of powdered sugar. Roll them - then just push them to the side of the container, roll the next bunch and so on. Store them in the container with extra sugar and a lid to keep it fresh. Ready to serve right from the container, buried in powdered sugar. Mmmm!

subbed part of the flour with trader joe's almond meal and the hazelnuts with walnuts -- amazing!!

Love these--we call them snowballs now for my kids. Using my convection oven set to 375 I baked them for 8 minutes and that seemed to be just right. I use a silpat too. Don't know if that made a difference but I didn't have trouble with too brown bottoms.

I love these cookies so much...I make them every year. I can not stress how important it is to put the cookies into the powdered sugar while still hot....that is what makes this cookie! I have had problems with the bottoms getting too brown/black also...I just take a vegetable peeler or a small thin knife and shave off the bottom....it comes off easily and leaves just the good cookie behind. I do use my processer to grind the nuts down to a fine powder..just not too much or they will start to release their oils.

This cookie is delicious! I used walnuts and they turned out great. A good afternoon snack. Great with tea.

Yup, the cookies I remember. These were always part of our christmas candy/cookie lineup. I agree with previous reviewers that making sure that you get the cookies out of the oven before they get too done is key! I use a splash more vanilla than in the recipe. Many nuts work and did hazlenuts and pecans this year, have used walnuts and almonds in the past. But I think pecans are my favorite. These are interesting cookies, they show up all over the world. Mexican Wedding Cakes, Russian Tea Cakes, Meltaways..I am currently in Cairo, Egypt and was told they are the traditional cookie eaten during Eid celebrations...

I'm not a huge nut lover but love the texture of these cookies, so I left out the nuts and used mini chocolate chips instead. They were great and got a lot of compliments at a cookie swap. Making them again for a party tonight!

Agree with previous reviewers: 1. Double the recipe 2. Put the powdered sugar in a paper bag, and shake 2 -3 cookies into the bag at a time while they are hot from the oven to coat with the sugar. A classic, delicious cookie. Very easy.

This cookie received such rave reviews ....... Can they be frozen ..........

Rating: 4
If I had to take a wild guess, I would say that the temperature differences between the refridgerators of the reviewers was causing the baking discrepancy. Best to keep an eye on them while they bake.

A quick note about baking times and temps - these cookie are not nearly as delicious when they have black bottoms. Some reviewers mentioned that the temp was too high but I find it works well in my oven - the key is to take the cookies out as soon as they are a little golden. But just a little. The flaky, melt-in-your-mouth flavors only work if you trust that they will cook from within for a few minutes after you remove them from the oven. I grew up on these at my mother's house and this is the only cookie recipe I make with any confidence. I always substitute walnuts for hazelnuts (personal preference), but otherwise, magnificent.

Being of Polish.Russian decent, I grew up with these babies! My grandmother added an extra treat which I have adapted. Always use ground almonds for the nuts and roll the dough around a candied cherry covering completely and bake as directed, yum and what a surprise. We always get rave reviews.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe. It works with every kind of nut you can think of with the exception of peanuts. I like it with 1 1/14 cup of ground pecans and 1 3/4 cups of flour. It makes the recipe more melt-in-your-mouth nutty.

Very nice, but 400 degrees is much too high. They burned to a crisp. They were wonderful when I lowered the temperature to 350 degrees.

Very simple and delicious. I made them exactly as written for a bridal shower. They do, indeed, mellt in your mouth.

I think this is a good recipe, but was surprised that only one other reviewer mentioned the temperature being on the high side. At 400 degrees, the cookies were overcooked in fifteen minutes in a well calibrated oven. I would reduce the temperature to 350 next time around.

These were lovely. I too used walnuts, I guess most nuts would work. Easy to make and great result.

Rating: 3
These were excellent. I loved the toasted hazelnuts. If you've never made them before, you'll wonder how the heck the powdered sugar is going to stick to the cookies when you're done. When you roll them while they're hot, the first coat of powdered sugar creates a sticky glaze. That's why the second coat is needed. I made them for a Supper Club dinner for russian night to serve with tea.

My first attempt at making these. I substituted walnuts for hazelnuts (I couldn't find hazelnuts at the store), but otherwise followed the original recipe exactly. They were absolutely spectacular! I couldn't believe that I'd actually made them. They were so easy to make that I couldn't believe they tasted as good as they did.

We have just finished making 300 of these wonderful cookies for an event tomorrow. These are so easy to make! We used toasted pecans, and double rolled them in sugar. Thanks for the bag tip!

This is the best cookie recipe ever! I substituted the hazlenuts with 1/4 cup of chopped pine nuts & 1/2 cup of skim milk powder & they were superb!! You can shape the cookies with a small cookie scooper & then sprinkle with icing sugar instead of rolling them in icing sugar! My husband loves them! Enjoy!!

I made these using granulated sugar but wouldn't that again (although they were still very good!). I used a plastic tupperware melon baller to make them all the same size and shape. They turned out roundish with a flat bottom. I used a plastic bag to coat them in icing sugar (great tip from previous reviewer). I will make these again and try adding some orange zest.

Excellent; I doubled it and they still disappeared in minutes. Make em small enough to pop in the mouth as they're quite crumbly/flakey. THANKS to the reviewer who suggested shaking them w/ the sugar in a paper bag: worked perfectly.

Coming from Russian Parents, this recipe did come quite close to the treats that we make, just one change, omit the hazelnuts....we use walnuts, chopped.

Rating: 3
These are DELICIOUS! I am adding them to my Christmas Cookie reperatoire (I know, I spelled that wrong) for sure. I made them for my daughter's Kindergarten class, and omitted the hazelnuts as there is a child who is allergic to nuts. So, instead, I finely, finely chopped about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and mixed them in. Quite yummy. I was wondering how it would be with chopped dried cranberries and orange zest for a variation. Maybe next time! I didn't think Kindergarteners would care for that! Make these and you will not be sorry.

You can add food coloring too. Christmas- red and green, Valentine-pink, Halloween-orange, etc. Easy crowd pleaser.

These are great! It is easier to put powdered sugar in a paper bag and shake the cookies 2-3 at a time shortly after taking them out of the over. Works great.

Bet you can't eat one! I agree with the previous reviewer -- these are addicting. My husband says these cookies are as good as any you'd find in an upscale bakery. I too mistakenly used granulated sugar instead of powdered sugar. Either way, this is a winner. Two thumbs up!

These are positively addictive!! I nixed the hazelnuts and used a mix of almonds, walnuts and pecans. We couldn't stop eating them!

Made this twice now. The 1st time I accidentially used granulated sugar in the dough and rolled in powdered, and the 2nd time I followed the recipe exactly. I hv to admit, I really liked the gran. sugar better.. not sure if it made the cookie sweeter but it just tasted better to me. :)

This recipe is very good. It's addicting. I made 3 dozens today and they're almost gone. If you're planning to bake this for a party, make sure you bake enough 'cause 5 of these for each person wont be enough! I could eat this all day.

My mother, who is old world Russian, has made these teacakes for years. So my first tasting was 50 years ago. I now make them each year for the holidays to carry on the tradition. When I make them I use Almonds. All who have tasted them have loved them. They are best the second day if you save them in an unsealed container.

I've always loved these cookies and these were delicious! I've had them before where they tasted like little lead bombs but these were sooooo light! I used pecans, doubled the batch, and came out with 70 little winners.

Magnificent cookie. I've already made this recipe twice this 2001 Christmas and my husband is whining for more. I used walnuts the first time, and pecans the second...heading toward the hazelnuts the next time around. I got 40 cookies exactly, so I guess you should pay attention to how big your inch is...some think their inch is larger than others. I rolled them twice the second time, and rolling once seems to taste just as good. They LOOK prettier rolling twice. Thanks for the fabulous recipe.

This recipe is always a holiday favorite. I usually double the recipe and they are gone within a few days. I had lost my old cooky book (Yes, the book is that old!) that had this recipe and I was delighted to find it here! These cookies are light and melt in your mouth. Try a batch for yourself! It can make 3 dozen cookies if you make the cookies small and bite sized. They're best this way!

Everyone @ work gobbled these up. A couple things: the batch made 25-30 tea cakes, and definitely let them cool before the sugar dustings.

Yummy yummy for everyone's tummy. Easy to make and tricky to eat. Yes, by all means double the batch, might as well, you'e already deep in powdered sugar anyway ! I just finished the first dusting and they are disappearing already. These will have to be hidden or gone.....long gone before Christmas Eve. Way too busy to do it again, better hide them in the "mop closet, next the Johnson's paste wax" they will never find them there !!!!!

I find that a great way to "kick this recipe up a notch" is to, before sticking them in the oven, put a dab of rasperry jam on each. My family is nothing but full of praise everytime I make these!

Ahh...my absolute fav holiday cookie I have been making since coming across the recipe in Jr Hi Home EC class. That was in the late 60's. They are lovingly referred to as "deathballs" by my DH.I usually use pecans or walnuts but was planning to subs Hazelnuts this yr.

For variety, I roll some of the tea cakes in colored sugar BEFORE baking. Because of the coloring, be careful not to overbake!

This is buttery and melts in your mouth. I used pecans because I didn't have hazlenuts, and only cooked them 12 minutes, because they can crumble if overbaked. Rave reviews from friends who tried them.

My very favorite cookie in the world! I have made these for years at Christmas time. The flavor is perfectly balanced -- buttery and just sweet enough. These are perfect with coffee.
