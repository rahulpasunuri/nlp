I hate predictive text - meant to write vego friendly! anyway I hope my tips were helpful As these are fantastic, can be made ahead and transport well. Although I shudder when I see non Asian ingredients like cayenne being substituted, and I won't be trying that sauce

I made this for dinner tonight for myself, since hubby went for a work thingy instead. Anyway, I took a couple of shortcuts I highly recommend since I don't think it'll compromise the recipe and just makes life saner: buy premade peanut dipping sauce (even Shop Rite has this), buy one of those pre-cooked shrimp cocktail platters for your shrimp part, and buy pre-shredded lettuce. Easy-peasy. The rice paper gives the confetti veggies a frosty appearance--just beautiful. Good for make-ahead dinner parties too. I only give it two forks because it is so healthy tasting.

Really good. Made for a potluck party and everyone was impressed. Used pre-cooked shrimp to save time. Yes, rolling the rice paper takes some practice and skill. I got it down pretty well by the 4th one. I, too, am not a fan of sprouts so used another reviewer's suggestion of jicama which I thought worked beautifully. I didn't make the cashew dipping sauce based on the reviews here so made the soy dipping sauce from pork and jicama dumplings instead. Simple and delicious. Will make these again.

This is a winner! The filling makes more than 12 servings, however. The dipping sauce could probably be cut in half. It made a lot! But yummy.

This is a wonderful appetizer. Delicious and has a big "wow" factor in its presentation. Definitely a keeper.

My brother passed this recipe on to me, and I have made it several times over the years for parties, and it always gets rave reviews. The spring rolls are great, although for the first timer, dealing with the rice wrappers can be a bit trying. It's not hard at all if you've used them before, but I still soak them one at a time as I assemble them. The dipping sauce is the part I have tended to experiment with, using less yogurt, as I didn't like the pronounced yogurt taste with the recommended quantity. I also used more cayenne pepper to give it heat.

AWESOME! I chopped the cilantro leaves and put the shrimp in an ice bath after cooking. The do-ahead factor is great!

My husband and I love this. It's perfect on a hot day, or when you are in the mood for something fresh and clean.

I brought these to a dinner party where they were a big hit! The finished product is very impressive looking. I found it easier to work with the rice paper one at a time, and I might make a different dipping sauce next time.

I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious this recipe turned out. Besides having a hard time finding the wrappers, it was easy to prepare. My husband watched me make them and thought I was crazy, but loved the finished product. The cashew dipping sauce could definitely be improved (it was not outstanding) but overall, it is a definite do again.

Killer Recipe!***** Yes cilantro is coriander (aka Chinese Parsley). The Roasted Garlic Peanut dipping sauce from Stonewall Kithcen is better than the Cashew dipping sauce... if you can get it. For any other Artesians out there you can get Stonewall Kithcen products at Ralph's Thriftway. I use jicama in a matchstick dice in place of the alfalfa sprouts... better texture and less obtrusive "sprouty" flavor. Probably a thousand variations you could come up with based on this recipe.

These are excellent with a crisp fresh taste not to mention healthy. They were easy to make and you can add / delete item as desired. The cashew dipping sauce is perfect with them. We'll definately make them again.

This is a wonderful appetizer that is relatively easy to prepare but creates a lasting impression. The cashew sauce is good enough to eat on its own, and the spring rolls are divine. It is also an easy dish to make substitutions to, or to make vegetarian.

These spring rolls have become a standard when serving Asian inspired meals in our house. Delicious! For a quick and delicious alternative we also serve these with Stonewall Kitchen's Roasted Garlic Peanut Sauce. Addictive!

Haven't made this, but wanted to share that fresh coriander and cilantro are the same thing...

I made this dish for a cocktail party and let me tell you, they went fast! I kept getting asked the question, "Where did you get these rolls?" No one has guested they were homemade! I would definately make these again. A tip: I bought cooked shrimp which cut down on the prep. time and I could not find fresh corriander anywhere so I used basil instead. Great!

I had a much harder time with the rice paper than I thought I would, but I finally got it down by just dipping one at a time. This is a delicious recipe; my picky-eater father was looking for more when they were gone. I think next time I will add some fresh basil leaves.

Great dish and actually easier than I thought when I read the recipe. I loved the very fresh taste. Great alternative to a salad.

I knew that these rolls would be a hit so I doubled the recipe but I would recommend not doubling the cashew sauce since it goes a long way. I also used rice stick noodles instead of shrimp and omitted the lettuce. I also added a soy-ginger dipping sauce which went faster than the cashew dip. Everyone at the party was impressed that the rolls were home made and really quite easy to prepare once all the prep work was done.

Really refreshing recipe. Received great reviews. Took a some effort, but really worth it for something special. I added enoki mushrooms, thin rice noodles(soaked) and chopped mint leaves to the spring roll "stuffing". I also gave the shredded carrots and the cashew sauce a sprinkle of sugar for added complexity. Delish.

Have made this dish for several parties and they are always a success. The rolls have a fresh, clean taste and are perfectly complimented by the sauce. The recipe does an excellent job of describing how to make them. Somewhat time consuming but well worth the while. Recommend buying extra rice paper, because it's inexpensive and you will tear some.
