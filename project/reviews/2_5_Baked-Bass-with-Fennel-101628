Simple, healthy and delicious! I roasted one (1) 2 lb striped bass and kept the proportions the same. I stuffed the fish cavity with fennel fronds, salt and pepper. The anise made the fish wonderfully sweet! Twenty-five minutes was an accurate cooking time before I added the fennel and onions.

Wonderful recipe. I made it with a 1.5lb skin-on striped bass fillet which I cut in half and then stacked skin side out in the pan with the fennel seeds and oil all over. Fresh fennel seeds are critical. Also, crushing them (I used a spice grinder) is essential. Since you probably aren't making this unless you like fennel to begin with, I suggest adding more crushed seeds (another tbs) to the fennel bulb mixture, as i did, which was very nice. Also, I thought that a little butter, no more than a tbs, would have enhanced the flavor of the fennel mixture and will add next time. Don't try to make this without Pernod (the real thing) as it is essential to the flavor. As with all fish, the key is not to overcook, so start watching like a hawk after 20 minutes. A Gewurz or Viognier goes nicely with it since the dish is aromatic. JK, new york
