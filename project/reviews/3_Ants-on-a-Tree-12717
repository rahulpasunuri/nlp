This was a huge hit with my family, although I did make some modifications. My kids (ages 5 & 7) loved it -- they didn't think the bean noodles were gross at all. I added 1/3 head green cabbage shredded, sauteed 6 shiitakes, and increased the sauce ingredients by 50% to accommodate the extra ingredients. I also added some Japanese soy sauce (don't know the name but it has bonito - yes, I'm getting in to fusion here). In short the base recipe is good, 3 stars, but it's easy to add a bit to make it 4 stars and my kids raved.

I looked at many recipes for this dish after having it in a restaurant, and I put sliced shiitake mushrooms and shredded black fungus mushrooms when I made it and it made the dish extra delicious. The bean thread noodles are key, they make it so yummy.

Also used ramen as I knew it would be less of a fight with the kids. Thank you to the reviewer who suggested adding cabbage.

This is delicious! I added half a head of shredded green cabbage that I needed to use up, stir-fried in the same pan after the pork was done, and upped the sauce ingredients proportionally for the extra bulk of cabbage. For me, the cabbage was a nice addition of texture and crunch, since glass noodles do creep me out just a little. Really yummy though!

This is a good solid recipe that can take embellishments like the addition of vegetables. You need to be very careful when preparing bean thread noodles though, as they are delicate and can easily overcook. When soaking in warm water, remove the noodles when they are still a little underdone - they'll finish cooking in a flash with the rest of the ingredients in the hot wok/pan

EASY! And really good. great for subs, too. Change the meat, noodles, alcohol... it all works. A little spicy for little kids - mine liked it but did a fair amount of complaining and drank lots of water! My husband and I? Yum.

This was so boring. I can't believe it got good reviews. I made it with Ramen noodles and would prefer Oodles of Noodles to this. Blah

Looks kinda weird, but tastes great! Kids (9 and 6) loved it. Hubby put more chili paste on his and gobbled it up. I made it because it was in the "Gourmet" cookbook (the source of all good recipes!), and it calls for Sake, not scotch.

My mom made this dish for me as a child and the recipe was eventually lost so when I found it I couldn't wait to make it. I have now made this exact recipe for years and love it. My husband who is not as much of a asian food lover as me likes this dish much better when made with ramen noodles, I didn't have enough cellophane noodles and tore into a few ramen noodle packages instead. So if you find that the noodles recommended aren't to your liking try ramen, they're sturdier and do soak up the sauce.

This is my new favorite recipe. Fast, easy, tasty. Since I'm a honky, I'd never heard of anything like this, and I'm really glad I tried it out. I double the Sri Racha, minus the scallions, Scotch, and sometimes don't marinate because I'm lazy and hungry!

This was a great starting point for me. My husband and I both had parents who cooked this specific dish for us when we were kids. We both had a different variation, though. It was served on fried rice noodles rather than cooking bean thread noodles in the sauce. I decreased the amount of chicken broth by a decent amount and skipped the scotch just because I didn't have any. It was as good as I'd remembered.

We loved this dish. The bean-thread noodles (aka glass noodles, or cellophane noodles) are important in this recipe. It wouldn't be the same with substitutions. The slippery nature of the noodles are intrinsic to its unique deliciousness. When I first tried these noodles I was a kid, and I didn't like it, it seemed to slip down my throat, but now I love it. It's probably pretty exotic to most Americans.

I really like this recipe - although I make half the qty. because I'm in the minority in my house. Will try it with ground chicken per another reviewer for more tender "ants".

I really liked this recipe, my children so-so because they're not crazy about cellophane noodles, which are not available here freshly made. I make it for myself now çause it's so easy and will try it with ground chicken per another reviewer as I'm not so fond of the ground pork sold here.

Try this with fresh noodles, which absorb the sauce and don't have that "slimy" texture. We always like this dish.

I really liked this recipe, as did my DH. I added a bit more garlic and next time will add more veggies for a bit more color.This time I only added in some filet beans cut on a long diagonal and the dish, for a party or just more fun, could use a bit more color. I used the thia rice noodles for the first time and they were great in this.Just a fun dish that was very easy ( measure /cut up your stuff ahead of time!), and a potential great way to get rid of those small amounts of left overs as well!

I've made this dish twice. The first time I remember thinking it was very good, but I made it again recently and it was mediocre, especially in presentation. Maybe next time I will add some vegetables to make it more interesting...

The secret to this recipe is to prep everything and measure in advance as it cooks quickly. I use Thai rice noodles and have even added salad shrimp and broccoli to add "monkeys" to the "ants" on the "trees." Oh, and don't forget a little extra garlic.

This recipe was a dud. It ended up as a tasteless bowl of gelatinous glop. My husband was a good sport and finished his serving but I stopped eating after three bites. At least we have dinner for the dog for the rest of the week.

I had to try this given the fun name and I also had some ground pork I needed to use up. It was pretty good. I added alot of Thai chili paste. Kicked up to atomic spicy it was much better. Quick and easy.

given the negative reviews, i felt i had to write and encourage people to try this recipe. it is one of our house's favorites.

I followed the recipe closely and we were very disappointed. The noodles did not absorb much sauce and were mushy. The flavor was bland to say the least. I have had a similar dish at a local restaurant and really hoped this would be similar. Not.

Yum!! I've finally found a recipe for this dish that tastes as good as it looks. Even my picky toddler son loved it.

Bad news this time. Aesthically unappetizing, somewhat slimy. Tasted great if you eat w/your eyes shut.

Actually not an insulting Asian dish from Epicurious, for a change. Those who made substitutions -- give yourself a low rating, not the dish. It's amazing that you passed the blame on the recipe.

Great as a side dish if made as-is. I'd take Mikey's suggestions and add vegetables and mushrooms to make it more of a main dish. I can only assume that the scotch is to approximate Chinese Xiao-xing wine, which is what my mom (who is Chinese) uses. If you can find it, try that.

Don't know if it was my fault or by design but the ginger in this dish was WAY too overpowering. I also used turkey instead of pork, also a mistake. I love mung bean noodles and will do this again with appropriate changes.

A local restaurant serves this with ground chicken instead of pork. It's comfort food for our family.

I couldn't find bean-thread noodles, so had to substitute. The noodles didn't absorb much, so the broth ended up on the bottom of the pan.

The market I went to didn't have ground pork so I substituted ground turkey and the results were excellent!

Received excellant reviews at my party. Would recommend this recipe.

Add some grated carrots, finely diced celery and Shitake mushrooms slivers to the dish to make it outstanding!
