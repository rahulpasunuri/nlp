I read the reviews and followed everyone's advice of refrigerating the dough for a few hours. I also added fresh chopped sage and oregano to the dough to give it more flavor. Turned out spectacular.

Made this for 3 kids and 2 adults. Everyone ate it but all agreed it was rather bland. Won't be making it again. Followed suggestions of others: refrigerate dough; use more flour. Looked pretty but taste was a let down.

They were okay. If I were to make again I'd use half the pepper, and refrigerate as others recommended. We found both the gnudi and sauce quite bland.

Eliminate the mess and increase the flavor: instead of cooking in simmering water, shape into small flat patties about the size of a silver dollar (remember those?)and dust lightly with flour. Then brown in butter. This gives superb nutty flavor and the pan drippings can be the base for a sauce. Yes, with increased flour to about 3/4 cup, these are quite manageable. Uncooked patties are easy to freeze.

Made them tonight, never having made gnudis befoe. My husband loved them. I added some sautéed chopped spinach to the mix and it provided a nice added flavor and texture. Followed others' suggestions and refrigerated the dough for at least an hour before rolling. You have to cook them at least 5-7 minutes after they've floated to the top. I also tweaked the sauce by adding a sautéed onion and some red pepper flakes to it. Very nice, light dumplings and the sauce was great too. This recipe yielded about 30 dumplings.

Don't add too much flour or it ruins the texture. Here's a better way to deal with stickiness and make them... Cover and chill dough 1 hour. Do ahead Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled. Line rimmed baking sheet with plastic wrap. Place some flour in bowl. For each gnudi, gently roll 1 heaping teaspoonful of dough into ball. Add to flour; toss to coat lightly, shaping into short log. Place on baking sheet. Do ahead Can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover; chill.

I followed the advice of other reviewers: 1 cup flour, add nutmeg, generously coated in flour, and refrigerated overnight. Wonderful light flavors in both the gnudi and sauce! Might add parsley to gnudi next time. Fairly quick and easy to make (especially if you make the gnudi the day before).

Gnudi means naked. It is essentially ravioli filling with out the dough (that´s why it is naked). You need to boil the water and then simmer and cook them in the simmering water a few at a time. This will prevent them from falling appart. The less flour you add to them, the lighter they are. It is a delicate dish, that calls for a delicate sauce. This is a wonderful recipe.

I made this recipe before reading the reviews online. When I cooked them, about half fell apart in the cooking water. I think next time I will take some of the other reviewers advice and let them sit out for a little while before I cook them. For the ones that did turn out ok, they tasted delish and were a great alternative to pasta.

Are these the same as gnocchi? I have not heard of gundi.

The gnudi were so light and delicate! I added a little extra flour and refrigerated for a few hours before boiling. Will definitely make this again.

The pomodoro sauce was too bland and simple for this dish--make some arrabiata sauce instead. The gnudi itself worked well, although I increased the flour a bit and chilled in the fridge for 10 minutes out of fear it would fall apart. I like that it is much faster than gnocchi. The flavor was very mild despite being generous with the seasoning and parmesan and adding some nutmeg. Next time i might try to mix spinach or arugula into the dough.

The 2 spoon technique does take a little practice but it got easier after about a dozen. Definitely use lots of flour as they are sticky! Next time I might add a bit of flour to the batter. Also, I froze mine for about 30 minutes so they'd hold together in the boiling water, which worked like a charm. We liked the simplicity of the pomodoro sauce that accompanies the recipe.

I have made this twice now. The first time I used the quantities suggested and ended up with a miserable mushy pot of terrible goo that I promptly tossed. The second time, I read several other recipes and followed some of the tips listed in them. I started with a cup of flour and added by the tablespoon from there. (1/2 cup was runny and did NOT form a "ball" in any way) I formed the pasta and promptly dropped each one into a small pile of flour and coated the outside, and set onto a parchment lined baking sheet. I let them sit for about 15 minutes to let the flour sink in, but some recipes suggest letting them sit like this in the refrigerator for a few hours up to a few days... used just barely simmering water and did NOT disturb the pot while they were cooking. They did float right to the top when finished, and had great gooey texture. The sauce...not a fan. Will make my own recipe next time. Also, I'll add more pepper, salt, and parm to the Gnudi, mine were a little bland but still quite tasty. With further improvement, I can see this being a go to recipe.

Delish! These are so much lighter and more flavorful than gnocchi. I put the gnudi in a shallow dish and broiled them with a little olive oil and parmesan. Sooo good!

Really fun and quick recipe. I put a big pot of water to boil and the gnudi were done by the time the water was ready! I did have some trouble with the two spoon molding method, maybe mine were a bit wet. But they held together perfectly well and freezing worked great too. Next time I would taste before I salted, my cheese was very salty.

This was a delicious, relatively simple recipe. I loved the sauce, super delicious and yet incredibly easy to make. I wished they had better instruction on how to make the gnudi and also how wet or "moist" they should be after flour added, but this did not stop us from eating it and loving it. Next time, and there will be a next time, I will add a touch of fresh nutmeg to the gnudi and add a little more flour.

My mom just tried this and said it was absolutely delicious. She shad the texture was so nice and she made her own sauce. I will try it next because it is a great protein-rich alternative to pasta.
