Try adding a splash of dry red wine and some chopped basil.

I don't understand how you could put cayenne pepper in a sauce from Argentina. We do not eat red pepper or hot chilies in Argentina.

I just returned from Argentine where I ate more than my share of Chimichurri. The flavor of his recipe is very good. But it has a big problem. As directed, the consistency is very wrong. It's way too liquid. Chimichurri should be only moderately thick with just a slight runniness to it. Cut back on the vinegar by at about 3/4 cup. I processed in one medium sweet yellow onion and it really enhanced the flavor and added some substance to the sauce. Use the smoked paprika if you have it. If you don't, add a little liquid smoke (to taste.) You'll appreciate the depth either of these options adds to the flavor.
