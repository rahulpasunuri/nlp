Used apple cider instead of chicken stock and otherwise followed the recipe. It was pretty, and flavor was good, but the top was dry. Not sure I would do it again--may consider it but would add all the rice at once to cook the brown rice longer and would use a deeper dish so there is less surface area. My son and his fiance liked it enough that they took most of it home. Good gluten-free choice.

I made this recipe for our company Christmas party, our church progressive dinner and our own Christmas dinner. It was a big hit each time. A great gluten-free alternative to bread stuffing. We served it with citrus stuffed goose. We boiled the goose neck meat and added it to this dish. Allow 2 hours to make it. It's great as left overs too. This will be a new family holiday favorite.

I made this stuffing for years and so last year I tried something new. My guests were disappointed that this wonderful wild rice stuffing was not on the buffet....so it will be this year again. Enjoy!

Made this for thanksgiving. Thanks to previous reviews I changed a few things. Precooked the wild rice in plain water and drained well; cooked the brown rice and thyme like risotto but used apple cider instead of chicken stock adding the wild rice at the end. Then added the cranberries, parsley, nuts, green onions prior to heating in the oven for about 15 min to allow for flavors to blend but preserve color and texture. Was very popular!

Very good. I used filberts, since that was what I found - turned out great. I also used dried cherries instead of craisens -

It was wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly, and my guests raved about it. It has a very earthy subtle taste to it. Hazelnuts and cranberries add a very nice touch. Of course, we all love wild rice and gourmet food. Kids didn't even try it, no surprise there. I am making it this year again. I am thinking about adding turkey giblets to it. The recipe makes tons, I will cut it in half this time (family of four). Last year I froze half. It defrosted well, and we ate all of it. A+++

Meh. I made half a batch, following the recipe exactly, for Thanksgiving dinner this weekend. Even with 15 guests at the table, most of it got left on peoples' plates. I think I scraped most of the recipe into the garbage afterwards. Very disappointing. I won't be making this again.

My favorite stuffing. I use less butter and omit the cranberries. You can put it on warm in the crockpot for a few hours if you make ahead. Just leave out the hazelnuts until ready to serve. For leftovers, mix with cream of mushroom or chicken soup and leftover turkey. Put additional hazelnuts on top and bake until hot

I had to add more broth when I put in the brown rice. But this is a really good side dish!

I made this for T-day a few years ago, and while I loved it, everyone else seemed to just like it. I added the cranberries later in the process to preserve the color - everything turned out beautifully. The different tastes and textures were like a party in my mouth...

This was great! It appealed to my entire family, and I've gotten several requests for the recipe. It halves easily for an impressive side dish.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year, and most of it stayed in the pan. It's not that the dish itself is bad, but it really doesn't count as "Thanksgiving stuffing". I made some of the changes suggested by other reviewers, including boiling the rice in apple cider (and veggie broth), adding some of the turkey drippings, and adding chestnuts. We even threw in some dried bread, but it still overwhelmed the turkey. This would make a nice side dish for a pork or ham dish.

I have made this stuffing the last 5 years for Thanksgiving. It is fabulous and eveyone asks for the recipe. If I decided to try something new (which I wouldn't) I would have some explaining to do. The flavors blend perfectly and the presentation is beautiful.

I should have written this right after I made it (Thanksgiving 2005). I agree, it is beautiful. When I removed the foil covering, I was so pleased to look at it. And it really has a mellow and delicious taste.

Rating: 4
Delicious - the flavour of this dish needs a bit of time to develop. It is best made ahead for the flavours to mingle. Don't be skimpy with salt to bring out the flavours. I added a bit of pepper as well. I boosted the flavour with pan juices from the roasted chickens. This helps if the broth used was insipid. I had only dried thyme (not fresh parsley or thyme) and I used it generously. While putting away the leftovers, one of my guests was eating it from the serving bowl with the serving spoon!

I love this recipe. It's so easy to make and yet very tasty. I usually use regular chicken broth and have also used beef broth and both turned out well. Definitely add the cranberries and hazelnut, it MAKES the dish. I usually have it as a side dish for rib roast. This dish has become a mainstay for our Christmas eve dinner.

Rating: 2
Another literal rating. Out of 11 guests at the dinner table, only one person had a second serving of this dish. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except adding the cranberries, green onions and hazelnuts at the end to give it a better look and (hopefully) flavor. Out of the many side dishes served, this was the only item that had enough left over to serve at a leftovers party two nights after for a party of 6 (and we still had leftovers). I don't think anyone from this group went back for seconds either. This dish will not make it back onto the menu.

Rating: 4
We loved it, Toasted Hazelnuts and Wild Rice are a great combination nutty and tasty. We followed the recipe exactly, and I was surprised even though it stayed in the oven a long time re-heating covered with foil it was still very moist and flavorful.

Excellent vegetarian stuffing if you sub un-chicken broth! We really loved the flavors and it was beautiful, so autumnal. Would make again for sure!

Question: Do you think I can use this as stuffing for a turkey breast roulade? Would it make it soggy/mushy?

This is a great base recipe, and I've had a lot of fun with it. I cook the wild rice in Apple Cider; substitute the brown rice with toasted sour dough bread, cut into 1/2 inch cubes; add dried apples to the dried cranberries, and replace the hazelnuts with cashews and sliced almonds. For added texture, I soak two cans of sliced water chestnuts in Apple Cider for two days, and throw them in at the last minute, creating a crunchy apple taste. Breathtakingly good!

This is the perfect wild rice dish! Each of the flavors compliment without overpowering the delicate flavor of the wild rice. I like to substitute dried apricot slivers for the cranberries. Any dried fruit and nut combination will do...Enjoy!

OUTSTANDING!! I made this last year for Thanksgiving. Everyone in my family requested it again this year! The only change I made was adding roasted almonds instead of hazlenuts (I didn't have time for hazlenuts). It turned out wonderfully! I will use hazlenuts this year and compare!!

Wow!! I used this recipe inconjunction w/ pork chops (as a stuffing agent), & they came out great. It was like eating in a 4star restaurant but at home & w/o the expensive bill in the end. The texture of the rice, along with the filberts and cranberries were very surprising. This one's definitely a keeper. I'll try it again for Thxsgiving. My last stuffing recipe (last yr) was also a hit, but people agreed that it was a meal within itself. Although, that didn't stop many of them from going back for seconds and thirds. Yum!!

Rating: 4
I made this dish several years ago as the stuffing in a standing rib roast at Christmas. Everyone loved it! This year, I'm recommending it to my friend for her standing rib roast dinner. Maybe cooking it in a turkey is too long (ie: mushiness/lack of color). I do know the juices from the beef make it wonderful!

Rating: 4
I like to try a new recipe every year, but my family requested me to search this one out again because they loved it so much. So from now on I might be making two stuffing recipes at Thanksgiving... a new one and this "by-request favorite." The flavor combination of hazelnuts and cranberries is just superb.

Rating: 3
Very nice alternative to the usual; well received with our crowd at Thanksgiving. Baked on the side. Didn't like the hazelnuts turning mushy after baking. Next time I would add them for the last few minutes of cooking along with the parsley and some of the green onion tops to keep the flavors and colors fresh.

I love this recipe! I used pre-cooked wild rice (sold in foil pouch) instead of dry wild rice, as I couldn't find dry. I just added it later in the cooking process. Delicious!

Rating: 3
Loved the flavors of the grains, cranberries, and nuts. However, it's too rich for the earthy flavors. Next time, I will use a lot less butter and fewer nuts. Agree with previous comments that the color is kind of blah -- next time, I'll stir in more parsely, green onions, and cranberries just before serving. And maybe some caramelized onions for flavor. I think all stuffings get mushy after cooking for so long -- I think this would be even better if cooked more like risotto and served when it still had a little crunch to it. Still, it's a nice alternative for people like me who hate bread stuffing.

Rating: 3
My husband does not like bread-based stuffing, so I made this. We both loved it, and I plan to make it for next year's Thanksgiving. To avoid complaints that the dish was "mushy," I used jumbo wild rice, and used 1/2 cup more of the wild rice (and another cup more of chicken broth) than the recipe called for. Otherwise, made it as is and it was fantastic (and colorful with the cranberries). The only reason I didn't add another fork was because, like one reviewer said, it's just a bit bland.

Rating: 3
We just finished Thanksgiving dinner and this recipe was the star (until dessert, that is; nothing beats the Chocolate Mousse Pie recipe from this site). I did substitute vegetable broth for the chicken, and used a mixture of chopped pecans and almonds instead of hazelnuts (easier), but otherwise followed exactly. For the cook from Atlanta: could it be that you didn't remove the husks from your hazelnuts? The husks lend a slightly unpleasant flavor and color everything the way that the giils of portobello mushrooms do. When I don't have time to remove them, I don't use them.

This was okay, a little sticky. I also burned the hazelnuts when roasting and had to substitute walnuts (blah!!). Want to try again with right ingredients.

Baked separately and served with Thanksgiving dinner this was outstanding. All of the flavors shone and the buttery feel and glisten made this both delicious and beautiful. If yours turned brown perhaps you overcooked the rice? Everyone loved this and wanted the leftovers to take home.

This recipe tasted good, but looked too bland. I expected to seeing the colors of the 2 rices, cranberries, and green onions. After baking the dish, everything turned an odd shade of brown/gray. I'll make it again, but add the cranberries, nuts and green onions at the end of the baking process. I will also reduce the baking time.

Rating: 2
I'm following the rating guidelines literally: I like this stuffing, but I don't love it. It's pleasantly light, flavored with the natural sweetness of the nuts, berries, and grains, but I find it lacking a fullness of flavor that would make it more enticing to finish all the leftovers. I'm not sure what happened to the flavor of all the butter, onion, and chicken stock. I threw in some sauteed mushrooms (portabello, oyster, crimini, button) to pick it up the day after, but it still lacks spark. I think this stuffing would make a better accompaniment to a rich meal than a stand-alone dish.

I need to add another fork to my rating!! This Recipe was simple and qiuck to make. I did use wild rice however I added 2 cups of wheat bread instead of the specified brown rice. I can't wait until christmas (neither can my friends, they all loved it for turkey day!!)

Great texture and combination of flavors! My brother from California thought it was great. It was a nice change from usual stuffing. Make sure not to over bake it. Could reduce hazelnuts by 1/3. Will make again and again.

I brought this dish to a large Thanksgiving-eve party. It received rave reviews and was one of the hits of the evening. Very delicious with the cranberries and hazelnuts - and a very nice texture. I substituted "no-chicken" broth to make it vegetarian friendly.

Delicious!! Made it last night with Chicken Breast Amadine and Green Beans with Balsamic-Shallot Butter (all from Epicurious). I didn't have hazelnuts on hand so I substituted with pine nuts with no problem. I will be making this for Thanksgiving this year without a doubt. Must try.

A healthier and delicious alternative to those dense stuffings. Next time, I'll double-up on the cranberries and thyme (I used dried); maybe add some chopped prunes or apricots as well. [I missed that part about husking the hazelnuts-ooops! I just threw them in the pot with everything else. Tasted fine to me!!]

I found that I needed a lot more chicken broth for the rice to cook - almost double. Everyone liked it and a few even requested the recipe. I used already chopped hazelnuts and didn't bother with removing skins.

I picked this stuffing to accommodate various food allergies (mushrooms, pecans, chestnuts) and those who keep kosher in my family. It didn't move as well as a bread stuffing, but I liked it. Try not to make it too far in advance since the rice and the hazelnuts get very mushy. Don't bother trying to get the skins off the hazelnuts, you can't tell in the finished product.
