My lamb was a boneless shoulder which I cubed myself. Cooked in one hour. I used creamed horseradish and it was excellent. No bitterness. The parsley puree was great and I will use that again on roast meat.

I love Bittman but this recipe was a mess. The horseradish sounded like a great idea but it left the broth so bitter. I had to fix it with sugar and vinegar. I might recommend skipping the horseradish and using thyme, white wine, and adding cubed potato for the last 20 minutes.

My family loved this dinner. We served it with rice (due to a wheat alergy). The parsley sause is a great addition. I used the recommended salt on the lamb and none in the parsley and it was still very salty. Even the broth was low sodium. Next time, I'll start with 1/2 to 1 tsp.

I served this at our Seder with baked polenta. It was good and our guests liked it. I simmered the lamb stew meat I bought for about three hours. It was fork tender and horseradish was extremely mild. My husband really wanted carrots, so I tossed some of those in for the last hour. It's a great dish for a hectic dinner like this because you can just let it simmer on the stove . I did have bit of trouble getting all the parsely smashed and properly pureed at the bottom of my blender. As a result, I used more oil than I would have liked. I may just chop it finely with the garlic next time, add a bit of salt, oil and vinegar and call it good.

Suggestion: If OK with the lamb- I am- adopt Michael Romano's (of Union Square fame) Matzo Polenta to make it kosher.

Delicious! The lamb cooked in 1 hour 20 minutes (from Fresh Direct, for NYC-area readers), and my guests and I ate the horseradish! It looses all bitterness, tasting more like turnips. The lid on my braising pot wasn't that tight, so I lost most of the liquid; I'll use a different pot, or increase the liquid next time. I used red wine, since that is what I had open.

The parsley puree is excellent and really makes the dish. I didn't use all the horseradish, and I did remove the horseradish before serving.

I served this for our Seder dinner, and it received rave reviews from everyone. I used only 1/2 cup of oil in the puree, and it tasted great. The only problem I had was that the sizes of the cubes of meat varied so much that some of them shredded to pieces before the others were cooked.

I used a combination of homemade chicken soup and wine for the braising liquid. The horseradish should be removed after cooking. It was outstanding. Everyone asked for seconds.

Horrible. Takes a perfectly good cut (boneless leg of lamb, in this case) and pulverizes it. Lamb was great after the braising and went downhill from there. Don't bother.

Luckily I decided to cook today for the seder. The stew is nearly inedibly bitter! I've just drained and discarded the liquid and horseradish and am trying to think of how to rescue the 5 lbs of lamb, which doesn't taste bad on its own, without the liquid.

Even among Ashkenazi Jews, lamb is permitted on Passover, as long as it's not roasted (that was the sacrifice in the days of the Temple - roasted lamb). I haven't figured out how the parsley puree fits in - to pass around for everyone to dribble over his portion, perhaps? Anyhow, the recipe is easy to make (I used lamb shanks cut for osso bucco, and the meat was falling-off-the-bone tender after barely 2 hrs of cooking) though I don't think that I would serve the horseradish slices. A happy and kosher Passover!

I have not made it yet but intend to substitute beef for lamb--although I am not sure how the parsley puree would work. (Horseradish is wonderful with beef.)

What you "reviewers" fail to realize is that there are many many jews who, while not keeping kosher, enjoy celebrating our holidays no matter what various "rules" apply. I applaud Mark Bittman's menu as a modern take on passover which allows one to "pick and choose" the courses and ingredients one would like. Relax, people.

The recipe looks like it would be delicious but like the other reviews there are many questions to the acceptability of eating lamb on Pesach. What alot of non-jewish or unobservant Jews don't realize is the different "holdings" and observances of the different sects of Judaism : Ashkenazi (Eastern Europian descent) which alot of times don't even eat tuna fish on Pesach since most of it is packed in soybean oil although if it is packed in water it is fine, but is rarely found outside of the USA. Ashkenazi obsevance of Pesach, which most American Jews are, is the most restrictive ; Sephardim (of North African descent) eat beans, couscous and lentils AND lamb on Pesach. In fact, in Israel, it is such that most of the country is BBQing lamb chops the morning after the seder! There also Taymanim ( of Yemenite descent) who have very different traditions from the Ashkenazim and Sephardim. Hag Kasher V'Sameach! Shana HaBah B'Yerushalayim!

Many rabbis weighing in on this question seem to disagree with the idea that one can't eat lamb on Passover. See, for example, http://judaism.about.com/library/3_askrabbi _o/bl_simmons_passoverlambseder.htm.

It is actually a Moroccan tradition to eat Lamb stew on passover, but I will agree with everyone else that this chef obviously knows nothing about real passover tradition. Half of the ingredient he recommends or not kosher for passover.

Unfortunately Lamb should not be served at a Passover Seder since it was the blood of the Pascal lamb that was used to mark the doorways of the Jewish homes so that the angel of death would pass-over those homes and the first born sons would not be killed.

Gelatin (unless it's made from fish instead of hooves) is also not Kosher.

Chickpeas are not Kosher for Passover, so hummus is out as an hors d'oeuvre.

AFAIK - polenta is not kosher le pesach. Do you perhaps mean quinoa?
