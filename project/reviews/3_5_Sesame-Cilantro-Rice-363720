Simple recipe that can be tweaked in many ways. I use brown rice. It is great to serve with things that have a complex sauce like curries since the flavors are more simple. I would not call it bland though. With ginger, onions, sesame, and the many other things you can do like cumin, garlic, etc it is the cooks fault if the rice is bland

I have received rave reviews each time I have served this. The peanut oil adds a nice flavor.

If you're looking for a bland, unimaginative rice recipe, you found it. The recipe says to be "generous with salt" because aside from the cilantro it is practically flavorless.

This was great and went well with the fish I served.

Didn't have green onions, used some red. Really good, can't wait to try it with green onions.

A nice change from our usual basmati rice recipe. I served it with the Thai Spareribs but think it would go well with lots of dishes. Even the kids took seconds.

GREAT RICE DISH! I made these with the Thai spareribs they were paired with in the magazine. I made the recipe exactly as written, and it turned out great. The flavors were very well married, and the rice was tasty without being too weighed down by any of the ingredients, which can sometimes happen (you know what we're talkin' about, cilantro). NOTE: I did find the water to be a little much and the cooking time to be a little short. The organic long grain basmati rice I used took about 45 minutes to soften. Keep this in mind - because rice keeps well on the stove, I'd recommend making this at least an hour (and maybe two) before serving time, just in case your rice needs a little longer cooking. Overall, a hit amongst my guests, even one who hates cilantro.
