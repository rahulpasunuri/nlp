My family and guests love this recipe. That said, I do not use heavy cream; I have substituted light cream to good effect. Also, I use less cheese than called for, otherwise it's just too much cheese and overwhelms delicate flavor of onions and turnips. Lastly, I do NOT use all of the broth that is recommended; I use just enough to achieve the desired thickness of the cream sauce, and usually that is substantially less broth than called for in the recipe. So, if you are comfortable relying on your intution, as opposed to following this recipe by the letter/number, I think you might enjoy it. It's much better than most creamed onion recipes I've tried. This year, since our guests do not like turnips, I am going to try this without the turnips...it will surely be a little bit bland without them, but I'm sure we'll enjoy it nonetheless. What isn't good with a bit of cream and gruyere cheese melted on top?!

This dish is great for lovers of turnip. Was a great addition to our Thanksgiving dinner. I was lazy with the pearl onions and used sliced red onions. Will make again.

This dish turned out brown in color (due to the beef broth). With the turkey and stuffing being brown, I wouldn't have made yet another brown dish if I had thought about it ahead of time. But I did like it, and it did get thick (unlike the experience of another cook). One reason why I chose the recipe is that it said I could make it 1 day ahead -- which I did. My guests said that it looked like french onion soup -- which made them want to eat it. And although I usually am not interested in vegetables and wouldn't normally think of cooking turnips, I'd make this again -- and would use it instead of potatoes. Perhaps I'd make it with a cut of beef.

This recipe was quite delicious tho we mostly tasted the onions and Gruyere; even people who usually don't care for turnips was happy with this gratin. However, we had to serve it with a slotted serving spoon; did anyone else have any difficulty getting it to thicken?

This is my new Thanksgiving turnip dish...I did not use it instead of mashed potatoes like the caption reads (we NEED mashed pots). It IS rich, creamy and delicious. The only change I made was to use homemade beef stock I had in my freezer(I used canned chicken stock). You really do have to like turnips to enjoy this dish, there is no hiding the distinctive flavor.
