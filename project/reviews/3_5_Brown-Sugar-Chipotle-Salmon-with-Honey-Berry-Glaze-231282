Loved this! I was hesitant to add flavors to the already wonderful sock-eye salmon, but my teenager was home, so I tried to appeal to his palette. Well, we were both pleasantly surprised. The sweet was great for him, and the smoky was great for me. I took it easy on the sauce and seasoning on top of the salmon as it cooked, and had pleanty of both available at the table. That worked out the best for us, because I used more seasoning and he used more sauce. This was wonderful.

Really loved this recipe, and sometimes make it with blueberries when blackberries aren't on hand. Great flavor contrast that marries well.

This is a "company worthy" entree. I used fresh blackberries and put them through a sieve as directed. I grilled the salmon for about 10 minutes on the Bar-B-Que. It was fantastic. This would be a quick and easy dish to serve for company. The smokiness of the rub combined with the sweetness of the blackberry sauce was wonderful.

This was so good that I joined the website officially just so that I could tell you how good it was. I thought that the recipe was asking for too much salt, but I followed the directions to the letter, and I couldn't be happier with the results.

Really tasty. I left out the butter because I wanted to absorb all my omega 3s. I also was out of blackberries so I just put some blueberries and cherry juice in the food processor to make the sauce. Nice and spicy, used 2 times as much chipotle!

Excellent! Unique! Never thought raspeberry sauce (with seeds-didn't remove) would go with fish. I also used only 1/2 of chipotle powder. Perfect combination of flavors!

This is so yummy! Love the sweet/spicy combo and looks beautiful on the plate! Will def make again.

I really enjoyed this recipe, but I can see how some people might not want to add all of this "extra" stuff to a nice piece of fresh salmon. When I'm in a hurry I'll pull out frozen salmon and use this recipe. I didn't worry about the blackberry seeds. Trying to remove them adds too much work to an otherwise simple & straightforward dish. Also, be aware that the chipotle can creep up on you. I opted for less. The sauce is wonderful and I found myself using it liberally on the couscous I made alongside :)

Very good, easy to make. Great combination of flavors. Delicious with Rice Pilaf with Pistachios and Golden Raisins (or use craisins for great color and flavor) and sugar snap peas with lemon and slivered almonds. And a bottle of pinot noir, of course!

This was an excellent mix of flavors! The spice could have been toned down a tad, but it was absolutely delicious!

Impress someone, NOT! Not only was it a mess to make, my boyfriend didn't like it, and my stomach felt weird after eating the different ingredients together. It was a waste of money.

What? This was terrible. I cannot believe I ruined my salmon with all of this 'stuff'! Keep it simple--I always have and strayed, but never again!

This recipe is awesome! I love salmon that has flavor added to it, and boy is this full of flavor. I was worried about the combo of berries with the chipotle, but the blackberry glaze is an excellent complement to the spice. This is one of those recipes you want to keep for when you feel like impressing someone. I think it's a "high class" recipe that is actually pretty easy to prepare. You might want to line you pan with foil, cause it can get a little messy!

Following the recipe to a tee.. love it! I was first concerned with the combo of blackberry and chipolte - but found it to be a great combo in this recipe. Even my husband, who is funny with fruit on his meats, loves it and actually requests it. He usually doesn't care what I cook - so that means something about this recipe!

This was one of the best preparations for salmon that I have ever tasted or cooked. It was a huge hit in my house. The combo of flavors was wonderful. I was pressed for time and could not find chipotle powder so I used cayenne and a tiny splash of liquid smoke to the glaze. Next time I will find the Chipotle and try fresh berries. I liked the idea of mixing the types of berries too.

Everyone in my family loved this. I used a 4-berry blend (straw, blue, black and raspberry) because that was what I had. The puree tasted kinda watery, so I reduced it for a few minutes (tossing in a cracked garlic clove) and that helped. I also added a large pinch of garlic powder to the rub and made an even swap of smoked paprika for the chipotle powder. Next time I'll use ancho powder and maybe a little smoked paprika. I toasted a scant T of cumin seeds (no powder on hand), and it was fine - I'll try the full T next time. We agreed that it was a bit salty so I'll cut back a teensy bit in the future. The flavors worked beautifully together, and we enjoyed the salmon even more when we drizzled a little sauce over it. Yum!

Very good. The first attempt was made according to the explicit instructions, with no dividing of the chipotle or a reduction in cumin. I liked it a lot, but I do prefer robust flavors and heat. I found my second attempt, however, even better. Here are the general outlines of my second attempt. a.) Toast cumin seeds, and then grind them in a mortar and pestle. You'll likely want less cumin as the flavor is stronger b.) Mix the honey, brown sugar, chipotle, and about 1.5 tablespoons lime juice together, and then cook this mixture over moderate heat until its is well combined and sticky. b.) Use this glaze to top the salmon prior to cooking. c.) Grill the salmon over cedar, which imparts a great smoke flavor to complement the chipotle. Grill until done to your liking d.)Take 1 cup of juice made from blackberries, add some butter, and then reduce the juice over moderate heat in a pan until only about 1/4 cup remains. e.) Top the finished grilled salmon with the reduced berry sauce just before serving. f.) Conclusion: Updated version gets 4 forks.

We loved this recipe. I did take the suggestion of others to decrease the amount of cumin. I also halved the amount of chipotle (it says 'divided' in the recipe which made me think that only half should go in the glaze). We will definitely make this again.

We used half the cumin as suggested earlier. Also, we didn't bother to remove the seeds from the berries, and it was delicious.

Easy and delicious! I brushed the berry glaze on the salmon and then patted on the spice mixture. Pretty presentation with the sauce drizzled on top

My husband really enjoyed this recipe but I thought it was just okay. I really expected the fruit/honey flavor to stand out more than it did but it was way overwhelmed by the cumin. Next time I make it I think I will use less cumin to have more of blend between salty and sweet

The only change I would recommend is that 15 minutes was too long. I tried 12 minutes and will cut to 10 minutes the next time I make it.

I thought this was a great recipe. However, it was to salty for me. Next time I would either cut the salt in half or leave it out. The berry flavor was delicious and a great combination with the salmon. I will definitely make it again.

This is fabulous; wonderful combination of flavors and just the right amount of "kick"! I too, noticed that it said "divided" on the chipotle powder. I put 1/4 teaspoon of it into the reserved sauce, and the rest in the dry rub. But this dish was so great and flavorful with the glaze as it baked, that I found we didn't need the extra sauce. To the cook who wants to know what Chipotle is...chipotle is actually a smoked jalepeno pepper. Commonly, they are found in can, packed in an adobo sauce. The powder is readily available in most spice sections, but you could make your own by purchasing dried peppers and grinding them in a coffee or spice grinder. But don't hesitate to make this recipe...your taste buds will thank you!

What is Chipotle and how do you make your own powder?

Realy enjoyed this. We used fesh blackberries and put a little glaze on just before the salmon was done. I will cut down on the cumin next time it was a bit more than I liked.

I thought this recipe was easy and great. However, either I used too much chipotle powder, or mine is stronger than most because the salmon was overpowered by the chipotle. I notice that the ingredients indicate that the chipotle powder should be "DIVIDED". Normally this means that some is used at one point in the recipe and some used at another point. But I only see the chipotle mentioned once in the directions. So, there may be an error in the recipe. Perhaps some was supposed to go into the rub and some into the sauce?

Delicious... very impressive dinner party dish, with relatively little effort. The one thing I might do differently next time is put the berries in the blender first... pushing them through the sieve took much longer than I expected.

The fruit glaze is incredible & a great compliment to the other flavers of the dish.

I made this for my in-laws on Christmas Eve to rave reviews. The chipotle gave it a little bit of a kick but not so much that I would call it too spicy. The berry glaze helps to mellow it all out. Will be making it again because it could be prepped ahead and tossed in the oven when needed.

To answer your question, I made the recipe with skinless salmon and had no problems whatsoever.

I hate to skew ratings, but I have a question. I'd love to try this recipe, but what can I do about the skin? Is it "safe" to crust the flesh and remove the skin, or will that dry out or burn?

This is a wonderful salmon recipe with an amazing combination of flavors. I have cooked salmon in many ways and I have to say I think this is one of the very best.

This was a great recipe...I used a bit less honey, however. Also...everyone needs to stop with the jabs--you're embarrassing yourselves. This is a great website and it's meant for people who enjoy cooking and sharing ideas on cooking--not a place to air out your insecurities and issues.

OK, so I actually made this recipe and have to tell you it is great!! Not as easy as billed (prep took a bit of time), but well worth the little bit of work. When I first tasted the sauce I thought it was way too sweet, but when paired with the sweet/spicy crust on the salmon it was very yummy. Will print it out and put it in frequent rotation.

I make a similar dish but use Dickinson's marion blackberry preserves: a high quality preserve that makes preparation far easier (though I would probably then skip the honey in this recipe). P.S. Cute, Dylan.

Sounds good. I have a very quick similar recipe that our friends always like. I simply use Fischer & Wieser brand Raspberry Chipotle sauce as a glaze when I cook my salmon. Nothing else needed except a bit of salt. Serve with brown rice or couscous.

The original recipe and the review recipe both sound absolutely delicious. I do have a question about the sea salt though....I am not that familar with cooking with sea salt but I do know that what I can get here comes in coarse or fine. Could you please tell me where I can find information on different sea salts and could people please state what grain they are using?

This is a spin on a recipe that Holli and I are quite fond of. We use Chinook Salmon, aka King [if you don't live on the PC, it might be impossible to find]. I suggest grilling vs. baking the fish top rack at 650 degrees for 4m ps. I also suggest getting everything fresh [blackberries], making your own powders [chipotle], and only using fresh colorful salmon that was semi-frozen on ice vs. commercially. Informed fish mongers can easily advise you as to its history. You should also use 1tsp La fleur de sel [unrefined French sea salt]. This recipe has so many flavors that regular salt will only further mask the fish. Bon A Petit!
