I made this for lunch today for my husband. He loves tortas but it's hard, if not impossible, to find real torta rolls (birrote) outside of Mexico. I used a crusty mini artisan loaf and it worked out fine. I also toasted the cut sides of the bread with a little butter on the griddle. Substituted chipotles in adobo for the jalapenos, otherwise, made as is. Next time will add some queso fresco.

Really good! I will be making again. I did not add a 1/4 cup of lard. A swirl of EVOO will do for me. Otherwise did exactly as the recipe said.

Used chipotle instead of jalapeño, and mayo, it was very tasty !!!

This was very tasty the way I made it: red beans instead of pinto beans, because that's all they had at the store, no cilantro, and I mashed the avocado, because my family prefers guacamole to avocado slices. I was pleasantly surprized by the radishes, nice kick, and the sandwich in general. Oh, I also added several splashes of hot pepper sauce just to my sandwich and omitted the jalapenos from my wife's and child's sandwiches: everyone was happy.

I forgot to add that I used canned refried beans instead of making my own.
