Really good tart and relatively easy! I used whole wheat pastry flour for the crust, and substituted goat milk yogurt for the sour cream, and cut down on the butter by adding less to the polenta mixture. I also added sliced zucchini and red onion to the mushrooms. Also, let the tart sit after baking for a least a half hour, it will help the polenta set firmly. More veggies are definitely a plus! My fiance loved it!

This is one of the best tarts I have ever made! I made my own whole spelt crust and forgot to add the butter to the polenta mixture (a VERY good mishap). The dish most definitely had a WOW factor. Used 3/4 of a cup of dry polenta and made it in the microwave with about 2 1/2 cups of instant vegetable broth, which was plenty of liquid

I was also confused about how much polenta to use. I made the recipe and used 1 cup of polenta. The flavor was excellent, but the tart never set properly. I think I will use 3 cups next time and see what happens.

I am just a bit confused with the quantity of polenta needed. The ingredients list sayd "for 1 cup cooled prepared polenta:", but in the preparation instructions it says that the quantity listed "Males about 3 cups." My question is: Does the tart require 1 cup or 3 cups of prepared polenta?

Very tasty dish - a bit too buttery. I like the suggestion to add sun dried tomatoes to the mushroom mixture. I will definately try that next time.

I made this to cut into squares and serve as an appetizer--big mistake, the mushrooms are loose in the bottom of the pan, it falls apart. I thought it was bland and tasteless besides. Out of 8 people at the dinner party, only one liked it. A disaster!

Yummy, yummy, yummy! I've made this recipe a few times, each time with a slight variation. So far, the best additions are chopped sundried tomatoes and roasted red peppers added to the mushroom mixture. A little rosemary is a nice change too. As for the pie crust, Pillsbury ready made crust works well.

Fabulous recipe. I did it in a 9" round tart pan and used a mix of white, shitake, and dried mushrooms, and added shallots for a little more flavor. It came out great, although I might use even more mushrooms next time. I put the polenta and goat cheese through my food mill, much easier than forcing through a sieve or grater. I served it as a side dish with lamb chops and it got raves.

I loved this recipe. I subsituted cream cheese for the goat cheese and it still turned out great!

This was fabulous. I took many shortcuts: used Nancy's frozen piecrust (yummy), blended the filling in the cuisinart (except for the mushrooms), came out great and was much easier than the sieve method.

This has become one of our regular dinner menus for my husband and myself. We cheat a little by using the prepared pie crust that you roll out. We usually warm half of it for another dinner and, granted it's not as good, but it's still good enough. I am planning to make this for a small group of ladies coming over next week along with a green salad and brownies for dessert.

This was fantastic served with a mixed green salad with a dressing of mustard, oil, vinegar and salt. A white wine and peasnt bread made it a complete meal.
