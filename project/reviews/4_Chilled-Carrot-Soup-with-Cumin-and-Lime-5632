delicious, healthy, and pretty easy too. I liked this soup much more when it was hot, and my husband agreed. Try it both ways!

This was excellent. I made it for my sister who is recovering from a stem cell transplant and is not allowed to eat anything raw. I cooked the lime juice and zest for her, and we used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream ( she is allowed pasteurized yogurt). She was so happy to have cold vegetable soup on a hot night. Now I'm going to make it for the rest of my family.

This was fantastic! The only changes I made was to add Salt and Pepper despite using regular chicken broth, not low-salt. We didn't have enough sour cream to use as a garnish, and we didn't miss it. I did add the 6 Tablespoons as directed earlier in the recipe.

pretty good. i modified a bit by adding ginger and honey, and used greek yogurt instead of sour cream. after it cooled i added more cumin to increase the flavor. my guests and i agreed that the cilantro overpowered the recipe -- we like cilantro but when i make this again i'll skip it.

Don't have a microwave at work and needed something different. This chilled soup was great. Used half jalapeno, without seeds and minced, instead of red pepper flakes and used my own veggie broth. The outcome was terrific. Also did not puree all the carrots, really liked the added texture.

This soup deserves its four fork exceptional rating. It says to serve cold, but was also good right off the stove top with sour cream before any chilling. But, the epicurean Gods frown upon eating the recipe this way, and rightly so. After a good bout of chilling, this soup is a m a z i n g. Loved it, as did my boyfriend and a couple of friends. The only changes made were to use less and lighter sour cream, and a mixture of chives and cilantro (wanted to get rid of some left over herbs) as a garnish. The soup was great without the extra sour cream on top and garnishes, but the cilantro really was a nice complement to the cumin and carrot. Looking forward to making this again when both the weather and I am in the mood for a cold soup.

I loved the mix of flavors in this perfect-for-summer soup. I added about 2 Tbsp of honey per the recommendation of other reviewers, and I substituted 1/4 tsp cayenne for the crushed red pepper. I think this needs some salt, too. I served this with homemade croutons on top and can't wait to have leftovers again this evening. Great recipe!

This soup was a big hit at my recent book club luncheon! I made a few changes based on other reviews (reduced the crushed red pepper and added a little honey). Don't leave out the lime peel as a garnish. It adds some very pleasant "zing" to the flavour. Really yummy. With the leftovers I decided that a little grated fresh ginger might be nice in it... and it was! Double yummy!

This is delicious. I used low-fat Breakstone Sour Cream and it didn't taste like it was missing anything. Everyone loved it.

Fantastic summer soup. Our guests all loved it. I used a little less red pepper flakes and spiced it up a bit with Floyd's Famous Hot Lime Sauce (available on the web at www.hotlime.com/home.htm). Mmmm. We were unsure what wine to serve with it and went with the wine shop's recommendation of a Leitz Dragonstone dry riesling. It was a terrific match.

When I read this recipe I really didn't think it'd turn out this well but other people's reviews convinced me to try it. I just made this and it was fabulous! I still have four more pounds of carrots to get rid of so I might be making it again before the week's up... I have a temporary aversion to garlic since I'm pregnant but the soup was awesome even without it. I used cayenne instead of red pepper flakes since I'm out of those. But otherwise followed the recipe exactly and was pleasantly surprised!

I love this soup and make it regularly year round - serving it hot or cold, depending on the season. Over time I've riffed on the recipe. Two variations worth passing on: 1- I sometimes use a combo of whole cumin that I pound a little in w/ a mortar and pestle. 2- I frequently add red lentils to this. It beefs it up and makes it a great main course.

I quite liked it and many guests did, too. My husband thought it would be better warm. I served it on a buffet table in a bowel lined with ice.

At first I was unsure about this soup. The cumin flavor was a bit over-whelming. Day two, I thinned it a bit with water. What a difference! Delicious!

What a great, versatile basic soup recipe! Lovely texture and flavor. My spouse, a confirmed cream soup hater, loved it and called it Refreshing. A vegetable smoothie. Golly, never thought of that! Thanks to Milwaukee (07/22/07) for the honey suggestion. I added about four tablespoons of strong, wild honey; it really improved the flavor. Also, thanks to all who suggested substituting yogurt for the sour cream. It freshened it, and kept it on the light side. My twist on the recipe: I added about two teaspoons of grated, fresh ginger and, since I didnt have any limes (they were 1 Euro per fruit!), I used lemon juice and zest. Like San Antonio (03/12/99), Id slightly reduce both the red pepper and cumin next go-round, then add to taste at the end. Some guests felt that the soup was a bit too spicy. Last, as with all soups, do try to make it the day before. While I had it on the table three hours after putting it together (after cooling it in an ice bath), the flavors today were substantially improved. I'll be anxious to tweak it in the future and see what other combinations I can come up with. Orange juice and curry, anyone?

The soup is way too hot with the red pepper flakes.

Like others, I served this cold (on a HOT summer day) and warm in the Fall with crusty bread. I replaced the sour cream with yogurt-- I prefer the tart, tanginess. Loving cumin, I cranked that up and LOVED it. This one is a KEEPER!

Like the previous reviewer, we also made this as a starter to the Salmon with Lime Butter recipe, and then finished the meal with Mini Lime Pies with Glazed Berries. The three went very well together, especially as the lime gave a refreshing edge to the whole summer meal. The soup was equally good warm (day 1) and cold (day 2). We will definitely make this again... in any season!

I decided to make this for dinner at the last minute to serve with the Grilled Salmon with Lime Butter recipe (on this site), so we had Lukewarm Carrot Soup instead of Chilled. Even the lukewarm version was good. And it definitely serves more than 4--8 at least. We had enough left over that I'll be able to have it again the way it's intended--chilled--and I'm sure it will be just as good.

I made a vegetarian version of this recipe by subbing vegetable bouillon (in water) for the chicken stock. The substitution worked fine... a satisfying summer dish.

This soup was a hit at the fine dining restaurant where I work. I only made a few changes... I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream for a more fresh taste. I also added some honey to offset the hot pepper and cumin. Delightful summer soup!

EXCELLENT! So delicious for a hot summer night. The lime lets it keep well for a few days, too. Sex it up by swirling in a tablespoon of heavy cream instead of sour cream. Serve with some spiced nuts on the side and wow. Kids like this soup too!

soup was very good and easy to make - carrot chopping the hardest part, a lot of the ease came from using an immersion blender. Also added a parsnip for a sweet, nutty flavor.

This is yummy. At what point can you freeze this soup...before or after adding the sour cream?

I served this for the soup course at a dinner party last night, and everyone just loved it! It's easy (especially with a bag of peeled carrots from Costco!), great texture, splendid and complex flavors, freezes well, and pretty! What's not to like? Don't leave out the garnishes.....and put the sour cream in a squeeze bottle (like they do in restaurant kitchens) and get creative with fun designs!

Outstanding cold soup. Very smooth. I thought the 4 servings listed seemed too few as it made quite a bit, but we ate it as such. One of those things that get better as you eat it. I think the garnishes, especially the zest, are imperative. As he ate some for his lunch a couple of days after I served it at dinner, my husband said, "You know it must be good. I never eat leftover soup."

Wow! I really liked this recipe, so full of flavor - I had some baby carrots getting a bit old in my fridge and decided to use them. I used curry powder instead of cumin and onion instead of leeks and the results were amazing. If you don't use the sour cream it is a really healthy dish too!

I have made this soup more than 20 times- it is a hit always, hot or cold - with more cumin, or less cumin - and don't forget the lime zest with the sour cream - it looks very pretty. A cook from Montreal

Our family loved this soup. I served it as part our Christmas dinner and everyone enjoyed it so much that I will definitely make it again. I cheated and used a two pound bag of baby carrots. It made the preparation a breeze!

This is, ( I am afraid to use the cliche) a definite keeper. It could be served cold or warm. In fall I plan to add some butternut squash and maybe an apple. I also added some coriander.

My husband tasted this soup and matter-of-factly stated, "This is good. It's a '4 forker.'" Then he asked if the recipe came from epicurious. I added more red pepper flakes and forgot to add the lime juice, but it was still delicious.

My friend took this soup to a picnic in a thermos - it was exquisite in the forest - and would be just as delicious at a dinner party. I adored this soup!

The taste of this soup is good, but the texture is outstanding. I've never had something quite so creamy with so few high-fat ingredients. A confirmed cold soup hater asked for the recipe! The only caveat I have is to watch the amount of cumin. I love cumin and cook with it a lot, but I reduced the amount to 1 1/2 teaspoons and was quite happy with the result.
