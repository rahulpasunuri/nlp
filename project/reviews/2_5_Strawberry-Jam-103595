The recipe doesn't clearly state that the temperature of the liquid needs to hit 221 degrees farenheit. It won't set up into jam unless it first hits that temp. That is a temp for sugar to begin to set. Boiling for 40 minutes isn't enough. The temperature is key.

I am from North Carolina we use an apple quartered added in and then cook till the juice strings. Then remove the apple and then can. This is per a strawberry farmers wife. This was the first time I had made perserves ever and it was great

I was disappointed with this recipe... despite cooking it down for over 40 mins, it was runny and "syrupy". Okay for ice cream, but messy when you're craving toast and jam! When I "jam" I always make extra for friends, but this is one recipe I won't be giving out.

Ethan and I canned from this recipe, but instead of cooking it down for forty minutes, we pulled it from the heat and skimmed at 20 minutes and added the lemon juice. The result? The MOST wonderful strawberry topping we've ever tasted. Simple, and absolutely perfect over vanilla ice cream. We've given jars as gifts, and all agree it's great.

When you add sugar to fruit, it brings the natural liquid to the surface. Add heat and this process is sped up. That is where the liquid for boiling comes from.

I was unaware that I could "boil" just sugar and fruit. I always had thought you need liquid to boil. Way to go Susan Herrman Loomis!

I have not made this recipe but from I undertand of jamming that when you make it without any added pectin you should be sure some of the berries are a bit underripe for a better result. I myself always use Pomonas Pectin (usually found at health food stores) because you can make jams with less suger. A pound of sugar for each pound of berries????

I cooked this for over one hour and all I got was Strawberry syrup. Where's the pectin supposed to come from, Uranus?
