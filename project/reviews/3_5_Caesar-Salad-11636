This is delicious and so easy! There's nothing like fresh caesar dressing. I wouldn't change a thing although I do think you could reduce the salt by half and add more if you thought it needed it. I used an entire head of romain and my husband and i ate everything up! I would double the romain next time - I don't like my salad too heavily dressed and the dressing is rich and tangy. Enjoy!

Go to favorite dressing...simple and delicious. Followed others suggestions by not using the water. Added extra anchovies. Perfect with grilled chicken breasts & crusty bread for light dinner.

On behalf of every pregnant Caesar salad lover out there, THANK YOU! I don't know how I would make it through 9.5 months without delicious Caesar salad. This ranks up there with my own special "non pregnant" version with raw eggs. Excellent!

Yummy. The mayo adds creaminess that the raw egg yolk otherwise would provide (and is made w/ egg yolks). I skipped the water - can't imagine why you would want it.

ok, nothing fabulous. It's odd to use mayo and less oil. Since mayo is 99% oil anyway, why bother with mayo and just use regualr olive oil! also needs more garlic and pepper.

I have made it numerous times but it seems to curdle. I think the first time was incredible...any suggestions?

I have been making this since it was first published ages ago. I have never not been asked for the recipe when I serve this for company. It is nice all year, but especially in the summer when I just throw grilled chicken or shrimp on top for a super easy, but still very nice, meal.

This was great! Do use a mini-chopper if you have one. This was very light and way better than anything we've bought in the store!

I have made this 3 times. The 1st time I added the ingredients (mustard, worcestershire) that the others recommended and another time without. Both ways are good, but the extra ingredients cut down on the fishyness moreso. It was quick, easy and delicious. This rates better than the thick, creamy, yucky ones in restaurants. Oh! I left out the water and used my small Cuisinart. I also advise refrigerating it before serving. It compliments the romaine much better than pouring it on at room temperature. Yum!

Good recipe. I used egg yolks instead of mayonnasie, added dry mustard and Worcestershire. It's easier to use a food processor. I wouldn't put ANY water in until the end. I think it's only use is in facilitating using a blender. If, at the end, you want it looser, put water in then.

Yum! Garlicky and lemony, and very easy. I had to shake my blender around while blending because there wasn't enough bulk to blend by itself, so next time I'll probably double the recipe and keep the extra in the fridge. Also, I love pan-frying croutons in olive oil with garlic, salt, and herbs, since I always overbake mine in the oven and they turn out dry and rock-hard. Pan-frying keeps them softer and also makes the kitchen smell amazing!

This recipe was a very good base, but it needed some tinkering to make it great. I followed other reader's suggestions and added dijon mustard and a dash or two of worcestershire sauce. I also put in a 1/4 tsp cracked pepper. I'll definitely make this again, but will continue to tinker with the ingredients to get it exactly right.

much better than anything you could by in a jar....and very easy to make. refreshing and lemony.....and roast the garlic in the olive oil and then lighty pan-fry thinly sliced chicken breast in the oil. mix and you have a delicious salad for dinner....soooo good.

A Caesar purist, I've always made my dressing with raw eggs. I was skeptical when I saw mayonnaise in this recipe, but it is really great. This has become my standard Caesar - I make it all the time. It's very easy. Between the anchovies and parmesan, I find the salad is flavorful enough without the additional salt. I also generally omit the water for a thicker dressing.

This is the best caesar I've had and we're caesar fans. I've made it four times in two weeks. I do extra garlic, anchovies and parmesan and used really good bread for the croutons, but make it for us without them. Leftovers keep beautifully

Definitely a keeper! I added two tablespoons of red wine vinegar and it was a great addition to the dressing.

Excellent recipe! I always make this one day ahead of when I will use it as I find the flavor more tasty. This recipe makes more than enough dressing for a salad for 4 people. My husband loves having a container of this in the fridge. The blender makes this a breeze so I make this often. Guests always think it is a nice treat.

Nice, but I prefer the caesar dressing given in the "finger caesar salad" receipe on this site. S

Thought it was good and simple to make. Have made it a few times and people loved it. Adding more garlic and a bit more parmesan cheese works well for the family. Also added some blackened salmon strips (but cut back on the cheese) and it turned out good. Also worked with seared tuna.

Husband and guest liked it or so they said! I liked it. I added chicken to the salad - baked it smothered in a Ken's bottled caesar dressing because I didn't have enough homemade dressing, but it was still good. My only complaint is that the hot chicken wilted the lettuce. I would advise to give the chicken (if you add it) some cool down time. Dressing might have been a bit too garlicky. Next time will try it with roasted garlic.

This was a very easy recipe. I threw everything into my food processor and it was done in no time. I did take the advise of another cook and added a bit of worcestershire sauce and mustard. I also marinated chicken breasts in part of the dressing and cooked them on the grill. This recipe makes plenty of dressing for a very large salad and marinade for the chicken as well.

If I was to rate this recipe on its own merit, it would only be 2 forks. I increased on the garlic, added worcestershire sauce and Dijon mustard, parmesan and lots of salt and pepper. I liked this recipe for the fact that there was not alot of oil used and the mayo replaced the egg. I will repeat this recipe..with my modifications

Delicious - also added dijon, grilled chicken and lots of parm. My husband loved this more with each bite, and he's definitely not a Caesar fan.

This is a great recipe, especially eliminating the egg for mayo! Instead of flat anchovies I use anchovy paste, I also add a few dashes of worcestershire sauce and 1/2 tsp dry mustard. Instead of mayo, I use low fat miracle whip. I put all the ingredients in the blending cup of the Braun hand blender (canola oil is poured in last) and I blend until smooth. A real winner!

I have been in search of the perfect caesar salad for the past ten years. Although I'll never give up the search, this one comes very close to perfect. I marinated a couple of boneless chicken breasts in italian dressing and put them under the broiler (too cold out to grill now), and it made the perfect chicken caesar salad. I have definitely added this to my permanant recipe file.

A couple of interesting things about this recipe. For one, mayonnaise is used as a substitute for the coddled egg in the classic recipe. For another, the anchovies are blended with the dressing rather than being layed on the top of the salad. I was in a hurry to make the croutons, so I used frozen white bread to cut into cubes (worked well) and sprayed them with Pam and dusted them with garlic salt before baking. They turned out delicious. My 12-year-old son gobbled up the salad, blended anchovies and all.

I put all the ingredients together in a deep glass measuring cup (did not chop or add salt) and placed in the refrigerator while preparing the meal (2 hrs). Then right before serving, mixed using a Braun gravy/milkshake mixer. (I also added a dash of Worchester sauce and a dash of Dijon.) It was delicious and definitely a winner for a dinner party!

This is an awesome Ceasar Salad recipe. You have to make it with the anchovies otherwise it just doesn't have that great taste.

I have used this recipe since it originally came out in the magazine. Then I lost it. I felt like I had found an old friend when it turned up again.

One of the very best & easiest Caesar salads I have ever made. I double the recipe (That was I alsways have some on hand) & don't add the water. I find if I wash the romaine & just pat it dry that the water remaining on the leaves is just the right amount to mix with the dressing.
