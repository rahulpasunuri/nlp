we found this to be really delicious. Instead of clam juice, I used a can of chicken broth and the shrimp shells then finished with butter. Served with pasta and steamed broccoli. Will definitely make again - easy and very tasty.

Clam juice is carried in most big grocery stores. It comes in a jar. Try Kroger or Plublics, if you have one.

Will definitely double the sauce next time. Used lots more garlic than required. Needs some heat..either red pepper flakes at end or minced hot peppers during cooking. Threw in a bit of butter at the end. I understand the real recipe uses lime wedges and cilantro at the end and may try that next time.

How on earth is one to find "Clam juice"???

We love traditional camarones de ajo, but alas, we're watching our waistlines and our heart health so we gave this alternative a try. I used the juice from chopped clams, but reserved the clams to add at the end. I also used 1/2 white wine 1/2 clam juice for the first half of the recipe, adding shrimp shells, garlic, and red pepper flakes to the other ingredients. Finished the recipe by first sauteing sliced onions, then adding shrimp, and clams went in with the wine. I highly recommend using the chopped clams. Needed a slurry of arrowroot to thicken, and couldn't resist a half Tbl of butter to finish. As good as the real thing, perfect over pasta, too!

I followed the recipe to the letter and it was just okay. Won't make it again.

I made this with 1 C clam juice (ran out) and supplemented the other 1/2 c with white wine. I used italian seasoning and added about a tbsp of red pepper flakes. Didn't use olive oil (used spray) and i used 5 garlic cloves + 4 TBSP of white wine. This was awesome, it was spicy and flavorful, and i served it with some brown rice. Next time I might double the sauce because it was really tasty. :) i give it 3.5 forks.

I added a little sugar, red pepper flakes and used 2 cups clam juice. I also doubled the white wine and added a tbl of butter and some pepper to wine and then it was delicious!

This was seriously vile. I'm surprised it's still up on the Epicurious website. We followed the directions to a T and it was really, really awful. Tasteless and inedible.

Excellent! Enjoyed the strong garlic taste. Very easy to prepare.

This recepi does not even come close to the original recepi made in Mexico. Emeril has an excellent recepi

It was quick but nothing special. My boyfriend liked it, but didn't LOVE it. There are so many other shrimp recipes on this site, that I wouldn't bother with this one again.

As a fanatic for Camerones Al Mojo De Ajo down in Mexico, fresh from the Sea of Cortez I am a difficult judge. THis recipe was nice however the clam juice left a distinct aftertaste that I will temper next time with at least 1/2 chicken broth and definately some butter. Another MUST is to at least double (I quadrupled it) the GARLIC! Aside from that, this was a nice meal.

I adored this recipe. I put the shrimp and sauce over whole wheat pasta, and it was very good. The clam juice grossed me out slightly, but I'm glad I soldiered on. :)

Definately a keeper. Did what the previous reviewers suggested and used chicken broth and shrimp shells intead of clam juice. Wonderful on saffron rice. My only complaint? I wanted MORE shrimp!

A friend introduced this on to me and it is one of my favorites...I make it often. I prepare it exactly as it is written and serve it fajita style with grilled chicken, sour cream, cheddar cheese, etc.

I made this for my mom for Mother's Day dinner. She loved it! This is the second time I've made this dish. The first time I made it I used chicken broth cooked with the shrimp shells. It turned out just as yummy as the clam juice. I will make this as much as I can! :)

Flavorful, easy, healthy -- who could ask for more?! This is a great weeknight meal because it comes together quickly. I served it over brown Basmati rice and accompanied it with a salad and crusty rolls. I'll definitely make this again.

Loved this recipe! Didn't have any clam juice so followed Chris J's solution below. Very simple, very tapas. It will be a regular favorite this summer.

Absolutely incredible!!!! possibly the best meal I have ever cooked, no lie. Simple to make and very tasty. I used chicken broth with the shells and a bay leaf(small), reduced a little longer, and served over saffron rice to sop up the juice. served with steamed zuchs and squash. Excellent!

The second time I made this I served it over pasta so I doubled the sauce and added mushrooms and onions to the shrimp. Instead of using clam juice I used chicken broth and added the shrimp shells with the broth, tomato paste, onion and oregano. The sauce has such a unique and flavorful taste.

Excellent tasting dish. I served it with Spanish rice and a zucchini, shallot, garlic, and mushroom saute. It was delicious! I'll definitely make it again, maybe with scallops next time.
