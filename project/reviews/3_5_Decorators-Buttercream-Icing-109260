I made a "rainbow" birthday cake using this recipe, splitting into 6 colors. I made 4 layers of white cake and split them horizontally, frosting them thinly with each color. I had enough for the whole thing plus some cupcakes out of each color, but I had to make one more 1/3 batch to do white around the outside. It turned out beautifully, and while everyone originally commented on the "rainbow" slice effect, afterwards many were raving about the *flavor* of the frosting, which is just delicious. Usually I'm all about the cake and skip the nasty frosting, but I love this frosting and I'm saving the recipe for all future birthday cake projects.

The first time I made this, I curdled the frosting as I mixed the still hot syrup with the egg. (You really have to make sure the syrup is completely boiled). The second time it was amazing!!!! It went beautifully with a white cake and gave it much more flavor.....I will try it on many other cakes in the future!

This is incredibly rich icing, and a bit overpowering for both myself and the cake I made it for. Delicious, but I'd definitely make less of it and use a bit less sugar next time!

Normally I don't indulge or care for icing, but this recipe sparked the icing monster in me. It was the best icing I have tasted. It does make a lot of icing so I was glad that I halved the recipe.

I freeze this all the time. One recipe lasts me a while, and I'd hate to toss something so delicious! It freezes like a charm ;)

Has anyone frozen this icing? I am making 200+ cupcakes for a wedding that I am also standing up in and want to do as much work ahead of time as possible. Any suggestions?

Great stuff. I used lemon and vanilla both....not too sweet, tastes great. Comes out a whole lot fluffier with hi ratio shortening!

I've experimented with several other buttercream recipes this month. I liked this one the best! The texture and consistency were perfect. I used vanilla extract and will try the lemon juice next time to try something different. Overall, it really made the difference on my chocolate ginger cake.

This is the texture I was searching for in a buttercream frosting. It's very light AND, and this is the tough part, it actually holds up in the tropical heat of Hawaii. I like the flavor of all butter frosting better but it's a good trade-off to get a frosting that doesn't wilt. I'll try tweaking the flavors a bit, but I will definitely make this or some variation of this, again.

I was searching for the perfect topping to my daughter's birthday cupcakes and I found it! It held up in the weather, and got rave reviews. I used 1/2 cup skim milk (what I had) with a tbsp of water. I used a little under 3 pounds powdered sugar (again what I had on hand). I think the salt is the key to keeping it from being too sweet. I also used vanilla extract. I will make this again and again!

I tried this buttercream recipe this afternoon, for use on a chocolate layer cake. Not only was it the most simple buttercream frosting that I have ever made, but the taste and the consistency are fantastic. Very easy to work with. For the liquid, I used 50% water and 50% orange liqueur. I normally make frosting out of just a meringue powder and powdered sugar, but never again.

I use this buttercream quite often when I make cakes for people and it's quite good. Not as sweet as what you find on grocery store cakes, but still has a familiar taste to most people, but just a little more sophisticated. I agree that if you want it less sweet to use the lemon juice, but I usually just go with vanilla extract. I use this when I am making cakes for kids parties or when I need a crusting buttercream for special cake designs. For a really sophisticated taste I use Toba Garrett's French Vanilla buttercream. I get nothing but compliments when I use it.

I took a class from Toba in NY at the Institute for Culinary Education. She suggested flavoring this icing with lemon juice or almond extract, NOT vanilla, as she said the vanilla enhanced the sweetness while the lemon juice cut it. Regarding the added liquid, she said you didn't have to choose milk OR water OR clear liqueur, but could combine them as you like e.g., 2-3 oz clear liqueur with the rest milk and water. The salt is also important to cut the sweetness. This icing is good for decorating with, but in the class we mostly used the swiss meringue buttercream which is easy and delicious and can take a variety of different additions for flavoring. That recipe is also on Epicurious -- I'd use that instead but it is more expensive to make. Toba is great, and her recipes are well tested and overall - try them.

We made this buttercream in culinary school and I did not like it at all. WAY too sweet! Try Collette Peters recipe which is almost identical to the recipe on the Dominoes Confectioner's sugar box except that Collette adds a bit of salt which enhances the flavor.

I bake several times a week, and this frosting is not as good as the most simplistic frosting on the bag or box of sugar. Horrifically sweet, and I like sweet!

Everything you'd expect buttercream to be. It tastes good and is easy to work with.
