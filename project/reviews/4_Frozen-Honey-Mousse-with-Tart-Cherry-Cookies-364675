The mousse is great - you get a really wonderful honey flavor, which surprised me given how little honey is in it. The cookies need a little work: they were very greasy, and they spread into one gigantic "brittle blob" on my cookie sheet. I broke the brittle into pieces and that worked out fine. The salt and crunch is fantastic with the mousse but I'm going to tweak the recipe a bit to get less buttery mess.

Oh my. This was a little bit of work but worth it. The mousse is airy and delicious, although a little too sweet for my taste. The cookies are crispy and sweet. The only changes I would make would be to pulse the dry cookie ingredients a couple times in the food processor for a finer chop, that way they'll look more like the picture, and I would double the cookie recipe because your family will nibble them away before the mousse is frozen!

Both recipes sound really good and I will try them, but I think the photograph is terrible. You really have to look close to figure out what it is. Many food stylists, food photographers and editors get carried away with the art of the photo and forget that readers want to see what the recipe should really look like.

I have no idea about the cookies, but the frozen honey mousse is fantastic. Served it with almond cake and sliced nectarines for desert at my Dad's birthday dinner. About to make again with nonfat Greek yogurt instead of cream and pistachios instead of almonds.
