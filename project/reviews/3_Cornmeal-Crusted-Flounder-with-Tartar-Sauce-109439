The fish was tasty. The tartar sauce was delicious.

Cornmeal crusting was okay but I had a hard time keeping it on the fish. After it was cooked, the crusting too easily fell off.

This is my favorite way to make fried fish. I've used flounder, grouper, and mahi. All come out moist and cooked perfectly. I find that the fish takes longer than 4 minutes to cook though, maybe 8 to 10 minutes. I follow the recipe for the fish exactly, but I improvise on the tartar with whatever I have on hand. This time, I did not have the herbs or shallots so I left them out and still the tartar was perfect. It really makes the fish zing and is a nice contrast to the crunchy, browned cornmeal breading.

The tartar sauce was good, however the flounder was both too complicated to make and lacked flavor. It also came apart in the pan when frying and turned into a crumpled mess. This recipe would be better with a firmer less delicate textured fish. It also made way too much tartar sauce for the amount of fish.

Nothing all that new or spectacular about the flour-egg-cornmeal dredge, but WOW, the tartar sauce was sensational! I've never liked commercial tartar sauce, but this stuff I just ate straight from the bowl. I didn't have pickle relish and so just chopped up a bit of pickle instead. Mmmmm-good!

My English boyfriend thought it was out of this world (he even put some vinegar on his). Personally I found the crust a little too crusty, but that is probably because I used cornstarch instead of flour (it does work for awesome for eggplant, but apparently not for this recipe). Next time I will follow the recipe exactly.

I'm rating this recipe at 4 forks because I've made it 3 times in the last month, and I never make any recipe that frequently. I just love it, and so does my whole family. However, I have substituted different fish because of the unavailability of flounder in my area. The first time I tried this dish I used tilapea, which was a bit tough after the hot oil bath. The second time I switched to small catfish filets. Absolute heaven. Tonight I used large, really large, catfish filets. These had to be cooked for a long time before they would flake nicely and in the end the cornmeal became a bit too cooked. So I would highly suggest, as a substitution, small filets of catfish. I was also really happy with the crust when I used fine cornmeal rather than regular cornmeal.

Tarter sauce is great. Go light on the cornmeal unless you like lots of breading on your fish.

Fried Fish isn't exactly brain surgery, but this recipe worked really well. We ate it with the Dandelion Salad with Hazelnut vinaigrette. The bitterness of the salad really complemented the fried food.
