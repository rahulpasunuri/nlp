My first time making matzo balls - i followed the recipe exactly (except i only had 1/2 the leeks on hand) and the result was delicious. The consistency was perfect, not too soft, not too hard. The family loved them. They were a mess to make but well worth it. Would definitely make again.

I don't understand the complaints from previous reviews. They were an excellent tasty modernization of the traditional.

Just served this dish for Passover this year along with the brisket and it was a huge hit. I took heed after reading a couple of these reviews and really reduced the chicken stock to concentrate the flavor and added chopped onions as well as the leeks. Also folded in eggs very carefully so that mixture stayed light. These will become a new tradional at our Seder.

Totally yummy and tender. This was the first time I've ever made matzo balls and they came out great. Don't be afraid to try them. I made them 1 day ahead and reheated in the oven.

I thought these were simply awful. Maybe you have to grow up on them to appreciate their terrible flavor. The brisket, however, was excellent.

I loved these with the brisket, it was a perfect accompaniment. I dipped them in the drippings of the brisket. Ah, yummy, will definatley make again.

If it were an option, I would give this zero forks! I made these as part of the whole menu for Passover (Bon Appetit, April 2002) and was very disappointed. Part of the reason might be that the rest of the menu was so fantastic. The matzo balls were gummy and lacked flavor. I was embarassed to have served them.

I dirtied almost every pot and bowl in my kitchen, but it was worth it. Because I had vegetarian guests, I used vegitable broth instead of chicken broth. For the non-vegetarians I seved them with a boat of chicken gravey on the side. Delicious.
