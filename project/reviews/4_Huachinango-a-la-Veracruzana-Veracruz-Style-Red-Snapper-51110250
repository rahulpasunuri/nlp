I love ordering this in restaurants when I (used to) find it. Using the basic proportions of fish, tomatoes, and onions, I used what I had on hand for a really good dinner. That's exactly what I was trying to do when I came to the site! If you are considering this recipe, don't be intimidated. Feel free to change it up! I used generic green olives, skipped the capers, jalapenos, and raisins (would have used dried currants), added some shredded carrot, chopped celery, and diced pasilla pepper for extra veg. I used cilantro and no potato -- we had it over brown rice instead. A sprinkle of toasted tortilla chip crumbs (you know, from the end of the bag? save them!) was a nice crunchy garnish. It's a great way to prep those convenient and healthy frozen fish fillets. Or a whole fish... your choice!
