Can't believe this doesn't have more review - big hit for brunch at our house.

We wanted to try a new brunch recipe for 7 houseguests. We made it the night before and refrigerated it... that part seemed to work well. The blend of flavors are good and no flavor is overpowering for just about anyones palate. Plan on serving something else with this recipe or assume that each individual will be eating two portions.

This was quite good and I would definitely make it again if I were serving it for a brunch party. However, in terms of bang for the buck in terms of effort, I would say that there are much faster and easier ways for accomplishing something just as tasty. In terms of this recipe, I recommend significantly increasing the amount of ham used and also be very careful about the amount of liquid remaining in any ingredients (spinach or othewise) that you may add. One user commented on having successfully used skim milk + cheese and I would advise against this unless you need to substitute based upon the ingredients on hand. You're much more likely to have a runny dish if you use skim milk. All in all I would say this is a good recipe but I think I'm still hunting for other perfect brunch recipes!

Fantastic flavors. A show stopper. Spinach really shines through and everything just comes together perfectly. Would advise taking out of oven a minute or two before done as the carry over cooking will finish it for you. Can't wait to make it again with variations. Delish!

This is a great recipe. I did not have spinach and used maitake mushrooms and tomatoes, diced, instead. I put more ham in to give it a little more foundation and cooked with two eggs in each earthenware cocotte.

This recipe was fantastic! This was really easy to make and made for an impressive dish at brunch! The ham didn't come thru as obvious however. Next time, I'l either use prociutto or more ham. A really delicious recipe!!! Can't wait to make it again!

I made it as is. Served with a side of creamy grits ala Edna Lewis and I would say it serves 4 rather than 8.

So delicious! I served a variation of this at a brunch a few weeks ago and it was a total hit. I combined this recipe with a few other variations from the site. For the bottom layer I kept the creamed spinach. Above that I put sauteed mushrooms with truffle oil, followed by sharp cheddar cheese and the egg, which I topped with a little grated parmesan. I made 12 ramekins for 6 people - and they were all eaten. It was great to make for a crowd since it all came out at the same time - way easier than timing pancakes or eggs to order.

Delicious and savoury! I didn't want to use ham, so I substituted 6 bay scallops per person and sauteed them lightly (for about 1 minute on med-high heat) in garlic butter - reserve on side and stack on top of veggies in ramekin. Instead of spinach, I used watercress as I had some lying around. To that, I added about 1 tbsp of chopped parsley. I also added a touch of herbs to provence to the liquid. I used skim milk instead of cream - but to increase fat content, I added some grated cheese that I had on hand (Brebis Abbaye de Belloc) on top of th e veggies, just under the egg when stacking - just before the oven step. Note that you should skip the salt if adding cheese, as the cheese itself is quite salty.

Magnificent! I substituted Dean's Lite French Onion dip, skim milk and Adobe garlic seasoning for the cream and garlic and seasonings, and fresh asparagus for the spinach. Fantastic! Jan Grow

I served this lovely recipe for a New Years Day brunch and it was a smashing hit. Easy to prepare, savory and delicious. I will be making it again!

Excellent, easy to prepare! Can put together a day ahead and cook next morning. Great with buttermilk biscuits; however, I would allow for 2 servings per person.
