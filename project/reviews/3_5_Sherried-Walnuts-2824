I've always wanted to try sherried walnuts and never thought I could do it. But this recipe works great! I didn't have sherry, so I substituted a light rum. Just as yummy, just a little different. I toasted the walnuts in the saucepan for a few minutes while I was measuring all the ingredients. And to help with the time crunch to separate all the walnuts before they cooled, I dumped just a few at a time onto the sheet, while leaving the rest in the warm saucepan, which gave me a lot more time work with. I LOVE this recipe!

I have been hunting for this recipe since it first came out. I made it and it was a great hit. But after Christmas, I threw out the magazine and forgot to tear out the recipe! I was so excited to find it again.

Delightful! Made these for a neighborhood party, they were such a hit I had to go home to retrieve the remainder of the batch. Well received! Extremely easy to make. Be quick to separate them or else they will be clumpy. Walnuts aren't my personal fave so next time I'm going to try with pecans. Great gift idea.

These are very good. But they're more like a praline than a simply-coated nut, which, for some reason, is what I expected. You have to be very diligent about separating the nuts with forks before they cool if you want nuts and not a praline-like confection. These had a maple taste to me, even though there's no maple in them. Quite a hit with the folks I work with, for whom I made them as Christmas gifts.
