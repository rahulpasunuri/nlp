YUM YUM!! I made these today and they were fantastic. I didn't put the cole slaw on the sandwich but it was still really good.

We thought this was great, although I had some doubts before making it....used red peppers which looked nice....very good

This was my first try at making this recipe and for three finicky adults this was a delicious recipe. I forgot to buy breakfast sausage and I bought regular ground pork. Anyway I seasoned the pork with liquid smoke, salt and pepper. Then I doubled the barbecue sauce and added too much to the mix of course making it too wet. So I added some Panko breadcrumbs to soak up the extra sauce it was perfect. Then finally I followed the rest of the recipe as directed. Even with my workarounds this was a VERY GOOD recipe and I highly recommend it.

This is my family's favorite summer recipe! We use yellow and/or orange bell peppers which gives the burgers a dilicious and interesting tast. We also mix the ground porc with italien sausage. With extra sauce on the side, this recipe is a juicy twist on the original hamburger. I woul definitly recomend this recipe.

We omitted the bell peppers, and the recipe was perfect. An interesting twist on burgers. I gave it a three because the bell peppers didn't make sense. But very yummy...and it passed the kid test.

This was disappointingly dry and uninteresting. The outcome of this recipe seems to depend quite a bit on the cook's choices in the processed foods that are key ingredients: the sausage and the barbeque sauce. I would have preferred a recipe that told me how to season ground pork and create a sauce from scratch, but that would no doubt not make the 30 minute meal category.
