Great easy and tasty dressing. Reminds me of the dressings I hav had when I travel to the south of France. It is amazing drizzled on grilled summer veggies too!

A nice & tasty basic vinaigrette. We substituted red wine vinegar and it turned out great.

Hubby wasn't a huge fan. I'll make again but will probably use basalmic instead.

Rule #1: NEVER add dried ANYTHING to a fresh salad dressing! Balsamic is a little tired and passe'... the sherry vinegar is a lovely change to go back to.

A great basic green salad. I loved it because I used greens freshly bought from a local farmer's market, and even better I suppose if they were picked from your own garden. I threw in small amounts of cilantro, dill, and green onion. To add a bit of piquancy, try a dash of chopped sundried tomatoes or really sharp radishes. It's a perfect summer side.

This salad dressing was terribly salty. I used regular salt first but then realized it called for sea salt so I used Kosher salt (similar - coarse like sea salt) and it was still extremely salty. I would recommend adding a tiny pinch of salt and then add more to taste.

Excellent. Sometimes I use sherry vinegar and sometimes balsamic vinegar..either way it is delicious. When making this be sure to use quality vinegar. It makes all the difference in the world.

This is a classic. It's very light and allows the vegetables to be the focus.

Not sure why I followed a recipe for this dressing. Perhaps just to reinforce that I know the proportions for oil & vinegar (and mustard) dressing.

Great dressing especially substituting with balsamic vinegar. This is a staple in our house!

This is the best oil and vinegar dressing recipe I have ever made. Everyone who tastes it asks me for the recipe. I substitute with red wine vinegar.

Very good all purpose salad dressing but excellent when balsamic vinegar is used instead of sherry wine vinegar and the amount of garlic is doubled. Try it over portobello/roasted red pepper/arugula salad.

Basic is right - I can't believe it's an actual recipe. It was extremely bland; it tasted almost like straight olive oil. I thought because it was a "real" recipe it would be tastier than something you just whipped together. Nope.

The best basic dressing ever. I use chopped shallots instead of garlic. You can add fresh herbs or dried if you like.

We like this, I've made it twice. The second time I used less salt and doubled the garlic, yum!
