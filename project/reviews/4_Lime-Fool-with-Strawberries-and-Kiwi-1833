This was a huge disappointment, especially since I increased the quantities to make this for 10 people. The cream and white chocolate (imported from Switzerland) combined to make a very slimy mouth feel. The lime juice separated from the whipped cream mixture upon standing, so leftovers were appalling. I spent $25 on this dessert and would have done much better spending the money on a gorgeous cake from a bakery.

I thought this was outrageously good, although my husband didn't seem as moved by it. But he's not such a big fan of citrus desserts. It was super easy, and really devastatingly good. My 18-month old daughter also loved it. The fruit helps tone it down just a little, and is just the perfect compliment to the lime-white chocolate mix.

I didn't have any white choc. so I used dark instead and layered it twice over the whipped cream. A pretty look and tasted lovely.

This is our family's traditional Christmas dessert; I started making it when my first baby was 2 yrs. (and underfoot each step in the kitchen!); now she is 4 yrs. and loves to help me assemble these beautifully, deliciously simple treats. Occasionally, we make them in the summertime when we are wistful for the holidays.

I made this for dinner guests last night. They couldn't stop raving about it. I will definitely make this again. It is easy, the presentation is beautiful and the flavor is outrageous. I was worried that my fruit was too tart but the fool balanced the flavors perfectly. I followed the recipe exactly and I wouldn't change a thing. It's a perfect spring/summer dessert.

Excellent. Easy. Used yellow kiwi! Never had before and it was very good. Get very good expensive white chocolate. It is worth it.I had to make them the day before the event and they kept nicely in the fridge with plastic wrap on the glasses with rubber bands around to seal them.

Yummy and easy. My classic "when I need something wonderful and can't think of what to serve" dessert. Make plenty!

My guests could not say enough about this dessert. While it is a little on the rich side, its combination of tastes and textures could not be beat. I used Gihradellis white confection,and it worked beautifully!
