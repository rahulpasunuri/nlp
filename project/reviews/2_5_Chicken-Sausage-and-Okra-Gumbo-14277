The recipe calls for too much liquid and it is quite bland. You will need to cut the liquid by half, or more. I added worcestire sauce for some flavor. I would reach for a more traditional recipe next time.

As is, this is a pretty good soup, but it doesn't rise to my definition of a gumbo. While making this dish, I resisted every impulse to fiddle. I wanted to see how this "gumbo" turned out, discover something new and different. My impulse was to make a roux, add garlic and bell pepper, but I resisted. I wish I hadn't. Completing the holy trinity and adding the traditional roux would've definitely kicked this dish up a notch. Next time I will not quell my impulses.

As written, this recipe is a bit dull- the low-fat thing irks me. Why not use full-flavor, full-fat, and simply eat less of it? Now on to the revisions, which may draw slings and arrows of scorn from those who wish people would follow the recipes slavishly. Sorry, just can't do it. I doubled the recipe for a crowd, and began with a roux made from browned flour (stir a cup of flour over low heat in a dry cast-iron skillet until it turns a pleasant dark tan color- makes a nice non-floury nutlike taste, and gives the gumbo its characteristic brownish color) Came time to cook, and I melted a stick of butter, tossed in a couple of tablespoonsful of olive oil to add flavor and raise the smoking point. Let the golden-brown roux bubble for about ten minutes, stirring frequently. Then sauteed the 'holy trinity' of Cajun cookery in the roux- several cups each of chopped onions, bell pepper, and celery. And, oh, yes, a couple of teaspoonsful of minced garlic. While the vegetables cooked, I chopped the raw chicken off the bones, and added it along with the chicken broth to the thickened roux. In went a couple of large cans of diced tomatoes and a small can of diced tomatoes with pepper, some powdered sage, some oregano and basil, and a LOT of sliced frozen okra- most of 4 pounds of it. A final several tablespoonsful of gumbo file' (powdered sassafras leaves, an absolute necessity for gumbo!!) and then it simmered until time to serve over white rice, with much tabasco and other bottled pepper sauces for the bold guests. Even better the following day. BTW, don't believe the old-wives' tales about not cooking gumbo file'-- not true. It doesn't become bitter or stringy. Isn't much of a thickener. Just adds a lovely herby flavor.

I am a native of Louisiana and grew up on gumbos. This is NOT gumbo. FOR GUMBO, YOU MUST HAVE A GOOD DARK ROUX! For this recipe, I would use 1 cup of vegetable oil to 1-1 1/2 cups flour. Also, where is the bell pepper? Gumbos include the Holy Trinity of Cajun and Creole cooking- onion, celery, and green bell pepper. Also, most gumbos include garlic, parsley, and seasonings such as salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, and/or premixed Cajun/Creole seasoning. Bay leaves and thyme add nice flavors if you like the taste of these two. I also throw in a dash of Worcestershire. Finally, I would reduce the liquid, only using broth or stock (not water) to 3-3 1/2 quarts (12-14 cups). You can always add more broth or stock if it is too thick.

I followed the recipe exactly and it WAY to watery.. there has to be a typo it should say 8 cups of broth OR 8 cups of water!... not both; 128oz of liguid is absurd! it was a MESS!

This recipe is a very good guide, but there are a few major changes that improve it immensely. First, add 1 or 2 tablespoons of cajun spices (black pepper, thyme, paprika, cayenne, oregano). Second, try it with cut up pieces of chicken breast, and bread it lightly in flour before frying. Then you don't have to wrestle with the bones and the flour thickens it up nicely.

I have to agree with all the other critics: No roux=no gumbo. This is just chicken, sausage and okra soup. My sister lives in Opelousas and disagrees with Bill, everyone makes a roux. Okra alone will thicken any dish but does not give it the flavor or color that a roux gives. As for file (FEE-lay), I prefer to omit it. To the woman who said she doesn't use chicken thighs: most people use the whole darn chicken or rooster, what's the purpose of leaving out the thighs?

I loved this dish and everyone who tried it raved about it and wanted seconds. I think the trick is to use good, spicy sausage. Delicious!

NO Roux!!! Using chicken instead of HEN or Rouster! These ingredients are what makes a real gumbo.

Very good, it lacked spices so I added my own cajun spices.

I'm from Opelousas,La in the heart of cajun country. Gumbo which uses lots of chopped and cooked down okra instead of a roux is not uncommon. It works because the cooked down okra is so slimy that it thickens the gumbo. I like to use both. The okra adds flavor and texture. For the cook from New York, file (pronounced FEE-lay) is dried, powdered sassafrass root. It is a thickener normally added at the table. By the way, use plain white rice. When serving, ladle in the gumbo and then add the rice. Make a little island of rice in the middle of the bowl. This keeps is from becoming rice and gumbo soup. Email me if you have any questions.

To the reviewer in New York with the question about "roux," a roux is a thickening agent made with a combination of flour and oil -- or bacon drippings, or what have you. File powder is also a thickening agent, though it is not used in my family when making gumbos (nor is okra). I did not make this recipe (thus, no rating) nor would I -- I agree with the reviewer of Houston who said a gumbo is not a gumbo without a roux!

1 being the lowest. This recipe doesn't include a roux. You can't make gumbo without a roux. Period.

For the benefit of all of us who aren't in the know, what exactly is Roux? And what is "file" -- one reviewer says it should never be added til just before serving....what does that mean?

I would NOT use chicken thighs! I would use chicken wings and drumsticks. I would use ham instead of sausage. MORE TRADITIONAL. ALSO THE ROUX IS A MUST. NEVER ADD FILE' TO GUMBO UNTIL SERVING OR IT GETS ROPEY!

No trinity (bell pepper is missing) and no roux equals no gumbo.

This is definitely not authentic. Everyone knows that when making gumbo "first you make a roux."

I definately agree with other cooks about adding the gumbo file and various other fixens to jazz this recipe up a bit. You'll find, with a few personal touches, that this recipe is a keeper. I like to add some fresh shrimp a few minutes before serving. They only take a minute to cook - so save them for the end. Don't be afraid to make a huge batch, it tastes wonderful the next day!

First of all, it is not authentic Cajun. There is no Cajun gumbo recipe without the trinity. By adding in an equal amount of chopped onion, celery and green pepper, a little more garlic and a mixture of salt, fresh ground pepper and cayenne, then you have a gumbo. Andouille sausage is also very good for this recipe. After these changes, it is great.

My family all felt that this gumbo was a bit bland -- I event added hot sauce. I'll keep searching for a gumbo recipe with a little more zip!

After adding some file to this gumbo, I find that it is as good as any I have made or have eaten. My Son is an expert on gumbo and he liked it.

This recipe was very good....after some adjustments (I also added fresh garlic, gumbo file,cilantro,and bayleaf, salt and black pepper, and some red pepper seeds, and made a roux). That made it a perfect...without that I'm sure it would have been too bland for me. It's main drawback? Time. I'm a seasoned cook and it took me three hours, between prep and cooking.

A good hearty recipe, but I think its a good idea to add some gumbo file to it with the scallions.

The recipe was easy and my family enjoyed it very much. I added chopped garlic and tabasco sauce to the gumbo. I also cooked everything in one pot (except for the rice).

The recipe is fairly streamlined as gumbos go, but the result was tasty enough to make that a compliment. The sausage provides the spice in the dish, infusing the broth with its seasoning. Have some hot sauce on hand though -- it could use the kick. I've tried this with both andouille and kielbasa, and I don't think the andouille makes enough of a difference to merit paying twice the price for it.
