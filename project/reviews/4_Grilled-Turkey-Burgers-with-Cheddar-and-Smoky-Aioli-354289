I liked this a lot, but I'm not a fan of aoili so I skipped it. It's also hard to find dark-meat ground turkey in normal stores.

LOVE this recipe. For those who are mindful of their meat sources, my family gets all of our meat and beef from a 100% grass-fed beef source. The farm also has pastured poultry, and pastured pork. You can order their pastured meats online at http://www.pastureprimewagyu.com. Thanks for the recipe!!

Excellent - if you like turkey burgers and hate the dry boring ones. Really easy to mix the meat and aoili and cook. Looks pretty with the grilled red pepper and onion. Would be tasty without the cheese if you were calorie counting or didn't want cheese. I had them on the plate, not on a bun and didn't miss the bun. I find it really hard to find tasty burger buns - I dislike both the super thick ones and the ones that taste like air and dry bread.

I made these on Labor day. Really good and quite easy. I used reduced fat sharp cheddar and mayo otherwise followed the recipe.

I never cared for Turkey Burgers; I hated them actually... Until now. I followed almost all of the instructions except with the following: I did not take the time to roast & grind seeds. I just used 1/2 tsp of coriander, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp of smoked paprika & added 1/2 tsp of Durango hickory smoked salt - it was still the best turkey burger I ever had! Bon Apetit - you have converted me!!

Made this for dinner tonight and it was the best turkey burger I have had in a long time. Usually they are dry with little flavor. This was juicy and so flavorful. I make the recipe mostly as written, but did not take the time to toast and grind the spices. I am sure that would have made a difference in the depth of flavor....but even with prepared spices these were really good. I think the smoked paprika made all the difference in flavor. If you don't have smoked paprika - don't bother with these as it just won't be the same.

I used ground spices, regular ground turkey and regular paprika (it was all I had but I'll look for the smoked paprika next time) and used 1 tsp of salt when it said "salt and pepper to taste" (which always annoys me b/c I have no idea what that means). 1 tsp was a lot for the sauce on its own but in the burgers it was fine - it surprised me how good they were. Red meat turkey would probably hang together better but I've never actually seen it. The burgers are a speck mushy when being cooked but my husband managed with a minimum of breakage. We did try to keep them cool-ish but were at a picnic so they weren't thoroughly chilled and still it was okay. I also skipped the arugula and red pepper - I was just looking for a burger recipe. This truly makes an EXCELLENT turkey burger.

Typically I'm not a fan of turkey burgers -- as they are blah and dry. Not so with this recipe. I used lean white ground turkey and Apple Smoked Cheddar (rather than white cheddar), but otherwise I followed recipe as written. Very easy and scrumptious!!

I made it with ground beef instead of turkey and left off the bun. Yerm!

Three forks as is, but with some tweaking, easily a 4. Had a blast making these today. Here are some of my personal tweaks: *replace turkey for ground bison *add ground cumin, coriander, and ancho chile powder to meat *add diced prunes to meat *if you do this on stove top--reintroduce smokey flavor with smoked cheeses, and smoked paprika in the meat.

I thought this recipe was excellent, and I think hoofbeatz was being a little bit self-inflating. Obviously didn't follow the recipe very well. Mine turned out fantastic. Of course, I only use the finest ingredients and utensils to cook my meals.

Great flavor. I used ground spices and just added them to the rest of the ingredients. I also used roasted cumin spice. Next time I would toast the buns or get a crustier roll to put them on to add texture, but otherwise a good burger!

Wow! What an amazing burger. I made this for a dinner party my wife and I were hosting and everyone went crazy for these burgers. The aioli is supper delish and guests were dipping everything from fries to veggies in it. Even my kids (3 & 5) enjoyed the flavors of the aioli!

Rating: 3
Tasty recipe and worth making again - I used a 50/50 mix of beef and chicken, which (imo) was plenty moist and yummy. For the aioli, I used mustard seeds in place of cumin. For the burgers, adding a finely-chopped hot pepper to the ground meat would have been a good move, but I didn't act on it this time.

I followed the recipe - added some chopped chipotle peppers for a little extra spice. But they were too dry. I used extra lean ground turkey breast - I don't think you can go lean with this recipe....

I carefully followed this recipe, but was left with a soggy mess! I really don't understand how one is supposed to grill these patties without them falling completely apart. Save yourself a ton of frustration and skip this lame-yet-surprisingly-work-intensive recipe.

followeed this recipe to a tee except for using the whole spices. The burgers were delicious! I used ground cumin and coriander which is what I had on hand, and toasted them in a dry saute pan for a minute or so. I thought the aioli turned out marvelously, so do this if you don't have or can't afford to go out and buy the spices whole. Fabulous, full- flavored turkey burgers, best I've had so far!

I don't recommend trying to go healthy on this one. I used ground turkey breast and 2% Greek yogurt (and paprika since had no smoked paprika) and was totally disappointed! Perhaps the burgers needed the fat which was eliminated, but they also needed better taste!

Make sure you chill the burgers for awhile before you cook, otherwise they are too wet and can break up on the grill. These are delicious on pretzel rolls!

This was only the second time I've attempted serving ground turkey to my red-meat-loving husband. I'm pleased to report this was a success (the first was not) so he was highly skeptical. The aioli gives a robust flavor and the delicious toppings help too. Followed true recipe. Spread some of the remaining Aioli on the toasted bun. Didn't have arugula, substituted avocado as a burger topping. Delicious.

This is a great recipe and a standard in our household. When I make them for gathers I make them into sliders and all our guest rave about them.

This aioli is amazing. You could serve it with anything, but it is especially good with anything grilled because it brings out the smoky flavor. Smoked paprika is crucial - not regular. We serve this with sweet potato fries instead of the corn chips.

The aioli makes this recipe something I would make again. I seared the burgers in a cast iron skillet for 4 minutes on each side. I then put the burgers in a 400 degree oven for 18 minutes. I did not have any issues with the burgers falling apart. Some reviewers showed concern over the calorie and fat count. The aioli brings both up. Regular mayo is 90 calories and 10 grams of fat per tablespoon. I replaced the mayo with 0% Greek yogurt, which is fat free and only carries 80 calories PER CUP!

My 1 year old and 3 year old DEVOURED these burgers! Not too spicy, perfectly moist and are even good left over! A big winner in our book

I had never made turkey burgers before and was looking to try one that would have more flavor than those I've tasted in the past. This recipe looked delicious but I couldn't bring myself to add all the fat & calories to a turkey burger that this would add. So, I made it with light Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise. I also just used powdered cumin and coriander.Using light Miracle Whip reduced the calories to 400 in the entire aioli. Using two tablespoons on a burger adds about 80 calories to it which is much more reasonable. You could also try substituting fat-free greek yogurt. Overall the flavor was good and I will probably use this as my go-to turkey burger recipe going forward.

Wow! Delicious & moist turkey burgers. Will definitely make these repeatedly. Used Vegenaise instead of mayo & multi-grain bread for a healthier version. Hubby also enjoyed it even though he's a hamburger type of guy. The aioli rocks!

So, I have actually never made this whole recipe but I have made just the turkey burgers twice and absolutely LOVE them! My boyfriend is a huge fan and said it was the best TB he has ever had! I have to confess that I just used ground coriander and cumin and didn't bother to toast them so I definitely cheated. However, it made the recipe so easy and it was delicious!

Fantastic! My turkey burgers always fall apart on the grill, so I sear them on teh stove first and then broil them in the over in the same pan. It works every time just fine. Once, I added a little chorizo sausage to the burger which was also delicious.

This review is for the delicious smokey aioli only. This is now my go to condiment - great on burgers, sandwiches, fries, veggies maybe even a dollop in tuna salad. Yum!

Rating: 4
Made as described, using 92(or3)%-lean ground turkey, and using a stovetop grill pan as it's still a little too cold for grilling outdoors. Nothing at the store was specifically labeled dark-meat ground turkey. Anyway, the burgers were soft, even after chilling for 30 minutes in the fridge, but not unworkable... once you get a good sear on the bottoms they seem to want to stay together a little more. These were juicy, flavorful burgers with just the right toppings. The aioli was unique and exceptional, either on its own for a dipper, in the burger, or as a burger condiment. We used it all up on 2 burgers, saved the other 2 for the next night, and had them with mayo/mustard, etc. Burgers were just as delicious, though not as unique, without the spiced aioli. We'll make this whenever we'd rather have a turkey burger.

Very delish!!! I improvised a bit with what I had on hand. Used cumin, ground coriander, paprika, monterey seasoning & lemon juice with the mayo for the aioli. Added that to the turkey with chopped portabello mushrooms and fresh spinach. Carmelized the red pepper and onion and used same pan to fry the burgers. Then loaded up the burger, pepper jack cheese and sauted onion/pepper into a flour tortilla and made a quesadilla. Tasted like a fajita/patty melt.SO YUMMY....Hubby loved it too. This will be added to the rotation!!!

My husband ate it as a burger and I ate it without a bun with a bunch of arugula, we both enjoyed it. Neither of us eat burgers very often, and very rarely eat mayo, so it of course is not something I would eat that often - but I will definitely be making it again!

Very tasty burgers, whether on the grill or in a grill pan on the stove! I wouldn't change a thing! Any leftover aioli is great on turkey sandwiches.

I just have to say, these were amazing. I improvised with ingredients I had on hand like white onion vs. red. Pan fried instead of grilled. They were still wow worthy. I sauteed/blackened the peppers and onions, they were scrumptious and went well over the burgers. The home made aioli sauce was phenomenal and I did not even touch the jarred aioli sauce I had in the fridge. This will be a new ground turkey for dinner staple. Definitely a way to spice up bland turkey. Will be making the aioli sauce to keep for future use.

Ask your butcher to coursely grind the dark turkey meat. My husband even enjoyed this healthy burger, so its a keeper.

I loved these burgers! And do please make the aioli. Sooo good! Moist, flavorful (but not overboard like it was compensating for the fact that you're using ground turkey). Overall a definite keeper. The BF was even impressed after a skeptical "why turkey?" note: I cooked the burgers on the stove as my grill is out of commission. Should have chilled them a wee bit longer as they were fragile during the flip, but they did stay together. Oh, and I used extra lean white meat. Seemed just fine and tasty. Served with roasted potato wedges & corn on the cob.

These were the best turkey burgers I have ever eaten. I didn't experience any problems with them falling apart - I refridgerated them for 3 hours before cooking them in a large pan with the peppers and onions. Very delicious and savory. Wonderful recipe.

So easy. I took into consideration all the people who wrote that theirs fell apart so I put my burgers in the freezer for 1/2 hour. Grilled them on the gas grill at Medium-Low-Medium and served them on sandwich sized english muffins. Delicious!! The aoli is delicious can be used for shrimp, crudite, grilled chicken sandwich, etc. Will definately make it again

I seem to be the first reviewer who wasn't in love with these burgers. Very soft (fall apart on the grill) and very strong flavors from the toasted seeds. My seeds were from the Indian store so maybe stronger than others, but the flavors were a little overwhelming. The burgers were juicy, though, and if someone else made them for me I'd like them-- I'll just choose to find another recipe next time.

Rating: 4
I've made these soooo many times. Even my 11 year old loves them. I also used low fat mayo and burgers did not fall apart on grill. Just for time once, I caramelized onions and through in some roasted red pepper slices. It's good with either the grilled onion too. I am hooked on the smoked aioli. I used the leftover aioli for turkey and chicken sandwiches. The cheddar was great, but we did add sweet pickle slices (not the jar kind).

Those were darn good burgers! Perhaps the toppings made it but this is a great combo. I put them in the freezer for about an hour after reading comments of them falling apart, which they still sort of did. Try this one out - fast and delicious! Also, is turkey really that much of an anomaly? Lots of people are knocking it - as much as I like a good beef burger, sometimes it's great to have something else!

Oh I did have one change--I used reduced fat mayo. But can't imagine that little change would make the burgers fall apart. And I'll use that aioli recipe again...maybe dipping sauce for little seasoned chicken skewers.

The Aioli is exceptional, and marries perfectly with charred red pepper. Followed recipe exactly. However, adding aioli to turkey meat makes it very soft, and almost had a disaster with burgers starting to fall apart on the grill when I went to flip them.Next time I'll make sure grill is super clean, and will chill formed patties to firm them up.

I thought these were excellent turkey burgers, and certainly something I would do again. I did not have mayo on hand, so I made the aioli with greek yogurt instead. Still very delicious, and kept the burgers moist. My husband reports that the burgers did fall apart a bit on the grill (I'm wondering if this is because I didn't have any of the fat from the mayo holding things together?)

One of my grandkids saw this on the cover of B.A. and asked if we could try it next time they came over. I tried a 1/2 recipe of it for my wife and I. We both thought it was good but lacked juiciness and a meaty feel. When the grandkids came over I substituded a 1/4 pound of gound pork for a 1/4 pound of turkey. That solved the juicy/meaty problem. The burgers were a huge hit. This recipe is a keeper!
