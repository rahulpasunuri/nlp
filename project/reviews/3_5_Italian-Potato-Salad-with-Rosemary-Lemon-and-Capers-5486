I also substituted oregano for the rosemary; also, since I'd already cooked and diced potatoes, I simply made the dressing and tossed it together. It was a hit...even with MY Minnesota family! However, the next time I make it I'll follow the recipe.

Made the dressing but replaced the fresh rosemary with dried oregano. Tossed half of the dressing with potatoes and green onions and placed in fridge. Right before serving, added romaine lettuce, tomatoes,and the rest of the dressing. Fantastic!

I made this potato salad as part of a bruch buffet at a recent Bridal Shower and it got rave reviews. I loved it because I love potato salad, but am not a huge fan of mayonnaise, so for me this is the perfect potato salad, and perfect to double for a crowd.

This was a hit with my Minnesota Mother-in-law (Read she doesn't like exciting food). My father also loved it and he likes food adventures. It is a safe but sophisticated salad.

Excellent. Great flavor - the capers add the kick! Don't cook the potatoes too long!

I've made this a couple of times. Each time, it was light, zesty and an interesting alternative to potato salad the day it's made. But the leftovers just tasted so bland, and I wasn't sure what to do to liven it up again. I like the cook's idea of adding olives...I might try that if I end up making this again.

These are all flavors I enjoy a great deal, and have made this recipe a number of times, each time modifying it in hopes of getting it right. It didn't happen. In the end, I realized lemon and sweet, creamy, new potatoes are not complimentary flavors to me. However, many people probably do enjoy this dish, and for them I offer some successful enhancements: thinly sliced red onions instead of green, and a generous amount of chopped italian parsley to add a "clean" finish.

Just the variation I was looking for! Used what I had in house, so I substituted Russets and then Chives from my garden. Flavour outstanding.

While this is a nice potato salad recipe there are better, and I'm addicted to lemon and capers.

I found this salad ho-hum. At a bbq potluck, it was eaten, but was not one of the most popular items. I don't think I'll make this salad again.

I made this for a party and everyone wanted the recipe. I did add salt, lots of ground black pepper and oil-cured olives. Yum!

We thought the recipe was fabulous . we enhanced it a bit by adding some finely chopped celery and green onions including some tops . Think I increased the rosemary a bit too. But, however have made it several and get rave reviews.

A wonderful accompaniment to grilled steak or chicken. I've made it several times for summer cookouts and everyone loved it.

This is a great light alternative to the typical potato salads. It's even better the second day.
