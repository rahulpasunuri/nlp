Works with grits too (but cooked up faster) and is just as good without the butter. I would add some of pancetta at end for some crunch.

Two forks may seem a little stingy, but between "good" and "delicious", for me this fell into the former. I really wanted to love this and was excited to make it, but it was just ok. The polenta was delicious, but nothing out of the ordinary, and that's fine. But the kale and mushroom sauce lacked somthing. I wished it were richer, or thicker, or had some textural variance...something. To be fair I failed to remove the crisped bacon and then add it back in at the end, so I missed out on any crunchy texture that would have lent. Even still, the recipe calls for 6 more minutes of cooking after adding the pancetta/bacon (why?), so maybe not? Wanted to love it, but this just wasn't it for me.

Delicious! I added a touch of balsamic vinegar as the mushroom sauce was cooking off. Everyone loves this dish and it is super easy to make!

Yummy! Really tasty and good. I used skim milk instead of whole and next time I would add 1/2 the butter but salted. I will make this again.

I used this recipe as a jumping off point and made several modifications. My toddler sometimes likes crispy kale, so I roasted the kale in the oven. I made the polenta in a double boiler so I wouldn't have to constantly stir and made it with water instead of milk. I fried up 3/4 lb of thick sliced bacon cut up in bite sized pieces. I poured off some of the rendered bacon fat, and sauteed a double portion of shiitake mushrooms with rosemary, thyme and onion in the remaining fat. When I was ready to serve, I stirred a heaping handful of grated sharp cheddar cheese into the polenta then toped it with the mushrooms and then the crispy kale and bacon bits.

I loved this! The combination of flavors is outstanding. I did a few things differently: Instead of boiling the kale and then draining it, I sauteed it first with garlic and onion, added broth and let it cook until the liquid boiled off and it was a good texture. Then I added the mushrooms, some cayenne and Siracha and my fav Spike. I added parmesan to the polenta just after it was finished rather than later. Like another reviewer, I added balsamic at the very end to the kale mixture and then added all to the polenta so it could rest on top and the liquid could drain down to the polenta. Made for a dinner party and everyone loved it! Goes well with fried chicken.

I gave this recipe 3 1/2 stars, my husband (who isn't as fond of mushrooms) gave it 3 stars. While all of the components were relatively easy to prepare, it seemed as though prep took a long time. I did not add the last 2 T. of olive oil to the kale/bacon mixture at the end. It was good just as it was. We gave the polenta (served with chopped bacon and a sunny-side up egg) 4 stars when reheated for breakfast.

I really liked the polenta preparation but didn't think the kale-mushroom-bacon topping added much to it. And kale, mushrooms, and bacon pretty much tie for my favorite foods. Not better than the sum of its parts. I did like the contrast of the lemon with the creamy polenta though.

Rating: 3
I made this vegetarian and added some chipotle peppers to the kale mix, which made it smoky and spicy, a nice complement to the creamy polenta. I also skipped the butter & parmesan for the polenta as it's perfectly creamy without them and no one needs that much saturated fat! Not because I'm a killjoy, but because it's tasty without, especially in contrast to the smoky greens and soft mushrooms.

Rating: 3
This was quite good, although I agree that you need to add more mushrooms. I also sauteed some shallots before adding the mushrooms, and put a splash of balsamic vinegar in the mixture just prior to serving, and I think those additions improved the overall flavor significantly. I made the polenta as directed, except I used 1 1/4 c. of chicken broth in place of the same amount of water (I had chicken broth left over from the night before). The polenta was delicious, and as previous reviewers noted, it makes a ton! I was glad to have the leftover polenta, though, and put it to good use the next night by slicing the cold leftover polenta, dredging lightly in flour, and frying in olive oil. I served the fried polenta over arugula drizzled with lemon vinaigrette and sprinkled with freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Yum!

We love this great way to use lots of kale. I'm a farmer that grows it for our CSA because it is so hardy (can harvest all winter) and so healthy. I did add a bit of chopped onion, added mushrooms and tossed in some chopped celery with leaves. I used prepared polenta.

Delicious! I agree with a few others in that there was too much polenta in relation to the kale mixture. In hindsight if I try this recipe again I think I may add some tomatoes in. To me it needed a little bite with all that creamy saltiness.

Got some kale from the CSA, and used this recipe for our first time making kale ever. We halved it, omitted the last 2 TBS of olive oil at the end and it was great! Highly recommended!

"Surprisingly good" was my husbands comment. I accidently bought mustard greens instead of kale, but it still turned out delicious. Don't skip the pancetta - it adds a lot of flavor to the dish. I only used 1 cup milk for the polenta and still turned out great. I used the left overs for Bacon-wrapped eggs with polenta (another great recipe on this sight)

I enjoyed this recipe a lot and am looking forward to making it again with some minor changes. The amount of polenta you get compared to the amount of greens seemed really imbalanced to me. Next time I'm going to double the amount of mushrooms and halve the polenta recipe. Like some other reviewers, I used 1/2 the oil (which was plenty)! I also used 6 oz. of pancetta because that's the amount that was in the package. I will keep that proportion for next time. I also skipped boiling the kale and just put it in at the same time as the mushrooms.

I discovered this recipe while trying to find something interesting to do with the huge crop of homegrown collards in our winter vegetable garden. This recipe worked really well with that substitution. I used low sodium bacon, doubled the mushrooms (Baby Bellas), cut the lemon zest to 1 tsp and added sauteed scallions. I followed one cook's suggestion and sauteed the mushrooms, garlic and scallions in the same skillet as the bacon, after pouring off the fat and deglazing the skillet with white wine. I have served the greens over polenta and also as a side dish. Both times, it was a huge hit. I am looking forward to trying it with kale in the future when we finally finish off the collards!

A wonderful way to use kale. I used more chicken broth than the recipe called for . . . .

Excellent! added minced shallots, but otherwise prepared as is. easy weeknight dinner...the creamy polenta is an outstanding contrast to the kale.

Rating: 4
Wow, this was good! The contrasting flavors and textures were fantastic together! I added a little squirt of juice from the lemon at the end, and that really brightened up the dish without making it too tart. A great and pretty simple recipe that's easily tailored for your budget (bacon for pancetta, white buttons for crimini and wild mushrooms). This will be one of our staples fur sure.

So strangely delicious and wonderful. I love the fibrous kale against the creamy polenta.

Delicious recipe; I substituted the French-style ham I had on hand for the pancetta and it was a good substitution. Make sure to not overdo it on the broth...it needed to cook down considerably. Thanks to Michael Lomonaco for another good idea for kale!

This recipe is excellent! I have to say, this is the best way I've ever prepared Kale. I used nitrite-free bacon and it gave it such a yummy flavor. I'd never made polenta before and it turned out delicious!

Rating: 4
This is delicious! I completely missed the instruction to boil the kale first. I just lightly sauteed it with the mushrooms, broth and garlic, and it was perfect. As other reviewers have mentioned, you can do this all in one saute pan. I probably used more pancetta than the recipe specified, but that's never a bad thing. It took 30 min from start to finish. I'm sending this to my family and will definitely make it again.

Rating: 3
Definitely make less polenta and cook the kale with the mushrooms. I kept the pancetta separate too, and sprinkled it on at the end. The lemon adds a really nice flavor. I'm not a big fan of kale, but this recipe helps make it tolerable.

Rating: 0
I love this recipe and will make it again, however I will cook the kale in the same pot with the onions and mushrooms next time in order to save time and pot washing. Also, being short on time and fortunate to live in the Southwest, I bought some delicious tamales from the store instead of making polenta. What a fantastic meal!

Rating: 3
After glancing at the ingredient list, I decided to make half of the polenta--which turned out to be just the right amount to complement the greens. I did not use pancetta as I do not eat it, so I just sautéed the mushrooms in some olive oil then removed them and deglazed the pan with a little white wine with which I steamed the kale before incorporating everything back together again. So many nutrients are lost from the kale by boiling it--simply doing it all in one pan eliminated a step (and a pot to wash!) and made the dish healthier.

Rating: 3
I would give this three forks for the polenta recipe which was shorter and easier than the one I have used previously. (I baked it in the oven for an hour) I used a mixture of milk, water and some chicken broth. It was perfect. As for the sauce, perhaps I shouldn't rate it since I am really trying to like kale. So for my recipe the kale turned out tough and watery. The mushrooms didn't seem to go with the kale at all. Perhaps it would be better if it were incorporated into the polenta? Or, use spinach?

Rating: 4
This is a fabulous recipe with an unmatched combination of flavors - agree it is time consuming, but SO worth it - definitely one to try! It is an old standby when we are in the mood for a hearty, yet not heavy supper. Excellent with a big red wine and some crusty bread. YUM!

Rating: 3
This IS pretty timje consuming but I think it's worth it. Makes up quite a lot of polenta, though. I'd either cook double the mushroom/kale mixture or halve the polenta recipe.

LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE: I didn't read the directions on the polenta I picked up at the farmer's market and followed the directions in this recipe - it never thickened up. But, really, how bad could it taste with butter and Parmesan cheese mixed in? I used bacon and cooked it until very crisp only to have it wilt when added back in with the kale - should have sprinkled on top. Otherwise, very time consuming and used a lot of pans.

Rating: 3
i'm giving this 3 forks only because like some prior reviewers, i agree that it was somewhat time consuming. i used 4C skim milk and 3 1/2C low-sodium broth instead of water for the polenta. it saves a step if you toss the raw kale in at the end with the mushroom mixture, cover, and let it steam/boil for 4-5 minutes instead of cooking it separately. i also added extra mushrooms and also sauteed some whilte onion. like some others, i put the pancetta in at the very end so it didn't soften. it was nice and crispy and made a good texture contrast. overall, delicious, but laborious.

I loved this dish. Was fast to prepare and very tasty. Of course I do have a taste for polenta as I grew up in Italy, where it was an ordinary item of our diet at the time. For the polenta I only used one cup of milk and for the rest I used the strained water used to boil the Kale. I browned the bacon to a crisp and liked the texture contrast with the rest of the ingredients. The dish was delicious. Will definetly make it again.

I used bacon instead of pancetta, which paired with the kale was delicious. However, next time, I think I'll cook the bacon a bit more so it's crispier compared with the mushier polenta and kale texture.

This was a really nice way to use up extra kale I had in the fridge. I ended up sautéing shallots ... got my recipes confused. I'd definitely use shallots again. Replaced whole milk with chicken stock, it was a very yummy meal with a grilled strip steak.

I made this dish for a second time because I loved it so much the first time. I also reduced the fat in the recipe using 1/2 the oil. I also used skim milk in the polenta and reduced the butter. I did use pancetta because it has such an unusual smokey flavor that really adds to the dish. Both my husband and I love love love this dish. We are going to try the kale, mushroom and pancetta mixture on a grilled pizza one day soon.

I was amazed at how flavourful and simple this dish was. Like other reviewers, I doubled the amount of mushrooms, which was just the right quantity. 1tbsp of butter (instead of 4)was also plenty. Incidentally, for those who may make this mistake, "polenta" in this recipe refers to ground corn meal - NOT the pre-made stuff you get in tubes.

I'm giving this 4 forks, the way I made it. I didn't change the kale/mushroom portion except to reduce the oil by half. I halved the entire polenta recipe, used nonfat milk and only 1 T of butter but the full 1/2 t of salt (I'm sure it would have been good full-fat too but it wasn't missed). I served it with pork tenderloin rubbed with ground dried mushrooms (used a coffee grinder), salt & pepper, seared in a hot iron pan & finished in a 350 degree oven. This served 4. I think it would have been polenta-heavy as written. Very gourmet--the hubby gobbled it up.

just made this last night for dinner and it was very good. I made a couple of changes, we are trying to eat lower fat, so I used low fat milk, less oil since the pancetta released plenty of grease, and less butter & parm. Still great, having leftovers tomorrow.

This is delicious! I used 2 xs the amount of mushrooms, b/c when I re-hydrated my shitakes I did't know how to figure it. And it was perfect. I also added some green onions. And I used bacon (vs panchetta) b/c I had it. I highly recommend this dish, and it's wonderful reheated. One thing I noticed though, is that there was more polenta than I needed, but I froze it and will use with something else. Delish!!!!

Quite good, a nice wintery dish, though cooking the polenta is fairly laborious. I made it with extra mushrooms, as the previous reviewers suggested. Skipped the butter, but added the parmesan as in the recipe. Polenta was very rich and creamy. Also added caramelized onions.

This came out well and was easy to prepare- I'd make it again. Great way to get veggies into your diet. I agree with the other reviewer about adding more mushrooms, and I also felt that the dish was a bit too lemony as prepared. Next time I'll use more mushrooms and less lemon peel. Otherwise great.

Yum! This is a fabulous dish, and while it uses 3 pots and pans, the preparation isn't complicated. For those who are watching their fat intake, I prepared the dish using low-fat milk, and just a tsp. of olive oil in the whole meal (to saute the mushrooms), and did not stir butter or cheese into the finished polenta. Instead, I grated about 1 T. fresh parmesan directly over each serving of polenta after I had plated it, and before the vegetables went on top. I also doubled the mushrooms, and added a diced red pepper to the sauteing vegetables. I used dried thyme. The flavor was rich and bright. Really, a savory, wonderful meal.
