I've made several risottos, and this is a very basic one. The instructions are very good, follow them exactly (including the bit at the end about turning the heat off and covering the pan). I really wanted some fresh herbs in this, the flavor was lacking something and I think a little bit of something green would help.

No idea why anyone had any trouble making this dish or why it didn't turn out well. It was delicious. Takes a bit of time (over an hour), but what risotto doesn't?

Don't know what went wrong, I followed this recipe exactly as written and it came out horrible. Threw it all away.

I made this a vegetarian dish by sub-ing veggie stock for chicken stock. I also used a leftover riesling for the white wine as that was what we had in the fridge. The rest I followed to a tee. The outcome was...pretty good. Definitely worth a try.

I added sauteed apricots, NZ Sauvignon Blanc and low sodium chicken stock. I find that it is always wise to lay low on the salt- even water is better than high sodium chicken stock. Let the whole mixture cook slowly and keep adding more liquid than you ever thought you would need. Another good addition is a pinch of dried or fresh thyme.

Woah, serious echo in here! LOL...

Echoing other reviewers, this is a delicious risotto -- as long as a generous pinch of saffron and a delicious dry white wine are involved. Refreshingly light. This will be my new go-to risotto, with plenty of add-in possibilities (peas, asparagus, prosciutto, roasted cauliflower, etc.).

I also use a nice olive oil in place of the vegetable oil, and I agree that the wine you use matters. Choose wisely. If you feel that the saffron is a throwaway ingredient, your idea of a large pinch is somewhere south of mine. Be generous with it and you will be rewarded but, no, turmeric isn't an acceptable replacement. Perhaps one's assessment of this dish is a subjective call, but I think it's both subtle and rich, like a cashmere sweater. Great comfort food, especially for a cold and/or rainy day.

I thought this was excellent. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and manchego cheese instead of parm and it turned out fantastic. I also used amazing homemade stock, so I think that enhanced the flavor as well.

I'm surprised there aren't better reviews for this recipe - I thought it was perfect. I followed everything to a T - including the saffron. I didn't add bay leaf, and didn't feel I needed to. It takes a while, I think waiting for the rice to absorb the stock is an important component but well, well worth it. I didn't both using great parmesan, just regular grated cheese and low fat butter with vegetable stock. Thought it was absolutely fantastic, just the right combo of cheesy and warm and comfort, without all the calories. Served with Ciopinno Style Crab Soup (also from this site) and would have added a vegetable if I had more time, but it was raining outside and this as a combo seemed perfect even without a little green on the side. I definitely wouldn't use this as a main dish, it compliments another dish better and may be too rich to stand on its own.

Turmeric is NO replacement for saffron, which imparts a very singular flavor in addition to the golden color.

It was good. Seemed to be missing something. I used turmeric instead of saffron. I couldn't bear spending $25 for such a small amount. Any suggestions as how I might add more flavor w/o using salt? Served steamed broccoli on the side.

This was recipe was fairly good, however there are better. If I were to use this recipe again I would double it, as it was not nearly enough for 4 people.

The final flavor of this dish heavily depends on what wine you add, so choose well. Saffron should be an element of the flavor; if it seemed like a wasted ingredient, try making the "large pinch" a little larger next time. This is certainly a make-it-again recipe.

This was just "okay". I've made less expensive and better risotto. I followed this recipe to the letter and found it too salty and lacking. I will not make this again. I have a dozen other risotto recipes that are far better - the saffron didn't make any difference to this; a wasted ingredient.

This recipe is very good. I don't know how you can use a bay leaf if you're making real risotto and not dumping all the liquid in at once. Too much wine and cheese? Please... Perfect low cal side.

This recipe is OK. As written asks for too much white wine and cheese. Watch for too many extreme flavors. Has potential.

I just made this for my husband and me, and there was tons. I'm not sure why the NJ cook had to double up. It was pretty bland, despite adding a bay leaf and very good Parmigiano Reggiano as well as some strong chicken and veggie stock and a lot of wine. I dont think I would bother making this again except as a side dish.

I thought for as easy as this recipe is to "throw" together, it was very tasty! I loved the saffron and parmigiano mix...perfect for a night when I want some comfort food but doesn't have a million calories either. The only down side was that it wasn't enough for my husband and I so next time, i'd double the recipe.
