excellent dough, which I will use for other pastries in the future. I left out the almond extract, served it with salty caramel ice cream at my dinner party - to rave reviews.

Delicious flavors but center of crust was uncooked. Will pre-cook crust a little next time.

Very good! No need to trim off the excess crust before crimping as it'll look more rustic. I made the dough-disc 3 days before I actually baked it. Turned out great.

I used a pre-made pie crust to make this on short notice, and reduced the sugar by 1/2. There wasn't much glaze on my pears (due to less sugar sprinkled on top), but the taste was lovely: not too sweet, not too heavy- it was the perfect ending to a rich meal.

I made the pear-almond galette, as well as apple and plum galettes, all using the crust from this recipe. The crust was easy to make and turned out great. The almbond cream made this the best of the galettes. Wonderful.

This is just a wonderful dessert recipe - not too sweet, not at all rich. It has many layers of flavor from the unique buttermilk crust to the almond filling and citrusy pears. Everyone loves this and I make it again and again,

Easy recipe and big hit with friends and family. I buy ground almonds from Trader Joe's and it's just the right consistency. I use Pillsbury pie dough from the dairy case so it's quick and easy...just roll it out. No one can tell you didn't make the crust

Overall, this was a very tasty recipe. I really liked the cream for it, but I will use a different dough next time. Instead of using parchment paper, I rolled my dough out on a pizza stone sprinkled with flour. I didn't have problems with the dough sticking. However, I didn't like the buttermilk in the dough. I will leave it out next time, and just use a little water to help it bind. Since the cream was already fairly sweet, I added only about a tablespoon of sugar on top of the galette. It's a very elegant looking desert. I was very pleased with how it came out.

The dough was exceptionally sticky- it clung to everything (hands, plastic, parchment paper) even after repeated chilling. Very hard to roll out to the required thinness. Apart from that, a delicious recipe. Added an extra tablespoon of ground almond to the cream, which made it taste like marzipan. Probably won't make it again just because there are so many other galette recipes out there

This was wonderful, key is toasting the almonds before processing them, it really brings out the flavor. We served it warmed with good honey ice cream. Excellent!

This dish turned out well, but I only gave it three forks becuase I had a lot of trouble getting the pastry that thin. I ended up having to put it in the freeze to cool before I could finish rolling it out. Also, I only ended up using 1/3 of the pear (about 1). It turned out delicious, though! My guests thought it was fantastic.
