This was delicious. Easy and very tasty. I used veg broth instead of chicken (being a vegetarian). The color was a bit...icky but the flavor was amazing.

I wasn't too pleased with this, but I should say right off the bat that I'm not a fan of smoked cheese, so I should have known better than to try it. But it intrigued me, so I did. The only thing I changed from the recipe was to use homemade vegetable stock, which I've used for many memorable risottos. This wasn't one of them. However, if you're a smoked cheese fan, you'll probably have a better result!

I used some red cabbage instead of radicchio, smoked gouda instead of smoked mozzarella, black instead of gold raisins, and an extra 2/3 c. chicken stock instead of wine. I can't provide a fork rating because those are big changes, but it was delicious, very easy, and a very attractive color. I'm sure it would be even better with the correct ingredients.
