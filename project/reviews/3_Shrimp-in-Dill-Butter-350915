Have made this recipe a number of times, both as an appetizer and an entree. Found that the use of just crusty bread was great to sop up the butter sauce. It's fantastic!

The shallots and dill overpowered the shrimp and the melted butter. Not good.

I followed this recipe pretty closely. It was terrible. It didn't have much flavor and was just all butter. A waste of good shrimp.

Just made this and is was wonderful. A delightful change from the usual butter and garlic with shrimp. I think it's supposed to be an appetizer but we did it as an entree and skipped the "toasts". We just dumped the cooked shrimp, butter and all onto some rice. It was FABULOUS. And yes, it did indeed take 25 minutes to cook the shrimp and they were PERFECT.

Isn't 20 25 minutes too long to cook shrimp?

I don't know - what are you supposed to do with the toast? Recipe doesn't say.
