Good summer appetizer, very appealing mix of flavors.

Served this at an outdoor cocktail party on a hot summer's eve with wine and other hors d'ouerves. Everyone said they liked them, but they ate the other hors d'oeurves more and left more of these. Doesn't go great with wine--maybe needs a sweeter drink? But, is very pretty on the platter, unusual, refreshing, and healthy. TIP: After sprinkling with salt, pepper, and mint, grate the parmesan cheese directly onto the watermelon slices with a rasp. Otherwise, it is difficult to get the cheese to adhere to the watermelon.

This was okay, but I don't recommend you waist good cheese on watermelon. I had to try it, just out of curiosity, but I doubt I'll do it again.

I didn't quite know what to expect from this recipe, but since I'm a sucker for anything that is savory/sweet, I thought I'd give it a shot. It was really refreshing and delicious! The flavors all worked really well together.
