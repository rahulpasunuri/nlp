I found this potato dish delicious and labour intensive as other reviewers did so I was prepared. I left out the olives, upped the garlic quite a bit and added a little more parmesan and butter to the crumbs. I am looking forward to making this for company. it looked good and tasted better.

Absolutely wonderful, but time consuming. Large quantity. Unless you have huge eaters, could have cut the recipe in half for side dish.

I used lots of garlic and Japanese bread crumbs. My husband suggested dicing the tomatoes so it's easier to serve. It was excellent --- a wonderful use for our garden tomatoes

This was fairly labor-intensive (used a lot of pots and pans, anyway) and was not worth the effort. The potatoes themselves were good with the olives, but the breadcrumb topping was bland and dry. I missed the "gratin" part, too - the small amount of parmesan cheese with 3 cups of bread crumbs didn't do it.

Nice potato recipe, I used no-fat sour cream for butter and milk. 3 garlic cloves wasn't too much. Fresh-cut canned tomatoes worked fine instead of fresh, but I bet fresh is what would make it 3 forks.

i liked this recipe. it was easy to make. i used plain russet potatos and omitted the olives and parsley since i didnt have those ingedients on hand. i also halved the recipe and it was a good side for steak and salad.

I prepared this and served it with tarragon salmon and a mixed green salad. It received rave reviews, and I have shared the recipe with others at the dinner. It is fairly time-consuming to prepare, but well worth the effort.
