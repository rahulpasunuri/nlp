This recipe is wonderful. The glaze is perfect. Due to the difficulties noted regarding finding rhubarb at Easter-time, I substituted 2 mangoes and 1 1/4 cup fresh cranberries for the rhubarb. It turned out wonderfully, and the colors are superb. It is really a great substitution and goes fantastically well with the ham. Thank you epicurious, once again, you don't disappoint!

So easy and so delicious. Chutney was fantastic. I used less sugar than required and it was perfection. A lot of moaning around the table is always a good sign of tasty food or perhaps a strange sort of orgy

I made this for Easter dinner and it was wonderful! The ham was perfectly moist. The glaze added a nice flavor to it. I made the rhubarb chutney the night before which made preparation much easier!

Everyone loved this ham, but I think it was more a statement about the phenomenal meat (an Amish ham) than the glaze. I didn't make the chutney, as it's too early for rhubarb. Funny, I always think of rhubarb as a spring food, but it really isn't ready until summer in these parts.

I've made this ham for Easter for the past several years. I cook it slow and glaze it every 1/2 hour. Sometimes I serve it with berries or fruit salad instead of the rhubarb Chutney. It's always delicious, and such a HUGE hit with my family that sister says "Your ham is better than Mom's" and she gets sulky when I suggest making a leg of lamb for Easter!

Just delicious!! I made this for Easter dinner and it was a huge hit. The flavor of the glaze and the addition of the chutney were both wonderful. You can't beat something this good and this easy. I agree... this is a keeper!!

This dish was awesome! I showed my husband the recipe a few weeks ago and told him I was going to make this for Easter dinner. He said it sounded good, but I could hear the doubt in his voice. His sister is a graduate from Johnson and Wales and his mom is a superior cook, so I had my doubt too. I followed the recipe to a T, with the exception of substituting Craisins for dried currants in the Chutney. Well, everyone went bananas! The ham was to die for and dinner was a complete success. Definitely a keeper!!!!

Ham was great - wanted to make the rhubarb chutney but couldn't get fresh or frozen. Ham was excellent with sauted asparagus and potato/turnip gratin. Dreammy dinner.

I cooked this recipe to the recipe and it was absolutely incredible. Got rave reviews from the in-laws wanting to know where the recipe came from!

This is the best ham you'll ever eat. I'm not a big fan of chutneys, but I took a flyer on trying the rhubarb chutney. It is definitely a must do. You won't be sorry.

The glaze was nice (and easy), but didn't strongly flavor the hame (which is okay). The chutney was okay, but not worth the time, effort and cost to make it again.

This was an enormous hit at our Easter dinner. The ham stayed juicy and the flavors came through very well. The rhubarb chutney is amazing, and complemented the ham perfectly.

I made this for Easter-minus the Rhubarb Chutney. The glaze was simple to make and tasty but I think there are better ham recipes out there. Next time I'll try the chutney.

Oops, the rolls are called Honey-Glazed Bunny Rolls and can be found in the Easter recipes.

I couldn't find rhubarb at the store, so I used a store-bought chutney, and it turned out wonderfully.

The chutney in this recipe is great. I served it with a smoked chicken as picnic fare. I did sub raisins for the currents.

This was one of the best ham recipes I have tried. And extremely easy. For those of you who couldn't find Rhubarb...in Minnesota I found it in the frozen food section. I used frozen rhubarb and it was delcious.

The rhubarb chutney really makes this recipe unique and a hit. Next time I would not go to the trouble of making the currant glaze because I don't think it added much to the ham. Any simple mustard glaze will do since most of it cooks away anyway.

The glaze really caramelized and made the ham beautifully brown. Rhubarb chutney is a great foil to the salty ham. very good.

This was really good. I made the compote as well, and it was well received by everyone but my 6 yr old (she hates everything) and my brother (so does he). I served it for easter dinner and had leftovers for days.

We served this for Easter and it turned out extremely well. The sugar in the jam browned very quickly so be prepared to tent with foil shortly after placing the ham in the oven.

HAd the inlaws over, it was our first time doing a big-ass ham. Everyone agreed, it was the ebst tasting ham ever!! I concur with the member from Quebec, my grocer just laughed when I asked for Rhubarb in April. Too bad, it sounds great too!

Really wonderful. The chutney made a delicious ham even more remarkable. All but the fussiest of the children enjoyed both the ham and the chutney.

Served this to rave reviews. Glaze was especially delicious and chutney will be a great spread for ham sandwiches!

I have to agree that this is easy and so good.Did the boneless ham thing and kept a little water in the pan to keep the drippings from burning...I think that this would make a good sparerib glaze. Did'nt do the rhubarb thing..hard to find up here at this time of the year

I made this for our family Easter dinner and it was a hit! I used a boneless, low fat Black Forest ham, made the Red Currant Glaze and Rhubarb Chutney exactly as written. The Chutney was a nice addition - not too sweet or tart. As one reviewer stated, rhubarb is sometimes hard to find and I went to 3 other stores before finding it at Stater Brothers.

This was very, very good! We had this for Easter brunch. Made the recipe as printed, only had to sub. raisins for currants in the chutney recipe because we couldn't get currants and had to sub. frozen rhubarb for the fresh. This may just become our new favorite ham recipe - not too sweet, not to strong, just the right balance of flavors!

This recipe was great! I substituted mango chutney and used about 1 c of currant jelly. The extra jelly gave a nice sweet flavor because the mustard can be overpowering.

I had this for a dinner party. The rhubarb chutney got rave reviews. The rhubarb is somewhat difficult to find here so be aware of that and don't wait until the last minute. This is quite unusual and very refreshing with the ham.
