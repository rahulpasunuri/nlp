The crumbled amaretti is the best part of this recipe. For the balsamic vinegar, I think it would be better if reduced so you get more of the flavor with the strawberries. For those of you trying to reduce sugar, you can use agave nectar instead with the same results in the sorbet and also the fresh strawberries.

Excellent. Refreshing. Make it easier by using HAGGAN DAZ strawberry sorbet (low fat!). Everyone LOVED it. Don't skip the authentic amaretti cookies.

I also prepared two desserts for my guests....but it was this recipe that received rave reviews. It is amazingly refreshing and oh so simple. Wish I could remember where I found the cookies. I realized afterward that there was nothing that I could have substituted that would have been as good an accompaniment.

I was in a rush for a simple but delicious recipe. Found this one and my company RAVED about it. I also made another dessert that was more time consuming and definately "fancier"...but it was this that was the real hit. Take the time to find the Amaretti cookies, they were a wonderful touch and I can't think of anything that would approximate them. Can't wait to try it again in when I can get "real" fresh strawberries!

Shockingly, the vinegar gave this dessert a lot of depth of flavor. The strawberries became almost savory and cut the sweetness of the sorbet nicely. The amaretti cookies were a bit hard to come by but worth looking for as it gave a nice texture.
