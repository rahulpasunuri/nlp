Great winter recipe. I used it for a holiday party as one of two salads, well received. Did not find/use champagne vinegar but found champagne vinegar with lemon and it added an extra zest punch that I had to balance by adding a bit more honey. Also added mandarin oranges, cut in half, for ore variety. Made all ahead except for cutting of endive and butter lettuce.

Wow! A wonderfully light, crunchy salad that screams "healthy". I used blood oranges instead of grapefruit and white wine vinegar because I didn't have any champagne vinegar. Turned out great, will definitely make it again.

This was a wonderful recipe base for what I ended up doing. I hosted a dinner party with an ambitious main course, so I decided to cheat a little on the salad and buy a champagne vinaigrette. Also, my menu was Mediterranean-inspired, so I subbed blood oranges for the grapefruit. Awesome. Drizzled the plated salad (otherwise conforming to recipe) with honey and it was perfect.

looks pretty good and I love salads and it looks easy to make...I'll most definitely make this for lunch tomorrow!

I was searching for a unique, light salad to complement a rich pasta - and found this one. I was very skeptical, but gave it a whirl and was VERY pleasantly surprised. It was very mild, and quite lovely - my guests raved! Add a few pine nuts, or proscuitto for a heartier starter.

I really loved this dressing. It's very simple, but complements the tartness of the grapefruit and endive.

While this isn't an amazing, "blow-you-away" experience, this is quite a simple and tasty salad with a really neat, fresh combination of flavors.

To be fair, I should say that I didn't use the dressing because I ran out of time, but had the salad made and sprinkled on some oil and vinegar. The grapefruit was a hit and I loved all the flavors together. I will definitely make again, but with the dressing the next time.

the crisper the lettuce the better
