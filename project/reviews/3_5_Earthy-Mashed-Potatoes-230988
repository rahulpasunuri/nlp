Made these for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them. They had a great flavor. If you make ahead they will dry out a bit and you'll need to heat up and add a bit more milk. Nice change from boiling the potatoes.

Wonderful. I did not have as many potatoes as called for, so they were very creamy indeed. I used 1/4 cup vegetable stock in place of 1/4 cup of the milk. Very flavorful.

Fabulous flavor, soooo much better than w/boiled potatoes. I'm making them for the third time in a week.

I made these for Thanksgiving dinner, they were delicious and everyone loved them. "Earthy" because they are baked instead of boiled. We scooped them out of the skins into a crockpot, mashed them and added melted butter then heated cream. The crockpot, set on low, kept them hot and perfect for three hours before we served them.

This looks like a lot of time and unnecessary work to make ordinary mashed potatoes. If you simply peel and cube them, boil them until tender (20 min?) then add the rest of ingredients, you'd get same results, only not so dry.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. Perhaps I baked the potatoes too long, but I found them to be dry and unpleasant tasting. Furthermore, it was too much work to peel the potatoes while they were hot and put them through the ricer.

I think they are called "earthy" because you bake the potatoes instead of boiling them.

Why is it "earthy?" Looks like a normal mashed potatoe recipe to me.
