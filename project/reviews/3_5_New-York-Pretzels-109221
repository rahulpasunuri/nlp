Absolutely delicious! The only thing I would change is the cooking time. I started with 20 minutes, but to get them browned, 25 is best.

Really fun recipe! I'm new at cooking/baking but found the recipe to be easy to follow and good for a newbie. I think 35 minutes in the oven may be a bit too long--the pretzels came out a bit crispier than I would have liked.

I really wanted to like this recipe more...A lot of work for an okay result. We added rosemary to half the batch and sprinkled those with fresh Parmesan before baking...They were gone in less than 30 minutes at the party we brought them to and received some compliments, but I wasn't impressed. Nowhere near the yummy soft pretzels I've purchased in the past.

Although I followed the recipe closely (the only difference was using a stand mixer), my dough was rough and crumbly and only a small chunk of it came together nicely. It wasn't sticky and was difficult to roll -- so I think there was too much flour? After boiling (with baking soda) and baking, the little pretzel sticks I ended up with were tasty, but not at all what I had expected. I let them cool, put them in a container, and shared them with some friends an hour later, and they were already hard (though still tasty). I might try this recipe again with less flour and less kneading, but I'm also going to be looking for another one to get the perfect pretzels.

This was my first experiment with a pretzel or bagel recipe and it worked great. It was a good project to do with my kids, especially since it can be done in stages and doesn't require extended concentration from them. There may be more exciting pretzel recipes out there, but we all loved eating these hot from the oven. Made them 2 days ago and we're making them again today. The dough wasn't too sticky, I probably used 2 T flour during the kneading process and this was just fine. I used 75% white flour and 25% wheat, and today I'm going to try 50/50.

I've only made this once but will definitely revisit this recipe. I did use a standing mixer and had great results with the sticky dough. I probably used a little too much flour for kneading and rolling out as the dough is sticky but thats what makes the smoothe crust. Kosher salt worked well in lieu of pretzel salt and even though this first attempt didn't look like perfect pretzel shapes, they looked great out of the oven and tasted great as well. Think of using these in place of dinner rolls.

great appetizer for Oktoberfest meal; used coarse sea salt; can cool a bit before serving, but it is a last min dish. In my cool house I have found heating my dryer, turning off, and placing dough inside to rise works well. For this, I heated dryer twice because I let it rise until it was convenient to boil and bake - about an hour extra

Love the pretzels. Used regular table salt and it worked, though obviously isn't as tasty as the pretzel salt. Also sprinkled a few with a mixed salt/herb seasoning and those were great. Just used the recipe again today to make bagels. The only thing I changed was the shape. Am replacing my current bagel recipe with this dough instead.

These were very good and not too hard to make, but 35 minutes was too much time. I'll watch them more closely after about 25 minutes next time. Good stuff!

Great recipe! I make it frequently and my family adores them! I use the baking soda method as another cook suggested and they turn out amazing- taste just like pretzels should. I normally serve them with a cheese fondue for a simple and fun weekend meal. Very easy and flexible recipe too, which is another plus!

this is a exceptional recipe, i used brown sugar insted of white and they turned out very well.

These are just great! I loved to make them when my son has his friends over for the night and would let them make their own shapes. Even teenager boys get a kick out of making their initials out of the dough. It may seem complicated but if you are home for a few hours, I promise you that you will be the best mother in the world to everyone else's kids. The baking soda is a must in the water and I will use some whole wheat flour and even ground flax seed just to make it a bit healthy.

I've made these dozens of times by now and have made several variations. The most popular has been to sprinkle different types of seasonings on. I've done everything from poppy seeds to fennel seeds... think of a Everything Bagel. I've also used chicken and jalapeño sausages to make fancy pretzel dogs. Mix that with a variety of different mustards (my favorites being a good stone English or Tiroler Krensenf Horseradish) and you'll have everyone begging for more. If you attempt that as well, my one piece of advice would be to consider how much oil is going to come off the sausage as it will definitely have an effect on overall experience if your pretzel seems soaked in grease.

Have made them twice already. My husband wanted "pretzel dogs". So I cooked brauts, quatered them lengthwise and halved crosswise. Put each piece in a dough and made short sticks (24 of them) . They are great! Definitely bake less then 20 minutes.

These pretzels have become a fixture at our poker games. The guests find them consolation for the money they lose.

These Pretzels turned out better than I ever imagined. I make them for an annual Oktoberfest party and they are a BIG hit. The baking soda is a must. Additionally, I make them during the week prior to the party through the boiling step and then freeze the pretzels until we arrive at the party. After a brief defrost, they get the egg wash and salt and bake up to perfection. If you are making several batches, I strongly recommend trying this. It helps reduce the mess, too.

I thought these were really very tasty. I ended up making 12 smaller pretzels because I knew they'd fit in my boiling pot more easily. I was pretty liberal with my egg wash, too, and I think that helped produce a crispier result. They weren't in the oven for more than 18 minutes, for certain. A tablespoon of baking soda in the water is a must, and I'd suggest working with more than one baking sheet: the ones that went directly in the oven after coming out of their bath were FAR better than the ones that waited for a boiling batch to get finished. They get sort of deflated and waterlogged.

good recipe- I've also heard that adding baking powder to the boiling water adds to the crusty taste... very easy to make and gets good remarks!

These pretzels may require a lot of steps but they're absolutely fool-proof. I've made them time and time again -- following the recipe exactly -- and they always come out well. Frankly, better than the dried out ones you get from a cart in NY(though without that wonderful charcoal smell!) I've brought these to a few parties and now I get "requests."

this recipe is easy and fool proof, but these pretzels really just taste like bread to me. They really lack that soft pretzel tang. You are much better off to follow the "pretzel roll" recipe for authentic pretzel flavor.

this is really a 3.5 fork. i wouldn't say it's "a dish beyond compare," but it yielded exactly what i was looking for in a pretzel--chewy, salty, tasty. i second the baking soda to the boiling water suggestion - gives it that pretzel zing.

I added the baking soda to the water too, used lots of egg wash and lots of Kosher salt. I guess my oven is a bit slow, because I had to bake them for 20 minutes. My grandchildren hid small bits of Babybel cheese inside the fat part of the pretzels (ours were not exactly evenly rolled out), and it was so delicious it made me wish I'd stuffed a long piece of dough with it. I'm sure swiss cheese would be good also, especially if you eat the pretzels with mustard as we did. Enjoy!

I made the dough in my bread machine. Like other reviews, added the baking soda to the water. And watched for cracks in the dough which did have a tendency to get water logged. Baked only 18 minutes. Great pretzel. We ate them with mustard from Germany.

Made this last night for a party and everyone LOVED them! I did add the baking soda to the water - don't know what that does, but they were delicious! We served them with 3 types of mustards too. We have decided we are building our Christmas Eve dinner around them!

They were delicious - thanks to everyone's suggestions. I added a tablespoon of baking soda to the pot of water; I used 3 1/2 cups of flour; I only baked for 18 minuts and used plenty of egg on them; I also used kosher salt. Also, I cut the dough into 16 sections instead of 8 and made mini-pretzels, I was able to fit more pretzels into the pot and they were easier to handle. I made the dough in my bread machine, on the dough setting. It made the whole process much easier. My 8 year old daughter helped me and we had a blast.

The first time I made this recipe it wasn't very good. But there's nothing like fresh pretzels so I gave it another shot and have made these pretzels at least 6 more times and they are great. A few tips: - the baking soda tip in the boiling water is a must. I even put a bit more in when boiling my last few pretzels. - make sure you have good, active yeast. Old or poor yeast isn't going to give you nice puffy pretzels. - If you can help it, when rolling out your pretzel rope try to keep the outside smooth and unbroken. If there are cracks/creases it can allow water to soak in when boiling and water-log your pretzel. -Make sure that the water is at a roiling boil. If its not hot enough you will end up with soggy un-puffed pretzels. Get your water heating well before your ready to roll out your pretzels so it is good and hot when you are ready for it. - Sometimes the pretzels dough is too sticky and I do have trouble rolling out long enough ropes to make the classic pretzel shape so I make pretzel balls. I did this for a party and they were a big hit! This recipe should make around 40 1 inch balls.

This is a very difficult recipe. The dough is sticky and is difficult to roll into a thin, 24" "rope" evenly. The pretzels tend to stick to themselves when you maneuver them, so they come out of parboiling somewhat deformed. Otherwise, the flavor is good, and I agree with reducing the cooking time to avoid overly hard surfaces.

Add the amount of baking soda that needs to go in the boiling water bath, to the recipe.

OK. I just took the other half-batch from the oven, and my final 2 cents is as follows: Skip the boiling completely, and resolve to eat crispier, tastier pretzels. I even re-toasted my initial (boiled) batch, and they are god-awful compared to the crispy un-boiled ones.

Rating: 2
I am a confidant bread maker, and I checked out a good few recipes before I decided to try these. These pretzels are weird, period. Off the bat, there is no way you should consider baking them any longer than 18 mins max. I also made sure to put the baking soda into the water to boil (and I have the other half-batch in the oven right now that got no baking soda to compare. My first batch came out spongey and odd- chewy, but not in a light, bready-chewy way. Chewy like hot elastics. Not nice. I also think the bottom of the pretzels should be crisp, and these are just elastic-y all the way through. Perhaps if you are going to make them just because you want a bready treat, and don't compare them to anything you won't feel they were a complete waste- but if you have big, soft, golden New York pretzels in mind, give this recipe a miss.

This worked out perfectly for our New Year's Eve Bavarian dinner. After reading all of your reviews I think I came up with a solution...brushed with egg heavily and thoroughly instead of lightly (as suggested) to soften it up and baked for only 20 minutes instead of 35 (as suggested). The result...wonderful soft yummy pretzels! Prosit Neujahr!

I have used many pretzels mixes and clones of receipes for prezels. I followed the baking soda addition because I've done that before. This receipe is a waste of time unless you want hard, too crisp pretzels that bear no resemblance to the NY prezels I grew up with or the philadelphia prezels that are equally unique.

This was fun and easy for my kids to help with. They loved rolling the dough and shaping the pretzels. My husband was pleasantly suprised and enjoyed them when he came home. I did add baking soda to the water as per other reviewers recommendations.

Fun recipe! Mine turned out a little too crisp on the outside. I'd like to fix that next time, and I'm also interested to see if baking soda works to make them taste more like authentic German preztel bread.

My whole family got involved in this project. My kids are 4 and 3 and they loved all the mixing, sifting and especially the rolling ! My husband came home to all of us covered in flour and wondered if the end result would be worth our effort. One bite and he was convinced. They were delicious. I recommend Kosher Salt.

My husband and our two children made these pretzels for a fun Sunday activity. Although the recipe is somewhat time consuming the end result is delicious. We'll definately make them again!!
