this was good with chopped dill pickle instead of the sweet pickle relish. i left out the egg and added just a few chopped briny olives to save a few calories. next time i'll add some wilted chopped cabbage to replace some of the softer texture of eggs, too.

I can't believe I'm the first one to rate this 8 year old recipe. Try it! I've made it for St. Patty's Day potlucks for years now and it's always a big hit.
