Absolutely the BEST lamb chop recipe I have tried. I have followed the recipe exactly and it has turned out perfectly every time I have fixed it. This makes a great meat dish for a dinner party as it does not take much time for the flavors to develop and they prepare very easily to allow one to spend time with guests.

Unbelievable! Delicious! Easy! So fresh!

This is fabulous. It is a favorite in my repertoire! I made it as directed - cut down on the salt - it is always easier to add salt and pepper at the end. Add pepper! I served this with portobello mushrooms a shallot and a red wine reduction with beef broth.

Fresh herbs are a must. This recipe is perfect.

Simple, delicious, what more could you ask for? I would highly recommend cutting the amount of salt used by 1/4-1/3 of the recommended amount. Our family found it a bit too salty and using mint jelly was a must to balance out the saltiness. And a side note: You can also make it with dried thyme and rosemary and granulated garlic if you don't have any fresh herbs or garlic on hand and the markets are closed for the holidays. Obviously won't turn out as good as fresh ingredients, but still delicious.

Unbelievably easy and yet so tasty, it was a hit at my house and I looked like the upscale restaurant chef. Thanks, one to do again definitely.

So wonderfully simple and delicious! Jus one thing: is it only me who wonders how to get 4 servings out of 6 chops? At my house, no self-respecting lamb lover would stand for only one chop - 2 chops per person is de rigeur!

I loved this recipe. It was very easy and delicious. My challenge was getting the rest of the meal ready in the time it took to get the lamb chops done. Definitely worth repeating!

This was an exceptional recipe for me, as this was my first time making lamb chops. It was very easy and the chops were delicious! I used double the amount of olive oil though.

Ditto to the cook from Birmingham. My fresh herbs charred a bit , merely scraped them off the surface of the chops before putting the pan in the oven.

Simple to make and a nice clean taste. I made this as a weekday meal for family but certainly could see this as a company dish served with roasted tomatoes.

Outstanding recipe....have made twice. First time followed recipe exactly and used the lamb loin chops served at a spring luncheon. It was a great success and very simple to prepare. Used the marinade (added Dijon mustard) on a rack of lamb for Easter brunch and it was the hit of the menu. I let rack marinate overnite in refrig and then browned/seared in cast iron pan before finishing in oven. Delicious and impressive. I have had multiple requests for this recipe. Use fresh herbs!!!

Made this dish as a quick last minute dinner, and it came out superb! Equivalent to what's ordered at an upscale restaurant! I'm pleased to say that the recipe is very simple yet flavorful. I would definitely add this to my recipe repetoire!

Delicious, flavorful and easy enough for a weeknight! My chops were a little thicker than called for, but were rosy pink and tender after the specified cooking time. I will make these again and again.

This recipe was simple and delicious and the timing worked just right for us. However, I felt that it was too salty for my taste. Next time, I will reduce the amount of salt and increase the herbs and garlic.

Wow - Awesome!! I didn't have fresh herbs so I used 1 tsp each of dried and it worked well. Fresh next time. I used a grill pan that just went into the oven after I browned the chops. When they were sitting, I reduced the pan with some balsamic vinegar and poured this over the chops. A bit of mint sauce (from my English side) and Yumminess! Served with herb roasted potatoes and some baby tomatoes I threw into the pan in the oven.

OMG! Absolutely fabulous! I served these delicious lamb chops for a birthday dinner and everyone loved them. The lamb chops were so easy to prepare. I marinated them in ziploc bags and had to mush the marinade around the lamb. From there they went into a hot skillet, then into the oven. I also used the marinade on boneless chicken breasts. WOW! Terrific! This recipe card will definitely receive a spot in the recipe file box.

This was a snap to make - very, very easy and delicious! I will make this again! For me, 10 minutes was medium, not med. rare, which was fine although I'll reduce the cooking time when I next make this.

Absolutely loved this easy to make recipe. Will be my go-to lamb recipe. Only needed 6 minutes in my oven for med-rare. Will serve this to family and guests.

This is the first time my husband and I cooked lamb. We followed this recipe exactly and it turned out amazing! We cooked it a bit more than 10min so it was medium, but it was still juicy and tender. I had thought it would need a sauce but it was fantastic even without it.

I would have gladly put three times the effort into making this dish. The lamb was tender, savory, juicy, ... fantastic. Yet so little work!

Yummy! I have never cooked this cut of lamb as it appears there is not much meat and I was always terrified that I would overcook. I got beautiful loin chops from Costco that were probably closer to 2" thick, marinated for 1/2 hour and cooked as directed (I needed the 10 mins in the oven). My husband and in-laws were thrilled with the results. Served with sauted spinach and couscous pilaf (from a box).

Excellent!!!! Not complicated and perfect results. And tell me FreshCope, what are you doing on this site if you want "something from a box or the freezer"???

Simple and very flavorful. I used fresh herbs and grilled the lamb chops rather than roasted them. I've now made this twice for guests and both times it was a big hit. On one occasion, served it with thyme-roasted sweet potatoes which worked out very well.

I made this for a dinner party, and the results were FABULOUS! I more than doubled the recipe, as I had about 14 lamb chops to cook. I was a bit concerned that the marinade mixture was insufficient for the quantity I had, but it came out perfectly. I got my chops from Costco, and the searing/roasting combination made them incredibly favorful and tender. I highly recommend this recipe!

Rave reviews from the husband on this one. One complaint though, is 10 minutes of roasting took the lamb way past medium rare - but it was still moist and tender.

I have entertained with this recipe many times. The flavor combination is wonderful. I usually add a couple extra cloves of garlic - can't ever have enough!

Perfect! Be careful not to confuse coarse kosher salt with regular grain sea salt, as I originally did--resulting in way too salty of a thick paste when I added two whole teaspoons. If you don't have coarse salt, significantly reduce the measured amount.

This was an extremely good and simple preparation. I grilled them outside as I hate the mess of oil splatter. I also used the marinade on steak and then on boneless pork chops. All were excellent.

This is my second review of this recipe and I am only writing to confirm that searing the chops for 3-4 min/side was plenty for medium rare. Oven roasting not necessary.

I love lamb but had never tried cooking it before. This recipe was easy and I even used bone-in lamb chops which were still very tender and flavorful. I stuck to the recipe but used dried rosemary and reduced the cooking time since my chops were not as thick as the ones described in the recipe. Turned out great and was so flavorful! Would definitely make again.

good recipe, I added a bit more garlic and olive oil, because I'm just like that. Also, I didn't have the fresh herbs so I used dried. It was good but a bit strong. If I make it again I'd either use the fresh herbs, or just one of the dried herbs. Both was a bit too strong. The cooking time was perfect.

So easy to make. It's also a great idea to add small tomatoes and sliced up onion when roasting. The dish takes on a 'Provencal' aspect. Great with a crisp green salad.

To: megs91581 from Boston, MA Thank you for sharing your recipe and the photos. I enjoyed all of it. Just got agreement from my daughter that we will make your recipe next time she is spending the weekend with me. Alas, no wine to go along as she is still a minor..Thanks again!

Oh, how imaginative! But I could never make this; it's too, too complicated, not to mention time-consuming. Dear me, can't we have some simpler recipes? Maybe something out of a box or from the freezer section of the grocery store?

I add balsamic vinegar to the marinade and let them marinade for a few hours or even overnight, then I just barbeque the lamb chops. This has always been a hit and easy recipe. If you marinade portebello mushrooms the same way and also barbeque, you have an instant meal that won't leave leftovers!

Great Chops, this is a recipe you can use with good Pork Loin Chops as well. Poker Guys say "Likin' dem chops"

Lamb Chops were extremely flavorful. Very easy recipe to make. To ensure medium rare, keep to the timing. Also made a red wine sauce after removing from the oven. Just added red wine to the pan and reduced till sauce thicken. I would make this again. Liz Duguay

Great flavor and so easy to make! I don't think I'd ever cooked lamb before so what a wonderful first experience with it!

Very Easy and tasty. I love lamb and the combination of rosemary, thyme and garlic! I would definitely make again. The comment about tough meat; some stove/cook tops don't put out enough heat to brown quickly and all the moisture is removed before placing in the oven. This method of cooking meat requires very high heat in the pan first to brown.

I was disappointed in these...tough and not much flavor when I prepared them. We much prefer the Crown Roast Lamb With Rosemary and Oregano recipe on this site--I just prepare 1/2 or 1/4 recipe as a simple rack....much more flavor with similar ingredients.

Great simple recipe for loin lamb chops. Less work and more flavor than other recipes.

Our stove-top is quite powerful and 3 minutes per side and 10 minutes in the oven resulted in well-done chops. We will makes this again, but for medium-rare probably skip the oven roasting.
