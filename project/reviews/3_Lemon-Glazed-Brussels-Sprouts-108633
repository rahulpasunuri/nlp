I'd never had brussels sprouts before making this dish. My son and I liked it, but didn't love it. I thought the lemon complemented the sprouts perfectly but I guess I'm just not wild about the sprouts. I was very careful not to overcook. I'm just thrilled my four year old ate 4 of them!

I pretty much followed the recipe, but I had only one pound of brussels sprouts. I may have added a tad more lemon juice. I will try with sugar the next time, but I worry that it might take away from the tartness that I liked.

I split the recipe in half for two. It was a great dish. I did add additional water and cooked about 13-14 minutes. I will make this again.

People either like Brussels Sprouts or they hate them. This recipe won't change any opinions.

This dish is very good. My husband and I loved it; my kids (being kids) thought it was yucky but then again brussels sprouts aren't exactly a big crowd pleaser in the under 5 crowd. It does need a hefty dose of salt though.

I used a non-stick omelet skillet, put about an inch of water with the butter and oil, cut the Brussels sprouts in half and fitted them in a single layer. I used one pint of Brussels Sprouts for 3 people. I cooked them about 10 minutes, turning frequently, adding a little water as it cooked away, and when they were fork tender, I squeezed a half lemon over them, sprinkled salt and a grind of pepper and continued to cook and turn over until they were glazed. I forget the lemon peel. My result was delicious and I'll make this aqain.

I agree with most of the reviewers that this wasn't good. I think something was left out of the posted recipe - an ingredient or a step? I'd try it again though - maybe parboil the brussels sprouts in a large volume of water and then glaze them afterwards in a saute pan. As one reviewer recommended, I think you need to add some sugar to the lemon juice to really glaze them. The lemon flavor is weak otherwize. Maybe that's the missing ingredient.

For the glaze, add a tablespoon of sugar and 1 more tablespoon of lemon juice for three total. The sugar will help get the shiny glaze all of you is looking for.

This was really just brussel sprouts with a hint of lemon flavor. The sauce does not really glaze the sprouts.

This recipe was good simply because i love Brussels sprouts. and it was lemony, but not very glaze-y. it was the last thing i made before eating christmas dinner, so maybe i rushed through it. i'll try it again, more carefully. but it kind of just seemed like buttered sprouts with lemon juice. and i added toasted pecans which was good.

Even my children asked for more! What a nice alternative to the traditional vegetable dish. Make it exactly as stated. It's terrific.

A light and delicious accompaniment. I served this with filet and goat cheese mashed potatoes and it provided a wonderful balance to the meal.

The trouble with Brussels sprouts is that so many people dislike them. That said, if you do like them, this is a delicious side dish. It's quick and fresh-tasting, and all of the different flavors come out without masking the taste of the sprouts. Don't overcook them, and you won't be disappointed. If you end up with too much liquid, remove the sprouts from the pot, boil the liquid down to a syrup, and pour it over.
