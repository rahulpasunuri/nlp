This chicken is excellent - really flavourful and easy to make. I use boneless chicken thighs and reserve some of the marinade for the plantains as well. Have made it 3 times this summer already.

First I would like to say this is a very delicious recipe. But it does not taste like traditional Jamaican Jerk chicken even remotley. If you are looking for a traditional recipe this is NOT it.

This was so good and super easy. Made it with boned chicken breasts - took no time at all on the BBQ. Great for a quick week-day dinner.

This one's a keeper. Great depth of flavors. I cut the red pepper by about half so it was not too spicy for the kids. Marinated boneless, skinless breasts and thighs for about 2-3 hours. Did not make the plantains (didn't want to venture to the Kroger). Grilled on the Big Green Egg with some apple chips. The whole family LOVED! I added some agave nectar to the leftover sauce to sweeten it up and cut the spice, which seemed to increase with time sitting. I also did not puree (LOVE this hint from other reviewers - totally unnecessary time and mess). Served with brown rice and pan roasted asparagus for a yummy and healthy weeknight meal.

The chicken was awesome! Juicy and had a great flavor. I also fried the plantains because that's really the only way I like them. Thanks for the recipe! Very easy and quick and tasted great! I will definitely make this again.

This chicken had great flavor. I undercooked the plantains, and they were a wash. I used blackstrap molasses, no salt or onion, dried instead of fresh thyme, did not puree, added a couple dashes of Worcestershire. Marinated skinless, boneless breasts overnight, cooked on a high heat charcoal grill. Chicken came out juicy and flavorful. Will make this for guests, with traditional fried plantains and some rice and heart of palm salad.

This is the BEST grilled chicken ever! I actually made this twice in a two week period it was so good. Skip the blender-just throw marinade ingredients in a plastic bag and add the chicken. Definitely use thighs and breast with bones and skin. I served with skewered mango that I sprinkled with ancho chili powder and grilled and a simple salad. Don't skip the plaintains!

A perfect blend of sweet and spicy. Yum! I used 3 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts and yellow/black (semi-ripe) plantains. I marinated the chicken for about 40 minutes. The marinade is tasty and smells wonderful with the fresh thyme. I don't have a big grill, only a George Foreman. I had to cook the chicken and plantain separately. I served it with rice and a green salad. Different and delicious! I've always wanted to go to Jamaica and now I have even more reason!

I liked the chicken but am not sure how this is Jamaican. My ex husband is a Jamaican chef and we go there a few times a year. Have never had plantains cooked that way, I actualy made them the way eveyr Jamaican I know cooks them which is to fry them in oil. The chicken done with legs and thighs was very good, though I had to leave out the molasses.

This is a perfect grilled chicken recipe! The other reviewers should try again with legs and thighs--that will make the difference. The skin gets perfactly carmelized and the cayenne and allspice provide wonderful flavor. I served this with Kemp's black beans and rice (from this website) and lettuce wedges and mangoes!

made this tonight. i wasnt too thrilled about it. things that may have proven to be cons in my preperation: like cari, i used boneless/skinless chicken breast, so that may have had something to do with it. i also dont have anything to puree the ingredients with, so i just simply mixed them. and being that i live in NYC, i dont have access to a grill, so i just simply baked the chicken in the sauce, which actually left the meat pretty tender. i think the recipe as is was a bland for me, i think next time, ill definitely amp up the amount of spices used. and i cant stress enough the importance of using the blackest plantains you can find!

Made this in my mini-Cuisinart using green onions and skipping the cayenne. I marinated it for two hours and used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Really good marinade. I'll make it again -- and i don't like molasses!

Its a hot Chicago summer afternoon and this Jamaican-style grilled chicken and plantains hit the spot. The allspice in the barbecue sauce gave it an exotic flavor. The chicken would have been even better if it had marinated longer than 15 minutes. I served it with basmati rice. http://michaelbeyer.wordpress.com/2010/07/17/grilled-chicken-and-plantains-jamaican-style/
