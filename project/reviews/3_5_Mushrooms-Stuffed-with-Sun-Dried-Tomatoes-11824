i made these for a holiday party and they were a big hit! i increased the tomatoes, mushrooms and shallots that are called for and i used italian bread crumbs as that is what i had in the house, but i think the best addition was the balsamic reduction that i drizzled on after they came out of the oven. the sweet tanginess of the reduction goes great with the sundried tomatoes.

My guests loved this recipe. I used sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil instead of the dried tomatoes. It cut down on time and added enough moisture I didn't need the Tbsp of liquid. I also omitted the cheese to make the recipe non-dairy.

Delish! I used sun dried tomatoes packed in oil because they were what I had on hand. I used a bit of the oil from the sd tomatoes to brush onto the mushroom caps before stuffing them. They turned out beautifully! (Like previous reviewers, I also added a clove of garlic into the stuffing mixture.)

These were yummy! Don't worry if they're sitting out for guests to munch and they get cold, cause they still taste great! Everyone liked them! I made them in the morning and baked them before serving and they held up very well.

this recipe was so tasty, even the pickiest of picky teenagers ate all the mushrooms!!

These being white mushrooms, they're acceptable for pot-lucking, but not special enough for when it's just us. Disclaimer: we could be elitist, as we have yet to find a stuffed mushroom recipe worth repeating.

I gave this 4 forks based on the alterations I made to the recipe (based on other reviewer's suggestions); used oil packed tomatoes and added garlic. They were amazingly good -- even my husband who does not like tomatoes enjoyed them! Will definitely make again, and will try w/ feta or goat cheese next time.

These were great--and drew rave reviews from my partner. He thought they were better than the other stuffed mushroom recipe :-) I brushed the mushroom caps with white wine before baking them. Followed the other reviewers and added extra tomatoes and used all the mushroom stems--left out shallots because of allergies. I left out the bread crumbs and added extra Parmesan cheese to remove carbs from the dish.

This recipe was quadrupled for a large cocktail party and they were very good. I did take in to account some of the previous recommendations for some enhancement. Used all stems, added garlic, almost doubled or tripled the sundried tomatoes (used ones in oil for more flavor), added 1/4 teaspoon of salt, used fresh parsley and basil and cooked mushrooms in half white wine and half olive oil. Forgot to add the parmesan.

Made this for a party and they were well received. I added some of this kalamata olive spread that I had laying around, which punched up the stuffing and worked nicely. Serve while hot or the mushroom flavor may overpower the stuffing.

I made this for christmas bash, they weren't the fastest dish to go., I don't like mushrooms, so i didn't try them, but they looked great. easy

These mushrooms are fantastic. I used all of the stems instead of just 1cup, extra garlic, and no shallots (allergies to onions). The mushrooms were definately overstuffed and delicious. Hardly needed the cheese on top.

Our Christmas Day guests loved these mushrooms. They were gone within minutes. I used a little more tomatoes than called for as well as a heaping 1/4 cup of the shallots only because I had already minced them. I ran out of plain dry bread crumbs so used the Italian flavored.

This item was one of several made during an annual Christmas progressive dinner in my neighborhood. I also used slightly more dried tomatoes and added minced garlic. It takes a little doing, but the result is worth it.

I would not make this recipe again. It was lacking something. I found it very bland.

These mushrooms disappear quickly every time I make them! This recipe is definitely a keeper because it tastes good and is easy to prepare.

We recently made these for a party at our house,and they disappeared before we got any! All our guests said they were great though. We'll make them again and see for ourselves!

Bleuch! What a waste of ingredients. I decided to try something other than my usual crab stuffed mushrooms (which are always a hit) and after reading the reviews thought that this recipe sounded great. Was I wrong. Bland bland bland. Perhaps using a little garlic or some other herbs other than parsley would help (thyme may be a good addition). Also maybe sundried tomatoes packed in olive oil may help the flavour. I will definitely not make this recipe again.

I made these for our cocktail party and they were a hit! I added more sun-dried tomatoes than the recipe called for just because I had extra. I, also, substituted asiago for the parmesan because that is what I had on hand. I was very please with the combination of flavors and the presentation that the mushrooms made. I would definitely make this recipe again.

Very good and delicious! Very easy to make... We used small mushrooms, which make them very mouth-popping!

This was a huge hit at my cocktail party. I received a lot of requests for the recipe. Definetely a keeper.

I used cremini mushrooms, scallions in place of the shallots and romano cheese in place of parmesan. I had been warned by several people that they would take longer than anticipated, because stuffing the mushrooms is tedious, but I didn't have any problems at all. This was the only appetizer that was all gone at the end of the party!

The first time I made this i found it a little bland but had lots of potential. So I doubled the quantity of sun-dried tomatoes and added 1/4 tsp salt. I also reduced the quantity of oil to cook the stems by 1 Tbsp and added 1 Tbsp white wine. Hope it turns out as fantastic for everyone else as it did for me!

This was my first attempt at stuffed mushrooms, and I was surprised by how easy and tasty this recipe is. Even guests who aren't big mushroom fans liked these. The sundried tomatoes give them a really hearty, earthy flavor. I'd definitely make them again.

I doubled the sundried tomatoes and it was fabulous! All of the guests really enjoyed them!

These are delicious. I prefer to use fresh basil when I make these. About 1/4 cup fresh basil instead of the parsley. I've also added chopped pine nuts to the stuffing. And to avoid the cost of shallots, I use finely chopped onion and garlic. I've even used pesto in place of the basil. They always turn out great.

It was a little bland, a little too light. I think it needed some oil or perhaps more salt, couldn't decide
