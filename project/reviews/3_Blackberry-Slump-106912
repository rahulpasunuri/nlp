A very boring use of blackberries. I wouldn't waste my berries on this recipe.

Delicious. I added a splash of Amaretto. Deleted the melted butter. Next time will add tapioca to thicken.

I thought it was okay, nothing too great about it. The filling was really watery but mixing some ice cream into it solved that problem. I probably won't make this again because it just didn't stand out.

I give this a 3 fork rating because it was easy, quick, and delicious. The only thing I did different was I added vanilla to the batter.

Used the full amt. of sugar, as my berries were quite sour. It didn't seem to suffer from substituting skim milk. Divine with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.

The only reason I won't make it again is because the hubby wouldn't eat it all. We've found better ways to eat our blackberries.

The melted butter instead of solid butter or shortening makes this very fast to whip up and an excellent foil to fresh blackberries. The better the berries, the better this will be. We used about 1/2 the sugar. Definitely try it with vanilla ice cream.

"Bland"? This recipe does an excellant job of enhancing and preserving fresh berry flavor. I cut down the amount of sugar I used on the berries to 1/2 cup since my blackberries were very sweet. The dessert went over so well, I made it again the next night, but with blueberries. The blackberries had enough acidity, but the blueberries could have used a squeeze of lemon. Also, next time I might try making the batter with 1% or 2% milk, since I don't usually keep whole milk in the house. This recipe will stay a classic in our home.

Just made this for a dinner party and it was a BIG hit. After reading other reviews, I sprinkled a bit of lemon juice on the berries and used a bit less sugar with allspice over them. Perfect balance of sweet and tart. So easy to make and the berries don't get overwhelmed or overcooked.

I used a combination of strawberries, blueberries and blackberries. I added a dash of cinnamon to the batter and squeezed a little lemon juice over the berries. Very good! Next time I will add less sugar, as I don't think it needed 3/4 cup on top, The berries are in season and sweet enough.

I make this recipe all the time. It is so easy! I almost never use just blackberries, though. I have done Blackberry & rasberry, rasberry & strawberry, strawberry & plum, all plum, plum & apple etc. Basically, this topping is easy to make and makes a yummy dessert out of all the fruits I have thrown in it. I also halved the recipe with success the other day, as I have found that it doesn't necessarily keep well. Serve it with a good vanilla ice cream and you will have people licking their bowls.

Went blackberry picking yesterday. Blackberries are invasive weeds in this part of the country, and grow wild everywhere, even in the middle of the city. I needed to find something easy to do with all those berries, and decide to try this recipe. After reading other comments, I was worried it might be bland. So after I put the sugar on the berries, I sprinkled on a little red wine vinegar, cardamom and allspice before pouring on the batter (I added cardamom and allspice to the batter too). I followed the lead of another person here and used skim milk (all I had in the house) and omitted the butter. The result is absolutely delicious. My eyes practically rolled back in my head when I tasted it! And so easy! Will make this one again, with my modifications.

I concur this is a great and fast recipe. I used 50% frozen berries to lower the cost, and you could tell the difference. I am going to try mixed berries next.

Yes, I would deffinately make this recipe again. It is one of my family favorites. It is a great alternative to the rich, chocolate, or butter type desserts. My family prefers desserts with more fruit in them. I have used this will frozen berries of all types. They were all great, and a lot less expensive then fresh berries. Berries are picked at the peak of the season and frozen immediately so the quaility of the berries is usually quite good.

It's a fine way to put blackberries to use. Add a little lemon juice and voila, it's improved and delightfully full-flavored. Otherwise it's on the bland side. This recipe has that old-fashioned comfort food appeal and everyone loved it here!

This is one of my favorite desserts - simple and fast. It's not at all fancy - it tastes of blackberries and biscuits. Very homey. Ice cream really completes the dish.

This is really simple. Sometimes simplicity is just want you need, it brings out the flavor of the blackberries, which in themselves are great. I wouldn't call this dish bland at all, it's just not really fancy. It doesn't need to be fancy. Great!!!! I used frozen blackberries and they worked just fine. And vanilla ice cream, of course.

I should have heeded the "bland" warnings given by other reviewers, this was nothing special. Skip it and try the Blackberry Upside-Down Cake on this website instead, that's a winner.

This recipe was very boring and was a little on the bland side. It was easy but not worth making again

This is a no fuss dish perfect for a big group of guests. I divided the berries between two pie dishes and made double the topping. Popped it in the oven during dinner. Excellent warm with vanilla ice cream. Not too sweet. Everyone left with the recipe.

Turned out looking just like the picture--very inviting! But it WAS bland. Cobbler is better, and berry pie or tart is even better, so why make it again? But, it did get eaten, no problem.

This is the lost "cobbler" that my grandmother used to make. I tried it with rhubarb (use 1 c. sugar) and it was dreamy. I love this dish.

I am making this again tonight - it's so easy and versatile! Yes, it's somewhat bland, but you can play with different spices and fruit to suit your preference and what's in season. We just added a scoop of ice cream, and it was perfect. This literally took me 5 minutes to prepare. We omitted the butter and used skim milk, no problems!

It was quick to put together but tasted pretty bland. I'll probably add some allspice and cinnamon next time.

Very good, added nectarines and less sugar
