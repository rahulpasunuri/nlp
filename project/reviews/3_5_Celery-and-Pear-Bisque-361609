This soup was wonderful. The one thing I did was to remove the strings from the celery. It makes a smoother soup. The guests raved and will make it again...soon

Did not like it at all and my husband could not eat it. It has a ghastly light green blah color that matches the flavor or lack thereof. And it's a lot of work for what you get. Gave it one fork because celery is nutritious. But I would rather make a quick nutritious and delicious soup by sauteing shallots or leeks, adding broth and sliced zucchini, and then at the end add a lot of fresh spinach sans the stems. Liquify it in blender and I have very nutritious and delicious soup in only 1/2 hour.

This is really good. I didn't puree til smooth because I prefer textured soup. Wonder what it would be like with a little wild rice? It does take a bit to prepare and cook, but I will make it again. Very creamy for having no cream. :)

This is so simple to make- very elegant....strained as suggested - so good- can't wait to make again.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was an excellent starter to our meal. The most time intensive was cutting the veggies. There was also a lot of cut pear leftover since it seemed just sweet enough with what was added. Used the immersion blender in the pot and it came out perfectly smooth.

This was edible, but only just. I found the celery and leek flavors overwhelming, and the color changed to an unappetizing brown after a night in the fridge. Will not make this again.

I was shocked at how delicious this soup was! There was now way one could guess it was celery pear soup. The flavors were more like a potato leek soup with a slight sweetness.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a perfect appetizers for our meal. It was just sweet enough but had the root flavor of celery. It was very easy to make, but definitely the chopping took up a lot of time. I used an immersion blender to puree which made it very smooth, so I didn't have any consistency problems. Will definitely make this again!

This was very good and will make again for Christmas. I had the same problem as the cook from Brooklyn - did not puree well and was very chunky with unpleasant texture. I strained out all of the solids so it had the consistency of a bisque. Very flavorful. I'll try cooking the vegies longer next time.

I happened to have celery, pears, and leeks on hand when Bon Appetit arrived, and this sounded interesting so I whipped it up. We loved it--the surprise factor is great--we would have kept guessing at ingredients if we hadn't known them. Lovely color, too. I'm serving it to my family as part of a post-Thanksgiving tasting menu, so we'll see how it fares with non- foodies.

I thought this was a great light soup with subtle flavours - perfect for a starter course. I doubled the amount of fresh thyme and went heavy on the salt and pepper. I also used homemade turkey broth, so I think the broth I used had more flavour than regular chicken broth. And I cut down on the amount of butter with no problems.

This is a wonderful recipe. There is a little sweet with the pear and more subtle celery. I used regular cooking onions, rather than the tops of the leeks and thought the result was very good.

i had some beautiful, delicate celery and this recipe seemed perfect for it. i think the taste of this soup is wonderful and different. the only problem i have with my batch is that some the vegs didn't puree that well (the leek tops, mainly) so there's a slight texture problem. i'm thinking of straining through a chinois. anyway, i do think this is a lovely, original fall recipe.

This was interesting, with a very distinct flavor. (Sort of like potato leek soup with a sweet/tangy after taste.) I liked this soup, but I don't think it's for everyone.

I made this recipe with 2 cups of celery from my local csa and 4 cups of other organic celery, bartlett pears from my csa and the dark tips of baby leeks also from the csa. while the bisque was tasty, i don't think i'd make it again unless i had a huge amount of celery to use up, the pear didn't shine through. on the other hand, very quick and easy to make, 10 minutes of chopping + 20 minutes of cooking and about 5 minutes to immersion blend.
