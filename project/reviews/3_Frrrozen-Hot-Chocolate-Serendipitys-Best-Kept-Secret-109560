I LOVE this recipe and dessert. Very simple and easy to follow. I don't know why I don't make it more often. Serendipity iii is also quite a cute place to slurp a frrrozen hot chocolate with a date :) In honor of this recipe I also made a video tutorial/tribute of my own. You can see it here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVCfQkAad-8

I am a huge chocolate lover & made this for my friend's birthday treat. I wasn't impressed. I followed the recipe to the 't' except I used Lindor chocolate bars. It was okay but nothing I would rave about. It needed to be creamer.

Well this was a hit to my 2 chocoholics. I used mint cocoa from a Starbuck's gift set we got for Christmas, and I only had white chocolate chips- which worked well actually. I also used powdered non- fat milk (it was late on a Sunday, had to use what I had on hand!) I topped it with crushed chocolate wafer cookies and a couple of the chips and served in hurricane glasses. I wasn't as creamy as a shake, it was perfectly slushy.

Although not the same as the famous Serendipity version, I've gotten closer with a few tries. And none of these tasted like milkshakes as suggested in other reviews (I think you may have blended too much-I recall the real Serendipity version being much more 'icy' than creamy smooth). I used store bought cocoa, but not the old standard. I upgraded to one from San Francisco if you know what I mean. That helped a ton! And of course its true that the real one uses handmade chocolate varieties that arent easy to come by, so for my pedestrian version, I just upgraded to a slightly higher grade, less sweet chocolate. This is getting closer. On my next try, I think Ill try some actual chocolatier chocolates. You really can tell the difference in grades of chocolate for this recipe.

Okay, while it is nowhere near as good as Serendipity's, it is a good recipe. My boyfriend LOVED it. He's very easy to please, but I also liked it. I made it with low fat milk bc it was all I had, but I have a feeling it would be MUCH better with whole milk. Anyway, I enjoyed it for what it was, but it can't really be compared to the original. It is fun to eat with someone though!

What happened to Urquie's recipe in the reviews?

I saw a friend w/the serendipity's mix and i am 7mths preggo and couldn't get it outta my mind. Not having the elite ingredients... i made my own fabulous creation. I used whatever hot chocolate mix i had, and just plain semi sweet morsels. I did add 2 tablespoons of duce de leche instead of sugar, a pinch of sea salt, and a tbsp of coconut oil to the melting chocolate to give a better palate. I also used vanilla rice milk instead of cows milk. It was pretty outstanding! will definitely make again.

having the original in NYC... this is nothing like that. I have the serendipity cookbook which has the original recipe and you most certainly cannot use just a regular hot cocoa mix to get the infamous results of the original. The cocoa mix and chocolate they use is several varieties of the best chocolates available. Why this is even comparative, I have no idea. It's just a good milkshake. Serendipity's will change your life. ;)

If you want a REAL Frozen Hot Chocolate, all you have to do is go to your LOCAL Dairy Queen!!! It's a mix of the frozen ice, ice creme and their cocoa fudga, topped with whipped creme, I always tell them to leave the lid off. It's like HEAVEN! If I were to die and had to as for one food item to eat before, I'd pick this Dairy Queen Frozen Hot Chocolate!!!!

Definitely not worth the time and effort! Tasted just like regular chocolate milkshake... soo disappointing!! I guess i'll have to wait for a trip to NY to try the real deal !

warning: never buy the pre-packaged serendipity frrrrrozen hot chocolate mix. it is disgusting. a waste of good milk and ice.

Rating: 1
I've never had the real thing but this was just so-so. Nothing to die for like I've heard the real stuff is. I used high quality hot choco. and chocolate and I was not impressed. I was bummed that it seemed to miss something. I may try it again and use whole milk or a heavy cream to see if the taste gets better.

This rating is NOT for the rip-off "recipe" printed above, but for the 1996 one from Chocolatier - kindly posted by urquie. GOD BLESS YOU, URQUIE!!

Never tasted the real thing, only have heard about it. Followed recipe exactly and was underwhelmed. Needs more...something. Chocolate, sugar, cream???

The buildup for this recipe was so tremendous that I couldn't wait to try the recipe. What a disappointment. Won't make this one again. Maybe I did something wrong, but the texture sure wasn't creamy -- it was gritty.

hmmm - i don't really know what all the fuss is about with this recipe - give me chocolate haagen das, milk and a blender over this - any day!

This was very good! Nice and refreshing. I used Callebaut bittersweet chocolate and unsweetened cocoa.

I made this Friday night with ingredients I had on hand. I used two different kinds of chocolate--semisweet and bittersweet, melted them with a little of the milk, and I used cocoa because I didn't have any hot chocolate mix (the darker the better anyway, when it comes to chocolate). I made half the recipe which was plenty for my husband and me. I wouldn't really expect Serendipity to reveal all their secrets--most restaurants don't list brand names when they give their recipes to Gourmet or Bon Appetit, but they have given us the recipe--it's simple to follow, you can use whatever chocolate you want, and I thought my own version was just as good as theirs!

Made it for my daughter and she loved it (note, though, it makes enough for two). I melted the chocolate with a little cream an stirred regular Nestles Quik into that with the sugar and it was delicious. Had the real thing about 30 years ago and don't remember if it's as good, but it's easy and yummy and certainly worth the little effort.

You can also buy the Serendipity 3 Frrrozen Hot Chocolate mix at Williams Sonoma and get the "actual" flavor---although having it in a big frozen ice cream glass amid all the kitsch in NYC is the best experience...

Rating: 0
While this recipe sounds delectable, it is a letdown to have no actual ingredients and instead vague categories, making for easy adaptablity of the recipe, yes, but also no way to make the EXACT Serendipity Frrrozen Hot Chocolate any Serendipity diner has come to love and salivate after. Thus as a recipe for "Frrrozen Hot Chocolate: Serendipity's Best-Kept Secret" it falls short.

To the accountant: Your numbers work may be correct but if you read how to review a recipe, the forks rate how tasty the dish is. A separate part of the review asks if you would make it again. A recipe could have two forks but if the cook would make it again, it would give towards the 100% rating.

Rating: 0
Well, shame on Epicurious. This is not a recipe, it's a thinly disguised bid for notoriety. Epicurious says 100% would make it again. I counted more 3-forks than 4-forks, and 'way more NO-FORKS! I am an accountant, but even the math challenged know that a preponderance of 3-forks does NOT 100% make! As for the recipe: bogus!!! A "recipe" with unclear and/or ambivalent ingredients is just a cheat. As for the restaurant's claim regarding Jackie Kennedy, too bad she's dead and can't sue for the shameless exploitation of her name. I won't be wasting any ingredients, nor will I visit (or mention) the shabby restaurant. Count me a NO-FORK!!!

In the early 50's in Jerusalem, the Cafe Allenby served Iced Chocolate that was so thick, you had to eat it with a spoon. It was refreshing, delicious, and not as sweet as this recipe. I don't know how it was made, but this is a wonderful substitute. I think it takes being creative. Our taste buds are all different. This is a good recipe - and it can be modified to taste.

I very much liked Shaismom's suggestion about the sweetened condensed milk. It brought back very fond memories of my sadly limited time spent on the island of Guadeloupe. We started each day with hot chocolate made this way....yummy

I recommend using sweetened concentrated milk instead of regular milk and granular sugar - or try confectioner's sugar instead- it will make it less 'sandy'. great recipe.

Rating: 0
I haven't made this (yet), but the "Publisher's Weekly" review says "A whole chapter is devoted to the most lavishly praised dessert, Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, along with its many variations." So that my answer some of the questions regarding type of chocolate, etc.

Rating: 4
the sugar left it a little grainy, so make sure that it is really well dissolved. Otherwise, I thought it was great..tasted close to the real thing. I used Ghiardelli powder and Droste pastilles in milk and dark chocolate.

I think this recipe is just a teaser. Think about it. If the recipe is so old, how many hot chocolate mixes and different chocolates were sold in the stores. It mentions cocoa not mix in the recipe. That is what I used. The melted chocolate adds flavor.

Rating: 0
But the same holds true on the chocolate -- the recipe says to use a variety of your favorite chocolate but provides no details on which combination or brands the restaurant prefers. I suppose if you use good quality ingredients both in terms of the chocolate and hot chocolate mix, you can't go wrong.

Rating: 0
I think what is confusing is that the recipe states "hot chocolate" mix, and then in the body of the recipe it references mixing cocoa. I would certainly imagine that you would get very different results based upon what type of chocolate and hot chocolate mix you use, and they must have brands they prefer.

To the cook on 6/28, do you know what the "real ingredients" should be, or are you just complaining that it's so simple that you can make it with whatever is in your kitchen cupboard? (If you know something we don't, why don't you share?)

they didn't even reveal the real ingredients!?!?! that's not really divulgence. :(
