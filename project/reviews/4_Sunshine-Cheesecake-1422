Ive been making this cheesecake every Easter since 1992 when my copy of Bon Appétit arrived in the mail with this on the cover! My family and friends LOVE IT! The orange and ginger flavors are divine and the candied oranges make this such a beautiful and special Spring/Easter dessert! I've been making it the same way for ten years (with the added splash of Grand Marnier in the batter!) and wouldn't dream of making it without the candied oranges (I don't think my family and friends would let me!) The oranges are time consuming but worth it! I buy firm, seedless oranges and slice them with a very sharp knife and its always work fine for me. (A couple of times I've been forced to use oranges with seeds which I carefully removed after slicing and before cooking.) I agree with the others who advise removing the slices before cutting - if you don't it'll be a mess. WOW! hard to believe I've been making this cheese cake for TEN YEARS! It's really that delicious!

tangogowench on 02/11/06 I have made this spectacular cheesecake three times. The candied oranges are so popular that I now make extra slices because people kept stealing them off the top of the cake. I had no trouble slicing the oranges by hand whereas I had no success using a mandoline for this task. I wound up with enough candied orange slices to decorate the second cake which I baked two weeks later. I followed a previous reviewers advice to simmer slowly to avoid breakage. I experimented with "Cara" oranges which are less tart and have a blood color but I found these less attractive and cloyingly sweet. The tartness of regular oranges keeps them from becoming too sweet. I also add Grand Marnier to them. These oranges were so beautiful that I even photographed them. They looked like stained glass. I heavily overlapped the orange slices on the cake so that every thin slice of cake would get its own candied orange slice. To cut the cake sneak your knife under the orange slices and then cut through the cake. This way you can place an orange slice on each piece of cake. It is impossible to cut through the orange slices when they are on top of the cake. The third time I made this cake I dipped one side of each orange slice in the reduced syrup and then put them on the waxed paper to dry. I did this so that each overlapping orange slice would be fully glazed. The down side was that this made the oranges more difficult to handle when it came time to decorate the cake as they were stickier. I did not make any changes to the cake and crust except that to save money the second time I used Trader Joe's Ghiradelli white chocolate. There really was not much of a difference in the taste. My cakes never cracked or sagged. It almost was a shame to put the orange slices on top. Too bad we can't include photographs here because this is a gorgeous magazine cover cake.

Wow very dissappointed. Followed recipe exactly with no substitutions. Ginger taste was not prominent - orange slices were so so (and yes I cooked them to doneness and yes I sliced them appropriately thin and yes I even removed them for slicing.) None of my guests ate them and no one liked the accompagnying sickly sweet gunk that was letf over. It had no kick, just orange sugar. I would completely remove white chocolate from recipe, it's just guilding the lily - oranges & ginger have a lovely taste all on their own. In future, if I was forced to repeat this excercise, I would experiment with different kinds of citrus - Mineolas, tangerines, kuquats, etc. All this to say it was more trouble than it's worth - my favorite is still the triple cherry cheesecake. Thanks for letting the rant.

I am shocked as to why this good such good reviews. I make LOTS of cheesecakes off this site, followed this ones recipe exactly and its nothing special at all. In fact, it is too rich doesnt have much flavor. I even added extra rind and juice to the filling and still no flavor. My favorite on this site still is Mrs. Marshalls Cheesecake..

I did this for Thanksgiving. It was a beautiful, big hit. It looked "expensive" however the kids just liked it with the "orange stuff taken off"! Bright and fabulous!!!

When I received my March, 1992 issue of Bon Appetit, this was on the cover. Never before, or since, has there been a more beautiful cover photo. I had to try it! I've made it no less than 50 times since then, and it continues to be my most requested dish of any kind. I have never changed the recipe, except to add a splash of Gran Marnier to the batter, as well as the glaze, just before the oranges are done. I do find that they require three to four hours, so start early, and don't be in a hurry. It is impossible, no matter how tender you make the oranges, to cut through the cake with them on top. Remove the slices from the portion of the cake you are cutting, and set them aside. Then place them directly atop the plated slice.

Excellent cheesecake with a nice bright flavor! The combination of orange and ginger is wonderful. I recommend using Trader Joe's Triple Ginger Snaps for lots of ginger flavor!

Three and a half forks...this cheesecake is really nice...I recently made the double decker raspberry/white chocolate cheesecake and thought this was MUCH better! The flavor combinations are nice, with the white chocolate not overpowering. If anything, more ginger flavor might have made it slightly better. Great consistency, even using low-fat cream cheese. For those who like orange and ginger, this cheesecake is a must!

Very good texture and taste. I used 2 blocks of regular cream cheese and 2 blocks of reduced fat. I also only used 6 ounces of Bakers white chcolate. I didn't do the orange glaze but agree that it would add to the presentation.

After looking at this for months, I decided to try it for a baby shower.It was excellent.I used Voortman Windmill cookies for the crust- in a 10" pan, about 20 cookies bought in bulk was close to 3 cups (I added another 1/2 cup of graham crumbs0 I used 3.5 packages of Philly 'Cream Cheese & 1 full bag of Chipits white chocolate chips.I don't think using imported ($$) white chocolate could have made it any better.Yes, the candied oranges took forever to make and looked nice on top, but next time I would cut the cooked oranges into 1/4s or 1/8s and make a mosaic type pattern on top, instead of the whole orange slice. The whole slices made cutting the cake difficult and my only complaint was the cake looked terrible as soon as I started cutting.

Very beautiful and quite tasty! I didn't find the oranges particularly hard to make, but I would recommend cutting the slices in half before putting them on the cheesecake as it's hard to cut through them.

This cheesecake is great! I made it for a friends birthday and it has now become the standard birthday cake. The oranges make it look amazing.

great cake. the texture of the filling is great and the candied oranges add a great twist. maybe i would make a little less sweet. but it was amazing!

Happiness-inducing. not owning a mandoline or even a decent knife, i got into trouble with the candied oranges. the ones that made it tasted a little too much like orange gumdrops to me... i didn't think they were necessary anyway--the cake itself is easy to make and completely wonderful to eat.

Excellent. Loved the orange and ginger combo. Didn't plan to do the orange slices on top until the top cracked in the middle. They were a pain and took MUCH longer than 2 hours, but the presentation was beautiful. I was unsure about covering the entire top since I didn't know if people would like them so I cut them in half and made a pinwheel design in the middle and skipped the orange glaze. Those who tried them loved them. I'd make them again.

Outstanding cheesecake. My gourmet club loved it, even those who professed not to be fans of ginger. Based on tips from reviews, I also halved the ginger crisp crackers for the base and substituted graham crumbs for the other half, which was fine, but unnecessary. The candied orange topping is worth the effort too - very beautiful and tasty. I used oranges with seeds, since seedless aren't available here in summer, so the slices were less pretty than they could have been, but still attractive.

perfect perfect perfect cheesecake. i made this for easter dessert and everyone (who tried it) loved it. my bf said it was better than the caramel-chocolate cheesecake from this website, which is also to die for. i skipped the candied orange topping for lack of time, but would do it next time. i didnt however, find it to be a "lighter" cheesecake as some other reviewers said-- still rich and creamy and GOOD!

Wow, this is the best cheesecake I've ever eaten. Rich, creamy beyond compare, wonderfully blended and unique flavors, and beautiful. It takes quite a bit of time to make since the candied orange slices are time-intensive, but it's completely worth it. If you want to blow away your taste buds, and get ooo's and ahh's from your guests, try this cheesecake! And definitely do the orange slices; it adds a lot to the overall flavor, texture and interest. One small note regarding the reduced orange juice and ginger mix. I thought it was a typo when they said to reduce all of it to 3 tbsp, but it's not. It creates a wonderfully rich and deep flavor for the cheesecake. WOW! WOW!

I've made this twice now, and both times never bothered with the fancy orange topping thingies... it is delicious, substantial, and looks beautiful when it comes out of the oven. It is a snap to whip up in my Kitchenaid mixer, too. even people who dont like ginger or orange have loved it.

Beautiful and scrumptious! I made it exactly as written, and it was perfect. Don't skip the oranges....they add a lot to the presentation, and the to the taste as well. I used my mandoline to slice them, and it worked out well.

It was fabulous and not too difficult as most cheesecakes can be. Also it wasn't a "heavy" cheesecake, which made it perfect for the holidays.

I've made this recipe several times, it's quite good. 1) The cheesecake is rather "thick" and dense compared to most of the other recipes on Epicurious. You may want to check out the pistachio brittle cheesecake if you want something that tastes lighter (omit the cardamom, use the OJ/ginger reduction instead of pear nectar). 2) For those who had problems with the oranges, just keep cooking them until the slices are tender, they should get to a softness where you can easily eat the peel. 3) Also don't be afraid to throw away some of the thicker slices. Oranges are cheap after all. I used a normal knife and just did my best to slice them as thin as possible and kept the good slices. 4) I found the ginger snap crust to be a bit overpowering, so I used a mix pf graham, ginger, and vanilla wafers instead.

Great! Everyone I've served it to loved it. I use a Henkel bread knife to carefully slice the organges. I've alternated blood organges with tangelos for a really impressive presentation. Also, I usually spike the accompanying orange sauce with a jigger of Grande Marnier organge liquer to add some zip. I tell my guests it's like a Creamcicle for grown ups.

It was very good. The candied orange slices were a little thick. What equipment wouuld one use to make slice them paper-thin. Suggestions, welcome. Again, the cake was very good. It was time-consuming (boiling the oranges for 2 hrs), but was not work-intensive. work

I made this cheesecake for the wine bar I work for. I made a few changes. It was too hard to cut the oranges on top of the cheesecake so I put one orange slice on each piece. I also thought the syrup from the candied oranges had a slightly bitter taste. I added butter, brown sugar and cream to make an orange flavored caramel and put that on the plate. One customer has asked if I cater and would like me to make it for a party she's having and others have called to see if I've put it on the menu again.

I agree with one reviewer who said this would be great in the winter! It will be a welcome alternative to the traditional pumpkin pies. I had to feed this to people who didn't like ginger, so I used candied ginger with the OJ. I used graham crackers AND ginger snaps in the crust. Refreshing and beautiful!

This cheesecake had a great flavor and texture, but my orange slices weren't very tender. I loved it.

Served at a neighborhood Y2K party - was well liked. I don't think I will do the candied orange slices again, just fresh, peeled.

Can't wait till the next occasion,I really enjoyed making it.The ginger definitly gave it a special taste,I wouldn't mind adding a bit of ginger next time.

My roommate took some of the cheesecake with her to work, and her co-workers thought it was professional! I had thought that the cheesecake might be a bit heavy with 1/2 a pound of white chocolate in the recipe, but the ginger and OJ offset it nicely.

The candied oranges slices give this dessert a beautiful look and the white chocolate enhance rich taste. It's especially nice to serve in the middle of winter when a touch of sunshine is most welcome.
