Rather than peel and core the apples, I simply quartered them and cooked them with the cider until soft. I then put them through my food mill and followed the recipe, although after tasting I too added additional cinnamon and cloves. I had never tried the candied ginger before and love the flavor it adds. I find cooking the apples with the skin gives the butter a deeper flavor and color in addition to being a whole lot easier!

I definitely agree with the last cook-- I added lots of cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon in addition to the ginger and it tastes great! Exactly the type of recipe I was looking for. Also-- no need to use Macintosh apples. I used Gala and Granny Smith and it tastes wonderful

I found that the addition of 1/2 teaspoon each of cinnamon and cloves added appreciably to the flavour, otherwise, I found it a bit tasteless, but I would make it again with the added spices.

This was just OK. It wasn't my grandmother's, but it was fun to make on a chilly day.
