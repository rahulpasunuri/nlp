This was a wonderful surprise. I had leftover pinto beans and fresh Rosemary. I added finely grated lemon zest.

I made this dish to go with fajitas for a crowd...and it got raves. I had lots of requests for the recipe. I added sliced radishes to the beans for color and crunch.

This is my favorite bean salad. Use the best oil you can afford and if you're pressed for time, try canned canellini beans. They really work well.

I used kidney and white beans instead of pinto, and while it was a lovely bean salad, it didn't wow! me. A colorful and cheap table filler.

Since i just dinged a couscous dish I wanted to reward a dish that was great. So easy to prepare and very flavorful. I did add another can of pinto beans as there seemed to be too many onions. Not necessarily for Mexican dinner either.

Easy to prepare, fresh-tasting, and very good with lamb. Tastes best when only slightly chilled.
