It was okay, but not great. The flavors are a little harsh and it seemed dry to me.

After reading the comments I mixed for a full 4'- not sure if that helped but they didn't fall and cooked in about 23' (the batch I did for 24' was on the dry side). Used regular liners which didn't stick. Half of the frosting recipe was plenty for 30 cupcakes. It's really sweet so I'd recommend adding the sugar gradually and tasting a you go along.

Wonderful recipe! Moist cake. Fine crumb. I used only 3 cups of sugar and it was still sweet to me. Cinnamon scent is very evident but I like it that way. I omitted it for my girl's birthday cupcake. The batter is very runny so I used a jug to pour it into the cupcake case. It does get better after a day or two. Quite a fail safe recipe.

Delicious!!! I have to say, though, that I personally wouldn't increase the cinnamon. I used a little under the recommended tablespoon and thought it was plenty. I also skipped the mini chips b/c I prefer a smooth cake. Topped with a mocha buttercream. Definitely make these!

"The best cupcakes ever," exclaimed one of my colleagues after I brought a batch of these to work. After seeing all 40 cupcakes disappear within half an hour at a morning tea, I'm inclined to agree. These cupcakes are fudgy and dense with a wonderfully complex flavour, and pair beautifully with chocolate buttercream or the vanilla/almond frosting suggested in the recipe. A few notes: like other reviewers, I used regular cupcake papers instead of the panettone molds. I didn't spray the papers with nonstick vegetable oil spray either; it was unnecessary. Instead of 3/4 c vegetable oil in the batter, I used half melted butter and half olive oil. I also made sure that I filled the cupcake papers with batter only halfway, as these rise considerably during baking. Everything else I did as stated in the recipe -- even the time and temperature were exactly right. I'll certainly be making these again.

This is the messiest cupcake batter I have had to deal with. Maybe because I am a novice baker and I don't have the right tools? They taste good although not too sweet. I have not tried the icing with it yet.

Delicious cupcakes! I frosted most using the Almond Frosting recipe and a few I just sprinkled with powdered sugar (these are so good, they don't even need frosting!) I used cupcake molds instead of the paperpanettones and it made over 40 cupcakes. Baked at the time & temp per the recipe and they came out perfectly dense & moist. They did have flat tops, as some others have commented. I doubled the amount of cinnamon, per other reviewers' recommendations.

Rating: 4
Someone also told me I should quit my day job when I made these! I used regular cupcake wrappers (made 36), added 2X cinnamon as one reviewer suggested, and iced with cream cheese frosting (cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla). They were firm to the touch at 18-20 min, so I took them out early; they were still a bit undone in the middle, but at least they were fudgy and not dry like many cupcakes tend to be. They were just incredible.

I dont know whether they were supposed to be fudgy in texture or spongy but the taste was good. following the original recipe it was very fudgy, so I added extra flour 1/2 cup to it.

I made half a recipe and it came out perfect even at 6000 ft altitude in the cloud forest of Costa Rica. I have had no success with cakes and muffins at altitude - even when adjustments are made but these were perfect as is. I used a simple whipped ganache frosting on some and a sifting of cocoa and confectioners sugar on the rest. A huge hit with friends and family, young and old!

The flavor of these cupcakes is truly extraordinary. The best devil's food I've ever eaten. I made these for a tea party a few weeks ago, and the crowd descended on them, leaving not a crumb behind after about ten minutes. However, as with hivemaster (8/9/10), these did not rise as much as I would have liked. They didn't sink, but they didn't get that nice convex surface one wants from a cupcake. I did use cake flour, maybe that was the problem. Next time I will bake at a slightly higher temperature, using regular flour.

Rating: 4
I completely disagree with the last reviewer - this is a great recipe. I think you have to follow the recipe closely. I used regular cupcake wrappers and it turned out fine (but made a lot of cupcakes). These have a unique flavour, but still a rich chocolate flavour. I always get requests for the recipe when I make them. Be sure to bring to room temperature before serving.

I have been using eipcurious for years and have never "reviewed" any recipe....but I HAVE to for this one. This is the WORST recipe EVER!! DO NOT waste your time. I have spent the last 30 minutes trying to get the cupcakes out of the tins! I wanted perfect "cone" cupcakes for a baby shower & am so glad that I did a "trial run" because I am not sure I could even give these to my kids. Flat tops, spread out and baked onto the top of the cupcake tin. Zero forks!

Rating: 4
These are absolutely AMAZING! People tell me I should quit my day job when I make these. I did double the cinnamon for this recipe and even chopped regular chocolate chips becuase I didn't have the mini's. I used regular cupcake pans, and the time to cook also took more like 30 minutes rather than the time indicated on the recipe. Other than that - the recipe is spot on!

Rating: 4
In a word, these cupcakes are HEAVENLY! I've boosted the cinnamon dosage once or twice, which gives the chocolate great depth. I've made them several times, with the same response from family and friends every time: the best cupcake they've ever had, hands down. I've made them with the almond frosting, which was yummy, and have also made a basic chocolate cream cheese frosting (my favorite!) Try these! You won't be sorry.

Rating: 4
This recipe constantly meets rave reviews. Moist & rich with hints of coffee and cinnamon--people literally ask for these monthly. I have made them both with and without the mini chocolate chips and they are still lovely. Try one fresh out of the oven, they are delish!

Made thses last week for a bake sale and am making them again for another bake sale this weekend(tripled recipe) made no changes to the recipe this time. Moist,rich and delicious. My mother in law couldn't stop eatting the batter:) Highly recommend!!

I don't like giving a low review, but frankly, the texture of these cupcakes is icky. The FLAVOUR is great, but the texture is a bit dry and crumbly and dense. I prefer a spongier cupcake. I've made these a couple of times and they haven't really been huge hits.

Rating: 3
I made these as regular cupcakes with the vanilla frosting (rave reviews!), and without adding the chocolate chips. The texture is perfect - light and rich - but the cinnamon is kind of lost once you ice them. The base chocolate recipe is so great that I will modify it (almond, coconut, or orange instead of cinnamon) for many future occasions.

I've made these three times this summer. So moist and delicious. Kids and adults liked them. I love the vanilla frosting and used a Wilton cupcake frosting decorator. They looked like I purchased them at a bakery! I didn't use panettone molds, just regular paper cupcake molds. They actually held up outside in the heat, too. I expected the mostly butter frosting to start melting, but it didn't.

These cupcakes were an enormous hit with my friend who is a chocolate fanatic. I used a "king-size" cupcake pan, baked at 325 for 30 minutes and they came out like moist miniature cakes. I am already planning on making them for a party next week.

Quite good! Have a special and interesting taste that's not overpowering.

These were absolutely delicious. I used regular cupcake/muffin liners and tins and filled each with 1/4 cup of batter. They puffed up nicely and did not fall in the middle. I would add more cinnamon next time. I made the vanilla-almond frosting which was good but I followed a fellow reviewer's proportions and made it the day ahead. I won't do that again, the frosting seemed a little greasy after it warmed up. Definitely a great recipe!!

Rating: 2
These had wonderful flavour, but I could not get them to rise or cook through properly (my younger son thought I had made "brownie bowls," they were so sunken in). Luckily I made them for family, because they were too sticky and misshapen to serve to guests...and why does this recipe make so many?!?!? Am I the only one who wonders if the cooking temperature is too low??? I've never seen cupcakes baked at 325....maybe that's why they never get a good swift rise. Don't tell me to follow the recipe carefully, because I did, and my oven is calibrated. I am not at high altitude, and would like to make these again, but not if I'm going to have 40 mini fudge bowls again. Help!

Rating: 4
These are fabulous cupcakes, but need modification for higher altitude (~4500ft). The first time I made them as written (in cupcake liners), the tops fell dreadfully. Tasted great, but you could not remove the cupcake as a whole from the liner. I made them a week later with these adjustments: decreased 1/2c sugar, added 3Tbs flour, and added an extra egg yolk. They came out great! No sunken tops and they didn't crumble when removed from the liner! I also did not frost these. My kids, who normally are frosting maniacs, preferred them without. The second time I made them I also used water instead of coffee since I was making them for a classroom of kids in Salt Lake City. The LDS frown on coffee, even if it is decaf. I know, I know, the kids would never know. But, hey, I wouldn't slip bacon into food I was serving orthox Jews, either. The flavor was still very good, although I personally enjoy the complexity the coffee flavor adds. Note to batter tasters: the cinnamon flavor is much more pronounced in the uncooked batter than in the final cupcake. I was worried 1Tbs cinnamon was too much, but it was terrific. I made ~48 cupcakes from this recipe.

Rating: 4
Fabulous! The batter is thick enough to keep the chocolate chips in suspension, and yet they are suprisingly moist. I didn't care for the frosting though, I thought it was a little greasy. I baked these for a office B-Day and everyone raved!

Rating: 4
These are hands-down the best cupcakes I have ever had. I've made them several times and everyone around the table goes silent and, after scraping every scrap of crumbs from the cupcake liner, reaches for seconds and thirds. I've used Valrhona cocoa and omit the chocolate chips.

Rating: 0
These were absolutely perfect. I baked them for 27-28 minutes, and frosted them with a thin layer of dark chocolate ganache. After making 2 dozen, I still had batter left over, so I poured it into a small loaf pan and made a cake which I dusted with powdered sugar. Many of friends who frequent designer cupcake shops claimed they were the best cupcake they'd ever tasted! My only regret is not halving the recipe as I was not able to resist eating the leftovers for the rest of the week. Oh, and I also stirred in chocolate chips after pouring into muffin tins, and used Vahlrona cocoa powder, which I'm sure made a world of difference!

These were very good. After the first batch entirely collapsed in the middle, I made myself leave them in for an extra 5 minutes and they were perfect.

These cupcakes are fudgy and delicious! You almost have to eat them with a spoon. I used smallish cupcake papers and ended up with slightly more than 50 cupcakes (there was some cupcake snatching before I was able to count them). I also added slightly more cinnamon than called for, and I used half dark cocoa powder and half regular. We went with the vanilla frosting, rather than the almond, to accommodate a nut allergy. Who knows if there is actual almond in almond extract, but better safe than sorry. Our guests (all adults) gobbled them up.

Rating: 4
I added 1 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper and it took these cupcakes to another level. I forgot to add the chocolate chips and although the cupcakes were wonderful without them I do think they would be good so I'll try not to forget them next time. They were such a hit that someone actually said after eating one that cupcakes were making a major comeback. I couldn't agree more.

Rating: 4
I have made these cupcakes four or five times and each time they turn out great. I use regular cupcake papers instead of pannetone molds and fill them 2/3 full. They do not sink in the middle. I omit the chocolate chips and use a very high quality, dark vahlrona cocoa powder and espresso rather than coffee. If you are considering omitting the coffee, please reconsider because coffee truly deepens and enhances the flavour of the chocolate. The consistency of the cupcakes is fudgy and cakey and is quite wonderful. I also omit the frosting and instead, because they are so good on their own, just dust the tops with plain icing sugar. As one reviewer mentioned, if you are a fan of the double chocolate layer cake recipe found on this site, you will love these cupcakes. Absolutely gorgeous!

A fantastic recipe. I made mini cupcakes with this for a child's party (it yielded more than 96, bake for about 15-17 minutes) and both kids and adults raved. Will make again and again!

These cupcakes were a huge hit! I used regular cupcake papers. They still fell in the center, as a few others have mentioned, but it was nothing a dallop of frosting couldn't camouflage. I added a teaspon of cayenne and 3 tablespoons ancho chile pepper for a hot variation. They went well with a cinnamon white chocolate buttercream. I'd like to make some chocolate- dipped candied hot peppers to garnish next time around.

Rating: 4
Excellent! I did need a bit of extra time in the oven, and it is true that they overflow then sink in the middle, so the second round I didn't fill as full (about 1/3 in from top). I used cupcake holders and dropped the choc chips in at the last minute. Not being a coffee drinker, all I had around the house was instant espresso, and I think it really deepened the flavor of the chocolate. The Almond frosting is excellent (very sweet), and makes almost twice as much as you need. I might try it next time with frangelico.

Rating: 4
These are delicious. The cinnamon is such a great boost for the chocolate. I used a high-quality Chinese Cassia cinnamon from Penzeys. I think this really enhanced the flavor. One baking tip: make sure you mix the chips throughout, and stir as you are going. Otherwise you can wind up with some cupcakes that have a chocolate mass at the bottom.

I used the pannetone paper molds suggested and put in the 1/4 cup amount in each mold. I had batter leftover so I added a little more to half. The ones with more batter, I baked first at 325, they took a little longer to bake and sank a bit. The other ones with the 1/4 cup in each mold I baked at 350 for 24 minutes. They seemed to have baked correctly, but they did not come all the way up to the top of the paper molds. They are about 1 inch below the top of the paper. The ones that sank are about 1/2 inch from the top. I expected them to bake and puff up over the top. It may be better to just bake them in the regular muffin papers. It seems like everyone had success with them. I will be baking the Vanilla Cardamon ones tonight, I will let you know how those come out in the pannetone papers.

These cupcakes are great, as is the almond frosting. They are moist and tender with a very chocolatey flavor. I had no trouble whatsoever with this recipe. I followed the cupcake recipe quite closely, using less cinnamon however and baking in 24 muffin cups (paper lined and sprayed) plus I had enough batter for a nine-inch pan. The recipe makes a lot. I'm sure I could have made 3 dozen cupcakes if I'd had enough pans! Oh, I baked them for about 24 minutes, a little longer for the 9-inch pan. As for the frosting, I made a half batch but used only three cups of powdered sugar and extra cream. I made these cupcakes for a child's birthday party, and I noticed the kids ate 'em right up! I wouldn't hesitate to bake these again any day.

Ok, I always wish people would write thorough reviews of EXACTLY how they baked something so that if mine comes out oddly and someone else's is fantastic, I'll know why. So here you go:

I made this for a potluck at work and they got rave reviews. I pretty much made the recipe as stated except I only had dark chocolate cocoa powder so I used that. I'm surprise that no one else mentioned how thin this batter is. It was almost the consistancy of chocolate syrup. It was so thin that I was skeptical that they would turn out, but they did and they were great. I sprinked the choc. chips into the individual cupcakes so they didn't all sink to the bottom.

I made these cupcakes for a friends wedding shower and they were a hit. I do added a little extra cinnamon because i love it with chocolate

i've made this recipe twice and i've received rave reviews both times. i did do some modifications: i baked them in paper cupcake liners in a 12-cupcake tin (i couldn't find panettone molds), and i lightly floured the chocolate chips the second time so that they all wouldn't sink to the bottom. but other than that, absolutely delish! the hint of cinnamon and the almond frosting raise them above just a plain 'ol chocolate cupcake.

The best cake recipe ever! I made these cupcakes for my wedding and they were a hit(I even froze some ahead of time-they froze beautifully!) I ordered the larger cupcake liners from beryls.com and filled each with two level ice cream scoops. I piped on the frosting-they were both easy and gorgeous.

I made this recipe as written (except for halving the sugar, which I do for almost all recipes), but cooked in cupcake molds instead of the molds called for, and they turned out wonderfully as Valentine's Day gifts! I didn't frost them, and they are moist, delicious, and smell wonderful without. Next time, I will cut up the chocolate chips smaller--they all sank to the bottom when cooking, which was a little annoying when eating them! But I love love love these cupcakes and think they are appropriate for any occasion.

I followed the recipe to a T, these were divine! Fabulous! Rave reviews at the bridal shower I threw! I would definitely make these again, I am still receiving compliments on them!

Very moist and chocolatey, deliciously adult! I baked them in regular muffin moulds and they truly needed much more cooking time, up to 40 minutes for one batch. The texture is quite soft and stikcy, but what did help was to use 2 muffin paper liners for each cupcake. In my opinion, they are best frosted with a decadent chocolate frosting!

An update to my review from last year: I made these cupcakes along with the Orange Cardamom ones for my wedding in September, but due to a glitch, ended up serving them at other wedding events (rehearsal and BBQ). They disappeared so quickly, and even my mother, who tried to talk me out of baking the cake for my own wedding, is requesting them! The cake is so moist and chocolatey, and stood up very well to being frozen for 2 weeks. The icing was a tad on the sweet side, so I'll cut down the icing sugar. I added red food colouring to the icing to give it a pinkish tinge for "love". I already have requests to make this for Christmas!

These were really good - but I think I would enjoy them as much with a devil's food cake mix and added cinnamon and mini-chocolate chips. I did them with regular cupcake papers, but did them in a muffin pan - wouldn't do that again, they were terrible to get out.

If you like the "Double Chocolate Layer Cake" that has been receiving so many raves, you will love these. The recipe is very similar. One caution: do not try to eat these while they are still warm; they are not firm enough yet.

Yummy! So moist and rich! I changed things a bit though, baked them in a bundt muffin tin. The recipe made 12 indiviual bundts plus an 8" round with the leftover batter. I used double processed dutch cocoa and only used 1 cup instead of 1.5 because it is so rich. Didn't have chocolate chips so I chopped up 2 squares of bittersweet bakers chocolate. I also subsituted 2 sticks of butter for the oil, however, that's probably why the bottoms of these were really sticky. Other than that they were fantastic and a huge hit. I used my own cinnamon whipped cream on top instead of the frosting. It was perfect!

Outstanding - a chocolate lover's dream. I made these in the panettone cups - although mine were slightly larger than the recommended size, so a few extra (8-10) minutes in the oven and they were perfect. The frosting is wonderful - perfect texture - I will never use canned frosting again! These cupcakes freeze very well and are a delight to take one out at a time for a treat anytime. My 4 year old loves them!

I also needed to bake an additional 5 minutes. I made the cupcakes in regular muffin tins and they were delicious. I went light on the frosting and even omitted the frosting from the last few cupcakes. They're terrific both with and without the frosting.

These turned out great! Super rich and moist. I cooked them in regular cupcake papers in a muffin tin. I found they needed to bake and extra 5 minutes. The almond frosting was good too. I don't like my deserts super sweet so I just added the sugar 1 cup at a time and tasted the frosting after each addition until it was a sweetness level I liked.

I had a terrible time with this recipe and the Orange Cardamom Cupcakes. I used regular muffin papers, but five minutes longer would not have helped. The cupcakes simply did not want to cook.
