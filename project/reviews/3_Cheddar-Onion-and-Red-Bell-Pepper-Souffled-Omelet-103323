Well, I guess it turned out as it was supposed to, because it looked just like the picture in the recipe... However, I wasn't really that impressed. I had 7 farm-fresh egg whites left over from something else I had made a few days ago, and, not wanting to waste them, I turned to Epicurious and found this recipe. Having been egg whites from pastured hens, they puffed up brilliantly, but deflated a bit after they came out of the oven. The other reviews convinced me that it would be lacking in flavor, so I used some of the flavors from my favorite corn maque choux recipe (oregano, basil, marjoram, thyme, sage -- along with a few dashes of Tabasco sauce), which made the flavor quite lovely. All in all, I guess it turned out okay -- the bf went back for seconds -- but I just wasn't fond of the texture. Maybe I should save my souffle-tasing for desserts...

I followed the recipe as is and was disappointed in the results - way too bland. Also, this was my first attempt at a souffle, and found it rather watery after baking. Is this the way souffles are supposed to finish, or did I do something wrong? I also thought it was a bit too meringue-y; my husband said it felt like he was eating air. There are way too many great recipes on this website to repeat this one, in my opinion.

Delicious! I made quite a few substitutions/ additions that gave this more of a southwestern flavor. I added mushrooms and jalapenos, used pepper jack instead of cheddar, cilantro instead of parsley, and served it with homemade chipotle salsa. I also added 4 divided eggs and more butter, so maybe more fat made it taste better. The corn meal adds great flavor and texture over a traditional souffle. I'll be making this again soon.

Easy and perfect for those pesky vegetarian dinnerguests. Served with a baguette and simple arugula salad with a garlic tarragon vinaigrette. Will try different variations.

This is a souffle, not an omelet. Pretty good, not great.

A small addition to my previous comment: The original recipe calls for two egg yolks and 7 egg whites. I wanted to make half the recipe, but one egg yolk didn't seem like enough and measuring half an egg white seemed like more bother than it was worth. So, I used 2 egg yolks, 4 egg whites, and half of all the the other ingredients. Those proportions worked out well.

This is a solid recipe with great texture, but lacked a little flavor. I would opt for adding some chili peppers, which would go well with the sweet cornmeal flavor. I'd also add a bit more onion. On the up side, you'd never know that this is so low fat! Even my boyfriend ate it, and he's philisophically opposed to reduced fat cheese. Definitely a recipe worth tinkering with.

Fantastic meal for nights when you are in a hurry - the time on the recipe is wrong, preparation takes about fifteen minutes. I use roasted red peppers frozen from last summer, and usually add more onions than called for. I make a half portion, which serves two with some leftovers. Add a salad and presto!

Does it really take 2 3/4 hr to prepare, or is this a typo?

This was a delightful lunch dish. The corn meal gives it a nice texture. I don't like bell peppers, so I omitted them the first time I made it and also added a little bit of crumbled bacon. The basic recipe inspires creativity -- next time I will add some green chiles for a chile relleno flavor.
