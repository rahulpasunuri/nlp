Can't beat a good tostone! It's often a staple of a Puerto Rican meal. I prefer it with a quick saute "sauce" of fresh garlic, olive oil & salt...yum!

Tostones are part of almost every Cuban meal although this recipe has given it a little pizzaz with the Sauce Chien. Very tasty addition to this already good side dish. Also, if you have kept your plantain for too long & it has ripened (even if rotten peel) you can still use it. Peel the ripened plantain & cut at an angle about 1 1/2 inches thick & fry in hot oil till golden & browned in some areas. This is "Platano Maduro", a sweet version of Tostones & much softer, most preferred taste of the plantain.
