used about 1/2 tsp ground fennel seeds instead of cloves. this made the recipe exceptional in my opinion.

I also used smoked paprika, and instead of 3/4 teaspoon of salt, used just 1/4, and added 1 teaspoon of smoked chipotle red chile powder -- cooked just 10 minutes -- and indeed as they cooled they crunched up nicely. But they're still a little bland, for my taste, although there's a very nice aftertaste from the smoke. However, guests remarked on them (positively) as part of a salad with pears and blue cheese, and as an appetizer. Next time, if I'm doing them for myself, I'll add twice as much chile!

What I like about this recipe is that is lacks the cloying sweetness of many recipes of this type. Mine were more savory as I used smoked Spanish paprika. Makes all the difference.

The problem with this recipe isn't the nuts, but the name. The nuts are tasty, but they are not noticably sweet nor spicy. (I did add a bit of cayenne pepper, and you could increase the other spices as well.) I made them for Thanksgiving tomorrow instead of some of the more highly rated recipes because I didn't want anything candy-coated, greasy or overly spicy before dinner. These are nicely crisp but the other reviewers are right about the baking time. I started checking mine at 10 minutes and took them out at around 14 or 15 minutes.

Wouldn't this recipe be from the last issue of Gourmet magazine? There was a big fanfare recently that the magazine was folding.

I made this as I needed something quick and tasty to take to an afterwork cocktail party. I should have left the nuts alone! Not any discernible flavor, and as other reviewers have pointed out, 20 minutes would have found them burned to a cinder.

This recipe made it to the big yellow Gourmet cookbook. I think there are better recipes out there. In fact they make a spicy version that is better and it goes better with cocktails if that is your plan. This one lacks pizzazz or oomph or something.

These were fine, but my guests enjoyed them. I like spicier versions, so kick it up according your guests tastes. Also, about the cookie sheet question, they are referring you a baker's half sheet pan, if you don't own one get a couple, it's a must have. I like Nordic Ware's natural and nonstick versions.

I subsituted 2 tablespoon Splenda instead of the sugar and was very pleased with the results. Next time I will try with a little cayenne pepper to spice it up more.

The spicy pecan recipe is much better. These are bland, even with the addition of cayenne pepper & black pepper. And they were almost burned at 15 minutes.

Really good flavor and very crunchy. Watch bake time carefully, because mine were done in about 17 minutes. They won't appear crisp until they rest for awhile, so don't overbake. To the previous reviewer, most cookie sheets have four raised edges.

What is a four sided sheet pan that this recipe calls for ?

Prepared to recipe, except I substituted ground red New Mexico chili for the paprika. Very good flavor, no fat.
