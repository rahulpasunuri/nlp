Hey, the first reviewer! Too bad, because this was an easy crowd-pleaser. I made it for a big family gathering, and it was a hit. Made it pretty much to the letter, except did one cup of parsley and one of basil, because I had lots. Also, I peeled and cut up potatoes first, because I hate doing that to cooked ones. Get good quality vinegar! BTW, I used half store-bought potatoes, and half from a farmer's market, and the farm ones were so much better.
