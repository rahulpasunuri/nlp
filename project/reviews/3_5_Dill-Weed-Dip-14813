Great recipe, and you can modify it many different ways and it still comes out great. One variation my friends enjoy is to eliminate or reduce the dill and add various hot sauces.

Modified this a bit due to not having required ingredients but it was a big hit at the Memorial Day bbq even with the kids. Didn't have beau appetit, so i used fresh garlic instead. Fresh onion instead of dry, used fresh dill and light sour cream/mayo to cut calories. Definitly would make this again.

This recipe is great with 1/2-1 cup of salad shrimp mixed in. You haven't tried this, you are missing out.

OK, I have come across so many fantastic recipes on epicurious. However, this is the first that I have finally found the motivation to comment on. I made this for a Christmas party to have with the garlic roasted potato skins, also on this site. It was good. Didn't go over really well. And my husband didn't care for it. He hates mayonaise and sour cream, so what did I expect? However, a few days later, trying to finish up leftovers still from the party, I pulled out good old Great Value wheat crackers (generic for Wheat Thins) and started dipping, and, oh my goodness did we have an addiction going! It was the perfect addictive combination. I used seasoned salt since the "beau" seasonings weren't available in our stores, and threw in a little extra dill when I made it.

I have a rendition of this recipe where you add cucumber, spring onions - half sour cream and half miracle whip, salt and pepper and TONS of dill weed. Great with carrots, celery and radishes. My mom taught me how to make it. A squirt of fresh lemon juice and maybe a dash of garlic with be nice additions too. Try it and let me know.

As a dill-lover, I like the idea of this dip, but with a few variations...I like fresh chopped dill, but the dried does work well if you let the dip chill for several hours to let the flavors blend. I also add fresh lemon juice and zest because I think it brightens the flavor. I've tried it with chopped scallions too. Deelish. It's great with pita chips!

I make this dip with sour cream, mayo (miracle whip) dill weed and CUCUMBER. It's a fabulous dip for veggies. A must try. Also add spring onion and salt and pepper to taste. But its paramount to use LOTs and LOTs of Dill Weed!!!!!

Wonderful and oh-so easy! Tastes so much better than store-bought stuff. This will most definitely become the only dip I make for parties and picnics. A little more dill won't hurt, so I suggest heaping it on!

I first made this dip in college, too many years ago, and have loved it ever since. Now, with spreading waistline, I use yogurt or non-fat sour cream instead of sour cream and low-fat (NOT non-fat) mayo. It's just as good this way!

Very easy to make and certainly a delicious dip, especially when compared to those store-bought kinds.

Always a favorite at gatherings. I took this over for a Thanksgiving dinner get-together, and it was a hit. A few mentioned that it had been years since they had dill dip. It quickly disappeared, proving that it can hold the "oldie,b ut goodie" status. (Can easily be doubled).

I had this recipe a long time ago and lost it. It is especially good served in a bread bowl like pumpernickel.

I have been making this recipe for years. So when I saw it I had to see if it was the same way I make it. It is however instead of the "beau apetit" (????)I use Lawrys seasoning salt. And make sure it chills first!!!! A great dip for veggies!!

This is a great recipe. I am always asked to bring this when attending a party. I also serve this in a bread bowl but I also add chopped up chipped beef to it. Its excellent!

Since I had no idea where to locate the "beau monde" seasoning and did not want to use dried onions, here's what I did instead: Purchase onion dip (dairy case) add: mayonnaise, sour cream and lots of yogurt (for zip) to almost double the quantity from the purchased dip. Mix in chopped fresh dill. Same idea, but do-able. Disappointingly, my guests seemed to go for this (to me, somewhat ordinary) dip with crudites more than my real homemade snazzy Maytag blue cheese dip.

Delicious dip with fresh vegetables. Lowfat cottage cheese may be sub. for the sour cream and Miracle Whip for the mayo. Mix in blender. Chill overnight for best flavor.

I have made this recipe many times for home and parties. The best way I have used it is to hollow out a loaf of fresh rye bread and put the dip in. Then cut up cubes from the inside of the bread and use them for dipping. when that runs out you the cut up the bread that was holding the dip. It's addicting!
