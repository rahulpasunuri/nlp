This was a pretty good way to use ground turkey. My husband was rather surprised--he didn't like the sound of the recipe. I didn't have any cornbread stuffing mix, so I substituted a 3-to-1 cornmeal-flour mix with extra sage, black pepper, and parsley.

Very homey dish. Easy and better than any old pan burger. The sauce was a little salty for me. Agree with thickening with corn starch slurry.

It was pretty tasty for ground turkey and also very quick and easy to make. I would agree with other reviewers that the gravy is just broth and will try to thicken it next time.

This is a very good recipe for ground turkey. I doubled it, added chopped celery, shallot, cayenne and garlic powder. For the sauce I added some apricot jam while it was reducing, making it more of a glaze that I spooned over the patties. Served it with sour cream mashed yukons and buttered peas.

This was delicious-I used leftover porcini soaking liquid from another meal and only a little chicken broth and had no trouble getting it to reduce to a very intense sauce. I also seared the patties at first, then returned them to the reducing sauce to finish cooking. Didnt have fresh tarragon so used 1/2 amt of dried. Served with jasmine rice and carmelized pearl onions. Yum!!

This was quick and easy. However, the "gravy" is more of a broth. Next time I make it, I will use a little more mustard and thicken the sauce with some cornstarch.

It was okay. I made it with lean ground chicken and, taking a tip from a previous reviewer, splashed some sherry into the gravy. The gravy was rather non-descript, I must say. Thickened it with a cornstarch slurry. Served with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. Awfully darn suburban! :o)

This is really a great weeknight, quick and decent recipe. My hubby even liked it and he swears he doesn't like ground turkey. Make it with mashed red garlic potatoes and broccoli. Kids ate it and liked it too.

I'd make it again...but I made some changes because it sounded sort of blah. First, I doubled recipe so it would serve 4, and I added 3 cloves garlic (minced), 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper and about 3 tbl. marsala wine to patties. The gravy was much too thin, so added a cornstarch slurry and pepped it up with a few tablespoons of dry sherry.
