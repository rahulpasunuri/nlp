(It gets 4 forks with the following changes...)I tweaked this one alot. I served it with "Beef Braised in Red Wine" and the gravy, which has small veggies in it was very complimentary. Here are the changes I made: I left out the rutabegas. 4 med sized parsnips 4 or 5 med potatoes 4 cloves minced garlic I cut the parsnips smaller than the potatoes and boiled all in chicken broth just to cover, until tender and most of the liquid was gone. I mashed them right in the remaining liquid (drain some if necessary.) Then: placed spoonfuls on greased baking sheet. drizzeld with olive oil and baked in cook stove at 350 until browned. Delicious. great for company...can be made ahead and baked just before serving. I also froze some of the individual Potatoe Puffs

This recipe was very good - to be clear I used orange turnip (not small white/purple ones) - there's a difference between what Canadians call turnip/rutagaga! There was lots leftover so I added 3 egg yolks and some butter and using a pastry bag, piped the mixture into domes on a a cookie sheet, brushed with butter and baked for 20 minutes at 375. Actually - this was even better!

Great combination of flavours and colours. Served with roast pork with rosemary, mustard and honey and it was delicious with the gravy.
