The pear was a great addition to the turkey meat, which is usually quite dry. But somehow, the way I cooked it made the turkey much more palatable! I didn't have "non-all-breast meat", but it turned out great anyway!

This is a fabulous recipe. I substituted an apple as we didn't have any pears. It turned out perfectly. The apples and fresh herbs smell so tasty when they are cooking. I will definitely make these again.

I made it as written, except sqeezed the grated pear before adding. Afraid it would have been a soggy mess otherwise. They are delicious but I will do half grated pear and half grated onion next time for more flavor.

Amazing. I LOVE this recipe. We are big fans of sausage but trying to eat healthy at the same time. This hits the spot. I didn't have a pear, so I used a whole apple, full lb of ground meat, and added a finely chopped leek (because I needed to use it). It was Very moist. This made an excellent savory version, but I'll absolutely come back to this many times for breakfast sausage as well.

I love this recipe and make it on a regular basis! I usually freeze most of the patties and then take them out one at a time for weekday breakfasts. So good!

Very good! Per other reviews, I added grated onion for a more savory flavor. My patties were rather hash-like, because I used the larger holes of my grater, producing longer strands of the pear and onion. I wasn't sure my bf would like it, but he actually loved the texture!! And I ended up liking it as well!

Generally speaking, I'm not a huge sausage fan, but I gave this recipe a rating of 3 forks, as I took the advice of one reviewer and added some shallots. If you have to tweak a recipe, I don't think it deserves 4 forks. My time saving tip is that I made these in my food processor, chopping the sage, shallots & parsley first, then pulsing the added coarsely chopped pear (I used a D'Anjou, I think any firm pear would suffice)turkey and spices. I couldn't really taste the pear, but I suspect it gave the sausages the nice texture. I would make these again, as my husband prefers sausage to bacon. Enjoy this healthy alternative to traditional fatty sausages that have who knows what in them!

This recipe was pretty good; the sausages dissapeared quickly! I will make it again, but next time, I will add a savory element, like some onion or shallot to offset the sweetnees of the pear.

Very good. Needed more sage. My husband wondered what happend to the pear he saw me grating earlier that morning. More spice is nice and just can't wait to try it again.

Very good and my DH even liked them! I thought they were a little soupy when I was forming them so next time will pat the pear to dry it after it's been grated. I didn't have fresh sage so used ground sage. I also added red pepper flakes to give it a little spice. I will definitely make these again!

I found the patty mixture to be really wet and challenging to shape. Next time I would drain the pears in a colander or squeeze in paper towels. The flavor was very nice and they were not at all dry.

Excellent. Might add a little more pepper next time.

Ok--it's not fair of me to rate this 3 instead of 4 because I didn't follow the directions exactly. I'll try again and if it's better next time, I'll edit this review. This was actually pretty good. I didn't have a pear so I substituted with 1/2 a persimmon and 1/2 an Aurora apple (b/c it was especially sweet). I really liked the way that tasted in the meat. It needed a little more kick. Next time I might throw in some more pepper or use red pepper flakes.

The patties were well flavored and moist! I even cut up the leftover patties and threw these pieces into my omelette with sauteed mushrooms, chard and red peppers from our dinner - even better!

Substitute apples for pears and 1 tsp dry sage for the fresh sage and it is still delicious.

Of course I tweaked this recipe a bit! Left off the pears and allspice and subbed in some red pepper flakes--plus I bought the turkey that WAS all breast. YUM. Such a delicious breakfast sausage, kept well.

I made this for a holiday brunch, in addition to Maple and Black Pepper Bacon. Both were delicious. I'm not a huge sage and parsley flavor fan, so I cut back to one leaf of fresh sage and 2 T parsley per 1 1/4 lb turkey. Some guests ate seconds and thirds of this.

Incredibly moist and flavorful sausages. I omitted the sage since the supermarket was all out, but these were amazing regardless. I cooked these ahead of time and reheated for a brunch, and they didn't suffer at all for it. I can't wait to make them again!

Excellent! Everyone loved these patties. Very moist and well seasoned. Really "makes" a Sunday brunch!

Yummy, healthful breakfast sausage. I subbed apples for pears. Very easy to make, very fresh tasting!

Excellent! I used dried sage and parsely and eliminated the pear (didn't have any on hand, egg, and salt and they came out delish.

I was looking for turkey sausage spices for Phase I, South Beach and happened upon this. Can't use the fruit, but I put in 1/4 c.fine chopped onion, generous amt of fresh sage,hot pepper flakes and 1 tsp. fennel seeds,2T. ground pecans. You have to use 1# all white meat ground turkey for it to be legal for Phase I. Salt/pepper to taste. And a little allspice. I was pretty pleased with it.It beats the boring recipe in the SB cookbook yet it fulfills the requirements for Phase I. I like fennel so I will add more.Hope this helps my fellow South Beach dieters.

I cooked the patties on the george foreman grill. They were good except for the sage. Next time, I will leave out the sage. I'm not a huge sage fan and the taste in the patties was a bit too much.

Question: Is it best to freeze before or after you fry the patties?

Wow - I am not usually the chef of the house, but I needed to make something that was relatively quick and easy and South Beach Diet-friendly (phase II) and this perfectly fit the bill. These are fabulous! Light and tasty they would be just as good for breakfast with eggs, lunch with salad or dinner with mashed sweet potatoes. I also used the 7% fat ground turkey. So easy even a non-chef can make them.

I am a health nut, so I first tried these first with all breast meat (99% fat free). The recipe is right -- it doesn't taste that good. Then I used the 7% fat ground turkey, this one had a combination of light and dark meat, and the sausage patties came out perfect! While they do have a little more fat, they are so worth the flavor.

My husband and I are really into healthy cooking and eating and this recipe fit the bill. The sausage has a nice balance of flavor and moisture. We make large batches and just freeze it to use as we need it. I've even substituted an apple for the pear and it tasted great.
