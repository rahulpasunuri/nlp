Tasty and easy! The sliced ribs and stems were a nice addition in terms of texture and color. Like some previous reviewers, I used chicken broth instead of water. I also added a little crushed red pepper with the garlic and a splash of balsamic vinegar just before serving (I like a bit of acid in my greens, and think apple cider vinegar would work well too). Delicious, beautiful, easy and healthy dish -- what more could you ask for?

This was good but not as wonderful as I was expecting based on other reviews. I did add some nutmeg, which I thought helped. However, it was super easy and perfect for a weeknight dinner.

Very basic "how do I cook swiss chard?" recipe. I liked using the thinly sliced stems and ribs as many recipes say to discard them. I used chicken stock instead of water and also less oil than the recipe suggests.

This has become a staple since I first made it a few months ago. Healthy, delicious and a great alternative to spinach.

Made this with 1/4 the recipe. Very good side dish.

I had never before eaten, let alone made, Swiss chard. Tonite I made 1/4 of the original recipe for my husband and myself. Did sub low sodium chicken broth for the water. It was DELICIOUS, but I hated to pitch the cooking liquid (and some nutrition??), so next time I would add less liquid. It didn't need any added salt. Good accompaniment to "Italian Sausage with Red Grapes", also on this site.

To massy_vk from Wisconsin, You can reduce bitterness by blanching most greens in boiling water for 2-3 mins, or you can try any of the following: start the saute with some finely diced bacon/pancetta/linguica, or start it with some carmelized grape tomatoes or shallots to impart the developed sugars, or simply add a little sugar or honey to taste as you cook the greens.

Wonderful! Beautiful, simple, and beyond tasty. How do you keep sauteed greens from getting bitter?

I have been searching for recipes that will be rich in calcium - and this one is great. I did not use the ribs, but next time I may try that.

I never ate swiss chard before, and this was a great recipe for me to try. I made only 1 bunch of red chard and I didn't add water in the end, because I didn't want the greens to be too soft. I mixed the red chard with steamed spinach. The two cloves of garlic and salt and pepper were the only seasoning needed!

Yum! I'd never eaten Swiss Chard before making this dish, but I'll be eating it a lot from now on! This is a beautiful and delicious dish. The recipe also works well with kale, and I'm sure other greens too.

I used a bit less oil and instead of water, poultry stock that had been reduced to the point that it was slightly viscous. The resulting dish was quite flavorful, and the chard has a nice affinity for the gentle meaty flavor of chicken. I tossed the result with a pound of pasta, which was a nice way to serve it.

I will definetly make this again. It had a very delicate flavor and was served with a Shrimp pasta dish. I reduced the olive oil by half and added a 3rd clove of garlic. It was great.

This side dish was very well received at Thanksgiving. It was flavorful, but not too rich---a great compliment to the turkey.
