This tart is amazing, simple and elegent. The only changes I made were two whole eggs insaid of 3 egg yolks, and I added a pinch of garlic powder. Very easy to make, beautiful when it is done. Served with steamed asparagus, which paired perfectly. Leftovers are good cold, at room temperature, or warm.

A great base recipe. I made the following changes: I left out the butter (all of it!) and flour; I used 1 tbs olive oil in which I sauteed some onion, garlic, and spinach; and I added some chopped tomato to the cheese mix. I used a puff pastry because that's what I had. It was delicious! With the addition of spinach and leaving out the butter it felt like a fairly healthy vegetarian dinner. I will be making this again and again - lots of potential for variation!

I gave it 3 forks for "delicious." While the dish didn't "wow" me, I would certainly make it again and pair it with a salad and wine suggestion. I used a purchased crust which I pre-baked per the recipe. I made the filling in advance with the herbs and after several hours in the fridge, the flavors melded beautifully. I didn't find it too greasy or fatty as some reviewers did, but when I tasted it cold the next day, I could taste sense the butter. Microwaving cured that. Therefore, I would probably use 1/2 the butter next time.

This is a great recipe. I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, two whole eggs in place of yolks, and just 2 tbs. butter. I added sauteed shallots and garlic. I also used just 4 oz. of chevre because it was all I had on hand, and it was really flavorful and good.

I made this for an app. on Christmas Eve and they were very good. I did not make the pastry dough as I was short on time, so I used mini tart shells to make individual servings. There was enough filling to make 36 mini tarts. I will be sure to make the pastry dough next time because I can imagine that they would be even better.

This tart is wonderful! Absolutely great with a salad, green vegetable, and crusty bread. Totally cheated and used frozen pie crust and light cottage cheese. I think I may make this for brunch the next time my in-laws are in-town.

Nice and rich! I used a mix of dried herbs (a few rough teaspoons full of thyme, basil, oregano, garlic powder, etc) and it turned out well.

I made this for a special picnic attended by very good cooks. They all loved it and wanted recipe. I held back on herbs a little and will increase them next time.

Soooooo yummy!The flavors were well balanced, it was rich but not heavy, and a perfect third course in a 7 course meal. This would also be great served with salad in larger portions for a scrumptious vegetarian meal. I used a tart dough recipe from the 'Desserts by Pierre Herme' cookbook. Perfect.

I have made this several times and my guests love it! I add fresh tomatoes on top which is a great flavor addition.

So easy, so good! Next time I will AGAIN :: make ahead and reheat (better warm) :: skip tart shell :: use inexpensive goat cheese from Sam's :: use 1% cottage cheese :: drop butter to 4T from 8T :: use zest of 1/2 lemon vs whole as zest overpowered rosemary. TART #4, as above except 2T butter is plenty :: 1/2c Egg Beaters replaced yolks just fine :: used 1T rosemary + 3T chive, very good :: added chopped roasted red pepper spinach for color/nutrition. A new BASIC recipe in my collection: begs for adaptation and creativity. Have fun w this!

I am certainly in the minority concerning this recipe. I always go to epicurious for recipes and ratings. This is the first disappointment. I thought this recipe totally bland.

This tart was definitely incredible. It has a rich flavor (although slightly more healthful than recipes using cream, don't be fooled by the goat cheese: when I baked it, oil oozed out). It was easily reheated in the oven the next day and was even good in the microwave. I might try to find a better way of incorporating the herbs, as their flavor did not stand out much. Otherwise, delicious, with a slightly tart/sour flavor.

A terrific tart, especially served a little on the warm side. I have made it many times, and it is always appreciated.

I can't even remember how many times I've made this - lots! I've used it for an appetizer, light lunch or brunch. People often request that I bring it for parties, and I've also brought it along on several camping trips. You can vary the herbs and use anything that is fresh, but I agree with several other reviewers who said that lavendar is wonderful with it if you have it (luckily I grow it so I always do) and if you have herb flowers, toss those on last to make it really pretty. One variation I sometimes do, that I haven't seen in other reviews, is to add a bit of finely grated lemon zest. It doesn't end up tasting lemony, just a little lighter and (hmmm - I didn't intend a pun, just can't think of a better word) zestier. PS I usually do use a good quality ready made crust for this one.

Have made this twice and guests loved it. Added tomatoes to the top. Used thyme and rosemary. Also, used frozen pie dough and rolled it out for a 9x13 pan. Wonderful!

FANTASTIC! I was skeptical at first ... cottage cheese???? But the results were outstanding. The tart was golden in hue, light in texture and had that fabulous tangy bite of the goat cheese, but, thanks to the cottage cheese, wasn't overwhelming. A beautiful wedge of this with a small side portion of salad makes a stunning first course. Add bread and fruit, and it's a beautiful lunch.

Great! I was having company and in a hurry so I skipped the crust and hoped! I buttered a pie plate and poured in the cheese mixture with all the herbs blended in. It firmed nicely and I took it out of the oven when it turned golden brown. It was firm and I could easily cut pie shaped wedges. I served it with a mango/red onion/red pepper salad which I also got from this site. Beautiful to look at and wonderful food companions.

I guess I'm in the minority here, but I thought this was too rich. I think it might be better with some fresh sliced tomato or something to cut the rich-ness.

The fresher the herbs, the better the tart. Made this in the summer with a variety of fresh picked herbs from my garden (increased the amount a bit). To reviewer Jacqueline from El Paso, if you bake this at 375 degrees, I find there is no need to prebake the pastry shell. It will still take about 20 minutes. (I sometimes drink wine while I cook too so I know what you mean.)

very easy to make especially if you use a ready-made pie crust. I take the crust out of the tin pan and put it in a glass deep dish pie pan. I added a handfull of fresh spinach leaves without stems, fresh basil and green onions to the food processor towards the end of the cheese mixture and cut down on the butter to 1/4 cup as suggested by other reviews. Great tasting!

This tart was easy and delicious. My husband loved it and we've had it many times. (I shorten the preparation time by using ready made pastry.)

I too found that the filling was too greasy. That can be easily remedied. I used the suggested herbs + a large amount of black pepper. Served it with a salad made of belgian endive, radicchio, and spinach leaves, dressed with raspberry vinegar and olive oil. Perfect! (and pretty too on my dark blue plates...)

Wow! What a great flavor, with lavender from my garden. The filling seemed very thick, though, so I didn't bother baking the crust first (it did not pour, for instance!), which turned out just fine. And the fruit chutney was a GREAT idea. Lovely!

Made this as an appetizer for a large group and they loved it w/several requests for the recipe. I found it a bit bland though...needed some color & spice. Great crust however...

This is a very tasty and easy dish, however the amount of butter the recipe calls for (1/2 cup) is too much. I would cut the butter down to 1/4 cup and make up the difference with cottage cheese.

The herbed goat cheese tart was a wonderful addition to our Provencal dinner party and wine tasting. I used fresh rosemary, thyme and lavender from my garden- everyone loved it! It was the easiest and most appreciated dish on the menu. I'll definitely make it again.

I'm making this again for company this weekend. One change--I'm serving it with a fruit chutney. Last time I served this, everyone agreed that a tart chutney would be a wonderful addition as well as giving color to the dish. Wonderful!

Fabulous flavor! I used fresh tarragon, thyme, & sage and it was great. The crust was very easy to work with as well. The next time I will not bake it quite so long, I didn't need that extra 5-6 minutes after all. The tart made an excellent presentation with the fresh herbs baked into the top of the filling!

I made it for my customers in my cafe, and every single one said it was the best thing they had eaten in a long time - all the way down to the crust. Considering I have little time/money to waste on trying out recipes, I am very happy to say it helped my turnover and reputation. I will certainly consider making it a regular feature!

Amazing how such an easy recipe can be absolutely delicious. I forgot to prebake the crust (result of a glass of wine with my cooking??) so I covered the filling with foil and baked an extra 10 minutes. The result was perfect!!

I have made this recipe so many times in the last few years that I can't even count. It is always a huge hit and I have given it out to several people. This is one of those recipes I am sure to pass on to my grandchildren. If you love goat cheese - this is light, luscious AND easy!!!

Superb! I made the "from scratch" Pastry Dough as specified in the recipe (it's a snap in the Cuisinart) and also used the 3-some fresh herb combination called for which is a dynamite flavor blend. I would definitely recommend this--it's easy yet very impressive to serve your guests.

This tart was quite good - even though filled with very fattening things, it tasted light and fresh - perfect for a hot August night!

This was fabulous! I made it without a crust and used french bagettes to scoop it up. Lavender has such a unique floral flavor. I served this with a Pinot Blanc from Alsace and the Cream of Zucchini and Anise Soup in the May 1999 Bon Appetite. Great dish for brunch lunch dinner or a lazy summer afternoon. My 8 year old even liked it. Enjoy!!!!!

I made it with a premade pie crust in a glass pie pan and it was very delicious. I think it would be a good brunch dish as well.

Easy to make, and a wonderful flavor. Serve it warm v. room temperature if possible. Pairs great with a Sancerre or a Chablis. Also, put lavender in it if you can find any.
