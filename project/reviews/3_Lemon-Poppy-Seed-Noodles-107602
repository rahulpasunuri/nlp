I came across this recipe when I was looking for something different than the usual rice or potato side dish and I am SO happy I did! This was a simple, flavorful and delicious side dish that goes with just about any main dish. Last week, I made it with grilled chicken. Before that, I made it with pan seared steak and tonight, I'm making it with Chicken with White Wine and Garlic from this site. Can't wait to eat!

This is a good choice when you would otherwise serve naked noodles (i.e., with a sauced dish), but is too bland to stand alone. I served it with stuffed cabbage, and the fresh flavors made a good offset to the heavier main dish. I would increase the proportion of everything to noodles, or the flavors will get lost.

I've made this several times and it always gives a delicious,light, fresh flavor to a sometomes boring side dish. Great with pork or roasts. I use twice as many noodles as called for but make the rest (amount) as directed.

Loved it! So simple, but a flavorful and interesting side dish. Next time I might add some pine nuts too.

Yep, it's darned good. I made the full recipe for three of us and we ate it all. No way will this serve six! Next time I make this I will cut down on the butter.

Delish, a 3+. My whole family loved it, especially my son who loves lemon poppy seed muffins! Great with so many things! Will make it again.

To make this into a main dish, I added some chicken. Definitely delicious.

Simple, light, delicious. We had this with grilled chicken, and it was great as leftovers. I gave this three forks because I feel that a four-fork rating ("a dish beyond compare") should be saved for very special recipes. (So far, I've given one four-forker - for Shrimp with feta, cilantro, and lime.)

Fast, simple, and good. Made this only because I had all the ingredients on hand, and needed a quick accompaniment for the time-consuming Turkey Meatloaf in the same issue. Glad I did. We all liked it a lot.

Had to give it four forks for quick, low fat and very yummy. The contrast of poppyseeds and pasta was amazing. I'll add more chives next time. Yum!

This was a great little dish to go with anything. It just melts in your mouth.
