fantastic! I am using these to top a dark chocolate stout cake and they work wonderfully. I plan on making them again to chop up for a salad sometime. They are my husband's dream come true.

I used the thick cut...it was what I had on hand. It was o.k. they never go crisp. Will try it again with regular bacon. The flavor was very good.

Remarkable. My father, a bacon maniac, was horrified when I first suggested trying this ("Why would you want to do that to perfectly good bacon?!") but by the time we took it out of the oven on Christmas morning, everyone in the family was crowded around the stove trying to snitch bites. Let it cool before serving, it definitely gets better and crispier. Couldn't be easier!

This is an old bed and breakfast favorite. I enjoyed getting the idea of adding cayenne from these reviews. I've also added cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. Since this bacon crisps as it cools, it looks pretty if you twist the bacon as you lay it out.

This bacon is fabulous. I crumbled some on top of potato gnoochi and braised short ribs... it was to die for.

Great. Added it to mashed turnip - the sweet and bitter went well together.

Loved it, great for a brunch or morning coffee get together. I made it the day before and then reheated in oven

Absolutely incredible! I'm always looking for new and unique brunch ideas and this was a HUGE hit. Added a little bit of cayenne to half the batch for a little zing and was great! Also, I made it one day ahead and then reheated it in foil in the oven. Bacon stuck together a little bit but not too much. Was worth being able to make ahead. This is a keeper!

Very easy, and decadently yummy. A great surprising addition to a brunch...nice for Mom's Day maybe with a veggie fritata?

The most delicious way I have ever eaten bacon. Can also wrap around raw scallops and serve as a great appetizer. Bravo on a great dish!

I almost gave this recipe its first bad review, but I couldn't bear to type it out after re-reading all the raves! So I made it again and liked it much better. Make sure to COAT that bacon with brown sugar...the first time I was much more gentle and the taste was too subtle. And make sure it's really crisp. My oven may run cold, but 8 minutes a side was not enough. The second time I cooked the bacon at 375 for 10 minutes a side and next time I'll go a smidge longer. My second batch was delightfully addictive, but my first batch just seemed like I was serving cold, oddly sweet bacon.

I made this for a Father's Day brunch. Decadent and delicious! My husband called it "bacon candy" - a fitting description.

Addicting and easy to prepare ahead. A good choice for Easter Brunch or Mother's Day!

This was so tasty! The sweet/savory combination really hit the spot. I served this with an overnight blueberry french toast for Christmas morning breakfast, and they went together very well. The leftovers were great, too -- so much so that I think I'll make it a day early next time.

I didn't think this sounded very good, but after reading other reviews I had to try it. It's absolutely the best! And next time I will try it with a bit of cayenne as previously suggested.

I love this recipe. The only change that I make to it is to add either a small amount of chili powder or cayenne pepper to the sugar. Adds just a hint of heat and makes the flavor more complex.

My husband claims this is the best bacon he has ever had. He is a real meat lover, and eats it more often than he should,so coming from him it was fabulous!!!!

I can't describe how much everybody likes this. I was surprised how crunchy and good this is. I changed 1 thing and it made it so much easier! MICROWAVE!!! Put your slices on your bacon cooker and nuke for 1 minute per slice. Watch carefully as they can burn before you know it. (Although we fought over the burnt ones as well!)Make this with french toast it's wonderful!

I love this! A new twist to an old favorite. As if bacon was not tempting enough already. This is a definite brunch crowd pleaser, and the beauty of it is that it need not be served "right off the griddle". Since it becomes crispier as it cools, it is even better at room temp.
