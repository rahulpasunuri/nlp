Creme fraiche topping adds an additionally sour note--the lime juice is enough, thank you--to an otherwise solid recipe. Go with whipped cream; you'll be happier.

It may say "variation", but it should never be called a Key Lime Pie. Having lived in the Florida Keys and Key West, I know that Key Limes are smaller, brighter and much tarter than regular limes. This is quite simply a lime pie, NOT a Key Lime Pie, don't make this if you want the real thing!

Heavy and strangely insipid tasting w/o the crème fraîche to add a little "something." Crust was good but very close to my usual recipe so didn't learn anything there. Glad I tested this one out - I couldn't in good conscience ask a client to pay for it!

I made this for Thanksgiving. It's really a creamy, unbaked cheesecake. I used a graham cracker crust, because I don't like pie crust, and I used about 1/2 cup powdered sugar in the creme fraiche topping since it seemed a little tart. I loved this pie. Besides being rich, creamy and delicious, it was incredibly easy and quick to put together.

Hey folks, as noted at the top of the recipe this is a key lime pie variation, and it's a tasty one at that. A good marriage of cream cheese body and citrusy lime flavor. Like others, I usually make this with a different crust. For full tropical effect and wonderfulness, I like to make it with crushed butter cookies, butter, shredded coconut, and ground macadamias. My plates always come back clean, and so does the pie tin!

Rating: 3
Authentic or not this pie is delicious. But if you're expecting cheesecake, forget it.....this is much too zippy to be cheesecake. I made it with a store bought graham cracker pie crust and I used key limes instead of regular. What a pain in the neck juicing all those tiny limes! Next time I'll use regular limes. Lastly, I couldn't find cream fraiche in the market so I just topped it with whipped cream. Very tasty. My husband had the nerve to ask if I had bought the pie from a bakery!

I made this for Easter, followed some suggestions and did a graham cracker crust in a 9x11 pan. I did juice key limes for this -- a 2 lb bag will make a double batch, and I served with fresh mango. It was great on Easter, but even better leftover! Make this a day or so ahead.

I completely agree with the previous reviewer, it's easy and delicious. Just call it "lime pie" if you're uncomfortable with it's lack of authenticity. I most recently made it with a sugar cookie type crust in a tart pan. We like this variation best.

Well, authentic or not, this was easy and delicious. I made a graham cracker crust and doubled the recipe for a 9 x 13 pan. It was quick to make and great for a party. Everyone loved it.

I made this for a dinner party with a group of friends. Everyone was full from a big dinner, but found enough room for the pie. I followed the recipe, and didn't have any trouble with the pie (was thick enough to slice and eat within 4 hours). I will definitely make it again.

Rating: 4
Oh my goodness! So yummy, and it doesn't require heating up the oven if you use the purchased graham cracker crust which is my preference for this pie anyway. It's easy, it's delicious, and it's a perfect summer dessert. Who cares what you call it...it's just delicious. I used bottled lime juice, and had no problems whatsoever with the filling setting up. Judging from the way my co-workers descended upon this pie, I don't think the flavor suffered from the lack of fresh juice, or from the lack of key limes. Don't leave out the zest or skip the topping or add sugar...it's a winner!

This is absolutely wonderful -- yes in between cheesecake and key lime pie (but far better than this lowly pie.) I usually don't like any thing "gilding the lilly" with cheesecake -- I'm a purist. BUT this is the exception. Truly a tasteful elegant experience -- and the whipped creme fraiche is heavely.

Rating: 4
This is truly an excellent cheesecake with a zesty lime flavor. You don't need key-lime juice -- regular limes -- as the recipe states! It is really not supposed to be Key Lime Pie. We find it deliciously somewhere between Key Lime Pie (with an excellent crust) and a Light and refreshing New York cheesecake. The whipped creme fraiche is wonderful.

Key Lime Pie, Mexican Lime Pie, Floridian Lime Pie, Bimini Lime Pie..... Here's another: Vieques Key Lime Pie. Got the recipe from "Bananas" restaurant on the tiny island of Vieques over 10 years ago and I'm still making it today to rave reviews. The only twist is that we serve it frozen(for the reader who asked how to get the pie to firm up). So I guess this one would actually be called a "Frozen 'Key' Lime Pie" Have a field day!

This is a lovely recipe for a lime pie- too bad it says "Key Lime Pie" instead. This might be a good recipe for someone who's never been to the Keys, but sadly I've lived there and the difference is phenomenal.

We love Key Lime Pie and this recipe was very good. Did you know that key lime juice is available in bottles? Our local Wegman's supermarket stocks it and it's very good. So much easier than dealing with the fresh Key Limes IF you can find them.

Key limes are the biggest fraud ever put over on the American public. They are Mexican limes! The trees were brought over to Florida from Mexico and renamed there. I guess it's so that the growers can charge 5 times as much for them as for Persian limes, couldn't do that if the public realized that they almost grow wild in Mexico. If you live near the border, you can get them for about 50 cents a pound or even less at times. If you have a latin market nearby, see if they're selling Mexican limes. "Key" or Mexican limes are generally smaller, more round and have seeds, if you've never seen one.

Whether you use regular vs. key limes, I found this recipe to be abolutely delicious. Graham cracker crusts purchased pre-made makes the recipe even better and easier.

I like a more traditional key lime pie. This is the time of year, however, to buy real key limes (I live near Chicago and can get them at the larger grocery stores). Once, when having a large group for an open house, key limes were available and I decided to make a pie with both key limes and regular limes and have a taste test (because I too was skeptical). Key limes won hands down. The taste of the lime is better, or at least different, and it has a tarter punch. But not too tart. So now I only make key lime pies when key limes are available.

My dad who LOVES key lime wants me to make this anytime I can. I have made it at least 4/5 times it is the BEST. I Always thought I didn't like Key Lime Pie but this is a terrific recipe and actually tastes better if you leave it 3/4 days so a great dessert to make ahead of time

Just got home from spending a week in Key West. We had key lime pie ATLEAST once a day. Every piece was different, but all good. This didn't come close! Go to Blue Heaven's website for their key lime recipe.....oh sooo good!

Rating: 1
the true key lime pie from key west florida is made from real key limes. but over the years it has been hard to fine or even buy true key limes nationwide so many cooks use the old standbys of lime juice or lemon juice. with this in mind the creation has been altered to the point of masking the real flavors of the key limes. with other ingedients such as cream cheese and floured shells the visions of making a real tartful pie is very rude.

Rating: 4
I used the graham cracker crust from the other key lime pie receipe, perfect. I also used the 1/3 less fat cream cheese for half of the cream cheese and it came out perfect. People have said this was so rich! Would make again!!!

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe several times and always have been impressed with it. I use half key lime juice and half regular fresh lime juice. You absolutely have to use the high-fat ingredients, because the taste is altered if you don't. This is an simple, easy recipe that I have always had success with.

Rating: 1
This was a disappointment -- the cream cheese would not set, and the proportion of lime juice to cheese is too low, the filling tasted too cheesy. It came out with the consistency of a cheesy pudding. I won't make this again. Baked recipes for these are not that much more difficult, and are more successful.

Rating: 1
It never ceases to amaze me how the most basic of recipes are marred by complexity. First, make a graham cracker crust. Buy one if that's easier. Second, unless you want to ruin the pie, don't use the cream cheese and creme fraiche. Combine the condensed milk, 4 egg yolks and 1/2 cup of key lime juice (3/4 cup of juice is going to be quite tart). Bake for 10 minutes at 325.

Rating: 3
I've made this recipe many times and feel that I've finally perfected it! Definitely use the graham cracker crust and don't even think of using light cream cheese because it doesn't seem to set as well. ALSO, I find it makes enough filling for 2 pies -- which is great since we tend to have a lot of good-size barbecues in the summer!

I have been making key lime pie (the Joy of Cooking recipe which is pretty darn good) for years and my husband, kids and I think this pie is stupendous. First of all, in our opinion, don't even think of using anything but a graham cracker crust; it's half the fun! Also, I doubled the lime zest (always do with lemon and lime recipes) and was glad I did. Also, I was afraid all that cream cheese would make it heavy and too rich but it was great. Used pre-packaged creme fraiche and that was delicious too. Awesom addition to the repetoire! Thanks! M. Brandt, Brooklyn, NY

I agree with the other cooks - the pasty can be much better - use a grapham cracker crust definitely! However, the filling was excellent! Very creamy and light! I will definitely make this one again, but with my own crust!

I think the true test of this recipe is whether it tastes like the pie at the Border Grill, not whether key limes are used, and whether it is too cream cheesy. My husband and I agree that it is just like the pie we had there. We never gave a second thought to key lime pie until we had it at the Border Grill, and now we order it everywhere. None taste as good. I think it is very kind of the restaurant to share the recipe so that we can enjoy it at home as well. Thanks, Mary Sue and Susan! Now, about that coconut ice cream... :-) I believe that one of the reasons the Border Grill key lime pie is popular is because it is unique to the genre. My husband likes tart and I like cream cheese, so it is a perfect dessert for us. We both thought it was sweet enough. Like others have suggested, I think a graham cracker crust works best. I combined 3/4 lb. prepared graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 brown sugar and 1/4 c + 2T melted butter. Press a thick layer in the bottom of a 10" pie pan, bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes, and you are in business. We just couldn't wait, and cut into our pie at the 5-hour mark and it was firm. I wonder if it is because I primarily used fresh limes and just used a little reconstituted lime juice when I ran out of the real thing. I also put it in the coldest part of the refrigerator. Or maybe, I just didn't mix it that long in the food processor. Anyways, I'm no master chef, it's great and if I can do it, so can you!

Rating: 3
Great filling, but you can make a better crust! I used shortbread cookies, unsalted butter and macadamia nuts. Process until crumbly and press into pan. Bake at 350 for 10 min. Much better! Also try fresh key lime juice. Costs more but worth it.

Loved,loved,loved this recipe. For fear of offending our Southern Gentlefolk, I substituted bottled key lime juice, but regular lime peel and also used store bought graham cracker crust ( I work full time). I whipped it up on my lunch break, threw it in the fridge and the last minute guests loved it after dinner. It holds up beautifully and is a wonderful taste quencher even on these swelteriing nights.

All key limes come from Mexico now anyway so Florida has no special claim to them. I did, however, find key limes, have squeezed them all and now have lots of key lime juice. How should I modify the recipe to use it? I do think they're supposed to be more tart (tarter?), so possibly I need additional sweetener.

I thought this was great - I guess my tastes are not refined enough to discern the difference b/w key lime and lime pie. Or maybe all this time restaurants have been serving me lime pie....

Actually, the people from Cook's Illustrated magazine (real obsessive/perfectionist types) tried making key lime pie from both key limes, and regular limes-- they recommended the regular limes, for the reasons Michigan listed below-- their small size and lack of different flavour from regular limes.

Does anyone else notice that the only people who seem to have a problem with this pie are snooty Floridians who can only talk about their glorious key limes?? Key limes taste no different from regular limes, and, also on the downside, are no bigger than walnuts, making it hard to work with them. And they're nearly impossible to get. So get over yourselves. This LIME PIE was to die for!

This recipe is an abomination of traditional Key Lime Pie. If you read the other reviews, you'll notice that all the raves come from Yankees who wouldn't know a good Key Lime Pie if it hit them in the face. Stick with what works - REAL Key Limes, egg yolks, and sweetened condensed milk, simple as that. Make that other thing if you want, but don't kid yourself that it's Key Lime Pie.

This is so far away from a key lime pie it's rediculous! This is a lemon flavored cheesecake. Key limes have their own, distinct flavor that regular lemons as a sub is absolutely unthinkable. If fresh key limes are unavailable, ask your grocer for Key West Key lime juice in a jar. It is a close second to fresh. You might as well use the no bake creamcheese pie from a package too since this is just a rediculous recipe. Barf.

Next time I think I'll try mostly fresh juice and a bit of bottled key lime, for a bit more of a tart flavor.

This was my first-time-ever Key Lime Pie...I did a fair amount of comparison reading of recipe options.

I used the almond crumb crust from one of Gourmet's other recipes.

I made this pie for dessert on the 4th of July, and my guests loved it. The recipe itself is very good; though I did tweek it a bit. I made a gingersnap crust instead of the crust called for, and my husband said the lime was very intense and not sweet enough. So, I will make it again, only more sweet and use a little less lime juice than called for. But other than that, the pie was very easy to make/assemble and I ended up typing the recipe up for our guests who requested it.

To make your own Creme Fraiche: Over a low flame, heat 1 cup heavy whipping cream with 1 teaspoon buttermilk in a medium saucepan until slightly warm. Transfer the mixture to a jar or something with a loose lid. Let the mixture sit undisturbed, out on the counter for 8 hours, or for as much as 12 hours. This method works perfectly, and tastes much better than store bought Creme Fraiche. I used it in this recipe, and the effect was stunning! ANY suggestions, though, on how to firm up the pie would be so appreciated!

I made this recipie for a party after reading all the wonderful reviews it received. I typically wouldn't make a new recipie for a group of people without trying it first, but since it got so many rave reviews, I took a chance. It was TERRIBLE! I followed the recipie to a T (I came back just now to make sure I didn't miss anything). The pie never firmed up and was like trying to serve key lime SOUP in a pie crust. I will definately be looking elsewhere for a key lime pie recipie, and would not recommend making this particular dessert. Creme fraiche recipie was also terrible, putting two TBSP of buttermilk in one cup of whipping cream does nothing to thicken the creme. Mine sat 12 hours at room temp, as suggested, and resulted in nothing but warm whipping cream that couldn't be used for anything.

I usually make the creme fraiche the day before, and the pie early on the day it will be served. It needs about 10 hours to firm up. IT'S GREAT!

I have made this recipe a few times and like it with a gingersnap crust, and about two tablespoons of sugar added to the filling, which is pretty tart otherwise. Using a food processor is the best way to make sure the pie filling has no lumps of cream cheese. Make sure to scrape the sides.

Despite this being a whole day project, it was pretty straightforward. Make sure to keep the butter very cold at all times; it'll make for a very beautyful, yummy crust. Do take the time to make the creme fraiche (if you cannot buy it). The pie turned out absolutely delicious. Oh, and it turns out well even without a food processor and/or electric mixer.
