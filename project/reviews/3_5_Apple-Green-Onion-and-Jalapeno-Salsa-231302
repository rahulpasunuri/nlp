This "salsa" was a great accompaniment to the beet and carrot latkes. I brought this as a starter to a friend's house and everyone really enjoyed it.

I made this for the Cumin-Scented Beet and Gingered Carrot Latkes, so it was the perfect amount of salsa for all of it. I added a whole jalapeno; it was a great complement to the latkes and an interesting twist for applesauce and potato latkes.

Quite delicious with the beet and carrot latkes, though twice as much as needed. This would be a nice alternative to cranberry sauce with turkey or chicken.

really interesting and delicious. putting the apples in the food processor made the process much easier. we probably only needed 2/3 (at most) of the amount the recipe makes for the gingered carrot latkes.

I second AgentInAKilt. It's not meant to be a regular salsa. With the beet latkes it's outstanding.

With the latkes, this salsa is supurb. I wouldn't oompare it to mexican salsas, for this isn't what its purpose is. Jalapenos are mild, and for those looking for spicy, I would add some additional jalapenos, or other spice.

I really liked it, it was different and the jalapenos weren't overpowering

In theory, sounds interesting....with a little creative juices i.e. adobo sauce...and the right thing to compliment the flavor, you might salvage some effort. If not, 100's of better salsa recipes out there.
