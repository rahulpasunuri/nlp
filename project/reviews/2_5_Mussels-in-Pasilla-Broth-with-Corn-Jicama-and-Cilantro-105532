Very good! Tried it without mussels and it makes a nice side dish.

This was terrific. Of course Jicama is always in the store when I'm not looking for it, and yesterday when I wanted it, it was nowhere to be found. Except for no Jicama, I followed the recipe exactly. We'll make this again when we have Jicama. We'll be interested to hear from any of you about what we were missing.
