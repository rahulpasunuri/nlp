Tasty, light, healthy. Good for a weeknight or a low key weekend meal.

This is a nice easy recipe. I make when I want an easy chicken dish. Good for a weeknight. I don't bother with the pea tendrils or the carrots.

My boyfriend is a vegetarian so I decided to make this recipe with tofu and it turned out great! If you don't have snap peas or pea sprouts, it still tastes great. You can add frozen peas or frozen green beans out of seasaon instead. If you can find the pea sprouts, they do add extra flavor. Yum!
