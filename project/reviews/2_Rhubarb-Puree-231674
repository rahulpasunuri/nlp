Lovely! I made this in hopes of recreating a champagne cocktail I had at Wild Honey in London...about a tablespoon in the bottom of a glass of champagne. Perfect amount of sugar, I think, not too sweet.

My puree looked as pink as on the trifle picture, it was delicious, gorgeous, and easy to make. I would drizzle it on a cake for a nice decoration.

The color is horrible! Mine looked like pale, mauve babyfood.
