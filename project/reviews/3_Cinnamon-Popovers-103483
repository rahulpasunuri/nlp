We made these today, They were the perfect Easter breakfast! Didn't change a thing. Just remember NEVER open the oven while pop overs are baking, or they will not rise as high and can fall.

First time popover maker. Simple and delicious! I'm a total novice and made them for my wife for Mother's Day... Yum! Added a bit of butter to melt on the finished product and some fig preserve to sweeten it and it turned out great.

I didn't have any cinnamon in my pantry so I used about 1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice. It really made the recipe. Otherwise they came out perfect!

These were super quick and required very little ingredients - I rate them superb for the minimal amount of energy required. Mine were light and airy. I served them with butter, cherry preserves and powered sugar. There are more thrilling popover recipes out there, but this one can't be beat for its simplicity and tastiness.

Made for breakfast. Had to explain to my daughter that these were NOT like popovers!! Rose, but did not get light, airfilled and crispy- fell immediately when out of over and were heavy!!

The entire time I was eating the fresh popover, I kept thinking how much better it would be if it was filled with a walnut/raisin/honey flavoured whipped cream...easy to make but a little bland. I ended up showering mine with a little more powdered sugar after I ate the top! My kids really enjoyed watching these cook!

The popovers didn't rise (and pop over). Maybe it's something I did - I used just a little more flour than the recipe called for, plus a little sugar - but I've never had this problem with other popover recipes.

They were good, but not excellent, the mix tasted kind of bland, before putting it into the oven. I would suggest adding sugar, and more flour, the powdered sugar was a nice touch, but was hard to taste.
