Yummy! Sausage is good in stuffing.

I must admit I made several substitutions: Italian for egg bread, onions for shallots, and most importantly, cajun andouille for breakfast sausage (I am in cajun country). I found the stuffing required a lot more liquid when cooked in a pan, probably due to the drier bread. And my boyfriend found the parsnip flavor too strong. I liked it.
