I love this recipe! I've made it several times since it was in Bon Appetit. I'm ashamed to admit that I use it instead of the stuffed artichoke recipe my grandmother passed down to me...

This was a good recipe to ruin a perfectly good artichoke.

Love this recipe. The ingredients are simple and the flavor is great. I usually serve this recipe as a first course.

This was exactly what I had in my kitchen and needed to cook asap. I used some left over Gluten Free bread and put it in the processor to get crumbs. I really enjoyed this dish, and it is a great idea.
