After reading some of the reviews I have come to the conclusion that people don't taste for flavor and seasoning as they cook--I have rarely seen a chef not taste while cooking. It is only while you are in the process of cooking that you can change up something if you find it bland or not to your liking. To not do so is a waste of ingredients, money and time.

Excellent! The ravioli were a little work, however, the sauce was easy and delicious!

These were so delicate and melt in your mouth. As good as my favorite Italian restaurant's ravioli by far. I used swiss cheese and a garlic Italian feta. I placed all the ravioli in a big oval corning ware dish and placed the homemade sauce on top. I placed in refridgerator to let it set awhile. Then I heated it up in the oven and my family loved it. They were very impressed with the flavor and texture!!

I made this just as called for in the recipe and it was lousy. Very bland and boring filling. Don't waste your time!

These ravioli were pretty good. I made them as the recipe specified. I made the filling and the sauce the night before so it didn't take me that long just to make the ravioli the next day. After biting in though we decided they did need some kick so we added some crushed red pepper flakes.

I added an egg, some parsley and mixed in parmessano reggiano because romano is too strong for me by itself. Another time I added diced pancetta that I fried until crisp and mixed the potato into that and let it fry a bit, then added the cheese when cool. Good.

I thought these were awful. And far too labor-intensive for the result. If I were to make them again, I'd substitute basil for the mint.

These were very tasty. I substituted fresh oregano for the mint and like the previous reviewer used a different spaghetti sauce. Because I didn't have a full package of wontons, some of the delicious filling was left over. I refrigerated the mix and the next day I shaped it into small discs, did an egg wash, rolled them in cornflake and bread crumbs and fried them. I may just make the filling to make the croquettes/ pancakes again.

This recipe was easy and good. I substituted fresh basil from my garden for the mint, and served the ravioli with my homemade spaghetti sauce instead of the one in the recipe. Very nice presentation, and impressive looking!
