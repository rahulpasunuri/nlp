Made this for Christmas Eve dinner (Feast of the Seven Fishes). Quick and easy, can't beat that at the holidays. Tasted great too. Didn't have a cheesecloth so we lined the strainer with paper towels, which worked just fine. Will make this again.

WOW, never made mussels before and did for the first time for my mom as a treat. OMG they were so good...and the broth was fabulous with dipped bread.

this was easy and fantastic! but i added garlic and softened the garlic, shallots and onion in butter before adding the wine.

I was so sure I would love this recipe given the earlier reviews, but I only liked it. I liked it well enough to try again. I think I might like it better if I sauteed the onions before adding the wine and vinegar, just a little caramelization.

Oh my yum! I normally have to fiddle with a recipe to get it "right", but this one pretty much nailed the yumminess right off the bat. I forgot to strain the juices and nobody was bothered, and the juices are perfect for sopping up with a garlic bread.
