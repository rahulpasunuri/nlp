This was an excellent recipe. I bought a whole red snapper and thought this recipe sounded good. Very easy to make - not too many ingredients and delicious when done. Followed the instructions to the letter and the fish was cooked beautifully. Served it with brown rice, yellow squash and a small salad.

This recipe is really, really easy. Just have a little faith and follow it to the letter. Turned out absolutely perfect, had none of the other issues mentioned. There is a little bit of liquid build up but you just pour it out prior to serving on a large plate. This is a keeper.

Half the snapper was a bit overcooked by the time the other half is done. I even checked at 25, 30, 40 min intervals. 45min was needed. Flavor was just ok too...the bottom part that ended up being submerged in juice and fish liquid didn't have a great texture :-P

Wonderful! I used limes instead of lemons; rosemary instead of thyme; margarine instead of butter; and monkfish instead of snapper. A keeper!

This dish was wonderful. I used tilapia fillets instead of snapper and my whole family loved it. Instead of 1 tbs lemon juice, I used 1 tsp.

I made this dish with 2 smaller snappers since I couldn't get a bigger snapper at the fish market, and it was one of the best fish dishes I've had in a while. One thing I did do differently was that I forgot to put the lemon juice in before cooking, so I squeezed on fresh lemon juice after it was done cooking. Maybe this helped the recipe?

It came out quite nice. Was not wet as others have mentioned, the kids liked it very much (ages 2,7,11) which is a feat in and of itself. I only wish I had kept more than two snappers whole after my last fishing trip.

It was pretty wet, like the last reviwer said, but i thought it wasn't so bad. My boyfriend didn't really like, said the texture wasn't good. I would recommend makind slits in the fish and stuffing it with the flavorings, that might help add a bit more flavor

I live in Florida and my husband and I have caught and cooked many red snapper. My rule is always to use recipes exactly without tweaking the first time and this was no exception. I was very disappointed in this recipe though I will say it had good flavor. Followed the recipe exactly with a 2# snapper. It was overcooked, mushy with an almost "wet" feeling on the tongue. Serving it was a nightmare. I have cooked and eaten snapper that I liked much better than this one. All in all, I felt I had wasted my money.I usually find the comments by others pretty much on the mark but I sure didn't this time.

Wonderful recipe! Wonder, would it work with Monkfish?

Easy, easy, easy and oh so delicious. I made this dish after shopping all day. The adults and children alike loved the dish. You might need to prepare more than you think you'll need, your family and guests will have seconds.

Wonderful moist fish with a nice flavor, I upped the ante a bit and used limes instead of lemons, and added 1/2 of a (seeded) Habanero Chile. This is a good fish dish.

I used Emperor Snapper fish fillets, floured and fried in clarified butter and its just as delicious. If fish fillets are frozen, they must be thawed prior to cooking. They may be baked or fried.
