Ha, ha...I just went back to Texas Chef's original post and saw that comment was from 7 years ago! They probably do have shiso and kaffir lime in West Texas now!

I haven't made this yet, but plan to make it this weekend. I was searching for a recipe to use the excess of kaffir lime leaves that I have, but I just wanted to point out to Texas Chef that it's VERY easy to grow your own Kaffir lime tree. I have one that started out very small (I bought it at a local nursery), but is now quite large after only two years. It's also really easy to grow your own shiso, too; seeds are readily available online or in specialty garden shops and it also grows very quickly as it's very herb-like. I am in Austin, Texas. Obviously, we're all going to be limited a little in our choice of ingredients, based upon where we live, but if you don't like the recipe, just move on...there are plenty of others...

Ummm Texan chef -- not everyone lives in Texas! Here in Melbourne Australia we can easily get both those ingredients. So open your mind and see past your own four walls! Can't wait to try this

Outstanding. I used dried Kafir Lime leaves and it worked out fine. I couldn't find Shiso, so I used Mint. It was still amazing.

You don't have to limit yourself to Shiso and Kaffir Lime. I have always kept this in my recipe box because you can always substitute other herbs, for example, lemongrass/mint for the mousse. Tarragon makes a good mousse, especially topping a blueberry compote and shortbread

Catch a clue, Texas, the site is called "EpiCURIOUS" which clearly you don't understand.

Why the indignation over the shiso leaves and kaffir lime leaves? If epicurious were to confine themselves to recipes using ingredients available in West Texas, we'd be seeing nothing but chili and steak recipes. We wouldn't learn a thing.

Khaffir lime and shiso leaves?--in Midland, Texas? You've gone beyond the far horizons!
