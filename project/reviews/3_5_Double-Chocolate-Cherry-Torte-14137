This is really good. I substituted strawberries from the farmers' market because those were available. I left out the 1/4 C sugar (accidentally) but thought it turned out great.

This was good, but not enough to make again. I was a bit disappointed because I was expecting a lot from the recipe. I thought the cherries overpowered the cake and make it a bit soggy. It was easy to make, though!

Only took 42 minutes to bake, I lowered the temperature a bit because my springform was dark. I used ValRhona bittersweet chocolate and still thought the results were just ok. Cake a teeny bit dry, I expected a fudgier texture, maybe I overbaked it a touch, even at less time than called for. Good flavour, worth trying again.

This was easy and delicious. I couldn't find cherries so I substituted strawberries (with a dash of almond extract added) and it came out wonderfully moist and chocolatey. I would make it again - or even use two cakes layered for a decadent, decadent ocassion.

I made this torte for a family party. Quite rich, but definitely a crowd pleaser!! I loved the chocolate!! I substituted the Kirsch for almond extract and it was a great marriage of flavours. Not something you'd make everyday as it is time consuming but, for a party in which you want to woo the guests this is your dessert!!

This was a delicious torte, with just enough cherry flavour to compliment but not offset the chocolate.

This is pretty good, it has a nice flavor and fudgy texture. Definately serve with Whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

Tbis torte is simple and incredible on the taste buds. I substituted a can of cherries instead of fresh ones, and it was delicious. A great addition is a little Kirsch added to the whipped cream with a little sugar.

An unbelievable cake. I have made it several times. It keeps beautifully in the fridge too. Substitute berries for cherrys if you can't get fresh ones.
