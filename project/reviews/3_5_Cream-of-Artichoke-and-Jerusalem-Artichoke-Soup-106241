Really delicious - yes, labor intensive, but worth it. Artichokes can be expensive, I don;t mind the labor for a special dish. I used all Globe Artichokes as no Jerusalems were available. I substituted 1/2 cup 1/2 & 1/2 for the 3/4 cup heavy cream - never missed the extra fat - this soup is super rich, and had excellent flavor and a smooth texture. Blended in the Vita-Mix so I did not have to strain. I would definitely add some good sauteed mushrooms to this soup next time - the color of the soup was unappealing, but the color would be expected and acceptable, if it contained mushrooms. The color of my soup was very tan and blah. This was a really good recipe I will use again. The taste of the fresh artichokes really came through, and it was delicious cold the next day, too!. Had it been a pale green pretty color, it would have been **** stars.

I made this soup for a group of ten and it was quite a hit. I used baby artichokes which are much easier to prep than the large variety. I liked it so much I am making it again tonight.

This was delicious! Jerusalem artichokes were not in season, so I used a yukon gold potato instead. Also substituted yogurt for the cream. It turned out great! This dish has so much flavor without the addition of many spices. But the artichoke prep was a bit of work. I will try it with canned artichoke hearts next time and hope it turns out just as tasty. Otherwise it may have to be one of those special moment dishes.

Simple techniques. I used a Chardonnay, half and half, sunchokes, globe chokes. Let it cool a bit before you puree, strain, and reheat. Great for a cool fall night.

I solved the problem of time consumption and woodiness by using canned artichoke hearts, which made this soup was easy and delicious! Just use one 14 oz can of "extra small" artichoke hearts (not marinated), which are less fibrous than the regular ones. Then you can eliminate that entire section of directions on trimming the artichokes.

Making this soup is a pain, but oh so worth it! I too found that simply using the immersion blender does not break down the fibers sufficiently. After blending I force it through a mesh strainer. It gives your arm a good work out and isn't fun, but the soup is delicious. I have recently been omitting the cream at the end to make it a bit healthier and it is still wonderful!

I prefert to make everything from scratch and bought fresh artichokes for this ended up with the fiberous soup that everyone warned about. The straining process was not worth the time for the end result. Perhaps marinated artichokes would alleviate this problem.

My family loved the flavor of this soup. It must be put through a ricer as the artichokes are so fiberous, blending alone does not break down the fiber.

Thought this soup was quite good, would be a nice start to a formal meal. Did not use full amount of cream and garnished simply with sprinkling of paprika

We found this soup to be rich and very flavorful. After pureeing I forced the soup through a seive to remove any artchoke "fibers" . Doing that allowed me to use more of the Artichoke and hence get more of its flavor (also needed to be less precise when trimming).

This was sooo good it was unbelievable, very time consuming however. I recommend you get help preparing the artichokes, since that is the only time/labor intensive part. Well worth the work for special occasions. dont leave out the toasted almond garnish, it really adds a nice touch.

Delicious. I used olive oil and milk instead of butter and cream for a lighter version and it was fantastic. I didn't think that it was time-consuming to make (but then again I had help preparing the artichokes!).

This soup was absolutely delicious (pure essence of artichoke) but it was far too labor- and time- consuming to be worth it. It took me about 3 hrs total; I used baby artichokes and didn't trim enough of the tough parts off, so had to strain the whole lot to get rid of the fibers after processing in the blender. Oops.

Time-consuming but well worth it. I served it cold at Easter and my guests loved it.
