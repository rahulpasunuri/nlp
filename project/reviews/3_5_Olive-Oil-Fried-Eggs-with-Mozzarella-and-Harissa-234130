My husband was on a "bland diet" because of surgery and I made this without the harissa and it was still delicious.

I thought this was good but not remarkable. (We eat homemade harissa a lot these days so it was not surprise, but sill delicious.) The mozzarella was delicious, but not distinctive. I think a good goat cheese or something with more kick would be more interesting. I used good sourdough rolls and farm fresh eggs. very good but not distinctive...

Awesome! I had made my own harissa and found this recipe so I could use more of it. I made this dish for dinner, we loved it so much I made it again the very next night! I even tried it with Canadian bacon and used regular bread - delicious! It's very easy and so satisfying.

Fantastic. I used sriracha sauce instead of hot pepper relish, and large slices of freshly baked country loaf instead of brioche. Very satisfying, and better than any brunch entree we could have had at a restaurant today!

This is an amazing egg dish (and how often can you say that?) I used Challah as the bread and used a mixture of ajvar and Shug (similar to harrisa) I also added oregano instead of parsley at the end. Spectacular. enough said

This was delicious and I didnt have any brioche type bread (so I used pita which was not spectacular)but it was still a stunning late night snack. I used Schug (a Yemenite pepper paste) instead of traditional harrisa and mild adjvar. It was spicy, sweet, salty, soft and gooey and very satisfying. I can only imagine brioche would have made it that much better.

Made this at the cabin for something different. The sauce was very tasty, had a kick but wasn't too spicy for a general audience and was well-received. Everyone liked the mild, fresh mozzarella with the eggs. Would do again and the sauce would be great with other things - grilled fish maybe?

My husband LOVES this recipe. So much so, he requested me to make it again for his birthday breakfast! I didn't have the harissa, but substituted a hot pepper relish from Stonewall Kitchens I had on hand with great results. We like it served on whole wheat English muffins instead of brioche. A nod to our South Beach diet!
