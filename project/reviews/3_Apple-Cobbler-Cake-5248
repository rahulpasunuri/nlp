Bland. Thought the cake texture would be a nice touch, but a regular old cobbler crust, or just a proper biscuit- would have been the better way to go. Too eggy and tough.

I think this recipe is delicious as is. It might be even better with just a few more apples added to it.

This was okay, nothing special. Quite frankly, the cake texture was strange. I think if you're going to do a cobbler, make the real deal with a true biscuit topping and call it a day. Also I used 8 apples in an 11x17 dish which was too shallow. A previous reviewer suggested using a larger pan which makes the dessert too dry. And I used oil instead of water in the topping. So much for this one.

awful recipe. would never make again. it is not a cake by any means or a crumble. way too dry, apples didn't quite cook and tons of heavy "crumble" which is too tough and tasteless to really eat.

Oops, I followed the suggestion of Stacy from Elma, NY; not the cook from Hopkinton, Ma.

I followed the suggestion of the cook from Hopkinton, Ma: 1) replaced water with oil, 2)used all the batter for the base and top it with oatmeal streusel topping. Quite delicious. I baked the batter as directed for 30 minutes, after which I added the apples and streusel topping for the remaining 45 minutes.

This was a bit different, but very tasty. "Cobbler cake" seemed an apt description. We enjoyed it with vanilla ice cream.

Like one of the other reviewers, I think I must have done something wrong, but I tried the recipe twice, each time with disappointing results. The batter wasn't anything like cake and it overwhelmed the apples.

Cake like, more delicious when hot. Used orange juice in batter for extra flavour.

I think I must have done something wrong...my cake was more like shortcake than a soft cake that I imagined. Husband loved it though and a great way to use apples picked from a local orchard.

I have made this countless times for my family. We specifically love this for the two crusts. I have used a variety of fresh fruit instead of apples - peaches with cinnamon; blackberries; a combination of blackberries and marionberries with cinnamon - each one is great and continually requested by my family.

This Apple Cobbler Cake is a wonderful, yet simple, reminder of the good things that fall can bring. For the first time, I used the Honey Crisp variety of apple. It was delicious!!!

I have made this cake on numerous occasions with great results. I use Cortland apples as they are sweeter and "cook down" a bit more than Granny Smiths. I decrease the sugar tossed with the apples by half. It's a great recipe to bring along for a brunch or dinner, very reliable with a nice appearance. Almost everyone asks for the recipe. My family loves it and the whole cake disappears very quickly.

I made this last night and everyone loved it (served it with lightly whipped cream). I added currants just to make it a little different, and also incorporated all the hints from other cooks--more sugar and more spices on the apples. I sprinkled on a little flour on top of the batter which made it less likely to stick when spreading on the bottom of the pan. The dish reminded me a little of apple charlotte like my Scottish mother used to make.

Because of the previous reviews on this dish, I added oil in place of water to keep it from being so dry. We tried this one last night when it was hot... and actually, I liked it better this morning with coffee. The "cake" portion I would liken to a sweet biscuit. It's quite good, and I think next time I will make it in a larger pan, and use all the batter for the base, and make a nice crumb topping for it.

I loved this recipe and I get asked for the recipe often. I added more sugar, nutmeg, and allspice to the apples. I have also made the dish with mangoes. It was great.

This is a very good dessert to make. I would make it again. it pretty sweet and rich and it goes quite well with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.

Overall it was very good. It needs to be served warm or it is dry. Ice cream is great with it. It is a nice change from the usual apple pie and apple crisp. I served 5 people and we ate 1/2 of the dessert.

This recipe is fabulous. It is definetly the best when it is still warm and fresh. I added just a little extra vanilla extract to the cake. I will definetly make this recipe again.

I made this recipe for company and it was a big hit. It's not too sweet but certainly delicious. I printed out this recipe and keep it with my other recipes. I used several kinds of apples, whatever I had on hand.

Looked gorgeous, and brought it to a Sunday afternoon football gathering. No one raved about it and my husband said that it was just so-so. Kind of dry? I served it warm too with ice-cream. Give a try - maybe you will have better luck than me.

My young boys loved it with vanilla ice cream. My husband rated this recipe as 4. Very simple to make! I reduced the sugar by half and used Gala Apples and tasted very good. I also added half tsp of nutmeg to apple mixture. I'll make this again.

Altogether good! I served it to company but it would make a good family dessert, too. Very tasty & easy to make.

I have made this 3 times already, and received rave reviews each time. I add extra apples to improve the cobbler to cake ratio. Best when served warm

This is an excellent dessert served warm with vanilla icecream.

This was a very good recipe all the kids loved it! I would definitly make it again. For all those who think it's bad you should try making it again. You probably made it wrong that's why

great taste, but i will search for a recipe with a better cake texture. this one was too dense. great way to get rid of spare apples

Rating: 1
This isn't a cake at all; it really is an apple cobbler. It's just not a very good apple cobbler. To me, there is way too much topping relative to the amount of apples, and the topping is way too dense. It's like really heavy biscuit dough. There are better cobbler recipes out there.

I found the texture of this cake a little disappointing...not quite enough of a cobbler and yet not quite enough of a cake...it missed the mark a bit but did OK in a dessert buffet. Served it with homemade cinnamon-vanilla ice cream.

it was delicous, thank you so much!

Very very good. Was very quick to make also! Can't wait to make again!

This was a great change from the run-of-the-mill apple dishes. I took the advice to use extra cinnamon and some nutmeg and it was terrific and got rave reviews from even my Mother-in-Law!

This is an easy, delicious dessert that keeps well covered in the refrigerator if you had to and you can just warm it up when needed. Good if you are cooking with kids, too. The little ones can do all the stirring and mixing and handling the dough and the adults can do all the chopping. Delicious!!!

YUM! Definitely a keeper. It's pretty easy to make and worth every bit. I added more cinnamon than called for and also some nutmeg. Add those spices to taste. Great with French vanilla ice cream (of course!) and I'd suggest a dusting of powdered sugar. :)
