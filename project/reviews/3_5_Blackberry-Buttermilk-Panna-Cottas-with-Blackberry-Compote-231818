Fantastic flavor. I do think the amount of gelatin could be cut almost in half - the texture was a little stiffer than it should have been.

I have made this dessert over and over and it gets easier every time. It is a family favorite and a tradition for Easter.

I made this in my Baking and Pastry Arts program last week and it was excellent. Instead of compote, I made blackberry jelly and put a thin layer over the panna cotta to set. I find I like the look of panna cotta in a clear glass a little better than as a mold.

I served this at the end of a 5 course Easter Eggstravaganza and my friends loved it. It was very easy to make, even with all the straining. The texture was exceptionally smooth because of the extra work. And it tasted delicious even without the blackberry syrup which never made it home from the store.

I have now made this recipe using blackberries, tayberries (last night's variation), raspberries and strawberries - all grown on our acreage. It is an exceptionally good dessert. As my young daughter doesn't like the taste of liqueurs, I usually substitute some fruit jelly for the creme de cassis. Easy and exquisitely pretty. Can't think why some reviewers find it too labour intensive: execution and clean-up can be easily accomplished in half an hour. Kids love using the blender to puree the berries with the buttermilk and the double-straining isn't exactly arduous!

I agree with previous reviewers that this recipe is fabulous with frozen berries. But, I have waited months to try this recipe using fresh berries and it was worth the wait!! Just a little extra yummy. The compote had a more intense flavour and the berries a nicer texture. Same beautiful, quick and easy presentation and I used rubber molds as suggested with just running a knife around the edge.

A beautiful and delicious dessert. I skipped the creme de cassis in the compote (i did not have any on hand and live on an island). I had no trouble getting the panna cottas out of the molds AFTER I dipped in warm water. (I used 6 oz ceramic custard cups.) However, I would not call this a "quick" recipe, as is indicated by the clock symbol. All that straining is laborious--though worth it--and there is a very good reason why most reviewers made this a day or two ahead. I will do the same next time I make it.

I have now served this for a brunch and a dinner to rave reviews. I made it the day before using frozen berries for both parts and blackberry jelly instead of syrup. Blackberries are lucious, plentiful and free all around Vancouver in the summer. We pick them, make jelly and freeze them for use all year long. I freeze them first on cookie trays so that they stay nice and firm and seperate. I had 16 for brunch so I used 1/2 cup rubber molds and they slipped out perfectly. From standing start to finish I had them done and in the fridge in less than 30 minutes. It took me about 5 minutes to plate them the day of the brunch and I added a swirl of whipped cream to the presentation. They were melt in your mouth spectacular. I couldn't wait to try them again for my dinner party. This recipe is a keeper!

I loved this recipe. In Vancouver, blackberries are easily found growing wild, literally all over the city. It was great to find a new dessert recipe that uses these wonderful berries!

I love this unique, colorful dessert and agree with previous readers about the pleasant tanginess. I have not had much luck getting the desserts to "release" when inverting them -- even after dipping in warm water and loosening with a knife. Perhaps the problem stems from our shallow, wide ceramic ramekins. A cooking version of creme de cassis can be found, near syrup and/or jelly, in some specialty food shops. It's less expensive than the liqueur.

Used frozen blackberries for the panna cottas and fresh berries for the compote. Made the compote the morning of the party, made the panna cottas two days ahead, poured into glass bowls and did not unmold. Looked as terrific as they tasted. I will make this again and thus the $9 cost for the large bottle of liqueur will soon be amortized.

I thought this was an easy-to-make, distinctive, and most importantly, a very tasty recipe that has a nice "wow" factor that is sure to impress guests. The buttermilk gives it a nice creamy tang, and the blackberries a lovely color and taste as well. The only reason I wouldn't give this a four-fork rating is because it is a little expensive to make--blackberries and creme de cassis are not cheap, and this recipe calls for a lot of both. It's not something I could make too often. But otherwise, delicious!!

I made this for a dinner party recently and it was very well received. Not only is it sumptuous, but it also presents very nicely. It is perfect for making in advance, too. I made the panna cottas the night before and kept them covered and refrigerated. The compote I made the morning of my dinner party and kept it covered at room temperature. It only took about 5 minutes to assemble the final dessert, making it an ideal component of an dinner menu which is otherwise labor intensive. I got this recipe from the April issue of Gourmet, and so I found it somewhat surprising that the dish would feature blackberries when they are completely impossible to find fresh. I used frozen blackberries for the entire recipe, and it did not seem to suffer noticeably, which was a pleasant surprise.

I made this for Easter. We thought it was delicious! I used frozen berries for the puree and fresh for the compote. Everyone loved the blackberry flavor. It was very pretty and easy. Contrary to the previos review - I found the directions quite clear; the gelatin measurement is given in teaspoons, it just takes 2 envelopes to get there, you do not use all of the 2nd envelope.

This is a food stylist's recipe (it appears in an article about "lilac" colored food). It is not meant for ordinary mortals. It calls for large quantities of blackberries (completely out of season--I used frozen) but the panna cottas themselves do not end up tasting of blackberry, despite all the laborious sieving and the (I now see)rather desperate addition of blackberry jam. The accompanying sauce is pleasant enough and it all tasted okay (be certain to use TWO packages of gelatine because of the fruit puree--the directions are a little ambiguous). However, panna cotta is a simple and easy dessert; why work so hard? Regular panna cotta with blackberry sauce would be easier, better, and a whole lot cheaper, unless you have a private blackberry patch. Blackberries are meant for cobbler, anyway.
