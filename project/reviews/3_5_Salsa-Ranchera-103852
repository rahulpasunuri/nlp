good base. needs raw garlic, a bit of lemon juice, reduce the red wine vinegar to taste and for those who like the smokiness, but not too strong, just add some peeled whole tomatoes from a can or fresh-- gives it a good refreshing kick

This is good, but I wouldn't, and didn't, use it as a chip salsa. Try pounding some chicken breasts, browning, and then simmering in the salsa for a while. Also, the recipe did not include salt and pep--you should be sure not to forget to season before roasting and again to taste.

I would make it again but only with a few additional ingredients. Without them it is bland and you may be left wondering "gosh, its good but something is missing." I suggest 2 tablespoons of minced garlic, 2 tsp salt, and I added corn that I grilled on the cob. I do think the key to this is quality ingredients. I used fresh picked tomatoes from my garden and summer sweet corn.

I brought this to a party and received tons of compliments. I switched it up a little though. I didn't roast the oninons and added them raw. I also added a can of black beans and some fresh steamed corn. I used a jalepeno instead of a serrano.

Surprisingly bland and disappointing considering effort. We tried to save it by adding more serranos, then roasted garlic, and finally a little cider vinegar. Maybe I just don't like the taste of roasted tomatoes, but then, neither did my guests. Good thing I made three different salsas.

If you are going to take the time to make this, definitely double it. I doubled everything except the amount of oil, and I wound up with about 3 1/2 cups. It is fairly mild so you can go from there (one hot batch, one mild).

This salsa was the favorite of many made for a Latin-themed party, it was gone first and the bowl was scraped clean. My batch only made about 2.5 cups using 3 lbs of tomatoes, you may want to double the recipe if serving at a party.

I made this to serve with fajitas. Everyone loved the smokey taste. It is easily the best salsa I've ever had.

I love this stuff. Use the juice from the tomatoes in a soup or stew. I agree that jalapeno or other people adds a nice kick. But this is good stuff.

I made this one day when a friend was joining us for dinner. The three of us devoured the entire batch. We loved the smokiness of the tomatoes. Thanks to Gourmet and El Teddy's for supplying me with the recipe. We can enjoy it anytime without having to venture into the city when we crave a good salsa!

Good salsa and very easy! Definitely worth making to try but salsa is such a preference would make for yourself before serving. Did not feel it was the "best ever" but will make again for sure.

Loved the roasted flavor! This was not hot enough fo my family, so next time I am going to add some jalapeno or chipotle peppers as well. A nice change from fresh salsas!

Very good and very easy to prepare. I have also added sliced celery and carrots.
