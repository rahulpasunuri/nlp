Delicious sandwich. Great for a lunch on the go; using up that leftover roasted chicken; afternoon parties.

Good way to use leftover chicken.

I wasn't crazy about this recipe as is. If I made it again I'd use freshly grilled chicken breasts and put them on toasted buns rather than bread slices. I think the sharpness of the watercress overwhelms the subtler flavor of the chive butter, so I'd substitute another green.

Delicious Recipe! Made it along with your Roasted Garlic and Parmesan soup ... MmMmm!! Got plenty of raves from guests (and requests) to make it again!

Bravo, cook from Boston, for learning to cook (and to express yourself so well) at such an early age. You'll have a lifetime of wonderful experiences in the kitchen.

this is an exellent and simple roast chicken sandwich recipie. I am only 11 but I cook dinner a few times a week and I'm a su-chef for my dad. I was really impressed with the taste and I'd reccomend using warm chicken freshly cooked for these sandwiches.
