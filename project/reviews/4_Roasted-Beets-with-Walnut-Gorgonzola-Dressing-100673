Very good and a bit rich. I forgot to add the b. vinegar and it was still delicious.

This was a very nice recipe, and I thought I didn't like beets. I used golden beets instead (much easier for clean up and their taste is milder). I sliced them in half before roasting them... I wasn't sure if I was supposed to or not? They roasted nicely. I also added the components separately rather than mixing the dressing all together. The onions with the vinegar were nicely pickled and the toasted nuts I sprinkled on. Then my cream sauce was thin enough to drizzle over top. Very good!

How do you prevent the cream from curdling with the vinegar?

Wonderfully easy and delicious. I used 2% milk in place of the cream and like many others, switched to goat cheese. Can't wait to make this again!

This was a great alternative to the traditional beet dish. The dressing was so favorful. Everyone mentioned how you could taste each individual ingrediant in the dressing. I doubled the recipe for a larger gathering.

The taste of this was wonderful. I used to not be a fan of raw onions, but they really contribute to the taste of this dish. My only argument is with the presentation. Next time, I will add the onions and walnuts to the salad, not include them as part of the dressing. The walnuts coated in dressing are less attractive than if the dressing were just drizzled on.

I love any combination of roasted beets and creamy cheese - and this is a great and slightly more sophisticated alternative to the typical goat cheese & vinaigrette. To serve as a buffet salad, I opt to lightly dress baby arugula and mound in the centre of a platter surrounded by overlapping beet slices (alternating with orange or plum slices if desired); dressing can be drizzled over beets, or simply on the side.

Yummy. Like others, I got rave reviews on the dressing. Great flavors. I am definitely putting this in the keeper file.

Outstanding dressing.

The dressing is great over pasta! You can modify this dressing and uses it in many ways. One way is to do it with blue cheese, sherry vinegar and walnut oil and chopped toasted walnuts. That is terrific over celery matchsticks and endive ribbons. Either way, the walnut dressing is great.

I just re-made this recipe, and I have to confess that I liked the way it came out the first time a little bit better. The first time, I was making it just for myself, so I kind of threw together some of the ingredients and didn't measure too well. My dressing that time came out more runny, which I think I actually prefer. The thick blob of dressing is an interesting presentation, though. I couldn't find fresh basil anywhere this time, and I thought that the salad suffered for the lack of it. I kept saying, "It's so much better with basil, I swear..." Oh, well. I still liked this salad a lot and I plan to make it again.

I haven't made this yet but it looks delicious. Just a question: Can I make this as a topping for pasta? I'm thinking linguine tossed with the walnut gorgonzola dressing with beet cubes mixed in. Has anyone tried a variation like this?

Rating: 3
This salad is wonderful, no question. But making it is rather time consuming, so I'd only prepare it again if the rest of the menu was very simple. Roasting the beets, peeling them, cooking the walnuts, whipping the dressing....it's a lot of work for a side salad!

We made this for a party and it was a hit. We used half arugula & half mixed greens and then opted to do without the cream and just sprinkled the cheese on top. It was really yummy and received many compliments.

I liked this recipe a lot. In my case, the other flavors rather overwhelmed the beets, but I think that it's because I used golen beets rather than normal beets. I'd imagine they have a more mild flavor. I would certainly not serve this dish to anyone with picky tastes or, shall we say, an 'unrefined' palate--the flavors are quite intense. The dressing is wonderful and could have many applications. I didn't mind what others described as a "muddy" appearance.

My husband also is one of those self professed beet haters and he loved this. I first had this dish at OLIVES and it is easy and delicious.

This is absolute perfection. I made this for the boyfriend last night and hid the leftovers. That's how good it is! I used Trader Joe's walnut gorg tortellini: served in a circle over arugula, surrounded by quartered beets, with the dollop of the sauce in the center. It was gorgeous and more importantly, beautiful. This will be served for the holidays!

I have made this recipe many times. The way to prevent the "muddy" appearance of the dressing is to use white balsamic vinegar instead of the traditional dark.

Rating: 4
Because of what I had on hand, I made this with pecans & goat cheese. It was delicious, but the dressing was very unattractive.......sort of muddy looking. Next time, I would toss the beets with the vinegar/onion/basil mixture, then top with the cheese/cream and nuts on that. It would be more attractive and the textures & colors would be better showcased. One non-beet eating guest just spread the dressing on french bread and loved it!

Well, I made a boo-boo on this recipe but the results were a hit with guests. Instead of adding the walnuts, onions, basil, etc. to the gorgozola/cream blend, I tossed those ingredients with the roasted beets and served the gorgonzola/cream on the side. Forgot the arugula altogether. The result was a delicious beet salad with optional dressing and it was terrific. Those who indulged in the simple dressing were treated to a fresh, creamy taste that complimented the salad and those that didn't enjoyed a delicious and richly flavored salad that stood on its own. Yum!!

Rating: 4
The gorgonzola sauce is out of this world and could be used in many ways other than on the beets. My husband never thought he liked beets until I made this recipe. Make sure the beets are all the way roasted through--I had mine in for the suggested time and they were still a little tough for my taste.

Whoa. I wonder if CarlyP gets so upset every time she reads a recipe that tells her to heat EVOO. She must spend a lot of time being angry! Of course using EVOO in this recipe is totally acceptable and, for that matter, preferred for the heady dimension it brings to this delicious dish of classic flavors. Besides, I trust most any recipe Todd English writes. I will make this dish over and over, for it could turn any beet skeptic into a beetaholic.

Great recipe - I make it at dinner parties and get a great response. And I find the extra virgin olive oil adds a nice flavor to the walnuts.

Rating: 0
Anyone who understands anything about olive oils knows better than to *heat* extra virgin olive oil! For crying out loud, extra virgin olive oil is used for dipping and dressings ONLY. When you heat it, it loses all the flavours- defeating the point of using it for it's delicate quality. What an amateur goof up by Epicurious.

I had never made anything with fresh beets before and this was excellent! My husband loved it and is already asking when I will make it again. Both the beets and the dressing had wonderful flavors either separate or together. The arugula adds a nice touch too.

I love roasted roasted beets! Everything about this recipe appealed to me but when I made it I found the walnut gorgonzola dressing just too thick. Next time I will blend some of the gorgonzola with the cream and sprinkle the rest on the salad. Don't omit the walnuts. Can't beat it for texture and taste.

Delicious--I have always loved roasted beets---a winter staple in our house (along w/ other roots)so the real treat for me in this recipe is the dressing---YUM!!! So good..I will find many other uses for the dressing- it is delicious!

I had a lump of gorgonzola in the fridge and I needed to do something with it. I substituted Pecans and white wine vinegar because that is what I had on hand. I upped the amount of cream because it was a salad dressing I wanted. Results, excellent!

This salad is SO GOOD! The flavors go together so well and the different textures are great. I will make this again and again and again . . . The dressing is to die for -- although next time I will make it with regular milk -- I'm not sure the cream is really necessary.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was quite good. I have always disliked beets, but have never had them roasted so I didn't know what this would be like. The beets were so incredible. They were so sweet, they were almost like candy! The dressing in this recipe is out of this world. The beets and the dressing together were quite an interesting blend of flavors. Different from anything I've had before, which was part of it's appeal. I will definitely make roasted beets again, even if I don't put the dressing on top. I'll make the dressing again, too, for other salads or even meats.

The dressing is incredible, absolutely amazing. I put the onions in with the warm walnuts just to cook them a little from the residual heat. Our beets were small and they shriveled down to nothing, so we just adapted the recipe and made it a roasted beet salad. Try this one!

Lovely recipe. However, the vinegar/blue cheese/arugula might be too bitter for some. I added a tablespoon of good quality honey - gentler on the palate

I just rubbed the beets with a little olive oil and put them on the grill for about 10 minutes med/high heat. They came out fine. This dressing is delicious.

I liked this so much that I made it for two seperate dinner parties that were in the same weekend. Both groups were equally impressed and plates were wiped clean! I did not use aurgula though and subsituted mixed greens instead.

The dressing is to die for. I throw everything in the food processor for a creamy texture. I made it the first time with the beets and later for a party, served with water crackers. It was a tremendous hit. I made a double batch for 10 people and it was gone in about 20 minutes! Everyone asked for the recipe. I told them to visit epicurious.com

I was out of red onion but had shallots on hand and that was a wonderful addition. Like other reviewers, I found this a little salty and the dressing too thick, but I loved the roasted beets and walnuts. I would make this again with some tweaking.

Rating: 3
I followed other people's advice and kept the cheese out of the dressing to sprinkle it on top of the salad. It was a very nice and beautiful dish, but I made the mistake of roasting baby beets. NEVER do that because they're almost impossible to peel! The beets were o.k., but I preferred the dressing.

Rating: 3
This is a good recipe, but an easier and equally tasty way to have a roasted beet salad is to toss the chopped roasted beets with a thick vinaigrette of olive oil, balsamic, coarse ground mustard (more than you would think), fresh herbs (whatever you like, I used parsely / thyme / basil), and garlic. Toast the walnuts. Crumble bleu cheese and the walnuts over the beets and serve over the arugula (or just by itself).

Very nice. A little salty, though, I'll cut back next time. The walnuts really add an appreciated depth of flavor.

The beets came out great, and the mix of flavors was excellent. MY only regret was that the gorgonzola dressing was a little thicker than I would have liked. I may just crumble the gorgonzola over the salad next time.

Great recipe. I substituted boston lettuce for the arugula and the light color provided an excellent contrast with the dark beets.

Rating: 4
This salad was delicious AND easy!!! I did modify it a little, by not using the light cream. Also, I used lettuce from my garden. I topped the lettuce with the dressing (minus the cream & gorgonzola) layed the beets on top in a flower-like pattern, then topped that with gorgonzola. I will DEFINITELY make this again!!!

This is a fabulous recipe. I have always loved beets but this was really a great way to serve them. I substituted half of the Balsamic Vinegar with Fig Balsamic Vinegar (from Dean & DeLuca) and it made a big difference. Roasted beets are without doubt the ONLY way to eat them . They taste completely different. This is a keeper for sure.

Rating: 3
Wonderful and sinfully rich. But would I make it again? Probably not, since I already very often serve my salads with crumbled blue cheese and walnuts and a homemade balsamic vinaigrette which is much simpler to do, and also tastes very good. This is very nice though, and worth a try.

The table of 8 gave this dish a unanimous Thumbs Up! Everyone commented that they loved beets but never knew what to do with them, never had roasted them. If I were to make this dish again I, too, would chop the onion or sprinkle the ringed(or chopped) onion on the salad...taking advantage of the lovely color of the red onion.

My boyfriend and I both really love fresh beets but had never tried roasting them before. It was a huge hit. The dressing was fabulous, though we omitted the walnuts (we forgot to pick some up at the store). Instead of arugula, I sauteed the beet greens in a teaspoon of olive oil (using a non-stick skillet) and two teaspoons of minced garlic; I served the beets and dressing over the warm greens. It was really delicious. Next time, I will try arugula and I will add the toasted walnuts.

Delicious, impressive and absolutely beautiful plated. A keeper.

Do try this recipe; it's wonderful. I've used the dressing on other roasted vegetables, as a dip, a spread on crackers or just to satisfy that hormonal craving for comfort food. I prefer to chop the onion rather than leave it "stringy" and like the walnuts well drained before adding the other ingredients.

I all most didn't try this one but it is truly memorable.

The directions are hard to understand about whether to mix the walnuts with the cheese and cream. When I make this again, I would keep the cream, cheese and walnuts separate from the onion basil mixture. I would place the walnut mixture on the beets and garnish with the basil and onions. When you add the vinegar to the entire mixture it does not look too appetizing.
