Delicious, and well worth the time! I followed the recipe to the letter, using a charcoal grill, and the results could not have turned out better.

Great flavor and texture. I thought the Ancho Chile Sauce was a great accompaniment. This is a long process at home with so many good BBQ restaurants around!!

This is one incredibly delicious brisket - tender, moist and deeply flavored. An overnight stay with the rub allows the salt to act like a "dry" brine that help keeps the brisket moist and flavored to the core. The process is as crucial as the ingredients so follow the directions! You will not be disappointed

Made the brisket using the gas grill instructions - found it super easy and the temp was steady at 250degs with only one burner on. Took us maybe 15% longer timewise than the recipe said, but it was fuzz free and we didn't feel like we were babysitting the grill all day. Had a little incident of flaming wood chips - but that was solved by moving the chips away from the flame. We seasoned the meat with Goya Adobo first and then with the recipe mix. The meat turned out super flavorful with the perfect amount of smokiness - without being overpowering. Didn't make the ancho sauce - instead we used Jim N Nicks BBQ sauce. Will totally be making it again.

Did this on a gas grill as described, used hickory wood chips. was great meat but not sure the ancho chili sauce was value-added. seemed to overpower the smokiness of the meat. will do again but will try mesquite chips next.

We did this for July4th on "real" smoker with hickory chips. Got rave reviews, but we think we could have cooked it longer -- it was not fork tender. we cooked 3 hours plus 1 hour in foil. Internal temp was 195 when we took it off. next time we will bring meat to room temp before cooking and try 225 instead of 250 and not worry about "over cooking". The sauce is excellent. we will definitely try again.

Fantastic! I did it a bit different, didn't smoke it and cooked it in the oven instead at 325 for 4 hours. I was incredible. This is really so simple and yet tastes like delish.

This was my first time smoking anything so I was nervous but it turned out fantastic. Smoked a 5.65 lb. brisket on my weber kettle charcoal grill. I used a candy thermometer to read the temp (kept it around 225 - 250) and used mesquite wood chips and kingsford coals. I didn't use check in with the meat thermometer until about 6 or so hours in, and it registered at 185 degrees. Wrapped with foil for the last hour. It was so tender that I cut the meat with a fork! Unfortunately my dog stole the last third of the brisket off the countertop so no leftovers!

I did EVERYTHING exactly as directed and it never reached the internal temp of 190, despite and extra hour plus on the grill. It was not tender. What a lot of work for a huge disappointment.

While certainly daunting in appearance, this Barbecued Brisket is actually fairly easy to make. I made mine on a gas smoker and enjoyed a great meal. The key seemed to be using an instant- read thermometer and checking it often for proper internal tempetures. When smoking this, please remember the words of Ed Mitchell, "If you're lookin', you aren't cookin'."
