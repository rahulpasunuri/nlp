Wowzer! This is an EXCELLENT recipe. I have made this like a zillion times and I either use sharp Cheddar cheese or old Gouda.

I made this to bring to a dinner party and it was a huge hit. I followed the recipe almost to the tee. My only deviation was to add an extra slice of bacon and I used extra sharp cheese. One note, 20 minutes in the freezer was too long, it was hard as a rock. I had to let it sit for a while to roll it.

I've been making this recipe at Christmas every year for so many years I've lost count! We love it and look forward to it every year. When I first started making it, I didn't have a food processor, so I used my Kitchen Aid stand mixer instead. It winds up with little chunks of cheddar, and is not completely smooth. After I got a processor, I tried the recipe the correct way, but had become so used to the other, that I immediately went back!

We served this as a log rolled in the chopped pecans. It was enjoyed by all at the party.

My attempt at this came out very dry. I didn't like it at all.

I usually love cheese spreads, but the bacon in this recipe was way too strong and tasted quite strange. My husband, who loves bacon, liked it a little bit better than I.
