I made this with left-over poached salmon, but didn't have any smoked salmon on hand. It needs the smoked salmon. Without it, the flavor is a bit bland. It could also use a shake of worcestershire sauce.

Great party dip. I used 8 oz cream cheese, one 6 oz can RED salmon, juice of one lemon and added a little chopped red onion along with the smoked salmon.

This is great. I was pantry diving and found a pack of smoked salmon from a gift basket last Christmas. I originally thought I'd just put some on crackers with cream cheese and capers but when I opened the package, the piece of fish was so tiny, I decided to try a spread. Once again, Epicurious search did the trick! This worked great and I added the capers I had already rinsed. This is so good I'll intentionally buy the ingredients for it!

I have actually been making almost the same recipe for my son's lunches for a while (no horseradish, though). I use flax seed tortillas and turn it into a wrap. Also have used trout (cheap, local and comparable to salmon) instead. I use a lot more cream cheese, though, probably double, and add garlic stapes, which I grow, although chives or green onions would work as well. For a nutrition boost, I add some red peppers

I made this once again for a pre-Mardi Gras party and it was a hit again. People just can't get enough of it. This time I added more lemon juice and horseradish. I made it three days before the party so the flavors could meld. Thanks!

I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving. The crowd went wild! Even a young man who does not like salmon said it was very good. Next time I will add chopped scallions and more fresh lemon juice.Good appetizer recipe.

I thought this recipe was alright, although I used 8 oz. of smoked salmon (wild alaskan!) and I doubled the recommended for cream cheese. The horseradish really added a nice kick, though mix the other ingredients first, then add the horseradish to your own taste. Other than that, this recipe was quick, easy, and delicious!

I tried substituting 8 ounces of nova lox bits for the flaked salmon and the lox. It turned out kind of salty. Well, duh. The horseradish is a good addition to this 'pink schmear' recipe -- next time I might throw in a bit more. Oh, and next time I'll be smart and use the cooked salmon and just the 4 oz. smoked salmon as directed.

Delicious. I used freshly smoked salmon and subsituted wasabi for the horseradish since that was what I had on hand. Served it wih fresh vegies as well as the baguette....cherry tomatoes, cucumber, celery, and carrots. There were no leftovers.

I made this with wasabi because I had no horseradish. I made it into a roll and wrapped smoked salmon round it and then cut it. Will add a bit more lemon next time

Dish was licked clean !!! Easy easy easy. I used all leftover from night before -no smoked salmon available - and extra lemon. Yummy !! Had to add horseradish at the party house that was the key ingridient here.

I made this for a party. Guests loved it and licked the bowl. I'm not a big fan of salmon so I'm rating it on their comments. Easy to make. Use a good quality canned salmon and 4 ozs of smoked salmon so it's not expensive either. If you like salmon, try this.

Instead of cream cheese, neufatchel cheese was used. I honestly could not stop eating it!

I have to admit, I too altered this recipe with stunning results. I used smoked trout in place of the salmon and used lemon zest in place of the juice. Everyone raved about it - its perfect for a special celebration such as a Christmas or New Years.

This was great made with canned salmon (the kind that looks like a tuna can). The only addition I made was to add 1/2 tsp. liquid smoke or more to taste. YUM.

I left out the fresh salmon,added 1/2 cup of sour cream,1/2 teaspoon kosher salt,1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and did it all in the Food processor! So easy, and so yummy!!

As a low carb, low fat alternative I added capers and spread on endive leaves. My guests loved it, this plate was the first to be empty.

This recipe is just too simple to be so good! I made this for a quick addition to coctail appetizers, and got rave reviews from my guests. I don't know if this made it better or not, but I did buy fresh salmon and cook it myself. A definite keeper!

Very good and easy. Added capers and more lemon juice. I used fresh poached salmon and high quality smoked salmon; -will be great on bagels in the morning, if there is any leftover.

This recipe gets rave reviews everytime I make it. I do modify it a little by adding chopped capers and a few drops of liquid smoke to make the smoky flavor stand out. Very good as an appetizer spread on baguette slices and topped with a slice of roasted red pepper too.

I have made this numerous times since it first appeared in the magazine. It always gets rave reviews. I buy the smoked salmon which looks like a salmon filet on a carboard backing and clear plastic front. It is much more intense in flavor than the sliced smoked salmon you usually see. I also warm the lemon in the oven a little before extracting the juice. I find it brings out the flavor of the lemon much more. I will be making again very soon. Very simple and very tasty. I sometimes spread it on sliced smoke salmon and roll it up into a salmon roulade.

I was looking for a good recipe to use in my brain mold for a Halloween party, so I tripled the recipe. The pinkish-greyish color was perfect, and despite the ghoulish appearance, it tasted great. I thought the original recipe was a little on the bland side, so I added a little more horseradish, a couple of dashes of red and black pepper, and a tablespoon of lemon zest. Also, I disolved an envelope of gelatin in 1/4 cup of water and added it so that the brain would hold it's shape.

I made this two days ago for the first time and served it to guests. Not having smoked salmon on hand, I used fresh, poached salmon only, and neufchatel cheese. I doubled the recipe, but there were still no leftovers. Tomorrow I'm making it again to take to a work-related function. The recipe is fast, easy and delicious--a real keeper!

I made this for a party and got rave reviews. The fresh dill makes all the difference, as does a good smoked salmon. I served it in a hollowed-out pumpernickel loaf with baguette crisps!

This was a really good spread! I served it along with pate and an eggplant-tomato topping for crostinis, and tzatziki with veggies. I did make a few changes as I didn't have all of the ingredients at home. I used all canned salmon, substituted sweet hot mustard for the horseradish, and added some capers. Overall, a very pleasing spread!

Added chopped green onion & lots of black pepper. It was a smash hit! I took one look at how much it made, thought of who would be coming & promptly doubled the recipe. Good thing I did! I can see where this would be wonderful with soy sauce instead of the horseradish for an appetizer before an Asian meal.

Although this recipe was real easy to make it was way too bland.I thought the horseradish would give it a kick....not.There are better things to do with salmon.

This is perfect with a glass of champagne as an appetizer. And best of all, it's quick and easy to whip up after you've spent the day making the main course and dessert...

Very yummy!!! I didnt follow the recipe exactly and it turned out great. Used only canned smoked salmon and hot pepper sauce instead of horse raddish for flavour!! Served it at a tea party. It was a hit!!

i made this for a st. patrick's day party and it was a big hit- served it with cocktail pumpernickle bread garnished with extra dill. The horseradish definately gives it a nice kick.

I would recommend this to anyone. The only thing i would change, would be less horseradish.

I've been searching for a similar recipe which came with a package of smoked salmon I purchased at Nordstrom. This one is pretty close. My other recipe called for a dash of tabasco sauce and green onion instead of the horseradish, which I liked also.

I agree it needed a little more zing and worcestershire sauce did add some depth to the flavor. Nice no-bake appetizer option when the turkey is taking up the entire oven.

I've made a variation of this for years. I combine all, chill for an hour and make a roll (6-8 inches long). Chill in waxed paper overnight, roll in black pepper. Serve with crostini or melba toast. Marvelous.

This is a definite keeper. It is easy to make and delicious. Definitely plan on making ahead of time. Otherwise the horseradish is overwhelming. The color of the red salmon and lox gives this spread a lot of color. I recently made it using a 15 oz. can of pink salmon-not the same, but much less expensive. The color was quite bland, so I added some cocktail sauce. After a few hours, the horseradish had blended some, but it would have been better if it had had more blending time. I'd recommend overnight.

I make this all the time during Football season and it's a HUGE success. However, I use a little soy sauce and chopped red onion in lieu of the horseradish and lemon juice. Serve with crackers and sourdough bread chunks - AWESOME! I've also found that it's better if you make it a day in advance and refrigerate it. It gives the flavors a chance to meld.

This is a great appetizer. However, worcestshire sp?) sauce is good to add to the mix minus whatever sauce the recipe asks for. However, a good addition is to roll the salmon dip into a ball and then roll it into crushed walnuts and serve with crackers. Very good
