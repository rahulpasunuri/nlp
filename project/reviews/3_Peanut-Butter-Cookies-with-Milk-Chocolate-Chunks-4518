I had to change things based on what I had and I have a few suggestions. I substituted 1/4 cup flour for the oats. If I had oats, I would put them in the food processor and grind them down to a flour consistency to eliminate the texture. I like smooth pb cookies. Also, I used smooth peanut butter - trader joes unsalted creamy -very easy to measure when using a new jar. I also eliminated the nuts. For the chocolate, I used Trader Joes peanut butter cups. I chopped them coarsely (mainly into fourths) and mixed them into the dough. After forming the cookies, as they tell you do do here (they make yummy giant cookies) press a full peanut butter cup into the top of each cookie. Then freeze the pan of cookies for 10 minutes (make sure you are not baking on a cookie stone as the stone will crack going from freezer to oven). I baked the cookes at 350 degrees for 13 minutes and they come out almost cooked. Leave them on the pan to cool before moving to a rack. They will be deliciously chewy even when cooled.

These are rich and good. Skipped the peanuts because I had none, used natural peanut butter and semisweet chips. Made way more than they said--about 40--and I used a slightly rounded measured tablespoon.

After reading the reviews I was expecting something fabulous! What I got was a regular old cookie with a bunch of stuff in it. With the oats, the peanuts, the chocolate... there wasn't anything that stood out. Next time I'll just make the good old peanut butter cookies.

After reading the reviews I was expecting something fabulous. What I got was just a regular old cookie. These had too many ingredients, nothing stood out. They would have been much better without the peanuts. Next time I'll stick to just plain old peanut butter cookies!

Very good, peanut-buttery cookies and the oats add a nice texture. I did make a couple of modifications: didn't use the peanuts (and didn't miss them in the finiashed product!) and I used semi-sweet chunks instead of milk chocolate. Even so, these cookies are pretty sweet - I think next time I'll stick with the semi-sweet, but use chips (smaller) and use less - maybe just 6 ounces.

These are great. I found them to be a little greasy, but if you're a peanut butter and chocolate lover, try 'em! They went over very well at the last picnic.

A really wonderful cookie. They are chewy, crunchy, and creamy all at the same time! Perfect with a cold glass of milk. I might try them with semi-sweet chocolate next time to cut the sweetness.

Great cookie recipe! I didn't have the nuts but no problem as they tasted just great. The freezing of the dough is just what's needed to bake perfectly round cookies.

These rock. Underdone they are nice and chewy, which my kids like, but I prefer them crisp. Used smooth peanut butter and omittted nuts and they were still great. For a change of pace we also like semisweet minichips...

I have been making these cookies for years. I have always received outstanding praise for them. They are not as easy as a typical choc. chip cookie, but worth the extra effort. They can be a little pricy to make if you don't have a well stocked kitchen. I generally make them 1 or 2X's a year. They are phenominal and worth any extra effort required.

An experment that went right! Once I started making the cookies, I realized I didn't have any peanuts, to I subsituted toasted peacan about 1 cup, and used carob ship instead of Milk Chocolate. WOW !!! the dough taste great, but when they were cooked the flavour was amazing. A couple of tips chill the dough for 30 minutes after making them, and let them rest on the cookie sheet for 10 minutes after there baked ..

I loved these. I only used one heaping tablespoon of dough per cookie, but otherwise followed to a T. Really good, chewy and irresistable.

These cookies got rave reviews from the folks at work. But, the dough was very hard to shape into balls. The chocolate chunks and peanuts kept falling out of the dough. They ended up being lots of trouble.

They were a hit at my party! However they went to fast. Next time I will have to make a bunch more! Just make sure you cook them only to a point where they are barly cooked. Then take them out and let them sit untill you can get them off the sheet. Then they are really chewy. If you like crunchy, cook them the whole time. I did both and I like the chewy best!!

These are very good cookies! I did substitute quick cooking oats for the old-fashioned oats. I'm not a great peanut butter lover, but these cookies won me over!

I made these cookies for my kids and they loved them!! I myself don't really like peanut butter cookies but I did like these. They didn't taste too peanut-buttery. I used creamy peanut butter rather than chunky. I am definately going to add this to my list of favorites.

YUCK! Followed the recipe to the T, they were hard as bricks, and tasteless to boot. Don't waste your time or your chocolate on this one.
