I altered this recipe after reading the reviews. I used only 1/4 tsp salt, and used 1/4 c plus 1 Tbsp each of butter and applesauce. I used the brown sugar as specified, but used Sucralose instead of the white sugar. I also added 1 tsp of coconut extract, which was definitely needed. If I had it to do over I'd add 2 lemons worth of lemon zest, and possibly some orange blossom water or almond extract. It needed more coconut than I used, perhaps even 2 tsp.

The taste is delicious.. but the cookie is too crumbly!

I didn't get anywhere close to 100 cookies - more like 30, and I used a cookie dough scoop for them. I took into account some of the previous reviews, and added 1.5 tsp of lemon extract, 1 tsp of lemon zest and 1 tsp of fresh lemon juice to give it a kick. I also added about 4 ounces of chopped white chocolate to half the batter, as I did not know how it would taste. The white chocolate was such a good addition with the lemon and coconut. They really complemented the other flavors. I think next time I might try putting the shredded coconut in the food processor and adding 1/2 cup more flour so the cookie comes out a little thicker and with a better consistency. Overall though a pretty good cookie.

It may have been because I did not allow them to cook sufficiently, but I mostly got a cookie jar full of crumbs. Tasty crumbs, though. Makes about 50 small cookies.

I made these cookies as directed along with several other types and they were a hit at my son's wedding! I just made them a second time and forgot to toast the coconut and I substituted coconut flaver for the vanilla. They are a bit moist and are delicious! My favorite cookie of the moment!

I substituted 1/4 t almond extract for the vanilla and since I used salted butter I omitted the salt. Recipe yield was half the indicated amount but cookies were a 'normal size' of 2.5 inches. These would be great with lemon juice and zest instead of almond or vanilla. I am thinking next time about using toasted coconut ribbons (sold at Trader Joe's stores) for a bigger coconut taste than the toasted flake.

Three and a half forks is good... can be further perfected...however, that being said, I added coconut extract and chips and these cookies were really great - a nice variation from the usual choc chip or oatmeal cookie - really nice soft or hard.

I took the advice, and added 1 tsp almond extract in addition to the vanilla. The first batch cooked too quickly at 375, so I turned the oven down to 350 and the next came out much better. Definitely don't let them overcook. Used slightly less baking soda & salt. Since it was for a holiday party, I pushed one-quarter of a maraschino cherry on top. Looked very festive.... a good cookie, not outstanding, but I'll probably make it again.

This is a great favorite...had to make a second recipe the week after I first tried it. Butterscotch in flavor, nutty, and easy.

I followed the recipe, except I substituted 1 teaspoon of coconut extract for the vanilla. I toasted the coconut fairly dark, so the cookies did have a nice color. I only got 36 cookies, not 100. I guess I I used a heaping teaspoon!

I love this forum for the other cook's reviews alone. This prompted me to adjust the recipe a little and got fantastic results. I read the recipe carefully and was a little confused at the baking SODA with no acid or real liquid to balance it's effects so I substitued the same amount in baking powder and used just a pinch of salt. I also took other cook's advice and used more coconut ( I used 1 2/3 cups) and if you can keep from nibbling the toasted coconut, that works well too. The only other thing I'd try in future is some sort of extra ingredient to bring colour to the cookie. They are a wonderful taste but they just kind of sit there and don't seem to say " TRY ME!!" I considered rolling them in a little of the extra toasted coconut or something but will save that for next time. I also considered for next time, cutting back on the 2 Tbsp of butter and using coconut cream instead to intensify the coconut taste. Happy baking, whatever you choose to do!

Simple and tasty - great for my son's friend who doesn't like chocolate!! Following some of the suggestions I reduced the amount of salt by half, added extra toasted coconut and very carefully measured the baking soda. Sized them with a small ice cream scoop (holds about a teaspoon) and they were beautiful rounds approx 3 inches in diameter.(not 100 as stated-but a reasonable number) They would make a great ice cream sandwich cookie as suggested

I made this recipe exactly as given. Turned out great. Everyone at work loved them. I thought a little more coconut would have been even better.

These cookies have a great texture, and they are tasty, although I do agree that the salty/soda-y flavor stands out just a little too much. Next time I may try making them with less soda, less salt, or with baking poweder and see what happens.

Just made these cookies and they came out fine. Super easy to make so that's a plus, but not the best coconut cookie ever. I used a 7 oz. pkg. of coconut (equal to 2 1/3 cups loosely packed coconut). A great tea cookie.

I made these cookies and they tasted so bad that I thought I did something wrong so I made them again. The second time I made them they tasted just as bad. They were flat and tasted like baking soda. I will never make these cookies again and don't recommend this recipe.

Positively Stupendous... As to the below reviewer.... perhaps shw measured incorrectly because there was no problems with the baking powder at all in my experience... these were gone almost before the holidays... a true winner...

I hate to be a dissenting reviewer, but I can not agree with the accolades given to these cookies. They tasted very heavily of baking soda, which is not the way I like a cookie to taste.

Very Yummy! I added 1 cup of mini chips, 1 tsp almond extract, and made them as bar cookies instead of drop. Came out fantastic!

These cookies are addictive! I made them for a large group, and there was not one left! The recipe is easy to double. No problems with the ingredients or directions, and it takes no time at all to bake a huge batch. I will certainly make these again.

I made this cookie for an ice cream social at work. Several of my co-workers made ice cream sandwiches with them. This lovely cookie is easy to make and delicious. I would heartily recommend it with the caveat that the recipe says it will make 100 cookies, and even when I made them very small (1" in diameter) it didn't even come close to making that many. I think I only got about 48 cookies from one recipe.

YUMMM!! These easy to make cookies are absolutely delicious!! They are perfectly soft yet with a slight crunch to them- just the way a cookie should be. The coconut was just the right amount and did not overpower the taste. I dyed my coconut pink for Easter and shaped them into eggs, they looked great. Try this recipe, you'll be amazed!

My boyfriend LOVED this cookie; said it was the best cookie I've made. I'm going to try it with dark chocolate and toasted almonds next.

These cookies are the BEST cookies I have ever had. But they are an even match with my secret cookies that I make. Follow the recipe exactly as follows and they turn out great. They are hard to over cook because when they are darker they are more toasty and crunchy. When they are light they are more soft and gooey. My batch only make 15 cookies i used ping pong size balls of dough so be prepared to double or triple your ingredients and batch if your feeding the masses. Did I mention these cookies ROCKED!

Wonderful cookies! I added a few chocolate chips for an additional taste. Be very careful not to overbake. Huge smash at work!

It is very difficult to find a really great coconut cookie and this one fits the bill for me. Good texture. Make sure that the flour, soda and salt are sifted very well. Easy to make and even easier to eat.

I used unsweetened coconut for this recipe. My boyfriend had a thoughtful look upon his face as we shared the first crispy cookie...we cannot figure out if it was the unsweetened coconut that gives the cookie a slightly bitter taste, or perhaps the baking soda, as I halved the recipe... I put chocolate chips in half the recipe - I love them, despite the funny taste....

Good. Slight coconut flavor, but nothing overwhleming. I couldn't even taste the coconut until the middle of a bite. Again, this recipe only makes about 3 dozen cookies.

Has a wonderful almost oatmeal-cookie taste, but for anyone who likes coconut at all, it's a must! Easy to make and tastes wonderful!

This is a very simple, very yummy cookie, that came out perfectly! It took virtually no time to make and the baking time is minimal. I got 3 dozen cookies out of it, and they are all fairly small--the dough doesn't spread all that much (a teaspoon dollop will spread to about 1.5-2 inches in diameter), so you can fit more than 12 on a cookie sheet at a time. For the last dozen, i mixed in a bunch of dried cranberries (probably about 3/4 a cup or so), which add a nice flavor (even though cranberry and coconut doesn't often go together!). As others have said, there's room for a lot of variation for flavors here (citrus peel, almond extract, etc.) i wonder how it would be with pineapple extract! a pina colada cookie!

These turned out really good. The first batch I made I baked for 8 minutes exactly and they came out perfect... a little crispy on the edges and soft in the inside. I will definitely make these again.

I've made these cookies a few times, and they always seem to disappear. Everyone who has tried them has loved them, even my brother, who hates almost everything(tomatoes, mushrooms, nuts, coconut, etc). Further more they are fairly simple to make and most people would already have the ingredients.

Loved the taste of these cookies. Very flat and crisp tasting - not soft at all. A coconut lover's dream. I think to say that you can get 100 cookies out of this recipe is REALLY stretching it. All I could get was about 2 1/2 dozen - unless you want them the size of an M&M with peanuts.

I didn't have unsalted butter on hand so I used regular butter and it turned out fine. I also used a bit of orange peel. The cookies came out nice and crunchy from the toasted coconut. I would definitely make again and use other fruity peels such as lemon..

This was a delicious cookie recipe. I was out of vanilla extract, so I used almond. It gave it an extra-nutty flavor. A big hit with my friends! A good use of excess coconut flakes!

We love these cookies! I'm not much of a sweets person, but these are great!

I prefer a sweeter cookie. It only made less that three dozen cookies. The receipe calls for 1 1/2 cups coconut, which is much less than 12 oz. of coconut, so it could be that I did not use enough coconut.

This recipe was quick and easy to prepare, delicious to eat and kept well in a plastic container for several weeks. The cookies are a real treat with fresh fruit or ice cream and a real bonus to have in the freezer for unexpected guests!
