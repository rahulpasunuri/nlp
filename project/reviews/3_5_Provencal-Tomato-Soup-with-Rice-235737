Fabulous soup! I hadn't before realized what an affinity tomatoes and oranges have. I made a few changes - added chicken breast and chopped fennel bulb because I didn't have fennel seeds. Instead of orange strips I grated the zest of an orange, and had to use dried thyme and basil. It was still delicious and I'm sure fresh basil would have made it even better.

Excellent! I doubled for a large dinner party and made some changes after reading some of the reviews. Used 5 orange zest strips but did not chop and removed them at the end with the bay leaf. Since this was for a gourmet dinner party I pureed the whole batch and after tasting decided not to add the rice. This was a fabulous soup and would definitely make again.

this soup is not a disappointment and I used good quality canned fire roasted tomatoes rather than fresh. It was very clean and bright. would definitely make again

Outstanding- I used home grown ripe tomatoes , and did not change a thing on the recipe. Complex flavors... saffron & orange zest are key components. Made half a recipe due to my tomato supply... sorry that I don't have any leftovers!

i actually used good quality canned tomatoes and some leftover brown rice. this entire soup came together so quickly and it definitely tastes like Provence. It is absolutely lovely. would serve this to company.

Yummy and relatively quick, healthy soup. I added it to it by stewing down a whole chicken with half an onion and salt and pepper. Cooled the chicken, pulled off and cubed the meat, while I cooked the soup as directed. I think the chicken was a yummy, hearty addition. Also, I cheated to save time and used quality fire-roasted stewed tomatoes (two 16oz cans). Made for a very rich base and warm tummy on a cold rainy night. Will definitely make again.

This soup is exceptional! Very provencal with the onions and herbs. I don't see how anyone would rate it as "dreadful" or bland. I omitted the orange zest and used only half the water, and about one quarter of the recommended crushed red pepper flakes. I used basmati rice. Otherwise, following the proportions exactly cooked as a double sized batch. My wife said it was the best soup she ever tasted! I agree.

A solidly good soup. Nothing crazy out of the ordinary and lots of room to add other ingredients. Great way to use end of summer basil and tomatoes.

I didn't have the orange zest to add but thought this soup was very tasty. Perhaps the flavor depends on the tomatoes and I had some fresh from the garden Amish paste tomatoes. I think it only makes 4 servings but we were hungry. I'll definitely make again.

I read the reviews for this recipe prior to trying. I omitted much of the orange peel as well as 1 cup of the water. I also sauteed the vegetables considerably longer than 5 minutes. Once the liquids and tomatoes were added I then let it simmer for several hours prior to adding the rice. I also hit it with the immersion blender for smoother texture, again prior to adding the rice. It turned out to be quite tasty and something I will make again when trying to use all the summer tomatoes!

Dreadful! For once, I actually followed the recipe, decreasing the orange zest as suggested by many. I do think that it would support the bag of mixed frozen seafood, as suggested. I'll have to pick some up because i can't eat this but won't throw food away!

Oh gosh, we really couldn't eat this. Bland and thin to our taste. tried blending more and letting sit a few days but still bleh. I must not be a orange zest and saffron provencal sort of gal.

Excellent! I made it vegetarian with an onion/celery/garlic/ bay leaf broth. It simmered for a few hours; served it over steamed rice because I did not want the rice to absorb all of the liquid. It would be delicious with tapenade toasts as well!

My husband and I both thought this was tasty. I omitted the rice and the water, and used about half the amount of orange zest. I also hit the soup with an immersion blender. The texture was no thicker than commercial tomato soup. I imagine that with the water and rice added, it is a very broth-y soup. In the freezer section of Trader Joe's they sell a bag of mixed seafood - small shrimp, scallops and squid. I bet this soup would be delicious with something like that added at the end!

Very tasty. I made 3x the amount and only used 1x the orange zest which was still very prominent. I also boiled it down a little more to concentrate the flavors.

I would like to give this recipe 3 1/2 forks, because I thought that it was delicious. It has a wonderful depth and complexity of flavor, and it's healthy, too. I used a little less orange (per suggestions), and I agree that you could maybe cut back on the onions, as well. My soup came out very onion-y, which is fine because I like onions, but I might cut the slices in half next time. I used brown rice and thought that it worked okay, but with any rice, I think you'll have to cook the soup for more than 20 minutes after adding it. Next time I'll make a double batch so that I have some to freeze.

I've made this twice. I love the unusual flavor the orange and saffron adds, however I did cut the orange peel way back the second time. Also, the first time I made it I ran it through the blender because I wanted a much smoother soup. Finally, I found that I needed to cook it much longer in order to get the vegetables as soft as I wanted.

I found this recipe very labor intensive for a relative small payoff. Nice flavor, but not worth the time.

As the other reviewer pointed out, go easy on the orange peel. Just one or two short zest peels (about an 1.5 inches long) is sufficient. It's important to use hot chiles, because it really enhances the sweetness of the tomatoes. The next step is to use brown rice with this one. Haven't done it yet, but will probably use much less brown rice than white.

Very good soup. Served it with a baguette.

Very good tomato soup. Very refreshing and unorthodox. Go easy on the Orange peels, the taste takes over, so take caution if you're not a big fan. Used fresh chillies (about half) - great result, but could use some more. It's best fresh - the rice soaks too much liquid, so making this a day in advance is not a good idea.

Excellent recipe. I used the last early girl tomatoes of the season--a sort of homage to the summer/autumn transition. Wonderful soup, I will make this recipe again. I love the kick of the red pepper against the backdrop of thyme and saffron.

Great Recipe. I used Roma tomatoes and roasted them as suggested by another cook. I used only 1 onion and used 1 very thinly sliced fresh fennel. I also used 3 cups of chicken broth and 1 3/4 cups of water and added 1/2 cup of grated pecorino cheese at the end. Fabulous and better made the day before serving.

I have more tomatoes this year than I know what to do with and I was looking for a new soup recipe. I've already made about 8 of them this year. The refreshing difference of orange zest and saffron in this soup made it a winner. I will definitely make it again.

This recipe is awesome. I made only one change, which was that I opted not to blanche/peel the tomatoes. I used small organic romas and their skins are barely noticeable. I seldom peel tomatoes anyway. For onions I chose to use Vidalias because I'm not overly fond of most other onions in large quantity. I didn't want the soup to be too onion-y. I'll definitely make this again, its a great early autumn soup to make while tomatoes are still good.

Excellent soup - made it vegetarian by subbing veg broth for chicken. Used roasted tomatoes insstead of the method outlined in recipe. Very nice.
