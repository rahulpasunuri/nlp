We made this for gourmet club last night to raves~ did not change a thing and loved it. Our theme was beer, and the Hoegaarden was wonderful to cook with and to taste!

Delicious simple weeknight meal that still feels like you made something special. Felt the dish was a bit under seasoned. Will consider adding a pinch of salt next time.

This was my first time making mussels, and not only was this delicious, but incredibly easy. I didn't have any scallions, so I used shallots and extra chives instead. I also left out the chervil and it was still very flavorful. Using fresh herbs is a must. Highly recommended!

Don't let the other reviews fool you... this recipe is DELICIOUS. The broth is quite flavorful and the creme fraiche gives it a yummy, slightly creamy consistency. We didn't have chervil on hand and didn't feel like the recipe was missing a thing.

My husband says I should give this 5 forks. Delicious! Made recipe exactly as stated and it was exceptional. I doubled the crouton part . . . I've never heard anyone complain about too many croutons!!!

I agree with A cook from Hollywood. This recipe was simple and delicious! I made it for 2 friends, and they both thought it was scrumptious. The best part was soaking the croutons in the broth...divine.

Wow ! What an incredible recipe. It was a huge hit at our monthly "Bon Appetit" dinner with 3 other couples.This will be my "go to" recipe whenever I want to make mussels.

Recipe was disappointing. Bland tasting. Needs something to spice it up.
