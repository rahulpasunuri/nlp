Love this one...have made it countless times with that many raves and requests for the recipe!

I love the idea of the finger salad for company. As far as the dressing, this was one of those recipes that, to my taste, just "needed something." I added a bit more garlic, lemon, salt and pepper but didn't quite achieve the result I was looking for. When I make this again, will substitute bacon for the anchovies, with apologies to Caesar.

This is such an amazing dressing! My kids love it, and whenever we have parties we make this one!! I always make this recipe with out the anchovies! It is sooooo good

Delicious dressing. I used organic mayo and left out anchovies only because I didn't have them, but it didn't seem to detract from the flavor. I've made Caesar dressing with eggs, but prefer this version much more. Highly recommend.

Wonderful! I also added 2 cloves of garlic. Everyone loved it!!!

The dressing is just amazing! I made this salad as a quick dinner for one by just dividing everything in half, and it was perfect! I also left out the anchovy because I am vegetarian and this was an awesome alternative Caesar salad to the normal salads that contain the anchovies that I cannot eat! Will definetly continue to make!

The best Caesar dressing. Always get great compliments. I use Anchovie paste instead of the canned fish, which is very tasty & convenient.

This creamy caesar dressing is very good. Sprinkled parm on salad rather than added to dressing. Served on standard romaine lettuce as a regular salad. Nice option to other caesars!

I was looking for an eggless caesar salad for a crowd, and this was just fabulous. I used the dressing recipe and made a giant salad with croutons, and the guests devoured every last morsel. This one is a keeper.

Tasted perfect. I am so happy to have a caesar salad dressing that tastes right but does not include raw eggs. Make it- you won't be sorry.

Terrific "eggless" dressing! The very best Caesar Salad I've ever made!

Good caesar dressing. I felt that the recipe made enough for four servings. Will make it again.

If you're concerned about the usualraw egg in caesar dressing, this is the recipe for you. What an outstanding dressing this is. It is now my favorite. Simple, delicious salad.

It's okay dressing but not knock your socks off. I think this recipe is overhyped on this site! The crouton were however AMAZINGLY good

Simple caesar dressing. I followed recipe only doubled it for four servings, served it with a bunch of tossed romaine in salad bowl instead of individual servings and added 1/2 a chicken breast on top of each salad for more substance. I particularly enjoyed it because it didn't have as harsh a flavor as the caesars you find in a restaurant. It was a bit more mild, not such a strong taste in your mouth. My guests enjoyed it as well.

I have made this many times -- It's the best dressing ever and not just for romaine -- Like other here, I add more anchovies, about 6. The dressing keeps well. Every time I make this my guest just RAVE about it.

I was looking for a Caesar salad recipe that did not call for an egg. This is it. Very good.

Rating: 4
Great. I tore the lettuce and tossed in dressing. Used 3-4 anchovies (half the tin) for more zing. Of course if you are not a huge fan of the anchovy use 1. Used my own crouton recipe. Makes enough for 2 big salads or 3-4 small.

I've made this a few times now and I just love it every time! I use the capers wrapped in anchovies to give it that little extra something but otherwise there is no reason to change a thing!

I just found out that I wasn't supposed to use the whole can of anchovies Whoops!!! but guess what! it was FAB!

Loves it! Loved it! Loved it! mayed to have it like a salad and finger food, either way it was good, but I have a question, did anybody drain the oil from the anchovies, or did you mash it all together, I did the together! was I supposed to?

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious! I used anchovy paste, as it's what was on hand. I did not make as "finger" salads, but would like to try this way when entertaining. I agree with another reviewer to not add the parmesan to the dressing due to the lumpy texture. I'm sure it would be delicious either way!

Sooo easy and flavorful. I made this with anchovy paste and didn't mentioned it to the 14 guests at dinner. No one was the wiser and all had rave reviews. A definite keeper!

Scrumptious!!! Made it for my family and was very satisfied. Liked it so much that the following week, made it for a dinner party - my guests couldn't get enough!!! We just made the dressing and wouldn't change a thing!

delicious! i've only tried doing a caesar once before, and i made a huge boo boo that turned me off this salad. i used exrra virgin olive oil, and added extra garlic for some kick. marinated some chicken fillets in the dressing (i was making dinner for two so i had plenty left over) and grilled them for some protein. yummy!

Terrific dressing. I have never made my own caesar salad dressing before - always just used the Cardini brand and was always happy with it. Not any more. This dressing is so easy to make and is worlds above any commercial product. The depth of flavor and freshness can't be beat. The best!

I have made this recipe, and actually used it in my cooking classes. Why? Because for a minimum of effort, it delivers. Forgetting all the frou-frou of making croutins and all, just make the dressing...after all, that is the main event.

Rating: 4
I used this recipe for the dressing only. I didn't do the "finger salad" version. The dressing is fantastic and just the flavor I was searching for. Would recommend not adding the Parmesan until you've tossed the dressing with the romaine pieces. Putting it IN the dressing on my first try made a gloppy consistency.

the dressing is fantastic, but so are the crutons. yum!

Terrific dressing.

Excellent flavor, perfect consistency, and easy! Just shook everything in a jar. Used one T. mayo, and oops - had no anchovy but didn't miss it. Used garlic from the crouton oil for the dressing. Best caesar dressing I've found - as good as our favorite restaurant version.

I revise my review of last year after making this last night using the food processor. Don't do it! The consistency was all wrong, presumably the intensity and speed of the processor caused the mayo to separate from the olive oil, unlike the delicate blending of a small wire whisk. That aside, this dressing has become my standard Caesar recipe.

Rating: 4
DELICIOUS!! I made this for the first time last night and it definitely lives up to all the rave reviews. I used the dressing recipe and didn't do the finger salads. I also didn't have any whole anchovies so I used paste - doubled the dressing recipe and used a full teaspoon of paste. I usually dislike creamy Caesar dressings because they taste too strongly of mayo. But this was the perfect amount. This is my new stand by recipe for Caesar salad!

I love this dressing... my new standard for Caesar, esp. since being pregnant, can't have the raw egg. Usually throw in another anchovy or two because I love them :) I usually don't eat this in 'finger' form, but tear romaine in large pieces and serve with chicken. Very easy, tasty and quick.

This is definitely my caesar dressing of choice. I've never done the "finger salad" bit, and I usually don't make my own croutons. Neverthess, I've knocked the socks off my guests by simply chopping up a few romaine hearts, tossing with this dressing, mixing in some store-bought croutons, and topping with freshly cracked black pepper and a bit more fresh parmesean cheese. (When I make this salad for larger groups, I double the recipe. And, when doing so, I usually add a third anchovy fillet for good measure.) I simply throw everthing but the olive oil into my food processor and process well. I then slowly add the extra virgin olive oil for a nice, smooth emulsion. This makes for a relatively simple, yet perfect caesar salad. A little dressing goes a long way, too. Invite some friends over, open a few bottles of red wine, throw some steaks on the grill, serve this salad, and have someone else bring the dessert. Minimum effort, extraordinary results. Yum.

I loved this salad--as did everyone I served it to. Instead of using a whole anchovy and then chopping it up, I used Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce. This "Original" worcestershire sauce, unlike some others, has anchovies already in the sauce. It saved money and time and was excellent.

Just use the blender. Put everything in except the olive oil. Blend then gradually add the oil. This is very good.

Dressing is fantastic. Used it with chicken for a bigger heartier salad for lunch, and loved it just the same. Using not-all-the-way-boiled eggs on salad always freaked me out anyway...

Rating: 3
A keeper. Definitely easy and incredibly yummy. Can't quite tell the difference without the egg, so I'll go with the flow and use mayo from now on. Added a little more lemon juice and worcesteshire to taste.

The first time I made this I did it as written. very fun, but not for everyday. But the salad dressing, HOLY HANNA! I love that stuff! I can't stop eating it. It sits in the refrigerator calling my name and I must heed it's siren song.

I enjoyed the concept of finger ceasar salad for a romantic dinner but I found the dressing far too greasy and thick -- particularly as a prelude to a kiss. If, as I do, you think mayo naff, better to use a more traditional ceasar base of yokes, garlic, anchovies, cheese and E.V.O.O. for your hearts of romaine. The tomatoes cut right through it just as nicely and, tossed up with some toasted pine nuts, it feels absolutely as fresh and modern as it did when Cardini first dished it up for his pals.

A friend described this as the best Caesar salad he had ever had! I loved this one, because it tastes so great, so fresh, and is so easy to make. I also have used Anchovy paste and it was fine. Thanks!

My husband and really enjoyed thi recipe. The dressing is not real tart/strong as some are. We didn't do the 'finger' eating method. Any way you choose to eat it, it's good.

Delicious! The addition of cherry tomatoes to a Caesar makes a world of difference. I also enjoyed eating with my fingers. How wonderfully hedonistic! My wife used a knife and fork and still enjoyed it.

Very good recipe. Goes wonderfully with the whole Valentines dinner that was suggested in the Feb. issue. Yum!
