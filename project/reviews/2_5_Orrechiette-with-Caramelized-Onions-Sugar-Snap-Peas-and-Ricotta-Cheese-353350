Made this last night and thought it was pretty good! I mostly followed the recepie making sure to season everything! I added a little white wine to the onions when they were done caramelizing which I think helped my sauce. Good for meatless Mondays!

Used only the listed ingredients, but in my own proportions. I also used a lot of salt, carmelized the onions until almost burnt, and didn't add cooking liquid (I just mixed in spoonfuls of ricotta). I also threw in some raw snap peas, zest, and basil for more flavor. Very springy and light. I liked it, but it sounds like the original recipe was lacking.

I have made this recipe 4 or 5 times, and each time I do, it gets better. The whole secret, I have discovered, is getting the onions cooked to just the right color...dark brown, like one step away from burned. I use one whole onion and chop it small...the onions create a caramel that when you drop the pasta in, it covers the pasta and deglazes the pan with the wet pasta, THEN add your pasta water and ricotta. For me? It's a keeper.

I actually thought this dish was very good. I added a box of Grilled Perdue Shortcuts (cut into 1 in pieces) to make it more of a filling meal. Also, I only used about 1 1/2 cups of onions and I would lose the lemon. It was good to me, but it can be very strong so people who are't as crazy about lemon might not approve. Also, to make it a little healthier, I used fat free ricotta cheese instead of whole milk. I would definitely make it again. :)

I've made this several times now. I don't get why so many bad to mediocre reviews! Like someone else said, take time to let the onions really carmelize and make sure to salt your pasta water well, and save some of the water because the sauce can get a little thick with the ricotta.

If this dish was easy, it would be a 3 but the amount of work for the product is not worth it at all. As is, it is very bland and I would not recommend it. I added bacon and extra cheese though which did help.

This would be OK as a side, but as an entree, fugitaboutit. If you're really interested in this recipe, try some of the fixes mentioned; proscuitto and/or parm seem the most likely to be successful to me.

It's rare that I throw something out, but the bulk of this went into the trash can. The mix of ingredients added up to a pasta dish that lacked flavor and had an unappetizing texture.

It's missing something, but I can't figure out what it needs. I added lots of salt and pepper and some crushed red pepper...but it still needs something.

okay, this was a lot of work and it was just ok. Do noty waste your money on the large ricotta, the 8 ounce container is way more than enough!!

My family loved it...I used all of the onions as I had read reviews and some said the recipe was bland...ours was wonderful! I might try adding pancetta next time!

I found that the amount of lemon peel really overwhelmed the dish - and I LOVE food that is cooked with lemon.

My family really liked this recipe. But there is room for error. I don't think the recipe as written provides enough time to really caramelize the onions. Truly caramelized onions take at least twice as long, if not longer, to develop a wonderfully sweet, complex taste. Try looking up another recipe for caramelized onions, and you will love this!

I would not say this was disgusting but overall it lacked flavor. I added some anchovies and fresh ground pepper which livened this dish up a bit but I probably will not make this one again.

I agree this awful I even poured some tomatoe sauce over it to try and make it taste good. Mine went in garbage as well.

It was very starchy, needed a lot of salt. Would not make this again.

I was disappointed with this recipe. The sugar snaps didn't seem to fit well with the dish -- I suspect that asparagus would've been better. It was rather bland, too, so I added some lemon juice and grated parmesan and asiago to the pasta just before serving. It helped, but it was still pretty bland. I think prosciutto might have been a nice addition, as it needed something salty or a sharper flavor to improve the recipe.

This is a decent weeknight meal. Simple to prepare, but needs a fair amount of salt. My husband did go back for seconds however!

Definitely not worthy of publication. First time in a long time I have thrown away food.

I actually found this receipe fun, perhaps because it was so simple. I made some minor changes: I went with Trader Joes' brown rice penne pasta for its delicate silkie texture. I also sprinkled some grated parm to add some zest. I think the next time I make it I will add some fresh diced mango which may add some acidy tang? Let me know if you beat me to the puch on this and how it fares.

Very satisfying. It surely wasn't something that I would hope for at a restaurant, but as far as healthy and simple pastas go this was pretty good. I used non-fat ricotta but would use less next time. Some added, sharper flavor might make it better better. I kept wishing it was parmesan instead of ricotta. I'll most likely make it again and tweak it.

kinda bland. I think it might be better with some toasted pine nuts for a little more crunch.

Really? I'm surprised at the other reviews because we liked this alot. The sugar snap peas at the grocery store looked awful so I used sliced roasted red peppers instead because I already had them. Also added a bit more ricotta, carmelized the onions and seasoned generously with salt and pepper. I also cooked the pasta in chicken broth for extra flavor. Fast, easy and delicious.

I really liked this recipe and plan to add it into my weeknight rotation of pasta dishes. I used only 1 cup of onions since I wasn't making the other recipe. I think maybe some reviewers didn't read the whole article and the point of these recipes, that it was to make two meals out of one. The Frittata recipe for the rest of the onions is in the box at the bottom of the page of the magazine (page 49).

According to the magazine the reserved carmelized onions and leftover Ricotta are to be used to make the Onion, Spinach and Ricotta Fittata recipe on the bottom of the same page. I could not find the recipe on Epicurious.com though. Too bad it is not a good recipe.

I didn't find this recipe to be as bad as the other reviewers - but my expectations were set pretty low from their comments. This recipe needs help from extra salt and pepper. I also added some extra lemon juice in addition to the zest. I also used one medium onion instead of the four cups recommended. This recipe was quick and simple and refreshing.

This was disgusting. I agree that it looked and sounded good, but it was very bad. Not edible. My husband threw his in the garbage immediately. I tried to make mine taste better with parmesan cheese and spices but it didn't help. I dumped it and we ordered sandwiches. I'm surprised at Bon Appetit. They are usually very reliable. It was like they didn't try this before printing it. Also, in the magazine, they want you reserve the onions as a time saver for another recipe for another night's dinner. (That's why it's confusing here). I'd be afraid to try that one, too.

Tasted awful! It sounded so good and looked good too. The directions were confusing. First time I tried a bad recipe.

terrible. Tasteless, not interesting and badly written. There are 2 different size portions of the riccota cheese recommended using 1/2c and in another place, l6 ounces.?? Recipe tells you to transfer 3/4 of a cup of sauteed onions to a small bowl, and to saute the remainder with the peas. Than the mystery, what is planned for the onions in the small bowl? This recipe lacks the least bit of flavor. Everyone who reads Epicurious can fix it up with various herbs and spices, but my question is, why bother?.
