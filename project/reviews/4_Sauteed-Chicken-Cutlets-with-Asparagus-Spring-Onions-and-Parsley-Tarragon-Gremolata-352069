In all my years of using Epicurious, I have never rated a recipe... however after making this, felt COMPELLED to do so... this was NOT good AT ALL... I felt like the zest in the gremolata was very overpowering, all I tasted was zest... would never make this again...

Excellent, fresh-tasting dish, and so simple! Only change was to deglaze the pan with white wine as previously suggested. Excellent for family or entertaining- we will definitely make this again.

I use Epicurious often and have never reviewed a recipe, but this one prompted me to do so - it was fantastic! It's light, fresh and perfect for spring, and the flavors of the gremolata are so complex. I left off the saffron because I didn't have any and de-glazed the pan with some stock after cooking the chicken. Be sure and season with salt and pepper at every stage as the recipe suggests. I'll definitely be making this again!

I used turkey cutlets and deglazed the pan with white wine. I did not have saffron or tarragon and still thought it was delicious. I made this for my nana's birthday tonight and everyone loved it! Will be a regular recipe. Also made the lemon cornmeal cake from the same issue, outstanding.

Wow was this good! Even my version... I had leftover cooked chicken, and half a fresh lemon but no grater, and dried herbs. I made the gremolata with a tbsp of lemon juice instead of zest, and 1 Tbsp each of dried tarragon, parsley and shallot. Then I cooked the asparagus per the directions, added the gremolata and used 2 tbsp greek yogurt instead of cream as had been suggested, and my cubed cooked chicken and stirred. I already sent the recipe to a friend. Will definitely make again.

Excellent flavor and very easy to make. I made it for the first time for a casual dinner with friends last night. They are foodies too and loved the flavor and the sauce. I will definitely make again!

Very tasty. I too deglazed pan with white wine and added a bit of extra cream in order to stretch the sauce. Looking forward to leftovers tomorrow.

I prepared this last night and served it with grilled baby dutch potatoes. I made the following adjustments: 1. reduced the tarragon to ~1/8 tsp, because my husband and I are vehemently opposed to all things anise and anise-esque 2. added 1 Tbsp Red Wine to deglaze the pan With these changes, it was phenomenal!

This was awesome. I did not have saffron and am trying to stick to a budget so didn't spring for it but I can't imagine it would have been much better. I will definitely be making this again!

Excellent - have made several times now. I find that people love the "sauce" so I double the gremolata part and just add some extra creme fraiche and chicken stock at the end to make more sauce. Also, I too deglaze the pan with white wine. That's a great step that get's all the fawn from the chicken into the sauce :)

Love this recipe. I substitute greek style yogurt when I don't have or need to buy an entire container of creme fraiche. Tastes great either way. The gremolata is so yummy that I usually make double.

I like this recipe very much. It is easy to make and tastes wonderful. I make the whole sauce plus asparagus for just two people and serve it with couscous.

I enjoyed this as did everyone else at dinner - I did deglaze the pan with some white wine. Also, on making it a second time, I did not have tarragon so subbed with fresh marjoram and it was great.

I really, really enjoyed this recipe but next time I think I would cut down on the salt. I also substituted garlic for the shallot and that worked out well but next time I think I might try the shallot. My 10 and 12 year old nieces love, loved, loved it and they are two picky eaters.

My husband and I both really enjoyed this recipe- loved the flavours. Changes I made based on other reviews:Increased the amount of orange and lemon rind; used garlic instead of shallots; deglazed the pan with white wine prior to sauteeing the veggies. I added some broccoli that I needed to use up; I increased the amount of chicken broth to about 1.5 cups; and I reduced the amount of oil and butter in the recipe. I might place the chicken in a medium oven while making the veggies. It cooled off a little more than I would have liked by the time we were ready to eat.

So delicious! The flavor combination was fantastic! Thanks to the previous reviewers comments- deglazing the pan just seemed to make sense. Great weeknight meal, but would proudly serve to guests.

We cut up a whole chicken and put them on the bbq, which turned out nice and crispy and was great with the veggies and sauce.

An excellent spring dish. Thanks to other reviews I made additional sauce. I deglazed the pan after removing the chicken as well. Delicious and a keeper.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. The vegetables were fantastic. Easy and quick for a great week night recipe.

I didn't have saffron or tarragon but do have plenty of my home grown garlic so I made the "usual" gremolata. Otherwise I followed the recipe and have a great meal.

This was delicious--we got all the veggies at Farmers' Market in the morning and served it to guests that evening. They loved it. We're doing it again this weekend (for different guests!)--why not go with a sure thing?!

After sauteing the chicken, I deglazed the pan with a bit of white wine and cooked the vegetables in that (no additional olive oil/butter added). Since I'm eating healthy, I left out the creme fraiche entirely and just "finished" the sauce/veggies with one pat of butter when I added the gremolata. I thought it was excellent although I would imagine getting fresh asparagus is a must. I'd give it 3 1/2 forks based on how I made it especially since it's so quick/easy, but refuse to give it an official fork rating since I did change the recipe a bit. Oh, I also didn't "toast" the saffron first. To the reviewer who said the saffron would double the cost, perhaps if you lump the whole cost into one meal, but you use so very little that those tiny jars go a long way.

I think I must have missed something. I followed the recipe (no substitutions) and used very high quality, fresh ingredients, but the flavor just wasn't stunning. It was good, but I was hoping for more complex flavor. Maybe it would be better to deglaze the pan with some white wine before adding the broth.

The vegetables in this recipe were outstanding, but I found that I did not have very much sauce left for the chicken, which left the chicken a bit ho-hum. I think I'd try it again with more liquid and perhaps veal cutlets.

This was a great recipe. Easy and delicious. We made it for some friends and they couldn't stop talking about the different flavors in the sauce. Very yummy. Definitely a do over.

This was so delicious. I made it for guests last Saturday. I didn't change the recipe at all. Very flavorful - the saffron is a must. Presented beautifully. I served with roasted fennel / mashed potatoes.

Excellent. I dipped the chicken in seasoned Wondra for a crispy exterior and to help thicken the sauce. Easy and quick. Served over smashed potatoes.

I also left out the saffron, which would have doubled the cost of making this dish. The tarragon flavor with the chicken was delicious. This is a quick and easy dish but also very impressive looking and tasting.

Delicious and easy spring meal! I made this for dinner last week (on a week night even) with a few minor changes. I left out the saffron and tarragon since I didn't have any on hand. The sauce was delicious nonetheless and the green vegetables with the chicken made for a beautiful presentation.
