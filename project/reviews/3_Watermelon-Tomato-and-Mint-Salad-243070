The quality of your watermelon will make or break this recipe. I got every ingredient from Trader Joe's (including 2 green and yellow heirloom tomatoes) and it turned out beautifully. I cut the tomatoes up about 2 hours before serving and kept them in a colander before adding to the watermelon. I also added 2 tablespoons of EVOO, as well as some salt and freshly ground pepper. http://sctosf.com/

this is good but this makes it better... Soak the onion in fresh lime juice for a while and add the entire mixture to the salad. Also I added fresh black olives (they were actually purple - from the super market salad bar) - the evvo others added is a good idea, but I did not do that. My family was pleasantly surprised how good it was - we ate entire watermelon salad with just 4 people

Here's how it can gain the 4th fork. Add Basil oil! as in food process fresh basil and EVOO together, use a cheese cloth to strain and squeeze out all the basil pieces. Replace the feta with a chevre goat cheese that you can "crumble" into pieces in the salad mixture. Combine your salad ingredients, drizzle with basil oil. and voila! SOOOO much yummier add some tangerine slices too for an extra zing

My husband and I love this salad and make it a lot in the summer when we're entertaining. We add some diced jalapeno pepper and dress it with EVOO and balsamic just before serving. We also leave the feta separate, otherwise the salad gets a milky sheen when tossed. Delicious!

I love this recipe. I would never have paired watermelon with feta myself, but it is really very good. I may leave out the onions next time, but I'm not a big onion fan anyway.

Yuck! is right! I agree with the last review of this recipe. I am constantly looking for seasonal fruit and veggie dishes,and this was VERY disapointing to say the least. Never again!

What a waste of wonderful ingredients! Saw this on a cook show & it got rave reviews & wanted to try it. Even made a special trip to the store for fresh mint. The first few bites were tasty, hence the one fork. Otherwise, YUK! I'm a great cook & I was utterly disappointed.
