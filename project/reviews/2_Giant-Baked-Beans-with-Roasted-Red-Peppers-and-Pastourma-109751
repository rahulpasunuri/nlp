I haven't made this recipe (although it looks good), but I wanted to point out that it's posted twice.

Wow! W-a-a-y too much olive oil! I really cut down the amount, so the beans were not as succulent as they probably would be if I'd used it all! I'm a vegetarian, so I didn't use the spiced meat either! .(I guess this review won't be as helpful as I thought it might be.)But it's an easy to prepare dish and I might make it again
