I made this as written, with two minor exceptions: 1) I substituted low-sodium chicken broth for the water and omitted the salt, and 2) bought hot Italian sausage without the casing (they sell it at my Whole Foods) which I browned first and then added back in at the end. Really simple and quite delicious.

This was a good recipe - but I used Creole Country tasso and added tomato paste as another recipe suggested. Delicious.

This is a nice, hearty and easy soup. I've made it several times and even my kids like it. Don't forget to add the vinegar at the end - I forgot once and it wasn't nearly as good.

This is a great starter recipe for lentils. My daughter hates anything that resembles beans but loves this recipe. I add a potato some fresh garlic and use stock instead of water and it is the bomb

The only tweak I made to this was to use 4oz of bacon instead of smoked sausage (it was "clean out the refrigerator" night). I cut the bacon into small bits, fried, let it drain, then crumbled into the finished soup after adding the balsamic. This is a great soup as-is. If you want it thicker, try removing the lid from time to time while the lentils are cooking. It really doesn't need any thickening agents at all.

I have made this soup several times as written. Last evening I decided to try some of the suggestions. I added garlic, a can of pureed tomatoes, and a dash of Spanish smoked paprika. It was truly outstanding!

The soup was good/simple, but lacked depth of flavor for me. Maybe adding some spices to the mirepoix would make it more appealing to me.

I have made this soups so many times. Standard deviations are--adding one (large) can of diced tomatoes and a heaping spoonful of minced garlic. Like other cooks, I've used turkey smoked sausage. Love it!

This dish is really good and not unlike some Italian recipes. I don't think the people who have written comments like 'bland', 'added-stock', and all manner of other ghastly ideas, have any appreciation for really good simple peasant food, (that's what this is). If you use the right ingredients you will be rewarded with a fine dish. If you don't like the look of it, make something else.

This was very nice. I have trouble finding French sausages here (even though we're only a few hundred miles away, go figure) so ended up using a dried sausage which didn't need frying. We also substituted some of the water with chicken stock. A nice simple winter soup.

The flavor of this soup was nice and preparation was easy, but the texture could use some improvement. Next time I will use my stick blender to partially puree the soup for a thicker consistency. I sauteed 2 cloves of garlic with the rest of the veggies, used 4 C beef broth/2 C water, and added a small turkish bay leaf along with the lentils. I'll probably switch to a more interesting sausage next time, too. The plain American-style smoked sausage added salt but not much other flavor.

I made it this morning. I rarely make a recipe without tweaking it - so here goes. I added a teaspoon of cumin (I'm sorry, but cumin is perfect with lentils!) when I tossed in the lentils. I made it with beef broth instead of water and used turkey kielbasa to cut down on some of the fat and calories. At the end, I added a handful of chopped parsley to add freshness. I changed it to suit my tastes, but it is still a very simple soup to make. I'll make this again very soon.

This is a fine, simple, hearty soup. I wonder if some of the critical reviewers used regular lentils. I had not tried French lentils before, and they really make the difference in this soup. I don't see a need to throw in a lot of extra ingredients when the point seems to enjoy the subtle flavor of the French lentils and sausage.

I agree with the comment from Atlanta - this is a solid starting point. I used 4.5 cups of (boiling) water, 1.5 cups of beef stock, and a too-bland sausage cut into much smaller pieces. Next time : a sausage with chilli and/or lots of garlic, and some marjoram.

The title says "French." When you add garam masala, for example, you are making a curried soup--call it "curried French lentil soup"?--not a plain French lentil soup. Throwing a lot of vegetables in, as one reviewer suggests, changes the character of the soup entirely: It may be fine, but it is no longer a simple French type soup. Then again, it may not be fine. I think the person who suggested that people should know from reading a recipe whether it will or won't result in a dish they will like is correct. If one wants some "kick" in a dish, well, some ingredient must provide it. Many reviews on this site are very helpful, but some reviewers here often make absurb criticisms. For example, one person made a smoked salmon recipe which she criticized, but she had not used smoked salmon--she simply didn't know the difference in taste between smoked and unsmoked salmon. Another reviewer grumpled about a recipe for garlic mashed potatoes. She and her boyfriend wanted "cheesy" mashed potatoes--so why didn't she look for a recipe for same instead of complaining about a superb recipe for something else? Etc., etc....

Recipe is a solid starting point. Not spectacular, but definitely tasty, nutritious and low fuss. Perfect for lunch or a side dish for dinner. Following the suggestions of other reviewers, I added 4 cups of broth in lieu of part of the water; I also added fresh thyme, a bay leaf and parsley stems (which I later fished out). I plan to embellish the recipe with tomatoes, zucchini, potatoes and whatever else is leftover in the fridge.

Since some of the other reviewers thought the soup a bit bland, I added a few teaspoons of garam masala while frying the onions. A chunk of celery root was used instead of stalk, half a finely-chopped sweet potato, smoked tofu (fried in olive oil) instead of sausage and a few ounces of Madeira for the final simmer. A vegetarian delight!

Substituted regulat green lentils ofr french and used commonly found smoked sausage in DK stores called a "frankfurter", used chili infused olive oil for sautee. Soup was better the next day, lentils & veggies kept their shape. Freezes and rewarms well. Served with spinach salad with blue cheese and roasted figs.

This has become a staple for take-to-work lunches and crock-pot dinners for us. It requires more salt and seasoning than is called for here, but with that addition, it is really tasty.

We liked this recipe, but it just wasn't a "WOW" sort of experience and we really like this kind of french country food so it should have been right up our alley. Just not enough flavor. On the up side, it was very easy to make and with some flavorful additions I think it will be terrific. Its definately a good starting place.

Very easy and my honey loved it, as did I. I added 3 heaping teaspoons "Better Than Bouilion" and no salt, and it was a little too salty. Used a smoked turkey and cranberry sausage and black lentils, both from Trader Joe's-excellent, and would be great without the sausage, I think.

This was a very easy & delicious recipe. I substituted the water for chicken broth and increased the garlic. Everyone loved it! making it tonight.

Wow! So simple, easy, and quick and best of all flavorful. Took many of the suggestions below add garlic and use broth instead and for my own addition I added a little bit of chopped parsley. The sausage I used was hot linguca and it was perfect. I can't wait to make this recipe again and have some crusty french bread to serve with it. Highly recommend this and very nice on the wallet.

This became a winter staple in my house. I was on the South Beach diet (which allows beans/lentils) and made this all the time! I put in a bag of fresh baby spinach at the end, which gives it a kick of vitamins and makes it a complete meal. I adore it and have sent this recipe to many friends!

Love this recipe - very easy to make, full of flavor and light! I add a splash of worchestershire, use 4 cups low-sodium chicken stock/2 cups water and also add a couple cloves of minced garlic. I used spicy Turkey Italian sausage which was great!

I added lots of fresh garlic, chopped spinach and Herbes de Provence. Also, used andouille sausage and half vegetable broth/half water. I think this is a great lentil soup recipe and perfect for entertaining large groups during the fall/winter. Serve with a nice crusty French baguette.

An excellent, filling soup. I followed the suggestion for using broth instead of water, and the soup was quite rich. I think it is key to use a GOOD balsamic vinegar!

I've made this dish 3 times in the last couple of months and my husband loves it. The outcome definitely depends on the quality of your stock. I make my own vegetable stock from the Vegetarian Epicure but any good-quality, canned chicken or vegetable stock would serve (organic seems to taste best). I love the suggestion of adding garlic and herbs! I will try that next month.

I agree that this receipe may be getting bad reviews without too much cause. French lentils are different than the kind you buy in the supermarket. Also, before you add the sausage take about 1/4 cup of the soup and puree it with garlic cloves (we love garlic so I used a lot, but a minimum of 3)then return the puree to the soup. The other thing to do is add some greens, like spinach or escarole or both or whatever suits you. Sweet italian sausage works well also. Use stock as others have said but be wary of salt if you are using a sausage.

This recipe turned out quite well - we doubled it up for our French-themed Christmas Eve dinner party to high-acclaim. I used chicken stock and added a bit of white wine for good measure. We were able to find French green lentils and the nip of balsamic vinegar was a good kick. We garnished the soup with green onion and Gruyere and served with hot croutons (toasted French baguette rubbed w/ fresh garlic & brushed lightly w/ olive oil).

this poor recipe is getting a bad rap....maybe you have to understand what it is you want when you read a recipe. this is a nice, very French lentil soup. Definitely use stock instead of water, but heck, if you can't read a recipe and understand what it's going to be like, how can you be so outraged when it's not close to what you want!?

I agree with the previous reviewer. As is, too bland. The best sausage for lentil soup is Portuguese Linguica, and instead of water use vegetable, chicken or beef broth.

This was the most boring recipe I've ever made. No taste at all. If your going to make this, be prepared to add a lot more ingrediants to this - It's needs it!
