I made this for my Dinner Club last night and everyone loved them. As other reviewers suggested, I brushed some balsamic vinegar on the inside of each egglant slice before adding the filling. To increase the visual appeal (and flavor) I garnished the platter with a chiffonade of arugula and chopped roasted red pepper. Delicious!

I made this recipe as directed except at the end. I didn't want to bother rolling the filling in the eggplant slices, so I just placed the grilled eggplant slices on top of the tomato mixture, then topped it with the crumbled goat cheese, and left it with the lid on to warm through and melt the cheese. Totally yummy and flavorful.

Delicious! Would also make a great pasta sauce with the grilled eggplant chopped up and added to the sauce. I used canned tomatoes.

I used 2 eggplants, a can of chopped tomatoes, double the dried ones, basil & parsley. It was a bit fiddley to slice the eggplants but I managed. The sauce took longer to cook because of the extra liquid of the can but it was worth it because of all the extra taste. The result wasn't maginificent visually but it tasted so moorish. I will have a think about using it otherwise... I served with rice, feta and herbs (Feta w/ Mint) from this website.

This is very good. I added a couple of touches: a dash of vermouth to the tomato sauce, and romano instead of parmesan. I also made a slow cooked tomato sauce instead of the one suggested. Delicious.

excelent appetizer. i used cherry tomatoes and roasted them for 20 minutes at 400 followed by 5 minutes on broil. also, i sprinkled salt on the eggplant and let the slices sit for 30 minutes then washed and dried. also tried on a stovetop grill--- smokey taste of the tomatoes was a nice addition. toasted the pine nuts first, as well.

This is a different and delicious method to prepare eggplant. Excellent recipe.

A very easy recipe. Interesting presentation but colourless so needs to accompany colourful foods on the plate. I used half a leftover eggplant and lapped the slices over one another, pressing down on the lap. Worked perfectly. I think goat cheese always works so well with this combination and I would increase the goat cheese next time for more moisture. Easy veg to make well in advance and eat at room temp. Count on 3 roulades per person.

I've made this twice already. It's delicious and relatively simple. I did make some changes, however. I think toasting the pine nuts first adds depth to their flavor. I also marinated the eggplant in balsamic vinegar and did not try to keep the eggplant warm. It's tastier at room temp -- and yummy cold the next day!

A wonderful recipe with many different tastes and textures. I altered it a little by basting eggplant slices with a balsamic/olive oil vinaigrette. Also, I grilled red pepper halves along with the eggplant (also basted). I cut the pepper halves in two and placed a slice on each eggplant slice then the filling and rolled up the whole thing. The taste was fabulous and presentation very elegant. I must admit I didn't use any cheese as I can't stand the stuff (I know, I'm a mutant). It was delicious anyway and I will make again.

This was absolutely fantastic! My husband does not care much for eggplant and loved this one. I love the flavor the goat cheese adds to the tomato mixture. This was excellent. I will definitely keep this recipe and am sure it will be made over and again. I did not have all the fresh herbs, so I used fresh parsley and oregano and dried basil...otherwise I kept everything the same. It also doubles very well.

This is a lovely vegetarian main for a light sup. Lush texture and flavour.
