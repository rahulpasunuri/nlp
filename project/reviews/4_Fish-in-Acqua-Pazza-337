One of the simplest and most tasty fish recipes I have ever made. Great for a weekday supper with friends!

Recipe was great .... the flavors are very tasty. I followed suggestions and used white wine and added fresh garlic. The only change I will make in the future is the fish .. used the red snapper .. have never had before, and did not like. I did not cut the skin off the bottom first -- since it is a very thin skin, the fish did not easily flake off after cooking (like many other fish). We don't like tilapia (suggested by others) so will try again with a different fish.

Very good and easy to make. Like some other reviewers, I used tilapia, garlic, wine, and a few shakes of red pepper flakes.

I have had this recipe in my repertoire for years now and it never fails to impress. Light, clean but very sexy dinner. Like the other reviewers I usually also add white ine instead of water, garlic and papper flakes. If its for a dinner party I also throw in a couple crab claws or huge shrimp at the end just to bump up the wow factor. Over grilled polenta it is divine

This recipe has been in my regular repertoire for ages now. Like other reviewers I also add hot pepper flakes, garlic and white wine or vermouth instead of water. To really up the ante I usually throw in a few crab claws or huge shrimp, always a huge hits with dinner guests....virtually everyone I know now makes it regularly as well. One of the best..

Totally delicious! My husband usually has to be tricked into eating fish, but not with this dish. I've found that tilapia holds up a little better than snapper; and I second the suggestion of adding garlic, more red pepper flakes, & white wine. Instead of bread, we have it with thinly-sliced sauteed potatoes & green beans.

This was a wonderful surprize! Perfect for summertime guests. I didn't have any capers on hand, but wish I had. I'll make a point to buy some next time!

Bright, delicious and ideal to prepare for a dinner party. I followed the advice of several other reviewers and substituted Pinot Grigio for the water, added about 2 t. of minced garlic to the tomatoes, splashed in about 1/4 C of vermouth at the end of cooking, and then finished the sauce with a splash of cream. The only shortcoming of the sauce was that it was too liquidy for me to reduce it in time for dinner. That didn't bother the diners in the least: everyone was delighted.

I have been making this dish for a while and it is simple and delicious. My twists - I use tilapia instead of snapper as I usually have it on hand, white wine instead of water, petite diced canned tomatoes with juice, and add a pinch of red pepper flakes. It's a regular on my dinner table.

This recipe is fantastic! We made it at the beach with some fresh caught fish. I used chicken stock instead of water, the only stock I had on hand, and added white wine. Everyone was still raving days later.

This dish was amazingly flavorful! We used white snapper instead of red because it was cheaper and it still tasted great

Wondeful dish!! The market didn't have any snapper, so I used Scrod. So easy to make and my guests were impressed. The only thing I did different was I sauted some minced garlic in a smidge of olive oil first, than added fish. I also added a splash of Vermouth to the final sauce stage to bring out the flavor of the capers! Served with bread, and salad..a perfect healthy dinner.

We really enjoyed this. The only changes I made were to add some clams and some shrimp. Make sure you have some great crusty french bread to soak up the broth.

I cannot believe that I have been preparing this dish for over ten years! It is a wonderful! Initially, I only made it with summer ripe tomatoes, but we enjoy it with canned chopped tomatoes during the winter months. I too have substituted white wine for the water, however it is delicious both ways. We sop up the wonderful broth woth ciabatta rolls and I serve this with a Caesar salad and a great wine. Hubby and I are in heaven!

This is a wonderful, simple recipe that I prepare frequently. I have made a few modifications, both for convenience and flavor. I use diced canned tomatoes (most of a 28oz can) in lieu of the chopped fresh tomatoes and I often substitute dry white wine for the water. I also add some red pepper flakes for a bit of zip. I make the dish with tilapia and it is regular part of my seafood repetoire.

Excellent dish!!The only changes I made are that I saute a little garlic in the olive oil before adding the fish, and I substitute clam juice for the water. After the fish is cooked through, I remove it from the pan and add a dozen little neck clams to the sauce, cover tightly with a lid and simmer just until clams open. I serve the fish on a platter with the sauce on top and the clams all around it. Serve with hot Italian bread. What a presentation. Your guests won't believe you made it!!! Incredible and delicious!!!!

This recipe was easy and delicious! I'm not a big fan of capers, but I didn't even notice them in this dish. I had some whipping cream on hand, and added about 2T....it added just a little richer flavor. Also, I added about 2t of crushed garlic. YUM!

A quick, flavorful dish. I served it on top of a Mediterranean Couscous, which worked out great.

I substituted flounder and added chopped basil along with the parsley. Incredibly simple and delicious!

I'm a long way from considering myself an 'experienced chef', but I consider my taste that of a hundred lifetimes! This dish was very nice, however I added quite a few cloves of garlic, and can't imagine what little taste would result from this dish without it. With it, it was quite good!

Fast, easy, and very good. I added extra dry vermouth to the last stage of the gravy. My entire supper was prepared in 30 minutes. I served fresh asparagus and boiled broad noodles. I will prepare this monthly.

this is an easy tasty fish recipe, except the recipe is not complete, calls for a sprinkling of capers over top but no capers listed in the recipe. I know most of us who cook could wing-it, but I always like a starting point and then change from there according to taste.
