These turned out soupy and weird. I wouldn't make again, they were terrible.

I honestly did not expect to like this recipe very much. But these were really good mashed potatoes! I actually prefer them to "standard" mashed potatoes with whole milk and lots of butter. I used Yukon Golds and they took 20 minutes (not 15) to cook. There was no need to add extra salt. I used low-fat sour cream, which worked fine. I skipped the nutmeg (personal preference). I served to both children and adults and added chopped chives for the adults. Very good!

These were a huge hit. I added garlic powder and butter also and substituted vegetable broth instead of chicken broth since I was cooking for a couple of vegetarians. The butter made them extra creamy.

Very easy. I used fat free chicken broth, fat free sour cream and 1 T. of reduced-fat butter. Delicious.

Great side dish with pork. It is also delicious by substituting cauliflower for potatoes and lower in carbs.

I took another's advice and made them for the pepper steak dish with wine gravy and it was delicious. Will make them again. Very easy.

This dish is so easy to make, low-fat (particularly by using low-fat sour cream) and yummy. There are other great mashed potato recipes out there, but my favorite invariably involve multiple steps including the food mill. The simplicity of smashing up the Yukon potatoes (with no butter!) makes this dish one of my weekday favorites to accompany meat dishes. I do like the addition of fresh herbs at the end and have tried a variety (including marjoram, thyme, parsley, etc) depending on what's on hand.

Simple, good, and a great accompaniment to any main course served with gravy that can be ladeled over the potatoes as well. We had it with this site's Pepper Steak with Port, Zinfandel, and Mushroom Sauce. A very good match.

I agree with Eileen of Baltimore. Not awful, but there are just so many better potato recipes out there...... KIMBER

I made this to go with roast chicken. I followed the recipe, except no nutmeg. Maybe added a little more broth. It is a simple, rich dish with very little fat. My teenage daughter loved it. I would definately make this again. Next time I would like to add some green onions or chives, maybe bacon, whatever you want to. It is so basic, you can add whatever to spice it up as you please.

There's nothing wrong with this recipe, but there's nothing particularly right with it, either. I don't think I'll make this again--there are too many wonderful potato dishes to bother with this.

Great low-fat mashed potato dish! (I used low-fat sour cream, and Yukon Gold potatoes are a must). My friends couldn't belive the potatoes had no butter or cream. This recipe will now be my standard for mashed potatoes. Tonight I will add goat cheese and chopped fresh parsley for fun.

These potatoes were great! Easy to make too.

I doubled the recipe and it worked out very well. I used one cup of regular chicken bouillon and light sour cream and didn't add any additional salt. I also added some chopped fresh parsley for color!

These were probably the best mashed potatoes that I have had. They made a great side to marinated flank steak & green beans and they were really easy to make. I liked that the recipe called for sour cream rather than butter because I could cut down on fat by using low fat sour cream. I will make this dish again.
