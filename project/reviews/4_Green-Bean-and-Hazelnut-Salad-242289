Not sure what it was but for me this didn't taste right.... I think a combination of flavours that sounded good and just didn't do it for me.

WOW!! Fantastic. The garden has exploded this week and I was looking for something to do with all the beans beside my usual saute. I didn't have hazlenut oil, so I used the "weird" oil I had on hand; macadamia oil. I really liked the flavor of the flax oil.

This was amazing! No more boring green beans!

A very tasty salad! I used to make an earlier Gourmet version that includes gruyere cheese -- this one is also delicious. Flax seed oil is fine, but if you're not too concerned about the additional Omega-3's, you can also substitute other oils like walnut or hazelnut. Most recently, I made it with Grapeseed oil in place of olive, and all roasted walnut oil in place of flaxseed and hazelnut. Tasted great!

One additional note: I used chopped hazelnuts and burned the first batch using the timing in the recipe. If you're using chopped nuts, they only need about 7 minutes in the oven.

I've never been wowed by green beans before, but this was really good! I didn't have flaxseed oil (and couldn't find it), so I used avocado oil in place of flaxseed and olive oil. Then I sprinkled golden flaxseeds on top. My only complaint was that my dressing separated somewhat, and the bites with more mustard were better. I will adjust the proportions (and do a better mixing job) next time.

Delicious! My picky husband (who usually does not like green veggies) even liked this dish!

This was yummy! I served this with dinner tonight as a green salad substitute. We loved it! I made a couple of changes due to ingredient availability. I used 3 teaspoons hazelnut oil, as I did not have flaxseed oil in my pantry. I used whole grain mustard as well. The recipe was quick, easy and very tasty. It is a good do-ahead dish for a dinner party or get together. I highly recommend this recipe.

This was delicious. I didn't put flaxseed or hazelnut oil because I didn't want to buy expensive products for one dish. It was a nice change of pace, and people were pleasantly surprised by the hazelnuts. Actually everything works well in this dish - the combination of grainy mustard, red onion and hazelnut. Make sure not to overcook the beans; they MUST have crunch. I put in more hazelnuts than stated because I loved the taste.

made this for 2 different dinners that we were hosting in the last 3 days. Doubled the portions for both days. The first time, we omitted the hazelnut and flaxseed oils with olive oil, substituted the hazelnuts with walnuts instead. Our guests found the salad unusual but managed to enjoy and finish it. The second time, we followed the recipe, cut down on the amount of wholegrain mustard, stuck to using hazelnuts but omitted the flaxseed oil because we couldn't find it. Found it to be even tastier than our walnut version and none of it remained by the time we finished dinner. Definitely doing this again although I think we'll probably make a slight change by switching to milder tasting brands of wholegrain mustard.

I would actually give it a 3 1/2 because it was good, but because of the weird oils that nobody would ever have hanging around, I can't tell how it would be in the original. But it was very delicious and the hazelnuts make this a unique tasting dish.

I usually find it maddening when people review recipes that they have significantly changed, but I didn't have hazelnut oil for this one, and I used pecans rather than hazelnuts, and it was fantastic. So don't be scared off if you don't have hazelnut oil, though I would bet it's fantastic made as written.

I reviewed this in the past and had made it with almonds and just olive oil. This time, I made it with the hazelnuts and the oil and it was way better, really delicious, especially with the tender young local beans. I did not have the flax seed oil so used olive instead.

Wow, this was really delicious! I thought we'd have leftovers, but every single bean was eaten. Someone licked their plate.

Absolutely delicious! I've made this twice now. Left out the flax seed oil both times and otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The second time I could NOT get the skins off about half of the hazelnuts for some reason. I quadrupled the portions for a large gathering and several people requested the recipe.

This was easy and looked great on the buffet table. I did not have hazelnuts so toasted some almonds and used olive oil and it was still great.

These are great, quick, easy and really tasty! I cheated a little and used green beans from the store that you steam in the bag and that made them REALLY quick. I have made this multiple times sometimes skipping the onions and or hazelnuts and its still great!

This is my go-to recipe for green beans now. Fast and flavorful. Sometimes I leave out the onion, and I never add the flaxseed oil because I don't keep it on hand.

Yum! Toasted hazelnuts are my new favorite thing to put with green beans. You don't even need half of the ingredients. If I want to make something quick - take green beans steam or flash boil for 2 minutes or so - toss in a pan a dab of butter or evoo and the hazelnuts, salt and pepper. Delicious and easy!!

Not worth the effort. I also made the mistake of increasing the quantity of hazelnuts. Very disappointed.

Outstanding! Easy to make and wonderful flavors. Use the thinnest beans you can find.

Very simple, and a great way to get some flaxseed in your body as well.

Very good and very easy. Cooked beans and made dressing early in the day and just threw it together at dinnertime. I used walnut oil rather than hazelnut oil (thought I had hazelnut but didn't) and liked it quite a bit that way.

I made this recipie to take to a BBQ. After I finished, I tasted it and wanted to eat the whole big panful! LOL. I served it to my friend at dinner the night prior to taste test it, and he had 4 helpings! Now I have to make more for the BBQ! Green Beans Rock! lol.

This was very good and can't wait to have it again. I love all the Omega 3 oils in it but the hazelnut and flaxseed oils were expensive. Good thing there's only minimal amounts in it.

I made this for Mother's Day. Green beans are one of the few vegetables my mom eats, and I wasn't sure if this would be too adventurous for her...but she loved it! We all did! I doubled the recipe, since I was serving 5 people. I had no leftovers. My husband requested I put it on my list of "frequent" recipes. This would be a really great dish to bring to a cookout. Since it's served cold, you don't have to worry about reheating it when you get there.

This was easy. I did cook the beans a day ahead so great timesaver too. Finally, absolutely delicious! My guests raved and the mix of flavours was great. Will definitely make this again -- and healthy too!

Everything is perfect, but why do you have to prehead the oven? Pedro
