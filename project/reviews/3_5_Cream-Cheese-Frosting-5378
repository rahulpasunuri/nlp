So good and so easy! I get compliments every time I make it. I usually substitute neufchantel for the cream cheese and am very pleased with the results.

I made this to go with chocolate cupcakes. I halved the recipe but had to add the full amount of icing sugar and twice the vanilla before my kids would even touch it. Only one of my kids would eat it - my husband and other daughter would not even eat it (and you have to know my daughter to understand how bad this icing would have to be for her to not eat it). Too sour, the consistency was not like frosting it tasted exactly like cream cheese with sugar, not frosting. I think it needs a lot more butter vs. cream cheese? I will not make again.

yuuumm! This is my new go-to cream cheese frosting recipe. I love how I could taste the cream cheese over any other ingredient.

I made a 3 layer cake, so the amount of frosting was perfect for what I needed. I liked the flavor, and a friend of mine that HATES cream cheese frosting loved this one! My only issue with the recipe is that the frosting was too soft for my liking. I would add more powdered sugar next time.

Very good consistency and taste. I like alot of cream cheese frosting,so I didn't feel like I was skimping on quantity. Will be my new recipe.

This is such a great recipe. I use it on cupcakes instead of regular frosting which is often too sweet and it works great. Easy and delicious!

Not only was this delicious, but it made a perfect consistency for piping.

I've made this recipe several times now, and I love it. It's perfect with almost any cake and the recipe is wonderful as-is. Others are right about the quantity this produces, though. You'll never use this much frosting on a normal-size cake. Halve the recipe.

A great recipe and a good substitute for traditional buttercream. Easy to make and tastes great!

This is delicious and so easy! I made it on short notice for a carrot cake given to me by a friend. I only used about half the sugar, and everybody in my family loves it. Definitely will make it again.

Good, solid but creamy, stays on cake well; made with banana bread in a bundt pan. I bet you could swap in one or two blocks of fruit-flavoured cream cheese & reduce sugar just a bit for a neat effect. Makes plenty to frost a two layer cake, middle, top and outside. You can beat by hand with a bit of elbow grease and a sturdy whisk, you don't need an eletric mixer.

I made this to go with red velvet cupcakes. It was fantastic. I changed the method a little bit because I didn't have a mixer on hand: instead I threw everything in the food processor and whirled it around until it was thoroughly blended. It worked fine that way.

I substituted neufchantel cheese for the cream cheese and it tastes great and has lower fat. Fantastic with 2 ingredient pumpkin cake.

I made this last night to top a carrot cake. I only had two packages of cream cheese so cut the recipe to two thirds. Good thing I did. It still made tons of frosting. I had no unsalted butter so used salted. I won't make that mistake again. This is my new favorite.

This is great frosting. Made it to go with the Spiced Pumpkin Bread. I used only 2 cups sugar and 16 oz of cream cheese so not too sweet. The frosting and spiced pumkin bread is going to my child's class tomorrow. The kids are gonna love it!

Loved this frosting. Went very well with carrot cake. I don't think I'll ever try another cc frosting recipe!

This is exactly like the cream cheese frosting on fancy cakes. Exactly what I wanted. Delicious! It was even worth the massive struggle to blend it together by hand. If I only had a mixer...This recipe makes a TON of frosting. I cut it in half and still had plenty to frost a 9x13 cake. This is officially my cream cheese frosting recipe.

The perfect cream cheese frosting recipe!

Finally a cream cheese frosting for the cream cheese lover! I have searched and experimented for a long time trying to find the right balance. Most recipes have way too much powder sugar and butter and you loose the cream cheese taste. This has it and I love it. I don't know what is wrong with Atlanta but if they don't like cream cheese just what were they expecting? A cream cheese frosting to tast like boiled peanuts?
