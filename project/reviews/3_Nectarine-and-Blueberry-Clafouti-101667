I've made other clafouti recipes before and this recipe wins. I used very firm nectarines and we ate it a slightly above room temp. It's a great summer barbeque dessert. I will make this again and again.

This was pretty good... The fruit mingles well with the sweet riesling (I used white nectarines), and I was able to achieve the solid-but- custardy consistancy with an extra 30min in the oven. I'm eating it right now for breakfast (shhh... don't tell anyone), and I think I prefer it chilled to warm. Also, this would benefit hugely from a teaspoon of finely chopped lemon zest (meyer lemon if available) just to brighten up the custard to better stand up to the fruit.

Pretty good! I'd give it 2.5 "forks", but I'll round up to three. I loved the nectarine-blueberry combo (used white nectarines) with the touch of bright, sweet riesling. Mine took about 30 minutes longer to bake, but I obtained the desired solid-but-custardy consistency. I think I preferred it better the next day, chilled, but that's just me.

Used peaches instead of nectarines. Followed exactly; took a while to cook, but an worth the wait. Not too sweet but satisfying. Would put this one in the keeper pile

Our "on-hand" version: I made this using the Blueberries in Gin Syrup (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/BLUEBERRIES-IN-GIN-SYRUP-243194), and reducing the sugar a bit since the syrup had sweetness. Also used apricots since that is what I had on hand, and 1% milk, and we pronounced it a winner. Since the Blueberries in Gin were initially too sweet, this was a nice way to use them, sice I think cooking blueberries always gives you a sum greater than the parts in flavour ;-)

Very yummy, altough the texture is unpredictable. I used a very strong ginger beer (non-alcoholic) found in the UK instead of wine, and macerated the fruit over-night. The results were very gingery, but amazing.

Very tasty. Consistency was, as others mentioned... a little chewy on the borttom and custardy on the top. Intesteing combination of textures. I cut the butter to 4T as well. To finish it off, I made 2 wine coolers with the rest of the wine & a little 7up :)

I did not like the butter floating on the surface, either. The custard ended up having two parts; custard at the top and thick pancake-like texture at the bottom. Enjoyed the combination of nectarine and blueberry, though. I would make it again only if I reduce the butter.

Made for office birthday...well enjoyed...will pass on recipe. Two notes: I drained fruit completely from wine instead of slotted spoon. Also I left butter in microwave and forgot to add!! Though I have nothing to compare to, I (we) thought the consistency was good! My 5 yr old son also thought it was "the best". Thanks!!

We thought this was awesome! I took other cooks' comments into consideration and cut butter to 4T., also decreased wine added to batter by 1T, to 3T total. I very lightly buttered my baking dish. Not in the slightest bit wet, just tender & tasting of custard, vanilla, fruit, & wine. That it's not too sweet is a plus for me, too; can't stand some custard-type desserts for just that reason. The fruit is perfectly balanced.

I would make this again, but only b/c my friend loved it so much. I didn't know a clafouti was custard-like, so I baked an extra 15min to minimize the liquid. Next time, instead of increasing baking time, I will reduce the butter to see if that helps. Does taste great w/ vanilla ice cream.

Maybe I did something wrong -- I swear I followed the recipe. I couldn't get it to finish cooking or rise in the center. Tons of excess liquid which seemed to be a combination of butter and the reisling (used for macerating the fruit) was pooled in the deflated center. Very disappointing. I'm tempted to try it again to see if I can get it to work, but don't want to waste another $5 worth of fresh blueberries.

I've made this clafouti many times, always to great acclaim. Blueberries and nectarines are a wonderful combination. This dessert is good at room temperature, too. On the few occasions when there were leftovers (because of only 2 or 3 eaters after a full main course), what was left disappeared fast the next day.

We loved this dish and are going to try it with other seasonal fruits. I substituted peaches for the nectarines and used egg beaters to cut down on the fat calories. We served this warm with vanilla ice cream - a great dessert! Deirdre

Glutton for punishment. Made this 3 times and everyone loves it but me. Too much butter...it is floating on top. Center very good and custardy. Second time, I reduced butter by 1tb and increaced flour by 1tb. Somewhat better (to me!) but still way too buttery. If that's you thing, and you have lots of blueberries, then enjoy this recipe!

This clafouti was delicious. It did fall after coming out of the oven, but had a terrific eggy texture (sort of like Yorkshire Pudding). I will certainly make it again.

A disaster. Wasted several of my Harry & David gift nectarines. After an hour at 325, the dish came out and deflated. It was too "eggy" a custard and ended up a kind of soggy lump on the bottom of the baking dish.

i'm not a big fan of nectarines. but i must admit that it was a big hit when i made it for my friends.
