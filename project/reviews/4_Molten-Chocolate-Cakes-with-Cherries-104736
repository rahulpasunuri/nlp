This was a WONDERFUL dish. It was rich, and the cherries added a wonderful flavor. Overall, it was a huge hit with my family. I erred on the side of undercooking, so as to have a nice gooey center.

Rich and delicious!

Really good, even tho I forgot to put the sugar/cocoa in til AFTER I had whisked in the eggs. I used raspberries and chambord for the sauce. I think it would be simpler to just make the cakes w/o the fruit and make a compote as the sauce. And, yes, needs a little vanilla ice cream on the side. This can easily be made gluten free by using gluten free baking mix instead of wheat flour. Will defintely make again!

This wasn't *terrible,* but it really wasn't what I expected. Not very sweet, not very chocolatey (I used a nice semisweet from Trader Joe's), not very rich. The spongey texture I liked, but flavor was lacking. I'm not sure where it went wrong.

Delicious. I often buy canned or jarred dark cherries in the supermarket because they intrigue me, and then struggle to find a good way to use them. I didn't have ramekins so I bought them just to make this, and it was worth it. Maybe I'm a little slow but it took me a while to figure out how to turn the cakes out onto the plate (turn them upside down, duh). I served it with a spoonful of the sauce and 2 cherries on top of each. Perfection.

It only took 11 minutes in the oven at 350 to create the molten lava center. I also added a shot of Triple Sec for extra flavour. Very good, not too chocolatey, and the middle runs perfect for a delightful presentation. I served it with Chantilly cream and raspberries instead of the cherries, and a dust of powdered sugar on top and cocoa powder dusted on the plate. YUM!

Absolutely fabulous! Tripled the recipe and made 5 cakes, for which the 16 oz. of cherries made just the right amount of sauce. Used frozen tart cherries from last summer's farmer's market and Metaxa instead of kirsch. I reduced the cherry juice with the sugar, cinnamon and Metaxa separate from the cherries to avoid a cooked fruit flavor. Used dried cherries, rehydrated in Metaxa, in the cake, and added a little salt and a tsp. of vanilla to the cake batter. Also topped with a sprinkling of toasted sliced almonds. Our guests were scraping their plates and moaning.

After combing through all the molten chocolate cake recipes on this site I tried this one. It was one of the most straightforward and the right serving size. Really, really easy and absolutely delicious. I made the following adjustments: no sauce or cherries in the batter, added a touch of vanilla, baked for only 14 minutes, and served with vanilla ice cream. I've never made molten chocolate cakes before and these took me about 10 minutes of prep, plus the 14 minutes of baking. Such a classic gourmet dessert in less than 30 minutes from start to finish is a gem.

This is the easiest, most delicious chocolate cake. I never do the cherry sauce, just vanilla ice cream and whatever fresh fruit is in season. Guests rave! Sometimes have added a pinch of ancho chile pepper/cayenne to make it interesting. Or add espresso powder and serve with coffee ice cream. Sprinkle the ramekins with sugar and run knife completely around before turning out.

Awesone. The cake slithered down my throat. I highly recommend substituting port for kirsch/brandy. Fresh cherries was delicious. Frozen cherries might not be as firm as fresh. Pairing this dessert with a glass of port brings out the cherry and chocolate flavours. Vanilla icecream would be a nice addition to balance the rich and sweet flavours of the cake and cherry sauce. This recipe can easily make 3 individual servings vs. 2 servings. For the perfect dessert, be careful that the cake is not overcooked.

Rating: 4
Although the flavor is excellent, this is a very rich cake best suited for chilly winter nights; this is not a cake to make during cherry season. (Further, while it's possible to use fresh cherries, it's a bit of a waste to do so, since the kirsch and sugar make them indistinguishable from jarred ones, and their subtle fragrance is lost.) Otherwise, delicious and elegant.

Rating: 4
Awesome. Thanks to the past reviewers my attempt came out perfect. I doubled the recipe to make 6 servings. Added a 1/2t of instant espresso powder. Buttered and sugared the cups. Refrigerated. Put in 350 oven right from the frig, set timer for 13 mins., checked at thirteen and went two more mintues. Definitely needs vanilla ice cream. Next time I make it I'll use half semi and bitter chocolate. I used 60% bitter choc.--a little too much for some of my guests. Everyone loved it! Thank you all!

Made those for Valentine's day. I substituted a raspberry-Grand Marnier combo for the sauce, and it tasted wonderful. My only issue was the unmolding; one required a knife and did not quite make it intact to the table. Very tasty nonetheless. I used Vahlrona chocolate, which I think was key.

Made this last night in heart molds and servied w/cherries. The only suggestion is to make sure you don't overbake, I think I could have done with few minutes left in the oven. I used jarred pitted cherries so the sauce was a bit on thin side. Would probably drain the next time. but this is definitely a keeper!

This cake was delicious. I didn't have Kirsch on hand so I had to use a sweeter cherry liquor. Thankfully I did use tart cherries. I would never serve this with out a good quality vanilla ice cream. With out the ice cream you could die of sugar shock!

These were, of course, fabulous! I added a little vanilla to the cake batter, as recommended. My husband loves blackberries, so my sauce was a blackberry cognac combo. The copious extra sauce was great on poached pears for another elegant dessert.

Very sexy Valentine's Day dessert. I prepeared it ahead of time and refrigerated it. Came out perfect after recommended cooking time. Would cook it for 18-20 min if not chilled. Too much sauce for just two cakes. Will follow Vancouver's advice and add corn starch next time.

I made this for Valentine's Day and my hb and I were so stuffed after dinner that I made them the next morning. Maybe because the batter was refrigerated overnight I didn't have the overcooking problem others have mentioned. I cooked it around 22 minutes and it was still plenty molten in the center. I followed the reviewer's suggestion to coat the buttered ramekins with granulated sugar and the cake popped out perfectly even though I turned it out immediately after I removed it from the oven. I didn't give this four forks because I still have a tweak for this recipe - the textures of the molten center and the soft juicy cherries sort of ran together and sometimes the cherries overwhelmed the cake - so next time I'll strain the sauce and just spoon the cherry syrup around the cakes and reserve the cherries for another use. Otherwise the cake was delicious - I don't have a lot of desserts I make over and over but this one I'm pretty sure I'll be making again, probably for company.

Rating: 4
I've lost track of how many times I've made this fabulous dessert. The recipe is flawless except for the timing -- I only bake the cakes for about 14 minutes or so (in my old place, with a different oven, it was only 10-12 minutes). I've doubled the recipe without problem, and used all sorts of different chocolate -- from higher end stuff to plain old chocolate chips, the cakes will still amaze. My husband ALWAYS asks for it. Ignore the calories!

As a young cook, I try not to make the same thing twice. I want to try and expand my repertoire of techniques and recipes as much as possible before I start re-making or re-baking my favorites. However, I couldn't stop myself from trying this recipe at least 4 or 5 times since first making it in 2001. It's easy, a guaranteed success, and looks very impressive on the plate. One of my friends even went into the kitchen after eating it to lick out the bowl.

I have made these cakes before but the previous recipe yielded 6 cakes and this time I only wanted 2. I baked them for 18 min. as recommended but found that was still too long. I didn't make the cherry sauce but I did add 1 tbsp. of Amaretto to the cake, it added that perfect hint of flavour!

I was disappointed. Probably cook's error since I doubled the recipe and slightly overcooked them. They weren't as creamy as I expected. However, I made the sauce with blackberries instead of cherries and it was divine.

I undercooked the cakes a bit as suggested by others. The cakes were creamy in the middle as a result, but the dish just wasn't tasty. The cake seemed floury though there is only a bit of flour in it, and it didn't taste at all rich, though I am sure it contained a lot of calories. On the plus side, the cherry sauce is great, but I would eliminate the sugar as it is too sweet.

I made this cake I made this cake as was called for,and was really surprised that even a novice cook like me could be pleasantly surprise,how easy it was to prepare.I had no problem with the baking time, and the cherry sause was very complimentary to the cake.

Yes, I have enough sause left to make another two cakes to serve again tonight.Yes, I will make this again.

Unfortunately, I didn't read any reviews before making - my only complaint, is that they were not "molten" enough, as I baked too long (20 min.) Also, used a little corn starch to get the cherry sauce a little thicker. But, overall, a fabulous dessert & will definitely make again!!

I'm an even bigger fan of raspberries, so recently I substitute the cherries with these (frozen). For the sauce - instead of brandy I used Chambord, and then sugar to taste. Served the cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream (I like Godiva), a dusting of powdered sugar, the sauce and mint sprigs for garnish. It was to die for. Better then any restaurant, and so easy.

So easy, so good. Made and refrigerated them before starting the rest of dinner. I took everyone's advice and only put it in for 15 minutes - it wasn't quite long enough - they were more molten than I would have liked. Also, for all the people that had trouble getting them out of the ramekin - if you dust them with granulated sugar after buttering, it works perfectly.

I made this for my boyfriend on his birthday, and he loved it! However, I did make a few changes: The cake initially came out a little too "molten" for me, so I added 2 more teaspoons of flour to give it more of a cake consistency. It was difficult getting them out of the ramekins without wrecking them, so I just served them straight out of the oven, with a drizzle of sauce and ice cream on the side. Whew! Definitely a killer dessert designed to impress anyone.

22 minutes of baking time was too long and the chocolate cakes were no longer molten. I will try it again and reduce the baking time. I found that the cherry sauce was too sweet and didn't complement the already-sweet chocolate cake. Next time, I think I would make a raspberry sauce instead.

This dessert received rave reviews at my dinner party! It has the appearance of being very difficult, when it is really easy. My only complaint is that I 4x'd the recipe, and I ended up with way too much cherry sauce (we ate it on ice cream for several nights, so I guess I shouldn't complain). This is a very rich and decadent dessert -- definitely a show-stopper.

Oh yum...I made this for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and we have made it 4 other times since. I have friends phoning me frantic for the recipe so they can get their fix! I took the advice of the other reviewers and cooked for less time, about 15-16 minutes if put in straight out of the fridge, about 13 if the batter is room temperature. I also just make my own sauce using whatever fruit and liquor I have handy. Get the best chocolate you can find.

I just made this for my mom's birthday dinner - a great way not to have too many left-over sweets around the house. The taste was wonderful (I combined bittersweet and semi-sweet chocolate, upped the cinn. and kirsch wasser). My only issue was that despite a nicely buttered ramekin and enough time to cook, the bottom/top of the cake was not quite firm enough for the perfect presentation. Still, this was simple and yummy and I highly suggest giving it a whirl if you need a quick and impressive dessert.

This is a very easy recipe to make. I could not find cherries, so used fresh raspberries in cognac and chambord (a pinch of cinnamon, too!) for the sauce reserving about a handfull of the fresh berries for garnish. I would cut down on the sugar next time - the cake and sauce both seemed overly sweet. My baking time was 18 minutes, but found the cakes continued to cook after removing from the oven, so would reduce the time to 15-16 minutes so the centers remain more molten. Next time, I will use creme anglaise for the sauce.

This recipe was great! I made it for my girlfriend on valentine's day and she loved it. she's a real chocolate lover and i'm not and both of us really enjoyed our cakes. I thought it was a bit rich the first time i made it but with vanilla icecream and the cherry sauce it was just right. I found out that if you raise the temperature just a bit (like 10 degrees) and you use slightly colder than room temperature cake batter the insides come out more gooey and less cooked. i don't remember how long it took, but when the top looked like it was just a little more than barely solid i took them out and served them. I will be making these all the time.

Made this for a dinner party and it was a hit. I, too, reduced the cooking time---18 minutes was almost too much. Very rich & dense; but the big hit was the cherry sauce! Unable to find frozen so substituted canned sweet dark cherries & thoroughy rinsed off the syrup. To the person asking about a comparison to the molten cakes with fudge sauce: the cake results were very similar, but while I preferred the extra decadence of the fudge sauce, my 3 guests preferred the cherry sauce to cut the richness. But all of us would enjoy either recipe again!

I hate to be the dissenting voice, but I was really disappointed with this recipe. Our friends who came over for dinner loved it and raved about it. But neither my husband nor I were particularly crazy about it. It is extremely dense and rich - so if you are a chocoholic, you will love it; otherwise, it is too much, even with the cherry sauce and some vanilla ice cream. And 22 minutes for the baking time is way too long - the cakes were cooked too thoroughly, and there was none of the "molten" effect that I'd been looking forward to. Other recipes I've seen call for the cakes to be baked for only 11-13 minutes. The cherry sauce, however, was extremely tasty. We did use the kirsch, which I highly recommend. My husband was suspicious about cinnamon with cherries, but it works nicely - he wouldn't eat his portion of the cake, but he ate all of the leftover sauce!

This is the ultimate dessert, whether it's for a dinner party or a romantic dinner for two. It's so quick and easy to prepare. I made it ahead, then popped them in the oven as soon as dinner was finished-- perfect timing. If in doubt, err on the side of undercooking these cakes or the center will be overcooked. I made this recipe without the cherry sauce and served with a good quality vanilla ice cream. It is perfect this way! And definitely use the best quality chocolate you can find (I used Lindt bittersweet) because that is all you taste.

Just made this recipe for a birthday dinner and it was fabulously decadent! I'd recommend baking the cakes for 18-20 minutes because 22 minutes leaves the centers a little too solid. The cherry sauce is enough for 4-6 cakes, so one might want to halve the recipe... or try different flavors altogether (the cherry sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking... maybe pureed raspberries would be better?) Regardless, the cakes were wonderfully rich and easy to make so this recipe is a must-have!

Rating: 4
I've mae this a couple of times now, once for two and once doubling, but I haven't used the cherry sauce or the cherries in the cake, or substituted other fruit. So know that this is a great basic template for molten chocolate cakes (and so handy to have proportions in multiples of two). I have used different flavors--mint extract, kahlua--in the cakes and made them with Lindt bittersweet chocolate, and served with high quality ice cream in vanilla and dulce de leche flavors. Next time perhaps I'll do a simple raspberry coulis as well. For us, 20 minutes was the ideal baking time; with a resting time of 5 minutes and ramekins sprayed with Pam, we had no trouble getting them out and a perfect consistency.

Rating: 4
I'd give the cake 10 forks if I could. It is absolutely awesome! I used dutch process cocoa and bittersweet belgian chocolate and would definantly do the same next time. I think it would make 3 cakes as mine puffed way over the ramekin. I followed the recipe exactly for the cherry sauce but I recommend skipping it. While I am a huge chocolate & cherry fan, I don't think this sauce added anything to the cake. It didn't compliment it and it made enough for about 6 cakes (unfortunately I only had 2 cakes). Since the cake recipe is scaled to 2, I think the sauce recipe should also be for 2. If you want to try the cherry sauce, you could easily half the recipe. Perhaps doubling the brandy would perk up the sauce? When I make this in the future, I will serve the cake with either: creme anglaise, fresh whipped cream or vanilla bean ice cream. Then I will add a swirl of caramel to the plate and place the exquisite cake on top. You can definantly impress your friends with this cake!!

These were amazing, and easy to make! I didn't bother cutting the cherries in half for the sauce (they were pre-pitted), and I used regular brandy. Although the sauce seemed a little thin (I unsuccessfully added a teaspoon of cornstarch to try and rectify that), it was still delicious, and the leftovers quickly disappeared on ice cream and waffles. (I will note that the only frozen cherries I could find were tart ones - would this have made a difference in the consistency?) The cakes themselves were divine - light textured, rich and chocolately. My only regret is that I tried to turn them out a little too soon, and they collapsed. Nothing that the sauce and a little icing sugar and whipped cream couldn't hide, but I think that they would have held their shape better had I let them cool for 5 minutes or so first - they were definitely cooked as described in 22 minutes. Overall, my husband was speechless, and I'm looking forward to perfecting the presentation!
