I made a lot of changes to this recipe to simplify it and make it gluten free. I skipped the crust altogether and just put the chopped chiles on the bottom of the quiche dish. I poured the egg mixture over the top (made with half-and-half instead of cream) and sprinkled the shredded cheese on top. It was so delicious and still very rich. Everyone wanted the recipe. I'll be making this again for sure.

I've made this tart a few times with rave reviews. I use 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream and added more peppers. I also lightened up slighty on the cheeses, except for the goat cheese which I added the amount called for.

This was very good. Although, I probably made so many changes that my version was fairly different from the written recipe. That's what happens when I don't have a set menu plan! I omitted the crust entirely, used 9 small to medium chilies, left out the butter (that just seemed weird and unnecessary?), and used some different cheeses out of necessity. Also, I used 1/2 n 1/2 instead of whipping cream. My husband is still raving about it, and I suspect we'll be eating left overs for breakfast tomorrow. Even my 3 year old loved it!

I found this "quiche" excessively rich, with too many strong flavored cheeses. For novice bakers, it is important to chill pastry again before baking, and it should be pricked and weighted to keep it from puffing up. Could also easily be baked in a ceramic quiche dish. Further, Poblano peppers are not also called Pasillas. They are two different peppers, although they probably can be substituted.

Over-rated. Don;t think worth the calories.

I made this for my extended family as part of a Mexican themed dinner and received rave reviews and requests for the dish.

This is a great recipe... the only suggestion might be to cut down on the cheese just a little bit to allow the poblanos more flavor, but all in all, this was delicious!

I used the pastry for a turkey pot pie! It was excellent! The cornmeal gave it a savoury taste!

hmm. from all of the positive reviews, I thought we were in for a real treat. Well, really, it kinda turned out like a quiche that had WAY too much butter in it. You couldn't even taste the goat cheese, which was a big reason why I made it. I had made the other relleno recipe with a goat cheese sauce and thought this might really work. The crust was bordering on greasy it was so full of butter. I really think you could cut back. Otherwise, just generally not that impressive.

We made this for breakfast this morning. Everyone loved it including grandma who thought she might just make it with green chiles for her friends. We will make it again maybe not too often because of the fat content but it is an awesome treat. Served it with suasage patties and a peach salsa thar we had canned in the fall.

Fabulous!! I made it in a 9" tart pan and adjusted the amounts to compensate.....only complaint is that the crust was a bit thick and underdone. Next time (and there WILL be a next time) I will spread the crust VERY thin and cook until more golden brown. I served it with the very excellent Mexican Meatball Soup (also on this site) and a romaine/cilantro/pepita salad. BTW, Chef Sassy, why on earth would you even make a recipe like this if the ingredients are too rich and unhealthy for your diet and/or tastes?

I fell in love with this dish the first time I ate it at the Sante Fe Cafe, and have ordered nothing else every time I go there. I was overjoyed to find the recipe and find that it was easy to make and just as tasty. I also omitted the butter in the batter portion of the recipe. It's rich enough, you don't need it.

Have been making this one for years and always get rave reviews. Even my kids love it. It's perfect with a spinach salad. I omit the butter that is called for in the cheese mixture. It's so rich that it is just not needed and you don't lose any flavor by not adding it.

This dish is wonderful. As noted, it's sinfully delicious and worth making. I've eaten it at the restaurant and it tastes just as wonderful as when made at home.

Well, what wouldn't taste good with 4 cheeses, (3 of which can be pretty tasty if good ones are selected), butter, eggs, and whipping cream all baked into a tart dough. It was basically a very rich quiche with a little (I used 8 New Mexico Chiles and would have liked more) green chile added. I found the tart to have an undesirable, slight graininess from the cornmeal. Next time, after I get back from Angioplasty and artery scraping surgery, I'll use my good New Mexico Chiles for Rellenos made the original way.

I made this wonderful tart for Valentine's Day, my husband and I both loved it. This tart could be eaten any time of the day or even used as an appetizer. I will pass this recipe along to my friends.

This was wonderful. I've never had so many compliments or requests for a recipe. Elegant and delicious.

I made this for the first time yesterday and took it to a party last night. Rave reviews. The only change I made was to add a bit of cayenne pepper to the goat cheese/cream/egg mixture and dust a little on the top after it finished baking. The result wasn't hot, just a little zingier.

Sinfully delicious! The crust,the cheeses, everything! Served at our yearly book club dinner. This was the inspiration for my entire menu. Thanks!
