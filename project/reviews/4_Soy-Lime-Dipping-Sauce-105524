This recipe, with the accompanying chicken, was to die for! I have some sauce leftover that I'm using in a stir-fry tonight. I used a jalapeno pepper, since that's what I had. It wasn't too hot but time may have intensifed the flavour.

I didn't have any bird chilies, so I used a habanero. Man, was this searing and I like really hot stuff! Husband and daughter tasted a little on their pinkies and then avoided it. There's a reason you're supposed to follow recipes exactly (at least sometimes)....

This was so good, I got the book. I'm glad I did! There are quite a few variations on this dipping sauce that are wonderful, and every other recipe I've tried from this has worked brilliantly as well. I prefer to use dried chili flakes instead of fresh chilis for the sauces - it mashes together better and more consistently.

This was great with the five spice chicken, also from Epicurious. We made it with the coconut rice and some wasabi asparagus(actually used broccoli), both also from Epicurious. A great meal and low fat and easy.

I really liked this dipping sauce. It would go great with so many things. Will make again.

I made this as a dipping sauce for fresh Vietnamese spring rolls - it was excellent. I put the chilies, including seeds and the garlic and sugar in a mini cuisinart type chopper and pulsed until finely chopped and added the rest of the ingredients and blended. I did add grated ginger and at the very end fresh chopped cilantro. It was just what we were looking for and loved it!
