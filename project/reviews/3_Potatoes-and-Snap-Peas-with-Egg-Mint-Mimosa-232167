Loved this recipe. As suggested, I didn't peel the potatoes (used Yukon Gold). Bought very fresh snap peas from the farmers market and they stayed a beautiful green without being rinsed...and had a great crunch to them.

I rinsed the peas in cold water as suggested. I also had plenty of mint. This was a very tasty side dish, sort of veg and sort of potato. I love sugar snap peas, and this shows them off well.

This was fine, but peeling the potatoes was a mistake (waste of time and DC is right, would've been prettier with the skins). Also, I may have skimped on the mint by a half a Tbs or so (didn't want to use my whole plant in one dish!) and I couldn't taste it at all. All in all it probably wasn't exciting enough to repeat.

This was terrific. The sugar snap peas need to be run under cold water so they don't lose their color. I did it only half heartedly since the recipe didn't call for it. The ones that I didn't really cool off turned an unattractive off green. Also, I did not peel the red potatoes. This made a much more colorful presentation and probably more healthy.
