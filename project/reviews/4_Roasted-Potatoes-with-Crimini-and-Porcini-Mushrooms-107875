I made this with regular button mushrooms because that was all I had in the fridge and small white potatoes - it was great. The crispness was perfect and I didn't miss the dried mushroom powder. It will become dinner staple!

Not rating this one since I changed the recipe a bit. I've been getting garlic scapes in my weekly organic delivery and never know exactly how to use them. So I chopped them up and sauteed with Walla Walla onion, then added the mushrooms, and then potatoes. It worked well--the garlic scapes added flavor w/o overpowering the mushroom.

what a GREAT idea the powdered porcinis are - I now keep this on hand as a condiment.

This was delicious. Not sure how it could be described otherwise. The mushrooms were a nice addition. It could be made without the porcini mushroom powder (if you can't find it), but I thought it added a nice dimension to your typical roasted potatoes. I grated some fresh Parmesan on top and garnished with lots of Italian parsley. Yum - and very easy!

I found these "earthy" indeed, just not very tasty. Garlic would probably help balance the flavor.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner 2003. Knowing that I was also serving Christmas brunch - I tripled the recipe and planned to have them for brunch also. Much to my delight and dismay they were all eaten for the Christmas Eve dinner. I added some herb de provence and additional porcini dust. Delicious! These will be a favorite for many years to come.

Out of this world ! I made it for a dinner party along with turkey and gingered carrots. It was so delicious. I cut down on the olive oil a bit. I also made it in the morning, stuck the potatoes and mushrooms separately into the refrigerator, and reheated it at dinner time with the mushroom powder. The step of spraying the pan was a great tip. For te first time, none of the potato wedges stuck to the bottom during roasting.

These are great and easy.
