Kids loved this. My 10 year old had 1 1/2 chops! The only change I made was to dredge in flour before the egg and panko. Kids were not big fans of the carrots, but the adults were.

I typically adhere to the recipe the first time or if I am rating, but limited ingredients forced me to innovate in this case and I was surprisingly pleased with the results. I substituted sliced cucumber crescents (with the seed core removed) for the carrot strips, which made for a very refreshing, though less colorful, side dish (chilled the pickle mix briefly in the refrigerator during the frying steps). I also had only pork loin rather than pork chops on hand. After pounding, I cut these into thin strips. Arranged on a plate, the strips looked relatively attractive, although it requires a little more panko that the chops (and is not really katsu, i.e., cutlets). I also dipped the strips in corn starch before the egg and panko steps to help with adherence and flavor (not the healthiest choice, I know). I agree with the reviewers who prefer to add a sauce (I used a mix of hoisin, soy, & oyster sauces plus a little sesame oil). I served the pork and pickles with sticky rice sprinkled with furikake, sauce available on the side. No complaints, all opted for sauce.

This is just what any tonkatsu lover needs when the urge strikes. It's quickly become one of my go-to pork dishes, and the carrot pickles are a favorite I'm packing with lunches to take to work. I knew going in on the first prep of this that I'd want tonkatsu sauce, so I made a quick one from worcestershire, ketchup and sugar. It keeps in the fridge for quite a long while. On my second outing with this recipe, I added minced ginger to the carrots and cut the pepper down just a little.

This is also quite good made with boneless chicken thighs. The carrots are really good.

There is no substitute for something fried when that's what you're craving! I've made this many times, but now use pork tenderloin medallions (trimmed of fat) as they're easier to flatten and make for more tender pieces. The Panko ensures a crispy crust and holds up well to frying. Make sure your oil is good and hot before putting the meat in the pan & more importantly don't crowd the pan or your meat will steam instead of browning, causing the crumbs to slide off the wet meat. Bring oil back to heat before making each subsequent batch. I also add a cut clove of garlic to the oil as it's heating for extra flavor, removing it when it gets brown, and some cayenne to the Panko for a little extra kick. Ribbons of green and/or yellow squash & some julienned red pepper go great with the carrots and the pork benefits by soaking up some of the dressing on your plate.

I make this all the time and usually sprinkly a little garlic powder on the pork first. Yummy with bbq sauce - kids and hubby love it.

I make this pork a lot. It's delicious and easy, but you really need a sauce to dip in. I like bbq or sweet & sour.

I make this all the time but it really needs the dipping sauce to make it authentic. Either Bull Dog sauce, available at asian markets or Kikoman steak sauce.
