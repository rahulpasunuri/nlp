Great easy recipe. Added roasted cauliflower and bacon, and, subbed 4 oz goat cheese for the feta. All turned out delicious.

In my opinion there was way too much dressing for the spinach. I liked the flavor, for about 2 bites, then it was just overwhelming. IF I made it again, I'd make a 1/4 of the dressing.

this looks good and all, but c'mon, the picture clearly show shallots and not red onions

I took a previous reviewer's advice to gussy this recipe up -- I threw in some roasted cauliflower florets and kalamata olives, and it was very tasty.

verry good but I would like to try adding some crispy bacon next time.

This was a HUGE hit at my Christmas party this year! The vinegar was not too acidic, yet the oil didn't over power it either. It was just right. I will and have make it again many times!

I didn't read the instructions first and added mushrooms,red pepper, pine nuts and garlic to the saute then added the spinach and pretty much cooked it then I added the feta just before pulling off the stove. So it was a spinach vegetable dish instead of a salad. It was great.

An easy, delicious spinach salad that stays fresh with sweet carmelized onion and tart feta vinegarette. A great side dish or even a meal with a glass of red wine and a nice hearty bread!

very good.. barely heat the feta. It melts fast and does not need much heat.

This salad was good and with a few tweaks has potential to be delicious. I didn't have sherry wine vinegar so I substituted 1/2 balsamic 1/2 red wine vinegar and that was a tasty result. It was too much feta for our tastes but it is a good salad that I would make in the future.

This is a fabulous salad recipe. I'm not much of a feta fan, so I use about a quarter of what's called for, and about half the oil - actually, I make this so often, I don't even measure anymore. It's not pretty, but it tastes so good.

As carolh1 and Richmond said - booooorrrrrinnnngggg. Sounds like it'll be fab, and with enough positive reviews I tried it. But it was missing something.... A sweetness perhaps, a sharpness otherwise.... Nonetheless it was simply missing... something.

Doesn't this salad sound yummy? It's not. It's BORING. If you make it, plan to gussy it up somehow.

Just lacking something. A warm bacon dressing is much preferable to this. One turnoff is the look of the dressing - pretty bad. And surprisingly, it was bland.

Rating: 4
This was SO delicious and easy! I used sweet onion and did not leave the core attached - I did not want big hunks of onion I prefer more subtle onion presence. After removing onion from pan, I started with the vinegar to which I whisked in a spoonful of dijon mustard - then I added the cheese, let it melt a bit, then whisked in the oil. If you have too much dressing, save it - it reheats well. I used baby spinach and will make this over and over again!

The crowd I made this for really loved it. Sauteing the onions really sweetened them for the salad. Dressing was cheesy and delicious.

I'm not sure if this is just me, but I was extremely excited to try this recipe when someone proclaimed it (on epi in some article) as the "best" spinach salad [without bacon] ever. But when I tried it, my feta (and this wasn't really cheap stuff either) got gummy and gritty in the pan, the onion was a bit cumbersome (as it was still attached in larger chunks) and the dressing wasn't anything special and was drippy (too much in my opinion). My boyfriend and I sat staring at our salads confused. We really wanted to love this. But, I don't even know I'll put in the effort to try modifying it to our liking.

This is very simple and tasty. There was a little too much dressing, so I will reduce the amount of olive oil next time I make it.

I found the feta to be a bit gritty. Good, but there are much better spinach salad recipes on here.

Fabulous! Quick, easy, delicious, nutritious - this will definitely be on regular rotation. Once in a while I'll follow a recipe exactly, though I'm usually a little disappointed. This time I was thrilled with the outcome. The only thing I might change is to decrease the oil a tad - 4 tablespoons seems like it should be plenty. Otherwise - perfection.

WOW - when i served this at 3 parties it was the first thing gone - and we all know how the salad is always the one thing left over :)! - premade: onions (and also sauteed any color pepper i had), toasted pine nuts, and 2 slices crispy fake bacon. when ready to toss added: avocado, tomatoes and warmed onions/peppers, then decreased amount of cheese and oil and used part goat/part feta..tossed and didn't serve for an hour - did i say wonderful?!

Made this recipe for part of my Thanksgiving dinner 2009. Everyone raved about this recipe. Didn't have the sherry vinegar so I used rice vinegar and then didn't have enough of that so I used some apple cider vinegar too. I tripled the recipe to feed 13 adults and 5 kids. Every last bit was eaten. This is a superb recipe with wide appeal. This will definitely show up again at my dinner party table.

This was an easy, delicious salad that I threw together last minute. I didn't have sherry wine vinegar so I used balsamic and it was great. I loved the way the cheese melted but still left behind some texture. I will definitely make this again.

I used this recipe as the basis for a warm spinach salad that was truly exceptional. I added some boiled chicken to the oil and onion mixture just until it was warmed through. Then I added the feta cheese as instructed, salt, pepper and tossed with several cups of fresh baby spinach. Not having sherry vinegar I used balsamic and threw in a handful of calamata olives. Served with hearty multi-grain brain. Outstanding!

I halved this recipe & made it for lunch. My husband, who doesn't care for fried onions, didn't like it at all. I liked it, 6.5 out of 10, but like other recipes better. The carmelized onions really are key to it, so if you arn't fond of those ...

Rating: 3
Delicious, nutritious, quick & easy. I added toasted almond slivers and used 1/2 red wine vinegar and 1/2 balsamic. Also used yellow onion. I'm sure it's even better with the original ingredients. Served with minced fresh garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil-marinated grilled chicken breasts and steamed broccoli. The flavors played against each other very well.

All I can say is WOW!! The first time I made this recipe I apologized to my family because it just didn't look all that appetizing. They loved it and so do I. We like this salad at least once a week. I use regular cooking onions and balsamic vinegar. Make sure to use small pieces of feta or the dressing will be lumpy.

This recipe is so good and ridiculously easy! I actually kind of like the way the feta melts a little. Some call it "rubbery," I call it yummy. I will add a few toasted pecans tonight as I have them on hand. My husband loves this and finishes the entire bowl every time.

What an amazing and easy side dish or starter. I had shallots instead of onion, and by a happy accident, they caremelized ever so slightly. My husband loved this dish and I may make it again later this week.

As everyone else said, very easy and tasty. What made it even nicer was you really can do this all in advance. I sauted the onions and put them in a container and then did the cheese dressing and also put that in a container, traveled to the party, threw them both in the microwave for 20-30 seconds and then tossed the salad. Still came out great.

This is a wonderful recipe. You can easily cut down on the amount of oil without sacrificing on taste. I also add toasted pine nuts and roasted red pepper slices when I make this. Yum.

Delish. Enhanced by the fact that it's so darn easy! After trying the first time made it 3x in the same week. Tried it with marinated feta in herb oil which added a nice herbal touch.

So easy to make and delicious! I even had my vegetable hating partner asking for more. Loved it!

Loved the flavor of this salad. Be sure to use enough spinach otherwise the dressing just drowns everything out. I made the onions earlier in the day and then just rewarmed them before serving the salad. Quick to put together with nice flavors (if you like feta).

Easy and delicious. I sauteed the onion and left it in the pan before guests arrived. Then just reheated and continued to finish recipe just before serving. Wish I read about adding toasted pine nuts before - great idea for next time.

This was simple, easy and good. Like another reviewer, I thought...how can this be yummy and satifying? It was. We're trying to watch our bellies so had low fat feta from TJ's (next time I will use regular) and reduced the oil. I added a handful of toasted pine nuts per another novice cooks suggestion and my husband said they were "key". I will make this again as a week- night meal or starter for guests!

very good! I didn't follow exactly. I used shallots instead of red onion, and I used balsamic instead of sherry vinegar. And I didn't do it warm. I had to stop after the shallots were done and by the time I got back to the kitchen the pan was cold, and so I just put the spinach on a plate, sprinkled with feta and shallot, and then drizzled oil and vinegar on top. seemed so simple I am embaressed to need a recipe to tell me to do it, but I just don't have that gene that lets me wing it with confidence in the kitchen, so there you go. I will definitely make this again and maybe even have it warm next time!

I just ate this,...I'm soooo full and wow...did it spark a smile on my face.....when I was making it I was thinking,...how could this be good.....i just didn't see the 'magic' happening like my other dishes,...but once I finished the recipe and had that plate in from of my face....and tossed it around a bit....and...first bite ....OMG.. WONDERFUL ,...i want it again...sooooooooooooooon.

My husband and I LOVED this! For 2, I halved everything except the oil- reduced that to 2 TB, and added a minced garlic clove (suggested in another review). I sprinkled the cheese onto the cold spinach, and browned the onion in 1 TB oil. Then added the garlic just until fragrant, took it off the heat and added salt & pepper, the remaining 1 TB oil and 1 TB vinegar (I used white wine vinegar because that's what I already had). Mixed it into the spinach & cheese to combine. Fabulous! Our new favorite warm Spinach Salad.

Another Superb here. I've now made this twice and it's just as good as the first time. Very easy and very tasty, and served with some fresh crusty bread is enough for a healthy dinner for two.

My boyfriend and I adored this dish. It was almost perfectly balanced. The next time I make it (which my boyfriend insists *will* be very soon), I think I will add some toasted pine nuts, to cut the saltiness of the feta and the sweetness of the carmelized onions. As I'm not *too* experienced a cook, I'm not sure if that's the ticket. Any thoughts?

A hit! My entire dinner party loved it. I love the sweetness the sauteed red onion added. I even subed parmesan in one salad for a guest that doesn't like feta. I would highly recomend this and will absolutely make it again!

I loved this salad! I had it for the main dish for dinner! Next time I will not warm the feta as long, as it did become a bit rubbery.

I made this MUCH better by not heating the cheese-toss it on top of the spinach. Then heat the oil with a crushed clove of garlic for a minute or so, add the vinegar, remove the garlic and pour it on the salad and toss.....SUPERB!

I thought the recipe was wonderful. I served it at a New Year's Eve gathering and had to skip the onion, although I would have used raw paper-thin ones anyway. The mixture worked perfectly and was so simple as I just threw the ingredients together and microwaved it before I tossed it into the spinach. Follow your instincts on recipes and you'll do just fine.

Quick and easy to make. I used fig infussion vinegar. Cheese is a little gooey if you warm it too long. Make sure you use "good" fetta for the flavor.

This was a very disappointing recipe. It lacked flavor, the cheese did not become creamy, but rather globby and rubbery. I was truly embarrassed to make this dish for company.

My guests loved this recipe. The carmalized red onions made it yummy. Could probably do with balsamic if you don't have the sherry vinegar.
