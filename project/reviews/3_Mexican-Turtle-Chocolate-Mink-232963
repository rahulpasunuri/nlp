They are cooling now as I write. They look a little flatter than I expected. Something must be missing from the instructions as the recipe calls for 5T plus 1/4 cup of the caramel, however, the instructions only mention 2T on each of 2 servings. That only equals 4T---where does the rest of the caramel go?

It can be difficult to remove from ramkin - it does take some effort. It can be served in the ramekin as well.

I wasn't impressed. It's very good for those who like dark chocolat with a spicy kick, but it tasted more like I was biting into a softened bar of baking chocolate. Tt was hard to present well, as the consistancy of the dessert made it difficult to get out of the ramekin. There are better ways to do chocolate.

The cajeta is for the garnish as you can see on the photo.

I haven't made it yet. What do you do with the 5 Tbsp. of cajeta?
