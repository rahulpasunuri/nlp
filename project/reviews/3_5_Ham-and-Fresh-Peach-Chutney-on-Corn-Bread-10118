I haved used the chutney recipe omitting the ginger and substituting Vidalia onion for shallot. we used it accompany fried green tomatoes to a great effect. Excellent recipe, and am making it again.

I'd recommend cooking the cornbread immediately before you want to serve it, then it stays crispy. I baked it 2hrs ahead and it lost it's crispiness.

I made this for a vegetarian and left out the ham and it was delicious. My peach was juicy, so I left out the orange juice in the chutney and it came out very well--not too watery. The chutney also works as a good topping for grilled shrimp.

I made the chutney only and it was excellent as well as quick and easy to prepare. I served it with ham and Martha Stuart's sweet potato biscuits. I've also served it with grilled chicken and plan to serve it with pork loin.

This didn't go over well at a recent party. The cornbread got soggy and the toppings didn't stay on. It was an interesting combination, but it was out of balance. The chutney is very tasty, and would make a great side dish for a barbecued ham or a pork roast.

I made the chutney only for an Easter luncheon with friends. It was wonderful. The chutney went perfect with the smoked ham the host had made.

I included this dish as one of the items I served at a cocktail party on New Year's Day. Although I'm not a fan of spicy foods, I added this to my list to round out the menu. To my surprise, this platter was the first to be emptied. The cornbread batter was difficult to spread in the pan- do be careful to spead very evenly. You can bypass this step, though.......after assembling the triangles, I still had some chutney and ham left over, so I just served the leftovers on crackers. The guests were very happy to see more of these appear. You can expect many compliments when serving this.

I made this for a summer get together for family a few years ago and am now permanently assigned to appetizer duty, I believe, primarily thanks to this delicious recipe. It is a wonderful combination of flavors, hot, sweet, and salty, plus its easy to make in stages and is a beautiful dish to boot
