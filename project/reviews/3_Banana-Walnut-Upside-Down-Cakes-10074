Great, easy dessert for 2! Made it the first time with a banana. Second time with grated apple (half per ramekin) and cinnamon instead of cardamom. Yum yum. The possibilities are endless...

nice portion for small dinner party - unique and light enough to be served with a variety of dishes. i doubled recipe and added a touch of ginger because i was afraid of the blandness mentioned by some other reviewers. i think even without the ginger it would be fine though - brown sugar and walnuts add a sweet crunchiness that livens up any dish.

I made this for a last-minute dinner, and it was both attractive and delicious. I recommend freezing whole, ripe bananas and using those for cooking. For some reason it really brings out the banana flavor.

A nice, easy-to-prepare treat.

Good, but it needs something to perk it up. I liked it, my husband thought it was just okay. It was a great, fast dessert which looked lovely on the plate (especially with a drizzle of heavy cream poured over the warm cake), but it needed something more--maybe some ginger or cinnamon in the cake, maybe pecans instead of walnuts, maybe more brown sugar in the cake itself. I will make it again, experimenting.

I was amazed at how delicious this simple recipe was! This makes a perfect mid-week desert. I will cut the initial butter and double the amount of walnuts the next time I make it, but I will make it again.

My husband and I found this to be rather bland and will probably not make it again.

it's too funny, I had this recipe before and also lost it! Was so glad I looked for it here, It is quick and a great way to use up extra bananas or if a sudden urge for dessert arises. Worth the price of computer to have found it again

A KEEPER!! I thought I had lost this recipe for good. I found it in the original publication and made it about once a week for weeks on end. It is so easy and quick and really tastes unbelievable. Try it once and you'll be hooked.
