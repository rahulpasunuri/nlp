Simple and good, but nothing spectacular. I, like other reviewers, substituted grape tomatoes for the plum tomatoes because they grape tomatoes have more flavor during the off-season here in NYC. The dish is definitely lacking something, and I think next time I will triple the basil and garlic, and add some red pepper flakes.

Easy and quick for a weeknight dinner, and the best part is that is was delicious and healthy. I made it as written, and finished it off with Parmesan. Will definitely make this again.

One of my favorite recipes because it's delicious and healthy. I usually add extra spinach and am a bit generous with the lemon zest and a little light on the lemon juice. Sometimes add shaved Parmesan and a drizzle of good olive oil.

Good, easy, fresh and healthy. did not wow us but will likely make again. did not add pasta water, just tossed spinach/pasta quickly after draining. i think that would have made it less appealing. if we make again, we'll likely add something to jazz up the flavor.

I searched my epicurious app for a shrimp recipe, and this one was great. I left out the spinach because I didn't have any in the frig. Quick and easy, the lemon brought out the taste of the tomatoes and shrimp. Our family gave it a giant thumbs up.

Made this for a quick dinner with some modifications based on what I had on hand and other reviewers suggestions. Used thinly sliced chicken breast instead of shrimp, upped the garlic to 6 large cloves, use good white wine instead of pasta water, campari tomatoes rather thatn plum, and dried basil rather than fresh. Kids loved it! Hubby and I found it good but not amazing -- will add it to my regular 'weeknight' recipes.

My husband and I really liked this. I used what I had on hand and it worked very very nicely....1 pint cherry tomatoes, split in half, 4 garlic cloves, about 20 shrimp, handful of fresh basil, juice of a lemon, zest of same lemon, about 4C fresh spinach... I added a couple of shakes of hot pepper flakes into the garlic and shrimp as recommended by previous reviewer. I also took the shrimp out after it was almost cooked per previous reviewer and set aside and kept it covered (warm). Then added about 1C pinot grigio to the tomatoes, basil and lemon I cooked this mixture on high for a couple of minutes. Then added back the shrimp to the 'sauce' right before mixing together with about 3C pasta... Mixed in about 1/4 C of shredded parm before serving. Delicious! Will definitely make again. Easy, quick, healthy and yummy. What else can you ask for?!

After reading many of the reviews I decided to take some of the advice. I added a dash of red pepper, added a little more basil, was generous with the lemon, and added crumbled fat free feta cheese. Another ingredient that I added was cannellini beans. This recipe was easy to prepare, fresh tasting and delicious. Two other suggestion I would make is to saute the shrimp and then remove from pan. Once you add the items with juices and keep the shrimp in the pan it has the opportunity to overcook. I removed it first and then mixed with the rest in the end. The second would be to add the spinach to the mixture briefly to cook some. This recipe was delicious and our family loved it.

We really enjoyed this dish. I made a few minor alterations. I doubled the garlic. Also added wine with the lemon juice and deleted the reserved pasta water - added a little olive oil to the drained pasta instead and tossed. Also added some red pepper flakes to the hot oil in the beginning. Other than that all was in-keeping with the recipe. This is one of those dishes that is so simple, yet you just can't get over how tasty it is. I think it's the spinach.

This was a great simple recipe. I am sure it would be amazing with all fresh ingredients, but I was forced to use my pantry...and the results were still fabulous. If you are in a pinch, don't be afraid to use some canned chopped tomatoes (don't drain and you won't need the pasta water)and some dried basil and don't forget the red pepper flakes. Also, this is a great way to get your family to eat spinach! I modified with a few heaping handfuls of baby spinach. This recipe will become a staple in my kitchen amd I will be trying with all fresh ingredients as well!

A lovely and simple meal to prepare! I made it for company on a weeknight and it took no time at all. I added 3/4C sauvignon blanc with the tomatoes and simmered until reduced. This replaced the added water at the end. The taste is light and delicious, I'll definitely make it again.

This recipe was fun, quick and easy to make. I agree with the cook from Dallas...I added about half a cup of white wine and let the tomatoes simmer which reduced the sauce and gave it more body.

This was outstanding, however, I made a few changes to the recipe. I did not have fresh plum tomatoes or baby spinach on hand so I improvised. I used 3 cans (14.5oz)of diced tomatoes and a bag of spinach which I chopped. I also added the juice of half a lemon and no lemon zest. I added some mushrooms that I had on hand and needed to be used so. I did not add any water from the pasta since there was plenty of juice from the tomatoes. Once the spinach wilted, I added about 6-8oz of feta cheese.(If you have access to an ethnic supermarket that carries imported feta do yourself a favor and buy it. It's worth the price and flavor.) This was truly a wonderful dish. I beleive it's one of my top 5 favorite dishes.

This recipe is outstanding after making some minor changes to it. I started cooking the shrimp and garlic for about three minutes in 1/4 c. of olive oil and then added another 1/3 c. of oil plus 1/4 cup of white wine.This really flavors the dish and is better than using the pasta water for the liquid. Then I added the rest of the ingredients, including the spinach. Definitely a keeper with these changes. We served grated parmesean cheese when we served the dish. We will be having this dish again!

I love all the ingredients in this recipe so it is no wonder the final dish was delicious! The only addition I would make next time is to add 1/2 teaspoon of dried red pepper flakes to the initial saute of garlic and shrimp. The ingredients for this recipe are easy to find and it was quick to make. My husband and I both found this recipe to be very satisfying yet light. We had decided to drink a Bandol Rouge wine from the south of France for dinner and it paired nicely with this dish. Will definitely make this one again.

This dish was a hit with my husband. We love pasta, but get tired of our old standbys - spaghetti and lasagne. This dish was colorful, fresh and tasty. I used half of the shrimp to save on cost, but wished I had bought the whole pound. You can never have too many shrimp! I like the way the plum tomatoes are sliced lengthwise instead of chopped. It adds dimension and interest to the dish. The fresh basil and spinach also brighten up the meal with their taste, color and texture. It was an easy meal to make and I would definately recommend it.

I made this very colorful and delicious dish but changed it slightly. I used large shrimp, chicken broth instead of the pasta water, and cut back on one tomatoe.

This was an extremely flavorful dish and, as everyone else said, very colorful. I used tofu and peanut oil instead of shrimp and olive oil, since I didn't have any of the latter in the house.

A really pretty, tasty pasta dish. Next time I might substitute chicken for the shrimp, just for economy. This time, I added 1/2 a diced red onion and some quartered cremini mushrooms along with the tomatoes (seeded, as previously noted), and cooked the veggies separately from the shrimp; I let the tomatoes cook down a little, and added 1 c white wine to the mixture, then let that simmer, so I wouldn't have to use the pasta cooking water later on. The shrimp I marinated in the lemon juice, zest, salt, pepper, and garlic (doubled), then combined with the veggies once cooked. I followed a previous suggestion to top with crumbled feta just before serving (I used one with basil and tomato, to continue the flavors). My husband, who does not usually like eating pasta for dinner, liked this--he thought it was different and good (for pasta). I served it with a spinach (to carry out the theme) salad with red onions, bean sprouts, and strawberries.

I felt that this recipe needed a little enrichment, so I substituted homemade chicken broth for the pasta water, and topped it with some freshly grated Parmesano Reggiano. It was very flavorful and quick to prepare, even for guests.

Also, make sure your pan is hot enough, so that this sautes quickly and does not get watery.
