This is an appealing idea, which is why I tried it. But it didn't work. Getting the rice into a bowl shape inside the ice trays was very difficult. Once the sushi was assembled, it was impossible to get them out of the tray without them sticking to the tray and falling apart as they came out.

My husband and three- year-old loved this recipe. I had a hard time making the little rice bowls- it may have been the rice (which I made myself, based on a recipe I found on-line) was just too sticky, I don't know. They didn't look as nice as the picture, but everyone thought they were darned tasty.
