Brilliant! I let it go for a little over an hour and didn't need to emulsify it. Super easy.

My husband loved this -- what a great way to get him to eat his vegies ;-). Something about the puree and simmering makes it incredibly rich and delicious. Plus, it's simple -- I make this on a weekend when I'm home anyhow and it's good for the rest of the week.

I'm not sure what all the fuss was about. Have any of these people had acorn suash with butter before? Add some cinnamon and pecans and maybe it would be worth raving about.

Yummy! I added some pepper when I added the nutmeg, and didn't even need to use food processor, the squash was so soft, just stirred it in a saucepan. Makes a great homemade baby food for my 1-year-old, who also really enjoyed it.

Simple and delicious. Not a huge squash fan, but my vegetarian family absolutely loved it.

Delicious! Cooked the squash in the microwave 8-10 minutes which cut down on overall time. Didn't need to cook off any additional juices either.
