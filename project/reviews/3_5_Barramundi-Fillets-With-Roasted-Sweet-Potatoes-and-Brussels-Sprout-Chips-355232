My guests all raved that this was a "restaurant quality" dish. I was unable to find barramundi, so subbed haddock, which worked very well. I wasn't sure I'd like the fish/sweet potato combination; let me tell you, it was DELICIOUS together. The vinaigrette cut the heaviness perfectly. I made the sweet potatoes well ahead and froze. They reheated perfectly.

Caveat that I did not make the brussel sprouts in this. I have never eaten or cooked Barramundi and was pleasantly surprised- it's a delicious fish and the light flavoring of the vinaigrette is a perfect complement, esp with the lime which freshens and gives a little punch to the delicate tasting fish. While the sweet potatoes were tasty, I found them to be an odd pairing with the fish since the fish is delicate and sweet potatoes (esp with milk and butter) are rich and heavy. I think a yukon mash, crispy potatoes or some other lighter vegetable would have been more appropriate? Both the fish and potatoes were delicious in themselves, just did not think they were the right pair. Will definitely make both again, though, just separately!

Everyone loved this. I doubled it to feed eight people. The sweet potatoes were especially delicious, and the brussels sprout chips were also very well received. For the fish itself, I could only get haddock, and I baked it since I had so much for eight people, but it still came out flaky, moist, and delicious. I agree with previous reviewers that the sweet potatoes were a little intense compared to the fish, but they were so good that I didn't mind. I think the sides are the real stars of this dish.

I've made this dish twice now. The first time I skipped the puree and just served with a side of roasted root veg. The second time I followed the recipe completely and I really think the puree adds something. I didn't htink it overpowered the fish at all, you just need to vary the amt of puree for each bite to your taste. I do think ample vinaigrette is crucial so I would consider making extra. The brussel sprout leaves also make a difference - I've had issues with them burning both times so watch closely or lower your oven temp. Love this dish so much I will be serving it at my small course Thanksgiving feast. Oh, I couldn't find barramundi either time so used Turbot the last time and maybe cod the first time - liked the turbot better (may also have stood up to the puree better?).

I thought the fish and vinagrette were excellent and enjoyed the brussel sprouts. I agree with one of the previous reviewers, the sweet potato mash completely dominated the meal and the flavors did not mix well. I'd recommend some roasted potatoes or simple mashed potatoes to go along with this rather than sweet potatoes.

The sweet potatoes were a nice contrast of sweet and sour, but they overpowered the delicate taste of the fish; they did not compliment each other. The fish with vinaigrette was tasty and would have benefited from a more traditional side-dish such as boiled potatoes with dill. The brussels sprouts seemed just a contrivance. Regarding the previous reviewers comments, how can killing fish be 'eco-friendly'?

I just make this last night and it turned out very well and was tasty, too. I loved the creamy sweet potatoes with thyme and nutmeg. Barramundi is becoming one of my most favorite fish as it is eco- friendly.
