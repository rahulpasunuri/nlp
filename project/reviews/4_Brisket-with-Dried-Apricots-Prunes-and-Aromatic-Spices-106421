I have no idea how this tasted because it was all gone before I got to it! It smelled wonderful. Gravy: after I removed the roast from the oven, I mashed all the ingredients together and then heated in the roaster and, while stirring continuously, I simmered it and reduced it to the thickness wanted. When I reheated the brisket, I used half the gravy: thin layer in the bottom, meat, thin layer of gravy, then repeated until pan filled and finished with a final thin layer of gravy. Also, having cooked briskets for years, I reduced the liquid to just enough to cover the bottom of the roaster by about one inch. The brisket was exceptionally lean (no layer of fat to speak of), so I covered the pan while it cooked. Also cooked at much lower temperature (I think it was 225-250°F) for longer period of time. I can't tell you the time because it will vary with the thickness of the cut of meat. Mine was very thin, relatively speaking, and that meant it cooked faster than I would have preferred. Ideally, look for a very fatty later, good fat marbling, and a thicker cut of brisket. Cook with little or no moisture, low temperature and long time. Your meat will taste better and be less likely to be stringy. Cut the meat after it has chilled overnight for the best results.

This is delicious, and it received rave reviews from my family who are accustomed to the usual onion soup version of brisket. BUT, I skipped a few steps, and next time, I'll skip even more. I did stuff the apricot mixture into the slits, but I think that was a waste of time, energy, and extra dirty dishes (and it burned faster than the meat browned). Because I used the timed-cooking feature on my oven & went to bed, I simply put the apricots & prunes into the pot at the beginning of the cook time. So next time, I will S&P the brisket, brown it, take it out, and then saute the onions. After that, I'm going to add all of the spices, all of the garlic, carrots & the chopped apricots & prunes. When they have softened a bit, add the wine. After that, I'll put the meat back in, making sure to get some of the vegetable mixture on top of it, add the broth and cook for 3 hours. The cooling & slicing really does make for moister brisket for sure. When cooled, I took the meat out & sliced it, then used an immersion blender to smooth out the sauce. The sliced meat went into a serving dish, and I ladeled the sauce on top, then reheated. So, all that to say, don't shy away from this recipe because of the ridiculous steps, just make it easy on yourself! Your tastebuds will thank you!

This recipe was fabulous. There was too much liquid. After cooling overnight and skimming the fat, I took about a thrid of the sauce including the apricots, prunes, onions and puree them in the blender and pour them back into the pot for re-heating. Everyone took leftovers home

Made this for Passover and all agreed that this was the best brisket ever. Leftovers were amazing. Will definitely make this next year.

My husband & I thought this recipe was outstanding although our guests still prefer my usual brisket made with BBQ sauce. Pushing the apricot mixture into the slits was a real pain as I couldn't make the holes big enough and the oozed out mixture burned when browning the meat. I picked out the black bits. I used approx. 5 lb brisket and cooked at 275 for 2 1/2 hours, then turned the oven off and let it cook for another few hours. Once cooled I refridgerated until the next day. It would be easier to fridge meat & sauce separately. Whirred up the sauce in the pot, let it thicken then added sliced meat. I put it back in the fridge then reheated at 275 before serving. Meat was extremely tender and absolutely delicious. I was really worried when I tasted the sauce on day 1 thinking it was too sweet and odd tasting. The key is making this recipe at least one day ahead; two even better!

My first time making brisket (and channukah dinner for the familY) and it came out superb! As other reviewers said, the mix of subtle flavors was very pleasing. My entire family loved it. We served it with potato latkes (and used the matzo balls in the soup) Will definitely add this recipe to my recipe box!

This is a very simple but incredibly delicious recipe. It is almost fool-proof. I was not able to cook it the entire time, but since I used a Le Creuset pot, I left it in the oven for several hours on "off" until I came home. Refrigerated it in the pot and liquids. Sliced it cold, put it onto a baking pan with gravy, covered it with foil and refrigerated it again. I cooked it more on 250 for 2 hrs during cocktails and it came out like butter. So tender, flavorful and complex. (I had added a little of my left over coffee to the gravy.)

I'm making this for the first time - it's in the oven now, smells great. Having it for a dinner party tomorrow night with Epicurious recipe for browned onion kugel, which I make in a baking dish instead of muffin cups. Can't rate it yet but the house smells terrific and I'm cheered and bolstered by the wonderful reviews. I too had trouble stuffing the apricot mixture into the slits, it burned somewhat when I browned the meat but the reviewers have said it won't matter and I believe them!

This is a completely wonderful dish. I loved it. It is so completely different from all other briskets! As others have said--the spices add character without being overwhelming. No one flavor comes through distinctly, not even the cumin ... it's all just rich, warm, and yummy. Stuffing the apricot mixture into the little slots was a lot of work (but worth it!). As others have said, it did want to push out after I'd started browning the meat, but I just pushed it back in with a tiny spoon. I had made the slots more like an inch deep and a bit wider in an effort to prevent that from happening ... and in some instances that did help. I wanted to be sure to have plenty of gravy so I added double the onions and carrots and, in the pan, extra spices in proportion. My brisket was 7 pounds and I cooked it at 275 for about 5-1/2 hours. Also, I pureed the sauce while cold. I forgot to add the prunes and apricots at the end and omitted the cilantro, which one of my guests really hates--the prunes would have been a great addition but I didn't miss the cilantro.

Oy, I made a boo-boo right off the bat. The first paragraph was confusing, I added 1 tsp. each of cumin, salt and cinnamon. "1 teaspoon cumin, salt, cinnamon..." should say "1 teaspoon cumin, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon..." My mistake made a great paste to stick in the cuts! However my husband doesn't like cinnamon, so when I realized my mistake 30 minutes into roasting, I scraped the filling out of the cuts. Be careful.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe. Especially if you like those spiced up flavors that remind you of Indian or Middle Eastern cusine. Though, be careful to check every once in a while since the brisket can be overcooked! Not the end of the world, just hard to keep in slices, but just as good.

I made this for Hanukkah this year and it blew last year's brisket away (the one called My Mother's Brisket or something like that). I followed the directions more or less to a T, other than adding 1/2 cup more of red wine and cooking it low and slow (275 degrees for 4 hours). For the life of me, I can't understand how previous reviewers found this dish bland! This will be my brisket recipe from now on. My husband has even asked when we can have it again! I highly recommend chilling the meat separately from the gravy - that direction wasn't clear in the recipe and it makes removing the fat from the gravy much easier.

Absolutely fabulous I slow cook this even longer so it just falls apart. I even have men begging for this recipe. This is a fabulous party dish. Make two days ahead and then the day of, just slice thin put in a large cassarole dish with all the "sauce", and reheat.

Tasted wonderful . . . and I didn't even add the prunes, extra apricots or cilantro at the end. Can only imagine how good it will taste tomorrow when I complete it! The gravy is wonderful, but at our house we still like our horseradish and mustard with brisket.

We really enjoyed this recipe! There were some missteps made in the cooking process, but it came out great all the same. To top it all off, we had a power outage and had to reduce the gravy and reheat the brisket on a camp stove. I guess it's safe to say that this brisket is hard to ruin!

This is a delicious recipe that has become a regular for our Rosh Hashanah dinner. It always gets rave revues and requests for the recipe. Our family is Sephardic so we really love the middle eastern slant to this dish. I always make my brisket weeks in advance and freeze it. Then defrost, slice and reheat the day of serving...it's almost like cooking it twice and it really deepens the flavors. My nephew is allergic to apricots so I've started using dried mango instead - really can't taste the difference. It's a wonderful dish!

Rating: 4
Ok, so I made this again and once again, it was the hit of the Seder. Yes, it takes some prep but here's how I handled it. Sunday prior to Pesach, I prepared the brisket. I cut and 8lb roast in 1/2 so that I could oven roast in my Le Creuset French oven. Then I chilled for 24 hours, sliced the meat and transferred to a foil roasting pan. I just had to reheat Sat night and there were no messy pots and pans to clean up. Besides, the flavor of this dish improves with age. The consensus was that this dish was a nice change from the traditional sweet brisket a la cranberry sauce.

Oh boy! There is a reason my mother says I always lose my wallet, I do not pay attention. SO of course I wake up the DAY of my Rosh Hashanah dinner and start cooking. I get the brisket in the oven after an hour of chopping and saute-ing and spicing and pushing only to find out you are supposed to cook this bad boy a day in advance! BUT do not fear all you non-followers of instructions. It still came out amazing! I also had 7 LBS of meat so It needed to cook an extra hour. It was out of the oven by 1:30PM cooled for a halfy and into the fridge. Out of the fridge by 6PM, sliced, put back into the pan and into the oven at 350 for another half an hour and ready to serve. I did not really bother with the whole gravy thing. The sauce had reduced enough at that point. I Added a little wine, stirred ,dumped it all on a plate and presto. Forgot to add the cilantro, but no matter. PLATES were clean by the end of the meal and everyone RAVED about the brisket! I did pretty well for a gentile! By the way who created this review box...!!?? it is horrible!

Wow! I had this at my sister's house last year and loved it. I made it for seder dinner this year and it was a huge hit. Four people asked for the recipe. I made 12 lbs of brisket and it fed up to 35 hungry mouths. We had a potluck dinner so there was other food as well. I made the recipe on Saturday to serve on Monday. I doubled the cayenne, because I love to add a kick of spice. At first I was nervous it was too spicy but the flavors mellowed after two days and it turned out perfect. Oh, and there was not a single Jewish person there that did not say it was one of the most tender and delicious briskets ever. Time consuming, but for a cook every step is enjoyable.

I made this dish according to the instructions--and i'm sure glad i cooked it a day ahead because when we tasted the sauce after cooking it, it was horrible. Tasted totally overspiced and burned. but after resting in the refrigerator overnight it really mellowed out. I added some chicken broth and water (maybe a cup total) to lighten it up a litte, and the dish was delicious! Also, i halved the recipe and it would easily have been enough for 4 to 6 (my husband and i ate about 1/4 of half the recipe).

This ia a recipe that screams "MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING". I prepared this for a graduation party and was so excited to serve it however the response was as the fork rating says "Like it, dont' love it"! I am used to people LOVING my food and this dish gets little love. The flavor is boring and lacks the WOW factor. Also the accompanying pic is deceiving because a professional food stylist charged big bucks to make this lacklustre dish look spectacular.

This is second time that I prepared this dish for a holiday crowd. I pretty much followed the recipe although I, too, had difficulty in keeping the puree in the slits. In the end, it didn't seem to matter, although I would make deeper and wider cuts the next time. I use an oval Le Creuset baker and the time and temp called for in the recipe work perfectly with this cooking method. I didn't have coriander but I don't think it was missed. I chilled the meat overnight, then sliced cold, put into a foil pan with the sauce and reheated for our seder. It was absolutely sensational and although it requires a bit more preparation than some other brisket dishes, it is well worth the effort.

Brisket was great. Everyone loved it. I substituted apricot preserves for the dried apricots. I made very deep slits in the meat at a 45-degree angle. After stuffing each little pocket, I pushed in a half prune so that the stuffing would not spill out. I used a tiny spoon for stuffing the slits and also used my fingers to push the filling in as deeply as possible. I will double the recipe next time. Also, I will try it with chicken and pork. Great recipe; great smells; great flavor.

This took a lot longer to prepare than i was expecting but i wanted to do it because i had it at someone else's house and it was totally delicious. It's now in the oven and my house smells devine..... i combined several other reviews and am cooking it at 275 for at least four or five hours because i agree that this cut of meat benefits from longer cooking at a lower temp.... The reason that i'm even writing (because it's already gotten so many rave reviews) is because for anyone attempting this for the first time, you MUST read through this recipe carefully and make notes because there are many instances where you only add part of something and then add the rest of it later to something else.......i already made many mistakes but i'm sure it won't matter in the end. The best thing about epicurious, aside from the great recipes, are all the reviews that follow.....they are so helpful. Now, i'm going to have a gin and tonic and put my feet up......i am exhausted ......

So delicious! This is like a combination of brisket and tsimmes. I prepared the brisket two days before I served it and the meat simply melted off the fork.

I made this the other day and had a very hard time getting the apricot puree into the slits. In fact, all the puree popped out during the browning process and burned. Luckily, this did not hamper the rest of the cooking process and the meat was delicious, without the puree. Did anyone else run into this problem?

Ok, I am a College student so I don't exactly have a lot of "free time" or an oven as I live in a dorm, hehe... But I borrowed my Mom's crockpot and it worked out awesome. I cooked it for a day and a half, nearly driving the entire dorm block crazy... This was my first realy "I made it myself" Channukah meal, I made it last year and it was a smash hit. This year I am adding some new fruits too it, like dried mango and papaya to try that out. I hope it works as well as this recipe. CROCKPOTS ROCK!

Good flavors and a nice hearty winter meal that can be made ahead and reheated as needed, but it needs a few adjustments. The cooking time is too short at too high a temperature for this cut of meat. It needs 5 to 6 hours at 275 (long and low moist heat is needed to melt the collagen in this cut of beef). As written the recipe is difficult to follow with splits of ingredients-a notation that they are split in the ingredient list would help. I use a highlighter to mark the spots in the text where the splits occur. My family still prefers our standby recipe of 4-6 lb brisket sprinkled with 1.5 to 3 oz liquid smoke(depending on size and taste), celery salt, onion & garlic salt or powder-marinated over night and then sprinkled with salt (omit or adjust if you use salts earlier),black pepper & worchestershire sauce. Cover & bake 275°F for 5 hours. Uncover and pour 6 oz of your favorite BBQ sauce over the top and bake another hour. Slice and serve or refrigerate (especially if you want to easily remove fat)

I'm reviewing this for the second time. I made it again for the holidays (and a different crowd) and it was a huge hit (two briskets and only a couple slices left over!) I make it days in advance and that only seems to help. I find it necessary to cook longer than the recipe suggests, but it was fork tender and absolutely delicious. I don't think I'd ever make a different brisket.

This is a great recipe, my guests were practically licking their plates. I made it 3, yes 3, days in advance, cooked a 4 3/4 pound piece almost 4 hours (until a fork went in very easily). I didn't chop the carrots, I put whole baby carrots into the sauce from the beginning. I always slice brisket when it is warm, when it has been out of the oven and out of its gravy for 30-60 minutes. Over the first night, refrigerated the sliced meat separately from the gravy. Next morning I skimmed the fat off the gravy, and pureed it, carrots and all, to make it nice and thick. Put the meat back into it, and then it all went back into the fridge together for a couple of days and let the flavors mellow in the refrigerator as I often do with savory, slow-cooked meat dishes like chili and stew. Reheated slowly on the stove top. It is not sweet, not spicy-hot, just savory and fork-tender. I think making it one day before, is the minimum for good flavor.

I had a large number of people for sedar a couple of years ago and I made this recipe for the adults and "Grandma's Brisket" for the kids. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out delicious -a nice change from a sweet brisket. My suggestion would be to serve this mainly to adults and only if they are adventurous. If you've invited old Uncle Saul and he only likes Aunt Sadie's brisket, he's not going to like this one. Flip back and find "Grandma's Brisket" for him.

i served this last night for Passover. I never make brisket but that changes with this recipe. Everyone -- Jews and Gentiles alike -- thought this was the best thing they'd ever eaten. My husband is disappointed there wasn't more leftover. I started it on Wednesday because I was going to be gone all day Saturday and wouldn't have time to cut it, etc. The flavors were fabulous, it was extremely tender (i cooked it longer than called for) and it was great with mashed potatoes.

I served this at our Seder and it received rave reviews from ALL our guests. One even went so far as to say that this brought back memories of her childhood Seders and her mother's brisket. I had no coriander but it seemed to work fine without it. I made this a couple of weeks ago, chilled it overnight, sliced and froze the entire meal in a foil pan. Then all I had to do was thaw, heat and serve! We still have a little left over and personally, I think the flavors improve with time!

I tripled the recipe for 20, chopped the onions and carrots in my food processor, and once cooked chilled the whole thing overnight. Next day sliced the brisket, boiled the sauce and veggies for about half an hour to reduce, and added just a little cornstarch and water to give the sauce a little more body. This one is a definate hit!

My guests for Rosh Hashanah *loved* this brisket. I made it a second time the night before company was coming; it was so good my husband ate half of it by dinner time the next day (he works at home) and I had to make something else for dinner. I personally don't like fruits in my main dishes, but this recipe produced (for me) a well-balanced dish in terms of sweetness and spices. One thing I did the first time was when I stuffed the chopped fruit into the brisket I left some "hanging out" so when I browned the meat, the fruit burned. I didn't let that stop me though -- I scraped off the burned parts, washed my dutch oven, and proceeded with the recipe. I'm glad I did because the end product was great.

This is one of the only four fork recipes that I've ever been disappointed with. I've made plenty of briskets before and followed recipe exactly, but I was underwhelmed by this one.

This recipe produced a brisket that was sumptuous and worthy of a Passover feast. It was by far the most flavorful brisket I have ever tasted, including the Brisket with Portobello Mushrooms and Dried Cranberries which until now, was my favorite. The recipe is a lot of work though, especially if you are making more than one piece of brisket; but it is well worth the effort. I prepared and cooked the meat 2 days before serving, sliced it thinly, poured the gravy over it and refrigerated it. The gravy, which is fabulous, had a chance to seep into into the meat. Reheated it in the gravy at 350 degree oven. My guests raved about it.
