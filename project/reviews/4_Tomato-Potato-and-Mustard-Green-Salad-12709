Everyone at the table raved about this salad - even to the point of saying that it was the best salad they had every had. I had found some nice, very fresh, mustard greens at the farmers market but still was surprised by their "hot bite" when eaten raw. This dressing tamed the bitterness and allowed the mustard green's flavor to blend perfectly with the potatoes and tomatoes. Very nice dish to showcase the late summer farmer's market bounty.

I made this exactly as specified. Very tasty! It is very colorful on the plate. This is a great "make ahead" salad!

I discovered this recipe a year ago and make it on average 4 times a month. My husband and I are addicted to it. Everyone we have served it to has liked it as well. I do steam or boil the greens 2-3 mins, finding them a little easier to digest than when they're raw. An added bonus: Mustard greens have the most calcium and Vit D of any vegetable and are extremely high in antioxidants.

I got some Mustard Greens from my CSA and didn't know what to do with them. I tried this and loved it so much I made it again the same week. Perfect with dry rubbed pork ribs and parmesean chile corn on the cob. It is attractively presented and unique. Even those of my family not enthusiastic about veggies loved it, particularly the dressing.

Really liked this one. I used spinach like the others, added boiled eggs and a scatter of crispy Walla Walla onions. Particularly liked the vinaigrette. I planned to double it but fed a herd of people on the single-sized version. Certainly did not need to double the dressing. Very nice change from the typical green salad. We might put grilled flank steak on next time to make it a meal!

Excellent, I used spinach for the greens and added 4 wedged hard-boiled eggs. Served with grilled chicken, corn on the cob, sourdough bread and a soft Australian shiraz. Guests were enthusiastic.

I never make anything that is served this way on a platter (where have I been). This is a great recipe and at the last minute I realized I had dandelion greens instead of mustard greens and it still turned out really well. The dressing is so good and it looks beautiful. The ingredients can hold up to the dressing so it can sit on a buffet awhile and not deteriorate. I made the whole recipe for the 2 of us and I'm not sure it serves 8 because my husband finished the whole platter and was slurping the dressing with a spoon.

An excellent dish for an outdoor supper. It feeds many people, is pretty to look at, and is tasty. If your produce supplier doesn't carry mustard greens, spinach is an excellent substitute.
