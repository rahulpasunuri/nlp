I made this as directed, and while they presented beautifully the flavor read salty and quiche-y. At best they were pretty unremarkable, and I would try any other savory souffle recipe before I would make these again.

I was nervous about making this for our annual Christmas Eve dinner party since I have never made a souffle before, but they turned out beautifully. I made the full recipe and I thought they were very "spinachy" and delicious, they are tasty the next day too. I will also leave out the salt next time, since my Trader Joe's Parmesan provides enough salt. These are beautiful, festive and impressive!

Excellent! I halved the recipe, omitted salt and added a fair amount of garlic. The most amazing thing was that the souffles didn't fall after coming out of the oven.

The presentation was nice but I don't think it captured an essence of spinach nor anything really. I might try it again on a full scale as I HAD tried to reduce the recipe. Possibly add some garlic?

I made this as one large souffle this evening and my husband and I really loved it. We did find it a bit too salty for our tastes (and I would have otherwise rated it a full four stars). I would recommend omitting the kosher salt and allow your guests to season to taste.
