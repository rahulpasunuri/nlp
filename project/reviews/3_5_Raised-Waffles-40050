This waffle recipee is a revelation. The thin batter and gentle yeast aroma yield an outstanding delicious waffle. Light and lacy, with a fine creamy inside and a crisp golden exterior. Truly distinguished from heavier pancakes, try these with muddled berries and cream, or just a touch of butter and agave. So delicious.

Very good- save extras for the toaster. Can be made in a belgian waffle maker.

I have been making this recipe for 11 years; it's perfect. It's idiot-proof and and has won over every guest. We have a Wimbledon party and I serve these. I serve them the morning after New Year's Eve... Valentine's Day brunch, Christmas brunch... you can't go wrong here. Leftovers freeze well, thaw nicely and are great with a cup of tea in the afternoon. I have used half the butter and they are just as tasty, but do not brown as much. Once, I flavored them with Grand Marnier and the accompanying whipped cream as well--it all works. Maple syrup, bacon and whipped cream and... you've got a winner, every time.

Just follow the damn recipe. This is the ultimate recipe. Easier, and much tastier than all the others. Sure you can modify it, but I doubt you will find that you can improve it much.

This recipe is flawed. The batter comes out too thin, resulting in waffles that approximate cardboard. There's a simple way to fix it, though. 1) Instead of 2 cups of flour, use 2 3/4 cups. 2) Do not separate the eggs. Just mix in the whole eggs before cooking the waffles. 3) Just before cooking the waffles, mix in 2 tbsp of sugar. The result is a very flavourful waffle that is perfectly crispy on the outside, and soft and caky on the inside.

These are fantastic - the only change I would make is to add 2 tsp vanilla in the morning (along with the eggs and baking soda)... one review questioned the flavour for breakfast... we tried it with Canadian Maple Syrup as well as fresh blueberries and whipped cream... the malty flavour of the waffles matched perfectly with breakfast foods like blueberries, etc. I so recommend this!!!!

Hubby made this for a casual breakfast gathering, Instead of mixing the night before, he did it the day of. We made a couple of changes to the recipe: 1. used self-rising flour instead of all-purpose flour by accident 2. added a swirl of real vanilla syrup to counteract the yeasty smell IMHO, this is the perfect waffle to accompany eggs and bacon (or anything savory).

These waffles are amazing! Crisp on the outside, tender and tasty on the inside. The yeast gives it a full bodied taste that I did not find overwhelming at all. So glad I found this recipe.

Incredible waffles! I got the recipe from my mother-in-law who's been doing raised waffles for years. I use all whole wheat flour, 2 tablespoons of butter and skim milk and they are still fabulous. The yeasty aroma in the morning is a joy to the senses. REAL maple syrup is a must and cinnamon atop seals the deal. The frozen leftovers toast nicely but are best if you thaw them a little by letting them sit on top of you toaster as it heats up.

This is my new favorite waffle recipe. It's light, flavorful, and has a wonderful texture. I like that you can make it the night before, roll out of bed, and crack a couple of eggs in it. Be careful with the waffles towards the bottom of the bowl--they cook more quickly as the batter deflates a little.

Rating: 1
this was a very odd recipe- is this supposed to be for dinner with fried chicken or something? it was VERY savory tasting between the heavy, heavy yeast flavor and the lack of sweetness. it does definitely get very crispy on the outside and nice in the inside, but the flavor is so strange and odd with maple syrup (although of course enough syrup makes anything mostly OK), I couldn't serve it for breakfast.

I converted this to gluten free using Annalise Roberts' brown rice flour mix (from "Gluten-Free Baking Classics"), replacing about a tablespoon per cup of the flour with a tablespoon of chestnut flour (for flavor), plus 1/2 tsp (total, not per cup of flour) of xanthan gum. I also only use 1/2 tsp of yeast. I had to thin the batter quite a bit, so next time I'll try using maybe 1 1/2 cups of flour instead of 2, but the waffles came out great, as good as I remember from before going gluten free.

My husband and I felt that this recipe had too much of a yeasty flavor (which is not usually something either of us dislikes.) In the future, might try another recipe calling for less yeast or stick with the Nesbitt waffle recipe on this site.

A really light and delicate waffle. Made it with 2 teaspoon of yeast, 1 cup white and 1 cup whole wheat flour, reduced butter to 1/4 cup, and used 2% milk. It's a very different texture from the buttermilk waffle (also from epicurious) I made before, and it's ended up being one of the more healthy one because of the adjusted fat content. We also used a Belgium maker and putting batter of around 2 to 2 1/2 cup batter in. The leftover is getting soft but will try to toast it later to get the crispiness back. Overall, a very good recipe.

This is the best waffle recipe ever. Marion Cunningham is a national treasure! We've started giving waffle irons, with a copy of the recipe, as shower or wedding presents. (Unlike the old days, brides really don't get three waffle irons any more.) Try these--and make them just as the recipe says.

I love this recipe and make these pretty regularly. They are light as a feather and very crispy--most waffles are way too heavy for my taste. We use a regular waffle iron and it works just fine. I use fat free half and half for the milk to reduce the fat a bit, but then negate that savings by adding in crisp, crumbled bacon to the top of the batter when I put it in the waffle iron. The batter puffs up around the bacon and it stays crisp.

Rating: 4
This recipe is perfect as is. Crispy & light. NEVER put it in a Belgium waffle iron. I have made some changes because I make this recipe all the time. I have cut the butter back to 2 T. to reduce the fat & I make it with 100% whole wheat flour. The waffles turn out just as light & crisp this doesn't sacrifice texture at all.

Rating: 4
Halve the yeast, measure the flour according to weight (1c. = 5 oz. per America's Test Kitchen) and hold the salt until the next morning and this makes the absolute best waffle I have ever eaten anywhere. They are crispy on the outside, even when covered with syrup, yet light and tender inside. I use a "turn-over" Belgian waffle maker and don't know if they would be as good in a regular waffle maker. However, since baking powder doesn't really have time to work in a waffle maker this recipe is probably worth a try.

Rating: 4
This recipie produces superior results, IF one has the proper equipment. For best results, use a waffle iron that turns over. Otherwise the waffle may not rise to meet the top iron. The recipie is very easy to make. There is no need to beat the egg whites separately. I have made this recipie at a varitety of altitudes using a variatiey of brand-name ingredients with consistently excellent results.

I generally think that a waffle is a waffle and I am not very fond of them. But my husband ask for waffles for Easter brunch and so I went looking for a recipe. Well I like waffles now! And for entertaining, they were significantly easier than many things because the batter is ready the night before. And the batter didn't stick at all on my waffle iron. Well it shouldn't with all of that butter! I did save the egg whites and whipped them the next morning to add to the batter, just in case I needed the volume in the batter. It was not needed though. Really great.

These are the BEST waffle recipe I have found. I have taste tested about 8 different recipes and these are the best. They have the best crunch and are custardy on the inside. I added 2 teaspoons of sugar, cinnamon and vanilla to add more flavor. Only used 1/2 pkg of yeast (Red Star brand) and let the yeast do its job for 2 hours at room temp. then stored the batter in the fridge overnight. In the morning I added the salt (as someone suggested in an earlier review) and rest of ingredients. Egg whites were whipped and folded in. Batter was not runny at all. You have got to try this recipe!

Easy & absolutely wonderfull! After reviewing comments section: added a little vanilla, let the batter rest for ~ 90 minutes, & delayed adding the salt until the last step. We added blueberries to last half of the batter...get out the blueberry syrup! The next batch going to slightly "undercook" half of them for the freezer/toaster later.

Rating: 2
The flavor on this is great like others have said! Unfortunately, I'm not sure if it's my belgian waffle iron's fault or my batter, but the batter was so fluid that it quickly spilled out the edges of the iron, and did not fill the top of the iron. Holding the two halves tight was marginally successful.

My 19 year old son just made these for the bijillionith time to take to his 91 year old grandma's house tomorrow morn for breakfast (and he DOES NOT like to cook!) The only failure we've ever had with this recipe in over 20 years was when we made them (once) in a regular waffle maker. They MUST be made in a Belgian waffle maker.

Disappointing. These waffles were much too crispy and airy. They had almost no flavor and the texture was not fluffy but rather like crispy air. I ended up adding more sugar, some vanilla extract and almost another cup of flour to give them some body but still a big disappointment. Will definitely not use this recipe again.

These were the worst waffles I have ever made. I used a Betty Crocker waffle machine-which I have used before, so I don't think that this was the problem. Yes, they were crispy but they were too mushy inside. Very dissappointing, I ended up eating All Bran instead, not quite the nice saturday morning breakfast that I had planned for myself and my boyfriend.

Definitely a good waffle recipe. Great if you like your waffles light and crispy. I went looking for the recipe in the morning, so I didn't really have time to let them sit 8 hours. I let them sit for 1 hour, and it worked just fine. I didn't think they were too yeasty and they absorbed my maple syrup quite nicely. I recommend these waffles highly. I cooked them on a very hot iron for 4 minutes.

This recipe is AMAZING! I was never a fan of waffles because they are always so dry. Not these! Crispy on the outside, soft and bread-like on the inside. Fabulous smell of baking bread when these are cooking. I wouldn't change a thing.

This is the best waffles I've ever made. After eating these waffles, I don't think I would like to try any other waffle recipes using baking powder. The waffles are feathery-light and tender on the inside, crispy on the outside. The crispy exterior doesn't soak up the syrup as fast which will not cause a soggy waffles at the end. As your fork or knife goes down on the waffles, you can actually hear the crunch of the cripy exterior. The yeast gives the waffles a sourdough-like flavor which I love. This is truly the best waffle recipe.

It's 6am and I am making these waffles, which are good!! They are just as the other reviewers said, crisp on the outside, soft inside- they turned out so even though my batter did not *double* which concerned me. I cut out 1 Tbsp of butter, might try cutting out 2 Tbsp. next time.

This is the best waffle recipe.. I have been making waffles for years, but none can hold a candle to this one. I have made them a half dozen times.. and since my waffle iron only makes one large waffle at a time, I set the oven to warm, make the waffles, and put them in the oven on a rack on a cookie sheet.. it holds them at a perfect temperature for serving.. delicious with maple syrup, or sliced strawberries and whipped cream... YUMMMM!

This by far the best waffle recipe I have ever tried. If you add the salt the next morning when you are adding the eggs you will find that the waffles are even lighter. Salt and yeast do not like to cohabitate. Served with fresh strawberries and a good quality strawberry yogurt they are magnificent.

This waffle recipe is delicious. I substituted buttermilk for milk and I seperate the eggs, beat the whites, and fold them into the batter. I have doubled the recipe. It is a perfect feast when you have a lot of company for breakfast since most of the prep is done the night before. It does keep in the fridge for 4 days or so, but the batter gets very thin. It still works though. Leftover waffles are good frozen and popped into the toaster. While not as good as fresh, these are much better than the store bought frozen ones. My grandson calls them my "killer waffles."

I have been making these for years and I guess I'm a bit protective of them. Anyone who has had a failure with these, simply didn't follow the recipe. They are PERFECT, crispy on the outside and moist/light in the center. They don't hold well, you have to serve them immediately. The only thing is I have noticed they are better when made in a waffle iron with deep grooves.

I've been making these waffles for years because they're quick to prepare and very light: the batter is perfect for my antique waffle iron. I've made one addition: freshly grated nutmeg (it cuts down on the yeasty taste). And I do sometimes have to add a little flour before cooking if the batter is too thin. It's perfect with maple syrup, a little unsweetened whipped cream and fresh fruit!

This has been my favorite waffle recipe for years. As a sidenote to those who have found this recipe to be too "yeasty"--I've reduced the yeast to 1/2 of what the recipe calls for, and it still turns out just fine, and definitely less yeasty-tasting (I think 1 pkg. of yeast to 2 cups of flour is a pretty high ratio, actually).

I thought these waffles had a very strong yeast flavour. I followed the recipe exactly -- maybe our yeast packets in Canada are larger? Anyways, I've found another recipe that only uses 1/2 tsp of yeast and I'll try that one next.

My family's favorite waffle. I use a Belgian waffle-maker and make 12 waffles. Very crispy outside, light and souffle-like inside. Very buttery, too. I don't grease the waffle iron at all, and I never have a problem with sticking. Does soak up syrup quickly, though no one has complained about that. I love that most of the mixing is done the night before and, because the batter holds in the fridge (for a few days), each family member can make his or her waffle at whatever time he or she wakes up. I'll definitely make this again, but for health reasons I might decrease the amount of butter (as Shirley Corriher suggests as a possibility in her book containing this recipe, _Cookwise_) or substitute some canola oil.

I made this last night to bring in to work this morning. It was well received but the batter didn't rise much in the waffle iron. Not sure what happened there, maybe I just need more baking powder. Overall a good recipe but just be warned it doesn't make 8 waffles if you're using a Belgian waffle maker.

This recipe came our great with a tiny bit of tweaking as follows: increase flour by 1/2 c., increase sugar to 3 tbs. add 1 tsp vanilla or 1/2 tsp lemon flavoring. I used a belgian waffler and they were excellent. Try with powdered sugar and fresh berries.

I made the raised waffles, and I will make them again. I separated the eggs and beat the egg whites and folded them into the batter. If I had had extra egg whites in the refrig. I would have added them to the batter. I use this method with all waffle recipes.

The batter is way too thin. It produced an extermely too light & lacy waffle. It almost "deflated" when taken out of the waffle iron. It soaked up syrup and disintegrated before it could be eaten. If this waffle were bread, the only comparison I could make would be to Wonder Bread; gag me!

Waffles were only so-so, no better than from a mix so why bother. We used a belgian waffler. Waffles aren't very flavorful, not sweet enough, too airy (not substantial), and do not hold their crispness. Disappointing overall.

Finally, a truly crispy, light waffle recipe! These were great, and so easy. I substituted canola oil for part of the butter, to make it a little more heart-healthy, and it made no discernable difference in the taste. Best thing: all the mess in mixing is done the night before, so there's very little a.m. cleanup!

This is our very favorite waffle ever! So easy to make and superior to going out for waffles. I have used 1/4 less milk to make a thicker batter. I have also substituted 1/2 c soy flour for 1/2 c. of wheat flour. No difference in the taste. Try them you won't be disappointed.
