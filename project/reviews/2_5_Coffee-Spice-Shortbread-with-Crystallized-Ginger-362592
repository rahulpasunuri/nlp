I really love the flavor of this recipe. Unique and delicious. I love the contrast of the salt. The dough is very dry but that doesn't matter as you just pat it down in the tart pans. I would recommend grinding the coffee beans as finely as possible. Also I would double the frosting. I made a little bit more than the recipe called for and it was just barely enough and looked rather skimpy. I also would recommend chopping the ginger very finely and using less. I think its flavor overwhelms the cookie.

Glad I read a few reviews before making this one. I was at least prepared to add some liquid to the flour /butter mix since, as most reviewers pointed out, it was too dry to spread. So, I added a bit of cream (2 tsp). The first batch (don't have two pans) worked out well enough, but the second stuck to the pan and most of the shortbread was lost. Nice coffee flavour but may be too intense for some. Unfortunately, I don't plan to make this one again.

I loved this recipe. I found though (like others)that the binding of the dry ingredients with the butter never really started to form. No problem though...knowing it was a short bread with tons of butter, I took the ingredients and pressed them into the pans. This worked out just find as I pressed them with a mallet covered with tin foil so it would not stick. I also didn't have two 9" tart pans so I used 2, 9" springform pans and they worked perfectly. I didn't have any problem lifting them off the pan base but I did cut them into rectangles about 3/4" wide by 2" long so there would be more. The excess from the rounds were great little bites... This is not a really sweet cookie... but with the crystallized ginger on top of the glaze it's delicious combo!

Thought these would be great after looking at the recipe in the magazine. I added more ginger, cinnamon and used just 2 tbsp's of coffee and still ended up with a cookie that tastes more like something to have with a cup of coffee. No problems with baking. Added some more ginger to the icing and still didn't feel that it was "gingery" enough.

I had none of the prior issues with this recipe! I made as written, except for adding the crystallized ginger into the cookies, instead of saving it for on top. Just frosted at the end then. The "dough" is extremely crumbly when mixed, but once patted into the tart pan, baked up beautifully. These have a really nice almost chewy texture, and lots of ginger flavor. I do think I might increase the coffee, cinnamon and cardamom next time, as they did get a bit lost in the ginger.

I want to update my review of 12/17/10. These have become strangely addictive, and I definitely will make them again, with less flour, finely ground coffee, and more icing. I cut them into smallish diamond shapes. Those who don't like them probably are looking for a sweeter cookie, but I find these sophisticated and not for kids.

This is an update on my review of 12/17/10. These things really grew on me--I've decided I really like them as they've become strangely addictive. Next time I'll use more butter and less flour, and finely ground coffee. I cut them into diamond shapes, quite small. I'll use more icing too, but will definitely make them again. The people that don't like them are probably looking for a sweeter more conventional shortbread, but these have a certain caché, I think.

I thought these were too dry and crumbly, even tho I increased the butter to 2.5 sticks and decreased the flour to 2.5 cups. They were more like a biscotti than a shortbread. I used ginger liqueur instead of water for the icing, but the chopped crystallized ginger didn't stick well. It needed more icing. I cut them into diamond shapes. Definitely use finely ground coffee, otherwise there is a somewhat gritty texture. I'll go back to the Rosemary Shortbread on this site--much better for a sophisticated cookie.

This was awful. I ate a couple of bits, gave a couple to my friend... we both looked at each other, and threw the entire thing away. I can't remember when I have ever done that. Bummer

Wish I'd checked these reviews before trying this out. The dough, when prepared as specified with 2 cups of flour and 2 sticks of butter, comes out really dry. It would barely come together into a ball, so I pressed it into the pan and hoped for the best. It seemed to never get brown at the edges, but browned all over instead, so that I overbaked one of the pans. Even the icing seems off -- I'd have used half a teaspoon of vanilla, not a whole. The final result tasted ok, but is nowhere near as delicious as the photo made it look. Pretty bummed.

This recipe has good potential but the measurements are off. I added extra butter, but this may have been needed because the typo in the flour amount online meant I added too much of that. But the spices are wonderful and the coffee adds a nice crunch. I melted dark chocolate on top instead of glaze and added a sprinkle of toffee bits which sweetened it up a bit. A great recipe for a sophisticated cookie.

Typo in the on-line recipe; magazine shows 2 Cups Flour. Reduced the espresso-grind coffee to 2T. Wonderful!

I found these to be spicy and delicious--BUT I don't think they are really a cookie that would be loved by the masses. More of a foodie cookie.. If I made them again, I would just use 2 T of coffee and use something finely ground. I think the dryness is from the baking time being a bit long...mine were a bit tough to cut around the edges of the pan, but the center was just fine.

I made these and everyone in my office loved them. The spices and coffee make for a very intense flavor. I will definitely make these .

I think this is a very good shortbread recipe and a little different. Thought they had a lot of great flavor. I use French roast coffee. Maybe the coffee flavor makes a difference? Would definitely make again.

I thoroughly enjoyed this. I expected fall flavors of ginger and cardamom, which are delicious, yet strong. I do not think it's too dry, it's crunchy and not overly buttery. The coffee flavor was subtle compared to the other flavors. Great holiday recipe, if you like cardamom and ginger, make this!

These are just weird. The coffee taste is quite strong. The taste is much improved with the glaze and ginger added. The execution and consistency were fine -- no troubles cutting at all, and the shortbread texture is perfect. That said, the flavor is just a bit too intense, especially for children.

I read the previous reviews while I was in the middle of making these as the dough seemed very dry. So I added another 1/2 stick of butter to the flour mixture and let it process for quite some time until it was really holding together. Turned out pretty good and I love the candied ginger. But don't know if I would make these again.

I have to say that shortbread is one of my favorite cookies to make, and I'm quite a coffee drinker, so I was excited to make this and was promptly disappointed. The flavors are good and not too sweet, if you use good, fresh spices, but the texture is WAY too dry making it impossible to cut into wedges. So if you're into shortbread brittle, go for it. Next time I'll add the spices and coffee to my go-to shortbread recipe (the pistachio shortbread in the green menu).

i had to substitute cinnamon and nutmeg for the cardamom but the coffee really makes this bitter and I'm a coffee drinker. I would probably back that down by half if i made it again.
