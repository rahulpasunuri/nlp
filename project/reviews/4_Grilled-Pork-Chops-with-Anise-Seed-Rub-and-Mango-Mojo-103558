Made this dish exactly as directed and it was fantastic. The mango mojo is a versatile topping and could be used multiple places. Anise seed was challenging to find in my market until I found it in the ethnic section of spices for Hispanic foods. Love the anise flavor, but it is still very subtle. I do believe that getting the fresh ripe mango is the key for the sauce. Hubby says to save this dish as one of his favorites!

I made this for a dinner party over the week-end and everyone loved it. Rather than use pork chops, I had a whole pork loin (not tenderloin) that I put the rub on and let it marinate for 14 hours. My husband grilled it over mesquite and then cut it into thick slices. Can't wait to make it again!

This rub is fantastic! I use it all the time. I really like it on a pork tenderloin and baked. I suspect it would also be good on poultry. The mojo is good but not necessary. I like to serve this pork with a spicy yellow rice.

Rub was simple and suprisingly good. I was just so-so on the mango mojo. We actually preferred the pork without it and put the mojo on some black beans.

Made recipe as specified except for less salt in the mojo. The mojo was great with the pork but I think the mango I used was not ripe enough and the limes I used were quite bitter. If those ingredients were better the mojo would have been really good. The pork rub is Delicious. May be I will try with cumin to see the difference. Will make again!

Wow - the spice rub in this recipe is amazing. The first time, I made this, I followed the recipe instructions and thought it was pretty darned good.

Rating: 4
I missed an important note in my earlier review - for the mojo use less than half the salt indicated. You can always add more if you need it but I think using the amount indicated would actually ruin the the mojo. I am also rating the recipe again so the blend of my 3 and 4 stars will give it a 3 1/2 which is what it deserves.

This was a great recipe with nice flavor. I was having a party so I used a pork loin instead of chops. It marinated for about 3 hours. Based on previous reviewed I substituted anise for cumin, I made one mojo with jalapenos and one without and I didn't puree the mango mojo because I prefer it chunky. Really wonderful recipe.

I made this exactly per the recipe and it turned out great! Very easy. I've been doing a lot of grilling lately and this is one of my favorites. We're going to bring our tiny Weber grill to our friend's apartment this weekend and make it for her family.

This is a great recipe  so easy and quick. I made it pretty much exactly as it was written, once just for myself and then once for myself and my wife, who loved it. I also grilled some asparagus (my first of the season!) to go with it as the recipe recommends and they went beautifully together. I like the idea, as other reviewers have suggested, of making a chutney rather than a puree so Ill try that next time. Either way, Ill be making this a lot  it looks especially good for outside lunches in the summer as you can make pretty much everything the night before and just prepare the meat and cook it on the day so it doesnt really matter how many you are cooking for. Superb.

Delicious and quick -- what more can you ask for? My 6 year old foodie commented that there was 'something different' about the pork. Standout flavors. Didn't have anise seeds, used fennel instead. Also, I blended the lime juice, garlic, jalapeno and salt (only 1/2 tsp) in a mini processor then poured over the large dice mango and minced cilantro to make a chutney instead of a puree (more interesting to eat). It made a nice presentation. Will make sure to have anise seeds on hand from now on. A keeper recipe.

What a delicious recipe! It was so moist and thoroughly delightful! My Italian husband was hard-pressed to guess anise and he loved it. I did cut the salt in half in the mango mojo. It looked so pretty diced like a salsa, and I dread blenders, so I left it unblended, and I highly recommend it! It looked and tasted great. One of these times I'll blend out of curiosity! I also marinated the chops for a few hours in the fridge, turning a few times. After grilling directly, I moved them off to the side without coals, but very close to them, covered my grill and vents, and cooked about 5 more minutes on each side. They were perfect.

An excellent way to freshen up pork. Needed more time on the grill, an extra 10 minutes to cook through!

I was looking for a quick pork chop recipe -- talk about a pleasant surprise! Used fennel seeds, and replaced cilantro with parsley(that's all I had in the frigdge), used less sugar and a lot less salt, but an extra clove of garlic -- was delicious. I will be making this for Father's Day!

What a find! Made this on the spur of the moment on a hot weekend night for family but would definitely make again (soon!) for company. As others have said, though, do watch the salt in the mojo. I thought I must have inadvertently doubled it so made a second batch with no salt and combined them. That was about right. Otherwise perfect! Moist, juicy, delicious.

Rating: 4
Delectible. I was hesitant, the idea of anise seed with meat? Glad I listened to reviews. It was amazing. I made two batches of the Mojo, one with jalapeno and one without for the kiddos...and they LOVED it. Leftover mojo was used on everything in sight until it was all gone!

My whole family loved this recipe - very flavorful and moist. I did marinate it for a couple of hours in the rub before grilling. Mojo was great with the chops - it added another dimension to the dish - both in flavor and presentation.

Even though we added too much jalapeno and cilantro, this dish was amazing. The flavors were complex and complimented each other very, very well. I am sure that the mango mojo would also be a good topper on a lot of things but I thought that the anise balanced it wonderfully. I didn't have a totally ripe mango, though it was flavorful, so it didn't come out super sweet though I believe that I will leave it that way. Truely wonderful.

Rating: 3
I would give this dish 3 1/2 forks. It is really very simple to make and we love the unusual/complex flavors. I made this dish as per recipe with fabulous results and the other night I only had half a mango and added a ripe pear to make up the difference. It was gobbled up by all.

Rating: 4
The best company dinner ever! I have made this so many times I can't count and everyone loves it. I don't use as much salt as called for in the mojo and depending on who is coming I cut back on the jalapeno. I also marinated the pork chops for a couple of hours. You can't go wrong serving this dish.

Rating: 4
We LOVED this! Next time I will cut the salt way down though as we found it a little salty, but then we don't usually add much salt. I did have to modify the Mojo as I didn't have a mango (and no Sunday shopping in Nova Scotia!) so I subbed one nectarine and two plums, having read other reviews I decided to not risk a too tart taste with the lime juice (and no super ripe mango to offset it) so I subbed 1/3 C black rum for it. It turned out great anyway! Definitely company fare as well as wonderful for everyday meals. The rub and Mojo (I will try it with a mango when I have one!) would also be excellent on chicken or white fish.

Rating: 4
One of my all time favorites and my favorite pork recipe by far. I'm not a black licorice fan but the anise in this recipe is outstanding. I make this often and here are a few minor changes I made that work great for me. I buy a pork loin and cut it into thick (anout 1 1/4 inch) chops. They take slightly longer to grill but boy do they look impressive and turn out juicy. I also make the mojo with a can of Goya mango nectar and a pears instead of a fresh mangos. Pears are easy to dice and they soften very nicely when simmered with the other incredients and a full can of mango nectar. I find it easier to make and is just as good as the original mango version. Grill up this dish and your friends will be sure to make the "this is as good as any meal I could get at a restaurant" comment.

This was very easy to prepare, and everyone ATTACKED the food once they gave it a try. Don't be intimidated by the anise-seed rub. It has the aroma of black jellybeans, which some guests didn't care for. But once the food was grilled, all was forgiven. Awesome.

A great Cuban dish! I loved the combination of cilantro, lime and jalapeno in the mango mojo. I recommend making the mojo a day in advance to allow the ingredients to blend together.

Wow - excellent flavors! Didn't care for the yellow goo look of the mojo in the photo so I put all the sauce ingredients minus the fruit in the blender (added 3T mango preserves), then stirred in diced mango for a chunky salsa. Anise rub is superb!

This is an excellent recipe for pork chops. I'd be nice if they specified how big of a mango to use - I used 3/4 of a large mango and had to add more jalapeno because the mango totally overpowered it.

My husband, who always used to say he doesn't like Anise, really enjoyed this recipe. I made the rub in the morning, left the pork in the fridge all day soaking up the flavors. And it only took me a few minutes to make the mojo at dinner time. Had dinner on the table in 30 minutes. Bet the mojo would be equally good on grilled fish and chicken.

This is an excellent dish for those who like something a little diffent. I have fixed it several times now with rave reviews everytime. I think this dish was well balanced with all the flavors except I also make the Mango Salsa to ganish the meat. It compliments the Mojo nicely and adds some extra punch to an already good recipe as well as it gives a very nice presentation. I even add a jalapeno to the salsa being we like it "spiced up" a little, so if you perfer leave it out. You might have to experiment with both to get it to your individual taste, but I agree, it will depend on how ripe your mango is and how hot the peppers are. For being so simple to make, it sure impresses the ones who will be devouring it as it hits the table! It's definitely a keeper!

Rating: 4
My husband made this for a dinner party--our guests loved it! We will definitely make this again. He used pork tenderloin, as that's what we had on hand, & marinated it in the rub for about 3 hours. For the mojo sauce, the flavor will vary greatly depending on how ripe your mangoes are & how hot your jalapeno is, so you'll need to adjust according to your taste. We needed a little more mango for the flavor to be right. For the cook who asked about their mojo sauce being tart, you're right, it should be sweet. Yours may have been tart because your mangoes weren't fully ripe.

I loved this recipe. I made it for company and everyone loved it. I wouldn't use all of the jalapeno pepper this recipe called for at once. I went ahead and put a whole Tbls in and it was way too hot. Next time I will just use a little at a time.

Major Mojo - loved it. Flavours complemented each other nicely. Great presentation too - simple and suitable for guests. A keeper.

Just made this excellent dish for the first time last week. The mojo was a great leap from the standard apple based sauce. If your worried about the heat, you have to taste the jalapeno when your slicing it up. I find the intensity veries greatly from pepper to pepper, and seasonally. The Mango does knock down the heat a little if you're worried. I also massaged the rub into the meat and let it rest for a few hours before it hit the grill. Easy and quick to prepare, and just a flat-out great dish.

This was good, also easy to prepare. Looks fabulous, but I thought the mango puree would be sweet? Mine was tart. Followed the recipe to the T. Can someone tell me if the puree is supposed to be sweet or not? Would like to try this again. Thanks!

DELISH! I disagree with the singapore cook. The mango majo perfectly balances the anise seed on the pork. I made extra mojo and the next day I wrapped shrimp in bacon, grilled and served it with side of mojo to dip. My guest devoured. I perferred the shrimp to pork, but I do in general. I am also a mango maniac, but even if you're not try this one!

Fabulous! This was very easy to make. I don't have a grinder so I just used whole anise seed and ground pepper and it was great - the pork had a nice crust on the outside. My husband, who is picky eater, loved it and even my one year old ate his up (minus the mojo)! The two flavors together were fantastic! One word of caution, though, the mango flavor is easily overpowered, so be careful. I will definitely make this again!

Rating: 2
I think the title of this recipe should be Mango Mojo with Grilled Pork Chops with Anise-seed rub. I thought the sauce totally overpowered the subtle flavouring of the anise-seed. It was easy to make, and I will definitely follow the suggestion of the reviewer below to use the extra sauce for a vinaigrette - great idea - probably with grilled shrimp.

Rating: 4
In the words of JJ Walker, this dish was DI-NO-MITE!!!!! I love fresh jalapenos, but am not too, too crazy about mango. The rub was great. I prepped the loin chops about 4 hours prior to grilling, and they were flavorful and tender. The mojo has quite a bit of ZING to it, but not overdone. The mango is a great delivery medium for the cilantro and jalapeno. The only word of caution I have is, depending on your spice grinder, do the peppercorns and the anise seeds without the other rub ingredients. I use a Kitchenaid coffee grinder that works great and is a breeze to clean, but the salt and sugar came out the side, so be careful. This is going to be a regular staple at my house from now on!

Superb! I like to experiment, so I only repeat recipes if they are fantastic and I have made this recipe a number of times with rave reviews from all. Among the best grill recipes that I have found.

This was a delightful surprise and quite easy to prepare. My mother was impressed (she's quite the cook) and my husband and children literally wiped their plates clean.

The mojo makes any pork unbelievable. I didn't have jalapenos so I added a bit of crushed red pepper which worked well, and had to add spices to it including a bit of allspice and ginger. It was wonderful and worked with the anise on the pork chops wonderfully. I used boneless center cut chops on a grill pan and they weren't too dry. One of my favorite recipies on this site so far!

What a well rounded meal. The Mango Mojo was absolutely fantastic and a great match to the anise and black pepper rub. I will admit that my rub only consisted of 1/2 tbs. of anise(would recommend that you not skimp here and use the full tablespoon), but was still quite flavorful. Can never stress this enough, but be sure to use all fresh ingredients: fresh limes, cilantro and especially the rub ingredients(pepper corns and anise).

This recipe gets a 3 because the mojo was so good. The chops were so-so - I didn't have the rave reviews that normally accompany my epicurious dishes. One suggestion on the mojo - cut back on the pepper - wow it was spicy. Overall I will be making this dish again - especially the mojo!

WOW! What a wonderful meal! My husband proclaimed it one of my top 10. The only thing I will do differently next time is leave the anise rub on for a couple of hours before preparing..really like the taste of anise and would have liked it to be more pronounced. Don't know how I got by without Epicurious. I have made many, many wonderful meals from these pages. Thanks!

About once a month it's my turn to cook for our weekly dinner party. This by far has to be the best dish I cooked thus far. The dish, in my opinion, needs no altering. It's perfect as it is. I served it with a black bean/rice dish and the suggested grilled asparugus which I thought were excellent accompaniments. I look forward to making it again.

Absolutely delicious. I served the pork with grilled asparagus spears and wild rice and only made one substitution. I didn't have any chiles on hand, so I utilized one heaping tablespoon of spicy salsa that contained garlic and cilantro as well.

I made this recipie for a group of 12 women. I bought some pretty huge center cut pork loin chops and was afraid half would be wasted. However, they scarfed it all up. I got lots of compliments. I'll definitely make it over and over again. One suggestion I have would be to add some brandy or even bourbon to the Mango mojo. It was good as precribed, but a little bland for my taste. Also you can double the # of chops and still have plenty of Mango sauce.

This is a favorite at our house. My husband and I both like it extra spicy so we add more jalapenos. Be sure to use a mango that is ripe and soft for best taste. If you don't want to grind spices use Jamaican allspice, it has everything you need and you can buy it at Trader Joe's or Whole Foods. Serve with wild rice and asparagus.

This was delicious! I did not use salt in the mojo and the chops were salty enough that I don't think it needed more. The chops had a great flavor and I would make it even without the sauce. I cooked them over a gas grill and it was very moist and tender. Definitely a keeper recipe!

I wasn't very crazy about this recipe. I've never had a mojo sauce before, but I thought it was overly salty (definately go with the salt to taste rather than 1 tsp.). Maybe I needed to use more mango in it. The chops took a lot longer to cook than in the recipe, I used very good thick ones. I don't know, this just wasn't a big deal around our house, I was disappointed.

The mojo sauce is delicious and so easy! I've already made it twice. The first time I served it with the suggested pork- tremendous! I then tried serving it with a white- flesh fish which didn't work out so well- the sauce completely overpowered the fish. Next time I'll return to the pork.

Terrific way to do something different with pork chops. I did it on an indoor grill and it worked just as well without the suggested shifting & covering. The recipe makes a bit more mojo than needed (I made 6 pork chops & still had plenty of leftover sauce), but I'm sure it would work well with other grilled foods.

Terrific recipe and easy!!! This mojo was fantastic. I added more jalapeno and lime juice plus papaya with the mango, superb. I will make this again very soon.
