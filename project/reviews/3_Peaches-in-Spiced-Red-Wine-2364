This was a great refreshing dessert, but just don't overdo the cardamom! I put fresh blackberries in with my peaches, and they were excellent. I can imagine fresh raspberries with the peaches as well.

A perfect ending to a summer meal--takes advantage of the local peach crop without a lot of effort. And the calorie content is relatively low. The wine marinade is delicious too.
