I clipped this recipe 17 years ago, and just got around to trying it for our 24th anniversary yesterday. Hubby is a confirmed chocolate fiend, but agreed that this recipe made our all star list for special occasions. I used fresh mango, papaya, and banana and some leftover canned, crushed pineapple that I had frozen. The pineapples tartness was an excellent contrast to the other sweeter fruits, and I found I also appreciated the contrast in its shape and texture. Our patio tree yields a fresh supply of super ripe and juicy limes, so I omitted straining the lime juice, with no adverse effect. I was out of crystallized ginger, so I substituted fresh frozen. Just scraped the skin off a generous inch, and sliced it into 1/4 medallions. I planned to remove the ginger from the sauce before serving, but it tasted phenomenal, so I just minced it up and returned the bits to the sauce pan. Next time Ill just use minced fresh ginger to start with, as it compliments the fresh fruits and lime juice nicely.

This was delicious. The combination of flavors, the relative ease of preparation (and the fact that you really can do everything ahead if you want)...make this recpie a keeper. Definitely will make again. yum.

This is a fantastic and easy way to impress your dinner guests! Very delicious and a way to good top off my Thai menu. Made the sauce a day ahead, so this was a snap. Couldn't find any nice crispy coconut cookies to serve with it, so I used Pepperidge Farm Bordeaux cookies. A Winner!

I made this dessert in 1990 for an outside dinner party. It received so many compliments that I am going to make it again this summer for a Carribean party. You can prepare all of it in advance- even the ice cream balls can be made and put into the freezer until serving time.

I felt like I was on an island. Great end to the Turkey dinner we had. I chose a pineapple topping on vanilla ice cream, but the sauce is the real standout here.
