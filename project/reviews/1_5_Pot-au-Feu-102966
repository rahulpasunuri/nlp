I don't know what "real" pot au feu" tastes like, so I can't comment on that. What I can comment on is that this recipe produces a bland, watery flavor. Would not make again.

Sorry to say but not very good at all. There is a fantastic recipe in the Gourmet Cookbook that is truely something special. Something to cook for a big group of friends just to show you like them. This one though, pretty bad.

There are much better pot au feu recipes out there. The florist should stick to flower pots.

Pot au feu MUST have rosemary. That´s what gives the soup it´s typical, traditional taste.

Since this recipe is more pot roast and less pot-au-feu, I'd save myself a lot of trouble next time by using the called for ingredients and making it in a crock pot. It was tasty, just too time consuming Find a 'real' pot-au-feu recipe for pot-au-feu.

hmm...I loved this recipe. The meat was incredibly tender and tasty, and the broth...c'est magnifique! Ut took time, but it was well worth it. I'm already planning to make it again, next cool, rainy day.
