very tasty, I use chipotle flavored tabasco for a tastier kick. A weekly favorite of mine

I really enjoyed this, though I did make quite a few changes. From the recipe, it sounds like they're going for an avocado salsa, but I couldn't think of any good reason why I wouldn't just turn it into guacamole and add some minced garlic to the list. Then I also added the chicken from the "cilantro-lime chicken fajitas with grilled onions" recipe also on this site, slicing the chicken into chunks prior to marinating, then sauteeing for 5-6 minutes or so and throwing the chicken in. It was amazingly good, and definitely a keeper!

Very good salsa and i am not an avocado lover. I didn't have cilantro so just used plain sour cream. I didn't use Tabasco either and this was still great so won't bother next time either mixing up the sour cream.

Super fast to make and has a nice tart and creamy flavor. I would without a doubt make this again.

Very tasty (I don't give 4 forks except to OUTSTANDING) Used lime instead of lemon juice as that was what was on hand. Either would probably be good.

Lovely! I added shrimp and romano cheese to the Monterey Jack mix. The depth of flavors is evident. I will make this often.

This is a good recipe for avocado quesadillas. Next time, I will use lime juice instead of lemon and diced jalapenos instead of Tabasco. The tabasco gave the avocado mixture a tart flavor, which I was not crazy about. Very easy and definitely satisfied my craving!

Easy, fast and tasty! Mixed cilantro with tomato/avacado/onion/lemon juice mixture 1/2 hour ahead and let the flavors meld...mmm Next time I added shrimp for my husband who loved that variation.

This was really good, and fairly simple to make, although you have to watch the broiling carefully. It is really filling, so don't worry about not having enough.

I'm a little bummed out that I didn't like this as much as everyone else did. My husband loved it, though, so maybe I was having an off night. I think I'll make it again and increase the heat a bit, as others suggested.

my mom planned on eating only half... but she ate it all... mumbling and savouring each bite with her eyes closed. a little strange for me to see, actually... but anyway, she says she's on a diet. oh well! oh, btw, i didn't have cilantro, so used fresh mint instead. surprisingly, it turned out well.

This was yummy and most importantly easy. I added jalpenos which gave it the right kick. I did not have coriander on hand, I also did not brush the tortillas with oil, they still came out cripsy. It still was delicious. I will definitely make this again, especially for my vegetarian friends.

this was a tasty, simple dinner.

This recipe works great for an after-school snack, and is worth making just for the sourcream topping.

The technique is the great thing about this recipe. I read several others and I liked the broiling thing. I, too, varied the ingredients. Avacado and a great local fresh hot salsa.Other possibilities are infinite. The sour cream with cilantro can be used to enhance many other dishes, too.

It wasnt quite spicy enough the first time I made it, so the next round we added some jalapenos. Perfect. Plus as someone else already stated, I used Chuola hot sauce instead of tabasco - definitely better flavor

yum bloody yum. if you make it into a burrito it is a lot less complicated and time consuming and still tastes fresh and tasty. i added tilapia tossed in olive oil and broiled. we all enjoyed it.

I used Chalula hot sauce instead of tabasco (it has more flavor. YOu can also cut up some chicken pieces, pan cooked with lemon pepper and taco seasoning( make sure the chicken paices are very small (about one breast ) and throw that into the mix!! It went over witha bang!!!!!!

this is o.k.but the word or the ingredient is cilantro for corriander. i am from mex and my maid uses serano chilies and cilantro.

Nice flavor with just the right amount of heat. I sprayed the tortillas with lowfat cooking spray to reduce fat and speed up cooking, which worked very nicely, everyone complimented on them.

This was excellent, easy to prepare and very tasty. My only suggestion would be to use larger tortillas and perhaps a little less cheese. Highly recommended.

This was really easy and incredibly tasty. I used what I had around the house. I used a lime instead of a lemon and no tabasco sauce. I also used a 4 cheese Mexican mixture. I would definetly do this again.

Ahh, to die for. Quick, easy, delicious. A meat lover myself, I added previously sautéed shrimp to the recipe and it was superb.
