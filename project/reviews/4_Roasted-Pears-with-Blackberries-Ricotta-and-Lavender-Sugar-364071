Served it with fresh ricotta and felt the ricotta needed a bit of flavoring to go with the roasted fruit. Otherwise it was good and definitely use the lavender sugar.

Fantastic! I skipped the lavender and drastically cut down on the sugar. Whipped lemon zest, agave syrup and black pepper into the ricotta and it was out of this world.

While the flavors in this recipe are good, the cooking times are all off; they can all be shortened, especially the 8 minute broiling time. My pears were burning after 3 minutes, so watch them carefully during this step. Also, I highly recommend lining the baking sheet with foil, as the sugar hardens quite a bit during cooking and can make for a difficult clean-up.

This was delicious. I used Bosc pears that were pretty firm and they softened up nicely (I cut them into eight pieces instead of four). The lavender sugar was an excellent touch, although 8 minutes under the broiler was too long and some thinner pieces started to burn-- next time I would start checking it at 3 or 4 minutes. Frozen blackberries and ricotta were perfect additions; wouldn't change a thing. A very elegant and easy dish!

This recipe is delicious! It's essential that you get quality ricotta, it makes a world of difference. We did not get the chance to stop by Dean and Deluca so we made the dessert without the lavendar sugar, but it was still divine!
