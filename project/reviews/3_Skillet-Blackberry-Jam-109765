I need a little more direction on this. I just put it into a shallow bowl, covered the bowl with wax paper, and put in fridge to chill for 30 minutes. Now what? It tastes great! But it is a bit soupy perhaps and I feel concerned and I would like some additional feedback. Please help?

I had never made jam before, and thought: "Wow! This is too easy! That's all it takes?". Yes, it only took 15 minutes. However, I found that I needed much less sugar than the recipe called for because I picked my own berries, which were way sweeter than the organic ones at Whole Foods, so taste as you mix in the sugar. I also decided to use a little honey for a slightly more complex flavor. The seeds weren't a problem for me!

We love this jam -- our family makes it several times each blackberry season, and have always had great success with it. Yes, it can be seedy, and the sweetness really does depend on the berries. My daughter & I have also made this jam with frozen berries from Costco -- thaw them first in the skillet, and it is wonderful.

just so so, easy, but too seedy and not sweet enough for my liking...will experiment with other berries next time.

I have made two batches of this recently with fresh picked blackberries. It is sooooo good, you can just eat it with a spoon! I have so far had it on toast, over ice cream and on pbj's.... all wonderful. And, it only takes about 15 min. to prepare. Great treat to preserve the wonderful berries after berry picking!

This was a great "refrigerator" jam! I did, however, use strawberries, and it still turned out great. Don't know if it was because I used strawberries instead of blackberries, but it didn't really "stand up" when it was fully cooled. Didn't mind, though! Still was great on toast, drizzled over cheesecake and angel food cake, etc...awesome!
