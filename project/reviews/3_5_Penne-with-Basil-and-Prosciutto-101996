Rave reviews from my family...hubby, 5 year old, and 18 month old! I also sauteed the prosciutto and added sauteed asparagus and halved cherry tomatoes. The heat from the pasta gave the tomatoes a nice flavor & texture. My husband and I like spice so we sprinkled red pepper flakes on ours. Yum!

I sauteed the proscuitto a bit before I added it to the pasta as another reviewer suggested. I also added some fresh asparagus tips which I sauteed along with the proscuitto. It was delicious and we had a vegetable too.

Tasty. Easy to make and delicious.

What a pleasure to find such an easy recipe that produces such outstanding results, and particularly rewarding to use fresh basil from the garden. If you make it just as written, you will be able to savor each individual flavor since none overwhelm the others. I think this would also be good at room temperature, and I may try it as a pasta salad for picnics and potlucks.

When I'm looking for something quick and good to eat, I make this. My kids like it and it's simple. I took another reviewer's idea and I cook the prosciutto a little before adding it the pasta. Yum.

I've been making this recipe regularly for a couple of years now. I've only made one small ingredient change and one slight assembly change: I heat the olive oil in a pan and add some crushed red pepper and heat it up. I add the drained pasta to that and mix it well then add the other ingredients and toss. It's one of our favourites!

Deceptively simple. I'll definitely make this one again.

Very simple to make and enjoyed by the adults as well as the kids. I did add a little sun dried tomatoes and next time I would add more proscuitto.

This recipe proves simplicity usually leads to delicious results. I added some sun-dried tomatoes - great suggestion. My wife was adamant about not eating anything for supper since she had already snacked (one of her bad habits). But when she heard me oohing and aahing during supper, she came over and helped herself to my plate.

Very easy but good. Great if you're trying to throw something together quickly.

I absolutely love this dish! Sometimes the prosciutto can be saltier than other times. I highly recommed chopping it in small pieces and lightly sauteeing them them in olive oil until slightly crisp. The flavor is enhanced by this method, plus it eliminates that chewy texture that prosciutto can have. You don't have to be exact with the ingredients. Save some of the pasta water in case you need it after adding the parmesan cheese. Can get dry.

I added sun dried tomatoes to give it a little more umph. Very yummy and summery! P.s. to the cook from Mexico - never add salt when cooking with prosciutto - it already is salted!!

Although it cools quickly, this is a must in our house when we want to eat real food, but don't want to cook. Beware: microwaving leftovers creates an oil slick.

I tried this recipe and it was ok. It turned out to be a little bit salty even though I added a very small amount of salt and I cooked the pasta without salt. Next time I try it I will not add any salt. Prosciutto and the cheese add enough salt to the dish. Aside from that, it is a very easy and tasteful way to eat pasta.

Delicious and simple! A great way to use the abundance of summer basil. I'll definitely make it again.
