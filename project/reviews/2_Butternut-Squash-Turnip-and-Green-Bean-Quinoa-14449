Simple, natural, and so good. It's beautiful to look at on the plate - the orange of the butternut squash, the green of the beans, the white of the turnips... Highly recommended for vegans, vegetarians, and natural food lovers as a one-course meal. Not a recipe for those looking for strong seasoning or flavoring outside the grain and veggies themselves. I salted it at the end, which I do believe it needs. I didn't get the need to steam the already-cooked quinoa. One modification I made was to steam the scallions a little rather than add them raw. Make sure you cube the veggies small, per the recipe.

This has to the most bland dish I have ever tried. Some cheese would help and some herbs too. This recipe is ok if you are on a strict weight reduction diet.

Blah. I made this to showcase some lovely little turnips from the farmer's market and was disappointed. It was simply boring. However, the leftovers made a nice soup with the addition of some broth and chicken, so it wasn't a total loss. I would not make this dish again.

We felt it needed more garlic,but otherwise we felt it was a great dish.
