This recipe is winner in our kitchen. So quick and easy to make, and so delicious. I love chicken thighs... the health benefits of white meat and the savory taste of dark. Make sure to reduce as to caramelize the garlic and celery. We enjoy it with rice.

I was very excited to make this, but it did not turn out nearly as well as I had hoped and expected. I had some trouble searing the chicken well -- the skin kept getting stuck to the pan and shrinking up. Also it took about 45 minutes to fully cook (not 25) although I had used full chicken legs, not just thighs. The chicken was partially cooked well but parts were very dry, and overall had minimal flavor. If I made again I would use more salt and pepper and maybe just the thighs, not the full legs. Overall it was fine, but not delicious.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I was looking for something simple that I could make with what I had in the kitchen already, and it ended up being amazing - the sauce was very flavorful and I am not ashamed to say I licked my plate. Like other reviewers, I found that I had to simmer the chicken much longer than 20 minutes. I will definitely be making this again soon.

Just okay. It would help to use a lot less than 1 cup of water, and... But as another reviewer said, when you start making a lot of changes, it's not the same recipe at all, so comments would be irrelevant.

This was such a pleasant surprise. I never cook without an onion but against my better judgement followed the recipe to a T. Wonderful flavor, great sauce, satisfies the soul. One of my go to recipes for family and guests.

This is a great evening-before-going-grocery-shopping recipe. Nothing called for that's not typically at hand. I cooked the chicken a bit over twice as long as the recipe called for, as the pastured chickens I've been getting kinda needs the extra braising time. I didn't find that the broth imparted a ton of flavor to the chicken, but the chicken's nice and flavorful already. And by itself, the broth's deeeelicious; the cooked celery & garlic are also yummy. Served it with roasted carrots and steamed buttered brocc as sides and Mr H was happy. I'll doubtlessly make this again.

I was actually surprised by how good this was -- I didn't expect celery, garlic and salt/pepper to create such a complex sauce. Definitely use all the salt and pepper (even though it seems like a lot) -- it makes a "crust" on the chicken skin that really works. Like others, I cooked the chicken longer than the recipe called for.

My husband and I both absolutely fell in love with this recipe and he's been requesting it at least once a month since it came out in the magazine. It is so simple to make and so delicious! I cook almost every recipe out of Gourmet and Food & WIne magazine but this one is definitely requested more often than all others put together! Enjoy!

I made this with white wine and thought it was great. My hubby, who's more traditional, asked for me to try it with the red wine. I did so a few weeks later and have to admit it was delicious (possibly better?). Either way, it was a great recipe.

Coming from someone who used to spend ANY amount of money just so that I could follow each recipe to a 'T', this is a perfect meal for a family that is truly struggling financially, but does not want to sacrifice quality, 'gourmet' meals. It may not be the traditional coq au vin, but it sure is nice having this option when I literally can not spend any money this week on additional ingredients!

I only had 4 thighs so I reduced the garlic and celery but kept everything else the same. I made it with the olive oil mashed potatoes. This coq au vin was wonderful. It's a perfect, quick dish for when you don't have much available "active" time. The juices/wine/water reduce to a beautiful creamy-looking sauce. I'll be making this again when I'm in a lazy-to-cook mood.

Rating: 3
Overall, a good concept. However, I would not use solely celery as the receipe suggests. This one could've used some other veggies like carrots, parsnips, or maybe brussel sprouts. I would make this again, but definitely try some other vegetables.

Nothing like a traditional coq au vin, really, but so good, so easy, so quick and made with ingredients I always have on hand. I made it in the 30 minutes that my kids have a snack before we read to them and we ate just after they went to bed. I made it exactly as written except for substituting chicken broth for the water. Fabulous.

This was a quick and easy dish. Interesting use of celery. Mashed potatoes def the way to go with this.

Very easy prep. I substitued chicken broth instead of water. Try removing chicken when done and using an emersion blender or regular blender make a sauce from garlic, celery, wine and cicken broth. You could reduce it some if you want to thicken it but I found it not necessary. Reheats very well after time in refrigerator. I enjoyed it very much and would serve it for a dinner party

This was easy and delicious. I used the cheapest, most disgusting white wine - as it was what I had on hand (unfortunately) - and the dish still came out well. My very picky family ate it all.

I love this new light Coq au Vin, sometimes the red wine is too overpowering. I used a whole organic chicken cut into four. Made a light stock out of the neck and giblets to replace the water. Threw in the little piece of chicken fat in the pan no oil and fried the chicken skin down in that. It was tasty enough with just the garlic and the celery. Have made it a few times one guest had to ring me the next day to apologize for eating so much of it.

This isn't Coq au Vin. Too much garlic, no onions or mushrooms, and where is the thyme? It's a chicken stew and not too bad, but please don't give it a classic name that it doesn't deserve.

This was decent, but not extrodinary. I, too, substituted chicken stock for the water and added some onions along with the garlic and celery and some basil. I served over quinoa (also made with chicken stock) and some green beans on the side.

I don't care what you call it, this was delicious. I made it exactly as written except I took the lid off during the last 5 minutes to let the sauce reduce a bit, and it turned out really lovely and velvety. Served over the olive oil mashed potatoes to soak up the sauce. Flavorful, easy, simple ingredients - awesome!

This went well with a Bistro night birthday party. Used a Macon Village wine and Trader Joe's chicken stock. Added some fresh herbs and it was just right for the theme of the evening.

Delicious and a very easy one pot meal. I followed other reviewers suggestions and added a tablespoon of butter to the oil when searing the chicken, replaced water with chicken stock, and added a tablespoon or so of fresh thyme when reducing the wine. Perhaps not like real coq au vin but still tasty.

Meh... it was good, but very, very plain. For the effort that went into it, would have liked some more flavour, you know? The broth definitely needs pepping up - like some of the suggestions of using chicken stock instead of just water. It was okay, but it could be a lot better. We served it on basmati rice. In the end it was very simple tasting comfort food. I would make it again, but either use chicken stock instead of water, or throw in some more spices that I had on hand. Maybe some mushrooms too.

Rating: 3
I don't know what all the fuss is about. Judged on its taste alone, and not its name, this dish was excellent. Dusting the chicken with poultry seasoning and adding mushrooms during the simmering stage ramped up the flavor. My family loved it. They never asked me what the name of the recipe was!

This was okay... I liked it, the husband and kids hated it. I followed the recipe exactly, and although it wasn't offensive, it utterly lacked taste. The leftovers, though, made a fantastic chicken salad the next day.

I never liked traditional coq au vin because I thought the flavor of the red wine overwhelmed the chicken. This was much better! As other reviewers suggested, I added a bit of thyme and used chicken broth instead of water, and added some sliced baby bella mushrooms. I served this with a wonderful brown rice mix for a lovely fall dinner.

Another reviewer suggested calling this chicken with white wine sauce, and I agree. I used chicken broth and pinot grigio, and I finished the sauce with a tbs of butter.

An easy, simple recipe, and a good way to use up leftover celery and wine (I always seem to have some celery sadly wilting in my veggie crisper). I served it over egg noodles and it was well received.

ABOUT THE NAME: I understand the name is totally indefensible, but since I'd never made the real Coq au Vin before, I was sucked in by the name, so it served its intended purpose. ABOUT THE RECIPE: I made it as written. Absolutely amazing. You do have to make sure to really boil the wine to reduce it. Also, I agree with the poster that it needs an extra 10 minutes after you return the chx to the pan. Aside from that, I found it not at all bland and surprisingly creamy in a way I associate with traditional French cooking. I served it over a simple white (basmati) rice. Thank you, Gourmet, for devising this easy recipe, and thank you for totally and shamelessly pretending it's a classical French dish so that a novice like me would try it! Go by the ratings, fellow cooks! YUM!

Not to add fuel to the fire but the words "Coq au Vin" clearly imply French-style, with red wine, carrots (see Joy of Cooking for a semi- slowfood experience) - and even unsweetened cocoa powder in some recipes, like they make it in France. Coq au Vin is NOT Chicken with Wine. This chicken with wine recipe is one of a million variations of "Chicken with Wine". It is NOT Coq au Vin. Again, my apologies. Never thought I'd review like this but I had to, this is just wrong. And, heads up . . . any recipe on Epicurious that you have to modify the heck out of . . . well, there you go.

OK, the name is "NEW Coq au vin" get over the name! I made this on sunday and used the other reviewers tips - I added a few sprigs of thyme, 1 sprig of rosemary, used chicen stock instead of h20 and added a handful of sliced baby portobellos in the last 15 minutes of cokking. I liked how the sauce seemed velvetly, almost creamy, but there was no cream or even flour added. Very good for a family dinner - not company fare, but a nice good meal for a sunday family dinner.

Of course you can call this 'Coq au Vin' because it is, after all, a recipe for chicken cooked in wine. But after having read all the reviews and incorporated most of the suggestions, I think I'll rename it 'Stone Soup'.

People, let's not obsess over whether the name is misleading. Even what most people think of as "traditional" Coq Au Vin, is nothing like the original--which calls for an old rooster and all it's blood! By including "new" in the title should have been enough to silence the "purists." Oh by the way, the dish is a bit bland, in my opinion.

I really liked this recipe, as did my family, but I'm grateful to have read some reviews before I made it. Definitely add the bacon( sliced raw and sauteed), (shitake) mushrooms, and fresh thyme sauteed together. And add one chicken bouillon cube to the cup of water. I love it though and will make it again and again.

This recipe is not nearly as good as a traditional coq au vin. It is exceedingly bland and would benefit with the addition of a few herbs. I thought using water a bad idea so subsituted chicken broth, Even that did not perk up the flavor

No, it's not coq au vin, but for my taste, it's better. My boyfriend made it and I found it fantastic. We did get lucky, though, in that the pan was just the right size for the skin to remain above the liquid at all times. Thus, the skin was crispy. We also used very high quality chicken--organic, air chilled, etc. He also made the olive oil mashed potatoes from the same issue, but with half olive oil and half butter. Yummy! Cut the celery on a diagonal for a fancy look.

So, calling this "coq au vin" is a bit of a misnomer. "Chicken in white wine sauce" would be a better name. Either way, though, it was a tasty dinner and surprisingly quick for a weeknight. I saw that some other commenters would add some things - thyme would be tasty and maybe some mushrooms. I think it's a good dish and a good starting point for adding tasty stuff. This is not as good as the chicken and riesling dish from last year, but tasty.

We liked it as a good and easy chicken recipe, but without the burgundy,my husband refused to recognize it as coq au vin. I added oinions, carrots (when I added the celery), and seasoned the chicken with herbs de provance before searing.

An excellent recipe and a big hit. I recommend getting more than 2lbs of chicken, though. I got a 2-lb container and couldn't see how many thighs were in it, so I accidentally got only four. I added onions to the recipe and used dried parsley instead of fresh, since I don't cook with parsley all that much so I end up throwing most of it away. This will be a staple of quick cooking for me from now on!

I cannot make coq au vin without onions, thyme and bacon. I rendered 2 slices of chopped bacon and seared the chicken in the drippings (About 2 tbsps). After removing the chicken, I added the celery and 1/2 cup of chopped onions and 1 tsp of fresh thyme.Once plated I sprinkled the reserved bacon bits over the chicken to serve. These changes helped brighten an otherwise bland dish.

My family of fussy eaters really liked this dish. Perhaps it's misleading to call it coq au vin because everyone was expecting the traditional dish. I used drumsticks and carefully trimmed most of the fat off so didn't find it oily at all, as did one reader. The dish was fast and easy and I'll definitely make it again.
