i made this marinade with pork chops instead of spareribs which i broiled. i used less of the honey than called for and found it sweet enough. i substituted dijon for the dry mustard and used cider vinegar instead of white. this was a tasty recipe which was quick and easy to prepare. i served it with corn relish and white rice. i rounded out the dinner with broccoli soup mmmm!

My family loved this recipe. I didn't halve the ribs-just separated them and marinated overnight. Cutting them apart was the hardest part of the recipe. My only complaint: not enough sauce! Easy enough to prep on one weeknight and broil the next night for dinner.

The hardest part of the recipe is cutting the ribs apart. Otherwise, it's amazingly easy. I marinated the ribs overnight and they turned out very tender and tasty. My family all loved the ribs and asked me to make them again. Which I will do but I'll tinker with the recipe to add some heat and thickness to the marinade to make it more like a glaze.

Excellent!!!! My girlfriend made these. She cooked them in the oven instead of boiling them before broiling them. Absolutely would make these.

This was a great recipe. My family really enjoyed them, even fighting over the last rib.I used white wine vinegar and Dijon in the sauce then marinated them for 2hrs then covered with foil and baked them for 45mins-1hr basting about every 15 mins.The sauce was nice and thick upon completion so I didn't use the broiler on the end. I will definitely make these again.Well worth the time.

This one of our standards on our menu (we cater). To the poster complaining about the fat, this is why we remove the membrane and poach them in water first, to render alot of the fat....THEN we bake and broil them to get the nice "stick to your teeth" pork cracklin' YOWSA YOWSA YOWSA...always a hit with our clients AND staff :)

These would have to be the best ribs I've ever tasted. I used 1kg of ribs, replaced the dry mustard with 1tbs Dijon mustard and used white wine vinegar. After simmering I marinated them for about 2hrs. Then put then in a roasting tray and covered with foil and cooked them in the oven for about 45 mins. The sauce seemed thin so I mixed up some cornflour and added it to the pan. I ended up with a nice thick sauce which stuck to the ribs perfectly. I finished them off under the grill which definitely made a difference to their taste - YUM!!

Really tasty! I will make again. For the flavor of the marinade to get into the meat, marinate for more than 1 1/2 hrs (in the fridge) - used 5 pork chops, then BBQ'd. I would also suggest basting them while on the BBQ. Next time I would add dijon or mustard seeds (taste great when they have been chared)! Good cookin'.

Made these for last Super Bowl Party, and they were a huge hit. Gone before the 1st half was over. I put them on the grill instead of in the oven.

These are great! I don't agree with the cook from Las Vegas who said to use beef instead of pork - once you simmer them the fat seems to disappear! I served them along with my own recipe for chicken fried rice and szechuan vegetables, they were a perfect accompaniment! Also, I only had time to marinate them for 2 hours but the taste really came through.

I came across this recipe when I was looking for a different way to make pork ribs. Since we have liked everything cooked with Hoisin sauce that we have tried so far, I thought I would give this a try. I also used Dijon mustard instead of the dry mustard and we cooked the ribs on the BBQ instead of under the broiler. They were a hit at our house served with corn on the cob, sliced potatoes on the BBQ with bacon and onion pieces and a salad.

Put me in the "yes" column, with some reservations. One the one, the ribs are sickly-sweet; on the other, this is very easy and quick. Nice for lunch on Monday, too. I didn't have dry mustard, so added a tsp of dijon, and it worked. And chile paste avec garlic, in moderation, is nice. Perfect if you've got ribs defrosted, but not enough time to marinate overnight.

We served them as an appetizer at a dinner party with a peanut satay from Sam Choy. The ribs were very good standing alone too. They disappeared with some aggressive manuevering for the last ribs. Next time we will give the ribs a final quick grilling just before serving.

This recipe was fantastic! Family & friends just loved it! This one is a keeper for sure!

This was wonderful, BUT I will use beef ribs next time; the spare ribs just have too much fat to really taste good.(the marinade sorta hides the fat from view and it's too late when it's in your mouth)

Made this dish for the first time in 1992 when I found it in your magazine. Just spectacular. Everyone has always loved it - never a rib left. Can't believe no one else has reviewed it. It's such a keeper.
