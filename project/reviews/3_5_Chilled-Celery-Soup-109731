This recipe was very easy (except trying to filter without a sieve) but very plain. It smells and tastes like thick vegetable broth when prepared exactly as written. Giving one fork makes it sound terrible, but supposedly one fork is "fair". It is edible, but I would prefer something a little more exciting or yummy.

I made this a few times as directed and it was maybe a 3 fork recips. Then I made it with parsnips instead of the potato (same amount) and that bumped it up a fork. I also used more cayenne to my own taste. Also, rather than throwing out the solids try using it as a kind of bruschetta on baguette with a thin slice of swiss on top. I made it for a party and it went over well.

I made this because I had a lot of leftover celery and had no idea what to do with all of it. I used 5 cups of chopped celery, 3 leeks, half a red onion and a whole yellow onion. I also used 2 cups of chicken stock and 1 cup of water. Rather than dealing with a blender which is always tricky with hot liquids, I used an immersion blender in the pot before passing it through a strainer (which I agree is a key step for this to come out well). Since it is winter, I wanted a warm soup so after passing it through the strainer, I put it back in the pot over low heat. I then added some salt, a lot of freshly ground pepper and then some nutmeg, ground coriander and chinese five spice to give it a little bit of a different flavor. Considering that I don't really like celery, I'm very happy with the way this came out but before I added the different spices, I was not overwhelmed (of course that's probably because I don't really like celery). It did require a lot of labor for just soup but at least it made a big enough batch to last for a while.

I made it with chicken stock instead of the water and it tasted amazing!! It is just as good warm!

Needs a lot of salt for added flavor otherwise it tastes bland. I would definitely make this again.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. It's amazing how just those simple ingredients can produce such a great soup. Definitely strain the soup. You can just use a mesh strainer. If you don't strain, it has all of the celery strings in it. I think it would be good hot, room temperature or cold. It's a great starter for a dinner party - very impressive but easy and your guests will be trying to figure out what the flavors are.

A great light soup. The other reviewers complain that the finished product is too thick: they didn't strain the soup properly. They didn't remove enough of the solids; I threw away over a cup of solids, enough to considerably alter the texture of the soup. The straining step is the trick of this recipe, differentiating the dish from a simple celery and potato puree.

This is similar to vichyssoise, as the previous reviewer said, and is therefore a better choice for someone who wants to cut back on potato or cream but still have a dense cold soup. It came out quite thick for me, so it could easily be thinned and extended.

Made this for a picky soup fancier. Huge success. He didn't know what it was -- thought it might be a vichyssoise. Instead of forcing through a sieve, I used a food mill. Worked fine. Some might find it a bit thick, and it would be easy to thin it out with more water. Subtle, and very nice on a hot day.
