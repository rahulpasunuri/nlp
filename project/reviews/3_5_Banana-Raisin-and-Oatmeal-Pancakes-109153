I've been making these for years (per the recipe) and they are a family favorite. I even made them at my friend's bed and breakfast once and several guests asked for the recipe. I have substituted buttermilk a couple of times for the yogurt when I was out. I've never had any issues with flipping the pancakes on the griddle or getting them to cook through. I love these pancakes!

kids loved it! I made these with NF greek yofurt and NF milk. I used whole wheat flour and added apples. A healthy, high protein, fruit filled pancake. We ate them on a hike, no syrup or forks. Just ate them like a piece of toast.

No matter how slowly I tried to cook these, I couldn't get them to cook through. Very annoying, as the taste is grand. Maybe a bit less banana?

hmm.... these belong to that category of "ubermush" pancakes that seem like a dream on the recipe page but somehow don't come out anywhere near as nice :\ .... they TASTED great, but for some reason the bananas in it (i think??) made this recipe EXTREMELY soft and fluffy, unlike anything i've ever come across actually... made them impossible to flip in the pan, they came out more like "scrambled pancakes" than real rounds :( but if texture doesn't bother you at all (lol) then this is the recipe for you, they sure tasted great!

I just made these and theyre great! I love dense pancakes and these really delivered. I used blueberries and raspberries instead of rasins and bananas because rasins are gross and I'm all out bananas. They were almost like blueberry muffins but sweeter and better. I made a couple switches. I used 2/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup wipping cream. I also added nutmeg. For the syrup I used the recipe from the double cinnemon toast recipe on here. Delish! My husband said "I want you to make me these everyday for breakfast, don't make anything else". So I'll probably be making them again soon :]

I've made these more times than I can count. There are just three of us so I make a half recipe, leaving out the sugar, cinnamon and raisins. One of us is allergic to dairy so I substitute coconut yogurt and whatever nondairy milk is on hand, and use oil instead of butter. Always add some kind of nuts, usually pecans. My son's favorite breakfast ever! He likes them with ginger syrup.

i didn't have brown sugar or raisens so used splenda and light corn syrup to replace the melted butter. really delicious but they do get brown really fast so you need to keep the fire low.

Very surprised at how delicious these turned out to be. Found them a bit runny following the directions exactly. Ended up adding about a half cup more of flour.

A simple yet great tasting recipe. The raisins and banana complement the pancakes nicely. New breakfast favorite!

great for an easy (and healthy) brunch. used nonfat milk instead of whole milk--still tasted great. used blueberries instead of raisins (who wants raisins in pancakes?)

Rating: 3
These are really great pancakes. After reading other reviews, I made them a bit smaller (1/4 cup scoops) to facilitate easier flipping and ensure that they cooked all the way through. Otherwise just followed the recipe, and threw some chocolate chips in the last few for an extra treat. We really enjoyed these, and will make them again- soon.

Tasty, but difficult to keep from over-darkening before ready to flip. No so pretty.

Just got done having these pancakes and they were excellent. May add some pecans next time. Also, cook them at a lower temperature than normal pancakes to ensure they are cooked all the way through.

I always get a chuckle of those who write in to critique a receipe where they have changed half of the ingredients and then are are disappointed with the result. Make it as directed! Too rich - don't eat so much. Not every recepie rates four forks but really....some of these reviews are downright silly.

good but not great. healthy mix of ingredients and my 3 year old ate them which is a plus.

Walking the dog this a.m. I could smell someone cooking pancakes - instant craving! Didn't want the usual heavy flour base, wanted to use yogourt, so I came home and searched epicurious for pancakes using yogourt. Lucky find! Only had one banana so made half the recipe very successfully. Will use fewer raisins next time, overpowered a bit. Maybe will use cranberries and pecans for a switch, but will definitely be putting this in my recipe box!

These have become a weekend staple in our house for the past two years. I find them a bit tricky to flip, but when everything is just right they puff up beautifully. Quite healthy compared to many other recipes, too.

I've been making these about once a month for over five years and we still love them. I leave out: sugar, cinnamon and raisins. Also because of an allergy I use coconut yogurt and whatever milk substitute I have on hand, and oil instead of butter; sometimes add chopped up chocolate but always have to have nuts in there, preferably pecans.

I have made this receipe several times and it is one of our "special morning.holiday receipes". I wonder why some home cooks are compelled to change or substitute so many of the ingredients and then write a review saying they did not like it! Yikes - just make it and if you do not like it - always more wonderful things to try down the road.

I used whole wheat flour instead of white, but these were still far too sweet for my family. There are tastier banana pancake recipes.

I enjoyed this recipe very much. I replaced half the raisins with dried cherries--i will probably only use dried cherries next time. I also used whole wheat flour instead of white flour. They did turn out a bit sloppy, but that might be attributable to my pancake-flipping skills. I enjoyed the combination of flavors. They were very good with only butter, since i found them sweet enough as they were. I think i will try them next when i have cottage cheese on hand

Rating: 4
This a great recipe. I used scotch oats and whole wheat flour and vanilla flavored yogurt, and 1% milk, but it is delicious. I also would highly recommend including the raisins. I made some with and some without and the sugary sweetness of the bananas needed to be balanced out by the tart sweetness of the raisins.

Rating: 3
I left out the raisins but I wholeheartedly love this recipe. Delicious and nutritious.

I used vanilla yoghurt instead of plain and nonfat milk. I omitted the vanilla and brown sugar (because of the vanilla yoghurt) and also the raisins (since I didn't feel like them). Most of the pancakes tasted uncooked because of all the moisture - hope I don't get sick! I didn't feel the oats added a great texture to the pancakes. Anyway, I'm giving this one fork because I honestly don't feel like eating the rest of the stack that's sitting in the fridge. I've made some great banana pancakes before, using a recipe from a friend's vegetarian cookbook which I neglected to copy. I severely regret that. Just know there are better banana recipes out there. Much, much better.

Rating: 2
THIS RECIPE NEEDS SALT! It was a little bland. I liked the idea of the raisins but once they were there I didn't like them as much as I usually do in dishes. I didn't use the banana because I didn't have one, this could have possibly added flavor. As for the review that stated that their pancakes were runny, let the batter stand for at least 10 min. before cooking them. It thickens. Hope that helped.

I don't know if you can call pancakes "a dish beyond compare," but if you can, this deserves 4 forks. Very moist and filling. My substitutions were as follows: Light sour cream for the yogurt; 2% milk (the sour cream probably made up for the missing richness); only 1 large banana; light olive oil for the butter; and about 3/4 cup chocolate chips and 1/4 cup raisins instead of all raisins. Very tasty! I highly recommend swapping some raisins for chocolate chips - makes a sweet, if not quite as healthy, treat. The recipe should serve 4 or 5. Oh, I wouldn't recommend cottage cheese as topping: these are pretty thick/moist/rich already.

Also substituted almond milk, dropped the bananas and raisins and added a bag each of frozen blueberries and raspberries. Came out great.

The pancakes tasted okay, but I thought it was very runny and the pancakes practically were falling apart. It felt like eating pudding and that was a bit weird.

This is such a great recipe. I've even used the batter to make waffles (careful not to burn them; the brown sugar can be problematic). We've substituted blueberries for the raisins. We've also used vanilla yogurt and omitted the vanilla extract. Definitely a family favorite!

Fabulous. I halved the recipe, used almond milk instead of regular milk, and it turned out just as good. One of the best pancake recipes I've come across.

AWESOME! Since I only had vanilla yogurt on hand (already pretty sweet), I skipped the vanilla extract and halved the brown sugar. My oh my, what a treat! We warmed up apricot preserves in place of syrup. They do freeze okay but thaw kind of rubbery. Good enough for an on-the-run breakfast though.

This is a Sunday morning favorite at our house. It makes a little more than we will eat on Sunday morning so I put 2 in a snadwich baggie and they make a perfect breakfast on-the-run at room temp. !

I thought these were very yummy as is but next time I will make a few changes. I will put a few less rasins and my husband thought the texture of the oatmeal was too much so I might soften the oats first. I like the idea of using blueberries.

Haven't made this yet but it sounds scrumptious. Hey, NY! Try dried cranberries. They're fun in everything and they'd probably be great in this if you don't like raisins.

Phenomenal recipe for pancakes with heft and body. I don't like raisins so I used dry blueberries, and it was delicious. I also tried using fresh blueberries, which my husband preferred, but they bled all over the griddle. I also cut the amount of sugar in half to reduce the chance of burning and to let the maple syrup deliver the sweetness. This has become a staple at our house.

my husbend was unhappy eith my idea of having pancakes for brakefast. i'm sure he'll be happy to have those again. i left out the cinamon' wich i don't like, changed the raisains with current and the bananas with apples (this is what i had at home).

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe (though I do love pancakes). I didn't find them dense or heavy at all. Perhaps that is because I let the oats soak in the milk for about fifteen minutes before proceeding with the rest of the recipe. I also added a 1/4 teaspoon of salt.

I was looking for a healthy oatmeal pancake recipe and this was it. I used wholemeal flour, low fat yoghurt and low fat milk. Served with berries it was a great breakfast. I think those who think it was too dense are not used to a heavier, healthier pancake.

I added 1/4 cup toasted pecan chips and they were still excellent. Since I fix these mostly for just my husband and myself, I cook the entire recipe and freeze them in pkgs of four. They're still great reheated in the microwave! I'm taking this recipe to our family reunion this summer.

First, I'll admit that I am not the best pancake/ waffle/biscuit maker in the world. That said, I can certainly hold my own in the kitchen, and these were a disapointment. With two small children underfoot, my wife and I like to make weekend breakfasts a big deal when we have the time. These were not worth the effort. Heavy, weird consistency, not good flavor. This is our firt real "reject" from Bon-Appetit.

This recipe makes delicious, although very dense, pancakes. I left out the raisins, but they still had a great texture due to the oatmeal. I was careful to use very ripe bananas and mash them thoroughly. It helps to kind of spread the batter a bit after you pour it, or else the pancakes are too thick to cook all the way to the center. Very yummy!

This has become a family favorite--even the teenagers like these healthy pancakes! Depending on the ripeness of the bananas, I might add a little more sugar, and I occasionally add a bit of allspice.

A great Sunday morning treat! I didn't have any plain yogurt on hand, so I substituted lemon yogurt, used Quick Oats, and left out raisins (my 4-year old is in a "purist" phase ). Very tasty & took care of those ripe ripe ripe bananas (the purist phase includes rejecting bananas on cereal in the morning ;) ). Also - I mashed the bananas *really* well to keep from having a slimy texture several people have commented on. As long as you get it to a pretty soupy consistency, you won't have any surprising bites. Next time I'll stick with the lemon yogurt & add a little cinnamon to the batter. They're great sprinkled w/ cinnamon sugar.

We've had these pancakes several times already and they are so good and easy. I've been using currants instead of raisins since that's what I had on hand. I like other reviewers' suggestions to use pecans and will probably try that next time.

A delicious update to the venerable pancake. The oats add a nutty flavor and a little tooth to the texture while the banannas contribute a smooth sweetness. Leave out the raisins and enjoy with real maple syrup.

I followed the recipe except for adding a bit more flour (1/4) as I was afraid the pancakes would be too thin. The flavor was good, not great; the raisins were an interesting addition. I will try it again with a bit more brown sugar and I think I can leave out the extra flour although the extra flour did make for a nice consistency. As with other reviewers I say it's a good recipe, but not spectacular.
