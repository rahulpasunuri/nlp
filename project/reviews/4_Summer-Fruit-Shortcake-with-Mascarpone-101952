Was coming back for this recipe yet again, and saw no one had sung its praises recently. It's an easy and fabulous show-stopper of a dessert, and the world's best breakfast if there's anything left over in the morning. Good for guests who may be on different eating plans, because it can be served as just fruit, fruit and (unbelievably scrumptious, and gluten-free) cream, or all the way, as a generous slice of cake. Make sure to drizzle the cake with the fruit sauce. Vary the fruits to use what's seasonal, but the earthier taste of plums and peaches works well with the cream, which does have unexpected flavor due to the mascarpone.

I love this recipe! Super easy and it doesn't get much easier than this, but both times I've made it, I didn't even bother with the shortcakes. I think it's pretty wonderful with just the fruit topped with the mascarpone.

Surprisingly easy, this was a yummy summer treat. When I couldn't find fresh strawberries, I was happy to follow the rasberry, peach and plum mix suggested here and it was super. We didn't bother with the cooling and chilling, we just attacked it out of the oven, the warm shortcake providing a nice contrast to the cool fruits and cream.

does anyone recall seeing a similar recipt to this one - also two layers of cake (i think shortbread) with plain whipped cream and berries inside. It was one of my favorites and I lost the paer recipt and now can't find it on the site. Any help would be sooo appreciated.

Tested this recipe as I was planning for a guest I didn't want to try something new with. The test batch I did half quantities, made individual shortcakes and it was delicious, very easy (used strawberries, frozen raspberries and fresh peaches) - I also added a dash of brandy to the mascarpone mix, and to the fruit ;-) Second time with full recipe, everything going well - then disaster: I ran out of gas for the oven. So my guest got served the fruit and cream - and had seconds! Never told them about the shortcakes and they didn't miss them!

Beautiful and so simple! I substituted plain yogurt when I realized I didn't have buttermilk and it was still lovely. My family raved about it.

This is the third time I have made this desert. Everyone asks for it for special occasions.I like it best with fresh strawberries and raspberries. This time I substituted almond extract for the vanilla in the shortcake and added a little Amaretto into the whippedcream/mascarpone. The Amaretto into the whipped cream was too much but the almond extract in the cake was great. As you can tell this is what I make when the fresh fruit is available

I love the way this looks, very simple and elegant. I did have trouble getting the cake to cook thoroughly, but a cover of foil and additional cooking time seemed to help. I ended up making two cakes (had additional company call this morning to say they were coming) and had plenty of mascarpone and fruit. Relatively quick, disgustingly easy and so professional looking! This will become a standard in my kitchen!

A great summer dessert and EASY to make. I used cream cheese and thought it was fine although I would recommend beating it well before adding the cream ... mine had a few lumps. Would make it again, maybe trying some different fruits.

Very tasty and fun to make. Try not to subsitute the regular cream cheese for the mascarpone-- it makes a difference. Next time I think I might add some cornmeal to the shortcake mix.

This is an amazing dessert! It's now part of my regular "repetoire" of recipes for special occassions. However, I find it prettier to make individual shortcakes instead of just one big one. Also, do NOT substitute frozen or canned peaches or raspberries--you can tell the difference, trust me. I also ommitted the plums, as I don't care for them.

This is a terrific do ahead dessert. As we had to travel with it, I opted to keep the fruit separate, then ladled fruit and juices over the top at service time. Beautiful and delicious.
