I just want to say that I have made these twice, the first time years ago - if you are looking for something that borders on a labor of love but is every bit worth it, this is the trick, right here. Every time I go through my recipe box I try to come up with a reason to make these - unfortunately I don't always have the time.

DELICIOUS!! My mouth is so happy after eating this wonderful desert. I served it with the raspberry coulis and it was a glorious pairing. While it is a bit of work, is there an exceptional dish that isn't?

Absolutely delicious and beautiful. Takes a little time - but all good things in life do.
