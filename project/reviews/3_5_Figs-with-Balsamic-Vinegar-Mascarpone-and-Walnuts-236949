This is SUPER easy and fast to make. Love it! I hate walnuts so I used almonds instead. This was the only substitute. It was very good and unusual so everyone seemed to appreciate it - even my husband who is not crazy about desserts in general. I think if I did it again, I would put in a little less sugar. I think the quality of your balsamic can affect the sweetness level.

Can't believe more people haven't tried this! I've made it every holiday for last 3 years, and it always gets rave reviews. Even my non-adventurous fam members devour. And I usually offer an option of either Mascarpone or vanilla ice cream. Does not dissapoint.

very successful, rich, complex. can be served as smaller portions recipe suggests.

Incredibly easy and reasonably quick. I brought it to a potluck and it stood out among all the cakes. Not too sweet or starchy.

Great dish. I made it several times. No one would believe me it was balsamic reduction. Everyone thought it was some kind of chocolate. I serve the dish with vanilla ice cream instead of cheese.
