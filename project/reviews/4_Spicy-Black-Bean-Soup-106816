I'm surprised by the number of exceptional ratings for this soup. As a cook who makes soup often, I found this soup to be watery, without depth of taste, and lacking presentation. I added tomato paste to give it a bit more flavor, deepen the color and thicken it a bit. I also added more spice and an extra can of beans. The end result was a good soup but not without a lot of changes.

Super easy to make. Made a couple changes though. Couldn't find green chillies at the corner grocery store so just used a couple of chipotles in adobo instead (which probably actually had a significant effect on the flavour, but tasty and spicy regardless.) Then also felt like eating some meats so just sliced up a couple andouille sausages and threw them in at the end.

This was pretty good - not a very thick soup, but definitely tastey. Was improved with the quinoa that someone suggested.

This was a very tasty soup. I subbed the diced mild green chilies for some super sweet red bell peppers to get the sweet/spicy juxtaposition. I also used one can of black beans and one can of butter beans instead of 2 cans black beans and it turned out really nicely. I skipped the sour cream and tortilla chips but if you want add a little more hardiness to the meal, add about a half cup of cooked quinoa to each bowl of soup once you're ready to serve it. It's a great, filling dish to warm you up on a cold winter's night.

Great recipe! I had never made a chicken- broth based bean soup but it definitely added more flavor. I pressure cooked my own black beans and added a few more cloves of garlic. When I decided not to puree the soup, I added some frozen corn to make it more of a Southwestern dish ! I also added some paprika (pimenton from spain) for a smokey flavor. I skipped the tortilla chips since I had the starchiness from the corn.

I was surprised at how simple this recipe was, relative to the return I received from it! The one thing i did differently was to add the juice of one lime before I served it. It added another level of flavor to the soup that made it even better with the contrasting sour cream.

I made this soup for the first time last night. It was fantastic! The only changes I made was to add rotel with habanero peppers for that extra kick. I decided to blend the onion mixture with one can of black beans then added the extra can to the purée. I used vegetable stock in one and a half cups for extra thickness. It's not easy to find healthy recipes that are delish too! Thank you for making dinner exciting again :)

My husband and I absolutely love this soup. It's part of our regular rotation. It's incredibly simple and fast to make, uses basic household ingredients, and is delicious for days. I highly, highly recommend.

I've made this soup a bunch of times, and its great. So easy and quick. I add 1 more can of beans to make the texture thicker. By accident once, that extra can of beans happened to be kidney beans instead of black beans...the results were great and now I always use a variety of beans. I like the idea of adding smoked paprika and will probably try that tonight. I serve it with sour cream and cubed avocado, and sometimes with mini quesadillas to dip. A must try!

This is a great weeknight recipe. I puree the entire soup with a stick blender because I like it smooth. Have shredded jack, diced onions, cilantro, chips and sour cream on the side so everyone can add what want.

I substituted chipotle chili for the jalapeños because i didn't have time to run to the store and added a little 'better than bouillon' brand chicken bouillon concentrate and it turned out amazing. I also added some cayenne to get the amount of spice I wanted because chipotle peppers really aren't that spicy (in my opinion). anyway, it was a hit, my friends loved it and the smokey flavor was a great hit for our mexican themed dinner!

This is now my favorite black bean soup recipe - easy, quick, tasty, and very healthy! I added more jalapeno than indicated, and even so, after a day of two, the flavors had mellowed a bit and were really perfectly balanced. I found this hearty enough to eat as a meal, and I also loved it in a faux-taco salad: tossed a bit of the soup with some fresh tomatoes, a bit of cheese, and chopped romaine hearts.

BEST soup recipe on the site. Add 1/2 cup sweet corn (I used frozen) + 1 t chipotle chili powder for flavor.

I like my black bean soup thick, so I omitted the broth. I also added a cut up tomato, and if I didn't have that, I would add a can of tomatoes. It added a really nice flavor. In addition, I also added a cup of fresh corn... I served it with corn bread and a salad, but I think it would be great with grilled cheese sandwiches, as well...

I need to make sure I keep these ingredients for this soup in the kitchen. Great taste, I doubled the jalapeno and used no salt.

Holy delicious soup, Batman! I know I will be making this one again and again. My husband commented that this (paired with some fresh bread with butter and a salad) made for a perfect dinner. I had no jalapenos on hand, so I added a liberal dose of chili pepper. I am looking forward to working this soup into my rotation!

I just finished my second bowl of this yummy soup. We all loved it and couldn't stop raving! As we are vegetarians I made my own vegetable broth. I too topped the soup with the sour cream, torillas, salsa and grated cheddar. I didn't have cilantro but next time I will use it just for a garnish. I certainly didn't miss it. This is a winner!

My family loved this recipe. I did make a few changes, though. I increased the number of cans to 3 and used a whole container of chicken stock. I also added some red wine vinegar and oregano. I use the immersion blender and blend the whole thing, and then add yet another can of beans. I garnish with fresh lime wedges and cilantro. Excellent!

Delicious and very nuanced as far as flavors go. I didn't expect this soup to have so many individual little kicks to it. Black bean soup I've had in the past has been very one note. I especially liked the cumin in this; it added a great dimension. Since I like things spicier, I skipped the jalapeno and used 3 serrano peppers + one habanero instead.

This is a fantastic recipe. I add garlic to the soup and grill chicken, steak, and/or sausage to throw in for a hearty meal. If I have extra time I make pico de gallo and chipotle sour cream to complete the meal.

Can't imagine life without this one. This soup fits all my categories for a great soup: very flavorful, filling, cheap, and easy. (I substituted chipotle for the jalapeno because I had it on hand.) It got a little spicy for some of the small (under 10- year-old) people we shared it with.

This was a delicious soup. My 17-year-old daughter is vegetarian and she was having a bunch of friends over (most of them are vegan). We used vegetable broth instead of chicken. We wanted a chunky texture, so we didn't puree, we just stirred in a little cornstarch mixed with broth and it thickened up nicely. Everyone loved it.

Rating: 4
Added 1 can of beans, only used liquid from 1 can of the 3, since I don't really dig on canned bean liquid. Added 1 can tomatoes, and a minced small super-hot green chile. Also added diced carrots and celery sauteed with the onions. Used a hand blender to thicken slightly. Half my guests liked it with rice, half with chips. Garnishes of tomato, guacamole, sour cream, cheese and cilantro.

Added a can of Rotel and the juice of half a lime. Blended with hand blender until slightly chunky texture. Very good! Better than most restaurant versions we've tried.

Great easy soup. As everyone mentions, add one can black beans, one can tomatoes (I used Mexican stewed, which had a little extra jalapeno, garlic), simmer an extra 15 minutes if you can, then after pureeing part add one can corn.

What a great soup! So easy to make and sooooo deliciouss. I modified it slightly (added more jalepeno and a can of diced tomatoes)and I let it simmer longer. It is a great healthy easy and affordable meal!

This soup is EXCELLENT. I did make some changes the second time, which I really liked. I substitued vegetable broth and added another can of drained black beans. This made the soup a little richer in both appearance and texture (it was gray and murky looking with the chicken broth - my kids were a little wary). I took the suggestion of adding thyme, but I used about 1/4 tsp. dried. I also added about 1/4 tsp. ancho chili powder and 1/8-1/4 tsp. chipotle chili powder. Having little time to cook, this is one fast and easy recipe that is healthy and hearty, and my 6 year old and 15 month old love it!

Great flavor. I made this for the "black" portion of the Black and White Soup recipe on this site. Reviewers said that black bean soup was too bland. This is so simple too. I used a hand blender and pureed all.

I've been making this soup for years (a pot is sitting on my stove right now), but I never checked the reviews. I'm so glad it did. It's not too late to add corn and lime. Yum. This is soooo good.

I followed everything on this recipe, including some of the reviewers suggestions,and added my own touch of fresh thyme (about 5 twigs worth) and this truly added a fresh flavor to an already rainbow of tastes! Lime is a definite must in this soup, I used an entire lime and extra wedges in each bowl as a garnish with sour cream on top, there are so many amazing tastes in this soup and it is so easy to make.

Rating: 4
this soup is so great! everyone I have served this too has loved it. the only possible complaint might be that it is a bit too spicy, but that just depends on your own heat preference. If heat is a problem but you like a slight kick, keep the green chilies but reduce or remove the jalapenos. The creaminess of the sour cream add a nice contrast to the spice in the soup.

This was fantastic, it took about 1 hours from start to finish. I altered the recipe with a few things, I used 6 garlic cloves, a whole fresh jalepeno, I can of Rotel (with lime and cilantro), the fresh juice from 1/2 of a lime, 1 can of corn drained, and I added the teeny tiny pasta just before serving. The flavor was amazing! I did simmer for 25 mins (not 15)so the flavors could blend more.

This is my new favourite soup! I made it last week for the first time and plan on making it again this week (its been requested by my family). The only change I made was to add half of a jalapeno with the seeds still in it (because we like our food spicy). I used a hand blender and left it a bit chunky for some texture. A garnish of cilantro, sour cream, a splash of lime juice and some finely diced jalapeno makes it perfect. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

So easy to make and delicious for all seasons! I added fresh corn kernels (1 ear), which worked out great. Also followed the advice of another reviewer and used a potato masher, instead of pureeing. Thanks for tip--the consistency was perfect.

Quick, healthy, and full of flavor. What's not to like? A dollop of sour cream on the top rounds it out nicely. Instead of pureeing the beans I smash them partially with a potato masher or big spoon. Makes for a thicker consistency, which I prefer.

Outstanding recipe! Quick, easy, and really delicious. Excellent as is, but made better with the addition of about six slices of almost crisp chopped bacon thrown in with the onions. (Don't want to pre-cook the bacon all the way, or it will burn before the onions are done.) Add a sqeeze of lime at the end, and you've really got something special! I serve it with grilled chicken quesadillas and it's a hit with the whole family. Another thing about this recipe that's great for a busy mom like me is that doubles easily and freezes very well!

Very quick & easy recipe. The only changes I would make would be to substitute fresh jalapenos (or any other hot pepper) for the canned and increase the cumin. I love to serve it with monterey jack cheese on top.

This was very good, but I found it a bit too thin. Next time I will reduce the amount of broth to perhaps 1 1/2 cups and go from there. Also, it would take away fromt he "quickness" of the recipe, but I think using whole cumin seed, roasted and then ground would be better, and perhaps some ground coriander as well.

I have made this recipe several times, and absolutely love it. I'm not a vegetarian, but I prefer black bean soup without meat. The only modication I made was to add the juice of one lime at the end. Seemed to enhance the flavor. Another thing I've done, to make it more substantial,and to add texture,is to use the soup as a base,and top with all sorts of additions, such as sour cream, shredded cheese, tomatoes, black olives, green onions, etc. But it's delicious as is!

Rating: 4
Wonderful recipe! The first time I made it exactly like the recipe said. The second time I added a can of rotel (tomatoes and chiles) insted of the green chiles and jalepeno, and some fresh corn and vegetable broth instead of chicken. I also let it simmer for an hour or so instead of 15 minutes. I make it all the time.

Rating: 4
Asolutely wonderful! Freezes well. I modified by using a combo of Anaheim and Poblano chilis instead of the jalapeno. Gave it more texture and taste. Also used fresh corn kernels. Finally, I found smoked turkey necks (who knew?) in the market. They added a wonderful smoky flavor and I managed to get quite a bit of meat off them.

I made adjustments as recommended by others: added one can chopped tomatoes and upped the jalepeno to two whole chopped jalapenos (gave it a nice kick!). I also blended some of the soup with soft tofu as one person recommended and it gave it a very nice consistency. I also added one cup of frozen corn towards the end which really went well with the other flavours.

What a winner!! Great flavor and easy to make. Based on other reviews, added another cup of broth (vegetable for a vegan dish) and cooked for 30 minutes instead of 15. Also added extra can of black beans (3 instead of 2). Blended 6 ounces of silken tofu in with the 3 cups of blended soup - gave it a rich, creamy texture. Will do this again and again!!

As others have pointed out, this recipe is very easy to make. It also turned out fairly well for such a quick recipe. However, I'm just not a big fan of soups that are not cooked for longer. The flavors just don't seem to blend together very much. If I made it again, I'd probably add more broth and cook it for 1/2 an hour more.

My husband is the master of this soup. The first change is that he mashes instead of blends the soup for a thicker consistancy, but the key ingredient for him is adding ditalini rigati pasta (number 47- very small, we got it in italy) at the end while the soup is simmering (post-mashing, of course). He adds anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 a cup. He got the idea from a small cafe in Rome where they did a similar (and great!) variation on pasta e fagoli. Everyone that tries it raves...especially me!!!!

Great! Yummy, Hearty soup. Just spicy enough. I added the jalapenos with the seeds and it added a good amount of heat. Also added green peppers and tomatoes (just a 1/2 cup or so of each) and pureed with a hand blender. No cilantro for me. I will definitely make this again!

Rating: 3
A wonderful dish. Only changes I made was charring the jalepeno and removing the burnt skin, adding a can of diced tomatoes and using an emersion blender to make it smooth. One word of warning - jalapenos vary drastically in levels of heat. I used one of the hotest jalepeno I've ever tasted in this soup and had a wonderful spicy bite. FYI: If you ever want to reduce the amount of heat (I wouldn't dream of it) you can remove the jalapeno's seeds and membranes which carry most of the heat.

This is my basic recipe for bean soup too with lots of variation possibilities -- adding a can of Rotel tomatoes, using canned black beans with jalapenos, adding a can of hominy or corn, or not adding as much broth and serving the bean mixture over polenta with Parmesan in it. I usually use 3 cans of beans and have also added cubed baked tofu to stretch the dish and for extra protein and variety.

This is a very easy and tasty soup, but I did make a couple of modifications. I like it spicy so I use one jalepeno and one well minced serrano chile. I substitute one tablespoon of olive oil and salt with some chopped bacon that's rendered in the same pot before anything else is put in. Yum!

I LOVED this recipe! It was perfect as is, if you like things spicy. My husband has a milder palate, but he added extra sour cream and loved it, too. (I didn't measure the jalapeno -- just used one whole one.) Will definitely be making this one often. Also, warmed up leftovers the next day in the microwave tasted just as good.
