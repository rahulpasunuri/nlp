I thought this was great, with a few exceptions: made a simpler dressing of a little lime juice, olive oil, 1 garlic clove, and a few dashes of cumin, and I ended up substituting cilantro for mint. Was a little wary of the raita, but was sooo glad I made it. A really bright, fresh salad!

Bleh. I did not enjoy this--VERY strong mustard/sour taste to dressing.

I am rating the dressing only. I had some leftover chicken from an Indian restaurant, with spices rubbed all over it. I cut it in pieces to toss in a salad, and wanted to use this dressing. It is a good base, but needed something else. I ended up adding some balsamic vinegar, juice from 1/4 lime and 1 teaspoon sugar. This turned out great.

This salad is great! In our house, the dressing was very well received... only my store-bought garam masala was not. Dressing, chutney, and chicken/marinade each has strong flavors, but they blend beautifully. As no boneless breasts were available I reluctantly used pre-cut chicken strips or 'tenders'. They ended up grilling faster and presentation matched any trendy lunch spot.

I should have listen to the other reviewers on the dressing, it just was not right! The chicken was great. If I make it again I will add more veggies to the salad and use the cumin vinegarette I already have and like.

This is a great salad! Everyone loved it and I have to say this is now one of my favorite recipes on this site. Try this!!!!

Everyone (children as well as adults) liked this salad! I served it in a flat bowl and surrounded it with tomatoes, rice vinegar cucumbers, pineapple and tomatoes. I added raisins and slivered almonds to the greens.

Nice summer dinner. Very refreshing.

I decided to try this as an alternative to curry chicken salad that I make with mayo. I made my own garam masala and it was so much more delicate than any store bought mixure. I loved the yogurt base sauce for the chicken, much nicer than mayo. I also made the dressing but like the other reviewer, hated it and threw it out. So, actually, I'd rate this three forks for the chicken and no forks for the dressing.

The recipe for the chicken was simple and tasty. However, the dressing was really bad. It was really bitter and just didn't taste right. I ended up mixing the salad with olive oil and balsamic vinegar and put slices of the chicken on top which everyone enjoyed.
