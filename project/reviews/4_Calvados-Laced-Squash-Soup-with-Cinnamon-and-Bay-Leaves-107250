One loved it, one liked it, and one didn't like it -- so not a huge hit. The issues were with how runny it was (wanting a thicker soup) and disliking the cinnamon.

This recipe is a good foundation but can require a lot of tweaking, based on the sweetness of the squash and the strength of the onion. Also, I cut the recipe in 1/4 (used half a squash) and it made 7.5 cups, so the 12 servings listed, for the full recipe, must be very large servings. To my 1/4 of the recipe, I added approx. 2 tsp more salt, 1/2 a veg. bouillon cube, 1 tsp. white pepper, 1/4 cup spiced apple cider, 1/4 more evap. milk, a pinch of ginger, and a pinch of ground cinnamon. I used my hand mixer and did not strain it. After all that, it is a wonderfully complex savory, sweet, salty creamy soup.

Absolutely delicious and warming. But what makes it even better is if you add a little bit of ginger and nutmeg to the onion sauce as it is simmering. I also added a touch of maple syrup when it was cooking in the pot.

Delicious! Straining the soup is time consuming, but well worth the effort to achieve a velvety smooth texture. The soup is worth an investment into a Chinois to make the straining easier.

My husband made this recipe for our annual NYE dinner party and it was simply fabulous. Everyone loved it - a definite crowd-pleaser and very unique. We substituted the Calvados for Apple Jack because we didn't want to spend top dollar on the Calvados in case we didn't like the soup. The cinnamon cream was a wonderful accompaniment. We'll definitely be making it again!

This is a fantastic appetizer soup (maybe a little too rich to be a main course?) I added one whole diced apple and some ground cayenne, and otherwise halved the rest of the ingredients, and it serves 12 as an appetizer. No need to strain, when it's fully cooked and blended - and immersion blender will make it super-smooth.

I made this yesterday. I used other reviewer's comments and substituted cider for some of the chicken broth as well as reducing the liquid. I also added the additional spices. It was superb.

Made this soup last night for a small dinner party and was a big hit! Followed the ingredients almost exactly but used my hand blender to puree the soup. Also omitted the cinnamon cream and just sprinkled with ground cinnamon before serving. The combo of chicken stock, evaporated milk and brandy made it so rich and delicious! Everyone was surpised that a squash soup could be so tasty and filling.

Great choice for a crowd. Be sure to use large onions and increase the apple brandy for extra flavor. Since sour cream sinks to bottom, try a mint or sage leaf to hold a very small garnish of the cinnamon cream.

Excellent - Made this as the starter for Thanksgiving, but used the Williams Sonoma bottled Squash and adjusted the seasonings slightly. I wouldn't add the water to the sour cream - I think it makes it too thin. Everyone loved this.

This soup was absolutely amazing! I made it the night before and just rewarmed it the night of our dinner party. Everybody raved about it. This would be perfect for a Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner. I used about 6 cups of stock. I also used my immersion blender which made it easy. The cinnamon cream was a great addition; next time I'll double the amount.

This soup is delicious! The calvados, cinnamon, and bay add just the right nuanced interest. I used prepped butternut chunks (a timesaver on Thanksgiving!), adding them to the pot with the broth just after discarding the sticks and leaves. I also used less broth - about 6 cups. I then used my immersion blender, adding the evaporated milk when the soup appeared silky. So much easier than blending and straining!

Very good. Tasty.

This soup is exceptional. I make it with buttercup squash and it is truly exquisite. I usually end up using regular brandy though. If you like squash, you will LOVE this soup. It's amazing.

Simply delicous! I even substituted fat-free evap milk and it was still luscious :-)

I used applejack instead of calvados for price reasons. Also, I added a dash of nutmeg and ginger, as per another reviewer's suggestion. It was fantastic. My guests were all very impressed. The cinnamon sour cream makes a big difference. In addition, I toasted some pumpkin seeds and sprinkled them on top.

I serve this every year at Rosh Hashannah dinner. Everyone likes it!The cinnamon sour cream and calvados are what makes it so good. I agree that less broth is better.

I have made this recipe 3 times....and everybody loves it...but be carefull because you don't need all the brooth in the ingredient list(maybe 2 cans at the most)...if you add all that it will get very liquid and will loose flavor and texture...pour little by little and try it each time...

This is delicious. I didnt have Calvados so used plain brandy and added a dash of Cayenne right before serving because we like hot. But it was great without the cayenne.

This is a fabulous, rich fall/winter soup! The flavors are complex, yet distinct. I agree that the Calvados adds a unique touch. I added dashes of cardamom, ginger and nutmeg to the onion saute, did not strain the puree, and sprinkled a few toasted chopped pecans on top before serving. My guests loved it!

We loved this recipe- by far the best I've found yet. Adding the Calvados to the onion saute is a key in flavoring- I also added a bit more before reheating the soup for an extra flavor kick! I found that 6 lbs of butternut squash yields way more than the 6 cups required for the soup, so next time I would just use a single 5 lb squash instead. Also, cutting down on broth is a plus.

This was really good. Cut recipe in half and instead of thinning it out w/ more broth I added brandy and splash of apple cider and did not strain the puree. Also cut back on the broth. The cinnamon sour cream really added to it. Served with green salad w/ a roasted garlic dressing and for dessert roasted apples w/ vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce. A perfect fall dinner!

I found this recipe to be superb! I made it for my husbad, who hates squash, and found it to be quite delectable! It is a great first course. The cinnamon sour cream is what makes it so lucious.

modify the recipe -- sautee onions and garlic with stick and multiple bay leaves. remove and reserve leaves and sticks. puree baked squash and sauteed mixture with the evap milk and far far far less broth than the recipe. don't strain -- just add to the pot. return leaves and sticks to the pot. simmer with liquor and add broth to taste.

I had hoped for a spicy, delicious squash soup for Thanksgiving. I ended up with a bland, tasteless dissapointment. I really don't recommend this recipe; we tried all the tricks in the book to spice it up and make it taste good. Nothing worked - we ended up throwing it out, rather than serve it.

I made this last fall, when it came out in the magazine. It was delicious! I ended up making a second batch & freezing it so we could have it throughout the winter. I followed the recipe exactly, using a cheap apple brandy instead of Calvados. Got great comments from everyone who I served it to! Now that butternut squash is back at the farmer's market, I'm getting ready to make this again.

I made this as directed. It was very thin after the first 32 ounces of broth, so I didn't add more. Since I added the evaporated milk before the broth, it was too milky. I added about 2 teaspoons of cinnamon. It was okay, but pretty run-of-the-mill. It was a little better the second day.

The texture was very creamy & rich, but although I love cinnamon, & normally add extra when called for in a recipe, the cinnamon in both the soup & the topping was too one-dimensional. I would try again with cubed pancetta to add bite & saltiness.

This is the BEST butternut squash soup I've tasted. It is simply lucious! I must confess that I cheated and used Williams-Sonoma's butternut squash puree in a jar instead of fighting with the whole squash. It's a fabulous find and the flavor is wonderful.
