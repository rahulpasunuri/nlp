I accidentally forgot to add the water to the sauce, and it was the perfect consistency nonetheless. Next time, I would make it with the cashew butter or sesame paste, as the peanut butter sauce was a bit too sweet for me. This dish can definitely do with a bit of an increase in scallions and red pepper flakes, so don't be shy if you like heat!

Following the instructions in the about section, I used the remaining half if the sauce for the rice. YUM! I didn't add the water as other reviewers stated and hubby, who is not a salt lover, rated this recipe a keeper! I cooked some on the stove top and broiled till brown for the top half. Lovely recipe.

Wow this is soooooooooooo good! Make it you won't be disappointed. We used a mix of natural peanut butter and sesame paste. As suggested in previous review, we did not add water to the sauce and it was fine. Our other change to the recipe was the addition of lots of fresh vegetables to make it healthier (carrots, celery, peppers, onion and green beans). We will definitely make this again.

This is very good - second helping for everyone and the kids have asked that I make it again!

We made this for Christmas 2012. The vegan step-son really liked it, as did my partner. Just a nice mix of flavors.

My new favorite tofu recipe. My kids loved it too but it was just a tad spicy for them so next time I will cut back on the red pepper flakes just a bit. The sauce looked thin but it thickened very quickly when added to the hot pan. I also added some cooked broccoli at the end and served with Jasmine rice and naan. By the way, for anyone who's new cooking with tofu, the key really is to press the liquid out -- I just use lots of paper towels and put my cast iron skillet on top (replace the towels a few times). Anyway, make this!

I made as written but the sauce came out unbelievably salty.Maybe due to the 1/4 cup soy sauce. My Husband felt the same. He said something is 'off' about the recipe. One thing that was confusing, the recipe states to add only 'half the sauce' and doesn't say what to do with the rest of it, so I used it all instead of only half and there was a lot of sauce. Could this have had something to do with the saltiness? I hate unclear recipe directions doesn't any body proof read these things?

This is far and away the best tofu dish I've ever made...and have been cooking with tofu for decades! The only change I make is to slightly increase the crushed red pepper as we like extra spice. We are not vegetarians but love this dish and always get great reviews when served to those new to tofu.

My partner and I thought this was fabulous! I used all the sauce and added steamed broccoli at the end to coat in the sauce along with the tofu. So much flavor! Pretty quick and easy. Great for a weeknight dinner.

This recipe was a disappointment. The sauce is way too watery as witnessed by the need to reduce it (omitting the water would be a good first step). I tried it thinking I'd be exposed to new flavors but I've been making a version of this by just mixing tahini, soy sauce, vinegar and sugar and pouring it over pan fried tofu.

This was delicious. In addition to the tofu, I added broccoli florets. I also added about a half of a tablespoon of grated fresh ginger to the sauce. My husband and I loved it!

Rating: 3
I was expecting more based on the other reviews, but it was still a tasty recipe. I might try not cooking the sauce next time, like some others had suggested. The sauce burns very quickly and it might be better without cooking.

So yummy!!! Husband wants me to make it for guests coming over Sat. night. Restaurant quality. Made a few changes. Tofu: I used two pkgs of extra firm tofu that I breaded in panko and unsweetened coconut before frying in 1 tsp coconut oil. (I loved crunch to the tofu and the subtle coconut flavor- very Thai) Sauce: I used 1 tsp of curry powder and 1 tsp fresh ginger. 2 Tbs applesauce instead of sugar. (was perfectly sweetened and the sauce did not dry out so quickly) before blending. Served with red quinoa (instead of rice) and steamed green beans, tri-color peppers and onion. Beautiful presentation- and delicious! YOU MUST TRY THIS RECIPE. :-)

My favourite tofu recipe! The only changes I have made to it (after I made it a few times as written) are: 1) I coated the tofu in some flour, 2) used medium firm tofu and drained out the excess liquid (I do not like the texture of firm tofu), 3) added some grated ginger to the sauce, as well as some fish sauce, and 4) cooked the sauce on its own and let people put on as much as they wanted once the meal was served. I found that the sauce thickened way too quickly, so I prefer to make it on its own and serve separately. That way, the tofu stays crunchy and the sauce does not overwhelm. LOVE this dish!

I will agree with 4 fork rating! The only thing I will change next time is to dredge the triangles in corn starch or the like because we enjoy it crunchy! Great sauce...I found it complimented our side of broccoli and the brown rice everyone nicely suggested. We will definitely put into our "favorites" pile of recipes.

I agree with everybody else: this recipe is delicious! Besides, it is simple and quick to make. I made a slightly lighter version, (1) using only 1tbsp total oil (2/3 peanut and 1/3 sesame), what was plenty. I used iron skillet; (2) used lite soy sauce; (3) instead of tamari, I used Bragg sauce; (4) 1,5 tbsp sugar, and (5) no salt added vegetable stock. The sauce is really rich and it is delicious on the top of brown rice. Served also with haricot verts.

@Redgecko I had the same problem with the getting the water out. But I ended up buying a TofuXpress and love it! I use it all the time and it made this recipe even more flavorful the second time around.

Great recipe. I've been a vegetarian for 10 years and this is my favorite tofu recipe! Husband likes sauce over chicken, for those of you in mixed veggie/omnivore households. Make as-is, with the exception of leaving out the tamari, as I never have it in the house, as well as the sesame seeds (same reason).

My husband and I have been vegetarians for 20 years and this is one of the best dishes we've ever made. My husband commented that it could be served in a restaurant. I cut each carton of tofu into 16 triangles, didn't use tamari, used Sucanat instead of sugar and doubled everything so we could have it for 2 nights. I served it on brown rice. The trick is to get the liquid out of the tofu so that it browns nicely. I wrapped the tofu in paper towels, placed in colander, and put heavy cans on top for an hour. I've made this twice and can't wait to make it again!

This is really really good. I used peanut butter and vegetable stock, and served it over brown rice with a side of broccoli. The amount in the recipe only serves two in my house since we like extra sauce to drizzle over the rice. I also made this with tempeh with good results.

Apart from the Tamari and sesame seeds which I didn't have to hand, I made this recipe as written. It's amazing! One of the two best tofu recipes I've ever made (the other being the braised tofu from Mark Bittman's How to Cook Everything Vegetarian). Brown rice went well with it.

Our family loved these crispy yummy trianges. One carton is not nearly enough for 4 but since there is enough sauce for twice as much tofu, I might have two cast iron pans going next time. I used almond butter which I always have on hand and fried them in sesame oil so the flavour was really intense.

Rating: 4
I've made this at least 5 times and it always turns out great. Usually I use the other uncooked half of the sauce in a stir fry because I think it's better cooked. Sometimes I make the pieces a little bit smaller so that they fit in the pan better and heat through faster.

Rating: 4
Almost as soon as I put the sauce in the pan, it burnt. That being said, the sauce is amazing 'raw'. I make the tofu, and add the sauce over it after cooking. I also use the sauce in other dishes. Very good.

Slice the tofu into 8 pieces. Dredge in gluten free flour. Then fry them in the peanut oil. YUM!

This is probably one of the best recipes I've made from this site, and I'm not vegetarian. Absolutely incredible. So simple, the tastes are clean and pure. I used tahini as the nut butter.

I found that when I cooked the sauce it almost immediately over-heated in the hot pan - it wasn't ruined, but it was close. I used sesame paste in the sauce and the flavor was too strong.

Great recipe! My vegetarian 12-year-old picked this recipe and it's a winner. Probably the best tofu recipe we've ever made. We're definitely going to check out this cook book. Will definitely make this again.

I've made this a couple of times, and both times it's been great. Super quick and really satisfying over rice. You could use even more tofu, if you've got a big enough pan to fry it. I've served it with steamed broccoli, which I've thought about even mixing right in. Green beans would be really good with it as well. Yum!

I love this sauce. It's so much better than the dozens of other peanut sauces I've tried because it slightly caramelizes when reduced in the pan- oh so good! And super fast. I would serve this to company for a casual meal.

Wow, this dish is GREAT! I'm not a fan of peanut butter or peanuts but I still loved this dish. This was my first time making tofu for my hamburger-loving boyfriend and he LOVED this dish so much I'm making it again today, only 2 days after making it the first time! I used the leftover sauce on regular thin pasta and it came out really good!

This was great! My first time making tofu for a very skeptical husband, and he went back for seconds!! I served it with wild rice and a stir fried bok choy recipe I found on this site. Would definitely make it again, even for a casual dinner with veggie friends.

Great recipe. I agree that the vinegar can be strong - I used too much I think. I also didn't have red pepper, so I put cayenne pepper powder in, and it added the heat without really changing the taste too much.

The vinegar completely ruins this recipe. I think it would be brilliant without it.

This was such a great find! I'm always looking for things to do with tofu since I'm trying to incorporate it more into our diets. I didn't have peanut butter so crushed sesame seeds in my mortar and pestle and it came out as a beautiful paste and tasted delicious! *an option for those out there who are allergic to peanuts.

I thought this recipe turned out great - I substituted peanut butter, I used white sugar and I didnt have any tamari (which supposedly is just a thicker soy sauce) so I left it out. My only advice is to really make sure you dry out the tofu, otherwise the leak liquid when you are frying them and it takes much longer to get them golden brown.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I thought this was one of the best sauces I ever made. Next time I'll bake the tofu instead of fry it to make it a bit healthier, and maybe add a few veggies too. Or maybe I'll just drink the sauce plain. It's seriously that good.

This was great--really flavorful and simple to prepare. I used almond butter and dashi for the stock, and added some grated ginger to the sauce.

this was yummy both my husband and my toddler cleaned their plates! fairly easy to throw together. I stir fried some bok choy and shredded carrots and served alongside brown basmati rice with the sauce drizzled over all. next time i will use a little less soy sauce (i use bragg's aminos) and sub agave nectar for the brown sugar...
