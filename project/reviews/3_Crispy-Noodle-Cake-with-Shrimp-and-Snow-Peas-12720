A solid recipe! It does need garlic, though. The prep can all be done as you get started and quite easily. The contrast of textures--crunchy noodle, crispy seared shrimp, velvety sauce, chewy mushrooms--and complexity of flavors make for a truly winning combination. Sear the shrimp in the oil and merely toss into the sauce at the end to coat it to maintain the textural play.

The dish did have some prep but that wasn't the problem. I thought it was missing something...maybe add some garlic, who knows?! However we ate it up and it was satisfying.

Alot of work, but worth the effort. This is why I wouldn't make it too often.
