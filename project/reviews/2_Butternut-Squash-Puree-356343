I made half this recipe but didn't follow the cooking method. I don't really understand why they would need to drain for a day or 2. I had a 4# squash and it took forever to cook in the MW (it was halved). The potato only took 5 minutes total. Very simple flavor and perfect with the duck breast recipe in the menu.
