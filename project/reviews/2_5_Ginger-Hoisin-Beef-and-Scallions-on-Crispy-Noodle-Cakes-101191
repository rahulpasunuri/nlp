Even following the good advice posted here, I have been unsuccesful in making the noodle cakes. But I make the ginger-beef often, serving it as an entree or as an appetizer on crackers. Big hit!

It's good, no doubt, but I find it a bit too much work for what it is. I agree with other reviewers that only a thin film of oil is needed for good (crispy) result. They are better very fresh, so plan on serving them soon after making them.

These were a big hit at my last party. For the noodle cakes, I found it easier to pick up a few noodles with a fork and drop them into the oil, then pat them flat with a spatula quickly. They were very easy to make. The beef was a little sweet for my taste, next time I would use a little less hoisin sauce. They are a very dramatic looking appetizer!

I served this at a pan-Asian-themed Gourmet Club meal as an appetizer, and it was wonderful. It was far easier to make than I had expected, given all the reviewers' complaints about the noodle pancakes, but if the pan's hot enough and not too oily, it works brilliantly. We made about 50 bite-size versions, which were quickly snapped up, with guests clamoring for more.

This recipe is great! It's too bad some of the reviewers had problems with the noodle cakes. I found them delicious and easy to make. Don't use more than just a thin coat of oil on the pan when making the cakes. I added some kosher salt and extra green onions for more flavor and the beef was delicious as well.

I should have relied on the very first 2 reviews...the pancake is awful. No flavor, and not easy to make either.

I know for a fact, that if you would of used the clear noodles that are made from mung bean flour, they are sometimes called glass noodles, that they puff almost instantly and , if fresh oil is used, can create a sublime outcome. chef j switzer

I made these for a small party on Friday night and they were well received. I decided to use a small filet instead of an entire tenderloin and scale the recipe to size, and it worked really well. One 6 oz. filet made about 10 of these. I also substituted regular vermicelli since I couldn't find thin rice noodles. My only word of caution is to pick a good hoisin sauce, the one i got was *really* salty.

Fabulous, delicious crunch of pancake and the sweet, tart flavor of the hoisin sauce brought out the buttery quality of the beef. A winner

The beef was good, but the noodle cakes were ridiculously difficult and had zero taste. I read the last review, but felt that it couldn't be right and went ahead and tried this. It was a loser.

Have done over 20 of the recipes on this site and this is the only loser. Because of my great sucess on all of the other things I have made from Epicurious I will go on to other things. This is certainly not one that I would make again and I cannot think of any variations that would make it better.
