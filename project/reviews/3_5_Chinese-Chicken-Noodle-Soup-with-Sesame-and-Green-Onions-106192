This was definitely great and I look forward to continuing to play with the recipe. Here are some changes I made using what was on hand and they all worked great: I saw that some people had subbed peanut butter for the tahini so I used "better'n peanut butter" (which, for the record, is NOT better than peanut butter, but is really low fat and tastes great in this recipe). I also had some baby yellow bell peppers and sauteed those with the onions and cabbage and it was terrific. I used udon noodles, added at the last minute, and finally, I sliced up an avocado and served it with the soup. Terrific!

I love this soup! I have made it twice for people who have a cold. The ginger, garlic, and chili are definitely helpful for a stuffy nose. I have made it with the yokisoba noodles and with dry rice noodles. I prefer it with the rice noodles. They also seem to hold up better in leftovers.

This soup is very different from the average chicken noodle soup and is fantastic! Keep the noodles separate from the soup or they will ruin the leftovers, they dissolve after a while and make the soup mushy.

Wonderful soup. Added carrots & bean sprouts. My only issue with this soup was the tahini curdling, I will try adding hot broth to tahini mixture before adding to soup. Remember 14 oz of COOKED noodles :) I cooked 14oz of dry noodles & had WAY too many! Will definitely make this soup again.

Rating: 4
Yup, this one is definitely a keeper! It's on regular rotation at our house. The key is definitely the flavorful paste you add to the broth, which gives it a great depth and richness in a short amount of cooking time. Like a previous reviewer I use peanut butter instead of the tahini, and substitute tofu for the chicken and marinate it as directed. Some additional veggies and mushrooms make nice additions.

I had very high hopes after reading the reviews. I made it as written except I couldn't find tahini. Seemed to me something was missing.I assume it's the tahini. I will try harder to find some tomorrow - and see how that works out with my big old pot of leftovers.

We don't like Cabbage, we don't like spicy, and I don't think I've ever been partial to tahini either, HOWEVER: This soup proved to me that sometimes, the final result seems to be FAR more than the sum of the (disliked?) parts. This soup has a RICH tasting strong broth, (something that I really appreciate in a soup, I don't want a weak soup) the texture is fine, even though it's a little grainy from the tahini, you're too busy exclaiming about how Delicious it is to bother with noticing the texture. It's heavy on noodles, and that's ok, since the broth is strong enough to carry it! Please do notice that the noodles need to be scaled down in quantity if you're using dried noodles. around 6 oz dried noodles would be appropriate, instead of the fresh 14 oz. I used fresh, and I loved it! Another good bit of advice from other reviewers is to keep the noodles and broth separate in the leftovers, only add what noodles you need for today IN THE BOWLS, not into the broth. Then save noodles and broth separately in the fridge, so the noodles don't get mushy overnight. I cut the cabbage horizontally into 1/4" slices, and that seemed perfect. Try this soup, you won't regret it!!

I've been making this soup for several years, ever since finding @ Epicurious, just never took the time to review it! LOVE THIS SOUP! Shared the recipe with my sis, who said it tasted much like the broth she'd had in Japan @ noodle houses. I have made it as written, and had to sub items when didn't have them on hand....Just a good go to recipe! Works great for dieting, too!

I found this recipe very easy as I had most everything on hand. I love noodle soup and my husband wanted a light meal. I suggested this and he was all for it. I added extra vegetables to it to round it out. I added zucchini, cauliflower *wanted broccolli but he used it the night prior*, lots of carrots, sesame seeds and extra onions. When it was served, I set out sweet chili sauce and chinese hot sauce if neede as well as limes to zest it. It was fantastic.

Rating: 4
This is definitely a keeper. We used 6 cups of cabbage and used 2 cups less broth, which was a good balance with the aromatics. We used an extra 1/2 teaspoon of chili-garlic sauce and it was still mild. The tahini curdled a little bit but the noodles helped to break it up and the flavor the tahini adds is worth it.

Rating: 3
I was craving some comfort food to ease my cold symptoms and this was perfect. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of adding some corn starch to correct the curdled look, as per other reviewers suggestions, omitting the cilantro, and using wholewheat spaghetti instead of the japanese noodles. The whole family loved it. Next time, I would probably just through the veg into the broth rather than frying it first -- that step seemed unnecessary.

This soup was delicious! I kept the noodles separate and used 1 TBS peanutbutter instead of tahini. I also added mushrooms and dumplings and served some extra chili sauce on the side to add if I thought it needed some more spice. I ended up using it all. When I make it again, I'll add more vegetables, as there is definitely room for it. With a few tweaks, this is a wonderful, easy meal!

I had made this soup years ago and remembered it today because of a bad cold and wanting something to soothe my symptoms.

Excellent recipe!! The broth tastes fabulous!! I ended up using Thai stir fry noodles & the only ingredient I'd change/leave out would be the cilantro. I only used a 1/2 cup thinking 1cp would be way too much, & even with just a 1/2 the cilantro was too over powering. I'd use a 1/4 cup next time. Otherwise one of the BEST noodle recipe's I've tried.

I've been making this soup for years and have even been known to eat it for breakfast on a snowy winter morning (although I eat it all summer, too). It's one of those "never-fail" recipes. A reviewer's earlier comment to add cornstarch eliminated my only problem with this soup -the curdled effect. This is a stupendous soup!!

Rating: 4
I love making soups and I was excited about this one for two reasons: I had a head of cabbage that I didn't know what to do with and I have a cold, so Chicken Noodle Soup sounded really good. This is a pretty easy recipe, but I did make some adjustments (I made half a recipe, so the adjustments are according to that amount). I don't have any tahini, so I used 1 Tbsp of peanut butter and 1 tsp of sesame seed oil instead. I also used Tabasco sauce--to taste--instead of chili-garlic sauce. I used half a head of green cabbage and added a thinly sliced carrot and 4 oz. of sliced mushrooms just after I added the cabbage and onions to the pot (Note: I had to use 6 cups of chicken broth due to the extra veggies). I substituted whole wheat spaghetti for the noodles (not at all Chinese, but I'm trying to eat more whole grains right now). Finally, I added a squeeze of lime right before eating. Overall, it's a very satisfying soup and surprisingly filling. I might try variations in the future with other types of vegetables.

I just made this soup because I have a cold and wanted something spicy and comforting and it hit the spot. My only suggestion would be if at the end of preparation the soup tastes like it needs a little salt, add half a chicken bouillon cube instead for added richness.

I didn't read the comments before making this soup and low-and-behold, the tahini curdled. I added a little cornstarch to the broth later and it pulled everything together again. I will try it again following the other reviewer's comments because it did taste great and my kids even ate it. The chicken looked a little weird because of the marinade in soy sauce, but I thought it tasted great. I used rice sticks for my noodles and fried some in oil to make a bird nest on the side. The kids enjoyed that even more than the soup.

Rating: 3
Wonderful recipe! I was in a panic to find a chicken and cabbage recipe and proud that I had almost everything needed on hand. That said, I used mushroom broth vs chicken, and cognac vs sherry--sort of Asian meets French that resulted in a nice rich broth. (We also missed the cilantro.) I used 10 oz of dry noodles, which sucked up the broth by the time we went for seconds. Next time, I would follow the advice to keep them separate. We loved it, but my husband wants to add fresh vegetables as you would for Pho--hot peppers, bean spouts, cilantro, etc. He also wants to keep the broth the same! Everyone is happy to have leftovers for lunch.

Made this soup last night, with just a couple of notable changes to the recipe - had to use fresh Udon noodles as I couldn't find yakisoba, and they were definately a little chubby for the dish, and I left out one of the cups of chicken broth as it seemed rather excessive - it was a perfect balance. Thought I would need more garlic/chilli sauce as we do like our spicy stuff, but it was spot on without adding any. Also mixed the tahini mixture with a cup of boiling broth as several of the other reviewers had suggested, but when I popped this in it still curdled and looked a bit unappetising, but a good minute of boiling and a vigorous stir soon sorted that. The soup was totally delicious - hearty. warming very tasty and the chicken was deliciously tender. I have just downed 2 bowls of leftovers in record time for next day lunch, and whilst the noodles were a tad thicker a day later having absorbed more liquid, the soup was just as delicious as last night. I will certainly make this again (and again) with just one change. I thought it could do with more cabbage and I would probably miss out the "saute for 5 mins until tender" step as I thought the cabbage was a little overcooked.

So easy and delicious! Great for a cool day when you want a warm soup, but something a little different than the usual chicken noodle.

In getting ready to make this soup, I was reading some of the comments, and a frequent one is that the recipe calls for way too many noodles. It seems that some are using 14 oz of dried noodles, instead of 14 oz of FRESH called for by the recipe. This will definitely give you too many noodles. In fact, 14 oz. dried noodles will yield over 42 ounces of cooked noodles. In order to end up with 14 oz. of cooked noodles (which somewhat approximate the chinese fresh noodles when cooked al dente), one should use a little less than 5 oz. of dried noodles, or just over 1/4 of a pound of dried. The fresh noodles will expand a little, so if you want, you could use 5 or 6 oz. of dried. When making noodle soups, I usually keep the cooked noodles separate from the soup in my fridge, and add them when heating up the soup from leftovers. This prevents the noodles from absorbing all the broth and becoming mushy and starchy. So, if you find you haven't made enough for your whole pot of broth, you can always boil up a few more noodles for your last bowl! Keeping them separate also lets you freeze the broth for later, if the batch is too big. Hope this is helpful! Thanks for your reviews -- I can't wait for this soup!!!

What went wrong? I was hoping for the same results as everyone else. The soup was flavorful, but in the wrong proportions. I *might* make this again, but if I do it will be totally different - so no. Things I would change: less cabbage, maybe rice instead of noodles, less ginger as it seemed to overpower all of the other flavors, more garlic and spice. I might even substitute spinach for the cabbage. This makes a huge batch so you may want to halve or quarter this recipe. I will look for another recipe next time. :(

As others have noted, this makes a lot of soup. I usually make a half order, but keep the amount of garlic and ginger the same. Also, I substitute bok choy for the cabbage and use about 4 oz. of angel hair pasta, broken into small pieces. You can cook the chicken and the pasta directly in the soup, adding the pasta last. To get around the curdling problem with the tahini mixture, add about a cup of the hot soup to the bowl with the tahini mixture first, proofing it that way. Enjoy.

I first made this soup for a guy I was dating. He was a chef and I am rather challenged in the kitchen. I followed the recipe as closely as I could and he and I were both amazed at the flavors. Homerun! We were married about a year later. Now he does the cooking but the soup remains one of our all time favorites.

This came out fairly disappointing for how it even looked coming up to the step of adding in the tahini/ginger paste, chicken and marinade. After cooking the whole thing (including chicken) took on a dark grey hue that was unappetizing to say the least. The flavor in the final product got lost through the noodles, etc. Perhaps the noodles I used weren't the best (I used chinese rice vermicelli), but that alone doesn't account for the subpar results.

I love this soup every winter. There's just enough bite from the chili oil to start a mild sweat. The name is misleading, since cabbage is more noticeable than green onions. There's an Asian grocery near my home, and I use the lest expensive fresh noodles they offer on any given day.

Rating: 2
I added an extra tbls of crushed ginger and I also added dry sauteed (no oil) sliced cremini mushroom caps (about 1 cup), and I used cellphane noodles instead. The soup was WONDERFUL the first night. The ginger and cilantro were amazing together. The second day, not so great. The flavors all seemed to blend and nothing popped. I made this soup with the intent to freeze some and eat it over the course of a week or two. If you make this to be consumed within one day, then it's great. But it doesn't have staying power whether it's refrigerated or frozen (I tried both ways).

I've cooked and eaten a lot of Asian soups and this was very mediocre. On a positive not, I did mix the tahini with a bit of water before whisking it in with the other ingredients and didn't have the curdling issue that other reviews mentioned.

This recipe has been a life-saver for us this summer. We joined a CSA and have been getting some form of cabbage most every week. I use less broth(about 4 cups) to make it more of a noodle dish rather than a soup. I have used pork and beef as well. Great flavor - kids love it even with the chili sauce as it gets quite diluted. Enjoy!

Delicious. I left out the chili paste in the first cooking since I was making it for my 5 and 8-year olds and didn't want to risk it. I added sliced thai red chilis to my own bowl later. I also put in a cup of sweet corn. The kids loved it!

This recipe is fantastic. The first time I made it I had no Tahini so I ground up sesame seeds in a coffee grinder and it was terrific. Next time I had Tahini on hand and got the same excellent results. The Tahini does seem to cloud the broth and sit on top but you just stir and it goes right back into the soup. I had no fresh cilantro so used some dried, I did cut back on quantity as I do not care for a strong cilantro taste. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Gave some to my neighbors who claimed "incredible!"

Not yo Mama's chicken soup, this is the best chicken noodle soup I have ever eaten! One fourth of the recipe makes two entree size bowls. I used part turkey broth and part chicken broth, both homemade. I substituted red curry paste for the chili garlic sauce and added more ginger, probably a tablespoon or two more. I also cut up about 1/3 c. of cilantro stems I had after I used the tops and put that in the broth. I used about 1. c. broken angel hair for the noodles. The proportion of broth, noodles, chicken and veggies was just right. I can hardly wait to serve this at my hiking group's next soup lunch.

This soup was tasty, although the preparation was a little bit more involved than most soups I make. I recommend buying fresh asian noodles (I found them in the produce section of my supermarket, near the tofu), placing them in the soup bowls uncooked, and ladling the hot broth over them, they cook in no time, and it takes a step out of the preparation.

Excellent soup - my husband ate 4 bowls of it! I followed the recipe pretty closely but only added about 6 cups of chicken broth because I didn't have any more on hand. Also, I cooked the chicken first (paranoia) and used a chili sesame oil for the cooking. Then I added the cabbage and scallions. Added the additional sauce, cooked a bit more and then added the broth. One other change - I used 1 T chili miso paste and 1 T thai hot sauce as a substitute - perfect amount of spice. Next time, I might try bok choy as opposed to Napa Cabbage - just a thought.

This soup was a big hit with my family. I started the broth first,used bone-in chicken breast, deboned it & added the bones to the broth to give the stock some extra flavor. The recipe make a good big batch of soup and was quite hearty. It was a good thing, since everyone went back for seconds and thirds. This recipe will warm our bellys for years to come!

We really enjoyed the taste of this soup. It was filling and full of tasty flavors. The next time I make it, I think I'll add less fresh ginger and garlic chili sauce. It was quite spicy and maybe, we'll just have the chili sauce on the table. We love soup and this one is a keeper!

I made this soup twice - my lover had a cold - I decided to call it my magic soup - I think I ate more of it than he did!!! I made it twice and the second time I used stock instead of broth and it wasn't as good - also I got lazy and threw the noodles into the soup and cooked them there and that changed the taste a little too, I thought - so stick with the original recipe - it's wonderful.

This soup is delictible! Each time I ate it I just had to have seconds. Wonderful combination of flavors and easy to make, too!

Very good, filling soup - I had to use yellow onions instead of scallions and it was still great. Make sure you allow prep and cooking time - I found it took a lot longer than I had anticipated. Would definitely make this many more times.

I loved this soup! it is definitely on my list for an "impress your friends" dish. i couldn't believe how quick and easy it was too make. i added some shrimp at the last minute before serving. it was perfect as is...although i'm thinking i may experiment with a splash of lime sometime.

This is the 3rd time that I am making this recipe, and I can't get enough. The flavors are wonderful together! This is almost on par with my mama's Jewish Penicillin when it comes to curing colds. I had trouble with the broth separating after the tahini is added too, but a good stirring usually takes acre of it. I made it last time with Bok Choy instead of Nappa (celery cabbage) because I was out of Nappa - they are essentially interchangeable here - and cooked the chicken breasts in the broth. If you find the soup too salty, use tamari or low-salt soy. This is just too yummy for words.

The last reviewer must have slipped up somehow because this soup was absolutely fabulous. We ate it down to the last drop. I thought it was better than any with similar ingredients that I've had out. This will go into my repertoire.

Yuck! This was such a disappointment. It was entirely too salty and the cabbage practically disintegrated in the pot. After adding the tahini mixture, the broth became separated and grainy. The whole thing tasted like salty sesame seed oil. I was shocked to read all these positive reviews. Did I do something wrong? I followed the recipe to the letter.

I have made this soup several times, it has become a family favourite!

Great flavors! Good any day, but can see it replacing the more classic version of chicken noodle soup for when you're not feeling quite well. I refrigerated leftover noodles separately from broth to prevent sogginess.

A great recipe. Because I made this "on the fly" in my restaurant I made a couple of changes. I omitted the tahini and substituted thinly sliced regular cabbage for the napa. I received many raves from my staff and customers.

I really thought that this was an excellent, quick soup. I mashed both the garlic and ginger with a mortar and pestle into a paste instead of cutting it. I also doubled the amount of cabbage, and served it with lemon.

Wonderful! Went well on a cold, rainy day. I omitted the tahini (due to my own laziness) and it was still tasty. Dropped some off at my parents' house and my father raved! Mom ate it the next day for lunch. However, next time I might try to use ground ginger in place of fresh. The fresh was a little too strong for my taste.

I made this soup last night and it was a delicious. I think this is the kind of soup that is even better the next day. I will definately make this one again. I found Tahini in the health food store in the p-nut butter aisle.

I've made this soup several times already - it goes together really rather quickly. I've used Thai Chicken sausage in the soup for a little different texture.

This is a great soup recipe. I used fresh noodles and added more garlic/chili sauce. This recipe is a keeper as it reminds me of the saimin stands at home in Hawaii.

This recipe is very similar to a Vietnamese Beef Noodle soup that I make regularly. It is simply amazing the wonderful taste that the Cilantro brings to the oriental plate. It's not just for salsa. Please try this one. The tahini is in most groceries these days and nothing else is hard to find. I prefer Bok Choy to Napa Cabbage.

This recipe is outstanding. I did not have the tahine so as one earlier reviewer mentioned I left it out and still enjoyed it tremendously. Put some hoisin and chili sauce on the table for people to add if they liked. Hoisin was an extremely popular addition to add, with everyone giving it a big thumbs up. We are hugh soup eaters and this recipe will be made as frequent as any other recipe.

This is a great soup. Everyone at work loved it. I didn't use the tahini. It just didn't seem Chinese to me. I used all the other ingredients, maybe even a little more garlic chili sauce. I loadrd it up with suey choi. I think that's the same thing as Napa cabbage.

This will be one of my regular weeknight dinners. It has a very nice complexity of flavor. Keep the noodles separate from the soup and add them only at serving timel - that way they won't get mushy as leftovers.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. I will serve to a retirement community next week for Chinese New Year Celebration. My Korean friends all loved it. There are times when not every ingredient really matters but all of these ingredients truly make the best chicken noodle soup I have had, it is just a degree of how hot you want it.

We really enjoyed this soup and made a meal out of it by adding shitake mushrooms, bamboo shoots, snow peas, bean sprouts, and baby corn...and extra chili sauce of course. Delicious.

Our family absolutely loved this soup. The flavors are superb. I used baby bok choy because that is what I had and it turned out great.

This was a great soup. I thought the recipe looked a little odd, but decided to give it a try anyway. My family loved it, I will definately make it again.

This is an easy dish to make, and delicious. I have made it again, and again. The tahini listed in the recipe was foung at a health food store.
