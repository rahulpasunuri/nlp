I reviewed this recipe earlier and thought it was just OK. However, I just made it again and really thought it was great. The top was beautifully glossy--definitely not everyday!

I thought this was OK. I made it with ingredients that were on hand, so I felt the convenience of the recipe was the best part! I make another simple chocolate cake that is much better--World's Easiest Chocolate Cake, which is on this site.

I have made this cake many times and it's one of my favorites. I always serve the cake with a bit of whipped cream and fresh raspberries with either a dusting of powdered sugar or cocoa powder. It is always a favorite of guests.

This is my new favorite dessert to make! I used a 10 inch round cake pan, and I didn't have any overflow. I ended up baking about 70 minutes, but I have an old oven. I only buttered the sides of the pan, then layed parchment paper on the bottom. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy! I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!

This was a very good chocolate cake, & I thought I would mention that it works fine with Dutch process cocoa (hard to find anything else here). I used brewed coffee for the water, but otherwise followed the recipe & made it by hand. It was rich, very dark & great chocolate flavor. Not too dense or airy. Excellent with whipped cream & red currants.

I thought this was a very good basic chocolate cake. I think next time I would use brewed coffee instead of water, and use a larger pan. I used the pan size specified in the recipe and the cake overflowed over the edges a bit. I checked the cake at 50 minutes and the top was getting burned, so be sure to start checking for doneness early. I served the slices topped with some fresh cherry jam I had made earlier in the week, and some whipped cream. Even with being a little overcooked I didn't find the cake to be dry. But I have tried other recipes that have been dry and adding a tablespoon or two of vegetable oil to the batter makes a huge difference.

Made this for mothers day lunch, and it got rave reviews from the whole family. I thought all that water sounded sort of boring, so I replaced 1/3 cup of water with Kahlua instead. I think the cake ended up darker and richer tasting as a result.

Very fast and easy cake that makes THE MOISTEST and chocolatey-est cake ever! Truly delicious! I mostly make it just as written with powdered sugar on top, but have also made 2 batches and used 3 pans for a triple layer chocolate cake with mocha buttercream - also great!

This recipe is& Amazing the slightly dense but slightly airy cake is perfect with the powdered sugar. If the top is perfectly crusty with a center as I described above (slightly dense but also kind of airy) then it is perfectly cooked and anyone who eats it will immediately love it and want to know the recipe.

I like my cakes to be sweeter, but after a while the subtle taste of the cake grew on me. I like the recipe because I didn't already had all the ingredients in my pantry.

This is a very basic, easy, and tasty chocolate cake. Fine crumb, not too sweet. It's arguably not worth the effort, though... unless you use a high-quality cocoa powder, it doesn't really taste too different from a Duncan Hines mix. I served my cake with a caramel buttercream frosting, which complemented it nicely.

I made this last night to bring to work as a small token of appreciation to coworkers and it was well received. I used Hershey special dark cocoa and added a tsp of instant expresso to 11/3 c warm water. The cake is dense, moist and not too sweet just as the other reviewers noted. I needed the full 55 mins baking time. It rose beautifully and had a nice domed cake-top, i.e., no cave-in at the center! I would make it again but will enhance it with some topping. Easy recipe for a weekday cake indeed!

I have made this cake twice. The first time exactly as the recipe stated and it was a lovely simple mid-week cake. The second time I replaced the cocoa with dark chocolate cocoa and a mixture of dark rum and espresso for the water and it was over-the-top decadent, rich and just fabulous. A stellar dessert for a very special evening among friends

I wish I could give this recipe 3.5 forks. This cake is a really nice, simple one. I'm usually overwhelmed by the super chocolatey ones and their thick frostings, and although this cake was intense, it was not overwhelming. I did replace about 1/4 cup of water with some 1% milk I needed to use up. The cake rose quite high--to the top of a standard-sized springform pan. The batter was quite rich and dense-looking (probably due to all that butter!), but the outcome tasted very light and strongly of chocolate. I was pleased that it didn't have an overwhelmingly sugary taste. I plan on making this for company and serving it with candied lemon peels.

I love this cake. I had to convert the measures into grams and mls first has I'm in the UK so don't work on cups, but it turned out perfectly. The whole family loved it and I've made it 5 times so far. It never stays in the box for more than 3 days. It's so moist and morish.

as many others before me have noted, this cake comes out a little dry and the baking time listed in the recipe is a guideline only (my cake took 40 minutes). on the other hand, it's also dense, chocolatey, and not too sweet, and the dryness is easily covered by a sauce (i used a chocolate glaze made with strawberry jam), a dollop of whipped cream, or a scoop of ice cream. this certainly is not the best chocolate cake you'll ever eat, but it is a quick and easy cake to bake with ingredients you have on hand (thus the title of the recipe). if you want something flawlessly indulgent or need to bake a cake for a special occasion, pass this one by. however, if you happen to have a craving for chocolate on a weeknight at ten o'clock, take an hour and whip up this cake. it will be worth it.

This is a great simple chocolate cake. I use a high-quality natural (NOT dutch processed) cocoa powder with fantastic results. Instead of mixing the cocoa in with the dry ingredients, I mix it with boiling water and stir until all the lumps are out (use the amount of water the recipe calls for). Let this cool before adding to the butter mixture. I find this really enhances the chocolate flavor of the final product. For small gatherings, I sometimes halve the recipe and bake in a 6" round pan that is 3" deep.

This cake is just sugary; there is very little chocolate or cocoa flavor to it. Easy though it may be, I would not bother to make it again

This recipe is PERFECT for cupcakes. The fluffy (rather than liquidy) batter is easy to divide into muffin tins, making 24 moist and chocolatey cupcakes ready for frosting. Since the recipe is so simple, it leaves you time to focus on the frosting. I made frosting according to the recipe for "Brownie Cupcakes with Peanut Butter Frosting" at this site, which uses up the other 1/2 stick of butter from the cake recipe (2 sticks total). Delicious!

I read the reviews and decided played around with the recipe a bit. Omitted half a stick of butter and replaced with a 1/4 cup light sour cream and used milk instead of water. Added chunks of good milk chocolate. 50 minutes of baking was too long in my oven. I served it with a strawberry sauce but my brother still thought it was "good, but dry". I'll make this again with the full amount of butter, add a 1/4 cup sour cream or applesauce, and bake for only 40 minutes. I like the simplicity of the recipe.

I know there are epicures out there who will want to thrash me for this, but I modified this to see if I could create something my husband and I could eat on the south beach diet. I used whole wheat flour and brummel and brown. I used half sugar twin brown and half fructose. It came out moist and chocolately with no aftertaste, and my husband and I were in heaven. I know it's not absolutely legal in all respects, but it's close enough, and we really needed a treat. I bet it's great as written, too.

I made this cake for a barbecue with 4 adults and 5 kids. It was easy and terrific - nice chocolate taste (not too dark or too bitter, so the kids liked it, but not too overly sweet either). Because we keep kosher and I was serving meat, I did substitute margerine for the butter, but it wasn't noticeable. I also baked it in a 13x9x2 pan, rather than a round pan (it needed to be baked for a shorter period - about 35 minutes). I also frosted it with a basic chocolate buttercream frosting (which did, of course, make it much sweeter as a whole). Four days later, the cake is still moist and tasty. It is a great basic recipe to keep on hand.

Rating: 3
It's called an everyday cake because it's simple to make, it doesn't result in a lot of dirty bowls and dishes, it doesn't require a lot of time and it uses things you have on hand. Sure it's nothing special, but a good basic cake. I used an 8" round pan, instead of 9. The cake did not sink - it did crack a little on top, but retained its shape nicely. I followed all ingredients and directions exactly. It only needed 53 minutes in my oven and was VERY moist.

Nothing fancy here. This recipe is exactly what it advertises itself to be: A simple example of a cocoa cake. Like many other things in this world, it is often difficult to do the simple things well, and they are often the best. This recipe achieves it's goal. The cake is perfectly moist, is not challenging to make, and simply delicious.

This cake is fantastic comfort food. It is moist and dense and needs no frosting, and is delicious even made with cheap cocoa. It is also good after a few days in the refrigerator. It will be even better made with fine cocoa, particularly Scharfenberger or Valhrona.

31/2 forks. I didn't find this to be dry at all. It was easy to make and came out perfectly eventhough I rushed. I think quality ingredients have a lot to do with the results. I used Valrhona cocoa. I would hate to see this recipe made with Hersheys or Ghiradelli (which in my mind is the most overrated chocolate ever). There is, however, no way you could eat this every day without turning into a blimp.

Seriously, go look at the Chocolate Stout recipe on this site. This recipe is the same as a half recipe of that one as long as you add about 1/2 cup sour cream to the batter. That will keep it from being dry. I've done this recipe using expresso instead of water (and adding 1/2 cup sour cream) and using Guinness stout instead of water, with the sour cream. Either substitution will elevate this recipe into something sensational!!

When my husband and I had surprise out of town guests, I looked for something I could make from ingredients I had on hand, after work. I did not wind up making this cake due to the less-than-stellar reviews, so have not rated it. I decided to make Elodie's chocolate cake from this website, and we LOVED it! Pulled it together in about 15 minutes, baking it while we chatted and ate dinner. Just a suggestion...

Rating: 3
This recipe is very similar to one from Hershey's (on the back of the cocoa can!) One note: Since the only leavener is baking soda, the cake requires some acid to react properly. The brown sugar may provide enough, but using natural (nonalkhalized) cocoa should do the trick. To avoid dryness, make sure to remove the cake promptly, as overbaking will result in a dry cake.

I liked this cake. I'm not much of a dessert maker and I managed to whip this recipe up for guests and serve warm. I live in Germany and most Europeans find American cakes too sweet but not this one. It was a simple no-nonsense cake that would be easy to dress up. Baking time was closer to 45 minutes.

I am a student at the Academy here at Exeter. Yesterday was my friend's birthday and I made this cake. It was a good, from-scratch cake to make if you don't have a lot of time. THe recipe says it takes 2 and 3/4 hours, but it was definitely less than that. I baked mine for about 40 minutes instead of the recommended 55 after reading some of the other reviews and testing the cake at 40. Also, instead of buttering and flouring the pan I simply used was paper. This was helpful - I could get the cake out easily without having to wait an hour and there was less cleaning up to do afterwards. The cake itself is ok, reminds me a bit of Betty Crocker which would have definitely taken less time, but the recipe is easy. Besides, once you tell people it's made from scratch, they automatically think it's better than a mix ;-)

very moist, a heavy cake it was good but didn't have much chocolate flavor, but I melted raspberry jam and some confectionary sugar together let it cool and poured it over it and then dusted it with confectionary sugar on top. I just love chocolate and raspberry together. I was to die for with the raspberry sauce over it. I would definately make it again with the sauce over it, yum.

I have made this cake 5 times so far with wonderfully moist results. The cake was never dry and never sunk. The only thing I did differently was sift the dry ingredients instead of whisking. I always use a thermometer for proper temperature in the oven.I have used Valrhona and Droste cocoa powder and both with great results. Give it a try again for those who experienced the dry cake.

I liked this cake. I did substitute dark brown sugar for the light brown and it came out just fine. Also, I used a pan a bit smaller than recommended and it puffed up nicely in the middle. No sinking like others have observed. Use a GOOD vanilla with this recipe. I served it, unfrosted, with vanilla ice cream on the side, and also made ice cream sandwiches with it. It's not a chocolate taste explosion, it's an "everyday cocoa cake"

I agree that this cake is a bit dry. Since enduring re-location from California to UT for grad school, I have found that some of the things I bake tend to come out more dry here. *sigh* Made a liqueur wash and that helped with the dryness.

The recipe as is comes out a bit dry, but if you reduce the flour to 1 1/2 cups, and replace 2/3 cup of water with heavy cream, you end up with a wonderful cake which is very moist. Also note that the cocoa used makes a big difference. For a treat try using Ghirardelli unsweetened cocoa. Finally, on my third try I used a bundt pan, and replaced the confectioners sugar with a buttercream frosting. Absolutely wonderful.

I made this twice. Very easy. Disappeared quickly in my house! Even my 8 year old son took a piece to school as a snack after lunch. I tried to make it in one of the Williams-Sonoma decorative cake pans -- that part was not too successful but it sure tasted good. Was not dry at all. Will certainly make this again.

This is such a simple recipe. I added a 1/3 cup of applesauce to the recipe because of the other reviews of it being dry. It turned out great! Nice flavor. And yes it fell a little in the middle but not that much. Only baked it for 45 minutes. Plenty of time. The middle has a nice fudgy texture to it.

I should have read the review before making the cake. I think the taste is good, but it is dry. I tried a slice w/some cherry preserves & it helped. Since I just made it, I may try to save it by slicing in the middle & putting a preserve layer or maybe try adding chocolate syrup as suggested below. My husband ate it w/some ice cream & he liked it a lot.

A fine everday satisfying chocolate cake. I made it on a weeknight for a co-worker's birthday. Everyone raved! The birthday girl (age 60+) said it reminded her of what her mother used to bake. The compliments were disproportionate to the effort -- people must just not be used to regular, from-scratch food! Sure sweetened that workday! Easy to make, baked in a deep 9" pan for 1 hour, it puffed beautifully. I made a glaze that I put on the next morning: 1 T. orange juice w/ 1/2 c. confectioner's sugar whisked in. I'll definitely make again.

This was the worst cake I've ever tasted. In fact, there was no taste. It was so bland and unflavorful...what a disappointment.

If you have to eat it, put lots of ice cream and Hershey's syrup on it, it needs it.

Fabulous. I've fallen in love with another chocolate cake recipe from this site, but to be honest, this recipe is much more simple and so satisfying. All of my guests loved that it was a firm and flavorful cake but not too sweet. I would say bake it for only 45 minutes for sure. I did't have any isses with the middle "sinking." After 45 minutes, it was perfect. I served it with whipped cream flavored with vanilla and confectioners sugar. Yummmm. Can't wait to have some more tomorrow!

I will definitely make this recipe again. As some other reviews have mentioned, I had some extra batter so I went ahead and made a few cupcakes out of it. I did not have a problem with the cake sinking in the middle at all. I cooked the cake for 55 minutes and think that next time I will only bake it 45 minutes so it will be a bit more moist. I think it would be good to add some chocolate chips to the recipe as well!

Delicious. I was prepared to not like it as much as a recipe called Crunchy Cocoa Cake that I've been making for a couple of years, however, it's a cake I'll make many times, I'm sure. The recipe I mention is lower in fat and sugar. With the added crunchy topping, however, they may be about equal. I love the deep chocolate flavor, the texture, and the simple elegance with the powdered sugar sprinkled on top. My cake (just a little over an hour out of the oven), did not fall in the middle. It took careful testing to be certain it was done. Because I didn't have a 9" or 10" pan (mine measured about 8 1/2"), I ended up throwing about 3/4 cup of the batter away so it wouldn't spill over. All in all, very much worth the first-time fuss! It will be easier the next time.

I followed the recipe exactly and the cake was moist and uniformy dense. I used a deep 9" pan and it filled it nicely. However, we thought the taste rivaled a mix. No depth, no richness. I want desert to taste GOOD!

This was too much batter for a 9 inch pan. I used a 10 inch pan and it was a perfect fit. I don't flour my cake pans. I don't like the crust it makes. I just spray generously with a good non-stick vegetable oil spray and that works fine. This cake was very dry. I baked mine 53 minutes. If I made it again, I'd check it at 45 minutes in a 10 inch pan then check for doneness. But I won't make it again. Betty Crocker cake mix is delicious and a lot less work especially if serving as plain as in this recipe. If you want to try this, I'd suggest having some ice cream on hand to moisten it in your mouth.

I made this cake when I was craving chocolate and brought it into work and it was a hit! Even people who don't like cake thought it was wonderful. I didn't have any problems with the cake sinking in the center. It puffed up when it baked and then sank down to an even level with the rest of the cake. I will defintely make this cake again. This is a cake for chocolate lovers (and even those who aren't).

Rating: 4
The cake is exqisitely moist and delicious. The problem is that the center sinks as it cools. The cake still tastes wonderful and actually, the center takes on a fudgy taste (which my family just loved). But, when I want to make it for an occasion the dropped center doesn't make for a nice appearance.
