Really tasty, and very simple to make. I used chicken drumsticks, and sliced the shallots instead of mincing them. The shallots get nice and sweet, which helps to balance the acidity of the red wine vinegar.

Made it according to recipe except I left the shallot in larger dice and threw cauliflower florets in to brown toward the end. Very good, but next time, I will add more red wine vinegar and more shallots.

My "go to" recipe. Always pleases my guests. The only time it went wrong was when I added anise to the recipe. The recipe works as is.

Really enjoyed this. Grilled the chicken as mentioned, and the slight char excellent. No parsley, but red wine vin/shallot flavor on the chicken was wonderful.

This made a great weeknight supper. Next time I will throw in some potatoes to catch the drippings.

I added cauliflower to the roasting pan with the chicken and shallots. It got brown and wonderful and picked up the chicken and shallot flavor. I would keep the shallots in larger pieces next time. They disintegrated during the cooking and weren't as flavorful as I'd like

so easy to prepare ! used chicken thighs only & also started skin-side down, a big hit with the whole family

This was quite good, and very simple, as others have said. I used two leg quarters (only cooking for two), and 2 tblsp each of the oil and the RED WINE vinegar, same amount of shallots as the recipe called for. Started the chicken skin-side down and the skin did brown up nicely this way. It seemed like many of the reviewers who didn't like it used balsamic...the recipe calls for red wine vinegar, not balsamic! They are not the same thing, for pete's sake. I served with potatoes lyonnaise, a watercress and radish salad, and a nice chilled rose. Very nice, simple french dinner.

I make this dish all the time, sticking to the recipe as is. I find some of the other reviewers comments about this dish a bit strange. It's French farmhouse cooking, not Emeril. Adding tons of garlic and more of everything sounds like people have been watching too much of Louisianas clown prince of cuisine. Sometimes subtle flavors are good. I think garlic would completely ruin this dish. Also, describing it as a braise is not accurate, because there is no cooking with liquid. Three tablespoons of vinegar for 4 pounds of chicken isn't braising. So long as you start the cooking with the meat skin side down, then turn to skin side up for the last half of cooking, the skin will be brown and crisp.

This is a delicious and simple dish. My husband and I both enjoyed it on a cool fall evening. One note -- the author suggests that sprinkling the dish with parsley gives it a slight anise taste. I suspect what it was sprinkled with was not parsley but chervil which has an anise flavor, which parsley does not. The French use chervil a lot when it is in season and it looks almost like parsley, just a little more lacy. It is not often available fresh in the US, but is very easy to grow, especially if you allow it to reseed each spring and fall. I used chervil instead of parsley in this recipe and found the flavor a little more subtle. I am sure parsley would be fine when chervil is not available. Dried chervil is no better than dried parsley.

I made this for friends, served alongside a walnut-arugula salad and over-roasted baby red potatoes. It was deceptively delicious, for how simple it was, and I didn't even have to separate chicken - I bought a whole separated bird. Delicious!

Loved it. Made it with chicken thighs only -- enjoyed the sweet/sour flavor of the sauce. Also, I agree with earlier reviewers: brown the chicken first to put a crust on it and get a good fond in the pan. Why sacrifice that added kick to flavor and texture?

Dull, dull, dull. I was looking forward to this one, and it just seemed really bland to me. Maybe red wine instead of the vinegar, maybe some garlic - it definitely needs something to give it some zest. Its easy, but why bother with something boring?

Rating: 3
Good but not great; the flavors are very sublte (as can be expected by the minimalism of the ingredients), and I had upped the quantities as suggested by the other reviewers. The thing that bugged me was the greasiness of the dish after being fried and baked in oil. Maybe will try this with decreased oil, or braised.

Rating: 3
I used more shallots, and the flavor was very nice. I wish I'd browned the chicken first though, partly for flavor and partly for presentation. (Without browning, the chicken came out looking a little pinkish due to the balsamic vinegar.) An easy, tasty dish.

Will use more shallots next time. I did not start with a whole chicken, and found that bone-in breast provided needed juiciness. Didn't have the suggested wine on hand, but it went quite well with malbec, a meaty wine in its own right.

Not rated yet..but this dish will benefit from browning the chicken on the stove first. The maillard reaction will intensify the flavors a LOT. Any braise should involve the essential first step of browning! I will also sweat the shallots first as well.

Wow! This was soooo simple and delicious! I followed the recommendations and used more vinegar and shallots. I also tried it with boneless breasts as well as pieces on the bone, and it was great either way. A big time saving recipe that doesn't tast like it. :o)

This is an easy, delicious recipe. Chop the shallots in your processor and it takes no time at all. The chicken comes out very moist due to the high temperature and it is infused with the oil-vinegar and shallot mixture. We eat this white rice, ladling some of the shallots over top. Wonderful!!!

I took the advice of other reviewers and added more shallots. I also quartered some mushrooms and threw them in during the last 20 minutes. This is a nice dish to make when you don't have a variety of ingredients on hand.

I gave this recipe 3 forks and will make it again because it has a lot of promise. Next time I will use more shallots, a few cloves of garlic, more vinegar, some butter, and (as suggested by another chef)herbs de provence. I served it with thinly sliced red potatoes fried in olive oil garnished with sea salt and rosemary. YUM!

I hate chicken breasts, but hubby will eat only white meat. I used very large (is there any other way to get them when sold separately?) and followed the recipe to a t. I can only say that i wished I'd used a cut up chicken instead of the breasts. I agree with the previous reviewer. MORE shallots...like 10 and more vinegar and possibly some slivered garlic...All in all a good recipe.

Rating: 3
A very good recipe. All I can say is- more. Use more shallots and more vinegar (balsamic) and you'll want more!! Use oil according to your taste. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts which obviously cooked much faster. I also served it with potatoes roasted in the same pan and asparagus.

I used balsamic vinegar in this dish and wow! The first time I made it, I had to physically restrain my husband from licking the roasting pan. I wised up the second time and tripled the sauce amounts, degreased the liquid, and poured it over orzo. This is one of the best chicken recipes I've ever prepared!

My family loved this dish. I made it with a good olive oil, balsamic vinegar and French sea salt. I omitted the parsley. I used chicken thighs instead of chicken parts and it all cooked evenly.It was simple and delicious.

I changed this dish to reduce the fat by skinning the chicken and using a mister for the olive oil. Also, I used balsamic vinegar rather than the red wine vinegar. It came out savory and low fat. It's also easy to do in quantity. The entire family loved it!

this dish didn't strike either of us as being anything out of the ordinary. but we will try it one more time--on the grill, as someone suggested.

I get raves every time I make this chicken and it is so easy. For added ease I toss some quartered new potatoes around the edge of the pan and sprinkle them with extra salt. I also line the roasting pan w/ tin foil to save on clean up. Simply delicious!

This is a underated dish. Do it on the grill in lieu of the oven. Use parsley like its free while grilling. This dish is a hit at home with two adults and two children, that makes it a winner.

This is wonderfully aromatic with the parsley and wine vine and the chicken is tender and delicate in flavor. The flavors are subtle and delicious. Not all food has to blow your head off with kick to be great!

I saw the dish made on the show and thought, "Wow, that looks great and it's soooo simple." Then I got to this site and was discouraged by all the bad reviews that I almost bagged it entirely. Lucky I didn't. I don't know if I just had the right amount of shallots and red wine vinegar, but mine turned out terrific. The only miscue was that the skin side baking did not brown very well (bone side did well)...so I hit it with the broiler for a bit of crispness/color. As for the extra oil in the bottom...I took the chicken out of the baking dish during the 10 minute rest so it didn't sit. In fact, I used the oil (which was nicely infused with roasted shallots) to make a salad dressing. YUM! And guess what...the chicken was good cold too.

This was easy to make and played to rave reviews with my wife who does not usually like chicken. The shallots make this dish delectable and a Pinot Noir goes well with this dish.

Just like some of the previous reviews, found it bland. I tried to cut down on the oil as suggested but so much came out of the skin, it was still oily. Although it was moist and the shallots caramelised, I have better chicken recipes.

It tasted okay, but I have a similar recipe that just uses onion and wine under a roasting chicken that is stuffed with Boursin cheese--I like better

I found the chicken rather bland, but it's worth making again just because it's so easy, and the shallots are scrumptious.

Rating: 3
This was delicious and soooo easy. My shallots did not turn dark and carmelize, as the introduction said. Perhaps my oven was not really at 450? But the chicken was moist and yummy. A little greasy. I could have used 2 1/2 tablespoons of oil for a 3 1/2 lb chicken. Served with wild rice.

Simple. Elegant. Versatile. Delicious. I made this using halved Cornish Hens, simply because I had them on hand. Fresh parsley was not available, so I used dried & it still really contributed to the aroma and presentation.

This dish typifies the French country cuisine...it's simple, delicious, and takes full advantage of fresh, easy-to-procure ingredients. I also love the lack of long cooking times.
