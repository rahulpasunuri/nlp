I never made stock like this before and it was really good--will definitely be making again.

The thought of touching giblets was really gross, but OMG was it worth it. This makes great stock and it was so easy, even I could do it.

I'm preparing for Thanksgiving again this year and my husband, who is VERY picky about his gravy, specifically requested "that great gravy from last year", which was this recipe. I made it with 3 cups chicken broth, 1/2 cup beef broth, and the rest water, and it was nice and rich. I'll do the same again this year.

Drove 600 km to visit family and cook Thanksgiving dinner (Canadian) last month and needed a stock recipe quick. Found this one and is now my favourite.

I don't know about the rest of you, but this is how I always make my gravy- It makes wonderful gravy so try it if you haven't already
