Absolutely fantastic! I have made this several times since the recipe was originally published in 1996. My only problem is bubbles appearing on the top of the buttercream layer. Anybody have a fix?

I had high hopes, but I found this way too sweet and like others, my buttercream layer was too runny.

This dessert was extremely rich, actually too rich. It was like eating a stick of butter. Keep in mind three sticks of butter for the butter cream frosting. This was a simple ganache turned into an over the top chocolate mess. Not worth the effort. It dawned on me that there were 6 raw eggs in the buttercream frosting. Not good. Sometimes less is more. This recipe gave more new meaning. Will not do again.

I made the crust and first layer one night after work. The next day I made the buttercream layer and let refrigerate for another day. This is the BEST cake recipe. Everyone raved about it and insisted on the recipe. It's wonderful and relatively simle to make.

Wow, my book club loved this cake. I made it with Bailey's instead of kahlua. So rich but so decadent.

This is, as previously mentioned, VERY rich, but a show-stopper - absolutely delicious. The Kahlua taste lingers in your mouth. It was time consuming, but worth it. The recipe was requested several times from those who had it.

This "cake" needs more than just butter and chocolate. The crust is fine and all of the reader comments advising to beat it long enough and to use a thermometer assure good results in making it, but it really is just like eating chocolate flavored butter. I had a dinner party where each couple brought a decadent chocolate dessert and the kahlua chocolate fantasy cake was definitely our least favorite of all of the desserts. I've experimented with adding peanuts and caramel sauce onto a slice and find that helps a bit, but one could save a lot of trouble and just go buy a Snickers bar instead!

This cake is unbelievable rich, but beautiful and delicious. I can only eat a very small sliver, but I received rave reviews to make this once a year. I also agree, you must use a thermometer and be ready to invest some time. Good luck!

I was introduced to this cake in 1997 and have loved it ever since! my husband loves it so much, and he's not even a sweets type of person, that he begged our friend/wedding coordinator to make it as his groom's cake in 1999 (she made 2 just for him!). Because it is so time consuming, I only make it for special occasions. This cake is mostly enjoyed by those who love rich chocolate desserts, all others find it overwhelming...

I followed other reviewer's advise to slowly pour the syrup and also the butter when making the buttercream. So that work it out well. However, when slicing the cake to serve, the crust did not come out with the cake. Also although we knew this was a rich cake, it was way too rich. My chocolate lover friends could not even finish the small portion I served them. There are better cakes out there. I will not do this one again.

Rating: 4
I loved, loved, loved this recipe as did everyone else who had a taste. Have made it with or without the Kahlua and it tastes great! I tried to cut down on the butter but it appears to be a setting agent, so have to use the prescribed quantities. Well worth the time and effort.

Rating: 4
Delicious BUT...I would add 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of Cream of Tartar to the Butter Cream layer because the first time around it was incredibly runny. Not sure what I did wrong but I notice that many had the same problem initially. Read all of the others feedback as well. Very helpful. Be sure to add the sugar syrup very slowly, like a tbsp at a time for several seconds of beating. Also, the butter should be added maybe a heaping tablespoon at a time. You'll need to leave it beating for about thirty minutes to get it back to nice shiny peaks. Add chocolate/kahlua only after you've gotten it to this point. definitely a show stopper but would recommen the multi day approach. Crust, first layer on day one, butter cream on day two (take your time), then party on day three. You'll be glad that you did and so will your guests!

So elegant and sophisticated, yet decadent and sinful at the same time! Because it is so rich, for next time I will either reduce both the buttercream, and ganache amounts, or prepare it in a larger pan to yield smaller servings. I had a slight time constraint so to save time in between layers, I cooled the ganache in an ice bath just to a pourable consistency, then refrigerated will preparing the buttercream. By the time it was done, the first layer had firmed up enough to apply the second. You definitely want that separation of layers for a nicer presentation. Perfect with a freshly drawn espresso.

This is an AWESOME dessert! Very rich, delicious and a definite show stopper. Great to make for company, the cake serves a lot of people. It's a bit time consuming because of the steps, but not actually all that difficult. It's much easier if you have a stand mixer. If you want to wow your guests or family, this is the one to make.

This was wonderful. Very rich so you don't need or want a big slice. I omitted the nuts from teh crust because some won't eat them and it turned out great. Not as time consuming as I expected and I don't have a stand mixer.

Making this cake is a time-consuming project but well worth the effort if you want to leave your guests gushing over your culinary talents. The chocolate layer doesn't set in three hours (but don't panic) and you must use a thermometer to heat the buttercream to 240 degrees (don't exceed that temperature or you'll have rock candy). Then you must mix for 9-10 minutes. From the reaction of 12 people though, each of whom took a wedge home,it may well become my signature dessert.

For the chocolate layer, try replacing about 1/4 cup of the cream with 1/4 cup Kahlua. This is very rich!

Wow!! I wanted a chocolate dessert to really impress my husband's family and this was it!! It was very easy to make, although I didn't have a candy thermometer, so I had to just wing it. I used Frangelico instead of Kahlua and it tasted great. I will use the crust recipe for other pies. This cake weighs a ton!

Rating: 2
Very time consuming. My buttercream turned out too runny-maybe I should have let it stay at that temp longer- but it said to simmer and I did- 1 hour to get the sugar water to temp. Maybe I took "sim" too literally. Even though it was running down the sides after I took the pan sides off- I said it was an experiment dessert (I brought a winner too) everone loved it. So even though it was not what it was supposed to be it was still a hit. I will try it a again, maybe using a different buttercream recipe.

Astounding! People moaned and swooned. I used an orange liqueur, perfect with the dark chocolate. And if the buttercream is slow to thicken, try setting your workbowl in larger bowl of cold water. Fabulous!

Although I am reluctant to dis recipes that I find on this wonderful site, I have to say that this was disappointing. Perhaps I was expecting too much after reading other reviews but thought this was way too much work for something that too closely resembled a chocolate mousse. And I think I'm being generous with that comment.

Rating: 4
served at a dinner party - no one could talk, just moaned. Everyone loved it and I will make again anytime. Bought the candy thermometer after others' comments and glad. Only problem- I put on the porch after the second layer in the winter and the butter separated due to much too cold air. But no one noticed except me. A keeper for sure.

Oh my gosh, this was Wonderful. I have made it twice so far, and had to share the receipe with everyone. It was easy to make, thanks to some of the suggestions from other reviews. I can't wait to try it with maybe a mint or raspberry liqueur.

This was a very rich, delicious, desert. It was relatively easy to make, as long as you have a stand mixer for the buttercream. I substituted pecans for walnuts in the crust- they were great. Also, I used half salted and half unsalted butter in the buttercream, it gave it a nice flavor. I would definitely make this again- YUM!

Rating: 4
The only problem I had was with the sugar syrup seizing up when I added it to the eggs (I wound up with a few "sugar chunks" in the buttercream). The crust & bottom layer were fantastically easy to make. I think I will follow another cook's advice and use a standing mixer and add the syrup as slowly as possible. My buttercream layer was not runny as others commented, to which I think the key is to get the sugar syrup up to the right temperature, as it thickens considerably after it reaches 220 degrees or so. I decorated with chocolate covered almonds dipped in gold dust.

I've made this dessert, as written, several times and have always impressed guests. If I were to experiment with this recipe at all, I would try other liquors to vary the taste. For example, a Chocolate Creme-de-Mint Fantasy Cake would sound interesting.

Found this recipe on the web-site over two years ago and just got around to making it the first time this past January for a friends birthday. Everyone loved it and I garnered many rave reviews. Made it again this last week for another birthday dinner party and even though everyone said they could eat a whole slice, they would share one, everyone at the table finished their own slice without sharing. Think it is great as it is, might sprinkle chopped nuts on the top, or try different flavored liquers but everything else is just great

This cake is so rich that when I picked it up to transport it to a picnic it was actually heavy. A small piece does satisfy. I made it exactly the way the recipe stated. Next time I will make some changes. I may decrease the butter in the crust by about 1 tablespoon or so and I don't think the pan has to be oiled. Also, thinking about trying whipping cream instead of heavy cream. Buttercream layer was thick so might cut that in half. Chocolate chips work out well. Made crust and 1st layer one day and the top layer the next day. Simple and fun to make. The two crucial steps seem to be a candy thermometer and beating the egg mixture about 10 minutes. The buttercream layer turned out very thick and delicious. Will also try Baileys next time or a combination of the two liquors. I have cooked and baked a lot of good foods and this was the fist time someone told me that they would pay me to make this for them.

I made this for my Mom's birthday and it was a hit! It is very rich, but quite delicious. You definitely wouldn't want a second helping right away. Everything set up great and when I pulled off the sides of my springform pan I was pleased with the results. Will this one again for sure.

Rating: 4
This was delicious! A lot of work but worth the effort. I was in a hurry, so as soon as I prepared the bottom layer and refrigerated it - I began the second layer and poured it on top (it had not chilled 3 hours, only about 1 hour) and it still turned out perfect! I used my coffee grinder to grind the nuts as I do not have a food processor and it worked great!

Rating: 4
sooo rich, you could just taste all the butter. Honestly, I think I would be happier with just the bottom two layers. Thanks to all the reviewers...I didn't have a candy thermometer, but it came out perfectly with simmering the sugar water for 15 minutes. Seemed totally professional.

Rating: 4
The crust is easy - don't use premade - yuch! Chop the almonds and walnuts finely in a food processor. Also, you must have a candy thermometer. It took my sugar-water 15 minutes to get to 240. And remember, as one reader stated, the egg yolk mixture does take about 9 minutes of mixing to get to the desired consistency. Serve this cake with coffee or milk and a side of vanilla frozen yogurt or vanilla ice cream. It is too rich on its own, but delicious!

I cheated and used a premade crust and crunched it into a spring form pan. I recieved rave reviews from everyone. The cake is so rich a thin sliver will do. It is delicious!! definitely worth the work.

I can only add my resounding agreement to the other four fork reviews. This cake does indeed have the essence of professional preparation and was definitely worth the investment in a candy thermometer to ensure that the buttercream layer thickened properly. I had no trouble with runniness with the buttercream, however, it did take approximately 8-9 minutes of mixing on high to reach the desired consistency. Thanks to previous reviewers I began assembling the various parts two days in advance which made the cake simple to prepare. At another reviewer's suggestion, I also decorated the top with almonds dipped in chocolate and sprinkled it with chocolate shavings. Not only did it look spectacular, but had a sinfully decadent taste to match. A must try!

This recipe takes some time and care but it wasn't difficult (I'm a beginner)and well worth the results. Everyone truly enjoyed it. It is very rich, so small servings are a must. This dessert overshadows anything else you make so make it alone or next time I might make a smaller version.

Not realy a cake, but a great explosion of chocolate. Easy to make - the first two layers are a breeze, but start the day before you plan on serving it. Big hit at a dinner party and leftovers at my office! You only want a very small serving - this should serve at least a dozen.

Great, rich, easy-but takes your full attention. I needed it for a Friday morning & started it on Wednesday evening. (the crust & first layer one night- the last layer the second night-decorating Friday a.m.)Do a layer & leave it alone overnight to settle.If you're up for a challenge-DO IT!! Follow instructions to a tee, use unsalted butter & a candy thermometer. For buttercream layer, it doesn't really instruct well about the melting of the choc.-since you're not melting it "with" anything else, be sure to melt it very slowly(low heat)-It's great, I'm an Italian cook & was told that among all my other creations, THIS might be the best!!! Have fun!! :o)

I just made this cake for a family gathering we are having today and cut a small, very thin slice to taste it. Delicious & rich, very rich. I used chocolate graham crackers and the crust is wonderful. I am going to try serving it with a raspberry sauce next time, this time with whipping cream.

This is an outstanding desert! I've made it many times - always to great reviews! For anyone having trouble with the buttercream layer you must be sure that the syrup reaches the desired temp.(can even be over by a few degrees. Also - use a standing mixer and add the syrup (to well whipped eggs) as slowly as possible. Finally, add your butter a little bit at a time.

This was a complete disaster. I followed the directions carefully ( I think!), even using a candy thermometer, but the buttercream layer was so runny that I could not take it out of the pan.

I've made this delicious treat three times already and I get rave reviews. Some people don't even believe that I made it, and insist that it must have come from a gourmet pastry shop. The first time I used Kahlua, but then changed to Bailey's Irish Cream. That taste is more preferred in our household and it works just as well, if not better. ENJOY!!!

i followed the directions to a t, but my top layer also was not firm enough...had a pudding-like consistency (which i learned after trying to cut a slice...it appeared firm when i shook it a bit). i couldn't take the springform sides off lest it spill all over the place! after i removed that first piece, and a good portion of the buttercream ran loose, some remained -- a thinner, firmer layer -- so i think i can now serve actual slices on a plate. any ideas on what went wrong? also, no one is exaggerating when he/she says it is rich...extremely rich, almost too rich for my taste!

I know I goofed and but the 3sticks of butter in the choc mixture...but, I thought I had better continue on correctly and use the requested 3 for the buttercream as well. For some reason my top layer was not firming up. We ended up serving it in bowls because the top was soupy...could be because I didn't have a candy thermometor.(?) Still tasted out of this world!

I made this for a friend's birthday party and the guests (who were all chocolate lovers) absolutely loved it, and even 2 month later still talk about it. I felt it could use improvement in two areas; I might make the crust a little thicker because the crust was delicious and it was the only thing that offered some balance and contrast to the otherwise very ceamy layers of chocolate and Kahlua-buttercream. The other thing is that I really prefer bittersweet chocolate to semisweety, and I can't help but wonder how the cake would taste by substituting the former for the latter. This cake is not very difficult to make, which is convenient.
