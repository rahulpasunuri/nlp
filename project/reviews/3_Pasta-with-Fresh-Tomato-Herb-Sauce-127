Fantastic! A hit at the dinner table. I used cherry tomatoes from the garden, which was a particular treat. Highly recommend using them. Kept to the recipe, but increased the proportions because I had about 18 oz of pasta.

This was really good. Nice blend of seasonings. Before chopping the tomatoes, for a gourmet touch, peel and seed them as well.

I have a glut of fresh tomatoes and this just fit the bill. I sauted the onions and garlic briefly in olive oil and then mixed everything together. It was very easy and very tasty. Even tasted good reheated as leftovers. Yum, Yum.

What a great recipe! I added extra feta & basil, as well as a bit of rice wine vinegar and cayenne. I can't wait to make it again!

This recipe was easy to make and delicious. I used whole wheat penne instead of shells and added black olives and parmesan. It was especially good using freshly picked tomatoes, basil and garlic from the garden. Excellent for a hot summer meal.

This recipe has a nice bouquet of flavors. I upped the amount of feta, and am very pleased. My first epicurious recipe!

I was surprised by all the good reviews! I agree with Tammy -- this recipe is missing something. I added more garlic, some fresh mint, some chopped calamata olives, and a big splash of balsamic vinegar. I let that sit for an hour and poured it over freshly cooked pasta -- yummy.

I really liked this recipe, light and easy! These are ingredients I always have on hand so I will make it again. Enhancements: I am a real feta fan and found 2 oz too little so I doubled it to 4 oz. I also used whole wheat pasta (better for you)and the flavors were definately strong enough to hold up to it (with the extra feta and fresh herbs). Next time I might go lighter on the onion and garlic (WOW - spicy!).

This dish was ok but i wouldnt say great.I probably won't make it again.I think it needed something else added to it.

Great recipe! I will definitely make it again, but I think I will use spiral pasta rather than the shells and cut the amount to 8 oz. instead of 12 oz. Rather than mix the feta cheese with the other ingredients, I sprinkled it on top. This is a great recipe for summer when fresh tomatoes are plentiful.

I made this recipe on a warm summer night and it was perfect. Light snd delicious! I did not use fresh oregano and increased the fresh oregano. I used penne pasta and grated fresh parmesan on top. Loved it!!

Not bad, very simple to make. The sauce reminds me of freshly made salsa. I would make it again if I had all the ingredients on hand and needed something fast. I also used dried herbs and it came out just fine.
