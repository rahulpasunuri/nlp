I made this using Cocoa Camino's bittersweet baking chocolate (71%) and it was really, really good. I can imagine an even better chocolate would be out of this world--they're like flourless chocolate cake, but fluffy and crusty. The one problem was turning them out of the ramekins. Getting them out just seemed to squish and deflate them, so I served them right in the pots. I didn't make the sauce, so no comment there. There's an early grey creme anglaise recipe around here that would be great, I bet.

This was the first time I have made souffles and they turned out fantastic - very light inside and slightly crusty on the outside. They were a lot of fun to make. I had to cook them for 15 minutes but that might just be my oven. There are richer recipes out there that include butter but I wanted something lower in fat. I would definitely make these again.
