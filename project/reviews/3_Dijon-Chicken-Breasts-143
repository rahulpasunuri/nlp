This is a really, really good recipe. I do let the onions soften for a bit in some wine before adding the other ingredients, and I add a little more wine than the recipe calls for, as well as fresh minced thyme, because there's some in my garden. I also turn the breasts halfway to ensure even cooking. I served the chicken sliced, on a bed of garlic mashed cauliflower with fresh minced rosemary. An amazingly delicious low-calorie, practically no- carb meal.

I enjoyed this. Poaching in stock is a great healthy way to cook chicken and using the dijon instead of cream to thicken the sauce is tasty and lowcal. The only changes I made were to saute the onion and garlic for a few minutes to soften before adding the broth and dijon; and to stir through some wholegrain mustard right at the end, just before serving. Yum.

The sauce is similar to a Bon Appetite recipe of grilled pork tenderloin in mustard cream sauce (vintage 1990). Only this sauce is low in fat. It was excellent. I recommend green beans as an accompaniment and mushroom risotto. I sauteed the chicken coated with a panko/parmesean breading in two tablespoons of olive oil. Place that on the warmer and deglaze the pan with a small onion (red), shallot--not too large, and the garlic in recipe. I squirted in some fine mustard, about 1/4 cup of white wine and chicken broth--low sodium. Let that saute a bit, then slip the chicken back on top, cover and simmer 10 minutes--coating will not be crisp, but it tastes good. Put the whole thing on the warmer, get everything else together and serve.

The amount of mustard makes it way too salty for my taste, and the flavor of the sauce is not terribly interesting.

Rating: 3
Good recipe but you have to like mustard. I normally don't mind mustard however, it can be overpowering in this dish. I used half the mustard asked for and it was just right. My recommendation is to start with half mustard and taste the sauce as it cooks down and adjust the amount of mustard to your taste.

Rating: 4
Easy and tasty, what more could you want? I followed the recipe, though I did soften the onions and garlic in a bit of oil and did add some white wine. Chicken was nice and moist. There's not too many ingredients, so make sure you use a good mustard. Other than that, it's hard to see where one could go wrong.

Rating: 3
I thought this was pretty good... I took other cooks advice and used a dash of white wine and shallots instead of onion and fresh thyme instead of dry. I also marinated the chicken in the mixture for about 4 hours prior to cooking it and then instead of cooking it on the range I baked the whole thing (covered with foil) for 35 min at 350 - much easier and the chicken was moist and flavorful

Rating: 1
Very disappointing recipe. I followed it to a "t" and ended up with dry chicken that was bland and almost entirely flavorless. How this recipe got into Bon Appetit is beyond me. I would have been better off just winging it. Going to try to use the leftovers for chicken salad - am hoping I can at least salvage something, so it's not a complete waste of chicken. Definitely WOULD NOT ever make this again.

This has been a valuable addition to my repertoire. I'm single, and cook for myself a lot, often in the later evening. This is very good and is super simple and quick. The best part, you need only 1 pan. Just add the ingredients to that pan and later throw in the chicken. I do use fresh thyme instead of dried. I've also made it with chicken legs instead of breasts. With the breasts I find that slicing them into smaller pieces insures that the meat is moist. White wine would also be a nice variation.

Rating: 2
Decent, but not great...make sure to minimize the amount of salt you use or make sure that the chicken broth you use is entirely unsalted, instead of reduced salt. When I made the pan sauce, it came out obscenely salty and I ended up having to throw it out. The chicken came out pretty well though, although I would have maybe taken it out a minute or two sooner.

This is a really easy, tasty dish. I like to use a coarse grain mustard, add a splash of white wine and sprigs of fresh thyme. It goes great with the Orzo risotto on the site.

I make this recipe all the time, but I have changed it A LOT. Highly recommend dusting chicken with wondra flour and pan-searing first. I use shallots (instead of onions), herbes de provence (instead of just thyme) and dry vermouth or white wine (whichever I have handy) with low-salt chicken broth. Oh, and I add 1 tablespoon of honey with mustard.

Rating: 3
This recipe is easy and great for a novice cook or anyone who is short on prep-time. After making this a few times, I found it turned out better to double the ingredients (to make more sauce), and also to add a splash of dry white wine. I use the recommended amount of dijon mustard, and then match it with whole grain. It's not haute cuisine, but pretty tasty!

really good an easy. I too sauteed the onions in a little butter. Didnt have fresh garlic, so I used powdered garlic..but the chicken was really moist and tender which is a priority for me!

Okay, I hate it when people rate recipes that they've completely changed. But my changes were completely accidental and the essential recipe was the same. I don't like onions so I left them out (so that wasn't accidental) and I took something out of the freezer that I thought was chicken but it turned out to be pork (it was very frost covered). Anyway, the sauce was easy, quick, used very few ingredients, and, most importantly, delicious. I have added this to my weekly quick dinner menu. Eat with the quinoa (you can use cous cous), black bean and tomato salad. It's a complete meal and so good!

Since I'm not a big fan of chicken breast, I was dubious about this recipe. The chicken came out very moist and delicious. Since I didn't have thyme, I used some very good oregano and it tasted great

I just made this for the first time tonight and it was pretty good! Definitely mustardy but my mustard had a bit of white wine already in it. I also used a full cup of chix broth instead of a 1/2. (Which was not unsalted btw but did not make the dish taste too salty.) Instead of onion, I used a whole shallot, and I sauteed that along with 6 cloves of chopped garlic before I put in the mustard. I also used a full portobello mushroom cap, 1/2 minced and 1/2 in chunkier pieces. Not sure what I would change or add in the future to enhance it... But I think the quality of your mustard choice is pretty key so make sure it has an appealing and complex flavor.

This recipe was easy to make and I had all the ingredients on hand. However, make sure your chicken breasts are all thin and relatively all of the same size, because my larger ones took more than 20 minutes to cook. I could also definitely have used more pan sauce at the end though. Otherwise, good flavor.

Love this recipe, and so has anyone I've served it to. Not much to it...if you have a little white wine handy, simmer the onion in it until nearly evaporated before adding the other ingredients; use Meille brand mustard (half grainy if you have it); turn chicken breasts half-way through, make sure you boil the sauce down until it coats the back of a spoon. Serve with egg noodles or healthy mashed potatoes.

This was a huge disappointment. I try hundreds of recipes every year, and my husband said it's one of the worst recipes I've tried in our 20 year marriage. We like all of the ingredients, but the dish was awful.

Very simple and quick dish, perfect when you don't have many ingredients in the house. I didn't have unsalted chicken broth, so used regular, and it turned out a bit salty. Also, when poaching, my broth evaporated so I added in a bit more broth while it cooked. Overall, highly recommend. Delicious and simple!

I thought that this dish was very good. It has simple but delicious ingriedients when integrated with each other and the chicken is beyond tender when it's done. If you would like a side dish with this then you can have chipotle yams. Mash your yams after cooking them whichever way you want. Then add a tbs. of butter and a pinch of salt. Then mince one chipotle pepper and add. If you want milder yams add 1 teaspoon adobo sauce (it's in the can of chipotle peppers), 2 tbs. if you're somewhere in the middle, and if you're like me then you'll want 3 tbs. But be sparing with the sauce as it really is HOT! You may want to just start with 1-2 teaspoon as a safety precaution for the good of your health. By the way, I got this recipefrom Good Eats (w/ Alton Brown, of course). Good show!

Thanks to the guidance provided by previous reviews, this turned out great. I flattened the chicken breasts a bit, dredged them in seasonsed flour, then fried them on high in a little olive oil/butter for about 1 minute per side, then removed the chicken and wiped out the pan. Then I followed the recipe as written. When the chicken was done (and it was so tender) I cut it up and served it on a bed of red leaf lettuce with croutons and shredded parmesan cheese... It was so good!

This was a nice flavored recipie. I did make a few changed, first added mushrooms following another review and I cooked them in medium heat in oil till onion was clear. Then I put on high and added white wine, when white wine was reduced I added the broth. And I chopped up the chicken and served over rice.

as a meal, this was very good as is, and considering the fact that it is so low in fat, ya can't beat it. however, i make this more as my base for chicken salad instead of a main meal. the chicken is so very tender, moist and full of flavor. i'm a smooth not crunchy chicken salad girl myself so shredded (or diced, your preference) with light mayo, touch salt and white pepper on hearty whole wheat or grain bread, it is the best chicken salad i have ever made. low fat and high fiber! picky five year old little boy loves it too!

I didn't have unsalted chicken stock so I used half salted stock and half sherry. I also used dried thyme because it's what I had. I butterflied the chicken breasts so they would cook more quickly. Cooking them in the sauce gives them the moist tenderness of poached chicken. I loved this recipe. I gave it 3 forks because when I can serve it to my fella and he doesn't reallize it's low fat, low calorie, low salt it's a keeper! I can't wait to try it with mushrooms or capers as some others have suggested.

Very good. I coated the chicken in seasoned flour and gave it a quick browning in butter and olive oil. removed from the pan and added more oil,shallots and garlic for about 2 mins. Added 1 cup of broth and 1/4 cup of white wine added dijon and 1 tbs of honey. Added back the chicken for 20 mins. (3 thick breasts). Wow!!

This is a wonderful way to make chicken, avoiding that "chicken again?" mentality. The dice on the onion is one that will give the sauce texture...if you want a smooth sauce then I would grate the onion. I've also made this with shallots and it is just as good. I use Country Dijon mustard and add a little more the recipe calls for.

This is so easy that it has become a regular dinner for us. We only make it with 1/2 the chicken but keep everything else the same which makes the perfect amount of sauce. We also add mushrooms and on occasion shallots.

Wow. So easy and tastes great. My boyfriend gave it the thumbs up. Since I used ground thyme I only used about half a teaspoon.

I cooked half of the amount of chicken but kept the amount of sauce the same and thought it was just the right amount.

I read everyone's suggestions and then used 8 ounces of chicken broth instead of 1/2 cup. I used half Grey Poupon Country Dijon Mustard and half Maille Dijon. Instead of boneless chicken breasts I used chicken "tenders" which improved the ease of preparation. We loved the result! Served with "Skllet-browned potatoes w/ fresh dill"

Exceptionally easy recipe! Excellent with rice or couscous. Have made several times. The first, I followed the recipe exactly, and we thought we had somthing with potential. It is bland, but a good base. Definitely needs more broth than called for. On repeat adventures we began adding mushrooms and capers. DELIGHTFUL!! A good, strong flavor.

I made this dish tonight. I followed the recipe exactly as it is. I added a little more chicken broth than they called for. I think Poaching the chicken is the "perfect" way to cook the chicken for this particular recipe. I don't usually like mustard but this was great! I used French's Bold n' Spicy brown. I think it makes a difference. I wouldn't make this with any other mustard. If I tried this again, I might use the traditional dijon mustard. We think we would like it just as much. I served it with Rice and Corn. Love it.

Very good recipe considering the simplicity. I added some extra broth and about a 1/4 cup of wine and found that it was perfect for 4 chicken breasts. I took another reviewer's advice and cut the chicken into slightly smaller parts (3 pieces for each breast) for quicker poaching. A real plus to this recipe -- I took the leftovers (sauce and all) and tossed it with some baby greens the next night for a lovely chicken salad entree. No other dressing needed. It was light and tasty and it's always a treat to get two meals out of one recipe.

Well, actually, a 2.5 would be my rating. I took suggestions to make more sauce, using more broth and the same amount of mustard. And, since this dish called out for it, I used tarragon instead of thyme. Also, cut the chicken breasts in half; cooks faster and presents better. Our family is on the South Beach Diet and this worked well, over a bed of slightly steamed shredded savoy cabbage. Very nice, very healthful.

Boring! Even though it was easy enough for my boyfriend to make, it still wasn't worth the effort. Something was definitely missing (maybe it was the garlic I forgot?), who knows. I added some white wine and a little 1/2 and 1/2, which I believe made it slightly better, but I would only make it again if I had nothing but those ingredients in my house. And then I would still improvise.

while my mother loved this dish after a long day, I myself thought it only OK-even considering the minimal effort. I cooked 4 breasts totalling 1.25lb., added extra broth (about 1/4 c.) and some white wine and after 20 min. there was no sauce when I forgot to check under the lid after another 5 minutes- so I had to just mound some flavored onions on the chicken. Sauce would have been nice. The chicken was tender and has potential for a decently flavorful meal, but I would double the chicken broth-just add a touch more mustard and thyme and you'll have a good sauce and plenty of it.

This was very easy and very good. Luckily, I had read the other reviews before making it and knew to make the same amount of sauce with only 3 chicken breasts.

I halved the chicken and kept the full amount of sauce. I should have known it wouldn't take 20 minutes to cook the chicken. It was fine, but the sauce all but dried up. The taste was good, though . I will make again, and watch it more carefully, served with brocolli raab.

It is very helpful to read reviews before making a dish for the first time. I dredged the chicken in flour seasoned with salt& pepper, and browned it in a mixture of unsalted butter & olive oil. (Just need a little of both in a nonstick skillet.) After cooking the chicken, removed from the pan, and sauteed the onion and garlic, added the other ingredients. Definitely use MORE broth to make more sauce. My family loved both the aroma and the taste. The 2nd time I made the dish, I followed the recipe more closely (used more stock and some white wine, and it was very tasty.

Just a little too mustardy for me. I like mustard, but after the first 2-3 bites of this, I had had enough. Its such a strong flavor (I normally LOVE strong flavors) and it just gets old less than halfway in. But obviously most people love this, so I'm in the minority. I did add wine, which I think helped.

This can go from good but not special to a little more interesting if you add a good white wine and use tarragon as the herb instead of thyme. The wine would also help with the danger of over-saltiness if the broth isn't salt-free. The chicken doesn't need to be browned -- poaching works just fine, but check for doneness well before 20 minutes. It has a very rich taste with the wine, even though there's not fat.

I made this last night for friends and it was wonderful! I lighted floured the chicken breasts and browned them in butter first, set them aside and reduced the sauce, then added the chicken back to re-heat. Everyone loved it!

Rating: 3
Very easy to make. I also added mushrooms and a bit extra broth, per prior suggestion, but I didn't feel the need to brown the chicken or onion. I only made 4 chicken breasts and there was no way that would be enough sauce. Perhaps they mean half a can of broth rather than half a cup? Be careful reducing, though, or you'll end up with less sauce than you'd like, no matter what. My chicken did not turn out dry (and it did take close to 20 min poaching) and I didn't find the sauce salty at all, though I used chicken broth with only 60 mg salt which is lower than your average low salt broth. Do not use full salt broth. I could not find no-salt broth at any grocery store so unless you can make your own, use the lowest salt broth you can buy. I got lucky and found mine at an organic store so I think others would in fact be too salty. I paired it with the Lemon-Pistachio Pilaf and Honey Glazed Wax Beans (also from Epicurious) and it was great. Boyfriend and I ate it up with a nice Viogner and are looking forward to leftovers tomorrow.

This recipe looked so easy I thought it would be a sure hit. Since I didn't have chicken breasts, I used turkey breasts instead. They turned out fine, but the sauce was soooo salty. I used low sodium chicken broth and premium dijon mustard. I don't know what happened, but it was terrible.

I have made this extremely easy recipe several time and it is always very well-received. I usually add some canned tomatoes, which cut the strong mustard taste and stretch the sauce.

So quick and easy, I made it for a workday lunch. It manages to be both tangy and elegant. The recipe calls for unsalted stock, and that's correct. I substituted my lightly salted homemade stock, and the dish turned out a tad too salty. The mustard provides all the salt you need.

I love this dish. Very easy to make and and delicious. My variations to this recipe include using a German sweet dijon mustard with the seeds, I use the remaining sauce to coat penne pasta, nad I add feta or bleu cheese to the pasta after it's coated. Then I serve the chicken over the pasta. The next time I make this, I am going to try marinating the chicken a bit prior to poaching.

Everyone loved this dish. It's hard to believe it's low fat. I used other's suggestions of browning the chicken breasts in a wee bit of olive oil with garlic and onion, and added white wine to the broth. I also loved the idea of adding cayene pepper to the sauce. It really added a nice little zing to the dish. Unlike other reviewers I've poached meat on many occassions. The meat turns out so moist and tender this way. Although I don't much care for mustard of any type, I thought this sauce was great and have doubled it each time I make it.

Wow ...after reading everyone else's comments, I started thinking that beside each ingredient in the recipe, it should say "to taste" rather than giving a specific amount. I did make my own version of this and everyone in my family liked it. It isn't a family favourite, but I will definitely make it again. I didn't have any thyme on hand, so I put rosemary in. I was tempted to try tarragon (because I absolutely love chicken and tarragon together) but I was afraid of the dijon/tarragon combination. I was also tempted to add a bit of white wine while it was cooking, but my hubby doesn't care for wine in cooking, so I refrained. Overall, I would say it was a simple, versitile dish that's worth making again.

I will definitely be repeating this recipe. My husband loved it, but, more importantly, so did I. I am not a huge fan in general of sauteed chicken dishes because they are usually bland unless smothered in cream and cheese. I browned the chicken, removed it from the pan, then browned the onions and the garlic for 5 mins. I used a whole onion and sliced it thinly. When I added the liquid ingred. I also added dry vermouth as suggested previously and sliced olives with a little of the olive juice/oil they were in. Start to finish couldnt have been more than 30 mins. Easy and delicious.

WOW! This was really good, and easy to make!!! My whole family liked it. I used herb garlic chicken breasts, which may account for why it was so salty. I put in 3/4 cup chicken broth first, but since I didn't serve it right away needed to add more liquid, so next time I will put in a whole cup. This was a success, will make again!! *:)*

I didn't have dried thyme in the house, so I used rosemary instead. I took the advice of earlier reviewers by lightly browning the chicken first. I used shallot rather than onion, and added dry vermouth to the poaching liquid. I also used the country dijon, which gave the whole dish a bit more color, and more "pop" when eaten. Excellent, and easy. It doesn't get better than that.

Didn't like it at all. There are so many great recipies out here that I am sure I can find a much better substitute.

Simple and good. I would reduce the amount of dijon mustard, and use shallots as well.

Very good! I am making it tonight for the second time. Really tasty and simple way to use those boneless chicken breasts!

As everyone says, this recipe is both quick and delicious. For extra flavor I brown the chicken first and then sautee the onions and garlic in a very small amount of olive oil.

For a low-fat recipe, this was surprisingly good. I also added honey and doubled the sauce ingredients with the exception of the mustard, and it was perfect.

This is a handy recipe for a quick meal. I doubled the sauce, per the recommendation of other reviewers, and there was actually too much. Also, doubling the mustard made it too mustardy. Family did enjoy it though and it tasted better the next day (though mustard taste got even stronger).

Hassle free preparation and very tasty. Great weeknight dinner. I took another reviewers advice and doubled the sauce. Well worth it.

Very easy. Thyme is a good choice of spice for this. My husband loved it so it will become a regular in our meal plans. I made more of the sauce for a pasta (pasta, green beans, carrots, chicken) to use up some of the leftovers, and it was interesting but a little loud.

Really liked this one! On the advice of other reviewers, I browned the chicken first and added just a bit of honey to the sauce; next time I'll also try the suggestion of doubling the ingredients for the sauce, since it's delicious AND low-fat too! (I used the old standby Grey Poupon, and it had a very nice flavor.)

Rating: 3
My boyfriend and I thought this was a great recipe! I doubled the sauce, including the mustard, and I thought it worked well. However, I did not double the garlic and used French's Dijon mustard, which I suspect is milder than more expensive brands. I also slightly browned the chicken before poaching. A wonderful healthy, light dish. I can't wait to make it again!

Living in france, it was nice to try a recipe that had some flavour, but NO butter, cream or fat. Quick, cheap, good and easy.

I think it was all of the controversy presented in the varied reviews of this dish that prompted me to try it. I had never poached chicken before - in fact, I don't think I'd knowingly even eaten poached chicken (the thought of meat cooked in liquid was just a little too strange) but I gave it a try and was VERY impressed with the results. I must admit, I cheated - I quickly browned the chicken and sauteed the onions and garlic before adding the liquids. The texture of the chicken was perfect and the sauce came out great. I actually doubled everthing (except the mustard) and added a healthy splash of white wine, despite the fact that I was only using 4 breasts, and ended up with just enough sauce (I would've liked even more - it was really that good). Easy, healthy, cheap weeknight chicken recipe (and it got me over my fear of poaching). I'll make it again, this time with enough for substantial leftovers as the little I had were great the next day.

Be sure not to overcook - chicken gets rubbery.

A great new weekday classic for my family! Fast and very flavorful, and so satisfying I can't believe it has practically no fat. I added a can of artichoke hearts to the simmering sauce and stirred in a teaspoon or two of a flour/water mixture right at the end to thicken the sauce. It worked beautifully and was so easy. I expect I'll be trying new twists on this recipe for a long time!

Rating: 3
Delicious and so easy. I used shallots instead of onion because I had it on hand. I agree that the sauce should be doubled. I'm looking forward to experimenting with other reviewers' suggestions, such as adding honey, marmalade, white wine, or cayenne pepper. Next time I definitely will try adding some flour to give the sauce some body.

this dish is really great. i'm not really an experienced cook so i picked this recipe for it's ease. i made it pretty much according to the recipe, using some honey-dijon as the mustard and a little more chicken broth than recommended (about 2/3 cup). it came out incredibly flavourful and was not nearly as garlicky as i thought it would be. i will definitely make this again.

Rating: 3
I added stewed tomatoes to my sauce as well as white cooking wine. I think this helped to cut the bite of the Dijon mustard. I enjoy a good Dijon, but goodness, this sauce contains quite a bit. I found that by adding just a splash more chicken broth and the white cooking wine my sauce was ample enough for four *very* large chicken breasts. I served this dish with the au gratin and feta potaotes and green beans with toasted almonds in a butter, garlic and brown sugar coating. Quick dish to make and oh! so tasty.

We like this dish. I use Country Dijon because we like the flavor better. Not many low fat dishes taste as good.

Rating: 3
very good, very fast. i doubled the garlic and the wine b/c the other reviews said it was a bit bland. i also added about a tablespoon more mustard, but it then was too mustardy for my taste (my boyfriend liked though). i only used 4 chicken breasts, and the sauce was perfect-6 would be too many. low-cal, and cheap too!

Its interesting how so many people can have different opinions about the same recipe. We thought this meal was dreadful. Perhaps i am not accustomed to poached chicken but it came out gray and desacated. And the sauce was only a little bit better than that. Definitely a one time only recipe at my house. Maybe i missed something.

This dish was delicious, easy, and best of all, healthy! The mustard gave the chicken a great flavor. I didn't find the need to reduce the sauce at the end because it was already thick enough. I recommended this dish to several friends.

This recipe was a big hit and extremely easy to prepare. I added honey, but that was a matter of choice. A friend who ried it without the honey preferred it that way, but she really likes the flavor of dijon mustard.

Folks, remember, this is a low-fat, low-cal dish! If you want decadent gourmet, this is not the dish for you. But if you're looking for low-fat, this is excellent! The mustard/onion/thyme combination is fantastic. I made it exactly per recipe except I used Sierra Nevada Pale Ale Honey Spice mustard instead of Dijon. Be sure to use good quality thyme. I used a cheaper brand and it gave it a little bit of a bitter taste. I wouldn't recommend adding more stock unless you also up the mustard and spices. No wonder some people thought it was bland. Duh! But I found there to be plenty of sauce of the amount of chicken stated in the recipe. If you double the amount of chicken, double the amount of sauce! Double-Duh!! I also froze this and it thawed and reheated wonderfully.

I found the recipe extremely easy to prepare, and gave time to get the rest of the meal ready. The chicken was tender, and the sauce was delicious. I made some extra sauce to serve on a very light pasta dish, which was great too. I would definitely make this again.

I have not made this, but it reminds me of a dish I make regularly with a few changes that would improve (especially after reading all the comments): add some vermouth or wine for more liquid, garlic is to taste; that is a LOT of mustard, cut back a little..and add some orange marmelade, apricot jelly etc...just a little of something sweet to balance out the other flavors. Chicken is delicious and easy this way.

It turned out okay. Everyone else liked it alot - but I found it a bit bland. I think it was because I doubled up on the broth but not on the other spices. Next time I'll do that and see if more of the flavor comes out.

I followed many of others comments by using much more liquid, about 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth, plus I added a dash (or 2!) of dry vermouth for added flavor. I cooked 4 breasts plus the tenders on very low heat, so as not to toughen them and then at the end, I added a bit of slurry to tighten up the sauce. Very delicious!! Served with white rice and creamed spinach.

All I have to say is YUM, YUM, YUM!!!! The marriage of the mustard and thyme was a match made in heaven...Like most reviewers, I browned the chicken breast --- very lightly--- first. I also added more broth, about 1 1/2 cups. I also substitued regular golden mustard for dijon and it was delish!! I'll definitely make this dish again.

Rating: 3
An incredibly easy and succulent dish that was well received by children and adults alike! Unlike others who prefer to brown the chicken first, I find this recipe lends itself suitable to poaching and is similiar in feel to poached tarragon chicken in its elegant appearance. I also heeded the advice of another reviewer and added 1 1/2 cups chicken broth when I was cooking 8 breasts and still found the liquid too much. 1 cup broth to 8 breast proportion would be fine which would make 2/3 cup to 8 breasts about fine. Also 1/2 large white onion to 6 breasts would be fine as I used about 2/3 to 8 breasts and found the chicken very flavorful. I also added 1 TBS of flour (less if you use less broth) which gives a wonderful creamy texture to the sauce and falls elegantly over the chicken breasts One other tip from professional cooking: in poaching chicken I cut a circle from parchment paper size of pan, spray it with Pam and lay it directly on top of chicken and simmer it that way without pot cover and you get a very moist well flavored chicken done in exactly 20 minutes on low heat (#3 on electric stovetop) Goes great with broccoli!

Following an earlier review I too browned the chicken in oil. The other change I made to the recipe was to substitute coconut milk for the chicken stock. The result was delicious. After cooking the chicken I found the sauce was already thick enough for serving. One other suggestion, double the recipe for the sauce.

I liked the idea, but I found the recipe a little bland. I took the suggestion of a fellow reviewer and gave the chicken some color by "browning" it in a little olive oil. I added marjoram, nonpareilles capers,basil,sage, and additional water to the sauce,and simmered till thickened.

Rating: 4
I thouht this was a wonderful , quick, low-fat dinner. I too served it over some rice. My suggestion to those who think it might be too sharp/strong would be to use substitute shallots for the onions, which I did. This gives it a distinct yet mellower falvor.

Rating: 3
After sprinkling a bit of lemon-pepper marinade on the chicken breasts, I lightly browned the chicken in very little olive oil for a nice color. After browning, I removed the chicken and lightly tossed the garlic and onion in the remaining oil, then added the rest of the ingredients as suggested. I used slightly more broth and slightly less mustard (Gray Poupon) and served it over Uncle Ben's wild rice with steamed broccoli on the side. Very nice, my husband said it reminded him of a meal his grandmother would have made. Our little two-year-old gobbled it down, too.

Rating: 3
Easy and pleasing to the palate. I suspect that those who've found this dish too strong were using authentic Dijon mustard, which can border on the industrial-strength. I used Americanized Dijon--French's, I think--and it was fine. Here's a hint: This a BA recipe, not one from Gourmet, so specialty shop purchases are not required.

I agree that the sauce CAN be strong, but if Dijon mustard is not your thing, lower the amount some what. I have served this a number of times this far with a nice rice pilaf and some salad and it has been a hit.
