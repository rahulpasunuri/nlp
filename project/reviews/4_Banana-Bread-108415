I have made this version of banana bread many times, with or without the walnuts and it is oustanding. I have given it as presents on the holidays and now I am committed to do this forever! Occasionally I have substiuted the walnuts with pecans which are creamy and buttery. However, no need to modify anything here. Make sure to use the creme fraiche, I substituted cream once and the difference is noticable. Also make sure the bananas are really really ripe. Virtually black all over is a good gauge. Really delicious.

Really moist and delicious...not too dense, with just the right amount of air...Substituted sour cream for creme fraiche, brown suger for granulated(2-1/2 cups)...really moist and delicious...baked for one hour and perfect! Brown sugar made the bread darker, more caramel...yum!

I make this recipe over and over, it's a fave. I find that this resipe easily makes 3 loaves. I also find that I can bake an hour and that's plenty. The first time I made this I checked the bread at 1 hr 15 mins and it was overcooked. I sometimes forget to leave the eggs out in advance of the mis en place and just submerge the eggs in warm water before cracking. I love the science and the process of this recipe.

The banana bread was awesome, I liked it much better than what I used to buy. It was moist and good. Followed the recipe to letter, but reduced the sugar to 2 cups after reading earlier reviews, will decrease it next time to 1.5. Definitely will do it again. Great recipe.

Actually had all the ingredients for this in the house (never, ever happens) once I read from others that greek yogurt worked in lieu of creme fraiche. At 50 minutes it started to over brown and there were no crumbs on the tester (at an hour I would've had a brick). Final verdict - good flavor but on the dry side from cooking too long. I'll check it at 45' next time to be safe.

Love this recipe. It is my go-to recipe for banana bread. If I can't find creme fraiche, I just use plain yogurt or sour cream. I do cut back the sugar a little and leave out the walnuts b/c I don't like nuts in breads and cookies. Sometimes I'll chocolate chips. Always a hit. Makes a great gift in those little gift paper loaf pans.

Yum! This is a great recipe. I cut back on the sugar by 1/3 cup and mistakenly only used 3 bananas instead of 3 cups but it came out just fine. I look forward to making this again but will follow the recipe and use 6 bananas. I suspect that it will be more moist and perhaps sweeter.

Do not change anything. I t is not too sweet it is not too anything, it is perfection. Leave a beautiful thing alone and let it speak for itself.

This is a wonderful banana bread recipe - moist, flavourful and easy. I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour with 1 1/4 cups white flour, I doubled the cinnamon and reduced the sugar to about 1 3/4 cups. I substituted unsweetened applesauce for half of the oil and substituted sour cream for the creme fraiche. I use silicone loaf pans and my bread was done in 55 minutes.

Substituted coconut oil for veg. oil, nonfat greek yogurt for creme fraiche, and slightly reduced the amount of nuts and sugar in this recipe. Even with these substitutions, this recipe is the best banana bread I've ever had. I think the coconut oil was definitely a factor.

This recipe is overkill for banana bread. With as much work that went into creating it, I was expecting the most amazing banana bread I ever had. The end result was no better than the banana bread you can make in a fraction of the time.

This was a forgiving recipe for my lower fat / lower sugar / unavailable ingredient substitutions. The result was moist, not dense as other lower fat/sugar recipes tend to turn out, and full of banana flavour. The only change would be to try honey or something else as a sweetener as the splenda aftertaste seemed to come through too strongly. Changes made: -whole wheat flour for all purpose -2 tsp cinnamon -3 eggs instead of 4 -1.5 cups of splenda instead of sugar -1 cup unsweetened applesauce instead of veg oil -1/4 cup lower fat sour cream instead of creme fraiche

Made this for the first time just over a moth ago and I've made them 3x already. I do cut the sugar to 2c. I made muffins today-I got 16 out of a half recipe. They were done in just abt 25 min in convection. Do be careful not to overbake, they brown very quickly.

This was a tasty banana bread - good rise, just the right amount of sweetness although I reduced the sugar to 2+ cups and substituted 1C blueberries for 1C banana. I substituted 1/4 c wheat germ for same amount of flour. Next time I'll have some WW flour on hand and will use some of that as well. Now to figure out how to make it at high altitude!

I have been making banana bread for years with a different recipe but decided to try this one. I will never go back to my old recipe! This bread was perfect! To make it a little healthier, I reduced the sugar to 2 cups, doubled the cinnamon, substituted greek yogurt for creme fraiche, and 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 cup of vegetable oil.

Just made muffins and a loaf from this recipe and they are cooling on the counter as I type. As usual I read back in the reviews for tips and substitutions. I used 1 3/4 cups of sugar and will use 2 next time. The muffins are sweet but could be a touch sweeter. I also subbed plain greek yogurt for creme fresh and they came out nice and moist. I haven't tried the bread yet - added walnuts and chocolate chips to that so I expect the sweetness to be perfect. Next time I'll also try to sub in some whole wheat flour in place of some of the white and use apple sauce to cut down on some of the oil.

Wish I had made the full recipe! I took it to a pot luck and it disappeared almost before I had a chance to sample it. For half a recipe I used 1 cup of sugar and found it to be sweet enough (my bananas were extremely ripe ones from my frozen stash), also substituted sour cream because it was what I had on hand and a combo of nuts.

I made this recipe as is, except that I baked it in muffin pans and sprinkled toppings: mini peanut butter chips on some, shredded coconut on others, and chopped BACON on others!

Used greek yogurt rather than creme fraiche also used 3/4 c canola oil and 1/4 c coconut oil (gently melted in microwave). Lastly I used 1 1/3 c sugar rather than 2 1/3 C and omitted the walnut for my toddler. Basically, it's delicious.

Rating: 3
This would've earned 4 forks if it hadn't been for the insane amount of sugar in the recipe. I used about 1/3 of what's called for and it tasted great. Bananas are very sweet, so you really don't need much sugar at all.

Rating: 4
Awesome. I added a bit more cinnamon & some cardamom for the spices and used 8 med bananas. I also used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and only 1 1/2 cups white. I don't like nuts in my bread so added a bit of walnut oil for the taste. Baked in the AGA for 2 hours and came out moist and delicious. Glad I made the 2 loaves instead of halving the recipe as will make a nice gift for someone!

Rating: 4
It is true, very forgiving recipe: first of all, I halved the recipe - big mistake, because it is fantastic!, Next, I was very distracted while preparing it and after sifting I first mixed the oil and the sugar, without an electric blender, then realized I should be mixing the eggs with sugar then adding oil. Hardly seemed to matter, mashed in a lot of bananas, didn't have yogurt on hand so skipped it, and no vanilla either so used 2 tablespoons of maple syrup instead of half a cup of sugar. The result of all this sloppy recipe following was fantastic nontheless! That is my kinda recipe, thanks again Epicurious!

Rating: 4
when i saw a banana bread recipe calling for creme fraiche i was pretty sure it would be good. the texture and moistness is perfect. i cut the sugar back to 2 cups and it was still plenty sweet, i wouldn't put any more, might even subtract more. the recipe seemed strangely short on spices, i doubled the cinnamon and added some nutmeg and i would still fool around with it, could have used more. but a great base for your experimentation.

I aggregated everyone's edits and made the following: added more bananas - I wish I'd doubled the recipe, substituted agave syrup for sugar and only put in about 2/3rds, used a mix of half wheat and half white flour, and used greek yogurt instead of creme fraiche. I also added in about half a teaspoon more cinnamon and roughly the same for nutmeg. I also substituted half the amt needed of oil with olive oil. It came out moist and delicious! Wonderful recipe.

I'm replacing my mom's recipe with this one. This recipe is so foolproof that I mistakenly substituted baking soda with baking powder, and it came out delicious and moist anyway. My substitution: I only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of the recommended amount too much in my opinion; 1 1/2 cups sweetened just perfect.

Made these with sour cream once, the next time I made them with greek yogurt. Both times they came out great! Tried chocolate chips in them and even made muffins and mini muffins. Every time they come out great! I only use about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of olive oil, 1 cup of veggie oil seems excessive.

Rating: 4
I made a few changes actually, but I think they are good changes for anyone looking to make this more nutritious... First I replaced half the oil with apple sauce. Also used agave syrup instead of white sugar (about 2/3 as much), and sour cream instead of creme fraiche. I used half whole wheat flour and half spelt four. I doubled the cinnamon and added some cardamom too, not that those have any additional health benefits lol. This still came out unbelievably soft, moist, and flavourful. Mmmm and it smells so good when its baking (I hate how long it takes to bake!).

No creme fraiche in my refrig so substituted with sour cream but I did not add additional sugar. Perfect sweetness for my family. Recipe produces delicious bread with great texture. Per another reviewer's suggestion, I reduced oven temp to 325, covered with foil when loaves began browning and my bread was perfectly done at 65 minutes. Really a great recipe as is but also a great base for alterations.

I read the other reviews and also substituted Sour Cream for Creme Fraich. I also added 3-4 tablespoons of Granulated Sugar to the Sour Creme, as well as a splash of Heavy Creme. I used 3 eggs and 1 egg white, which made a little lighter. This is the best Banana Bread I've ever had.

Came out of the oven about 20min. ago. One loaf is more than half gone already. Very tasty. I switched out the walnuts with pecans just because we like them better. I had to bake it till it was quite dark to get it done in the middle, but that's fine, it's not burnt. Would definitely make this again. And probably sooner than later seeing the way these loafs seem to be disappearing :-)

Have been looking for a good banana bread recipe and this is definitely a keeper. My husband and boys both ask continually for me to make this. Have passed this recipe on to multiple friends and family members. Sometimes I mix in chocolate chips with the walnuts which makes a nice dessert bread. Also substituting pumpkin mix for the banana makes a great autumn harvest loaf.

ps: I also added some ripe peaches that I needed to use up which made the bread moist. pps: I halved the sugar and added 1 and 1/4 cup. The bread is sweet enough for my liking and anything more would have been too much for me.

A wonderful basic recipe that I tweaked a little because I did not have some of the ingredients. I added 2 cups of whole-wheat and the rest white flour, I did not have vanilla essence and so added orange zest. I substituted yoghurt for creme fraiche, I added some cardamom powder along with the cinnamon; I did not have sufficient walnuts so added almonds, pistachios and cashews. Finally, I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. The result: VERY MOIST and very tasty!

Pretty dang tasty. Just the right amount of banana. I halved the recipe, then substituted half whole wheat flour/half AP flour and half brown sugar/half granulated sugar. I also substituted banana yogurt for creme fraiche (hey, it was already in the fridge). The bread came out a tiny smidge dry; next time I will splurge for the creme fraiche and add a little extra to compensate for the wheat flour.

I have made this recipe numerous times. I replace the creme fraiche with plain yogurt. I also lower the temp to 330 and cook 1hr in a metal pan. You can play with the spices a bit too for fun. Adding ginger works well. Replacing some sugar with brown sugar I think adds a little complexity. Remember not to mix too much.

I made a half recipe and made it into muffins, baking for 25 minutes. It produce enough batter for more than 18 muffins--actually had to throw a bit out because I only had 18 muffin cups. I was kind of underwhelmed given all the rave reviews--nothing wrong with them, but pretty standard. They were a bit lighter than a lot of banana bread is, but that was not a big deal to me. Couldn't really taste the banana, and they were a tad oily for my taste. I would be giving this two forks but 8 people at my brunch ate 15 of them, so I guess they were popular! However, nobody raved about them either.

I am taking a big delicious bite as I`m writing this review. OMG it is fantastic. As some others I also used whole wheat flower, 2 cups of raw sugar, 7 bananas and added some apple sauce. The result: AMAZING. Baking time was the same as given and it came out nice and fluffy on the inside and golden brown on the outside. Will not make any other recipe from now on.

My review will be redundant among the many that have only praise for this recipe. I made half the recipe. I used ¼ cup olive oil and graded a large piece of apple to sub the veggie oil. Cut sugar to 1 cup of which ¾ was regular sugar and ¼ mixed vanilla bean and raw cane sugar. I also used sour cream, chopped almonds and cut the overly ripe bananas into chunks instead of mashing them. Baking time took less than what the recipe calls for. It came out of the oven about 45 minutes ago as a huge, dark, and gooey-from-the-banana-chunks loaf of which I have already finished about half. It is that good.

Rating: 4
Careful with the baking time. I used dark coated bread pans & my bread was burned after an hour. Second time I lowered temp to 325 & baked for 45 min, result- so moist & fluffy, still very brown.(maybe my oven, but would recommend checking at 45min.) Substituted: wholewheat flour, plain non-fat yogurt, raw sugar, 3/4c oil & 3c sugar. It was amazing!!

A delicious recipe! I halved the recipe, and the bread was still light and delicious. Exactly what I was looking for in my banana bread. Too often the bread comes out dense. The second time I made the recipe, I cut the sugar down by about 1/3 cup (my family doesn't like their bread overly sweet) and added some pineapple puree for a more moist bread. Turned out great!

Great easy recipe. Definately beat the sugar and egg for 10 minutes, it gets so thick. Only reason I gave it 3 forks is because it browns sooooo quickly. After about 30 minutes, I covered it with tin foil to try and stop the browning. It turned so brown but never burned. I baked it for 1 hour and 10 minutes and the toothpick was finally dry. Also used sour cream and added a cup of mini chocolate chips (I halved the recipe)

This is an exceptional banana bread recipe...very moist, flavorful, and easy to put together, plus you have an extra for a friend or for your freezer. The only thing I found contrary to the recipe is that the bread browns very quickly at the suggested temperature and did not take more than an hour to bake, at least not in my oven. Overall I highly recommend making this if you want a better banana bread.

Amazing recipe. I've made several versions of banana bread but this is the winner. My current boyfriend doesn't like nuts so I left them out, and replaced the creme fraiche with Fage greek yogurt (whole milk version) and it is a hit with everyone who eats it. I've found that people can't stop eating it as a matter of fact, even if they want to! This year I made about 6 loaves as holiday gifts. I'll make this one the rest of my life for sure.

This is absolutely, hands-down the BEST banana bread recipe! It's very light and very moist. The key, I think, is the method of beating the eggs for a long time (10 minutes), which you shouldn't cut short. The batter becomes very thick and airy. As others, I use sour cream instead of creme fraiche, and I add good chopped chocolate chips.

This version of banana bread was the type that I could see being sold in a bakery, perfect texture, moderate but well balanced flavor and a picture perfect loaf.

Definitely the best banana bread our family has had, and we've tried a lot of recipes! I altered it by halving it, and also cut sugar to 1 cup, split between brown and reg. white sugar, used sour cream instead of creme fraiche, and used 1/2 cup wh.wheat flour and made up the rest with white. I used 4 small bananas, which were just a bit over 1 1/2 cups. Next time, I'll be careful to only use the 1 1/2 cups (for half recipe) regardless of the number of black bananas I have on hand (ha ha) because it's bordering on being too moist. Super great texture and fabulous flavor; I could definitely tell that this recipe was created by a professional baker...it is far superior to any other, which tend to be heartier in texture and less delicate and delicious. LOVE this!

Rating: 4
This has been my favorite for years. I substitute the creme for plain yogurt, and one cup of flour for whole wheat flour, it gives it a heartier taste. Also, before adding the bananas, I mix in the dry ingredients, then divide the mix in two and do one loaf of banana bread, and the other I add frozen blueberries and a touch of lemon zest. My mother in law hates banana bread, but she absolutely loves the blueberry bread. I won her over with it. And I love the banana bread!!

This is an easy to make, positively SUBLIME banana bread, and quite forgiving, too: I don't have a stand mixer, and ten minutes holding my hand-beater seemed excessive, so I blended it for about 4 to 5 minutes, and it was fine. ALSO, I realized (only once well into the mixing...) I didn't have any oil in the house, so I substituted 1/2 cup of butter; I didn't have creme fraiche so used vanilla yogurt. It takes a long time to bake, as all banana breads do, but was well worth the wait. I'm a banana bread lover, and this one ranks up there with the BEST. (don't scrimp on the nuts -- I used pecans)

Of all the banana breads I've tried, this is DEFINITELY may favourite. It's light and fluffy, unlike many others. It also bakes perfectly every time.

This recipe is just okay, nothing special. I too have been looking for that one great banana bread recipe - this isn't it. Some things are nice - texture, toasted nuts - but it's just bland. Eat it all the first day when your house is still filled with the wonderful smell...it tricks your brain into thinking it tastes better!

I made this last night and it was great. I didn't need 2 loaves so I just cut the recipe in half. I also found that I had to tent the loaf with foil half way through as the top was getting too brown. Convection ovens tend to do that anyway so I was prepared. Just delious

I've made this banana bread twice, and it is as good as any I've ever tasted. The only substitution I made was to use 1/2 heavy cream and 1/2 sour cream in place of the creme fraiche.

This banana bread is very good. Nice and moist and a good flavor. I used whole plain yogurt instead of creme fraiche, added a little extra cinnamon and left out the walnuts (I didn't have any, but they would be a great texture in this bread). I used organic cane sugar instead of white sugar and reduced the amount by half. I made one loaf with chocolate chips, but haven't gotten into that one yet. I also used half whole wheat and half all-purpose flour, and you can't even tell! The bread seemed to brown quickly in my oven so I tented the loaves with aluminum foil for the last 20 minutes or so. I will make this again!

I finally have my "keeper" banana bread recipe after years of searching and testing. I did have some tweaks by necessity and design: cut the sugar to 2 c. (and could have gone to 1.5). Substituted in 1 c. whole wheat flour. Had very small amount of walnuts handy, so made up the balance with sunflower seeds (raw unsalted that I toasted with walnuts as per recipe), 2% greek strained yogurt for the creme fraiche. Also, I only had square cake pans, of which 2 were filled perfectly, but they were cooked by 55 minutes. Even with all the tampering, a winner!

This was a big hit with my morning break crowd. I omitted the walnuts and added and extra teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of ground cloves. I also used a high grade vanilla. It was fantastic. Also we tried it with whipped cream cheese spread, made it even better,

This is now a standard in our home. It received top marks from the three grandkids who are very picky. One likes it with no nuts and chocolate chips, two like it with nuts and chocolate chips (1/2 cup per loaf) Last time I made it I had no walnuts available but did have toffee covered pecans, this made a nice change. Also had no creme fraiche but added fat free vanilla yoghurt instead, you couldn't taste the difference.

I'm not much of a baker but my hubby declared this the best banana bread, and he wants the recipe so he can make it whenever he wants it! My changes--halved the recipe (used 4 bananas); used half white, half whole wheat flour; used light olive oil instead of vegetable oil; used 2% greek yogurt instead of creme fraiche; used 2 cups sugar--half reg sugar and half dark brown sugar; put in a touch more baking soda (because I saw that someone else who used whole wheat flour added some...not sure if it matters). It came out to exactly one loaf. Was ready in about 45-50 min.

This is good! It is now in my permanent recipe box! CHANGES: My eggs were cold, I only have a hand mixer, I used goat's milk yogurt and only 2 cups of sugar and it was soo good! I also added chocolate chips and I wish I hadn't - I think they overwhelm and are too sweet. This makes a lot!!! I got 12 muffins, 1 loaf and a 8x8 pan and its a good thing because it's going fast!

I got a bit creative with this recipe as I was making half a recipe but only had two bananas. As I was one banana short, I decided to use tinned crushed pineapple to make up the difference. The result was very tasty with not too much banana flavour. I also added a splash of rum and will add more nex time.

if you want all muffins: makes 36 and takes 20 minutes, or a bit more. Yum! And it takes 6 bananas to make 3 cups...

This is by far one of the best banana bread recipes I have ever made despite my best attempts to ruin it! Once I had already begun to make the batter I realized some of my bananas had vanished. In a desperate last minute decision I used 2 jars of 3rd step baby food bananas (in addition to 2 cups of fresh bananas) after failing to find ripe bananas at my local grocery store. The bread is extremely moist, just the right sweetness, and has fantastic texture. Everyone who has tried it loves it, I will certainly be making this again!

Very moist & delicious. I made 2 loafs and some mini-muffins. I used whole wheat flower and sour cream (b/c I didn't have any CF on hand). My 7 year old asked if I could make these again soon. My husband devoured them.

The best banana bread recipe. I have been making pastries professionally for 15 years and have never come across a better recipe for banana bread. Easily halved easily doubled. Consistent product every time. You can even use whole wheat and sucanat sugar and it still comes out moist tall and fluffy. I also like the idea of adding rum to the bananas to soak. This works really well when you have bananas that are not ripe enough. Bravo!

I made this recipe, with a couple of slight variations: I used butter instead of oil (softened on the radiator, so it was oily in constancy). Since I didn't quite have enough bananas to go around, I added some coarsely grated dark chocolate chips. I also skipped the cinnamon. Boy, was it EVER GOOD!!!

This bread is delicious. My friends and I decided to add a couple shots of bourbon to the bananas and let them sit for a bit. This made it amazing.

Excellent recipe! I approached it with an open mind as I substituted a few things and am working with a funky English oven! At first I thought this was a disaster in the making, but to my surprise the loaf and muffins I made ended up pretty close to perfect! I added some dark chocolate chips and omitted the walnuts. I also used olive oil and added a tad more cinnamon, plus a bit of nutmeg. Perfect banana bread- a major hit!

Banana bread is one of my husband's favourite snacks (I sometimes think he buys too many bananas just so we don't eat them all before they overripe). This recipe is good, not exceptional. I also used half white half brown sugar. I also used vanilla yogurt instead of crème fraîche. Managed three loafs in 8 X 4 pans instead of two.

I was in search of the best banana bread recipe-the best BASIC banana bread recipe, so my picky children would enjoy it, and guess what? This is a winner. The moisture in the bread is to-die-for; the toasted almonds are discretely mysterious, and the texture, like fine feathery silk. I would highly recommend this recipe, and will make it my "go-to" from hereforward.

I followed this exactly except that I substituted sour cream for creme fraiche. This recipe is WAY to sweet for my palate, and I thought it was a little too moist as well. I am going back to my standard which uses a mix of white and brown sugar, a 2 to 1 mix of all purpose and wheat flour, and some nice strong coffee. Hate to be in the minority, but if I could have done it this would actually have been a 2.5 fork recipe for me.

Good recipe to improvise with. For my dairy and nut allergic kid, I substituted the creme fraiche for vanilla soy yogurt and added vegan chocolate chips instead of the walnuts. I added brown sugar to the white sugar (roughly half of each). I used a muffin pan so it only took 23 minutes at 350 degrees. Very moist, tasty and took significantly less time than the recipe called for. Yummy!

So I have been trying to make the perfect Banana bread as I know it is every man's favorite snack. I wanted it dark and moist... the kind you want toasted with cream cheese decadently on top. This recipe is it! I added a drop of Molasses and substituted 1/3 cup of white sugar that the recipe called for to dark brown sugar . It is crumbley to the bite, but will hold up in your toaster. So proud of myself, now I just need the man

This is a great basic recipe. I added extra spice, nutmeg, and cinnamon - and chocolate chips (Dark). I didnt have any CF so used sour cream as well as some others. Its a Great recipe, but not amazing... still needs a little sumthin extra in my opinion.

Delicious!!! I make this recipe into mini muffins every time. sometimes I don't have creme fraiche so I use plain greek yogurt and it turns out just as good! Also, my sister told me she shaves about 1/2 cup dark chocolate into the batter. I tried it this time, and WOW! Amazing!! If you do decide to make mini muffins, set the timer to about 10 minutes and then if they still aren't done, check every two minutes after. I notice that about 13 minutes gets the muffins perfect in my oven!

This was quick and easy to make. I made it while making dinner. I didn't have any loaf pans so I used a muffin pan with cupcake cups and they were very good. Nice and moist. I made a dozen muffins and there was so much batter left over I was able to fill two 9-inch can tins. I will definitely make these again since there are always over ripe bananas in the house. I store them in the fridge until I find something to do with them.

This was great! I couldn't find any creme fraiche at my local stores. Apparently, they seem to find anything beyond Velveeta too exotic. I subbed sour cream for the creme fraiche and it worked just fine. I forgot to bring the eggs to room temperature with no ill effects. The sugar in this gives the upper crust a wonderful texture. We made two loaves and intended to give one to a neighbor.....uh...it never made it out of our house.

I have been making banana bread for years now and everyone enjoyed it. This time, using this recipe, every single person came up to tell me that it was the best banana bread they ever tasted.

I really loved this banana bread, although I did make some changes. I used 1c of apple sauce instead of the oil, and used 3/4 cups of honey to replace the sugar. I would recommend thoroughly greasing/flouring the sides and esp. the BOTTOMS of the pans because if a banana clump sinks to the bottom, it sticks quite a bit and makes removal difficult. YUM!

Back to add some notes. The changes i made i expected might make this a duller version of banana bread, but the bread is much better than any i have eaten. I made a tray of mini muffins, one tray of regular size, and a loaf pan (had to add some more plain flour and coconut water to the last of the mix in bowl to get a loaf ). Really tasty and a great alternative to sweet and fat cake breads.

Great recipe. Made some changes for a healthier version, and it was still moist, sweet, and wonderful. Was short on bananas so used 4 plus 2 cups of pureed roasted butternut squash plus a little pureed carrot. Substituted 1 cup Wholemeal flour (Odlums/Irish) for one all purpose. 20% coconut flour was added. (Must ad equal amount of liquid as it is high protein, so added coconut water. Apple sauce instead of 1 cup oil. 1 cup of coconut oil used in stead of other oil. Honey 1 cup instead of sugar, as well as 1/4 c Blackstrap Molasses. Really delicious, a big hit with adults and kids.

I love this recipe and have made it several times, however, each time the center of the bread sinks. It tastes delicious, but looks a little funny. I've made other banana breads without this happening. I'm thinking it must have to do with all the mixing of the sugar and eggs (I follow the recipe as it is written except that I do not include the walnuts. And I am careful to gently fold in the flour at the end). Does anyone else have this problem or know why it's occuring?

I made this banana bread for my daughter's class pot-luck brunch, and it was a huge hit! The best banana bread I have ever tasted or made, for that matter!

I added a 1/4 c. cocoa, 1 tsp ginger, and doubled the vanilla and cinn.

I typically use my mother's banana bread recipe, but I decided to give this one a try. I was skeptical at first--creme fraiche?--but I followed the recipe and was very pleased (don't tell mom). Due to a lack of bananas I made 1/3 the recipe and still managed to fill one loaf pan, suggesting that this batter would beat up pretty big if you were to make the full recipe.

I am not a huge fan of Banana bread but I like this recipe. I have decreased the amount of sugar to 3/4 c lt brown and 3/4 white sugar with great results. It is always moist. I have also used this to make muffins (bake for 30 minutes)and everyone loves them. A handful of chocolate chips and/ or walnuts or pecans is perfect.

I agree that this is a forgiving recipe. I'm currently on a healthy kick (which I hope I'm over soon) and instead of white flour, used whole wheat and used part applesauce, part oil (mostly applesauce). I also halved the recipe and threw in some chocolate chips, just because. The results were ok for me, my fiance, wasn't very impressed. I think next time if I use the whole wheat flour, I will use all oil because the bread was a bit dry. Who am I kidding, next time, I'll follow the recipe exactly and not make it healthy. I'm sure made as it is, with chocolate chips, it would be fantastic.

I have not tried recipe as written but modified it based on a friend's recipe. First, I halved recipe for just 1 loaf. I used 1/4 cup butter instead of oil - beating butter and sugar together first. Then I added rest of wet ingredients (using low fat plain yogurt instead of creme fraiche) then dry mixture. I melted 1/2 cup chocolate chips in microwave for 1 minute and mixed with one cup of batter. I alternated batter and chocolate batter in the pan. Drag knife through to marble. It looks, smells and tastes lovely.

I love (Love) this recipe. It's so versatile. It comes out great when i bake loaves, muffins, mini muffins... Sometimes I add nuts and/or chocolate chips (divine!). I almost always use whole wheat flour, but it's just as good if you slip in quinoa or flax meal. I used creme fresh today, but think it tastes just as good if not better with sour cream or plain yogurt. And, you can even use less oil, as long as you add moisture from somewhere else (more banana, applesauce, more yogurt etc). The best part is, nobody can ever tell when they're healthy. I think the secret for their texture is the egg and sugar whipping at the beginning of this recipe. It's a keeper!

I've been trying to find a good banana bread receipe and I think I've found it! After reading all the reviews, I made this on the weekend following the instructions to a T though I only used 1 3/4 cups of sugar instead of what was listed. I was very surprised at how well the banana bread turned out! It was not only moist but it still had a good sweetness to it. I did though turned down the temperature to 325F as I didn't want the top to be burnt. Along with some other viewers, I was also worried the top would be burnt while the inside/middle wasn't quite done yet but it turned out a lot better than I expected. Everyone loved it and I can't wait to make it again!

Very simple and very tasty :) I couldn't believe how moist it was (I did use yoghurt instead of the creme fraiche).

I am making this again to treat my office for my name day :)

Very simple, I followed the recipe exactly. Originally I was worried because I don't own an electric mixer but I found it isn't necessary. I mixed the sugar and eggs with a whisk for about 5 minutes (all my arms could take) and did the rest by hand as well. It's a little more labor intensive but well worth it for the result!

We only had 5 bananas, but this still turned out delicious and plenty banana-y! i desperately wanted to make with the creme fraiche, but could not find it anywhere, even in my fancy, gourmet supermarkets. so plain yogurt it was. I cut the sugar by 1/3 cup, and it was still nice and sweet. at the request of my fellow baker, we omitted the walnuts and threw in a handful of butterscotch chips. baked on the high end of the time range, but the loaves cooked beautifully through and through. they also popped out of the pans with no problem. Recommended recipe!

I made this banana bread exactly as the recipe called for with one exception. I halved the amount of nuts and made one plain and one with nuts.

I just made this banana bread because I couldn't bear to throw out the 6 big spotted banana's on the counter top. If I do say so myself - it came out brilliantly. They have hardly been out of the oven 2 houra - and one of them is already gone. My son said that I make "the best banana bread in the world". I've NEVER before in my life made banana bread.

This is the first time that I have made banana bread. I was trying not to waste the ripe bananas in my kitchen. Although a trip to the store later and my wallet about $10 lighter, I began to bake. I must say that my friends are raving about this cake. I didn't have loaf pans, so a used a 9 x 13, which made it more cake like, but it really was a wonderful, super moist treat. It does make a lot, thus everyone I saw this past weekend received a few pieces. Definitely will make this again!

I absolutely love this recipe. I've made it three times now. Most recently, I made it using a gluten-free blend of flours, and it came out incredibly well. It can be on the moist side, but that isn't a complaint. I use plain yogurt instead of creme fraiche, and I have added chocolate chips a few times. I leave out the nuts because I'm not fond of nuts hidden in things. I usually halve the recipe, as I don't often have 6 overripe bananas on hand.

HINT: Don't take the loaves out of the pan 10 minutes after taking them out of the oven. Let them cool fully in the pan. This allows the moisture content to even out, and saves you from dry ends and an over-soft center.

Great recipe and the notes from others regarding oil content were right on target. My son never liked the banana bread I used to make but can't get enough of this recipe. I toss spotty bananas in my freezer in the skin when its clear no one will eat them and once I get 6 to 8 medium bananas I make the recipe with the following substitutions: 1.75 cups sugar 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/3 cup oil 2/3 cup applesauce low fat sour cream instead of creme fraiche The bread turns out moist and delicious and you don't miss the oil!

Great recipe. Very moist and tasty. My bananas weren't too ripe yet the results were amazing. I used pecans instead of walnuts. Very well received as it lacked the often bitter taste imparted by walnuts. Yumm!

I halved the recipe and used lowfat sour cream intead of creme fraiche. Also used half oil and half apple sauce to make it a little lower in fat. It was absolutely delicious. Moist and flavorful...I could eat the whole loaf myself.

This is the best banana bread recipe. It's more moist than the other banana nut bread recipe found on this site (Gourmet 2004). Following the other reviewers' advice, I substituted half of the oil for applesauce. Will definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe, very moist and easy to make. This has now replaced my regular banana bread recipe.

Delicious recipe! My friends rave when I serve this. Note, the top will brown quickly, but the interior will not be cooked through - not to worry though, I don't cover it and the top is never tough/burnt. I usually make 1 loaf at a time and it generally takes a little more than 1 hour to bake. The only substitution I make is sour cream for the creme fraiche.

This is our new favorite banana bread recipe. It produces a perfectly light banana bread--much different from the heavy loaves we're accustomed to. I used yogurt instead of creme fraiche and reduced the sugar to 1 3/4 c.

One of my staples! Having a measure (3 cups) for the the mashed bananas helps make this a banana bread that never falls. I sometimes add apple sauce to make the 3 cups if I don't have enough bananas, or change the recipe entirely by substituting pumpkin puree.

This is a great easy recipe, but I made some personalized modifications (as usual). Used 1 cup all purpose flour, 1¾ cup whole wheat and ½ cup ground flax. Used only 1¾ cups natural/demerara sugar plus two tablespoons each of honey and dark maple syrup. Added ½ teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg. Normally I'd substitute half of the oil with applesauce, but I had none, so I used only ¾ cup of oil. The result was a deliciously moist and slightly healthier bread. I also omitted the nuts as my daughter does not like them. This recipe gave me a dozen regular sized muffins and three dozen mini muffins that will go with my daughter and her volleyball team to their regional tournment this weekend!

Rating: 0
This is an awesome recipe. I eliminated the nuts because I am allergic, substituted apple sauce for half of the oil, used wheat flour, used yogurt instead of the cream and used splenda for most of the sugar, used organic sugar for the last 1/3 cup. My wife loves it and I think it's EASY.

WOW! Best banana bread i have ever had, Super moist, really good flavor Best ever!!!!

Wonderful recipe. The bread is delicious, moist, and interestingly enough, came across as rich and creamy. I made my own creme fraiche, which required some planning ahead (this website's food dictionary tells how - very easy). I did find that I had to bake longer than the recipe calls for; about 80-85 mins. I also only used 5 bananas. It's a house favorite!

Best banana bread recipe ever! I used less sugar (1.75 cups) + lots of cinnamon and vanilla. I also added a bit of nutmeg and 2 tablespoons of maple syrup. I also use plain yogurt as a substitute. The result was a moist fluffy cake.

This is a wonderful recipe. Very easy. I also used greek plain yogurt and only 5 large bananas. I think my pans must only be 8 inches because I had way too much batter. I made 15 mini muffins in addition to the 2 loaves. The breads took about 60 minutes but I turned the oven down to 300 after 20 minutes because they were getting to brown. The mini muffins only took 15 minutes to bake @ 350. The bread is better the next day!!

To add to my comment below, I now made it several times and doubled the sour cream 24%, the structure/fibre of the banana keeps the batter up, allowing the extra sour cream. The bread comes out extra moist

It's a very good recipe. I just add sour cream instead of creme fraiche. I only add 5 bananas because the the banana was extra large. I didn't put the cinnamom because my boyfriend's mother don't like the smell of cinnamon. Baked it for 45 minutes with 350 degree and 300 degree for the last 10-15 minutes. It turned out great! I messed up on a lot of baking. This instructions is perfect for people like me. It's delicious! Thanks!

Execelent and easy, great banana braed I made muffins for my wife and kids, baking time should go down to half. I also changed half of the white sugar for brown sugar and made it less sweet in taste. Key is to let them down to rest and achieve room temperature!! two different tastes warm and cold.

Halved the recipe and accidentally used an extra 1/6 cup of sugar, but it didn't end up being a problem. Used sour cream instead of creme fraiche and pecans instead of walnuts. Didn't have any eggs, so used vegan substitute that I knew of (2 tbsp water, 1 tbsp cooking oil, 2 tsp baking powder for every egg needed). Turned out INCREDIBLE - moist and flavorful!

Great recipe! My boyfriend loved it and the fact it was two loaves was great. I added chocolate chips to the second loaf and it was even more moist, especially right after it was out of the oven! I'll definitely be making this one again.

this was wonderful. I lost my favourite cookbook with the banana bread I have made for years. This is equal. Halfed the recipe (regret this now, the loaf disappeared within 24 hours) and had to use sour creme and almonds that I prior toasted. I also used butter instead, but I can see how vegetable oil would work too, next time I will try hazelnut oil that I have. A definite keeper.

I ended up cutting this recipe in half and it turned out just fine. Did not have creme fraiche on hand but used Greek yogurt. Everyone loved it and I'm sad there's only a couple pieces left.

This is the best banana bread recipe I have ever encountered- moist, delicious-yumm! I only made the following changes based on other reviews: 1/3c less sugar, sour cream for the creme fraiche, and one loaf with walnuts and the other without. My family preferred the one without the nuts, so next time I'll experiment with other add-ins. Awesome recipe!

Rating: 4
What a fabulous recipe! I cut the sugar and will probably cut it down to 1 C. next time, however. I used all spelt flour and subbed 1/2 C. ground flax seed for 1/2 C. of the flour. I then added chopped dried dates soaked in rum, nutmeg and chai masala dry spice mix (sans the tea, of course). I also reduced the oil by just over 1/4 cup with no ill effects. What a result -- sticky date bits, crunchy walnuts and small banana chunks.

I didn't follow directions to a T, but I loved this bread because it isn't sticky like most banana breads. The top of the loaf came out nice & crunchy & golden. I only had 3 bananas (oops!), and I substituted a little sour cream & milk for the creme fraiche. Also I didn't have any walnuts. I thought the batter was a little on the sweet side, and I measured lightly, so don't over-do the sugar.

I loved this recipe-modified a bit for Colorado's high altitude (for the person who said it was mushy?) less oil--3/4 cup, more flour--3 1/2 cup and less sugar--2 1/4 cup as well as only 1 3/4 tsp baking soda instead of 2 tsp. Started bread out at 365 for 15 minutes to set, then turned down to 350 seemed to help with it sinking. Sugar could go down more to about 1 3/4 cup easily... great bread though, the 10 minutes beating is crucial!!

I'm not really a banana lover, but my partner is and he has sworn by his mother's banana bread recipe for years. I made this one for him, left out the walnuts and added chocolate chips. He tells me this one is better than his mother's! I think that means it's a keeper.

I followed the advice of a cook from san francisco's review that says "used full fat yogurt instead of creme fraiche, mixed 1/3rd whole wheat flour in the flour and used brown sugar and white sugar in 1:1 ratio" and i have to say it is to die for!!!! i loved it!!!! it is so fluffy and just delicious. i also left one banana unmashed and sliced it onto the batter at the end before cooking, so there were slices in the bread, definitely a winner!

This is a great Banana Bread recipe! Changes I made: 1/2 oil 1/2 applesauce, sour creme, used a hand mixer, toasted pecans, reduced the sugar by 1/3 cup (could actually reduce further), and used more bananas than suggested. I mixed regular bananas with miniatures (less sweet) and ended up with more batter too! Made 6 muffins and three loafs - one large and two smaller. Tastes great and my house smells wonderful!!

Very tasty and moist. Did not have vegetable oil so did a like for like replacement with olive oil. I halved the recipe and to ensure no olivey taste I used 4 bananas and the full amounts of cinammon and vanilla. Came out great with no olive taste. Also used a square pan instead of a loaf pan.

made these into muffins and they are really great, however - i cut the sugar back to 1.75 cups and used applesauce instead of oil, and they were a bit sweet. the texture was still really good using the applesauce in place of the oil, but will cut the sugar back to 1 cup the next time.

This was the most delicious recipe for banana bread that I have ever tasted! It beats even Mom's recipe...wow! I used cream cheese instead of creme fraiche just because i already had it in my fridge. I also tried instead of a loaf, to make banana bread muffins. YUM. These I baked at the same temperature for about 20-22 minutes.

Let me start off by saying that I do not like banana bread in general. Having said that, this recipe is excellent. I only made a half batch, as I only had 3 bananas, but I did not cut the vanilla, cinnamon, or salt in half. The rest of the ingredients I did cut in half. I also added a little extra flour (~1T) as the batter seemed too runny. I tasted the batter, and it was everything I could do to bake it, because the batter was so tasty. I followed the directions otherwise, except that I baked it in a bundt pan. Then I turned it out of the pan and topped it with a glaze made form 3T milk, 1 t. vanilla, 1 t. cinnamon, and enough powdered sugar to make it a glaze consistency. Excellent. I'm about to go back for another piece while it is still warm.

This recipe is very different from the butter-based ones I usually make. I omitted the walnuts and used full-fat Greek yogurt instead of creme fraiche. The batter really expanded a lot and the recipe spilled out of the pans and all over my oven, leaving a lot of crusty edge to cling all over the pans. THAT SAID: once I hacked the majority of the loaves out of the pan, this was a delicious and incredibly moist banana bread.

This bread, based on household consumption results, is perfect. What I really found compelling is the fact that it begins on a brownie base which gives it the option to become cake like or chewy depending on the sugar and flour content. I use sour cream and have reduced the sugar to two cups.

I made this recipe two days ago and my family could not stay away from the bread! I used regular heavy whipping cream and a few more walnuts than the recipe called for. I left the walnuts a bit large and also sprinkled some on top after pouring batter in the pans. The tops of the bread turned a beautiful color and had a nice split right on top. I gave one loaf to a neighbor as a gift and have already been asked to make more! Though the bread is wonderful i do think that i will add the sour cream the next time for a little offset flavor!

I've made this bread over and over again with no baking issues. It is delicious. The only change I make is that I do not use all of the oil, I replace most of it with applesauce. One time I made it without the sour cream (didn't have any but I had lots of RIPE banannas) it was o.k. but the sour cream is essential in my opinion.

i really liked the balanced taste of this banana bread. however, the bread was a little dark for my taste. i pulled it out of the oven as soon as the toothpick was just a little damp. i'm thinking the next time i'll cook it at a lower temp for maybe a little longer or maybe just make them as cupcakes. i want to make it as a cake with a warm coconut icing. mmm.

I had high hopes for this one - tried it the other day and it was so sad! The tops were burnt and one of the loaves was underdone in the center. I assume this was an oven issue, not a recipe issue. Right? I just moved into a new place, so I don't know the oven yet (it's electric). What can I do?

Rating: 0
Followed the recipe except for the following: Used stone ground whole wheat flour, reduced sugar to 2 cups, omitted the walnuts (didn't have any) and added only about two cups mashed bananas. I think it came out well and the whole wheat flour gives it a little crunchiness on the top. Although it does taste banana- y, I think the entire three cups of bananas would taste a little better. It only took about an hour to cook and I had to reduce the oven to 330 degrees at about 30 minutes. I also followed another reviewer's note about putting foil over the loaves. I haven't made this yet, but I bet a spread made from cheese cheese with some shredded coconut might taste good on the bread!

Rating: 0
I substituted a very ripe canteloupe for the bananas (processing it then draining in a yoghurt sieve to equal 3 cups). I substituted Egg Starts for the eggs at the rate of 1/3 cup substitute for one egg, Then I used a stick of butter instead of oil, like one of the other reviewers suggested I used fat-free yoghurt instead of creme fraiche, because that was what I had, and instead of 2 teas. vanilla, I put in 1/2 teas vanilla and 1 teas of orange flavoring. I substituted spelt flour for the half the flour, Anyway, it tasted great, just a little too sweet so next time if I use melon, I might use 1/2 cup less sugar. Actually, it tasted fabulous and my husband and I ate one whole loaf for dinner. I think the melon and orange flavoring was a lucky combination.

I prepared this exactly as written, except that instead of two 9x5 pans I used three 30cm x 8 cm pans (closest thing available here). It came out gummy and I found it too sweet. The banana/vanilla/cinnamon flavors were nicely balanced, though.

I've made this many times and it always comes out great! In addition to everyone else's suggestions, I've replaced 1/4 cup of the sugar with maple syrup which comes out good. For an awesome dessert, try throwing shredded coconut and chocolate chips in it - sinfully delicious!

This made a nice fluffy banana bread. Although, I mashed up 3 bananas well and 1 coarsely; If the banana is too chunky, it almost tastes like raw batter in the cake. But I got compliments all around!

Ive made this recipe as stated and with different variations on oil/butter, sour cream and/ yogurt, liqueurs instead of or in addition to vanilla, chunked vs. mashed bananas, alternate garnishes, etc. All have turned out very well. The only advice I would add to that of the fabulous advice of prior reviewers is to use slightly less batter per pan than normal if using a full loaf pan, for more even cooking. Also, if you must sub kosher or sea salt for bakers salt make sure to account for the change in volume, and either grind it or dissolve it in the vanilla first. As a previous reviewer said, the mark of a good recipe is its flexibility, especially in pastry, and this recipe scales & substitutes beautifully. Some of the issues raised in the reviews sound like they are more related to pan size and/or type, oven performance (uneven temperature), or issues with ingredients (old flour, under ripe bananas, etc.) Also, the texture is on the verge of being more reminiscent of cake, so you may want to bake in muffin tins (mini muffins work great) and find a quickbread recipe for more traditionally textured banana bread.

EXCELLENT! I did make a few changes based on what i had available-- substituted a stick of butter for the oil, plain lowfat yogurt for the creme fraiche, and did 1/2 sugar 1/2 brown sugar...delicious!! i will have to give some away to the neighbors, or else i fear that i will be up all hours of the night eating little pieces until it is gone! enjoy!

Oh - and about the 10 minute beating of the eggs and sugar. I have tried this recipe twice just beating by hand until it thickens enough to leave "ribbons," and the bread came out fine. I've also tried using an electric hand mixer and beating it for the full 10 minutes, and I have to say -- the bread's texture turned out to be clearly superior. Not that the hand version wasn't good, but it's a bit more dense, whereas the electric 10-minute version was just very light and fluffy but still held together -- it was really amazing. Try both if you can and see.

I have had nothing but the best reviews from my friends about this banana bread. I follow it to the letter, except for adding chocolate chips, and the part where it calls for "coarsely mashed" bananas -- I mash them all the way in a cup so that they turn into a creamy consistency before pouring it in with the rest of the stuff. I'm guessing (and it's only a guess) that it contributes to how moist the bread comes out. Will be making this again and again and again.

I made this banana bread because I had 2 1/2 bananas that were on the counter, waiting to be eaten or used in some way. I left out the nuts, because I'm not a fan, but next time I might add some raisins instead because I think that they would go well. I also used about 1/4 cup of butter instead of the creme fraiche which worked just fine. Over all I was really pleased with the recipe and will most likely make it in the future. I plan to take a couple of slices to school when it starts and keep them as a snack in my locker.

I used one cup of brown sugar in place of 1 cup of white sugar. I used 1/2 cup of room temp butter & 1/2 cup oil, and didn't add nuts. Also, my bananas weren't fresh, I used old, vacuum sealed frozen bananas, that I let thaw so they were a weird consisentcy - I threw out a lot of liquid from the bag. Besides that the bread sunk in the middle, and I tented foil because the tops were very brown, the banana bread is yummy. A little high maintenance in the cooking process, but fun to make. A bit more light an airy than other more dense bread I've made.

Rating: 3
This is the banana bread recipe I have been looking for. Great flavor, texure and easy to do. I subbed sour cream for the creme fraiche, and used half brown sugar and half white granulated. I was able to stretch the batter to get 3 loaves. And, at least in my oven, they had to be rotated half way through baking and tented toward the end.

Rating: 3
I'm surprised that no one else seems to have a problem with the 10-min. mixing of the eggs and the sugar. I don't own a standing mixer, so I just beat the eggs with my hand mixer on high for 2 min. and the bread was delicious. I used light sour cream instad of creme fraiche. You also do not have to wait 30 min. for the eggs to come to room temp -- just put the eggs into a bowl (out of the shell) and micro. on very low temp for a couple of min.

I read the other reviews and used many of the modifications suggested with great results! This was delicious and my family loved it! I made half a recipe (one loaf) and incorporated the following modifications: less sugar (brown and white), unsweetened apple sauce and melted butter in place of of the vegetable oil, light sour cream for the cream fraiche, chocolate chips for the nuts, and some wheat flour mixed in with the white. This one is a keeper! Thank you all for the excellent suggestions and modifications!

I read quite a few of the reviews before I made this recipe, so I was a little doubtful about the results...but I'm happy to say this banana bread is wonderful! I followed others advice and cut back the sugar to 2 scant cups (one white, one brown), subbed sour cream for creme fraiche, used 1/2 c melted butter and 1/2 c applesauce instead of oil and lowered the cooking temp to 325. I also added a little freshly ground nutmeg. Baked in 2 loaf pans for 1 hr 10 mins and got absolutely perfect loaves... will definitely make again, this one is a keeper!

I am a big fan of this recipe. However, I did make some modifications - i only put in 1.5 cups of sugar (3/4 cup white, 3/4 brown), used a 1/2 cup of unsweetened apple sauce and a 1/2 cup of melted butter in place of of the vegetable oil, and light sour cream for the cream fraiche. oh, I sure didn't toast those walnuts - but it turned out delicious!

I followed izalina from San Jose,CA's changes, except I used 2/3 cup white sugar instead of a cup, and I added more cinnamon, some nutmeg and cloves. Best banana bread I have ever had, let alone made, and the only one I've ever NOT burned a little. Takes a little longer, what with the beating eggs and sugar for ten minutes, but well worth it.

This was an interesting recipe. I'm still not sure how I feel about the end result, which I would say is more like a banana sponge than your average banana bread. I had many of the same problems as previous reviewers including over-browning. Also I don't have two 9 x 5 loaf pans so I baked the batter in two 8.5 x 4.5 pans and poured the remainder into an 8" square pan. I agree with the reviewer who said this would be better off baked in a cake pan and called a cake.

Excellent recipe. I agree with others that it does not need as much sugar as the recipe calls for; 1 to 1 1/4 cup sugar is plenty!

Great! The lightest and most tasty banana bread I have ever made. I followed the recipe except to substitute plain yogurt for the crème fraîche. And instead of walnuts I used chopped up butterfinger candy bars. (I was making this on 11/1 and had them left over from Halloween). I will make this many more times.

Best Banana bread recipe ever. As suggested by others: I reduced the sugar to 1 cup, added Marsala soaked golden raisins, I substituted the vegetable oil for 1/3 almond oil 1/3 butter and 1/3 organic applesauce. But the bananas I used were my own home grown very sweet Lady finger bananas, hence 1 cup of sugar was plenty sweet.

I used 1 cup of brown and 1 cup white sugar. I also used 1/2 cup of walnut oil and 1/2 cup melted butter. I sub'd sour cream for creme fraiche. I added rum soaked raisins, chocolate chips and walnuts. I also used 1 cup shredded carrots and 2 cups bananas. I sub'd 1 1/2C wheat flour for white flour. My fiance loved it because it was not overly sweet, yet light & moist with a crunchy exterior. It's a keeper.

I made this with the following changes as suggested by previous reviewers: Sour cream instead of cream fraiche, 1C brown and 1C white sugar, half cup butter and half cup applesauce instead of oil. I didn't have enough walnuts, so I threw in some dried cranberries too. It turned out moist and delicious, and perhaps the best banana bread I've ever had! I will absolutley make tbis again - and soon!

My family loves this recipe, but I changed a few things. I, like others, used heavy cream instead of creme fraiche. I cut the sugar to 2 cups, but I think it is too sweet still and next time will use 1 3/4 cups instead. I, also, used 1 cup of apple sauce instead of the oil. Very delicious!

We love this recipe. I've tried many and have finally found a keeper. It's moist and has plenty of banana flavor. I've made it several times and it turns out great. I took suggestions from several of the reviews, 2 cups sugar, melted butter rather than oil, cream rather than creme fraiche. I also add blueberries rather than walnuts. Very good.

Yuk! What a waste of 6 ripe bananas! It was too sweet and very bland and left a bad taste in my mouth. It browned too much on the outside before it was baked all the way through. It also didn't rise as high as it probably should have -- it kind of domed but sank a little in the very middle. I substituted sour cream for the creme fraiche. In my opinion, decreasing the sugar (perhaps by as much as a cup -- I'm wondering if 2 1/3 c was a misprint) and omitting the sour cream/creme fraiche (depending on how much you decreased the sugar) would probably improve this recipe by allowing it to rise better and by reducing the overwhelming sweetness and excessive browing. However, I'm not going to bother tinkering with this recipe because there's many better banana bread recipes out there (I've made some of them) and this recipe is so bland that it's not worth it.

I have made this twice. Both times it tastes a little bitter. I think it's the 2t. of baking powder. That sounded excessive to me and I think I can taste it. I'm not certain and it has received many favorable reviews, but I'm going to keep looking for the best banana bread recipe.

I just made this recipe and if you're looking for a banana "bread" recipe, this might not be for you. The taste was fine, but I did have to up the cinnamon to about 4 tsps. as suggested. And I did have to cover the loaves for the last 20 minutes of baking. I baked a total of 70 mins at the directed temperature. I kept the sugar amount the same and didn't find it too sweet. Because of the creaming of the butter and sugar for 10 minutes, it has a fluffy and cakey texture. Not like a "bread", which is the type of recipe I was looking for. After tasting it, I think it would have just been better to pour the batter in a 9 X 13 pan, bake it and just call it a cake.

I've tried this twice, because I was amazed by all the fuss over banana bread, and both times it's been kind of gross. Low quality banana bread. It doesn't cook evenly - burnt in some places and raw in others - and tastes bland. Furthermore, it's got a zillion more calories than most other banana breads. Don't waste your time with this recipe.

Not a big fan of banana bread, but this turned out delicious. Used 2 cups sugar and baked at 325 as suggested. Substituted heavy cream for cream fraichaise or whatever. Made one thin loaf and one pan of muffins, only had to cook for 30 minutes before it was done. Complements dark beer very well!

Rating: 2
I guess I should have read more of the 148 reviews to get a little advice on altering the recipe slightly. I found that it browned on the outside FAR too quickly, making for an almost burned and crunchy outside and a raw middle (in the very center of the loaf). I'm guessing that cutting back on the sugar would solve this problem? The flavor and texture were great on the ends (I had to throw away the middle section), but probably a little too sweet for my taste. I will try it again taking everyone's suggestions into consideration. I really want this recipe to work for me!

I made some modifications, as follows, I doubled the cinnamon, used half banana and half orange marmalade (I only had four small/medium bananas), I cooked them in stoneware loaf pans, and turned heat down to 325 for last ten minutes to prevent too dark of a crust. I also always use egg beaters, instead of eggs and I did not let them get to room temperature. This came out sooo good, I can't wait to share the bread in about an hour!

I was a bit skeptical to try out this recipe because all my other banana breads have been disasters.I cut this recipe in half just in case it turned out to be another failure and omitted the nuts and creme fraiche. But it turned out to be wonderful, the bread was moist on the inside and the edges were turned golden brown just right. I will definately make this dish again.

We loved this recipe! I modified it slightly per comments of previous reviewers: reduced the sugar to slightly less than 2 cups; used 1/2 cup melted butter and 1/2 cup oil; heavy cream instead of creme fraiche; vanilla paste instead of vanilla (side note...wow that is good); and pecans instead of walnuts (I'm in Texas...pecans rule). I also used cake flour since I didn't have all purpose on hand, and subtituted that based on package directions. The only thing that seemed odd to me is that the bread didn't puff up like bread normally does. When sliced, it makes perfect little rectangles. Still delicious, though.

GREAT banana bread! Very moist and flavorful. I used sour cream instead of creme fraiche and melted butter instead of oil, reduced sugar to under 2c and added chocolate chips. Delicious! Next time I might forgo the chips for a more typical banana flavor, but I would still definitely cut the sugar, as this bread hovers deliciously close to cake status. Give this one a try and tweak it to your taste.

I have been making this bread for about 2 years now.

I give mini loaves as christmas gifts at the office, I bring to potlucks, etc. EVERYONE raves about this bread. Absolutely delicious!

I followed a few of the suggestions made by the person below. I reduced the sugar to 1 3/4 Cups & would reduce it further to 1 1/2 Cups the next time. I also reduce the vegetable oil to a "scant" cup rather than a full cup. The suggestion to reduce the oven temperature to 325. is a good one as I also found the tops getting brown & the bread not quite done. I also had 7 very ripe bananas on hand & threw them all in. I substituted the nuts for the same amount of chocolate chips and was very pleased with the outcome. I also used fat free sour cream instead of Creme Fraiche. I divided up the dough into 6 mini loaf pans, which was the perfect number for the amount of dough. We ate two loaves & I froze the rest. I figure they will make great hostess gifts over the holidays or even good for company dropping by for coffee.

After reading a great many of your reviews, I made this banana bread, and would only change a few things. First of all, do yourself a favor and lower the temp to 325 and cook it longer. Because there is so much sugar in this recipe (and I only used 2 cups, like many others did), the top browns too quickly. I used sour cream (instead of creme fraiche) and will next time try chcocolate chips in the batter. Unlike others that felt the banana flavor was lost on the 2nd day, that wasn't the case here, as I think that has everything to do with the bananas you choose to use and nothing to do with this recipe. Also, I think I will also try melted butter rather than oil the next time around, as it will probably have a less oily taste. All in all a good recipe, and I will definitely make it again with the aforementioned changes. Of all the reviews I have read, isn't it a riot that NOT ONE of us actually followed the recipe as printed? I love that!

Rating: 4
I loved this banana bread. Not too dry. I also made a couple of alterations. I cut down on the sugar to just 2 cups. The extra 1/3 cup of sugar is definitely not necessary. I added one more banana, just because I had it. I used whipping cream because I didn't have creme fraiche. i think I will try Sour Cream next time, or a little milk. I don't think the bread needs the extra fat content.

I registered for this website just to rate this recipe. I was initially skeptical about the recipe, even after reading all the posts. I bake a lot of banana bread and have to say this is probably the best recipe I've ever come across. It's moist, banana-y, sweet, and delicious. THANKS TO EVERYONE for their suggestions and comments. I substituted whole wheat flour for half of the flour and added an extra half teaspoon of baking soda, substituted brown sugar for half of the sugar, used 7 over-ripe bananas, and added a teaspoon of allspice. I used a hand-mixer, and I think it was worth it to thoroughly mix the eggs and sugar, as in the recipe.

Great recipe! Mixing time for eggs and sugar is crucial. Halved the recipe according to the review below and made one large and one small loaf. (Small loaf baked for 30 minutes, large for one hour.) Substituted sour cream for creme fraiche. A keeper!

Since I only had three bananas on hand, I cut the recipe roughly in half using 1 3/4 cup flour, 1 1/3 cup of sugar and 1/8 cup of half and half. Despite this I still had enough batter to fill one full size loaf pan and three mini loaves. Had I added the nuts, the batter would have been enough for two loaf pans. I think the secret to success with this recipe is beating the eggs and sugar the length of time indicated. It certainly gives the batter height and halving the recipe avoided the gummy, overly dense results others had. We'll certainly make it again with the modifications indicated

Rating: 2
not convinced. Too gummy in the middle, it becomes incredibly dense. In it's favor, it has a very banana-intense flavor, but other recipes are better.

Rating: 4
Great recipe - have thrown out the ones I used to use. Definitely use 1/2 brown sugar - it is not too sweet - sour cream or 1/2n1/2 are good substitutes for the creme fraiche. You MUST use very ripe bananas. It calls for 6 LARGE bananas so add more if you're using medium or small ones. If using a glass baking dish reduce heat to 325 - it does brown fast so watch the time.

I followed the recipe and I agree with the other reviewers who said it was too sweet. If I use this recipe again I'll definitely try it with 1-11/3 c. sugar.

Great cake!! I made half the recipe, to accommodate the number of ripe bananas I had on hand. I also modified the recipe by using 1c whole wheat pastry flour and 1/2c all purpose flour; 1/2c white sugar and 1/2c unpacked light brown demerra (had the latter on hand and wanted to use it up); and a couple of tbls. of fromage frais (a fresh, unprocessed cream cheese) because I had neither creme fraiche nor sour cream on hand. I also added about 1/2c dark chocolate chips with the toasted walnuts. The cake was a hit: moist, tender and balanced in sweetness and flavour. The long beating of the egg with the sugar is definitely key to achieving a proper crumb with the whole meal flour. Definitely a keeper!

Rating: 4
Wonderful banana bread! I halved the recipe and now wish that I had 2 loaves. Because I had them, I used 5 medium bananas for the reduced recipe, half smashed and half sort of sliced or chunked as some reviewers suggested doing. As also suggested, I substituted and used a generous measure of sour cream, a tad more cinnamon, used half light brown sugar and half white, and then also tossed in some allspice. I was using King Arthur all purpose flour which can be a bit hard so I substituted in cake flour for a bit less than half of the flour called for altogether. I was a little concerned that it might be overly sweet as some reviewers wrote, but I only used a tad less sugar than called for thinking that if worst came to worst and the rest of the recipe was good, I could always lower the sugar significantly the next time around. I tasted the batter before putting it in the oven and it did seem pretty sweet and the cake smelled sweet when it came out to cool, but when I cut into it later, it was perfect and not overly sweet at all. I think using half brown sugar probably made all the difference. It does brown quickly so I watched it carefully after the 45 minute mark and removed it as soon as the skewer test indicated that it was done inside. It was not too dark at that point, but I could easily imagine that just a few too many extra minutes could make it so. Everyone loved it. I will definitely make this recipe again.

It made 2 loaves & 6 muffins - and didn't take near as long in my convection oven. It's important to beat the eggs properly - a stand mixer is your best friend here! I took this to work and it disappeared almost before I set the plate down. I make this again and again!

i just made this bread today and it was wonderful! my sister, who never eats bananas, thought it was delicious. i added an extra cup of bananas (i dont think u can ever have too much), a GENEROUS quarter cup of sour cream in place of the creme fraiche, one cup brown sugar and one cup white, and then i realized i was out of cinnamon. i used ground allspice in place of the cinnamon and it was FANTASTIC! i kept on adding the allspice until i could smell it in the batter. the aroma was delicious while it baked and had a distinct flavor. i followed the suggestion of another fellow cook to bake it at 325. it was fine, but i had to bake it for reaalllly long and jus decided to turn up the heat. the bread is so moist and scrumptiously chewy from the bananas! a must make bread!

I have tried a lot of different banana bread recipes and this one is in my top 3. I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar and didn't think it was too sweet.

I also substituted sour cream for the creme fraiche and omitted the walnuts. I sprinkled sugar on the top before baking for a little bit of crunch. Watch the top so it doesn't get too dark.

Alot of recipes call for 2-4 bananas, and I've always felt that wasn't enough. I guess I'm one of those who likes too much Nestle's in my chocolate milk, but 6 bananas is definitely right on the flavor! I didn't premash them, I just sliced them into the mixer as it worked them in beautifully. Also since my brother-in law is lactose intolerant, the oil in this recipe was a perfect fit, I just ommited the creme freche. I made 12 muffins, and a large loaf with this recipe... it lasted about 4 days!

I actually used this recipe only to crib proportions. I'm moving house and was trying to use up what I had around the kitchen (including some rotten bananas) without unpacking my own cookbooks. I made a number of variations, which can be read here: http://forum.auraskitchen.com/index.php/topic,25.0.html. Sometime when I've unearthed my electric mixing beaters and unpacked, maybe I'll try it the way it's written here. My own haphazard version, though, including hand whisking for less than a minute instead of electric beating for ten, substituting chocolate chips for toasted walnuts, and not using crème fraiche or vanilla, worked out great, though. The mark of a good recipe is its flexibility. :)

Ugh - what a disappointment. Even though I actually put some extra banana in, this banana bread had practically no banana flavor whatsoever, especially on the second day. The only reason I gave it 2 forks instead of one is because in one of the loaves I put some chocolate chips and that made it taste half decent. I've made A LOT of banana bread in my life and this is definitely the worst ever.

This recipe was delicious and nice and moist. The recipe was enough for two loaves, so I made one with nuts and one without. I preferred the one without nuts. My husband is the usual banana bread baker in our home, but this version was much more moist than the one he typically makes. We loved it.

very moist and yummy. I used two round cake pans which dropped my cooking time down to about 40 minutes. I 86'd the nuts and added chocolate chips to half of my batter and ended up with 2 cake pans and 6 muffins. There was a lot of batter. This has also kept very well wrapped up.

Didn't look like enough batter for two loaves, so I made one and ended up having to cook it longer to get the middle done. Next time I would do one loaf and 6 muffins...but I don't think there will be a next time. Even making allowances for overcooking, this was way too sweet (when I tasted the batter beforehand is was so sweet it made my mouth burn, but I bravely saw this through to the end) and didn't taste enough like bananas. Big bummer.

awesome recipe, But i am not a recipe follower so...used more cinnamon and a little fresh nutmeg. buttermilk instead of creme fraiche, 1/2 butter no oil less sugar and the big difference... 1 cup of hazelnut flour (finely ground hazelnuts) for 1 cup of flour. Delicious

I appreciate this recipe simply because it is perfect. The crust is sweet and chewy. I omit 1 or 2 bananas and add grated orange rind, cranberries and chocolate chunks. Superb! It is gobbled up everywhere I go and now people ask me for banana bread!

I do not usually rate recipes, but had to in this case. This was wonderful banana bread. I followed the recipe exactly the first time, and it was great. I have made it several times since, and make a few changes: I use 1/2 melted butter and 1/2 applesauce instead of the oil. I use 2 c brown sugar instead of the 2 1/2 c white sugar. And I add dried cranberries. This touch is the winning factor. I have made it with fresh blueberries and with choc. chips... But the cranberries win spoons down! I bring it into work and people rave and take slice after slice. A real winner.

This is wonderful banana bread. As did others, I used plain yogurt in place of the creme fraiche. I also used 1/4 cup ground flax seeds in place of that amount of flour (I find this lightens up baked goods, as well as adding immensely to the health benefits.) I wouldn't change a thing next time. I do feel obliged to comment on the pan size; I don't know what happened, but my recipe only filled (and not that full, either) one 9x5 loaf pan.

A wonderfully moist cake. I used sour cream, half the sugar and 1/2-3/4 cups oil. Still very moist! I think I didn't fold it too well. It got flat. Nonetheless, it was still a great bread/cake.

This came out absolutely amazing!!! Followed recipe as is, but I did also cut back on about half of the sugar. I put in some mini chocolate chips to make up for it...Shouldn't be called bread, it's like cake..My husband refuses to share it with anyone. Would make again and again.

I agree with the reviewer who thought the banana flavor was a little pale. I used nice ripe bananas and still didn't get much banana flavor coming through. On the other hand, I taste too much of the considerable amount of vegetable oil.

Great recipe - Couple things you should be ware of: For 2 small loafs of bread, the recipe calls for 2-1/3 cups of sugar. That is positively toothing-rotting; I use about half that. Also, I substituted coconut milk for creme fraiche, and cut back the veg. oil, and it turned out great.

I took the advice from the cook from Portland and substituted sour cream for the creme friche. It worked out fine. Although mine became a really dark brown color, not burnt but dark brown inside as well. Almost like a rye bread color. I couldn't figure out why.

One of my first criteria for evaluating a banana bread is the aroma while it is baking. This one passed that test after only 15 minutes in the oven. A very moist and flavorful bread. The only thing I will change next time is to decrease the amount of sugar. A keeper.

Hard to award basic banana bread four forks, but as banana bread goes, this is an exceptional recipe - one of my two favorites (along with Paula Deen's recipe from the original The Lady & Sons cookbook): very moist, crumb is perfect, pronounced flavor - really fabulous. Will definitely make again.

This recipe has replaced my grandmother's banana bread recipe. I ususally do not have creme fraishe on hand so I use sour cream, it turns out perfectly that way. When I make the two loaves, the first loaf is gone before it is even cool, the second loaf my mum takes to work where it is raved about. By far the best banana bread I have ever eaten

Used sour cream instead of creme fraiche and cooked for 45 minutes using 2 8" x 4" pans. I had enough left over for six muffins and took them out 15 minutes early. Incredibly moist and very good. Make sure you let the center cook its final bit out of the oven - don't overcook!

I followed the recipe ingredients exactly and it turned out great! The bread is very moist, just the right sweetness, and wonderful even 3 days later! I had to increase the baking time for another 20 minutes or so. I also didn't use an electric mixer, but I got a good workout from it! I'm plannin on making it again once my bananas are ripe!!

With so many 4 fork ratings I just had to choose this recipe over the other banana bread recipes. I made it exactly as written except I made two loaves and 12 muffins from the batter because I always seem to over brown the tops in order to get the middles to bake properly; it was perfect judgement. The loaves baked in one hour. I found the bread so sweet that the tops of the muffins actually sugar-crisped - glassy sweet crunch. I'll use at least half the sugar next time. I will also follow other reviewer's lead and try 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce, which a few said was a delicious way to cut the fat and calories for no loss of taste/texture.

This is the best banana bread I have ever had. Easy to prepare and has perfect moistness and texture. I could not find creme fraiche, so I used sour cream.

This is a great, sweet banana bread recipe. I like to use whole grains, so I substituted in 1 c King Arthur white whole wheat flour plus 1 c barley flour for two of the cups of white flour, and added an extra 1/2 tsp of baking soda. I also increased the oil to 1 1/4 cup and use 1/2 cup of sour cream instead of the 1/4 cup of creme fraiche. Delicious!

This is the perfect, basic banana bread recipe. I substituted some whole wheat flour to give it a little more substance and it was great. I also discovered a cool trick: a potato ricer mashes bananas beautifully! And it is so much fun to do.

This is a delicious recipe -- very moist. Be careful of cooking times. I've made this recipe at least a dozen times and each time the baking time has been different. Also make sure the banana is well mashed -- I wouldn't do "coarse" as the recipe calls for -- you'll have sections of uncooked bread.

One of my first attempts at banana bread and I was a bit intimidated by the earlier reviews re: excess dough and dark crust but it turned out great! I cooked the loaves in a convection oven and reduced the temp. by 5 degrees during the last half hour and they were perfect after 1 hour and 7 min. I didn't have quite 3 C of bananas so added 1 C of roughly chopped fresh cranberrys during final blending with the flour mixture, a good sweet and sour taste. I took one loaf to my office and it was gone in a 1/2 hour. Also, a big thanks to all who review the recipes on this site - I really appreciate your comments and suggestions!!

A very moist and wonderful banana bread. Fit perfectly in my two full sized loaf pans. Other than possibly doubling the cinnamon I would not change a thing. Delicious sliced and spread with a bit more of the creme fraiche.

Great! Very easy and tasty recipe. Use only super ripe & ugly bananas for the best aroma & flavor. Uglier is better. Save your pretty bananas. I substituted plain whole milk yogurt for the creme fraiche, resulted in a better crumb and flavor.

This banana bread was disappointing. It was moist, but certainly NOT banana-y enough. It lacked a certain gusto. I won't make it again.

My husband would give this a full 4+ because he loves banana bread so much. I think this is his favorite now. It's very good and I was careful not to over fill my small loaf pan. I halved the recipe and made 1 loaf and 4 small muffins with half the batter.

Rating: 4
Excellent & very easy! Thanks to everyone's earlier advisories about the large amount of batter, I made one (1) 9x5 loaf (about 1 hour to bake with the four mini loaves in at the same time), four (4) mini loaves (approx. 3 1/4 x 5 1/2) (about 45 minutes to bake with the larger loaf in at the same time) and 10 regular-sized muffins (baked alone for about 20-25 minutes). I also added some choc. chips to part of the batter with excellent results.

Rating: 4
Believe the positive reviews...this is excellent banana bread, probably among the best I've ever had. So much moister than any other recipe I've come across. Split the batter into one 9" loaf pan and four mini pans, and the amount of batter was perfect. To the reviewers that had trouble with burnt crust/uncooked center: make sure your ovens have undergone a complete (20 mins. +) preheat...this may help with this problem.

Very very good! Did not have the crème fraîche on hand, so it was left out- it was still delicious! I only had one loaf pan, so I poured the rest of the batter in a muffin pan- even better! Very flavorful and moist.

Absolutely amazing banana bread!! It is so light and fluffy it melts in your mouth. A caution, though. I agree with another reviewer there's too much batter for two 9"x5" pans. I used a 10" and a 9" pan and there was still a bit much. The crust browns quickly, so if the center isn't cooked all the way at an hour the crust may burn a little. It's also a little more difficult than other recipes to tell when it's done. I make a ton of banana bread and I overbaked it a little expecting my tester to come out cleaner. High marks for this recipe from a banana bread connoisseur!!

I made this today solely based on all the positive reviews -- had some ripe bananas and was looking for something easy. I halved the recipe (didn't have enuf bananas) and it fit perfectly in my small bundt, with enough left over for one mini loaf. Dusted w/confectioner's sugar b4 serving. Everyone raved! Nice banana flavor, maybe add some mini choc chips next time for the kids. Used sour cream instead of creme fraiche, pecans instead of walnuts. Will definitely make again as loaves, this is a great recipe.

This is one of the best banana bread recipes I've ever made and I've made many. The batter was dense and fluffy - different than any I've made before. I like the addition of the creme fraiche (I substituted sour cream) and it makes it a bit more moist and tangy.

I enjoyed this recipe. We eat a lot of bananas. Those that become over ripe I let ripen until they are jet black. I then peel them and stick them in a zip lock bag and store them in the freezer. I defrost them before use, this works well because the riper the bananas the more flavor.

I've been making banana bread for 34 years now and have in all this time constantly looked for the "perfect" recipe. I have just found it!!! This is perfect, very moist, wonderful flavor, cooks perfectly. If you make it in dark metal pans, reduce oven temperature by 15-25 degrees. The only addition I would make would be a few drops of imitation banana flavoring.

I was disappointed. I have a banana bread recipe that I love, but the reviews persuaded me to give this a try. I dunno, it's not as sweet nor banana-y as I like. Maybe my fruit wasn't fully ripe enough; I know that can make a difference. I will say that the texture was excellent, more like cake than a quick bread, no doubt from the 10 mins. beating of the eggs & sugar. Sent it off to the office with my partner and he just called with rave reviews from his coworkers. sigh. Note to "too much batter" reviewers: make sure you're using 9x5" pans (not 8x4").

Perfect! For those with baking issues, you may want to put an oven thermometer(if you don't already have one) in your oven to see how accurate your oven runs; most are off by a lot. I made this and it came out great -- but I did have to move the oven temp dial to 400 just to get the internal temp to a steady 350. Hope this helps. Oh, also used cream instead.

A delicious PLAIN (in the good sense) banana bread (my favorite has poppy seeds, marachino cherries). With very ripe bananas, used only 1/2 the specified sugar amount, to no detriment at all, in fact, seemed to further highlight the real banana flavor. Used ground pecans and reduced fat sour cream. Will definitely make again.

I can't seem to make enough of this recipe ! Everyone loves it! I've made it 3 times as muffins, cooking time is 20-25 min's, and I always use sour cream or yogurt instead of creme fraiche. I also add about 2T. of GrandMarnier for an extra taste. Muffins stay moist for days. I've added 2X the bananas, and once made it with blueberries. Both times different people said I'm not a muffin person but I ate one every day!

To AAA from Montreal - I had the same experience with too much batter for the recommended size of pans and almost burnt on the outside but somewhat raw on the inside. Ended up cutting away the raw portion and enjoying the rest. Will try it again but will maybe use different sized pans. Why were we the only ones with this problem?

Personally, I thought that this was mediocre banana bread, particularly considering the relatively complicated instructions (compared to other banana bread recipes). My boyfriend, a banana bread lover, was not thrilled with my loaf. I did use sour cream instead of creme fraiche, though - maybe that made the difference.

This recipe is just super! I like a nice, dense, moist, banana rich bread and this delivers. I didn't have an electric mixer so I did it by hand... I went out the other night and bought an electric mixer. I will make it again tonight. I really don't see much difference in the creme frache from sour cream, though. Nevertheless, a wonderful recipe, all my friends wanted to know how it came out so moist. I told them I must be a really good cook. Hee hee.

great results, used plain yoghurt in place of creme fraiche, and added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg. Only problem is that I forgot to bring out the eggs, so placed them in a shallow bowl and set them on a table on the sundeck. Neighbourhood crows thought this to be a splendid idea....

Manhattan... Think taste, not appearance. My grandmother handed down a banana bread tradition: never let a banana go to waste. Black bananas do not = bad. We always freeze leftover or bruised bananas, and when we collect enough, we make banana bread! Although it is not very appealing to the eye, the results are always wonderful! The key is not to let them get so bad that the gnats swarm. This would be overkill.

I loved this bread so much I decided to make a coffee cake out of it by putting chocolate chip streusel in the middle and baking in 2 fancy pans (cathedral bundt and flower shaped pan). Moist, delicious and looks so much more impressive than a loaf shape and with the same amount of work!

Thanks Vancouver, I will try again, I never thought of the flour being old or that being the problem. I really want to like this bread and everybody else seems to.

I decided to try this with modifications to make it more healthful. I've tried "lowfat" banana bread recipes and have always been disappointed, but this translated very well and I will make my own version of this again. My substitutions may be too much for some, but I did like it... I used applesauce in place of oil, whole wheat flour instead of white (it was quite dense, so maybe 50-50 would be good for most), egg substitute, splenda sweetener and almonds instead of walnuts. Very good -- much, much better than the recipes that I've tried that are designed to be lowfat or "healthy."

After buying 25 bananas to give out to the monkeys at a safari park, and then deciding not to go, I was searching for a recipe that used lots of the fruit. This called for 6 but we actually needed 7 to make 3 cups of mush. Yay! The bread it produces is good -- so moist it could really qualify as a cake. I took one cook's suggestion; since I hate finding walnuts in baked goods, I added a generous handful of chopped macadamias. They didn't add as luxurious a flavor sensation as expected -- thus, while I wouldn't necessarily suggest adding them, I'm sure they tasted better than the alternative. But one question remains about ripe bananas: Is there any such thing as TOO ripe? Some of the bananas I used were literally falling apart. Others I mashed were simply getting soft. The result was sweet and banana-y, so I guess it doesn't matter much. (But I did find myself wondering whether it was healthy to eat something so funky.)

This is now my favorite banana bread recipe. The creme fraiche was not difficult to make, you just need a few hours to let it develop. Since I used glass pans, I had to change the oven temp the last 20 minutes or so of baking to prevent overbrowning.

What a great recipe!!! I too added sour cream, and left the walnuts untoasted (for time's sake) and it was great. I pulled it out of the oven after 50 minutes, and it is wonderfully moist and delicious. The top browned a little too much, but my husband and I loved it anyway. This was a huge acomplishment since I ALWAYS overcook breads and cakes, until they have no moisture left. Definitly a keeper!!!

I usually do not mess with a recipe; but I did this time. I halved the entire recipe as I only had 3 bananas and really wanted to try this. I also substituted sour cream for the creme fraiche. It was delicious and moist and I will try the 'correct' recipe next time and compare.

I completely modified this in desperation, substituted thick cream for creme fraiche. Substituted a bit of maple sugar to the original amount. Only had four bananas, had to add more moisture somehow. Only had 3/4 of a cup of canola oil, instead melted butter to make up the quantities. Didn't put cinnamon in, because I hate it, and used toasted hazelnuts instead of walnuts. Husband said incredible, best he'd ever eaten. Moist, light, delicious. I was keen for banana bread, and improvised and it worked very well!!

I have a complaint: Why must an otherwise excellent-sounding and usable recipe contain one hard-to-find ingredient, in this case the creme fraiche, and then use only a little of it? If other people have tried this recipe, did they buy or make the creme fraiche, or did they substitute sour cream, yogurt, or buttermilk?
