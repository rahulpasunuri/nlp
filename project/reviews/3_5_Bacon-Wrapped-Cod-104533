I enjoyed this. I skipped the sauce but in retrospect I think the blandness of the fish needs the sauce. Will try a wine sauce next time. Definitely a good base dish to change things slightly until I find how I like it best. Def a keeper

I liked the idea of this dish, but it sounded a bit fussy with the rolling and securing and all. So I decided to try something based on the ingredients. I diced the bacon, cooked it, and mixed the cooked, diced bacon in with the shallots, parsley and capers. In addition to the olive oil, I added salt, pepper, and a splash of sherry vinegar. I then cooked the fillets in the rendered bacon fat (about 1-2 tablespoons). Served the fish with the herb mixture on top, and it was quite tasty. This recipe is a keeper. I'm glad I didn't pass it by.

This was easy to make and tasty. Used regular sliced bacon, hadn't had cod in awhile and this turned out beautifully. A keeper.

So easy and delicious! I used "center cut" bacon, with less fat than most, and skipped the salt on the fish. I also didn't make the sauce. I used olive oil spray in my pan, seared the bacon-wrapped cod on the stovetop, then finished in a 400 degree oven for about 15 minutes. Moist, flavorful, easy to serve. Dinner party worthy.

This was quick & easy. I didn't really pay attention to the cooking time in the recipe. I really liked the combination of flavors - tangy, smoky together with the the mellow fish. I like the other reviewers' suggestion for adding white wine to the pan & heating the sauce a bit. I will try that next time!

Very flavorful. I agree with previous reviewers to cook less time. Also, after I took the fish out of the pan, I added the chopped shallots, parsley (and I used some cilanto as well, very good), and capers and cooked for a few minutes, then deglazed with white wine. Don't need to add the 1/4 cup of oil to the sauce. Works better with a thick filet of fish.

I have made this many time for my wife and it has turned out great. The parsley and capers add freshness to the dish and i have also made it with cilantro as well.

i really didn't like it - not a good combination of flavors for me.

Despite the reviews I decided to try this recipe. The taste was great, including the sharp contrast of the sauce to the softness of the fish, but I had a difficult time assembling the dish. Here are my recommendations and my tips for trying this dish: Purchase a good quality sliced slab bacon. This is crucial to assembling because it needs to wrap the fish and stay wrapped during turning/cooking. Take the advice of other reviewers and monitor the cooking time. I purchased 2 1lb fillets and they were large once wrapped, they took about 10 minutes to cook. Consider browning the bacon but it isn't absolutely necessary since you brown it when you brown the wrapped cod at the beginning of cooking it. With all this, I have still saved the recipe and will try it again, paying special attention to assembling the dish so that it stays together once cooking.

My boyfriend and I loved this dish. Like the others who commented, the cooking time in the recipe is way too long. Brown the bacon a bit, then cook for maybe 7 minutes, if that. I am not a fan of parsley so I substituted cilantro for the sauce and processed it in a mini food processor. It made like a pesto and for me, it really made the dish. My boyfriend liked it best without the sauce (which I put on the side for dipping)

Cooking time is too long. Fish became overly dry. I would suggest reducing total cooking time by about ten minutes. Perhaps finishing in moderate oven instead of on stove top would improve this dish.

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe a lot. We left out the capers, though, because we don't like them. The taste was very good without them. I added a little garlic powder to the fish, along with the salt and pepper. Yummy. I'll surely make this again!

Could not put a fork to this recipe---my husband hated it. Consequently, I ate "the whole thing". I think the amount of capers in the sauce overpowered the dish. With so many wonderful recipes out there to try, I wouldn't even bother to repeat with alterations to the sauce. Maybe the cod wrapped in bacon alone would have been OK??? Tsk, tsk.

I chose this recipe to prepare for my family, who are not big fish fans, because it sounded quick and easy and different. It was all of those things and a great success, too. Even my son, who really dislikes fish, ate up every bite. I reduced the final cooking time for the fish by half. I didn't feel that a fish like cod would need 16 minutes. Also, after I removed the fatty juices from the pan, I deglazed the pan with some dry white wine and added that to the sauce. I will definitely serve this again.
