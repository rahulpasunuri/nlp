I've made these sandwiches a number of times and usually pair them with a squash or roasted winter vegetable soup. They are delicious, very easy to throw together for last minute guests or a simple family supper, and they always get raves!

A friend served these at a casual dinner party with a Brunswick Stew. Absolutely wonderful--everyone raved. I can wait to make them for myself. She had to make a substitution for the watercress, but she found a reddish-green lettuce (not curly leaf) that worked just fine.
