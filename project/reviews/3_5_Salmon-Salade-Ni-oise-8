An absolutely perfect salad! As an arranged salad, it makes for a beautiful presentation - a lovely combination of colors and textures. The second time I made it, I cubed thick salmon fillets, and sautéed them in olive oil. This made the salad easier to serve. I've also tried grilling the potatoes and beans, which added another layer of flavor.

Made a wonderful lunch. I wasn't able to get to the store so I used dried tarragon. We caught the salmon ourselves just days ago and used our farm fresh eggs so the dressing wasn't as important. Delish!

Probably one of the best main course salads i have ever made, and i used boring chicken instead of salmon because its what i had around  bet its even better with salmon! and i love the dressing  not too tart and fine with dried tarragon, tho i am sure fresh is even better.

I make this dish with New Zealand moimoi potatoes and a lemon mayonaise and it comes out awsome, try poaching the salmon in white wine and garlic

This is a good summer dinner, though I agree that the dressing needs work. Next time I will cut the Dijon mustard by 50%, as its flavor dominated the salad. I agree that fresh tarragon makes the dressing more interesting. I used leftover teriyaki salmon, which actually worked with the French flavors.

Although this salad was quite attractive, my Hubby & I did not care for it...We thought the vinaigrette was too tart, even after adding 1/2 teaspoon of honey...

This was pretty fabulous. I used leftover grilled salmon and used fresh tarragon in the dressing.

A delicious salad that was a great use for our leftover grilled Salmon. Makes me hungry just thinking about it.

Used leftover salmon from the grill -- perfect for the 'day 2' of a large piece of salmon. I added a little sugar to the dressing because it tasted too tart to me, but it could have just been that I had really large lemons! My non salad-eater husband LOVED this!

This was delicious! My whole family ate it up. The dressing is perfect. Slight change, I poached the salmon in white wine with fresh tarragon & lemon slices.

Really light but still filling! My parents ate it all up. I used fresh tarragon instead of dried, and ripped up the romain leaves instead of putting them on the plate whole. Much more eater-friendly. I also added a little honey to the dressing which was delicious!

This salad is a gourmet's delight. It is extremely satisfying as well as a beautiful presentation. One can alter the ingredients to fit a specific diet but the dressing is the key to it all. Absolutely a MUST TRY

I think the dressing is the key. I also used asparagus. It was so good, my husband wanted it the next day as well. I substituted a few mushrooms for the eggs, to be heart healthy. I found that moving the water to a smaller pot made it easier to get it deep enough for the potatoes and green beans. Good the next year as well, even with lowly green beans instead of asparagus

This was wonderful. I used fresh tarragon and a scant 1/4 cup olive oil.

Great refreshing salad. I used asparagus instead of green beans. The dressing was wonderful. It sounds like a light meal - however, our plates were heavy and we were full at the end of the meal!

I've made variants of this dish many times since first trying it, and can't get enough. I ended up broiling the salmon and surrounding it with the other ingredients. The vinaigrette really makes it, and can be used with any similar salad, such as diced chicken with potatoes, egg, tomatoes, etc.
