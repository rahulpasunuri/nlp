I buy and eat tofu because I know that it's good for me, not because it has any gourmet tendencies; just healthy. I substituted cilantro for the mint too and put everything into a grilling basket for great ease of turning. Next time I'll slice the green onions in half lengthwise (they get tough and stringy in cooking) and add some sunflower seeds for texture.

This recipe has become a weeknight staple during the summer. The only thing I change is how its served- I find the pitas become soggy and fall apart when I try to stuff them. Alternatively, I cut the pitas into strips and toss them with the tofu and veges and serve it all as a salad. Delicious!

I changed the recipe a bit, according to what I had in the fridge. This recipe is very versatile! I used cilantro instead of mint and cheddar and jack instead of feta. This made a different sandwich than this recipe, but worked well. I also added some grilled broccoli for crunchiness. Works fine on a grill pan! Use what ingrediants you have!!!

Didn't have a grill ready, so I diced the veggies and tofu ahead of time and stir-fried them quickly in a bit of olive oil. Turned out great! The feta and peppers togeather are wonderful.

This was my first experience with tofu. I expected it to be so-so at best, but this recipe was very good. I will definitely make it again.
