Decent flavor but never thickened up as I wanted it to, was very liquidy, too much water in recipe I suspect. And I let it cook down quite a bit longer than called for.

Save ourself some time and reduce the amount of water in this recipe. The reason it does not thicken is that it requires 1 Tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken one cup of fluid. My guess is that you could easily get away with only one cup but I have not actually tried it. It is also unusual to add the cornstarch at the beginning of the cooking time. It might be more effective to add it mixed with a bit of water towards the end and stir until thickened.

Not impressed. Average at best. The sauce thickened, but it took a while. I was hoping for exceptional and felt let down. The sauce needs to be rewarmed as well because it sets up a little like jelly when it chills.

this sauce was great over everything...pancakes, ice cream, fresh fruit, poundcake, and especially plain or vanilla yogurt. went over very well at a dinner party i had.

The sauce never thickened up. I even added additional cornstarch once it was obvious that the sauce was like water, but it was too late. I won't make this again.

I love blueberries in any way, shape, or form. Honestly, I haven't made this one yet but I HAVE "put up" blueberry preserves. I'll experiment to see if this can be "preserved" to keep the room temperature aspect of serving. Time to get more Kerr lid inserts! Hmmmmm.... yummy.

I have made this twice with organic blueberries and Splenda (cutting down on the carbs). It's fantasic mixed with homemade plain (unsweetened)yogurt, vanilla ice cream or on waffles. I encourage you to try it!
