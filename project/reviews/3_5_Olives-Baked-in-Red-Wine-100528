I agree with the reviewer(s) who said this didn't taste much different from just eating the plain olives, and I even doubled the garlic and fennel. The remainder is sitting in my fridge, and I do wonder if having marinated for a few days, there will be a new blast of flavor. Either way the whole thing will go into a homemade marinara sauce tonight. At least there's always a way to use stuff up.

Very simple to make, everyone at my dinner party enjoyed the olives, good addition to a tapas menu.

I made one slight modification, which was to not include the fennel seeds. Apart from that change, I made it exactly as written, and it was absolutely fabulous. My guests loved it and commented on how much better it is than eating regular kalamata's. I'd definitely recommend this recipe to others looking for something great to add to their appetizer selection.

This wasn't much better than the olives alone: it just didn't add much to the already very strong flavor, and based on previous reviews, I expected more. There also was very little liquid left to sop up with bread, which I had been looking forward to. I served these as part of a cocktail buffet, and they were nibbled at but largely ignored.

Delicious! Add a bit more fennel seeds and bruise them in a coffee/spice grinder. I made them 2 days before, warmed them in the oven, and drizzled the still-warm olives with a fruity olive oil for serving.

this is a very traditional tapas dish, and quite authentic. i increased the garlic and found that it was tasty - but interfered a bit with the fennel. it should be served in shallow bowl (along with cheese plate and other small dishes)with a crusty baguette so that the liquid can sopped up and eaten (what a shame to drain the olives). in spain it's likely that a bit of high quality olive oil would be drizzled across the dish when served to give the liquid a silkier feel when dipping the bread.

We made this the night before and let the flavors develop. We tried both pitted and unpitted - the pitted were OK, but not great. Unpitted Kalamata olives seemed to make a difference. We tried pureeing the sauce, but ended up serving just the olives (after fishing them out of the sauce/marinade). A fresh take on the usual olives - it's true that they're good with the cheese plate.

A really nice, simple way to "dress up" olives when you don't want to just serve them plain. It was subtle, but when a dish is this easy, I'm not usually looking for major impact. It made the olives more mellow, and almost richer. Good as an accompaniment to a cheese plate.

I don't care for olives...but this was a great recipe...Everyone loved them...I tripled the recipe, and after baking, I strained the olives before serving them...

Itis always a hit at my dinner parties. Try more of everything - it just keeps getting better - also try and make a day before and reheat when serving.

This recipe is good, but the wine, fennel seed flavor isn't so profound that it tastes any different than regular kalamata olives--so why go through all the effort?

This is a great recipe, but when I first made it and took it out of the oven, I wasn't sure how people would be able to eat it, since the sauce is quite loose. So I pureed it, adding the sauce in until I got the consistency I wanted. It was a huge sucess and I have been asked to bring it to parties ever since. Serve with breadsticks for dipping.

Wonderful dish to serve friends at the bar - baguette and gogonzola cheese, a glass of wine heaven

This sounds tasty...and messy, so how does one serve it? Suggestions appreciated. Thank you.

The flavor is delicious. It's unusual to have the olives in a sauce, rather than just in its brine.

These are great! Perfect with Cambezola (or any strong cheese), red wine and crusty bread. So easy, but a special way to serve the ever-present olives.
