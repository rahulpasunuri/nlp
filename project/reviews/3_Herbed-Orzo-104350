Really bland. Needed more lemon juice, and lots of fresh herbs would've helped, with salt & fresh cracked black pepper.

Simple side dish, nice alternative to rice. Definitely need fresh herbs, plenty of them and easy on the lemon. Serve with saucy entree perfect.

Pretty good.. a nice change from rice pilaf or potatoes. I added a bunch of garlic salt though, and I think fresh herbs would really make a difference.

I think this is the first recipe on this site that forces me to disagree with the previous reviewers. Maybe I messed it up, but I think I followed it exactly. I found it to be very bland and unexciting, and I even used some of my precious $35 a bottle olive oil. The only thing that saved it was the cheese sauce from my accompanying vegetable dish. I think that there are enough other orzo recipes out there that I won't have to make this one again.

I used chives and thyme and the juice from a whole lemon, instead of just half. Tasty.

Yum. Added mint with the herbs and threw in some feta.

Half of this recipe is enough for four as a side dish with dinner. Adding more herbs is a matter of taste. Next time I will add more.

I make a different version of this, using a recipe from a Molly Katzen cookbook. It calls for LOTS more herbs (like one CUP), which makes it a wonderful dish. I know, it sounds like too much, but it really is good. Include some green onion, and you'll have plenty of flavor.

Very good, light tasting and easy. I make this often with different kinds of pastas and some parmesan cheese. I sometimes use butter instead of olive oil too. A nice way to use fresh herbs (basil is a good addition too).

very easy to prepare and enjoyed it as a light accompaniment to any main dish...

This really needs the addition of something with a bit of punch....I added feta but parmesan would be good as well, or perhaps some garlic. It is fine for a weekday dinner but not for entertaining.

Very easy to prepare and I used it as an accompaniment to Chicken With Roasted Pepper-Garlic Sauce (this site), which is fabulous! Good basic orzo recipe. KIMBER

So easy, yet tastes great, makes a nice side dish for chicken.
