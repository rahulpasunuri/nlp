Good overall, and the sauce was tasty. I needed to thin it down with a little cider though to make it more 'dippable'.

I recently made this dish for a new years eve cocktail party we hosted. My husband and I ate ALL of them truly so it's not fair to say that our guests didn't like them!!! It was definitely a little time consuming to prepare but the chutney was delicious. We will definitely make this again. Great finger food fun...

Good recipe. Fairly simple, nice presentation. The sauces was great--I felt it could have used more heat, but that's an individual taste. Also, while butterflying the shrimp may add some time, it's worth it for the ease of cooking and presentation. They look great butterflied. I used frozen, raw shrimp (20-25/lb) that had already been deveined and had been mostly shelled (only had the tails left on.) I removed the remaining tail shell and quickly butterflied. I marinated them overnight and then put on skewers.

I actually made the recipe as directed. The only change I made was grilling the shrimp without butterflying them (I used medium sized shrimp, or prawns, as we call them in California). I served them hot from the grill in my garden for appetizers and they were a hit with my friends. I am now e-mailing them the recipe, at their request. This was a very easy recipe with minimal work involved, another plus.

The sauce is very good- I think it would go great with a spicy meat- I have tons left over and Im going to try it with jamaican jerk kabobs. I used precooked shrimp and just heated in the broiler, so they came out kind of bland, but my guests loved them, so I guess it worked. I'd try grilling the shrimp next time, and make the marinade a bit spicy.

I love this dish! Of course, I did change a few things. First, I did not make this as an appetizer - I made it as an entree. I skewered the shrimp w/out butterflying them - I also, skewered slices of yellow squash & zucchini with cherry tomatoes - plus a seperate skewer of small yellow onions quartered (I did the onions seperate from the other veggies because they take longer to cook). I broiled the veggies and shrimp (start onions first, then the other veggies, and the shrimp last) and then served them over basmati rice w/ the chutney on top. I also changed the chutney by: 1. Not toasting the pistachios or grinding them up too finely. 2. Not bothering to drain the yogurt. 3. Reduced the amount of yogurt by half and added 1/2 cup of Breckstones 1/3 less fat sour cream. 4. Only added 2 jalapeno peppers. 5. Increased the amount of cumin to 2 teaspoons. - Everyone I have cooked this for has thought it was to die for.

Loved the shrimp marinade. Like a previous reviewer, I put them on the bbq grill and they were delicious. However, the chutney was just so-so to me. The cilantro came through more than any other ingredient. I also made a mustard-based sauce I liked much better with the shrimp (creole mustard, cayenne pepper, onions, green onions, tarragon vinegar, paprika).

I'll make this again, but with some changes. Next time I will not toast the pistachios, and will put in less jalapeno, as it just seemed to add heat and not flavor. My guests liked the chutney though, and I'll use it on other things in the future.

The chutney is great! I did two things differently - left out the olive oil (by accident) and didn't grind the pistachios finely (did this on purpose to leave a bit of texture) - and still loved it. It would be good on chicken, other fishes, etc. I made a much smaller version of the recipe so just grilled the shrimp in a grill pan instead of the broiler. Definately will have again.

I was looking for a simple grilled shrimp recipe and came across this one. I was hesitant at first to make this recipe because of the chutney (I've never made chutney before) but the recipe turned out extremely well. Instead of broiling the shrimp and making them as hors d'oeuvres, I had 4 shrimps to a skewer, grilled them, and served them on a bed of white rice with the chutney over the shrimp. I was very suprised how easy the recipe was and it was delicious!
