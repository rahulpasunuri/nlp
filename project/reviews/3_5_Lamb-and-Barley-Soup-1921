This stew is to die for!!! Made a few modifications to make it even healthier - as suggested did strain broth, cool and skim fat; also used organic lamb, and beef broth (instead of water) and one cube of All Vegetable Beef Style Boullion (no msg or articifical color/flavors) Sauteed thyme and onions in 2 tbsp of olive oil and cooked on medium heat, then added broth and lamb and barley and cooked for an hour. Added remaining vegies plus 2/3 c. peas and cooked for an additional 1/2 hour. My guess is that some bergundy would be a wonderful addition to the recipe as well. Unbeleivably delicious!

It reminds me of Campbell's Scotch Broth. Quite tasty though.

Delicous soup. I seared the lamb on leftover grill heat (less messy than doing it on the stove), made a lamb stock (sans boullion), and then took the meat off the bones and continued with the soup. The proportions were great! I got the brothy soup I was looking for (I was afraid it would be more stew-like). Rich-tasting without being heavy. One of the best soups I've made.

Wonderful soup. My 5 & 8 loved it. Made broth 1st, then removed bones and added barley. When barley was almost done added meat and veggies. Yummy

Followed the recipe except used 2 lamb shanks and Swanson's beef broth. Absolutely excellent. Did not dilute when it got thick and served as a stew instead of soup.

This is soooooooooooooooooooo good. The only changes I made are 1) I browned the vegetables after browning the lamb 2) I used half lamb shoulder and half neckbones and diced the shoulder, so that each ladle of soup contained some meat.

Delicious and adaptable. I left out the barley, added celery, carrots, and three medium-small potatoes. I broiled the fat off of lamb necks and shanks. I added a rich red wine to compensate for the flavor lost with the fat. Salted and peppered to taste. It's a keeper.

I left out the cabbage, rutbaga and barley to simplify and used the leg of lamb roasted with rosemary and garlic in epicurious. It was the best soup ever!!! Rich, tasty and because I had a great piece of lamb, there was hardly no fat to skim and clarify. It smelled so good we ate it straight from the pot!!

My mother used to make lamb and barley soup when I was a girl. I chop the root vegetables very finely and they basically disappear during the cooking time, then I add more when I add the barley. I do brown the meat first and add lamb stew meat and cut out some of the bones, browning the bones and meat well for more flavor/less fat. The greens seem superflous to me. I use carrots/onions/celery.

Here's a tip: broil the lamb first on 5 minutes each side, a lot of the fat will burn/drip off and omit the oil! While it's broiling, you can saute the onions w/ cooking spray. I didn't know how my veggies would be nothing but tasteless mush if I added everything up front. so just simmered the lamb for an hour, then added barley and veggies for last half hour. also added some peas and it was a yummy stew.

Wonderful soup. I also made the lamb broth first. Lots of chopping, but with the food processor it was a breeze. My soup also came out thick and I added red wine and more broth. Definitely serves more than 8.

Delicious. This soup is a wonderful winter warmer. I took Jaz from San Francisco suggestion of cooking the broth first. I'm glad I did as the lamb neck bones were very fatty, I would hate to think what it would have tasted like if I hadn't pre-cooked the broth. I substituted the cabbage for spinach and added a little more stock as the soup was very thick. Will be making again in the not too distant future

WONDERFUL! Very rich and thick. One thing though that I would suggest - make the lamb broth FIRST, skimming off the foam as it cooks, then cool, train, de-fat, and pick the lamb off the bones. Yes, this adds some time, but the result is well worth it. The soup is extremely rich tasting without being heavy or greasy. I actually used a combination of neck bones and leftover bones from the lamb chops we had had earlier in the week. FYI - 3 tablespoons of beef bouillon is about 8 or 9 cubes of the pre-wrapped stuff. Also, although this may seem obvious (NOTHING is obvious to me!!!), be sure to salt and pepper at the end to even out the taste. Adding extra bouillon cubes is NOT the same as salting it (ahhh, the voice of experience...ha ha ha!). This reheats well, and freezes well too. Definitely comfort food!!!
