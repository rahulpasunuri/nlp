Wow. This was absolutely delicious and went well with our old fashioneds ;) too bad we didn't have any more mint for some mint juleps. Either way, we used a filet minion vs pork and couldn't have asked for anything better!

This was quite easy to make and very good - with one modification. We used bone-in pork chops and seared them in the pan first. Then put them in the oven at a low temp for 2 hours. I think they would have been even better if we had left them to cook for another hour. Otherwise, the recipe is quite good.

Quick and easy to make and absolutely delicious!! Easy enough for a novice like myself to cook.

sorry everybody, but I have to go against the tide on this one. Did not like the flavor profile at all, the chops were hard and almost inedible, the only saving grace were the crisp sweet peas. I even added extra butter, but it didn't help.

I absolutely loved these! The only thing I did differently was add a little butter to the glaze at the end, but honestly, it probably didn't need it. Next time, I will try with asparagus.

Given the ease and outcome of this recipe, it is a definite keeper! Next time, I would add more mint (almost double) and reduce the glaze for longer, possibly even transferring it to a saucepan to reduce

I loved the sauce, but would double it next time. My family is a little "iffy" on mint, so I made some of the sauce without... which was still a very big hit. However, my husband only gave it a 6 (on a 0-10 scale) so I will make again only for myself and kids.

We made this dish to the T. We have tried this dish 2 times. The first time -- the flavor was surprisingly and good. The second time we were less impressed. The pork fell flat and was outshined by sugar snap peas. If pork is outshined by sugar snap peas, what does that tell you? We would try this again but we would brine the pork first. If you haven't tried brined pork ... try it, you will never go back.

This is really good stuff. I made it as written for the most part and I have to say I think the snap peas are perfect - hard to imagine another vegetable being as good. I was plating the chops and realized I still had the mint on my cutting board, so I just chopped it fine and sprinkled on top. I think I might use this method again as I liked the fresh taste of the uncooked mint.

Oooohh my - this sauce is amazing! and versatile. I was doing a kitchen sink dinner (ie, things we have on hand)- I roasted radishes instead of peas and used the full recipe for sauce to simmer down for about 40 min? (kept the chops warm in the oven with the radishes) - Amazing! So so good, I was trying to be economical and I don't know that I've ever had a better chops meal anywhere.

This is amazing!!! I used extra thick pork chops from Whole Foods, seared them for about 4 mins each side, then put in the oven @ 375 for about 10 mins. They were cooked perfectly! Everything else I followed the recipe. Delicious! The perfect Derby dinner! Will definitely make again!

OMG this is soooo gooooood! I used high quality bourbon, and it was great. Lots of swooning around a table full of people who love to eat and know how to cook. Don't skip the mint. It totally makes the dish.

This recipe, discovered by advance-search for anything using some orphaned sugar snap peas, woke up a sooty, middling winter day! I didn't have any bourbon, but rum worked nicely. I confess, I also left out the mint! But the simple little sauce prepared in this simple way was just delightful. In spring, when the mint is young and plentiful (and free!) I'll use mint.

A fabulous dish that comes together in under 20 minutes! I will make this again and again. I served baked sweet potatoes alongside which I thought echoed the southern theme of this meal. A true winner!!!

I made this recipe as written. The glaze was excellent, but I really didn't care for the snap peas - although they make for a nice presentation. Next time I'll omit them and serve a green vegetable on the side. I also think that I'd like to try this with pork tenderloin.

I ommitted the bourbon from the recipe. Since I was serving this dish to my teenage children, I thought I had better leave the bouron out. Then I served the chops and peas with garlic mashed potatoes and used some of the leftover mint glaze as gravy on the potatoes. I will definately make this again.

I too thought this was a very tasty meal, especially considering the ease of it. One thing that can make this dish "bitter" would be to over chop the mint and add it to the glaze too soon. Mint has a lot of volatile oils (the stuff that gives the herb its scent). Over chopping releases these volatile oils and leaves you with more of the bitter properties. That's why I'd recommend lightly chopping the herb and doing so right before you want to add it to the glaze. Not cooking off the alcohol in the bourbon added at the end could also make the dish seem "bitter", especially if you don't like the taste of alcohol.

Seriously....20 minutes for amazing heaven! i only had boneless chops. i used maker's mark. the sauce was perfectly sweet and amazing. i was hesitant about that much mint and so i strained out the leaves. we ended up putting all the mint leaves back on the chops and wishing there were more. i could eat this every week. also, it was so easy to make it was unnerving. WOW

This recipe has converted me, a grand-daughter of cattle-ranchers, over to The Pork Side. Seriously, I made my first pork chop ever with these instructions, and it was DELICIOUS. the sauce was INSANELY GOOD, and it came with a vegetable to boot. And, it was FAST. I will be eating this again (and again).

We licked the plate clean. The sauce was unbelievably good and at the same time unusual. I am not a fan of allspice so I used it sparingly. To the reviewers who complained of the sauce being bitter, try using a better grade of bourbon next time. This is definitely a keeper and a must do again.

I found this to be a wonderful sauce that really did taste like a mint julep! Don't know how one would find the glaze bitter, I too thought the bourbon brought a nice added sweetness. But best of all was how different it was from what I usually make, probably the first time I haven't used onions or garlic in a dish! Served with mashed red potatoes with a couple yams thrown in. I can see this glaze being used over chicken as well as flank steak.

This was really easy and very good. However, the mint seemed too much at the end: I pushed it to the side of the pan and just took the sauce, lest the plating of the lovely browned pork chops and bright green snow peas be sullied by clumps of brown looking leaves. Serving with potatoes was fine, but as I was eating, I felt maybe a rice pilaf might serve better. Will definitely make again.

This was so easy and delicious. I used fresh snow peas and mint from the garden. Can't understand the comment about the bourbon adding a bitter flavor. I used decent bourbon (Maker's Mark) and is actually added some sweetness. A very special quick meal.

Awesome & easy. The sauce was not bitter in my case. I messed it up in a couple ways and it still tasted great.

Rating: 4
Very tasty. I would recommended doubling the amount of peas, but that is just because I love veggies. The meat was very tender and the fresh mint is delicious.

I cannot understand the rave reviews for this horrid sauce. Neither of us could tolerate the bitter flavor of the bourbon in the sauce. I wouldn't waste good quality pork chops with this recipe. Fortunately I tasted the sauce before ruining the protein.

My husband just loved the glaze with the succulent pork. I made it with extra thick boneless chops. So after browning them in the skillet, I placed them in another skillet with a little extra butter (1 tsp.) and finished them in a 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes. I finished the rest of the recipe in the skillet that I originally browned the chops in, but increased the amount of peas. Simple a great dish!!!

I'm not a huge fan of Pork, but this recipe was really yummy!

This recipe is AMAZING! I used thick, center-cut chops & an entire can of beef broth. I just simmered the pork in the broth & burbon sauce until it was done, then finished up the sauce. My sugar snaps were frozen, so I zapped them in the microwave, put the pork & peas on a bed of jasmine rice, then poured the sauce over all. The taste was phenomenol!

This was so delicious for how fast it came together. I think it took less than 15 minutes start to finish. I forgot the mint, but it tasted great anyway. Definitely adding this in to the regular rotation.

I made this recipe for St.Pat's because my b/f hates corned beef. It was so quick and easy, but the end results were exceptional. I used chicken broth with a glug of worcheister instead of beef broth (had none) and left out the mint. The pork with the allspice was wonderful, but the glaze!...The glaze would make boiled shoe leather taste good. I can't wait to use the leftover glaze on some shrimp tomorrow!

Easy to make and the sauce was a big hit.

I was not a fan of pork chops until I prepared them using this recipe! The chops turned out succulent, sweet and savory. The only suggestion I have is to cook the chops a bit longer than the recipe calls for. I actually ended up broiling them at 500 for 3 min after I had pan sauteed them. In addition, they are wonderful when placed atop a bed of Jazmin rice.

This was fairly easy to make. The flavor was very nice and it was definitely a hit with my fiance. I, too, did not have any mint when I made this recipe, but I look forward to trying it the next time I make this.

Wonderful. Even better the second day. Few minor changes because it is what I had on hand. Used chicken broth instead of beef. Cinnamon in place of allspice. Completely forgot the mint but didn't miss it...not a big fan unless it's in a mojito. Made double the sauce which more than doubled the time to reduce. Will most definitely add to the menu list as a regular dish.

I too try this dish but with my mother and the one thing I love about taste is:eating and then after you have that sweet aftertaste i give this dish a total of 4 points!

This recipe is delicious, and so quick and easy to make! I too would use extra sugar snap peas, enough for two full veg. servings. I served corn bread muffins on the side and it paired well - sweet potatoes sound great, too - anything to complement the sweetness in the yummy glaze!

I made this tonight and it turned out excellent. I doubled the recipe and the pork was done just right. Next time i wouldn't double the amount of sugar peas. The glaze makes this dish!

I used a pork tenderloin, browned it just as you would the chops and put it in the oven at 425 for about 25 mins. I served this with mashed potatoes and threw the peas in the potato water for a couple minutes. I drained the peas and finished them in the browning pan, plopped in my warming drawer until ready. I made the sauce in the same pan but doubled it. Really fast, yummy winter dinner.

So delicious and quick. I made it with a puree of sweet potatoes and regular potatoes, which was the perfect accompaniment.
