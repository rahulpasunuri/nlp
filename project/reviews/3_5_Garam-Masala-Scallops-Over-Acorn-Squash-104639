We enjoyed this but had some complaints - husband thought too much lime juice made it too sour and I didn't care for the thick sauce. We'll make a version of this again - probably with 1/2 stock, 1/2 cream and fresh lime wedges to squeeze on top instead of the last bit of lime added.

SOO GOOD! I didn't have a jalepeno. I didn't have heavy cream so I substituted coconut milk. From the other reviews it seems that is the way to go. I also used a delicata instead of butternut squash. Served the whole thing over quinoa, sprinkled with a bit of shredded coconut and it was delicious!

My husband made this for friends, thinking it would be fun and different. It was different! But not at all our favorite. The flavor combination was strange and did not really complement well. It was ok that night, but the leftovers were just terrible.

The flavour combo did not work at all. It tasted down right off and I had used the freshest scallops around. I also followed the recipe exactly. I would not make this again.

This was fantastic! I roasted the squash with butter as recommended at the end of the recipe, used coconut milk instead of the cream, and cut down on the jalapeno, and it was amazing! I served it with jasmine rice and green beans. The whole famliy loved it!

Made this for dinner last night. I used 1 T. of Penzey's dried ginger (didn't have fresh on hand), left out the jalapeno (again, didn't have one) and used coconut milk as recommended from previous reviews. I also finely chopped about 1/2 teaspoon of lime zest and added it to the 1T. of lime juice. FANTASTIC! My guests loved it, too. Will definitely make again.

Delicious recipe. I substituted light coconut milk (Trader Joe's) and added 1 julienned orange pepper. Absolutely scrumptious. The cilantro garnish really makes it special.

Great recipe! For a lower fat version you can substitute 2 tsp of grapeseed oil for the veg oil, and fat-free evaporated milk for the cream. We had grilled asparagus tossed in balsamic vinegar as the side and paired it with an apricot fruit wine, so delicious!

I roasted the squash, and used the coconut milk (light) substitute as recommended by anoher reviewer. I also cut back on the jalapeno because my spouse doesn't like super-spicy food. The other change I made was to strain the sauce through a sieve before serving. That way, the sauce was flavorful, but we didn't have to deal with "spice bits". Delicious! I will make the sauce to serve on other mild white fish.

Delicious! But, I didn't have jalepenos, no limes, no heavy cream, no cilantro. So, I used coconut milk, a bit of syracha, and meyer lemon juice. It turned out wonderfully, and I will definitely make it again. The "gravy" is fantastic, we were practically licking our plates!

This has to be one of the best recipes I have made from this site. The flavors are perfectly balanced and it's a great presentation. I did not change a thing. I would add the cilantro as a garnish. Very rich.

I frequently make this recipe because my boyfriend loves it. Because of lactose issues, I substitute coconut milk for the cream. As others suggested, I serve the scallops and "gravy" in the halved squash. Wonderful recipe, thanks!

This recipe is wonderful. The flavor is bold and very complex. The sweetness of the acorn squash is a great base note to the aromatics and hot peppers. I did however after making this many times change a few things to my taste. First, to reduce the fat without sacrificing flavor I substituted coconut milk for the heavy cream. In my opinion this actually tastes better than cream! Secondly, I used two teaspoons less lime juice. I find it became slightly too acidic otherwise. Overall a real keeper.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but this did not turn out well. It smelled so good when cooking but the end result was lacking a savory depth. The process was enjoyable however.

Very overpowering for delicate scallops. Tasted OK but would use it for maybe chicken breast.

Impressive dish, but I made a few mistakes. Roasted the squash too long and it was mushy. Also, I tried to reduce the fat my using half and half. I think it would have been fine, but the lime juice caused it to break up and curdle a little. Flavors were good though.

This is one of my favorite recipes. It is so easy to prepare, but tastes like a lot of work :) I have made it with chicken, scallops, and shrimp. All are very delicious!

Made this for my husband for Valentine's Day. He's originally from India - and was leaving for the subcontinent in a few days. We both enjoyed it. I used sweet potatoes rather than the acorn squash simply because we like the flavor better. A keeper - and it came together quite quickly, too.

My boyfriend is allergic to shell fish so I made this recipe with chicken. I also left out the chili b/c he isn't much of one for spicy foods. It was amazingly delicious and will always be a favorite in my recipe box!

I don't know if this is an authentic Indian recipe in terms of the ingredients (acorn squash?), but the flavors with the garam masala, garlic, ginger and turmeric certainly are! When I found this recipe I thought I had a can of lite coconut milk at home, intending to use it instead of heavy cream. But then, that can I thought was on my shelf in fact, was long gone! Not to worry, a 14 ounce can of diced tomatoes was a fantastic impromptu subsitute, and unequivocally healthy to boot! Can't wait to try this with cocunut milk, but just know that you can take the dish in a totally different direction and still blow their socks off! I also cooked the entire squash, halved cut side down in vegetable oil, and cooked a pound of mahi mahi to get four servings instead of just two. Fabulous dinner with plenty of sauce and I can't wait to have the scallops for lunch today!

This was something I normally wouldn't eat but I loved it. I was a little disappointed that the sauce completely overpowered the taste of the scallops though, next time I'll go easy on the spices.

I thought this was good, but I think it has the potential to be better. Based on other reviewers' comments, I think that I'll roast the squash next time for some added flavor. I agree with others that this is easy and the results are very elegant. My husband loved it.

this is a very elegant and delicius recipe. I did not change anything. Everytime I have special guests I serve it and I know they will ask for the recipe.

I thought this dish was wonderful and super easy to prepare. I did however, use sweet potatoes rather than acorn squash (which would sweeten it up a bit; see other reviews) as I had them in the freezer and they worked beautifully. I might recommend to serve over Jasmine rice to soak up the yummy sauce. Also, if making the accompanying haricot verts, I used sweetened coconut rather than unsweetened and it was the perfect balance of savory/sweet.

I did the following: carmelized the squash and served the scallops and sauce in each half of the squash. I thought the amount of lime juice made it a bit too tart, so next time I will cut back on the amount. I think this makes a nice side dish for two.

This dish was delicious and if someone with my limited culinary skills can prepare, anyone can. I followed the advice of others and served the squash in halves rather than quarters--it was not too much.

My husband and I made this for dinner last night and loved it! We will be making again - for company. Just the right amount of heat.

I served this for a special dinner and liked it, but thought it needed a hint of sweetening. I will make it again, but will add a touch of brown sugar and butter to the squash. I made the sauce and cooked the squash the day before. It came together fairly easily for an after work dinner party.

I have made this recipe again and again for family and friends. As I am lactose intolerant I substitute coconut cream for the usual heavy cream and it works well!!

I have now made this several times and it is consistently outstanding. I roast the squash cut side down in a dab of butter which almost caramelizes it and I utilize an entire half of squash to hold the scallops. I also use light cream to save my coronaries and a sprinkle of sugar to emphasize the scallop flavor. It is different and successful. A bright viognier goes nicely.

Apparently I did something wrong. The sauce curddled and I threw it out. Yuck! I was able to salvage the scallops, thankfully. Threw out the recipe as well.

A wonderfully colorful and very tasty dish. Also, easy to make.

I've made this dish several times and its totally warm and yummy. I've had the best results when I've followed everything except I omit the jalepeno. Be very careful not to add too much tumeric. I'd also use the whole squash since it melts right in with the scallops and what are you going to do with half a squash laying around your refrigerator?

This was a strange recipe. I was too heavy handed with the red pepper flakes I used instead of jalapenos. Other than that it seemed really delicious at first but became increasingly more cloying as I continued. My husband and I both decided by the end of the meal that we really did not want to eat this again. Perhaps if I cut back on the garam masala? Sometime when I a brave perhaps I'll give it another try.

This recipe is wonderful. It is easy to make, fast and has a great curry flavor without overpowering the scallops. I used light cream instead of heavy cream to save a few calories and it was fine. My only suggestion is that you scopp the pulp from the squash out of the shell after you cook itbefore you spoon on the scallops because the shell gets in the way when you eat it. Get Garam Masala at the local Indian food store. A good sweet spice mixture with cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and who knows what.

Wonderful - my boyfriend, raised on Indian cooking, particularly enjoyed it. I added a bit 1/4 - 1/2 tsp of sugar to the sauce to balance the acidity of the lime, resulting in, in my humble opinion, a wonderfully savory sauce. Tossed parboiled french ( small green) beans when finishing the scallops and sprinkled a bit of (salted) butter on the squash before assembly.

Made this for Valentine's Day dinner and my husband loved it. I used pre-packaged garam masala from an Indian grocery with excellent results. Next time, I will use 2-3 jalapenos, as there was very little heat to the dish, perhaps because of the cream. What a rich blend of flavors. The face down technique for baking the acorn squash is now my preferred method.

I just made this last night and we were very impressed! It was wonderful with the scallops, but I think in the future I'll omit the scallops and just use the squash and sauce as a side dish since I love squash! I did omit the jalapeno though and it was still nice and spicey.

Rating: 4
This is a fantastic dish. Make the garam masala fresh. I used a whole accorn squash cut in half which holds the sauce and also makes a nice presentation. Everything can be pre-prepared (squash, sauce, and scollops) and put together several hours later if you are having guest. Have plenty of bread for the sauce.

The sweetness of the acorn squash and scallops worked well together. I served the scallops in a squash half, rather than quarter, and good thing as the sauce is thin. Wonderful flavor.

I substituted low-fat coconut milk for the heavy cream. My husband and I loved this dish! The combination of flavors is delectable.

Absolutely delicious! I really thought this was a lot of food for 2 servings, but my normally eats-like-a-bird boyfriend stuffed himself. I only had frozen scallops when I made it, so I can't wait to try it with fresh. I think the heat is perfect without the additional pepper topping, though.

I am religious about using recipes on this website. I love scallops and consider them delicate and not needing much doctoring up. One might think adding a heavy sauce would take away from the delicate flavor but let me tell you it only enhances it. Not too spicey, not too sweet and not too creamy when served over the squash. Take if from someone who has tried literally a hundred recipes off this website this is one of the best.
