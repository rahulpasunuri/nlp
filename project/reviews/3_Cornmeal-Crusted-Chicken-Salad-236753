Stoli, I wonder if one of your ingredients/measures wasn't off. I just made this, and we all thought it had just the right amount of cumin and plenty of crunch (though I did leave it in the oven a bit longer than the recipe recommends). We loved it overall (although the first time I tried the dressing it was way bland--not sure whether the recipe or I had put in way to much oil).

YUK! Tasted like cumin sprinkled on chicken and blah...not crispy. Dressing YUK. Flavors all YUK.

Nice combination of flavours. The sweetness of the dressing and the sourness of the cheese balanced nicely. I added more cheese and it would have been better with more mixed greens. I didn't have cornmeal or grilled peppers, so I substituted breadcrumbs and sun-dried tomatoes respectively, which worked out well.

this was just delicious in addition to being very easy to make. it was also pretty filling. i used a ginger dressing instead, which made it a little more substantial, but the chicken was moist and flavorful, really love the cumin, and the all the flavors together went very nicely. will make again.
