I have been making this recipe for years and people love it. My one tweak to the recipe is that I sub orange juice concentrate for half of the cranberry juice concentrate.

Wonderful. I've made this a few times and now when I make it I triple the recipe and bake on two baking sheets for a few minutes longer than called for.

Favorite granola recipe. Prefer substituting dried cherries for the dried cranberries. Best part is the toasted pecan. Just make sure to mix the granola when you add in the cranberries. You don't want the edges of the mixture to overly brown.

I thought this was just ok. I was not a fan of the cranberries, but others in my house liked it.

Great basic recipe. I have made this three times in the past month, with rave reviews from the many people I gifted large mason jars full of this to. I found that if I triple the recipe, the sub 1 cup wheat germ for 1 cup of the oats, I get better clumping. Next time I make it, I'll try subing 2 cups of wheat germ to see if the clumping results are even better. I also found that I can omit the oil with no negative effects to the results. I omit the coconut because many people do not like it. I also halve the amount of brown sugar. Still delish, and true to the spirit of the original recipe (I followed the recipe exactly sans coconut the first time).

Simple, delicious recipe. Rave reviews from my husband, who put it on top of greek yogurt. For holiday gifts, I tripled the recipe. I used a mixture of cranberries, blueberries, cherries, and golden raisins, and omitted the coconut because many don't like it. I then packed the granola into quart canning jars.

This is very good. The cranberry juice gives it a beautiful color and a wonderful tartness. I lowered the oven temp to 300, added pumpkin seeds and pistachios and added the coconut during the last 5 minutes. Perfect!

This is my family's favorite granola recipe. I've tinkered with it at times (substituting orange juice for the cranberry, substituting different dried fruits), but the proportions are so great that this is one recipe that I usually make just exactly the way it's written.

Delicious! My husband said he feels like it's some of the best granola he's ever eaten. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a few hazelnuts and lowering the oven temp to 300. It was great! Will definitely be making this again with endless possibilities for creative variations.

Rating: 4
Outstanding! I too cut the oil and brown sugar in half, cooked at 300 and added the cranberries for only a couple of minutes in the oven. I added some sunflower seeds and pepitas. I didn't bother with any of the suggestions to make it cluster better, and it came out all in bits, maybe because i cut the oil. Regardless, it's delicious, easy, and healthy!

We're cooking it right now and it's awesome! We quadrupled the batch to use up all of our ingredients, and it turned out perfect so far. One tip: Make sure you don't put it too thick on the pan or it won't cook properly. Well, it will, but it will take longer. So yeah. We love it! It's our new favorite recipe. I will definitely be making this again, so thanks for posting the recipe!

Very delicious and nice to get clumpy granola! I didn't have the juice concentrate and used 1/2 cup applesauce instead. Used half honey & brown sugar. Omitted coconut. Added the cranberries at the very end since I don't like to dry them out. I liked the granola being so sweet or too oily. Added a little flaxseed meal and oatbran also.

This is the best granola recipe I have found! The spices diferentiate it and rev it up a bit. I made a few changes. I only had regular apple juice so I reduced it down to make it more concentrated. I also added 2 cups of Rice Krispy cereal to the mixture before baking in order to lighten it up a bit and add some crisp to the crunch. It turned out very yummy!

I always make a batch of this for new parents. It's so tasty and satisfying for those midnight cravings that come with the 24-hour new baby schedule. Now that my kid is older, I like it for breakfast.

I have made this recipe at least two dozen times. When I learned that my son was lactose intolerant I searched for breakfast recipes where I didn't have to use the nasty tasting butter substitutes. He finds the granola delicious and I'm happy as it's full of protein due to the nuts. Just add lactose free milk and he's all set!

Loved it. Tasty and easy.

This is an excellent granola with a minimum of oil in it. The juice concentrate provides what's needed to get a few nice clumps and also adds a wonderful tanginess to the blend. I didn't have cranberry juice concentrate so I subbed pomegranate molasses (reduced pomegranate juice) and cut it with unsweetened cranberry juice as it is otherwise quite thick. This is yummy stuff and it's almost gone after less than 24 hours!

We love this granola. My only tweaks - half the oil and use Pecan oil - if not available in your store, is available on the web. Because we love nuts, and don't like coconut, I leave it out and add extra nuts. Great as a snack, or with yoghurt.

You really can't screw up this recipe. It's a great basic granola that you can adapt according to your tastes. Every time I make it, it's usually a bit different depending on my tastes, patience, and what I have in the house. I typically reduce the sugar, use apple juice instead of the cranberry juice, omit the coconut and add in a bunch of different nutty options like wheat flakes, almonds, flax seeds (these can burn be careful). Everyone loves this granola and it is enjoyed and eating up in record time. Make a double or triple batch. You won't be sorry!

My husband was ecstatic when I made this because granola is the only cereal he will eat. I used slightly less than 1TB only, apple concentrate instead of cranberry and only almonds. I also added some fresh cranberries. This recipe is a keeper, I'm making another batch today.

I've made this at least a dozen times and with great results. I do tweak it a bit... 1. use 1 tbsp. oil 2. any kind of fruit juice concentrate works well (apple/rasp., cherry, etc...) 3. Chopped the pecans finer, used almond slices and added 1 tbsp. sesame seeds 4. Baked on a silpat sheet so no burning 5. Cut down on the amount of dried fruit to 1/2 cup and used any dried berry mixture 6. most importantly, added the fruit after it's done cooking. My cooked fruit got too hard/chewy. It must be good because my mother-in-law just asked for the recipe. That says a lot!

I have been making this for years. It's one of my most requested recipes and I never fail to make 4x the recipe. At Christmas, I give out bags of this granola. My only tweeks are to add extra coconut and occasionally, I'll chopped pieces of crystalized ginger with the cranberries (half way through the baking time). If you want clumps, out of the oven...let the granola cool undisturbed. Enjoy!

I made this recipe with several of the suggested substitutions: half OJ, half apple juice. No oil. Lots of pumpkin pie spice. Perhaps due to the lack of oil, no clumps were formed. In addition, I thought the granola was good, but not great due to a general lack of flavor/sweetness. Also, next time I would use only almonds. The pecans didn't seem to add much but a distraction to this granola. In summary, I much prefer the vanilla-scented granola on this site.

Rating: 3
Some adjustments that worked for me: a)use sweetened coconut, a bit more than the recipe calls for, and then cut out all sugar (the juice concentrate and coconut MORE than make up for the lack of sugar) b)leave out the oil, you won't miss it c)use apple juice concentrate and pumpkin pie spice as subs d)i used sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, pecans, and almonds

I will be making this a lot. Very easy and very tasty. I try not to eat sugar, so I, too, used honey instead. It turned out perfect the first time! Can't wait to fix it again.

This was awesome. I turned down the temperature to 300F and the timing came out perfectly. Husband is diabetic so I substituted sugarfree maple syrup for the brown sugar and omitted the coconut altogether. On Austin TX's suggestion I added 1/4 teasp vanilla flavoring to the boiled wet ingredients at the very last. It was delicious --we were eating it right out of the pan, warm. Thanks for this! I've always despised oatmeal but this makes it a treat to eat for not many calories.

I've made several variations of this and it actually tastes better without any vegetable oil, although I do use cooking spray on the pan. I bake it at 300 instead of 325 and found that the granola is more likely to burn on a cookie sheet than in a 13 x 9 pan.

I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, except substituted honey for brown sugar (you're gonna melt it anyway). Wonderful smell when baking -- would make a great holiday gift packed in jars. I would add more nuts next time. Watch baking time carefully, as others suggest -- mine needed a bit more time, but then was slightly darker than I would have liked. It's great with yogurt as a mid-morning snack.

I never give four-fork reviews, but this recipe deserves one -- it made the best granola I've ever had. I subbed orange juice for cranberry and walnuts for pecans, and added a teeny dribble of vanilla to the juice/sugar mixture, but otherwise followed the recipe slavishly. It came out AWESOME. I would recommend timing the baking by taste rather than the clock; mine burned a teeny bit (but was still delicious.) The problem with timing by taste is that you might eat the whole pan before it comes out of the oven. Make a double batch!

Divine! I added sesame seeds and reduced the oil to 3 tbs. for a double batch, but otherwise adhered to the recipe. The results were fantastic--a winner.

I really changed this recipe, but did get initial inspiration from it. I used orange juice for cranberry, maple syrup for sugar, and just a little oil. Pumpklin and sunflower seeds instead of almonds and pecans, and a variety of dried fruit. I toasted the oats, nuits and coconut in the oven first for about 5 minutes, then added the sugar mixture for about 10 mins, then the dried fruit for another 5 minutes. I've eaten half of it since last night!

I make a double batch of this for my husband about once a month. He loves it, especially with dried blueberries. To New York, maybe try cooking your sugar mixture until it reaches 235o on a candy thermometer (soft ball stage).

This has become my standby granola! It's delicious with plain yogurt--add some banana and you're in heaven. I skip the coconut, but follow the rest of the recipe exactly. I just wish I could get some fat clumps out of the batch--I've tried arranging the granola into little clumps before it goes into the oven, but it never seems to work for me. Any ideas? But even without the clumps, this stuff rocks.

I made this recipe, increasing the amount by 50% using a Trader Joe's multigrain uncooked cereal instead of oatmeal. I also changing the fruits to 3/4 c cranberries, 1/4 c. dried cherries, 1/4c golden raisins, and 1/4c candied ginger. my husband said the candied ginger was a little over the top, but a friend liked it better than a blend we'd purchased at the Santa Ynez Vally Inn. I'd be careful about the amount of time I keep it in the oven, too. I thought this first batch ws a little too toasty, but I'd make it again. So, if that's a help

Fantastic!!! I doubled the recipe and used the dried berry mix from trader joe's (cran, blue, cherry & golden raisins. Yummmmmm). forgot to double the oil, but with all the other good stuff in it, we didn't miss it at all! served it at a brunch with vanilla yogurt (also from TJ's). Yummmmmmmmmm.

Yum!! I love the almond-raisin granola recipe on this site but this one is even better. The cranberry concentrate and allspice add such a unique flavor. I never knew making granola was so easy until I found these recipes. It's so much better than store bought granola. I doubled the recipe except for the oil. I did have to increase my cooking time. Just check it every 20 minutes until the top is browned.

I made a few changes to this recipe, because I couldn't find anything cranberry, and didn't feel like running all over town for it. I used apple juice, and assorted dried fruits-peaches, apricots and plums. The coconut I had was unsweetened. I doubled the recipe, but halved the sugar and oil. The results are a crunchy yet chewy tasty cereal. Can't wait to surprise my husband that it's homemade. Definately a keeper, with loads of possibilities for different flavor combinations.

I have made this recipe twice. Not sure why, but I find I have to reduce the heat and the cooking time just a bit. I also cut the oil in half with no problem. This is a very tasty and healthy breakfast cereal, snack, or yogurt topper. I will be making it regularly.

I guess I can call myself another groupie for this recipe! It's an excellent, filling granola with a lot less fat than other recipes (I substituted canola oil for the vegetable oil and it came out very well). I also mix and match the nuts and berries based on what is in my pantry. One time I accidentally used sweetened cranberries and it was too sweet, so I'd advise other cooks to balance sweet additions with other nuts and seeds

Ohmigoodness - this is SO good! The first time I've ever made granola and I was in heaven! Hubby wasn't too keen, but one bite and he was making a bowl for cereal. It's soo filling, but after 1 day all 4 servings (between 2 of us) was gone! Going to definitely make a double-batch next time. Didn't change a thing to the recipe; it's heaven-sent!

I have made this recipe several times already, following the recipe exactly or making modifications. I generally use butter rather than oil, and I cut the amount in half with no problems. Delicious! My boyfriend, who was less than enthusiastic when I first asked him to try it, fell in love. He even asked me to make for his office snack day!

I have already made this recipe about 5 times. I do not follow the amounts exactly, adding a few extra goodies. I found cooking it at a lower heat for about and hour is best in my oven. Turn and stir every 15 min. I cut back on the oil and it did not seem to affect it at all. My mother just asked me to send her the recipe. She loved it. It fills you up and keeps you going all morning.
