Yuck. Not overly time consuming but so not worth the effort. Didn't taste good, didn't look good. Keep looking for a better enchilada recipe.....

we love this recipe. after making it several times, i have found that it is easier to put together if i make it like a lasagne, layering the tortillas on the bottom and between the filling and sauce. i struggled to keep the small corn tortillas rolled and in one piece. making it as a casserole doesn't compromise the taste at all.

The cream is pretty overwhelming. If I make it again, which I probably won't, I will make about half the cream sauce. Otherwise, these are pretty tasty and interesting. I like the mushroom filling.

This dish was FANTASTIC. My guests absolutely loved it. I had to double the receipe b/c of the # of guests, and I mistakenly didn't buy enough cream, so I used 2 cups of cream and 2 cups of sour cream and about 1/4 cup skim milk. The sauce was too thick, but I'm sure it was the sour cream issue. I didn't like the idea of warming avocado, so I sliced it attractively and put it on top after I took it out of the oven. I warmed the tortillas on an iron skillet w/ a little oil instead of dredging it in the sauce. I served it with simple black beans (soaked over night, then simmered w/ onions, garlic, cayenne, oregano, salt & pepper for about 3 hours) and a mexican rice. This dish was very easy, didn't take too long, and was out of this world - I cemented some friendships by serving it. I would for sure make it again, being sure to have enough cream on hand.

Incredible, and very easy. I used canned chipotle chiles in adobo sauce so the flavor is a little different than expected. It took less than an hour to prepare the entire dish, including chopping and cooking time.

Delicious! I have made several variations of this recipe - most of them using meat instead of mushrooms. Sometimes I use fresh poblano peppers instead of the ancho chilies for a pretty green sauce. I think 3 cloves of garlic is plenty. Also, the sauce is a bit thin, so I have used some sour cream in place of the whipping cream as well. Overall, I love this dish!

This is our favourite company Mexican recipe. We have made it so many times and it is always wonderful. I don't change a thing.

Underwhelming. It wasn't bad - I just expected that it would be better.

I thought the sauce was quite bland, but the filling is delicious. I recommend making the filling as directed, but topping the enchiladas with the Mole sauce from the Chicken with Green Olive Enchiladas on this site. Much richer flavor!

I used all porcini mushrooms b/c I didn't feel like chasing more exotic ones down. And used queso fresco. It was delicious. Also, I used fat-free half'n'half (sorry, purists!) with 2 tsp of flour to thicken. To solve the crumbling tortilla issue, I sprayed each tortilla with light cooking spray and baked them in the oven (on a cookie sheet) for 3-4 min - until they were pliable. I then filled them and continued with the recipe.

Awesome. I loved it. I used fresh roasted hatch chiles instead of messing with the anchos and used queso fresco instead of feta. Very good, and I will make them again!

This was a hit at three dinner parties where I served several carnivores and vegetarians alike -- including one guest who has spent considerable time in Mexico. The tricky part is getting the tortillas to not fall apart as you are filling them.

One of the most amazing vegetarian recipes ever. Friends still can't stop talking about it. If you want to cut down on the time, just add minced chiles to the cream sauce. Total keeper.

Tasty, but all the flavors are so powerful that this might be better with flour tortillas. Also, I will make 1/2 the sauce next time, we only used half and ended up throwing the rest away.

This is my 2nd time making this delish dish. I used white corn tortillas, and did NOT cook them in the sauce as specified in the recipe. I think the "cooking" of the tortillas breaks them down, and this is what the other cooks were complaining about (that the tortillas crumbled). I used only portabello mushrooms (no oytser or shiitake) & it was fantastic. And yes, avocados were delicious in these enchiladas! It's Gourmet Mexican, not strictly authentic Mexican. Wonderful flavors and no leftovers.

We have made this several times and have found it very good with a really interesting set of flavors. We swapped flour torillas for the corn, used all portabellas (cost)and really wowed some friends. Prep is easy but time consuming, we enjoyed making it as a couple and with another cooking couple. Gotta try it!

Delicious, easy. Make more sauce, you'll want it.

Avocado inside enchiladas? Ick! If you want to avoid the problem of the tortilla falling apart, fry them first for a few seconds in hot oil. There's a reason why real Mexican enchiladas call for this step, it's not just to add fat to the dish. The frying in hot oil "seals" the tortilla and keeps it from disintregating in the sauce.

Very tasty! I was extremely pleased, and it went over well with my dinner party. Preparation was somewhat involved, and the enchilada assembly was a bit tricky as the tortillas got really soft really quickly, so watch out for that. Also, a little extra cheese wouldn't hurt. Otherwise, an excellent meal!

This recipe is a forgivable indulgence. We added an extra ancho and a few red pepper flakes along with the salt and pepper. It was wonderful! Be careful not to soak the tortillas in the sauce longer than recommended.

I didn't think the recipe was difficult or excessively time consuming. Almost anything you make from scratch takes some time. I made as is, but next time I would leave out the lime from the sauce and the avocado from the filling. It's pretty hard to find ripe avocados here so the one we got was pretty hard! I couldn't taste the feta and would likely substitute it for some monterey jack or another creamier cheese and maybe garnish with more tomatoes and cilantro or just some store bought salsa. Also, I would use some ground coriander and cumin and maybe a little chili powder in the filling instead of just salt and pepper. Maybe the lime juice would also have gone better in the filling. Other than that, I found this to be an interesting dish and I would make it again, even for company.

A lot of work, and a bit messy, but very tasty. I will also try this sauce (with the mushrooms) on chicken and/or beef. A must try for mushroom lovers!

This dish was very involved but it was well worth the trouble. I used chipotle instead of the ancho and through in a little zuchini. It turned out great and I would definitely make this dish again.

I have to admit, I didn't make the enchiladas. I was looking for something different to do with chicken & mushrooms when I came across this recipe. Since I'm on the Atkins diet, can not have tortillas. But the sauce looked delightful. I had dried chipotles on hand, so used those. I caramelized some sweet onions and garlic, added the re-hydrated chiles, and threw the mixture in the food processor to make a paste. Browned the chicken breasts, removed from pan, added the mushrooms and sauteed. De-glazed with white wine, added the cream, and the chile paste. Returned the chicken to the sauce and simmered for 15 min. The sauce thickened nicely, and this was a remarkable dish. Next time I plan to throw in some sun-dried tomatoes. I know it is not at all the original recipe, but sometimes you can take bits and pieces from other recipes to create new ones. I guess I'd call this one CHICKEN & MUSHROOMS WITH A CHIPOTLE CREAM SAUCE!

Good Stuff! The first time I made it...I was living in Boston, so I made it using anchos and feta. I've since moved to New Mexico, and fallen in love with chiles and local cheese, so I use cojita, red chile and chipotle. The chipotle gives it a wonderful smokey flavor, and of course, a little more heat.

The contrast in flavors were very unique this was an unusual recipe that required more than one bite to determine if I liked it. Kind of a pain to make, but I would recommend it for some one who was looking for a change from the traditional enchilada.

I made this recipe last night for my husband and I and we LOVED it! There are so many comments about it being a lot of work and I have to disagree. It has several steps but it certainly isn't difficult or time consuming. I used white corn tortillas and made sure to leave them in the sauce long enough to soften them and they rolled very easily. Messy, a little but well worth the effort. I added extra mushrooms and could have gotten a couple more enchiladas out of 1/2 the recipe. I did (successfully)substitute half of the cream with no-fat half and half to lighten it up a bit. If I were serving this for a party I would make more sauce.

made this the other night for my husband and nephew... both are 'expert' eaters, so I try new recipe's on them. They loved it. I loved it. It is, however, a lot of work. All told (prep work plus cooking) I think this took me over an hour to prepare. But, as most recipes made from scratch, the flavors were amazing, and the results (happiness at the table) made it worth every moment.

Absolutely delicious. It is a lot of work, but worth every bit of effort. Don't substitute or omit, it works great just as is.

This dish is a ton of work, but SO delicious! I've made it twice for dinner parties, and will make it again sometime, when I have the energy.

As a vegetarian, I am always looking for great meatless main dishes, but unfortunately, this isn't one of them. This recipe is extremely cumbersome and time-consuming, which made the outcome even more of a let down. The sauce was bland, and the filling just seemed to be missing something as well. Given some serious tweeking, the recipe probably has potential, but as directed, it's a terrible disappointment.

This recipe is fabulous! I prepared (and reviewed) it in February of 1999, when I substituted fresh, grilled poblano chilies for the dried ancho chilies. Last night I prepared it with the ancho chilies. Before baking, I divided the enchiladas into two dishes and poured the remaining cream sauce over them. I baked one and froze the other for a future meal. It is taking all of our willpower this morning to restrain from raiding the freezer and eating the rest of them! I will definitely make this dish again.

DELICIOUS!!!!! We loved the leftovers with some sauce that we reserved. When making the enchiladas, the tortillas were messy but dipping them in the cream sauce made them more pliable. Try garnishing with a sauce blended with cream cheese, garlic, shallots and roasted green chiles. Thin with a little chicken stock if necessary!!!

I substituted some low-fat cream cheese for the cream which may have made the sauce thicker and the enchiladas drier. However, my husband loved it & thought the filling was very tasty, but when he took it to work the next day he thought they reheated poorly and were then bland.

What a pain in the neck! This recipe tested my endurance. The filling did not stay in the cream coated tortillas well at all. Very messy. The taste was great however. I substituted dried chipotle peppers and the sauce was SPICY (even with the seeds scraped out)!

Made for 30 people. It was all eaten. I thoroughly enjoyed it!

DELICIOUS - I found this recipe to be simple and very tasty. I made it an hour ahead and then reheated in the oven, and it survived well without getting mushy. That makes it likely to become one of my regular "favorites". I appreciated the tip that the sauce can be prepared a day or two ahead. A nice change from the same ol' ho-hum vegetarian dishes.
