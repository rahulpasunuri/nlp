Versatile and easy to make with pantry staples. I ground chicken thighs in the food processor, marinated as directed, and then browned the meat for delicious and simple lettuce wraps. I think I will go to this marinade again and again.

Used it marinade beef tips for a fried rice recipe. So flavorful. Best fried rice we've made yet. Made extra to use with chicken tom.

good marinade. my one quibble is that i think the flavor of extra virgin olive oil doesn't really work with an asian flavor. i would recommend just regular vegetable oil or extra light olive oil or canola. also the recommendation to add a touch of hoisin and sesame oil works well.

I really like this marinade. Very easy, and yummy. I added more hot chile paste and it still was not all that hot.

Quick but delicious. A great marinade for chicken stir-fry; and we made extra as a sauce that we reduced a bit and served with the meal. A great easy dinner.

Used this over asparagus. Cut the spears into 1-2inch long pieces, marinated it a bit and then sauteed the asparagus in oil reserving marinade. After removing asparagus from pan, I added reserved marinade along with a cornstarch slurry to thicken for a sauce. Was wonderful served over rice.

I loved this marinade on chicken. I would hesitate to serve it to friends that do not like spicy foods, however. I am not one of those people!

Oh my gosh, this was so good for being so simple! I marinated some shrimp in this for about an hour, and then sauteed them with the remaining marinade; they were so flavorful! Served over a bed of orzo enhanced with a little olive oil and lime juice. Would have been good over some steamed broccoli too, wish I'd had some. I will totally make this again!

I tweaked this by using part soy and part hoisin for the soy measurement, and subbing sesame oil for part of the olive oil. You could also substitute bottled teriyaki sauce for the soy. We had this over salmon and it was fantastic and so easy.

I was asked to bring shrimp to a Father's Day barbeque. Everyone raved about the shrimp. They were definately the hit of the party. I increased all amounts of the ingredients except for the oil. I used extra, extra pepper flakes. It was great!!
