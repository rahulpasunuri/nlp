bland recipe. There is too much pasta for 1 lb of sea scallops; it was like having pasta with a little bit of scallops. So I tried it again without pasta - not any better. I tried to put in extra basil, which helped a little, but not enough.

Delish! I used large scallops from Kodiak, AK, fresh peas, and veggie stock. I upped the garlic and substituted thyme for basil since other reviewers described the recipe as blandish. The result was light but still savory. I will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe with chicken versus scallops. It was very good, but to sub chicken successfully, the lemon zest should be reduced by 1/2. I always add Old Bay to chicken dishes, and this was no exception - very tasty!

I agree with some of the other reviews, The ingredients indivdually are great, but for some reason this dish was very bland. I added fresh grated cheese also, and still it was bland. I also, seasoned the scallops before I seared them. I will try it again but will spice it up with red pepper flakes, and maybe add some asparagus tips! You definatly need to serve it with a crusty bread! I used whole wheat Penne Pasta and it worked very well!

A little intense for the initial prep, but worked fine. I cooked the pasta before beginning the scallops, etc. Could be done for four, but not more unless you have help in the kitchen. Perfect with a nice green salad, white wine and a lemon dessert. Definitely would do it again! Ron

I don't know. My husband and I have to agree with a couple readers...all the ingredients made it appealing to try but it just didn't cut it...we put a dash of parmesean cheese on to give it a boost...with the leftovers thinking of ways to perk it up. We were disappointed and very rarely have negative feedback on recipes tried...should have read the reviews before trying this one.

For some reason this just did not work for us. We love all the individual ingredients. But it just did not come together as a coherent dish. The amount of liquid is totally under the cook's control - just reduce the liquid to where you want it when you go to finish the dish. We enjoyed other scallop recipes on this site - such as the one with melted leeks (delicious).

It was easy and didn't heat up the kitchen. I prefer making it with bay scallops, but it was fine with the larger scallops. I did make it again and my children liked it.

This scallop recipe is wonderful. With all the fresh ingredients, how can you go wrong? I will definately make it again.

I really can't understand someone not liking this recipe. The pearl onions gave it a very nice sweet flavor. My wife couldn't believe there was no sugar in it. Very good!

I would rate this a zero. It was expensive to make, watery, and dreadful. We love scallops but this just didn't combined into an interesting dish.

This is a light easy dish that tastes great. Good ingredients make good food...the peas, onions, basil and parsley all came from my kitchen garden. My 9 year-old son is the ultimate picky eater,the last time I made scallops you would have though I was serving them worms, yet he ate this, something about some of it being from our garden overrides his yuk factor. Parents take heed. The kids grated fresh parmesan over theirs, which doesn't take away from the dish as a whole. I would go with the smaller bay scallops.

I've made this dish a few times. It is quite wonderful. I can't prepare it in 30 minutes, however. It takes me longer to peel the pearl onions.
