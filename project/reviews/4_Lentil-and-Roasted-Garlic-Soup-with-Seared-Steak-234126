FIRST TIME FOR THIS SOUP, AND ENDED UP MAKING A DOUBLE RECIPE , NOT A BEEF STEW BUT A VERY NICE,LIGHT,COMPLEX DINNER SOUP. IT WAS A SMASH HIT WITH MY FAMILY AND CO-WORKERS. I STAYED TRUE TO THE RECIPE WITH ONE EXCEPTION, I ADDED A LITTLE ENDIVE AND ITALIAN PARSLEY.THIS SOUP HAS SEVERAL VERY SUTLE TASTES, ALL GOOD.TOPPED THE BOWLS WITH THE STEAK AND CHEESE AND SERVED WITH SLICES OF FRENCH BREAD. WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN. RECIPE ALLOWED FOR SOME QUALITY TIME IN THE KITCHEN.

Great ingredients but no flavor. This needs herbs or spices to make it sing. I even used a delicious homemade vegetable stock. Tasted healthy, not delicious. I would make it again as a base but add a flavor profile (preserved lemon? coriander? something!)

I was super nervous because I made this on a whim and didn't follow directions to speed up cooking time, but it was excellent. I put the garlic/rosemary in the oil first and let it heat while I cooked the rest of the soup separately. Cooked the yellow lentils I had on hand until soft and drained, then cooked the sweet potatoes in vegetable broth and plucked a couple of the garlic cloves out then. Remembered to add the sage and green onions after I started on the yams so I added those with the lentils and a couple more cloves of garlic and cooked the steak in the oil last, once I had transferred all the garlic cloves and the kale to the soup mixture. I didn't make as much as the recipe called for but I don't think that I needed that much olive oil to cook the steak in- it came out great as was and the garlic cloves added so much flavor to the soup. As it turned out, my lentils were a bit overcooked but I liked the thick consistency it gave the soup. I'm sure following the directions would have made it taste fabulous, but I was really pleased with how well it came out without a lot of time to marinade the olive oil. Super hearty and satisfying, worth a try!

If you take the time to make your own garlic oil, this is a delicious soup. Subtract the beef, and it is a perfect vegetarian meal. Unlike another comment, I found the amount of kale to be just right. The only adjustment I will make in the future is adding a few more garlic cloves to the oil in the beginning. They add a lovely depth of flavor to the broth.

I liked this..didn't love it, but strong like :) I was looking for something different to do with a beef soup and I think it satisfied that craving. However, if I was to make it again, I would consider roasting the sweet potatoes, to give them more depth in the flavour and add some sherry or port to the broth..it needed something!

I have made this soup many times.It's very flexible. I use a mix of various colored lentils that I add all at the same time. I use leeks or shallots or whatever onion, yellow, red, sweet, etc., that I have on hand. I omit the meat but do use beef broth marketed by a famous chef from L.A. Yams and/or butternut squash are great. I love having the rosemary and garlic oil on hand after I make the soup. Last night, I put some water on to boil, diced butternut squash to 1/4 to 1/3 of an inch to equal a healthy handful, put 2 or 3 oz of soba noodles in the boiling water, added the squash after two minutes, boiled the noodles and squash for two more minutes and drained them. Then I put some of the leftover oil with rosemary and garlic bits in it into the pan, added back the noodles and squash, stirred to coat, and turned the dish into a pasta bowl. I added a healthy grating of good parmesan and had a simple feast. This makes a light dinner for two along with a salad or a fairly hearty meal for one.

The picture is a little misleading: 12 ounces of kale is A LOT of kale, and this soup is easily dominated by the kale. Slow-roasting the garlic didn't seem to add a lot.

I agree with denglere01 on enjoying the Pasta, Sausage, and Bean soup much better. This seemed to take far too long for the result. It was good though and super healthy...but to me, it wasn't worth the time. Some of the other soups I make are a fraction of the time and taste just as good. My husband and kids LOVED it though. So that is something to be said about it. My 9 year old and 6 year old actually scarfed it down! Maybe it WAS worth the time....

My fiance and I found this to be a little bland as well...but mind you, we are never able to follow recipes exactly. It was too late to make our own garlic oil but I found "Benissimo Roasted Garlic Olive Oil" in the grocery store that was complete with several sprigs of rosemary in the bottle (and one of the cheapest flavored EVOO at $5.79.) Perfect! I also added two finely diced carrots and celery as I had them on hand to the leeks...as well as leftover spinach leaves with the Kale. My grocery store only had one type of lentils...so I used double the amount for both the green and red lentils. I feel like you can cook all the lentils up front in step one, or skip that step and add them all in later on. All of our lentils were cooked perfectly. In the end, several splashes of Frank's Hot Sauce seem to do the trick and give this the flavor and kick we were looking for. We may or may not make this again...as we far more enjoyed "Pasta, Sausage, and Bean Soup" http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views /Pasta-Sausage-and-Bean-Soup-836

Garlic oil is a key ingredient in this soup, be sure to include! On of the few soups that I enjoyed more the first day, opposed to soup that "infuses" for a day or two. Hearty and delicious for a cool winter eve.

Simply delicious! I tend to prefer thick and creamy soups to thin ones with lots of stuff, so I used a stick blender to puree the soup before I threw in the greens, and it was a huge success. I also think I didn't use kale. I grabbed what I thought was kale, but the cashier pointed out it wasn't curly enough, and that I probably had either dandelion greens or turnip greens. Whatever! It's all good. I agree that this would be equally good as a vegetarian soup as a meat-eaters one, and it's nice that you can actually serve it to both at the same meal, since you don't need to put in the steak until you serve it up. This is definitely going into my winter soup rotation!

This soup takes a while to make, but it is soooo worth it!! The flavors and textures work so well together.

Something went wrong! So I have to agree with Phillicook. I made this recipe pretty much exactly - I spent 90min doing the garlic oil and everything. I did cut the kale down a little and used 4oz of green lentils and 4oz of red. I also did 8oz of yams and 4oz of butternut squash, all of which I roasted in the oven before adding it at the end. Now - none of those things should have caused this soup to be sweet, but it was SO SWEET. It was the strangest thing ever! I finally had to add lemon juice to try and cut it so that I could even eat it. I was so disappointed after reading all the rave reviews. I have had much better lentil soup, especially recently from Kuby's in Dallas. I am a really good cook but this was just not what I expected.

Great as vegetarian soup (without steak of course). I used a half cup of olive oil and dried rosemary, which seemed to work just fine. And I cooked 1/4 cup more of green lentils and red lentils, and probably could have added even more. I had about seven little portabello mushrooms, chopped them up and threw them in with the yams. I was worried they might throw off the flavors but the garlic oil and soy sauce held their own.

Fantastic! I did not make my own garlic oil, but instead bought some pre-made at the store. This recipe was amazine. A combination of ingredients that I wouldn't have thought of. And the colors with the orange and green make it a beautiful presentation.

Seemingly simple, this recipe is exceptional. I did not add the steak as I am a vegetarian. Key to this recipe is the garlic rosemary oil, it infuses the entire dish with fragrant and pungent rosemary all without being overbearing. I highly recommend an earthy french red wine from the languedoc.

Nice mix of flavors. To save time, don't worry about making the garlic oil - just buy some olive oil that's been infused with garlic. Aside from making the garlic oil, the recipe was fairly quick and very easy. Cut down on the kale and add extra lentils. Very hearty, satisfying meal. I'd omit the meat as well - didn't add much and seemed a little out of place.

If you make this recipe exactly it is absolutely amazing. If you omit the steak it makes an exceptional soup for vegetarians. I've made the soup alone so many times I have the recipe committed to memory.

Lacks flavor. A decent and health soup, but a little boring. I used half the amount of kale and doubled the lentils, which may have been the problem. I was so disappointed with this lackluster soup after the reviews made it sound amazing. I would have used a lot more garlic and it needs something else- thyme perhaps? I preferred the soup without the garnish. I might try to make it again just for the challenge of making it better.

This is a great recipe. Next time I will add more lentils (2X) and cut steak in half.

Has become my favorite soup this season! I cut the kale in half and and did try oven roasting the garlic (instead of slow cooking in olive oil w/ rosemary) but found the soup to be too 'one dimensional' - definitely more layers of flavor with the infused olive oil. Accidentally burned the garlic first try so opted for the high setting on the crock pot instead. Also, added both New Mexico green and New Mexico red chile on different occassions - delicious and perfect with the roasted garlic.

I am actually making this recipe for a second time. It is satiating and healthy. I do not always make it with steak. It is wonderful to freeze and eat in a hurry-- simply have vegetarian. I use not just broth but vegetable puree/stock to have a thicker, heartier consistancy and to pack in the veggies. This gives the soup a smoothe texture. I use 1/2 the garlic oil suggested for cooking with-- sometimes less as I like to store and drizzle the garlic rosemary oil on the hot soup as a final touch. I also try to leave the kale or spinach for the last minute, so it doesn't lose consistancy, flavor, or nutritional value... drop about 1/2-1 cup chopped cup per serving per person after the soup is heated. Today I am replacing the sweet potato with roasted butternut squash... can't wait to drizzle the rosemary garlic oil over it... yum...

I love this soup, it is so full of flavor and so good for you. I omited the steak and served with crusty brown bread. One of my favorite fall foods!

This is the best lentil soup I've ever had. Out of necessity I substituted a red onion for the leek, and dried instead of fresh for the rosemary and sage. I cut way down on the kale, as other reviewers suggested. Nearly doubled both kinds of lentils, and didnt bother to cook the green lentils separately, just sauteed the onion, then added both kinds of lentils at once and about 8 cups of vegetable broth. Apart from cooking the garlic in the oil, which I did in the morning and which took about 45 minutes, the whole thing was done in about 40 minutes.

Just to add a note -- this is a great recipe, and gets the house smelling terrific, but I would do it with 1/2 or 2/3 of the kale next time.

Yes this lentil soup is fantastic. It's ALL about the roasted garlic - it actually flavors the whole pot in a fabulous way. I used only red lentils (can skip the first step) and doubled the amount of lentils. I also used some finely diced grilled chicken instead of steak only because it's what I had handy. But I've passed this recipe on to many people already because it is so good and healthy!

So, SO tasty. Some minor modifications: We roasted the garlic in the oven instead of in oil (using a LOT less oil in the process), added a couple of regular potatoes and an onion, and skipped the beef (vegetarians; I imagine it would be sublime with it though.) Doubled the lentils. We also doubled the garlic and substituted frozen spinach for the kale. Served over Thai black rice. What a perfect harmony of sweet roasted garlic and hearty lentils and leeks. Hoh! I can't wait for the leftovers.

This was fantastic! Quite possibly the best soup I've had, and I've cooked/eaten a lot of soups. My wife agrees. I too roast the garlic in the oil, and it certainly wasn't lacking. Even if this takes you two hours or more, it will be worth it. Another crusty bread recommendation as well.

Rating: 4
Delicious. I concur with previous reviewers who have called it the best lentil soup they've ever had. Also based on previous reviews, I simply roasted garlic in the oven rather than making the garlic oil; I can't imagine the soup lacked flavor as a result. My one new suggestion--for meat eaters--would be to cook your steak at least one full step lower than you like it (that is, rare instead of medium rare, if not lower) because the meat will cook considerably further in the hot soup.

This soup was fantastic! Instead of slow cooking the garlic, I cooked it on medium heat for about ten minutes. The soup still had a great garlic flavor and some crusty bread was a great pairing. I plan on making this again.

This is the 2d time I've made this recipe and if we liked it a lot the first time, we loved it this time. One word of caution: I'm not the fastest cook around but I don't think I'm the slowest either, and this recipe (even apart from the garlic oil preparation) took me a llllong time -- like 2 hrs+ long. Thinly slicing 12 oz. of de-ribbed kale alone is no small task! That said, the soup is so good that it's woth the effort. I'll just be making it on leisurely weekends vs. harried weeknights.

Thought this was fabulous!! I usually make two different meals for me and my BF (I'm a veggie and he's not!) So I thought this would be great because I would just leave the steak off of mine. Only made a few substitutions, did the roasted garlic in the oven, only used green lentils and omitted the rosemary and the sage (only seasonings were salt and pepper and what ever was in the veg broth, Pacific organics broth in the carton worked perfect!) I will definetly make it again, and am planning to bring it to my next potluck event!

Loved this recipe and would definately make it again. Agree that the garlic method could be shortened but not omitted as the roasted garlic flavor adds alot. When I did my shopping for ingredients I thought I had red lentils at home but it turned out it was red split peas, instead of using grn and red lentils I substituted the peas and it was wonderful.

I like the soup; I don't love it. I followed the instructions, other than using only green lentils (couldn't find red). Creating the garlic oil was a waste of time. It would have been easier (and quicker) to just saute some minced garlic in oil, or roast some in the oven. The kale, steak and parmesan cheese made the soup a winner. But, I could add these as a finishing touch to any lentil soup recipe.

No words can express how much we enjoyed this soup BUT...since we are vegetarians, we made it without the seared steak. This soup has gained an special place among our favorite foods. Thank you.
