This has been "my" apple pie recipe since 1995 when it arrived in the Thanksgiving issue. It seems to come out well no matter how I vary it, I have used all types of apples, Granny Smith are nice also. Although I love cinnamon, I reduce the amount, by the time the pie is done you have 3 1/2 tsp and I felt it overpowered the pie. I use the 1 tsp called for in the dry mixture but only sprinkle a little over the prepared apples before I put the top crust on. I use Pillsbury crusts. Don't fear the honey, I have never really tasted it but it gives a lovely consistency inside the pie. Enjoy!!

Just okay ... everyone else liked it though.

I'm not a big apple pie eater, but this one caught my eye because of the cinnamon, which I love. Well, this pie is great!! I did use a pre-made pie crust and only used red delicious because that's all I had, but this was still fabulous. And sooooo easy! I'll definitely be making this again and again -- everybody loved it!

I make this pie every year for Thanksgiving and I get rave reviews. I cut the apples on the thick side, but otherwise I don't change anything. GREAT crust- worth making the crust from scratch.

IT is a very good recipe, I use golden apples and royal gala. Also I serve it with a caramel rum sauce with the ice cream it put's it over the top. I serve it at my restaurant for christmas and everyone loves it.

This was my first attempt at making apple pie and i have to confess that i bought frozen pie crust just to ease into the experience. The pie smelled fantastic while it was baking and was quite good with vanilla ice cream. I think i will try out other recipes on this site before i claim this one as "my" apple pie recipe.

I have made this pie several times and everyone LOVES it! I even made it for my boyfriend for his birthday (apple pie is his favorite dessert)...

Made this pie for a Thanksgiving get together and it was a huge hit. I used Pillsbury pie crust dough and no one was the wiser. I am making it again today because I have some leftover vanilla ice cream I don't want to go to waste...:-)

I somewhat enjoyed the recipe for pie crust that came along with this-although it was far too thin and brittle and the apple mixture was so bland. I usually bake with granny smiths, so the difference was highly noticable. I wouldnt make it again. Too much work for not enough flavor!

This is my standard apple pie insides recipe....although I never use Red Delicious apples. They wouldn't add a thing to this recipe. Try Macs or Cortlands or Empire with the yellow delicious. My friends and family love the pie and the house smells great while it's baking. Enjoy!

WOW! This was the best apple pie I ever made! I used a pre-made crust and it turned out great. This is perfect for cinnamon lovers! I can't wait to serve this again on Thanksgiving.

I'm thirteen and just learning how to cook. I use this site for nearly everything, and I must say I'm quite happy with it. I made this pie, and my family absolutely adored it! I make it quite often now, but I use store-bought crusts to make it easier. It's a delicious recipe I would recommend to anyone. It's better than store-bought pie by far, and isn't too hard to make. Try it!

I used this recipe twice, for Thanksgiving, and everyone loved it. The crust was a little crumbly, so the second time, when I took it out to spread milk on it, I also spread on some honey which held it together and gave it a sweet, flakey top. Used brown sugar on the inside, white on top. It was great.

This pie was pretty good. I used a ready-made crust, which made preparation very easy. The vinegar cut down on the sweetness and really added a nice tang to it. Everyone had seconds immediately!

Very delicious. I made it with Golden Delicious apples and its definitley worth the effort.

I thought this dish was just okay...nothing to rave about. It was more work than it was worth & I wouldn't make this again

This apple pie was good, but not great. I'm not a huge fan of apple pie, maybe that's why I wasn't overly thrilled with it. The crust came out well, and was easy to work with and roll out. I brushed on the milk and added the cinnamon sugar right from the beginning because I misread the recipe, and it was fine and the crust didn't burn or anything. People who had it said they liked it, but I think I might look around for another recipe next time.

This pie was fantastic. Although it was the first time I make an apple pie it was absolutely delicious. I used a ready-made crust and it worked fine for me. The cinnamon flavour was absolutely delicious and the vanilla ice cream on the side was the grand finale. I would definitely recommend this pie to the first-time pie maker...it's simple, easy & absolutely delicious.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit to seay the least. But I used a ready made crust. needless to say I've made several since then. I also made a granny smith version, but this by far was the BEST!!

The filling was delicious but I would have preferred a slightly different crust. I can't put a finger on how the crust should be like, the closest I can say is I would have preferred a less crumbly crust.
