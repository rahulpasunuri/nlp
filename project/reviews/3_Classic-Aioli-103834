this recipe is wonderful. Like kim suggested it works well to just start in the mortar. I added finely chopped artichoke hearts and used it on crostini and it is a great treat!

I made this for a Bastille Day Slow Food event. It is very garlicky, and so it should be. I had fresh garlic, which makes a difference, and is probably why it's traditional for this time of year when the garlic is fresh. I found it easier to prepare the recipe from start to finish in the mortar; the quantity of starting ingredients was too small for my blender. Just chop the garlic finer and crush to a paste with the salt before starting to add the oil. The emulsion began to break after a day, so it really should be made the same day that it will be served.
