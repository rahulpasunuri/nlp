Loved this recipe! I was looking for something to pair with the chicken thighs i had sauteed with salt, pepper, garlic, oregano, and lemon that i could do with my pantry items. I had the bag of frozen artichoke hearts so this recipe fit the bill. I thawed the hearts under running water and then did the rest of the recipe in the pan i had cooked the chicken. I didnt bother boiling them, but instead did a light sautee with the onions until they caramelized. I also did not use all of the butter and oil called for - i had maybe 2T olive oil in the pan with the chicken fond, but because i love butter, i did stir in 1T with the lemom juice. When it was done and I had tossed everything together and placed the chicken thighs on top in mynserving dish, my husbad and 3 year old were both visibly impressed and at first bite, my husband declared "perfection" which is high praise indeed!

This was good, but a little rich. I'd cut the butter and oil in half. I threw in a 2.25-oz can of sliced black olives when the artichokes were sauteing, and tossed with capers at the end.

Made this vegan by substituting eggless fettucini noodles, and using margarine (Earth Balance non-hydrogenated "buttery spread") in place of the butter. Made it once with grated soy cheese in place of the parm, and once without anything. It was delicious both ways. I will definitely make this again some time.

I rate this 3 forks as is. I've made it several times with considerable additions - my favorite is to add sun dried tomato, roasted red peppers, and sauteed chicken. I make a ton of it, as it freezes well.

This was an easy, quick and tasty meal. I would definitely make it again.

As suggested by previous posters, I roasted the artichokes and used pecorino instead of parmesan. I also left out the butter (to make it healthier) and added a bit of raw olive oil just before serving. It was very tasty.

My friend made this for a dinner party last weekend and everyone wanted the recipe! It was so delicious.

I was already 30 minutes into steaming an artichoke when I decided I needed something more substantial than artichoke and lemon-garlic butter for dinner. so onto trusty epicurious for a recipe... it was too late to go shopping so I just used what I had in the kitchen. once the artichoke was done steaming I dipped the leaves in garlic-lemon butter for a delicious calorie laden appetizer and waited for the pasta to finish boiling. I diced the heart and sauteed it in a little olive oil and the left over lemon-garlic butter. then I tossed in the cooked fettuccine, salt and red pepper flakes and sauteed everything together for a minute or so. finally I garnished with grated romano. it was REALLY tastey... I'll definitely try it again.

I loved this pasta dish. Be sure to use frozen artichoke hearts but do not boil them - roast them in a 375 oven for 20-25 min to bring out their wonderful flavor. I used excellent parmesan and great handmade pasta. My guests raved and it was super yum.

This was delicious. I used canned artichokes. It would be a great dish to make in a pinch since it calls for ingredients commonly kept on hand.

this was very average until i spiced it up some. I will make it again but only with my tweeks. The main problem is with the frozen artichoke hearts. This recipe will be much better if you use the marinated kind from a jar which will make the prep time even shorter,
