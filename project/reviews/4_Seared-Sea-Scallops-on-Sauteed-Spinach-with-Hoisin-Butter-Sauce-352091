Very, very good. Only change I dusted the scallops with pepper and flour..otherwise stuck to the recipe. Served with some steamed rice as well. Husband loved it!

Loved the flavors in this recipe. The Hoisin Butter Sauce is outstanding -- only a drizzle over the scallops and greens is needed to enhance the flavor and not over power. I reduced the amount of butter and used swiss chard in place of spinach otherwise followed the recipe. The prep work is a little time consuming but the finished dish is well worth it.

Fabulous! Halved the recipe for two of us and made no changes. My boyfriend loved it and couldn't get enough of the sauce. This is definitely a keeper!!

We had to use chinese garlic chili sauce since we didn't have a fresh serano chili, but it was great and otherwise followed recipe. you can cut back on the butte w/o degrading the recipe or under-rating it. I think some previous complaints about sauce are because you need to offer as a side--we do have a lot extra but it definitely was fantastic. serve with white rice. for those like HP in big apple, epi offers chance to post comments w/o a rating, which is the appropriate method of commenting when you significantly change a recipe. for those not reading comments, the 4-fork for your recipe can unfairly change the rating of the recipe (for better or worse)...although in this case is great since so many of us love this recipe!

This recipe required multiple steps and pans, but the end result wasn't worth the effort. The hoisin sauce was way too salty and powerful. I omitted the chili pepper and substituted chili flakes - still very spicy. The recipe would be better served over something like rice to mellow the flavors and provide something to soak up the salty sauce.

Why do people bother to put a review in when they state in the review that the recipe doesn't at all resemble the original recipe? You are wasting everyone's time, you aren't reviewing the recipe-I'm not interested in reading the review of your "created" recipe, which doesn't even resemble the original recipe.

i substitued zucchini,yellow squash and carrots, all of which i jullienned as i didnt have spinach. i sauteed garlic and ginger in butter and oil for a few seconds then added the veggies which i stirfried until they were crisp- tender then added a small amt of hoisin, rice vinegar, garlic chili sauce until it glazed the veggies. then i drizzled a small amt of sesame oil on top. i served this with pan-seared scallops but didnt put sauce on the scallops so as not to overpower the delicate flavor. while this bears only a modicum of similarity with the recipe it does have similar ingredients and flavors. i served with jasmati rice and consider the improv dish very successful. i will try the original with spinach another time.

Truly fabulous dish. I halved it for my family of three, and am now anxious to serve it at an upcoming dinner party!

Made this recipe for two - cut the butter way down - more spinach - our first attempt at making scallops - we thought we were enjoying a delicious dinner out (except we were drinking our own fabulous wine!) - definitely a keeper recipe - I would make for company!

Had friends over that were ... suspicious of my first attempt at scallops so one friend opted for a different meal (my husband can't do them). She ended up having a plate of the scallops, too. Recipe is right on. We all loved it.

I cut the recipe down to serve 2. Instead of hot chilie sesame oil, I used a sweet thai chili sauce and I did omit the serrano chile. My husband and I loved this recipe and thought we were dining in an upscale restaurant. Will add this to my favorites.

I agree with the other reviewer who gave this recipe one fork because the sauce is too strong. The hoisin overwhelms the delicate taste of the scallops. The quantity of hoisin should be measured in teaspoons--certainly not a quarter cup. Too bad for a recipe that sounded great and made such a pretty presentation.

My husband raved about this. Said it would be something he would be delighted with in a very high end restaurant. Next time I might make it with Jasmine rice and double the sauce for a more substantial meal.

This was a perfect dish! My kids loved it. It has a wonderful balance, bright and beautiful. I was out of mirin so I used sake, and I did not have peanut oil so I used grapeseed oil.

excellent. I love scallops, and this was a great way to fix them. I will definitely do this recipe again.

This is soooo good! Made it for the two of us, using 10 scallops, jalapeño pepper, and halved or thirded all other ingredients. And used a bit more butter since everything is better with butter. Served it with rice to which I had added ginger. A real keeper. Do not be deterred by the number of ingredients. It is really very quick if your are the least bit organized.

Very quick and easy, and delicious. I used just peanut oil for searing the scallops like in the last review, so the butter wouldn't burn, and used extra chili sesame oil. A big hit!

Served this recipe for a dinner party. Everyone raved it was the best scallop recipe they ever tasted! I served it with a side of mashed potatoes and a salad. Prepare all ingredients ahead of time. I seared the scallops in a little oil without the butter (the butter started to burn at a higher heat needed to sear the scallops).

Great recipe. Had to use bay scallops instead of sea because we couldn't get the sea scallops. However, the flavors were excellent and it was a really quick and easy recipe.

Wouldn't change a thing

Really delicious! I added a little more than 1/2 tsp of hot chili sauce to the hoisin mix because I didn't have any serrano peppers, but followed the recipe otherwise.

my whole family loved it... I added a touch of tamari for flavor and cilantro because we have it fresh in the garden right now - will definitely make this again!

I cut the butter waaaaaay back, but otherwise was pretty true to the recipe. This is going to be a regular on the table. I was also thinking of serving the spinach with grilled salmon... yum!

Very flavorful! I halved the recipe but next time would do the full amount of sauce because it cooked down quickly and we really needed (wanted!) more. Used sea scallops that were actually tiny, like bay and the meal was perfect just the same. Awesome dish!

This was awesome and a complete meal in one-I didn't have a serrano chili so I substituted a few jalapeno slices which worked fine. Chopped everything ahead of time so it went very fast.

Awful. A waste of good scallops. The sauce was waaay too strong. Made it exactly as recipe stated.

Excellent recipe-I did not have a serrano chili so used a jalapeno instead which worked just fine-loved the spinach and the hoisin sauce added a lot of flavor! Easy and delicious

I agree with the reviewer below - have everything prepped ahead of time. This is a FABULOUS recipe. I think the fresh ginger is what makes it so great...it gives both the spinach and the sauce incredible flavor. I'll be making this frequently. Would be a lovely meal for guests.

Wow!!! Great look, great flavors. I used nice big Kodiak scallops and they looked and tasted great. Be careful not to over scallops. I got back a bit on the chiles and the heat was evident but mellow. just a great seafood receipe. The prep is not long and it comes together quickly so have everything ready to rock when you start. Pinot gris or Pinot Noir both worked well along side.

This was fabulous. I cut the recipe in half..........sweet and spicy. The spinach was so good that I will make it again with other entrees...perfect side dish. I really liked the serrano in the sauce...I am addicted to chili's so I was happy. Not too filling. Just right. Highly recommend if you have jumbo scallops.
