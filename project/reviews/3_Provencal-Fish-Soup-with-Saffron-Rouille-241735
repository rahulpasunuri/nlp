This was foul. The rouille was yummy but the soup was awful. UGH. I host a regular soup and movie night and everyone thought this was nasty!

Made this several times now. About as close as I'm going to get to the real bouillabaise on the shores of the Mediterranean, but in my kitchen. It's too difficult to assemble all those fishes. If you love bouillabaise, this is an easy substitute. I made it as is with the exception of reducing the orange zest. The ruoille is essential.

My husband loved this soup! I cooked it exactly as written and it was delicious. I don't have a food mill so I pressed the soup through a sieve, which worked just fine. Really nice for a special meal!

A food mill is a kind of hand-cranked puree-er. I guess you could use a food processor instead, but it won't strain out the bones and such.

This soup has exceptional flavor. The rouille was delicious on top. I was nervous about the whole fish, but anything that you wouldn't want to eat is left in the food mill. I did have to clean my food mill several times during the processing though. I used Bronzini because my market did not have whole cod, perch or whiting. It was wonderful.
