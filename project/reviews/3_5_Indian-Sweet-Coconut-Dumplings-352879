I would highly recommend this recipe. It was delicious and I served three of the dumplings with mango sorbet. They were surprisingly light and had fantastic flavoring. Personally, I love cardamom!!!

Easy, delicious and so fancy-looking. I've never cooked with wonton wrappers before and was delighted with how beautifully they fry up. THe recipe doesn't look like it could possibly make 24 but it does - you barely need a half-teaspoon of filling for each wrapper. They cook up FAST - don't take your eyes off them or they'll burn. I love the cardamom - so fragrant.

Fantastic! SImple, set and forget before guests arrive until the actual cooking time, which does not take long. Fragrant, uplifing, small portion is best, tantalising, different. Yes, vanilla ice cream on the side. Kids can do the actual packing/folding of the wantons.

Meh. It turns out I'm not such a big fan of cardamom (I'm not entirely sure I've tasted it before). If you are a big fan of cardamom, you'll likely love this recipe. If not, you'll likely hate this recipe. If you've never had cardamom, I might suggest only adding about half of what this recipe recommends. The cardamom flavor pretty much dominated the dumplings. For those that haven't had it, it has a very floral, fragrant essence. I pretty much felt like I was eating coconut soap or shampoo. I made this for an Indian themed dinner party and needless to say, they were hardly touched. For culinary adventurers with broad palates only!

An incredibly simple and delicious dessert that will wow guests because it looks more complex than it is. I served this with homemade white chocolate ice cream which was a great pairing, but any light type of ice cream (vanilla) would work took
