Like some others, I found this tart to be too sweet. If I made it again I use less sugar in the crust and in the filling.

I made this tart with key lime juice instead of lemon, and with both the shortbread crust and with a graham cracker crust. We liked the filling very much, and preferred the graham cracker crust to the shortbread. Didn't caramelize either one and they were still very good. Be sure to push the shortbread up to the top of the tart pan or all the filling won't fit!

I thought this tart was easy and delicious. I have always made lemon tarts where you have to make lemon curd and stir and stir over a stove, so I really appreciated the ease of this tart. However, mind did not carmelize on top as I wanted. When I put it under the broiler the crust began to burn and only the very center started to carmelize slightly. I had to remove it for fear of the crust turning black. Maybe a small kitchen torch would work better?

This is a wonderful basic tart recipe and has been devoured by all to whom I serve it! I like my lemony things extra tangy so use 2/3c sugar and the zest of 2 lemons like some of the other cooks. I sprinkle frozen raspberries over the base before adding the filling as well. The raspberries look pretty in the tart and I haven't bothered with caramelising sugar on the top either. I serve with creme fraiche and a drizzle of sweet syrup I make by reducing 1 c sauvignon blanc/riesling and castor sugar.

Yummy! I probably shouldn't give it 4 forks since I made some changes, but I'll definitely make this again. For the crust, I made it with white whole wheat flour, chilled the crust in the freezer for 30 min, avoided the pie weights and baked a tartlet pan for about 15 min and an 8 in tart pan for about 25 min. For the tart, I decreased the sugar to 2/3 cup, changed the whipping cream to light cream and only used 1/3 cup, and used about 1 tsp of vanilla instead of vanilla bean. I used 1/2 cup lemon juice (juice of 2 lemons) and added the zest of both of the lemons. I thought results were quite delicious, as did my friends. I didn't caramelize the top, but I'll try next time.

This was OK but I thought it was bland compared to "Double Lemon Bars" (Bon Apetit, Aug. 2005) also from this site. Double Lemon Bars have lots of pulp and rind and juice which packs a lemony punch this tart just didn't have. A disappointment.

This is a base recipe: I added 2 tsp zest, used Meyer Lemons, only 2/3 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup -- for greater zing. Then using the recipe for candied lemon peel (epicurious) I decorated the top of the cooked tart with the candied lemon peels before I put it into the fridge overnight. Did not caramelize it. It looked very pretty and tasted absolutely wonderful -- we loved it.

This is a great base for a dessert. Make sure that you use fresh lemon juice and add a little zest. I serve it with homemade berry sorbet.

Very good! I reduced the cream by about 1/2 and sprinkled blueberries on the bottom. Everyone really enjoyed it, although (as others have noted), it didn't have that tart lemon "zing."

Excellent and easy! What a great find! I added 2T of lemon zest and it was just perfect.

Absolutely fab! Everyone loved this tart. I've made it several times now and it always gets rave reveiws. The last time I made it, I didn't carmelize the top, just sprinkled powder sugar over it and it was great. This is one of those rare desserts that is definitely better the next day!

Superb tart, I am a caterer and clients love it. Need to watch you don't burn the crust when you carmelize the sugar, so I often cover the crust with foil. Freezes well so ideal to make ahead.

Terrific tart. Looked beautiful and tasted delicious. I added grated zest of one lemon. The topping took longer to caramelize than I expected and the crust was a bit scorched, but it was still great -- creamy and lemony. Will definitely make this again.

I liked this, but don't think I'll make it again. The lemon flavor was dulled too much, maybe by the cream. I prefer a "zippier" lemon tart.

The tart was delicious, added fresh zest. I did find the tart was a bit too sweet for my tastes, which was countered by serving it with VERY lightly sweetened whipped cream. Will definately keep this recipe around.

This is delicious!Made it for Easter Sunday.Easy to make and very attractive as well as tasty.I added 3 tablespoons of lemon zest.

Fabulous recipe and very easy to make! The only substitutions I made were the addition of 1 Tab lemon peel and used vanilla infused sugar instead of the vanilla bean. Other than that I followed the directions exactly. This tart actually improved overnight and was better the next day.

This is lovely...I get a chorus of oohs and ahs the minute everyone tastes this! I would love advice on how to improve the crust...mine tastes great, but it always sticks to the bottom my non-stick springform pan, which makes it hard to serve. Any thoughts?

I'm always looking for a good, easy lemon bar/tart/meringue pie recipe because my huband loves it. This one is IT! Easy to make, the filling had a good flavor and not too eggy. I didn't have a vanilla bean so I used extract instead and I skipped the carmelizing, too. It's a very presentable dessert, too.

I don't think the reviewer below is commenting on the right recipe (ginger?). This recipe is good but not great. The consistency of the filling was not smooth, and it was difficult to judge when the filling was set because it was boiling/bubbling at 35-40 min - maybe we overbaked it? Liked the vanilla bean "seeds" to flavor the filling, and the crust was easy and shortbread-like. We also added a ring of fresh raspberries around the tart before serving (after caramelizing the top).

This is a delicious cake. It takes a while to make but well worth it. The ginger and lemon together makes a great combination.

This is a no-fail tart. It comes out great every time. Good cookie-like crust and delicious, very lemony filling. If your oven is like mine (takes less time to cook, bake than recipes call for)after you take out the foil and beans, reduce the baking time to 10-15 minutes. The crust can get a little too brown if you bake for the entire time.

Second time, same results....good flavor...enjoyed by all BUT after removing the foil and pie weights, try baking for 10-12minutes....20 minutes too long.

This was a great recipe! Not too sour and not too sweet. My boyfriend loved it. I tried carmelizing in the oven the first time and it was a disaster. The next time I made it I did not bother and it tasted great anyway.

This recipe is just about perfect! The crust is wonderful, and the filling just tangy enough. I caramalized the top, added whipped cream around the edge and halved strawberries. My Mothers bridge friends just raved about it.

My husband's daughter is a pastry chef, and her lemon tart is incredible, so I haven't dared make my own. This recipe, however, met the challenge. It's delicious, a perfect combination of sweet/sour, and not terribly difficult to make. When entertaining, I usually have this dessert when serving "Salmon with Soy-Honey and Wasabi Sauces," available on this website.

THIS IS THE BEST LEMON TART IN THE WORLD. If only I didn't have to share it with my guests. I always get asked for the recipe when I make it. Put the pastry in the freezer for a couple of hours before baking it.

This is an excellent tart, the brulee topping really wow the guests. I made the tart dough the day before, gathered in a ball and kept it in the fridge. The next day I let it come to room temp for 20 minutes than rolled out between two plastic sheets to get more of an uniform thickness. The dough can be hard to handle, but it's tender and crumbly, well worth the effort.

Rating: 4
Excellent tart, and so easy! I didn't realize until I was ready to roll out the crust that this is a no-roll recipe! I was skeptical about the crust, but it is perfect -tender, crumbly, shortbread cookie like. For anyone who dreads rolling pastry, this one is for you. The lemon filling is perfectly sweet and tart. This is a keeper.

Great recipe as is. Served as main dessert to dinner party...huge hit. however, I followed a suggestion by another reviewer to add sliced lemons to the top of the tart midway through baking...bad idea...while good in concept, the lemons came out hard & curled upward a bit. Taste didn't add anything either. I ended up taking them off the tart when served. Just stick to it as is. It's great that way!

Agree with all the reviews. A very good, easy, yet elegant desert. Perfect for Spring/Sumemr. I made this in an 11" tart pan, adding 1/4 to the quantities listed. I also placed blue berries in mine (let the crust cool a bit, add blueberries and then the filling) and it was a nice variation. One tip. Make sure you blind bake the crust for the entire time mentioned. I pulled mine out a couple minutes early and some of the crust stuck to the foil.

Although I don't enjoy lemon desserts, I made this for a co-worker who does. It received RAVE reviews. I made one slight alteration, which everyone seemd to love. Halfway during the 40 minute tart baking time, I gently laid thin slices of lemon onto the top of the cooking tart, thus allowing them to cook into the top. Then, when caramelized, the whole effect made for a beautiful presentation, plus one more bit of tang (or so I was told). All in all, simple and well received.

Yum...I agree, the best lemon tart ever! The cook from California is right - the filling is runny, so make sure you build up nice high sides for your tart crust so that the filling does not leak. Delicious.

Rating: 4
The best ever!! My husband normally does not care for anything with lemon and he loves this! Easy to make and always a hit. One hint, the lemon mixture is quite runny so you may want to have your pan already on an oven rack and pour batter in there, can be quite messy trying to carry pan full of liquid to the oven!

Everyone loved this dish. I would make it again. It is super easy to make and delicious.

This is the best lemon tart ever! I've made it a few times and each time had to add more water to the crust. I too found it was easier to roll out the crust rather than trying to press it into the pan. Also, a secret for the carmelized top: Melt a half-cup or more of white sugar in a saucepan. Pour it onto aluminum foil to cool. Break into pieces and use a food processor to reduce it to powder. Sprinkle it on top of the pie and it will carmelize in seconds under the broiler.

I made the base the easy way. I rolled out the dough, laid it over the dish and pressed it against the sides, ensuring that the pastry was not stretched. I trimmed the edge and put it in the freezer for 30 minutes,, before baking it. No foil, no beans, a perfect result every time. On dishes with a diameter of over 14 inches I leave part of the pastry over hanging the edge until it is cooked, then trim it while it is still hot.

this packs quite a lemony punch! I used lemons and a few limes instead of just lemons which have may cut some of the bitterness. Oh so good! This just might be my new favorite dessert.
