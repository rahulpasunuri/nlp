I should've listened to the other reviewer who was disappointed with this recipe. For me, it was a waste of good veggies and couscous. It was very bland. I would not make it again.

I think the recipe was carelessly edited; the carrot was left out of the ingredients needed, and the amount of couscous is truly alarming; I blindly followed the recipe, and was left with a huge mountain of indigestible couscous. I had to add quite a bit more broth. More to the point, I was disappointed in the flavor. Many years ago in NY, in a Glatt Kosher restaurant featkuring Moroccan food, I had the best veggie couscous I had ever had, and I was hoping this would approximate it. It didn't.
