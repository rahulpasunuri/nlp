Just like the other reviewer ... I made a few changes. I did the same thing and added shredded carrots and sautéed with the ginger and garlic. And then I added sliced cooked chicken breasts that I had on hand. I used olive oil too because I didn't have peanut oil. And because my husband and I try to eat healthy ... I used shirataki noodles (minimal carbs). I drained, rinsed and dry cooked them in a non-stick pan before adding to the dish. I forgot to buy basil (my husband isn't that big of a fan anyway) but it didn't seem to make a difference. And I, too, served it hot. It was soooo good! Without the chicken it would make an awesome side dish! I'm definitely making this one again!

Made this pretty much as written, but I only used 1 tbsp sugar and 1 tsp salt and regular basil. To the reviewers who complained that it didn't have enough sesame flavor: maybe it has something to do with the oil you're using? Our unrefined and expeller-pressed oil provided tons of yummy sesame flavor. Will make again for sure.

So I'm guessing I'm one of the few people able to find all of the ingredients. My thoughts on this dish: very good but some changes were needed to make it a winner. First, balsamic vinegar works only if you don't have Chinese black vinegar on hand. If you have this, use instead for a more authentic flavor. Second, the sesame flavor is not strong enough-use a tablespoon of Chinese sesame paste or tahini for a more sesame taste. Finally, the Thai basil really does add something but barring that, cilantro adds the needed punch for this dish.

I did make a few modifications so I don't know if I should review this dish. But I didn't alter the ingredients in the sauce too much. With my alterations, I must say that this is my new favorite pasta dish. Instead of peanut oil, which I did not have I used olive oil. Because I wanted it a little more substantial, I I cooked 2 sliced chicken breasts, chopped carrots, and sliced yellow onion with the ginger and garlic. I wanted a wider noodle so I used linguini. Also since I forgot to purchase peanuts, I eliminated the sugar and used peanut butter. I used normal basil instead of thai basil, since they don't sell that at the normal grocery store. And I served it hot not room temperature. Other than that, I followed the recipe. And wow! The flavors were wonderful. The entire entree was very different from any pasta dish I have ever cooked and I can't wait to make it again! It was a nice balance of sweet, tangy, spicy, salty, and acidic. I did think that peanuts would have added a nice crunch that would have enhanced the dish even further. And I kind of wish I had a lime slice to enhance the acidity even more. This dish rocks! I give it a blue ribbon for sure.

This is an amazing recipe. I never imagined how the mix of the seasoning came altogether. Since I didn't have basil leaves, I used fresh coriander and mint leaves instead and used some basil leaves powder. And, the key to this recipe is I think add lot of peanuts.

Super yummy! I added shredded poached chicken breast and added in some chili garlic sauce at the table instead of the chili oil. Really superb quick and easy meal.

Rating: 2
If made true to recipe, the sauce is like taking a huge gulp of ocean water - WAY too salty! Eliminate the added salt & tweak the recipe by adding a couple tablespoons of peanutbutter and it becomes 3 forks. The combination of ginger/garlic/sesame oil is normally wonderful, but made as is, this is inedible. (and yes, I used a teaspoon, not a tablespoon.

This was very good! I substituted some sliced jalapeno pepper for the onion. I will definitely make this again; it was fast and easy! I would also serve this with chicken as another reader did. Yum!

Love this recipe! I've tried different noodles and my favorite to use are Japanese Somen (I like Hakubaku Organic Somen) is by far the best! If you use a whole package of Somen (9.5 oz) you'll may need 1 1/2x the sauce because they soak it up like crazy! I like making chicken to go with this to make it a full meal. I chop a few breasts into small pieces and cook it in a pan using all the sauces/oils in the sauce, plus a little Mr Yoshida's Original Sauce. I start out with just the oils and ginger and garlic to sear the chicken, then add the rest. I just do splashes of everything and tweak it as I go. When the chicken is fully cooked I add a small tablespoon of corn starch to thicken it. I then cook it down until the sauce is really thick, then a minute before I take it off I throw in a handful of scallops and untoasted sesame seeds. Serve the chicken on top of the noodles with additional sesame seeds and scallops for garnish. SO good!

What a hit! I did make minor changes: instead of mincing the ginger, I popped it in the freezer overnight and grated it (the process produces a lovely paste) & reduced sesame oil from 3 to 2 TBS and added 1 TBS peanut oil since good sesame oil can be overpowering. Out of hot chili oil so added a TBS of canola and a good pinch of red pepper flakes. Added lightly sauteed diced sweet bell peppers and let all flavors marry about 12 hours. Guests' first servings were polite; seconds were less so! No leftovers here.

This was a very easy and very yummy dish. I didn't have peanut oil, so I substituted with sesame. I also didn't have hot chili oil, so I used "rooster" sauce instead--Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce--3/4 TBl instead of 1 tbl as it calls for the oil. Next time I'll probably make with Chicken.

Awesome. Other reviewers are correct -- added the chunky peanut butter and splash of fish sauce, substituted rice vinegar for balsamic, used roasted sesame oil, doubled the ginger and garlic, added red bell pepper, shredded carrots and used fresh angel hair pasta.

Delicious. I doubled the sauce and though the sauce did taste a little bland, I added a tiny bit of fish sauce and the whole thing perked up. Doubled the sauce and sliced thin cucumber into the noodles. A tip for the sesame oil-use TOASTED sesame oil-makes a HUGE difference. The Thai basil is also different from regular Italian, and that help too.

So amazingly good! I added grilled chicken and some diced peppers to it. I also used garlic chili sauce as I didn't have chili oil. Didn't have basil, but I will add next time. I made this last week and I am craving it already. My boyfriend said this was "Restaurant Quality"! You must let it sit for at least an hour. Was great the next day cold!

Bring this to a party and you will never be let off the hook again because everyone will ask you to bring the same thing next time you come over!

Good recipe but I think the finished dish was a little flat. Maybe a squeeze of lime or lemon at the end would do the trick. As many reviewers noted, no additional salt, other than the soy sauce is necessary and you need to make nearly twice the amount of dressing for the 1# of pasta. It makes a ton though, so maybe cut the pasta by half and make the regular amount of dressing. Four people ate it as an entree and we still had half left. Will make again.

I made this dish according to the recipe with one small deviation. I didn't have the hot chili oil, so I threw in some hot chili flakes instead. This dish is so simple and delicious.

I gave 3/4 stars because I made some additions: I added a red bell pepper & a cucumber julienned. What I think really made the dish, though, was some fresh sliced shiitake mushrooms sauteed in the same oil mixture. When I made the oil mixture it first seemed like a lot of oil, but it complemented nicely the linguine type noodles I used. Forgot about the basil and didn't miss it.

This is soooo good! One of the best recipes I've tried from this site, and super easy too! I've made it 3 times in the past 2 weeks. My substitutions, based on other reviews: Spaghettini for the noodles, regular basil for Thai (only because I couldn't get Thai), 1 Tbsp peanut butter for 1 of the Tbsps of sesame oil, rice wine vinegar for the balsamic (agree that balsamic in this recipe just seems WEIRD), chili garlic sauce because I didn't have chili oil, and half the salt (or even less...found it WAY too salty with the full amount of salt). I just added some thinly sliced red pepper, but might try with some chicken or shrimp too, next time.

i followed previous reviewers' advice and swapped out 1T of sesame oil for peanut butter, rice wine vinegar for balsamic, honey for sugar (just 1T honey) and Siracha for the hot chili oil. i also skipped the salt, added a sliced red bell pepper, chopped avocado, and toasted sesame seeds and served seared ahi tuna on top. delicious. oh - i used udon noodles.

I thought this dish was very good, but I did make some changes: used peanut butter to sub for one tbsp of sesame oil as per other reviewers, used rice vinegar instead of balsamic, and I added sauteed snow peas, shredded carrots, and some thinly sliced flank steak to make it a complete meal. Even better the next day cold!

Fantastic and easy. Added some shredded carrots and red pepper and cucumber for color, I didn't have any scallions but I'll plan for it next time. I did add some Thai peanut sauce and thought it was a great addition, but creamy peanut butter would have worked too. Chopped Honey roasted peanuts gave it a nice complement to the chili spice.

Delicious-- This recipe could be expensive, if you don't have some of the more specialty items in your refrigerator- but I can almost promise that you'll be making it again and again, so the upfront cost is worth it!

This recipe as altered by anarubi from Panama on 05/15/09, is delicious. I have to echo the befuddlement at any recipe calling for balsamic vinegar in an Asian dish when rice vinegar is so much more appropriate. Those desiring an Asian equivalent for balsamic should go with Black vinegar instead.

LOVED this recipe. I made the following substitutions/changes: - Used olive oil instead of peanut oil - Doubled the sauce recipe - Substituted 1 HEAPING Tbs. of chunky peanut butter instead of 1 Tbs. sesame oil - Used Siracha instead of hot chili oil - Used about 2.5 Tbs. honey instead of the sugar - Used regular basil I also tried the fresh egg noodles. If you can find them, USE THEM! They are FANTASTIC. I found mine in the refrigerated produce section in my grocery store, next to the wonton wrappers and tofu. Cook them according to the directions on the package.

Thanks to previous reviews, substituted 1T peanut butter for 1T sesame oil, no salt, chili garlic paste for hit chili oil and rice wine vinegar for balsamic (what was the creator of this recipe thinking?!). I made the sauce quantity as written and the noodles absorbed all of it. I would make 1 1/2 times the sauce next time and reserve the 1/2 for pouring over the noodles after they have sat. Served with stir fried beef and baby bok choy. Everything basically at room temperature. Garnished with toasted sesame seeds and chopped green onion. No peanuts or basil. Very flavourful and quick for a week day meal.

I made these noodles for a 4th of July bbq we went to yesterday. I followed some other reviewer's suggestions and doubled the sauce, and added some peanut butter (creamy, I did not have crunchy) using an immersion blender. I used fresh Chinese egg noodles from my local asian market, but since they did not have the Thai basil as they usually do, I left that out. I made it the day before so the flavors would be absorbed by the noodles.After tasting it, I was concerned it might be a bit too spicy for the average person, but everybody loved it! It was the hit of the bbq and everyone wants the recipe. I will be making this recipe again and again!

Very good! very easy! Tweeking: - 1/2 the amount of pasta - 1/2 the green onion or add some minced shallots - omit salt, basil optional - Add shredded carrot - Take a 1/4 cup of the peanuts and mince them in the food processor - If you have any oyster suace or preferebaly duck sauce or plum sauce throw in 2 - 3 tbps. It will add some flavor and consistency. - Double up on everything else to coat pasta well. - Use a seperate bowl to mix part by part the past with the sauce to get the right consistency

This is my family's favorite recipe. We share it when ever we can. I even made it for my wedding day so that I would have some delicious to munch on all day. It really is important to let the noodles set and soak up the juices before serving. I too use crunchy peanut butter instead the nuts and peanut oil. I use Sriracha hot sauce and I think it is the perfect amount of spicyness.

This was a good recipe. I used a heaping tablespoon of peanut butter, next time I would use about half that amount. Also, instead of hot chili oil, which I did not have, I used sriracha. Next time I would use about a tablespoon of it to give it more kick. I didn't have whole peanuts, that would have been a good addition, as would Thai basil instead of regular basil. I also used Udon noodles, which were delicious. I like this recipe because you can tweak it successfully in many different ways.

This was a great, quick meal.

Great recipe. Easy to make and great for a picnic or potluck. 1 tbs. chili oil is just the right amount of spiciness if you're making this for a crowd, but I would add a little more if it was just for me. The changes I made are: - used 14 oz. of DRIED Chinese egg noodles. - added 2 heaping tablespoons of chunky peanut butter. I would definitely add the peanut butter because it adds o the peanut flavor and thickens the sauce a little bit.
