Living on the Gulf Coast, I get incredibly fresh seafood. I took a red snapper fillet (1 lb) and seasoned it with lime pepper marinade, 'sumac' from my Mediterranean market, and fresh lemon juice. I further modified the recipe by sauteing the fish in a non-stick pan until almost done (100F), removed it to a warmed plate and covered it. To the pan, I placed the onion, garlic, herbs and sauteed them until tender. I didn't have raisins, but I did have fresh mushrooms, which I then added. Rather than canned tomatoes, I chopped a fresh tomato, microwaved it 1 minute, drained off the liquid and added it to the pan and heated it. Then I added the fish back to the pan, lightly covered and cooked it to 140F, and added the capers. As I don't care for pickled jalapeno peppers, I dusted a bit of cayenne pepper for heat at the end. IT WAS FABULOUS! Technically, this may not be true 'Veracruz' style, but I assure you-you will not be disappointed!

This is my family's favorite dinner. We substitute salmon in place of the red snapper and always double the sauce recipe to save for another day. It is so delicious and healthy. Imagine your kids asking you to make something so healthy! Great with rice too. This sauce would be great with chicken or beef too. So easy and the sauce can be made ahead of time. Delicious!

Delish, i didn't have capers or currants. However it was very good still. I will make again and add capers, the added briney flavour would be good. My husband loved it.

Wow, this was excellent. I actually have not reviewed a recipe before though I've relied on Epicurious reviews hundreds of times. I had to write in for this one. My husband and I kept saying "I'd order this at a pricey restaurant in a second".

This was so easy to make and even though my local supermarket didnt have red snapper, I substituted another white fish, cod, and it was Delicioso! Highly recommend it. The only thing I would suggest was to double the raisins. Enjoy!

Very delicious! Topped it with fresh crab, lemon zest and chopped parsley. Served with an olive baguette. Perfect for soaking up the sauce. Can't wait to make it again. Will add more raisins next time.

deliciouso! a perfect summer meal. good quality olives are essential, and if you have fresh and very ripe tomotoes, use them instead and cook sauce for longer time. I used golden raisins which I chopped, and garnished with lots of cilantro and lime wedges. I didn't have oregano or jalapenos and it still turned out great!

This recipe is definitely a keeper. I think that it is one of the best fish dishes that I have ever made. I did not have green olives so substituted with Kalamata olives. Will try with green next time, but the Kalamatas worked just fine.

Rating: 4
This was a HUGE hit with dinner party guests! I omitted the pickled jalapenos though because it seemed like an after-thought. The only addition was 1/4 cup dry white wine (sauvignon blanc). For the canned tomatoes, I used a product called '6 in 1 Ground Tomatoes' in puree which allows me to skip the draining step as well as the simmering / thickening steps. The sauce is the perfect consistency using '6 in 1'. Make it a day ahead so the raisins will plump!

Rating: 4
We love this! It makes great party food because the sauce can be made well ahead of time. I've made it with fish and then topped with shrimp and crab for a really elegant presentation. I've also made the sauce for just shrimp. With some crusty bread and a salad you have a great meal!

I made this dish this evening using some halibut I needed to cook. It was FANTASTIC! Cooked it just as the instructions called for, except had to use regular oregano. YUM! My husband, who doesn't like fish OR olives went back for thirds! (I didn't tell him about the olives.) Will definitely be cooking this frequently with different fish--- maybe cod next time. So easy and so good!

Excellent spicy memorable flavor. House smelled great to boot! Wasn't able to cook down the tomato juice enough, so served in big soup bowls. The raisins are great, I would add more next time. Could be a good base sauce for other things as well. It did overpower the snapper though- maybe I didn't get the ratio correct. Definitely a keeper!

Mmmm... this was amazing! I picked up some fresh snapper this afternoon and I'm glad I decided on this recipe. I only had one 14 oz can of toms, so I threw it in the blender with 4 or 5 ripe vine tomatoes. I didn't strain the puree, just added the entire tomato puree at once after cooking the onions and garlic. This made things easier, and was of no detriment to the sauce. The only other thing I did differently was to dice the pickled jalapenos and add them to the sauce with the raisins and capers... (I was hiding them from picky husband!) We ate it with potatoes cooked in lime juice and olive oil with salt and pepper, and some grilled bread rubbed with garlic to sop up the sauce. I rarely review recipes, but this was so tasty! It's so rewarding to make something easy that looks great and has such a brilliant flavor. Perfect!

This is one of my favorite fish recipes! I increase some of the ingredients: 4 large cloves of garlic, 3 Tbsp. chopped fresh parsley, 2 tsp. dried Mexican oregano, and 1/3 cup chopped pitted green olives. Otherwise, as written. We serve it with organic corn tortilla chips and homemade guacamole. Delicious.

Very good flavor combination... we did it with chicken breats instead of snapper fillets. Defintely a hit with the family -- there were no leaftovers for me to take to work for lunch :-)

Rating: 4
A few caveats -- I added chopped pickled jalapenos to the sauce before it went into the oven instead of using them as a garnish. I also did not use bay leaves, and added a whole onion instead of the 1/4 cup listed. Finally, I didn't drain the diced tomatoes, and pureed them in the blender instead of with a potato masher. All that being said, this recipe (or my bastardized version of it anyway) was delicious! Would definitely make it again.

I've made this twice for my husband and I and we LOVE it! Easy to make, beautiful and delicious. I always add fresh cherry tomatoes (halved) and have used Rock Fish b/c the store never seems to sell red snapper. Delicious either way.

This is a staple in our home. Healthy, delicious and easy to prepare. I also skip the drainage step, tried it the first time and didn't notice a difference. I also just chop the tomatoes in the pan as they are cooking and incorporate pickled jalapenos in the sauce for spice. We have also made this with salmon, still good. And we always serve it over cous cous. Good stuff!

Fantastic. I meant to buy a different fish and bought snapper by error and my search lead to this recipe. When I make it again I will lower the oil but everything else the same. The pickled jalapenos are a must but I had a jar that I pickled myself so it was a definite win-win situation!!

Delicious! I will definitely make this again. I loved the sweet/tart of the capers and raisins. I didn't have pickled jalapenos so I just threw in a fresh one while I was making the sauce. Very good with little boiled potatoes. Next time I will try it with rice.

This dish worked out well as written. I'm not convinced it was worthwhile to track down the pickled jalapenos for a garnish.

Made this for my dad's birthday dinner last night and got rave reviews! Definitely a keeper. Like many others have said, I skipped the first step of draining and crushing the 'matoes.

I've made this a number of times, and it's always been great - I use a can of diced tomatoes drained without mashing (Red-Gold brand is the best i've found), and in the last few minutes of cooking, turn on the convection oven to evaporate a bit more of the juice.

This was great and easy to prepare. I made it pretty close to as indicated except I used half the fish and all the sauce. The sauce is really good- you have to be sure to have evaporated the liquid though, because when you bake the fish, it releases lots of juices and liquid. My finicky husband who doesn't usually like fish even loved it!

Loved this dish. Doubled it to serve 10 friends for a Mexican theme dinner and used grouper instead of snapper. Used the great suggestions from the reviews, mixing olives, cinnamon, etc. Did add sundried tomatoes to add a boost to the sauce.

Followed by Crepes with a Cajete Sauce, Toasted Pecans and Ice Cream. The meal won rave reviews. Thank you, Epicurious, for providing this great website for us.

Excellent and practical because you can make the sauce beforhand and then cooking the fish is a cinch. I made as is but for: adding a pich of cinnamon, using greek black olives, using regular organo. The peppers in the end are a must as they give the dish an extra kick!

2 1/2 forks. This was OK but just missing something, and I made the recipe exactly. Perhaps cooking with chiles and some red bell pepper, vs garnishing with pickled jalapeno, would have perked up the flavor. The finished dish was good enough, just not really worth the effort as is.

Made with freshly caught albacore which was a bit too meaty a fish but the sauce was very tasty. Would double the raisins as their sweetness was a nice complement to all the other savory flavors.

Here's a hint for ya'll. Double the sauce when you're making it. Then you can freeze 1/2 of the sauce and make a good Putanesca Sauce with it for Pasta later on. To do that, take a large (non-reactive pot), add a little olive oil, heat it up, then and an anchovie (or two depending on your tastes). Heat the anchovie for about 2 minutes until it becomes mushy, then add your defrosted sauce and heat till hot. In the meantime prepare your pasta. Voila'!!! FYI-The only things I did to this sauce are as follows: I halved the amount of raisins, I added white wine with the tomatoe sauce, and I added a tablespoon of fresh lime juice and 2 tablespoons of fresh cilantro. *I have an additional Veracruz recipe that I liked, so I thought I'd try this one and incorporate the fresh cilantro and the white wine into this recipe. It turned out perfect, and I really like the idea that you can really cook once and make at least two different meals. *I served the Red Snapper with white rice and steamed, buttered broccoli. The sauce is the star of this recipe, so I found no need to get fancy on the side dishes.

A tip for cooks whose loved ones don't like raisins or olives or capers and such...hmmpf! I put the sauce in a blender and processed it lightly, enough to make those "undesirables" undetectable - except for taste - which my loved one claimed was "delicious!" (If you commit similar subterfuge, it would be best to use canned whole plum tomatoes instead of diced, and leave the potato masher in the drawer.)

My husband and I loved this dish. I am a vegetarian, so I used tofu for my portion (firm and halved it lengthwise), and the snapper for his.

This is on my all-time top ten list of recipes. It is delicious (love the raisin, olive, caper combo) and it earns extra bonus points for being a great make ahead dish with wonderful presentation for company. I was able to shop, cook, cleanup with two hours of notice for a dinner party for eight - the very first time I made the recipe. They didn't have red snapper so I used tilapia and it came out great. Also used canned whole tomatoes which I drained and chopped up coarsely. I doubled the recipe of course and cooked it on a jelly roll pan.I would give it ten forks if I could. Only thing I didn't quite get was the purpose of all the fuss with the tomato juice...? Why drain everything and re-add it again? Next time I'll see what difference it makes to skip this step.

I loved this recipe. This rave is coming from a non-fish lover and someone who despises olives and capers, two ingredients in the sauce. My husband made this for company and everyone had second helpings. In addition to tasting fabulous (you can't taste the olives), the recipe was really easy -- it is one of the few fish recipes that you can make in the oven. If you prepare the sauce in advance, you have no cooking time while your guests are there. You can put the fish in the oven while you join your guests for cocktails. And the recipe is easy to double or triple. My husband doubled it and added extra tomatoes for more sauce. It took a little longer oven time because of that. Also, we used orange roughy because our local fish store did not have red snapper. It was delicious!

This is a good basic Veracruz as it does have the olives. I add a touch of Cinnamon and it really adds depth and a touch of Intrigue as most folks can't recognize the taste. The cinnamon is what sets it apart. I actually use a Veracruz Snapper at our restuarant in Perth, Western Australia.

I made this this evening and it is an excellent recipe. The recipe is very simple and uses mostly pantry staples, so it can be assembled without a lot of shopping. The whole thing comes together very quickly. The sauce is delicious and keeps the fish very moist while baking. It has a nice balance of sweet, salty, acidity and oil. Rather than dirty a baking dish I would suggest using a large (5qt), oven proof chef's pan to make the sauce. Then add the raw fish, spoon the sauce on top and put in the oven for the requisite baking time.
