These brownies have been a family favorite for years, and are one of my son's favorites. Now that mint chocolate chips are difficult to find in grocery stores in the U.S., we've used chopped up Lindt Mint Chocolate bars. I use the Lindt bars anyway when living overseas.

Easy and Delicious I substituted Cocoa powder & refined Coconut Oil for the 2oz chocolate and didn't add 1/2 cup mint chips to melt but substituted mint extract for vanilla. The latter made them more Mint Chocolate Brownies than the more subtle Chocolate Mint Brownies I think the recipe was going for, but they still tasted great and my housemates loved them.

There are so many great brownie recipes out there. This has become my new favorite because of how easy it is and how great they turn out. I have made this recipe twice, once with mint chips in a mini muffin pan and once with regular chips in an 8 x 8 inch pan. Great chocolate flavor, more chewy as brownie bites, more cakey when bake in the cake pan. As another cook wrote, this is a great basic recipe.

I used Andes Crème de Menthe Baking Chips (10oz) from Walmart. They came out excellent and didn't lose its mint flavor at all.

A good recipe, but the flavor is very dense. If you're making this to cure a sugar craving, add extra sugar, because the unsweetened chocolate will overshadow most other flavors. I made these for a birthday and everyone liked them, though. I will bake for longer next time, though; the brownies weren't firm once cut up into pieces, and fell apart easily. With a few modifications, though, this could be a great recipe.

I made these with Andes candy pieces and cut down on the sugar a bit. They turned out great, but lost there mint flavor after a couple of days. I will try these with other mint chips next time. I think these were very good and will make the again and again. Very easy to make too!!

These were so simple to make, I followed the recipe exactly and used geherdelli chocolate mint wafers (chocolate disks). Came out perfectly and everybody at the party said they were delicious.

Have made this several times, to great appreciation. Couldn't find the chips this time, so chopped up 3 Ghirardelli bars and found that the mint flavor was more intense than when I used Hershey's chips. I overbaked them this time and they only lasted about 24 hours before getting pretty dry.

I have not made this recipe yet, but FYI Guittard Mint Chips can be found in the baking section of Longs Drugs (at least in Berkeley, CA).

These were excellent and very easy to make. Mint chips are hard to find in my part of Connecticut (even at Christmas now), so I went online and searched for some to buy. The California Candy Company (www.californiacandy.com) sells a wide range of baking chips by Guittard, including green mint chips which work well in this recipe. I think they cost something like $3.49 for a 12oz bag and they seem to ship at all times of year, unlike a lot of candy companies.

I'm puzzled by the "75% approval" rate of this recipe. Surely it deserves better! It's too bad that stores carry Hershey's mint chocolate chips only at Christmastime, but other mint chocolates are worth seeking out for this recipe. Ghirardelli makes mint chocolate drops that are like giant chocolate chips, and they work perfectly. If you have to buy bars and chop them up, those are excellent too. Don't wait until Christmas to make these!

These are the best brownies ever. Hershey's makes mint chocolate chips, but they are a seasonal item, so I stock up at Christmas and store them in my spare fridge. Everyone raves over these when I make them!!!

I loved this recipe when Ghiradelli made mint chocolate chips. I find it to be too dense when I chop up their their chocolate bars. I am looking forward to trying the August 1997 Bon Appetit Mint Brownies recipe using peppermint extract. Gretchen

These were great, especially considering how easy they were to make. Turned out very moist and chocolatey. I couldn't find mint chocolate chips, but they were nice with the regular kind. Also, the recipe was fine baked in an 8x8 inch pan.

Outstanding Brownies. We used regular chocolate chips and the results were delicious!
