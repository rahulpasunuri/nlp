I modified this quite a bit, using frozen pineapple, pineapple juice, frozen mango and coco lopez. I did not strain it at all, it turned out more like a frozen smoothie pop. Kids love them, adults adore them, but did ask that I put in some Indian rum next time ;-)

This was simply great. My 7years old daugter just loved it. My best girl friend had 3 in one a hour. I just added 1/2 cup sugar since the fresh pineapple wasn't that sweet and I didn't even force the mixture throug a sieve.
