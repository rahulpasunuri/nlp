The cranberries make this refreshing and just different enough to be special. I made it basically as is, subbing olive oil for vegetable oil, Granny Smith apples for Red Delicious, and pecans for walnuts. You could vary this umpteen ways, but you don't need to.

Made the vinaigrette as directed, plenty of left over for other meals. Omitted apples. Rinsed only enough greens for 3 people, while still wet peppered so would stick, then tossed with enough dressing to lightly coat. Added aprox one half a pomegranate, seeded and one quarter of a red onion, very thinly sliced. Topped with fork crumbled goat cheese and orange supremes. Family raved.

The vinaigrette is delicious! I used leftover homemade cranberry sauce as a substitute for the cranberries, then omitted the sugar from the recipe. Salt helps balance the sweetness of this recipe.

I like the basis of this recipe - but imho, needs a heartier lettuce such as Romaine.

Fabulous! I just made this with Beef Bourguinon (YUM!), and mashed yukon gold potatoes with caramelized shallots (Bon Appetit), and it was a great combination. Such a simple but yummy salad. I used a fraction of the oil - probably only 1/3 cup, and thought it was perfect. Otherwise, just as-is, and will use the rest of the dressing soon on the same salad

This is a delicious salad! Yes, the dressing is brown, but lots of dressing is that color with balsamic, and it tastes fabulous. Everyone loved it. The toasted walnuts are key. I used fresh (not frozen) cranberries, a teaspoon of honey instead of sugar, and red oak leaf lettuce. One head of lettuce and one and a half large apples fed about 12 people. The dressing made at least double what I used. I was happy I hadn't added any cheese because it didn't need it, and there were vegans at the party.

I was underwhelmed by this. I made two separate dressings, one with balsamic and one with white wine vinegar as one poster suggested. The white wine vinegar one was pink and to my view, seemed odd on salad, albeit festive. The balsamic was insipid and did nothing for the salad as a whole. I would have been better off with candied nuts and drizzling on oliveoil and salt for a dressing.

This is an amazing festive salad. Tart and sweet at the same time. I used toasted pecans as we don't like walnuts and threw in some dried cranberries. Did not add blue or goat cheese but I think the addition would be great. The entire salad was devoured at a Thanksgiving potluck. Would be a good post-entree salad to cut the fat.

YUMMY-- this dressing is delish. Much better than the mayo-laden apple-waldorf salad of yore!

This make way more than 6 servings. I cut the recipe in half and had enough for 8-10 small side salads. Very festive and simple to assemble.

Great started salad. A little sweet on the dressing so I would decrease sugar next time. But overall good flavor. Would make again.

This salad was not a hit at my Thanksgiving dinner. I used fresh cranberries, and no matter how much I processed them, they never got "smooth", as the recipe suggests. They also lent it an "uncooked" taste...it would be better to use cooked cranberries. The flavors just didn't match well, especially the red onion. It was particularly overpowering for the baby greens that the recipe calls for - they wilted under this heavily emulsified dressing. The deep brown color looked unappetizing on the sliced apples. The nuts would have been better candied. There was just something missing from this recipe.

Rating: 4
Whenever I make this, adults tell me how sophisticated it tastes, and kids actually devour it and ask for more. That pretty much makes it my default salad recipe.

The idea for this is good but I found the dressing lacking. I tried it both with "normal" dark balsamic and with white balsalmic because others said that the dark vinegar gave the dressing an odd brown color. I agree. The brown color is wierd in the dark balsamic version. It looks like gravy. The white balsamic version was a pretty pink color even after I added cayenne for some kick. Neither dressing though had much punch and had a cloying finish. This even after I reduced the sugar by a third in the white balsamic version. I would have liked a dressing with more tartness. Perhaps I'll add rosemary like one reviewer did once I dress the salad itself and altho I don't usually like heat, cayenne for some kick.

The vinaigrette is outstanding. Goes really well with the apples. Next time I would candy the walnuts.

I had leftover cranberries from another recipe, so I made this dressing. It was easy and delicious. It stayed emulsified great too! The second time I made it, I added leftover fresh rosemary that married well with the cranberry.

Made this fantastic salad for a dinner party that needed a mostly make ahead menu since I was going to be away from the house all day until about an hour before guests were going to arrive. Mixed the dressing the day before and just had to chop apples, toast nuts and toss everything together at the last minute. Guests could not get enough of it.

Rating: 2
I wasn't crazy about this salad. The apples made it seem a little bit like a salad from arby's. If i make it again i will grate the apples and soak them in lemon or orange juice. Candied nuts are a deffinate yes, they added so much flavor. The balsalmic vinegar was too overpowering and made the dressing brown. Next time i might use white wine vinegar.

My "foodie" friends enjoyed it at our trial pre-Thanksgiving dinner. I made it with pomegranate in place of the cranberry in the dressing and then put pomegranate in place of apple in the salad and used carmalized walnuts and added gorgonzola and avocado. It will definitely be part of our Thanksgiving dinner this year.

Great recipe. I used Granny Smith apples instead of Red Delicious.

Rating: 3
Loved the taste of the dressing. The only problem is keeping the apples from turning brown. Red delicious turn brown almost immediately even tossed with lemon juice. My friend's tip is to soak cut apples in Seven-up (really) until they are needed then drain and use. This really works and doesn't seem to leave any aftertaste of soda. Also, I made this out of cranberry season so followed others' suggestions and used whole cranberry sauce. Still good, but I look forward to making it again with fresh cranberries.

This thanksgiving will be my third year using this recipe. Everyone loves. I usually make the cranberry sauce from scratch and it comes out great.

Truly outstanding, definitely 4 forks. Served with my house-specialty wild mushroom risotto, and although those plates were eventually licked clean too, the salad was such a hit people just dropped their plates and stood over the salad bowl. By the time scraps were all that was left (and most people were back at their risotto), two people were actually pulling the salad bowl from each other, and these are adults! I did add blue cheese to it, a fantastic combination. I used 3/4 cup walnut oil (expensive, I know, I know -- it was about to expire anyway) and 1/4 cup olive oil. Found the dressing to be perfect, but there seemed to be about twice the amount that I needed. However, I was tasting it as I was making it and I definitely would not reduce the oil. The dressing is surprisingly thick and creamy, after sitting in the cold part of the refrigerator for a few hours, and gorgeously ruby red. I will be making this salad again and again and again!

Rating: 3
Excellent for Thanksgiving. Definitely make the dressing the day before to save your sanity during dinner and to give flavors time to combine.

An all time favorite. Make it all the time, chopping the cranberries while still frozen right out of the freezer with my mini chopper. For really special occasions I'll add spiced/glazed walnuts instead of just toasted ones.

Excellent as is. Also delicious with a crumbled blue-veined cheese, and accompanied by good bread, for a light lunch. Used part walnut oil to add depth to the flavor.

I couldn't disagree more with the reviewer from Vienna. This recipe is a knockout -- I made a veritable mountain of salad for a brunch and it disappeared within minutes, as if sucked into a vacuum. I followed a previous reviewer's suggestion and halved the oil, using olive oil, and the consistency was perfect.

All I could taste was the balsamico. I even added 1/3 more cranberries, but it didn't help. This dressing is boring. There's bound to be a better way to present cranberries.

I made this for Christmas and everyone loved it! I used whole berry cranberry sauce instead of fresh or frozen cranberries and it saved time and made the vinaigrette thicker. If you use the sauce, cut down on the sugar. I also added Craisins and plain goat cheese, and toasted either pecans or walnuts with butter, sugar and pepper. Great!

The presentation was lovely. But when I was done eating it, it seemed all of the pecans were left on the bottom of the plate, and that kinda bugged me.

I've whipped up this salad numerous times in the past year, and everyone loves it-you can sprinkle a bit of blue cheese on it for variation....also, a couple tablespoons of the cranberry dressing when made with olive oil is great tossed over fresh gorgonzola raviolis.
