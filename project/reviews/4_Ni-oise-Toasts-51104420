This one is my new favorite! I made it as an appetizer on diagonally sliced ( to get more surface) rustic French bread. I brushed it with olive oil and grilled it before rubbing the garlic. It's amazing! I thought the cottage cheese/egg salad was sorta strange when I read it, but as it turns out, it's quite good. I added a bit more of the olive mix because I love them and I highly recommend using tuna packed in glass jars. Whole Foods has it. $7. Delicious!!

Doing a little too much multi-tasking as I was putting this one together for lunch! I threw the tomatoes and olives into the mix before I read the part about mashing the egg/cottage cheese mixture. So I ended up simply stirring it all together and piling it on the garlic toast. It was jummy and can't wait to make it again with the more beautiful presentation! Served it with some bib lettuce and from the garden tomatoes on the side for a great hot weather lunch.

Simple and delicious! This evening I shall make these niçoise toasts for the second time after many requests from both my husband and my daughter. I followed the recipe almost exactly though I toasted six pieces of rustic bread. I felt that there was probably more egg 'salad' than necessary but both my husband and my daughter loved it as written.
