very good...substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth as i have a vegetarian in the family...seemed like too liquid, and would probably add more nutmeg and other herbs next time...

I made this for our office Thanksgiving lunch and even parsnip haters were OK with it. I used parley for the green because that's all I had, and it was fine. I also added about a teaspoon of soy sauce, which gave it that certain something - but you'd never guess there was soy sauce in it.

Worked great for a dinner party. The celery root, parsnips and cream sauce were a little too white on white and I was a little nervous about overcompensating with strong celery leaves so I added taragon instead and it worked nicely.

I didn't make this dish but ate it at a friend's home on Christmas Day. I will admit I was very skeptical, since parsnip sounded like an awful vegetable. But I was surprised with how good it tasted.
