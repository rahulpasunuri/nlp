This recipe is amazing. We used a little more orange juice and chicken stock reduced by 1/2 instead of the bouillon, and it turned out great. We also added a finely diced red pepper in after the leek to fill out the chowder a bit. Otherwise it was great.

Patty's Orange Purgatory: Patty sent me home with a care package of her delicious version of this chowder (tilapia instead of red snapper) and three nights later I poached three eggs in it, spooned them over thick slices of Italian bread in a bowl and poured the reheated soup over all. Outrageously good.

I tried to quadruple this recipe but it didn't quite work out. I didn't add all the water but even then it was very watery, and too many tomatoes. If I did it again I would only use 1 large can diced tomatoes, not whole tomatoes, much less water, more potatoes and maybe some corn.

This is not a vegetarian dish. Red Snapper is not a vegetable, and vegetarians do not eat: meat, poultry, fish or seafood. End of story.

We truly enjoyed this chowder. The orange juice and zest were just subtle enough. I could not get fresh snapper, so used rock cod. Too, I used diced canned tomatoes instead of whole and veggie broth instead of bouillon cube and water. Served with a nice crusty french bread it was more than enough for two.

Nice flavor combination in this soup. I substituted red onion for the leek. This soup reminds me of a Caribbean-styled fish stew. It's delicious and healthy. I will add this to my meals-in-under-an-hour repertoire.

Just thought I'd clarify that the reason this recipe turned up in your search for "vegetarian" is because it calls for a vegetarian bullion cube. The quick search just finds recipes that contain the word you enter. I don't think they were trying to claim that fish is a vegetable.

This was nice. I wouldn't have thought to use orange as a flavoring but I liked it, and so did the friends who joined me for dinner last night.

My b-friend went deep sea fishing and we had a freezer full of small filets of red snapper. i went online and found the recipe. he did the preparation and we each enjoyed the recipe very much. great "chowder" consistency. we have to cook it again because we still have about 10lbs of fish. i would double the recipe to make the effort worthwhile.

vegetarian or not, this chowder is excellent. A little more preparation than desired, but the aroma and spicy flavor make it worth the extra time. You can use any fish, not just snapper. excellent for a winter night.

In answer to the above reader, there is a controversial classification for vegetarians called (I believe) Pesca-vegetarian. It refers to vegetarians who eat seafood. Personally I think it's an oxy-moron but there ya go.

I'm sure this recipie is mighty tasty, but it came up in my search for vegetarian entrees and I can assure you that Red Snapper is not a vegetable. Just as a matter of note - vegetarians do not eat fish. (Nor do they eat poultry...)
