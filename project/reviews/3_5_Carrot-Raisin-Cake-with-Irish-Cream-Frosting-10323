I'll be honest, I'm only reviewing the frosting. I used a different recipe for the cupcake portion BUT holy moly was that some amazing frosting. It's light and very smooth. My guests said it was addicting and asked if I had any left over so they could eat it with spoons. This recipe made enough to generously frost 16 cupcakes.

I'm reviewing the frosting as I nicked it for a Guinness gingerbread cake. I was baking for a tee-total, so the Guinness in that cake was replaced with coffee, and the Irish Cream in this frosting was my own home-made, non-alcoholic version. I increased the sugar a little bit to help with stability as the cake had to travel, but otherwise it was as directed, and came out very nicely, if a little bit greasy as it got warmer. Next time I think I'd incorporate some cream cheese to a. help the stability, b. make it even whiter, c. cut down on the greasiness, and d. give it a little tang. As it was, I'd give the frosting 3 forks.

Made recipe but replaced a liitle orange juice with gran marnier. Also cake is very dense and might be a little dry. If you think it is too dry just sprnkle some orange juice over tops of cooked cake halves. Seems to help. I used heavy cream instead of irish cream for icing. I also took shredded ccocanut and dyed it with orang food coloring to top the cake. Great cake. Raves reviews from this one.

Cake was really great, much lighter than the usual carrot cake but filled with the same flavors. I just couldn't bring myself to not having cream cheese frosting, however, I used the Bailey's instead of the vanilla extract in the standard cream cheese frosting recipe.

I made this for Father's Day for my Dad & husband. It was delicious! I was nervous because I'm not a baker & haven't made a cake in years! But, it turned out very moist and got rave reviews around the table. I forgot to go to the liquor store on Saturday for the Irish Cream (and of course they are closed on Sundays!) & used heavy cream instead and added a little vanilla. I did add extra carrots, walnuts & 1/2 cup more sugar. Very tasty & moist cake. I'll make it again & this time remember the trip to the liquor store!

I made used this icing on another epicurious.com carrot cake (the reviews for that one said it was moist - and it was!) That said, the Irish cream frosting was SO good! I have made it twice and got rave reviews. Highly recommended.

I'm sorry that so many people have had problems with this but glad I didn't read the reviews until I had already decided to make this cake for Easter this year. I took everyone's advice (added about 1/2 cup more brown sugar than it called for, added about 1/2 cup more carrots, added some chopped walnuts, no salt in the frosting and frosted the top instead of decorating with sugar. The cake turned out wonderfully! Everyone at Easter dinner absolutely LOVED it.

I think this is missing some sugar. The cake was very dense.

The cake was a little drier and perhaps a little more dense than other carrot cakes I have made. It was very good, but seemed to be missing something, perhaps chopped walnuts. I would suggest frosting the whole top rather than only a decoration around the edge.

The cake was dry and the icing was far too salty (and I used unsalted butter!) I adore carrot cake and irish cream, but this particular recipe was disappointing.

An absolute delight of a cake. My cakes are probably nicer though. What's a cup?

WHAT AM I DOING WRONG??? I tried this recipe for an Easter Dinner for 16. What an embarrassment! Thank goodness I had several other desserts available. It was...dense, solid as a rock. And after refridgeration, difficult to cut! O.K. so I did something wrong. I tried it again in the privacy of my immediately family...better, but not a light and airy cake as I had hoped for. I'm considering the 'three strikes your out' approach, as ALL the other reviewers loved this recipe.

I didn't frost this cake and it still tasted quite nice. Will try again for special events but must look for recipes with not so much butter or so many eggs for those other times.

The best carrot cake on earth. The Irish Creme frositng defintely made this cake a hit for my Father's birthday Instead of using the powdered sugar on top, I cut a heart out of paper & sifted cinnamon sugar on top of the frosting. My Mother was so impressed she took photographs of the cake! Not bad for a novice baker who had to go out and buy cake pans.

Although I am not a carrot cake fan, I made this recipe for family. I tried a small piece and LOVED IT! This is not a dense, heavy cake. My variation: Rather than sprinking powdered sugar over the top, I put a thin layer of frosting on the top. Then I colored shredded coconut and sprinkled it all over the top of the cake. I piped the remaining frosting into scallops around the edges with a star tip. Keep in mind: frosting gets soft very quickly due to the high butter content.
