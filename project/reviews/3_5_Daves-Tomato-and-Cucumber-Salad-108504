This is a refreshing and healthy hot weather salad that goes great with Middle Eastern dishes. The cumin and lemon both give it a memorable tang. Be forewarned, it makes enough to feed the entire Israeli army and the salt makes the veggies sweat and soften so it doesn't keep well for more than a day. It's ideal for any gathering with lots of people so it gets finished quickly when it's at its best.

Lovely refreshing salad, the parsley is a fine addition. Much quicker to make then the review says too.

I rate this recipe four forks because of the simplicity of the recipe and flavors of the cumin, parsely and tomatoes (went with the roma tomatoes and removed the seeds. This dish pairs well with Hummus for a great light lunch or dinner! Don't skimp of the extra virgin olive oil :o)

eigna1 - it will be fine for at least a couple of days. Salads with leaves don't keep (the leaves go soggy) but this one will be fine.

I want to make this as a snack for work. Does anyone know if I can make this ahead of time (e.g. night before)? How long will it last?

This is kind of a "no fail" salad. I used 1/4C olive oil and white balsamic vinegar, less salt and 1 clove minced garlic. Instead of chopping cukes, I sliced them thinly, wedged the tomatoes and thinly sliced red sweet onion. I think the larger pieces of veggies are prettier than chopped. I also added about 8 sliced red radishes. I think celery and maybe carrots would be a nice addition also. Next time I will try cilantro which we love.

I totally forgot the onion too... Added garlic and ditched the vinegar. Very good salad, reminded me of Greek salad.

Delicious, festive looking, easy to make. I will definitely serve this at family cookouts, but it was great as a side dish for a Friday night supper.

It's an Israeli salad. In my family we eat it every night. Forget the vinegar, you can add some garlic if you like, scallions are ok but stick with vegetables and avoid adding carbs.

I'm laughing as i'm writing this a day later because I totally forgot the onion! But this was still great! I skipped the vinegar because the lemon was enough for me and I did the toasted sesame seeds as suggested. One thing I might do next time is seed the tomato a bit, there was alot of liquid in the dish...although, I don't think I got down to a 1/3" dice so perhaps that would solve things...

Added boiled red potatoes. Potatoes, tomatoes, cukes cut into bite sized peices. Used seasoned rice wine vinegar and apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar. Added green onions. YUMMY!!!

So good! I made this for a quick throw-together dinner for some coworkers and they loved it so much I sent them home with the recipe. The cumin was a really delicious addition. Yum! Definitely making over and over again.

This was a great way to use all the fresh cucumbers and tomatoes from the garden! The cumin made it very unique. I took another reviewer's advice and used rice vinegar, but I would just do a splash next time cause it was a touch too vinegary. I also used shallots instead of onion, fresh basil (also from the garden) instead of parsley and threw in some toasted pine nuts and cubed fresh mozzarela (all from previous reviews). It was very fresh and delicious! Great summer side dish!!

I added about a cup of zucchini cut up into small pieces to this salad. A really yummy and delicious salad.

Pretty easy to prepare - lots of chopping which is fun anyway. I subbed cilantro for the curly parsley, and also added finely diced celery. Feel free to chop up some scallions to toss in, or some really hot peppers. It's kind of hard to screw this one up!

I've made a few changes to this recipe that I like quite alot. Use seasoned rice wine vinegar and soy bean oil to replace the like items. Use cilantro instead of the parsley. Nix the cumin. Add a touch of dry mustard, a touch of sesame oil, a tablespoon of hoisin sauce and 4 tablespoons sugar to the dressing. The I also like to add about 3/2 cups of 1/3-inch diced scarmorza or smoked mozzarella.

I made this the other day for a party. I used fresh heirloom tomatoes and cukes from my garden and thought this might be a nice change from the normal salad fare. My friends enjoyed the salad quite a bit, but it wasn't a "WOW" recipe, thus the three rating. Definitely worth making, though, and I will certainly keep it in the cycle. Oh, and I used the white balsamic vinegar some people recommended--next time I think I'll try the distilled white vinegar, since I think the lemon juice would soften the kick of that a little bit, plus, I think with the white vinegar, it might have a nice, clean bite that's lacking without it. Just a thought...

It's a Middle Eastern salad. Leave out the vinegar or just a splash of balsamic.

My daughter is on meds that prevent her eating green leafy vegetables and she misses her lettuce in salads, but this made her stop complaining! It's great and tasty. I added a little chopped fresh coriander and oregano to my own plate to pump it up.

We tried this recipe to taste and ended up eating the entire thing! We added a tablespoon of sugar and a splash of balsamic and it was absoutely amazing. It was fresh and not acidy at all. The dressing only enhanced the wonderful flavor of the cucumbers! Perfect for a side dish!!!!

This was a very nice salad. I'm wasn't too sure about the white distilled vinegar though. I only use it to de-scale my coffee pot! But I tried it and it was nice. I think next time I may be bold and try red wine vinegar!

I thought this recipe was amazing. I took someone elses advice and used white balsamic vinegar and I also added chunks of mozzarella cheese to it. This is a definite keeper!

This is a variation on Israeli Salad. Eliminate the vinegar. Toasted Sunflower seeds, pine nuts or sesame seeds make the salad crunchy.

I used rice vinegar, left out the cumin, added toasted sesame seeds and a tiny bit of sesame oil. It was delish!

A nice touch on a classic salad, with the cumin adding an interesting twist to the flavors. If you can find it, white balsamic vinegar makes this dish outstanding

Other than being a too vinegary, this recipe was nothing special.
