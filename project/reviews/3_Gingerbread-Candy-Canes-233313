These cookies were very good, especially since ginger can be too strong. I also had to make them thicker and only cook them for 6 minutes so they would not burn. I also iced half of them and used a little maple syrup to complement the ginger taste.

I changed a few things and they turned out great. I lowered the cooking temp. to 350, made the cookies thicker, cooked them for 12 minutes and decorated them using royal icing instead of sugar only. They were great this way. When I did it as per the recipe the exact way, they were a bit bland with just the sugar on top and were hard and over cooked. Kids really did enjoy helping and using different cookie cutter shapes.

I thought the consistency was great. Very easy to roll out and maintained shape nicely. They were very popular here in the Middle-east!

Bland, bland, bland. I added a little nutmeg, but I should have added more. I thought the cloves would do the trick, but I was wrong. Also, my cookies that were at the bottom burned. Add a lot more spices and they might be ok.
