Either this recipe is off or I screwed up. The sauce came out exceedingly tart and thin (so thin it didn't stick to the pasta, so only the mushrooms and flowers got the flavor). I think the broth and mushroom water should probably be added and reduced before the cream. I'd probably double the cream to get a thicker, creamier texture (the sauce as prepared was practically a liquid).

This recipe didn't work for me. I omitted the morels and nasturtiums, so I really think that if someone is going to make this, it would be important to make the original recipe because otherwise--as in my case--it is pretty dull, save for the unpleasant acidity (in my opinion) from the wine and lemon.

I didn't care for the lemon juice in this recipe. Also the sauce was very soupy, though after sitting for a day with the pasta it was absorbed and tasted much better.

Really tasty. I also used porcini mushrooms for lack of morels. I thought there was more than enough sauce, it seemed like a lot of juice to swirl the butter into, also it's very rich! I had a bit of sauce leftover. Just the right amount of pasta for an appetizer (I served 7)

Awesome. I've made this a number of times and it is always devoured. I did increase the liquid because we like it extra sauce. I also didn't use the nasturtiums just because I can't find them around me. Good eats!

Amazing! I have made this several times, for large parties as an appetizer, and also as a main course. The morels give the sauce a wonderful flavor, and the other ingredients make for a very colorful and attractive presentation.

We loved this recipe. I couldn't find morels so used porcini mushrooms, I also used fettucine. I expected the nasturtiums to be picked out on the side of half the plates but everyone loved them! This has a nice variety of textures and I will make it every year when my nasturtiums bloom.

Very nice starter. It was light and very flavorful. My guests loved it. The sauce was really only enough for six servings, though.
