Bland and awful. I'll never make this again. I used everything in the recipe, plus I added broccoli, asparagus tips, baby carrots, and sugar snap peas, along with soy- I doubled the garlic and it still had no flavor. So many easier and tastier stir fry recipes out there, don't waste your time on this one.

This is labor intensive; however, I don't know what y'all are talking about with it being bland. I like a lot of flavor, so I added a bit more salt, pepper, and garlic than the recipe calls for. One could add more ginger as well for more kick. I made it, and it was great!

Bland! Also labor intensive since this recipe requires everything to be stir-fried separately. Far from the best stir fry recipe I've ever found. I even added oyster sauce & soy but it still lacked flavor and depth.

I used mostly sesame oil to stir fry rather than vegetable and soy sauce rather than salt. I also added carrots, baby corn, and ALOT more cilantro for flavor. I was disappointed with the bean noodles. I must've had the wrong size because they just turned into mush. Luckily, I had some ramen noodles that went really well with the recipe. I would make the dish again with either glass noodles or rice. Overall, the recipe was VERY tasty, and I'd make it again.

a bit labor intensive. Could use a bit more spice. I used more sesame oil, garlic and ginger but it was still lacking.

Swapped tofu for the shrimp, and canola oil for the peanut oil. Omitted the lime, cilantro, and jicama. Overall excellent

Very bland, I added chili paste and soy sauce and it was still bland. Also, although I love jicima, it just didn't work.

Simple & tasty recipe. I substituted the bak choy & mushrooms with broccoli & carrots. Boiled the vegetables & prawns in water, adding salt for flavour & to keep the prawns plump. Added Pam's bottled crush chilli paste instead. Drizzled with spring onions instead of cilantro & jicama. Used instant dried egg noodles. Yum!

This dish was very bland, even though I added chili garlic paste. I made it with sauteed tofu instead of shrimp, regular bok choy, and added yellow peppers. I thought the noodles would be nice and tasty having cooked in the chicken broth but there just wasn't much going on. Maybe some fish sauce or soy sauce added to the broth would have helped, but I don't care to try again.

yum! this is a great recipe. the flavors are great and it ends up with a nice spicy taste. I personally recomend using more shrimp and i think next time i will use some bean curd.

Delicious. Replaced the bok choy with carrots and yellow peppers and skipped the cilantro (because I didn't have any on hand). Next time, will toss the noodles with oil before serving to prevent clumping.

This recipe was ok. The flavor wasn't bad. Didn't add the jicama. Couldn't find the 1/8 - 1/4" wide bean thread noodles. Used the thinner ones and they tasted like gummy bears.

Good base recipe but I agree with the cook who said that some red peppers julienned will add something extra, I also julienned some zuchinni and added a bit of spicy szechwan sauce to the veggies. Cooking the noodles in the broth is a great way to thinken the sauce. I will definitely make this again!

Although I'm marking this dish with three forks, I'd give it four if one left out the jicama or used it more sparingly. The shrimp tasted particularly delicious. I believe that simmering the dish, covered, for a few extra minutes on a low heat helped the other ingredients absorb the broth, onion, and red pepper seasonings. Since I'm not a big cilantro fan, I just used a dash of the dried stuff as a garnish in lieu of the large amount of fresh cilantro listed. Using 1/2 tsp. dried ginger, lower-salt broth, and extra mushrooms were my only other changes.

The only problem I had with this dish was the amount of jicama - we all found it overwhelming. Next time I will reduce it by more thank half. Also, when baby bok choy is unavailable I always add regular bok and add the leaves just moments before tremoving wok from heat. By the way, never use hot pepper flakes on anything but pizza. Sub chili paste or Sichuan hot paste, etc. Will try this again and hope to up this to 3 forks.

This recipe is good, I think that next time I would add a red bell pepper or a julienne of carrot for color & sweetness because with just the bok choy it was a bit bland,also would add in addition to the sesame oil some MAGGI sauce for more flavor.

A question to those who have made this correctly; what did you do with the bok choy leaves? I don't see how this recipe could be made without the bok choy, but I'd consider leaving the leaves on (they've got the most flavor/nutrition anyway) Any thoughts?

Next time I will cut the noodles, they were a bit long!! I used regular bok choy, and love the addition of jicama. A good dish for days when you want something light.

I added garlic-chili sauce to the broth and garlic mixture. This added a pleasant punch. My family enjoyed the dish and have requested it on several occasions.

Didn't like this recipe. I left out the baby bok choy, but I don't think it would've helped. The sauce lacked flavour and oomph! I've had much better noodle recipes!
