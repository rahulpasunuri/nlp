Found this recipe because I specifically needed one for shoulder lamb chops. Not known for being tender, the marinating in lemon juice for a few hours made these ultra tender. Followed idea from the Texas cook and added a combination of suggested spices to the dry rub. Made that dish much tastier than the orginal recipe would have been. Raves!

I added garlic powder, sea salt, peppercorns, oregano and cumin seeds to the rub mixture along with the coriander and pepper flakes. It was exquisite!

Though it was an easy to make recipe, I too was not impressed...and I added garlic.

Really tasty, very easy, not boring at all. Definitely a do-over

This was DELICIOUS!!! I added a lot more garlic and more dried chili flakes. The recipe is so simple and the result is terrific. I served the lamb chops with some creamy corn polenta.

For an easy, middle-of-the-week recipe this was quite good. I had thinner lamb chops, so just pan-fried them. The coriander gave it a nice crunch.

Big waste of a good lamb chop...would have been better with straight salt and pepper!

Absolutely boring. Don't bother.
