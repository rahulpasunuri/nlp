Very nice for a week night.

Only made the roasted eggplant which was wonderful. I salted the eggplant for 30 minutes to draw out the bitterness -- rinsed and proceeded with the recipe. The olive oil and sherry vinegar makes this recipe. In place of feta cheese I served the eggplant with drizzled sour cream that had a squeeze of lemon juice, salt and minced onions. Will make again.

This was perfect as is (and great with simple couscous, as suggested.) I also like the idea of adding some onions and maybe peppers. But for the garlic, I am curious as to how others added this...as whole cloves, to roast with the eggplant? Or did you roast it separately and add it later? Or was it peeled? Just loved it!

I followed some others tips of adding fresh herbs and garlic which was great. I also made this dish into a sandwich with the addition of a few thin slices of prosciutto on toasted roll. Yumm!

Healthy, delicious and easy. Like others, I added garlic and rosemary. The whole house smelled wonderful while this was roasting in my oven. I doubled the recipe for 8 guests, and there wasn't a drop left.

Delicious! Light, healthy, quick, and easy. Instead of fresh tomatoes, I used a drained can of tomatoes. Also added thyme, an onion and a few cloves of garlic. Would definitely make it again.

I have made this twice. First time I made it exactly per recipe for a party. It was delicious served over couscous at room temperature. Second time I added a can of garbanzos and more tomatoes and cooked for only 30 minutes. I think it's tasty but could use more spice. I might add additional vegetables, more oil and vinegar. I will also reduce the cooking time further. Overall, a recipe that's perfect for personalization.

This was wonderful! I served it with some bread and the Orzo with Feta, Tomatoes and Dill recipe from this site--I just cut back on the feta in both so it wouldn't be overwhelming. The whole family loved it, even the ten month old!

Yum yum! the second time around I had to make some changes to use what I had on hand. I used a mix of herbs (oregano, basil and parsley) and added some olive bc I only had goat cheese which doesn't have the tanginess that feta cheese has. I served it w some israeli couscous. Delicious! I think, this dish can be taken in many directions! capers maybe?

Wow! This recipe was truly amazing!! Instead of serving it over couscous, I used it as the topping for bruschette. Everything the same as in the recipe except I used basil instead of oregano (didn't have any). For the bruschette, used a baguette, cut up in 1/2 inch slices, toasted in the oven, and covered with olive oil and crushed garlic as the base. When the crostini were toasted, I topped them with the eggplant/tomato mixture as per this recipe. At the very end, I crumbled the feta cheese on top of the crostini. Unbelievable!! I wish I had made more. This makes a fabulous appetiser and so much easier than the 'eggplant bruschette' recipe on here (which is ridiculously time-consuming). Have resolved to make this again as soon as possible to serve as an appetizer at my next dinner-party.

So fast and easy! I added some minced garlic and used red wine vinegar, and serve with couscous and a bit of fresh basil from the garden. I only baked it for 20 minutes at 450, and it was perfect.

Wow. Can't understand the low reviews. Made this with canned tomatoes and dried oregano at the last minute, tossed it with israeli couscous, and it was outstanding - healthy and delicious! My husband proposed making it a weekly staple.

Disappointing--even with a bit of garlic and kalamata olives, this dish lacked seasoning--or something to give it some pizzazz.

Made this with some of my home-grown eggplant and tomatoes earlier this year. I was a little underwhelmed by it - it was lacking something for me. It was quick and easy, though, and I'll make it again but I'll probably find something to add to it for flavor (maybe some Kalamata olives as someone else did).

I loved this dish!!! It is so easy and really delicious. I loved it so much I made it again the following week too. I served it over quinoa instead of couscous. Either would be good I just like the health benefits of the quinoa.

This recipe was great. I actually used a combination of goat cheese and feta cheese crumbles and sprinkled that with some Italian bread crumbs which baked very nicely and gave the top a little crunch.

I made this recipe for a party and included the suggestions of adding garlic and rosemary (I did half oregano and half rosemary). I parboiled the plum tomatoes for a minute and skinned them. Finally I served it over a bed of orzo. It was a big hit!

I didn't think this was a very special dish. It was okay, but I would not make it again.

Such an easy and tasty side dish - - I added garlic and rosemary. It only took about 30 minutes at 400 degrees.

This was a great dish. We had it as a side dish, but would make a hearty vegetarian dinner.

I took this to a Greek themed potluck at our church, and it went over very well. I substituted soft goat cheese for a portion of the Feta called for, and I added some pitted calmata olives and a couple cloves of garlic.

Made this as part of a Greek-themed dinner. It was good and guests liked it - very simple to prepare. Just looking for a way to use up eggplant, wich is not one of my favorite vegetables.

Terrific recipe. Everyone loved it, including the kids. Recommend it highly as part of any mezze party or meal:-)

I made the recipe with the suggestions mentioned above: olives, zuc, onion, garlic. I had a few changes I made though. I used balsalmic vinegar instead of sherry and since the grocery store was out of oregeno we used rosemary. IT WAS AMAZING! I could not make this again without the rosemary. I highly recommend that. We served it on a bed of couscous and my husband could not stop saying how much he loved it!

My family and I really liked this recipe. I added zucchini because I had way too many in my garden, and that worked well. I used only half of the feta and thought that it was plenty. Also, I cooked mine for about 50 minutes and thought that less may have been under done. Overall, I think that this is a delicious and easy summer side.

I added zucchini and it was the hit of the party! We used it as a main dish for a Mediterranean Theme and everyone raved! The Sherry Vinegar is worth hunting for!

Wonderful receipe. Even if you don't like eggplant you will love this!

I tried this primarily in order to make use of eggplant (one of our least favorite vegetables in the organic bin we have delivered weekly). I, too, added zucchini, onion, red and orange peppers, and kalamata olives, increasing the dressing a bit because of increased volume (and decreasing cooking time as others suggested) and OH MY was it ever divine! Now we'll be buying eggplant if it doesn't come in the bin!

Holy rockin eggplant! this is amazing and I've been telling everyone to make this dish. Total yummers

I thought that this was a simple a flavourful way to use eggplant, and would not hesitate to make it again. I took the suggestion of some other reviews and added quartered red onion, as well as some zucchini. Per the suggestion written above the recipe, I served the vegetables atop couscous. I used the "Grilled Shrimp and Vegetables with Pearl Couscous" couscous recipe from epicurious, omitting the the shrimp and grilled veggies for the vegetables from this recipe I'm reviewing. All in all, everything was delicious and I would recommend it without reservation for a simple week-night meal.

We love this recipe. It tastes very hearty and works really well as a main course with the couscous. we will definitely make it again!!!

Don't let this sit! Made these for a date tonight and while we were talking I didn't pay attention to it. You really need to stir it from time to time to make sure it doesn't stick. Turned out to be a overcooked and stuck on mess. Fortunately the other item I made her turned out great so in the end she was still impressed. Will try this one again.

I forgot to add the vinegar, and although the vegetables stuck more to the pan, the flavor was still wonderful. So easy, flavorful, and healthy!

Easy and simple. Made with dried oregano and didn't have any feta. Still great and healthy.

So easy and tasty. It was done a little quicker than stated in the recipe (about 30 minutes i found), but I had to convert the temp into Celsius for my oven (I could have been slightly off). Used Cherry tomatoes and dried Oregano...it was just fabulous.I will definitely make this again.

This was delicious and easy. Vegetables were done in about 30 minutes. I had to use the mediocre roma tomatoes we have available in winter here and the roasting elevated them to something much better than I expected. Will definately make again.
