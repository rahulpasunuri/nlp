This was really tasty. The marmalade gave it a nice twist on the regular carrot cake taste and it was super moist. I actually made only a quarter of the frosting and made these as muffins/cupcakes instead of a regular cake. Even with only a quarter of the frosting, there was plenty to cover all the cupcakes -- it made 30. I would definitely make this again and maybe try out a regular cake next time--although the cupcakes were great too!

I normally do not like carrot cakes but it was Father's Day and my dad loves them. I used hazlenuts instead of walnuts and the cake was very good (for a carrot cake.) I cut down the amount of powdered sugar in icing. I will make it again (for dad).

Nice cake! Good to have an alternative that doesn't require pineapple. I cut the sugar to about 1 cup total and substituted 1/4 c agave syrup. Also added 1 cup coconut to the cake batter.

Best carrot cake that i've ever made! Extremely moist and light. Will definitely make it again and again....

The trick is don't use sour marmalade like Seville Orange marmalade.

p.s. I was worried enough about the marmalade that I used "sweet orange marmalade". I was a little afraid it would be bitter otherwise... T'was delish!

OK. I am not the carrot cake fan in the family. It's my husbands fave, so I usually make one for his birthday. I tend to find them a little bland, and I overcompensate by eating a little bite of cake with a big dollop of cream cheese frosting. This was not the case when I made this recipe last Friday night. The cake itself was really moist - but still had really good flavor. I admit I didn't add the nuts to the cake batter - my sis won't eat them - but I did toast them and place them on top where they could be easily avoided. I was nervous about the frosting because my husband isn't a marmalade fan plus he tends to be a purist, but I should not have worried. It was all I could do to keep him from rolling around in it while I was frosting the cake - and the leftover frosting went into a little tub in the fridge (thought it'd be fab on pumpkin muffins), which grew emptier & emptier by the day (until it was completely empty that is). I definitely recommend this recipe if you're in the market for a carrot cake.

This cake was fantastic. Some of the reviewers said theirs turned out bitter but mine certainly didn't. I used Smucker's Simply Fruit instead of marmalade so perhaps that made a difference. I also added raisins soaked in Grand Marnier.

I have made this cake for years and I love, love, love it. However, I sometimes agree that it can be a little "bitter"/sharp with the marmalade. I think it depends on the type of marmalade that you use..some do tend to be more bitter than others. That being said..My Mother told me once that HER carrot cake receipe was better than this..so we had a "bake off". Actually, she made this cake for my Husband's birthday and also adjusted it to be glueton free and the concensus was that this receipe was far superior to hers..even glueton free.. Anyway. I'm making it again for a family reunion and am going to substitute Pecans for the Walnuts and will try using crushed pinapple with the marmalade, just to see how it tastes. I will post my results.

Best carrot cake ever! I don't like walnuts so I omitted them. I also really like frosting so I covered the entire cake the second time I made it. Love it! Love it!! Love it!!!

I loved the recipe and thought it was delicious, though I wouldn't recommend making it with the marmalade. I thought the marmalade made the cake taste a little bitter, and I don't think it contribuited positively to the cake's taste. Other than the marmalade, it was great.

My Mother made this cake for my birthday recently. I don't usually like carrot cake because it tends to be heavy and a bit greasy. This cake was wonderful -- nice and light and not a bit greasy. I will make it for my next party.

Was looking for a good carrot cake recipe for my mother's 70th birthday--this really wowed her. I cheated and used a boxed carrot cake mix but added the oj in lieu of water and then the raisins, walnuts and extra carrots. I also used no-sugar marmalade for the cake and frosting. The cake was divine and the frosting is the perfect ompliment. The recipe makes way more then needed though and agree with others that you could cut the cream cheese in half.

This recipe is so delicious! I've made it for birthdays, and anniversry parties, and family get togethers! Make the cake a day before to let the marmalade moisten, but really really good!

The marmalade-cream cheese frosting is heavenly!! Made a different cake recipe for a friend's birthday (her request), and used this frosting with it. Will never use another! I cut the amount of confectioner's sugar down to 1 1/2 C., so it came out a little softer than it might have otherwise. Everyone loved it, and I can't wait to make it again!

Made this for my mother-in-law's 83rd birthday. Every one loved the flavor and raved about the icing. Wish I had'nt added so much of the orange juice as it never really firmed up enough and it made way too much. maybe cut down on the cream cheese and orange juice in the future

This is just an okay recipe. There is a much better version in The New Basics Cookbook, which includes crushed pineapple and shredded coconut and is really yummy. I was hoping for a lighter version and that's way I gave this a try.The orange marmalade does nothing for this recipe, and is actually distracting from the flavor of the cake, imparting a slightly bitter taste. Even after an hour in the refrigerator, the icing was not stiff enough to hold the sides of the cake without sliding down. Overall, disappointing.My advice, keep looking and skip this one!

I made this cake with the coconut cream cheese frosting (from this site) for my mom's birthday. Wow! Great! The orange flavor is really enhanced by a day or so in the refrigerator, so I recommend making it in advance.

I have made this cake since it appeared in the 1993 issue of Bon Appetit and have never looked at another carrot cake again. It always gets a "Wow!" from whatever occasion or party I make it for. For a variatioin can use other types of Jams, such as Apricot, Apricot/Pinapple, Apple or even Spreadable fruits or Sugar Fee jams. It's a crowd pleaser and makes a beautiful presentation.

Fantastic, Moist. I heated the marmalade and added a little corn syrup and spread some over the cake layers before I iced the cake. WOW what flavor!

I've been making this cake since the recipe was first published. Since I couldn't make it home for Thanksgiving last week (2004), I made it and had it shipped overnight. They loved it!!

I definitely like the idea of citrus with carrot. The cake itself came together beautifully and was not too sweet, which is nice, since the frosting is pretty sweet. I can see how people would interpret the flavor of the frosting as being similar to cheesecake. When making the frosting, I decided to add a teaspoon of vanilla, which lent the frosting more of a "dreamsicle" flavor rather than that cheesecakey thing mentioned, which was lovely. Overall, I think it is a good recipe, although the frosting is definitely gooey and not the most spreadable. :()mMmmMmmmMmmMMm

This is a great carrot cake. I just made this cake for my anniversary and took the leftovers to work--to rave reviews and many recipe requests. I didn't have the marmalade, so I left it out. But the orange juice was crucial for adding a bit of brightness. I let the cake set overnight, wrapped in plastic, then frosted it. I really think it helped it to be even moister. I did not use the frosting recipe, however. I have a great one from The New Basics cookbook: 8oz cream cheese, 6T sweet butter, 1t vanilla, 3c. powdered sugar, then a dash of fresh lemon juice. (I also added a bit of OJ.) Just chill it for 30 minutes and it's perfect. Enjoy!

Made this 4 times. My wife didn`t care for the orange marmalade, so I have changed it to apricot preserves. Instead of orange juice, apricot nectar. Works well. Note: Let this cake set covered tightly in the fridge a day or so before serving. It gets better with a little age.

Everyone raved about this cake. Very moist and I liked the orange tang. I will make this again but next time for my taste I will use 1/2 the butter.

After reading the glowing reviews, I was very disappointed with this cake. I used very good marmalade, and found the cake was not sweet enough to support the intensity of it. I found the cake texture to be heavy, with not much flavor. The frosting was too cheesy, and as most complained, very soft. I should have followed the directions to leave out the butter. Following the decorating directions, the cake came out very pretty. I will keep looking for the perfect carrot cake recipe, but will definately file away the decorating directions. This sounded great, but let us down.

My first carrot cake and it was a success! I halved the recipe to make it one-layer. Didn't care much for the frosting, though - it tasted more like cheesecake filling that what I would consider frosting.

The marmelade makes this cake! Very nice flavor. I successfully halved the recipe and made a one-layer cake, which I frosted. I didn't have trouble with the frosting being too soft, but I omitted the butter (didn't see the need for it) and it tasted great.

I made this recipe for my 1 year old daughter's bday too! It was delicious...I added raisins and substituted 1/3 of the oil with applesauce. It turned out very moist. I frosted it with regular cream cheese frosting to save time...but also added a creative touch to the top: I melted white chocolate chips, added some red food coloring to make the mixture pink, put it in a ziplock, snipped the corner a little and "wrote": HAPPY BIRTHDAY ELLY on waxed paper, put it in the freezer for 10 minutes...peeled them off and stood them UP on top around the cake. It was a big hit!

This got a thumbs up from my family at a recent dinner party. The orange marmalade really makes this carrot cake. I skipped the chilling of the icing step and it got a little runny--I'll definitely chill it for 20-30 minutes next time. Also the presentation was beautiful.

I added 2 Tbl. flour for high altitude and it worked great. I did a 3 layer 8" and still had too much frosting even after decorating as instructed. I will reduce the frosting by 1/4 next time. I added 1/2 c. raisins-I love raisins in carrot cake! Next time I will omit the 1/4 c. marmalade before frosting the first layer. It makes it a little difficult to spread the frosting and it seems to be overkill w/marmalade in the frosting and the cake. It was a fun presentation, easy and DELICIOUS!

I am still looking for the definitive carrot cake -this isn't it but it is good. It has a nice texture (firmer) and isn't as oily as some. I did change the recipe somewhat, I didn't use the nuts and I baked it in a 9x13 pan. For the frosting, I reduced it by using only 1 pkg of cream cheese and I ran out of marmalade so I used a splash of Grand Marnier.
