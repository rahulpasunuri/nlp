This recipe is fantastic. I have made it a couple times, once with the white chocolate and once without. I don't think it really needs it. Just a bit of vanilla in the cream is great. The last time I made it I didn't bother with cutting the biscuits out, just rolled it out and baked it as a sheet and then cut it up at the end. Honestly when it's covered in berries you can't tell what shape it is, especially if you're serving it to your half lit friends on the dark patio. For times when neater presentation is required though, I recommend following the recipe. It's very pretty.

An impressive company dessert because the biscuits are more like true shortcakes. I used farm fresh berries that had been frozen earlier in the summer. Chocolate cream adds the right touch.

Strawberry shortcake has always been a big favorite in our family. The white chocolate cream fancies it up a bit! I made the shortcake biscuits with Bisquick. The recipe's right on the box. It makes the dish really quick and easy.

I love intricate baking recipes but this dessert is more trouble than it's worth. The biscuits were tasty, but so easily breakable that the presentation was horrible. And the dessert doesn't stay fresh at all - after about 20 minutes everything was soggy.

Great dessert! White chocolate cream was delicious and the blueberry syrup was amazing with the shortcakes. Don't skip the raw sugar topping on the shortcakes. This one is a keeper!

I only made the cream, I assume that it is not supposed to thicken? I ended up whipping it after it totally cooled, served it over the berries. It was delicious, but it would have been very runny if I had not whipped it.

We made this with freshly picked strawberries and it was phenomenal! The cream alone is perfect for dipping fresh fruit, and it nicely complimented the texture and flavor of the shortcakes. The cakes were a little difficult to cut in half, they all split in at least one place.
