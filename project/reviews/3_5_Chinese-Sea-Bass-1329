Great recipe. Will certainly do again. I used the sauce sparingly as I did not want to over power the sea bass. Perfect, as good as dining out!

This was super-easy and tasted amazing. The only ingredient I didn't have on hand was cornstarch, so I substituted tapioca flour in the same amount. Perfection!

This was a wonderful dish. Confession - I didn't have cornstarch. So I used flour and mixed it in to the chicken stock before adding it to the garlic and ginger. I also added some toasted sesame seeds and a little chopped basil at the end. Poured over Chilean Sea Bass - it really was easy and very tasty. I served it with jasmine rice (with some red pepper flakes for a little kick) and sauteed asparagus. Btw, I keep my pepper flakes in a pepper mill so I have a finer flake rather than just dumping it from a jar (I know a lot of people already do this , but for those that don't - just a thought)

This was outstanding! I doubled all ingredients to have extra sauce (wonderful on the rice too) and added some miso paste to taste while making the sauce. I also think cooking the garlic and ginger is sesame oil is a must ~ just for the added sesame flavor. I used bottled pre-chopped garlic and fresh minced ginger, so prep-time for the sauce was only about 15 minutes for measuring & cooking. I had two nice thick pieces of Chilean Sea Bass and 3 minutes per side was the perfect amount of cook time (basting each piece when turned over). Cooked start to finish in under 30 minutes ~ a dream for a week night! Will definitely make again!

An incredubly delicious meal! I recommend this sauce to be put on anything! I put the sauce on tilapia (couldn't find sea bass) and a tiny bit on my side of sauteed vegetables. Served over rice. LOVE IT!

Incredibly easy, full flavored dish. Made even tastier by substituting sherry for the cider vinegar!

Delicious and very easy. I added 1 T. of miso to the sauce as well and served it over rice mixed with sauteed peppers, garlic and onions. My company loved the dish. I had doubled the sauce but have tons left over. Very pretty to serve to guests.

I was disappointed by the sauce. It got very thick quickly, and remained in a gelatinous lump on the fish. It was tasteless, and my 3-year-old daughter asked, "What's so stinky?" while I was cooking it.

Great, east recipe, especially if you have all the ingredients in the cabinet! We were missing the ginger, but we just added a little more garlic, and it was delicious. Would definately try again.

This recipe is great and SO easy. I didn't use quite as much corn starch as suggested, and the sauce was still great. A great recipe to make in a time crunch.

My husband, who is usually indifferent to food in general, made a point of saying he loved the sauce. I served this with "Mushroom Medley w/Spinach, Ginger and Soy" which I thought complemented it well, even though both use mainly ginger and soy for flavor.

Good work horse sauce. It is very flexible. Goes great on anything needing to be called "Chinese". For instance; chinese chicken, chinese shrimp, chinese steak, chinese vegetables, chinese yak tougne etc, etc. Just add the magic sauce above and it is Chinese. (and good too!)

Tasty, very reminiscent of hot and sour soup, but the cornstarch gave the sauce the gloppy consistency of mediocre takeout Chinese food. I'd cut down on the cornstarch mixture or up the other ingredients.

This dish was delicious! I served it with braised string beans which added color. However, several local food stores no longer carry sea bass, and so it was difficult to come by. When I found the fish, it was pricy, but oh so tasty!

Excellent and easy recipe. I tried the sherry as suggested by the cook from Denver and it was excellent!

This is a delicious and simple preparation for sea bass, but I would recommend that you use cooking sherry in place of the cider vinegar.
