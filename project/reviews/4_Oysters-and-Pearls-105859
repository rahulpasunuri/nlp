The most decadent dish I've made in long time - super creamy, subtle and rich. I was amazed at how well the tapioca complements the oysters' flavor (and plan to use instant tapioca or tapioca flour to thicken oyster stew in the future). The proportions and serving size are just right -- this is rich and you don't need/want a lot. For those of us with less time, I think the steps for the custard could be simplified a bit without sacrificing flavor (though it won't be as light and pre-soaking the tapioca is still mandatory).

oh ya might want to tag team the whisking of the eggs. 3 minutes is a really long ...who know... mine took more like 4 minutes. Totally worth it.

OMG OMG OMG Oysters. Do not skip the caviar...all my Wisconsin shop had was Lumpfish....nice name ...but black and salty. Used a can of "chicken of the sea" oysters and trimmed them. I just could not use the frozen half shell ones on this. and no-one was the wiser ;-) Made the tapioca part day before and covered put in frig. It made way more than a 1/4 cup per 5 inch remkin. & admittedly thinner ones were better. But OMG! so do this one. Take your time... do it in two days and enjoy watchen your friend faces!

I've made people who claim they hate fancy food moan with this dish. Give it a try, and try not to skip the caviar. It really, really enhances the dish. You should be able to buy 1 oz of American osetra for $20not *that* terrifying for eight servings.

Well, I am not daunted by zillion step recipes but I do expect a huge payoff for the effort. My guests did indeed scrape their plates and moan with pleasure,true. My only change was using nice, crunchy tobiko in lieu of caviar and this was well received. Only quibble was that for all that fussing with the manioc, I think I could have been just as happy having the oysters poached in the finishing sauce w/ a touch of cream added and served in a toasted brioche boat- with the tobiko.

This dish is a fair amount of work, but it is spectacular. When we serve it to guests, they take one bite and sigh with delight and surprise. I disagree with the note at the beginning of the recipe; the timing is not all that critical to its success. It helps the cook feel less frazzled to have everything ready, though. The one critical step is the last baking--be careful not to leave it too long in the oven or the tapioca will lose its wonderful creaminess. (BTW, Thomas Keller claims he has never actually tasted this dish even though he invented it!)

This recipe has also appeared in the Wine Spectator. I prepared it and the other recipes included within the menu that was presented. The meal was fabulous and so impressive. Pearls and Oysters is a very unusual dish. So unusual that you know it has got to be good. Lots of work but worth it.

Why make it? Indeed. "Oysters and Pearls" is so complicated and technique heavy that it is why one would go to the French Laundry. Before you "eeww" a recipe, try to understand it. I have eaten this exact dish at the FL and it was fantastic, well balanced and original. When you see a recipe like this and realize how hard it is to cook at the level of a 5 star restaurant, it makes the educated diner appreciate the experience that much more. So before you cast judgement, know of what you speak. Or, just stay home and eat your instant grits.
