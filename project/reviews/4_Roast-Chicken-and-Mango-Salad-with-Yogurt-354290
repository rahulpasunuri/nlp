This is absolutely delicious, and it's becoming my go-to summer recipe. I use spinach instead of arugula and skip the seeds (not a crunch fan); I also find it needs a good shake of salt, though that might be dependent on your chicken. It's also an easy recipe to halve (or to save half the dressing for later), so you can modify it for feeding fewer.

This will be a regular in my summer repertoire. It is sooo good. The dressing served three adequately so if you want to feed more people adjust accordingly. It is worth it. I eyeballed most of the other ingredients to adjust for numbers and preferences. My foodie guests loved it.

Really great hot weather dinner! Also cut way back on the curry, didn't have mango chutney so I used a mix of raspberry and apricot jelly in the dressing which was also delicious! Did naan as well..perfect.

Doubled ingredients for the sauce and didn't use the flatbread. Delicious - will definitely make again.

Very unique. I'm not generally a salad person (unless it's salad on top of a giant hamburger), but we decided to try this one. I used a rotisserie deli chicken from the store and it was great. I did mix arugula with spinach to make it go a little further and due to some food allergies, I cut way back on the curry. But my husband loved it and for a salad, I really liked it as well! Not something I'd make weekly, but nice for a change.

This was really tasty and very easy to prepare. I doubled the dressing as suggested by other reviewers and was glad I did. I also served it with naan bread (frozen from Trader Joe's and heated 10 mins in the oven). I'll definitely make it again.

This was quite good and very easy. I doubled the dressing as others suggested and was glad I did. I served it with some naan bread (bought frozen from Trader Joe's and ready in 10 mins in the oven). Turned out great.

I only made the marinade and grilled some chicken. It was everything you want a marinade to be: easy, flavorful and kept the chicken succulent.

The salad dressing is excellent, but the amount could be doubled.

Perfect: mango season is in full swing here in Hawai'i; had planned to use the 2 I bought at Farmers' Market, but one was so juicy and rich, it was all we needed! Didn't have any yogurt that day, so skipped it but would make again and be sure to use. Very easy and quick dinner.

This was delicious! It was like dinner and dessert in one dish. I did use full-fat Greek yogurt so that added to the richness, and it could easily be adjusted with more lemon juice.

We all loved it! I will definitely make this again.

This was good. The dressing is a nice change of pace - probably not enough for 6 (you might consider doubling). I wasn't sure what the yogurt would add, but it actually tied everything together nicely. I didn't have the seeds, so I skipped them. Nice easy summer dish.
