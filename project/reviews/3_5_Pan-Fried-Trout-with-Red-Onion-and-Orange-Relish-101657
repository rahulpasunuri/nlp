First time I have used cornmeal in this manner in a recipe and the results were wonderful. I actually increased the recipe to serve eight adults and used freshly caught speckled brown trout from the Gulf of Mexico. The relish surprised me completely as I love fish and felt this was cover the flavors, but it actually enhanced the taste and meal.

This was simple to make and delicious. However, this recipe definitely depends on fresh at-their-prime ingredients as the relish is practically raw, and the fish is just cooked. I loved it.

My husband and I both gave this recipe top marks. The perfect blend of flavours in the relish combined with the rainbow trout created a marvelously delicate taste sensation. The only change I made was substituting white balsamic vinegar for the white wine vinegar. I served it with steamed broccoli and a fresh spinach salad. If I had received this meal at a fine restaurant, I would definitely send my compliments to the Chef!

This didn't do it for me. Not bad or anything, just kind of ho-hum.

Outstanding! Bravo! The orange mint topping was fresh and delightful! I would not change a thing and would make this again for sure!

This is a subtle but classy addition to a fried fish entree, with its unlikely ingredient pairings.

Very nice - one tip though: make sure it's a sweet orange. I had to add a little sugar to make the sauce less bitter.

Different approach, surprisingly good. I added garlic and sugar to relish. Really set off the delicateness of the trout. try it~

This sounds weird but the flavors really go great together and it's easy! Might want to cook the onions a few minutes but leave them crispy. Good with the Rocky Mt trout we get here in Utah.

Boys, boys! Leave the relish recipe alone! It is outstanding and needs no alterations. We really like this recipe, and serve the relish/salsa with other kinds of fish as well.

Don't listen to Ed! :-) The only change I made was to nuke the red onion mixture before adding it to the orange pieces and it was truly a great taste sensation. It would work just as well if the onion went uncooked giving the relish both more color and crunch in contrast to the tender pink trout. Is this a dish beyond compare? Yes. Ed -- stick to the Mrs. Paul's!

I was skeptical of this recipe from the beginning. So I cooked the onions and the orange-mint mixture, then added a half stick of butter and about a half cup of wine. Reduced it to a syrupy consistency. Then poured over cooked trout. Was pretty good.
