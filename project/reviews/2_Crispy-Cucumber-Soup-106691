It was just OK, the day was hot and my husband , who worked outside for 2 hours, liked it. But from all the recipes I have tried from this website this is the least favorite. If I too make it again, I would definitely skip the broth: cucumbers and yogurt yelled enough liquid. Also, 4 cups of yogurt for just 2 cucumbers is way too much. 1 cup is enough, it will serve 2 people. Marinate the radishes in rice vinegar and salt to add some contrast to the blend flavor of cucumbers.

One cup of mint leaves is insane considering the recipe calls for 5 cups of liquid (not counting cukes) I made it with a smattering of mint leaves and it was very nice.

Simply too minty for me and my guests. Might work nicely with basil or dill or a combo.

This is a great summer soup particularly when one has an abundance of cucumbers. What I'd like to know though, is whether it can be frozen since it contains yogurt.
