These cupcakes were easy and delicious! They were very light and not too sweet. The pan I used was TOO mini so the batter made 24. I ended up not icing them because I had some trouble getting the cupcakes out of the tin. However, they were wonderful with whipped cream and strawberries! A simple adaptation that was probably just as good as the original! I will definitely make these again.

A simple, good recipe. I tried replacing all purpose flour with cake flour. Same result - fine moist crumb. Mix a few spoonfuls of cocoa powder with hot water to form a paste and mix with a third of the batter. Swirl this into original batter - marble cake!

I made this at a high altitude and so i cooked it until a toothpick came out clean and it was a little dry. but this recipe can work as a cake, cupcakes or mini cupcakes. when we went to the store on my phone it said 34 cups of confectioners sugar instead of 3-4 cups of confectioners sugar. over all it was very delicious and good but I'm not sure if it is one of the recipes you go out of our way to make again.

These were OK. The picture is deceiveing they look chocolate! I was a little sad when I was making them and realized there was no chocolate! Icing was sweet but good. They actually were less dry the next day so dont hesitate to make them a day ahead.

These cupcakes are fantastic! I made them as mini cupcakes and also as regular size cupcakes. The frosting was a bit on the sweet side but still delicious. I will use this recpie for years to come. Is there a chocolate cupcake recipie that is equally as good?

This recipe is Fabulous! Everybody raved about them and by the end of the night there were none left! Truly a keeper! * Although I did add 1 tsp of Almond extract too both the batter and icing, which truly made it over the top! YUM.**

As far as number of mini-cupcakes this makes, the recipe has an error. I made 3 batches - the first made about 30 cupcakes, each 3/4 full. The second two batches each made 24 cupcakes, each 100% full.

Excellent cupcakes! The frosting was way too sweet though. I added some corstarch and salt to cut the sugar, that helped a bit, but still too sweet. I'd make the cake agaian, but not the frosting.

These were average cupcakes. I'm not a fan of the frosting. Cute, but for taste - check out the orange- cardamon and cinnamon-scented devil's food cupcakes from Bon Appetit June 2004 - those are to die for cupcakes.

Not only were they adorable but they were delicious - the cupcake was very light and airy and the frosting was perfect. It made around 30 cupcakes.

Just to add a note: eat a few when they first come out of the oven (without icing)... wow. That's all I have to say. The crispy golden-brown edges were divine!

First off, if I could give it 3.5 stars, I would. The cupcake cakes themselves were light, fluffy and absolutely scrumptious. However, I found the icing a bit too sweet and one dimensional. I think I'm going to play around with it, maybe by adding a touch of cream cheese to it to make it a bit more sour. Overall, the cupcakes were fantastic (just use a dab of the icing to prevent sweet tooth overload). I think this is a great standby recipe to satisfy by cupcake cravings. Note: The recipe almost made a full 24 batch of mini cupcakes (good thing I had a 24 batch tin). If you overfill the tin, they pool on top of the tin and create the nicest little 'muffin top crisps'. This was actually the best part of the cupcake IMO. If anyone has had the Chinese-style mini muffins that come in plastic bags, these are quite similar (but of course tastier and fluffier!) Suggestions: I would recommend using the minimum amount of sugar to decrease the sweetness in the icing. I will report back once I've tried to dilute the icing with a bit of cream cheese and see how they turn out.

I made these a day ahead of time for an office event. People loved them, but they did seem too dry by the time they were eaten. Much better right after they cooled and were frosted.

This makes 12 regular (old fashioned) cupcakes. Although the batter is very dense, the cupcakes are very light and not too sweet. They are perfect for small children and my son loved helping. Two dozen took 17 minutes to bake with one rotation.

First of all this recipes yields more than twelve mini cupcakes. I doubled the recipe since I wanted 24 mini cupcakes, and ended up with 48 mini cupcakes, and six regular size cupcakes. The cupcakes themselves with light and tasted really nice. I would definetly make them again. I thought the frosting was a bit too sweet, and as one reviewed stated, since the cupcakes are so light, a whipped cream frosting would be nice. My guests loved them though, and since I had so many extras, I sent everyone home with a couple, which they gladly took.

These were fabulous! I made them for a party and people loved them. They were so pretty and much tastier than normal cupcakes (light and a little crispy on the top). The frosting too was very nice.

These turned out really great. The cupcake itself was really light so I used a whipped cream topping instead of the frosting listed in the recipe.

I've made these twice now and each time they were a hit.

These were quick and easy to make. The icing leans more to sugary-sweet than buttery, and next time I will add the vanilla after the icing has reached the desired consistency because the vanilla, butter, and milk combination was impossible to make creamy (I think due to a reaction between the butter and the vanilla).

These cupcakes were easy to make and came out delicious and sweet; did not sink at 5280 ft. Next time will reduce the amount of butter in the frosting from 1/2 cup to 1/3.
