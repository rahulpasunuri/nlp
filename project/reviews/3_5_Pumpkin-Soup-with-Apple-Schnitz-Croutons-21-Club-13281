This soup is very good although does not surpass numerous other great fall soups of the squash/pumpkin genre. I did not find the prep to be so onerous as others suggested. Noting the chicken broth brouhaha in other reviews, I went half and half water and broth and it was certainly fine. (Also used half butternut squash half pumpkin.) Agree with need to season the soup and added some fresh thyme and sage and more than a pinch of sea salt. I don't think I needed to use heavy cream, maybe will try half and half next time.

Wonderful for any fall dinner. I found that using half pumpkin and half butternut squash gave a richer flavor. I also doubled the maple syrup. Another hint is to use an immersion blender after cooking the vegetables in the broth, rather than returning to food processor in batches. It was much easier and not as messy. Then add the cream and syrup to taste. Make it the day before a party or Thanksgiving for the flavors to meld and then just reheat before serving. I also have frozen the leftovers in containers and it is easy to defrost and reheat.

I wasted one of my beautiful garden pumpkins on this! There is no pumpkin flavor - just chicken. Possibly made with water it would taste better?? I would have thought anything with pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmet, maple syrup, and cream would have to be delectable - I was wrong!

I love this soup. It has become a Thanksgiving tradition in our house. I use Butternut squash instead of pumpkin. It is labor intensive- but I roast the butternut squash one night -and make the soup the next day.

This soup has always been a hit in our house. I now make it without the "croutons" and serve with a dollop of crème fraîche or sour cream.

Too much effort for the result. If you're going to spend the whole day making soup, it should be fabulous and worth your time. Basically, this soup is a giant pot of chicken broth with some pumpkin in it. Let it really boil and try to concentrate the flavor some. It makes so much that you can afford to boil off some of the liquid. I can see why they decided to throw in some maple syrup at the end--because what they ended up was not flavorful enough. One shouldn't have to resort to throwing in a bunch of sugar at the end of a whole day's worth of making something to save it from disaster. In some of these magazine's efforts to droll out thousands of recipes each year, it seems to me the quality of some of the dishes is just not what they used to be.

The soup turned out fairly bland made as described. I ended up adding twice as much maple syrup, fresh thyme and salt (which I was surprised it didn't call for in the first place) to spruce it up. The family really liked my version, felt it was nice and light, a great starter for Thanksgiving.

This recipe was a lot of work for not much result. Bland and thin with not much flavour. I would not make it again.

Let me start by saying that this is somewhat of a labor intensive soup to make, but indeed it was worth the effort. After reading the previous review about the soup being too runny, I bought a 4+ lb American Pie pumpkin, but took no chances and ended up supplementing with part of a can of pure packed pumkin because I wanted a nice thick consistency. This seemed to work just fine. I agree that the carrots need more than estimated 10-12 minutes to saute. To cut fat I used 1/2 cup 1% milk and 1/2 cup whipping cream and didn't miss for flovor or richness. Lastly, if you're going to make the apple croutons, make them first as it's much easier to clean apples out of the processor then puree soup, then the reverse order.

This ended up surprisingly delicious. I thought, maple syrup with onion?! But when I tasted it, wow! I think the carrots needed to be cooked longer though, as the soup puree had little bits of carrot that should have pureed with the rest. Instead of "apple schnitz", I put a dallop of apple butter in the center and my boyfriend loved it!

I thought that the flavor was really nice but that the soup was a little runnier than I would have liked. my question is, does 4 pounds of pumpkin mean 4 pounds after roasting and cleaning? or buying a 4 pound pumpkin, only to end up with less than by the time it makes it to the soup..maybe this is where I went wrong. Next time I would buy a larger pumpkin..

My assignment for Thanksgiving dinner was pumpkin soup. I found this recipe and, based on the rave reviews, made it. I bought this wonderful pumpkin from the San Francisco farmers' market - it's a pumpkin/butternut squash hybrid. It made a wonderful soup. The great thing about this soup is that it can easily be done in stages. I roasted the pumpkin the day I bought it (Saturday), scooped out the cooked pumpkin meat, pureed it and then refrigerated it. On Wednesday, I brought the pumpkin puree to room temperature and made the soup and apple croutons. On Thanksgiving, all I had to do was reheat the soup, sprinkle the apples and pumpkin seeds on top and receive lots of raves. The apple croutons are now a favorite snack at my house! On a cooking note - I followed the recommendation of prior comments and reduced the amount of onions. I used 2 small yellow and that was perfect. I added some ginger because I love that flavor. Also, the pumpkin took more like an hour and a half to cook rather than the stated 45 minutes. Overall, will definately make this soup again.

Easy and tastey. Excellent dish for a fall feast.

I served this soup for 16 guest and everybody love it! I reduce the onion, roasted the butternut pumpkin longer like more than and hour, and add more sour ceam before serving as a garnish. The apple croutons are THE BEST! they give a wonderful taste to the soup, I use a silpat insted of parchment paper. A very rich and flavourful soup and very easy and fast to make.

Very nice flavor and texture. I made it with a selection of organic squash about half of which was pumpkin. I roasted the squash then peeled and cubed it. After cooking for 40 minutes to cook the other veggetables I used a whick to puree it instead of a blender (because our son lost the lid to the blender). It worked great and I would do it the same way even after we find the blender lid. I used half chicken stock and half water, I think I'd use just water next time as the chicken stock didn't add anything. I left the croutons as rings which made for pretty presentation but highly impractical to eat in front of other people :)

This soup was really great and pretty easy to make. I served it to family and then froze some and served it to friends recently. All have requested the recipe. I didn't make the apple schnitz croutons due to time constraints but will try them in the future

This is an absolutely wonderful soup. I have made it for a dinner party and everyone raved. The next time I made it I reduced the amount of stock and onions, and added more cream. My husband and I prefer it a little thicker and creamier.

VERY GOOD. I doubled the recipe and enjoyed the bounty of leftovers. I never got a batch of the schnitz to look like I wanted them to, but the flavor they added was phenomenal. When making this, I totally underestimated the time needed to get de-meat the pumpkins (and I underestimated the number of times I would burn myself in the process. Doh!)

I followed this recipe word for word...I love pumpkin soup and have tried many different recipes and I thought this was horrible, so did my husband. We thought there was too much onion and just didn't taste right.

I used a combination of cheese pumpkin and butternut squash. Delicious. Did need about an hour to roast not 45 min as recipe called for. Instead of "apple croutons", decorated with fat free yogurt from a squeeze bottle. Beautiful presentation and everyone at the Thanksgiving table love it.

I made this for several european guests. It was a huge hit with everyone. Rich and flavorful.

Mine came out delicious. I have a feeling it might even be a 'beyond compare' recipe depending on the quality of the pumpkin--you just never know how ripe or fresh a fruit or a vegetable is until it is prepared. Plus, I didn't use real cream;I used soy milk to make it a healthy recipe.
