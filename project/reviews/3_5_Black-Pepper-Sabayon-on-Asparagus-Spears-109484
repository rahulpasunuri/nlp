I didn't find this very special. Added some extra onion, shallot, and pepper. It was good, just not great.

I took the advice of other reviewers (thanks) and used coarsley ground black pepper and white wine instead of white vinegar. I garnished with a bit of lemon zest after it cooked. Delicious!

Excellent! I used 1/3 cup mayo and half and half in place of whipping cream. It got rave reviews from my family and is a make again and again dish.

I've made this recipe twice, once for a dinner party, where it was a big hit with everyone, and once to top broccoli (it was excellent). The second time I made it I used lemon juice in place of vinegar and used freshly ground black pepper instead of cracked peppercorns as some of the pieces are a little hard to eat, and it came really delicious.

I think it's French so it's pronounced sah-bye-awn. Well the last syllable doesn't have a true equivalent in English, but awn is close. Since you asked. :-)

I tested this recipe at the yearly "Thanksgiving Dinner" at my work and it was a huge hit. I have been looking for an asparagus recipe good enough for Thanksgiving and this one definately fit the bill. I also used white wine instead of vinegar, and I only had shallots, so I used them instead of onions. This one is definately a winner. My only problem was I wasn't sure of the correct pronunciation! Can anyone help me with that one?

This was delicious. I also reduced the amount of fresh pepper and added a touch of chardonnay instead of vinegar. Can't think of a better side to grilled steak.

To say this was delicious is an understatement! The sauce complimented the asparagus perfectly. I had extra sauce and proceeded to dip everything I could find in it. Substitutions: I used milk instead of the cream. Also, I did not have peppercorns so I used ground pepper, but I am looking forward to trying it with the corns.

Having vacationed in Scotland and visiting Edinburgh this spring I read the May issue of Bon Appetit cover to cover. This recipe was a real hit at our house. It's so easy yet seems much more complex. Just delicious!

This is a delicious and easy sauce. I have enjoyed it on grilled asparagus and a steak. It's very versatile depending how much pepper, lemon, etc. you add. With the steak I reduced a splash of red wine before adding the mayonnaise to the pan with the pepper and onion.

I thought this recipe was very good. Based on the only review prior to this (thank you) I did make some substitutions. I used 1/2TBL. peppercorns, used 1 lg. shallot instead of the onion, substitued 3 tsp lemon juice for the 1 tsp. vinegar & added the grated rind of 1 lemon. It is thick like the prior review stated. You do have to spread this on like buttering toast but when cooked it worked well on the asparagus. Everyone loved it. I think this would be great on broccoli as well.

If you like pepper, you'll like this recipe. It's easy and inexpensive to make. I thought the sauce was a little too thick for my tastes, however. As much as I like pepper, however, I thought the amount of pepper overwhelmed the delicate flavor of the asparagus. I would have preferred a sauce that was a little more lemony and less peppery.
