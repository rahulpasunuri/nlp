This sauce is simply spectacular; I wouldn't change a thing.

I used herbs de provence that a friend picked up recently while in Provence. I used a 5 lb chicken and sprinkled 1 tsp in the cavity. I also sprinkled the herbs liberally on the outside after I massaged with the butter. Did the carrot and onion and the sauce. Cooked in the convection oven at 400 for the first 15 mins, and 325 for the remaining 1 hr and 45 mins. Two thumbs up.

I enjoyed this recipe. Did not have shallots so i chopped a onion. I left some of the chicken juice in the pan definetly serve hot biscuits to soak up the juice quick and easy meal with a lot of flavor.

This was a very good recipe, we certainly enjoyed it with the Julias Chicken with lemon and sage. AS i´M NOT A GREAT FAN OF LUMPY GRAVY WHEN STRAINED IF WAS SILKY SMOOTH.

Used this sauce with Julia's roast chicken for dinner on New Year's Eve 2000. Simply the best food I've ever eaten at home!

I absolutely loved this sauce, although I did not follow the recipe exactly. I used chicken broth and I didn't use the roasting pan to simmer the sauce. I poured the juices from the pan directly into a saucepan and then followed the rest of the recipe. It wasn't very thick, but it tasted great, especially good for dipping bread into!! YUM
