This was fantastic and simple to make. I used the brown rice I had on hand, and I followed commenters' suggestions to increase the lemon juice. Used the juice of 1 lemon, but halved everything else to serve 4. Fresh parsley sprinkled on top really made the dish.

I was hoping this would be like the Greek restaurants' Egg Lemon Soup that is prevalent in my area and could give this a rave review but it just didn't pass muster. I also added a bit more lemon juice after the first taste test and shredded chicken from a roaster - the salt and pepper but it's blah and the broth too frothy - maybe the egg whites were too stiff?

Excellent and easy. I used veg broth and cut the recipe in half (used 1/4 cup lemon juice for half recipe) and it was perfect. Frothy texture made it interesting. Farmily loved it, would make again.

I would have given this four stars, but I edited the recipe just a touch. We left out the step with the eggs and used basmati rice, rather than converted white rice. It was simple and utterly delicious. Served with Rosemary bread. Will definitely make again--so economical!

This is my new favorite. My boyfriend mentioned lemon chicken rice soup as something he had in Greektown in Detroit. I'd never heard of such a thing--so went looking. I added a poached chicken breast diced and used a little less rice. This is fast and easy. And so-o yummy!

Even with the addition of thyme and rosemary and the increase of the lemon juice to 1 cup, the soup seems to lack something. It definetly tastes better with some cubed chicken, however. The foamy consistency kind of made me ill, I think beating the egg whites til soft, not stiff will suffice. I'll try to tweak it again next time.

This recipe was very disappointing. I thought that it would be great because of all of the rave reviews but it was bland and unappealing. My family refused to eat it and I threw the whole pot away.

Rather bland but not bad though. Very basic indeed. It did have a nice foamy consistency. I don't know if I'll make it again.

Doubled the recipe and it turned out just great although next time I might add just a little bit more lemon juice.

My family truly enjoys this soup recipe. I'm making it for the 3rd time tonight. Served with a Greek salad and grilled chicken, makes a simple and elegant meal.

Was in the fall mood for soup and this truly hit the spot. Followed the directions closely and it came out wonderful. The versatility in adding more vegetables or meat, or changing broth to make a pure vegatarian dish makes this recipe a keeper.

I really like this soup. The foamy consistency made me skeptical about how it would turn out but I really enjoyed the flavour and the texture was great- kind of thick. Great lemon taste! I will definitely make this again.

This is wonderful, easy and quick. The only reason it does not get 4 stars is because it needs more lemon - more like 3/4 cup. Please follow the egg directions closely - that's critical to the soup's success.

I'm sure I would have rated this soup a 4 if I'd followed the recipe but I used orzo pasta instead of rice and it expanded too much. I package just said cook to desired firmness. I didn't realized that meant five minutes. Rice would have been better. The other changes I made, I would do again. I used only three eggs instead of four. The eggs just made the soup creamy and kinda frothy - not stringy like chinese egg drop soup. I also added the meat from a rotisserie chicken. Very good soup! The lemon makes is intriguingly different.

I have been looking for a recipe for Lemon Rice Soup that is served in restaurants and this is it! I eliminated the vegetables and added a cut up boneless, skinless chicken breast. It is absolutely delicious!

I made this in a rush for dinner last night, and followed the directions exactly. It was really delicious! I was taken aback at the fluffiness that the egg whites added, but it turned out to be great ... really flavorful and very light tasting. My husband raved from the beginning of dinner to the end (between bites!) and my 3 and 4 year old boys loved it. I even snuck a small bowl, cold from the fridge, with a glass of wine after everyone had gone to bed! My husband said that this one has to go in our "favorites" file!

Even the kids loved this soup! Easier to make than it sounds and delicious.

I was really looking forward to this recipe but am sorely disappointed. I used homemade chicken stock and added some bits of chicken. I hated the eggs in the soup! It reminds of Chinese Hot and Sour Soup but it doesn't come together nicely at all!! I did enjoy the lemon taste and thought it could have used more than 1/3 cup but my husband thought the lemon taste was overpowering! I wish I had never added the eggs!!

I made this with orzo pasta and had 1/2 cup lemon juice which gave it a stronger flavor. It was a bit think so for the leftovers I had to add some more broth.

I made this soup with vegetable broth. I cut down on the yokes using 4 egg whites and 2 yokes. I think it needs more lemon than was called for. Simple and delicious

It seemed like the recipe called for too much lemon juice -- it overwhelmed the flavor. Otherwise, the soup was tasty.

Rating: 3
Great flavor... I love the way the eggs add the creamy texture. I used cilantro instead of parsley. Next time I would add more lemon juice.

could use a little more punch, maybe some additional lemon juice to add more of a zing. otherwise, delicious!
