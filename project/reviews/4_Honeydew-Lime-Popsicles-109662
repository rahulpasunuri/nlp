Try with seedless watermelon and lemon juice. . . very delicious. My daughter asked if we could add strawberries or raspberries next time!

Using Equal will lower the amount of sugar in the pops, but the melon contains alot of natural sugar so they would not be sugar free. ljs

This "dish" is just another simple variation on a popsicle recipe. Being a student of Culinary Arts, I can tell you that this recipe can also very easily be changed around to your liking. One way, is to make the 'simple syrup' (Boiling the water and sugar, then cooling), adding lemon juice, pour into a small cake pan, check on it every once and a while and stir it as best you can. Eventually it will become frozen, then you just simply take a fork and "rake" it on the ice. Put into a cup and serve immediately. Granted, it's not a popsicle, but it's Granita, or Italian Ice. Enjoy!
