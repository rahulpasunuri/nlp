I had an excess of fresh artichokes, and decided to try this recipe. After steaming my artichokes, I let them cool before assembling the casserole. I didn't get the green gray color as another critique stated; I don't know if that was a problem. I used burbank russett potatoes, but left their skins on them. My family loved this recipe, and we have had it exactly as the directions guide me. I have however, been creative too, and not only is this a stand alone great side dish, but it is a foundation for even an entree! Try layering some high quality chipped ham and a fine grated gruyere mixed together as a layer just after the potatoes. And, then top with buttered soft buttered bread crumbs, parsley, and some very fine grated parmesan cheese. Serve this with a green salad and you'll have a great meal! I am considering doing this with leftover cold slices of chicken and jack cheese as an entree option.

This was great, not a bite left in the dish!

Delicious side dish, good for guests & pot lucks. As another person suggested, I topped with parmesan, though it may not need it. I also used marinated artichoke hearts from Costco, which added flavor and made it very easy to put together. A keeper!

Fantastic recipe. I made some changes based on what I had on hand: I poured a low-fat milk and egg mixture over the potatoes and put a lot of grated cheese on top. Also, frying the onions seemed like too much bother. I just put them in the bottom of the dish with some garlic paste. Plus I used a can of artichoke hearts I had lying around. This is a versatile keeper.

I tried this, and it was yummy. I think next time I will cook a little longer and top with a breadcrumb topping.

I actually thought this dish was very good. It had a lot of taste and was a great side dish with my grilled chicken and corn on the cob. It was quite easy and was a great texture! I'll make this dish again. Maybe next time, I'll add a mixture of parmesan and gorgonzola to the top and bake for an extra 25 min's...

I took this receipe and deleted the half& half added more cream, used canned artichokes and quartered them and grated gruyere between and on top. Everyone loved it use you imagination

I made this recipe according to the given directions. Whereas it had a good taste, it had the most awful gray color after it was baked. The whole dish took on the gray-green color of cooked artichokes. A most unappetizing color for potatoes! I would not make it again.
