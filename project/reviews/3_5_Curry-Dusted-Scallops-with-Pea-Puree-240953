My husband & I thought that this was AMAZING! I made it tonight with one adjustment - I added 1 tsp. minced ginger to the pea puree. I placed the scallops over a wild rice pilaf with carrots, and made a moat of pea puree around the rice & scallops - pretty enough for company next time!

This is a fast, easy and impressive-looking dish! I went heavy on the curry powder because I like spicy foods, and several times I've substituted the peas with fresh Brussels sprouts. Delicious!

This was an easy and great dish. It would be great for company as it looks quite impressive. The curry is not overpowering and the pea puree matches nicely, I will make this again,

This dinner was very well-received at a recent dinner party I had with a few friends. What made it all the more impressive was that the power went out due to a nearby fire, so I had to prepare most of it lit only by candle light and thanks to my trusty camping headlamp (thankfully I have a gas range). Instead of pureeing the peas (no electricity means no blender), we put them in a ziplock bag and smashed them with a ramakin. This worked really well and allowed they peas to retain some of their natural texture. Also used a homemade curry powder with made the scallops especially delicious. A great meal!

felt the scallops were a little one note. also love mushy peas but these were a little loose for my taste. close, but not great. nice idea/combo,but needs a little tweaking.

This is delicious! I've made it twice. It's truly easy. We don't have a Cuisinart, so I don't puree the peas. Also, I halved the amount of scallops because there's just two of us, but it was still way way too much. I think three scallops per person is plenty. Last night we used chicken breast instead of scallops and it was also divine. I use Ca Ri Ni An Do Madras Curry Powder, which has TONS of flavor. Highly recommended

We love this recipe! Quick, easy, colorful and delicious. We like to add crushed Trader Joes chili lime peanuts to the curry powder for a little zing, crunch and nuttiness.

i used hot madras curry powder and it went over really well. i like the added spice of this curry powder. the pea puree was awesome. we had it with brown rice for great texture.

Pretty good I the scallops where a bit to much salt on the scallops for might have been my heavy hand though just be careful it could ruin the dish added some ginger powder to the combo too which add a nice middle note

This recipe was almost less than ok. My husband & I both have adventurous tastes and have tried many unusual recipes but as good as this one sounded, it was just "yuck". Apologies to those who liked it but the flavor wasn't great and the two soft consistencies of the pureed peas and scallops which are soft was not appealing. I have never before not eaten a dinner I have made - this one got further pureed in the garbage disposal.

The pea puree is heavenly. I'll definitely make that again. They're the reason I didn't give this recipe only 2 stars. But as for the scallops, phooey. You couldn't even taste the curry.

Pureed peas aren't just for babies anymore! Delightful and surprising flavor pairing. Easy as sin.

I was worried that the pea puree would be a bit bland, but it paired perfectly with the scallops. Curried couscous went well with this dish, both in taste and its quick preparation. Quite a refreshing and satisfying meal.
