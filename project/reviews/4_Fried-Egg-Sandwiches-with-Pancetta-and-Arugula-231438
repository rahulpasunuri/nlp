So yummy. The arugula and pancetta just balance with the egg so perfectly. This will become a breakfast favorite!

I am really surprised there are not more reviews on this. I have been making it for years--it's quick, easy and delicious. I use english muffins, lightly toasted, for the bread. So good with a pureed vegetable soup!

Delicious. I recommend thinly sliced bread. The pancetta is so thin that thick bread can overwhelm it.

We have loved fried egg sandwiches forever!! We always add a little dijon mustard, but that's all. The pancetta and arugula were great additions we never would have thought of.
