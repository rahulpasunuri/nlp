I've made this several times and each party these receive rave reviews and are now being requested! I make the mango/chicken chutney the night before- the flavor seems to be enhanced by letting it sit (refrigerated) overnight. I use the mango chutney recipe from the "Pork Tenderloin with Mango Chutney" on EPI. At the last party I catered, I couldn't keep enough of these on the trays!! Yummy!

This is a wonderful salad. I more than doubled the recipe and served with dinner rolls for a buffet sandwich. Lots of raves from guests. My daughter also made this for her Christmas Party and served it on endive leaves, just great.

Very tasty. Added 1/4t curry powder,plus carrots, apples, and red onion. Substituted 1/4 cup light mayo and 1/4cup light sour cream for the mayo. Will make again.

These were quite tasty and well-liked as an appetizer before Christmas dinner. That said, they were a little sweet for my taste, and though the presentation is colorful and attractive, they fell apart when you picked them up and were quite messy. I might try it again and alter the flavor, liked the walnuts, not crazy about the chutney.

I am not a fan of chicken, but I know most people are, so I chose this to include in the appetizers I made for our Christmas party this year. I made it 4 hours ahead of the party like it said. The only thing I changed was that I used low fat mayonnaise. Everyone loved it.

Okay, but really quite ordinary. There are lots of similar recipes out there in the recipe-world. No real complaints, just okay.

This is great, and so simple to make. I substituted pine nuts for walnuts because I love them and it gave it a nice mellow crunch. I used low fat mayo as well, and it is great. Hope my guests like it as much as I do!

I served this at a bridal shower, and it was very well-received. I used light mayo and a good quality chutney and basically followed the recipe as outlined. Delicious and something I will make again. Not at all bland.

Delicious! I used the Mango Chutney from the Pork Tenderloin with Mango Chutney recipe with great results. You can easily adjust the amounts of each ingredient to your preference to further improve the recipe. I cut back on the mayo since I was hesitant to mix it with the chutney - but it was delicious. Put it over a bed of romaine for a delicious and satisfying lunch-time salad.

I made this for a wedding shower and it was a hit. The presentation is beautiful and the chicken salad tastes very tropical.

Made this among several other finger-foods at my party and this was the dish that was licked clean! A very easy recipie and so good. This would be as good at a gourmet party as it would a summer picnic. The mango chutney is the "secret ingredient" - it adds just the right amount of sweetness and fruitiness to the salad. I did not add all of the mayo mix to the other ingredients - I mixed this separately and just added until I go the right consistency. This will be my chicken salad recipie from now on. Very yummy...!

I made the recipe exactly as shown but found it bland. I like the others' suggestions to add: more/better chutney, grapes, curry powder.

I love to serve this as an appetizer when I have guests, since it's so pretty on the plate - and it is always a big hit - and remarkably easy to boot!

I couldn't find any mango chutney at the time, so I used red grapes. It was a big hit at our party. Very light...would definitely make this again.

This recipe was a hit. I served it on top of plain rice crackers and cucumber slices.

I made this for my husband's ofice party and it was a hit. There were no leftovers. I used the limes as an accent and a flavoring. I used canned chicken to save time. This can be used year round.

This was an excellent appetizer. Everyone raved and ate them up. The cilantro was a great flavor with the sweetness of the chutney. Will make again!

Followed the recipe mostly except I used low fat mayo, and skipped the lime juice. It looks nice and it tastes deliciously.

I made this recipe exactly as written for our book club,everyone thought it was delicious and not a bit was left over. So easy & just wonderful flavor.

Delicious! I made these for a couple of baby showers and they were gobbled up soooo fast. I love the idea of using the chicken mixture on tortillas too. I'll try that soon for a quick and easy dinner:)

This was wonderful. I made it for a summer party and everyone devoured it. I will make double next time!

Brought this dish to two separate 4th of July picnics and received more requests for the recipe than for any other epicurious dish I have made. Was running low on time and took the advice to use rotisserie chickens -- great suggestion.

I was looking for a no-cook dinner option and this was a hit with my teenaged sons and my husband. We wrapped the salad in a warmed flour tortilla, adding some lettuce for a refreshing crunch. Definitely a repeater!

Great flavors and easy to make. I added a bit more lime juice and cilantro. Served it in a variety of lettuce cups as well as on crostini and in mini cheese puffs.

I used this for a housewarming party and it was very well received. I ended up making too much (2x), but the crowd went through it fairly quickly! I'd definitely make this again. I also had a few friends ask for the recipe. I bought a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store to save some time and also used a food processor instead of chopping all those veggies. Turned out perfect.

This is wonderful and easy. Loved the "bite " that the chutney gave the chicken salad. I served on romaine leaves and thought the presentaion and taste were equally impressive. Great addition to a cocktail party!

This appetizer rocked. I doubled the recipe and took it to a Christmas party for eight. It disappeared in ten minutes. The only thing I did differently from the recipe is that I served the chicken salad in belgian endive leaves. I wish I had tripled this appetizer instead of making prosciutto with arugula.

Wonderful chicken salad. I served it the second time on endive leaves as an appetizer everyone love it!

I made this for a Christmas aboard Boat lunch. Other than doubling the recipe,I followed the recipe exactly. It was the hit of my lunch. When I make it again, which I certainly will, I would skip the 3-1/2" lettuce "cups" and serve it on a bed of lettuce. Fortunately,I placed the bowl of remaining salad next to the platter of lettuce and the party of 8 left it clean!

Made this for our annual Christmas party, and it was a big hit! Used about half of the mayo that was called for. Also noticed that there is a difference among the jarred mango chutneys. Spending a little more for a good quality one (with actual chunks of fruit as opposed to a puree) seems to work better for this recipe.

I substituted a lesser combo amount of lemon fat-free yogurt and a lower fat mayo, ate it on whole grain grain bread with lettuce and it tasted pretty good to me. My husband liked it, too. P.S. And I'm not dead yet!

Delicious recipe. I briefly baked phyllo cups and then added the chicken salad. I cut back on the mayo and added a little more chutney. I only got to eat one, my guests scarfed down the rest.

My guests and I thought this was delicious as a lunch entree. Will definitely make it again.

Excellent chicken/turkey salad. White raisins is a nice addition ... but try halved Thompson seedless grapes plus curry powder to taste.

It seemed to need something else so we added white raisins--a very nice addition.
