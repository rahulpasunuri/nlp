The best part about this recipe is that it's simple. It took me less than 10 minutes to put it together and then I just let it cook. I added an onion and some garlic. I think next time I'll add some spices to make it really pop.

It's amazing how good this is - it's SO simple. I added some barley and carrot for variety, but it didn't really need it. Will definitely make it again!

This smelled delicious while cooking, and tasted quite good that first night. But my husband thought the cabbage tasted too much like sauerkraut on day 2 and wouldn't eat any more. So I doubt I'll make it again.

This soup is REALLY good - so easy too. I might try cutting down the sugar next time and I added a small shallot, used chicken broth and served it with some big homemade croutons. My husband loved it and he HATES cabbage!

Just finished my second bowl (my husband made this while the rest of the family was at church)...delicious. This is "his" recipe he makes several times during the fall and winter "soup" season. Super simple and delicious prepared exactly as recipe. Today he added some leftover cooked bacon from breakfast which added very nice flavor. Everyone who has tried it, loves it...even the picky eaters.

This got thumbs up from all six at the table! I enhanced the bouillon by browning two beef marrow bones in the butter (each had about 1/2 lb. meat on them). Then I made up the six quarts of bouillon using "Better Than Bouillon" beef base. Added this to the bones and slow cooked them in my cooker for about six hours on low. Removed the bones and fat and chopped the meat and returned it to the stock. Added all of the other ingredients and cooked for about another hour and a half. I served it with garlic and Romano cheese crostini. Doing it this way it deserves five or six forks. Everyone wanted the menu added to regular rotation.

I added diced Polish sausage to mine for a little protein. A great simple soup.

Simple, easy and tasty. I added cumin to give it a little something something.

Nice simple soup. I did add an onion, but otherwise did not alter it by adding vinegar or anything else. It reminds me of an onion soup with its sweet nuttiness.

Oh yeah, you need an acid to offset the sugar. I used plum vinegar but any vinegar or citrus juice will do. Also use olive oil instead of butter -- it's healthier.

OK, simple is not always good. Add an onion, a shredded carrot and a bay leaf. Use chicken broth instead of beef. Half red cabbage and half green. It's no so ugly after these changes.

Even my one picky eater, age 4, loves this simple soup. We have it at least twice a month and it is delicious every time.

This soup was simple, relatively quick and delicious. I substituted the beef bouillon with vegetable broth and added curry powder and habanero hot sauce for some kick.

This looks absolutely hideous in the pot but tastes nice. I would prefer to reduce the amount of sugar by one or two tsp. I did add an onion and a few splashes of lemon juice, and I used red cabbage instead of white because it's what I had.

This was so simple and so good. We will definitely be making this again.

I have to admit this was surprisingly good! Not the prettiest of soups but simple, very tasty and a great option for cabbage. I will definitely make this again.

This is a wonderfully simple and surprisingly delicious recipe. I was expecting plain cabbage-beef broth flavour, but the cooked butter/sugare transform the soup. We followed the advice of another reviewer, and accompanied the soup with baguette, and beer (belgian rather than canadian though!). Just great!

A cold day in the South is a late spring day in the North. This soup is good on any of those days. Did make my beef broth with a shin bone that had a good chunk of meat on it and left the meat in the soup. Crusty bread, butter, some cheese and a good canadian beer. Life is good!

we use alot of cabbage and when there is a surplus of cabbage I'll make this soup, plus I'll brown some chopped bacon, drain the fat and then add it to the soup, this gives it a nice flavor to the stock.

This soup is relatively simple to prepare and turned out excellently. It is a keeper.

some dill and/or garlic (not too much) does not hurt
