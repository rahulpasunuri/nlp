Very nice dessert for 4th of July celebration. Cold, refreshing, and all the right colors. A muffin-top pan is perfect for making the baskets. Used limoncello in place of Amaretto.

This is the perfect recipe for a warm summer evening or after a heavy meal. It is impressive, light and do-ahead when the day is cool. Loved it as did a professional chef who was with us for dinner one evening.

Elegant dessert presentation. I serve it often but can't enjoy it myself as I am lactose intolerant. Oh, for a substitute for cream!

I made this twice..once with frozen berries and once with fresh. The fresh was much better, however, either way this is a great recipe. Lots of wonderful comments

This was very easy!! I used a muffin pan and it made 10 "baskets. You could also use cookie cutters to form different shapes - ie hearts for Valentines Day. The "baskets" kept in the freezer very well for a week. As it's very rich, I made mine thinner than the magazine's recipe. Enjoy!!
