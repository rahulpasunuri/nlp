I have been looking for this recipe, not remembering what it was called. The only 2 things missing are the slices lemons and the capers. This dish is so good. It's one of those feel good dinners that is just complicated enough to make those eating it say WOW, but not time consuming, intricate or costly. Make it. Enjoy it.

Oh! one more thing. I would cook the chicken a litttle longer till it is pulling away from the bones and then I would de-bone it while the sauce was thickening. I think it would be more enjoyable without the bones, too messy.

This is a good start, but my 15 year old said it was bland. I agreed. Perhaps some rosemary would give a little oomph. I did the Persillade, as recommended by a reviewer. Who would think that with 3 cloves garlic, fresh basil and everything else that it could be bland?! We are partial to spicy mexican food, so maybe it is just not our thing. What else can I do to jazz this up? Thanks colororo, for the Persillad recipe, it would be great on a nice piece of fish w/ lemon and many other dishes as well.

This is a wonderful, never fail recipe! I love that it uses ingredients that I always have on hand. Sometimes I leave out the olives and it is still wonderful. Tonight I tried it with the recommended parsly/garlic mince and it was awesome as always! Enjoy!

Authentic Provencal style chicken is actually rather simple to make, and I think- while delicious- this recipe complicates it a little. Let me also give you a VERY important but vital tip that takes little extra effort but makes this authentic- Persillade 3 Garlic cloves (already requested) 3 tbs parsley A common theme in all provencal cooking, I'm amased they ask you to mince garlic but don't complete it. Persillade is a FINELY minced mixture of garlic and parsley- often sauteed with the chicken in the last minute or so, but in this case just add it when you would normally add the garlic. Most persillade is one garlic clove with 2 tbs parsley. Mince the garlic VERY finely by itself, then mince the parsley seperately by itself VERY fine (use dry parsley, wet parsley is harder to mince). Then, combine them and mince them AGAIN. The result should be a well mixed, finely minced blend of parsley and garlic. Add this to any sauted meat/chicken dish and instantly you have a Provencal style. Again, actual provencal style sauteed chicken uses less ingredients and is simpler to put together- but this is tastey too. You can always use black olives instead, and slim down on herbs except for just the Persillade. Instead of slicing the basil, tear it with your hands- slicing the basil discolours the edges and it is commonly felt to damage some of the flavour as well.

One of my favorite recipes -- I make it again and again. Great for potlucks or company.

Simple to make. Lots of flavor. Great over steamed rice and tastes even better the next day. If serving it the next day, I'd suggest putting in the fresh basil at the end of the heating process to retain the bright green color.

I've been searching for this as I make something very much the same but I add the largest ripe and green olives I can find. Sliced for presentation. Also this is excellent with snapper or grouper. Just remember that you only need to cook the fish 5 to 7 min. in the hot sauce after it's been lightly saute'd.
