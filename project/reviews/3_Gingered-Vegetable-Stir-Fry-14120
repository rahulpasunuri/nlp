I added 1-2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil. It was just a bit bland for our taste. I might add a little Thai hot sausce when I make it again. The dish was good served with brown jasmine rice and some tamari sauce.

I added a little shredded chicken breast, but not so much that you would call this a chicken dish, and used a combination of cremini, oyster and shiitake mushrooms and stir-fried them first in peanut oil and a little sesame oil. I also substituted radicchio for the Napa cabbage, and since that's a little bitter, I left in the sugar, but used a tsp. of light tamari instead of the salt. And I doubled the ginger. It was absolutely delicious and a great way to use the daikon I had purchased on a whim, not knowing what to do with it. Now I have a reason to buy more.

Wow, I LOVED this recipe. I used snow peas and broccoli for the veggies (that's what I had). I used half of the sugar and no cornstarch, I just let the sauce reduce on it's own. I used soy sauce instead of salt. I also added some Sriracha sauce and cilantro. I can't wait to use shrimp with it!!

This is the first highly rated Epicurious recipe that I have tried and been completely unimpressed with. It is a very unappealing dish in both how it looks and how it tastes. I wouldn't waste my veggies or my time on this one.

Really really good! My V-slicer made quick work of the julienning. Wasn't knocked out when I read the recipe, but I was when I tasted it--so delicious! I increased the ginger, just about tripled the shiitakes and made twice the sauce. Serving with brown rice.

I made the recipe with no garlic and twice the ginger. The flavors and colors were quite good, even though carrots and diakon weren't my favorites. The mushrooms were quite delicious. At this point the recipe was just okay. I refrigerated the leftovers and had them cold for lunch the following day. Wow. Really thought this made a difference. The dish was now very good.

This was delicious--the combination of textures and flavorings was perfect. The garlic and ginger flavored the dish beautifully without being overwhelming. A wonderful way to use daikon and napa.

I have better stir fry recipes and found this one to be mediocre. I also found that if you are like me and add lots of extra veggies and need to double the sauce, DON'T double the salt! Yikes! I should have known better!

I followed the recipe but used 1T ginger and shreded leftover chicken and pork roast. It was excellent. I thought just the right amount of ginger. I did use some soy sauce at the table. The flavors were very well balanced.

I thought this recipie was too sour. It didn't have any depth of flavour that I think any vegetable dish standing as a main dish needs. I served with coconut rice and that still didn't help. Still searching for a good recipie to use Daikon in....

Delicious. Very subtle tastes. Needs more ginger than given here. Definitely don't add any stronger flavors like Soy sauce - it would unbalance the dish.

Excellent, easy and fool proof. My modifications: I am Muslim, so I subsituted the wine with broth and added a teensy bit of sugar. I also used regular turnips instead of the Asian radish. I used equal parts vegetable and sesame oil (love its flavour), and found that I needed to add a bit more oil during the cooking. But maybe that's because I don't have a wok and used a regular pot instead.

Quick, simple and delicious. I added a chili and some sesame oil and served it with sticky rice.

It was actually far better than i'd expected. scrumptuous, easy, flexible, fast. substituted soy sauce for the salt and chardonnay for the rice wine, and added red/orange peppers, squash, fish sauce, sesame oil, and probably quadruple the level of ginger, and it was still fab. was ready in about 25 minutes.

I like this dish's light flavor. I added some extra vegetables, red bell pepper, onion, sun chokes, and a teaspoon of sesame oil for flavor. I also cubed some firm tofu and marinated it in the broth mixture while I was preparing the veggies and served the dish as an entree.

an excellent Asian veggy dish, and very adaptable depending on what you have on hand. I also used less cabbage.

Excellent, easy and fast. I found packaged precut Asian vegetables at my grocery store and used that so it was even faster to prepare.

To spice up the dish add some grilled jerked turkey thighs cut up in strips. I sure you will like it.

I have made this dish several times and have always been pleased with the results. I usually serve it with Honey and Soy Glazed Salmon. Yummy!!

The one thing I'd vary is using significantly less cabbage, relative to the proportion of other veggies in this recipe.

Wonderful flavor with the ginger...You can also add chicken or scallops or shrimp and change the veges for a delightful meal. Takes only a short time to prepare...Lovely meal...Our family enjoyed it a lot! Thanks Gourmet for another great meal with little fuss..
