I thought this was surprisingly bland. It could have used more garlic, salt and herbs. make sure you don't use low sodium chicken broth.

We make this each year for Christmas Eve and everyone really enjoys them.If you don't have fresh of some of the herbs dry works fine...just taste the broth before serving and reseason.

My husband and I loved it. Plan to use it for company (at least for those who will eat mussels!) I agree with others that straining is not necessary. Just cook mussels with rest of ingredients and serve, with perhaps herbs sprinkled on later. Could perhaps use some more garlic and herbs, to jazz up broth a bit.

It really is a great recipe, but also to strain the liquid is not necessary. Just do the first step, then add the additional ingredients and I think the flavors come together nicely. Otherwise a great company recipe...

I make this with a combination of mussels and clams. Its a real company pleaser for a casual gathering. In a hurry? Just cook the mussels in the broth and serve in the pan broth and all. Don't bother to strain and thicken.

I thought the flavor was very good, probably because I always add extra garlic + herbs when I cook. But I agree with the cook from Sacramento - I placed the mussels in a warmer to keep hot, but they were still only warm. Next time,I would combine ALL the ingredients, place the mussels on top + continue to cook as directed. I would not strain the cooking liquid. I felt it was not necessary since my mussels were not sandy or gritty like clams tend to be.

Surprisingly bland. And the cooked mussels get cold while you are preparing the sauce. I think I would return to my original method of steaming the mussels in dry vermouth with lots of garlic, but I would add the fresh herbs and shallots from this recipe.
