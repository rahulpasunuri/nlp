My family absolutely flipped over this pie! I used the Nilla wafer crust but did not add additional sugar--no need. I also used 70% dark chocolate instead of bittersweet. Definitely would do the same again. This pis is rich but not overly sweet---its all chocolate and just delicious!

Yummy! I followed the recipe exactly, including the sieving of the custard. The pudding is flawlessly smooth and creamy! I used a graham cracker crust pressed into a springform pan, as I don't have a pie plate that's big enough. It work perfectly and held up after the outer ring was removed. Great pie. Serve it with some slice fresh strawberries on the side. Nothing better than chocolate with strawberries!

This recipe has been a favorite of family and friends for years. Each year I get more requests for the pie at Thanksgiving and Christmas. It's one of the few recipes I follow exactly.

this is a flippin delicious pie! exactly what i was looking for! i was a little nervous about the crust simply cos it didn't look 'wet' enough after i mixed it together. debated adding more melted butter but glad i didn't - it came out beautifully! i ended up using 9 oz bittersweet chocolate, simply cos i didn't have any unsweetened. i decreased the sugar by about 3 Tbsp and it turned out great! so tasty! also used a 9 1/2" deep dish pie plate - and darn it, i had one small serving of delicious chocolate pudding left over! what to do?!? :)

I have been making this for about 7 years & never reviewed it! It's less like a pudding and more like a mousse, it's very thick & rich, a different consistency than pudding. It makes enough for 2 pies if youre using a standard pie plate. I use a homemade graham crust with 1 1/4 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup sugar & 1/3 cup butter. I never have to sieve it, it always comes out perfect, I use room temp ingredients & whisk over medium heat

simple, quick prep and very very good. I followed recipe exactly but used graham crust. Personal peeve: Chocolate cream and it's like ARE high calorie desserts. makes me nuts when cooks sub to cut calories. Eat a smaller piece and leave the good stuff in for everyone else. Thanks,

This pie was just OK in my opinion. It seemed kind of like a cookie crust full of pudding to me. Not exactly what I was looking for, but it wasn't bad.

I've been making this pie to rave reviews for 10+ years. It's always amazing. I never put it through a sieve, and always make the crust as is. It is absolutely easy and decadent. Be prepared you will be making it again!

This is a rich, chocolately cream pie that sets up and slices nicely. I essentially followed the recipe, but used the suggestions of the cooks from Gaitlinburg (1/1/03) and St. Louis (1/08/02) and tempered the eggs rather than forcing the custard through a sieve. The result was a creamy and smooth filling. I used my standard pie crust recipe rather than the cookie crumb cust and think it was just right. A standard crust really lets you focus on the fabulous filling. I will make this again, but only for special occasions because of how rich it is. If you like chocolate, you will like this pie. It is pretty easy to prepare and the results will guarantee a place in the cholestrol burdened hearts and arteries of the chocolate lovers in your life.

When youi make the filling, remember that saliva (from the occaisional taste) will keep the filling from setting, and it will be runny. Use a clean spoon for each taste (you WILL want to taste this again and again), and it will be stellar!

This was a great recipe, although I made a few changes: used chocolate wafers (actually Newman's Own Alphabet Cookies) and cut down the sugar in the crust to 2 tbsp. I also tempered the egg yolks as suggested by other reviewers and it came out creamy & thick -- no straining needed.

Based on the high reviews I really wanted to make this recipe, but I didn't want to go to the store, so here's what I did. I used all Ghirardelli Bittersweet chocolate chips, combined them with 1/2 cup sugar and microwaved the mixture on high for 2 minutes. That saved the simmering water step. I didn't want to make a pie crust and the kids had eaten all the graham crackers, but I did have a tin of Dark Chocolate Piroulines. I put them all in the food processor, processed them until they were crumbs and added 1/2 stick of unsalted butter, and processed again. I pressed the mixture into a 10" springform pan, baked it at 350 degrees for five minutes and let it cool. I followed the rest of the recipe as written. The result drew rave reviews. I'll definitely make it again!

Made the recipe as written with one exception, used a plain pie crust. The filling is fabulous. Consistancy is perfect and I agree with another cook, no sieve is necessary as long as you wisk well while the filling is cooking. I think I will stick with a plain crust going forward as I don't think addding more sweetness would improve on an already perfect filling.

i've been making this pie for almost 10 yrs, and it is still my favorite cream pie. i use an oreo crust lifted from another recipe, but it's the light, pudding-like texture of this recipe that's exceptional. i use dark, bitter chocolate to offset the sweeter crust. agree with others who say use good quality chocolate, though when i didn't it was still great. the first time you work the custard it seems to take forever to "turn" (definitely not one minute) but be patient. it'll become thick and gooey and lusciously scrumptious. i also don't own a sieve but that didn't make a difference.

This pie is easy to make and has a nice deep chocolate flavor. However, the texture of the filling lacks finesse and sublety. I was expecting a creamy, silken texture, but got a very dense almost "mud pie-like" texture. I'll keep looking for a better recipe.

I have made this pie several times and it has always been a hit. My friends always beg me to make it again. I've used different types of chocolate every time and recommend Valhrona, it takes it to another level.

This pie tasted good but didn't look that good. The filling came out a little runny and didn't hold up. Next time I'll use more cornstarch. The actual taste of the filling was very good. I used a store-bough pie crust that worked just fine. I'll definitely make this again - just with a few adjustments.

I loved the semi-sweetness of the filling and the wonderful creamy texture. Thanks for the tips to use Valrhona chocloate - it was divine. I made the cream another day using Valrhona white chocolate and served it as a custard - it was equally wonderful.

Soooo good...I used valharona and regular hersheys unsweetened...I was a little leary about the crust, but it was delicious. This recipe made two 8 or 9 inch pies. I only added two tablespoons of unsalted butter to the warm filling & it was fine. Will make again & again!

This pie was fabulous! Took the advice of a reviewer and whisked the custard mixture like mad from start to finish. Did't have any problem with the eggs scrambling or the milk burning which was great. I used a shortbread crust, baked, added filling and popped in the freezer before I had to present to pie. On the big day I decorated with whipped cream, served and was pleased with the praise the pie received. Will certainly be making this again soon!!

If you bring everything but the egg, butter,and vanilla to a boil, then temper the eggs(add hot mixture to eggs, about 1/3 of hot mixture) bring back to boil, adding butter and vanilla after the final boil, you will have no problems. I learned this from BH&G older cookbook.

I made this for a bridal shower and again for Thanksgiving and it's a permanent addition to my collection. Definitely make it the day before b/c the longer it chills, the better. My only comment is that the crust is very crumbly so getting it "just right" on the edges is tough. It doesn't matter though b/c the filling holds it all together after setting. TO DIE FOR!

My filling didn't set, even though I made it the day before and it all looked very good. I ended up freezing it, and it tasted like Fudgesicle pie, so all was not lost.

Excellent pie. I followed the advice on how not to scramble the yolks so there was no need to sieve. I stood and stirred constantly and had no problems with lumps or burning. It looked professional with the whipped cream (NO need to use more than the recipe calls for on one pie) and shaved chocolate. Guests were impressed. EASY

This is one of my favorite desserts! Every time I make it, it gets raves. I used Valrhona chocolate and followed the recipe exactly. If you watch the heat, you should not have to strain the custard. Very decadent.

Large quantity info: Multiplying the recipe by six yields 10 nicely filled 9" pies (in the short disposable aluminum pans, with a standard flour, shortening, ice water, salt pie crust). Definitely heat the milk up separately before you add it to the eggs and sugar as you may scorch the bottom if you are doing large quantities and you have to use a inferior aluminum stock pot. These pies were a hit with the Men's Night participants at a retirement community. Very chocolately!

The filling on this pie was wonderful, with a pudding-like texture and a rich chocolate taste. I added a bit of sugar, though, as the filling wasn't quite as sweet as I wanted. Also, I didn't have any heavy cream on hand, so I made a meringue topping with the leftover 6 egg whites and baked at 350 for 12-15 minutes. I also used my own regular baked pie shell. I will definitely make this again--it's easy and very satisfying!

If you like chocolate cream pies, you will absolutely love this one. It has a very generous amount of filling, rich, smooth flavor, and is easy to make. I do offer some suggestions that might be helpful: It is not necessary to strain a cream pie filling if you do not add the egg yolks in the beginning of the cooking process. This is how I do it. I combine the cornstarch, salt, and sugar, making sure to stir it all together well. I heat my milk in the microwave to just below boiling, then add it in a slow stream to the cornstarch mixture, stirring constantly. If you add a small amount and stir that in, then a bit more, etc., you will avoid having the cornstarch lump. After a bit, you can pour the remainder in all at once. Cook this over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until it gets almost as thick as you want it to be, then remove it from the heat. Have the egg yolks in a bowl (large enough to add some filling to it). Beat them with a fork. Slowly, add some of the hot pie filling to the yolks, stirring as you do so. This "tempers", or warms, the yolks so you won't have bits of cooked egg in your filling. After you have added a cup or two of the filling to the yolks, it is warm enough that you can pour into the remaining hot filling. Put the pan back on the heat and allow it to cook for a couple of minutes, or until quite thick, stirring constantly. This technique works for any cream filling and always results in a perfectly smooth mixture that requires no straining. Vanilla (or other flavoring) and butter is added at the very end. Try this pie!

This pie cannot be rushed. Prepare far enough in advance so it can fully set. Also, no need to strain if you're skillful with a whisk.

This recipe is wonderful! My boyfriend and I were invited to a friend's place for dinner, so we made it as a little project the night before. We decided to use chocolate wafer crumbs instead of vanilla, and it worked really well. I was a bit worried because even though I had the custard on low heat and continually stirred it, it still burnt a little on the bottom, but when I strained it, it was fine. It was very fun to make and our friends said it was the BEST chocolate pie they'd ever had. The chocolate is rich, but with the whipped cream on top it is absolutely lovely. We are making it again next week!

My husband just made this for me for Mother's Day, and I thought it was fabulous! I found the crust to be extra tasty, but can understand others idea about using a traditional crust; that would make for a different overall flavor sensation. I plan on making this pie a lot in my future.

I made this pie with the crust recipe provided, but found the overall taste to be too sweet. I again made the pie using my homemade pie crust, (your typical bland pie shell), and the pie had a whole new taste. I want to make this pie every week. It was the best chocolate cream pie I had ever eaten. Finding the Ghiardelli chococate is keeping me from doing so.

Made this last year on Valentines Day, if you like chocolate cream pie you will love this recipe.

This is a fabulous pie--thick, rich, and creamy. It made one very large pie, and even when sliced into twelve, the pieces were big. I made a conventional butter crust rather than the cookie crust called for in the recipe and used 2% milk in the filling. I didn't bother straining the filling but used a wire whisk vigorously while cooking to ensure there would be no lumps.

As an avid Pie maker I loved this. Didn't seive the chocolate at all and it came out good. I made a cream cheese/butter/sugar/flour crust and it was better than the cookie crust-a very rich chocolate pie, the cookie crust would have been to much chocolate. I also would recommend Doubling the cream topping.

The pudding was so easy to make, and was rich and chocolatey. Saw no need to "force thru a sieve" but did it anyway. I think that step is only necessary if you "scramble the eggs." All guests LOVED IT, though they agreed it is too rich a dessert for after a big dinner (in this case, Thanksgiving!) I wasn't impressed with the crust at all. I'll make my own next time. Also, this pudding was so delicious while still warm (had to taste-test, didn't I?), I'm going to serve it that way over a slice of chocolate pound cake next time. One guest summed this dessert up, "I'm having a gastronomic orgasm!!"

Boy, do people love this pie! I make a traditional pie crust (the one for spirited pumpkin pie on this site is excellent), bake it and cool it before filling it. You can make the filling a day ahead and fill in the morning you're going to use it. I use 9 1/2 " pyrex plates and the effect is "mile high" with all filling and whipped cream used. I've also made this with milk chocolate chips and it's good, too, especially for kids.

Amazing pie. I made two 9 inch pies with this recipie, but increased the amount of vanilla wafer crumbs and butter accordingly. I didn't have a 10 inch pan, but I can see where a 10 inch pan would create a huge, wonderful pie. Dartmouth students loved it!
