This is a nice, everyday cake. The apple flavors did come through - perhaps my Golden Delcious were especially fragrant. I believe this recipe actually deserves two and a half forks - not quite three.

This was good and interesting. I added more fruit (by about 50%) and cut down slightly on the sugar (7/8 c), but found that it needed the full cup, because it was a little tart. Liked the ginger, but if there were more in there, it would have been too much. Wish I had added a little cinnamon along with the ginger, as I think it needs it. Creamy, smooth batter/cake. The cooked apples are perfect, because despite adding a lot of fruit, the cake was not soupy at all. Also, I found that I needed the full 50 minutes. I used frozen raspberries, and they worked out just fine.

Excellent! Great results for very little effort. Agree with some reviews, apple taste is barely noticeable, cooking time might be less than what is indicated ... However the end result is great. A minor comment, it is important to spread the raspberries evenly, otherwise some parts might be excessively moist and might break when cutting whilst other parts might be dryer. Do try it! You will succeed! Brgds

Simple ingredients, simple to make but extra good. After the apples were cooked, I gently stirred in a generous cup of frozen berries and let them sit while I made the batter. They thawed and worked well. I used 'Granny Smith' apples since I like their tartness in baked goods. Gave it a good sprinkle of powdered sugar once it was out of the oven and had cooled a bit. I will definitely make it again for the holidays -- the bright red fruit center looked very festive; I think it will be perfect for Christmas morning.

The recipe was just what I needed for a bumper crop of pears and raspberries. Very simple and straitforward, and excellent made with good eggs. Next time I will use more fruit.

Easy to make and always loved by the crowd. I have given out the recipe more times than I can count. One note, I have had trouble with the middle getting done, so I started using a bundt pan and have had no trouble since.

This was sooo good. I used 3 apples and flambed them in 4 TBS of creme de framboise and also used an extra TBS of lemon juice. Didn't have fresh raspberries but the frozen kind worked just as well. Served it warm with cinnamon flavoured whipped cream. Delicious!

Used blueberries instead of raspberries-- turned out a bit more breakfast-ish than I was hoping for (kind of like a really yummy muffin), but the apple flavor was delicious.

Has waaayyyy too much butter, but wonderful flavors and textures. I'd substitute out 3 tbsp of the butter in the cake mix part and add in a heavy apple sauce instead to cut out the tummy ache.

For such a simple recipe, this is astonishingly good. The flavors are far more complex and tasty than I expected before I read it. Wonderful! Definitely nice enough to serve to company but simple enough to make whenever you have the raspberries.

Oh goodie, goodie!! I've made this cake over and over, and everytime it is SCRUMPTIOUS!! A little cognac in the apples is very nice, and I also think that it could work nicely with peaches and blueberries...

I also used a 9" spring form and found it was a little short.I think I will bake in 8" next time to give it some height,still very pretty,dusted with icing sugar and really delicious.Thinking of flambeeing the apples next time too,perhaps calvados or maybe ginger wine?

Yum. This is a great everyday cake, but also works well for entertaining. I made mine in a 9-inch round spring form pan, and sprinkled with confectioner's sugar. I also added some fresh blackberries along with the apples and raspberries. We had some friends over, and served this for desert, accompanied with french vanilla ice cream. It was a perfect end to a lovely meal.

Wonderful recipe for a nice fruity cake. I think next time I will try some brandy in it without ginger.

I and my cake fans liked the combination and texture of cooked apples and berries. Nice change for usual apple cake. Delucious and fragrant. I baked it in a spring form and took rum instead of vanilla. Is quick and easy and the result is just outstanding, worth to make again.

Really tasty cake, though mine was a little dry from baking for the suggested time. Next time I'll try 35-40 min. Looks great once sliced, nice change from chocolate.

I also made the cake in a 9-inch springform pan. Very nice presentation. Apples were not too tart. Will definitely make again!

Am I the only one who found that this cake was fully brown and tested done after 30 minutes? Also, the apple taste was not very prominent, I would use more fruit. It would probably be tasty with peaches and/or other berries, as well.

Cake was moist; however this is more suited to afternoon tea rather than served after dinner. Also, this cake is great for warmer weather. Found that substituting other berries (in the freezer section during winter) also worked really well. Any combination that goes well with apple and is juicy (peaches, blueberries, etc) will work in place of rasberries. Although it does not outrank cheescake, this is definitely a keeper.

This was really delicious. I found the etxra step of having to cook the apples a little annoying, but overall, everyone loved the tart flavor mixed with the delicious cake

I've made this recipe twice and got raves both times. It's a nice, light, moist cake. The first time I baked it in a square pan as directed and it was just fine cut into squares, but the second time, I baked it in a springform pan (for company). I found it made a nicer presentation. Although I haven't tried yet, I suppose one could substitute many fruit combinations,such as peaches and blueberries, for example. Delicious and easy to make!

Delicious. I served it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Not too heavy.

Very easy to make exactly as the recipe calls out. I used one of the new scalloped style baking pans to bake in then dusted powder sugar on top and trimed the platter with fresh mint. It made a beautiful presentation. The office loved it. The cake is very moist and has a light and refreshing summer taste.

Scrumptious!! Needed only 40 minutes of oven time however, so keep an eye on it. Will definately make again. No ingredient changes necessary!

My customers loved this cake. Next time I will substitute fresh mango for the apple and substitute ground cardamom reduced by half (1/8 t. of very fragrant cardamom). In the original recipe, I used 1T. minced candied ginger in place of the ground ginger, it sets off the apples nicely. It should be added to apples when cooking.
