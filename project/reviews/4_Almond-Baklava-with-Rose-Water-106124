I had never made baklava before when I tried this recipe... it was a modest success. My only issue was the rose water. I don't know if 2 tsp is too much for my taste, or if the rose water I got was just especially potent, or if my hand got a little shaky when I measured it out, but the end result was very... fragrant. So much so that all the utensils I used in the cooking process still smell rosy. Besides that, however, this baklava is pretty darn good. I'll definitely try again some time.

I thought this was good, but not great. I followed the recipe but I substituted cloves for the allspice and added fresh-ground cardamom to the nut mixture. I made the syrup the night before and let it steep in the fridge overnight. Assembly took only 15 minutes. It looked great right out of the oven. I really liked the almonds; much lighter than the traditional walnuts. My guests loved it with coffee following a gyros dinner. Next time I'll up the spices to better suit my tastes.

This recipe is deceptively easy! I created more layers, as a few more phyllo sheets came in a single package and didn't want to save them. Also added 1 tsp of the traditional Turkish spice, Mahlab, whizzed in a spice grinder. This was the final course of a cooking demo/wine pairing dinner, and went great with a Sauternes.

If I could give more forks I would!!! I made this for the first time and it was absolutely fabulous... had many compliments... I was told by numerous people that it was the best Baklava they had ever had. I made a few alterations to the recipe. I added 2 tsp rosewater and 2 tsp orange blossom water to the syrup, as well as 1 tsp rosewater and 1 tsp orange blossom water to the nut mixture. I also added about half a teaspoon of Pumpkin pie spice.... incredibly delicious!!!!!!!

I used pistachios instead of almonds. I also used double rose water and boiled the syrup another 15 minutes until it had a syrupy consistency when I pulled a spoon from it. I score the top layer with criss crosses, bake, THEN add the syrup. It's best the next day after the phyllo dough soaks up the syrup.

Very nice. Added a bit extra rose water and a an extra cinnamon stick. My guests raved! The rose water makes the recipe.

I was so excited to try this recipe, with all the rave reviews it received. The honey-mixture that gets poured on at the end, mine was watery, not even the least bit thick. I spooned on more than the 1 cup suggested, as another reviewer said it was too dry with just one cup. Now the pastry is soggy! I put it back in the oven hoping it will crisp up again. Any suggestions as to what I did wrong?

"I use a combination of nuts, pecans, walnuts and almonds, and my father..." I also use a nut combo but omit close relations. Too bitter.

I've made this dish many times (for special events so I don't end up eating the whole pan myself) and of late have made individual rolls out of strips of filo. I use a combination of nuts, pecans, walnuts and almonds, and my father, who hates walnuts, couldn't stop eating these bite-size baklavas. I made them for a tea, along with other goodies, and while the leftovers were scattered about the kitchen, my aunt hid the extra baklava.

This recipe is very good. The first time I made it I reserved the bulk of the syrup to pour over the baklava when serving it but it came out dry that way. Better to pour most of the syrup and let it sit and get nice and gooey. Will definately make again.

I thought I invented almond baklava, but this recipe beat me to it! I prefer to toast the chopped almonds for extra crispiness. I also bake the bottom 5 layers of buttered filo for about 10 minutes prior to resuming the layers of nuts and filo for crunch. Finally, for that to-die-for touch, add a semi sweet chocolate chip to the top center of each pastry diamond while it is hot. Fantastico!!

Fabulous recipe, somewhat labor intensive but well worth it! trying to amek it 'healthier", I used only 1 cup of sugar for the syrup and will use even less next time, used up less than one stick of melted butter to brush the pastry, and it still came out rich and delicious. everyone was speculating on what the "secret ingredient" might be, the rose water makes this recipe!

This is not a traditional baklava, but it is oh so good. I ate the whole tray in two days by myself. Idid serve itwith the yogurt or the extra sauce. Once it was cooked I never refridgeated it. This is very, very good. I used 2 cupts almonds, 1 cup pistatious, but next time I will use only almonds.

Delicious and very easy to prepare! I used about 1 cup pistachios and 2 cups almonds. I poured over a bit more syrup than the recipe suggested, but it was still not too sweet. A much better baklava than most I've purchased.

I thought this was something I would make just during the holidays. Wrong. This is an excellent recipe and with my husbands help it wasn't too hard either. I am now making it year-round for desert.

Excellent. My guests loved this. It's easy and impressive. The yogurt is an unexpectedly nice accompaniment, cutting the sweetness of the syrup.
