I found this a challenging recipe because there is quite a lot to do in order to complete it - it is an unusually complex recipe for a simple frosted, filled cake. It took us a long time to get the maple syrup to the soft ball stage; I did use Grade A amber (Kirkland brand) but it was a little watery. it kept bubbling over so we kept having to shift it off the heat til it stopped spilling. I used gluten free flour from Dove's Farm (A UK brand)- it worked just fine, though one layer ended up fairly flat. The texture is nice but a little dry (not unusual with GF flour), and the flavour is just wonderful. I frosted the top of each layer in a sort of dish shape to try to help keep the pears in place - only partly successful. Frosting the sides was tricky - surprisingly I felt I could have done with more buttercream (at the start it had looked like more than we could use). Despite the difficulties I would make it again, the flavours made the effort worthwhile.

The spice cake was uninspiring and came out dry. The maple buttercream was a giant chunky mess and never "came together" as the others suggest. Plus it's solid butter and gives everything a greasy taste. I ended up cooking and straining it and using it as a sauce. There was no way this cake was going to come together into layers either. It falls all over the place. I think I'll go back to pear upside-down cakes.

The actual review is shy three forks. I made the cake as prescribed. Each of the three components: cake, pears and frosting were very good by themselves but combining them made the overall taste simply good. The final product is a dense and moist cake.I believe this item would do better made as a loaf, like a quick bread and you would combine the pears into the batter. One comment on the frosting, it will appear to curdle and seperate but it will come together.

I made this for my husband's birthday yesterday. The cake had good flavor, the buttercream was delicious as were the pears. I would cut the butter in half for the pears next time as they were a bit greasy but once nestled in the buttercream, it wasn't as noticible. Everyone cleaned their plates and I would definitely make this again.
