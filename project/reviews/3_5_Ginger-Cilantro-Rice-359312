I actually made a mistake with this recipe I forgot that the cilantro was going to be blended, and I threw it in with the rice. At that point, I just mixed in the other ingredients, and skipped the 3tbs oil. I really enjoyed the result, and it got high marks from my family.

Great summer side dish. I make it in my dutch oven so I can use the lid to keep the flies out when dining outdoors :-)

The first time I made this dish I found the oil taste overwhelming. Stuck for a 'different' side dish I retried this recipe......it turned out wonderful. I totally missed out the veg. oil, was heavy on the ginger and added four crushed garlic cloves. I don't normally redo any recipe but being a ginger and cilantro lover I am so glad I did. Without a doubt this is a keeper, gone is the plain boiled rice.

I love this recipe! If you like spicy food, adding Serrano chiles goes perfectly with it. Also, if you want this to be more of a main course, add shrimp when the rice is almost done and wait 5-10 minutes (depending on the size of the shrimp). Delicious!

I really wanted to like this recipe! I love cilantro and ginger. I don't have a food processor, so I used what I have.. a magic bullet. I know that sometimes you want to add oils gradually while blending, but you can't do that with the bullet and it doesn't exactly say to in the recipe, so I dumped it all in and went for it. Anyway, the rice turned out really sort of bitter-tasting due to the sesame oil I believe. Is that just how sesame oil tastes? It could just be me. What could I have done wrong?

This rice is AMAZING. I rarely make rice any other way now.

Excellent and easy dish....I cooked this dish in microwave for 15 minutes, used Swanson reduced-sodium chicken broth, fresh ginger, and two (2) tablespoons of vegetable oil rather than three and one (1) tablespoon of sesame oil...served with an asian shrimp stir fry...

This was missing something.... lemon? Salt? I dunno I kept adjusting and still wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be. I'm sure with a variety of adjustments this could be interesting but on it's own it was hit and a miss.

Yum, this rice was delicious. I would make more next time. Also, with picky kids, I divided the rice so that they had some pre-cilantro mixed in. They loved it. I used 2T of the vegetable oil. It went very well with the Grilled Asian Chicken with Bok Choy... recipe.

this was fabulous. The amount of oil was perfect - you just really need to work the emulsification so that it's smooth. Brought this to a potluck and it disappeared. Topped with a grilled chicken breast this would be a terrific picnic dinner. Will definitely be making again.

Great flavor and color! I used only 1 T of oil and 1 T of sesame oil, however, after reading other reviews. Turned out fine. I'll make it again.

This is a great rice recipe. I made it with 2 cups of Gen Ji Mai whole grain brown rice for better nutrition. I used 2 cups of rice, and 3 cups plus of chicken broth. With this quantity of rice I did not find there was too much oil. The key is to make sure you create an emulsion so the oil does not separate. You could jazz up the left over rice with chopped chicken, tomatoes, celery slices, green onion and pine nuts for a nice rice salad.

This recipes turns out a really delicious rice dish. I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was perfect (just make sure to season well with salt and pepper). I'll double this next time. Served with tacos.

Really enjoyed this. Though needed to add more broth (approx 2 cups) in order for rice to cook through. For the cilantro blend, I too cut back on the oil, added soy sauce and increased the vinegar. Would definitely make again.

I used short grain brown rice instead of the white rice but other than that I followed the recipe as written. I found the taste of the oils to be totally unappetizing. Perhaps if I had switched it to olive oil like some people did I would have had better results.

unimpressive, 18 minuets too long for rice as well. double the ginger

I should have read the reviews before making this dish. 3tablespoons oil was way to much. We loved the flavor of ginger and cilantro and will make it again but next time will use 1 tablespoon olive oil instead.

This is delicious and intriguing! I went with the advice of other posters and cut the oil (1 tbls. sesame oil and 1 tbls. vegetable oil) and was glad I did; it was perfect. One of my guests professes to hate ginger but loved this recipe and said, "I can't stop eating this!"

Delish!! Wonderful flavor!! Turned out I didn't have all the ingredients, but it was still very tasty! I didn't have any vegetable oil so I used a splash of olive oil along with the sesame oil. I had to use ginger paste instead, too. And no rice vinegar.

What a wonderful mix of flavors...Loved it...I actually added 2 garlic cloves to the cilantro and green onion puree and it just gave it alittle bit more but I will definitely make this again :)

This was yummy. I was afraid the ginger might be too overwhelming but not at all. nice with coriander lamb chops (another recipe on epicurious). Maybe it was a bit of extra work, but I liked the idea of adding in the oil/cilantro mixture at the end as I have not had much luck in the past cooking the cilantro or other herbs right along with the rice. Not cooking the cilantro perhaps preserved its flavor and texture. This also would make a nice room temp. salad for a buffet or luncheon.

Easy and interesting update to plain white rice. Made this twice already - love it! Second time around, decreased the oil from 3 tbsp to 2, but still seemed a bit oily. Also added in a splash of soy sauce. Will definitely add to the rotation of sides.

Not a review, just a comment... I've been making cilantro rice for years; just add chopped cilantro to the water, rice and salt then cook like normal. This is great as a base for Indian, Mexican, and Asian foods. Anytime I have left over cilantro (or parsley, basil, oregano) I chop it in the food processer with a pinch of salt and a few drops of olive oil. This keeps in the freezer and is available to add into the pot when needed. I'm sure this recipe is great, just a lot more work than I've found necessary.

I've made this 3 times now and we LOVE IT. I love the way the chicken broth gives the rice a stickier consistency. Also, I too thought the oil was a bit much. I used 2 tbsp of olive oil and it works just fine. However, I also found that adding 1-2 tbsp of water to the mixture helps with the blending and makes it a bit smoother. So easy to make and is so versatile - easily added to my favorites list!

This is our new "go to" rice dish. It's a perfect accompaniment to a fish entree, and I know we would dig it with chicken as well. I used my rice cooker which took a simple recipe and made it child's play. The Cilantro mixture was made in advance and kept at room temp. When the rice was done, it was a snap to remove the ginger "coins", then a quick mix in of the sauce, and we were two VERY happy campers. Hey Bon Appetit...keep those recipes comin' !

I made this with brown basmati rice and mushroom broth, reduced the oil to 1 T canola and 1 tsp sesame oil. I really dislike greasy food and the amount of oil sounded awful. The amount that I used worked fine proportionately, though next time I will use 2 tsp canola and 2 tsp sesame. Flavor was good and it was a hit with dinner.

I didn't have the sesame oil and it turned out fabulous anyway! Great, easy recipe especially for summer. Its a family favorite already.

We made this recipe almost as written (added only a chili pepper to the rice while cooking) and LOVED it, although I agree that there is a bit too much oil in the cilantro dressing - could probably use half as much and still get the same flavour. Worked really well with the rest of the Asian Grilled Chicken menu.

Simple to make with lots of room to experiment. I thought it waste creative and pretty tasty.

I made this as directed, except used brown rice (takes longer) and water instead of stock. The rice was a little too oily and bland alone, but I made it into some fried rice with egg mixed with soya sauce and it was delicious -- next time I'll make crunchy garlic bits for the top.

Made this recipe as is and it's only decent. BUT with the addition of more sesame oil and a touch of honey, it's AMAZING!! Total keeper!
