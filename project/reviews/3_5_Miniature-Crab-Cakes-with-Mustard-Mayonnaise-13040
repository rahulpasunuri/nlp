Perfect little appetizer. Guess the people who have a problem with them holding together is that they are making them too large. There is a reason they are called "miniature." The sauce is delicious.

I agree with the other reviewers who said the crab cake needs a little bit of bread crumbs (panko or regular) to hold it together to be an hors d'oeuvre; otherwise, it is so delicate that it falls apart. Or it could be eaten as written with a fork. The simplicity of the dish works beautifully.

I thought this recipe was very good. I made the crab cakes the day before my dinner party. I made the cakes small per the recipe and they formed easily and stayed together well. They worked well as finger food. Nice tasty morsels and I will make again.

Loved these! I love that you could make them ahead, though I did not. I had no problems with the red peppers and used a homemade, fresh French mayo that I got at Central Market. I used this both in the cakes and when making the dip. It already has a bit of mustard in it. I also had no problems forming them (used just the egg yolk as called for). I just formed them in my palms and made them bite-sized. My mixture and size made exactly 42! I used a 1lb container of lump crab from Sam's Club.

The crab cakes are tasty but not easy to eat. The idea of making miniatures seemed like a good one for a cocktail party but these cakes don't hold together well enough to eat as a snack. They need a plate and fork. I used very high quality crab and made no changes in the recipe. I got about 30, not 42 cakes. The mustard mayo was OK but I've had better crab cake toppers. Not really worth the effort and I won't make again.

Easy and excellent. I couldn't get 'em out of the oven fast enough. Only thing I added was one minced jalapano pepper and 1 additional egg yoke. Didn't have tarragon so used basil and majoram and a slight sprinkling of Old Bay. I've made these a lot and I've gotten really good at forming them (I don't even need to chill it anymore). I can get 30-33 out of the 1lb. Always make ahead and freeze them. Soooo easy and good. There is a lemon basil mayo on this site that is excellent with them.

I created this recipe a little diff. I didn't have them cold. I baked half of the crab cakes and then seered some in a pan in olive oil. Made them actually as dinner and they were just delish. When I have more time (I didn't read the recipe closer about all the chilling and such) I will for sure try it the correct chilled way but this way they were still good and a hit. The mustard mayo was also just as delish. My best friend's 4yr old daughter loved the mustard mayo even on the veggies she had, lol. This is going to be on my "make again" list.

Rating: 2
Sorry. I didn't think this was such a great recipe. Used the whole egg, added worcester and old bay seasoning like others suggested. I didn't have any problems with it sticking together but it tasted like plain old crab meat to me (and I used good stuff). I'll try another recipe next time.

These are wonderful crab cakes! Great mix of flavors, and the panko crust adds a nice semi-crunchy texture without the fat of frying. I mixed the ingredients the night before, assembled mid morning before a luncheon, then only had to put them in the oven when guests arrived. Great crab cake recipe.

Left out the bell pepper based on recommendations. Otherwise made it to the letter and it was very good. Note: they do hold together after forming, cooling, and baking. When forming, they seem to be liquid but they'll hold up in the end, rest assured. Just be gentle and cup your hand around them when breaded to reinforce the cake shape. Leave out the tarragon unless you really love it, I thought it gave an overwhelming aroma to the cakes that was unpleasant. Used canned jumbo lump from Costo as others did. This recipe made about 11 cakes 3 inch in diatmeter, 1 inch high. No 42 cakes going on here, unless they each had one morsel fo crab each.

Rating: 4
I would give this 5 forks if I could. So good and SO easy. I didn't find them hard to form at all, I just added some panko to the mix before I refrigerated. I did cut back on the red pepper, 1/2 cup seemed like way too much. I suggest doubling the recipe. No way this yields 42 crab cakes, even if they are miniature. Definitely use the panko. I broiled these another couple of minutes after they baked. They turned out crispy and perfect. A definite hit!

Consistent every year and I plan to make it even more than just for the holidays. Perhaps the best thing is that you can make everything in advance which allows you to enjoy the your guest a little more.

I had some trouble with getting the panko crumbs on. The recipe calls for you to take teaspoonfuls and flatten but when i did that, the whole thing fell apart.. I ended up using the crab mixture as a dip but it didn't go over very well. The next morning, I baked the crab cakes I had made but not used the day before and they tasted really good. Especially with the mustard mayo but they just didn't hold together. I will try again though.

These are a great make-ahead hors d'oerve. I follow the receipe as written (adding a little Old Bay Seasoning as recommended by other posters), form them into the patties with their panko coating (the trick is to handle them very, very gently) and then FREEZE them in a single layer on a baking pan. When frozen, toss into freezer bags (up to a month before you need them). When you're ready to serve, bake as directed (don't thaw first) -- just leave in a little longer. They're perfect every time!

I've made this twice with rave reviews. The only reason I give it 3 forks is because of the prep time - it's a family favorite. Yummy!

I read all the previous reviews and decided to make it as originally described. I could not find panko crumbs locally so used regular bread crumbs! It was very delicious!

I made this twice and had the same results both times....impossible to keep these little things together and even if you can get them on the cookie sheet to bake, they are still too soft to stay together when people try to pick them up to eat them. The taste was not good enought to overlook the mess.

As a crab cake purist, I thought the red bell pepper overwhelmed the crab flavor - even after only using half the amount. They were tricky to handle and tended to fall apart but a good, pure crab cake without fillers shouldn't stick together so easily. Mine came out browned and crunchy by really toasting the Panko well and then spritzing with Pam. I also used the 1lb can of jumbo lump from Costco - it was excellent and I wouldn't use anything different. The sauce was fine but i don't need sauce with such a great crab cake. Overall, a good recipe but I'll cut back on the red pepper some more or maybe omit altogether.

Rating: 4
Love these! They're light, crunchy, and hold together perfectly after baking. The sauce is a wonderful foil for them. Experiment with the lemon (I used a lot more). Made them for the 3rd time last night for a huge crowd. Following the suggestions of previous reviewers, I add some Old Bay seasoning and Worcestershire to taste and also use the 1 pound can from Costco. Using the whole egg really binds it together.

This was the first time that I attempted to make crab cakes. They were absolutely delicious. While they were messy to handle, the next time I make them I would place the panko on a sheet of wax paper, so the bottoms are coated, then I would spoon the crumbs over the top and press gently so they adhere. I did follow the suggestion of misting with olive oil, but they did not get real brown. Perhaps had I baked them longer they would have browned more.

LOVED THESE!!!!! After reading the reviews, I went ahead and used the whole egg. It was great being able to make these ahead of time. IF there had been any leftover, they would have been great cold on a toasted english muffin. I don't think I'll ever get the chance to do that, unless I make it specifically for that reason! Ya gotta try 'em!

I made twice already. Found it best with lump crab - used the 1LB can from Costco - delicious and much much easier to work with versus normal cans of crab. I used a basil aioli sauce instead of mustard mayo. Delicious.

This turned out really well. For more seasoning, I added 1 tbsp Old Bay seasoning and 1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce (from other recipes) and 1/2 tsp minced garlic. Also used the whole egg to help it stick together. For the red pepper - I sauteed first and then drained on paper towels. Never had a problem with them staying together and they turned out beautifully.

i made a few adjustments... adding leek, added texture, and flavor. adding some panko to the crab mixture before chilling also helped mixture hold its shape. sauce was great, try adding horseradish if you like, or even wasabi.

I have just starting to use the Panko breadcrumbs and they do make all the difference in the world. However, when making crabcakes, I would form them, refrigerate them and just before frying them, I would coat them with the crumbs. That way the crumbs stay crispy.

I was highly disappointed in these crab cakes. I made the crab mixture and refrigerated it overnight, and when I came back to it the next day, instead of it being a solid mixture, it was a pile of crabmeat sitting in a pool of sauce! It was nearly impossible to form into patties, although they did stay together after baking. However, they were tasteless! They tasted to me like crabmeat with almost NO seasoning. The only flavor came from the sauce. I can't figure out all of these great reviews, and I followed the recipe exactly. I will not be making these again.

My girls,ages 3,5,9,thought they were delicious!!! I must admit that the sauce was just okay. I made some more today and used a sauce of thai chili dipping sauce,sugar,cilantro, and rice wine vinegar. we enjoyed that even better. They are easy to prepare!

These are the best crab cakes I've had. The red bell pepper really compliments the taste of the crab cake. I did not have panko so I just made bread crumbs from a loaf of french bread that I had and it worked fine. I also made the crab cakes bigger because I served it as a main dish for dinner. Delicious!

Served these at a cocktail party for clients - really wonderful. They were a bit damp and messy to assemble and the panko breadcrumbs definitely "make" the difference!

These are incredible. No filling, lump crab and the panko was perfect. I left out the tarragon, added some minced jalapeno and sauteed it with the red pepper. I skipped the mustard mayo and served with a spicy aioli made of mayo, garlic, cumin, chili powder, dash of cayenne & lime juice! Rave reviews from my guests.

Made these for a Champagne tasting. As soon as I brought them out of the oven, they disappeared. What makes this so good is that there is no breadcrumb "filler." Highly recommend the mustard mayonniase. I also added a touch of horseradish. Oh, I couldn't find panko, so I briefly sauted some breadcrumbs with the butter called for. I then dipped each side of the crab cake in the buttered breadcrumbs before baking. I can't imagine how they could have been better.

The basic recipe is great. I didn't have all the same ingredients and made a few other adjustments as I was really hungry for crab cakes. Try it using Jack Daniel brand Horseradish Mustard, add 1/3 tsp. cayenne pepper and 1 Tbl. fresh minced chives. I also used the whole egg. It was sooooo yummy!

I have a catering service in NYC and was tired of my old recipe. These were simple to make I baked them at the party and people devoured them, no they inhaled them and couldn't get enough. I used claw crabmeat instead of lump and it workd fine. If you van not find stone ground mustard Pommery Moutarde de Meaux is the same thing.

Sorry, but I was pretty disappointed with these crab cakes. I had a difficult time forming them into miniature balls, because they wanted to fall apart so badly. Also, I think the last step of adding 1/4 tsp of butter can be omitted because all it did was make my oven smoke like crazy, and didn't add much to the flavor. This recipe did not taste anything at all like crab cakes I've had in the past. While I did discover a new liking for stone-ground mustard (never tasted it before -- delicious), I won't be making this recipe again.

Total winner. I've made them a bunch of times for parties, and guests just can't get enough. When I made them for part of a Valentines Day dinner for my husband and me, I served them along side a small salad of greens - what an opening. And, we got to eat crab cake sandwiches for lunch for a few days. All our co-workers were jealous!

This was the appetizer at our gourmet dinner group last weekend. As hostess, I selected this recipe and gave it to two women to make. One made them the size suggested in the recipe and she used frozen crab meat. The other gal made them larger and used a good quality canned crab meat. Both were excellent .. and disappeared like magic. I think he panko is a must as these were better than most crab cakes I've eaten.

I did like these crab cakes but must implore fellow reviewers to try CRAB CAKES WITH BASIL MAYONNAISE (BA Sept '95) Unfortunately, this recipe is not posted on this site. They are truly delicious. (I sub panko for bread crumbs on all crab cake recipes as it does improve final product)

I made these crab cakes for the first time a month ago at a dinner party and they disappeared within minutes. Since I live abroad in the U.A.E.,I could not get fresh pre-picked lump crab meat and I had to buy fresh crabs. Cleaning them was tedious and the meat quantity was less. So, the second time I made the cakes I opted to add some tinned crab to the fresh one and the result was as good. Also, I have found that substituting panko with cornflakes works well.And adding some fresh bread crumbs helps too if you can't handle the mixture.

I served this at a cocktail party - it's a great and impressive 'finger food' appetizer. It's easy to make. Shaping the crabcakes was the only time consuming step. I was able to find Panko which is a must for the recipe. I substituted non-fat mayo and used a little more bell pepper than the recipe called for.

I modified this recipe to include more Southwestern spices such as cumin, red pepper and chili powder and used cilantro instead of tarragon - its outstanding! Gretchen, stone ground mustard can be found next to the dijon mustard (condiments)in most grocery stores. Try again, you need it for the proper taste & texture - or substitute with dijon.

These crab cakes were devoured quickly by the guests at my dinner party. I made one batch with $20 per lb fresh crab meat and another with Trader Joe's canned crab meat. Both were great. My only problem was with the mustard. I don't think I know what stone ground mustard is. I used dried mustard and it was too strong. It must be the condiment, not the spice!

Terrific recipe - one of the best recipes for lump crabmeat. I made a couple minor modifications which came out great. I roasted the red pepper instead of sauteeing it and used homemade garlic mayonnaise, both in the cakes (and eliminated the additional egg yolk- binder) and thinned out with lemon juice as a sauce for serving.

I have been making this recipe since it was first published in 1995. Everytime I make these cakes, people rave -- most cannot believe they are baked and not fried. Panko is somewhat difficult to find -- try a Japanese or Vietnamese market -- I now use panko in my mixture to fry shrimp

I couldn't find Panko, so I used bread crumbs & it came out tremendous! I made them for an appetizer for a paty last weekend. I needed something I could make 1 day ahead so I wouldn't have to fuss the day of the party. Everyone loved them
