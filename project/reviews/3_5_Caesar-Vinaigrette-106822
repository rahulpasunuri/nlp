A really great and easy recipe. I did not want to use raw egg and this recipe really hit the spot for a caesar craving. Made it in the food processor and got the thumbs up from everyone who tried it.

Great caesar salad dressing recipe, especially for anyone who doesn't want to use raw egg. Don't be afraid of the cup of olive oil, the dressing makes more than 1 cup of salad dressing which is a lot. I blended in blender to make sure that garlic and anchovy wasn't noticeable. Will definitely make again and again!

Used dry mustard as had no Dijon on hand (in the rainforest at moment). Great template and will use again as this is much simpler but packs as much flavour as recipe I WAS using. Thanks! Sandra McNally Calgary/Panama

I had no anchovies, and my husband doesn't like them anyway (if I had them, I'd lay two across my salad). I made it as printed otherwise, added about 1/4 tsp. of sugar to off set the remaining tart taste from the lemon juice. I also added a bit of salt and pepper since I didn't have the added saltiness of the anchovies. Pretty darn good! There were only two of us for dinner, so the next night I added an egg yolk to the leftovers for a creamier dressing. I did like it a little better on night two.

This is an excellent caesar vinaigrette. The amount of oil doesn't flip me out. you are using 1/4 cup of lemon juice. I crave this dressing sometimes. I agree make this recipe!

This is really good caesar dressing. i made some croutons and added parmesan, and it was a delicious salad. I only used 1/2 cup of olive oil, and I thought it was PLENTY.

I wanted a traditional caesar with egg and so started by mixing a raw egg yolk with the mustard and about 1 tbsp of the lemon juice, then slowly added the olive oil. Once all of the olive oil had been incorporated i mixed in the rest of the other ingrediants, respecting the amounts shown and it was FABULOUS!

I opted to try this version over Food Networks olive oil version and, wow, I'm truly amazed there aren't more reviews/ratings for this recipe. It is awesome. So for those who are reluctant, don't assume by the low number of ratings that it is so-so. It is not!! This is THE caesar salad dressing you've been looking for all along. It is so very delicious!

Very good. I put less lemon juice to take off the sour after taste and I would recomend to put less oil. Good refreshing meal I also served with cheese biscuits.

First of all, I would never add 1 cup of oil to a salad dressing. If I wanted an extremely fattening dressing, I'd just go the to store and buy a pre-made creamy one. I only added 1 tbsp oil, which was fine, except that the dressing was pretty sour. But after a few bites, you get used to it. I liked it, but my boyfriend's face puckered quite a bit! I'll make it next time, again with only a tbsp of oil, but cut the lemon juice in half.

I have made this dressing twice. Second time I reduced lemon juice half as required amount is too much for our taste. Also, added an egg yolk for creamier texture and mixed ingredients in blender. With reduced juice it is perfect.

Quick & easy w/ lots of flavour--with some parmesan you don't notice any lack of egg yolk.

Very yummy. Only used 1/2 the oil and no salt. Anchovies make it salty enough!

Easy to prepare quickly, keeps well in the refrigerator. Good basic flavor on any salad -- not a knock-out dressing, but good.
