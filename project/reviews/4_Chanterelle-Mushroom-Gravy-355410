My husband found fresh chanterelles and made this recipe to top polenta for dinner. Instead of the flour, he used potato starch (for a gluten free gravy), and since we did not have shallots, he used regular onions, but it was still FABULOUS!!!

I found chanterelles on sale and made this gravy for my gas-grilled heritage turkey. Delicious! I used regular flour instead of Wondra, but strained the flour/broth mixture while adding it to the chanterelles. The leftovers--if there are any--will go into turkey pot pies.
