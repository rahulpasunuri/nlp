Roasted my own red bell peppers by using the broiler in my oven. I think that makes a thicker dip than using jarred. This is one of those recipes that is unexpectedly wonderful for not a lot of work. Will make it often. As other reviewers did, I also used sherry vinegar.

Delicious - I could eat the entire portion! I may try it on chicken sometime soon.

I initially chose this recipe because of how easy it was to make, and because I had all of the ingredients on hand (double bonus). I was so pleasantly surprised at how tasty this is, too, making this a definite repeat (non)offender in my recipe repertoire. What's more, I followed the recipe exactly, and found (unlike some others) that it didn't need to be beefed up at all (so long as you adequately drain the roasted red peppers) by adding garbanzo beans or the like - perfect a s i s. Served this with water crackers; for more than a few people, I'd double the recipe.

Very good. I used sherry vinegar and added a splash of lemon juice. I served this with a sliced baguette, but next time I'll serve it with veges, too.

Really delicious. It was a bit thin for my taste (maybe I wasn't generous enough with the olive oil), so I followed the tip from another reviewer and added a handful of chickpeas. Perfect.

Great with pita crisps for cocktail parties. Always a hit.

After having this at a friend's party, I made it myself and it was a big hit. As suggested by ring0969, I used Spanish sherry vinegar, and added a few chickpeas to give it more body. It's also a good sauce for pasta or cooked grains.

take it easy on the garlic. rough on ya in the morn'. using sherry vinegar instead adds a more creative taste than red wine.

It's 2:30 in the morning on Father's Day, and I just made this for our FD wing ding. I've never been so totally blindsided by tastiness. It's all I can do to keep from eating the whole batch straight out of the food processor with a spoon. I'm even considering licking the blades *very carefully*. It's just that good.

Very tasty and so easy to make. I roasted my own peppers and it wasn't even that time consuming.

The first time I tried this recipe my local super market was out of jar roasted red peppers so I used the ones from the bulk deli section and it missed the mark. The second time I roasted my own red bell peppers and add ¼ roasted Vidalia Onion and 1 raw large Long Green Hot Pepper both items helped to give it a little boost and it was very good. I cant wait until fresh vegetables are in season in Vermont because it will change it from good to out of this world.

This was perfect. I whipped it up in about five minutes, and served it with seared shrimp. It was wonderful.

I have served at many parties...great crowd pleaser. Try serving with toasted pita chips.

Loved this -- I used a jar of roasted peppers and garlic which made this super easy -- I also added pepper, and paprika which jazzed it up and salt.

Easy, flavorful, creamy. Garlic somewhat overwhelming--use a small clove or perhaps roast?

It is alright as written. But, not great. I had some roasted and boiled garlic left over from another recipe, so I tried adding them to this. For me, adding 1 large clove of roasted and 1 large clove of boiled garlic to the 1 large clove of raw garlic adds a complexity that works really well with the other ingedients. It is also pretty good as a topping for oily fish when thinned with additional olive oil. No matter how you serve it, it benefits from letting the flavors meld overnight.

This is a keeper. Definately not your common dip.

This was great and so easy! I normally make the "Romesco Style Roasted Pepper Dip" Bon Appetit 6/93, but in that recipe you need to roast the peppers yourself. This is so much simpler for a similar result.

I love this stuff!

My fiance is allergic to raw garlic so I roasted the cloves with the peppers and squeezed out the soft garlic pulp. Delicious!! Roasting the garlic also makes it easier to add more for a garlic-ier flavor.

Easy, delicious,versatile and good for you -what more can you ask for! Use good quality red peppers.

have made this a few times for several vegan/vegetarian friends. it is all that i am asked to bring to parties, and one says she makes all the time since i made it for our yoga retreat. i like mine 'garlic-y' but since it is raw you must be careful. a great alternative to mayo dips.

I don't get the big hoopla over this recipe,did I do something wrong? My husband & I thought it was kind of bland. Beautiful color though.

Delicious! Beware of adding too much garlic, though...turns spicy on you! Very good with crackers or toasted baguette slices. Also good with shrimp and a good sandwich spread.

Truly wonderful. Use a small garlic clove. A lot goes a long way!

I wasn't sure about how this would turn out, but as I love all of the ingredients I gave it a whirl. My boyfriend and I ate the WHOLE bowl of it with carrots & crackers before dinner! I did add approx. 2tbsp feta to the food processor. MAKE THIS, IT IS ADDICTIVE!!

Fabulous! My seven year-old son loved it; my husband also. Definitely a keeper to make again and again.

Aboslutely perfect for casual entertaining: easy, quick and delicious! My guests raved. I used yummy oil-roasted almonds and the flavor was perfect. This one's a keeper.

Quick, easy, colorful and delicious. We are garlic fans so I added 2 extra cloves of garlic. We ate it with pita chips but veges would be great as well.

Great, but needed more of a zing - a little salt and lime juice did the trick.

Wonderful recipe. It got rave reviews at a recent party we held. Lovely with crisped pita bread pieces.

This was delicious. I used my own roasted peppers which I store in olive oil, so i didn't add the extra olive oil - added a little extra garlic as well. Very easy, pretty and delicious. A great dip.

Great dip! Def. add the extra garlic and be sure to use high quality EV olive oil

This was fantastic with toasted walnuts. I increased garlic, though. Be sure to toast nuts before use; makes a huge difference in flavor.
