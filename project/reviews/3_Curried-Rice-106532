I really enjoyed the flavor of this rice, however the cooking method didn't work for me at all. I quartered the recipe and added a pinch more salt as had been suggested in other reviews, but other than that I followed the directions exactly. Almost half the rice is burnt on the bottom of the pan- I don't know what went wrong. But the rice I was able to salvage tasted delicious. So I would make it again, though not following these cooking directions.

Such an easy and delicious basic recipe - it's easy to spice it up or add more variety.

This was a lovely, quick and simple recipe. Very tasty without being overpowering. I throw in some raisins too once in a while for a little extra flavour.

I also read review before making. Added a little Allspice while cooking rice & then when serving topped with cashews & carmelized onions. That made all the difference!

Before I cooked this recipe, I read the reviews. The reviews were a great resource and I hope my review will be as helpful. The only ingredients I changed were an added teaspoon of Ginseng and One more teaspoon of salt. The rice came out wonderful, though I did cook it about 5 min longer. One last thought, the success of any recipe with curry is the quality. I like to go to a health food store and buy it bulk. It is usually quite reliable. Otherwise you can put three times the amount of curry that the recipe calls for and it still will be blande.

Very simple to make. I added a bit more curry than called for to give more flavor.

I used brown rice instead. A note though, cook a little longer as the rice is al dente. Unless you like that. I also threw in some diced potatoes and tossed some diced tomatoes also when it was served. Perhaps some cauliflower would be good? But I would make this again.

This is an interesting and unusual take on ordinary long grain rice, which gives it a little zip and more texture, making it almost chewy. I made it exactly as written, and although the type of curry wasn't specified, I used Madras. My husband, who usually shuns rice, which he says is boring, gobbled this up.

Better recipe (everything to taste): To the onion add black mustard seed, couple of cloves and cardamom pods, minced garlic and ginger, a couple of curry leaves if you have. When you add the rice, include some tumeric and salt to taste. Stir to coat the rice with the spices and saute just to toast the grains - don't let the rice brown. Add water and cook rice (I do this part in a rice cooker). When the rice is cooked, turn onto a serving platter and sprinkle a nandful of raisins, chopped (unsalted) cashew nuts, caramelized onion. This is my 'company' rice dish, from an aunt. And it is great with any meat or vegetable dish. It is best served immediately and is usually not better the next day.

I'd make the dish again, mainly because it's easy and inexpensive. I think the fact that I used a high-end curry powder (from Penzey's) may have made a difference. This was a good side dish with Grilled Jerk Chicken, Papaya Salsa and Jicama Slaw. Having said that, I wouldn't consider this a "great" dish. But I don't think it was bad, either.

This recipe is a good start, but I added 1T of chopped fresh ginger, doubled the garlic, used brown rice instead of white rice, added 1/4 cup of raisins, and 1/2 t of cayenne pepper. Also, to alleviate the blandness problem, add salt instead of more curry. With these additions I will make it again.

This made for a good veggie meal. I added chick stock and habinaro peppers

This rice was bland, bland, bland. I'll not be making this one again.

what this recipe REALLY needs is two extra ingredients: lemon juice (one lemon worked for me) and coconut milk (about 1 cup). before i added these two items, it was bland and the curry was overpowering. be aware that when you add the coconut milk the rice will no longer be flakey, it will have more of a rissoto consistency

I was really also disappointed with this recipe- it was really bland after even adding MORE curry powder to the already 4 t. I won't be making this again.

I gave this 3 forks...after my own alterations. I added 1/4 cup sweetened shredded coconut along with the onion & garlic, then 1/4 cup golden raisins with the rice. Everyone loved it and it makes great leftovers to take to the office for lunch!

I made this to go along with some nice yogurt marinaded boneless chicken. The chicken was great but the rice was bland and nothing to write home about..i was disappointed....
