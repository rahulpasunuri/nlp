WOW this recipe is GREAT! The only changes I made were the herbs and the seafood: I used dried thyme & basil instead of herbes de Provence, and I used shrimp instead of snapper. The latter substitution also meant using one less pan, as I just tossed the raw shrimp into the sauce during its last three minutes of cooking. I did cook the sauce a little longer than 10 minutes, because I kept waiting for it to thicken, which it never really did. But the consistency was fine once mixed with the pasta. The combination of flavors is exceptional. Will definitely make this again!

My friend made this for dinner the other night. We all thought it was a restaurant-quality meal. I was so happy with it, we all asked for the recipe and I'm making it tonight. I can't wait. Yummy. This is a keeper.

I made the mistake of substituting 18% cream instead of using the full fat 35% cream. My sauce broke immediately and was only saved by quickly adding about 3 tablespoons of sour cream and whisking vigorously. Use whipping cream!

Really super delicous. I followed the recipe exactly for the sauce - each component is integral to the balance. The sauce is so good, you don't even need the fish.

Ok Folks...to all the people who keep saying they don't like Snapper because it is too "fishy" tasting...NO FISH IS SUPPOSED TO TASTE FISHY! It all has to do with "freshness". Minutes after a fish expires,it releases chemicals which give the strong "fishy" rancid odor...getting stronger the longer it is improperly handled. I catch Black (Mangrove)and Red Snapper all the time and it is sweet, odorless and wonderful! That is because it is gutted immediately or put on ice instantly, or kept alive until I get home to clean it. Ok...now the recipe. It wasn't very good. It is too citric and not creamy enough. I squeezed fresh limes and oranges for juice and used a good white wine. Mine smelled and tasted a bit like citric vomit. It was edible, but nothing I would make again. The fish was incredible, but the sauce took away from it. The pasta was fair until I drizzled the last half of the sauce over it after laying the fish atop. My kids said it smelled good, but they took several bites and said it smelled better than it tastes. It was too citric to them. Maybe I used too much lime and orange zest...but this isnt a recipe I would come back to.

I used a little extra orange peal. It was incredible. Bragged on this recipie to everyone who would listen and then some!!

This dish was phenomenal and great for the whole family. My boys (ages 2, 5 and 7) loved it. I was out of a few ingredients, but found that green onions could stand in for the shallots and soy sauce worked in a pinch for the Worcestershire sauce. My only regret is that I didn't double the sauce since it tasted so good on the extra noodles. We will be making this again.

This was simple and fabulous. I used macadamia nut oil instead of olive oil.

I made this with cod and it was pretty good. To be fair, I think it would have been much better if I had used cream (I used 1.5 cups whole milk and let it reduce longer). Next time I'll try it with the cream. Also, I can't buy clam juice here so I put about 1/2 pound of fresh clams with 1 cup fish stock in instead. The clams in the sauce was really good!

For an extra kick-down (for those who can handle the fire in the kitchen) after softening the shallots and garlic, substitute 1/2 c wine with 1/2 c. tequila, flambe then continue building with all other ingredients, saving the cream for last.

I would make this for an adult crowd but not for children; the flavors are too sophisticated. I substituted shrimp for snapper one evening and it still came out great. I'll make this for me and my DH though.

Grilled the snapper (locally caught), and used less orange juice and more white wine. Something was still missing, though, and an inebriated guest at the table suggested parmesan cheese, which, suprisingly, turned out to be the missing link. Would make the dish again because it is fast (if you have all of the ingredients on hand), but it is not the blow-your-mind dish you serve when trying to impress. Still a great twist on fish, so thanks!

Incredible. And easy. Great recipe. Will make again and again! Based on other's comments, I changed the proportion of wine & juice to reduce the sweetness. I used 3/4 C white wine & 1/4 C orange juice - and increased the lime juice to ~3 tablespoons. Next time, I also would eliminate the all the orange/lime peel -- didn't really need that in the texture & the extra lime juice will compensate. I liked the sauce a little soupier (instead of thicker). I agree with the last reviewer that it's better like that with angle hair pasta! Finally, we grilled the snapper (brushed with olive oil only) instead of pan frying - we found pink snapper fresh flown in from Hawaii (pure coincidence), called opakapaka. It was absolutely incredible - texture is much meatier than red snapper. Awesome!

I was cooking for 3, so I took the advice of others and doubled the sauce. completely unnecesary. this sauce is not supposed to be soupy, but only a creamy delicate seasoning. In fact, I found myself letting much of it drip off the pasta, although it was very good. My advice, make as is. I used talapia instead of red snapper.I also added a few extra tomatoes. Next time I will use whole wheat pasta. I also roasted brocolli florets and served as a one-dish meal, placing fish on top of pasta. Beautiful.

What can I say but amazing. The flavours where just perfect together, and I just loved it over the pasta. Added the suggested amount of dried herbs as I did not have any herbs de provence on hand (which can be purchased at William &Sonoma)A tip that works out great for me is if I am ever using citrus for any reason I always zest it and keep it in the freezer it really keeps quite well indefinately. I also have frozen any extra juice. Because I am not a big fan of thickening w?flour or corn starch, I reduced the clam juice to 1/2 the amount, and it thickenened very nicely. Then I actually reduced the thickness with the remainder of the clam juice. I had made the sauce about 45min. before the fish. Try this recipe you will not be dissappointed. Goes together very easily and turns out very impressive. Enjoy!

We tried this recipe last night and had great results. I was short on orange peel and fresh basil but ptherwise followed the recipe exactly. The sauce was definitely not too thin so there was no need to add cornstarch. The issue really is that the angel hair pasta soaks up the sauce. Besides, angel hair doesn't work all that well with a heavy sauce. The beauty of this recipe is that its light. I wouldn't worry about thickening it:-)

Very elegant and easy! Was a snap to prepare - I used tilapia and also added some flour at the end to thicken the sauce, which really was only enough for 2 people. I will definitely make this again!

I downloaded this recipe in June 2002, but I never made it until last night. WOW!!! What took me so long??? I have 8 orange trees, so right now, I have hundreds of oranges ready for picking and I usually make a lot of recipes using orange juice. This one was absolutely fabulous! I didn't change a thing except for using fresh cod,and my husband raved about it. It was really easy even though it looked like it would take forever because there are so many ingredients for the sauce. Don't wait as long as I did to make it.

This got rave reviews from my husband. The only thing I changed was to follow the recommendation of another review to add corn starch to thicken the sauce & I used skinless snapper and sea scallops. It was wonderful!

Rating: 4
Made this for a dinner party this past weekend, and we all loved it! The citrus cream sauce is exquisite, and can easily be made in advance allowing for last minute preparations. When cooking the red snapper, it tended to curl up when cooked on the skin side. Next time I'll cook on flesh side only, or perhaps try jumbo prawns or scallops. Yummy Yummy Yummy!!!

Rating: 4
Not sure what the other reviewers did. I thought the prep work was simple and results were divine. The sauce is delicate yet complex and heavenly with the fish. I substituted grouper for snapper. Like several other reviewers, I used all the sauce for two people and would double for more quests. In addition, I like a slightly thicker sauce than this reduction, so I added a teaspoon of cornstarch and simmered for a minute while I was preparing to serve. Fantastic!

I made this exactly but substituted scallops for the snapper. It was easy but didn't work well for entertaining as there was too much last minute work to the recipe. I won't make this again as I have other comparable recipes that are far better.

This is one of the best new recipe I've tried in a while. Easy and delicious. The sauce can be made ahead too.

I make this sauce often for lots of different fresh white, mild fish (talapia, flounder, or cod as we aren't near an ocean and must depend on what's shipped in) with pasta on the side. It makes a difference if you use sun-dried tomatoes in oil or reconstitute them in boiling water--the oil tomatoes seem to have more flavor. Guests enjoy it. A sous chef would be nice--lots of chopping and measuring in advance!

Rating: 4
Great! I couldn't find clam juice and used chicken broth instead. I was nervous about making it since my husband can be picky. He usually prefers fish very plain. But he loved this dish. Definitely make more sauce if for more than two people. Easy for an elegant dish.

This was decent, but try the pasta with lobster, wild mushrooms, and cream on this website. It is a recipe along the same vein but much better!

I was so disappointed by this dish. It involved a fair amount of work and the flavor was very bland. It needed salt, more citrus flavor and I thought the sauce was a little too thin. If I made it again I would try chicken broth instead of clam juice, chicken instead of fish and more citrus peel.

With the exception of salmon filets or tuna, I am not much of a fish eater. However, the list of ingredients in this receipt intrigued me so I decided to try it. It also gave me the opportunity to try the herbes de Provence which I had purchased while in Provence but have never had the occasion to use. I have prepared and served this dish on four occasions and after each dinner, at least one guest has requested the receipt. I would classify the receipt as a winner! Simple to prepare and wonderful in flavour. I also sprinkle some minced corriander over the pasta/fish just prior to serving for colour and flavour.

Rating: 2
This was good but I was not as impressed as the others. Maybe I'm just not a red snapper lover. I was dissapointed that the skin didn't release from the flesh easily (like salmon skin). It was a little hard to get the fish off the skin without squishing the pile of pasta it was laying on. Maybe it would have made more sense to place it alongside the pasta.

Rating: 3
Read most of the reviews and decided to add more lime juice and tomato, used linguine instead of angel hair (our preference) and served pasta along side of snapper not under. Why is everything served on top of something else lately?

A lovely sauce that is rich and a nice complex of flavors that is strong enough for the pasta but does not overwhelm the fish. My guests loved it as did I.

This was outstanding! I was lucky enough to receive a gift of one large filet of red snapper from friends who fish. I followed the recipe exactly and it was one of the best dishes I have ever prepared......and I cook a lot!! I thought the preparation was simple and well worth the time. The sauce was devine! You won't be disappointed. My husband also LOVED IT! This one is going into my Epicurious recipe box.

This was great, very elegant and easier to prepare than it looks. I couldn't find clam juice so I used chicken broth and the sauce was great. I would chop the shallots more finely than slicing them, and I wouldn't reduce the sauce as much to leave more of a creamy-ness to it.

This recipe was wonderful. I tried it out for a small dinner party and everyone loved it! It was so easy to throw together as well.

My husband absolutely loved this dish! If you stick to the recipe measurements, etc. it turns out beautifully and makes a wonderful presentation. We enjoyed it so much we are serving it to company. It is simple and delicious. And I do agree about making more sauce if for more than two people.

Nothing left on the plates of our 12 guests at last week's High Sierra regatta party! Substituted grilled salmon and halibut. A colored pasta (maybe sundried tomato) would have enhanced the presentation with the halibut. Also had red pepper flakes available at the table which made for a pleasant sweet/hot flavoring. Next time I will just add pepper flakes or cayenne to the sauce.

Bleecchhh!!! In a word: yuck. Made the recipe for my boyfriend last night and we could barely eat it. It was like a worcester/clam juice nightmare. If I made this again I would eliminate those two ingredients completely and maybe switch to chicken. All in all it was dissapointing, especially after the rave reviews.

I loved it. The citrus and the sun-dried tomato paired nicely with the cream sauce. (Ok, I admit it, I put in extra sun-dried tomatoes!) My husband and I ate all of the sauce for just the too of us. As another reviewer commented, I would recommended increasing the amount of sauce if you are making for more than 2 people.

This was just great! Not big snapper fans, we broiled grouper 3" from the heat for seven minutes, which made for a nice moist fish. Served it over angel hair pasta with a side of asparagus with wasabi sauce, which made for a nice sweet-spicy combination. also served the fennel and apple salad with a touch more apple juice in the vinaigrette for more flavor. All in all, a great meal!

This was an extraordinary meal! My husband and I couldn't stop raving with each bite we took. I made it exactly as the recipe suggested. The reducing seems to be key, as the flavours developed with each passing moment. I made all the sauce for just the two of us, so I'd adjust for more people. Simply delicious!!

I made this for dinner last night and it was absolutely amazing. I had a little trouble finding clam juice, so I substituted fish stock instead. The slightly creamy texture with the citrus flavor was great over the angel hair. I would actually give this 3 1/2 stars, but that option is not available!

This tasted even better than it sounded! Don't like snapper; substituted halibut. Used all fresh herbs from husband's new garden, and when we serve this to company we will "kick it up" by fast frying some fennel to a crisp and scatter the fennel over the top for looks. Awesome.

I was dying to try this, unfortunately by the time I could make it to the store, they were out of red snapper, and so I got flounder. The flavor of the tomatoes and citrus were absolutely divine with the fish, but did nothing for the pasta. I also wonder whether the clam juice, wine and cream are necessary, finally, it demanded salt and pepper! Will make again, but pasta on the side please.

Rating: 4
I thought this was great. I had fresh scallops and was looking for something different to do and found this recipe. I made it exactly as written except dusted he scallops with flour and pan fried them instead of the fish. I will definitely make this again with fish or scallops; the only change I will make is to decrase, or omit the citrus peel.

This was excellent! I "padded" the tablespoons of sun dried tomatoes & had to make some compensations for the juices & zests--not enough fresh orange juice & the rind on my lime was not good. I liked the flavor of the sauce better after it had sat a few hours. I also doubled the sauce & then reduced it by 1/2, making for a real intense flavor that was just so good! Such an easy company dish. And so elegant. We loved it! I bet lemon would be just as good with the orange!

Fantastic dish!! The combination of ingredients, makes a wonderfully complex sauce, although I did add extra sun-dried tomatoes and additional lime juice to enhance the tartness. It takes only a few minutes to make. Its a good to make when you have last minute guests over for dinner. They will be impressed. I just can't see how anyone can ruin this dish.

Off-topic, but I cannot figure out where else to ask for help on this. I typically check out new recipes by entering the month and year in the search box (ex June 2002). This has worked for over a year for me, and now all of the sudden it didn't work with May or June recipes. I've submitted to feedback and to help on this site twice with no response. Can someone suggest an alternate way to pull up recipes posted within the last 30 or 60 days? Thanks in advance.

This was a "top-notch" recipe. My husband decided this was quality company fare and gave it "4 forks"! It was pretty easy, so I plan to prepare the sauce ahead and take on our next sailing cruise. Will our sailing buddies be impressed! The only thing I changed was using grouper vs. snapper.

OK but could be better. The sauce was great until you put it on pasta - then it went bland. Next time I will add twice amt. of tomatoes and also make 11/2 amt. of sauce - there wasn't quite enough.

Wow, this was a great recipe. My husband (who is the pickiest eater in the world and not much of a fish lover) loved it. I've made it twice already. I used Talapia instead of Snapper, it's a very mild fish with a good texture. It's so good to find a "restaurant" quality recipe that is simple and cooks up in 30 minutes. Add a glass of Coppala's chardonnay and you'll swear your eating in one of San Fransisco finest restaurants.

Awsome, just awsome. I made the dish with ocean perch (a nice, mild fish) and used 18% cream, which curdled at first, but then came back together as the sauce reduced.

Wow, this dish is so delicious my husband and I felt like we were eating out!

Delicioso! I normally don't love snapper, but this was wonderful. I will make it again, and even try the sauce with prawns or chicken. Very versatile, and it tastes complex even though it was easy to make. Definitely use fresh pasta, I don't think it would be as good without it.

Maybe we're just not lovers of "fishy" flavors (although I can't eat enough tuna and salmon, especially in sushi, mmmmmmmmmmm!) but we did not enjoy this recipe. The sauce on the pasta was really velvety and tasty. I think this would be a great recipe with chicken and I will definitely make it again with chicken, just not with snapper
