I loved this dressing! It was easy to make and tasted light - perfect for spinach salad. I cut the recipe in half and still had enough to fill a dressing carafe - it makes a lot! This recipe was also perfect for using up some strawberries I had left over that were wilting a bit - probably not great for eating straight - but still great when pureed.

I made this for the strawberry salad recipe on the epicurious site, and it's delicious. I served the salad twice in a weekend, to 2 differnt groups. When I went to dress the salad for the second group, I accidentally used the vinegar rather than the dressing I had made. Nobody noticed, including me!

I just picked strawberries at the local pick your own farm. I made this recipe as written. I decided to strain the vinegar again, using cheesecloth in the strainer. It took out so much more seeds and pieces of pulp. The end result is an almost clear vinegar that is absolutely delicious.
