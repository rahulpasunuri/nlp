The concept sounds good but the sauce reduced quite a bit but didn't really get into the scallops much. It smelled way better than it tasted. I can't imagine adding balsamic vinegar to it though. I may try it again but I wouldn't serve it to anyone else until I have the kinks worked out.

Very disappointing. Bland even with the balsamic vinegar. The sauce was so gelatinous -- I added more cider, but it was still ickily slimy. The best scallop recipe is Seared Peppered Scallops with Orange-soy Glaze on the site. Try it; you will not be disappointed. Take my word, forget this recipe. ICK!

This was a great, easy meal with an interesting taste combo. There was too much sauce though - next time I was make this much sauce with 1.5-2 lbs of scallops.

After reading some of the other reviews, I wanted to add more. I used flour to the amount listed and the sauce was perfect. Add the lemon juice, and do everything in exact amounts; it could easily be tempermental. I think the apple juice also really helped with the flavor; it really was perfect, I would not change it at all. I kind of feel like the balsamic vinegar would be awful, but I have not tried it.

This is really good; it has a nice sweet flavor and is easy to make. I had to use apple juice instead of Cider, but it turned out great. Very Fallish!

P.S. One addition that i think is critical. Try to reduce the cider-- boil down two or three cups to one and use that in this recipie. Concentrating the cider plus the balsamic vinegar makes this recipe really kick. :)

Doubled the sauce. Substituted balsamic vinegar for the lemon as one review suggested. Terrific, tasty, easy meal.

My attempt at this dish must fall into the "too heavy on the cornstarch" category because I, too, ended up with an odd slimy sauce. I added more cider, but it must not have been enough. It was a little bland, too. If I try it again, I will use flour or less cornstarch and more cider or something.

We originally found the recipe lacked flavor so we enhanced it with balsamic vinegar. It took the blandness away and made it stellar. I would skip the lemon juice next time and just use the vinegar.

I preferred this as a salad served on wilted spinach. I prepared the scallops as directed; wilted the spinach; arranged a small serving of spinach on a plated with 2-3 scallops; sprinkled with the crumbled bacon; then, used the cider-sauce as a dressing (less is more).

Simple and impressive. Be very careful not to overcook the scallops. Four large scallops were enough for a main course.

This recipe was a disappointment. The cider flavor was too strong and boring and my husband and babysitter were both silent as they picked at their scallops. The leftovers got tossed.

Just by luck I had some wonderful fresh cider. Sounds like a weird combo-but it works. Use arrowroot for a sauce so it wont be as thick. I also had some bacon crumbled on top--yum yum.

The sauce was much too thick and tasted very bad. We tried to rescue it with white wine and mustard but there was no hope. Keep looking for a different recipe!

Perhaps I was heavy on the cornstarch, but the sauce had a thick, slimy, texture to it. While it tasted fine, I couldn't get over the sight of it enough to really enjoy it.

Tasty, fast and unusual. When I make it again, I will substitute flour for cornstarch - my sauce was a little thick. Otherwise, I was very pleased.

My husband LOVES scallops, but I'm not so crazy about them - until now! This recipe makes even a nonlover of the shellfish come back for seconds. The bacon gave this dish just the right flavor...next time I'll add more!

I loved your recipe but added some of Emeril's "essence" to the scallops before cooking and just before serving. I also used twice as much bacon and additional cider.

Very tasty, very easy. The sauce is smooth and rich. It was a big hit at our dinner. Consider using a bit of mustard in the sauce for little more bite.
