I used grouper instead of sea bass. The glaze was delicious, but don't waste your time with the cream sauce.

This is my go to recipe, if I really want to impress. It is delicious. Works every time. Goes well with Tom Kai Gai, if u can pull that off they will think your a kitchen goddess. Lol And I actually use my own variation of the ginger butter sauce to make pasta....and it's sooo good! Just add lemon!

This recipe was also in the BA 9/1998 issue and named: Sea Bass with honey-soy glaze and ginger butter sauce. It was absolutely fantastic! They sauce is fabulous but the honey soy glaze puts it over the top. Unfortunately, that recipe is not on the website.

FANTASTIC recipe for a firm white fish. I agree with some other reviewers that the individual sauces, on their own, don't seem all that impressive - but when you put them together on that fish, WOW! It's synergy squared. I couldn't find sea bass (so hard to get these days), and settled on mahi mahi. This might seem like an odd choice, but the flavors of the two sauces are so potent that I think this firmer, more strongly-flavored fish stood up fine. I'm sure it's even better with the more tender sea bass, though, and I look forward to trying it. Here's my tips: Make the sauces a day ahead (without the butter in the white sauce). This makes preparation and plating SO much easier. Plus, letting the white sauce sit in the fridge overnight with the shallots and ginger in it, allows it to steep and gain even more intensity of flavor. Be sure to reduce this sauce as described in the recipe - if you don't cook it for long enough, it will be too thin and watery, and you want it to have some thickness to it. I personally don't think you need quite as much butter - you can probably get by with only half, and it'll be fine. Be sure to strain the sauce before you serve - and DO plate it as described, with the white sauce on the plate, and the fish on top, topped with the extra glaze. It looks so impressive that way! I served it with stir-fried baby bok choy and steamed rice, and the white sauce added a nice flavor to the rice as well.

Made this tonight to rave reviews from all - including my 18 month old! Took the "bland" reviews of the sauce to heart and doubled the ginger and shallots and it made for a fantastic base for th fish. My local market was out of Chilean Sea Bass when I arrived so I opted for the just-arrived, never- frozen Monk Fish. It turned out great and am not sure I'd make the switch back to the bass. The more firm texture and richer flavor stood up very well to the glaze/sauce combo. I paired the fish with a nice Alsace Pinot Blanc and served with a side of broccolini and white asparagus.

delicious, but I wouldn't make it again because I wasn't quite sure what the sauce was for. the flavours were too mild. the glaze was delicious, however, and sea bass is always good.

Rating: 4
I've made this dish several times, and my family fights over whose portion is bigger...the sauces are so simple my 11-year old son was able to make both of them. I haven't ever substituted another type of fish because the sea bass is so delicious. I always use low-sodium soy anyway, so I didn't notice too much sodium in the finished product like some other reviewers. If you're sensitive to that (my whole family is), use the lower-sodium product and I think it won't be an issue.

All the reviews here must be from novice cooks. Nothing special at all. The ginger sauce was a waste of time and sounds better than the fianl result. Keep expectations low in this sauce.

By far my favorite dinner party dish - friends call and want to know when I'm serving it again. Make the two sauces the day before and it's easy. I've also used halibut when no sea bass.

bit too salty, but otherwise quite good. needed a crisper wine than i had, alsomst had to tie myself up to keep from adding some citrus somewhere might try with lemon grass in the sauce with the ginger and shallot

Of the 6 of us, half loved it half thought it just "ok". I thought the sauces were just soso, not as WOW as I had expected after reading the reviews. Usually every recipe I get off of this site is a WOW but I didn't think so this time. Although my husband really enjoyed it as did my mom and brother-in-law, they all said it was very good, but no excellents in there. It's NOT bad, just didn't WOW me as I had hoped.

Rating: 4
Outstanding and relatively easy to make. The glaze and sauce are excellent together. Even got my husband (who usually hates fish!) to enjoy a fish entree. I served this w/ roasted asparagus and a tangerine dressing (also from this site), which was also great! Couldn't find sea bass, so I used fresh haddock which was also great.

Second time I made this recipe I incorporated caramelized sweet onions (you can use Mexican, Brazilian or Vidalia) and Oyster mushrooms. The result was fantastic!!!

I didnt have a whole lot of experience cooking when I made this, but I decided to surprise my parents with dinner one day. This meal was a total hit! It was easy to make and I couldnt believe how delicious it turned out. I made it again for my boyfriend at the time and he could not stop complimenting me on the meal. Since then, this dish has officially become the meal I cook if I am trying to impress someone. Its fabulous.

Rating: 4
Absolutely lovely. The only problem is that its a bit time consuming to make the two sauces. They're both extremely easy to make, but the time it takes and the dishes that end up dirty at the end kind of make this a special occasions only type of meal. But it really was fantastic.

I made this recipe exactly as printed, and this is the first recipe off this site that I have not been fully satisfied with. I thought I was a lone dissenter until I read another 1fork review from St. Louis. I agree exactly.

This was very good, and I will try it again on Sea Bass (I used Tilapia this time around). I didn't have butter so I used olive oil instead(just a touch) for the sauce, and I'm pretty sure I put 7 tablespoons of soy sauce in the glaze rather than 6, and my husband still raved. It's a unique dish...very interesting flavor pairing.

Rating: 4
A Sensational Dish. Used Tilapa instead of Bass. Deep Fried Julienned Leeks and spread them on top of the dish which made it even more spectacular. Like a lot of reviewers we were skeptical but the compliment of the glaze and sauce are remarkable.

This dish was pretty good, and could have been outstanding had I made more glaze and more sauce than stated by the recipe- this way each guest can adjust according to her own taste. Presentation of fish on top of sauce was fabulous- I could easily see this served at Ocean Grill in New York. Two thumbs up!

Where's the fifth fork on this darn thing? I made this for a weeknight dinner, but it will definitely be the fish course at my next dinner party. I made this per the recipe except I only added 1T of butter to finish the sauce.

Used half-n-half b/c no whipin' cream on hand. Used only 2 TBS of butter and it tasted fine (mind you, I am not one to hold back on using good butter), so I reco. trying the sauce before adding all the butter. I glazed the fish before baking as directed, but did not top the fish with the glaze afterwards (thought it might overpower the sea bass. Served with white rice tossed with asparagus tips and enoki mushrooms. Excellent recipe, thank you.

I didn't have Sea Bass, so I used chicken breasts instead. I pounded them with a mallet to just under 1/2" and baked them at the same temp for the same amount of time. The Ginger butter sauce is so good, I couldn't help just "sipping" it plain from a spoon! I'm surprised that some folks thought this was such a terrible recipe. To each their own! We liked it so much, it was served two nights in a row. I didn't have to add any additional seasonings. You do have to be careful not to use too much glaze because it can easily overpower the butter sauce. I also brushed a baking sheet with a scant amount of sesame oil so the breasts wouldn't totally stick, and that added another touch to the already terrific flavors! I also like this recipe because it's easy to prepare and done in a flash!

If I could I would rate this a BIG FAT ZERO! (I normally find the recipes on the site very good--thus my extreme disappointment) A terrible waste of a good piece of fish!! This dish was horrible. The glaze was overpowered by the soy sauce - almost to the point of tasting bitter. The ginger sauce was bland. My guests tried it --but none including myself finished the fish. It's a good thing we had extra shrimp and lobster in the fridge.

Rating: 3
One word: YUM! The only thing I;d change next time, and I'll definately make this again, is to thicken up the ginger sauce. It came out a little too watery, though it still tasted great. I made enough to have leftovers, but it was so good, we ate it all the first night!

Rating: 4
Inspired. The sauces worked wonderfully together, though separately they were mediocre. I sauteed shitake mushrooms in olive oil and toasted sesame oil, which I then tossed in the additional glaze and served on top of the fish. The sesame oil and the texture of the mushrooms were a wonderful complement to the fish and sauces. I served this dish with plain basmati rice and snap peas. The fragant rice was complementary without overpowering the flavors and the snap peas provided color and crunch!

Rating: 4
Very easy and absolutely wonderful. The basting sauce is a beautiful color and the cream sauce is actually very light. Company loved it and if the sauces are done ahead of time it's a dish that takes very little time. The sea bass did take 25 minutes (so allow for extra time).

I like less firm fish, so I tried this recipe using orange roughy. It turned out great. Also, steamed carrots cut in squares were a coroful and tasty addition in the butter sauce.

I found this was a relatively simple recipe for a meal that looked and tasted so gourmet. My dinner guests were stunned. '"This is the best homemade seafood meal I've ever tasted." The flavors of the glaze, the sea bass, and the cream complemented each other nicely. I served it with a baby spinach salad with an olive oil/rice vinegar dressing. Sounds very lite, but we all skipped dessert.

My husband said this was the best seafood dish he had ever tasted. I baked the fish for appx. 25 minutes and it was incredibly moist. I also used the pairing and presentation tips from the reviewer from Los Angeles - cracked peppercorns around the edge of the plate was an inspiration!

This is an incredible dish!!!! Absolutely fabulous!!! I have made it a number of times, both for family and for very special dates that I want to impress. There is something wonderful about the combination of the soy glaze and the ginger sauce. I make extra sauce with a lot of ginger. I use very thick sea bass and am careful not to over cook. Have also grilled the sea bass with the glaze and that was perhaps the best. Still searching for the perfect sides -- have served with garlic mashed (in my opinion not the best) and orzo with green onions (this web site). Green beans, roasted asparagas or snow peas are all nice. Will never use another sea bass recipe!!

Rating: 3
Everyone thought this was great. The strange thing was, when I tasted the glaze and sauce on their own as I was making them, I didn't think either was particularly good, yet somehow when it was all put together, the finished dish was actually pretty good. Would I make it again? Well, not until I try a good many other sea bass recipes. Even though everyone at the table thought it was great, I'm sure you could do better.

This is outstanding! I didn't change a thing (other than the cooking time...about 23 minute). This recipe is simple, yet so elegant. The glaze gives the fish a beautiful color, and the sauce compliments the fish without overpowering it. It is truly a great recipe. I served it with sauteed spinach (which goes beautifully with the ginger butter sauce).

This recipe was phenomenal. The presentation on the plate was beautiful, and all four of us absolutely loved it. Two variations, though: 1) The sauce turned out thinner than we wanted, so we added a half teaspoon of corn starch and thickened it up; 2) The fish was VERY thick, so I cooked it about 28 minutes, then turned off the oven and let it cook another 3-4 minutes.

I've never given 4 forks before in my ratings--the guide says "a dish beyond compare," and I've made some excellent dishes with Epicurious recipes, but none that I thought were "beyond compare." This is the first. Just exquisite. I can't wait to make it for a dinner party and impress my foodie friends. Would like to hear from others about what side dishes they served with this.

Rating: 4
This is an absolutely fantastic recipe. The sauce was divine and you really only need a little bit of it. The only thing I did differently was to cook the sea bass about 23 minutes instead of 15 - I guess I bought thick pieces. Next time I would strain the sauce right away as it thickened up and I had to add extra whipping cream. Still, a definite 4-forker and I will most certainly make this again.

If you only have one recipe for sea bass, this would be it!!!!! I have made this dish well over 10 times. It's my mother's favorite dish and she makes me prepare it for her every time I visit. An interesting presentation, I used purple peruvian mashed potatoes and a baby vegetable melange to finish off the dish, absolutely divine!!

A wonderful way to prepare one of the tastiest and most versatile types of fish. Knowing the recipe was from the Deer Valley cafeteria was promising. This place puts other ski area cafeterias to shame. The recipe is simply subline! Thanks for hints from previous reviewers. A couple of adaptations: (1) used sugar instead of honey in the glaze, due to taste preference (2) After reducing the shallot/ginger sauce, strain it through metal strainer before cooling it (3) Reduced butter to 2 tbsp. Used unsalted butter. My husband loved the dish as well. I served it with corn custard (recipe from the "Gotham Bar and Grill Cookbook" from NYC restaurant - great restaurant and cookbook) and steamed peapods.

This recipe is fabulous! My husband came home from a fishing trip with a fresh largemouth bass. I halved the recipe and used two fillets. Easy and elegant!

I am the sister of a chef, so whenever I make something I feel extra scrutiny. It was WONDERFUL. I felt the sauces melded great together because they were on opposite sides of the spectrum, one sweet and one savory. The only modification I made was longer reduction time on the Ginger butter sauce and a little rice wine vinegar to take the edge away, I think my wine was a little old. But my guests found it restaurant quality, good luck and enjoy!

This was marvelous, especially the glaze. I did, however, puree the cream sauce in a blender and reheat it before serving; as the shallots and ginger made the sauce a little lumpy. Everyone loved it. I used Chillean Sea Bass which cooked perfectly in the oven just as directed.

This dish was absolutely fantastic. One of the best I have tried off this website so far. And it was easy too. Believe it or not, I didn't use sea bass (they were out of it at the store) so I tried orange roughy and it was fabulous. Also, I was lazy and used bottled grated ginger instead of sliced. This will be made many more times in our household. Great for company too.

The glaze produced a lovely moist fish and the ability to prepare both glaze and sauce ahead was good. I used striped bass (rockfish) fillets. I also passed the sauce through a sieve after reducing and before adding the cream.

This is a wonderful dish. The fish is glazed and quite moist. The ginger sauce is delicate if made just before serving and robustly gingery if made ahead.The sauces complement each other nicely. One of our favorites!
