Great sandwich! Delicious and a beautiful presentation. The chives are wonderful sprinkled on top. I served this with lentil soup and it was a great combination.

I really liked this. The apple butter is what makes all the difference. This was also good on some home-made Parmesan biscuits.

I've been making this since it was published & it's become one of the things my husband & I look forward to every fall. We just had it for dinner tonight with the onion cider soup that's part of the suggested meal. The only thing we usually change is to use two slices of bread because we prefer a closed sandwich. A few times we've made it with rosemary ham & that adds a nice extra dimension of flavor too.

I have served these sandwiches for special lunches quite a few times and always got rave reviews from my guests. Yesterday I tried a different bread: Rather than ciabatta rolls which tend to be rather thick, I used foccacia (from Acme Bakery in Berkeley CA). Sliced to half thickness, the ratio of bread to toppings was just right and it was a lot easier to eat. I think that the thinner the ham, the better, even if the edges of the ham get a little scorched under the broiler. I pre-warmed the meat under the broiler before putting on the cheese; this helps melt the cheese more quickly without burning it. I recommend using the sharpest, oldest cheddar you can afford to buy; you really need that tanginess. Generous amounts of shaved Kirkland brand ham (Costco) worked just as well as high priced, Black Forest ham from the deli. Finally: don't try to eat this with your fingers; a fork and sharp steak knife is the best way to go if you want to keep your fingers from getting greasy. :o)

Wonderful way to change up your regular ham sandwich. The flavors are wonderful. I make this sandwich a lot. It's easy to make one sandwich or 20.

This is a super quick and very yummy recipe for a quick meal. It would also make a great appetizer if made on smaller toasted breads slices or rolls because it looks so pretty coming out of the oven. I had success substituting whole wheat flat bread for the ciabatta and it turned out nice and toasty.

Some very strong flavours going on here, and all of them create one harmonious sandwich! Just about any firm-textured bread works well (including focaccia - and the onion bun was a fabulous idea!), but whatever you do, don't forget the final sprinkling of chives. It really seals the deal by adding a bit of texture. Use finely chopped green onions if you don't have chives. I've also tried these delightful fall-flavoured sandwiches with a layer of baby arugula or baby spinach, and a light touch of thinly sliced red onion over the apple butter, to help give even more crunchy texture. Great, easy-to-make full-flavoured sandwich!

I wasn't sure about apple butter and mustard but it was really good! I'd make it again.

I thought this was really yummy, using the recipe as- is, except using vegan "ham." The apple-butter made it for me.

I didn't think this recipe was anything unusal or special. I used mild vs. extra sharp cheddar and I'm sure the sharper cheese would add more flavor but it's still just a sandwich. Now I have a $4 bottle of apple butter.

This was great! I loved the hint of apple butter flavor.

Like the cook from Suwanee, GA, I used Boar's Head products. They and this recipe are tops. No changes needed.

I've made this recipe a few times & get great compliments on it. For variation, I'll also make some with turkey and swiss. Equally delicious!

Wonderful combination of flavors - great with the soup!

Love this recipe! Quick and easy to make and guests gobble it up. Really don't need the olive oil or to pre-toast the bun before putting on the cheese and grilling it.

Loved this. I had a hard time locating the apple butter, so instead slice granny apples paper thin.

This is a delicious sandwich. My suggestion is to slice the ham a bit thick. Under the broiler, the edges of my thin slices curled straight up.

We are hooked. This sandwich is so easy to make and so delicious. The apple butter makes this sandwich. I forgot the mustard the first time I made this and have since then skipped it. We use onion rolls instead and the sandwich is always perfect. My husband and I absolutely love this sandwich and have it for lunch twice a week.

This was so delicious! Simple flavors, easy to make and an impressive presentation. I will definitely make this one again.

The moment I saw the picture of this sandwich on pg.80 of the Oct.04 issue, I knew I had to try it.Happy to say that it was wonderful and I serve it often ...just as the recipe says, with no changes at all, it's great. In fact, we had it this evening, along with a nice Caesar Salad and we always use the Boars Head Black Forest Ham & White Cheddar. The Caesar Salad w/ Homemade Croutons pg.141 in June 05 issue is absolutely the best ever too! God Bless...enjoy!

This is my favorite lunch or appetizer to prepare right now. I use cheese ciabatta from the bakery. Slice it then cut in halves. Coat with olive oil(optional). Broil till toasted. Add no sugar apple butter. More fresh and tasty then the regular sugar apple butter. 1 Tbls. on each quarter. 1/4 tsp. roasted garlic mustard. Honey maple ham thinly sliced and 1 and half slices on each. If you use any other ham drizzle with honey. I use any good white chedder. Sharp or not. Just a slice. After broiling and topped with chives. SENSATIONAL!

Don't pass on this one. Simple, interesting, and tasty. We were generous with the ham - bunched the slices into "florets." Attractive presentation; some ended up eating with a fork.

I rate this as four forks because I can't get over how something so simple is so good. I put recipes I like on notecards for easy reference. This is my only sandwich "recipe" card! I just don't want to forget the super apple butter mustard combo....

I used pumpkin butter vs. apple because I had it on hand. We still enjoyed it. I served it open faced, but probably won't in the future, but I will make it again!

I didn't crisp the bread first- just put everything on and broiled it. LOVED the taste of apple butter and mustard!!!

I'm not a sandwich fan AT ALL, but I LOVED this recipe. And my husband thought it was awesome. I made them exactly as written, wouldn't change a thing and will make them again and again.

its a gourmet sandwich creation that's fast and easy. the combination of apple butter and good quality mustard tasted almost like a barbecue sauce...but in a good way!

This sandwich is amazing. It only takes about 5 minutes to make, and has such a complex blend of flavors. The apple butter is so sweet, which offsets the sharp cheddar and the chives. I did not use mustard, which could completely change the mix, but this sandwich can be the perfect thing when I want a hearty and interesting meal in minutes. It tastes excellent with apple cider as well.

TO ADD A TWIST, THE SECOND TIME I MADE THIS , I SUBBED SWEET ONION MARMALADE STUDDED WITH A BRUNOISE OF RAW GOLDEN DELISIOUS APPLES FOR ADDED TEXTURE, IT WORKED VERY WELL.

Instead of the Black Forest Ham I used Roasted Turkey and it came out delicious. It was quick and easy. The apple butter was a nice touch to something that might have been just an ordinary sandwich. I will definitely add this to my recipe collection and make again alot.
