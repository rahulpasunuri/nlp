A nice spicey chutney. I even added a pod of black cardamom to spice it up even more. Quince are quite easy to core if one uses a melon ball tool. I learned this truc from Fran Gage's book "Bread and Chocolate". It is a real time saver. A ceramic knife is also useful for the cutting up of quince.

I made this to "put up". I might have cooked it longer than necessary since the quince cooked down much more than shown in the picture. The flavor is complex. I'm looking forward to serving it at Thanksgiving.

WOW! ok, so I have never made chutney and I have never cooked quince but I love food! and this is fabulous! I served it last night with roast chicken for 8 people and all enjoyed...tangy, spicy, hot with a great depth and complexity.
