I used beef fat from a roast instead of duck fat, delicious

not bad. Used creasy greens (aka upland cress and a bunch of other names) in place of watercress. Also used olive oil instead of butter, since i don't really like the taste of butter with vegetables.

Used baby arugula in place of watercress due to availability. Awesome! I think the amount of butter is fine but if using arugula, just a teaspoon or so of lemon juice is plenty due to the bitter/spicy arugula flavor. Just had it as a side dish with some pasta.

This was delicious! I've always had kohlrabi raw and never tried to cook it before. I used it as a side dish to roasted chicken instead of the recommended duck. I also followed the previous reviewers suggestions. I steamed the kohlrabi for ten minutes and then sauteed for ten minutes. I also added tomatoes to the recipe during the last few minutes of sauteeing. It was great.

This was my first venture with kohlrabi. Served this as a side to a duck breast Xmas dinner. Maybe the bulbs I bought were too big because as the preparation proceeded I could sense that sauteeing was not going to be enough. When in doubt I check with Mme. Rombauer and she said 1) to get small bulbs or the veg "might not be worth preparing" (too pithy), and 2) to boil them 20 minutes. I still liked the idea of sauteeing so I boiled the bulbs just 10 minutes and then back to sautee. That seemed to do the trick. Still a little pith here and there but not much and not bad. Watercress was nice - add late so it keeps it color. And my thanks to the cook in San Francisco who suggested adding tomatoes. I did this - a few plums, diced, and it added to flavor and gave the dish a nice Christmasy color.

I made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving and it was so easy and delicious!!! You don't need to use so much butter and I didn't use the duck fat, salt and pepper were good too, I also think I will add tomatoes next time, but alone it's wonderful as well!!!!
