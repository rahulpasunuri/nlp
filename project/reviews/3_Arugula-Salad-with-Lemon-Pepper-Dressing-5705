Quite refreshing. I didn't find it too lemony. The zing of the arugula was matched by the spices and lemon. However, definetly should not be paired with a very mild dish such as dover sole.

Is it me, or was this recipe not tested? Excessively tart, and I enjoy tartness. The qualities typically enjoyable in the flavor of arugula were completely overwhelmed by the way-the-heck over-lemony dressing.
