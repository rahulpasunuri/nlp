I've made this twice, the first time according to the recipe, and it was great. The second time, for a little added zing, I only used 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and I substituted balsamic vinegar for the other tablespoon. Also great, but in a slightly different way. Just be careful not to get the vinegar all in one or two spots. Needless to say, it can pretty quickly overwhelm the parmesan flavor...

Of course this is wildly addictive and delicious, but how about elevating the taste experience with truffle oil. I use this recipe as a base but prefer a variety of small kernel popcorn and drizzle a generous teaspoon or two of white truffle oil. For even more flavor, use a truffle salt instead of plain. Who needs a movie, I'll even eat this up at breakfast!

Loved this! We were looking for a new way to dress up popcorn, will make again.

I would give this 4 forks for flavor, especially with Parmigiano-Reggiano and freshly ground pepper. There was a nice bite from the pepper, but not too much. The texture, however, left a lot to be desired. The unadorned popcorn was nice and crunchy, but as soon as I added the oil, even though it was very evenly distributed, the popcorn became soft and gummy. I think I will experiment with different amounts and applications of oil - perhaps a mister would work better.

Made with Orville Redenbacher's Pure White, and omitted the salt (it's pre salted). The pepper and cheese take popcorn to a new level. The perfect midnight snack - feels indulgent without the calorie overload.

I made it exactly as described. Simple and delicious version of plain popcorn.

Newman's Own microwave popcorn makes this a quick and easy snack. Instead of black pepper and salt, I like to use crushed red pepper flakes and garlic powder. To coat the popcorn well, I transfer it into a plastic freezer bag, pour all the ingredients on, seal, and shake. Scrumptious!

I followed the basic popcorn recipe (see my review there) and then salted lightly and added cheese (used pecorino romano as I didn't have parmesan on hand). I made this for a special snack for my daughter's kindergarten class and was greeted with exclamations that it was the "Best popcorn EVER!!!!". Parents even mentioned to me the next day how much their kids raved about it. Who knew? For myself, I would definitely add the pepper, but for 24 five year olds, I thought it was safer to omit it. Anyway, it was a BIG hit!

Very good - nice savory twist on popcorn!

I haven't made this yet, but, jeez oh man, how would I know with such weirdness occurring in the reviews. I have a good eye for recipes, and this looks like a good one, so I'll try it for my autumn party, most likely.

Patrice and Liza dears, that was a joke. This is very good to munch on during movie night. But be careful; it can be addicting!

Excellent recipe! Easy. Very tasty. Even the little ones like it. Note: To the cook from Pago Pago - I think you're stretching it to call yourself a cook! Your ingredient swamping sounds like Lucy & Ethel. You absolutely should not rate this recipe since you did NOT try it!
