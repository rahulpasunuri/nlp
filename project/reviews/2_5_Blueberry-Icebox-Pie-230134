I have been making various types of pies for years. The texture was such that I could not eat this, others thought it was the worst dessert I have ever made. The color was almost comical looking - wouldn't recommend this from an appearance perspective either. Note: I have never worked with 'low fat', 'no fat' cream cheese. So if you're ok and know what to expect - then this dessert may be fine for you.

Pretty good and very easy to make - I do think it's supposed to be 4 tbsp of light butter - not 4 tsp

I made this for a coffee with several friends. Everyone was surprized that it was low fat! It was a nice treat. I will make this again.
