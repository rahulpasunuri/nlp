I like this soup . . . delicious and easy. I always puree the potatoes and leeks and then stir in the yogurt and I usually use milk because I typically don't have cream. I like the tarragon and yogurt flavors and it's really easy. The more potatoes you use the thicker it will be after puree.

I make this soup once a week. After reading all the reviews before I made it, I adjusted the recipe to use a whole bag of the baby red potatoes. I love the unique flavor that the tarragon gives the soup. It has become one of my staple recipes.

Terrible recipe - followed it precisely and ended up with watery, flavorless mess I had to throw away. Couldn't save it.

Really tasty with the tarragon but the soup was a little too thin for me. Next time I'll use more potatoes and consider making a roux rather than just adding the cream and yogurt to the stock. Also, four leeks aren't too many. Delicious though, and definitely something to make again.

I like this recipe because it mostly uses ingredients from my late-fall garden, just at the time when I want to make soup! The tarragon is a nice twist on the traditional potato-leek combination. Yum.

very good. did not have broth of any kind, used salt, pepper and touch of lemon juice plus I simply added a cup of crème fraîche instead of whipping cream+yogurt. and used normal potatoes without skins. delicious and simple

I made only a few small modifications -Instead of tarragon, I used Fines Herbes. I cooled the soup and added ricotta cheese with a splash of 2% milk, then reheated it. I also added a dash of white pepper. It was truly exceptional and perfect for a cold winter's night!

I have made this a few times and experimented with it. My husband loves the latest version the best: I slice up a few strips of bacon and use the rendered fat to sautee the leeks & onions. I omit the craem & yoghurt, but use a dollop of sour cream and the crispy bacon bits as topping. Delicious. (I know: cholesterol! But both of our lipid panels are great (high HDL, low LDL) and I use organic bacon...)

GREAT SOUP!!! I CHOSE TO USE THE VEGETABLE BROTH, AND WHITE SKIN POTATOS, SOUR CREAM INSTEAD OF WHIPPING CREAM. STILL GREAT! VERY RICH, AND THE TARRAGON,THE PERFECT TOUCH. ELEGANT BUT VERY EASY.MY KIDS LOVED IT.

I thought the soup was good, but not amazing. It lacked flavor. I used vegetable stock and will probably use chicken broth if I make it again. I did like the 2 teaspoons of tarragon, but I am rather fond of the herb. It's very easy to make.

Rating: 4
Delish, but I made the following alterations: 4 leeks (not 2); 1 lb. potatoes (not 1/2 lb.), and being the lush that I am, substituted sour cream for the yogurt. I made my own pork-based stock (from ham bones). Then pureed the whole shebang

I made this last night and it was awful. After tasting it we actually wondered if the yogurt might have been bad (it wasn't). I'm not sure what went wrong, as have made other potato leek soups that were quite delicious before, but somehow this recipe just doesn't work.

I made this soup on Christmas Eve and found it was a cinch to prepare, and absolutely delicious. A great comforting soup for a cold winter's night, and the leftovers tasted exceptional. I added more pepper than the recipe called for as well as a few more leeks. Very hearty and delicious! Definitely going into my winter rotation.

I made this soup without the tarragon, and used fat free yogurt. It was still very tasty, and since it's easy to make I will definitely enjoy it again.

Rating: 3
Smells amazing... Made this with leeks and white flesh sweet potatoes from the market. Used the blender to puree, chicken broth to thin, and evaporated skim milk to add creaminess. It needs very little, as the sweet potato and leek have a wonderful flavour all on their own-just a little salt and pepper, but I added a couple of sprigs of rosemary to "infuse" flavour during the final simmer which I will remove before serving. I will top with fried pancetta and some sheep milk cheese with SD tomato and garlic...haven't sat down yet, but I know it will be fabulous!!

I love this soup. I puree everything and add the tarragon at the end. It's good both hot and cold and my guests always ask for the recipe. I don't know why, i found the yoghurt taste too strong, until I switched to organic yoghurt and now it seems just right.

Rating: 3
This was a pretty tasty recipe. I made it dairy- free by omitting the yogurt and cream and instead pureeing half of the soup, as other reviewers suggested. It still wasn't quite thick and creamy enough for me. Next time I'll try it with cream. I'm not crazy about tarragon, so I cut down to one teaspoon which was the perfect amount. There was a nice hint of tarragon without being overwhelming. I also threw in some other vegetables. Overall, really good flavors.

Delicious! Didn't change a thing. Used half homemade chicken stock (because that's all I had), and half store-bought veg stock. Quick and easy.

this a great substitute for viccychois (sp). Didn't use yogurt or creme. Used hand blender. Lovely cool soup for warm weather - I live in sw FL and have it all the time.

I heard about leek potatoe soup so I wanted to try this. I like tarragon, and don't cook much with it. I thought the recipe was calling for too much tarragon so I cut it back a 1/4 teaspoon. I was right, and it was still too strong. But good enough to eat. I added bacon the next day like others, and it was better. This was a good soup with our steak entree and roasted vegetables. I will try it again but next time with only 1t of tarragon

Delicious! I added 1 cup of shredded cabbage and one chopped celery stalk and simmered with the leek. Scrumptious!

This is a great winter soup, it's hearty and delicious and tastes great walking in from the cold. I pureed about half of the soup just before serving, which added a nice creamy texture since I forgot to add the cream and yogurt - but with the puree you couldn't even tell and it was still excellent.

On a very chilly evening I wanted to make this as a side dish with burgers. I would have made it as written, but that was not to be the case. Hubby was going shopping for some "stuff", so I asked him to get me a bunch of leeks at the local food store (Lowe's). Well, they had 2 bunches that appeared half rotten, so he went to Wal-Mart, and they didn't have any. (These are the only 2 food stores in this fairly good size small town.) Since I had already prepped everything else, I subbed 1 cup of "Barbecue" green onions (they have a large bulb at the bottom) and 1 cup of regular green onions for the leeks. Used russet potatoes, 1/2 tsp. dried tarragon leaves, 1 tsp. dried cumin, 1/4+ tsp. black pepper, and a 6 oz. container of low-fat plain yogurt. Didn't add any cream, as that would have made it too sweet. Hubby says it is a 5 forker, add more potatoes next time, and also make it EXACTLY as I did this first time!!! I would really like to try the leek version! It is Yummy--do try it!!

Quick and easy, but make sure you add enough salt and pepper. Great with a grilled sandwich. I substituted 2%milk for the cream and it was fine. I also blended the whole thing to make it smooth.. much better that way.

used EVOO instead of butter, sweet potatoes instead of red-skinned, added dried porcini mushrooms, used basil and thyme instead of tarragon. then pureed about half of it. the color was a fall orange, and the taste was deep and scrumptious. i licked te pot...enjoy!!

This was a nice, quick, last-minute weeknight soup. I used an immersion blender and it came together well. I think I will add bacon to what's leftover...wish I had read those reviews BEFORE I sat to eat!!

The soup was good, not great, however. I ended taking a few ladle fulls of the potatos out and pureeing the rest. I used sour cream instead of yogurt, and the texture was perfect after the potatos went back in. I didnt like the tarragon in it, though. I would use thyme instead if I made it again. All in all, good texture, nice flavor..just not my favorite. The tarragon is a little too sweet for me.

Rating: 3
Easy and delicious. I made this with fresh dill instead of tarragon (about 2 Tbs) and it blended perfectly with the yogurt and leeks. I used whole milk and a bit more potato. The yogurt flavor is what makes this notable among potato-leek soups. Very sophisticated with a good white wine.

This was quite good. I used vegetable broth, dried tarragon, pureed the soup before adding light cream and fat free yogurt. Didn't miss the fat either. Great comfort food. Will be a regular during the fall/winter.

Wonderful cold weather soup! The yogurt definately adds a litle extra zip. I used a hand blender right before adding the cream and yogurt. I like it a litle smoother.

The soup was excellent and the bit of yogurt really gave it a tangy kick. I used canned vegetable broth (dressed up by simmering with carrots, celery, onion, leek, bay leaf, parsley and thyme for 30 minutes beforehand), plus I added chopped celery to the leeks, onions and garlic. Overall it was a very easy dish that I will make again.

I pureed the whole mixture after cooking it then added yogurt, I used lowfat, and I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream. Very tastey and creamy. I also added a few pieces of bacon crumbled right before serving.

I thought this was pretty good, but I wouldn't recommend using mushroom broth (as I did to make a veggie-friendly version). It tasted good, but when I added the cream and sour cream (instead of yogurt), it made the soup an awful, watery grey, sort of like dish water. My dh refused to even taste it. Other than looking totally unappetizing, it wasn't bad. Although it seemed really thin at first, it thickened up nicely after sitting for a while. I think I'll try a light-colored veggie broth if I make this again.

i didn't have yogurt so i added extra cream and ended up mashing everything in the pot when it was done cooking. i used dried tarragon. i thought this was a good soup but i LOVE soups. the rest of my family didn't care for it. i kept thinking it needed clams or something but it is very filling soup.

This is an excellent potato-leek soup recipe. I peeled white potatoes and blended with a hand blender at the end. The yogurt is a crucial ingredient and I wouldn´t leave it out - it makes for a very nice tangy flavor.

I made it as described and found it a bit plain, and the potatoes didnt soften up that much. I took other reviewers suggestions and mashed the potatoes which gave it a better texture, but still not good enough. I ended up pureeing it and it tasted pretty good after that.

Oh my goodness!!! So easy, and I love this soup!! I usually wait and just add a swirl of heavy whipping cream and a little sour cream or yogurt just prior to serving in individual bowls, rather than mixing the creamy portions into the whole soup. Seems to make a nicer reheat then. Lovely soup. Oh, I sub scallions for the onion.

Great recipe as described! I actually, peeled the potatoes, deleted the yogurt & cream - and instead pureed the soup in my blender. Then added just before serving a TBSP or two of cream in a whirl for decoration. Less calories and more visual!

I liked this soup a lot, although I ended up changing it a bit - I added some bacon with the onions and garlic, also did not use any tarragon. By the time I was ready to add the yogurt/cream, I decided that the soup was good as it was, and thus omitted it. Also used baking potatoes, which added some thickness to the soup once it somewhat dissolved.

I looked through all the recipes for Potato Leek soup and couldn't find one like the one I make so I thought I would share - I use coconut milk instead of cream or milk and add cumin for flavour. I get rave reviews. Otherwise my recipe is similar to this one.

Bit on the bland side considering all the garlic, onion, and, of course leeks. Definitely will do it again, this time using all whole-milk European style yogurt instead of half-heavy cream, half yogurt. The extra tanginess will add some needed zing!

I added some fresh rosemary and served the soup like the recipe states then pureed the remaining left-overs. Though it was good the first time, it was even better the second time around. Next time I may try substituting milk for the whipping cream to cut down on the fat content.

My boyfriend is the cook in the household, and I would just like to mention the changes he made to this soup that took it from very good to utterly sublime. He added fresh basil, fresh rosemary, lots of chilis, and some porcini mushrooms. He used veggie stock since I'm vegetarian, and added chilis and extra garlic. Lastly, he used table cream instead of whipping cream since it was on hand. This soup was hearty, complex, a virtual knock-out, and it only got better the next day.

Rating: 3
I thought this soup was yummy, though it was a little bland when finished. I decided to add a tablespoon of creamed horseradish, and that definitely helped to add some flavor! I also added more tarragon than the recipe called for, and I took another's suggestion and added some watercress too. I threw in some shitake mushrooms, and also blended half of the soup in a food processor, which made it creamy yet chunky. definitely a good winter soup!

Great, simple, hearty soup that is perfect for winter. I use white potatoes instead of yukon gold for a fresher, less buttery taste, and I leave out the yogurt/cream, it really doesn't need it. Finally, I tend to use a couple more leeks and a little more tarragon than specified. This soup definitely benefits from being blended or processed.

Excellent soup, but next time I will thicken it up a little bit with a few more potatos. I am still trying to figure out the measurements for the leeks since 2 leeks ended up being about a quarter of a cup instead of 2 cups. Any ideas?

Not sure if I like this soup enough to make again... I pureed it which was a bad idea. I don't want mashed potato soup. I should have known better. I've had better potato/leek soups than this one. And even though I like tarragon, it didn't seem to work well with this soup.

This was a terrific soup. I left out the cream and yogurt, pureed slightly with my hand blender, but forgot to lighten up on the tarragon. For someone who didn't want a completely vegetarian meal,chunks of ham would taste wonderful. This one is a keeper.

This soup is A-W-E-S-O-M-E!! I have made it twice now and it was just as good the second time around. Even my two year old grandson who hates everything if it isn't meat ate two bowls. The tarragon can get overwhelming, so I use a combination of fresh basil and thyme. Delicious!

This is a very elegant soup. Served at my son's Christening party and it was a hit. (It was a Bon Appetit moment - we looked like the people they feature in the mag -- dressed up, laughing, and eating - LOL!) I pressed on the potatoes a bit after they were tender but that was not necessary in hindsight (I listened to previous reviewers who love changing recipes!) The soup as it is, is not meant to be pureed. I served the beef tenderloin with mustard-tarragon sauce (same issue, RSVP) as the entree to continue the tarragon flavor. Superb!

I also pureed the soup before serving, and would recommend generous salt and pepper to bring out the subtle flavors of the soup

A good, basic, soup. Much better consistency if you puree about 1/3 of it, or, more easily, mash some of it right in the pot with a flat potato masher.
