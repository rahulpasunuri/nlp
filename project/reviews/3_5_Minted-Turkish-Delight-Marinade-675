I marinated a pound of boneless, skinless chicken breasts with this, then grilled. So, so good! A nice kick, but not outrageously spicy. I served the chicken with Turkish zucchini patties found here on epicurious.com. The two dishes went very well together. I would have loved to eat the leftovers, but my crazy pup got to them first.

I used it as a dip as suggested. The portions of ingredients are all off in this recipe. Way too much cinnamon and lemon. The cinnamon seems out of place, too. Wouldn't make again.

EXCELLENT. I skimped on the spices, a little afraid they would be overposering --but no need; after trying this i think I souldve followed the recipie exactly! make extra--- i wish I had had more for garnishing meat.

The flavors blended as if they'd been hanging out together for several days, even immediately after I finished making it. It was perfect on grilled chicken (picky child) and lamb (everyone else), served in pita bread with cucmbers, tomatoes and red onion. Picky child got ketchup.

Used this on chicken breasts, grilled then stuffed in pita bread. Terrific. A hit with even my pickiest eaters.

My favorite marinade for grilled boneless chicken breasts. Received many compliments. Also used the marinade to make a lamb stew that was wonderful.

I looked to this recipe to use up my abundance of mint from my garden. I had used it with chicken and found it pleasant; my husband, unfortunately, didn't care for it (found it "sour"). There are other marinades that I would use before I consider this one again. One thing in its favour; the chicken was very tender

This is a wonderful, unusual marinade which greatly enhanced the chicken breasts that I grilled the other night. In the future I will try it with shrimp or chicken wings.

A really simple, flavourful marinade/dip. Next time I would only use half the lemon zest as I found it a bit overpowering.

Don't let the large quantity of mint in this recipe scare you...it does not overpower the flavor of the marinade in the least. I used it in making chicken kabobs - the meat was tender and delicious. I will definitely use this quick and easy recipe again.
