did not cube pork, seared on stove top then braised in oven for 2hrs @300 then shredded with 2 forks, used 2lb piece. added: 2T chinese 5 spice, 1/2 t Cayenne plus a little more, zest of 1 lemon, 1/3 cup soy even though doubled all else (sugar, ginger and sherry) it was plenty salty, chopped flat leaf parsely and cilatro equal amounts on top. ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS! serve with reisling or gwertgermeiner (sp?)
