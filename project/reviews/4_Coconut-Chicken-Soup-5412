I have never made any Thai food before so I wasn't sure how this would turn out. This soup was so delicious! It's the closest I've tasted to my favorite Thai restaurant. I can't wait to make this again! I doubled the recipe and think everyone should do the same-even if you're cooking for one!

Holy *expletive deleted* this is good. Like, really, really good. I made it as written except lite coconut milk is for wusses. Full fat all the way! Guys, please, use a little chopper and chop that lemon grass up really finely. I realize that it's harder than diamonds to do with a knife, but the flavor won't infuse correctly if it's just in strips. Also, chili-garlic sauce is a must. This isn't that hot /at all/ unless you're used to just salt and pepper and are actually suspicious of pepper. I rank this as one of the best soups I've ever made. I just ate almost half the pot single-handedly. Deeeelicious.

Delicious and super quick to make. Threw frozen chicken stock into a pot and added other ingredients while it was thawing. Didn't have chili-garlic paste either, so I used Gochugang and added some garlic scapes. Will be making this often!

This soup was amazing! Used 2 seeded Thai chilis and added some spinach. Didn't have chili garlic paste so just added chili paste and minced garlic. Didn't mince the lemon grass -- just cut lengthwise. Added some lime leaves. Just used normal coconut milk.

This is fabulous! I just sliced the lemongrass lengthwise once, and sliced the ginger, and put that and smashed garlic clove, chili seeds from oil (didn't have the serrano) all into cheesecloth tied with twine. It was nice as you didn't have to bite into anything that you only want for flavor. This was so good that my picky 12 year old boy raved about it! I added some leftover white rice. Will make this again and again.

A WONDERFUL soup!!! It is the closest in taste to the ones I have had in Bangkok of the 15 or so recipes that I have tried. Do use 2 cans of Chicken Broth. I only had a Jalapeno Pepper, so I seeded that and used it instead. Do add 1 T of palm or brown sugar. I used 2 chicken breasts. Use 2 5" pieces of lemon grass and split them in half; much easier to remove. In Bangkok they usually give you rice to add to your soup if desired; it is a great idea.

This is excellent soup! I made adjustments as per pantry and reviews: Added garlic and shallot to ginger, cut serrano chili lengthwise and removed seeds, took two 5"lengths lemongrass split lengthwise but not chopped. Sauted all this 30s to release flavor, then added 1 can coconut milk, 2.5c broth, fish sauce and oyster mushrooms. Tasted as it cooked and removed the pepper once it was a mild heat I thought the kids would eat. Skipped chili garlic sauce & put on table as condiment - perfect. Rather than chicken I used shrimp. Could easily go either way and will do with chicken next time that is in the fridge. Was so friggin good I only wish I had tripled the recipe and skipped the main course!

I like my food hot, and my thai food doubly so, so I added shallot, garlic, and about double of all the heat-adding elements (ginger, chilis, chili-garlic sauce), and it was GREAT. This soup has a lot of flavor for how few ingredients it has and how fast it comes together.

Rating: 4
I followed the recipe in every way except I used a whole lemon cut in half (left floating in the broth) instead of the lemongrass...since I was too lazy to go to the store to buy some. It was very flavorful and quick to throw together. We all agreed it would also be great with clams or shrimp as well.

Rating: 4
I used 1.3lb's boneless/skinless chicken thighs since I like dark meat. Added 2 tablespoons garlic in place of chili/garlic sauce since they didnt have it at my local grocery store and I didnt feel like driving across town to the Asian market. I added 1 tablespoons palm sugar after reading the other reviews about it needing a little sweetener. I added bean thread's noodles and (hate to admit it) used Bouillon since I had it...! I didnt have cheese cloth so I just cut the lemon grass length wise so the pieces were easy to fish out while eating. Next time I think Ill try tofu instead of chicken.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe! It tasted very authentic. Added three crushed garlic cloves and simmered the first eight ingredients with the bones from the deboned chicked for a deeper chicken flavor. I removed the bones before adding the final four ingredients. I also doubled the thai chili peppers and still found it just mildly hot, but nevertheless delicious.

Rating: 4
This was so easy and great! I cut down on the lemongrass and I think it was a good thing, it had plenty of flavor, and the lemongrass stalk was a little annoying to pick out of each bite. I also left out the serrano chili since I was giving it to my kids, it was plenty spicy. Very reminiscent of the awesome soups at Thai restaurants, YUM!

Basically this soup is the business. Chilli garlic sauce? Used fresh crushed garlic and teaspoon or so of palm sugar as is traditional. Used sliced chicken breast fillet - no fat. And used Thai basil. Beautiful, soft and fragrant.

Incredibly delicious! I took this to a college-age group for dinner and they loved it! I found this recipe to be quick and simple.

This was simply delicious. I followed other reviewers and jazzed it up a bit, adding a teaspoon of brown sugar and a dash of salt, even some dried red pepper flakes (but that was because I didn't have the hot chilies and had to use milder ones). One thing I also added that I don't think anyone else mentioned was unsweetened coconut. I sprinkled about two tablespoons on top, just before serving and it was divine!

Yesssssss. I ate this every night for a week and when it was gone wished for more! A good level of heat, acid, and salt!

Not as great as I thought it might be. Could use more mushrooms and a bit of sugar. The lemongrass seemed a bit fibrous, so I might next time, try to figure out how to take it out of the soup before serving it. We added rice noodles and that made it a bit more substantial. Probably won't make this one again.

This is an absolutely wonderful recipe! My family (including my 11 year old and 14 year old) devoured the entire pot with ooohs and aaahs! For the most part, I followed the recipe to the letter. Unfortunately, I couldn't find lemongrass so I substituted one half of a small lemon that I floated in the soup as it cooked. I love ginger and serranos but I decided I didn't want to have those bits floating in the finished product so I coarsely chopped the ginger (plus a little extra!), sliced the serrano into rounds, and tied it all in cheesecloth. I removed the lemon half and cheesecloth bundle before adding the basil, green onions and 2 Tbsp. lime. Also, I added extra thinly sliced chicken thighs and used half shitake and half button mushrooms. It was awesome and I look forward to making it again! Enjoy!

I am a purist, but being high in the Rockies I can't always get fresh lemon grass, so I use Gourmet Gardens in a squeeze tube. It's a one-to-one ratio with the fresh and it was just great. Also, I used Thai Taste kaffir lime leaves (again, I am missing Zurich where I could always get fresh leaves which are totally unknown up here). I made my own chicken stock, adding ginger and lemon grass to the usual herbs and veggies I load up on in the stockpot. I think this makes a huge difference. When I get my hands on some Louisiana bluefin lump crabmeat I'll try that instead of the chicken.

Great soup. I have made this recipe twice now, but I'm having trouble with the fresh lemongrass...the first time I minced it, the second time I cut bigger pieces to be able eat around them in the soup. Neither were very successful, I think next time I will cut up the lemon grass and put it in a cheese cloth...to still get the great flavor...but remove before serving. Has anyone tried this?

Rating: 4
OMGosh this was so easy and was notably better than the restaurant versions I have had at the Thai places in Atlanta. My entire family lapped it up like grizzly bears after hibernation! I tried thickening it with a little flour and poured it over steamed rice and that was a hit as well. Would not recommend changing a thing on this one.

I'm a huge fan of the thai coconut soup. I made this and I found that is was equal if not better than the resturant version. If you use thai basil it makes it that much better. I love this recipe.

I've been looking for a good Coconut Chicken Soup that matches the flavor at my favorite Thai restaurant. This is the closest it's come so far. I was able to get Thai basil at an Asian grocery store; other than that, no changes. Divine!

Awesome! Added a tsp of brown sugar, and used minced garlic and sriracha in place of the chili-garlic sauce. Wooo!

Awesome! Didn't have chili garlic sauce, so added 2 cloves of minced garlic and a good squirt of sriracha. The only other change which is really important is to add a tsp of brown or demerara sugar. Can't believe how good this tastes with so little time investment...I even used (gulp) powdered bouillion for the stock!

Wonderful, full of flavor. Only change I made was to start with pieces of a roasted chicken and more ginger.

This was the starter for an Asian inspired halibut meal served with coconut rice & fresh vegs. The hot/sweet balance was great; because we like hot food, I added an extra serrano pepper and an extra tsp. of chili-garlic sauce. The only change I made was to use cilantro instead of the Thai basil. This is definitely a keeper!

Rating: 4
Rave reviews from all my guests. Will definitely make this again. I, too, cut the lemongrass in 6" chunks (and sliced lengthwise) and tied it together, then pulled it out before serving. I made it the day before the party and the flavors were even better when I served it the next day. If you do that, add the lime juice, green onions and Thai basil at the last minute before serving and not the day before.

So good! We did tweak it by infusing the chicken broth with lemon grass, lime zest and juice, and ginger for about an hour...We also added peeled tomato slices at the very end along with sprigs of cilantro. Really good. Thai chilis and thai basil are better than what it called for if you can find them. We served it over jasmine rice. GREAT!

This is an absolutely wonderful recipe!!! I made a few "abbreviations" and a couple of changes. I was lucky enough to find minced lemongrass in a tube! It's made by Gourmet Garden, and I found it a Publix! I also used 4 cups fat-free broth and 3 cans lite coconut milk. I doubled the chili sauce, and added a touch of Splenda. Maybe not absolutely authentic, but it's out of this world and more healthy than the original recipe.

Rating: 4
I've made this following the recipe exactly and it's delicious Today tho couldn't find lemongrass - and noticed Campbells makes a new broth - Thai Chicken broth with lemongrass and added it to the the regular chicken broth. The soup turned out very well - since Campbells is widely distributed perhaps this tip wiill make it easier for people to find difficult to access ingredients.

I made this last night, a terrific antidote to an early cold snap. Of course, being from rural Maine, I could not find a few ingredients (lemongrass, Thai basil) so I subbed lemon zest for the lemon grass as an earlier reviewer suggested. Being from Coastal Maine, I subbed lovely Maine shrimp for the chicken, adding at the very end. YUM!

Rating: 4
Delicious & simple to make. If you're looking for that creamy, citrus-y Thai restauraunt coconut soup with a bite--this is it. Add some matchstick carrots and/or sliced bell pepper if you want a tasty variation. I prefer to double the basil and cut back just a tad (minus a TB) on the fish sauce, but the original recipe is still great.

Rating: 4
A perfect dish as is, better still with large prawns instead of the chicken. I used corriander (cilantro) rather than basil and cooked the chopped stems and roots first with the chicken stock before straining. I also doubled the chilli. In Malaysia this soup is called Laksa.

This soup delivers a jolt. It's intensely spicy, but the coconut milk offsets the heat. This soup was part of a low-fat dinner so chicken breasts stood in for the thighs. The combination of ingredients sizzles. This was so good I could hardly wait to have the leftovers.

I've made this dish a couple of times now and find it simple to prepare and delicious. It's also amazing served over rice or with rice added to the soup. I made this again this afternoon but forgot to buy fish sauce - the soup tastes good but something is missing - is the fish sauce that important to the soup ? I know it's somewhat of a staple in the orient - is there something that you could use as a substitue?

Great soup. A tip on lemongrass: next time you find a good healthy stalk, place it in water and it will quickly sprout roots. Plant it in soil and it will quickly spread out to fill its container. Remember to bring it in before the first frost, however.

Made this soup last night and it was really good. It was just my husband and I so a halved the recipe, and it still turned out perfectly. I will make this again as it was easy to put together for a quick meal, but it would also make an excellent first course for a dinner party.

Outstanding. However, apparently lemon grass in hard to find in Northwest Pennsylvania in January, so I talked to a chef who said to zest a lemon into the soup instead. I would say the results were pretty good - a soft lemon flavor. I'll be sure to try the lemon grass when it becomes available. We always get this soup when at a Thai restaurant, and this soup was right on. We added thin fresh tomato wedges and cilantro to make it more like our favorite Thai place. Husband had three bowls!

Rating: 3
Written on my shopping list were lemon grass and green onions, so I got one stalk of lemon grass and a wrapped bunch of green onions. But, to my surprise, you need more than that to follow the recipe. So that's my tip on this one. Don't short-change yourself on the lemongrass and onions. (And by the way, a little sign at the co-op said that only the heart or bulb of lemongrass should be used. If you follow that, I'd get 6-8 stalks.) Anyway, delicious soup.

Such a good and easy recipe. The soup has so much flavor. I took the suggestion of sauting the mushrooms in some butter and they were great. I also added some brocolli when I added the chicken and that was good too. I suggest chopping the lemongrass into 2 inch long pieces and then it will be easy to pick out.

I made this soup last night and used two cans of straw mushrooms. I brought it to the office, heated it up and people I don't know stopped by to try it.It was a big hit. It is also a good way to use up cooked chicken from the freezer. Its a keeper.

Very good. I used a combination of shitake and white mushrooms and sauteed them for a couple minutes (along with a chopped orange pepper, for color, and the ginger and pepper) before adding the liquids. I also added a bit more chili-garlic and was glad I did. I used one can of regular coconut milk and one light and I think using all regular would taste even better. If I wasn't on Atkins I would just deal with the light, but next time I'll try it with all regular.

This is a keeper. The less-common ingredients bring this way above ordinary fare, a wonderful change for the pallate, especially when served before a meal of more familiar dishes. Your guests will think they're dining at a restaurant.

It is very tasty..great recipe, although next time I wouldn't chop the lemongrass and add..I would either tie up some sticks and take them out before serving, or tie them in cheese cloth..I don't like spitting the pith with every bite, it's like having wood pieces in your mouth. (I used fresh)I am definitely making it again!

Rating: 4
Great dish! Quick, delicious and better than any coconut soup that I've ordered in a thai restaurant. I added snow peas and bamboo shoots to make the soup a little more substantial. Also, lemongrass tends to be a little chewy even if it is cut into small pieces. The easiest solution is to cut it down the center lengthwise and tie it with kitchen twine for easy removal when the soup is done. And don't forget to add a touch of sugar as the other reviewers have suggested.

Rating: 4
We really liked this. My husband said it was in his top 10 list. Our market was out of fresh lemongrass, so I bought whole dried lemongrass, which I'd never used before. The directions on the bottle said to soak the pieces until soft and then chop them, but I just put what seemed like an appropriate amount in whole. This saved a lot of hassle and seemed to work just fine.

Rating: 3
So good. I just finished making this and I have to say, it was better than the version i've had at the thai restaurant in town. One word to those of you who happen to live in a place where fresh lemongrass is unavailable: I used some dried, chopped lemongrass that I found at my local co-op. Yuk. Just say no. I also threw in a flavoring packet from a Taste of Thai noodle package (sorry professional thai chef!) that was lemongrass flavor and it was actually really good. And I added some rice noodles. so so good.

We loved it very much. I did some changes. I had a whole chicken, skinned it and placed it with the first 8 ingredients in a pressure cooker for 5 minutes. I took the chicken out, got all the bones out and then proceded with the rest of the recipe. Excellent....

Rating: 2
I would just like to point out to the Professional Thai Chef that the heading at the top of the recipe points out that this is a "new take" on a popular thai recipe.... I can understand the desire for authenticity, but perhaps those comments are better reserved for a recipe that claims to be the real deal.

This is a below average recipe for Tom Kha Kai(Gai) soup. You need: Fresh Galanga (not regular ginger), kaffir lime leaves (bai magroot), straw mushrooms, lemon (not lime) juice, Chili-Tamarind paste (nam phrik pao), thai basil, Thai chilis until you cant take the heat (not serrano), Lemongrass in 2 inch lengths, Coconut palm sugar is a MUST, and NO ONIONS, but some garlic will help. At the end, float fresh cilantro leaves on top and serve with steamed jasmine rice on the side and thai iced tea.

We had this soup at a restaurant and loved it so I made this one at home and it was awsome. I found fresh lemon grass at Safeway which was the hardest thing to find out of all the ingredients(I also found lemon grass flakes and stalks in a jar in the oriental section of grocery store) If fixing for people that dont like spicy foods omit the chili pepper. My husband and I just love this soup and make it just about every weekend!
