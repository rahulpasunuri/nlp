Smells bad. Tastes bland. I took one bite. My teenage daughter who will eat anything took a small bite. We agreed that "one fork" is too good for this recipe. Skip it.

Yum. The sweetness of the carrot balances the zip of the onion and lemon perfectly. I'll definitely make this again.

I made this for a monthly pot luck and got rave reviews! It brought back memories of our mothers' light carrot salads. Very simple, easy and quick to make!!! And, I love it.
