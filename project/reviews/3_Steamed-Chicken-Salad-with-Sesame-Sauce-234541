I ended up with black sesame paste which made the dish look like it was sitting in an oil slick. Not attractive. I steamed the chicken since I don't have a microwave--and used about a pound and a half rather than 10 oz. It was good, but could be better. I would add a bit more rice vinegar and lighten up on the garlic. I will definitely try this again--with tahini instead.

I only used the sauce so I cannot comment on the amount of chicken. However, I didn't take as much water/juice as suggested, because I wanted a thicker sauce. I also had to use tahini instead of japanese sesame paste, and didn't take any sugar. Instead of rice wine vinegar I used mirin and finally I chopped some coriander (cilantro) into the sauce and it was delicious!
