This was good and easy especially for a quick main meal during the week. I followed the other cooks' advise and added onion and garlic. I didn't have fresh tomotes so I used canned. I sauted the onions and garlic in the tomato juice from the can. It worked out just fine. Also since only two of us were eating I used only one can of the beans. Very enjoyable.

I added lemon juice at the end and substituted half of the rosemary for thyme! Also i used dried beans which i pre-cooked with garlic and a bay leaf. This is a nice combination, but definitely needs some work!

This is real easy and such a great side. I threw some roasted pine nuts to add more texture and flavor. Fantastic.

I love this recipe. Pairs very well with grilled lambchops. Made exactly as written, which is rare for me, and it came out excellent.

You need to add garlic to this recipe - I do nice size slices/chuncks. Also, I crush up some of the beans so it gets a little thickness to it. You must add salt & pepper - it's always a big hit, and is even better the next day!

This is one of my favorites- it needs a little help. I add lots of garlic, onion sometimes instead of shallots. It does taste better with fresh tomatoes. I also cut the beans down to 1 or 2 cans, depends on how many are eating. It needs salt and pepper at the end. A recipe is like a blue print, sometimes it needs an adjustment or two. I love this with lamb chops.

Disappointing. It was pallid and uninteresting andI used the original recipe. If one uses canned tomatoes in any recipe the sodium content will up their flavour to dominate. It is not good looking after a day - wilted spinach and withered cherry tomatoes look depressing. There are many tastier white bean recipes.

I reduce the beans by 1/2 or 1/3, but otherwise a great recipe, got raves from my guests.

We had this instead of potatoes along a pork tenderloin. It was EASY and delicious. I made roughly half, and used diced canned tomatoes. Yum -- even better the next day, as a side to ham.

Lovely side dish. Healthy, tasty, and easy.

This dish taste much better when made the day before serving with a little extra rosemary and seasoning.

Second time I've made this. It is not delicious, but it's very pretty, and can be totally made in advance, unlike most vegetable dishes. Last night I quintipled the recipe for 70 guests. It was all eaten, no one asked for the recipe, but it's one of those great dishes to make ahead, take to a potluck, etc. I'll make it again and again---in my permanent repertoire. Only advice: make sure you almost totally reduce the broth to point of syrup. I have made with canned beans as well as boiled---no difference.

There are only two of us so I cut this recipe in thirds and only used one can of beans. I added more spinach than the recipe called for and didn't mash the tomatoes, only cut them in half. I also added more tomatoes. It was very good. Next time I'll add more shallots and possibly some garlic, more spinach and more tomatoes. I definitely would make this again.

Easy to make. The flavor was great. After reading the other reviews I added more rosemary to the dish.

This was attractive, but very underwhelming, taste-wise. It was kind of fun to mash the tomatoes and have them explode all over my apron, though! Still, there are a lot of recipes that pack flavor into beans, and this isn't one of them. I made it to the letter, but found it disappointing and won't be making it again.

I agree with the other reviewers; healthy, but must be seasoned heavily with salt and pepper.

This recipe takes bland to a whole new level - even after I added extra herbs and spices.

I was hoping for Spinach with Beans, but got Beans with not much Spinach, so next time I would at least double the spinach. If there is a next time, because frankly, I found this quite bland. The tomatoes dissolved -- next time I would use a lot more tomatoes and NOT mash them. And finally, this does not make a good leftover...it was even blander on day two.

I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using Great Northern beans as the store did not have cannelini. Though quick and healthy, the flavor was off. The rosemary seemed overpowering and the dish overall was disappointing. I won't make it again.

Simple to make and a good side dish for fish, chicken or beef! Leftovers were also great.

I made this for a family dinner. My aunt thought it was bland, but my dad and I loved it. I would add some crushed red pepper to give it a bit more kick and I would add some garlic. The flavor of the original recipe was delicious, but I thought it could use a little more umph.

I took this to a potluck supper and everyone raved about it! I had requests for the recipe, as a matter of fact. Quick and easy to make, and a wonderful combination of flavors. It's a healthy dish, too.

This was excellent-I made it with fish and with water instead of broth as we had guests who were kosher. The tomato taste was wonderful! This would make a great vegeterian dish.

I agree with everyone here, this is a great dish. I made it along with the leg of lamb as presented in the March 2005 issue. Since more than 24 tomatoes come in a package, I added exactly 24 and mashed them, then, as I remembered a reviewer mentioning, I added the rest of the tomatoes after I added the beans. I, however, tasted this dish at the stove when it was done, and I thought it tasted very bland, but at the table served with the lamb and the jus, it was delicious. As I really love spinach, I'm going to add probably 5 ounces more spinach next time when I make this.

Very tasty side dish. However, the tomatoes should be added later, as they completely broke down and dissolved. In the photo, you can see the rather intact tomatoes, despite the instructions telling you to use a potato masher. To increase the dish's eye appeal, I added more halved tomatoes after the beans were nearly done, or you could try skipping the mashing step.
