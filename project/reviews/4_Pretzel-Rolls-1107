I made these for our Cooking Club Oktoberfest menu, and they are surprisingly simple to make (just a little time-consuming). My suggestion is to only add enough of the hot water until the dough ball just comes together...do not add ALL of the water. Great texture, and pretty!

I forgot to add that I too used only half the seeds called for, and I also made double the rolls because they would have been huge.

Excellent. I am not a huge bread or pretzel fan, but these are very good. I have made them with both celery and caraway seeds. Both are very good. These roll freeze well.

followed the recipe almost exactly, i didnt measure the celery seed but dont think it would have been more than 1 tsp. i also think that that the celery seed adds flavorful but i definitely agree with halving the seeds. The texture was perfect however with a chewy exterior and soft center. will definitely make again.

I wanted a recipe for pretzel buns to make sliders with. I found these. I made 12, they are adorable, very chewy, and fun. These rolls were perfect for my sliders topped with stone ground mustard and homemade pickles! Thanks so much!

I saw these posted on a food blog I follow and decided to try them. Bread baking is hit or miss with me, but was I thrilled that these came out so well! Really, don't leave out the celery seed - gives a real pretzel taste. I'm so happy I tried these - will definitely be a saved recipe for the future!

My confession is that I had no idea what to expect from these, but they were chewy and delicious and ridiculously easy to make! I loved it with our whole "Octoberfest" meal. Was absolutely perfect with Left Hand Oktoberfest brew from CO. DEEEEELISH!!!!

These really were a cinch to make. It was my first actual attempt at making dough from scratch and the recipe was so simple. Definitely do not leave out the celery seed, though I did reduce as others suggested by almost half...it is powerful. Also followed the recommendation of another and made 12 rolls, which were still quite large. Went great with my weiner schnitzel!

These sounded intriguing and I enjoy the pretzel rolls my company's cafeteria makes, but I was somewhat disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly, which is highly unusual for me, but they turned out just ok. The crust wasn't as chewy as I had hoped. I did like the celery seed addition and they are fine as out- of-the-ordinary dinner rolls. As suggested by another reviewer, I made 12 rather than 8 and they seemed to be just the right size.

This is an EXCELLENT recipe, however, I would make the following changes. I would NOT leave out the celery seeds. This gives the bread its distinct pretzel flavor. Also I did not use the food processor. I just mixed it all up in a large stainless steel bowl. I found the dough much more elastic and pliable. I also increased the quantity of rolls from 8 to 12 to 16. I found 8 to be too few and the rolls were too large after rising the second time. 12 to 16 turns out the perfect size. Also, don't over salt them. This is a recipe I am going to use time and time again!!

Yum! Didn't have celery seed, so I used a 1/2 teaspoon of caraway seed which gave it a subtle rye flavor. Also skipped the egg glaze and opted for a molasses glaze (butter & molasses) which added some sweetness. My roomies and I loved them! They'll be great on their own or as a little sandwich.

This recipe is perfect as written. I have made these at least 10 times. (Why are so many leaving out the celery seeds? They are an important part of the recipe.) Absolutely delicious, and they look as if they came from a bakery. Serve them with mustard-butter.

These were amazing, though they come out quite large in the end. I also didn't use the celery seeds. Very easy to make and taste great hot with butter (I paired with herb butter including garlic, thyme and rosemary - delicious!)

Made it with the celery seeds and liked it a lot. I think I would go with a 1/2 teaspoon of seeds next time though as they pack quite a punch. Also, it might have been my wacko oven, but it took about 18 minutes to cook for me.

I have spent the entire day trying different pretzel recipes. This is by far the best one. I also will cut in half or omit the celery seeds, but agree...very easy and very satisfying.

This recipe was very close to what I grew up with. I left out the celery seeds. I am going to double the recipe and make it with my Kitchenaid stand mixer. These rolls freeze very well.

These were excellent. I left out the celery seeds, and they were really good. I thought they were surprisingly quick and they were definitely easy. I'll be making them again.

It's true! These rolls were easy to make, and perfect for a meal with kraut and sausages. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of the yeast, using slightly less yeast, as it was all I had in the refrigerator. The leftover rolls, I toasted up the next morning and ate like bagels - with cream cheese & lox.

Very easy recipe. I made these rolls exactly as recipe stated and they turned out great. They really do taste like soft pretzels.

Wet paper towel works best! Creates a steam environment while reheating.

Wow! Great recipe. Although I liked them better with the baking soda and water mixture coating. Would definetly make it again.Super easy, even for someone who has never made bread before.

These rolls are very tasty. I made them as written and would not leave out the seeds. I am making them again for our Oktoberfest this week.

I grew up with "Laugesemmeln" in Germany and this recipe comes pretty close. I have no idea about the celery seeds though, you will not find this added to pretzels or Semmeln in Germany! I omitted the eggwhite and brushed the rolls with a mixture of water and baking soda to get an even more typical taste.

I didn't have bread flour, omitted celery seed, and probably didn't knead long enough or let the formed rolls rise enough, and they still came out really good. Great recipe!

These were pretty easy (compared to traditional bread recipes) and fun. On a recent trip to LA we ate at House of Blues, where they served this awesome pretzel bread with our meal. I found this recipe and surprised my husband - a true pretzel connoisseur - with a batch of these rolls. One word to the wise...don't skip oiling the baking sheets. I thought it would be enough to just put down cornmeal...nope...they were bottomless rolls and the pans had to soak in the sink for a whole day!

These are good!! Mine turned out a little flat, but tasted great!! I think I just need to play around with rising & boiling times. I omitted the celery seeds (blech!). Also, I made smaller rolls--16 instead of 8-- and parbaked & froze 1/2 the batch for snacks during the week. Next time I'll make some twisty sticks, and substitute cinnamon-sugar for the salt.

Boy do I love this recipe--very quick and easy to make in my Cuisinart, especially when I don't want to get my hands and countertop covered with dough. My kids say "yechh" to the celery seeds so I leave them out and the rolls are just fine. I serve them with soup for dinner. Try 'em!!

These are fabulous! I make them often; try serving them with dijon mustard butter. My dinner guests go crazy over these. I use kosher salt instead of pretzel or sea salt, and bake them on "silpat" sheets -- cleanup is easy and no sticking!

It is an easy receipe and I actually used my mixer. I took 1/3 cup of the water mixed it with the yeast, let it sit for a few minutes, and mixed it into the dry mixture in the mixer and proceeded with the rest. The dough is easy to handle, no issues. The celery seed is another roadblock, my kids (pre-teen and teen) who love pretzels and have had similar rolls in restaurants did not embrace this receipe. It was tasty, although go easy on the salt. We love salted pretzels but I used course sea salt and the receipe called for "generous" but that was too much. I would like to hear from anyone that might have done without the celery seed or a substitute for same. In defense of this receipe, I served it with homemade vegetable soup. Maybe if I had served it with pot roast or something with a medium to heavy gravy it might have been better. Good enough to try but disappointing.

This is in response to the question on reheating the rolls - we just got back from a trip to Williamsburg where they served the pretzel rolls - but would not give out the recipe, so I'm THRILLED that I could find it at epicurious! As to reheating; if you wrap each roll in a paper towel and reheat in the microwave for appx. 45 seconds on level 4, they're DELICIOUS!! Still crisp on the outside but soft on the inside. I can't wait to try out the recipe!

These were kind of fun to make, but they were quite time consuming, so don't let that "cinch to prepare" description in the recipe fool you. Also, be generous with the salt - it's the best part!

Question: Has anyone made this recipe and reheated the rolls later on? How'd they taste reheated? Or have you prepared them up to the point of dipping and then waited an hour or two before baking? How'd that work?

I made these pretzels with my children over the holdiays. Not only was it a fun "hands on" project for them, the pretzels were delicious. I like to use pretzel salt as the topping, but my children don't care for it, so we used poppy seeds and sesame seeds on theirs and the results were equally delicious.

My cooking class prepared these rolls and they were a hit but we topped them with cinnamon sugar and butter like they do at the pretzel place. A good touch. Prepared by beginning cooks so you know the recipe is a good one.
