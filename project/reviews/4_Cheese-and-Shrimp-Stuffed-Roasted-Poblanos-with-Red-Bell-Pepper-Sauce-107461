I've made this for 10 years with adjustments. I use 2-3x shrimp, crawfish when in season or crabmeat. I rotate Panela with other Central American cheese or a quality Pepper Jack. I add garlic, toasted and ground cumin & corriander seeds plus a little lime juice/zest. Like others I often reduce the amount of the recipe for two. I'm going to try to flip the peppers--stuff charred red peppers and use the poblano for the sauce. The red pepper sauce does need flavor boost and reduced amount of stock --I've added greek yogurt for a tangy, thicker sauce.

omg with these darn peppers! the stuffing was delicious and i used monterey jack and goat cheese. mmm! i think it also helped that FOR ONCE i actually charred my peppers perfectly and they peeled in a cinch (usually my peppers come out of it looking like i beat them in a dark alley), so the dish actually looked as great as it tasted. labor intensive indeed, but well worth it.

This dish was delicious!! It's a bit time consuming, but so worth it. I roasted my peppers in the oven and just made sure to rotate them to get an even roast. I thought the red bell pepper sauce would make a good winter soup.

Outstanding dish! I made this recipe w/only 2 poblano chilies, fairly large in size. I decided to season the shrimp w/olive oil & Goya's adobo then grilled them while I charred the peppers. This gave the dish more flavor. Poblanos are generally mild in heat but sometimes you can get a hot one, just test it. We loved the Red Pepper sauce, it has multiple uses. I served this dish w/medium diced potatoes that I fried in a little veg oil. The dish was pretty to look at & delicious to eat. I might even make it w/chicken next time.

This is my all time favorite recipe. It looks gorgeous and it is delicious. I don't use goat cheese though, because no one I know likes it. I replace it with white cheddar or more jack. Very labor intensive, but worth it because you can make it all ahead of time,and pop the chilies in the oven when guests arrive. Nuke the sauce. I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!

Fussy, but delicious. I scaled the recipe down to just two stuffed poblanos, but kept the aromatics in the stuffing and sauce(garlic, shallots, herbs, serrano) at the amounts listed as we are both flavour fiends. Next time I'll make more but keep the jacked up flavour components. Like previous reviewers, I used jarred roasted red peppers in the sauce and they were fine.

I loved this recipe! I roasted the poblano's in the oven, which worked well but softened the pepper enough to make it tricky to peel and get the seeds out. It does look like you ruined it, but the stuffing held it together. The red pepper was to die for- it really brought the whole thing together. The dish had just the right amount of heat. This is beautiful looking dish.

I didn't care for this recipe at all. It threw off a lot of liquid and was pretty bland. The roasted pepper sauce was the only highlight. I saved it and used it in a chicken tortilla soup later in the week.

This was a very HOT hit! It was my first time working with peppers like this so it was a bit tedious. I ended up just completely turning them inside out and washing the seeds out. Some of the peppers were soft and split, but the stuffing held them together no problem. I forgot to cook the shrimp before stuffing the peppers but it turned out fine. I just cooked it a little bit longer. I used Feta and Goat cheese and just a touch of Montery jack to make sure the cheese melted well. I could have probably done without it. The goat and Feta together were a great combination. I also used jarred red peppers and it was fine. The only thing I would do different is consider using a little bit milder pepper. These were so hot that some of the guests couldn't eat it. But the one's who did, RAVED about it! P.S. The sauce isn't hot at all.

This was absolutely DELICIOUS! I love all things hot & spicy, and a good thing, because this dish set my mouth ablaze. I used crumble goat cheese, pepper jack cheese, and sharp cheddar & the results were oustanding! I have to say that it took an awful long time to prepare & right in the middle of it, the lights went out (luckily for only about 5 minutes)! I will definitely make this dish again, but next time, I think I'll start the prep the night before--my husband & I wound up eating at 10PM!

This recipe is a great base, but it is REALLY SPICY. I am known for loving really spicy food, I order food spicy when given a choice, and I had a hard time with this one. I would recommend cutting out at least some of the spice unless you and your guests order food extra hot at asian restaurants.

Served this dish to my husband and a friend, it was enjoyed by all. Couldn't find Poblano chilis, so I used Anaheim chilis instead. Worked quite nicely. Plus, you don't run the risk of having a super spicy one popping up as they are milder. Served with walnut/parsley pesto tortalini. Very filling, great comfort meal.

This is labor intensive but very good. My sauce was actually VERY hot thanks to large ancho, that I had to add more chicken broth. I kept the shrimp in larger chunks which I think helped. Also used mix of poblanos and anchos and both were good.

After peeling and deveining my shrimp, I threw them in a mixing bowl with about 2 Tblsp of olive oil, 1 - 1 1/2 tsp of cumin, same measurement of ancho chili powder, and salt and pepper to taste. They came out amazing. Also, I ended up using a goat cheese in conjunction with a cheddar and monterrey jack cheese blend, substituted the shallots for yellow onion, and used green bell peppers in the stuffing, and it came out great. I was dissapointed in the heat factor though, I was expecting it to be spicy from some reviews. I'll be adding at least 5 more jalapenos in the stuffing and sauce.

This was pretty labor-intensive for an unimpressive result. One of my guests got a pretty spicy poblano, so watch out. I doubled the filling, but I still didn't get a strong shrimp flavor. I think the cost and time outweigh the taste of this recipe. Skip it.

I made this for my husband and I. I took others advice and doubled the filling. I also made rice and added about 1/2 cup to the filling as well. That filled the large poblanos perfectly. Along with the red pepper sauce this does have a 'kick'. I served it for our dinner along with a simple salad. The menu in the magazine looks fabulous.

I have made this several times. My friends and family have, also. We love it. It is easy. I have done it without roasting the poblano peppers before stuffing and using jarred roasted red peppers for the sauce. It cuts the labor and is so good my husband now requests it regularly ...BUT! I think we may be addicted to this dish!

Very good. I used a jalapeño pepper and the sauce was very spicy. I oiled the peppers and broiled them in the oven, turning frequently until the skin popped and blistered. Then into a zip lock baggy for 10 min. and the peeling was tedious, but not hard.

I didn't have shrimp, but sauteed mushrooms and corn til some were browned and used monterey jack cheese. The filling was quite tasty and I think we'd like the shrimp, too. The bell pepper sauce was so good that the next morning I soft boiled an egg and used the leftover sauce for breakfast.

Delicious! I made this last night for 12 guests, and as one said 'this is some of your best work'. I mixed Oaxaca and Panela cheeses, as well as the goat cheese. I, too, used jarred red peppers for the sauce - hey, I was making for 12 - and it turned out great. I also added cream as one writer suggested. Nice bit of heat, nice interest and great presentation. I highly recommend this!

This was amazing! My husband and I feel we are seasoned southwestern chefs, but this recipe blew us away. It was by far the best chile dish we've ever had - including restaraunts. We used manchego cheese and reduced the sauce a bit. We also only used 5 poblanos and stuffed them to the gills, using toothpicks to hold the stuffing in. Took a little longer to cook (25min), but well worth the wait. !disfrutar!

This dish was everything everyone said it was -- beautiful and so delicious. I used about 6 oz. of pepper jack cheese rather than the combination of goat and panera (which I could not find). I also followed the recommendations of A Cook from San Antonio del Mar, Mexico about oiling the peppers before roasting and blistering rather than blackening them. That really made them much easier to peel and the peppers held their shape very well. I also accidently used 4 red peppers in the sauce while keeping everything else the same. It was delicious, and quite spicy, so I suspect the heat has to do with how hot your jalapenos are. My family loves spicy food, and this really filled the bill. Also, I reaheated the leftovers 2 days later and they were just as good, so I will definitely make these ahead of time for entertaining.

Made this tonight, and we were very pleased. Didn't have poblanos, but used anaheim's. Used the goat cheese and m. jack. Very impressive on the plate. Will make a good company dish, and will definitely make again and recommend to anyone. Various slight substitutions or changes could be made and still be delish. Try it!

I liked this, I just didn't like it as much as I had hoped. The good thing is, the stuffed chile makes a really beautiful presentation on top of the red pepper sauce. The red pepper sauce was great, especially after I added a few tablespoons of heavy cream to smooth it out and thicken it a bit. I just didn't feel that the stuffing was as flavorful as it should have been. Perhaps crabmeat would work better here. I think I will tinker with this recipe, because it has a lot of potential, but isn't quite a four forker as is.

Often times I am looking for a simple southern "crowd pleaser" that goes well with balmy early summer evenings at the beach.

This dish was a sublime experience. If we'd eaten this at a restaurant we'd have been thrilled. I would recommend wearing latex gloves while peeling and deseeding the roasted peppers. My fingers were spicy and I almost rubbed my eyes. Ouch. A previous reviewer's tip to oil the peppers was very helpful. I used a combo of goat chevre and muenster cheese. I boiled the shrimp in bay leaves, salt, oregano and thyme. I made more stuffing than the recipe called for as other reviewers have suggested, too. This dish was worth the time and effort. Absolutely delicious. I will definitely make this again.

Thank you Portland Oregon. I wanted to serve a red wine with this dish and finally chose a nebbiolo (Il Nebbio) from Italy. It was a good choice. It was tough for me to choose a red with this dish. We'll make this again. It was a beautiful plate presentation and tasted great! Lots of compliments. We added lobster, otherwise followed the rest of the recipe. Try this one, you won't be disappointed.

To Buck County - I served a Pino Gris with this dish. It complemented the heat in the chilies. I roasted the chilies outside on the grill so I could do them in one fell swoop. The red pepper sauce was good but I prefer a red pepper sauce make with whip cream instead of broth. All in all - an excellent dish that is fun to make.

This was easy and fairly quick to prepare and the best part is that it can be made ahead for a dinner party. Great combination of flavors. I served this with rice and black beans which made a pretty presentation for a light, casual meal, but I agree with others that it would also make a great first course on it's own as part of a larger menu. Will absolutely make again--would probably work great with crab or even chicken too.

YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM!!!!!! My husband and I can't get over how good this was. I didn't change anything except I used chihauhau cheese instead of the others suggested and it was PERFECT, held together and melted well. The goat cheese makes this dish, and I was really surprised how the stuffing was able to hold the peppers together because they were falling apart when I was trying to seed them. Like another review suggested I would probably roast them just slightly less to avoid that next time. Also, I cheated and used jarred red peppers for the sauce (drained really well) and it was still perfect!!! saved a lot of time. We used this as a side dish for grilled lamb chops seasoned with Emeril's essence and a little cumin, they were the perfect combination and looked nice on the plate with the red pepper sauce underneath alongside the poblanos. We will make this again and again!

I've made this recipe 3 times now. It is exquisite. The combination of flavors is an experience to savor. When roasted the poblanos are not spicy. The red pepper sauce has a bit of zing but nothing you could call heat. It is an effort though well worth it. It's a better appetizer - a rich, large morsel of smokey heaven!

OK! i tried this one again after having a helluva time with roasting the peppers and with panela cheese being a poor choice because of its quality of not melting. maybe it's because we just bought a house with a gas stove, but i had no problem roasting the peppers this time and they stayed whole and everything. i used Oaxaca cheese which melts wonderfully. and i actually made the sauce this time even though i am a hater of bell pepper for some strange reason. the sauce needs a second try, because i only had one (gigantic) red bell, and i don't think it was enough. and i just realized i screwed up by not cooking the shrimp before adding it to the filling, but it turned out just fine. the stuffed peppers were outstanding, the oaxaca did a great job of binding the filling together. piled the peppers and sauce on top of brown rice. Delish!!!

Made this for a Gourmet Club and it was delicious!! EVERYONE cleaned their plates. The consensus among the group was that it was different but had just enough of a kick. We thought the red bell pepper sauce was the aspect of the dish that had the kick not the poblanos. If you are worried about the spicy aspect of this dish cut out or reduce the jalapenos that are added to the red bell pepper sauce.

Overall a wonderful recipe. Make sure your guests are all spicy food freaks as the poblanos have a quite a kick, even for my Arizona palate. Try cooking the shrimp in Zatarain's Crab Boil, yummy. I doubled all ingredients for 11 chilies and had a bit of filling left over but could have used more red bell pepper sauce.

I used 4 large peppers, and the mixture just barely filled them. Although I used very large peppers, I would double this mixture for this recipe. We loved it! The sauce is bland on its own, but when coupled with the stuffed pepper, it is complete. I marinated the shrimp with garlic, olive oil, and fresh orange juice 2 hours before cooking. I also used Monterey Jack and Feta... I will make this again as soon as my Bubbles lets me.

I love this recipe! It's not as hard or time consuming as it sounds, especially if you broil the red peppers for the sauce at the same time as the poblanos. In fact, it has become a main-course "staple" in our home. But like other reviewerss, I use a lot more shrimp and really stuff the poblanos chock full of the stuffing. Served with rice and a salad, and a bit of cilantro or basil garnish and it makes a perfect, elegant meal.

I used more shrimp and left them in 1/2 inch size pieces. When making the bell pepper sauce I used about 1/2 cup of chicken stock, which gave the sauce a bit more consistency. I used a orange peeper instead of red in the stuffing to give it more color. Everyone raved about this recipe. Aloha

I thought the 2 tablespoons of basil completely overpowered the other flavors, and the shrimp in particular was almost impossible to detect. I used goat and oaxaca cheeses. I might make it again, but I'd take the herbs down to teaspoon levels so that the shrimp has a fighting chance. Maybe add other seafood.

This was wonderful. I made sure the red bell pepper sauce was spicy. Also, it's a little work taking the seeds out of the poblano but I just rinsed them with water and made sure they were dry before stuffing them. Additionally, it doesn't matter if the poblanos are not perfect when you stuff them, the cheese filling doesn't melt out of the pepper. They really turn out just perfect. This recipe is spicy but fabulous. Enjoy!!

I have just made this for the 4th time, we just love it. Every time I'v made these I used a different method to prepare the chilis. This last time was the easiest, thank you cook from Mexico. Yes, the oil is key and I used the broiler. They only need to blister, my smaller chilis were a bit overdone, but the larger ones were firmer. I love this website, because you get some helpful hints from the reviewers. What I don't like are the reviews that trash a recipe and did not follow the recipe or people who review without trying it.

I made this recipe for a first course and thought that it was wonderful. I made the recipe exactly, without substitutions. And I would highly reccommend that everyone try it. I garnished the plate with a few whole cooked shrimp and a piece of basil. Everyone loved it and it was the show stopper of the evening!

This was so delicious. I added a bit of chili powder to the shrimp to give it some extra zip. I also had no trouble peeling the poblanos, but the way I do it is to put it in a tightly wrapped paper bag for about 10 minutes. What I DID have problems with was seeding the things. But after all that, I did not like the taste of the poblanos - they were too bitter and overpowering. The shrimp mixture was delicious though, and even more delicious mixed with mexican style rice. I think next time I will mix the shrimp and cheese mixture with rice and stuff it into red bell pepper halves. YUM!

This recipe was fantastic. So good I made it 2x! Only issue was the chiles. I found that "blackening" them as u would a bell pepper made them break apart. I kept a better eye on them the 2nd time and they were firmer which equaled more spice and I was able to trully stuff them. The 2nd time I added a little rice to make them a bit more hearty for a main dish.

This was wonderful! A definite keeper. I used oaxaca, goat and a little shredded jack cheese. I had enough to stuff 6 peppers, not 8, but they were large. To the sauce I added the juice of half a lemon and some half and half. Delicious! This dish makes an impressive display and will earn wows with guests.

Ok, I'll jump into the poblano controversy. This is the way that Mexicans peel poblanos: spread a thin film of vegetable oil over each chile with your fingers. Roast them until black over an open flame (or the broiler if you must, but it's easier on the stove). Place the chiles in a tea towel, THEN into a plastic bag so that the the chiles don't come in contact with the plastic, yet benefit from the steam produced. Leave them about 15 minutes, then peel under running water. The oil is key here, folks. It will make the chiles blister more evenly and you won't have to steam the chiles as long to get the skins off, making it easier to stuff them later if they're not so cooked. You can also do a lot of them and freeze them for later use, I do it all the time. It's easier to make just one mess instead of several.

Very flavorfull dish. The peppers took a while to charr. The effort was worth it for the taste was great. Used jack cheese. It was a good combination with the shrimp. The sauce was very good and was a good balance with the stuffed pepper. Will make again as such a pretty presentation.

This was a very cool first course--showy and flavorful. Our only problem: the cheese filling barely filled 6 peppers (fortunately that's all we needed!) and would have been way too skimpy for 8. As to the person suggesting placing the peppers in plastic instead of paper: please remember, many plastic bags release toxins when heated!!

This was good, but not spectacular. I followed the recipe as written and while the presentation is very nice, this dish just didn't pack the mouthful of flavor I was expecting. The red bell pepper sauce was very good, however. If I make this again, I would serve as a hot hors d'oeuvre rather than as the main dish.

Rating: 4
To the cook from Montecito, Ca. Unfortunately, there really is no EASY way to prep the chiles. A few tips that might help though. Make sure you really get the chiles blackened and blistered, then place in a PLASTIC, not paper bag for about 20 mins. Plastic helps create more steam to loosen those stubborn peels. You could also place the chiles in the broiler or on the grill instead of roasting them over the flame. As far as the red bells, you can usually buy these already roasted, in jars, for a few less peppers to prep. As far as removing the seeds, you can carefully cut a slit in one side of the peppers and gently remove the bulk of them with your fingers. Most of them are around the stem end. Any others can be gently rinsed out with cool water. Be sure to dry the peppers inside and out if you rinse them though. Hope this helps.

This dish was EXCELLENT. We served it at a dinner party and found it was beautiful plated atop the sauce AND delicious!

She knew which was hers and loved it! We WILL make this dish again ... and often!
