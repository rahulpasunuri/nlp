It was ok but I think it was a little bland. I wound up using my immersion blender to thicken it up but I think maybe if I had used some chicken broth or something to give it more flavor it would have been better. I added some roasted garlic butter and that helped. I would make it again but use some chicken broth as water for the corn stock.

absolutely scrumptious!!!! I loved it. It was so easy to make and didn't take very long. Next time, I will cut out the parsley. It was overpowering in my taste.

Very simple,and very good. I added diced pattypan squash, as I had them on hand, and added a few spoonfuls of creme fraiche as well as the milk. You do need to seriously adjust salt/pepper to your taste, but I found this to be a lovely light soup with elemental corn flavour. I'd make it again.

It was... okay. I was expecting better based on reviews, but I really didn't find it anything to write home about. Good, but not GOOD! or great.

I thought this was a tasty recipe and very easy to make. Because I have two very picky little eaters I decided to use an immersion blender before adding the corn. I blended everything until it was completely smooth than added the corn and heavy cream (only a few tablespoons) Simmered for an additional 15 minutes. Will definitely make this again.

Finally remembered to use the corn cob stock. Third time making this recipe. It's just wonderful, and at 60 calories per serving. I love it with a tablespoon of tarragon. Terrific. Terrific.

Delicious and easy recipe! I love the idea for the corn stock. I made a few modicications by way of adding a mirepoix and I also used an immersion blender to thicken the soup before I added the corn and milk. SO tasty!!

My mom is on a low starch diet so I used sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes and the color and taste was jusT phenomenal. Also, didn't use the tomatoes cause of allergies, but that orange was just so gorgeous in it. I thicken it a little because the milk just doesn't do quite enough to bring it to the consistency of chowder. Love this recipe and am in the middle of making it for the second time! Definitely pan on making this again.

This is a great recipe. Easily adaptable, and the corn cob stock is genius. I replaced half of the water with low-salt chicken broth and used heavy whipping cream instead of milk. I don't know what all the blending/pureeing is about- with fresh summer corn you want every kernel whole and sweet, not mushy.

Yumm - a few additions made this even better for me. I used chicken broth in place of half the water when boiling the cobs, plus a bay leaf and a piece of celery to give a little extra flavor. Also added 2 cloves of chopped garlic while sauteing the onions and potatoes. Then I used my hand blender just before serving to partially puree the soup. Yumm yumm.

Very good and pretty simple. My changes: Took my three medium cobs out of the pot and put the potatoes and onions in the corn water. Added about one cup of chicken stock to the four cups of water. Used a immersion blender to smooth it out before adding corn and milk. Topped ours with bacon and fresh basil but it would also be good with a pistou or pesto. Really good!

So quick! Forgot to save the water from the cobs so used some homemade chicken stock instead. Used nice cherry tomatoes cut in half. For a deeper flavor profile, I dashed it with some Penzey Four Spice and smoked paprika. Quick buzz with the stick kept the chunky texture but added a little thickness. I freeze in one cup servings to take for an enviable lunch.
