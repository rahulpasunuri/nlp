The review below should have been 4 forks, not three.

My 6-yr.-old grandson checked the "Star Wars Cookbook" out from his school library, but the page for this recipe had been torn out of the book. I found it, thank goodness, on epicurious.com and he and I made it for the rest of the family the other night. While I chopped the onion and measured ingredients, he held the strainer while I poured the beans into it, and then he tipped the beans into a bowl. He then helped by pouring the tomatoes into the pan (with supervision), and helped put the beans in the pan. I did most of the stirring, but he had a great sense of accomplishment. I didn't use tomato juice, since the sodium content is so high; instead, used a low sodium veggie juice, and it was just fine, thank you. I served the chili in bread bowls (except for my portion) made from thawed and formed bread dough. The whole family raved about the dish. As usual, however, there were a few suggestions. First, lean meat e.g., beef, chicken or turkey, could be browned and added (definitely, a nice idea, but not necessary if you don't want to). More onion (unfortunately, I had only one onion in the house, and I was doubling the recipe, so this suggestion was definitely valid.) More salt. I am on a low-salt diet and we had purchased low sodium, organic beans, leaving it up to everyone at the table to add his or her salt. Since canned beans are usually salty, you probably won't need to add any. I used the leftover chili in a pseudo-Mexican- style salad for lunch the next day. I am on Weight Watchers and, depending on how much you want to eat, you'll probably use up 4-6 points of your daily point count.

I don't understand why people complain that this is unhealthy - I'm doing the South Beach Diet and this is Phase 1 friendly, which is amazing since almost all recipes contain kinds of fat or carbohydrates that are not allowed. Sure, it's not stir-fried veggies, but the only fat in the recipe is the olive oil. Beans are among the top antioxidants available, they have a low GI and are high in fibre - and no fat.

This is a fabulous meat-free chili recipe. It's simple, quick, and a great meal with enough left over for lunch. It gave my kids a great confidence boost to be able to do most of the work themselves. Just be sure to supervise! We had a blast making the chili and the Wookie Cookies.

The most lickly reason I didnot like it and my friends did not like it is because it is too spicy

I enjoyed this recipe. My husband ate it and liked it as well. To the person above. In case you didn't read the first page, the cookbook is obviously for kids.

My kids loved making this receipe. I was thrilled healthy food they made themselves AND they ate. We bought the cookbook. Great receipes for children to make and they loved the pictures and little stories that go with the receipes.

Here's substitutions to make it more healthy: look at the labels and buy "no salt added" cans only. Rinse all the beans before use. Cut oil to 1 TBSP. Use low-sodium V-8 instead of tomato juice. Purchase low-fat cheddar and fat-free sour cream or fat-free plain yogurt. Does the author think the audience for this cookbook is 6 year olds or just mentally-impaired adults? All three sample recipes seem patronizing, plus unhealthy.
