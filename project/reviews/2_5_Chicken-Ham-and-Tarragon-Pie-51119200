Tried this the other night - a cold, rainy one, so I thought it would be perfect. So much trouble - and the results were not as good as I would have expected. I did follow the recipe exactly, but felt that the chicken and sauce were both not flavourful, and the vegetables were overcooked by the time the pie came out of the oven. I won't make it again.

The fresh tarragon makes this dish sing - don't be tempted to use dry in its place. Very tasty but VERY time consuming. It took about 4.5 hours start to finish (with one of the pies still in the oven). The time estimates for each step except cooking the chicken are way too low. Definitely a good make-ahead. It makes one thankful for a TV in the kitchen. Needed 2.5 quarts of liquid to cover the chicken and veggies, so I doubled the wine and added water to get the extra 2 cups. Glad I did - the wine flavor didn't get lost, as another review noted. NOTE that each small bottle of those four-packs of wine that come in cardboard carriers will yield the needed 3/4 cup + 1 tablespoon. Also threw in another dash of dried tarragon and 4 garlic cloves instead of 2 (this much chicken can handle more). Used 8 drumsticks and 2 split breasts as my husband likes white meat more than dark, so a good compromise. Worked out fine. Instead of the ham I used 4 Yukon Gold potatoes, ~3" diameter. Small cubes, unpeeled, in microwave until soft but not mushy (6 minutes in mine) and then stirred them into the final chicken mixture. Because what's a pot pie without potatoes? If you make this substitution you need more salt, but go easy. Next time will try the ham version but keep the potatoes so the yield will be even higher. Will also add more stock than the 3.5 cups as we like more gravy in our pies. This made three 4.5" pies and one oval 10" pie, with lots of delicious stock left over.

In the UK, puff pastry is sold in 500g (roughly a pound) packs in most supermarkets. I'm sure this is what the recipe means.

What is "1/2 quantity of Chicken with White Wine and Herbs" and where do you buy it? I have never seen an 18oz pkg of all-butter puff pastry in my store's refrigerated section, but I will look for it. It looks like an interesting recipe but where do we get the ingredients!
