i agree with the other reviewer. we made this recipe exactly as written and it came out with a bread pudding-like texture, nothing like flan! yuck!

I followed the recipe exactly as written, but for some reason the flans came out very cakey and chewey. None of my guests could finish it, including me. This was a flop. Did I do something wrong?
