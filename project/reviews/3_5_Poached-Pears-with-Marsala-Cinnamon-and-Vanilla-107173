This is almost identical to Martha Stewart's poached pear recipe, which is delicious! Only difference is to substitute a cabernet sauvignon for the marsala wine. Marsala is way too sweet, as many have already posted, to be combined with the amount of sugar in this recipe.

These were great, wonderful flavour and incredible smell in the house. Very simple to make and yet seemed to impress the dinner guests! Made to the recipe except with vanilla essence for cost's sake. I served with a quenelle of mascarpone, some blueberries and a sprinkle of caramelised flaked almonds, which added a toasted nuttiness and crunch which worked beautifully as a foil to the softer textures. I'd really recommend them as an accompaniment; just toast a couple of handfuls of flaked almonds in a dry pan until they start to brown, then add a tablespoon or so of sugar and stir vigorously. They will caramelise pretty quickly, when they look done just spread them on a sheet of baking paper and leave to cool, then sprinkle onto the mascarpone quenelle. Delicious!

I make this several times each winter, and find this an excellent recipe as long as you reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup. I also core the pears with a melon baller before poaching, and stuff them with candied ginger soaked in the poaching liquid, or even better, Trader Joe's chocolate covered ginger.

My husband begs me for this dessert...guests lick the dish...cut back on sugar also but made sure the sauce really reduced. Used the Mascarpone Cream on this site as an accompaniment. My mouth still waters just thinking about them. The room will go silent as they eat this one.

A cook from Napervillle IL First, I don't understand how so many cooks substitute ingredients with abandon and have the nerve to write a review. Pleaes, stop! I've made this recipe several times and reduce the sugar by half as was suggested by many who made it. I also incorporated a change which I think some may find helpful. After I peeled the pears I made deep vertical slits every 3/4 inch or so, taking care not to slice pieces off. These slits helped the cooking liquid to penetrate the pear more deeply. These pears are a nice Thanksgiving dessert, too.

I made it as is and it was delicious! My only complaint would be that I don't think the flavor warranted the price, but if money wasn't an issue, I'd definitely make it again.

Great recipe. I did follow fellow reviewers' suggestions to cut the sugar by half. Used bosc pears, which held their shape and firmness well, and absorbed the flavors beautifully.

All in all, this is a good recipe but it's definitely TOO SWEET. Next time I'd cut the sugar to at least 1/2 cup, possibly less. I made a few other changes that worked: used 1 cup chianti, 1 cup dry sparking white (both leftover from dinner the night before), ground cinnamon, vanilla extract, and lots of orange peel. I cut the pears in half and cored them with a melon baller and cut the bottoms flat so the pears can stand up. They also cook quicker this way (about half the time). For the mascarpone, I added some cinnamon and a touch of vanilla yogurt (actually I used some actimel plain yogurt drink) to make it thinner and easier to work with. To serve, I filled one pear half with the mascarpone mixture and then placed the other half to close it. Served the pears standing up, with the sauce over it, the mascarpone a hidden surprise inside!

Very good! I halved the syrup ingredients and used 1 bartlett and 1 red pear. Had never poached a pear before but these turned out great. Since I was on the spur of the moment, no mascarpone cheese, so I mixed up a couple TB of cream cheese with a little sour cream and heavy cream and used it for dollops.. Wow.. definetly make again.

I've made this several times for family and friends..everyone loved it..especially served warm with alittle scoop of cinammon ice cream on the side. Heavenly

After reading the previous reviews, I was expecting a lot more out of this dish. It ended up tasting too similar to apple pie filling. Not bad, but not great. The mascarpone complements the pears nicely.

This was really good and made my house smell wonderful! It was also incredibly easy. I have had bad luck poaching pears in the past, so I cut them in half and cored them to make sure that they cooked all the way through (which they did). They were REALLY sweet - half a pear was enough. It would have been really good with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream too.

So outstanding--we couldn't get enough. Definitely a keeper. Easy, too.

Excellent, but a bit too sweet. I'd add less sugar next time. Also, the flavors didn't totally penetrate like the pears I've had at restaurants. Maybe cook a bit longer and halve the pears?

This was AMAZING!! It's the perfect dish to have cooking on your stove on a chilly, rainy, early spring day! It smelled SO good, and tasted even better. I recommend serving it closer to room temperature than straight out of the fridge. You should try this one! Great presentation for guests.

Made this the first time for Christmas dinner. It was a perfect dessert after a heavy meal--light and delicious and elegant. The added bonus is how your house smells--vanilla, cinnamon and wine. We just made it again for a dinner party with a couple extras for leftovers.

I thought this was a very elegant dessert. I served cheeses between main course and dessert so I omitted the marscapone. The dinner guests truly enjoyed it.

Well, I only had three pears, so I threw in a couple of apples. I only had zinfandel and merlot so I used cup each, and I had no vanilla bean so I used a splash of vanilla extract. I still thought it was delicious with all of those compromises.

God made pears so they could be prepared this way and eaten with mascarpone cheese. I'm making this again.

My husband and I think this dish is great. It didn't seem too sweet for us, but we made sure to get dry Marsala and not sweet. We used Bosc pears and they were perfect as well. The mascarpone cheese added much to the dish, but was especially nice because its texture complemented that of the pears.

To join the madness: Actually, question marks do not go inside the quotation marks, unless they actually belong to a quote (for instance, when you're quoting a question). Same with exclamation points. At least according to MLA/Chicago style. Whoo-hoo, what fun!

To the cook from Pennsylvania: punctuation belongs inside the quotation marks. It is best not to criticize others when your own house is not in order.

I actually used a little more orange peel and a little less sugar. I cooked on high heat and thus reduced to a perfect syrup in no time. I did not like the taste of Marscapone so used some homemade whipped creme instead. My boys (triplets age 8) loved these for breakfast the next day after sitting in the frig all night. Be sure to use first grade ingrediants (good mexican cinnamon, vanilla, etc) and especially marsala. Not the cheap stuff at the market for $2.99 a bottle. This makes all the difference in a quality end product.

Hey Jonathan from Boston- I can see how the recipe might taste mediciny sweet... Since I was making this for two people, I cut the recipe right in half. I used less than half of half the sugar since pears and marsala both have sugar in them and I prefer to err on the lightly sweet side myself. You have to try it again! The mascarpone is fantastic with the pears, and the syrup so fragrant with the vanilla!! I'm making this for T-Day dinner.

These pears were a hit! Everyone wanted seconds. The first time I didn't have vanilla or oranges, so I used almond extract and lemon peel. The second time around I tried the vanilla and orange. Both turned out fantastic. Once the pears were finished cooking, I also halved them. The mascarpone adds a delicious texture and flavor. Simple and original, I will definitely make these again!

To the cook from Walla Walla. . .why would you put an apostrophe on "ones"?

Decent but I would definately cut down on the sugar to a maximum of half a cup.

To the cook from Walla Walla: You can't use canned pears. They're already cooked. You might say they're a very simple version of this recipe.

I like pears. I like Marsala. I used real vanilla, real cinnamon sticks, and a good Marsala, and I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out medicine-sweet. Not horrifically bad...my girlfriend and I decided that we would eat them eventually...and very easy, but not good enough to justify the price of the ingredients.

I have been making a similar dish for years but I don't cook the pears that long plus I halve them. I bring my syrup (Marsala w/ no water) to a boil, place the pears face down, cover and remove from heat. I let them sit until room temp and then chill. And I usually use anything but bosch. They are soft but not mushy. Am I missing something?

To the cook from Walla Walla, why would you want to use can pears for this recipe???? They would fall apart, as they are not firm like a Bosc or Anjou...Take the time and use fresh pears.

My guests raved!!!! This is the best, easiest and most elegant company dessert. I served it with vanilla ice cream vice the marscapone. It took alot longer then the recipe stated for the sauce to reduce down to a thick syrup. An added bonus of this recipe is it makes your house smell great with the cinnamon and vanilla.
