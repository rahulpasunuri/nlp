Disappointing! I was excited about this recipe because there were a combination of ingredients you don't' normally see together. It sounded delicious. It did not taste delicious though. I made it to bring to a family dinner but ended up not using it. I would have been embarassed to serve it.

I didn't have bay leaves, but this recipe was delicious nonetheless. I added some extra chili powder to give it a kick, and served it up with rye bread (which worked wonderfully with the flavors in the stew). I also stirred the garlic paste into the stew, as I wasn't sure quite what to do with it. It made for a warm, hearty meal. The good thing about this recipe is that is calls for simple ingredients that I frequently have on hand. If I found myself with these ingredients lying around and nothing else planned for dinner, I might make this again. However, I probably won't go out of my way to do so.

Simple and good over rice. I followed the recipe and served garlic on the side - everyone loved it

Given how many interesting ingredients are in this recipe, this was a real disappointment. It is easy to make and smelled good while cooking but the sauce tasted unremarkable.

I thought this was very nice...I will admit I did not do the whole head of garlic thang, but I did throw a couple of minced cloves into the mix. The sauce was a bit sweet - almost had a hint of cinnamon taste to it. I served it with egg noodles.

This was so simple to make and very yummy! My young children devoured it!! The only changes I made were to remove the skin from the chicken and use bacon fat to sear the chicken. It seemed like a lot of onions to use, but they really created the flavour for the sauce.
