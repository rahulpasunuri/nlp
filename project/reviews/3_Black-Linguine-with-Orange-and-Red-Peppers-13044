I have never tryied to make this dish, but i bought yesterday the black linguini from a local store, so i found out this recipe. Sounds tasty, but as the cook from LA, CA said, this dish needs some protein! I' ll try it with dry cretan anthotyros and was thinking to add some shrimp - clam coctail. Will try it soon and I'll rate!

In one word...YUCK! I tried this recipe for as halloween party, first time using squid ink pasta, although very pretty, it was inedible no one ate it..... an embarrasment! the pasta was horrid, I had to order it online gave the rest away it was so nasty.

Made a few modifications which made this fabulous! I added more garlic, touch of cream and parmesan. I know, that would make anything better but it was great. Also, very important....I feel for this dish to work it needs a protein with it. I pounded 2 chicken breasts and lightly floured them, sauteed and then sliced them up and served on top. Made all the difference to have a piece of chicken in every bite cause when I ate the leftovers with no chicken. Wasn't quite the same. Will be making for Halloween dinner for sure!!!

Hey, I'm from Ann Arbor too, and agree with A Cook. This dish looked perfect on my Halloween table, the colors are great, but flavor is lacking.

A good weeknight recipe, but it definitely needs more taste--I added lots more hot pepper, garlic, and some parmesan.

I used orange bell peppers, thin spaghetti, and an inordinate amount of garlic and hot red pepper because my family and I can certainly take a lot of heat. Used homemade beef stock in lieu of water/chicken broth and I think that makes all the difference (not so much the wine...I just used the two buck chuck white I had from Trader Joe's!). Delicious and very, very easy.

This was an awesome Halloween dinner party dish. So easy to prepare the peppers ahead. We marinated large prawns (using the Garlic and Rosemary Shrimp from this site) and grilled them on skewers and laid them across the top of the pasta & peppers. I found the pasta at World Market. Kids ate it the next day and loved it too!

I couldnt find black linguine or squid ink, but im sure that didnt change the taste. Wonderful dish and even better with more hot peppers for the hot and spicy lovers!

I served with the braised spare ribs and wow! Fantastic! I would definitely make this again, maybe adding some shrimp or chicken to serve alone. For those who said it was too soupy, I allowed it to reduce on medium high until the sauce was at a thick enough consistency for what I wanted. Just turn up the heat if it's too soupy :)

A good dish any time of year, all the more fun come Halloween.

I made this for Halloween, though using black penne instead of linguine and adding shrimp. The flavor was good, but I think all the water detracted a bit and made it kind of soupy. Next time I'll omit the broth/water, keep the wine, and double the olive oil to make it more like a pepperoncino.

I made this last night and it was quite good, with the addition of an additional clove of garlic, chopped basil, and a healthy handful of parmesan. I found dried squid ink spaghetti at Dean & Deluca.

If you live in San Francisco, I found the squid ink pasta at AG Ferrari Foods on Castro St.

This is an easy recipe and tastes great. It also makes a fun presentation for the Halloween season. I will work on any kind of pasta if you can't find black squid ink linguine.

I thought it was a lot of fun and plan to make it on Halloween night. I loved the idea of goat cheese so I will add that. For those of you who have had a hard time finding black pasta I have a couple of tips! Here in the Bay Area I found it dried at Draeger's (www.draegers.com) and at Cost Plus. I ordered it fresh last year from a site called Fresh Pasta (www.freshpasta.com). By the way, I ordered quite a bit from them and have L O V E D it all!!!! Happy Halloween!!!

This will be my 3rd year making this dish for Halloween dinner (along w/ mini pumpkin soup). I was going to make something else I thought would be a little more kid friendly, but my kids specifically requested it this year -- almost a month in advance. I usually purchase squid ink linguine at ethnicgrocer.com, but they've been sold out for over a week.

I have made this before and will probably always use it in my Halloween dinners. I have only made one change from the recipe. I dot the finished plates with a fresh goat cheese. I found the pepper mixture alone had very nice flavor. I made the mixutre earlier in the afternoon and the flavors had a chance to blend. BTW - Here in Seattle, I can buy squid ink pasta only at a few specialty shops - Pasta & Co., and DeLaurenti's. The pasta is available dried so Italian markets may sell it. I am unsure if Whole Foods has it.

I made this using fresh spinach linguine for my parents and we really liked it. Since my father is on a low-sodium diet, I used organic chicken broth because it has less sodium than Campbell's. This recipe is nice to have because it's hard to find good recipes for things that he can eat. I will probably try sauteeing some fresh sliced chanterelle mushrooms with it next time, and the idea of adding goat cheesewas intriguing too. I would try it again with a variety of pastas. Anyone know where one can get squid ink pasta in San Francisco without having to call every gourmet market in the city?

I love the visual impact of black linguine and the red/orange peppers. I would probably add more spices (basil, oregeno, etc). The sauce works with any type of pasta, of course.

I couldn't find any black linguine for this receipe, but it turned out great using regular linguine! Use regular linguine and you don't have to wait until Halloween for this receipe.

I served this to a retirement community Halloween Party and 95% of the residents loved it and the next day I had to publish the recipe in the newsletter. I did add a lot of parm. cheese to it. Personally I would use basil or other favorite herb in the recipe but it certainly was a hit. Really wonderfull visual presentation.

A good recipe for Halloween, as it is visually very striking, but it was a little bland - I probably wouldn't bother at any other time of year.

This was good for the Halloween dinner party I had, but I wouldn't make it for any other occasion. I was running out of time an just made cooked the black linguine and served it with tomato sauce and grated parmesan cheese. This makes it SUPER easy while still giving a ghoulish effect. Serve it with the pumpkin spice dinner rolls.

The dish looks scary enough for a Halloween party, but it's delicious at any time. I was surprised at how flavorful it was, as well as how easy it was to prepare.

A delicious and easy make-ahead dish for an adult Halloween get together. I've made it a number of times with as a first course with an entree of Braised Short Ribs and Potato Ghosts. Gourmet's October 1995 issue has the full menu which includes Witches' Brew and Poppy Cheddar Moon Crackers as appetizers and Devil's Food Cake with Spider Web for dessert. Everything was delicious and not too difficult to make.
