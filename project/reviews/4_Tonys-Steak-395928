I made this when it first was posted and keep making it over and over again - so I figured it was time to give it the 4 forks it deserves. I am making it to bring on our camping trip (2nd time doing that) and it always gets big aaahh's......

this is great. Very easy to make and delicious. I added a 1" piece of ginger and up the garlic. I put it under the broiler for 6 minutes per side per recipe. it came out perfect medium rare. it tastes like korean bulgogi to me. YUM!

Excellent! Easy to prepare. I actually only marinated it for aproximately 4 hours. I did use the FOODSAVER to marinate it for half an hour. It was perfect grilling 3 minutes each side.

This is a wonderful recipe for two reasons: It's easy and it's delicious! Great recipe for entertaining as everything can be done ahead of time. Debra

We marinaded a "London Broil" type steak and BBQ'd it for a dinner party. It is similar to one of my mother's marinades, but the addition of sesame oil is divine! Our guests loved it, and the leftovers were delicious cold with salad for lunch the next day. Will definitely make it again.

I made this according to the recipe and have this suggestion: Retain the marinade, strain it and bring to a boil; add a little beef stock and reduce a bit for an easy "gravy" that works well on the beef and rice that I happened to make to go with it. The flank steak is a bit chewy, but if you let it rest and cut it very thin across the grain, it has a great flavor.

I would have to give this 4 forks for what it is--a healthy, fast marinated steak. We loved it--used a flat iron instead of flank, which worked well.

I followed this recipe exactly and was really disappointed with the result. Flank steak is not a particularly good cut of meat for barbecuing and unfortunately this recipe didn't do anything to change that. The steak came out dry and tough despite the 12-hour marinading time. I'll stick with braising flank steak from now on.

Question: when you say "refrigerate overnight" in the marinade, do you mean for 24 hours? or for 12 hrs? Seems quite a big difference; would not want to ruin texture of meat by marinating for too long. Pleae advise.

With the addition of sesame seeds, this is Pui-go-ki (Korean steak). Been making this for so many years that there were not "zips" on the top of baggies, just twist ties.

I made this as written for father's day and everyone loved it.

I made this for my husband and son and had an empty serving plate when I was done. They loved it, and so did I. This will be a go to quick meal for us.

This recipe is almost identical to an old Gourmet magazine recipe printed in the "You Asked For It" column for a grilled "Oriental" flank steak which I have been using for many years. It was good then and it's still good now.

Just made this exactly as written. It was delicious and I would definitely make it again. The combination of ingredients worked very well together.
