This is a great recipe, and I found along with the other tips that using a grill skewer or pencil to wrap up the tuile in a nice small tube. Also you can do it right from the Sil Pat or pan and it goes quicker.

First of all, a big thank you to previous reviewers who recommended waiting a moment before removing these from the cookie sheet. If I hadn't have read that, this recipe would have driven me nuts. These turned out very pretty and as others mentioned, they would lend themselves to a variety of shapes/vessels that would make pretty desserts. I made these for the ginger ice cream and the combination is dynamite.

These are indeed delicate and paper thin...and they are very easy and quick to make once you learn the secret: The first time I tried these, they wrinkled up horribly when I tried to remove them from the cookie sheet. BUT if you let them cool a bit, you can just lift up an edge with a pointed knife and lift them off with your fingers. A little practice, and you'll be confident and have wonderful little vehicles for special ice cream, sorbet or light puddings...another thing to do is to put them into cups or ramekins to cool...try to get a flat bottom, so they will stand up...then you will have another shape to put delicacies in...like raspberries and whipped cream! This is a very easy and basic recipe that will amaze your friends. I make it all the time.

These came out great for me. My fiance loved them. I botched the first batch, but after that I got the hang of it. I'm going to try making another batch this week in the shape of leaves (pouring the batter into a metal cookie cutter and putting it all the oven) to decorate a cake. I might even add a bit of food coloring. Anyway, should be interesting to see how it comes out.

I think of tuiles as having a little thickness in the middle. These are paper thin and fragile -- more like brandy snaps or lace cookies. Aside from this, I found the nutmeg taste to be overwhelming.

I am always wary of foods I cannot pronouce, but these were pretty easy and a good addition to the caramel nut tart recipe.

This was a good one. I misread the recipe and used 1/2 cup of butter instead of 1/4. so I had to start again. Then I decided to adjust the first batch but the brown sugar ineeded to add with the other ingredients wasnt dissolved first, and this resulted in even better looking lacy tuiles . You do need to let the tuiles cool off before you attempt to remove them from the cookie sheet and I also cooked them on the non-stick liners you can now buy in cooking shops.
