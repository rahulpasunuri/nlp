This dish is low in fat, representing just 28% of kilojoules. I'd say that's margin enough (the recommended average is 30-35%) to use a light spray of oil over the crumbed breasts to get a more 'fried' flavour and texture. You could reduce the oil in the parsley salad to compensate, if you felt like it.

While I can't give a completely proper review because I didn't top with the parsley salad, my whole family felt that the chicken was very blah. Not much flavor. I sliced leftovers and had it over a salad and that was ok, but alone it's nothing real special. Guess we just like lots of flavor in this family. Some people may well be delighted with this recipe.

This is a good, low-fat alternative to fried chicken. I didn't think it was possible, but it is! I skipped the parsley-caper salad because I was just after the "fried" chicken taste. Agree on keeping an eye on the time baked - 40 mins is probably too long. I baked whole breasts and set the timer for 30 mins and that was sufficient. Also added mustard powder to the spice mix.

Good, basic recipe but 40 minutes is too long to bake the chicken! Even with the breading it still got dried out inside. Next time I'll only do it for 30. The salad/garnish was just so-so... instead add more spices to the cornflake crumbs and maybe serve the chicken breasts sliced on on the diagonal on top of a lightly dressed green or spinach salad.

Thought it was delicious, very easy to make and have the ingredients already in the house!!

Prepared the chicken, but not the salad to garnish with it. Instead I sauteed mushrooms with the flat cilanto and served with corn on the cob. I thought the chicken was wonderful, just the perfect amount of spice with the cornflakes. Worth making!
