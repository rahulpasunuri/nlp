This was okay. Not bad... but pretty much a waste of fine ingredients. I used four bunches of kale which is not cheap. The results were fine, but not anybody's favorite dish. Just pretty mushy and reminiscent of baby food. I found that following the recipe exactly except for using extra salt and pepper was enough seasoning... the flavor was nice actually. However, I will not make this again just because no one was wild about it and no one wanted to take any of the leftovers.

Properly seasoned this is a great side dish. After reading the reviews I made two changes: I used part chicken stock, part water to cook the kale and I used only half the amount of cream specified to cook the potatoes. Because pureeing potatoes in the food processor is a bad idea, I mashed the potatoes in the pan with a manual masher then stirred in the pureed kale. The texture was good-not too runny and we both liked the dish.

I'm not rating this because I changed it so much, but I was happy with the results, so I thought I'd share. I was only making enough for me and my boyfriend, so I cut up and boiled two red potatoes leaving the skins and sauteed half a bunch of kale with olive oil and 3 cloves of minced garlic. After draining the soft potatoes, I pureed both together with some Mexican chicken broth I had bought on a whim and added fresh ground sea salt and coarse pepper. Then I mixed in some Parmesan cheese. I did add a bit too much liquid, so it was looser than I wanted, but it tasted great and took no time to make!

This dish is FANTASTIC. I think most seasoned cooks understand that you need to salt/pepper your food according to taste, so as long as you know the basics of adding salt... the finished product is to die for. I made it for Christmas a few years ago and have made it over and over again ever since.

I love kale and have cooked it a number of great ways but this is not one of them for me. It came out goopy and bland (a common complaint). I keep thinking I'll eat it but it's just sitting in my fridge. bummer.

I was ready to LOVE this recipe, but what a waste of fine ingredients! I can't believe the gruel that resulted. Even with the addition of butter and Parmesan, hand mashing the potatoes, and using every tip in the reviews this turned out a bland yuck that even a baby would spit out. I managed to eat the balance for lunch the following day with the addition of some spicy sausage. Sorry but no blue ribbon on this from our family.

This was a really nice way to use up some kale. I used whole milk instead of cream (all I had). I wasn't comfortable with blending the potatoes, so I blended the kale alone, then mashed the potatoes with a masher by hand right in the milk. Next time, I would use a ricer because the mixture ended up a bit too runny and I'd like to take some of the milk out. Oh, and I also cooked the kale in broth and added spices to the potatoes. But, overall I was pretty true to the recipe and really enjoyed it.

I enjoyed this - it was easy, a nice side dish. A bit bland, though. Go nuts on the seasoning.

This was easy and delicious. And healthier than regular mashed potatoes! I didn't have heavy cream, so I used a combination of buttermilk and 1% milk. Also added a small handful of grated parmesan and some butter.

Overall very good and not very hard. I made a couple changes and I am happy I did as otherwise I think this would be very bland. First I cooked the kale in a 50/50 blend of chicken stock/broth and water. Then I cooked some bacon first(about 3 tp 4 slices) in the skillet till almost crispy, drained some of the fat and then added the potatoes and half and half with to the bacon along with the little remaining fat and simmered. I found this added some great flavor to the dish. Overall I thought very good and definitely something different.

Great dish to serve for guests. The kale and potatoes go well with eachother.

This recipe is so simple and delicious. Great way to use up the kale that is growing relentlessly in my back yard.

This was a good and quick side for a weekday meal, and an excellent way to plow through some extra greens in the crisper. I would suggest adding some lemon zest or a little bit of rich stock while heating/thickening. It was just the teensiest bit bland, but still very good and filling.

After travelling thru Portugal this dish became one of my all time favorites for a great lunch with vinho verde but it has the addition of linguica sausage but the base of kale and potatoes is filling and it was always on the cheap.

Good and easy use of kale. Didn't peel the potatoes but did scrub them and dice them and simmered in fat free half & half to reduce calories. Didn't use food processor but used my new immersion blender instead - worked great. Make sure to use a type of potato that produces a nice fluffy mash on its own, then add the kale. Careful of the amount of liquid as the whole thing can get soupy. Very tasty. Everyone in my family loved it.

I used 2% milk instead of cream, and drained a bit so I could control the texture. I also pureed the greens separately, and added them to the coarsely mashed potatoes. Finally, I added some butter and cheese to add a bit more flavor. Amazing! It tastes like mashed potatoes, but with the added nutrients from the greens.

This is the kind of hearty dish you find at steakhouses, where vegetables must be disguised before being served. Kind of like old fave colcannon, but with kale instead of cabbage. I agree with the commenters who got gluey results by blending the potatoes. I ended up blending half, considering the unfortunate pasty consistency, and then just smooshing the other half of the potatoes into the finely-chopped kale. Didn't help much, but then there's something kind of nice about a fatty, potatoey mush that you can stand a fork up in or use to patch holes in your walls. (If your walls are a beautiful speckled green color.) Really, I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe. Just know that this is "comfort food" (assuming you associate comfort with potato flakes and canned string beans) - not haute cuisine.

Wow, delish! The husband and I loved this. I'll definitely make it again (although I might try it with milk instead of cream to cut the fat). Cooking the potatoes in the dairy gives them a great flavor.

This was delicious, as is. My husband, who doesn't really like kale, gobbled it up and had seconds. Even my 1-year old ate the kale. I didn't bother pureeing it either, it's delicious chunky and less hassle.

Made this one for Christmas dinner along with the pork roast etc. The kale potatoes were so good they were requested again the following night. The second time i finely chopped the parboiled kale and hand stirred it into the potatoes which had pretty much fallen apart in the milk they were cooked in. delicious and much less glue-y than the food processed ones.

Very good with a few changes. Used heavy cream but only pureed the kale and heavy cream (after potatoes were cooked in it). Riced the potatoes separately and folded them into the kale. Much nicer texture. Processing it all makes the mixture very glue like. Very pretty on plate especially with the pork roast featured.

used fat-free half & half - will save using the cream for a special occasions. prepared as i would mashed potatoes, instead of processing. very good and very healthy.

GREAT TASTING SURPRISE! Everyone in my gourmet group loved this dish This dish does in fact resemble creamed spinach and upon first bite really surprised my guests - in a very good way. Everyone asked for the recipe. One variation - added extra 1/4-1/3 lb of Kale to Puree process to give the flavor an extra boost to match it's great color. I originally used the full portions of Kale to Potato and that left the Potato taste a little strong. And, next time I'll puree the Kale first and only add the potato to blend the flavors. So easy, and so yummy!
