Cheated a bit and cooked this only 2 hours total, but that was sufficient. This is my favorite of the many beef stew recipes I've tried on this site.

As written this stew was acceptable but bland. After it was cooked I added truffle salt, more pepper, more thyme, and some garlic and that perked it right up. I used dried thyme instead of fresh so I had to guess on how much to add, the lack of thyme might have been my fault. It is a great base for building off and I will continue to experiment with it.

Fantasic! Best beef stew recipe ever. One guest said "this is an award winning beef stew". Loved cooking with wine. Some guests sugg'd the would have added garlic to the recipe but it was fine. Will definately make this recipe again.

This was my first time following a recipe for my father that has heart issues and can have an extremly small amount of salt. I used the no salt instead of real salt and I found unsalted chicken broth. My father and I loved it! The best stew he has had since he was a boy he said!

This is a good one, but... YES: Add mushrooms. and garlic cloves. Maybe an additional herb. YES: Fewer potatoes. There's way too many. Several left in my bowl right now. YES: Fewer carrots. They make the whole thing too sweet and void the tomato paste. YES: Smaller cuts of veggies, unless you're one of the Flintstones. The size of potatoes and carrots are cumbersome.

LOVED this stew! I added quartered baby portabella mushrooms. I was short on time and had to cut the cooking time by an hour. The meat was still incredibly tender and the stew full of flavor!

There are millions of recipes for beef stew with these basic ingredients, but this one was just exceptional. As sad as I was to pour two-thirds of a bottle of nice wine into the pot and not in my belly, I was equally happy to see how tender and delicious the resulting stew was. Served it over polenta.

Great stew! I added veal demi glace and it was awesome. Buy th every best pinot or syrah you an afford. The better quality the wine the better quality sauce!

Great recipe! Definitely makes a ton! Added some baby portabella mushrooms the last 15-20 mins of cooking.
