Roo bland. While the crunchy textures where nice, it was rather flat in taste. Maybe some chopped cilantro and season rice vinengar would give it some zest.

This salad has a wonderful crunch, but seems to be missing some integral ingedient that would make it TASTE wonderful. The ginger helps but maybe there should some soy sauce or seame oil in it to give it a flavor boost. IF I do make it again, I may substitute 1 tsp of soy sauce for 1 tsp vinegar and 1 tbls sesame oil for 1 tbls oilve oil.
