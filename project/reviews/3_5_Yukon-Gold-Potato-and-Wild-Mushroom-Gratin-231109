Made the recipe as written. Absolutely perfect, wouldn't change a thing. Big raves last year, making it again this holiday!

Mmmm so great! It's true that the baking time is a little different... maybe it depends on the dish. I used a casserole pie dish and baked for 45 min covered and another 35 open, and added about 1/2 cup of Parmesan to make a perfect crust on top. I don't think it would have been the same without the cheese - add some if you have it.

Flavor was pretty good but the whole thing came out watery and gross-looking. Maybe needed to cook longer, but seemed like the potatoes would have suffered for it.

SO I made the OTHER recipe there are a ton on this site.. skip this one and make the Wild Mushroom and potato gratin it is fantastic!

I was going to make this and add some gruyere, some nutmeg and some garlic per some of the reviews.... then I found the Wild Mushroom and Potato gratin on this site.. it called for all the things I wanted to add!

I think that the moister from the mushrooms create a need to cook longer than directed. Knowing this going into the cooking, my timing went better and the dish was very good.

Tasty, but the baking time was not long enough and I had to let the turkey sit longer than I wanted waiting for the gratin to finish cooking. Needed a bit more salt than specified (say my taste buds).

This recipe didn't turn out as well as i had hoped so I found a more detailed and better tasting recipe on Learninghowtocook.com. It has more steps, but it is worth it!

I made this for Sunday night dinner at home. Originally, it was supposed to be a Saturday night dish. I baked it for 45 minutes, then my dinner plans changed. I put it in the fridge overnight and baked it again for about 40 minutes the next day. This made a delicious, flavourful, cheesy dish, not at all runny and I don't think it suffered for being cooked in 2 stages. Instead of heavy cream, I used about a cup of 10% coffee cream; I also added leeks and some thickly sliced bacon and a layer of old cheddar cheese. It is a gratin, after all. I didn't think that the mushrooms added anything to the dish, though - next time, I might leave them out.

This is an excellent recipe, especially when using a mandoline to slice the potatoes. I sauteed the mushrooms with 1 leek, 2 tsp minced garlic and then deglazed the pan with a 1/4 cup of brandy. I also divided about a half cup of parmesan in between layers and on top. It turned out beautifully with a wonderful rich flavor.

I ended up adding cheddar cheese and far more mushrooms than the recipe called for, which is really a matter of taste, so no big concern there. Unfortunately, this dish did not turn out at all- I ended up baking it for hours longer! and the cream did not appear to thicken very much at all. the potatoes on top turned out well but that was just one layer of this dish. Very disappointing.

This was really simple to make. Definitely allow extra time to cook. I parboiled the potatoes and used a mandoline to slice it really thin, but it still required extra cooking time. I love mushrooms, so I added more than the recipe called for. 12 oz of fresh wild mushrooms is kinda expensive so I used both FWMs and button mushrooms. Overall, really good and I would make it again.

I made this dish last night for my family Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it! I followed the exact recipe and it was really easy to make. Added some parmesan cheese on the top for the finish look.

Sorry, I agree with the cooks from Georgia and Colorado, this was very disappointing (and I was so excited too....a new gratin recipe!). Just looking at the ingredients I knew it would be very bland, so I added extra, extra salt and pepper. Cooked it longer too as the potatoes never really got as tender as they should have (not my oven or the temp fault). Too much cream...never penetrated the yukons. I've made so many excellent gratin potatoes recipes and this doesn't even deserve 1 fork. I would not make this again, even with the addition of cheese (which is why some cooks liked it). There are plenty of excellent gratin recipes to use/try.

Made this with a roast chicken dinner one night-so delicious!! very heary, rich dish- Be sure to add the salt and pepper. I'll try the cheddar next time.

Wow, everyone LOVED this - even very picky grown stepsons! My only comment is that I used more potatos than called for and the large baking dish, and it resulted in a very thin layer of food. I would recommend a smaller casserole dish for the amount in the original recipe. I could have easily doubled this for 8 people to have enough. No need to parboil the potatos if you slice them thin enough. No need to add any other ingredients. Yum. I will triple this and make it for Memorial Day BBQ.

Loved this! Easy and very flavorful. We used domestic mushrooms (good luck finding wild mushrooms in a small city), and parboiled the potatoes. WOW!

My family just loves this recipe. It is so simple and easy to make...plus it makes excellent left-overs! The only advice is to definitely use quality cream. I tried a low-fat version...too runny. I have also added cooked bacon and some quality cheddar to this dish. Also very yummy. This recipe makes a lot. For a family of 3, I cut recipe in half.

Okay. This was gross. I made it exactly like the recipe called for. I am a good cook, so it wasn't my fault. This dish was really not very good. The potatoes were undercooked, even if they weren't, it would have still been nasty. The flavors did not blend. I used oyster mushrooms - they're great - not with the potatoes and the blue cheese. Not so good. I brought this to a friend's house thinking it would be a treat. We tried to give it to the dog, and he wouldn't even eat it. Yuck!

This was a beautiful and tasty dish. I also added some parmesan but only cooked it about 10 minutes longer than the recipe says. It went great with my beef tenderloin!

This was a great addition to my steak dinner this evening. I too added grated parm to the layers, and also ended up cooking it for about 45 mins longer.

It took much longer to cook than given in the recipe and didn't really have much taste. I would have added some Parmesan cheese to the layers to give it some punch.

liked this one-- added parmesian cheese to give it more zip and par boiled the potatoes to make cooking time shorter.

liked this one- added parmesian cheese on top of the layers for a little more zip.

Excellent side dish with darn near all meats - The Yukon Gold potatoes really soak up the flavor of the mushrooms, and the cream thickens up during baking. Really, really good.

Excellent dish. I had a feeling it was going to take a lot longer to cook than was listed and it did, so plan for extra time -- it took an extra 45 minutes to come out like the picture.
