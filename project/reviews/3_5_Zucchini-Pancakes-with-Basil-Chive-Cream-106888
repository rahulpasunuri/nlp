No forks! This recipe bombed! I have never had a recipe fail so badly. I will never make this again. I will use the sauce for my spinach quiche.

My main complaint is what the recipe says the yield is. I halved the recipe and got 4 tiny pancakes and I was expecting 7. The zucchini cakes are just okay, they could really use some seasoning regardless of the sauce.

The pancakes were good but not as wonderful as the overall rating would have led me to believe. So while I wasn't unsatisfied with the results it was like going to a movie that everyone has been raving about and not thinking it was all that. I did add extra basil and chives to the pancakes themselves and made an impromptu tomato, red onion, and pepper side salad. So... good, but I think I'll try a different recipe as a base next time.

Delicious, crunchy and light. As other reviewers suggest, squeezing out as much water as possible is important. You will in fact wind up with a surprisingly small lump of zucchini, but don't mess with the flour/sugar portions--adding more flour will make the pancakes disgusting. When I first made these I did the herb cream but substituted nonfat yogurt for the cream. It wasn't tasty enough to repeat. The 2nd time I made them I served simply with nonfat yogurt, plus homemade applesauce (yum!!), plus for the savory side I served smoked mackarel and herbed green olives. Oh, boy, what a delicious mix!

I would give this recipe 0 forks, but the computer would think that I didn't rate it. I think my mistake was squeezing out too much water. Don't listen to the people who tell you to get out as much water as possible! My four cups of zucchini turned into a couple tiny lumps, and the lumps were then overwhelmed by flour and egg whites. I ended up with tasteless little lumps of floury-tasting stuff that I couldn't eat. It was also totally tasteless because some sort of herbs are desperately needed. I would try these again and not squeeze out as much water if I didn't know of an infinetely better recipe on this site. Try the zucchini panckes with feta cheese--they're fabulous. This recipe is hereby deleted.

Outstanding recipe - with or without the sauce!! Important points to remember for a fabulous outcome every time: whipping the egg whites enough and squeezing the moisture out of the grated zukes until you can't drain them any more. Yum-yum!

Since the recipe said pancake instead of fritter I was never expecting them to be crispy. They came out just as advertised, like a pancake. I though they were really good. I made it into 8 pancakes which we had for lunch with some marinara sauce. Delicious!

Pretty darn good recipe. We've made it with and without the eggwhite and can't decide which way we like it better. I got a lot crisper results when i ditched the nonstick pan in favor of Grandma's well-seasoned cast iron skillet (still with minimal oil). I'm thinking that next I'll make a dill cream and top the pancakes with shrimp...

I'm always on the lookout on how to gussy up zucchini, so I liked this. the basil and chives were fresh out of my garden so I was a happy camper to use them as well. the recipe made too much of the cream, but I happily used it to flavor a marinara for ravioli the next night

for those of you who are ending up with mushy pancakes (or those who want to avoid them) getting as much excess water out of the zucchini as possible really is essential. i drained mine very thoroughly and then cooked them in a panini press and yum ... very crispy and nice.

This is awesome. I used creme fraiche instead of sour cream to make the sauce. Aside from that, I followed the directions exactly. This is a great summer meal!

Don't be discouraged by the three-fork rating. I have to be going into obscene raptures in order to be willing to rate something with four forks - so three is still something well worth going for! These pancakes were light and airy but still flavourful, and with the shredding and salting it makes good use of even not-the-freshest-ever zucchini. (Fortunate, because our plants all died last year. Oops.) I don't think, however, that I'd recommend trying to keep them warm in the oven until serving, or if you do, be careful about how you do it: on a cookie sheet and some paper towels in a 200 degree oven, mine went from crisp to limp after holding for about ten minutes. My modifications: because I had some yogurt (the strained greek kind) on hand, I used that instead of sour cream. Came out pretty well, but since I fudged, I think I'm only qualified to recommend the pancakes as written. :)

This is a fabulous side dish or brunch buffet component. I agree with the reviewer from Beautiful Hood River - these do stay in a warm oven. I think I actually prefer finishing them off in the oven. With leftovers, I store in the fridge then reheat in the oven. I like the Basil Chive Cream but as others said, it's not a necessity. These are not your breakfast type pancakes, I would call them zucchini rosti (shredded potato cake)...which paints a more accurate view of the texture

The pancakes were just mushy and bland. I cooked my second batch longer and still just mush! For the sauce we only added 1/2 of the water and added a clove of garlic. The sauce was not worth keeping. We love zucchini just dipped in egg and pancake powder and fried: with the mustard cream sauce from this site, 'Bon Appetit' June 1998.

We made this last night for an impromptu gathering and they were a hit. Next time, I will make them slightly larger than a silver dollar so that they cook in the given time and they are easier to eat as an appetizer. I made them fist size and while a mosit crispy texture, they don't cut well with a fork. It will be easier to put them in your mouth as one bite.

This didn't work for me at all. The batter was so thick that I couldn't get it to spread, and I ended up with goopy clumps of zucchini browned on the outsides. I do like the concept, and I'm looking forward to trying a different version.

A great Hors d'Oeuvre recipe when dropped onto a hot griddle in bite size scoops. The little zuchs hold well in a warming oven for hot, on demand party bites...enjoy!

Excellent! Perfect as a side dish or for brunch. I may try with eggplant someday. Very good recipe!

didn't make the accompanying cream as I didn't have the sour cream but I made the cakes as mentioned with the addition of chiffonades of basil added to the batter. delicious.

these were very tasty, though my pancakes did not get crispy at all, I kept cooking them waiting for that to happen but it didn't. They were very mild, which is why the herbed sauce is a nice compliment. A great way to use some of that zucchini from the garden--I could easily have doubled the batch of pancakes, and had lots of sauce leftover.

This was a great healthy "comfort food" dish for a lazy Sunday night. We added scallions to the zucchini which added a nice flavor. We also used Pam Spray instead of oil...so our pancakes were extra healthy. Don't expect these pancakes to be crispy with Pam...we liked them all the same!!!!

A nice change from regular pancakes but I wouldn't call them little clouds of heaven. My husband loved them, I thought they were good, not great. As for the sauce I agree with another reviewer that it was very runny. I didn't have basil or chives so I used fresh parsley and red onion and it was delicious, even better the next day. I only got 6 medium size pancakes out of it, so to make the 15 pancakes they have to be very small. I would make these again and use other reviewers suggestions.

We served this as a wonderful starter! Really very easy to make, but your guests will never know it. It looks (and tastes) impressive. I served two pancakes on little appetizer plates to each guest. The basil chive cream makes it look sophistocated. I'll surely make this again.

I just re-read the ingredients and realized that when I made these last night, I forgot the flour!! They were excellent anyway! I will try with the flour next time, although they are Atkins' friendly without. I also wanted to try Pam spray instead of oil- has anyone tried that?

i'm glad that i read the other reviews, i was very concerned with the flour zucchini mess, but they really did taste like clouds, very light and fluffy. what else would be good? mushrooms? or would they be too heavy for the egg whites?? great side item.

These were very good. My family loved them. I added shallots and nutmeg to the zucchini mixture...yum! The basil chive cream was a little runny.

These pancakes came out fluffy and light and extremely flavorful. I used yogurt for the sauce with basil, chives, and tarragon all from the garden. We had it for a main course with gazpacho. A+ summer flavors and it comes together quickly.

With the addition of feta cheese and oregano, and just plain sour cream or yogurt, so good. I thought I made this recipe up (with the feta!)

Yummy! These are delicious. I've made them twice and they turned out great both times. Aside from squeezing out the zucchini, they are very quick to make. I found the recipe serves two perfectly as a side dish.

i thought these would be magnificent, but they ended up being mediocre. i was doing a test run for my husband's birthday party, and i'm glad i did, because it's giving me time to look for a new recipe to make. Any other suggestions?

Yum... This recipe stands on it's own as is, but what makes it additionally great are the endless possibilities for addition: mushrooms, shallots, parmesan...on and on. I anticipated these to be more like the delicious, heavier Eurpean style potato pancakes. These were like biting into clouds of wonderfully flavored air, given the egg whites. Whether as hors d'oeuvres or part of a light lunch, don't be afraid to double the recipe. Two/three inch pancakes are small, afterall. The sour creme was the perfect complement.

I think the word "pancake" led me to make these for breakfast--a mistake, but not a big one. These are really great and very sophisticated. I love zucchini and am always on the lookout for great new recipes. This one is definitely a keeper.

I made these the other night and my husband had a complaint: I hadn't made enough! Actually, I made half the recipe, because I thought 15 pancakes would be way too much for the two of us. Half the recipe produced six small (about 3-inch diameter) pancakes. They were very good, tender and flavorful. I had my doubts while preparing them, however, as the wrung-out zuchinni and flour looked like a sodden mess, and I feared I wouldn't be able to successfully combine it with the beaten egg white. It worked out fine, though. The basil chive cream was a nice extra, but not essential by any means.
