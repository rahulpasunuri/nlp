Such an interesting combination of flavors, and a simple "amuse bouche" before a summer dinner. I crowded the tomatoes together on the plate and just sprinkled the almonds and sliced cheese evenly on top, then placed on leaf of parsley on each. It worked out fine, though I discovered that this wasn't quite finger food and require serving spoon and small plates. We loved it!

I gave this recipe 3 forks only because of the flavor combinations - not the method. If any of those reading this have a food processor at their disposal, try this: Put the parsley leaves and (I used toasted slivered) almonds in and coarse chop, about 4-5 seconds. Add the cheese and pulse for 2-3 seconds total. Gently spoon the appropriate amount onto the tomato and top with a parsley leaf or almond. This method prevented any of the stuffing from spilling.
