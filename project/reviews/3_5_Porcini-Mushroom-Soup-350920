Loved this soup. Made it for Christmas eve and it was a huge hit. The only change I made was to replace the parsley with cilantro.

I made this soup for a neighborhood potluck and it was a big hit! Very hearty and very flavorful! I read all the other reviews and pretty much took everyone's advice, making the following changes - I did not use dill but instead added bay leaf, thyme and sage. I added potatoes (diced) instead of pureeing. I used creminis instead of white mushrooms and added the soaked porcinis (chopped) back to the soup. I also used 1/2 veg broth, 1/2 water.

Delicious, fresh and hearty. The canned tomatoes are the only thing I might change. Maybe use tomato paste instead. I will sub creminis for white mushrooms next time to get a meatier taste. Very simple and definitely yummy.

We loved this soup! I added extra onion and garlic as some of the other here did (I can never get enough). I accidentally thought I had more white mushrooms than I did, so I ended up with a blend - extra porcini, 8oz white, 8oz baby bella. It was thick and flavorful!

I love this labor intensive recipe and have made it a dozen times. It's always a request for potlucks too. My modifications: I use crimini instead of white mushrooms, season at every stage with salt and ground black pepper, add 2-3 cups of chopped kale or cabbage, add more chopped carrot or beets for chunkier soup, and finish each serving with a little creme fraiche. The other dishes in the Hanukkah meal are also delicious and worth the effort.

I really liked this soup..I added about a cup and a half of dried mushrooms and let them soak for 30 minutes to intensify the flavor of the broth. I used half chicken broth and half water, and thought it made for a richer broth. Added a handful of barley and skipped the puree step. A good soup for a cold New England day!!

Base of this soup is really standard (and great), any mushroom would do really. I used a big can of diced tomatoes instead of a 15oz, as well as part veg broth instead of just water. I also don't like dill, so instead, I put fresh thyme, rosemary, a bayleaf and some black peppercorns in there. As others mentioned, throwing in some barley or potatoes would be awesome and totally fit in this soup, esp if you don't want to blend anything and want to thicken it up. Even better if you broil some good rustic bread with some olive oil, garlic/herbs to go with the soup. Really quick to make.

I really wanted a mushroom soup I could enjoy. I did the barley, extra salt, pureed part to thicken, decreased the dill and added some basil. It still tasted like a mud pie to me. Tried a bit of sour cream..rich mud pie. I like mushrooms in salads and on pizza... To make a soup just intensifies the muddy taste...sigh.

phooey! where's the sour cream? this recipe is terrible.

This is a delicious and satisfying soup - I make a non-tomato version of it regularly, but what is with all the blenderizing? I can guarantee the Russian grandmother never did that (being from the "old country" myself). What she probably did was add some barley and potatoes, both of which would thicken the broth. (Maybe, just maybe, she would have mashed the potatoes after cooking, but I highly doubt it.) She would have also added a little sour cream when serving.

Great Soup! I used baby bellas instead of white mushrooms. Also topped with yogurt and chives, yum.

Great soup. Would pass on the dill next time, but if you like dill maybe cut it in half. Added Barley (suggest cooking the night before if you use barley). Added a second can of tomatoes.

This was really labor-intensive, and I was disappointed that the broth didn't have the richness that I had hoped for. Not sure whether I will try it again.

Awesome soup! I used a variety of wild mushrooms instead of just porcinis. Plus added dried thyme. Delish.

This has a great hearty flavor. Used my favorite mushrooms, crimini, and it must have increased volume since they don't shrink as much as most so this time I did not need to blenderize any, though I probably would with the white mushrooms. The tomatoes rounded out the flavor nicely (used a 28 oz can instead of 15 oz). Unbelievable that it is a vegetarian soup! Also tried the barley as some suggested and it went perfectly making the soup even heartier. Great way to get your vegetables!

I skipped the pureeing (due to laziness), doubled the garlic, and added a cup of cooked wild rice at the end, plus salt/pepper to taste. Yum.

Sheesh, folks....save some money and get canned beef broth and dump a half ton of salt in it. Leave out ALL the other stuff...you can't cook anyway; this is OUTSTANDING with a MINIMUM (qv) of salt.

This recipe is fabulous! We created the entire menu from this issue and the mushroom soup was the big hit with everyone-will make it again and again.

I got rave reviews on this soup! Agree with another reviewer -- double the onions and garlic. I think the puree step was very important, this is a hearty soup and the broth needed a little thickening. I might add some barley or faro next time - I served with fresh baguette, which was good, but almost too plain. This soup needs a lot of salt to really bring out the flavors. I can't wait to eat the leftovers tonight!

This is a yummy recipe and will definitely make it again - far from blah - BUT - I suggest that you double the garlic and onion. Reduce the tepid water from 6 cups to 3 - blend the veggies and don't delete the dill.

This is very delicious soup! And easy too! I didn't use dill and I didn't puree the vegetables. I also had to use a mix of musrooms, however it turned out well and I will deff make this soup again!

This soup was outstanding. We gave it four forks after asking ourselves "Is there a mushroom soup that we've liked more?". As mushroom soups go, this one is superb. My wife made it and did it exactly by the book. It turned out awesome. Deeply flavorful and hearty with a rich deep brown broth. If you don't have porcini mushrooms, though, I don't think it would be anywhere near as good. I could imagine tossing in a handful of barley next time, just to make it even heartier, but it's good as it stands.

Was just OK...not worth the effort or all the expensive dried mushrooms. Broth might have been better if you add thyme rather than dill (I didn't do that unfortunately). We ate some soup without blending then pureed it a bit with a hand blender. Didn't make too much of a difference - still blah.

This does have good flavor, but definitely don't skip out on the salt! Even with the celery, it needs it. I also didn't blend my broth in the blender, and it's absolutely fine. I do recommend cutting up the porcini mushrooms before adding to the soup.

Delicious, light and incredibly flavorful for a vegetarian soup. I love the earthy, meaty flavor of porcinis, especially when enhanced with butter! I skipped pureeing because I was craving a lighter broth.
