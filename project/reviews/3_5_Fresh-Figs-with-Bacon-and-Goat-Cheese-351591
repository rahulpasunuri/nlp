Very simple to make and delicious. Used plain goat cheese. On some added a very slight drizzle of honey diluted in water for a little hint of added sweetness and moistness after baking.

Very simple recipe and very delicious! I made a few slight adjustments. Prosciutto instead of bacon, and I used honey goat cheese to add some sweetness. The honey worked well with the balsamic vinaigrette, and really added to the juicy fig flavor.

Followed the recipe and received rave reviews from my brutally honest guests. Will make again.

Despite a less than perfect review, I decided to try out this recipe for a dinner party this weekend. It was phenomenal! I used an aged balsamic to add sweetness that the other reviewer said was lacking. The thick syrupy vinegar went perfectly with the tangy cheese and the tart figs. I used slices from a small slab of pork belly in place of the bacon; the figs and the belly formed flavorful melt-in-your mouth combo. I will definitely make these again, as soon as figs are back in season. Easy to prep ahead on a sheet pan and throw in the oven as needed.

This was good, and definitely easy but I had expected it to be better. I felt this lacked a the sweetness to offset the pungent goat cheese. Next time I will either make as directed but drizzle on a sweetened balsamic vinegar reduction or I will try this other recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Mesclun-Salad-with-Goat-Cheese-Stuffed-Figs-Wrapped-in-Bacon-105402
