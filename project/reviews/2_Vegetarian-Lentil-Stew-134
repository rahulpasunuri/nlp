Use red lentils. Use vegetable broth. Fresh ginger - double the amount. Plum tomatoes- 5 instead of 6. Also, put in at very end of cooking. Zucchini - 4 instead of 3 cubed instead of rounds. Also, put zucchini in towards end of cooking. I used one whole bunch of cilantro, chopped. Everyone loved it!

I didn't rate this because I made so many revisions: I used this as a base recipe, hold the cumin and mustard. Add to it: cauliflower, mushrooms, canned tomatoes and their juice, diced tofu, kale, fake sausage. Double the liquid to cover all those veggies. Let simmer until lentils start to fall apart and thicken the stew. It came out delicious.

This is an easy recipe to revise on the fly and season to taste. You'll never need to look up a lentil, stew, chili, etc. again. Everything up to the cumin was spot on to me. I used about 1 tsp. of cumin, skipped the mustard and added in a couple of chopped carrots, a peeled and diced Japanese eggplant, and a diced, seeded jalapeno. I skipped the tomato and zucchini. Lots of cilantro is a must. The ratio of lentils to liquid is fine for cooking about an hour in an open pot. I used half chicken stock (OK, so that shoots the vegetarian part). The result was terrific.

I have to agree, it was bad. I put in half the cumin required and that was all I could taste... By the time you have fiddled and improved this, there's practically nothing left of the original recipe. Don't bother...

After reading the previous reviews, I made some changes and additions to this recipe. And I am happy to report the stew was quite delicious! First, I used vegetable broth instead of water. I added more ginger, about one tablespoon of curry powder, a little cayenne pepper, and salt. I also added some carrots and extra zucchini. When the stew was done, I added the fresh cilantro (this ingredient is essential) and a dollop of cucumber-mint raita (recipe from Bon Appetit August 2004, available on epicurious). I served the stew with toasted pita bread and some more raita on the side. It made a tasty and satisfying dinner. In the future, I will add more vegetables -- especially tomatoes. Green or red peppers may also taste good. Yellow squash would add some nice color. I will also wait to add the vegetables until the lentils are halfway done so they do not overcook. (This time the zucchini and carrots got a bit mushy.) As someone advised in a previous review, it is definitely best to add the tomatoes very near the end.

DO NOT, as I did, dare embarrass yourself by making this for company. I love lentils and find that they can be very flavorful when cooked in a variety of ways, but I have never in my life tasted a lentil dish as bad as this one. Truly tasteless. BLAH. They should pull this from the site to save others from a horrible mistake!!!

No offense to anybody, but this recipe was terrible. If you are considering trying this recipe...DON'T!

I would not make this recipe again. I made a large pot of this stew, ate one serving and then never brought myself to have another serving. It was way too bland and uninteresting. I found myself picking through and only eating the zucchini because that was the tastiest part of the meal.

I did all of the things the others suggested, adding the salt and tomatoes later, and served it with the basmati and peppercorn pilaf. I didn't have any problems with it being watery - it seemed to come out just right! My only problem was that I thought I had bought fresh ginger, but when I grated it, it looked the wrong color! It turned out that it was fresh tumeric!!!! Oh well, now I know what THAT looks like!

This was very yummy, but I made a few revisions based on other people's comments. First I omitted one cup of water - which I think was a must do. Second, I added a green pepper and some hot pepper sauce to give it a little more zing. Finally, I added about a tsp of salt and some pepper too. I would also agree with the commentator who suggested adding the tomatoes toward the end of the cooking. But after those little dressups it got rave reviews!

Good but not great; I have other lentil recipes I like better. Some tips: simmer it uncovered and it's less watery. The plain yogurt on top is a must.

This is oh-so bland and watery. I ended up adding lots of salt and pepper and even crumbled feta on top to give it a little zing. It was awful last night and hadn't improved much today at lunch. I will definitely not make this one again.

This is a great, healthy recipe that I look forward to making on a lazy Sunday and serving throughout the week. I recommend adding as many vegetables as you have on hand, cauliflower and broccoli are my favorites. I also recommend adding the tomatos very late in the cooking process or else they dissolve into just their skins.
