Yum! I loved the broccoli stalk in this. It is much like regular hummus, but the lemon tahini does add something special. This would be good on anything. I had mine with some pita, fresh spinach and sliced tomatoes. Perfect lunch.

Great with broccoli stalk substitute.

I looked at the ingredients and went, "Hey! Hummus!" and just added broccoli to my regular hummus recipe. It's a nice addition.

Really nice change of pace for my weekday lunches. The consistency ends up similar to that of tuna salad. I used chick peas I cooked myself, I am thinking this may get fairly paste-like if you used canned.

really nice sandwich spread for vegans and omnivores alike. i even made it with kidney beans instead of chickpeas and it was a little different but also good. i use it as a dip as well. (:
