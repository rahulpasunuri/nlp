Love this recipe, but I did add my own modification which I think made the cake a huge success at my last dinner gathering. Try using biscotti rather than graham crackers...really adds to the whole flavor profile of this cake. I especially die over the chocolate dipped variety - so good with cheesecake! http://boncorabiscotti.com/shop/2-lb-box/

I followed the recipe and this is delicious. But the so-called custard layer looks like a layer of egg yolk. It's a totally unappealing bright yellow. My family thinks the custard is "lemony" yellow, so they love it. But I know the truth: that the bright yellow color comes from nothing but egg yolks. It really turns me off to be looking at a layer of egg yolks in the middle of my cake. Every other recipe for custardor even for key lime pieincludes cream or condensed milk in the custard. Isn't some cream or milk missing in this custard recipe? Anyone else have this experience?

I love this recipe, but I have to agree with those who think there is no point to the sour cream topping, so next time I shall leave it out. I would also double the lime custard in the middle as it is really tasty but there doesn't seem to be very much of it.

I made exactly as stated except I did the cruse 1.5x since I only had a 9 in pan. That was a mistake because it was too thick and came out like a cookie. Also what I learned is that you have to get tin foil that is wide enough to come up sides of pan. Mine was short and so I hoped by layering the 3 sheets it would work but it didn't and water got it, but it still turned out good. Personally I thought the lime custard was way too sweet for me, so next time I will adjust it to 1/2 cup sugar and maybe 1 extra TB of lime juice. It was a pretty delicious cheesecake though.

This was one of the best cheesecakes I've ever made. You know it's a hit when your guests come back for seconds, and the husband gets up extra early the next morning to have a piece for breakfast before it's all gone.

This is a great recipe - made it last night - I used a 9 inch springform pan and made the crust recipe times 1.5... My guests loved it - I usually don't eat cheesecake (let alone making it) - but this recipe seemed manageable and the reviews were great so I decided to make it for my Caribbean-themed potluck. Well there isn't a single piece of cheesecake leftover :)

WOW...this was a big hit at the party! Do not skimp on the lime juice and it will be perfect. Not sure why people are saying it doesn't have enough lime taste or cheesecake taste. I thought it was a perfect balance of cheesecake and key lime pie. I used regular lime (I couldn't find key limes.) Oooh, the lime custard...that was delicious in the cake. I did put a bit of extra sugar in sour cream, plus I used a bit more then half the amount that was called for of the sour cream mixture. It was just enough. I will make it the same way again! This is a keeper!

Made this to rave reviews for Mother's Day. After reading many reviews I tweaked a few things.....used Persian limes and extra large eggs throughout and an exactly 8" (measured across the top) springform. For custard I increased yolks to 7, lime juice to 8 tbls and added a tablespoon of butter off the heat. For filling I used 1 block full-fat, 1 block low-fat cheese and increased the juice to 5 tbls. The custard & filling came almost to the top of my pan so no room for sour cream. I baked in a 325 degree oven, in water bath for 50 mins. Left in warm oven for another hour, cooled completely to room temp, then refrigerated for 16 hrs. It still cracked small, in one spot. Brought to room temp and served with lightly whipped, Cointreau flavoured heavy cream. It was light, yet rich. Creamy but not too heavy. Just sweet enough and still tangy. Next time I make it (and that'll probably be tomorrow! Curses, you giant bag of Costco limes!) I'll double the custard. Half for the cake and half to fold into the whipping cream for service. Can't wait!

Made this for the first time the other day for a housewarming party. Things I noticed: Being liberal with the sugar isn't a bad thing, particularly in the custard, and then later in the sour-cream mix. I recognized the custard recipe as one similar to the one I use for lemon meringue pie. Therefore, I used a similar technique: turning up the heat slowly as you introduce a pre-whisked sugar, egg, and lime juice mixture renders the custard more consistent, less likely to fry on the bottom of the pan, and less likely to bleed (as long as you let it boil enough) when the final cake is done. I overmixed the cream cheese filling, but like soap, this turned out to be a delightful mistake. The cheesecake portion was velvety smooth. The sour cream mixture on top benefited from an extra 3-4 minutes in the oven an an extra tbsp or two of sugar. In all, my mistake-riddled baking experience turned out to be a flavourful cheesecake that tasted as much like pie as it did cheesecake. No complaints here - and I'd make it again for a special occasion. Bit too much effort for a day-to-day, though.

Rating: 3
The crust + custard are yummy. I did 1+1/2 of the custard amounts; I also cut the sour cream mixture by half which was still loads. To save on a few calories, I used non fat cream cheese + non fat sour cream and it was still really rich. The cake was good, but a bit goopy.

I made this recipe for the second time tonight. I did modify the recipe slightly as I made 1.5 times the custard and I used lightly sweetened stabilized whipped cream for the topping rather than sour cream. I found that the whipped cream really adds a nice contrast to the tart lime. I always let my cheesecakes cool in the oven with the door propped open and have never had a problem with the filling not being set or cracks in the top of the cheesecake. Also, I strain the custard through a mesh sieve just in case any little pieces of egg may have cooked. I would not recommend adding any sugar as the cheesecake is plenty sweet enough with the amounts listed.

Rating: 0
Shouldn't there be some cream in the custard part? Mine came out all lumpy and tasted way too eggy. I've read all the reviews and no one, so far, mentions that. I agree about the sour cream. It doesn't add anything except a pretty 'nother layer when cut; also adds extra calories...

Rating: 0
For a first time cheesecake maker, this turned out really well. Yes it's tart, but it's lime! I would not add more sugar because it's definitely sweet enough. I also used double the lime and like the extra flavour. FYI, I used non-fat sour cream and low fat cream cheese and a bit less sugar than the recipe calls for and it turned out wonderfully. As far as the jigglyness is concerned, I added an extra egg to the filling and it's not jiggly at all. Enjoy!

To DJoe from Miami - It means that the total process to heat until thickened including the 30 seconds of boiling is about 8 minutes. I love this dessert. My daughter asked for it for her birthday and wants me to make it for most special occasions. I often make it in a mini-cheesecake pan to make bite sized cheesecakes. I find this a great way to take this fantastic cheesecake to events.

I made this for a friend who likes her key lime pie a little more firm so I suggested I'd make this cheesecake version. She LOVED it! I made it with a chocolate graham cracker crust and didn't add the sour cream layer after after a reviewer said it didn't do much to enhance the flavor. With that being said, i'm making mine tonight!

I made this recipe for my husband on father's day.... and it was not really what I expected. The taste was a bit too bitter, and there was not enough of the cream cheese. I wanted to add more, but decided to stick with the recipe and follow the instructions. The next time I make it...I would add less of the key lime, as it was a bit to tart or bitter or I would add more sugar. Additionally, I would add a bit of flour to the cream cheese portion, so that it would be a bit firmer.

The directions for the custard says to " heat until custard thickens & bolis for 30 seconds, about 8 minutes". So which is it? Is it 30 seconds or 8 minutes? Can't be both.

Are you serious?!? I should have known as I looked at the recipe.. I had read the reviews about it being slightly loose so I didn't heed the giggle... I should have - as I walked it to the fridge after removing the sprinform the darn thing colapsed. I have made a lot of cheese cakes - and I did follow all directions against my better judgement... but this was a disaster. The custard tasted wonderful though as did the pieces I licked off my fingers. I would use the ingredients in my standard recipe - now what is Mother's day Dessert tomorrow - looks like a trifle. ((sigh))

first off let me say that I really loved this cheesecake and you should make it too if you love citrus and cheesecake. I doubled the curd per other reviewers' recommendations and I was happy that I did, since the cheesecake itself has a very mild lime flavor. I loved that the cheesecake is a light and delicate one and not a dense, heavy one like a new york style cheesecake. I would probably leave out the sour cream on top as it didn't really add anything flavor or texture wise. It was kind of pointless. But it does look pretty. Finally, I'm not sure that I could tell the difference between this being key lime or lemon. Maybe my key limes were only so-so, or maybe in the end citrus just kind of has the same flavor. Either way it was delicious. I will definitely make this again with the changes (double curd, no sour cream topping).

Every blue ribbon recipe we've made has come out fantastic. This one is no exception. We made this on the fly for a special family dinner and didn't have enough time to refrigerate overnight so we froze for an hour and left in the fridge for a couple of hours before serving. The whole family raved about this cheesecake. The layers of flavour made for a great combination. Enjoy!!!!

This is a fantastic recipe. I've made it several times. We love it. Give it plenty of time to chill. I have found that it helps to weigh your eggs, especially if you're using organic eggs. If you're short, add yolk, not white which gives that 'eggy' flavor. Weight of One Large Egg: In Shell = 57 grams Without Shell = 50 grams White Only = 30 grams Yolk Only = 18 grams (yeah that doesn't add up but this is from the joyofbaking.com, I don't have On Food and Cooking handy at the moment, but that looks right)

This is a great recipe. Friends and family are always asking when I am going to make it again. I have followed the recipe as written and the only problem I seem to be having is with the consistency of the cheesecake layer. To me, it seems soft and runny compared to what I think of when someone mentions cheesecake. I tried letting it sit in the oven for an extra 1/2 hour while the oven cooled down and another time I cooked it an hour and 15 minutes. Even after trying these two tricks it still seems "loose" for a cheesecake. The header on the recipe did say creamy but this is not what I had in mind. Any ideas or comments would be appreciated.

With a bumper crop of limes from my tree and a passion for cheesecake, this recipe was a natural. It was my first attempt at making cheesecake. The recipe is straightforward except that as a neophyte it wasn't obvious to me what the 3 layers of aluminum foil were about until I realized at the end that the springform pan might leak in the water bath. OK, so it's to form a seal, so you need big whole sheets. The second thing I didn't realize until too late is that the custard should be made just before putting into the crust. I made it first, and it had congealed so much that it was hard to spread onto the crust. Making more custard as some recommend seems like a good idea too- next time I'll double the amount (it is truly yummy).I used slightly more lime juice and zest and less sugar all around, and the result was outstanding. This is scrumptious.

MMMM. The crust, the filling, the custard per the recipe are what I based max forks on. The topping is where I made my changes. I topped the cheesecake with dollops of whipping cream around the edge where I wanted it sliced. The centre I added dried edible blossoms and in the end the presentation was quite nice...looked homeade. Like other reviewers, I skipped the bath and the cake turned out with minor cracks, which I thought added the homemade character I like.

This was my first attempt at a cheesecake. My husband loves key lime pie, so I thought this would be a neat new recipe to try for his birthday. He loved it! I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, except I substituted the lime peel in the cream cheese mixture for another tbsp of lime juice. I think I would make this recipe again if my husband asked me to, but I am curious to try more cheesecake recipes in the future!

I made this cheesecake for my in-laws who are major fans of key lime pie (straight from the Keys!). They both really liked it. I had the butter-ooze problem with the crust that a few other reviewers mentioned: I think it's a matter of what type of ginger cookie we used. If they've been coated at all (palm oil, for example), then the butter won't absorb into the crumbs (I roll-pinned the ginger cookies into a crumb). Decreasing the butter might not even help. Just be careful of the cookie selection. But the ginger flavour, as suggested by others, was a fine touch. I also added juice to the crust, as well as extra juice to the custard and filling. There were no key limes or key lime juice available, so I used limes and lemons (in combination) instead. Decreasing the sugar for each layer was wise. Increasing the lime/lemon was wise. I will use less sour cream next time, however (I found it was a tad too much in quantity). I didn't use any sort of water bath; the cake did crack, but of course the sour cream toping solved that aesthetic problem. Wonderful recipe, easy to follow (just needs careful attention), and forgivable for those less experienced with cheese cakes.

Loved the simplicity of the ingredients for such a wonderful pie! I adjusted every layer--not just to cut calories, but in general I think most pies are too sweet. Crust: Used crushed dollar store almond cookies--that's it. Just generously buttered the bottom and sides of pan. Saved about 800 calories right there. Custard:used extra lime juice and zest, reduced the sugar to about 1/2 cup. Cream: Used 1 block lite cr. cheese, 1 block regular. Reduced sugar here too. Added extra lime juice and zest. Topping: Used lite sour cream and reduced the sugar (and used about 12 oz. sour cr. instead of 16). Baked in water bath. Baked the last step an extra 10 mins. b/c the topping looked wet. Results: ZESTY and AMAZING!!! Not too sweet--perfect texture--you don't miss the crust. This is a keeper recipe for sure! Next time I will probably use all lite cream cheese.

I love citrus desserts and this cheesecake is perfection. I served it at a luncheon and everyone raved about it. I made it exactly as described in the recipe and baked in the water bath and it was amazing. I made the cheesecake the night before I served it and st the last minute realized I only had a 10 inch springform pan,instead of the 8 or 8-1/2 inch called for in the recipe. Since it wss too late to go out and buy a smaller pan, I decided to make it anyway and adjusted the cooking time accordingly. Actually, I think I prefer the larger pan because it gives you a wider area making it easier to cut and serve. Next time though, I will double the custard recipe as in the 10 inch pan it only gave me very thin, but definitely delicious,layer.

I made this for my Mom's birthday, when we traditionally have key lime pie. It was a great hit. As other reviewers have stated, the consistency was not like traditional cheesecake but still delicious, everyone requested that I make it again, my son said tomorrow! I did boost the custard so it was 1 1/2 of the normal portion and unfortunately I didn't follow other reviewers advice with the water bath and did have some leakage, but no damage was done. I also used key lime juice from the store, no fresh ones to grab this time of year. Great recipe, thanks to all of the other reviewers!

This was relatively quick, very easy, and extremely yummy. The custard in particular is fantastic; I would make 1.5 the amount next time. This is the perfect graham cracker crust. It was so moist and buttery, and it is the perfect (slightly unexpected) complement. The cheese cake part was extremely creamy and bit mushier than I was expecting. While less firm than most cheesecake, it was just as good! I couldn't find key limes, so I used regular limes and added an extra tablespoon juice and peel in the custard and filling. I would slightly reduce sugar in the custard and filling. Instead of the water bath, I baked with a pan of water; the cake did crack, but it was unnoticeable when the final layer was added. I might put food coloring in the sour cream layer to give it color distinction, since it blended in the the cheese layer.

This was amazing! I used some of the reviews - added cracklin oat bran to the crust and didn't use a water bath...my only issue was with the custard - I had trouble getting it to the right consistency - first try ended up like scrambled eggs!

Amazing. Especially if you're a big fan of key lime pie and cheesecake...I made this for myself for my birthday. I was a little nervous about the custard, as it seemed really eggy- tasting by itself, but gave a lusciousness to the cheese filling that really made the difference to the whole. I did add a slight bit more lime juice to the recipe (I like it tart), and for the crust used 1C graham cracker crumbs + 1C crushed Cracklin Oat Bran cereal(makes it stupid good). Also, I put water in pan below the cake, instead of using the bath, the top turned out crackless. I will surely make this again - soon!

I made this just as the recipe calls. There is NO NEED to "swirl" the custard with the cheesecake. If you follow the recipe and let it come to room temp before pouring into the crust, it will not absorb into the crust. I made this for my coworkers and it was a BIG HIT!

ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS KEYLIME CHEESECAKE!!! I have never made a cheesecake before. I seriously thought it was going to be a disaster making this cheesecake for the first time. This cheesecake turned out perfect! Each slice came out perfect each time I served it! What I did change a little was for the custard it called for 6 egg yolks- I used the whole 6 eggs (really as a mistake because of not reading the recipe carefully!) But it turned out great! I also added a extra tablespoon of keylime to the filling & custard. I felt it needed more keylime flavor. I decorated the cheesecake with slices of keylime & fresh fruit. If you follow the recipe carefully & slowly it will come out perfect! I've made this twice so far & this is my new dessert that I will make next time I'm invited to parties! I would give this 10 forks if I could!!

always avoided making Cheesecake because of the high degree of difficulty. After reading all the reviews I decided to take a chance. OMG I cannot believe how good (and easy) this was.

One of the best cheesecake recipes I have ever tried. I did not cook the cake in water as the sour cream topping hides any cracks that may appear. I would say that it is very important to use key limes and key lime juice in this recipe. I don't think regular limes would give it the same flavorful tang. I forgot to add the key lime zest but it did not seem to take away from the flavor of the cake at all.

This cheesecake is OUTSTANDING. I didn't see a need to place the cake in a pan of water, but I understood the importance of that step. Instead, I placed a pan of water directly beneath the cake and it worked out perfectly (no cracks on top). My cake came out looking just like the one in the photo, and no doubt tasted just as good. I love a cookie crust, so I added about 1/4 cup of extra cookie crumbs (Keebler) than the recipe called for. I also used regular limes, not the tiny key limes. I made this cheesecake after tasting a keylime cheesecake at a nearby famous bakery in NYC and I was very, very pleased by the results. I made this cake as a makeup gift to my beau and he absolutely, positively loved it! Actually, I made grilled lamb chops, homemade garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed some greenbeans with garlic for the main course. This was a PERFECT way to end the meal. We haven't argued since (hehe). Enjoy! Dee 32yrs old No formal culinary training Discriminating palate

Great cheesecake, wonderfully tart and not too sweet, not too rich, just perfect. The crust is to die for, and the whole thing was easy to make.

I have made this cheesecake about 5 times already. Everyone really loves it. I've never made cheesecake from scratch before, so I was surprised to see how runny it turned out. I don't know if it's suppose to look that way or if it's because I'm at an elevation of 4500. The last time I made it, I added a little bit of corn starch and cooked it for an hour. It set up a little bit more, but not a ton. One of the times I made it, the water leaked into my cheesecake and made the crust all soggy. Although the inside was still good, it just wasn't appetizing to look at. I've made this cheesecake with the water bath on the rack below and it turns out exactly the same (minus the soggy crust). Everyone raved about this cheesecake.

First, I don't like cheesecake and I was disgusted at the thought of putting sour cream on a cheesecake but I bit the bullet and bowed to the Epicureans.

It took me two hours, start to finish to make this, but it was PERFECT. Trust the recipe and GO FOR IT... you WILL NOT be sorry!

i've had some trouble with cheesecakes in the past, but this turned out (nearly) perfectly. a fantastic hybrid of key lime pie (often too tart) and cheesecake (often too rich). i made the custard as directed, cut back on the butter in the crust and used a little extra lime juice to hold it together. i had to use bottled key lime juice (no key limes, even in florida!), and used one pkg 1/3 less fat cream cheese and 8oz mascarpone for the filing. i didn't want to deal with a leaky water bath, so baked it a little longer at 300. delicious!

This is very, very good. However, did anyone else experience melted butter runoff onto the outside bottom of the springform pan? The only source I could think of was the crust, which requires more butter than I have ever used for a graham cracker crust. I wrapped the pan in heavy-duty aluminum foil, but I did NOT bake the cheesecake in a water bath. Instead, I placed a 9 x 13 pan filled half-way with hot water directly underneath the cheesecake to prevent cake cracking. When I removed the foil, it was very apparent that melted butter seeped out. Any similar experiences out there?

This was good, but a little too tame. I would use lots more lime in the cheesecake layer. I think most people would love this, but in our house we like our lime to be intense. This one just didn't measure up. Kind of fluffy lime instead of that biting key lime taste we love.

heavenly... exceptionally delicious. I used real key lime juice and zest from regular limes. the best cheesecake we've ever eaten.

This was my first cheesecake and it was fantastic, it's not hard to make at all. Cover it well with the foil! I had a leak on my baking pan, but a very small one and the cake came out fine. Everyone loved this cake, I will definitely make it again! If you don't like EXTREMELY sweet things, you can cut in the sugar A LOT, I loved it, but it was too sweet for some people.

I made this for Thanksgiving (my first cheesecake ever) and it came out great. I didn't change anything from the recipe except I used regular limes since my supermarket did not have key limes.

this cheesecake is FABULOUS! I messed up and stirred the sour cream into the mixture, then to make up for the mistake, I still baked the cheesecake in a water bath, but turned off the oven after 30 minutes and let it sit in hot oven for 1 hour. When I removed it, it was fine. I would make it the "messed up" way again!

So delicious! A lot of work, but worth it. Let it chill for at least two days. It's best at 4 or even 5 days. Regular limes worked fine. Must be great with real key limes, though!

Incredible!!! I made this cheesecake for a party with a Caribbean theme. It was so good after a spicy menu! I did not juice the limes but rather purchased Key Lime Juice at my local gourmet grocer. I did use regular limes for the zest. I actually froze it for a few days before defrosting and serving. I added whip cream to the top and served. It was incredible and I will make again and again....

I mistakenly folded the sour cream into the filling. Then I baked for 30 min, turned off oven and let sit in hot oven for one hour. The recipe turned out delicious. Better than Cheesecake Factory!

To get the most out of the key limes put them in a bowl and microwave for 15 to 20 seconds. Then just cut a small X in the end of the lime and squeeze over a bowl. You get the most juice with the least effort! I also modified by adding a little vanilla to the sour cream and using salted butter and not adding any extra salt to the crust.

This is wonderful. Every time I make this people want the recipe! I never get leftovers! It is a lot of work but well worth it.

This cheesecake is good, but...not a "4" as others have indicated without modifications. I did not read other readers tips prior to starting and wish I had! The keylime juicing and grating it very tedious, don't take it on unless you have a fair amount of time. I'd probably buy the bottled juice instead. My cheesecake did not get the height of the beautiful photo shown here, either. Also be very careful to really make your pan watertight. Mine did get a leak, but did not ruin the cake. All in all, a lot of work and I'll bet I can find a lot of other similar recipes without the pain- factor. If you have the energy, go for it, and you'll enjoy the result of your effort, however!

THIS IS A FABULOUS RECIPE. MADE IT FOR A FAMILY MEMORIAL DAY PARTY AND EVERYONE LOVED IT, EVEN THE KIDS! IT IS TIME INTENSIVE WHEN YOU HAVE TO JUICE ALL THE LIMES, BUT ONCE YOU TASTE IT , YOU WILL REMIND YOURSELF THAT IT WAS WORTH THE WORK! DEFINATELY I WILL MAKE AGAIN TO DAZZLE A CROWD.

Absolutely perfect for key lime lovers. For those of you giving up on squeezing key limes, a hand juicer with a sieve works wonderfully. I had the juice I needed within 5 minutes. I would not change a thing about this recipe.

Very good! Regarding previous comments, I did use salt in the crust and it provided a nice counterpoint to the sweetness. I used fresh lime juice but substituted neufchatel (reduced fat) cream cheese and lower fat sour cream. I will make this again. Came out perfectly !

The flavours came together well and tasted fantastic. I gave up on squeezing all those little limes and used bottled lime juice instead. I also didn't foil my pan or use a water bath. What kind of pan can you use for a water bath that is deep enough? It turned out fine without that method - could have been slightly firmer though.

My first cheesecake and it turned out exceptional! This was the only dish to disappear at the potluck I brought it to. I accidently only bought 1 8oz container of sour cream, so I modified the recipe and added an additional 8oz package of cream cheese I had at home to the filling (along with a couple extra splashes on lime juice). It took a little longer to bake (approx. 1 hr.) but still turned out delicious. I used only one 8oz container of sour cream for the topping, possibly an alternative for those skeptical about the sour cream topping.

Im convinced that his proposal was a result of this recipe. I really enjoy it too, but the beau goes bonkers when I make it. It combines best elements of 2 already killer desserts  key lime pie & sour cream cheesecake. Stellar, and well worth the PITA of zesting and juicing those teeny leetle key limes. Look how big a slice he took last time I made it! :D http://a560.ac- images.myspacecdn.co m/images01/47/l_9a70 4c2e78c834f1e3f80de2 68d0dc17.jpg

Made this for my book club and got rave reviews. Didn't use salt in the crust, and used regular limes instead of key limes, and it was still terrific. For me, the sour cream topping is perhaps too much -- I'll use a bit less next time and add vanilla to it too to make it more flavorful. Overall this is a winner.

FANTASTIC! Made for Easter dinner and it was a huge hit.

Good recipe, but 10 minutes is not long enough for the cheesecake to cool before removing the springform pan. Half of the graham cracker crust came off with the pan because the cheesecake wasn't cooled enough.

I made this for a Palm Sunday dinner we have every year. It got rave reviews! This will be my go to Key Lime dessert from now on. I use'd Nellie and Joe's key lime juice. I may have threw in just a little more than the requested measure in both the custard and the filling...a few heaping overflowing tablespoons. It was perfect. Based on the other reviews I did not add ANY salt to the crust. In fact when checking several of my other cheesecake crusts with graham crackers, salt was never in the crust recipe. I also put a splash of vanilla in the filling and the sour cream topping. This is an excellent and pretty cheesecake, esp with the 3 layers you see when you cut into it. You will enjoy this!!!

We made the crust with gluten-free ginger-snaps from Trader Joe's. Added 1 stick of butter, and it was waaay too much for my (generous) 2 cups of crumbs. Butter oozed out like a sponge and when cooked, the entire crust puffed up into a buttery mess of crumbs. Not sure if it was just the fact that they were gluten-free, but we scraped out the buttery crust and mixed it with an additional 1.5 cups crumbs to obtain the right crust consistency. The custard was worth grating every tiny key lime. If you're making this with GF cookies, my advice would be to reduce the butter by half in the crust. Other addition: buy a bag of ginger people ginger chews, melt them over the stove, and drizzle your "ginger-caramel" on top of the cake like a glaze, as an alternative to sour cream. Elegant and delicious!

This was kind of tedious to make with those little limes,but my sons helped squeeze and it turned out very tasty. I thought it was a bit too sweet, but my sons just loved it! I used 1 c. ginger snap crumbs and 3/4 c. graham crackers. It added a bit of zip to the crust.

Delicious. Who has time to squeeze those tiny limes when Nellie and Joe's makes a fabulous bottled key lime juice? I only had a 10 inch pan and it worked fine with the same ratio of ingredients. I would make this again and I don't like to bake or have a real sweet tooth.

everyone loved this! cheated w/store bought crust, and only had 8 oz. of sour cream so had to 1/2 the topping. I'll let the lime custard cool more next time; it got sloshed around a bit when I poured the cheesecake part on top. still, it came out terrific, and I'll definitely be makng it again.

What makes this recipe so exceptional is the lime custard on the bottom, which makes it seem like you're not only eating cheesecake but key lime pie, too. My husband, who is very indifferent to cheesecake but loves key lime pie, raved about this recipe and said it was his favorite dish of a special meal I made for company (including several other epicurious recipes). I used a 9-inch springform pan and increased the lime custard and filling each by half. I made the crust as is (only decreasing the amount of salt as other reviewers suggested), which made an amply sized crust. The resulting proportions seemed perfect to me. This is an intelligently written recipe and is definitely a keeper.

A wonderful recipe. I made this for our gourmet group last night and it got rave reviews. I made my crust out of an almond granola which was delicious. Squeezing and grating those little seedy limes is a chore but the result is worth it!

I brought this into the office and everyone was in love! I think cooking the cake in the steam bath definitely added to the creaminess. I also piped whipped cream dots along the upper rim of the cake since my crust was a little uneven - it was a very pretty touch. I also used the garlic press for the limes, but after going through about 20 key limes I will be using regular limes next time I make this

I made this cheesecake for my husband's birthday. I would definitely make it again. It was so good. I tripled the recipe for the cheesecake and doubled the key lime curd because I made a 10" cake and like my cheesecakes high. It got raves.

Just use salted butter instead of adding salt. It adds just the right amount of salt to the crust!

This cheesecake was great. I added only a pinch of salt to the crust, as another member indicated. I also added an extra tablespoon of key lime juice to the cheesecake -after juicing those little limes, I wasn't wasting a drop. I did use the sour cream topping, but I only piped a 2 inch border around the top and it worked really well. I wouldn't let the curd cool all the way to room temp - it seized up and became very difficult to spread. Any suggestions?

My friend loves key limes, so every year I try to make him something using them for his birthday. I found this recipe and liked the fact that it had both a filling and a custard/curd. Even though I gave it to him as a gift, I made sure I got at least a small piece. It was outstanding. Very unique, and simple to make. I will make this for family events. I did however take one reviewer's comment and used half the salt for the crust (most graham crusts don't even take any salt). Now if someone could tell me a quicker, easier way to juice those tiny key limes! (my garlic press didn't work).

We made this exactly as written, no substitutions. Big mistake. I wasn't even thinking when we added the 1/2 tsp salt to the graham cracker crust. Wow! Salty. Aside from that glaring mistake, the cheesecake was a lot of work for little return. The custard filling was nice, but the rest of the cake was actually a bit bland.

I made this cheesecake for Easter. Apparently, everyone really liked it because I did not even get a piece of my own dessert. It's a good thing I had a second, backup dessert - another Bon Appetit dessert - Tiramisu with Brandy Custard! I will make the cheesecake again, and hope that I get a slice,

Wow. everyone raved about these! I changed it a little - made it in mini-muffin tins, used vanilla wafer crumbs for the crust, and skipped the sour cream topping. (they cooked faster than I'd expected). I topped the mini-cheesecakes with fresh rapsberries, based on the suggestion of another reviewer. Next time, I'll use a garlic press to squeeze the key limes - the limes fit perfectly, and it will save time. I can't wait to make this again!

This recipe was a hit at my recent Bunco night. I am a big cheesecake fan and was looking for something to do with the bags of key limes I'd just purchased. The lime curd is a great touch--something I'd never seen before in a cheesecake! But, it definitely added another, tasty layer to the cake. I made the cheesecake two days ahead of the party and it kept in the refrigerator just fine. The tips (Cheesecake Chops) that appeared on the same page as the recipe in the magazine were helpful, too. I made the recipe just as it was published and was very pleased with the results. I would definitely make this again.

Absolutely delicious, and this from a non-cheesecake fan. I made this because I had bought some key limes on a whim and at the same time needed something to bring to a family birthday that I could make in advance (2 days actually). I made a shortbread crust (baked first) which complemented the curd beautifully. Incidentally I loved the lime curd and it totally makes this recipe extraordinarily special. I was afraid that the sour cream topping was a bit generous but it harmonized beautifully with the other flavors. I would definately make this again.

OUTSTANDING! I used Ginger Snaps instead of ordinary graham crackers for the crust and it lent a much more sophisticated taste. I also purchased frozen raspberries in syrup, thawed the container, and served each piece of cheesecake in a pool of raspberry sauce. I made this to accompany a winter "soup luncheon" for a dozen women and everyone loved it.

I made this cheesecake soon after the magazine came last fall. Our guests absolutely loved it and several asked the for the recipe. I had another request for the recipe last week, and was happy to see that it is now on Epicurious, since I can't fine the magazine now. I don't remember making any particular changes to the recipe, so I'll keep making it as written.

This cheesecake is very good but not great. I liked the lime curd and thought that made the cheesecake more unusual and special. I reduced the sugar just a little bit but I think you could reduce it even more. I would also reduce the amount of sour cream on the top and add less sugar to the sour cream to get a nice tart contrast. Despite these comments, my guests really liked it and asked for seconds. I bet epicurious cooks can refine it to perfection.
