Let me preface this review by saying that I eat peanut butter out of the jar with a spoon. So the fact that this was way too peanut butter-y for me is saying a lot. I made it exactly as written, except I chopped up some of the habanaro for more spice. Its a good starting point though, I just think it needs&something. Maybe some raisins added in the last 30 minutes, maybe more tomato paste. It definitely needed more broth/water. As written, it was too heavy and too rich.

We've always done it with pork and it's also good that way. We spike it up a bit too because we like spicy foods.

Be careful, because after one and a half hours, the liquid reduces quite a bit. I had to add more broth later or it would've been a paste, but it had no effect on the flavor. This was tasty, but something was missing... I think it needed some sweetness to bring out the peanut taste, something in the "middle" to draw it all together. I added raisins to my bowl when I ate it, but yams would be great in this-- diced up. Dont forget to USE NATURAL peanut butter, the hippy kind.... Jif and stuff wont work so good.

A good beginning, but I think this could use some kicking up. I used all beef broth rather than beef broth & water, used hot sauce in place of my jalapenos which had grown white fuzz in the crisper, and substituted celery and corn for peas and carrots, never two of my favourite veggies. I also reduced the peanut butter (Peter Pan) down to 1/2 cup, and we could just barely taste it. Next time I'll add the full 3/4 cup, some other spices (thyme, coriander?) and crush some garlic to saute` with the lamb & onions. This would work with pork as well.

Made it for my father-in-law, he liked it. What else does a son-in-law need to say.

My husband lived in Mali, West Africa for several years and said this stew reminded him of a dish he ate there frequently. We used a habanero pepper and let the stew simmer for about 1.5 to 2 hours. The extra cooking time seemed to help bring out the flavor. It was great!

This recipe bears a startling resemblance to West African mafe (stew with lamb or beef and pureed peanuts). It's a great modification of mafe, with ingredients that you can find in any supermarket. Very hearty, satisfying, and authentic.

I added the chilies with the onions and the meat. The result was tasty, flavorful and filling.It was excellent the next day.

Really delicious & pretty easy to make. Made it with chicken broth, used olive oil instead of peanut oil (because that's what was on hand), used other reviewers' suggestion on mincing one of the jalapenos & sauteing it with the onion, and served with chopped cilantro to garnish. I used crunchy peanut butter & the added texture was great. Got rave reviews from my family & am making it again this weekend for friends.

Wonderful stew. Very filling with all of the peanut butter... I stayed pretty true to the recipe and served the stew over white rice.

This is a fabulous stew. I took suggestions from previous reviewers and sauteed one of the jalepanos with the onions in addition to chopping one of the whole ones up after it was cooked in the stew and putting it back in. I doubled the vegetables, adding a few different types. It's great served with couscous.

Very good! We bought pre-cubed lamb, and it was SO easy with great results.

i actually used chicken & chicken broth for this stew and it came out pretty well. i took the advise of the previous respondents and chopped the jalapenos and added them to the stew. i think i will try this again but add more veggies & some cilantro at the end. overall, it is pretty tasty.

Loved it. I ended up chopping up the jalapenos and tossing them back into the stew, because after cooking their heat had dissipated. Next time I make it, I probably won't seed one of the peppers. Also, I added a whole 10 oz. package of peas (about 2 cups) after the stew was done, allowing the heat of the dish to bring them to temperature.

This needs 2 - 4 cloves of minced garlic, and I would probably finely chop/mince one of the habeneras to cook with the garlic & onion to add to the "zip".
