Had this at an upscale restaurant last night. Delecious, could have done without the Dulce De Leche or only a table spoon. Going to make it for the fam tonight with bounty of corn.

Really nice and remarkably easy dish for someone with no gelatin experience. I substituted 1/2 & 1/2 for the part of the heavy cream to lighten it a little and it was delicious. I don't think I would have wanted it any richer. Also sprinkled some smoked welsh sea salt (Halen Mon) to the top of the caramel/corn when served.

A little too heavy on the mouth-feel in my opinion. And it's not quite sweet enough, tastes almost savory with out the dulce de leche. Next time I would replace half the cream with milk and add a tad more sugar.
