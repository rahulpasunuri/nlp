A little heavy on the oil. I didn't have a lemon and used balsamic vinegar until it tasted right. We thought it was very good.

Yuck. Way too much oil. Try a different recipe! I had to tweak this one beyond recognition; it was too much oil for the other ingredients. Zero forks.

I have made this quick and tasty dressing several times over and use it not only on salad greens, but avocado and in a wheatberry salad.

My husband thought the predominant taste was the oil - he couldn't taste the honey or the mustard. Store bought dressings taste better.

This recipe should read juice of 1/3 of a lemon. I had to more than double the mustard, oil and honey. If you really want to try this, add the lemon juice a tablespoon at a time and taste it!

Fresh and delicious! I double the honey for a slightly less tangy taste.

Nice and tangy, use sparingly. I followed the recipe exactly and we like it.
