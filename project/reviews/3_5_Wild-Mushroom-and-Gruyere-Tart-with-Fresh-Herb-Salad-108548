I made this for friends and I was a little disappointed. I prebaked the crust and it was still soggy. I also didn't think the flavor were particularly a WOW. My husband and friends said they really liked it. I think it was almost too much 'stuff' on top of the puff pastry.

I made mine in a pie shell, rather than use a pastry crust and it came out fabulously. I think the key was cooking the mushrooms till they were dry.

This is a fabulous recipe. I used light sour cream (drained) instead of creme fraiche, doubled the fresh thyme, forgot the scallions, but did add about a teaspoon of finely minced garlic to the mushroom mixture for a little extra oomph.

Took this as an appetizer to celebrate Bastille Day for a true French dinner. I found small 6" square Puff Pastry that worked great. Didn't pre bake and they weren't soggy. I was careful not to overload in the center. Be sure to caramelize onions to add on top after baking. I served them room temperature and everyone raved. Even warmed up the next morning for bfast---very nice!

As suggested by others, I prebaked the pastry, which was a good idea. I skipped the salad and thought it was divine on its own.

The Herbs on top are absolutly necessary to this recipe. Suzanne Goin is one of my favorite chefs in America, and every recipe of hers is perfection. I agree that the pastry can get soggy if not cooked enough. I have made this several times for parties and have had rave reviews. Use the herbs she suggests for the salad, as the flavors are perfect with the tart.

I made this awhile back and had horrid results. I spent quite a bit of time picking my ingredients and spent a small fortune on them - it just looked like a mess and in my opinion, wasn't worth the time and money. To add insult to injury, I served it at a dinner party and nobody took a second piece.

I found this recipe to be very confusing. I only wanted to make the tart, and the salad directions were interspersed with those instructions on my iphone. I downloaded a shopping list - same problem. I'd like to see the recipes separated. I did not prebake the crust as suggested by other readers. Very soggy! I substituted shards of parmigiano reggiano for the gruyere - lovely replacement!

I made this for a party. I didn't have fresh thyme on hand so I used some dried fines herbs when sauteeing the mushrooms. The flavors of the base, mushrooms and cheese go great together. My puff pastry was soggy though, next time I will prebake it before topping.

Seriously this is amazing!! It is absolutely essential, however, to pre-bake the puff pastry and to serve it pretty much right away. I make it for everyone that tells me they don't like mushrooms. Sure. Sure you don't.

What a delicious tart! I will definataly make this again! I baked it until it was about 3/4 of the way done to take to a party where I finished baking it. I didn't have ricotta so I used a 5 oz log of goat cheese in istead. Also, I used leek in place of the onion. Like another reviewer suggested, I cut the puff pastry in half and made two small tarts instead of one big. Very delicious and a huge hit at our party!!!

This recipe yields a flaky, rustic tart with a rich, earthy filling. The greens are light and lemony to offset richness of the tart. You can use any greens in place of the parsley, arugula and bitter baby greens work well. If you don't like ricotta, you can increase the sour cream to 3/4c and add an extra egg for a tart that is still excellent and tastes similar to the original recipe. Also, Trader Joe's puff pastry uses all butter recipe and yields a much better result than the pepperidge farm puff pastry.

Very good. I would use more thyme in the tart. I will also shred the gruyere next time. I cooked the mushrooms and prepared the ricotta several hours ahead.

Served this over fresh greens for my book club! Everyone raved. Took into account past reviews, i.e. baked the pastry. I agree no need to use creme fraiche. I bought some and forgot to add to the ricotta mixture. I will make this again and again.

This tart is wonderful, but the fresh herb salad is an unnecessary addition.

Thought this was fantastic. I also pre-baked the crust for five minutes and cut the dough into two sections.

Fabulously delicious and definitely a keeper. Easy enough to make ahead and then assemble and pop in the oven for guests. I'm experimenting freezing two uncooked portions (does creme fraiche freeze? I guess I'll find out). I followed the recipe exactly (as I always try to do the first time). I did make two simple changes: grated the cheese, split the dough into 8 servings instead of one tart. Unfortunately no herb salad - until I find some chervil! I really would like to try it with the herb salad but used boston lettuce instead. The tarts turned out exactly like the picture and despite the fact I do not have a convection oven I had no problems with soggy dough. I did make sure to cook the mushrooms until dry. Chantarelles were on sale so I used only those. I forgot to try the sea salt sprinkle - but hey there are some more tarts waiting for me in the kitchen since this was just a trial run! Definitely one for the mushroom lover. And definitely not low fat!

Rating: 0
Wonderful!! You can save time by not using a processor...just whip the ricotta and sour cream by hand. Also, roll out the dough on the HEAVY baking pan and pop into the fridge while you're preparing everything as it needs to keep cold. A convection oven makes the crust crispy. A tiny bit of sea salt sprinkled over the cooked tart makes the flavors all come out. This one is a keeper.

I wish I had read the reviews prior to making this recipe! :( The flavors were fabulous; I used oyster, baby portabellas and regular sliced mushrooms. My local store was limited in choices. Next time I will pre-bake the puff pastry for 10-15 minutes and I'd already grated the gruyere for ease in spreading it evenly. I loved the idea to cut the pastry into individual serving sizes, and that might have helped those cooks who achieved a "no-soggy" bottom. It also probably looked more professionally made. I used a fresh spring greens salad and my friends "stand over the salad bowl and create as I go" salad dressing - EVOO, red wine vinegar and her special seasonings! Beautiful presentation, despite soggy bottom, lovely flavors and second helpings around the table!

Really very good. I used crimini, oyster and portabellos. Next time I'll use less portabello, the results were very very earthy - perfect for an appetizer, but a bit much for a main.

I made this as an appetizer for Mother's Day dinner and it turned out beautifully. The combination of mushrooms was delish and the puff pastry tart was crisp. The contrast of textures was wonderful and I would make this again in the blink of an eye. I found it to be a bit time consuming but well worth the effort. SCRUMPTIOUS!!

I cut the puff pastry into squares, pre-baked for 5 minutes, and used regular sliced mushrooms. It was amazing.

I will use a tart pan next time, much easier. Or I'll use individual tart pans. Just couldn't get the puff pastry to roll out for me. I shredded the gruyere after reading your comments and I browned the puff pastry 15 minutes before adding the filling and the mushroom mixture--delish! Will definitely make again as my husband absolutely loved it.

These Mushroom Tarts received raves from dinner guests! Like previous cook, I baked the pastry first. Would make this again in a heartbeat, and I have some duck confit in the fridge that would be wonderful on top!

After reading all the comments I made some substantial changes in this with great results. I used Cook's Illustrated's base puff pastry tart for the "easy tomato tart" recipe. Not soggy at all. I added a cup of wine to the mushrooms. I added caramelized onions. I didn't do this in two layers but just topped the ricotta mixture, mushrooms and onions with cheese. Turned out wonderfully. Since I did not try this a written (seems like many did to bad results) I can't say how it would have turned out.

Rating: 4
With a few changes (by listening to other reveiwers) this is a fabulous dish! Beautiful too! 1)Strain the Ricotta first 2)saute the mushrooms unitl juice evaporates, which takes 15 mins. at least 3)carmelize onion rings to place on top of each tart 4)i cut the pastry into individual squares 4inches wide and baked them beforehand for 6 mins. so the dough wouldn't be soggy. Everyone at the party loved these, even the men still talk about them! So give it a try!!!!

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and made smaller tarts. And I shredded the gruyere instead of slicing it. The tarts looked beautiful. But, to my extreme disappointment, they tasted terrible. The combination of mushrooms I used (chantrelle, porcini, shitake) ended up having a "muddy" flavor when cooked together. Maybe I should have used oyster mushrooms instead of the porcini...or just one kind of mushroom. But this was such an expensive experiment that I won't try it again, even with different mushrooms.

Rating: 3
Mmm, this recipe was delicious but I think it was due to the ingredients I used (cave-aged Gruyere, fresh ricotta and the best mushrooms I could find). I used a mix of portabello, shittake, crimini and yellow and blue chanterelles. I only gave it 3 forks because I think it would have been better if I had cut the pastry into smaller pieces so each slice could have some crust. the pieces in the middle of the tart were a little difficult to handle.

Rating: 4
4 stars !!! To the cook from St. Paul, you have to cook the mushrooms until dry. And there's no need to pre-bake the puff pastry, cooking in a convection oven browns the tart beautifully. I am a personal chef and this is a client favorite. Can also be made in a tart pan for a less free-form look.

Rating: 1
This was bad. Really bad. I had high hopes for this recipe based on the ratings. But . . . I made two tarts using both of the puff pastry sheets that come in a package. The mushroom mixture looked and tasted great. And I prebaked the tart shells based on a number of suggestions from the reviews. I used a slotted spoon to drain the mushrooms before adding to the tart. But the moment I put the mushroom mixture on the tart shell, most of the tart shell instantaneously turned to glop. That word sums it up completely. Slimy gummy glop. Inedible. I tried to layer the second shell with cheese to insulate it from the moist mushrooms to no avail. I was able to salvage a little bit of the tart along the edges that stayed a little bit drier. I don't think this would have worked even if I had cooked down the mushrooms more. All in all, a very expensive experiment.

Rating: 3
This was really good. I had to double the ingredients for the ricotta layer. Also, took the advice about baking the unfilled pastry crust for 10 minutes and then layering. I had to actually let the pastry stand for 30 minutes because my guests were late. Just popped it back into a hot (450 degree) oven for 7 minutes and voila...perfect!

Rating: 3
This was really good. I plan to serve this as an appetizer for my next dinner party but I will make just a few cosmetic changes. I will cut the pastry into the number of servings instead of cutting from one large tart. I will also put all of the cheese in the middle layer. The slices placed on top did not melt completely and looked like what they were 'slices' of cheese curled around the edges. The salad portion was great. I made a larger herb salad and had this for dinner.

Rating: 4
I have made this tart many times and have finally had the crust turn out perfect -- I rolled the puff pastry as directed but then cut it into quarters (so that there are four squares), scored the middle a few times and baked for 10-15 minutes until lightly golden, let cool for 5 minutes, add the mushroom mixture and baked for 15 minutes. No soggy crust!

Rating: 3
based on the recipe and the reviews, i really thought this was going to be a 4 forker. and i really enjoyed it, but it was missing something - maybe i'll try the white wine in the mushrooms idea and add some more herbs to them. i made it with a mix of oyster, cremini, and shitakes. my crust was soggy like everyone elses. NEXT time, i am going to definitely pre-bake the puff pastry. and i'd really like to try it with smoked gouda. and yes there i was a lot of filling (although i put it all on), but you could use the extra in an omelet - yumyum!

Everyone at our party really loved this, and I loved the left-overs. A few things: don't waste the time and money on the creme fraiche VERY subtle taste difference and texture from sour cream, would not be missed in the mix of pungent mushrooms and cheese. I did not make the crust, as I just didn't have time. I made two tarts, both with ready-made crusts. One I made in a standard tart tin, the other I made in a cake pan and folded all of the excess dough in over the top. This presentation looked wonderful, like a rustic tart tatin. In spite of the store-bought crust, people raved about the crusts (many of these people went to culinary school with me, too, so not slouches on their crust-judging). I will make this again, as it is a very nice addition to our christmas party as a vegetarian option. Oh, I used a mix of crimini, oyster, shitake, chanterelle and portabella mushrooms. More mushrooms makes better flavor.

GREAT recipe! I made this for a party and it was gone within minutes. Everyone was asking for the recipe. My husband even had seconds but there weren't any! The flavors were were a nice balance. Will definitely make this again.

This tastes wonderful. I used half criminis and half shiitakes, and served it with a salad of mixed greens dressed with a Balsamic vinaigrette, instead of the herbs. My puff pastry also was mushy in the middle, so I think I'll try this again with a pastry crust (prebaked first) or with pizza dough instead.

Just made this last weekend when we were snowed in here is the Northeast. This was fabulous. Didn't follow the recipe diligently however b/c I had no puff pastry - used crescent roll dough rolled thin in its place. Fabulous! Be sure to use the Gruyere cheese, the taste simply cannot be beat. Used a bit more than called for (we love cheese). The herb salad is a must- it cuts the richness of the tart and adds brightness to the flavors.

Rating: 4
Great recipe! I took the tart to a dinner party and had to prepare everything the day before. I prepared the puff pastry according to the directions and cooked it at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes (until golden brown). I also cooked the mushrooms and prepared the ricotta mixture in advance. The day of the party I assembled and baked the tart, then reheated it at the party. I think pre-baking the puff pastry helped keep it crispy.

Rating: 3
I too had a bit of a soggy crust in the center. Could have been from the mushrooms or maybe the dough was too thin in the middle. It was delicious and everyone loved it, soggy or not. I will try this again using two smaller baking sheets.

This tasted wonderful, but my crust was nothing more than a gooey glob in the middle. The edges were lovely, however. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I want to try this one again. I think my baking sheet may have been too heavy, but it seemed like the moisture from the filling prevented the pastry from browning in the middle. Anyone else have this problem?

I loved this recipe, but only after I made a few modifications to make it a little more interesting. I caramelized a couple onions, and spread those on the puff pastry, and then I alternated the gruyere and mushrooms (I used fresh chanterelles) on top. I sauteed the mushrooms in some white wine, which added a lovely flavour. I loved the flakiness of the crust. My friends raved about this recipe. The onions and white wine were really central though. I served it with a salad of mixed greens, pears and raisins and a maple-balsamic vinaigrette.

This is an excellent recipe. I made it several times and it was a hit. I modified the recipe slightly by cutting the mushrooms to small pieces by pulsing them for few seconds in the food processor. That way the mushroom layers become more uniform

Had the girls for lunch and it was perfect with my salad (not this recipe) and butternut squash soup! I enjoyed it hot - when it was cold it wasn't so great! Make sure you cook all of the water from the shrooms - maybe that is why some had soggy crusts(?)...love the roasted red pepper and carmelized onion idea! My husband doesn't care for mushrooms so I am going to try that next.

Delicious. A bit time consuming but a very nice recipe. I prepared the ricotta mixture and the sauteed mushrooms ahead of time and put the tart together just before guests arrived and it worked very well.

I made this with caramelized onions instead of mushrooms, because one of our guests is an avid mushroom hater (no, she's not invited often). It worked out really well. One little tip: I didn't pay close enough attention to the bit about scoring the pastry just halfway through, and so when anyone went to pick up the sliced tart the edges just fell right off. Oops!

I made these as individual 2" tartlets for a wine tasting party. Since I was using both sheets of puff pastry, I doubled the recipe for the filling...and ended up with two times more filling than I needed. So for future note: individual tarts take much less filling than one large one! They finished in the oven in about 15 minutes. They turned out beautifully, tasted delicious, and paired wonderfully with the medium-bodied red blends we were pouring at the wine tasting. I'll definitely be making more with the leftover filling!

Rating: 3
My husband picked some fresh chanterelles in the woods near us and we used them in this recipe (after checking with a mushroom expert!!). The mushrooms were wonderful, but I thought the filling was too much for the puff pastry crust. I will definitely make it again, but reduce the filling somewhat.

Rating: 3
A big warning to all you other starving students out there - this is a VERY pricey recipe! The mushrooms will run you $15, the pastry $10, and don't get me started on the cheese... Kind of a lot for an appetizer in my opinion. That said, if you like rich savory pastries, this is your dish. It doesn't take very long and it it's beautiful and tastes good. I baked the pastry dough for about five minutes before I threw everything on (it puffed up a bit, sank down after I removed it and then puffed again when I put it back in). I had no problems with soggy crust. The herb salad was kind of a waste of time and good luck finding chives AND chervil at the same store, but it looked awful purdy (I threw in some pomegranate seeds). Served it with the curried squash soup with frizzled leeks, and it went very well.

This was absolutely delicious! It was a huge hit amongst all of my guests! I would definitely make it again.

I think I will grate it next time.

I loved this tart, but also had trouble with the bottom crust being doughy (tho, truthfully, none of my guests seemed to mind at all). Does anyone have suggestions on how to prevent this in the future? I did put an egg white wash on the crust before putting the mushrooms, etc on, but maybe I should have popped the crust in a hot oven for just a moment before putting anything else on it.

Served this with roasted tomato soup - excellent! I could only find a pre-packaged mix of crimini, oyster and shitake for the mushrooms & was a little worried about there being too much water (from the crimini) - so I just cooked it a bit longer in the pan - which turned out fine. The only thing I would do diferently next time is to make individual tarts - the crispy puff pastry on the edges is so good that I would want more of it.

I made this dish as 6 individual tartletts, and it worked out well. I did, however, flambe my mushrooms with a splash of Cognac. I realize it's not practical for everyone, but I remember when Gourmet and Bon Appetite magazines would write the recipes to include the puff pastry-from-scratch, and merely suggest store-bought as an alternative. Oh well, to quote Stephen King, "the world has moved on."
