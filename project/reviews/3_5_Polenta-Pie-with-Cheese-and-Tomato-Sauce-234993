I had never worked with packaged polenta and was skeptical of the outcome. But this recipe was really great. And so easy. Popped up bottle sauce with a little red wine reduction and wow! So good.

This one didn't do anything for me. I like the convenience aspect of using a ready-made polenta roll, but I wasn't thrilled with the texture and taste of this recipe.

I forgot! Definitely use between 1/3 and 1/2 of of the jar of sauce. Mine was perfect but only because I skimped on the sauce.

SO GOOD!!! And so easy. We used cheddar instead of mozzerella and layer raw chopped spinach in between sauce and cheese layers. I would eat this everyday, and I am convinced you could sneak even more veggies in and kids would still love it too.

We love polenta but prefer it grilled, so I made a few modifications - I grilled the slices of polenta, added grilled slices of Sicilian eggplant and grilled sweet peppers. I put the eggplant in one layer over the base polenta slices with the grilled peppers on top of the eggplant. Other than that followed the recipe as it's written. The grilling added a wonderful depth of flavour to the dish. All in all a big hit and a new favourite.

I tried a hybrid of this recipe with a ratatouille filling instead of the sauce. Really good!

to the reviewer who said it was too soupy, you only need to use half the jar in the middle layer, not the whole jar. no sauce on top, just a little on the side if you want a little more. wonderful!

I agree that if you use a jar of sauce, it is way too much liquid in this recipe. I added sauteed fresh spinach, mushrooms and olives and it was good, but soupy. If I make this again, I will make my own sauce starting with diced tomatoes and cook it way down until it is quite thick.

This is our new favorite midweek dish. I used a can of garlic and olive oil petite cut tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce and added sauteed baby portobello mushrooms and spinach. The flavor was fantastic although it was a bit juicy. I think I'll mix a teaspoon or two of cornmeal with the tomatoes next time.

This is quick, easy, very good and low in calories. An all around winner!

This was quite good ... and easy. I layered fresh spinach sauteed with shallot and mixed with a little heavy cream beneath the top polenta layer, made my own sauce and used Trader Joe's polenta.

This was so good! Friendly recipe. Such good comfort food in a short amount of time. Served roasted vegies that needed to go from the fridg. Left overs were great. Love the idea of this as a side dish for my vegitarian friend. Csn add shrimp or meat. Guests loved it.

Besides being ridiculously easy to make, this dish lends itself well to leftovers. Got a few mushrooms about to go bad? Toss them in. Ditto with spinach, squash, etc. Love it, love it. Oh, and I've made it several times and never used the recommended sauce. I especially like it with a Puttanesca or Arrabiata.

I think this is a great base recipe where you can add different combinations of veggies to spouse it up. I used mushrooms and spinach because they where what I had. I wouldn't make it without adding some veggie - but that's just my preference.

I used only half the tomato sauce called for, and that was plenty for me. Can't imagine what it would have tasted like with a whole jar. I liked this, but didn't love it. My husband didn't care for it at all, mainly because of the tomato sauce. He thought even half a jar was too much. I might make as a side dish in the future, but not as a main vegetarian course.

Fabulous but make your own polenta. The premade is pretty bad

This was fantastic! My friends absolutely devoured it. I used freshly made polenta instead of packaged stuff and my own tomato sauce. Per other suggestions, I upped the amount of basil and used a lot more cheese - provolone, mozzarella and parmesan. And, yes, the leftovers are fantastic. I'll be adding this to my repertoire!

I made this last night for my boyfriend from memory with great results. Couple of points: (1) this is HEALTHY - polenta is fat free and low cal, and so is tomato sauce; the only fat is the cheese which you can use 2% and cut down on. (2) So quick - maybe 5 minutes to prepare, then 20 in the oven. (3) INEXPESIVE, essentially only 3 ingredients from the store: polenta, sauce and cheese, add a salad and its dinner under $10. My boyfriend's bachelor pad only had ceramic bowls, so I made individual pies. It turned out so good. It's a perfect quick, when-you're-tired, healthy dinner.

Delicious and really easy. Definitely good for leftovers. I have added sliced sauteed eggplant for some vegetable food group representation. This dish makes a meal.

This is a fantastic and easy dish that I will make again. It provides excellent leftovers as well! I used both packaged and fresh mozzarella and more than the recipe calls for. I also layered the top part of the polenta with more sauce and more cheese which gave it a lasagna effect. Yummy!

Fantastic!! Easy, fast, lovely. Good to have something crisp on the side for contrast - I did green beans, but salad would be perfect. It's a keeper!

Very easy, very tasty! I added a bit more cheese and spinach. Will be making this again soon!

Following other reviews, I doubled the basil and used a mix of provolone, mozzarella, and parmesan cheese. It turned out great and was super easy to make! My boyfriend and I ate the whole thing in one seating! I love veggies, so next time I'm going to add chopped artichokes or chopped spinach. I plan to triple and take as a side dish to a large Thanksgiving dinner.

This was a wonderful easy meal when you want good tasting food - but quickly. We added peas b/c that's what we had left over from a previous meal - you could add pretty much anything. It was creamy and just the right consistency. And my 1 year old devoured it.

Made this dish the first time according to the recipe and it was SO easy and delicious. When I made it a second time, I did a Mexican version: chipotle salsa instead of tomato sauce, cilantro instead of basil, and Mexican cheese blend instead of mozzarella and parmesan. It came out great too!

So simple and delicious! I made my own sauce and included chopped kalamata olives and red pepper flakes for a kick. I doubled the parmesan (fresh grated) and used provolone for more flavor.

Mmmm. So good. Served this for dinner last week and my family loved it. My 4 year old keeps asking me to make it again. Definite keeper.

This dish is super easy and delicious. It is a great simple dinner paired with a green salad. I doubled the basil and love the fresh from the garden taste it adds.

This dish is wonderful. My wife is not a fan of polenta , but she absolutely loves this. It is substantial enough to serve 3 to 4 as a light supper if served with a salad. Be sure to use a tomato sauce with little or no added suagr. I also suggest doubling the ammount of mozzarella.

This is okay, but really not substantial enough for dinner. I changed the proportions to three fourths of a 1 kg polenta roll; half pound fresh mozzarella; one large jar sauce; piece of parmesian. That worked fine, but if you are having it for dinner, make it a side with a simple fish, or for lunch with scrambled eggs. It certainly is easy to make.
