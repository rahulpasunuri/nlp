Very moist and tasty. Made it exactly according to the recipe but forgot to brush with melted butter. Put red and orange pepper chunks on the skewers with the meat and served it over basmati rice with grilled naan. With a crisp cucumber salad, it's a great summer dinner.

This was pretty good--seemed authentic. However, it was surprisingly mild. I served it with a choice of tzatziki and mango chutney, and this definitely helped make the chicken a little more interesting.

I made this on Sunday and then re-heated it on Tuesday. I put the chicken on a foil covered tray and covered it with foil. The chicken was perfectly heated and not dry at all. I took a suggestion and served it with roasted cauliflower curry and raita made with garden fresh cucumbers and mint. We had company for dinner and we all loved it.

I thought that the flavor of this dish was okay, but the chicken turned out dry. I don't really know how that's possible seeing as how I marinated the chicken overnight, but I suppose it has something to do with all of the dried spices that were mixed in with the yogurt. Especially becuase my boyfriend hate Indian food, I doubt I'll be making this again.

Good basic marinademost frequently used the chicken, after grilling, with various Indian sauces, but its ok on its own, too. Very simple and produces flavorful, moist chicken if instructions are followed.

This is a great recipe to use as a base. It is slightly bland on it's own, but could be promising with the addition of chili powder or tandoori paste. I skewered these with red and green pepper and the result looked very festive.

I make this recipe all the time for my family and everyone loves it - including the kids. Rather than doing this in kabob form, I use boneless, skinless chicken thighs. I serve it with aromatic yellow rice and flatbread so they can roll it all up together like a soft taco.

A very nice dish for summertime grilling. Serve with basmati rice and a cucumber salad.

A wonderful dish! My husband and I enjoy Indian food, and we really liked this. I didn't even have yogurt on hand and substituted a reduced-fat sour cream, and it turned out fabulous. It's very easy and cooks quickly. I'm making it the next time we have guests.

Absolutely delicious. Next time I will add cayenne because I like heat, but the flavors were still great without the spice. Very easy to put together, even with only an hour of marinading.

Very tasty. I served it to company on my first try with the recipe and it was a hit. I'm keeping this recipe!

I made this last night for dinner using whole chicken breasts for just the 2 of us. I actually made more marinade and saved some for sauce on the side. Changes that I made were more garlic, fresh ginger, increased spice with cayenne and pepper flakes and some tomato paste to enhance color. Served with a spiced basmati and spinach with garlic and ginger. Great meal, visually appealing and very healthy. My sweetie cleaned his plate which is unusual these days as he has new braces and it hurts to chew. Will definitely make again.

I love this recipe and will definitely make it again for guests. When I tasted the chicken, I was actually surprised by the wonderful flavor of the spice combination. I did vary the recipe a bit, however. I added a bit more coriander and turmeric than called for (by mistake). I also used fresh, grated ginger, two extra garlic cloves, cayenne pepper (in lieu of the crushed red) and I doubled the sauce (to have extra for dipping). The result was amazing. I did not find the coriander or any of the other spices to be overwhelming as some of the other reviews suggested. The chicken was so tender, tasty and smelled wonderful. My only recommendation, If you're not a fan of coriander, I would scale back, but if you are, then add more!

This was a great recipe. I made it for the first time yesterday and my boyfriend loved it. Although I didn't use skinless chicken, I think it came out just fine. The skin tastes great when slightly grilled and crispy. I will definitely recommend it to friends and family!

Those of you who said coriander, too much... did you use Fresh coriander leaves??? Ground coriander seeds do not have tremendous imput. Just a lemony flavor.

I made these kabobs on ornate skewers my mother-in-law got from the Middle East so the presentation was as dramatic as the meal itself. I made extra sauce to spoon on saffron rice. I decreased the amount of coriander by alot as per other reviewers recommendations and was glad I did...the bit I used was noticeable but I wouldn't have wanted any more. I also served some raita on the side and there wasn't a bit left on anyone's plate!

An excellent recipe. I had no lemons, so substituted limejuice. Also used double the quantity of chilli powder, and added a tablespoon of tomato puree or paste to give it colour. I brushed the kebabs with olive oil rather than butter, and it seemed to work perfectly. They are perfect prepared in advance, for picnics - just pile them into a ziploc for easy carrying.

Rating: 4
Some of the reviews made me nervous but I thought the kebabs turned out perfectly. I took heed and added 1 tsp. coriander and 1 tsp. garam marsala. It was perfectly spiced. I served with a cucumber yogurt raita, bread and grilled vegie and pineapple kebabs marinated in pineapple juice, oil and salt. Nice sweetness to counter the spice of the chicken. Not a morsel left on any of the plates!

The chicken was good, but blander than we thought it would be - a little time consuming too. I wasn't able to marinade it for as long as required, so I may give this one another chance. (I also used a 1/3 of the required coriander as some of the others suggested).

I wish I had had my Madhur Jaffrey recipe onhand. She seems to be the reigning queen of Indian cuisine (aside from Mamuna Devi). This dish definitely had *way too much* coriander! I'll make tikka again but will significantly reduce the coriander, increase the ginger, and in the meantime I'll probably buy the classic MJ book I lost years ago...Aha! I've found the recipe, after the fact: marinate in lemon juice, then add 6T yogurt, 1 inch ginger, grated, 1/8t cayenne, 3 mashed garlic cloves, 1 t cumin, 1/4 t garam masala - NO CORIANDER...!

Excellent flavor. I made some raita and basmati rice to go with it. YUM!

I was disappointed by this recipe. The chicken had a mealy quality; the marinade had a grainy mouthfeel and never really came together with the meat. It's possible that this was partially my own fault: I used frozen breasts instead of fresh (I was making a lot, and they were on sale) and I suspect that this technique would be better with fresh chicken. Also, I forgot to brush the kebabs with melted butter, and it's possible that this helps the marinade along. On the good side, the spices are spot-on, and the idea of pre-marinating with lemon juice is a good one. I added a thinly sliced jalapeño pepper to the marinade, and I would do that again if I ever made this recipe, which I probably won't. I'm still looking for the perfect tikka kebab recipe... (points to own email address)

Fairly tasty, just way too much coriander for my taste - I could hardly pick up any other flavors. The lemon/yogurt combo kept the chicken tender, it didn't get as dry as breast meat tends to. I would make it again, just changing the spice proportions.

Great chicken dish! I didn't have time to marinate -- only 30 minutes -- but it turned out superb. Everyone asked for the recipe. It's always such a treat to have such a simple to prepare meal taste so good. I actually used soy yogurt because I keep kosher and can't mix meat and milk products in the same meal. I also didn't use butter but an olive oil spray. Served with basmati rice and snap peas with ginger and garlic (epicurious recipe).

I started making this dish from my subscription copy of Bon Appetit in 1990, when we first got our summer house. It has always been a tremendous hit and I have had to make it at least once a summer if not more, ever since. Probably my favorite all-time recipe from fifteen years of Bon Appetit! Yes it's a great deal of work, but you get to cut corners after a while. Like everyone else, I don't bother with the lobster tails and fish is usually too fragile. It makes a ton of food.

The kebabs were really good. I served it as a sandwich with fresh thick pita, tomatos and a yogurt sauce. delicious, made good leftovers for work.

Who could ask for more? This dish is very, very flavorful and a cinch to prepare. It's great grilled or quickly roasted at very high temperature in the oven. Chicken Tikka definitely will become a regular item on our household menu. And we certainly will use the trick of pre-marinating in lemon juice for other grilled dishes.

I found this recipe quick and tasty but the 7 minute cooking time was way off. I had to cook my kebobs almost 20 minutes.

After reading the ingredients, I decided to use my jar of indian curry since it included many of the ingredients listed. It was great! I served it with saffron and pine nut rice, pita bread and mandarine orange green salad. Next time I am going to try coconut milk instead of yogurt.

Tried this recipe for company and liked it. The chicken came out moist but beware of the unappetizing color. Served it with saffron rice with garlic and pine nuts. It has a nice flavor and was not spicy at all.

I tried this recipe as a last-minute dish (as much last-minute as marinating can get!)for a dinner last Thursday. I marinated the chicken for 2 hours instead of the recommended 3, but the result was great. It got rave reviews from our guests. I accompanied it with masala roasted green & red peppers and red onions, basmati rice, dal, raita and papads. The whole meal took me an hour and half to make (excluding marinating time). I plan on making this again soon.

I really wanted to like this recipe but I found the chicken tasted too strongly of lemon. I obtained my lemon juice by juicing a lemon with my juicer (including the rind) - maybe that was my mistake. As I appear to be in the minority, perhaps I'll try it again with less lemon and no rind!

This was a great and easy recipe. Every one in my family loved it (even my incredibly finicky children). The chicken comes out moist. I would make extra sauce which we put over rice. Great for entertaining.

I recently served this at a BBQ along with the Cumin Beef Kebab recipe and a big vegetable tray and it was a big hit! Everyone liked the idea of making their own kebabs and the chicken tikka went over very well - even with some of my Indian friends. I definitely recommend giving this one a try!

This dish is delicious and easy. I modified, however, by tripling the sauce, so there would be extra for the table. Also, rather than barbecue on skewers, I simply stir-fried. Served with couscous. Yummy!

These are wonderful. I've made it with whole chicken breasts and it is just as delicious. The chicken is SO tender.
