This is my go-to recipe for get together and potlucks. I have been working for a catering company for years and I made this for a work event. My boss asked for the recipe. Changes: I add 3oz of of fresh ginger, put it through a food processor Add allspice, pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon 1tsp lemon zest (I usually juice the lemon into the egg right before mixing with the dry ingredients) Add allspice, pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon Instead of making the fruit just a simple apricot jam (preferably a chunky jam) on low heat and add brandy to taste and texture.

I love this recipe and have used it many times. However I put lemon juice in the cake itself and chop up a 4oz ginger root with the lemon peel in addition to spices. This gives it a real zing. Instead of the glaze I've been using an apricot jam and burn it with brandy. I use it at catered events and have never heard a disappointed word.

Very good! Nice combination of cake with fruit. Sauce & fuit are great and could be used as a light syrup over pancakes or French toast.

I followed this recipe exactly the first time but the second time I substituted sweetened, dried tart cherries. It was a huge hit with guests both times. Also, I was a little concerned initially about using such a large amount of pine nuts but they were delicious on the buttery base and the poached fruit was a perfect complement.

Very good, different, and company worthy. The torta is quite thin but adequate serving size. The fruit could be halved but the whole pieces are a better presentation.

I made this cake as part of an autumn dinner of roast pork and winter root vegetables last year and it was simple, delicious, and beautiful. The fruits and sweet wine were wonderful complements. The prunes cook quicker than the apricots, so next time I will hold them back in the simmering process.

My friend just served this and I fell in love with it. And yes, be careful not to burn the crust; it is so thin. Also, she just served it with what she said was cranberry sauce and it was delicious.

The cake was wonderful--even better the next day. The fruit was an wonderful compliment. The prunes were a hit! Even if you do not like them--try it-you will LOVE IT! (if you can't stand them try another fruit-maybe cherries?)

The tarte was extremely easy and flavourful. I made this in summer and it was quite dense, so I felt the fruit "weighed it down". Next time I might serve it with a brightly flavoured fruit coulis (maybe raspberry). The marsala fruit I'll probably serve with vanilla ice cream.

I have made the torta several times. I love it, and so has everyone else. It seems that the recipe has been requested and given away each time I've made it.

Superb! I tried this recipe this weekend and my husband and I loved it. I will make it again for our Christmas Eve dinner party.

THis was excellent. I made it for a dinner party and all my guest loved. I had it for desert after server swiss fondue. IT was good. the poached fruit could stand on it own as a desert. I really like the lemon zest in the cake. will definately make again

Our family loved this dessert. It reminded us of Tuscany and the subtle desserts of that region. Be careful not to over-bake the torta. The flavors are wonderful - the poached fruits are divine.

This was absolutely wonderful!! The hostess from our supper club made this and we all requested the recipe. The fruit could also be served warmed, very nice presentation.
