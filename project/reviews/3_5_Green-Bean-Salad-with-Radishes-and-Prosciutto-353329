Way too much mustard in the dressing.

I made this on a night too hot to cook. I used apple cider vinegar instead of Sherry, green onions (instead of chives), and some very good Parmesan. It was amazing, and I am sure I will make it again before the summer is over. Make sure to use very high quality prosciutto.

I'm sure I probably got the quantities wrong as I was trying to make just for one but this is the feedback: I liked it and it was easy enough but I found it too saltly without using any salt due to the prosciutto. Also, I think the Dijon was too strong. I didn't have any chives so I omitted and also used Parmigianno in the absence of ricotta salata.

Wonderful! Didn't have ricotta, so used fresh shaved parmesan instead. The radishes added a great crunch and the dressing went great with the green beans. Dressing is quicky & easy to make - didn't use as much oil as suggested.

Loved it just as it was planned, unfortunately didn't have the ricotta, but it was terrific none the less. Will be making this again soon, and using the heirloom beens and heirloom radishes from a local farmer. One twist might be to use pancetta and cook it like bacon until crispy and then crumble it on the salad.

I made this with haricot vert from the garden and fresh radishes. Made the dressing as directed but left off the prosciutto and cheese. It was a terrific salad without all that fat.

I used sliced up napa cabbage instead of prosciutto. I used Sherry vinegar, dijon mustard,olive oil, salt, pepper, tarragon and a dash of sugar for the dressing. My son loved it! It was very tasty!

This was a super easy and tasty salad, although I took a number of liberties with the recipe. We're months away from fresh, local green beans, so I subbed sugar snap peas. I also used rice wine vinegar in place of sherry and parmesan in place of ricotta salata. I'd like to try it as orignally written, but as a pantry staple salad, my version was quite tasty.

This was fabulous and a nice change of pace from the typical green salad. Flavors all blended beautifully. The only change I made was to use Sherry vinegar rather than the aged Sherry.
