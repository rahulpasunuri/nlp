What an amazing bird. It was the first turkey I have ever made and I don't know if I'll ever make another! People freaked out about the gravy and said it was the best they had ever had. Seriously an amazing turkey. I added butter injections to it as well, was so moist and succulent. Definitely would do again.

Have made this receipe for 3 years! Important to use Cider (NOT apple juice --it's worth making the effort to find REAL cider.) Also, we use Gran Marnier instead of apple liquour -- the citris is a nice touch with the apple cider flavor in the gravey. This recipe makes a LOT of gravey -- make sure you start at least30 minutes befor you will need it b/c it takes a while to cook down.

This is my all time favorite turkey recipe. I have made it the last three years for Thanksgiving and it has always come out perfectly moist. The flavor couldn't be better. Everyone who has tried it told me they loved it and couldn't wait for the next time I would make it. Definitely a keeper!!!!

Prepared this turkey over the past couple of days and cooked it yesterday. What a feast! Exceptionally moist bird, perfectly seasoned, and everyone loved the gravy. We didn't have calvados for the gravy, so I substituted a bit of cognac - I'm certain that it didn't make an appreciable difference. This will be my new go-to recipe for Thanksgiving. Highly recommended!

I am currently in the midst of making this recipe... my turkey is bringing overnight. I just made the gravy base and wanted to share my experience. I couldn't find Calvados so I got a very dry sherry instead. I also got Safeway O Organics unfiltered apple juice which is cloudy, trying to avoid the too-sweet problem some reviewers cited. I tasted it plain and it's very tart, so I would highly recommend avoiding regular apple juice for this recipe. The gravy base is really delicious and the sweetness is very subtle, almost maple-y. It is definitely different than a pepper & garlic standard gravy, but it's not so unusual, and very delicious with lots of savory flavor.

I have made this exact turkey every year for 7 years straight and will probably never be able to bring myself to try another recipe. It is incredibly moist and flavorful - I get so many complements every year! Everyone seems to love the gravy too - so I always make a double batch.

I haven't made this yet but I'm giving it 4 forks because YOU CAN MAKE THE GRAVY AHEAD! The best thing I've learned since I started making gravy 50 yrs. ago. I would prefer to use Madeira rather than apple cider however. Does anyone have any thoughts on that? Use less than the cider, more????

Seriously, this TURKEY was the ABSOLUTE BEST! I have never tasted anything as wonderful. It was exquisite. I got incredible reviews from everyone. Only thing is...I used Apple Cider VINEGAR!! No joke! The house was completely funky smelling and the turkey was lovely. I'm not sure if I should make the same "mistake" again. I think I will. What do you all think?

This was my first attempt at brining - and I will forever brine a turkey! Worth every step in preparation! And the herb butter on this turkey was delicious. I really wanted to love the apple cider gravy...but it isn't going to make the cut. I will go with a more traditional gravy next year...something a little more savory.

This was my first time brining a turkey and I can say with confidence that this was an absolute success. The turkey was so flavorful and moist that it was nearly falling off the bone at the end. The herb butter made for a robust flavor and a nice crispy skin. I loved the gravy but it definately was on the sweet side so it might not suite every palette.

Have to agree with everyone else - this was amazing. This was my first experience roasting a turkey and the flavors were incredible. I prepared for the 9 girls in my supper club and everyone was oohing and aahing. I could have used more gravy, it was all gone at the end with none for leftovers! To me that was the best sign of success.

Made this last year and it was the best turkey I ever made. I used an organic free range bird, and it was incredibly delicious. The previous reviewers were correct - the gravy is fabulous and since you make it ahead, you avoid the last minute challenges of the traditional version. However, I did deglaze the roasting pan with more cider, poured off the grease and strained the drippings into the gravy anyway. Wonderful flavor. It will be my go- to recipe for Thanksgiving.

I've made this recipe for years and look forward to it every time! The gravy is what really sets this recipe apart, original and different but still traditional enough for those in the family that don't like change. The turkey itself I've changed to dry brining (much simpler with the same result) and Alton Brown's cooking method. I highly reccomend these slight changes, but don't change a thing about the rest!

I didn't read all the reviews, but from the ones I did see, I'm thinking that my husband and I must be the only people who didn't like this dish. Everyone at dinner thought the turkey tasted great - very tender and moist - and I agree with that assessment. However, this turkey was wayy too salty for me (and my husband) and the gravy was too sweet. We eat a very healthy (and tasty) whole foods diet and - possibly because we don't eat a huge amount of salt and sugar - these tastes were just a little to extreme for us. On the other hand, maybe we did something wrong.....? I gave it two forks since other folks here liked it. If it had just been us I would have given it one.

I have been making this recipe for three years (on Thanksgiving and Easter). It is so popular we renamed the gravy "crack gravy" because it is ADDICTING!!!! The fact that the gravy base can be made 2 days in advance is an added plus.

My 3rd Thanksgiving making this turkey- there is NO other recipe. 3 years ago I hosted my very first Thanksgiving and was able to make it with no difficulties- my first turkey, ever. The cider and herb gravy really make the dish. Dont know why other reviewers panned the gravy. Keep it as is! The bird did need to be basted with extra apple cider periodically to get enough drippings for a good gravy though. Putting the herb butter on the bottom of the pan was a mistake- it burned. So last year I put some olive oil- just a little- on the bottom of pan and halfway through cooking put the herb butter on roasting pan. I also roasted it upside down (funny mistake) and it was the juiciest white meat i've ever had! Doing it upside down for half the cooking time this year! It was unbelievably succulent. Even rivaled my mother who is an incredible cook!

PS... Cover the entire turkey with Apple smoked bacon. I'm not kidding. Use tooth picks if you need to to old the strips in place... I usually use two packs if the turkey is large. It protects the skin from burning and if you pull it off the last hour of roasting the turkey will brown enough for your presentation. The gravy that comes from this is the best I have ever had in my life. I do this every Thanksgiving (only) and look forward to it every year.... AMAZING

Every year I choose a different turkey from this site. I have been doing this for at least ten years. I have stopped looking. This is truly the best turkey I have ever had.

Delicious! This recipe took a little planning ahead, but otherwise simple and excellent. I was concerned because I did not have many drippings for gravy, but they were all inside the bird. Turned out very moist. I added water to the bottom of the pan to keep apples and onions from burning, and gravy turned out excellent. I will definitely make this next year. Rave reviews from all.

Rating: 3
The turkey gets 4 forks, but the gravy awards the overall recipe a 3. This was my first time making a turkey, and my family couldn't believe how moist it was. I will definitely be brining every year. Concerning the turkey, the only thing I changed was adding some of the cold herb butter under the skin, and then I melted the rest for basting. The gravy had good flavor, but the consistency was disappointing, very runny. I think I'll try a more traditional gravy recipe next year. Overall, a good recipe.

This is the hands down the best turkey I have ever tasted or made. My grnaparents who eat a turkey at least once a month (for reasons unknown to me) agreed that this is the absolutly best turkey they have ever had, it was the moistest turkey and had wonderful flavor. i brine about 24 hours drain well and when i cook it I baste with the apple cider about every 15 minutes or so, It makes this turkey trully picture perfect! I will be making this recipe for years to come *note I use my homemade gravy instead of the one indicated

I used this recipe for my first turkey-- after eleven years of vegetarianism, I was definitely nervous. It was definitely THE BEST turkey I have ever tasted. Tender, moist, and wonderfully tasty. The cider and herbs were a wonderful combination, and made a fantastic gravy. It's a more involved recipe with the brining, but relatively easy. I'm definitely making this again this year!

This was very good, we had people over for dinner and all loved it. I did strain the gravey becuase it just didn't look appitizing with the herbs. I waited to do that until the very last so that I got all of the flavor. Followed the recipe exactly and I highly recommend it.

I used a 10 pound organic turkey breast. It just fit into a 16 qt stock pot with 7 qts brine liquid instead of 8. I found a recommendation that brining should be 1 hour per pound so I just did it overnight but did not let it rest an additional day (didn't plan ahead). All the fresh herbs except the marjoram can easily be grown in your garden and harvested in November. Just because it is A LOT of chopping, I only used 2 TLB of the thyme and sage. I used 2 tsp(instead of 1) of the rosemary and I substituted 2 tsp of dried oregano for the marjoram. This was plenty of herb flavoring. I tried roasting at 500 degrees for the first 30 minutes but I wouldn't do that again. If you butter the pan as indicated, the butter will burn at this temp, so I had a very smoky house after that. I roasted until the thermometer was 161 degrees, then let it rest 30 minutes before carving. I froze the leftover gravy and used it for Christmas and it tasted just as good as fresh. I will make it just the same next year!

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe! The turkey is so juicy and the skin looks absolutely gorgeous with the herb butter. I agree with previous poster that the gravy was too "cidery", so I replaced the cider with additional chicken broth and received raves. I made the herb butter three days ahead and froze, and it saved a good deal of time. Note: don't worry if your salt does not completely dissolve when starting the brine - it will when you add the additional water after heating.

This recipe was very extensive and it tasted like a regular turkey. I did not taste the apple cider or any of the seasonings that the turkey was made in. The turkey was good but it wasn't worth the effort. I could have made it the original way and it would have still come out tasting the same.

Excellent bird! Trick I learned was: Roast on lowest level of the oven at 500 degrees F. for 30 minutes. Remove from oven and cover breast with double layer of aluminum foil, insert probe thermometer into thickest part of the breast and return to oven, reducing temperature to 350 degrees F. Set thermometer alarm (if available) to 161 degrees. A 14 to 16 pound bird should require a total of 2 to 2 1/2 hours of roasting. Let turkey rest, loosely covered for 15 minutes before carving. Juiciest bird you ever ate!

This was a wonderful recipe! One of the guests said, "This was the best turkey I've ever had." Though very tasty and juicy, I would cook for 3 hours for a 6 kg bird (for 10-12 people). Despite cooking for 3.5 hours, it was still juicy enough though!

I was disappointed with this recipe. THe turkey itself turned out fine, but not as moist as another brined turkey that we had in the past. THe gravy base was fine until I added the pan juices and then it took forever to reduce and the juices were too salty. So maybe i didn't drain it enough after the brining step. Also, the turkey reached 175 degress a lot faster per our digital thermometer. I might try it again since I want to figure out why everyone else loves this recipe so much.

Rating: 4
I have found the recipe I will be using for all Thanksgivings in the future. The brining made the bird juicy and delicious, the gravy was fantastic and I couldn't have been happier with the flavor, just enough sweet with the savory. It made 2 full cups of gravy which was gone by the end of the meal. Try pairing this with the "apple, sausage and parsnip stuffing with fresh sage.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner today and it was wonderful! My brother- in-law normally skips the breast because it is too dry, but had seconds of the white meat today. I didn't have many drippings in the pan so I ended up adding some water to the roasting pan before finishing the gravy. Next time I'll probably add some more cider to the basting process.

My dad is the best cook and always does the turkey. I used this recipe last year and he said it was the best turkey he's ever had (he's 78!) and this is how we should have it from now on.

I first made this reciepe in 2003 when I got the Bon Appetite Thanksgiving issue, and I've made it every year since. I'll never make any other recipe again. It is so, so, so Good!! Everyone I've made it for loves it! The brine makes the turkey incredibly moist and the apples & herbs add great flavor! I highly recommend it. My advice is to chop your herbs the night before you cook the turkey, it's time consuming. I also suggest using fresh apple cider for the full flavor.Try the cranberry marmalade from the same issue, it is also outstanding! Invest in a digital thermometer, at ($30) and you can't possibly over-cook it!

This was my first brining experience, and like many others, I was very nervous about the bird being too salty. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was perfect! A true hit. Taste was wonderful, and the presentation was just like the photo. The gravy was a little funky, but if you like apple cider you will be OK with it - I just found the apple/herb combo to be a bit overwhelming and will stick with my normal giblet gravy next time. Also, definitely use fresh herbs. Well worth the cost!

This was my first ever turkey and it turned out great! Like several other reviewers, I cooked the bird breast-down at high heat (500 F) for the first 30 min then the traditional way for the duration. In the end, the turkey looked really good and was moist and tasty. My family loved both the turkey and the gravy.

This was my first time brining a turkey, and as advertised, it was moist and delicious. One thing I did read, and did not consider however, was the idea that a brined turkey cooks faster because the water acts as a heat conductor. Wow, I'll say! I cooked a 24 lb. turkey that was finished in 3 1/2 - 4 hours!! Almost 3 hours before we actually ate it! When I make this again next year, I will definately factor in the time difference! All in all a big hit! Thanks.

We will definitely add this recipe to our Thanksgiving favorites!!! The compliments that I got from this turkey were worth the extra effort that the turkey took. Everyone loved the flavor of the meat and could not stop raving about the gravy -- it was spectacular. I decided to follow the advice of another reviewer and cook the turkey breat down for the first hour and a half and then flip it breast side up for the remainder (the 18 pound bird took no effort to turn it). The white meat was very moist and tender, so thank you for the advice. We served it with all the regular side dishes (stuffing, Barefoot Contessa's sweet potatoes, cranberry and orange relish) and added the roasted green beans with garlic from this site which everyone loved. It was a meal that had everyone asking for more! Thanks so much for the recipe.

I have used this recipe for the past two years at Thanksgiving and will use it again this year. I have had nothing but rave reviews from family. One modification I made was to use the "gravy base" as the gravy or sauce all by itself and this has gotten the most compliments of all. Fresh herbs make all the difference with this recipe as well.

I've tried a number of others but this is my favorite turkey preparation. The brining makes all the difference; the turkey always comes out incredibly moist and delicious. One tip: blend a couple of the onions from the pan into the gravy -- a good way to thicken it and give it more flavor at the same time. Also, I always use a fresh turkey (usually Bell and Evans.)

My family is still talking-turkey! This is a MUST TRY recipe. I stuffed the cavity of the bird with more apples & onions than were called for and I included dried cranberries both inside & out. I also found that the bird absorbed so much of the juices that I needed to baste with an additional apple-cider/chicken broth mixture that I made. Even the leftovers (what little there was) were tender after being refrigerated.

This was fantastic!! Everyone said it was the best turkey they had ever had. I did just a few things differently with the cooking time. I saw this technique on Alton Brown's show Good Eats. I cooked it in a 500 degree oven for 1/2 an hour. Then I basted it with the apple cider, covered the breast with tin foil and reduced the oven to 350 until a thermometer (inserted into the breast, not the thigh) reached 161 degrees. I then let it rest for about a half an hour. The result, perfectly cooked and juicy white and dark meat!!

Really liked the recipe for the turkey. But not as wild about the gravy as it was a bit too sweet for my tastes. Also -- cooked the turkey slightly differently than contemplated by the recipe -- breast down for first two hours and then breast up for balance of cook time (per Joy of Cooking recommendation). This made for a perfectly cooked turkey -- dark meat done and breast not overdone. I saved some of the herb butter to brush on the breast when I flipped it -- that way the breast comes out with that herb crusted coating. Also -- turned oven up to 400 for last 5 minutes or so to get top of breast nicely brown and crisp. Really liked this particular brining recipe, as well as the herb butter mixture that goes on the turkey and the basting with apple cider.

The turkey was delicious and the brining method is well worth it, even when you have to carry very heavy bird with 8 qts of water to an outside fridge.

This turkey drew raves from a crowd of 25. I made a double batch of gravy and can only describe it as "awesome". I brined the turkey for 24 hours and let it drain for about 12. We have cooked the cover recipe from Bon Appetit for the last 12 years and everyone agreed this one was the best yet. Beautiful coloring, incredibly moist and very flavorful. One slight alteration: I used the Alton Brown roasting method and am definitely a convert. No basting & worked perfectly to give us a succulent feast.

I BBQ this recipie on a spit and it was wonderful. A shortened brining period worked just fine. I did a 20lb turkey over night and it was delicious. Not too salty. The seperately made gravy was the perfect solution for the BBQ. After all, who likes turkey without gravy.

I agree with Dallas that 48 hours is too much for brining. More importantly, I am concerned about using plastic garbage bags in food preparation. Even the GLAD bag website states that garbage bags are not FDA approved for food storage. Many brands contain plasticizers, which are chemically similar to hormones. I recommend WASHING the pot with hot water and soap. I can't fathom why this step was included. P.S. I am not an environmentalist wacko, just obsessive about food prep hygiene.

I used a frozen half-turkey that I had packed away in April (!). The brining technique is PERFECT for a frozen bird, as any hint of freezer burn is eradicated. I agree with the other cook that only 24 hours of brining is probably best. My half-bird was 10 lbs, and overnight brining was fine. The amazing thing about this recipe is the GRAVY! Oh Lord! So apple-y and fabulous. I am passing this recipe on to my family for Thanksgiving this year - this was a really delicious way to do turkey.

Brining instructions are way too salty. Cut both the amount of salt and the brining time in half. 24 hours is ideal for brining turkey or chicken; overnight is acceptable. Save the longer brining for pork, where it really does some good. Two cups of kosher salt is too much: one cup is better, and add 3/4 cup of sugar to the brine solution. Brining for 48 hours with this much salt will make the pan drippings too brackish to work with.
