I love this recipe. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, but have since tweaked it to suit our taste. I only add one chili seeds and all. I thought two chilies tended to over power the other flavors. I also skip the vanilla bean (economy measure) and add vanilla extract with the rum. This is my son's favorite dessert.

I loved this recipe. However, it is a little labor intensive. I thought the chile dimension to the tart was interesting, however, my boyfriend absolutely hated it. It reminded him of cinnamon red hot candies which he never liked. I might try again without addition of chile. Good overall recipe.

Excellent. Great for preparing in advance. I had leftovers, so I froze the baked rounds on the same cookie sheet I had cooked them on. Two weeks later, I stuck the sheet in the oven and warmed it up for 15 minutes. It came out just as good as the first time. One comment made after a first bite, "This is crazy!" As she reached for another bite. The mix of all those flavors is awesome.

I LOVE the roasted pineapple! It is fantastic by itself over icecream and the spicy kick is a real treat. I made this dessert according to spec and it was very well received by my clients. In the end however, I could take or leave the pastry specified after experimenting with the roasted pineapple in a myriad of other recipes (with great success and I feel far more interesting results). It really adds a wonderful dimension to any dessert, marinade, or main course recipe calling for pineapple.

Positively scrumptious! I've now realized how much I enjoy spicy-sweet desserts. I have to confess that I made some alterations: instead of roasting a whole pineapple, I roasted pineapple chunks and then threw in some kiwi pieces when baking the pastry, since using up those fruits was my goal in trying this recipe. I also didn't want to bother making my own pastry circles, so I used pre-made puff-pastry shells. Plus, instead of ice cream, I served these with some leftover lime/lemon cream sauce from "Tropical Fruit Kebabs with Lime Cream" (also available on Epicurious), which I thought was a wonderful accompaniment. For those who prefer milder flavors, I would suggest using only one chile instead of two. A note of caution when adding water to the caramel syrup: "syrup will bubble vigorously" is an understatement. A bubble of superheated air exploded from the pan and bounced off the refrigerator across my kitchen, knocking a magnet off the fridge door. Fortunately the pan didn't seem to wobble, and no hot liquid splashed on me. But do be careful during this step!
