I'm generously giving this recipe 2 forks, I just didn't like the look of one. It wasn't bad, just not very good. My husband thought they were better than I did, and I was thoroughly unimpressed.

A lovely dessert for autumn in New England, and so simple. For 4 pears, I cut the maple syrup to 1 cup, but used the same quantities of lemon juice and butter. I like the ice cream idea - next time will try that instead of the whipped cream.

oh, the smell wafting through the house as this cooked! i had an overripe bosc that got beat up in my bag, and i divided the recipe by 1/6. so good. i didn't have cream, but ice cream or whipped cream would have been perfect. delicious!

My question is, if there are six pears in the recipe, why does it say that it only serves four? That aside, with a melon baller, I scooped out the seeds from the stem end and stuffed it with blue cheese before proceeding with the rest of the recipe - really, really good!

It's even better with Amaretto instead of the brandy. I used "sugar in the raw" and the tan colored and larger crystals made a beautiful coating. I carefully selected Bosc pears that had good stems and would stand up nicely on their own so I did not have to cut a slice off of the bottom. This dessert is quick and easy to make and was the highlight of our Christmas dinner.

Beautiful and delicious. I added 2 cinnamon sticks and a handful of currents to the maple syrup. Served the warm pears with icecream and poured the syrup over the top.

I made this recipe with unpeeled, fully ripe bartlett pears. I added a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg on each pear and it enhanced the flavor.

Very simple but tasty. I've made this several times, and my guests have all loved it.

This is a great dessert to serve for a dinner party--it's easy, bakes while you're eating dinner/entertaining, and tastes delicious! I left the pears unpeeled, omitted the brandy since I didn't have any, baked for 45 minutes and served with vanilla ice cream (instead of cream) and topped it off with the carmelized maple syrup from the pan. Next time I might try to core the pears before baking.

This is not the recipe to make on the spur of the moment unless you are sure the pears are ripe. I didn't have Calvados in the house and forgot to pick some up. I used Apple Cider and it was a bit too sweet, but still great.

This was really easy and really very good. My guests loved it. The pears and sauce take on a wonderful carmelized maple flavor. Even if you bake it longer than suggested (which I did since dinner ran late), you'll be fine. Also, serve them with softly whipped cream that has been flavored with the baked syrup.

Recipe was unclear as to whether or not to peel the pears. We didn't, but wondered if we should have. We also baked them for 1 1/2 hours and they never got soft enough to pierce easily.
