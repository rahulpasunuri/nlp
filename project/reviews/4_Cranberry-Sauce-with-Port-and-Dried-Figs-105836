This sauce is great !!!!! The smell is incredible when it's cooking !!!!!!!! I follow the recipe exactly how it's written. I do add my own twist at the end, when everything is cooked and cools off a little I put the sauce in a blender. It really mixes all the ingredients together and in my opinion looks nicer.

This is a spectacular addition to the holiday table. I love this cranberry sauce because it's got a savory bite and isn't cloying or expected in the way many cranberry sauces can be. It's also fabulous with a pork tenderloin or used as a condiment on a leftover turkey sandwich. If anything, you could cut the white sugar in half and still have a great tasting result.

This sauce is delicious. Since I live in Ecuador, it is not possible for me to obtain fresh cranberries,so I used dreid cranberries. I set them to dip in water approximately 4 hours. Then use them with the water in which they were dipped. It was a success

Easy and delicious! Thickened up beautifully as it chilled. A nice balance of textures and a good level of sweetness without losing the big cranberry flavor. The figs are what make this a winner, to the point that my hubby said he liked it (first cranberry sauce to get his seal of approval). We have a little leftover, think I might have to try the suggestion of another reviewer and try over Brie.

I made this sauce for Thanksgiving with leftover figs from the Winter Fruit pie on this site. I think this was probably my favorite dish. I cooked the sauce down much longer than the recipe recommends. Probably simmered for about 1/2 hour until it was jellier like in consistency. SO GOOD!

Very tasty cranberry sauce! Everyone loved it.

I have been making this recipe every year since 2001 when it was first published. Once it appeared at Thanksgiving, there was never a question of trying anything else. I follow the recipe exactly but of course some cooks will have their personal preference as to runniness etc. The recipe as written is slightly liquid (which I prefer) and has a sophisticated combination of sweet, tart and deeper savory flavors from the pepper and herbs. Make it!

Rating: 3
This recipe could have worked if I had not followed all the readers' modifications. So I decreased the port, decreased the sugar, increased the cooking time and ended up with a tart piece of cement. People should follow the recipe and rate it, not tweak it so much that it's no longer the recipe. Too bad the figs were so expensive, I would just throw it out.

Rating: 4
I canned this recipe in 4oz jars and gave it as Christmas presents ... kept a supply for myself. I don't add pectin - just boil it down until I get the consistency that I want. I find that we can eat up 4 oz of this on our own. I serve it alongside cheeses - especially good with a runny goat cheese. We also like it with turkey and pork.

This was fabulous! I usually don't like figs, but they were a perfect addition to this recipe!!! I used half ruby and half tawny port because that's what I had on hand.

Rating: 4
There is a reason this recipe has a blue ribbon. If you are wondering whether you should make it or not, stop thinking--go out, get the ingredients and start cooking! You won't regret it. The depth of flavor the figs, port and rosemary provide is out of this world, and whenever I make this for Thanksgiving dinner it disappears. This from a family who normally never touches cranberry sauce--this recipe is irresistible, and so simple. Great leftover, too.

Sensational!

Simply delicious. Despite having strongly-flavored ingredients, the overall effect was subtle and well-balanced. It won rave reviews from my guests. I won't be making any other cranberry sauce in the future! Note: This turns out quite thick - more of a compote than a sauce - and I loved it that way!

This was quite the hit! Served it with Thanksgiving dinner and poured the leftovers over Brie. I think it would be great with goat cheese. I made it on Tuesday and it was perfect on Thursday.

I make cranberry sauce every year and this was the best yet! My one substitution was to use dates instead of figs (because that was what I had) and it was delicious. Not too sweet, and a real depth of cranberry flavor. Definitely a do-ahead recipe, as it gets much more flavorful if it sits for a least 24 hours.

Honestly it was too sweet for my taste and Thanksgiving table. I ended up making my old favorite- cranberries boiled in frozen apple juice with cinnamon with a small amount of added sugar to taste. This recipe would be good though on Brie or Camenbert or just a piece of toast. My mother thought it made a great tasting jam.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it turned out delish! The ingredients do compliment each other well. I made the dish the night before to allow the flavors to meld together. The only change I made, was to follow the suggestions from other cooks. I used less port (1 1/3 cup), and allowed the liquid to simmer, to reduce, a while before adding the cranberries and sugar. My family thought it was terrific, so this is a definite keeper recipe!

This cranberry sauce scared me a little, because I made it last night and this morning I tasted it and thought, "urgh." But by the time we ate dinner this evening, the flavors had all settled in together and it was fantastic. I advise making this well in advance for this reason.

I have made this every year since it first came out in the magazine and it's everyone's favorite -- hands down. I also add a cinnamon stick and then remove it along with the rosemary sprig. This year I made a batch for my employer, who doesn't eat sugar, using agave nectar instead. It hardly changed the taste at all -- she loved it. What a great recipe!

Here it is Thanksgiving and I was just told that I had to bring Cranberry Sauce. This looked great, but I didn't have the exact ingredients. I substituted the ruby port for a very nice Tawny and I didn't have the figs, so I used raisins (closest thing I had). I am sure that this dish is incredible as written, but it is still great with those changes.

My friend told me she found this recipe, I know everything she makes is amazing.

This cranberry sauce is amazing; like other reviewers, I have been a devoted user of it for the past 5 thanksgivings.

I've made this as written at least six times along with several others on this site and it's still hands down our favorite. Agree with other reviewers that it has broad appeal for those expecting a traditional cranberry sauce as well as your foodie-friends. Even people who claim to not like cranberry sauce have been won over. Definitely better the next day.

Rating: 3
Let me start by saying I ADORE cranberry sauce. This recipe is tasty -- but 1 2/3 cup port makes for a seriously intense flavor that is hard to eat by itself -- it's too much. I made the recipe exactly as it said, and my sauce ended up too sweet and too liquidy. When I make it again (because it is good), I'm going to use 2/3 c port, 2/3 c water, and boil for longer. I'm also going use 1/2 c sugar or less in the second stage. Also good things to add: orange pieces, orange zest, apple pieces, pecans.

Rating: 4
A cranberry sauce everyone can like. It is interesting enough to please a sophisticated palate; however it is sweet and gentle enough to please the people who normally eat the shakey gel from the can. One caution: don't expect it to taste good fresh off of the stove. The black pepper was so intense at this point that we thought it was trash ready. The next day all of the flavors melded together beautifully.

Rating: 4
I, too, have made this sauce for several years. The flavors of this sauce are fabulous! Like another reviewer, my family also eats the leftovers over ice cream (-: This year I forgot and chopped up the thyme, and it was still OK (I worried that it would become bitter, but it was OK.) My tip with this recipe is to simmer the heck out of the liquid before adding the cranberries, otherwise you'll have to simmer the heck out of the cranberries to get the right consistency, and they'll turn to mush.

This is exactly what you want from a cranberry sauce. We've used a red zin when we didn't have port and it was still fantastic. If you're grilling a turkey, go with this. Also killer with roast beef sandwiches and bleu cheese.

Excellent dish, except that I think there might be a bit TOO much port. My finished dish has a pretty strong smell of alcohol. Are there any suggestions out there for what liquid to use if I decide to cut down on the port?

This will be the 3rd Thanksgiving that I make this sauce. It's totally awesome, and I wouldn't change a thing in the recipe. I grew up on the canned variety of the "dish", smoothly sliced gelatinous circles of pink-flavored corn syrup - and this is soooo far from that. Highly recommended. Head to Trader Joe's for cheap Port! Leftovers (when the rest of the Thanksgiving fixin's are gone) taste great on ice cream or just straight up.

I made this last year for friends and was invited back this year and told not to bother showing up unless I brought more of this with me. The first time I tasted it, I was worried that it would be too much for some people, but so far it's gotten nothing but raves. Even people who don't usually like cranberry sauce and wrinkled their nose when I told them what was in it ended up going back for seconds and thirds. It's already on my list of foods that make the holidays for me.

all i have to say is wow! i doubled this recipe to feed 12 guest and it turned out perfect. i thought it would be a little sweet because of all the sugar and port but it actually turned out more tart than i thought. perfect balance of flavors and easy! i was at a store that did not have ruby port so i used a cooking port that worked just fine. great!

Sophisticated, mellow sauce that got "best ever" reviews from some of my guests. Be sure to follow the recipe exactly, even the pepper. I would not use triple sec (mentioned by another reviewer) because the point is to NOT do orange. The only thing I did differently was to reduce the sugar slightly. It's still sweet enough to use over poundcake. Do yourself a favor and make this as a contrast to traditional cranberry sauce.

OH. MY. GOD. This is, hands down, the BEST cranberry sauce I've ever had. I make cranberry sauce from scratch every year and I've found several excellent recipes on this site, including the one with shallots. This one blows them all away. I made only a couple of changes - I doubled the recipe but only put in 2.5 cups of port instead of the 3.33 called for - I thought it would be too liquid otherwise, and I was right, the consistency with 2.5 cups is perfect. Also, I cooked it a little longer than called for and I added a splash of triple sec at the end. Amazing. It's cooling now and I can't keep my tasting spoon out of it!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Rating: 4
I have always made cranberry sauce from scratch and each year, I try to find new, interesting recipes. My search is over. YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR RECIPE. PERIOD. END OF DISCUSSION. I used very good port and actually forgot to buy brown sugar, so used all organic, unbleached cane, and a bit of regular white sugar, which was fabulous. Would probably be even more fabulous with brown packed sugar. I also used fresh figs instead of dried and added some dried cherries in as well as a splash of orange juice at the end (which cut the port taste just a tiny bit, which is good). The port as the base for this is what makes it such a gem. I made it tonight and plan on serving it on Thanksgiving. It is SO GOOD! Bon Appetit!

YUMMY multiplied by several powers of 10. Wonderful stuff. Made it 3 days ahead and followed the recipe exactly, using the highest quality ruby port I could find. Someone at the liquor store tried to talk me into buying a cheap bottle of port, saying "you'll waste the good stuff by using it for cooking" but I heartily disagree after tasting this sauce - I'd never make it any other way. My Christmas guests could not get enough of this cranberry sauce. I can't wait to make it again next year. Both tart and sweet - another cook commented "cranberry sauce for grownups" - hear hear!

I've been making this recipe every year for Thanksgiving since it first appeared on Epicurious in 2001. Every year it is a hit with different groups of people that I invite for the holidays. Occasionally I make two cranberry sauce recipes (the second recipe is Grand Marnier Cranberry Sauce from this site) and the Port and Dried Figs version always disappears first. It has just the right balance of sweet, tart and chewy. Goes exceptionally well with the Brown Sugar-Cured Turkey recipe, also from this site.

I own a small catering company and we offered this dish for Thanksgiving. All of our customers raved! I saved out a little for us and liked it VERY much also, even tho I thought the port flavor was a little too heavy. When making vats of it in the future I might try port combined with dry sherry and see if I can lighten it up a bit. But definitely a keeper either way! It will become a standard for us.

Rave reviews from everyone at Thanksgiving and already have requests to make this for Christmas. The recipe is perfect, both tart and sweet! I did double the Rosemary 'cuz its my favorite herb. I also cooked it down for about 20-25 minutes after adding the cranberries. It jelled perfectly but the extra cooking softened the berries much more than in the picture - I thought it was great that way!

A huge disappointment after all the rave reviews. It was so 'iffy', I asked 3 other people to taste it and give me an honest opinion. After getting their reactions, I didn't even put it on the table.

Outstanding! We were torn about which cranberry recipe to make for Thanksgiving & are glad we chose this. The sweetness of the Port & figs perfectly balance the acidity of the cranberries. I agree with the cook who added ginger - it's the only thing we felt was missing. The fresh rosemary infused nicely & is most noticeable in fragrance while the sauce is still hot. I'd add more of that, too, probably double the infusion. I may try adding a bit of shallot as well. But it's wonderful as it is.

OK, I hate cranberry sauce, but ya gotta make it!! This dish was superb. I was impressed and now I am converted! A couple things I did, that made it even more scruptious, was add 1/4 cup minced crystalized ginger in with the figs, then I reduced it longer to make it thicker and I also crushed 2 Tbl dried rosemary in a mortar and pestle and added that in too. YUM!
