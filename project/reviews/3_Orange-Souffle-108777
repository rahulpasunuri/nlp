I made the souffle in individual dishes, which makes it easier to serve. They were beautiful, but as most souffles do, fell as they got out of the oven. Flavor is very delicate. I served it with a small glass of Grand Marnier. Some of us added a spoonful of Grand Marnier in our dish.

My first souffle and it fell. But the flavor was great, sophisticated. It was not wet like the other reviews stated. It was perfect for a New Years special dessert.

The souffle was easy enough to make - the taste was wonderful - but the finished product was really wet - and I baked it for 2 minutes longer than called for. Are souffles supposed to be so wet? The top fell as it began to cool - even though it was in a pie plate - and the souffle became really flat - it was only the great flavor that kept it from being gross. I wouldn't make this for company - so unless I am goign to eat the whole think by myself - I wouldn't make it again.

Wonderful orange flavor even though I used Tropicana instead of fresh OJ. Perfect consistency! Served with fresh whipped cream. I was apprehensive about a souffle in a pie pan, but it worked out great. My only complaint was that the top did not crust or crack like my usual souffles -- it was a perfect dome. Will definitely make this again.
