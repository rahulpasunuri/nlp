Love this recipe. It is delicious and my family loves it. Also, it is easy to add to this recipe for different tastes. I usually add shrimp and mushrooms which makes this recipe out of this world delicious!

This is a great recipe. The dish came out perfectly!

I followed the recipe EXCEPT I used 2 eggs instead of 3 (3 just seemed excesive), and I replaced the crushed red pepper with regular freshly ground black pepper. Everyone loved it! So easy to make, too. Yum.

I saw from previous reviews that there was controversy over the lack of black pepper in the recipe, so I added half red and half black pepper. I also sauteed some chicken breast tenders and served the pasta topped with chicken. As other reviewers, I substituted fat free half and half with no problems. My husband said he could have this recipe once a week!!

I love this recipe! It's fun and easy to make. It's also extremely versatile, making it great as a comfort meal or a dish to impresses guests at a dinner party. I like to use 8-10 bacon strips and serve it as a main course. I've found that if you want to cut a few calories it still turns out great without the vermouth or wine, and non-fat half & half is a great substitute for the whipping cream.

WOW. I made this last night for my wife and daughter and we didn't stop eating until the pot was empty. It was rich, creamy, and exceptionally flavorful. The heat of the read pepper was an unexpected but thoroughly enjoyable surprise, and I think it made the carbonara feel less heavy that it might normally have been. The only change I made was to use a little more bacon because there were a couple of slices left in the pack. I did everything else as per the recipe and we will DEFINITELY be making this again.

I love Carbonara and am always looking for a new recipe twist. This one is Fabulous! the white wine is the perfect touch. I added a bit of black pepper, but changed nothing else.

Delicious and surprisingly easy, especially if you can find truffle oil to add a dab.

This is a great recipe for a deceptively simple dish. With few ingredients and little prep involved, Carbonara should be a no-brainer but it never was... until I found this recipe. I followed the directions step-by-step and avoided the usual scrambled eggs pitfall. Using vermouth and shallot, rather than onion, the final product was creamy and delicious. Definitely give this a try.

As perplexed as other reviewers by the total lack of black pepper in a recipe for Carbonara, I just substituted the red pepper for a heaping teaspoon of freshly, coarsely ground black pepper. That gave it plenty of kick, and suddendly fond childhood memories of the lovely, high-end, Midtown Manhattan Italian restaurants of the 60's and 70's came flooding back!! That was pretty much all I had been looking for from this dish, so I'll be keeping my adjusted version of this recipe.

That last post is not a modification; it's a completely different recipe! Why would you post a completely different recipe in the notes to this recipe? If you don't like it, say so and alter its "fork" rating. I found this recipe to be easy to follow and a pretty good approximation to the carbonara I've had going out to dinner. I used pancetta because I prefer the flavor. I was a little concerned that the egg wouldn't cook completely from the heat of the pasta, but it tasted fine and none of us are sick, so I worried for nothing. :o) I'll definately make it again.

I've been making Carbonara since I was 6, yes 6! None of the recipe's on here are to my liking, try this... Cook Chopped bacon (Near end of cooking add chopped garlic and a splash of wine, yes to the frypan NO removal of drippings) Cook Spaghetti/Linguine In a large serving bowl mix... Ground pepper, red pepper flakes, 2 eggs+1 yolk, chopped parsley, oregano. Then add Romano cheese until mixture is smooth, not too pasty! Add bacon and hot pasta to the serving bowl mix well eat it up and shut up!

I have tried several linguine carbonaras in restaurants and this is by far one of the best I've ever tasted. The sauce clings beautifully to the pasta and is easy to avoid that "scrambled egg" appearance. Also the better the bacon the better the overall taste.

i thought maybe the first time i made it, it was a fluke...i must have messed up somewhere, because it just wasn't that tasty. i followed the recipe exactly as it called for...the second time, i altered it by making it with pancetta instead of bacon (12 slices of pancetta) and i used pepper, like everyone suggested. it was better, but it still wasn't as good as i expected. i won't be making this again, and am in search for another carbonara recipe to try. good luck!

Loved this recipe "as is" but don't be afraid to prepare it either with cracked black or crushed red pepper depending on your taste...It's easy, satisfying and fabulous either way...A purist would make the effort to use pancetta, but thick-sliced American bacon(which is saltier)works just fine--just don't fry it crisp! Also, I ran cold water through the pasta before returning it to the pot, taking the worry out of tempering in the egg, cream & cheese mixture. This is definitely an easy dinner party for guests--add a "from scratch" Caesar salad, some crusty sourdough bread and you're ready to go!

Like everyone else, I added freshly ground black pepper of course! And we definitely used the best italian prosciutto available instead of bacon - and then, don't laugh, I added boiled egg sliced into 4 wedges as a garnish because that is how we had it in Milan. Yum. ps you can get really good carbonara in Cambodia and Thailand more often than here (USA)!

This recipe (with the addition of black pepper of course) is a solid 3 forks in our house. My husband made it as an entree for a casual dinner party - upped the recipe by 1.5 - and everyone enjoyed it. We used turkey bacon, and fat-free half and half to try to control the fat content. Served w/ a caesar salad and some roasted garlic bread. Will make again often.

In order to change this recipe to a version taht I prefer, remove the red pepper and replace it by preparing your serving bowl with caorse-ground balck pepper. Wet the bowl with a small amount of water (pour out any excess) then coat bowl with layer of black pepper. Transfer pasta into the bowl and you will have the more traditional "black coal" look and taste. Overall fairly good version though.

As far as I can tell, this dish doesn't contain a lick of black pepper. Anything purporting to be carbonara and doesn't have freshly ground BLACK PEPPER in it, is a phony. Carbonara means, basically, COAL DUST!!!! This dish should have alot of COAL DUST in it! Hence, CARBONARA!

I haven't made this but had to laugh at the indignance of the Italian purist reviewers who plainly freaked at the appropriation of a name for something deviant from the norm. I've had a native from the region of Italy where carbonara derives serve this dish to me, in Europe, and I have made it myself using Lidia Bastianich's recipe from her latest "Italian-American Kitchen" book. The latter was superior! I have no intention of fussing with this variation (and yes, cooking is an art, which allows for expressive variation...); I was only looking out of curiosity, and for comparative purposes, which, I think, is what makes a good cook even better: improving upon and refining!

My family liked this alot. I would use a little less red pepper next time.

I have tried half-and-half and light sour cream to make carbonara sauce, and they both work very well, cutting the fat waaay down. I also use pancetta instead of bacon to add flavour.

We loved this recipe. I substituted the parmesan for a greek cheese called MIZITHRA & added a few more bacon slices to the recipe. I would love to figure out how to replace the whip cream with something lighter.

I tried heating the eggs, cheese, and cream in the microwave on quick on for a few seconds before pouring the mixture over the pasta then added the proscuitto or capicollo omited the red pepper flakes

This recipe was delicious! I tried this with some button mushrooms & more pieces of honey-cured bacon which made the dish a whole lot heavier. I served this as a main course, by the way. Also, don't use red onions for this recipe; a mistake I made. It was way too strong.

This was delicious, but too much work when you've got a 2-year-old running around. Also found it to be too heavy for a main course...I would serve it as an appetizer or side dish.

Excellent. The crushed pepper sets this aside from the other carbonara dishes I have made, gives it an appeal that the other don't have. A word of warning though....have the fan on when frying the chili....it is pretty damn strong!!!

Well, the Italians are right! This is a very tasty recipe...but it looks more like somebody's spontaneous concoction than a mere variation on a classic. The original is a far cry from this recipe, and both are good. But please don't call it what it isn't.

Rating: 2
My husband and I both enjoyed this, but I think it would've been better with some more stuff in it - like julienne ham or proscuitto and some sliced mushrooms. I liked the little kick that the pepper flakes gave this dish. I won't make it again, but only because I have a better carbonara recipe...it was a good start though! And I learned a valuable lesson...bacon is a bugger to cut when raw.

Rating: 2
I liked the dish, however, I embellished a bit and added fresh sliced mushrooms that I sauteed as well as peas. I think if I didn't have these things in it the dish would have been boring. The peas added the color it was lacking. I liked it, can't say I loved it. My husband on the other hand couldn't get enough of it. Maybe I'll make it again, for him.

My husband and I both thought this was pretty good although we had it as a main course and it got too cloying half-way through it - if I made it again it would be for a first course.

Well, I goofed a bit making this dish ... I used the whole pound of linguine and I realized after I should only have used 12 oz. Therefore, I don't think I can give it a true rating ...Oh well ... needless to say, I did need the extra pasta water to thin the sauce out. Even with the slight faux pas my husband and I can still honestly say that we thought it was just so so ... maybe a bit more bacon and a smidge of butter would do the trick. I probably won't make this version again ... I have had tastier Carbonara sauces. But I wouldn't call it an Italian travesty either ... Isa and Lil - you both need to Chill!

Lilris' post: "..disgraceful fashion of interpreting *our* Carbonara to his/her own fancy way without any respect for *our* Country." The really funny thing about this is, there are probably 1000s of interpretations on this recipe in Italy itself. Prove to me, Ms. Lil, that everyone from the tip of the boot to Trieste makes carbonara the same way. I would use a good dry vermouth here. enough sweetness there already with the cream, etc.

Take a chill pill Isa, I use Shannon Irish bacon and its great, the panchetta is way to fatty and so is the american bacon. In summer when you can get your hands on some vidallia onions, its great otherwise scallions will do. Bon Appetit!!

What a sinful dish. It was a huge hit and can be served as a main course as well as a side.. With all those calories, who needs more food?

Ladies: carbonara is American! We introduced it to Italy after we invaded in '43 to save you all from the Germans; homesick GIs gathered up bacon & eggs, classically USA ingredients, and had the local paisana whip it up. So lighten up on the cultural outrage, huh? Creativity is what we're all about!

Rating: 0
I totally agree with Isa Marvelli about this awful, disgraceful fashion of interpreting our Carbonara everybody his/her own fancy way without any respect for our Country. The simplicity of this dish was such that the sauce makers had to invent something to make it mysterious and difficult and be able to sell packed so called carbonara sauce all over the world, contributing to misleading, over and over, people about this wonderful dish. It really upsets me the sight of the transparent bags of this abusively misnamed sauce. I don't say that it's a nasty sauce. I want , again agreeing with Isa, to stress the right of safeguarding the culture of a Country, and not messing about with names and products. Said this I would add something to excuse the foreign carbonara makers and eaters. I met in the U.K. a few ignorant Italian restaurateurs who offered this and other "translated" foods adding everywhere loads of cream to meet the taste of the locals. I was even served an Amatriciana topped with a pinkish creamy blob of undectable ingredients.I felt sorry because this part of our culture had been left for generations in the hands of uncultured people, emigrated to make money and selling their own country for 30 coins... But the BBC's Good Food magazine once did justice to us, recommending its readers going to visit Italy to enjoy real Italian food anywhere in that country, forgetting about the rubbish sold in the high streets trattorias in England.

This is a nice version of Carbonara albeit not "by the BOOK". What would cooking be without our little personal contributions and variations, anyway?? Signora Maravalli needs to lighten up a little.

This is the type of recipe that makes me mad. Why call it Carbonara? Carbonare is not this, as good as it might be, it is not a true Carbonare. Call it something else. Or give the original recipe and than your variation. This is done again and again and it is unsufferable, culturally incorrect.

I am a carbonara freak and this is a very good version. It is flavorful and not too sticky.

Great version of this recipe. Great flavor. Easy recipe. I used eggbeaters and a dry Italian white wine. I added some parsley for color. I'm thinking of adding sliced mushrooms the next time I make it.
