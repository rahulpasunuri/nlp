OK, so let's start with I do not love Turkey, but that said, the recipe for the stuffing was so exciting to me because I LOVE tamales. I decided this is the year to make a stuffed turkey. First, I will tell you that I did not use the butter recipe as I brined and herb buttered an organic 16 pound turkey myself. I spent more than $60 on 15 large tamales from a Oaxacan vendor at my farmer's market whose tamales I buy each week. I followed the recipe, and added the corn to the tamales. I then stuffed the bird, and had a bunch left over, so I stuffed the bird under the skin as well. The turkey itself came out delicious. The stuffing was just not good. It was just mushed up tamales that somehow did not live up to what I was hoping for. Anyway for an expensive stuffing, I would steer away from this one.

Great recipes. The count of 30 tamales was kind of high ... we used a 10lb turkey and only ended up needing 12 tamales. The butter/pepper rub is great and adds some kick! If you keep this baby basted, it will be one of the best turkeys you've ever eaten.
