Tasty. Served my "fruit soup" with slightly sweetened whipped crems. Followed the recipe exactly. However it would have been far better if it had set.

Delicious and a big hit. However, I had the same problem as the Cook from Illinois, it did not set. I am positive that it just needs more gelatin, at least one more envelope. I found the lingonberry preserves in IKEA for a good price but cranberries would be just fine. I have to try this again with more gelatin and add blueberries. Also, I am thinking about serving this with brownies.

I've made this twice and it's been great both times. Once, following the recipe exactly and once with blueberries in place of lingonberries. Unlike the first reviewer's experience, mine set as indicated in the recipe. It was pretty and delicious after a big Christmas dinner (served along with lots of heavier desserts, it was a big hit). Leftovers have been GREAT in oatmeal and cold cereal.

This was very refreshing after a heavy meal. However, I followed the recipe exactly and even did the ice bath, but I could not get it to set up at all. It turned out the consistency of cranberry sauce. If anyone has any tips, please let me know as I would love to make it again with a firmer consistency.

Wanted something to serve after a heavy Christmas dinner and thought I would try this...a little pricey but worth it. Lingonberry's were pretty spendy if you can find them ($8 at a specialty store) and I also had problems finding "unsweetened" raspberries ..so I used regular ($5 bag) and cut back the sugar. This dessert was tart and refreshing. I had never heard of a lingonberry before and after tasting them for the first time I would easily substitue cranberry jelly and maybe toss in a tablespoon or 2 of grape jelly. Overall it was a real hit and I am definitely going to make it a regular addition to my dessert recipes.

loved it. The puddings served with homemade vanilla ice cream at our last dinner party were a real smash. I recommended it to a friend who is looking for low-fat desserts and she is excited to try it.
