Very tasty and moist, with a good balance of flavors. The cardamom gives it a really nice spice.

The cake is delicious. I made frosting with a stick of butter & about 1/2 a box of powdered sugar, plus a bit of milk and about a teaspoon of rose flower water (not rose extract), which really made it delicious. It came together quickly and easily. Once the cake cooled, it was really sturdy, so I understand why the person who used it to make a wedding cake had such success.

I made about 15 times this volume and turned it into a wedding cake, with a vanilla-orange cream cheese frosting off of the raspberry fondant wedding cake. It holds up really well as a wedding cake because of the density, and tastes delicious.

I made this cake for a dinner party and it was a great success. I added a nice rose buttercream frosting and decorated it with chopped pistachios for a little added flair.

This cake is a mega hit and really easy to do!!! to kick it up a notch and make it more fancy looking - I also make a frosting & do a thin light frosting layer over the whole cake using all the main spices from this recipe (regular icing) plus orange zest, cardamom, vanilla extract...then sprinkle some pistachio nut bits on top to make it look fancy...each time I make this cake, it always gets finished...perfect for people who don't want something SUPER sweet, but just really interesting and delicious!

This is a bit of an unusual cake, but it's delicious and just sweet enough.

It was good. I think the whipping cream is a must; I made mine with brown sugar instead of powdered sugar. Also served with raspberries. Was good. Not sure I'd make again because there are so many other delicious desserts to try and this wasn't phenomenal.

HELLO all, I'm going to be making this recipe tonight, do you think that salted pistacios will make a difference if i omit the salt?

I increased the pistachios to 1 cup, used skim milk + whipping cream to substitue the milk, used lemon zest instead of orange zest and baked in a 13*9" sheet pan instead of round cake pan for exactly 20 minutes . It is really really good! It is very moist, the combination of pistachio and lemon is amazing. I think its flavorful enough for what it is. I am going to make a lemon cream cheese frosting to go on top of it!

aromatic, too good to be true when served with real whipped cream

I had high hopes for this cake after reading the reviews. Have made several nut-based cakes over the years and have liked them. This one was very middle of the road. Can assure you no one at our dinner party wanted the recipe. Was neither full-flavored nor subtly delicious. Smelled great while baking, but it didn't translate into the finished product.

A WINNER, FLAVORS BALANCE ONE ANOTHER NICELY. SERVED WITH ORANGE SEGMENTS MASCERATED IN GRAND MARNIER AND WHIPPED CREAM. A TAD SHORT ON THE ORANGE RIND SO I ADDED ABOUT 1/4 TSP OF ORANGE OIL. PERFECT. EVERYONE WANTED THE RECIPE

I agree with others who have raved about this cake. Best the day it's made. I served it with orange sections (de-membraned, which isn't a verb, but you know . . .) mixed with chopped dates, whipped cream and then my own invention, pistachios, sugar, a date and orange zest whirled in the food processor then sprinkled over the whipped cream and oranges. Delicious.

This appears to be an Epicurious upgrade of the Gourmet cake of 2001. Notably, the most popular user suggestion was incorporated i.e. reducing the butter to a single stick. I agree with all of the reviews on the Gourmet cake: this cake is fantastic! I called it a "flavor explosion" - there was so much going on, and it was so delicious, it was quite exciting to bake such a unique cake. I baked it for someone else, but was able to eat some trimmings. Now I want to bake the whole thing for myself. Do note I only had 1 TBSP of orange zest, and that amount in the cake was perfect for me. I baked the recipe in two 6" rounds so I could stack and fill the cake. Took approx 37min.

This cake was the hit of a dinner party. Frosted with slighty sweetened whip cream, necessitating that the cake be kept refrigerated. Next time I will just dust with powdered sugaqr and serve the whip cream on the side as the cake is much better at room temp.

I made this cake into a layer cake, frosted it with Creamy Vanilla Frosting and topped it with toasted pistachios. I didn't have a food processor, so I had to make due with finely chopping the pistachios, which gave the cake some texture. The final product was delicious. Very moist and just the right amount of spice. The lightly sweet frosting balanced out the fragrance of the cake. It was perfectly paired with a cup of English breakfast tea!

Yes, the cake tastes good, but you won't taste the pistachio flavor. The primary reason I made the cake was to get the pistachio flavor, but it's non- existent. And I was using Persian pistachios, which have a ton more flavor (eaten raw) than American or Turkish pistachios.

Fabulous. The flavors were all superbly balanaced. I served this with slightly sweetened whipped cream flavored with a drop of orange flower water.

Absolutely fantastic taste and consistency (denser than traditional cakes). We ate it alone, but it would go well with vanilla ice cream.

Followed the recipe to a T, and it came out wonderfully. Served it with homemade pistachio ice cream - double delight! My family loved it.

My guests raved over this cake and asked for the recipe. The cardamom and orange zest wake up those taste buds and say, "I love this!" Excellent with vanilla ice cream and warmed cake.

Nice simple recipe. Deep flavors. Cardamom can be hard to find...try Whole Foods or an Indian food store.
