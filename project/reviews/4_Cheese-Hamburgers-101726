These burgers were very good. On a charcol grill blending the cheese into the meat worked better than a slice on top of the burger. I grated the cheese and the onion with a Cuisenart and then mixed them into the the beef. Very nice.

I've made this recipe 4-5 times over the past 6 weeks. It has turned out perfect each time. Incredibly juicy burgers with nice flavor.On one occasion we ran out of gas on the BBQ mid-cook so I had to finish them on the stove...still came out moist! I will never use another burger recipe. This is easy and super foolproof. Enjoy!

Me again! Didn't use the bacon, (didn't have any) but they still turned out fantastic!

Moist and very tasty. I loved the addition of grated onion and cheese. These are the best burgers ever. I can see why this recipe has lasted. Will make these again and again and again!

Fantastic tip from the recipe for plain hamburgers to not touch the meat too much. Made all the difference to the juiciness of the burgers! I made these with soy sauce as didn't have worcestshire and no bacon and they were still excellent.

This is a delicious recipe. I skipped the bacon, and added two eggs. The burgers stayed whole, and were absolutely delicious!!

these burgers were awesome, even though I forgot to add the ground pepper haha. I wrapped each burger with 5 strips of bacon, though, instead of the single strip given in the recipe. they were awesome! next time I will cook these a bit longer, though. they weren't raw or anything, but they were very moist and I think the bacon on the outside could have been a bit crispier.

I will never make just ground beef patties again! These were wonderful flavor additions. I feel silly never thinking of adding that stuff before:) It was even great w/o the cheese (if you have guests who don't want cheese) Have left over meat, and think I'll make a little meatloaf!

My mom and me made these a bunch of times and they are really good.

I concur with many and added an extra 1/2 cup of cheese (for a total of 1 cup). I also used about 3/4 of the onion. Overall, this burger tastes like the ones I enjoy when you're traveling and find that great "dive" bar or greasy spoon place to eat. Good burger that we'll definitely make again.

this was a wonderful recipe. added onion soup mix instead of grating an onion. used more cheese than asked for and used two strips of bacon (as previous reviewers had recommended). the burgers were a big hit and i'll definitely made them again

tried this recipe after making the mustard dill burger a couple of months ago. i preferred this burger, as did my wife. prep time was marginal (for which i am a big fan) + burgers came out very juicy.

Only okay. If you are using good meat (like we were for the Fourth), it is kind of a waste because the burger tastes clumpy even if it held together during the cooking.

Yummy!!!! I also took the advice of others and added the two strips of bacon and I also added an egg so they did not fall apart on the grill....Just perfect!!!!

This is an excellent recipe! I did take some advice to the other people that have added there comments and agree that you should increase the amount of the cheese and make it with 2 strips of bacon. I noticed that everyone who were making there burgers on the grill commented that there's fell apart. I used the Foreman grill and it came out excellent nice and juicey and all in one piece. I also added provolone cheese. Great recipe!!

A simply delicious and easy alternative to simple burgers! I didn't have a problem with the burgers falling apart as some have complained, but I also put in half the amount of onion and I grated them into a separate container so that I could separate out some of the liquid the grating produces. One surprising thing about this recipe was that after I cooked the burgers, it was impossible to tell them from ordinary plain burgers by looking at them.

Yummy...Added 3/4 cup of cheddar and next time I may add more. I also added some Colemans mustard powder for some added zing. In order to keep it together I used 2 slices of bacon to form an X.

Instead of grating the onion, which makes it watery, I added finely minced onion and had no problem with the burgers staying together while cooking. I also used two slices of bacon and criss-crossed them. We ate them without buns since we are on a low-carb diet. They were delicious!

Very tasty; you may want to chill shaped patty's 30 min. or so prior to pan broiling. The cheese and grated onion makes the meat too loose to grill outdoors. Get that ole black skillet out and just do it! You will be surprised...

Delicious and easy to make!

I had trouble with these burgers falling apart. The onion was quite liquidy after I grated it so perhaps that was part of the problem. I also found that a 1/2 lb. of beef per person resulted in burgers that were way too big. The taste was good though so I will definitely try this recipe again.

Very good indeed. Moist with good onion flavor although Lipton onion soup mix might do you as well. Next time I make it I will add more cheese. Overall though it was quite tasty and moist.
