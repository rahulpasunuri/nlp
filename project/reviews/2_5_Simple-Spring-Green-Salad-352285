remember that kosher for passover doesn't allow anything fermented...that includes vinegar. so this recipe serves a purpose in that way.

This seemingly ridiculously simple recipe actually serves a purpose in the context of the menu that it is part of, if you read the note at the beginning of it. Most cooks would put lemon juice or vinegar or something else acidic in their standard simple green salad--I know I would. I would never think to use just oil and salt; however, no acid really goes way better with the other dishes in the menu, so for me at least, this was a very helpful tip.

Is a "recipe" really necessary? boo.
