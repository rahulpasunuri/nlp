I've made this 3-4 times now, with very few alterations. I use a Greek liqueur similar to port and I don't use the butter (it's missed one whit). If you have a little fresh mint, that perks up the parsely. This is a super easy, impressive recipe. Serve with rice to soak up the addictive sauce (you MUST use non-pre-pitted Kalamatas; save the mushrooms for another dish). Creamed spinach rounded out our meal last time I made this. Tawny port is not of one vintage Conoy. It's a blend. I like it best for drinking myself...

Just made this. It was outstanding especially the sauce. I wasn't sure about using olives, but they worked very well. Made as written except I added some fresh rosemary to the crust mixture and used dried thyme and added a tsp of herbs de provence to the reduction. I added a tbl of red wine vinager at the end. The sauce was outstaning even if it did overpower the taste of the lamb. Can anyone tell me in a subsequent review the difference between ruby and tawney port.

This is about the best rack of lamb I have had anywhere! I used panko instead of the bread crumbs, and I loved it. My husband didn't even use ketchup, which is the ultimate compliment.

This was an awesome dish that was so impressive to make and the flavors were to dies for. I will make it again, maybe even next week.

I made this for my new husband for Valentines Day, and it was an incredible hit. went wonderfully with "goat cheese mashed potatoes". fine-restaurant quality, and fairly easy.

We thought this was excellent. I didnt have low sodium broth, so sauce was kind of salty. Will make sure to have low-sodium on hand next time. Agree with previous reviewers that shrooms would probably be great in the sauce too. Preparation quite easy too-this recipe has it all!

Simply fantastic. I made this for company, and everyone loved it - saying it was the best dinner EVER. 30 minutes cooking time was exactly right- 25 minutes was a little too rare. I, like another reader, served it with Bon Appetit's Goat Cheese Mashed Potatoes, and they both complimented each other perfectly. Don't change a thing on this recipe (or the potatoes) - they are PERFECT the way they are - and elegant and gourmet for company. YUM!

Being lamb lovers we tried this recipe and loved it! Although I loved the olives, my boyfriend thought they were a bit overpowering and would also agree with another reviewer on the mushroom substitution. When making this recipe, we compromised after reading the other reviews and added both olives and mushrooms. I would do both / either again.

This is great! So simple yet so delicious! The sauce tastes yummy and it thickened up nicely and added so much punch to the lamb, but even without it, the breading and mustard made the lamb taste wonderful! 25-30 minutes is perfect for rare to medium done. The lamb was tender and juicy. One of my guests said he had been to an expensive, trendy restaurant weeks earlier and paid $40.00 for a lamb dish that ended up dry and bland. He was impressed, as were all my dinner guests, with this recipe. I definitely will make this again. I served it with roasted potatoes and a spring salad w/apples and pecans. The potatoes and salad took longer to prepare than this recipe, yet this was the hit of the dinner! Wish I was eating it now! Yummy for our tummies! Oh, I do recommend using the low-sodium beef and chicken stocks.

Delicious. My dinner guests seemed to enjoy it too. The sauce made the meal. I served it with goat cheese mashed potatoes and a saute of vegetables.

Easy to prepare & very popular with guests. Also great if you use mushrooms instead of olives!

The lamb and crust was excellent. I've made it twice - the second time I skipped the sauce and didn't miss it.

The lamb is easy and delicious - two great features! The olives and stock make the sauce quite salty, so use low-salt stock if available. Our rack of lamb cooked quickly with 20 minutes being more than enough time for medium rare.
