This is horrible. Please don't waste your time and money. If I am not mistaken, fried chicken should be crispy? It started well, the chicken was a crunch golden brown.... then I added the water. The whole thing turned soft and the breading fell off. I could have had soft-crust with a T.V. dinner! I am shocked that this is the best Epi has to offer. I'm usually happy with my selections, but this was such a disappointment. I tried the recipe the next day without water, I just covered it and cooked it for about 30 minutes and it was great. And I'm no 'new' cook, I followed the directions to a T.

It looked beautiful until the step to add the water--then it started to stick. I don't know if it was me or the pan or what. Flavor was good, but a lot of mess and trouble.

Followed recipe for chick (not a gravy fan) and fried in electric fryer. In a word: yum.

This recipe is very delicious.I added some garlic, onion,and green bell pepper, and all purpose seasoning instead if salt. I also marinated the chicken instead of addiding the salt to the flour. My husband loved it.I've got to try it again soon.

First time I read this recipe, it seemed like a strange way to make fried chicken, but now there is no other fried chicken recipe for me. Absolutely delicious -- I go back to this again & again.

Simply delicious. This is wonderful comfort food. My only regret was that I hadn't made biscuits to go with the extra gravy.

Moist inside, crispy outside and simply delicious on a hot summer day. Perfect chicken that is timeless. Thanks.

In a word: Delicious! The simple seasonings & the browning made for a great flavor combination. The addition of the water helped ensure moist chicken. As a previous reviewer pointed out, the water does boil away. Very easy to prepare, too.

I highly recommend this recipe. I was skeptical about adding water to the fried chicken in the skillet, but it dried up fast and made the chicken meat real tasty. Instead of water though, I used chicken broth which I thought would add more flavor than water.

This is the fried chicken of my dreams! Juicy and tender, yet crispy--even fantastic cold the next day! I'll never make fried chicken any other way again!

A great recipe! I hadn't fried chicken in at least 10 years, but cooking the chicken in water after frying intriqued me. This was big hit at my house.

Being a southern man, I have always felt gravy making ability was in the genes. It's something I've always just known how to do. However, I decided to go exactly by this recipe. Covering the chicken while frying and adding the water after the initial frying leaves you with the juiciest chicken I've ever encountered. Everything about this beautifully simple recipe is perfect. This is minimalism at it's finest.
