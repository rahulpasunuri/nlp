Loved this recipe!!!! I made this cake for my friend's birthday while on vacation and decided to add angostura bitters to the cream cheese frosting, since there was some in the cottage. Wonderful!!! Go easy on it, though....a little goes a long way!

This cake was delicious and super easy (I don't bake cake often.). As per another user's review I cut the baking powder and baking soda in half and it worked great. I also used sliced almonds instead of walnuts (didn't have them) and added a teaspoon of ginger, teaspoon of vanilla extract and half a teaspoon of nutmeg. Also, I didn't think the frosting was going to make enough at first but once it whipped up it ended up being more then sufficient. Nom nom nom.

I do love Joan Nathan's recipes but this one doesn't quite do it. There is too much baking soda and baking powder and it leaves a funny after-taste. Also, i don't see a need for cream cheese AND butter...in the frosting... i could have done without the extra fat and butter flavor.

Not "the best" carrot cake recipe I've ever tried, but certainly the easiest and the one requiring the least number of ingredients. Everybody liked it. I did make extra frosting and sliced the cake into two halves so I cut put some frosting in between, which I also topped with some shredded coconut. Moist cake :)
