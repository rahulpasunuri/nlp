I've made this for several dinner parties and it has been a consistent pleaser. I increase the balsalmic vinegar for the sauce to 4 tablespoons. I am actually thinking about using this sauce for Thanksgiving this year as I believe it would would be great with turkey.

I really rate this 3 1/2 forks! I thought the amount of Dijon mustard- 3 tablespoons- was a bit overwhelming. I am going to try it next time with 2 tablespoons and cut the garlic back to 2 cloves. I used chestnuts out of a jar and it worked fine. I was able to drizzle the sauce- not really a glaze- over the tenderloins with some to spare. I loved it- but some members of my family who ate it with me found it just a bit overwhelming.

Didn't have the sage, but still this was a great way to break in the oven at my new apartment. I agree with the chestnut quantity being kind of high..but it was great!

Delicious and easy. Agree with the other reviewers' tips: Great with acorn squash Less mustard. I used 1 TBSP, grainy mustard. Was plenty. Much less chestnuts. Used 1 cup, and next time I'll use 1/2 cup. More sage. Love fresh sage. Used 4 tsp.

My new favorite! So easy to make and super nice looking. I couldn't find chestnuts anywhere so I used walnuts, and I just sprinkled them on towards the end instead of cooking them. It turned out delicious. My boyfriend was very impressed!

I thought this dish was exceptional. I did not use chestnuts at all and used ground sage instead of fresh(only because I didn't have any). I chopped the garlic very fine. My whole family - including all four children voted this recipe a keeper.

Marinating the pork in balsamic vinegar and oil was a really good idea. The chestnuts were a waste of time and money. We used really large garlic cloves which seemed to be a bit overwhelming. The "glaze" was a joke because of the amount of chestnuts. I'll marinate it like this again, but I'll make my own glaze for it.

This really was good and I will definetly make it again! I suggest that it be served with acorn squash - it was a great combination!

I have made this several times and we all love it. My guests raved and called me back for the recipe. I have made it both with and without the chestnuts. Either way is delicious.

This turned out very well. If using fresh roasted chestnuts I would allow plenty of extra time to roast and peel them. The sauce seemed to go over well, but I increased the amount of butter and sugar a little bit and added an extra tablespoon each of water and balsamic to keep from getting too dry. The mustard was a little too intense, so the next time I make it I will try some milder honey Dijon and spread it a little thinner.

We loved it, made it for a friend who's never had chestnuts, what a nice way to introduce them. Will make this again.

I don't like mustard, so skipped it, but the chestnut balsamic glaze was fantastic. I have made it a couple times and its wonderful winter meal.

This dish was very simple and extremely good.

As others have said, I would cut way back on the chestnuts, We also had to BBQ our Pork Tenderloin because we lost power on Christmas day. The recipe still turn outstanding.

We made this for a dinner party and people raved about it for the next week. Yes, the sauce isn't really a glaze but it tastes wonderful. We used chestnuts from a jar so that we didn't have to shell a lot of nuts and it worked great! I agree that you could cut back on the amount of nuts needed or increase the liquid/nut ratio if you want it to be more of a glaze but we liked it as is.

I would like to know if the recipes in Bon Appetit are actually tried by the creators. This recipe is ridiculous. The so-called "glaze" (if one follows the recipe) looks more like stuffing. What a disaster. Never again will I try a recipe from this mag!!!

Are we using chestnuts or Hazlenuts???The name says chestnuts and the remarks at the bottom of recipe explains how to prepare the hazlenuts????

This was wonderful - I got extra hugs and raves from my husband. I agree with the prior reviewer that some adjustments to the glaze ingredients are in order. I used about half the amount of chestnuts called for and substituted low salt chicken stock for the water, using about twice as much as indicated in the recipe. We didn't think the garlic was at all overwhelming; in fact, all the flavors blended together beautifully. This one will definitely be back for an encore.

My problem with this recipe isn't with the pork tenderloin, it's with the balsamic glaze. The amount of chopped chestnuts is much too high, especially considering the spare amount of liquids (3T. each of balsamic vinegar and water); both are either instantly absorbed into the starchy chestnuts, or reduce out immediately. After sprinkling over the sliced pork medallions (forget the "drizzling" called for in the recipe), the dish was difficult to eat and overpowered by garlic. A pourable Balsamic reduction, peppered with a fine chop of chestnuts, would work much better.

The Pork Tenderloin portion of this recipe is fine; it's the Chestnut-balsamic glaze that I have a problem with. The amount of chestnuts is way too high to qualify this sauce as a glaze, especially considering the small amount of liquids added (3T. each of balsamic vinegar and water, all of which is either instantly absorbed or reduced right out). After "sprinkling" over the sliced pork loin (forget the "drizzle" in the recipe), it was difficult for my guests to eat. Also, the amount of garlic is too high. This sauce needs to be reworked; a glossy balsamic reduction, peppered with a fine dice of chestnuts, would work much better than the "chutney" (for lack of a better word) that you wind up with in this recipe.
