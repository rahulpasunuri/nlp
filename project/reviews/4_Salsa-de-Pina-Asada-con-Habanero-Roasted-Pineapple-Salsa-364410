The roasted pineapple makes this an outstanding salsa recipe. Caveat emptor: 2 habanero chiles deliver serious heat. Use only one, or replace with jalapenos if you prefer a milder salsa.

Excellent salsa. Used leftovers as an appetizer on crisp, salty pita triangles. The combination is fantastic blend of salt, sweet, hot and spicy. Cut pitas in 4 triangles. Separate front/back to make 8 triangles. Spray w/small amt oil and sprinkle w/kosher salt. Toast in toaster oven until light brown. Cool to crisp. Serve w/Salsa.

I made this for Cinco de Mayo and everyone loved it. I used only one habanero for one batch, and used one habanero with seeds for the second. That way, everyone was satisfied. It is easy to make and easy to adjust.

unbelievably delicious, and so easy to make. only used one habanero so it wasn't too spicy for the kids. was a perfect side for the carnitas.

This is an amazing and delicious recipe. Perfect for carnitas. The heat of the habanero and sweetness of the grilled pineapple are incredible together. Make sure to season well!

Made this for Cinco de Mayo and everyone loved it. I realized when I was pulling the ingredients out of the fridge that my habanero's had gone bad so I just left them out and it was still quite tasty. Served with Shrimp and chicken tacos and good with chips as well.
