I make a variation of this almost every day! Just to clarify for people who don't get the "dashi" thing... it is fish stock and essential to the flavour just as vegetable/chicken/beef stock is to western dishes.... By the way: "bonito" is the fish used to make dashi. For VEGETARIANS: The main alternative for fish stock ("dashi") is "kombu", a sea kelp rich in nutrients and flavour. It is used in all kinds of Japanese dishes with or without fish stock. It can be found at any asian grocerer, and most healthy/organic food stores, dried and ready to go. It adds that dimension you would be missing without dashi and is delicious in and of itself. Good luck all! Miso and other Japanese flavours are very subtle to our Western palates and could be otherwise construed as "bland". I didn't care for it at first myself... and some people never do... it's food and that = personal taste!

Don't bother making this without Dashi. And then add seaweed, mushrooms, etc. I'll make it again but not without Dashi.

Not bad if you're having stomach problems, but a bit of scallion, shiitake, seaweed, and daikon would give this a bit more body.

I didn't actually make this, and wouldn't because it looks very bland, like it's missing something. Once I read the reviews, everyone's comments about Dashi intrigued me. I didn't know what it was until now, and after I looked it up. Not that I wouldn't use it, but I am wondering if anyone knows if there is a vegetarian alternative (since it consists of the bonito flakes)?

okay... I'll try another variation on the 'miso soup' theme next time. ;)

Dashi is essential for miso soup. My two favorites are w/ kabocha & w/ onion & bacon. (these are authentic because I'm Japanese and my grandma used make them) Just simmer the ingredients in dashi and add miso before turning off the heat.

try this instead: 2 C water 1 tsp dashi 1/4 cup shiro miso 1/4 c tofu in 1/4 inch cubes 1 chopped green onions Add dashi to hot water. Do Not boil. Stir in miso and tofu and continue to heat for a couple of minutes. Serve with scallions sprinkled on top.

Dame desu! No bonito. This is pathetic. Didn't even make it. Don't even bother printing this kind of junk- It is NOT miso shiru.

Bland!

One more vote against making miso without dashi. Even in a small midwestern city, it is possible to get kombu and bonito flakes to make dashi from scratch, or dashi crystals if you're in a hurry- Go to any asian grocery. It's worth the effort.

You MUST have Dashi. It is so simple to make--- boil some kooombu seaweed in water and drain after about 20 minutes. Use this instead of soup. Burdock root is a great healing food and goes great in miso soup, as does bok choy

No water - can use veggie stock or seaweed stock or something like that but no no for water ! Has to have that special taste otherwise no go !

Not using the ingredients that give a recipe its character, perhaps because they are a bit controversial, is a very bad idea.

This soup is not worth the making if you don't use dashinomoto. Hondashi powder should be readily available at any Asian grocery store.
