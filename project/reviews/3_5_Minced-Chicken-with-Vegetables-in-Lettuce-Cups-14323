Excellent recipe! It's one of our regular dinners. I usually double the recipe. When I have to get dinner in a rush, I use either ground turkey or ground chx and it's still wonderful. Also use sake instead of wht wine and add 1 tsp grated ginger.

Very good. We tripled the recipe which would be great for 3 people as entrees. Be aware of the prep time: it took me almost 1 hour 45 minutes to complete. I'd make a few mods: 1) Use the same food processor from the chicken to shop the water chestnuts and red bell to save some time. 2) The oyster and hoisin sauces are already pretty salty, so delete the incremental salt (two places in this recipe) 3) There's no need for the egg white- except to make the overall color too light. I'd delete it. 4) There's no need for the pine nuts...I don't think they worked well with the other ingredients.

This recipe is great, although a lot of work... My husband loves it and says it's better than the lettuce cups at Yank Sing (famous dim sum place in San Francisco).

One of the complaints was around the chicken tasting bland. While the chicken shouldn't be bland, it's not exactly bursting with flavor either. What the recipe is missing is the dipping sauce! Try the Ginger dipping sauce or the Vietnamese Lime sauce both found on the site.

This was really good. I don't understand how this could get a bad review. The flavors were subtle (as opposed to strong and smotherd with soy sauce) and are fine exactly how the recipe was written. The only change I would make is using iceburg lettuce.

I was not crazy about this recipe. I thought that the cornstarch made the chicken mixture a little gooey. The chicken mixture also seemed a little flat and flavorless -- perhaps some thai chilis or red pepper flakes would spice it up a little. I also used iceberg lettuce and used dry sherry instead of wine.

This was a great recipe - lighten up weirdos! No one has a sense of humor? I'm sure she euthanized the rabbit before she killed it! Saratoga and San Jose, I have a book club if ya wanna join...and we don't talk about the books naturally...;)

We love this recipe and make it often. We think it is just as good as most restaurant versions.

i loved this! i served with jasmine rice and steamed veggies on the side - i used ground chicken instead and cooked it up that way - saved time - used iceburg for more texture and added slivered (not sliced or grated)carrots to the mix - as good as any restaurant

I used a 1/2lb. of ground turkey instead, and it was great! And to save time I didn't pre-cook or boil the meat, I just mixed the sauce, garlic and oil mixtures together in a skillet and cooked the ground turkey in it. It was awesome! I served it with some Duck sauce for topping, and a side of fried rice. This was a great change from the usual mid-week same old. It was quick, flavorful, and filling.

My Mom has made these lettuce cups at least 20 times for all occations and nobody ever gets sick of them. I would say that they are almost as good as P.F. Changs.

I made these last night. Soooo delicious! I'm not crazy about red peppers so I substituted shitake mushrooms and green onions. I can't wait to make it again, and try some different vegetables. I used iceberg lettuce - it was perfect, I think Boston would have been too delicate

I tried this recipe and it was very easy although I suggest the pine nuts where they are listed be moved out from under the "for the sauce" they ended up in my sauce :( and had to re-do. I too substituted boston lettuce for iceberg(trying to recreate pf changs lettuce cups...to no avail). I added crimini mushrooms, green onion and slivered carrots to the mixture,which added nice color/moisture! I skipped the hoisen sauce and made extra "sauce" added ground pine nuts to it and poured over chicken before wrapping drippy but smackdillyicious!!

Delicious. I added some chinese dried mushrooms and soybean sprouts. My daughter, who HATES vegetables asks for these again and again. And my hubby who is watching his cholesterol, enjoys this as well. It's a highly adaptable recipe and I'll be adding even more veggies to this the next time! Great for the entire family!

I love this recipe. I didn't have chicken so I used some leftover rabbit. I am alergic to cornstarch so I substituted arrowroot. Had a bit of a problem with the bottle so I used chicken stock instead of wine. The rabbit had eaten all my lettuce (before I killed it) so I stuffed the mixture in celery. No eggs (allergic), egg substitutes. Left out the nuts, bell pepper, oyster sauce, sugar, white peeper, salt. Doubled up on the garlic and used A1 sauce to hold it togeher, outstanding!.......................THE DISH IS DELICIOUS AS WRITTEN AND MOST OF YOU ARE AS RIDICULOUS AS MY SUBSTITUTIONS.

I too was looking for a recipe for Lettuce Wraps that are served at PF Changs here in Arizona. I found that with "doctoring up" this recipe, I could get pretty close. I subbed iceberg lettuce for Boston Lettuce. I added a tablespoon of prepared giner to the sauce. I also added 2 cloves of garlic, sushi vinegar, portebella mushrooms, julliened carrots and julliened green onions instead of red pepper. Oh, and about an 1/8 cup of soy sauce to the sauce. It was fabulous! (I tried to get those clear, Asian noodles at my local market, but they didn't have any in stock.) I am making this tomorrow night again!

Well, I was hoping it would taste as good as PF Changs, however, mine was very bland and very wet. Maybe if I reduced the amount of oil?

Excellent recipe. Got rave reviews and will serve at my next dinner party.

Great taste and worth the preparation time. These taste like a knock off recipe for one of my favorite Asian Infusion Restaurants (a chain on the west coast). Instead of pine nuts, I top these with deep fried maifun noodles. Will make again.

Traditionally, this dish is made w/ preserved sausage or preserved meat (chinese style, of course, which you can purchase at any Chinese supermarket) instead of chicken. The flavor is much more intense. As for the lettuce part, I agree that iceberg lettuce is more than sufficient. The lettuce is used to give the dish a crispy texture while adding a bit more fun eating it. In fact, this is how they serve it at even the gourmet restaurants (Shangri-la, for instance). Butter lettuce just takes too much flvaor from the filling, which is the true meaning of this dish. I guess they use butter lettuce so the customer will feel getting the best value out of it. Nonetheless, this is not a bad alternative Americanized version of Chinese dish.

This was fabulous! I used iceberg lettuce, which is far sturdier than Boston lettuce and is the lettuce I've eaten this dish with in Chinese homes and restaurants. I mixed a heaping tablespoon of the hoisin in with the sauce instead of spreading it on the leaves - less messy and far tastier!

This was delicious!! I agree, totally better than PF Chang's! I used iceberg lettuce. Great the next day as well.

These are good and fun to try. I used cooked chicken (it was all I had) and they were still pretty good! Really pretty easy as well.

Flavor is awesome, but I would never use butter lettuce again; too hard to eat. Perhaps hearts of Romaine or Endive. It is absolutely unnecessary to boil the chicken first. Just saute in a wok. Enjoy.

This dish was excellent. I used iceberg lettuce and left out the wine and pine nuts and it was still great.

I used shrimp instead of Chicken. I have served it for 2 parties and it has been completely eaten both times. My husband gave it the "Restaurant Quality". I think it is better than PF Chang.

My husband loved this, but I made it with ribeye steaks that I had left and chopped them up in the processor. Next time I will use the chicken and I will probably raise it to four forks. I also kicked it up a notch with some Sczechwan seasoning and am glad I did.

Great recipe. I used iceberg lettuce and served hot mustard and duck sauce for those who wanted it. Next time I'd be inclined to serve it over the lettuce instead of rolling it up. Also, I'm not sure if boiling the chicken mixture is necessary. Any comments?

I substituted ground turkey for the chicken, and added sambal oloek to the sauce for a bit more spice. I served hoisin spiced (with a bit of sambal oloek)on the side, and let everyone wrap their own. My guests loved this healthy, low fat appetizer.
