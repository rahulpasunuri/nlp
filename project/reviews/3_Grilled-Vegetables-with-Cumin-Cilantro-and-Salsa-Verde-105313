I definitely recommend MILD salsa verde - we tried medium and had to do a midnight run to get another bottle of mild b/c it was too spicey. Also, par-boil the potatoes before grilling otherwise they will not cook up or will burn trying. Otherwise, the dish was fabulous!!! We also added eggplant to the list of veggies. Beware, though, making the dish with the suggested amount of veggies is a meal unto itself...we had to have two giant platters!

Make sure to get a mild salsa verde. If you like to spice it up a little, I find the addition of a chipolte hot sauce a very good match with the rest of the ingredients. The one thing I did differently to this recipe was the addition of honey. The added sweetness really sets it off I think. This marinade works particularly well with red and yellow bell peppers and sweet onions such as Vadalia or Walla Walla. The leftover veggies can be marinated in a olive oil and vinegar mixture and used for salads. I make these all summer long during grill season and always make extras.

This was really good - but lots of prep time for chopping and you have to be attendtive when you are grilling because you grill in phases.

Not my favorite grilled vegetable. I love salsa and cumin, but the combination overpowered the vegetables I thought. Maybe my salsa was to hot.

These were probably the best vegetables I have ever eaten. However, I did chill the vegetables in the sauce for nearly 24 hours.
