This is a quick and easy weeknight dinner. I love the texture of udon and I usually add lots of scallions and sometimes a shredded carrot for extra crunch.

I love this recipe and have made variations on this recipe countless times. The mirin is great because it has a more mild flavor and is sweeter than rice wine vinegar. I never measure the ingredients - but generally use a little more mirin than soy sauce - and I find that the quality of the soy sauce does impact the flavor. Also you can make it with any combo of veggies - last night I did it with bean sprouts, broccoli and red pepper. And its even better the next day when the noodles have absorbed the sauce. It's so easy you have to try it.

Made as a warm dish instead of cold since I don't like cold noodles and meat. The sauce is what killed this dish - bland, salty and lacking something I can't quite identify.

Nothing special.

We followed the recipe, but this was pretty bad. It was unbearably salty and we threw out the rest, which we have never done with an Epicurious recipe before.

Yum! Followed the recipe exactly except that I added broccoli to the chicken mixture and omitted the spinach. Delicious. My kids loved it and asked if we could have it again for dinner tomorrow night. Next time I'll add some red bell pepper and baby corn along with the broccoli.

This was a delicious and easy udon dish. I used about 1/2 tablespoon of crushed ginger from a jar instead of the fresh ginger and it turned out great. I also marinated the chicken for while before cooking it.

This recipe has good flavor, but the presentation and eating experience was 'blah'. A stir fried vegetable medley added to it would really make it a great one-dish meal.

We love this dish -- especially on a hot summer night. I marinated the chicken for about an hour. The only other change I made was to substitute soba noodles for the udon.

I made the recipe as instructed and had a few bites, wasn't impressed. It was soupy and I am not a big fan of cold noodles. I decided to throw it in a wok and reheat it , as one of my favorite dishes at an asian restaurant in London is called "teppan fried udon". The end result was amazing. The liquid mix thickened to stick to the noodles and it tasted delicious! It is three forks this way. I would hold off on the spinach until heating the noodles and mix on the wok next time.

very tasty. mine came out quite spicy, but cooling. I used tofu, and it soaked up the ginger quite nicely. this will be a new summer easy-dinner favorite for me.

I made this last night, and ate some leftovers for lunch today -- excellent! I made it with low-sodium soy sauce, but it still tastes pretty salty -- is there any way to take a little more of the salt out -- i love the taste, but i feel like my blood pressure is going to spike!

This is an excellent dish that I've made at least a dozen times. I also go heavy on the sauce and marinate the chicken for at least 4 hours or more. I have always served it hot instead of chilled and it's always a winner. If you're a real ginger lover, used the discarded ginger (after squeezing the juice from it) to make Hot and Sour Soup with Ginger also on this website. It goes great with these noodles.

This was really, really delicious! Very easy to make, and good for leftovers, especially if you make the noodles fresh each day (they can get soggy in the fridge/microwave). I added more spinach to balance the veggie/meat/carb ratio.

I agree with the cook from Cincinnati. This was good, but I would have liked more sauce. I'll try it again, though, because I feel like it should have been better.

This is a lovely, tasty light meal. I doubled the chili paste as others suggested, and it was perfect. I also prefered it served on a bed of raw baby spinach, rather than cooking the spinach with the noodles.

Excellent. Looking forward to making it again in summer.

I use boneless chicken thighs for this dish and it is awesome! I make it all the time as it is sooooo easy and tastes just great.

We have made this dish - literally - more than 20 times. Its fantastic. We chill the udon and the spinach, and serve the chicken warm over top - a very nice contrast.

Made it without the chicken as a side dish to Chilean sea bass. Sauce was tasty (especially on the spinach), but not thick enough to transfer well with the udon noodles.

I have made this a few times, and it is tasty. I would recommend only using fresh udon, though, since I did not enjoy it nearly as much when made with dry. Also, I followed the advice of others and doubled the chile paste. Great dish to enjoy in the summer.

This was such a tasty and simple dish! I marinated the chicken overnight instead of tossing it just before cooking. Also I had a hard time squeezing the liquid out of the ginger so I put it through my garlic press and it worked fine.

I also marinated the chicken for an hour or so and used more ginger and more chile paste than was called for. Plus I cooked the udon the way the package said to--not the way the recipe instructs.

I enjoyed this quite a bit. I ended up with brown-rice udon, and barely wilted the spinach as suggested by another cook. And I was generous with the chili-garlic. Also, I had no mirin so I used seasoned sushi vinegar (!) and the chicken was really delicious. Deglazed the pan a bit too.

For all the intriguing ingredients, it came out passable. Still, it is easy and a good use of some of those hard to use up asian ingredients. One time I used soba instead of udon. Different, but fine.

I found it difficult to extract the water from the spinach without breaking the noodles during the second draining.

really delicious- much lighter than cold sesame noodles, but just as tasty. I also doubled the spice quotient and just grated ginger into the dressing, rather than messing with ginger juice. Also, I marinated the chicken in the dressing before cooking which really added a lot of flavor and made for great leftovers.

This was excellent! My wife raved over this one more than anything I have ever made for her. The next time I will do what the cook from boston etc. did and toss the spinach with the cooked noodles because they got too wilty and tended to clump together when cooked even for the shortest time (a few sec.). I also doubled the chili garlic paste and the heat was just right (on the verge of too much is the way we like it).

Excellent! You have a light dinner for 2 (there's not enough food here to serve 4 as a main course) in 15 minutes w/fresh noodles--I added more chile sauce (abt 1 tbsp) and have used beef round, thinly sliced & stirfried, instead of chicken when that was all I had. I prefer not to cook the spinch, but just toss w/the cooked drained noodles & let it wilt slightly. Very good! (Also note that, despite the title, the chicken is thankfully not sweet at all.) Adding some chopped fresh cilantro with the scallions and sesame seeds is the only change or addition I would make.
