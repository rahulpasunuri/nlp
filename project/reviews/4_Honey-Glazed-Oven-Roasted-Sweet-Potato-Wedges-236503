Instead of the standard mashed sweet potatoes and marshmallow casserole, this recipe was very easy, more healthy, and a hit at Thanksgiving! Everyone really enjoyed this dish!

Loved this. I lined the pan with parchment, which made it really easy to clean up. Also, I left some in the oven (after I turned it off) for a while as we ate dinner, and the honey on those caramelized even more, which tasted wonderful. I am looking forward to trying the recipe using different varietals of honey to see how the taste changes.

These are soooo good, healthy, easy. They take a couple of minutes to prepare, next to nothing ingredients, and everyone loved them.

Good, basic dish.

This was very, very good, but be forewarned: if you use the 1o-ounce potatoes they recommend, they are done much quicker than an hour. Mine were done in 30 minutes, so I ended up taking them out, drizzling with the honey, then sticking them back in 5 minutes before dinner was ready.

Maybe I cut the potatoes too small but they were done in 20 min. The honey made them especially good.

Delicious and simple. I look forward to making yams this way all winter. I substituted maple syrup for the honey and enjoyed the subtle flavor. More honey or maple syrup could be used if you like your yams sticky sweet.

I tried this as an accompaniment for grilled pork chops and it was great. Thanks to the other reviews, I considered only drizzling a little bit of honey, and it worked great. Definitely an hour of baking though.

I added chunks of banana the last 10 minutes and drizzled with the honey. It was fabulous!!!!!

Maybe I did it wrong. But this just came out bland and made a sticky mess to clean up. In the future I'll stick to my usual sweet potato recipe which is roasting them with olive oil and herbes de provence.

This is a terrific & easy sweet potato recipe for Thanksgiving. I did all the steps ahead (peel, quarter, rinse, toss with olive oil and salt) and kept it all in Tupperware in the fridge until ready to cook, then I drizzled it with honey before putting in the oven. The honey flavor is not strong, but it does coat the potatoes and add a glazed appearance. This is my new Thanksgiving sweet potato recipe!

My entire family loved this for our Thanksgiving dinner. It was so great. Though if you make this recipe, add a suficient amount of honey for real flavor.

Yummy. Even better squirted all over with lime juice either right after roasting or at the table. And lots of coarse fresh pepper.

This dish was super easy and a very good representation of the sweet potato. I skipped the cold water part and went straight from cutting to the paper towels. (Is there some reason for it?) I had to go out, so I turned off the oven after 45 minutes, drizzled maple syrup on top of the wedges, then stuck them back in until the oven cooled. The result was tasty, but the syrup didn't cook ON to the potatoes or caramelize at all. We still thought it was delicious and will definitely try again soon. P.S. The parsley didn't seem to add or detract from the dish.

Easy to make and delicious. My husband and I finished the whole thing - no left overs. It also cooks fast because the potatoes are skinned. To me, it's more festive compared to the usual baked sweet potato. Serve with creme fraiche on the side and enjoy!
