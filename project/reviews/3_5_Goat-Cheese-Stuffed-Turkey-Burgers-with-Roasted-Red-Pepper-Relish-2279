The burgers were excellent but I found the most amazing red pepper relish at notesfromjudieskitchen.com. Made 8 small jars from 8 bell peppers (and onions etc. check out the recipe) for a small dinner party, ended up eating almost two jars worth during dinner and had to give a jar away to each of 4 couples as they left. Only two jars left for me :( Amazing stuff and goes great with these nice lean burgers.

excellent recipe. accidentally mixed the goat cheese in with the meat and it turned out beautifully versus placing the cheese on top.

These were truly exceptional. When I read the recipe, I thought they might need something, like lettuce? Tomatoes? Nope. They were pretty darn amazing, as is. The goat cheese inside gets all melty, & creamy, & is really tasty. I served them on whole wheat "thin buns," which worked out well, because the burger to bun ratio was such that I could really taste all the flavors this burger offers. On the side, I served sweet potato fries, which worked really well with the slightly spicy relish. (By the way, the lemon in the burgers works REALLY well, too.)

Really delicious, mainly due to the red pepper relish/goat cheese combo. I didn't use jarred peppers, but roasted and peeled my own. It isn't difficult and saves money, when fresh red peppers are in abundance and on sale at the stores. Best turkey burger here that I've tried.

I absolutely love this recipe. I was not a huge fan of turkey burgers but it is at the top of my list right now. I have made this twice in the past week and a half (I really wanted to make it again the next day). The burgers themselves are wonderful - love the lemon. I used just regular breadcrumbs (nothing fancy) and I still think they are wonderful. I think the relish is a MUST - when I ran out of burgers I ate the relish out of the bowl AND I licked my plate. Clean. All the flavors are balanced nicely. I love the sweet/sour punch of the relish. The sour from the vinegar and sweet from the sugar and peppers is amazing. It is not hot because of the cayenne pepper. I would make this for a side for other red meats as well. I halved the recipe for the relish because I didn't think the teenagers or the toddlers would like it - which is FINE because it means more for me. I would definetly use this dish for company.

Absolutely a great quick meal. The relish makes it. Relish is also good with pork tenderloin. I sometimes substitute a mixture of fat free feta & non-fat cream cheese for a lower fat burger. And I agree, forget the buns, they aren't needed. Even our grandchildren loved this recipe.

Since I discovered this recipe months ago, I have made these several times and they are a hit at barbeques as well as with my fiancee at home. I have found that they are delicious without the relish, and are an easy weeknight meal, as I always have some kind of goat cheese in the fridge. I use sprouted wheat bread for the breadcrumbs and add whatever fresh herbs and onions/scallions/garlic I have in the house. Yummy on a bun or served with couscous and broccoli.

This is one of my favorite dishes to make and it always receives raves. It takes a little time for the relish, but oh is it worth it. Cream cheese can be substituted for those who don't like goat cheese (or pregnant women).

Every element here is delicious. I've never eaten them on a bun--the bread would just get in the way of everything else; plus, I make 'em big.

Oh, YUM! We loved these burgers, even my husband who has generally not been a fan of turkey burgers. This one hit the spot! And, amazingly, he even liked the relish (he hates peppers)! If that doesn't sell you on this, nothing will. Try it, it's fantastic! Oh, and I made my relish with pre-marinated roasted red peppers (Trader Joe's). Just cut down on the vinegar, salt and sugar in the recipe...still great!

This is a great weeknight recipe! I've made this twice; once with turkey, once chicken. Both fab, but my boyfriend and I thought the ground chicken breast was much more moist. Feel free to experiment with the herbs..added fresh rosmary and thyme...lovely!

Forget a regular beef burger. These were great and the relish is a must. I only used 1/2 the recommended amount of red pepper and there was lots.

I have been making these ever since they were published in 1996. I had never been a turkey burger fan until these. They are really delicious and very different. Don't forgo the relish - it makes the burgers!

I made this for a Friday night bbq dinner just to have a fun twist to a regular burger. I was actually concerned that they might be a little bland for my taste and chose this because our guests didn't want anything too spicy and said a burger would be just fine. I have to say that the recipe was great! The lemon added such an interesting and rereshing taste to the burgers and I especially loved the relish. I keep all of our family favorites, and this one is getting added to the bunch!

Rating: 3
This was a very tasty turkey burger. The goat cheese made the burger extra-flavorful and moist, which can be a challenge with turkey meat. I do not like roasted red peppers but I made the relish anyway, and it was surprisingly good! I recommend not overstuffing with the goat cheese because it will definately leak out the sides-- learned that one the hard way. :)

This is okay. Must roast your own peppers instead of canned, but it does take a bit longer. I would give this 2.5 forks in a perfect world. The little burst of lemon in the turkey is good; add some fresh thyme and rosemary to the patties. Perfectly fine recipe on the whole, but it does start to get a little expensive for just plain old turkey burgers. Better results from Cabernet burgers and sun-dried tomato burgers (both on this site, but beef not turkey).

these were absolutely delish -- even though i am not the best cook. i made a half recipe of the relish and it was enough for 4 burgers. the flavors blend beautifully -- especially lemon.

LOVED the red pepper relish. The turkey burgers were pretty good too, although I think I would add fresh rosemary to the ground turkey OR add fresh basil to the inside filling. The relish was a big hit, although I did add extra kick to the recipe as written.

I tried another turkey burger recipe and keep coming back to this one. It's very tasty and gets better after freezing as I think the flavors develop even while frozen. I enjoy it without the relish, but everyone really liked that when I originally served this. Next time I am going to serve it open faced with a baby spinach salad with pecans, dried cranberries in a light lemeon vinegarette and a wheatberry salad. Great summertime or picnic food.

Excellent! I used fresh ground turkey beast, roasted my own red bell pepper, reduced the olive oil, and served the burgers open-faced, to cut back on the carbs. A little shredded Romaine lettuce was nice, also. Great summer food.

The hint of lemon along with the goat cheese is great, and the relish is really good too. All of the flavors work well together. I'll definitely make this again.

Terrific stuff. I did the patties on my George Forman Grill and got rave reviews. Be careful not to overcook the turkey...but the moistness of the relish and goat cheese make for a very forgiving recipe if you do!

I had this version of hamburgers at a team party a few years ago and begged the host for the recipe. The red pepper relish is awesome and the quote I heard when I made this myself was "this was the single best use of goat cheese I've ever tasted" Try it for yourself. It's out of this world.

This recipie was a hit for all six of my guests. They all asked for the recipie, and each of them have made it already! The goat cheese in the middle really makes the burger.

After much research, we decided to try this recipe. It could not be BETTER! We substituted multiple colors of peppers, and toasted the buns painted with olive oil. We did not suffer the oozing cheese problem mentioned in an earlier review. You must try this recipe. You'll love it!

have made these numerous times to rave reviews. The lemon zest I think is what really gives the burgers flavor and the relish is awesome. Don't skimp on the goat cheese either. THese burgers will expand when they cook...so don't worry if they look scrawny as you're assembling them. This is a real winner of a recipe!

Quite good! I added some minced onion. I do not eat peppers, so I made the burgers and served them with good mustard. Very easy and a satisfying beef burger substitute.

Tried this for a cook out and unfortunately I can't say they were a hit exactly. The women liked them but the men were a little perplexed about the goat cheese stuffing. I will make them again though. The relish really made the dish, it was very good and very pretty. I served the burgers on buns but will not do so in the future. They look so pretty on a little bed of lettuce with the bright red relish on top that it's a shame to cover them up.

Rating: 3
Wow: a quick, easy, tasty dinner and a welcome break from my staple of plain turkey burgers. As other reviewers recommended, I cut the thyme somewhat and the result had a very nice flavor w/o being overpowering. I used an herbed montrachet cheese and grilled the burgers on an indoor grill. I didn't make the relish this time, but I'm looking forward to trying that as well based on the raves here!

Rating: 4
These were delicious! Next time I will cut down on the thyme just a tad, it was a little overwhelming to the rest of the flavors for me. And you must make the Roasted Red Pepper Relish, it puts these burgers over the top (as my husband said, "Can't have enough of this stuff)! Next time I'll make extra and freeze the patties (without cheese in middle version) so I'll have a quick weeknight dinner.

I substituted monterey jack cheese on top instead of goat cheese inside. They were great. I cooked them on the stove. The relish was the best part. It could be used for lots of things, even as a bruschetta of sorts. Next time I would add more spice to the turkey. Also, I prefer my burgers a little thinner, so I will also keep that in mind. Great alternative to beef at a cookout. Very easy and healthy.

the burgers end up being a little small with the amount of meat in the recipe, so i always use a little bit more. this is one of my staple recipes. i make it all the time, and people love it. the relish is a must!

Burger was good but the relish was AMAZING!

Fantastic!! I've made this recipe 3 times in the past 2 months. The first time I followed the recipe. I thought the burgers were too large with the goat cheese in the middle. The next time I made them, I placed the goat cheese on top and they were perfect. Relish is definitely a keeper too! I have used the relish with cream cheese on bagels with ham. Instead of buying $10 worth of jarred roasted red peppers, I have made it with fresh peppers and roasted them. Very easy and DELICIOUS!!!

WONDERFUL!!!! I carried this recipe around for 4 years, and missplaced it in a move 4 1/2 years ago...I have been searching for it ever since, and so glad I was able to find it. I'm hooked on the relish...make extra, you'll want to glob on more! The relish and the goat cheese are a great combination. This will surely become a family favorite.

This recipe is great, as noted by all the other comments. I didn't think there was too much lemon at all, I would maybe even use a bit more. The relish is critical--gotta have it--but the recipe does make a lot--if you want to use your own peppers, like I did, you will need 7 or 8 to make the 28oz called for. Also we don't have a grill, so we just cooked them in a pan, and it still took about 5 minutes per side. We made it with 2 lbs turkey, added more of everything else to compensate, made 8 burgers and froze 4. They were only in the freezer a few days, now they are out thawing because we want to eat them! Great recipe.

The burgers are good, juicy. The goat cheese flavor is dissipated by the relish and I'm pretty sure I'll skip the cheese next time. Washing roasted peppers is a good way to rid them of their flavor, so I simply put them in a salad spinner. Messy but effective.

Used just 1 tsp lemon peel, otherwise followed recipe exactly. Big hit with family. They especially liked tang of the relish and goat cheese balanced by blander turkey. They want me to make it again.

This was quite a yummy dish! I've made it twice- the first time it was a little too "lemonie" so I reduced the lemon by half the second time and it was great. The relish is absolutely wonderful. I didn't have any apple-cider vinegar, so I substituted raspberry vinegar, and it tasted fantastic. I haven't had any trouble with the burgers being dry- perhaps it depends on the quality of ground turkey being used.

I made this recipe when it first appeared in Bon Appetit about five or six years ago. I thought it was very despite my dislike for goat cheese. The second time I made it I eliminated the goat cheese and didn't substitute but would thought feta might be good. I also didn't make the relish the second time. Big mistake! It really brings out the flavors in what really is just an ordinary turkey burger.

The burgers were tasty but the relish is great! I made an easy appetizer by spreading goat cheese over French bread slices and topping it with room-temperature pepper relish. Using red and yellow peppers made it a treat for the eyes too.

Delicious! I skipped the relish however and topped the burger with avocaco. The burger was huge and I could only eat half...ate the other half for lunch the next day, cold, and it was still great! The turkey meat came out tasting like sausage. Yum!

Rating: 2
Way too much lemon for the amount of turkey ... that said, the correct combination of ingredient quantities led to perfection (other than taste) in terms of the turkey burgers consistency and bbq-doneness. We don't think lemon is the wrong flavor, it's just the amount of peel + fresh juice is way too overpowering for a light meat. So, the roadrunners will be enjoying the remaining turkey burgers rather feasting on rodents, etc. The relish was outstanding, as other cooks noted, and we will be making it again as a wonderful side dish to bbq'd pork and chicken!

I crave these! My personal preference is Foster Farms ground turkey (perhaps other brands produce drier burgers?). As far as the cheese dripping out, make sure you pinch the patties together well. The relish is an absolute must and is truly delicious.

The relish is good. The burger were not. I found the turkey pattie dry in my mouth and if you are not careful the melted goat cheese will remove the skin from your chin. I tried slightly reducing the cooking time but had the same results. Perhaps the woman that added the ground beef is on to something.

I loved the taste of the meat with the red peppers. However, part of the goat cheese melted too fast and dripped out, Does somebody knows how to prevent this, especially in hot weather?

I love this recipe and make it often -- the burgers couldn't be easier, and the pairing with the red pepper relish is, as other posters have mentioned, what makes this really special. My only "complaint" would be that the recipe calls for much more relish than you need for the burgers, but the relish is so delicious, you'll have no problem finding uses for the leftovers.

I make this dish all the time, we all love it, the goat cheese keeps the burgers moist and the relish is the best thing about it, it really makes it! I found that it works better to crumble the cheese rather than using one round pattie of it.

This is one of the best recipes I have made from Bon Appetit. Sometimes we mix turkey meat with lean ground beef to help the burger remain intact once stuffed. The red pepper relish makes this recipe a 4!

The red pepper relish is so good, I've made it without the burgers several times. It stores well in the refrigerator and gets better after a day or two.
