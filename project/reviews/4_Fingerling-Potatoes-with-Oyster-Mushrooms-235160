This was good, but not great. Despite the nice ingredients it seemed "average" for a potato and mushroom dish. It was very easy though, and I would make it again for guests as it looks nice.

Added the second set of shallots to the mushrooms. Also added some veggies that I had in the refrig. Excellent dinner all in one dish! Nothing like roasted veggies!!

Served as a sidedish to this: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Br aised-Chicken-with-Apples-and-Sage-233248 and was EXCELLENT. Also cooked longer than called for by approx 15-20, also I switched the mushrooms to the bottom 3rd for the last 10 mins.

Easy and really jazz up roast potatoes. I used baby portobello sliced really thin. And I was lazy so after baking the potatoes till nearly done, I lay a layer of mushrooms on top and baked till mushrooms were done. Save washing up!

Excellent recipe. It reminds me of my childhood. Roasted potatoes with wild mushrooms and onions was a big occasion in my house. It goes excellent with roasted chicken and a simple tomato salad.

This was good except I didn't have fresh oysters- so rehydrated dried. This would have worked out FINE if I had put them in for only five minutes at the end- as it was, I followed recipe and they dried up to tasteless crisps. So, if you use dried, cut baking time hugely! Otherwise tasty simple recipe.

No fingerlings at Whole Foods, so used the variety of small yellow potatoes they had and just adjusted the timing a bit. Like the other reviewer I just used one baking sheet (also used the same one for the companion asparagus recipe and for Muscovy Duck Breast with Pomegrantat-Wine Sauce from this site.) It was a great dinner and an easy clean up after. Used a combo of oyster, chanterelle and shitakes. Christmas 2008

Following up: With oyster mushrooms, this was magnificent. An unexpectedly hot evening, so I didn't reheat them, served them at room temperature, as I did all the dishes.

Simple, delicious. Needed to cook a bit longer--let the mushrooms start to get golden and crispy at the edges.

I thought this was a nice side dish--I had some fingerling potatoes from the greenmarket to use, so it was perfect to come across. I think I might need to come down from all the lovely herbs that have been so plentiful this summer as the dish, imo, really called out for a little "pop"--I would maybe up the garlic and add some fresh chopped herbs for the next go round. Also, i deglazed slightly with just a touch of white wine not so much as to completely kill the crunch, which was a very nice addition.

This is a lovely dish. I'm a little lazy so I only use one baking sheet and add the mushrooms when the potatoes are cooked halfway through.

Great recipe and very delicious. I recommend some extra time on the roasting and where are the instructions for the second two tablespoons of shallots?

An excellent side dish, which was easy to make. Will definitely make it again, but will add more garlic and maybe a pinch of Cayenne.

a very yummy side! I made with fresh shiitake mushrooms instead of oyster and served with filet mignons with merlot sauce, also from epicurious....a great combo!

Yes, a delicious & quite simple recipe. (However, I cannot see how the reviewer compared their "l/2 lb. for 2" , no shallots, no mushrooms-parsley!" Why bother? No comparison!

I made a simplified version of this tonight for the two of us. Half pound plus of fingerlings (mixed red and white) from the farmers market, two whole unpeeled garlic cloves, olive oil. Wonderful! Can hardly wait to make the whole recipe, including oyster mushrooms (also from the farmers market) for company dinner next week.
