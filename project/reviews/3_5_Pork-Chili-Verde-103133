Agree with the cook from Cabo, this is a boring chile verde. On the other hand, CfCSL made a chicken chile verde and used it to review this recipe. Huh?

My rating is low because I know good pork chili verde. This is a limited base for a meal that can be really great with just a few easy additions. It is also delicious if substituting chicken for the pork. In my attempt to rework this basic uninteresting recipe using 6 cut up chicken thighs I made a few low calorie additions. As I was browning the thighs I threw in one chopped onion,4 garlic cloves and 4 chopped roasted hatch chilies from New Mexico. I seasoned the mix with a tsp of toasted whole cumin, a tsp. of granulated beef bouillon and fresh ground black pepper. I added 1 cup of canned chicken broth, a 15 0z. can of diced tomatoes and a 15 oz can of unseasoned black beans. This is an excellent healthy meal that may no longer resemble traditional pork chili verde but then the recipe from Bon Appetit is a boring example of a wonderful, Mexican dish.

The previous reviewer has given me pause, and so I leave this review! Delicious and very easy - if following the recipe, using the correct cut of meat etc., this is recipe is a great choice for a weekend (or planned ahead weekday) meal. Really great the next day.

This is part of another recipe for enchiladas. This is delicious and the green (verde) sauce for the enciladas was excellent. I made the entire enchilada recipe but didn't assemble and bake them. Served the components with rice and beans also. I did it that way because our local Mexican restaurant serves it that way and I really like it. Was WONDERFUL!!!!!!

I would like to suggest my version of Chili Verde which is not too difficult and taste GREAT!!!! 3 Lbs Pork Butt cut into 2 inch cubes, 6 Large Hatch green Chiles, roasted, peeled and chopped. 2 to 4 Jalapeno peppers, 2 cloves garlic, 1 Lrg Onion diced, 1 large can Tomatillos, 1-2 Tbs cumin, a little cilantro adds unique flavor. 1 can chicken broth. Salt/Pepper to taste. Brown pork on all sides, combine with vegetables and either put in crock pot for 7-8 hrs or on stove top low simmer until pork is tender 1 1/2 - 2 hrs. I have been making this for years and there is never any left! Serve with sour cream, diced onions, chopped cilantro and lime wedges. Makes Great burritos!!! There is no need to add any water to the mixture as the meat, broth and chiles provide a delicious sauce of their own cooked on low, I think you will LOVE IT!!!!!Delete Jalapeno peppers for mild flavored chili.

This is a great recipe if you like to experiment. Mexican food is very forgiving in that respect. I have found that brining the shoulder 12 hours-a day in advance adds a lot of flavor. Baking the dish in a claypot (an old family recipe) negates the need for water and keeps all the natural flavors in the dish as well.

Its hard to get fresh chiles here, but the recipe worked great using canned green chiles. I also used canned chicken broth insteadof water.

Forgot to say the tomatillo salsa recipe is from Gourmet - Feb. 2002

This recipe is supposed to be made as part of the PORK CHILI VERDE ENCHILADAS, which does have tomatillos, etc. It is really, really delicious. No tomatillos available here - canned was surprisingly nice in this dish. Please try these two recipes together - you won't be disappointed. Also, I had exactly one lb. tomatillos left - which was exactly what the recipe for tomatillo salsa recipe on this site calls for. Terrific on cheese quesadillas and whatever else.

I used the crock pot and some home canned green salsa. I then added the fresh, pureed poblanos at the end and used this chili to stuff tamales. I used the "Tamalitos" recipe for the masa. First time ever making tamales and it was a big hit at my open house holiday party.

I also grill the pork (steaks) for extra flavor, and substitute equal parts beer and chicken broth for the water. I now get asked to serve this Christmas Eve!

Thanks Wendy. My super-easy pork verde is similar. 2-3 lb pork sirloin roast (or equivalent), 1 jar LaVictoria salsa verde, 1 can chicken broth, 1 sliced onion, 2-3 chopped garlic, cumin & black pepper to if you like (NO salt-the salsa & broth have plenty!) Put everything in the crock-pot on high for about 7 hours. Meat shreds beautifully and the sauce is thick and delicious! Serve with tortillas, guacamole, fresh cilantro, etc. Great way to feed a group!

Thanks again to Wendy for posting that recipe. I would only ask - do you think you could post some proportions, even the size of cans and whether or not this comes out thick or soupy? I'm just a little irish girl, and I have barely ever made spicy food - I'm not sure I'm getting it right. :) thanks.

I did not try this recipe, but do make a great quick and easy Chile Verde. Time allowing I cut up and brown pork, about 3-5 lbs, depending, add a can of chicken broth, some onion, garlic, a little cumin, and large can of Green Chile Enchilada Sauce. Cook till meat is tender, and add up to a large jar of green chile salsa (contaiins tomotillos) and sauce. This salsa has a lot of spices, and heats it up. Lemon will put fire for non fire-eaters. Depending on quatity I may also add a whole large can of roasted green chiles. We use flour tortillas, and cheese, main dish or leftovers make great burritos, or even omlettes. This multi-what you've got recipe-has not failed me yet, using any of the combinations. I have tried from scrap, but usually like the flexibilty of this version better.

Based on some of the reviews, I also made some modifications, and thought the result was quite tasty. Cooked the onions separate to carmelize, then added to pork about the same time I added the other spices. Added 4 or 5 tomatillos and 2 jalapena peppers and cooked for a bit before adding the liquid. Substituted chicken broth for water. Also added 1 small can of Herdez salsa verde (hot). Cooked an extra hour, added cilantro and served with lime.

I grill the pork and onion and then cut it up (add the saved juices). This adds a lot of carmelized flavor to the recipe. I also use Hatch chiles to heat it up. Also substitute chicken broth and an amber beer for the water. Great recipe, just needed tweaking.

For those that would like it spicy but still loves the chile flavor, I order frozen chilies from www.nmcchile.com. I used the Sandia's. Great flavor and just enough spice. I also used chicken stock instead of water and doubled the garlic. Big hit with my family!

This was a great starting point for this recipe. I prefer to add more seasoning and found it bland at first. Next time, I'd add salt, pepper, tomatillos, some cilantro and use chicken broth instead of the water.

I was shocked to read the other reviews. This recipe is very tasty. We have made it many, many times. We put a dolup of sour cream on top and serve with tortillas. A recipe doesn't have to have a lot of ingredients to be good. Also has anyone ever heard of variety and difference. There are thousands of chocolate cake recipes and most of them are good just a slight different taste. Branch out of your box and live a little.

To the cook whose hispanic friend would be appalled...where's their recipe.

I guess for someone that hasn't had the real "chile verde" would think is great, but a chile verde must have tomatillos, cilantro and serrano (or jalapeno) peppers.

I prefer my pork shredded so I think next time I would choose a leaner cut of pork and cook it whole for a longer time and then shred it. I think that would make it more flavorful and less fatty.

The tomatillos are found in the rest of this recipe: Pork Chili Verde Enchilada

Okay, I agree that the recipe as written lacks a few ingredients, but throwing in some tomatillo salsa and chicken broth rather than water helps alot. Of course, some chopped up fresh cilantro, celery,oregano, and a little lemon or lime juice helps, too. I loved the amount of green chilis to pork in this recipe though, the amount of liquid, and the cooking instructions. I used 2 teaspoons of ground cumin, rather than roasting and grinding seeds and I used canned chilis.

Where are the tomatillos??? It is not chili verde without them!!

It was so easy, and tasted very traditionally authentic. I served it with spanish rice and a steamed tortilla on the side. Roasting the fresh chilies, and toasting the cumin seeds makes a big difference in the taste of the dish. Also, I substituted chicken stock for the water. Enjoy!

This was worthwhile. I'm a big chili verde fan and although this recipe is somewhat less than authentic it is very tasty and pretty close. I altered it to make preparation easy and hands-off for a week night meal (I have two toddlers helping me get dinner ready each day... ha ha) So I cheated by using ground cumin from my spice rack and canned chilis chopped. Simmered it on very low heat for several hours stirring it now and then. Served it in flour tortillas with sour cream, cheddar, black beans and spanish rice to build burritos. Husband loved it and so did the kids.

Simple y delicioso. Plenty of sauce and green. I added 10 whole canned chiles, to simplify preparation, without sacrificing any flavor (buy a big can and freeze the remaining chiles for next time you make this recipe). I will use a leaner cut of pork next time (tenderloin) to cut the fat. Served on warm flour tortillas with some sour cream, muy bien.

We love chili verde and this recipe was easy and delicious.

My hispanic friend who taught me to make chile verde would be appalled. No heat and very little green. How about some jalapenos and tomatillos? And if your sauce is good you want a little more than just enough to coat the meat. And you should mention that chili verde is best served with warm flour tortillas in case some cooks don't know that.
