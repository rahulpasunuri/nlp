I made this without a food processor and they turned out quite well, twice. I doubled the cumin both times. Also, I only fry up what I want to have as a single meal; the batter holds up well in the fridge for a few days. Good with hot sauce and tzatziki wrapped in lavash. Will be making regularly.

The BEST recipe for falafel (with only two changes): we love herbs, so I doubled the parsley/cilantro and used the waffle iron (make sure it is thoroughly preheated and grease the plates veryvery well).

Loved this so much! I actually attempted it in my food processor-free college kitchen and did my best to chop the chickpeas as finely as possible. I put a teeny-tiny mince on the onions as well and ended up substituting basil for parsley. While I intended to follow the proportions, I didn't really; I ended up using about two cups of chickpeas from dried but found I actually had to add water along with the 4 tbsp of flour to make it sticky enough. All in all, they turned out gorgeously. I think the chunkiness I ended up with was a great change from the usual! The texture went really well with the smoothness of Greek yogurt. It was equally delicious with pita and bell peppers.

The best falafel ever!!!!!!! It is fine and maybe even better to use fresh or canned chickpeas.

This was a hit. I used canned chick peas, no cilantro or red pepper and I probably pulsed it more than the recipe calls for. I heated the oil (not 3 inches, more like 1/2 inch) in a caste iron skillet and scooped the mixture into the hot oil in fairly small amounts (1 inch rounds). My kids even like them, and they are picky about anything new.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I think the trick to keeping them together is like other people have said, to give the oil time to get really really really hot. But remember to turn on the exhaust fan. I forgot, and my fire alarm went off. I used about twice as much flour as the recipe called for, and found that rolling the balls in flour before frying them also made them stay together better. Now for the secret... I used a teaspoon of fresh ginger instead of cilantro and it turned out amazingly! Adds kind of an unexpected twist that I would definitely recommend.

I like falafel, but other recipes I've tried have invariably fallen apart. These stay together--I think the trick is 1) using the dried chickpeas soaked overnight since they never get as mushy as the canned ones and 2) waiting until the oil is really, really hot. My falafel crisped up like a charm and stayed in perfect little balls! I liked the addition of the red pepper flakes, though I think the recipe could have used a touch more salt. I served them with tomatoes, lettuce, and tzatziki sauce in a pita-yum!

I love falafel but never tried to make them. From scratch. So I tried the recipe as is and cooked it and it disintegrated in the oil. Like it did for others. So I put the oil in a POT not a skillet and used my themometer and fried them HOT between 350 and 375. They are perfect..PERFECT. So if yours disintegrate, it is the cooking temp, not the recipe. I did add a little more flour and even an egg....which I will omit next time. I have dry beans soaking and will try it again tomorrow. I could live on falafel. I do have a question for everyone: cook the chickpeas or not? And mush them with a fork or use a cuisenart? OK, two questions. Anyone have experience to share? Thanks

I've never made falafel because I'm not crazy about frying, but I'm really glad I tried these! I doubled this recipe and used dried chick peas. I was only able to let the dough sit in the refrigerator for 1 1/2 hours instead of the several hours the recipe advises but they turned out perfectly, and the dough was easy to work with. I used two soup spoons to form the balls which was probably easier than using my hands. The falafel had a very nice crispy outside and almost creamy inside. I made sandwiches with them on pita topped with sliced sweet onion, tomatoes, lettuce and some tahini sauce. Since these are somewhat time consuming to make, I'm glad I doubled the recipe so I have a batch in the freezer.

Wonderful recipe. I deviated from the recipe in only a few minor ways. I used 3/4 the specified amount of flour, added 1/2 tsp of freshly ground white pepper, went half and half with scallions and onion, instead of all onion, and added some lemon juice. I had zero trouble with the balls falling apart in the oil. I think this may be due to grinding the ingredients using the nut butter-making attachment for my macerating juicer. The resulting paste was finer than that anticipated by the recipe, but it held together extremely well. The falafel balls thus prepared were a crispy deep golden brown on the outside, and moist and tender on the inside. They were great wrapped in lavash and topped with finely diced salad, tahini-lemon sauce, and a little sriracha for added kick. It was a delight to prepare an authentically Israeli dish, and I look forward to preparing other specialties from the Jewish homeland, soon!

Good recipe! Smelled like WAY too much onion at first, but once cooked they were great. I added a bit more cumin and a sprinkle of sesame seeds on top before baking (450F, 10 min on first side and 8 min on second). Served with Labanese Tabouleh from this site and a tahini sauce.

These are the best falafel! I used dried chick peas. I added 3 tablespoons of flour and corm meal - other than the corn meal the recipe was followed completely. I would not change anything. The falafel held together with a great crunch. Served pickled onion, cucumber, lettuce and tomato with homemade pitas and tahini sauce.

This is simple and DELICIOUS! Even though I used dried chickpeas my "dough" was a little wet, but surprisingly only a couple crumbled in the oil. They came out crispy on the outside and creamy (but cooked!) on the inside. Make sure your oil is at 375 and that you dry all ingredients before you process.

These were awesome! I made them for a crowd and they were gone in minutes. I used 2 cups canned chickpeas (very well dried)and half flour, half cornmeal and added a little feta. Last batch started to fall apart a little, I think it wasn't chilled enough to hold together. Served in pitas with chopped veggies and tzatziki sauce. Fantastic!

Just back from the Middle East and was hankering for some of the great falafel that we got addicted to over there. This fit the bill. There's only two of us, so I made one batch, kept the rest in tupperware in the fridge for two days and made the second batch. It was just as good. In other words, the mix will keep for a couple of days. My next search is for a recipe for Syrian bread that's as luscious and thick as you get overseas.

I find the tagging of this recipe distasteful, there is nothing particularly "jewish" or "israeli" about falafels, it belongs to the region where the Palestinians, Lebanese etc have been making them for who knows how long. It seems that when Israel stole its territories, it stole a cuisine aswell.

If you do use canned chick peas, you should pay attention to how much salt is already in them and might not need the additional 1 teaspoon of salt. Or make sure you rinse them in addition to draining. Other than being a little saltier than I'd like this was delicious! I will try baking next time because they seemed really greasy.

I've made this a few times but this was the first time I started with dried chickpeas. It was great! I was a little worried about not cooking them first but it totally worked. I served the falafel in pitas with hummus and tzatziki, israeli salad and pickles. Delicious and even the picky toddler condescended to try it.

Best falafel ever! I can't believe what a difference it makes using dried chickpeas. Crispy creaminess in every bite. I used fresh serranos instead of dried chiles, chickpea flour instead of wheat, and added tons of mint, basil, and way more cilantro than called for. Served with pickled cabbage, sriracha, tomatoes, and yogurt mixed with lemon zest and juice. We just finished the last batch and I'm making again tonight. Addicted.

I've made this twice, once with canned chickpeas, and once with dried. I agree with other reviewers that dried is best, otherwise they come out too gummy. Both times I made them I had to add way more flour than the recipe calls for, and even then they seemed pretty sticky. But I don't think it matters that much. You also have to watch the size of the balls, if they're too big they won't cook all the way through. I used a rounded 3/4oz scoop and that seemed to be about perfect.

These are excellent. Made with a neighbour who is from Israel. A few additions. Used 2 tbsp. of presoaked then drained bulgur, a pinch of yeast, zest of one lemon, and 2 teaspoons of cumin and 1/4 of a bunch of parsley added all into food processor with everything else. Still added a bit of flour at the end to get the right consistency. For toppings we did fresh onion sliced with Sumach and salt and a bit of lemon, Red cabbage shredded fine with a bit of sumach, lemon, olive oil and salt, chopped dill pickles, hot pepper rings, Tahina saucs, tzatziki, shredded romaine and fresh tomatoes and cucumbers tossed with a bit of salt and pepper. So Good!

This was my first attempt at falafel and now I will have to keep making it! I followed the recipe exactly, and used garbanzo bean flour. Really tasty.

Terrific recipe -- the first time I've made falafel without having it fall apart in the pan. I used canned chickpeas; also cornmeal as suggested by another reviewer and I liked the extra texture.

I made this for the fifth time tonight, and yet again my guests raved over it. It's so tasty that even committed carnivores don't notice the lack of meat. Even if you don't follow recipes very carefully, this one is worth following exactly, as the balance of flavors is great. In particular, make sure that your oil is hot enough or else they come out a little tough. The only time this recipe has gone wrong for me was when I tried to mix it in a blender. Just don't.

This is probably the best falafel recipe you'll find. I used dried chickpeas because I didn't want to chance it with canned (as suggested by previous reviewers). I made some minor changes: sauteed the onions and garlic and added a little more cumin than called for and also fried in peanut oil. I agree with a previous reviewer, if you double this recipe, do it in two batches in your food processor, otherwise all the ingredients will not blend evenly. Great results overall. Trader Joe's has tahini sauce and tzatziki in the refrigerated section, goes great on falafels.

This was my first time making falafel from scratch, and the results could not have been better. I can't recommend this recipe enough! I did find I needed to use more flour than it called for, but perhaps my chickpeas just held more liquid. Either way, this recipe proves you can create authentic falafel at home!

I followed the recipe as written and the flavor was really good. I added a touch of lemon right before I fried them and the acidity was a nice compliment to the herby flavor. I did, however, feel that the texture a bit too grainy for me. I like falafel that's moist and almost creamy on the inside. I think I may try using canned chickpeas next time to see if I can get the texture I'm looking for.

Delicious! I didn't change anything to the recipe and the consistency was perfect. I live in India and was craving falafels so badly.

I am so glad I found this recipe. Ive been trying to incorporate more non-meat proteins in my weekly meals and this tastes sooo good. I did not, however, fry them in 3 inches of oil. I sauteed them all in about 2 tbs of oil in a nonstick pan. They came out great. Also, instead of using tahini sauce, I mixed Greek yogurt with minced garlic, cayenne, cumin, and coriander to make a lower fat sauce. Next time I will try what one cook mentioned below and use have fava beans-half chickpeas.

GREAT recipe. Really good. Don't use canned -- you won't get the same texture/taste. A suggestion: don't add the parsley and cilantro till the very end, otherwise your falafel dough turns green. Since pita is hard to find around here, I flatten my dough thinner than a fast-food burger, and pan fry them for "sandwiches." Mmmm, all that yummy crust!

Made 20 batches of this for a wedding reception. It is SO tasty and easy! Besides soaking the garbanzos overnight, it only took 2 hours from start to finish to make the mix and then another hour or so to fry them all using a deep fryer. Used garbanzo bean flour to make it gluten free. We plan to freeze them until the wedding, I hope it works!

This was delicious and turned out to be much easier than I anticipated. I used fava beans instead of chickpeas though I still used both parsley and cilantro; in the future, I will definitely start with canned chick peas though, fava beans are really a pain. Wait a while for the mixture to cool before adding extra flour if it looks too liquid-like ...I ended up adding too much.

Made this tonight, will NEVER go out for falafels again. This was so easy, and so authentic. They were delicious. My 4 year old helped me make them, they are very simple. The most time- consuming part was prepping the onions and measuring the spices. Shaped them as they were going in the oil. Read through the reviews prior to making and as implicitly suggested, as well as directed in the recipe, used dried chickpeas soaked overnight. Also, used self-rising cornmeal in place of flour, to add to the texture. Added 4 T, tested to see if it would hold together and added 2 more for 6 total before letting it rest. That was all I needed, they didn't fall apart at all. Also, because it was self-rising it contained baking powder and salt already, next time I will cut back on the 1 tsp of salt. Didn't have any fresh parsley so I used dried, didn't have any cilantro, or ground coriander to sub for it as others have suggested, so I just doubled the dried parsley and it tasted just fine. Next time will at least double, maybe even triple the recipe and freeze at least 1/2 for later. They go waaaaay too fast, they are so good. Fantastic recipe.

I made these today and thought they were rather spectacular. I forgot the baking soda and they still came out well. I did add 1/2 C bulgur that I had soaked in lemon juice and water for 45 minutes, because I read somewhere that is done by some. I used cayenne for the hot red pepper. It does take about an hour in the kitchen for prep time, but they were so worth it. I'll make these again and again!

We've been keeping to a regime of meat free mondays for several weeks now, so I decided to try this recipe. Results were great. I used 1 can of chickpeas, and only 4 tbsps of flour, and they turned out fabulously. I was wary of the result so I also made up a batch of store bought falafel mix as a back up. The quantaty of the recipe was not enough to feed a family of 3 teenagers and 2 adults, so I will definately multiply by 2 next time, but everyone raved about the homemade falafel, and made me promise never to buy the boxed version again!! I'd call that a sucess.

I had to use canned chickpeas (rural Colorado isn't known for variety of raw ingredients), but drained and rinsed them, then put them on a paper towel covered baking sheet in a 200 degree oven for a couple of minutes until the paper towel was dry.

Fantastic. I used dried chickpeas and imagine the texture would be quite pasty with canned. You don't even have to cook the dried chickpeas and they are cheap - no excuses! I followed the recipe exactly (with exception to dried parsley instead of fresh) and ended up using 5 T of flour. I refrigerated the mixture overnight and made them the next day. I fried them up in a pan coated with a generous amount of olive oil. This is definitely my new favorite falafel recipe.

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years now. Always great. And I always freeze them. I slightly flatten the uncooked balls, put them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment and freeze solid. Pop them in a plastic bag and fry up when the mood strikes. They come out perfect. The only addition I make is a pinch or two of ground coriander. (I picked that up in Israel years ago.)

I like this recipe but must admit I made a few changes based on reviewers comments before making it the first time as written. I soaked 1 dry cup of beans overnight and then cooked until tender, drained and cooled. This makes about 3 cups. I pulsed the 3 cups in the FP to get a rough chop, then removed one cup to add back later. I pulsed the balance to a finer size, but not a paste, and placed in a bowl along with the rough chopped beans. I sauteed 1 finely chopped med. onion and 4 finely minced garlic cloves.(add the garlic 3-4' after the onions are going, until translucent, and let cool. I added the spices, herbs,3/4 tsp sea salt,4 tbsp corn flour and 3 tbsp whole wheat flour, and mixed gently. I then added the onion/garlic and found the mixture wasn't sticky enough so I added 2 egg whites. That did the trick. Make 1/2" patties and bake on a lightly olive oiled tray 15' per side at 400, or until nicely browned. Dip is 8oz. Fage 0% greek yoghurt, 1.5 tbsp red wine vinegar, about the same in fresh lemon juice, 1/2 tsp sea salt, 1/4 tsp red pepper, whisk, and dip!!! Great corn, cumin and garbanzo flavored falafels. I'll make these again soon. BTW, I hand chopped the everything but the beans, and mixed by hand.

Very flavorful, but as many others have said, using dried-then-soaked chickpeas is a must. Canned chickpeas made a very thick wet batter that when cooked tended to stay gummy inside, like a muffin that wasn't cooked long enough. Since there's a fair bit of onion in the recipe, it being raw severely alters how it tastes. I tried a second time with dried chickpeas and soaked them as directed and they were much better. I tried baking both batches, since I don't like having to deal with the oil once I'm done cooking. I baked them at 350 degrees for 15 minutes, flipped them, then cooked for another 15 min. The canned chickpea batch got tough on the outside and was still mushy and tasted of raw onion on the inside. The soaked chickpea batch was a little dry after baking, but was still much better than the canned. In the end I wound up frying them anyway. That way the inside of the soaked chickpea batch wasn't dry. I found the taste to be like a cross between seasoned french fries and chicken nuggets. My friends and I enjoyed them.

I love falafel- have never made it. I'm a total novice so I made it as directed and this recipe was great! Since I'm a novice, not sure how to handle freezing a batch for future enjoyment: For freezing- would you recommend freezing the dough balls and baking/frying later after it's defrosted OR would you just freeze a cooked batch and defrost later maybe with some baking to recrisp?

I was not in the mood to fry anything, and I also didn't have several hours to refrigerate this recipe. Basically I did it completely wrong and it was still SO good, it's ridiculous. I shaped small patties while a pan was heating in a 400 degree oven, with a thin film of olive oil. Once the pan was hot, i baked the falafel for 12 minutes on each side, and they were crisp and delicious. And healthy. Win.

This recipe was great! If you don't love onion, just cut it down a bit. The key to this is CONSISTENCY! Whether you are just learning to cook or have been cooking for a long time, you always have to remember to 'get a feel' for what you are making. The more comfortable you get with cooking, the more you can use recipes as an outline rather than a doctrine. I used canned chick peas and processed them 1st until they were 'chunky', then put them in a bowl. Next I put the onion 2 cloves of garlic & cilantro in the processor. I would recommend pulsing the garlic 1st, then adding the onion and cilantro/parsley as we generally want garlic to be chopped finer than onions. Then add the other things and pulse until it reaches a consistency that you like. Add that to the bowl, then I used the hot chili paste (from Asian markets and typically in all grocery stores these days). I like spicy food, so I went a little heavy on it. Add the cumin (to taste), salt, baking powder and a little bit of flour (I used some lentil flour that I had on hand). This is the crucial part of the recipe, you have to pick up some of the 'dough' and see if it will form into a ball and hold form. If it's to wet, it will be squishy--add a little more flour. If it's too dry, it will crumble--add just a little water or lemon juice. I didn't find it necessary to refrigerate, also I didn't want to wait! This falafel is some of the best I have had! I would recommend also serving it with a bit of plain yogurt (or even sour cream) instead of the tahini.

Thanks for taking this "traditional middle eastern" dish and evolving it to the tasty treat it was for us today. Food is constantly evolving - if not most of the dishes we enjoy today wouldn't exist. Cajun and Creole food made famous in New Orleans and South Louisiana so long ago was a blending of traditional French, African American and Native American cooking traditions. If not for this "melting" these regional cuisines would never have existed. Even today they continue to evolve as restaurants create fusion dishes with Asian and other cooking traditions. Vive la différence!

Delicious recipe and I wouldn't change a thing. I used first as an appetizer, then turned the leftovers into a pita sandwich. Make sure the oil is good and hot because you want these crunchy.

Tip: hold out the minced parsley and cilantro until the very end. Then drop them in the processor and whirl to just mix. Otherwise the falafels come out slightly green. Great if you're reading Dr. Seuss, but otherwise... I happen to think the best thing about falafels is the crust. So I often just turn it into a sandwich. Take a lump about golfball size, and flatten it into a thin, round, hamburger-like patty. Pan fry in a bit of oil till golden, and serve between bread slices with tahini sauce, lettuce and tomatoes. Almost all crunchy crust. Yum.

Yummo as Rachel says. I had made a batch of these from a bag of chickpeas and froze what we didn't use at the time. I defrosted them a few months later and we just ate them. Even better than the original batch. I was visiting DC this summer and ate at a wonderful Lebanese restaurant. The falafel on the mezza were incredibly dry and inedible. I can't understand what they did to create such a mess. This recipe is so delicious, it's a can't fail... One note though. Oil needs to be hot but not too hot. You want to make sure the middle cooks without turning the outside into a rock....

This is a great recipe. There are a few things that you can do to make sure that it has the right texture. The key to falafel is to make sure that the texture of the chickpeas is coarse and not a soupy puree. First, make sure that ALL of your ingredients are as dry as you can get them, before you add them. In other words, the parsley, chickpeas, cilantro, etc. should be dried very well with paper towels before added to the food processor. The less moisture in the food processor the better. Second, if you are using canned chickpeas, use the whole can except 1/4 cup (again, dry them with a paper towel before using them). Third, puree the onions, herbs/spices BEFORE you puree the chickpeas. This way you can get everything else nice and pureed without over doing the chickpeas. After you have pureed the herbs/spices/onions, THEN add the chickpeas (all except 1/4 cup), the flour and the baking soda and pulse very carefully, just enough to blend the ingredients well, but be careful NOT to puree into a soupy mess. . The last step is to take the 1/4 cup of chickpeas that you didn't add earlier and coarsely chop them and mix them by hand into them into the rest of the mixture. This will ensure that you have some nice, bigger pieces of chickpeas in the mixture. This will also help to keep them together when you fry them.

Quadrupled the recipe and used dried chickpeas the first time . . . the consistency seemed like it would fall apart so I added a few eggs as suggested by a previous post. Fried them in pomace oil and these came out FANTASTIC!!! I never knew it could be so easy . . . I make alot and store them in the freezer . . . never get sick of them and they last a long time . . . Thanks, Joan! . . . I'm about to make them again and wonder if anyone has thought of adding a little feta or some pinenuts . . . I know its not traditional, but I'm all about experimentation . . . will let you know how mine turn out.

Used 2 15 oz cans of canned chickpeas since 1 cup dried, as I understand it, is equivalent to about 3 cups post soak. Things went wonderfully until the falafels hit the hot oil. Full review here: http://badgerbungalow.blogspot.com/20 09/06/falafel.html

SURPRISINGLY GOOD! i used 3 TBL of whole wheat flour and it turned out EXCELLENT! crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.

The first time I made this I used red onions and two 15oz cans of beans - it was absolutely perfect. The second time I used only one can of beans, white onions and too much flour- it was awful! Be careful- too much flour makes the falafels doughy and flavorless.

Very good but not sure it was any better than mixes that we have used. Had no problems with it holding together. We used canned garbanzos and it was easy.

This is now my favorite falafel too. The first time I made it, I used canned beans, 6 tablespoons of flour, and cooked the falafel in 1/4 inch of oil in a deep skillet. It was good, but it did not hold together well. The second time I made it, I also used canned beans, but cut the flour to 4 tablespoons and cut the oil to 1 or 2 tablespoons. I cooked the falafel in a saute pan, medium heat, covered, 5 minutes each side. Perfect.

Really good, and easy too. Forgot to soak my beans overnight, so just boiled them for 5 minutes, turned off and let soak until tender but crunchy, then drained. Also used mint and chives instead of other herbs second time I made them, as it was what I had, and added coriander, a really versatile recipe, the onions and garlic seem oddly mild in the whole shabang.

Loved this !! Dried garbanzo's are a must. WHAT a difference in texture and flavor. For the not so intense onion you can saute or use sweet onion . I have done both. I always double the recipe and put half in the freezer.

Great recipe...easy and delicious! I doubled the cilantro and left out the parsley to save a couple dollars. I served with flat bread, hummus, and a tahini/yogurt sauce.

Rating: 4
This was delicious; however, they did fall apart while frying. I added flour as the recipe suggested, and a few turned out well but the remainder were not nicely round. I had used the bulgar initially in the recipe and I wonder if using only flour would have yielded a more consistant product. I will try the flour next time around.

Amazing! I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. I didn't find the onions to be too powerful, but I tend to like onions. I recommend making your own pitas, too. It's really simple and lots of fun watching the pita puff into a sphere in the oven.

I made these with 1 cup canned chickpeas in a small food processor but was careful not to turn it into hummus. Made about 35 tsp size balls and fried in about a 1/4 inch of oil turning once. They were delicious and the perfect consistency. I'll try it next time with dried beans but you can definitely get good results with canned. Served them with a yogurt tahini sauce, hummus, pita, and a greek salad.

Rating: 4
The problem most people are having using the canned chickpeas vs. dried is that the 1 c. dried is just that. When you soak them, the beans expand. If you use canned you will need to almost double the amount of beans you use. Hope this helps some of you, because the canned works perfectly in this recipe.

Being all Italian and knowing absolutely nothing about Falafel I decided to give this a shot. I used dried chickpeas like everyone suggested. The only thing I omitted was onion because I hate onion. I made a sauce with tahini and fresh lemon juice to put on top. They came out delicious! My husband and I will definitely be repeat Falafel eaters!

Rating: 4
This recipe is a winner! I did use canned chickpeas (but simply toweled them off before adding them) and then added about an extra 1/4 cup of them along with the flour/baking powder. The sandwich seemed to need a bright sauce in addition to the earthy tahini, so I whipped together greek yogurt, lemon juice, and some crushed garlic. If you can get your hands on it, I recommend whole wheat lavash instead of pita bread. It's the second day in a row that we ate vegetarian for dinner, but my husband didn't seem to notice. All he did was rave about how tasty dinner was!

I lovvvved this recipe! I usually buy the store bought kind and I have had falafel in restaurants but this blows everything away by far! It was so good - I cannot even begin to explain! I used dry chickbeans and soakded them for 12-15 hours. I omitted the onion because so many said that ruined the taste. I did the full tsp of red pepper becuase I like them spicy. I substitutded 1 tbs of breadcrumb for flour. Also I just a note - I have a small food processor and did two batches but had to do it separately because not everything fit in there. Also I eat them plain or on my salads and they are so good that way. My husband has never had them before and loved them as well! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I recommend that you DO NOT use canned chick peas or else you'll end up with fried hummus, not falafel.

Good recipe, although I'd never used onions in falafel before. We like to serve it with either a minted cucumber-yogurt sauce or some homemade baba ghanouj. The title of this recipe is My Favorite Falafel, which doesn't sound silly or dense to me. The title of the cookbook is FOOD OF ISRAEL TODAY, also correct. It would be nice if the previous poster could keep politics and prejudices out of this forum.

used a whole 1 lb. bag of dried (soaked) peas, divided in half, and made 2 batches in FP, then mixed 2gether. eyeballed fresh herb amounts, chopped in FP w/ garlic 1st. onion was finely minced 1st, and added later. used ground chilis. needed more heat. used whole wheat flour (max amt.) needed more salt, spices. also added dried coriander. shaped in flat discs, so not raw inside. fit better in pitas, too. froze some discs for later, will see if they fry up well.

This recipe came out wonderful! I am from Israel and this falafel stands among some of the best that can be found here. Falafel here is always made with dried chickpeas! Also, tahini (or "tehina golmit" as it is called in Israel) is never served as is. Put as much as you need in a blender, add a little water, some parsley and/or coriander (optional), salt to taste and a little lemon juice. I always fry one little ball of falafel before I start, to make sure there's enough flour and seasoning. Overall, this recipe is a keeper!

Very good recipe. Used Oat flour instead of white, gave it a nice texture. Flattened out when panfrying and turned out very good. Served with blackbean dip.

to the prior reviewer, obviously this is a food you are unfamiliar with. The tahinni is spread in a thin coat inside the pita. What you're probably thinking of is a cucumber yogurt sauce, also very good with this. Many good recipes for that on epicurious. Take your choice.

I agree with that guy from San Jose: dreadful. I did use sesame tahini and tried to "thin it out a bit with water" and the tahini turned in a thick goo that looked like peanut butter and tasted like sludge. I'd try this again, but I'd like to know what I did wrong before I do.

Rating: 4
Seriously spectacular, even if you don't have fresh cilantro or parsley and use dried. I do use a little less onion than called for. But don't bother tasting it before you fry it; it will taste disgustingly onion-y, but then mellow out after it has been cooked. And, no, using raw beans is not a mistake. Just do it!

Doubled the recipe and made some changes to it, overall would rate this a huge success, made a batch for a party and all was gone before I even noticed! -- I'm originally from Israel, by the way, and am extremely picky about my falafel. Used two cans of (15oz) organic chickpeas, drained, and followed the mixing instructions of another helpful member. Even though I doubled the recipe I still used just over a quarter of a large onion, which to me was enough, 6 cloves of garlic and instead of pepper flakes used ground chili. I did, however, add a medium sized red bell pepper to the mix, which added both texture and color. Obviously the added flavor was worth it too. 6 tablespoons of flour did the trick. I made significantly larger disks than suggested (overall batch yielded 22 falafel disks) but the idea was to serve them along side a special salad I make, so the size was appropriately calculated. Messed up one batch by not heating up the "replacement" oil properly, but what did come out turned out delicious. Dish came out on the light side, which was appreciated, and had a nice and slightly moist texture, unlike the super-dry falafel you get all over NY. Will definitely try this again; curious to see how dried chickpeas will fare. Next time will use just a tad less garlic and maybe try bulgur instead of flour. Another interesting twist was that since the falafel was to be served a good time and distance away from my kitchen, I had the disks preliminarily-fried in my place (using a small pan with a generous serving of EVOO) and then baked for about 15-20 minutes, medium heat, at the party itself. Traveled rather well!

I used two cups canned chick peas instead of the one cup dried. Used sweet Vidalia onion chopped fine in deference to comments by others. I flattened the balls to cook quicker in the center and fried them in olive oil to add to the Eastern Mediterranean flavor profile. Otherwise no other changes to the recipe. Served them in a pita lined with a lettuce leaf, sliced hot house cukes and diced tomatoes, with a choice of tahina or cacik. Great Flavor! Next batch I will try adding bulgur and less white flour for texture, as the canned chick peas are a little soft.

For best results, use dried chickpeas that have been soaked over night.

The first time I made this recipe, I used canned chickpeas instead of dried. The canned chickpeas resulted in a moist and soft textured falafel. This time, instead of using canned chickpeas I will use dried. I hope this will result in a firmly textured falafel which I prefer.

This is very good. I used two extra tbsp of flour, after replacing 5 of the original 5 tbsps of flour with bulgur. Shaped the dough into 5 disks and pan-fried in about 1 tbsp of olive oil. Delicious!

This is a regular in our house. You won't find better including here in Israel. Use dried chickpeas and deepfry flattened balls. They soak up almost no oil. I'm not a cilantro fan,but here it fits when used in moderation. Great as an appetizer or part of a Mideastern meal.

Question:How many cans of chickpeas per single recipe?

Rating: 4
This is a new favorite and even my kids love this with the raw onion, spices and herbs, as is. I have doubled the recipe and have used canned chick peas both times (2 cans). Unfortunately, you can't skimp on the flour or they really do fall apart. As a prior reviewer suggested, I add the chick peas after the onion, cilantro, etc... , but before the flour and baking powder. Have not found them to be raw in the middle. Have used both canola and corn oil and both have worked well. Absolutely delicious.

This recipe beat out my old standby by a wide margin, making this my new favorite. I loved the smokey cumin flavor. Didn't have cilantro but added more parsley as others did. I also made disks instead of balls - easier to fry up. Served with yogurt/tahini sauce.

This is now my favorite falafel. I used canned because I had on hand - 19 oz can to the onion, garlic, herbs etc the recipe called for (proportions were good). I heeded others' advice and sauteed onions in advance. I browned in a little oil and then baked to be crisper and warm. Keeper.

If you find that the balls are not cooked in the center, turn down your oil temperature. This takes a bit of tuning. I made this recipe substituting 3 medium leeks for the onion and the result was fantastic.

Great recipe. I followed it exactly. I used a fryer & it only took 2 minutes per batch. I see what the last reviewer said about the inside never really cooking. I didn't have too much onion, but next time, I will be more careful about the quantity to avoid the raw onion potential (I think I just got lucky with using less!). However, I might also saute the onion first. Why not? I made my falafel smaller than recommended. I got 25 out of the batch & I liked the smaller size (more crunch to center proportion). Also, I soaked the peas 2 nights in the fridge & no problem using them that way. They had tripled in size by then. But I wish my falafel were a little less dense. Any suggestions? Would adding bulgur do anything? I had to add 6 tablespoons flour. Would appreciate any suggestions. Thanks!

Loved this recipe, however it does cause the house to take on the odor of the Middle Eastern food. Veteran falafel eaters said it was the best they ever tried and I agree! Try to use the dried chickpeas soaked overnight - in my case for about 30 hours, and don't worry about not cooking them, makes perfect falafel. Made it twice in a weekend, fried the 2nd batch in the garage in a deep fryer -- much less odor!

This is my forever falafel recipe. It is flavorful, spicy, and (as my guests remarked) better than you can get ANYWHERE. I substitute more parsley for cilantro (don't care too much for the taste), and use all the required flour, with no problem. I double the recipe and freeze the uncooked extra to pull out for snacks or dinners. Salivating just thinking about it.

I liked the spice and herb combinations - however, I found that deep frying overpowers the delicate flavours. My solution: lightly spray the balls with olive oil spray and bake them in the oven (180 degrees), until they turn brown.

Okay, so here is the skinny: The results of this recipe are very good, very, but there are some caveats to the actual process and the recipe. If you use canned beans (soaking the dry ones is better), your moisture content will be much higher and the beans require MUCH less processing in the food processor. I know this as I used canned and learned the hard way the first time I made this. Now that I took the time to make it a third time (first and third using canned beans), I can add the following: When using canned beans, add onion, chopped garlic and pepper flakes to food processor first. Process a bit until the size of eraser heads or a bit smaller. Add beans, herbs and pulse, stir, pulse until pieces are about the size of large pin-heads. No further. Turn the results into a bowl, add cumin, salt, baking powder, and flour. Stir to combine. Do not use the food processor for this step unless you are very careful with the pulse button. Also, note: Smaller food processors are not appropriate for this recipe. You need a regular full sized one otherwise it's "pulse once stir once" for many minutes. You really don't want a "dough", and if you are using more than 4 to 6 tablespoons of flour you are making dough. Actually, if you need more than 4 tablespoons, your recipe with be dense. That's it. Fry away, and they are quite good and won't disappear (dissolve in the oil when frying.).

YummY! My DH and I couldnt get enough of this falafel from heaven! I made the mix on Saturday and added everything except the flour. I wanted the flavours to mingle for our dinner on Monday. I stirred in 5 Tbs of flour, made the balls, let them sit for about 10 minutes, until the oil heated, and then fried them in small batches. I preheated the oven to 350 to keep them hot while I continued frying. I served them in warmed pitas filled with Hummus, Lemon Tabouli (both recipes from this site) and store-bought Tzatziki. My DH is not a fan of hummus but he said this was excellent and wanted more. Needless to say were having leftovers for dinner tonight. I made the Hummus and Tabouli on Saturday too so all I had to do was fry the falafel  easy for a work-night meal.

The nicest, lightest felafel I've ever had. I did, however, have a bit of trouble getting it to the right frying consistency. And the felafel had a tendency to send out little "off-shoots" into the fryer. Could this have been a consistency problem?

Excellent!! I love falafel but was always afraid that it would be difficult to make. Not the case at all! My fiance and I loved it and even ate it 3 times last week just because it was that good. Also the ingredients are really cheap. I think the total damage on this was way less than $10. For 3 meals, that's a bargain.

I threw all the ingredients in the food processor. Then I put the mixture in the fridge and went to work. That evening I formed the balls and fried them. It was a big hit. In fact I'll make them again soon. Can this type of recipe work with other types of beans? I am trying to include more meat free meals In our diet.

I used to live in Montreal and lived off of falafel sandwiches from a Lebanese shop down the street from my apartment. Since I move to Whistler I have not been able to find a falafel that compares, and when you do they don't even have Naveh(pickled turnips). But I digress.... this recipe reminds me of the falafel from that shop in Montreal. This is the biggest score ever!!! Thanks Epicurious!!!!! The recipe made quite a bit so I froze half - will let you know how it turns out after freezing. As chick peas freeze really well I don't see there being a problem. I went to the link the recipe notes give and it was not up yet.

Holy moly! This falafel is awesome! I was out of ground cumin (bummer), so I substituted turmeric. I also left out the parsley, and used more cilantro. It was very good in pita sandwiches with homemade hummus (recipe found here), cucumbers, tomatoes, and lettuce. I did find the onion to be a bit over powering because it stayed very raw. Next time, I might cook some of the onion in a saute pan before adding it to the other ingredients. On day two of eating the falafel, I put it in a 420 degree oven for about ten minutes after browning it in a saute pan. It was more "cooked through" that way. Next time, I'm also going to make the homemade wheat pita bread (recipe on this site, too). Anyway. YUM!
