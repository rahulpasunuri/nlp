Loved it! However, I did not want to fry the chicken either, so I drizzled it with olive oil baked it at 375 for 35 minutes or so. The crust was crunchy, and flavor was wonderful! Chicken was so tender - definitely a keeper!

Yum! The curry definitely makes it, but I added cumin, which pumped up the volume, making it an even more unusual fried chicken dinner. I sauteed the spinach and tomatoes with garlic, to warm up the whole meal. My kids scarffed it down. I'll definitely make it again.

Yummy, but salty! Next time I'd use about half the amount of salt listed.

I've made this a few times, it's a definite keeper. Previous review recommends sautee after marinating, and I might give that a try. Something about the buttermilk makes the chicken delighfully tender. After a long day at work, I sometimes cheat and use a good quality bottled balsamic vinaigrette on the salad. Once, I used sundried tomatoes when cherry tomatoes were out of season, and added cucumber for fresh crunch. Worked for us!!

Recipe purists, grant me amnesty here, since I'm 1 of YOU. That said, read on (if you're not too aggravated to do so). I did not make fried chicken. Rather, I was searching for an easy, low-fat marinade for chicken breasts & I found it, with this recipe. Skinless, boneless chicken breasts. Boring, right? NUH UH! Marinate them (in the marinade of course), at least 4 hrs or overnight. Drain a bit, then sauté them in olive oil. Heavenly, moist, tasty & OH-so-very-EZ!!! Buttermilk, curry, salt & chicken were made to go together. And of course, you can still serve the chicken atop the salad & but I made mixed, roasted vegetables instead! HA!

I loved it and I am not a curry fan. The chicken was moist and delicious. I will definately make this again.

oh dang was this a yummy recipe, I prepared it just as suggested, and loved loved it, as did my other dining companions! Worth all the calories, I wouldn't change a thing (although maybe I'd add an extra hour of cardio next time I work out!)I would make it again in a heartbeat and just finished the leftovers for lunch, still delicious the next day. The salad was so good I can't wait to make that again with another dish for dinner

This is amazing! I always make a big batch before we go camping and use it over a couple of days - in tortillas with lettuce adn a yogurt dressing or with salad. Delish!

This is a keeper. I don't fry very often because of the mess and fat, but this is definitely worth the oil. Everyone loved this variation on classic fried chicken.

WOW! This is a wonderful fried chicken recipe. We loved it. We did not serve the chicken over the sald but had it on the side and made Potatoe salad with roasted peppers ( on this site) for a side dish. This was a great meal. The chicken took longer to cook than suggested.

Wonderful fried chicken, I made a couple of times and got raves from everyone. And I'd never made fried chicken before. I skipped the curry (hate it) and used a chipotle/southwest spice blend. I'm not sure about the salad -- my husband noted that the chicken doesn't need the salad, but the salad needs the chicken and they taste good together but the blend of flavors is nothing special.

FANTASTIC fried chicken - worth all of the grease/cleanup/launder all of your cooking clothes/wash your hair factor. Spices add an undefineable positive dimension. Served with mashed potatoes and gravy, much to the delight of my greens-suspicious family. Test piece was pink at the bone - oven roasted for an additional 10 minutes.

This was my first frying experience (afraid or splattering oil, not interested in the extra calories), but this recipe had a big TRY IT! written all over it for me. Now, here is finger-licking good fried chicken. I agree it browned in less time than the recipe said, an I think for ease I would do boneless next time (by the way, I did take my skin off first), but the flavors are worth the effort to make again.

I did this with skinless chicken breasts and used the panko parmigan idea, OYFG this was great. I think i will add some heat next time to give it a southwestern taste!

I made this dish last night for my sister and her family. Everyone loved it. I used boneless skinless chicken breast that I cut into strips making the dish similar to chicken tenders. Delicious. Being a novice at frying chicken I found it difficult to maintain the temperature of the oil at 350 but everything still came out fine. Any tips for frying?

This is a tasty and easy recipe. I didn't fry it, instead, I replaced the flour with 1 cup of Panko and about 1/3 cup of grated parmesan cheese (still included the chili powder), then baked at 425 for 50 minutes. We normally find baked chicken quite bland but, we really enjoyed these flavors. I'm sure if you fried it, it would be excellent.

Delicious! I used large skinless (for less fat) chicken breasts and sliced them sideways. Used a little less chilli -for our taste and cooked them in olive oil. The verdict from the family was 'make them again'.

This is in response to the question about skipping the flour step and just baking the dish. I tried it that way and it still turned out decent. My personal enhancement was a dash of ginger-garlic paste to the buttermilk. Ciao!

Fabulous! I precook the chicken in the oven prior to frying to cut down on time. Even better the next day

All these flavors sound wonderful. Does anyone know if you can bake the chicken (skipping the flour step) and still yield a decent dish?

In addition to being delicious, this dish is also beautiful.

I haven't made this yet but it sounds great and I have all the ingredients. Does anyone have an opinion on if they think this would work with boneless skinless chicken breasts or do you think it needs the skin to work out right?

This was absolutely delicious and moist chicken with a hint of curry. My wife and I have prepared this twice now for our picnics at outdoor concerts and everyone raves about it. The chicken browns beautifully. Our last guests are in the catering business and wanted the recipe. A definite Keeper!

I, together with 12 of my friends, absolutely love this chicken. I made it for an outdoor concert in Hampstead Heath, London, and it turned out perfectly. I added roughly chopped cilantro to the marinade which livened up and already lively recipe. I have made it twice this summer and I'm sure that I'll repeat it again at least once. As I think the chicken browns in the oil quite quickly, I finish it off in the oven to ensure that it is cooked through.

This was OK, but I think leaving it out at room temp was a bad idea.
