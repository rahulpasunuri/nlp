didn't like it; sauce came out watery and too much of it.

Paprika and sugar alone doesn't make a good barbecue seasoning. This dish was way too sweet and two cups of seasoning was way too much. This recipe is awful.

I made this recipe for a summer BBQ. The ribs were very popular and the sauce and seasoning were just perfect. If the ribs aren't heavily seasoned with salt, the seasoning was a little sweet for my tastes. Also, it was difficult to grill them on indirect heat, which resulted in the ribs being a little overdone.
