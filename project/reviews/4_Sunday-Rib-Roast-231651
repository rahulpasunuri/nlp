I can't believe how absolutely awesome this is. Best prime rib that I ever had. I cooked it at 500 deg For 8 min a pound. Let it stand in the oven for 1 hour without opening the door. I never cooked any meat like this and for the cost of the meat I was scared. It turned out perfect. OMG!!!!

Had to adjust cooking time for a 2 pounder since I only cooked for 2. It turned out perfectly medium rare.Paired with a roasted vegetable medley and a salad of winter greens it seemed almost too elegant to eat on our everyday dinnerware.

I don't follow this recipe for seasoning, but these cooking directions work the best of any I've tried. A lot of people and recipes recommend starting at 500 and then turning the oven off etc. This works better.

Made exactly as directed and it turned out great. Had a boneless prime rib so it could've use a about 10 more minutes in the oven. Company loved it made a most impressive meal.

Well, I'm doing this recipe as we speak - This is the only recipe I ever use. One of the few recipes that one can make 'as written' and it turns out great. Occasionally I get a roast that is tough ( too much adrenalin before the slaughter?)and no one cares because it's so tasty.

I have made this two times and it was excellent both times. The second time I stepped it up a little and added a little onion powder & Cayenne pepper to the mustard flour mixture and then hit it with a couple shots of worcester after I put the it on the roast. I also put halved red potatoes, sliced onion and a couple cloves of garlic in the bottom of the pan and added a bottle of red wine and a little balsamic vinager. This turned out great too. A great stand by for rib roast.

Super easy and super delicious. The mustard flour rub creates a tasty and attractive finish. This one is a keeper.

I thought it sounded at first like it would taste like mustard but it didn't at all, it just added a delicious taste to the meal. The crust(which you mostly remove) was the perfect, light crust to the outer edge. It was so juicy (I think I added a half an hr on cooking time, you'll be able to tell by the temp., I took it out when it read rare so it was med rare when served) I served the rib roast w/ creamy horseradish sauce on the side and made the recommended scored potatoes (added some carrots too) and the onion gravy (read my review and what I added to make it even better) and a salad w/ french viniagrette and a crusty bread. My guests LOVED it and I will definitely make it again!!!

I made this once before and it was one of the best meals I have ever made. I am making it again for Christmas dinner this year.

The dry mustard and flour make a delious crust and I followed the recipe exactly. Just perfect. I served it with the wonderful Horseradish Cream Sauce. I look forward to making this again.

I followed this recipe exactly, except for the cooking time. 8 minutes per pound at 500 degrees, then leave oven door shut and let rest for one hour. This is one of the best meals I have ever prepared and by far the best prime rib. Really easy preparation! Do not skip the mustard!!!

This is a true English speciality and one of the best things you can eat. If you want to do it properly roast some floury (not new) potatoes (King Edwards are best)make a sauce from the juices in the meat roasting pan, and serve with a selection of roast parsnips, carrots, cabbage or other seasonal veg - that's how it is done here in England.

Like a few others I was worried about the mustard ... but having risked it all I can say is this was absolutely amazing. Subtle, delicious. Served with grilled asaparagus/red peppers, butternut squash & potatoes (all grilled / roasted separately). Will definitely repeat.

This is the best way to cook ANY roast. Just make sure you follow the cooking times reccomended. No wonder Dallas' roast turned out well done, using a smaller roast and the same cooking time. The breakdown is roughly four and a half minutes per pound at the higher temp before you turn it down.

Yup, this is it: my death row meal. Simple, perfectly seasoned, needing nothing more than a dab of horseradish to make it perfect. If I could give this 5 stars I would. This is my New Year's Eve dinner from now on.

I was hesitant to try this recipe because of the mustard powder but I figured I could always scrape it off if the raost tasted like mustard. I don't like to mess around to much with an excellent cut of meat like a rib roast, but I took Santa Monica's advice and tried it. After cooking and resting for the prescibed time and temp I was amazed at how flavorful the crust was. It really made a great prime rib dinner greater. I will definately make this one again.

I remember this recipe from 3 years ago. It is simple, fairly easy to make, and yummy. :) I'm making it this time for mother-in- law's birthday dinner.

Can't believe something so simple could taste sooooo good. Would like to try this on the barbeque

To me this is the quintessential recipe for making English Prime Rib. Those who choose not to use the dry (powdered) mustard are really missing out. The mustard powder combined with the flour makes for a deliciously cripsy and flavorful crust on the exterior. As an accompaniment, I peel whole small/med. (not baby) potatoes, boil them for 2 mins, and then I use the tines of a fork to scrape them, making the exterior very rough looking. When I put the potatoes into the pan to roast with the meat, that roughness transforms into crispiness as the potatoes cook in fat from the meat.

This was the first time I've ever cooked a roast! I made this for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it! This recipe was so easy and my roast came out perfect!! I used grill seasoning instead of the mustard rub and it was very flavorful and tender! My family are all asking me when I'm gonna make the roast again!

I've been cooking for years, but this was my first foray at a traditional roast, so I was nervous despite the ease of the recipe. Needless to say, it turned out great. My addition was to toss cubed new potatoes, carrots, parsnips, turnips, and quartered onions with a bit of olive oil and dried rosemary, and then add to the pan after I reduced the heat to 350 degrees. When I removed the meat to rest, I increased the heat to 400 and let the veggies roast for the 25 minutes more. The overall dish tasted great!

This recipe worked like a charm! Reviews were most helpful, too. I rubbed the roast with Montreal Steak Spice & cooked at 500 for 25 mins and then turned heat down as per recipe. Checked every 20 minutes per Dallas review. My thermometer read 130 degrees when all was done & roast was perfectly medium rare! No disappointments at the table, either.

I cooked 3 lb version and after 1 hour it was well done. Would suggest checking temperature every 20 minutes.

Rubbed the roast with garlic, smeared on the dijon, seasoned with salt & pepper and rosemary. 500 F for 20 minutes. My only change for next time will be to let the roast stand at room temperature an hour before roasting.

Well everyone said this was the foolproof roast recipe.... My ovens heating element died half way through making this, I had to load it half baked in the snow into the back of my truck, drive it across town and finish cooking in a friends oven.... and it was delicious!! How's that for foolproof.

I made a minor varient of this on New Year's Day. Turned out fantastic! The roast had a crispy dark brown crust which held the juices in, looked impressive, and tasted great. My modification was to rub the roast all over with plenty of garlic, then pepper, then salt - salt forms the crisp crust. Next time I'll try a little rosemary, too (that should really give the kitchen a great aroma).

This is a killer "can't lose" recipe! I added sprigs of rosemary and some garlic cloves into the roast and raised the temp to 500 for the first 20 mins. My family loves this!!
