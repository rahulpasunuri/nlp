Excellent and easy. Made it Gluten Free by using Gluten free flour which worked in this case just as well as regular. I cooked some bacon first and then used the same pan to make the sauce and get some of the bacon goodness which turned out great. I also added nutmeg and some grated parmesan to the top. Made it ahead of time and threw in the fridge.

Fresh young spinach is definitely important and I also added some sauteed onion and freshly grated Romano cheese. My husband thought it was terrific and asked me to be sure I remember what I did for next time.

Super easy and delish! I added fresh grated nutmeg, a dash of cayenne and about a quarter cup of fresh grated pecorino romano, as well as salt and pepper.

Made with chopped frozen spinach as a time-saver. Also added the shallot, nutmeg, cayenne and parm that the other reviewers mentioned. It was wonderful!

This is delicious and easy to make. I agree that a pinch of freshly ground nutmeg is a wonderful addition. I used white pepper and seasoned the sauce before adding the spinach back. I too think that it is not necessary to trim baby spinach so I'll skip that step next time. My kids still didn't eat the spinach but my husband and I loved it (and I don't like creamed spinach). Wonderful dish!

This was the first time I've ever made or even eaten creamed spinach, and it was delicious!Made it to go w/ some NewYork steaks, and followed the suggestions of other reviewers who recommended adding some garlic in with the butter, as well as some fresh ground nutmeg and some Parmesan/Asiago/Roma no cheese blend as well.It's rich, so your servings should be small, but it's really a great side dish, and unusual. I think the number of servings is wrong, as written though. It doesn't serve two, more like six to eight small servings. Wonderful!

Very delicious and easy. Added two pinches nutmeg, sauteed shallot in the butter as per a previous reviewer's suggestion, and added salt. Really fantastic

Use the baby spinach prepackaged (rinse first if you like). You do not have to de-stem baby spinach as it is so tender! It is so easy that way and even better with the baby spinach. Made it for our Christmas dinner and it went fast.

Yum! i made this last night for me and my boyfriend. it was delicious and pretty darn simple. the jersey city grocery store didn't have fresh spinach, so we used 1 1/2 16 oz. bags of frozen "cut spinach." wilted it in the microwave. had to adjust the proportions a bit b/c I think it was more spinach than 2 fresh bunches - 2 T butter, 1 cup cream, 3 cloves garlic chopped, dash nutmeg, salt, pepper. BF would have added more cream, but i enjoyed it the way it was. Were going to make it for turkey day.

Yummy! I made this according to the recipe and I think it make more like 4 servings. I added some nutmeg, which I would definitely do again. Also, when I make this again I will add a very finely chopped shallot to the butter in the beginning, just to give the dish a little bit extra flavor. Also, salt and pepper were needed. The proportions were great though...I may try to make it with fat free 1/2 & 1/2 so I don't feel so guilty eating it!!

delish, easy, made for the boy on valentines day and then the following week for some girlfriends (from memory that time). turned out great, and everyone loved it! the toughest part is de-stemming the spinach, takes awhile.

I agree. I thought flour was a thickening agent ..Oh well. I thought it was great. Add a bit of sugar and pleanty of salt and pepper. Quick and easy.

For the person who said they wouldn't make this recipe due to lack of flour and nutmeg....it has flour in the recipe and you can always add nutmeg. The dish was delicous! I added parmagiano cheese and lots of garlic. We all loved it in my house.

I make this all the time...I added some nutmeg and top with parmesan reggiano. I make it in advance and microwave it before serving.

I would not make this recipe because creamed spinach must have nutmeg and should have a thickening agent like flour.
