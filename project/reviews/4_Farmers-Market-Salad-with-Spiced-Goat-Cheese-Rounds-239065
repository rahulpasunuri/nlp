We did not enjoy this salad, I made it based on the excellent reviews, seemed like a sure thing. We didn't like the cumin in the goat cheese at all & thought the vinegrette was not good. Alot of work for something very ho hum.....just didn't click with us....

The salad tasted as good as it looked. I agree with other reviews the one doesn't necessarily need the greens, but it does stretch it for a main meal. You could easily add chicken or slices of beef, if you had a must meat-eater in your group. It's a keeper.

Really great salad. The spiced goat cheese is delicious with the new potatoes. Serve it with some crusty bread and butter, and you've got yourself a meal.

This was an absolutely delicious salad. You must try it. Easy to make and such a crowd pleasure. Makes alot.

My husband and I felt that the cumin in the spice mix for the goat cheese overwhelmed the other flavors. If I were to make this again, I would leave that out, add a bit of bread crumbs and toast the goat cheese.

Excellent recipe, with or without the salad greens, and I haven't yet bothered with the goat cheese at all since I've served it as a side chicken once and steak the other time. Rave reviews both times. I did add a bit of lemon zest to the dressing for added brightness.

I love this salad! I've made it for many parties and as a dish for several friends that had recently had babies and it is always well received. The only change I make is that instead of making goat cheese rounds I just mix the spices and sesame seeds into the goat cheese and serve it with store bought crostini - saves a ton of time, and tastes just as good, plus the crostini adds another nice textural element.

This is yummy and hardy. We had it with some bacon and egg sandwiches for a really filling meal.

The salad was great, but my family thought it was too fussy and had too much going on. I served it again at another dinner without the salad greens and without rolling the goat cheese rounds in the sesame. It was a simpler presentation that was still very good.

Delicious. Did almost exactly as written except I roasted the potatoes for the last part of the cooking process (they were taking a long time to steam), and I sauteed the goat cheese so it would be warm when serving. Ingredients worked really well together, and the dish was really filling for a main dish. Will definitely make again!

One of the best salad recipes I have made; I'll definitely make it again! It looks gorgeous and tastes great. The dressing is mild but full of flavor. I used a lemon infused olive oil for the dressing and gave the cheese rounds a quick bake but otherwise followed the recipe as written.

This was a lovely, crisp salad; the baby potatoes (I used baby Yukon) were a nice twist. Instead of making the goat cheese rounds (because I was feeling lazy), I bought herb goat cheese and sprinkled that atop the salad. The vinaigrette also made a nice marinade for chicken.

I wasn't going to review this recipe last night when I made it and was going to chalk it up to just an average recipe. When I woke up this morning, my husband and I were still tasting the shallot from the vinaigrette. Gross! This made me post this this morning to forewarn you of the dressing. We followed the recipe to a T - I didn't think it tasted too strong last night, but we can't shake the shallot taste from over 12 hours ago. Yuck.

Quick Tip for cutting goat cheese - use dental floss - works like a charm

This recipe is quite delicious; I love the vinaigrette. Because I was making this as a side and not a main, I omitted the goat cheese rounds and the potatoes. However, because of the beans it was STILL a little to filling, and for future side salads will probably toss my own combination with the vinaigrette. However, I am anxious to try the full recipe as a main dish because it is so good. Simple to make and very tasty and presentable.

I've made this salad several times and always get great comments from guests. It's a great salad for my vegetarian friends too! I have always followed the recipe exactly. The goat cheese can be a little challenging to cut perfectly, but no one seemed to care that it wasn't in perfect rounds. :)

Great recipe! The dressing is a great, mild dressing you can use for a large variety of salads, and the goat cheese rounds have become a staple in my house. The salad itself, I could take or leave. I seem to make just as successful of a dish with any number of other greens/add-ins. The goat cheese comes off a little strong, so I tend to break it up into much smaller pieces, but that's just preference.

This salad suffered from a bad combination of flavors - the salad portion (potatoes, lettuce, tomatoes, green beans, dressing, basil) went well together, and would have gone great with the goat cheese coated in just salt, pepper, thyme and sesame. The cumin and paprika were flavors that did not go with the rest of the recipe at all, and actually were kind of gross. I was so disturbed by the combination that I re-made the salad leaving out the cumin and paprika, and then it worked. Also, I added a bit of minced garlic to the dressing to give it a little bit of tang. I wouldn't recommend the dish to anyone as-is.

I thought this was delicious and a hit at the BBQ I brought it too. The only changes I made was to use 1/2 the greens simply because I ran out of room on my platter and I used finely crushed almonds instead of sesame seeds. I didn't have the seeds. Lastly I rolled the goat cheese since cutting it didn't work.

Excellent salad! I have made this for several different dinner guests and get rave reviews. I thought the rounds were hard to work with so instead, I rolled the goat cheese into little balls and coated them with the herb/seasoning mixture -- works very well.

It was alright, a bit like the Austro-Prussian War with Italy and Germany too involved in something they should stay out of (2 salads in one). I was a big fan of the basil mixed in with the greens; the dressing complemented the bitter-sweet leafy goodness.

I think this salad is very good and not as labor intensive as it appears. I did find the vinaigrette a little bland and will try to find something else. Since many of these ingredients are from a nicoise I may try a lemon dressing. I also prefer crispy warm goat cheese so I added the seasoning for the goat cheese to some panko. I dipped the goat cheese rounds in some beaten egg white and then the panko. I chilled them and then sauted them in a little canola oil. Very good.

The greens overwhelmed the taste of any other ingredient. The goat cheese rounds with their outer coating were gross. The only good thing about this dish was the potatoes, olives, and beans. All in all, not a great dish.

This was terrific - works well as salad meal. I couldn't find the cheese log, so we just had some goat cheese on crackers - next time, I'll try the rounds!

Excellent salad that everyone at the table loved. I left out goat cheese rounds to save time, but just plain goat cheese would've been good. Left out basil, which would've been too much. Everything else was perfect!

This is a fresh, flavorful, elegant salad! I used it as a substantial side but could easily see having it as a vegetarian summer dinner. The goat cheese rounds were an amazing complement to the rest of the salad.

Wonderful salad. Made this for a formal dinner with only meat and a veggie on plate. The perfect complement.

This salad is great. I only gave it 3 stars because I wasn't fond of the herb choice for the goat cheese rounds. The second time I made it I used parsley, sesame seeds, roasted red pepper flakes and thyme and that combination worked well. I also tried it with the dressing recipe from "Mixed Greens with Roasted Asparagus and Apple" by Anne Graziano as that is my favorite dressing now.

Perfect main course salad on the hottest day of the year in Portland. Made it for guests and everybody loved it. The tip about slicing the goat cheese log with dental floss was a great one. Followed the recipe pretty much exactly--used kalamata olives. Delicious,easy, and being able to do all the cooking in advance kept the kitchen cool!

Excellent salad - only change I made was with the goat cheese rounds (made them the Alice Waters way - flour, egg, bread crumbs then baked). This would be a great recipe for a crowd - a real keeper.

Made this once last summer and just made it again last night. Guests actually took pictures of the salad on the platter and said it was a beautiful work of art! It really is a very pretty presentation if you want to impress. I wish I had sprinkled some finishing salt on it, though...this second time I thought it was a bit bland for me. Just be sure to taste your potatoes and green beans before you serve the platter and see if you need to finish it with some Maldon Sea Salt. It is also an easy dish to come together...if you've done all prep in advance. I served it with Halibut and Lemon Basil Vinaigrette on this sight. Also had Hot Feta and Tomato Spread with Pita chips for appetizer. All was fantastic!

Only modification I made was to quickly saute the cheese rounds in a small amount of olive oil - it crisps the sesame seeds and releases the flavors wonderfully. My teenagers were crazy about this salad!

Terrific salad made the first day that our farmer's market opened this year. Great textures and colors. I substituted balsamic vinegar for red wine vinegar (ran out) and was fine. I did need to double the dressing. Spicing the goat cheese is not necessary and would prefer it plain next time.

I forgot to mention, I used 1 tsp ground cumin and 1 tsp cumin seeds which I toasted in a dry skillet with the sesame seeds. I like the added flavor of toasted seeds. This is a keeper!

Hearty but fresh and healthy. Used summer flavors but heavy enough to be satisfying. Nice colors and textures. Could be adapted to use/substitute what you have on hand.We used 3 rounds of goat cheese per person instead of 4 and found it to be plenty even for an entree salad.

Great salad and beautiful presentation! It looks impressive on the platter, especially if you add some orange and yellow heirloom tomatoes. Easy to make ahead of time and assembles quickly. Use unflavored dental floss or a cheese wire to easily cut the goat cheese slices.

Sooo good, everyone loved it. I couldn't find Goat Cheese Rounds, so I used Chevre goat milk cheese and i just cut it into pieces and that worked fine.(cheese is hard to cut it's soft) I boiled potatoes and green beans till they were tender and that was good too. Arugula is good too w/ mixed green lettuce.
