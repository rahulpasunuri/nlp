A disaster! This must be for more experienced pastry chefs. My log would not roll. The dough was too soft. The pastry cream soaked into the dough and formed a sticky mess. The result was doughy mounds with a strong yeast flavor. Would not make againi.

I used dried cranberries and they were very good. I overcooked the first tray although my fan assisted oven was at 410 and I only baked them for 11 minutes. 10 minutes at 400 worked a charm. I used bakers paper on a pastry board plus the flour and the chilled dough rolled out easily but when I added the pastry cream and cranberries, it was impossible to roll up, so I popped in back in the fridge overnight. The next morning, the cold dough rolled up easily and I sliced it and left it to rise. The finished pastries were really quite lovely.

Don't use plastic wrap on your cream, or on anything high in fats, the plastic tends to leach into the food. Dioxins are carcinogenic.

These were wonderful, although time-consuming, so I doubt I'll make them too often. They weren't as good as what I had in Paris though (perhaps those were made with croissant dough). I made them over the course of 3 days, which worked well. I did not have a problem with the brioche dough. I did notice that the dough needed to be mixed for several minutes before it really became smooth and workable, so don't underbeat the dough.

These were a ton of work and the flavor was marginal. Although, ithe boring flavor could have been because I had to add so much flour to the dough because it was impossible to work with!

note: I used the brioche recipe in the Fannie Farmer cookbook, my standard brioche recipe, with much success. Also used cranberries instead of raisins this time, in honor of thanksgiving. Made the dough in advance, filled the rolls, chilled overnight and transported 4 hours to inlaws house (covered and cool in the back of the car) to be baked as a thanksgiving dessert. Excellent. the F.F. recipe really is very good. Ingredients and rise-times below: 2 pckgs yeast 1 cp milk 2/3 cup butter 1 egg 4 egg yolks 1/4 cup sugar 1/12 tsp salt, lemon rind, 5ish cups flour. dissolve yeast in milk. add butter, eggs sugar salt + 2 cups flour. add more flour until dough is *manageable* knead 10 minutes. let rise 'til doubled. punch down. let rise 4 hours. shape let rise bake @ 350 makes 1 loaf and 6 rolls

Does anyone know where the bioche recipe is? When I click on the "link" it takes me to "SESAME FLATBREAD CRACKERS"??????

These are simply delicious. Time consuming, but well worth it. It's true that the dough is difficult to handle - it's very elastic. But I've made these pastries a couple of times and every time it gets easier. I would agree with adding a bit more butter. I would also suggest to roll the dough out on a wax paper, chill it for a while and then spread the cream and form into a log - this makes rolling it up much easier. Good luck!

As long as I live in a place where they sell pain aux raisins in the bakery, I have decided not to make this again. It took a long time and the dough was very soft and difficult to work with. However, the result was better than some bakeries I have been to but definitely not how I want it to be. Will keep it for the future.

The brioche were outstanding. This is one of those recipes where you look at/taste the final results and can't believe that YOU made it! You need to allow lots of time. I started on Thursday morning and we had the pastries for breakfast on Saturday.

The brioches were awfully delicious but was so hard to make because the dough was too elastic..very very sticky and so was hard to make the roll... I would suggest that once the dough has been chilled....quickly roll out the dough and make the roll while the dough is still a little hard... And also, if u want it to have a better flavour, add another 1/4 cup of butter.... best of luck !

This was my first attempt at the recipe, I've had them in Paris. Making the brioche dough it was like thick waffle batter, definitely not smooth and elastic. I added more flour and will wait to see how it turns out. It was a nice afternoon for baking and having a 1990 J. Schram which was my belated New Years celebration. Is the recipe correct? I am not a baker although am a fairly accomplished cook. Any info would be appreciated.... the J. Schram was delightful!
