Although I liked this dish I think it is much better - and healthier - to cook in the oven with less oil. I do not salt any of the vegetables, I just cut them up in big chunks, put into a bowl and toss with olive oil - enough to coat. I then put them all into a roasting pan and roast at a high temperature until cooked - 30-40 minutes. I usually put a piece of foil on top to keep the edges from burning for the first 20 minutes and then take off to get the vegetables crispy. Add more oil if necessary and stir vegetabels in the oven 2 or more times. I would also put the tomatoes in as cherry/small plum after twenty minutes. You can top with goats cheese (bake for 5 minutes) or serve topped greek yogurt or fromage frais - if you can find it.
