It was pretty good, but needed some pepping up. I'd suggest making a flavorful herb vinaigrette and adding that rather than the olive oil. Still, it was a hit, and a refreshing change from my usual preparation for lima beans (served warm with butter/garlic/parmesan).

This was included in our neighborhood progressive dinner menu. It was very disappointing. The first time was okay, but different people's variations were scary! Boring, not worth the chopping!

I used canned great northern beans (very low cost). This was a great side dish for a greek meal. It's also a great summer salad, especially if you are inviting non-carnevours.

I enjoyed this alot , it was easy and fast to make. I substituted cans of white beans both small and large and it was wonderful. I will be making it for a large group of vegetarian and have given it to friends
