Loved this recipe. I made it a few times and it was a hit all the time with my guests. I would recommend using young baby spinach rather that bigger leaves for a nicer, more delicate presentation and taste.

Very good. I did not have truffle oil, but I did have truffle butter and added it at the end. It made the dish, imo.

I had never used truffle oil before and it was expensive but well worth it. Everyone loved it and was a hit. This will be one of my signature vegetable dishes.

This recipe is easy, flavorful and maintains the fresh taste of the ingredients. This simple go-to dish is quick to make and looks great on the plate. I've been asked to share the recipe often.

I'm ambivalent. Truffle oil is so expensive and goes rancid so quickly, you'd be eating it every night of the week to get your money's worth. So, the fact that this got tagged "on a budget" is kinda funny. But, what the frak. Say you've got the oil lying around the house. This is a pretty good use of it, but I feel needs to be paired with a more snappy main. We had it with pork saltimbocca, which worked.

Yummy. Even the non-vegetable people in my family loved it. The addition of the truffle oil is what makes the dish.

This was a great side. I used a 9 oz bag of spinach and an 8 oz package of mushrooms and that was perfect for 2 of us. Used chives since the grocery store was out of shallots. Will definitely make it again.

Very nice. Coupled it with the Pecan Mushroom burgers and they herb potatoes and it was one heck of a meal.

I would like to preface this review by saying this is the ONLY dish on this ENTIRE website that I have taken the time to review. That, in and of itself, should tell you my one description of this dish: UN-freaking-believable. I have never loved a recipe as I love this one, and have never gotten the rave reviews (about a spinach dish, no less) that I have recieved for this dish. My only comment is to eyeball the truffle oil (and I prefer black truffle oil over white for this dish) and to make sure you dont over-saturate the spinach with the oil--since it is already buttered up, there is a propensity for greasiness but just watch it and you will have the most aromatic lovely succulent dish EVER.

This is a sumptuous recipe - I could eat it everyday! It is also sensational tucked into an omelette!

This was the highlight of our dinner. Make sure to get a really good truffle oil- I prefer using the one from Oil and Vinegar. it is worth the splurge-- aromatic and wonderful. Next time I may try white truffle oil, but this was a big hit. make sure to clean the criminis quite well.

This has to be one of my new all-time favorite vegetable side dishes. It was worth the splurge on truffle oil. I could eat this for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

I made this recipe exactly as written and really enjoyed it. I wasnt expecting to really taste the truffle oil, but it makes the dish. I plan on trying it with shitake mushrooms next time.

Great flavor and so easy to make. I added some fresh minced garlic and next time I will use more mushroom.

A great side dish. It's quick and easy. I used two packages of sliced baby bellas and four 5 oz containers of organic baby spinach. I substituted 3 cloves of minced garlic for the shallot. Be sure and cook the mushrooms really well until they brown and all of the liquid is gone. I've made this twice for dinner parties and it's been a hit.

Button mushrooms were on hand so they were used. All the other ingredients and procedure were as the recipe directed, and there just was not anything special about the taste. In fact, it was kinda bland. I might try doing something like this again (as I really like sauteed greens), but would consider adding some garlic, possible parmesan cheese, or sauteed slivered almonds or a sprinkle of nutmeg. But I definitely would not waste the mushrooms and spinach doing the recipe as is again.

I thought this was a good recipe, simple to do and the truffle oil was a good match with the spinach. I may not have sauteed the mushrooms long enough, since I thought the dish was a little soggy. Definitely think it is worth trying again.
