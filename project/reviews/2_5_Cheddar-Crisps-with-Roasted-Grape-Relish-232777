I liked the relish, but it didn't get a lot of love from my friends. Since it's a party recipe, and most people don't love it, I doubt I'll make the relish again. But the crisps were a big hit with everyone. I'll make them again.

My gifted cooking buddy made the relish for a party last week and it was exceptional. Sweet, salty and surprising from the orange zest.I will make it often.

On the advice of other cooks, I skipped the grape relish and filled the crisps with roasted red pepper walnut spread. They tasted like "those fancy deli cheese twists" according to my husband, and the guests at my Oscars party gobbled up two batches of them. However, the crisps were a lot of work for something that tastes like crackers from the store.

The small crisps were nothing but FABULOUS. Since I didn't have the ingredients for the grape relish, I filled them with homemade peperonata (bell peppers, mushrooms, red onion, garlic, olives, capers, etc.)...it was to die for ! Can't wait to find another idea for the filling ! What a wonderful recipe !!!

I thought this recipe was fabulous. I've made it twice, the second time with seedless black grapes which made for a better more colorful presentation. I would recommend that you double the recipe for the cheddar crisps, and just hand press them into flat 'chips', otherwise the relish falls right off the puffed muffin-like forms. But I love this sweet/olive sharp cheddar combination!

The relish was such a weird combination and an awful lot of chopping for such a marginal result. I really wanted to like it! I just served it to 30 people and about 2 tablespoonsful were consumed.

I loved this. I thought the relish was the best part, and apparently so did my husband, because he ate about half the relish recipe before I could get it into the crisps!

Creating this recipe taught me to follow my instincts when first reading a recipe...if a flavour combination sounds like it wouldn't taste appealing, it probably won't. I made this as an appetizer for a special dinner for my mom and sister. The cheddar crisps were fun and I would make them again, but with a more appropriate topping, like a slice of proscuitto. The grapes were just too sweet to combine with the savory ingredients, especially the green olives. I suggest using the cheddar crisps warm out of the oven with a tasty mediterranean inspired spread on top.

Took this appetizer to a party and recieved rave reviews. I served with this Tostido Scoops as well as the cheddar crisps as the crisps turned out very small.

I made this for a small dinner party and, unfortunately, I was the only person out of four who liked it. All agreed that the cheddar crisps were good, but didn't like the combination that made up the filling. I compromised and gave it 2 forks, but wouldn't make it again. Still, the roasted grapes in olive oil, salt and pepper were fantastic and I'll definitely be using them in another dish-- tossed into a salad or maybe a risotto milanese just prior to serving?
