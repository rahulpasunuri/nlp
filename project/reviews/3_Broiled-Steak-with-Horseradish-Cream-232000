It took the steak longer to cook but this is a dummy proof recipe that I made for a first attempt at cooking.

I used rib-eyes, but the final result was excellent. The horseradish sauce is wonderful.

Loved this!!!! The sour cream toned down the kick of the horseradish (added a squeeze of lemon too). This was a quick dinner that tasted like restaurant fare!

I thought this was delicious, and I consider myself a "steak purist." No one is telling you to drown every bite in sauce but it's there for you when you want it!

Some of us get insecure at times...The sauce saves the day if you overcook the steak.

No steak should suffer like this. A good steak does not need any sauce. Pass this one by or make it with out sauce.

Does someone really need a recipe to make this? This seems like something you could easily make without instructions.

The sauce was just okay - not worth it. A great steak usually doesn't need sauce, anyway.

Try adding about a quarter cup of your favorite mayo. It makes a thicker sauce and is great for leftover sandwiches.

OK, I have nothing against chip dip or steak ... but this sounds like steak with dip. Probably doesn't taste bad, but it isn't much of a recipe.

This is great served as an appetizer. We sliced the steak into thin pieces and put it onto crostini with the sauce on top (or under the steak). Very good!

This was simple and delicious. Made the horseradish cream per the recipe but, after tasting, added more horseradish to our liking. Garnished the cream with minced chives which added nice flavor. This was great for a quick meal, but it would be perfect for company too.
