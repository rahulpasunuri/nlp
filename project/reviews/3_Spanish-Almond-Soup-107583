I doubled the whole recipe except for the saffron and water; i put in about 1/8 tsp saffron and 3 cups water. Adding the saffron about 10 mins before serving helped the flavor a lot. I will definitely make this again.

Following the suggestion of another cook, I used sourdough bread. It was great! I've never made anything quite like this soup, but it was wonderful.

I had this dish as a child living in Spain, and still make it. Less saffron, sherry itslef instead of sherry vinegar--up to two tablespoons for taste then heat to drive off alcohol. And for the grittiness, put through blender or food processer until somewhat smooth, then strain through a fine sieve, and process just the chunks again with a little liquid. Sieve again. This is faster by far than doing the whole batch until smooth. The excess liquid actually slows the process of blending.

A sad waste of saffron (better used in paella) and hard to believe it's a standard recipe in Spain. I love almonds and saffron but this was a bit gritty and tasted awful.

This soup had a really strange flavor - maybe too much saffron. We really didn't care for it and didn't even eat it.

I may do this again if only to use leftover blanched almonds and try to spice it up. It was nice, but I agree that it would probably benefit from a little noix muscat and a lot of pepper. And maybe actual sherry rather than sherry vinegar. I'll see...

Oakland, CA took the words right out of my mouth, it's exactly how I feel too about this soup. I am now going to delete it from my "recipe box".

I was intrigued by this unique recipe, but in the end, it was just o.k. My husband agreed. It was interesting, but having it once was enough. We won't be making it again.

This is an absolutely great soup. The smell of the cooking saffron and garlic is intoxicating, but it's the flavor of saffron with the almonds that makes the soup a four fork instead of just three. My only complaint at first making was that the recipe wasn't big enough. I remedied that the second time around.

Excellent. Different. Nutty and flavorful, but simple and elegant. I agree, you have to process or blend it for a long time to get it smooth. But a little texture in it didn't seem to hurt it any. Use FRESH blanched almonds and a good quality chicken stock for maximum depth of flavor.

You really need to blend this to get it smooth - otherwise it is gritty. The next time I make it, I'm going to make some minor changes. I'm going to add a little more saffron, cut back on the water and garlic and add a little nutmeg. It needs a little extra spice to bring it out I think.
