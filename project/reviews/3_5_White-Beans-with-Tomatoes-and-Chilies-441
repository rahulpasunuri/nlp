I made this recipe as written and found it pretty dull. However, after adding some white balsamic vinegar, crispy pancetta and grated parmesan, it was fantastic. I served it at a dinner party and got several requests for the recipe.

This is delicious! Such a great mix of flavors. We will make it again and again, maybe even a bit hotter.

I have a sage plant that goes nuts, and am always looking for something different to do with the herb. This recipe was unbelievably quick and easy, and made a great light supper just by itself with side of the sage honey cornbread which I also found on this site. The combination of pickled jalapenos and sage sounded quite strange, but tasted great. I did not have crushed tomatoes, but had whole canned tomatoes, which I then mashed and used, turned out wonderful. I made it 2 nights in a row! Husband was a big fan as well.

Easy, quick meal. Nice combination of flavors. I serve with corn bread and a salad.

Personally, I don't like the combination of chilies and sage.

This has become a real staple for me - it's super fast and easy, and delicious. I use 3 15 oz. cans of beans, 1 28 oz. can of Muir Glen organic tomatoes (by far the best), fresh jalapenos instead of canned (vary amount depending on the heat of the pepper) and 2 tablespoons of olive oil instead of one. But these changes all make only subtle differences - the recipe as it stands is excellent. Tastes like much more work than it is.
