Great standby recipe in summer. Simple but sophisticated. I add 1/2 tsp of dry mustard and 1/2 tsp of sugar for more heat/sweet combo. This makes enough dressing for 4 servings. Excellent mopping up if you eat it with crusty bread. Yum!

Delicious! I like to use halved cherry tomatoes and bocconcini mozzarella and mix it altogether to make a salad. This is especially delicious with reduced balsamic vinegar syrup. Yum!

I used 1:1 ratio with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Also, sprinkled salt and pepper. Delicious!

yummy! a tad bit sweet, but could have been because I cut the vinegar in half, but kept the rest of the ingredients the same. used halved cherry tomatoes, ciliengini mozzarella "balls" and lots of chiffonade basil.

Excellent dish! Served with rustic bread on the side so guests could soak up dressing as one other reviewer suggested. This salad was gone in minutes.

I used two tomatoes and cut the tomatoes and the mozzarella into irregular chunks. I then tossed the whole thing together lightly, as opposed to drizzling. I really liked the combination of flavors, especially the very faint bite from the mustard. It's worth spending more money on the ingredients, it pays off in the end. The whole crew loved it!

marvelous, simple and the garlic it what makes it just a little bit different. I've been making this since it was first published in Gourmet in 1995.

so easy & delicious! increased to 2 tbs oil for taste but made more than enough dressing for 3 tomatoes. served 5 & was gone in seconds. definitely a keeper!

Absolutely delicious. Ratio of basalmic to oil was too tart for us; used 1:1 and it was perfect for our tastes. Added a few red onion rings and served with wedges of cheese ciabatta to soak up dressing. Will be fixing again tonight for company!

We prepared this salad for an "Italian Night" celebration for friends to reminisce about a recent trip to Italy. It was a big hit! I added toasted pine nuts and was very pleased with the result.

I made this recipe for the first time today just as it was written. I think what's missing in the directions is that they did not reduce the vinaigrette. Reduce blasamic to half then add rest of ingredients. Then drizzle over the tomato and mozzarella. I will definitely make again.

I've made this several times over the past year for picnics; people love it and ask for the recipe. I make it exactly as written and people always use the generous quantity of vinaigrette for dipping bread.

Delicious! Best with fresh mozzarella. The recipe does make quite a bit of vinaigrette, but I find the ratio perfect; perhaps it is the qualtiy of the balsamic vinegar. A staple during the Summer in our home!

Makes way too much vinaigrette. Would cut by half. As well, found the end result too acidic. Mixed balsamic and olive oil in 2:1 ratio -- worked for me.

Yum! Fresh mozarella and fresh basil are absolutely necessary. Use these along with ripe tomatoes and you can't miss.

The fresher the ingredients, the better this salad will taste. I also used honey instead of sugar, and it was lovely. The ratio of oil to vinegar is correct, as this is a vinegarette.

A great recipe,altho I played with it a little, I dice my tomatoes and mozzerella and and some red cooking wine to taste into the vinegar/oil mixture, and instead of sugar, I use 1 packet of splenda. I also have taken to adding some whole wheat pasta to make it more of a meal, it's SO GOOD!!!

I have made versions of this salad many times for parties, and it always gets rave reviews. This is the first time I have made it with a dressing and I will do so again. It was delicious. I used honey instead of sugar. I don't like oily dressings, so I thought the vinegar / oil ratio was great.

i adore this recipe. it is so fresh and blends the textures so nicely that it is delicious even if you don't really like tomatoes. and the simple elegance of the dish initiates the meal perfectly with guests. this is the kind of recipe that makes one feel like you have learned something about the importance of simplicity and quality ingredients.

I tweeked it some using chunked tomatoes and cubed mozzarella. Great recipe though, my friends loved it.

Rating: 3
Delicious but I made some changes. Instead of doing sliced tomatoes, I quartered cherry tomatoes and cut the mozzarella into chunks. I also halved some kalamata olives to add a briny flavor, and cut the balsamic vinegar in half. I will make this again, with the above changes.

This is a fabulous recipe--one of my favorites on the whole site!!! I've been making it for two years now, for both large dinner parties (recipe requests every time) and just as normal weeknight fare and we have yet to tire of it. The only modification I've made is to double the garlic. It gives it a little extra kick and counterbalances the balsamic vinegar a little bit.

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful dish--everytime I make it everyone asks for the recipe. I usually double the dressing and use grape (or cherry) tomatoes(cut in half) and also cut the fresh mozzarella into bite size pieces and then toss with the dressing. It makes a great side dish when served this way!

Dressing is really good. I would also use it on a mixed green salad.

I have tried many recipes for this salad but this was my families favorite. I used a little more olive oil than the recipe called for. The dressing keeps well so I always double the recipe.

At first I considered taking a shortcut and using a good bottled dressing. Based upon the reviews though, I decided to make the vinaigrette. Am I ever glad I did, it was fantastic!! Thanks for such an easy, delicious recipe.

The dressing is out of this world! Definitely ONLY use the fresh mozzarella that you can buy at an Italian deli (not grocery store). It's far superior. And with a wonderful dressing such as this, you wouldn't want to use it on anything less.

I am always trying new tomato recipes. I find they all differ in the ratio of oil to vinegar. This one was great eventhough it was very high in vinegar...so don't let it scare you off. My guests must of felt the same way since they devoured the entire tray! I have since made a large batch and keep it onhand in the fridge.

This is the best recipe for a Mozzarella/Tomato Sald I've encountered; I've made it over 50 times, and it never fails to be a hit. Use only fresh mozzarella from a deli. The dressing can be made in about 30 seconds in a mini-processor.

This was excellent, but I was out of dry mustard, so I substituted that with 1/4 teaspoon of dried red pepper flakes and it gave it a wonderful added bite to it, without being overpowering.

I go to Italy every month, and the traditional Salad Caprese that is mentioned in another review is served with only a good olive oil. This is a nice twist with the Balsamic vinegar and mustard and I will try this again! Thank you for the variation on the tradition! KIMBER

I first experienced this salad in Capri, Italy (called Insalata Caprese) and longed for it when I got back to the States. So far this is the best version I have found. As other reviewers have mentioned, use fresh mozzarella - the prepackaged mozzarella in the cheese section just won't do. I also loved the high vinegar content; balsamic vinegar is just sooo good, why taint it with oil? Don't skimp on the basil - it adds so much flavor.

Rating: 4
Get really flavorful tomatoes and this is delicious. In contrast with some of the other reviews, I like the high proportion of vinegar to oil. I find too many vinaigrettes bland and/or too oily. So, I tried the recipe as written and loved it. For a really nice presentation, I alternated slices of red and yellow tomato in a ring around the edge of the plate and then heaped small balls of fresh mozarella in the middle.

Reading the other comments, I changed the Vinegar-Oil ratio to half and half. Aside from that, I was very pleased with the results. A great summer dish with Jersey tomatoes.

I found this salad's dressing to be too acidic. To follow up on the note from the Raleigh, NC, cook, I would reverse the quantities of oil and vinegar when making the recipe again.

A nice version of a classic. However, aren't the quantities of oil and vinegar swapped?? I have always mixed 3 parts oil to 1 part vinegar...

A quick, fresh, tasty summer appetizer. Make sure all the ingredients are fresh, especially the cheese!

My two sisters and I just returned from a week long stay in Tuscany, Italy. We enjoyed caprese (tomatoes, mozzarella cheese and balsamic vinegar with olive oil) pretty much at every lunch and dinner. The cheese must be the very fresh, very white, soft variety. This recipe beats every tasting we had. My gourmet dining group of 88 will be serving this as a first course in eight different homes this fall. Our main course will be grilled veal chops, mashed potatoes with rosemary butter and asparagus. Do try if you haven't. You'll be delighted and so will your guests.
