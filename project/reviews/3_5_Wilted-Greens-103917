This was so quick, healthy & delicious. I used 1/2 butter 1/2 olive oil and sauteed a shallot and 2 cloves of garlic for about 5 minutes before I added the chard. I made it last week and already have had requests for it again. This is definitely getting added to my normal veggie rotation.

I did this with olive oil instead of butter and like others, added some chopped garlic at the beginning. Very tasty; more flavorful than spinach!

Perfect side to so many dishes. I might omit the mustard greens in the future or make one dish with and one without. They were a bit too bitter for some.

I really liked this recipe but modified it slightly by adding minced garlic (4 cloves) and onion (1 medium sized) to melted butter. Let the mixure of onion and garlic sit on the medium heat for 10 minutes until it gets slightly gold in color. I find that it adds to the flavor . Instead of disposing stems from swiss chard, I cut stems into small pieces and add those a few minutes before adding leaves. That way, stems are not to hard to bite and leaves are not overcooked. It extends the cooking time but it is worth it.

Easy and very tasty. I was looking for an alternative to steamed spinach, so that is the only green I used. I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil. I also added some minced garlic, a splash of balsamic vinegar and some pine nuts. It might sound like I hardly followed the recipe, but I think it shows how versatile this dish can be. I particularly liked how you could toss the greens and wilt as much as desired, unlike steaming spinach where it all wilts completely. This was more flavorful too.

Wonderful! I made it with homemade turkey broth and endive (cored and chopped) and spinach. Easy and full of flavor. Highly recommended.

Easy and delicious. Add chopped garlic to the butter and let cook for a minute before adding the remainder of the ingredients. Used Swiss chard and turnip greens. Great flavor. Served with Grilled Salmon with Balsamc Glaze and Saffron Orzo.

Have made this several times using just mustard greens and it was outstanding. We love greens, broccoli rabe being a mainstay, so this was a welcome addition!

Tasty and so healthy, early spring and fall garden greens make the very affordable for company and family. This is when you care about health of your loved ones.

This recipe was excellent with sauteed garlic. I served it as an accompaniment with beef in mustard green peppercorn sauce for an election night dinner. I thought about it the entire next day and have been asked to make it again.
