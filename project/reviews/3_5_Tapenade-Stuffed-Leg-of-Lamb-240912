Delicious. I used a boneless leg of lamb, butterflied it, pounded it to 1/2" thin and tied it. I used the Sundried Tomato and Black Olive Tapenade from this site (with jarred tomatoes in olive oil). Lots of changes but the result was amazing. Will make it again. Don't overcook it! Make sure to let it rest!

This is a wonderful way to serve lamb, especially for guests who are tired of lamb with mint jelly. I made a fresh kalamata olive tapenade for this- very easy to do with a food processor.

Found this to be delicious and easy. Made a tapenade with black and green olives, a couple sundried tomatoes, garlic and fresh thyme, rosemary and parsley. Used about 3/4 cup on lamb, my roast was about 4 lbs. and it was medium rare in an hour.
