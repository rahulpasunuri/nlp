Super-duper easy and really yummy. My 21-month old gobbled it up!

This recipe is relatively easy with a nice out come. I have also used everything from apriocot to pear preserves or a mix of 1/2 preserves & 1/2 cream cheese in place of the cranberry.

Have made this and variations several times. Try fruit preserves in place of cranberry sauce. Try cranberry-maple or blueberry-maple syrup with it. Try stuffing with softened cream cheese in addition to the cranberry sauce or preserves. A real hit.

Simple and good. Could have used more egg/milk.
