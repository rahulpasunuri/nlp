Ridiculously easy tart crust and really good, too. the entire tart is delicious and easy to make. Made for dinner party and every bite was gone...don't know that 10-12 servings is fair...For a nine inch tart I barely got 9 servings out of it and felt like i really skimped folks on dessert.

Fabulous taste with just the right ratio of chocolate to tender crust and the jasmine whipped cream is heavenly. Start making the day before because it takes a lot of time but worth it. The egg mix is the hardest.

I love this tart and it gets raves everytime. If anyone has any shortcuts on preparing the egg to mix with the chocolate advice would be appreciated!

Perfect for taking to a party- you can make it the night before except for the decorating. Everyone devoured it and I got many compliments. Delicious and not too sweet!

The jasmine scented whipped cream was etheral, the citrus-chocolate filling rich and satisfying but not too sweet or cloying. The crust was easy to make. The tart wowed those I served it to.

This is a fast, unfussy, foolproof dessert which NEVER fails to impress. Bittersweet chocolate (at least 70%) is the only way to go and I speed up the melting process using the microwave (put chocolate and butter together before melting). Another tip is to heat the citrus rinds for a few seconds - releases oils and makes flavour more intense. Yummy crowd-pleaser!

This recipe was okay, but could have been better by a long shot. I was not happy with the crust, it was too grainy, and I feel that has something to do with the amount of butter. The filling was excellent, as was the jasmine whipped cream. I highly recommend using a heaping tablespoon of loose-leaf jasmine tea to make it. I'll have to try it again with a different crust.

Very good, especially the crust. Since it wasn't grapefruit season, I doubled the orange peel but found it a little too subtle. Next time I'll try bittersweet chocolate and the grapefruit peel.

This was wonderful! Great crust. Excellent filling, but I doubled it. I think it would be skimpy without doubling the recipe. I didn't bother to strain the filling, and it was great. The jasmine flavor in the whipped cream ws delicate and I may have used more tea next time to ifuse more flavor. Overall this was a big hit.

I've made this tart 3 times now and it has been great every time. Here's a tip for anyone who wants to try a variation: instead of the citrus zest, try cinnamon (1 tsp.) and nutmeg (good pinch). It is fabulous! There were 6 of us at dinner and everyone had 2 pieces. The spices were just the right amount. Will try it with a liqueur next time (Amaretto, Baileys).

Great recipe! My friends and I loved it!

Fabulous! I couldn't find jasmine for love nor money, so I sweetened the whipped cream with some of the citrus-y syrup from the candied peel, came out delicious. The professional chef who was at the table said she thought it was delicious, so there's some validation for you!

This was okay......... I have better recipes but it was different. I could not find any jasmine for the whipped cream so just used plain with a little sugar

So, so decadent! I made this for a Christmas dinner with friends and it was a huge hit, especially for me and a friend who are both chocolate lovers. I used 60% chocolate for it. It was extremely easy to make. Since it was my first time making a tart like this, I wasn't aware that it's better to poke the dough with a fork before baking (the crust puffed up in the oven), but this didn't affect the final result.

Very good!! I used semi-sweet chocolate instead of bittersweet and I made these as mini tarts for a cocktail party I hosted. The filling is very dense so a thin layer is pleasing to the palate. Since the filling is easy to make, and versatile, I will make again in the future!
