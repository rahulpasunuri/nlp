Found this to be a bit bland. Added boullion for more flavor and more flour to thicken. Will use chicken stock next time. Just had a bowl for lunch - gotta say, better the next day! Family did love it!

Such a yummy, flavorful soup! Following earlier comments, I added a cube of mushroom bullion to the water. I also omitted onion. I would highly recommend this soup, just realize how much fat you are signing yourself up for. Other recipes discard the bacon strips, but this one keeps them. I think next time I will try one of the other stewed chicken recipes for a healthier alternative. Still, it was very, very good.

I love this dish. I have made it several times and it is always a hit. I add extra carrots and use 3-4 cups of chicken broth as substitute for the water. I also add a little minced garlic but that is optional. I have used leftover ham though the salt pork lends a creaminess to the dish. While it is not a heavy gravy stew, it has a richness that goes great with a good salad, sourdough bread & butter. Great rainy day dish.

I had a completely different experience with this recipe. Came out more like a soup with potted chicken. Really nothing 'stew-ish' about it. Followed the directions to the letter...the boullion would have definitely helped and I probably should have added more flour to thicken the broth.

Not sure why this recipe does not have more reviews and accolades. Maybe those who enjoyed it (like me) did not leave a review. This is a great year-round comfort food dish. I have made it before and plan to serve it for a committee meeting this week.

The recipe is very easy to follow and prepare. I added chicken bouillon cubes in with the water addition. I served it with a salad and good italian bread. It makes a filling summer meal.
