Made this 5 times. First when it came out in the spring of 1992 for my son's christening luncheon. Always been great and has sentimental value. Take a bit of extra time to thin and even out the lamb so that it rolls up better. The sauce is a bit fussy but worth it. I think the combo of the lamb, strong feta, garlic, rosemary and chard is perfect. My signature dish.

Delish! Made this with a rack of lamb instead of the leg. Went rustic (read: lazy) with the sauce...I left the onions in, used a fresh spring of rosemary, and a pat of butter at the end instead of cornstarch.

First time making lamb; decided to try an inexpensive shank instead of a $25 leg for 2 people. That is probably the only regret. I am not very experienced and did a poor job at boning and trimming. The meat had a lot of grissel. The flavor was great and I really liked the swiss chard and feta!

Made this last night & it was amazing!

It was good but not great. I think a leg of lamb with simple garlic, rosemary, olive oil and salt/pepper is actually better. Would not spend the time or money to make again.

I'm going to try this for this Easter. Sounds wonderful, I'm just worried about presentation based on some of the reviews.

I have made this recipe every Easter for the last 5 years. It is always a big hi! It is so easy to make; although the first time rolling it up was a bit daunting! Definitely prep the night before, and you'll have an enjoyable day and a fabulous meal!!

This is quite good but wow is the cooking time off. i had a smaller roast than the recipe (about 3.5 lbs.) and it took about 2.5 hours to get to exactly 140 degrees. the good news is that it was perfectly done at that point. it does fall apart and make a mess, so don't plan on a beautiful presentation.

Great taste and fairly easy to put together. We served this with the spiced quinoa which tasted really good.

Easy dish and so tasty!

Delicious and easy. I used frozen leaf spinach which cut out a lot of the prep time. A definate winner. I love lamb and cook it often, but this was probably the best roast, that I've prepared so far. The family loved it so much that unfortunately there were no leftovers!!

This is an excellent recipe. The meat was medium rare, tender, and extremely flavorful. I did not have swiss chard, so I substituted spinach for it. I used fat-free feta, and it worked very well. Since I was out of beef broth, I used chicken broth and a bit of "fond de veau". The sauce was delicious. My husband prepared the spiced quinoa that is suggested as an accompaniment. Delicious with the lamb! Cutting the roast, even after it had rested for a while, was a bit of a challenge. I was able to have some nice slices at the beginning, but things started falling apart after a while. This is the only reason I may hesitate to make this again for company. A definite repeat for family though!

This was the BEST leg of lamb EVER! A little time consuming , but worth it. Timing is critical! Use your therometer!!

This recipe is so easy and a huge hit. Made it for Easter and everyone was lapping it up. My boyfriend begs me to make this dish all the time. Just be sure to use greek feta-french feta is a little soft and doesn't hold up so well in the heat.

I made this yesterday for Easter dinner, and it turned out great. I used a 8 lb boneless leg of lamb, and it was still perfect, all of my guests loved it. The only alteration I made to the recipe was that when I put the lamb in the oven, I turned the broiler on for the first 10 minutes of cooking to get the lamb nice and crunchy on the outside, but otherwise I cooked it according to the recipe. The 20 minutes per pound to get it to medium rare wasn't exactly accurate -- mine was medium well with plenty of time to spare, next time I'll start checking the temperature after about an hour (I like it much more pink in the middle).

I have been making this recipe since it first appreared in Gourmet. I also use the same stuffing on pork. the presentation is beautiful.

This was also my first time making lamb, and I was pretty pleased with the results. The feta/chard filling was just aggressive enough to stand up to the strongly flavored lamb, and I found the roasting time to be about right. I pounded the butterflied leg a little to even it out, but rolling it was still challenging. It was well worth the effort. I think that next time I'll play with the sauce a little, as I found it to be missing some small element that would have garnered this recipe a fourth star. Perhaps it might be as simple as using a different red wine or beef broth. I was looking for a hint more sweetness in the sauce to counter the feta, which might be accomplished by using an off-dry red instead. Perhaps a touch of port to the reduction would have done it. Also, I think calling for dried rosemary is always a bad idea. Use fresh. In any case, I was very happy with my first leg of lamb, and will certainly try this again.

absolutely fabulous I will definetly make again, I did substitutye spinach instead of chard and added sundried tomatoes,rosemary too! slivered garlic throughout lamb and was "one of my best meals yet" says my husband. added extra cornstarch for sauce and pureed the onions for a little more thickness was wonderful!

Very good dish and easy to make. The cooking time in the recipe will vary depending on the thickness of the meat, so watch carefully!

This dish is pretty impressive for the effort required. I bought a 6 pound leg and had it boned boned, when stuffed it weighed 4.5 pounds. Should have been done in 90 minutes by the calculation in the recipe, but after almost 2 hours was still pretty rare in the center. I think if it had been more done, the slices would have held together better and looked even better. We loved it, the sauce was a bit thin, but I would definitely make it again, with adaptations to correct the problems noted above.

Easy to make and so delicious! Took 2 1/2 hours to cook 4-5 pound roast.

I made this on Sunday, and though it was okay, I found that the stuffing had too bitter of a flavor for me. I did like the combination of the feta and chard, but thought that stuffing looked unattractive when it slid out, upon slicing. The sauce was tasty (especially because I made it with lamb broth from the lamb leg bone), but very, very thin. Nice, but next time I'll make something different.

We have enjoyed this dish on several occasions. When I could not find Swiss chard, I have used collard greens or spinach; the Swiss chard is the best, however. Also, I have added toasted pignoli.

This recipe is fabulous. I was a little nervous having never cooked lamb before but it turned out great. Couldn't find "Swiss" chard so used regular chard. Also had problems with cooking time. Took much longer than recipe suggested.

Truly restaurant quality. Took much longer to cook than recipe stated, however. (double or triple what the recipe called for) The gravy/sauce was delicious. I used fresh,wilted,baby spinach instead of swiss chard. WONDERFUL!!

This was the best leg of lamb I've ever had. I stuffed it the night before for Easter dinner,it made it very easy the next day. I put it in my rotisserie and it came out wonderful!!

We made this entire menu for a recent "Gourmet Dinner Club" at it was fabulous! And the timbales with the lamb was extra good. I highly recommend this lamb dish and it was very easy to prepare.

Great. Family and guests all loved it. Sauce is easy and very good. I will use more feta next time, but won't change anything else.

This is a wonderful dish, I would certainly serve it again. We had it with a shiraz which was good, but would have been even better with a big, bold zinfandel.

have made this recipe no less than 8 times, every time it turns out perfectly. Use the gravy for all other lamb dishes

This is a wonderful recipe. The rosemary and red wine reduction sauce tasted even better after a day or two with the leftovers. I will definitely make it again.

This was fantastic. I omitted the swiss chard and replaced it with 1/2 cup chopped sun dried tomatoes in oil and 1/2 cup chopped black olives. Very flavorful!!! I bit hard to roll up, but worth the effort.
