Made this as an appetizer. Used smaller flatbread rounds. I was bringing to a party, so I prepared it as written and baked it until it was barely done. Then finished cooking it at the party - for another 5 minutes or so. Then put the toppings on, etc. Awesome.

I used a pre-made, whole wheat flatbread crust as well, so that really helped cut down on time. We absolutely loved it so much, I'm bringing it to a dinner party this weekend.

I love this pizza. It is a quick and flavorful meal for the weeknight. I use a pre-made crust which cuts the baking time down to 10-12 minutes. I don't use olives as the recipe suggests.

This is a flatbread, not a pizza. It is good, not great, and I think that I will find a better use for smoked salmon. There are so many great pizza recipes at Epicurious that there is no reason to bother with this again.

Ooohhh so delicious. I made this slightly differently - Trader Joes whole wheat pizza dough, very thin layer of homemade parsely pesto, crumbled goat cheese, fresh dill sprinkling, smoked salmon flakes, carmelized onion slices, then bake for 10 minutes at 425. I made them up a couple hours in advance and then baked right before serving a party and they were devoured!

Easy and quick to make. Light as well, too. Will definitely make again.

This was quick and easy, made more delicious by adding pine nuts. Have made this using both feta and goat cheese, turns out great with either!

It was probably a 3 fork for us, but if I had done it right it would have been a 4 fork. Used a prepared crust (first time ever), because I was in a hurry. It was better than expected! Goat cheese at my normal store is $1/oz.! I replaced half with cream cheese. I do not like olives, so replaced with them with capers. Olives on all but my part, plus the capers all over, would have been better. For a side, use very thinly sliced cucumbers soaked in 1/2 salt water and 1/2 white vinegar. Do not peel, and score the skins with a fork before slicing. Drain just before serving, and serve icy cold.

I loved this as did my guests. I would make it again but would cut down on the cheese. I contemplated adding capers in lieu of the olives and was glad that I didn't. The olives really gave a wonderful flavor.

I had a ready made pizza crust on hand, so I used it instead (it only takes 8-10 minutes in the oven). I added the salmon and olives and very thin slices of tomato for the last minute in the oven (just to take the chill off the salmon), then sprinkled the remaining dill. Wonderful with champagne!!

The combination of goat cheese, dill, and salmon is wonderful. I make this recipe into tiny little individual pizzas for my guests to enjoy. I love this recipe!

I thought this was delicious!! I also added some capers and pine nuts to it before cooking. I've seen in my James McNair's pizza cookbook where he does some very small individual pizzas, (about 2 bites each) and this recipe would be perfect prepared that way for appetizers. Very yummy!!

Very good pizza recipe. Would make it again

This is my husband's all time favorite pizza recipe. I have made it with home made pizza dough that I make in my bread maker because it is easier to incorporate the dill into the dough.
