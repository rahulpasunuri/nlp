The four forks come with a caveat that I modified the recipe a fair amount. This is a lovely dish and was a huge hit with all 4 diners! My husband said it was a 'sexy dinner'. Changes: -cooked in 8 qt. dutch oven -used arborio rice -used hot linguica (puertugues style smoked sausage) b/c spanish style chorizo was unavailable, and used closer to 8 oz. -added 1 can's worth clam juice along with corresponding extra rice -added 2 cans drained chopped clams (stirred in with salt/pepper before second stint in oven) -added 1 small, roughly chopped fresh red bell pepper along with snap peas (in addition to roasted peppers, not in place of them) -cooked for ~5 extra minutes to make sure largest chicken thigh was cooked through -garnished w/ chopped parsley

This was a hit with my family and a wonderful one dish dinner. I used arborio rice, hot Italian sausage and boneless skinless chicken thighs. This will be in the weeknight rotation for sure.

This is a great company dish, simply add more of everything! I add sauteed shrimp and a can of baby clams with the juice--it gives a very nice, complex flavor. To me the saffron makes the difference, I know it's expensive but a little goes a long way. I use baby peas,snap peas can be tough. Also, I just don't agree with the person who said chicken thighs are "nasty" what in the world?? Most chefs prefer the thigh over the breast because of its flavor. You can have pitiful boneless breasts.....

This was DELICIOUS. It took me 2.5 hours, because i'm slow and deliberate, and it was also my first time making it. Some things were changed up a bit, such as the chicken. I told my boyfriend to pull out the chicken thighs from the freezer to thaw, but he pulled out the boneless skinless chicken breasts. I had to make do. So, i chopped up the chicken breasts into chunks and made it that way. But i would have preferred chicken thighs because the meat is so moist. I will make it again with thighs. Also, i've never used chorizo before. Mine turned out to be a mushy, ground beef type of chorizo. But hey, it worked and it added the spice the paella needs. Ultimately, this was so tasty and it lasted awhile for dinner and lunches.

I made this last night and really liked it. It was so easy to prepare. I just made it with chicken since I did not have chorizo on hand and did not want to go to the grocery store just to get one item, but I am sure it will be even better with it. I also think it was be even better to add some shrimp and clams at the end when you add the sugar snap peas. And I also used valenciana rice instead of long grain and it cooked in the same amount of time. Will definitely do it again.

The smoked paprika is key to this recipe in providing its unique flavor. The snap peas were also great, though, I sliced them in 1/4-inch slices. If you can't get mild or Spanish chorizo, I would skip it. The spicy Mexican variety is overpowering and out of place in this dish. No matter what you decide to use, this dish should be a hit. Things that were nice additions - doubled the recipe (except for the chicken) and added 3/4 lb bay scallops, 3/4 lb shelled and de-veined raw shrimp, 1/2 lb cod cut into 1-1/2-inch pieces, 16 mussels, and 2 small split lobster tails. The seafood was added during the last 15 minutes of cooking. It was a nice was to dress up this dish for New Year's Eve.

Very pleasantly surprsed! Changes/additions I made: used boneless chicken breasts because I hadon hand (the chicken thighs would have worked great too), added 1# wild shrimp, a bit over dozen little neck clams and I boiled the shrimps shells in 2C of chicken stock for about 15 mins., which I think made a huge difference plus added additional chicken stock to a bit over a 2:1, stock to rice ratio. The rice was very flavorful and turned out very moist and the rice kernels were tender/firm - in Spanish they use a term "asopao" or "asopado" which means a soupy consistency and that is the way we love our chickenand rice and paella.I think usingthe long grain rice would have made a very dry dish.Everyone LOVED the snap peas added at the end - we ususally use either asparagus spears or baby peas and I will start using the snap peas from now on. Was this the best paella I have ever had ? no, but the whole family really enjoyed it and it had terrific flavor.

This is in my week night rotation, it's that easy. I follow the recipe to a tee, with two exceptions. I use tumeric instead of saffron and I use brown rice. The rice switch adds about 30 minutes cooking time. It's one of my favorite recipes. Highly recommend it.

Easy and really good. I used boneless skinless thighs b/c that's what I had and it turned out great. We have a lot of food allergies around here, including peas, so I used asparagus instead. It was complex enough for the adults and comforting enough that the two year old loved it.

Very good. Times worked for me as written. I added a dozen unpeeled shrimp with the liquid before putting in oven the first time. Total from start to serving was 1hr 15min for me, not rushimg but steady. Satisfied my craving for paella remembered from a trio to Spain a few years back. Will become a staple as it also makes great lunch leftovers!

to the reviewer that thinks chicken thighs are nasty, I would rather cook and eat the soles off my shoes then eat a dry, tasteless chicken breast. What even is worst is a boneless chicken breast

Rating: 2
The taste of smoked paprika was overpowering. Probably that 1/4 teaspoon would be enough. The chicken was not cooked at all after the specified time. I had to remove it, place in another pan and cook for 20 minutes more. This recipe is not that quick to make either. Snap peas were a nice addition.

Overall flavor is very good. We think chicken thighs are nasty, so I subbed boneless skinless chix breast and shrimp. Sauteed them as directed and then added for the last 15 minutes with the snap peas...worked perfectly. I think next time I will use my Le Crueset dutch oven instead of the skillet, as I would prefer a bit lighter and fluffier paella, this was very tasty, but was a bit dense for my taste - just needed more room in the pot.

A huge hit! This was my first attempt at paella and it turned out great! I used sharp paprika that really added some heat.

This was a really nice weekday meal. Do use the smoked paprika (I used hot). With the foil covering the pan and lid on top, I found the rice to be perfectly cooked. The only changes I might make next time would be to halve the sugar snap peas, and serve with a wedge of lime to squeeze over the final product.

Maybe 3.5 forks. As I was serving to kids, who liked it, I cut up the chicken at the 25min-10min break. Also threw in a pound of jumbo shrimp for that last ten minutes (in retrospect 15 mins might be better). There is some work to do on this recipe and while it is "quick" in the sense that it takes about 1/2 the cooking time as other paellas, it is not effortless. Suggestions: Get the smoked Spanish paprika; don't go with normal paprika, as it makes a difference. The other essential here is the snap peas - it is a must in this recipe.

Great recipe and super easy! I made it for a dinner party of 6. Rave reviews! Instead of using cooked chorizo, I bought uncooked and sauteed it in the pan after removing the sausage part from the skin. Then cooked chicken in the fat rendered from the chorizo. Also used boneless, skinless thighs.

This recipe is VERY forgiving!! I came looking for how to feed 8 with 1 lb ground turkey and rice. I decided to see if I could make this work. I had the turkey, 1 inch of a hard salami log, no snow peas (had the tomato, peppers, onion and garlic though), and regular paprika, not smoked. The only wine I had was a very sweet Reisling, not a dry, but used it anyway. I also added some Graham Marsala since I was missing alot of flavor by not having the chorizo. I made it almost the same, but made the rice separate and just poured the meat and spices "broth" over it. Fabulous!!! Everyone went back for seconds! This is certainly a recipe you can customize and alter to use what you've got!

Excellent and easy! I added mussels and shrimp along with the snap peas in the last 10 minutes, and used Marguez sausage rather than Chorizo. Other than that, followed the directions and it turned out wonderfully and required very little prep work!

love this! It's pretty quick for such a substantial meal. Flavors are pretty good as is, but it's also a great base recipe to build off of. I've made twice as is and now tonight I'm going to try adding mussels, shrimp and squid for more of a seafood paella.

Very nice! I substituted 8 oz clam juice for some of the chicken stock. I also added 8 oz. of medium shrimp when the peas were added. The pea's really make this dish.

I liked the recipe quite well. Followed it to a t - however, I too had trouble with the cooking time for the rice. It took almost twice as long to cook until tender.

Very tasty. Made the following changes: used boneless chicken, rubbed with cajun spice; omitted the tomato (mostly because i forgot to add it); added fresh red and green pepper, button mushrooms, and broccoli. We gobbled it all up!

I made this exactly according to the recipe and it was delicious (and the house smells great). There is a lot of leftover rice; I will add some shrimp to that for leftover lunches.

Hearty weeknight meal. Made it Monday night and ate it for lunch for the rest of the week. Omitted saffron and sausage because I didn't have any, but the white wine and paprika carried it. Snap peas were PHENOMENAL. Very happy with overall flavor. Next time, I think I'll try to put more vegetables in it. Maybe some fresh corn?

I found this recipe by accident, as it was a news feed on MSN. I didn't think a lot of it by reading it. But I made it tonight, and was blown away by its flavors. I added a couple things, like red onion and mussels. But the flavors were very well balanced, the chicken was exceptionally well cooked and moist. The rice was great, and the sugar snap peas, were cooked and crisp. I paired it with an inexpensive Multipulciano, and was very impressed with the flavors. Though, I'd say its not like a paella, it was really very good and both myself an my fiancee, raved about the taste. And we are not easily impressed with online recipes. Great job.

I'm not sure if it was because my skillet was subpar or my oven is ancient, but the rice came out almost uncooked after carrying out the recipe to the letter. I would recommend fidgeting with the time depending on those two factors.

Perfect for a quick but substantial dinner. We substituted a whole cut up chicken for the chicken thighs (No thighs at the store! Bunch of savages in this town.), and the chicken was still nicely cooked. We also substituted andouille for the chorizo. This is one of those recipes that is ideal for working day cooking, as it can accommodate quite a bit of altering to suit the ingredients that are available. The snap peas are a great addition. I would never have added them to a dish like this on my own, but their crispness adds a nice dimension. Is it paella? Probably not, but it certainly is tasty.

I am not impressed with this recipe. even though I added 2 slices of bacon with the chorizo, added fresh thyme, some oregano, and some crawfish, it is still lacking flavor. Husband loved the snap peas... I will be looking for a different recipe.

Followed the directions just as written and it came out well. The smoked paprika rub really does taste great and I really like being able to do all the cooking in one large pan, it makes the clean up a lot easier.

Great quick Paella. I used boneless chicken breast cooking it as indicated except I only put in in the oven for the last 10 minutes with the peas. Saffron flavor was quite intense so next time I might cut back slightly. It might be possible to make this in a crockpot - just an idea

Excellent and potentially versatile! We made this into basically a Jambalaya by substituting andouille sausage and anatto powder for the saffron. Homemade chicken stock was on hand, too.

This was a really fabulous quick paella - The chicken turned out perfectly, as did the rice and sugar snap peas, which I was a little worried about being over/undercooked. I highly recommend this for an afterwork meal, as it took only 1 hour from start to finish, and most was spent sitting on my bum listening for the ktichen timer.

Excellent recipe. Have made the traditional paella recipe but found this one fun and easy. Added Prawns towards the end and since my chorizo crumbled, I added sliced Chicken Apple sausage. Flavors in this recipe are fantastic, quick, easy to prepare and with only one pot, clean-up was easy, Sugar Snap peas added a nice texture and taste. Definitely plan on making this again and again.

I made this recipe exactly as written. However, this is basically arroz con pollo. I thought the addition of smoked paprika and roasted red peppers (I used Trader Joe's Roasted Piquillo Peppers)would jazz it up, but it didn't. The rice was nicely yellow from the saffron threads, and it tasted good, but it was not outstanding.

Made pretty much as written. A few comments. First, I think you have to go with the smoked paprika - it really does define the taste of the chicken. Second, using the exact cooking times and methods provided, I found the rice to be a little undercooked. I would increase the liquid (add 1/2c of stock) and increase the cooking time by maybe 10 minutes. Overall, the dish is quite good, although I am sure there are many Spaniards rolling over in their graves reading some of these ingredients. Snap peas? But it works. Doesn't get the 4 forks because this is kind of a very good workday meal, but it doesn't have the wow factor I need for four forks.

Delicious! I made the recipe as written with just a few minor adjustments: I used skinless chicken thighs (they were still very moist when cooked) and I omitted the salt from the rub, seasoning the dish to taste when I added the peas. (I'm certain I used far less than the 1 1/2 tsp the recipe called for). I also made a vegan version for my daughter, replacing the sausage and chicken with 3 cups cooked chick peas and using vegetable stock in place of the chicken broth. This version required 1/4 cup extra stock to prevent dryness. Both versions were well received by family.
