One of my favourite quesadilla recipes, I keep a container of the avocado and olive mixture in the fridge and it takes less than 10 minutes to make these. I left out the red pepper and used corn tortillas instead.

This is one of my favorite quesadilla recipes. Changes? I found that the sliced olives kept falling out of the quesadillas, so I now sub about 1/2 small can of chopped olives.

I made this for dinner last night and thought it was just OK. My husband really liked it, so I'm keeping it in my "make again" file. I made this on two large tortillas. Rather than use oil, I just brushed these with water. So, I don't think these crisped as they should have, and ended up really soggy in the middle from the topping; hence, my disappointment. I'll follow the recipe more closely next time, and hopefully will get better results.

Delicious, my guests loved it. I used larger burrito-sized tortillas, and folded them in half with the filling in the middle. Also, used an outdoor gas grill instead, which I find easier than broiling. Used pre-sliced olives to save time, didn't seem to affect the flavor. Very, very tasty.

I hate to be the one to disagree, but I thought the way the recipe was written (without Kalamata olives, and without everyone's changes, that frankly, I'm surprised this was even approved in a test kitchen! BORING!

Delicious, easy and fun to make. I used calamata olives, though I might use a smaller quantity next time since they're so salty. I also omitted the cilantro 'cause I hate it. I don't think the dish was any less flavorful as a result.

This was very easy to make. I used jack cheese with jalapenos instead and added hot sauce for a kick. It was excellent. I'll be making this recipe again.

It was very good and easy to make. I did add chicken to it though. I plan on making it again.
