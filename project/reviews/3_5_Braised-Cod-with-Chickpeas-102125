Good, not great. I would have given it 2 1/2 forks if I could. I halved the recipe but used the full spice measurements as some had suggested it was too bland and it was a bit too spicy. I will try it again and with the spices toned down. The chickpeas were delicious but hot.

We frequently make this dish as a quick one-pot weekday meal. If you cook the chickpeas in an oven safe skillet (with a little extra water or broth, it'a an easy transition to the oven. We also add some chopped dates or currants for a little sweetness and up the cumin for mor smokiness. I just made it for my 80-somthing year-old grandmother -- who keeps kosher -- and she said she'd make it again herself. That's pretty high praise comming from her.

We did a slight variation. We combined all the ingredients including lemon (& zest) and fresh coriander to a sauce pan, doubled up the liquid using an organic vegetable broth. We added the fish after 15min and steamed it fo 12min. Fantastic!

This recipe did nothing for me. Followed to the letter but no sale.

I thought this was yummy--would not have thought to pair chickpeas with fish, but liked it, and it is easy to make.

My guests loved this recipe-- though out of fear of blandness as described by others, I decided to "marinate" the Cod for about 6 hours (of course, there was no acid in the marinade since I did not want the fish to prematurely cook itself). The marinade made a great impact on the flavor of the fish, and it was very simple: In a broad bowl, I mixed: 1/2 onion, finely chopped | 1-2 cloves garlic, finely chopped | 1/3 cup finely chopped parsley | 1/8 cup extra virgin olive oil | Several table spoons of salt and pepper (2-5) | Slather the cut portions of Cod in the mixture. Place them flat in a large, zip-top freezer bag. Pour excess "marinade" on top of them. Leave flat in a separate drawer of the refrigerator for 1-6 hours. Because of how pungent the raw aromatics were, the final cooked fish had a pleasant, cooperative flavor down to its core by the end of the braising recipe.

I halved the recipe but kept the spices and garlic the same quantity and used chicken broth instead of water because I was afraid of the blandness described by other reviewers. End result was outstanding and even my children ate it. And believe me, when all three of us actually like the same thing, it's time to alert the media.

I really loved this for a quick, light meal. I used 2 tsp of cumin and I don't think it was too much. I also cooked the chickpeas a little longer so some of them started to go brown and crunchy on the outside - delicious! Oh, and I used less oil too - it seemed fine. I'll definately make it again!

Made this for my family tonight and it was delicious. Used hake instead of cod because it has more flavor. Used more cumin than the recipe called for, and sprinkled chopped avacado on top before serving. Relatively easy and tasty.

This recipe is so yummy! You need to tweak it a bit for the best flavor. Just add extra hot pepper flakes and garlic and sprinkle the fish with cumin as well as a generous dose of salt and pepper and then top with lots of cilantro, and chopped avocados. I always serve this with sauteed carrots. Yum Yum

Yum. Added a can of diced toms and their liquid to chickpea mixture. Filet was of differing thicknesses, so I put bigger portion in tomato/chickpea mixture in oven for 10 mins, then added thinner piece for an add'l 15 mins. Really nice.

After reading the recipe and reviews, I decided this dish needed a little "oomph." Chickpeas are terribly bland without more spices, so I decided to use the Middle Eastern kind of canned fava beans (called fool). I drained one can, and added the other to the pan, liquid and all. The result? very tasty and very satisfying; we had the leftovers the next morning for breakfast. I also added more cumin, as well as some ground coriander. Lots of cilantro and lemon topped off the dish nicely. I recommend this for fish lovers and for those whose taste buds run to Middle Eastern cuisine.

I thought this dish was just blah. I also think Cod is not the best fish to cook with. It adds nothing.

This was wonderful! I used organic canned garbanzo beans from Trader Joes and lots of cumin, cilantro and garlic. The final dish with lemon squeezed on top was amazing! VERY VERY tasty! Be sure to simmer the beans for at least 30 minutes so the flavours can combine well.

Fast, flavorful, easy. I'll be making this often.

On the plus side, this dish was easy to prepare and light and healthy. It was just not as flavorful as I expected (I used the dried pepper, not the fresh, which may have been a factor). I'd describe the result as "OK, but not great", and I'd probably not make it again.

This was an excellent weekday meal. The prep was simple and I had all of the ingredients on hand. I substituted tilapia, another mild white fish, for the cod. I also used two fresh jalapenos (seeded and cut in quarters) in place of the dried pepper. I served it with sauteed string beans and sourdough bread to dip in the fish juice. The result was a light and flavorful healthy dinner.
