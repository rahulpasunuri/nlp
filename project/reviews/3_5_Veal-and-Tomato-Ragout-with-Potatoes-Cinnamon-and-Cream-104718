Just wanted to warn anyone who tends to overspice dishes, like me. Be very sparing with the cinnamon. Two sticks means two very short, thin sticks. I mistakenly put the equivalent of four four-inch pieces in and it overwhelmed the dish, making it almost inedible. I was able to save it somehow by adding another can of San Marzano tomatoes and an 8-ounce package of mushrooms. I followed the recipe except added a 28-ounce can of San Marzano plum tomatoes instead of sauce; they break down nicely. Were it not for the ridiculous overload of cinnamon, this would have been a great dish -- the liquid part of the stew was rich and creamy with great mouth-feel (the whipping cream, sinful as it is, really makes a difference here).

Made this since I didn't have time to make the milk-braised pork shoulder on this site which is delicious. This much faster version did the trick. I substituted pork for veal but otherwise followed the recipe. The meat delightfully tender at the end of the cooking period. If you can wait, the flavors are much better the next day (but if you can wait you should make the milk-braised pork I mentioned earlier). The cinnamon was a perfect touch.

Very good. My picky husband and brother in law both loved it despite it being "different" from the bland meat and potatoes they grew up on. Thank goodness. Substituted scanty 1 tsp ground cinnamon for sticks, reduced cooking time slightly per other reviews, otherwise followed recipe. Served with buttered egg noodles. Meat was so tender and savory cinnamon flavor was great despite my not being much of a cinnamon person. A keeper.

Made this recipe for the first time 10 years ago and made it again tonight..still perfect. My tomato sauce was "no salt added" and my husband found it needed a bit of salt for his taste, which was an easy fix. But I preferred it with less salt, so I'd recommed a no salt added paste and then salted to taste per dish. I cut the time on the veal stewing as well as others - just under an hour was plenty of time for the veal to be tender, plus the hour with the cream and potatoes after that was just right.

I thought the unique ingredient of cinnamon is great. I don't agree with anyone who has substituted the potatoes or (dread!!) non alcoholic red wine in the dish. I think it is perfect the way it is. Although, i'm interested in trying lamb instead of veal next time.

This recipe is hard to beat. I made only two small changes to it and without them, I think it still would have worked quite well. I added one teaspoon dried thyme and two small dried bay leaves because of the long simmer. The cinnamon kick was an added surprise! I will make this again and again, especially this winter. Almost forgot: I like frozen peas so I added a cup in the last five minutes of cooking. Over the top!

I have made this at least a dozen times, and my family loves it. I made a few mods however: --pork instead of veal--better flavor, IMO --add a few red pepper flakes to the onion and celery saute' for some heat --after deglazing the pan, i dump it all in the crock pot on high for 5 hours, omitting the water, and adding cream during the last hour of cooking. serve over egg noodles.

I've been making this dish in the regular dinner rotation for several years now. The kids and my husband all love it. Sometimes I add chopped dried apricots or golden raisens and sprinkle the finished dish with chopped cashews. It's delicious with whatever red meat you have on hand, we've used up some of our gamey-er, tough cuts of venison and moose in this recipe and it tenderizes right up.

This was a real hit. The only change I made was to use 250gr of tomato paste instead of the sauce. My kids were scraping the bowl to get the last drop of sauce.

To: A cook from Adelaide, to answer your question regarding tomato sauce, in Australia we would substitute with passata (Italian pureed tomatoes) or buy can tomatoes and whiz them with a bamix. I have learnt (from being an Australian with a U.S. dad) if the recipe says ketchup, it means the stuff we put on our pies/anything that tastes nasty. If it says tomato sauce, anything like a bottled pasta sauce without the herbs.

I cant rate this recipe - I suspect its very nice but in Australia tomato sauce is what I think you call ketchup - and i cant imagine 2 cups of ketchup in such a recipe. Help - what is meant by tomato sauce in this recipe?

I followed this recipe with a couple of changes - I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of whipping cream and used a can of tomato paste diluted with water instead of the the tomatoe sauce which I did not have on hand. I figured that veal is already very tender, it didn't need to stew long - and put in the potatoes after 45 minutes of stewing and finished cooking after an additional 30 minutes. Everything was very tender with the reduced cooking time. I intended on serving with prepared frozen peas on the side, but instead added them to the stew because I thought the stew could use some veggies in it. It was quite good.

We loved this recipe. It is very different from our normal meals. My husband and son were doubtful but they loved it too! The cinnamon adds a warm and fuzzy feeling to this dish.

Yum. Made it exactly according to the recipe and all enjoyed. I actually cooked it the night before and the smells coming from the kitchen made it hard to sleep. Re-heated for a great cold snowy Friday night dinner.

Perfect for a cold January night in Boston. It was just rich enough and the veal melted in your mouth. Everyone inhaled it. Surprising complexity of flavors for such simple ingredients. Definitely will make again.

Made with beef instead of veal. Delicious! Smells very strongly of cinammon, but the taste is much more mellow. Great winter stew.

I did a search using the ingredients I had in my fridge and came across this recipe. First, I have to mention that even though I substituted some ingredients, the result was very delicious. I didn't have celery and tomato sauce so I used scallions and tomato puree, instead. Delicious!

The whole family loved it ... rich and warming on a cold winter night. We made it without the potatoes and served over rice --- delicious!

This dish is terrific and very flavorful. The only thing I would do differently next time would be to make sans potatoes and serve over pappadrelle or egg noodles.

PS, I cut the potatoes in very small pieces and added towards the end, this added to the texture and did not over power the veal with dried out chunks.

This dish is similar to a Greek dish called youvetsi. To fix the "bland" factor as mentioned by "San Diego" I seasoned the veal in lots of salt, pepper and good ground Madagascar cinnamon, also throw in some red pepper flakes when browning the meat. My mother in-law uses brandy in place of wine when she makes youvetsi and it is fabulous, I just didn't have any on hand for this recipe.

Have made this dish many times and it is always a big hit. My husband and I crave this every fall when the weather starts to get cold and we haven't had stew for the summer months. A family favourite!

followed exactly, but was v. bland. added lots of salt/pepper and even a bit of cumin, in an attempt to save this dish! word of advice: find another recipe.

A hit with my extended "family" who were telling me how wonderful it smelled quite a while before it was ready to eat. Used pork rather than veal (for ethical reasons) which reduced the cooking time. Turned out tender enough to cut with a fork.

So good and so easy. I used beef stew meat instead of veal and it was a big hit.

Rating: 4
I'm wondering if the cooks who find the cinnamon taste overpowering are using cinnamon sticks that are too big. Though the recipe doesn't specify, using 2 3-inch sticks is perfect. Of course, some people can never accept the fact that cinnamon can be used in savory dishes, not just in cookies! This dish is best with veal; beef stew meat isn't as deliciously tender. And don't leave out the potatoes. They absorb the flavor of the meat and spices, and are just delicious. Make sure to really sear the veal chunks to get a good crust on them.

Have made this wonderful dish a half a dozen times since the recipe first appeared last year. Absolutely one of my faves, we double the recipe so we can enjoy it a few times. Very little hands on, but give yourself at least 3 hours for stove time. The first time I made it my guests didn't eat til 10, luckily it was so worth the wait.

Similar to a previous user, I opted-out of of plain tomato sauce. I used a store bought brand that had extra basil and romano cheese in it. My 20-month old daughter *loved* this meal on a bed of rice. She kept asking for 'mo' (translation = more)! I'd make it again just for her. Personally, this dish reminded me of a bland version of Lamb Stew Ciuba (if you liked the idea of cinnamon with your meat, you've got to try that recipe from Gourmet February 1997). For religious and practical reasons, I used red non-alcoholic wine instead of regular white wine (the practical reason was that I didn't want to go out to the store and find a non-alcoholic white). Another thing that bothers me about these types of recipes is quickly finding another use for an ingredient that I rarely - if ever - use; in this case whipping cream!

Mixed reviews on this one. My husband loved it but I thought it had a strange flavor. I found the cinnamon, tomato and wine flavors to clash. To be fair, I used a pretty cheap Reisling, maybe that was the problem. IT does produce a very tender meat, but any other stew recipe would too. I've made nearly every recipe from the Best of Home Cooking issue this recipe appeared in and this was the least impressive - the best are the Parmesan Pork Chops and the Braised Meatballs in red wine gravy.

This was SO good and not difficult to make, just a lot of time on the stove. I made this for my friend who served it to her mom and Grandmother who loved it too. I substituted ground cinnamon (2 tsp) in the flour and 1 tsp when cooking as I didn't have cinnamon sticks. Also added Tomato and Olive Pasta Sauce instead of tomato sauce which I didn't have either!

This is delicious! Loved it, served it to firends with cousocus on the side--everyone liked the cinnamon, no changes. As for the previous reviewer: It drives me nuts when people substitute gross ingredients (what on EARTH is fat-free cream? Can you imagine the garbage they put into that to get it to be "cream-like". 1/2 cup of cream divided between 6 servings is far healthier than a bunch of chemicals in a pseudo cream product.) I am sure it DID have a sour taste, bleach, but it has nothing to do with this recipe, which is delicious if you make it with real instead of space-age ingredients.

The first time I made this, we were disappointed until we tried it as leftovers--everyone loved it (including my toddler!). I substituted beef for the veal, and low-fat milk for cream with good results. If you have good quality cinnamon (not the grocery store stuff) use less. I've made this several times, with lamb over couscous for a north African taste, and with beef over rice; this is a family favorite! When the butter is reduced and the milk used, this is a pretty healthy meal, too. I also never peel the potatoes (why lose all those nutrients?).

I really liked this dish. I omitted the potatoes, finished it off with the cream, and served the ragout over couscous. Not only was it very good, but it cut down the cooking time. I also used only one cinnamon stick and it seemed to add enough flavor.

I thought this recipe was good, especially for a cold winter night. I agree with the reviewer who suggested it for a weekend, definitely takes a good amount of time to cook. The cinnamon (both sticks, I thought) made a nice addition and an unusual twist to an otherwise good, but not exceptional recipe.

The dish was excellent, very flavorful. This dish requires alot of cooking time so not a good weekday dish (for those of us who work and don't want to slave in the kitchen for more than 2 hours). I recommend it highly on the weekend however, when it is cold out and you need something to make your tummy sing. I made plain white rice and poured the veal ragout over the rice - truly wonderful!

An excellent, savory dish. I substituted lamb for veal (none available). For better flavor, make, refrigerate overnight and reheat.

Rating: 2
I would make it the same with the exception of cutting the cinnamon back to one instead of two sticks. This isn't a combination of flavours that is everyday but it is uniquely tasty. I served the ragout as presented in the magazine with the same menu of smoked salmon and crisp salad and apple tart. Perfect.

Rating: 4
I was unable to locate veal in our small town so I substituted pork. The pork and cinnamon made a delicious combination even at the 2 stick cinnamon strength. Maybe all of those who objected to the use of the cinnamon should give pork a try. My company raved about this recipe.

This is a great recipe minus all the cinnamon, which is why I gave it a "delicious" rating. I cut down the cinnamon to half a stick the first time; I cook with cinnamon sticks a lot and they really can overpower a recipe. The second time I made this dish, I didn't even use the cinnamon. It's a good dish for a cold winter evening.

Wow, I really liked this dish. I thought the flavor combinations were unusual, but good. Definitely try this.

Two sticks of cinnamon is way too much for this recipe - it completely overwhelmed the dish. Although it seemed like a nice idea on paper, I just didn't care for the flavor very much.

Rating: 2
I am going to try this again, using half as much cinnamon. When I tasted it half-way through the process, before adding the potatoes, the cinnamon flavor was overpowering. Although I recognized that the potatoes might mellow it out a bit, I nonetheless removed the cinamon sticks at that point. Still, the finished product was a bit too heavy on the cinammon for my taste. I think it will be worth trying again though.
