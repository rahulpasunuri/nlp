OMG! i made this for our dinner group and served it with a german off dry riesling..it was incredible. i was a rock star, queen of the universe. don't forget to salt and pepper your quail before grilling and a grinding of pepper on the salad is good, too.

Elegant as part of a 5 course meal followed by a sorbet or palate cleanser then the entree. Also nice between a light clear (tomato was good) hot soup and an entree

I order my juniper berries from www.penzeys.com. They have a vast array of spices and seasonings - most not available in your supermarket. They also do a lot of blends.

In case the juniper berry person reads this again, you can find them in the spice aisle. They look like a peppercorn, and are the main flavoring for gin. Delicious with bay leaves, port sauces, and probably this quail recipe. Enjoy!

I tried to make this as directed, however I could not locate the juniper berries. We enjoyed this very much without them, and it was delicious, however I couldn't help wonder what we might have been missing with the absence of the juniper berries. Would anyone like to comment on the flavors that they add? I will make this again, and try to find those berries for the next time!

I've used chicken thighs instead of quail--they are incredible too!

I am a hunter. This is a terrific recipe, not only for quail, but for any game bird. I have used pheasant, quail and sharptails. The blend of flavors is unique. I've gotten rave reviews every time I've fixed this salad.

I substituted pecans for the pepitas and everyone loved the salad. Great recipe for a hot summer night or warm January evening in the South!
