Made this tonight for my husband who is usually indifferent to cauliflower and got rave reviews from him and my guests. I seemed to have a lot of sauce though, and for an average size head, I think the sauce could be cut in half. Otherwise, great dish that I will make again!

OMG, this is so delicious. I served it instead of baked potatoes with a steak dinner. It was so good that I didn't want my steak. Definitely a recipe that you will want to make again and again.

This is a four fork recipe! I have made it several times, and it is always consistently delicious. I did substitute non-fat Greek Yogurt for the cream, and that did not interfere with the flavor. When I make it for holidays, I add some chopped toasted pecans. I also use Gluten Free Flour and bread crumbs.

Made this for supper tonight to accompany a pork roast. Absolutely outstanding recipe! Slight modifications made - didn't have half-and-half so used 1 2/3 cups 1% milk and the remainder whipping cream. By mistake I added 1/3 cup of grated parmigiano reggiano to the bread crumbs but no matter, it browned up nicely and the flavour of the cauliflower with the sauce was scrumptious! Husband loves cauliflower with cheese and this one was a hit! Will definitely make again!

It looks beautiful but I will try the recipe using either large florets or thick slices rather than a whole head,for ease of serving.

I have made cauliflower this way but with out preparing the sauce with the half and half. ( less calories ). Once the cauliflower has been steamed, I put the head in a shallow baking dish. Sprinkle with italian breadcrumbs then lay american cheese slices over the top to cover. I then sprinkle more italian breadcrumbs on the cheese slices. Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 5-10 minutes.
