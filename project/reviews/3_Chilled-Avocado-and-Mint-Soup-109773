I love this soup. Didn't find it bitter or sour. I used one whole Florida avocado, I did find the chicken broth a little strong at first but it mellowed the longer it chilled and let the avocado flavor shine. another great avocado soup is "charred corn and avocado soup".

I've made this on multiple occasions. Guest always enjoy it.

This is a perennial favorite in our house, and something I frequently prepare when entertaining. The cool mint, the tart lime, the salty broth, the creamy avocados, the zippy peppers (which I usually double)... delicious. As the recipe indicates, be sure to use Haas avocados, and be sure that they're ripe (otherwise the soup will seem sour). I've also found that this is one of a handful of recipes for which I avoid low-sodium chicken broth, opting for regular chicken broth, or it comes out a bit bland. I like using this as a soup course after the hors d'oeuvre "Goat Cheese Quesadillas with Roasted Red Pepper Sauce," also here on Epicurious.

Yuck!! I was suspicious that this recipe was going in the wrong direction from the sourish and bland taste of the avocado mixture. It was the addition of the chicken broth that really made it a disaster. The chicken flavor completely fought with the avocado & mint flavors. Usually I can salvage just about anything but I had to throw this out. What a waste of avocados!

Sour and bitter. A real disappointment.

We really liked this - followed recipe exactly but before I put the chicken broth in, I decided there was too much for two of us. I removed half and we used it as dip later in the week. Very refreshing and quick. We had it before the red beans and rice salad.

This sounded a lot better than it turned out. It was okay, but very rich. Check out the Artichoke Blue Cheese Bisque. Even family and friends that HATE blue cheese LOVED it!

Yes!! Great, Wonderful for summer evenings. I also used chipoltes for lack of serranos, everyone loved it!

I'm glad I halved the recipe because I thought it was bland and too citrusy. The avocado flavor was overpowered by the buttermilk and the lime. And what about salt? It definitely needed some.

Ugh!! A waste of good avocados. Probably wouldn't have reviewed if I hadn't seen the 4 forks of the previous reviewer. The lime and mint just didn't work here (too tart) and I was unable to save it. Finally tossed the whole thing. Would love to hear others' comments-- perhaps I did something wrong?

Great recipe, used chipotles, didn't have any Serrano chilies. The heat was a perfect blend to the coolness of the avocado. Will definitely make again!
