This was absolutely fabulous and very easy for even the novice cook. I added one red bell pepper, 2 small cans of coconut milk and used 7 seeded large jalapenos and yes curry powder as i had no curry leaves but will get and try it again. we put a pound of shrimp and 9 large sea scallops and served over quinoa for a lower glycemic impact. was AMAZING.

This dish rocked! The chilies were hot, but not overwhelming (although they may be by tomorrow's leftovers). I took the seeds and membranes out to enjoy them. I served it with basmati rice cooked with chicken stock, ginger, and garlic. I tossed a handful of chopped cilantro on the dish and a dollop of Greek yogurt to cool it off. For the reviewers that used curry powder instead of curry leaves, I'm glad it still tasted great, but curry leaves have a VERY different taste than curry powder and are not the same thing at all. If you order fresh curry leaves on line, or find them at a market - you can freeze them.

This was excellent. My fiance loves shrimp and I love the feeling of Dante's Inferno in my mouth. I would highly recommend this to anyone... because you can adjust to your preferences. for instance, we used about 22 serranos (hurts so good!) and lots of quality curry powder since we couldn't find leaves and coconut milk instead of shavings. we put it over a bed of plain white rice. i am interested in trying this with the proper ingredients, but with the coconut milk, the fire of the peppers was intense but balanced.

I was lucky to find fresh curry leaves and made this recipe exactly as written. Excellent!

I'm surprised this tasted a lot like the "Spicy Wok Shrimp with Coconut Rice" on this site. I even used real fresh curry leaves, but there wasn't that much curry taste...I expected more of an indian flavor. Instead, it tastes more like a Thai dish, though it definitely is less calories (no coconut milk). Still good, but more work than the other recipe.

Very good dish. I cut the recipe in half for two people, and added about 1/4 cup of coconut milk in addition to minced fresh coconut. Omitted curry leaves without any ill effect. This dish is fairly simple (provided you use prepared coconut), and will become a staple in our routine.

I stuck to the recipe on this except for adding fewer chiles. I found it flavorful and excellent. Being vegan, I used a vegetarian meat substitute instead of shrimp.... and was very pleased with the results. Yum!

If fresh curry leaves are not available in your area. (I find them at Oriental grocery stores, they carry all the good fresh fun herbs etc) Fresh curry leaves are available online. I have not purchased from this site but here is an example. http://www.indianble nd.com/site/664954/p roduct/SP-73. Loved the recipe, can easily manipulate the spice to taste. YUM!

Please, I want to make this authentically, but where does one get fresh curry leaves? Not even Whole Foods has them.

This is a good, fast and delicious curry. I used cilantro instead of curry leaves which are not available to me. Depending on your tomatoes, if may be a bit dry, especially if you use dried coconut, so you may need to add a bit of liquid with the tomatoes. I also added the juice of one lime to brighten up the taste.

This recipe was the first curry recipe I had ever tried and it was really good. I added rice to it to add more substance to it, but I don't think I will next time because I found that I was just eating the shrimp, tomatoes, and peppers out and leaving the rice, so what the recipe says really is the way to do it. I thought there was a little less taste to it than I wanted it to. There was an excellent hotness factor but I wanted there to be more flavor. I couldn't open my coconut that I had bought at the store though, so there was no coconut in mine and that could have been a big factor. It is something I'll definitely make again, because it really was good.
