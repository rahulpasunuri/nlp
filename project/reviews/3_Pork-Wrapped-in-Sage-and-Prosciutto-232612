This was such an easy recipe to make and tasted great! Instead of sage leaves I had basil leaves and rubbed basil infused olive oil on. Delish!

Nice idea that failed to deliver. Perhaps its just me, but all that Prosciutto was too salty, even without seasoning. The Mustard-Sage cream sauce, suggested by a reviewer, was a bit hit though!

My husband loves this. I agree no extra salt is needed and the mustard cream sauce is delicious with it. Have done it with pork chops when I didn't have nderloin on hand with good results (obviously different cooking times).

Love this recipe. One loin is just enough for the two of us. I have also cooked it over a bed of figs, and served it with roasted potatoes.

This is a beautiful and tasty dish, suitable for company. The pork benefits by a little time spent in a simple marinade of olive oil and lemon juice before cooking. It is very easy to overcook. Unless you really like salty food, the pork should not be salted.

Very simple and delicious way to cook a pork Tenderloin, I just added primo piatto and a salad for a great meal.

I saw this dish on the menu of the Three Bears restaurant in Westport last night. I have made it several times as has one of my coworkers. It's definitely a keeper. No need to add salt though. The prosciutto is usually salty enough.

This was easy and delicious. I don't know why the complaint of the saltiness, unless the proscuitto was too thick. I even salted the pork before wrapping. The sage leaves had a nice flavor to them when you bite in, I was afraid it would be overpowering but it was really tasty. Only change I made was to add garlic like another reviewer. Also served this with a side of mustard sage cream from the veal recipe on this site.... 2 1/2 tablespoons chopped shallots 1/3 cup unsalted chicken broth 2 tablespoons minced fresh sage or 2 teaspoons dried rubbed sage 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 1/4 cup half and half (I used fat free...it didn't get thick, but it was yummy!) cooked up with the pan drippings from the pork. Served the sauce in tiny condiment cups on glass dishes.

This was a hit. I used one 2lb pork loin, which just meant I had to be creative with the proscuitto wrapping. I used enough sage leaves to cover about half the area of the proscuitto, and didn't salt the pork before wrapping. Unfortunately, my meat thermometer malfunctioned and the pork ended up slightly overcooked - but the sage and proscuitto meant it was still very flavorful. I'll definitely make it again.

This dish was excellent. Had some of the leftovers for breakfast. When I make it again, I will use more thinly-sliced prosciutto and probably will not salt the meat. The dijon/garlic and chipotle variations sound good, too. At the same time, on another oven rack, I also roasted some sliced potatoes with butter, shallots, and fresh thyme, and everything turned out great. Be careful not to overcook the pork.

I am getting ready to make this dish for the second time. I thought that it was wonderful as did my guests. I placed very thin slices of garlic on the tenderloin after salting and peppering. Then placed the sage leaves over the garlic about a half inch apart from each other. I used half of what the recipe called for on the prosciutto, which I assume kept me from the saltiness concern, and wrapped the slices around the tenderloin directly over the sage leaves. All of the flavors blended together beautifully.

Quick and easy and delicious. The pork stayed moist, HOWEVER I did not salt it and did not feel it needed any more salt than what the proscuitto provided. A good every day dish.

Unfortunately, the husband and I were rather disappointed with this. We followed the suggestions of others and rubbed dijon mustard and garlic over the tenderloin. But I think the real problem is that we doubled and coarsely chopped the sage, then sprinkled it over the tenderloin before wrapping it with proscuitto. Discovered we weren't as big of fans of sage as we thought. Totally overpowered the pork and the ham was also too salty for our tastes. Oh well. We choked it down anyway.

I thought this was OK, but my wife didn't like it. She pulled the prosciutto off because is was too salty and she didn't care for the sage.

I really enjoyed this recipe.

Very delicate and extremely simple to make. I wouldn't change the seasoning a bit. The only thing I would do differently next time would be to allow the pork to rest, covered, in the fridge wrapped in the sage and prosciutto for an hour or so to act like a dry marinade. I made this after an exhausting day and felt like I'd gone out to dinner; of course, if I had gone out to dinner, the dish would have been accompanied by something more interesting than frozen veggies and couscous...

This was delicious! Will definitely make again. I used lots of sage and added some herbs de provence. The combination was mouthwatering. Everyone raved. Served it with the butternut squash with shallots and sage out of October's Gourmet. Wonderful!

What a delicious change from the ordinary pork tenderloin! I added a dollop (1 tsp) of dijon and spread it over one side of the loin, added some chopped garlic and sage before wrapping it with the prosciutto. I also made roast potatoes and wrapped the left over prosciutto (sliced lengthwise into thin strips) around asparagus stalks and bar-b-qued them. Everything was delicious! My boyfriend loved it - thought he had died and gone to heaven! This definitely is worth making again! Enjoy!

I have been making this dish for the past 2 years. It is the same as the Italian Jump in Your Mouth dish made with veal. It is my daughters favorite dish. As we raise our own pork, I decided to try it. Needless to say, it was a hit. I will continue to make it.

Rating: 4
What a great dish! I considered adding mustard but decided against it and wasn't sorry. I did add some vermouth to the roasting pan while the roast was resting, scraping the pan and making a nice sauce. Next time I'll chop more sage and sprinkle it evenly over the proscuitto before wrapping it.

Very simple to make. Definitely use more sage and I added mustard and garlic as well. Wish I used more mustard b/c the flavor didn't come through strong enough. Pork was cooked perfectly.

Excellent and easy weeknight dinner. I used some additional crumbled sage on the other side of the pork before wrapping. I also made sure that the top was adequately covered with olive oil for the baking.

Quick, easy and very good. I used more sage so that it practically covered the whole loin. The meat was so moist. Next time, I'll try it with mustard and garlic and make a sauce from the drippings.

This dish looked beautiful, but was slightly dry even tough I removed from the oven at 450 degrees and deglazed the pan with port for a sauce. I would also have liked to taste the sage a little more.

Very simple, yet a very good dish. I followed the advice of one review and rubbed Dijon mustard on the pork, and I also sprinkled some minced garlic over the sage. Excellent! Next time I might rub pureed chipotle pepper in adobo sauce on the pork instead of the mustard.

This was very good. I liked the moisture of the tenderloin. I have trouble cooking pork as I tend to accidentally dry it out, but this was lovely. I also liked the sage a lot...the proscuitto was pretty good. It sure is a pretty dish. It would go well with mashed potatoes.

Followed the recipe to a T and it was just delicious - so simple. I was pleased that the pork didn't dry out and with sage right out of the garden, the combination was lovely.

Simple and easy to make. Remember not to overcook the pork or it'll get horribly dry. I stopped cooking at 147F and it was moist and tasty (and yes, I could taste the fresh sage leaves :-)

I love sage, pork tenderloin, and prosciutto but this recipe was disappointing. I used fresh sage but didn't think it's flavor really imbued the tenderloin. The prosciutto was dry, brittle and tough after cooking for the recommended time. There are many, many better recipies for pork tenderloin on this site.

Couldn't taste the sage, proscuitto wasn't worth it and pork tenderloin was too dry (as always). I'd use a pork loin next time with sage and wrap it with bacon.

I made this a few weeks ago as written. It was good. Simple as that. My dinner guests cancelled at the last minute before dinner, so I froze 1/2 of the recipe. We ate the frozen part last night. and it was good too. Simple easy dish that's good. My only problem was with the presentation...the pork loin wrapped in the proscuto look like an Egyptian cat mummy I've seen in museums. However, when the "mummy' is sliced up for serving, it looks nothing like a cat mummy. As another reviewer pointed out, there are pan drippings which I made into gravy. Yummy.

Delicious! I did sprinkle the pork tenderloin with salt & citrus-seasoned pepper and also sprinkled sliced fresh garlic over the proscuitto before wrapping the meat in it. I salted and peppered the proscuitto lightly before roasting. It was good even cold as leftovers.

I made this with smaller chops (1/2 recipe)and no thermometer, but everything else the same. FRESH sage, picked right off my plant I keep above the stove, coarse salt, Freshly ground pepper. I was happily impressed! Baked it the usual amount of time for chops of that size and the prociutto wrapping kept the moisture in perfectly. Sweet potatoes on the side and it was a nice little dinner for two.

I didn't add the salt called for in the recipe, but did rub the pork with chopped garlic and dijon mustard before wrapping in the prosciutto. Use a lot of fresh sage, it really makes the flavor stand out. It turned out very good, and was SO easy and quick.

Rating: 3
The wrapping is a good concept...the sage is a little iffy. The herb often is rather bitter and odd tasting. Finding good tasting sage is not easy. This is a recipe to try and if you like the sage, fine. If not, maybe try other herbs that you like (oregano, thyme, rosemary). A nice broth is left in the bottom of the pan, which might make a nice gravy with some seasoning and thickening.

I am not sure what I am missing, but when I made this dish, the sage overpowered the entire dish! It was awful! I added mustard before the sage leaves (which helped!) and cut the tenderloin in half lengthwise and put it on the BBQ. I did use 8 small leaves per tenderloin, would that be the reason (it seemed like it was half the ingredients). Maybe that was it!Next time I will use less sage or brown it butter first. The suggestion of mincing the sage with garlic and salt first sounds like it might be better.

I agree with the other reviewers. I do a version of this recipe but I brown the wrapped tenderloin in a pan then wrap it in puff pastry like a wellington. Great dish for the holidays. I think the original recipe appears in Cuisine.

This sounds delicious. I liked the variation of cooking it over plums. How do you prepare the plums first? I'm going to try it this weekend.

Tasted better on the 2nd day. The sage was very subtle, so the next time I make this I will either bruise the leaves to release the oils or chiffonade the leaves prior to wrapping. Otherwise, it was very simple to prepare for a mid-week meal.

the jamie oliver version of this dish is far superior, and a favorite for wowing guest with very little effort. smash some sage with some garlic in a pestle and mortar, then add a few glugs of olive oil - rub this on your tenderloins and let them sit for a bit, an hour if you have it. then wrap in proscuitto and cover with any remaining marinade, and more sage. he cooks this over rhubarb, but i love it over plums. the resulting juice is simply phenomenal. scrunch up a wet piece of parchment paper and cover the dish the first 15mn of cooking so the proscuitto doesn't burn. the pork always comes out incredibly moist....

I only made one tenderloin (hence half the recipe), and this is extremely quick and very good. The only change I'd make would be to not salt the pork prior to wrapping, as the prosciutto is salty enough, and it was a little too salty when finished. I agree with others that some garlic might be nice, but it really doesn't need anything, the sage is wonderful with the salty wrapping and the tender, moist pork. This might be a good combination if the pork was butterflied and then rolled with the pork and sage--maybe a little parmesan or fontina cheese? Yum!

I rubbed the pork with mustard, sprinkled with garlic, and it still didn't do anything for me. Maybe it needed a sauce of same kind to really kick up the flavor.

If you marinate in italian dressing mixed with 2 tablespoons of dijon mustard for an hour before cooking, it really spices up the flavor. This is a really fast, after work recipe. I served it with mashed potatoes and a ceasar salad. Wonderful.

Delicious. I followed others recommendations and rubbed the tenderloin with 1T dijon and 2 cloves of garlic minced before wrapping in the sage/proscuitto. Found it did need to cook for 25 min at 425, vs the shorter time from another review. Sit for 5-10 min and was perfectly pink and moist. Was VERY easy to make and a hit. Will definitely make again.

I found this to be easy, but kind of dull. The pork was tender and the sage flavor was fine. I just thought it needed something more that won't overpower the flavor of the prosciutto. Hmmmm.

Very tasty and easy preparation, but .... I made this per the recipe - in my oven it was done to 150 after 18 minutes. After 10 minutes sitting it was at 170+, no pink left. Overdone! Next time I'll roast it to 125 and let it sit the 10 to rise to 145-50, which will still be somewhat pink and much more tender and flavorful.

This recipe is tasty as written, but I added a THIN coating of dijon mustard to the pork before wrapping in the prosciutto. Next time I'll try a light sprinkling of smoky Spanish paprika. Hmmm, then a substitution of herbs... I cook aboard a yacht for 5 months each year and appreciate showy, tasty and simple non-seafood entrees for menu contrast and variety. This scored on all points and brought requests for repeat servings.
