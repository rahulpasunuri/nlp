I wasn't thrilled with this recipe. I thought it was ok with the compote, but without it, the ice cream was too tart. My husband really hated it as well as one of our guests. Now I have a lot of ice cream left...

This ice cream was both rich and refreshingly lemony. I really didn't think the compote added a whole lot to it, but the ice cream was yummy. I especially liked it when it was still soft, right out of the ice cream maker.
