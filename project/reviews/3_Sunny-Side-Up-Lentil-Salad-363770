I followed the recipe, but added paprika, and cumin to spice it up a bit....very good will make again!

This was very good, I wish I could have given 2.5 stars. I added garlic to the lentils and used apple cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar for the dressing - both gave needed depth. A good and easy meal.

I followed this recipe for the most part, though I omitted celery and took liberties with the amount and type of spice (cumin, chili, and smoked paprika). I found just the lentil mixture to be good enough without any additional salad dressing. Overall a good recipe and easily modified to individual taste!

I was surprised how much I loved this recipe! I added garlic and used spinach for greens, and it was awesome. I ate the leftovers with quinoa, which was also very yummy.

I was excited to try this recipe...love eggs, lentils, salad and healthy/filling meals. Overall - a good dish, but I wish the lentils had a stronger spice direction. This felt a little bit like drained lentil soup with an egg on top. I'll make this dish again - but may take my own liberties with the lentil component.

This is absolutely delicious and I wouldn't change any of the recipe. Makes for quite a decadent brunch and is healthy to boot! Think a healthy eggs benedict.. This is perfect for lazy snow days and will add it to my regular rotation of breakfasts.
