I was very surprised to discover that my soup tasted like onion-flavored water after reading all of the glowing reviews. I used beef-flavored stock instead of beef broth, but I can't imagine that that's what made the difference. I also doubled the recipe but didn't double the water (which I could see accounting for it tasting too watery). After adding a pinch of sugar, more salt, two beef bouillon cubes, another tablespoon of butter, more white wine, and enough sherry, rum and whiskey to sink a small ship, it was delicious. (I would've used brandy in place of the rum and whiskey but didn't have any on hand).

This was an easy & tasty recipe. I made it for dinner with some friends, who are vegetarian, so I had to make some adjustments. I used vegetable broth & then used red wine instead of white & added a little Worcestershire sauce, & balsamic vinegar to add some depth to the broth. I tried it after I made it but was unimpressed. Luckily, I made it the day before & it was much better the next day. I can't really compare it to soup made with beef broth, but it got great reviews from my friends (& they're good old friends, so if it was unimpressive they would have said something).

Great, easy recipe. Neither grocery stores by me had fresh thyme so I used the equivalent of dried and it was fine.

I all can say is, "Ooh la la!" This will become one of my repertoire dishes. The onions took over 2 hours to caramelize and I would have liked to let them keep going for another 15 mins. Next time, I'll start this at 2:00 in order to serve dinner at 7. It certainly won't hurt to keep it on the back burner on low heat while I do kitchen cleanup & chatting.

Very Easy and Delicious! I could not have asked for a better soup! word of advice; make sure you buy bowls that are not very wide at the top so the cheese can melt over the top...otherwise, it will be just as good but the presentation will be slightly off

This recipe, unaltered with Gruyère, had my girlfriend comparing my French onion soup to that of some of the best restaurants in New York City. With a few tweaks tbd to match her exact tastes I'll surpass 'em. The long cooking time is important here; it really gives the ingredients time to express themselves into the soup.

This is easily the best recipe I have ever made from Epi... nothing but the best reviews from everyone I have made it for! I added some rosemary, did half red and half white wine, and added a little balsamic and worchestershire from the previous recommendations... all really great additions. I also cut off the rind from the gruyere cheese and threw it in the pot while it was simmering, and it really added a whole new dynamic to the soup. Amazing dish!!!

Answer to the crocks question. I am making this soup for a family get together where I do not have real dishes, so forget about putting it under the broiler - my plan is to toast the croutons, add the cheese & put it under the broiler on a baking sheet (I hope the condo has a baking sheet) and then top each soup serving with the cheese-covered crouton. I read this suggestion somewhere while researching onion soup recipes and it seemed it would work. I'll keep you posted. This is the recipe I intend to follow with a lot of the suggestions.

Rating: 4
Excellent. I used 3# onions instead of 2, which seemed smallish to me. I added a bit extra bay leaf and thyme. I also added a small bit (1/2 teaspoon about) of anchovy paste. The final simmering reduces and concentrates the flavors so don't worry about the added water (I was suspicious as I wanted BIG flavors). This was excellent. You could sub sherry for the white wine if you adjusted the amount. Oh, and I added one garlic clove to the saute. Fantastic. I had a jar of Duck Fat that I got for Xmas, and next time I'm going to include some with the butter.

Onion soup is a tradition for our family on New Year's Eve. For years I used the recipe from Joy of Cooking. This recipe had more steps and took more time but it was worth it. It will now be the traditional recipe.

Awesome, we loved it!! I didn't have fresh thyme so I used dried and powder thyme. I also didn't have enough white wine so I used half white and half red. It turned out great!! This was my first time making french onion soup and we were very impressed, can't wait to make it again!!

I tend to use recipes as guidelines and then add my own tweaking. With that being said, the soup was absolutely superb! My husband couldnt get enough and I was most impressed with myself. lol A few of my tweakings were: -sauted the sweet onions with fresh rosemary and fresh thyme. -added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar after 30 minutes to carmelize the onions - used port instead of dry white wine. It does turn the soup a much darker colour but the taste was otherwordly. I toasted the bread with olive oil and smoked paprika and used mozarella and smoked gouda cheese instead.

After a recent trip to Walla Walla Washington, gathering a 10 pound bag of onions, I needed to try a good onion soup recipe. This one totally filled the bill. I will make this again. As a main course with a nice fresh green salad, we were very happy. And it just gets better and better as leftovers. Be patient as you cook the onions initially...it's worth the stirring. PS - The wine you use makes a huge difference, so choose wisely. As Julia Child said, "Don't cook with a wine you wouldn't drink while you were cooking". If you're in a pinch, a dry vermouth works well, but something a littl nutty is exceptional.

Rating: 4
I made this recipe according to the way it is written, noting that alot of the reviewers mentioned carmelizing the onions until they're golden. I used red wine instead of white because it's what I had open, and this recipe was very good. (Never heard of using white wine in a beef dish before)Having never made French Onion soup before, I was pretty pleased with the results. I am keeping this recipe and will definitely make this again.

But I confess to changing it a bit. Used a variety of onions (sweet, yellow, white, red & shallots) added some garlic (how can you make soup w/o garlic?) and used Rachel Ray's beef stock, plus 1 C of water + better than boullion, beef. Add a dash of Worchestershire & a splash of cognac for savory flavor. Outstanding!

Very tasty...after a couple additions. After making the soup as the directions state (except I used beef stock vs beef broth) I then tried it. It was very watery tasting. I then read the reviews and added 2 extra sprigs of thyme (great suggestion!) and I added two beef boulion cubes and that did the trick. Perfect!

This was totally delicious. One question for the other reviewers out there: What is the best way to melt the cheese/toast combo if you do not have little pots that can go in a broiler. I tried just putting the cheese and toast in the bottom of the bowl and dumping the soup over it, but my improvisation left something to be desired.

awesome! Very tasty. would definatly make it again. I would double the recipe next time. it only made about 3 normal size bowls. I also browned the onions for about an hour and a half. And served the bread on the side.

I was disappointed by this recipe, based on all the rave reviews. I used organic yellow onions, beef better than bouillon, a nice savignon blanc, gruyere cheese, and caramelized the onions for 45 minutes. The end result was ok, but I think it lacked depth. Maybe would have been better with cognac as other reviewers suggested. I would also suggest using at least 5 thyme sprigs, if not more.

Rating: 4
I have found this to be a very good and easy recipe for french onion soup. I used a blend of sweet, red and white onions along with a couple shallots. The key is to start them on high for about 10 minutes and then back it down to medium medium/low and slowly cook down for almost 2 hours till carmelized. Then add the wine(I use red) and I added like many a couple shots of balsamic vinegar and a shot of cognac. The one other hint I found useful was for the last half hour or so of cooking the onions down I added a single chicken drum stick along with garlic. I found this added tremendous flavor to the soup(a little bit of oil too but you could always use chicken bones for the same effect). Overall very good. In terms of cheese I used a 50/50 mix of gruyere and sliced mozzarella.

Rating: 4
Very easy to make, and yummy! I substituted the fresh thyme for dried simply because I had that on hand. Definitely a keeper...and yes, better the next day.

I have made this several times. The last time I started the day before by baking some beef bones for 45 minutes and simmered (about an hour) them in the broth I was going to use for the soup. The following day, I removed the fat from the broth and followed the recipe using the enriched broth. It gave the soup a deeper flavor and it wasn't that much more work.

I was worried about this last night when, after carmelizing onions for about 90 minutes, I added the liquid, including boxed beef and chicken broth. It tasted really thin. I paid attention to other reviewers and let it sit overnight. I simmered for about 45 minutes today, and just had my first ramekin full with the croute and gruyere/parmesan melted under the boiler. It was delicious!

Absolutely yummy. The only changes I made were because of what I had on hand -- a good red wine and dried thyme. Those who've found this soup bland may have started with tasteless, watery onions -- that happens. Organic onions are generally tastier - try them. I can't wait to make this again.

I recommend making this the day before you plan to serve it. The difference the next day was surprising! My only change was to use low-sodium chicken broth in place of the water.

I made this per the recipe except added 2 T of brandy at the end and cooked the onions for about an hour and a half. It was delicious but I think it could of been richer, so next time I am going to change the water to broth and reduce it down at least 45 minutes and lower the amount of butter. The Gruyere was perfect and I used a white wine. It was delicious and light served with a grilled asparagus spinach salad with a light lemon balsamic dressing.

My only suggestion is practical. It's far less messy to toast your bread with the cheese on top in a toaster oven and then ladle half the soup into a bowl, top it with your toasted cheesy bread, and ladle the rest on top. Clean up is a breeze.

This was lovely. I used my cast iron dutch oven and the onions caramelized in about 50 minutes. One thing I don't see readers commenting on is the reduced beef stock. I wasn't quite sure what to do so I put a quart of beef stock on the stove and threw in an additional cup of leftover chicken stock and reduced it while the onions caramelized. For the white wine, I used vermouth. I also made my own french bread from scratch. This was a delight!

One word ... WOW! More words: This is an amazing recipe. I used my dutch oven. It worked very well. The onions took about 1hr and 10 mins to get them where I wanted.

This is a great recipe. I was able to get my onions caramelized as needed at around an hour. I added about a tablespoon each of Worcestershire sauce and balsamic vinegar which I think enhanced the flavor. I also used provolone cheese instead because its what I had on hand and had recently had french onion soup at a restaurant that used provolone for their soup.

Rating: 4
This soup is great! I join the chorus of folks who had to caramelize the onions a LOT longer than the recipe says - I think I let mine go nearly 2 hours in the pan. Also, I am a vegetarian so I used vegetable (specifically, Imagine Foods "No-Chicken") broth - and wanted to assure any other vegetarians out there that this soup can definitely be made deliciously without the beef broth. To try to compensate for the depth that the beef broth would have added, I touched the soup up with a teaspoon or two of Bragg's Liquid Aminos. I may have also tossed in the same amount of dark brown sugar. I had some shallots to use up so added those in with the onions. It's wonderful!

Rating: 4
Excellent! As was the case with most others who made this, it took much longer to get the onions a deep golden brown, but the flavor of the soup was spot on - not at all bland.

I didn't think it was possible to make a french onion soup at home that tasted like it was from a restaurant, but this one does. A couple notes, as suggested in other reviews, I used red wine and also substituted chicken stock for the water to add more flavor. But, because I did not use either low sodium beef or chicken stock, I thought the end result was a little salty (not really for my taste because I like salty, but maybe for other people). In general though, I thought this recipe had excellent flavor and was very easy, just time consuming. I did have to caramelize my onions for about 90 minutes to get them to the right color and consistency. Do not skimp on the time.

Rating: 3
This is the best french onion soup recipe I have come across yet. Like many, I replaced the white wine with red. I also used chicken stock in place of the water. I believe the keys to this soup are in allowing plenty of time for the onions (mine took 3 hours to caramelize) and making it a day ahead to allow the flavors to develop properly. Ignore the 45 min active time listed with this recipe - you will not be happy with how it turns out in that small amount of time. When reheating the next day, I added a pinch of dark brown sugar because I felt the sweetness of the onions needed to be just a bit more pronounced. I will make this again for sure.

Rating: 4
This soup was wonderful and flavorful. I can't figure out how, if cooked according to the recipe, it could possibly be bland. The onions MUST be cooked down. I added white wine in small amounts as they cooked down so that I could keep liquid in the pot. Other than that please follow the recipe. I also made cheesy croutons to float on top rather than to try to cover the ramekins with cheese and bread.

Rating: 4
I adore onion soup and have eaten good and bad versions all over the world. I find this one exceptional. I agree with the other cooks who suggest that a bland soup must be the result of undercooked onions. You must cook them down till they are brown and sticky and sweet to the taste. Also be careful not to under-salt the recipe. I will add this recipe to my regular rotation. Everyone loved it.

Rating: 3
This soup is really good - even the kids liked it. Make sure and use a good beef stock and reduce appropriately to get the best flavor. I made it with white wine as per the recipe but I will make it with red wine next time. I think it will marry better with beef and onion flavor.

Rating: 3
This is classic French Onion Soup. It takes exactly as it should I don't see how anyone can think it's bland. It's excellent. Perhaps they weren't cooking the onions long enough. You have to cook them closer to two hours to get that deep golden brown colour without burning them.

I have to agree with the others who say this is very bland. This is a soup I've made many times from various recipes and have never encountered one as lackluster as this.

It wasn't terrible but it was flavorless, If it weren't for the cheese it would have been warm brown water. Sorry folks, I like a little more flavor!

Three forks, with some modifications. I had no fresh thyme, but figured given the cooking time, dried would work just as well. I used 1 lb Spanish onions and 1 lb sweet red onions.

Oh my. This was my first attempt making this and it turned out so very good. I didn't have fresh thyme, so substituted 1 tsp. Herbs De Provence. That was the only substitution.

About 10 years ago, while on an extended holiday through Europe, I found myself in Paris, France and wanting to try a traditional French Onion Soup (I had never had it before). I ordered it at a restaurant and can only describe the culinary experience as very disappointing. Some years later I found and purchased a cook book from a 2nd hand and collectible shop by Gretta Anna Teplitzky with a similar recipe to the one published here but this one has, bacon, english mustard, chicken stock as the primary liquid and the one thing that gives it the flavor depth it deserves...8 tablespoons of Cognac (or brandy for the budget minded). This version will absolutely knock your sox off and have your dinner guests asking when they are coming over again (gets annoying sometimes) LOL. I can post it if there is any interest or would that be in breach of copyright?

This is a good, solid recipe as is. I do like having some meat actually in my French onion soup, something I had first tasted in a Parisian brasserie. So I will sauté stew meat in the stockpot until you have a marvelous sticky beef residue and browned beef cubes. Then I add the sliced onions and caramelize, and continue with the recipe as is. Instead of white wine, you can add red for a richer flavor. I opted also to use more broth instead of water.

This soup was amazing. When i make it again I will make at least a double batch. I cooked the onions for about an hour until they were very caramelized. I also used thyme from the garden and stripped the leaves from the sprigs lightly crushed them and left them in the soup. I also opted to pour a little olive oil over slices of a freshly made rustic Italian boule and broil them until they were crispy. I also served the soup with a healthy dose of swiss cheese. It was a huge hit.

Made this soup following SF Chef's alterations. The only exceptions are (1) did not use shitake mushrooms and (2) added 3 instead of 2 TBSP of balsamic vinegar. We loved the soup! Not too salty and the onions are heavenly. One thing to remember is to wash the broiling process. Ours got a little burnt -- put it in for 2 minutes without watching.

Thanks to the recommendations of others on this site I had a successful first French Onion Soup experience. Admittedly, I started with only an excess of shallots leftover from Christmas and NO onions. Decreased butter to 3 TB (before I read reviews).

Thanks to all of you for your suggestions! I used the parmesan rind, and the chicken bone. Delicious!! I did the same thing with the Quick Minestrone, with fantastic results.

Thanks again everybody!

I thought this was excellent. I only made a few minor modifications. I used fresh-picked thyme and doubled the amount. I didn't put in sprigs, I actually removed the leaves and left them in the soup as opposed to removing them towards the end. I skipped the bread and just used shredded Swiss cheese before going under the broiler. I also used very pungent onions and upped the amount just a little. (I like oniony soup.) I cooked the onions about 90 minutes, but at a low-medium temp so they didn't caramelize too much - just a golden brown. Next time I'll cook them as long but I'll raise the temp at the end so that they get some more color. I was happy with the white wine. I used a Pinot Noir. The next time I think I'll try something very dry. I will definitely cook this one again. I used Mexican salt and I'll probably up the amount just a little bit the next time. The soup was on the sweet side. I might also try the garlic some have suggested because I'm a huge garlic fan . . . but I kind of liked the simplicity of the undoctored version.

This was incredible, but I made a lot of changes. It would have been boring made as is. I followed a lot of 'a cook from San Francisco's' advice. I added the garlic and shitakes.

I feel like I have to finally contribute because I have taken so many recipes from here and always read the blogs to find a better way of cooking. This recipe was okay when I made it the first time. The second it was stupendous. 1) I cooked 9 cups of sliced onion from my mandoline 10 minutes on high then for about an hour and a half on medium low. You need to carmelize them unitl they are caramel in colour as another reviewer suggested. Just use 2 tablespoons of olive oil. 2. After caramelization I added 5 cups of shitake mushrooms. sounds weird but its great. I cooked them for ten minutes. 3) Then I added garlic and thyme and cooked it for 2 minutes. 4) Added dry sherry instead of white wine and a little extra cooked 2 more minutes. as other suggested. 5) Added the broth and a cup extra as well as chicken bones from my butcher which added depth to the stock. I simmered for an hour and a half. 6) Added 2 tablespoons of balsamic and the rind of the parmesan. let it sit over night. 7) Finished it as directed the next day. Rediculously good. French Onion is a time consuming dish. The shitakes added some depth and earthiness to the soup. yum! PS No flour! No butter! Season at the end with salt and pepper as needed not at the beginning.

This was awesome. I did make a few changes - I added some garlic, used red wine, less water than called for, and I also copied another reviewer, and added a bit of sherry to the bowl before adding the soup. So good. I served with a iceberg/bleu cheese wedge for an old school feel - Yum!

I usually make up the carmelized onions and then add that to a crock pot with the broth and cook on low for like 5 hours.

I made corned beef last week and saved the broth to make this soup. Its just wonderful, less salty, more flavorful, and really easy. Just be sure to strain it and throw away the old seasonings. I followed other writers suggestions and used half the butter, red wine, and a touch of garlic. If it were summer, I would have followed the recipe and used white but for a warm winter LA night the red was perfect. I used white oven safe bowls (like corning ware, but generic) and the presentation was very impressive. I would definitely recommend this recipe to people who like to invite friends for dinner but have limited budgets. They will love it, and even your too skinny, perpetually on a diet, friends will not want to resist. Yum!

Instead, follow the aspect of the recipie which says to cook the onions until the entire mixture is caramelized -- not just lightly brown but turned the color of an actual caramel (which really takes about 2 hrs). If you have a cast iron french or dutch oven, I strongly suggest that you use it; a heavy-pot helps enormously in creating excellent caramelization without blackened- burning (lodge and the martha stewart collection at macy's offer economical options for cast iron)!! As with all soups, this becomes all the better the next day. The caramelized flavor has an amazing depth that resonates across one's palate.

I found the recipe as written to be bland and without any richness. It needs the additions the other reviewers mentioned -- red wine substitution, beef stock or veal stock in place of chicken, and sherry and/or brandy added as well.

I made two pots of this soup simultaneously. In one, I followed the recipe as written (with the exception of using only chicken stock). In the other, I followed the advice of several other reviewers and used red wine, not white, and added balsamic vinegar (about 2 TBs). To be fair, I ran out of the organic chicken stock I usually use, so in the pot of soup where I followed reviewers advice, I used Kitchen Basics chicken stock. It actually tests a lot better. Any way, the pot of soup where I followed the recipe exactly came out bland and not even resembling French onion soup. In the pot of soup where I took the other reviewers advice, the soup really tasted like French onion soup. Like I said, it couldve been the chicken stock, but it was far superior. I would strongly recommend substituting red wine for the white and adding a couple of splashes of balsamic vinegar.

Excellent, However I STRONGLY recommend substituting Dry Sherry for white wine and double the amount.

YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS DISH!!! My husband asked me to make french onion soup...which I never have had let alone prepare...and I came across this recipe. All I can say is this was amazing. Even my neighbor was raving about the taste. My husband wants this to be a regular rotation in our dinner recipes...so does my neighbor!

My husband and I both enjoyed this soup. Easy to make, tastes great. I expected that it would yield a larger quantity though. Going into my recipe rotation.

Worth the wait! I didn't have the cheeses, but substituted mozzarella instead. Great blend of flavors!

Simple and delicious. Was worth the price of the ramekins for sure.

Excellent! I also used Julia Child's trick of 1 T brandy in each bowl before ladling the soup in - yum! I did not make other changes to the soup itself, and after making it per the recipe did not feel it needed changing a bit. Re: the flour, true that it does not add flavor, but it gives a bit of body to the soup. I like it in there. I did use sourdough bread and Appenzeller cheese, and it was truly fabulous!

Fabulous. This is not an authentic rating, because I substituted red wine and omitted the flour and parmesean, but I loved it so much that I couldn't resist raising my forks (all four of them!)

I followed the advice of others and added some balsamic to this. Absolutely amazing.

Oh my gosh!!!! I used 1/11/07 (Julia Child) suggestion on putting some brandy in the bottom of the soup bowl before ladeling the soup. WOW!!! I could eat this for days and not be tired of it.

This was great! I used red wine instead of white, seems like a no-brainer. Also used leeks, shallots, and green onions instead and halved croissants in the same manner as the crostini.

Excellent dish!! I love the simple straightforwardness of this recipe. The long, slow cooking time of the onions is critical to success. Mine turned out a little salty, I added extra at the end which turned out to be unnecessary. Also, the cheese is somewhat salty, so be careful or you can mask the sweetness of the onions.

Great recipe and suggestions -- added a squirt of dijon and a heavy dash of balsamic. Had on hand 4 onions, 1 shallot and 4 boiling onions, used veg broth and threw in a rind of parm toward the end...tasty!

A classic onion soup, and it's even better if you mess with it a little. Left out the flour (who needs it?), and used chicken broth instead of beef. Added some chicken soup base (NOT a bouillon cube), some Dijon mustard, and just a little bit of balsamic vinegar as it was simmering for a bit of extra flavor. The best addition, however, is something that Julia Child recommends in her very first "Mastering the Art of French Cooking" -- put a tablespoon of brandy in the bottom of each individual crock before ladling in the soup and adding the croute and cheese for browning. Absolutely fabulous by the fire with a little salad and some great wine.

We have tried many different FOS recipes, but this is by far the best. I would not hesitate to make this again.

I made it with chicken broth, and it came out very good (though probably would be better with beef broth). I gave it 3 forks based on my first time making onion soup, but it could become a 4-fork recipe with practice.

I got great compliments with this recipe, and it was not at all difficult to make. The only tips I have may be obvious to you more experienced cooks out there: 1) Make a bouquet of the bay leaves and thyme, otherwise the thyme is difficult to remove. 2) Make sure your kitchen is well ventilated, or your house will smell like onions for days. 2 lbs is a lot of onions. Also, left-overs freeze nicely.
