Very good and I FORGOT to add the fresh basil! Duh! Definitely double the sauce-I did not have enough. This would be good leftover with the sauce over pasta as one reviewer suggested.

An excellent recipe and very simple too. The sauce may need a bit more stock and thickening to taste but I made it for a non-red meat eater with chicken stock and it was perfect. Highly recommended and can I suggest a nice stuffing made with bread, olives, any spare vegetables and an egg to bind? I tried it and it was delicious.

This recipe is delicious. I was a little disappointed though, but only because I did not make enough sauce for a 4.5 lb. bird. I should have known better. Next time I'll make more. Seriously this is great.

How could something so easy be so good? I agree with the previous reviewer - I'll go out of my way to use veal stock next time to see if I missed anything. I might also consider this sauce next time I make steamed mussels...definitely will want to double the amount of sauce for that though, so there'll be plenty to soak up with the bread. Yum!

I was in a bind and this recipe was my salvation. It is so quick and easy and absolutely scrumptious!!! My guests were really really late and I was afraid that my chicken was going to be dry dry dry but it was absolutely perfect. It kept in the oven at a lower temperature. I used chicken stock instead of veal and it was still delicious. I can't wait to make it again.

This was wonderful, I actually forgot to add stock at all and it still turned out great! Of course, next time I'll add the stock.

Delicious and fairly simple! I also had no veal stock, substituted chicken (I need to "stock up" on that frozen stuff!) I boned the chicken that was left and we had Provencale leftovers over pasta a couple nights later. It was well worth saving for the second meal.

Didn't have tomatos so I used some tomato sauce to at least try to balance things out. It was still delicious. I also used demi-glace and water instead of the veal stock. I was afraid that there were too many olives but it was very well balanced. I just need to cook a larger chicken next time :)

A marvelous blend of flavors. I've made this several times, and it's always a big hit with my family. I was out of the More Than Gourmet stuff that I usually use, so I substituted a blend of chicken (1/2 C) and beef (1/4 C) for the veal stock. A yummy dish that's easy to prepare!

Interesting blend of flavors. Couldn't find veal stock and didn't want to take the time to make it, so I used beef broth - came out fine. I will find veal stock next time to see what I missed.

This is a wonderful recipe and the veal stock is a critical ingredient. We will make this again.

Wow. When I served this to my husband, I was skeptical. The smell was so strong and perfume-y thanks to the olives and basil. I told him he might not like it. But once we tasted it, it was extraordinary. Such a delicious combo of flavors, very fragrant and pleasing to the palate.
