I didn't (and still don't) understand why the bananas are cut lengthwise, rather than in slices, but it really doesn't matter, because it was all thrown away! None of us liked it. It basically turned out like warm, mushy bananas with a mediocre crumble top. We'll not be making this again.

I hate to say something un-nice, but this was kinda gross. I don't know if it was my bananas or what. I followed the recipe exactly. It may be better with more butter flavor, more brown sugar, nuts &/or some chocolate chips. Maybe I'll try to doctor the rest to avoid wasting food, but I won't make it again.

Yum! An excellent way to use up those leftover fruits. I added raspberries over the bananas and the kids (& adults) loved it! Thank you for a child-friendly recipe.

I would change the 'buttering the pan' to using spray vege 'butter flavored' spray. This would be a good weight watchers recipe breakfast dish.
