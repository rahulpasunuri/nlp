Eh. Made it as suggested, and sauteed it instead of frying. Used a bit of extra sugar so sauce would be sweet. Catfish is just better fried and breaded or with corn meal or something else. The sauce was okay. It wasn't terrible, but I doubt I'll make it again.

Excellent! Added a little wasabi to the sauce to give it some kick. Broiled fish about 3 minutes per side. Served with steamed green beans. Low carb, low cal and DELICIOUS! What a winner of a recipe.

Let's be honest...the low number of reviews made this recipe a question mark. But I had chives and the other ingredients on hand so I tried it. This is really good! As reviewers recommended, I doubled the ginger, quadrupled the garlic. I added lime zest to get better lime flavor. I sauteed the fish in a nonstick skillet with olive oil rather than frying it. This has intense flavor for only a little work.

BTW - I think some of the low ratings may be due to use of plain rice vinegar and not seasoned rice vinegar - they are way different. The plain is clear and light and the seasoned is dark and more flavorful. I also used four times more garlic and and double the ginger - no regrets. Great.

Restaurant-quality flavor - wow! Easy and tasty. Substituted organic sugar for brown sugar and green onions for chives - not 'cause they're better - only 'cause thats all I had. Still came out phenomenal!

Not such a great result. My sauce wasn't "slightly sweet," in fact not sweet at all though I thought I followed the recipe perfectly. The fish was, on the other hand, cooked perfectly and very tasty. I'll make the fish like this again, but not the sauce.

Loved the chive ginger sauce, but frying the fish is NOT neccesary. We have served the sauce with catfish that has been grilled and another time, lightly pan sauteed in a little butter and olive oil both with great (and healthier)results.

Used Northern Pike instead of the catfish but otherwise followed the recipe and it was delicious! My husband and 2.5 yr old both loved it.

Amazing, simple, and fast. I added a tablespoon of finely chopped Thai basil and it rocked. Don't use Italian basil.

The sauce is delicious and so easy! Per a previous reviewer's recommendation, I'll bet it would be fantastic with grilled fish.

Fantastic flavor and oh, so easy. My partner loved it and he really doesn't like catfish.

Tasty, nice and light also. The 2nd time I made it I used tofu instead of fish...and it was great too.

This is a huge hit at my house! I'm a Chef so am rarely home to make dinner, but when I am, I love finding recipes that are quick to put together and have a lot of flavor! I make this quite frequently and it never gets old!

This sauce was amazing... even without a "key" ingredient. I had no soy sauce, so I supplemented extra ginger, lime, & vinegar. I wouldn't change a thing! I also grilled the catfish... no need to fry it.. this was perfect!

This recipe was excellent. The flavors blended really well together. I would prepare this for company, was well, because it was very simple, with that "special occasion" taste. It took a little more preparation time than what I was looking for, but it was worth every minute. My husband, who does like fish, really enjoyed it. I will definetely be making it again.

I rarely give out 4s, but this catfish recipe was so easy with results that I could not believe! The sauce is excellent. I don't think that I could go on and on about it enough. I did fry the fish in less peanut oil, but I don't think that really mattered as far as taste goes. From now on, I'm making catfish this way! I may even make again this week (it's THAT good).

Very easy and quick. The sauce is delicious with the fish, but could easily accompany chicken, veggies, gyoza, etc.

Terrific -- maybe a little less soy sauce next time, but overall a great mix of flavors. You can pan-fry in much less peanut oil than instructed and still get great peanut flavor.

I think the sauce is terrific. The rest of my family didnt care for it, so they used tartar sauce and hot sauce. I would make it again but only for myself. It would make an excellent sauce for steamed with pan fried dumplings.

This was FANASTIC and so quick and easy! To make it healthier I pan fried with cooking spray, 4 min each side and it was delicious. The sauce is great, I substituted 1/4 tsp of ground ginger for the fresh. I also used the sauce as a dressing for fresh tomato/yellow bell pepper side dish with the fish. Highly recommended!

WONDERFUL!! This was so simple and came out great! I thought it might be a bit heavy on the chives, but worked fine. I did soak the filets in milk for a couple of hours first (to make nice and moist, also if fresh caught takes out lake/river taste for any fresh water fish). Think will try sauce over BBQ shrimp!!

Outstanding!!! I have made the sauce several times for catfish and other fish and I love it.

Outstanding Sauce! The sauce takes about 1 minute to make, and frying the catfish is a total of 10 minutes, with about 5 mintes to dredge in the flour. I didn't have fresh chives or ginger. I substituted 1 teaspoon of powdered ginger, and 4 teaspoons of dried chives instead of the fresh. I also used plain white vinegar instead of white rice vinegar. The peanut oil is a must, because it adds a nice nutty flavor to the fish. There was excess sauce, and stir frying your vegetables with about 1/4 cup of the sauce would be a great complement to the dish! This is an incredibly flavorful dish which is really easy and quick to make. It would impress anyone!

Fantastic!!! I followed the recipe to the letter, although I doubled the sauce, as we like a bit for dipping. The tangy, slightly spiced sauce was a perfect complement to the light, crispy fish. I also made cocktail and tartar sauce which sat untouched!! I will definately make this again!

This recipe was so easy and aside from the catfish, most of the items you readily have on hand. It was a flavorful dish that is very versatile. Even my son, age 2, liked it.

This sauce is fabulous. I served the fish atop a bed of finely shredded cabbage and carrot and the sauce made a tangy dressing. Nice cool and crunchy addition next to the fish.

First of all, there is no need to fry the catfish! I used a non-stick grill pan for a much healthier version. The dish is delicious - really restaurant quality. The sauce has a lot of punch, so you might consider passing it to allow your guests to decide how much they'd like. I served with rice and sugar snap peas sauteed with shallots, salt and pepper.

Like another reviewer, I used our "George Forman" grill instead of frying it. It came out fantastic & not as greasy. I was surprised with how tasty it was. My husband wanted more, so I gave him half of mine. :(

A good and different recipe for catfish. The sauce takes only a few minutes to prepare. I found myself wishing that the sauce was a little thicker, but that's carping; it really was tasty. My dinner guest raved about it. I think the sauce would be fine on just about any kind of fish, and if used for salmon or tuna, a touch of wasabi paste might add a nice touch.

A very delicious recipe. Not at all "fishy" tasting. I omitted the garlic as I halved the recipe for a single serving. The ginger/soy combo was very flavorful.

One word...Fabulous! This dish was surprisingly tasty for the amount of effort needed to prepare. Great dish for any setting. Also, green beans definitely complemented the flavors.

This was a great catfish recipe that even my non-fish loving wife very much enjoyed. I cooked the fish on a two-sided indoor grill without the peanut oil to cut down on some calories and did not have fresh chives or ginger so I substituted powdered ginger (about 1/2) and dried chives. The taste was fantastic. I recommend serving with wasabi mashed potatoes and even putting a small amount of wasabi powder into the sauce for a little flair!

I can't believe that I'm only the second to rate this recipe. I think it is wonderful. Any mild fish will work, even shrimp! My husband even likes it and he's not a "fish at home" kind of guy. I only use enough oil to coat a nonstick pan and have never used the peanut oil. This is a keeper.

I usually do not like soy sauce recipes, but this one was very good. Make ahead so the favors have time to blend. Catfish was wonderful.
