I have made this dessert four times and it is one of the most delicious desserts ever. Everyone asks for the recipe including my daughter's french relatives. It is time consuming but worth every moment.

Loved it. Easy to make. The cookies were hard to find...ok impossible here. Used wonderful Colorado peaches and it was yummy. I didn't bother with the whipped cream. It seemed to be over kill!

Yum. Can't go wrong with this one - didn't even roast the peaches as they were farm fresh and at peak ripeness. Friends loved the no-bake peach pie for summer. Used my own homemade ice cream as well. Made it extra fluffy!

I agree not to let the ice cream get too soft or it gets grainy. Did not bother with the whipped cream as it was rich enough. Plan ahead for freezing time, more like the day before. I would make again!

Used 1/2 the amount of sugar with peaches. Be careful with consistency of ice cream - do not let it get too soft as I did. Instead of sugar with the whipped cream I used a little amaretto.
