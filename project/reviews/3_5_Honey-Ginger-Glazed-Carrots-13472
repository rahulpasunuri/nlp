sorry but this was not good! i love ginger so this sounded great but the ginger overpowered the carrots & was all you could taste. maybe using much less would make a difference but i'd rather just find another carrot recipe.

This recipe was in the section for the Jewish High Holidays..it contains butter...can't serve this as a side with meat...Strictly speaking, of course..I used vegetable oil..

3.5 stars. Everyone loved these carrots, I served them with the Macaroni & Cheese with poblanos recipe, and they were a hit! I doubled the sauce, that's a must. You could even triple it. A pinch of cinnamon works really well in this.

My husband loved these! I only used about 1/2 tsp of ginger and I added about 2 tblsp of brown sugar. I didn't bother with the stove and simply put the glaze in the microwave for about 30 seconds on high twice. I served them with the 'Grandma's Cornish Game Hens', wild rice and whole wheat honey rolls. What a hit! This will definitely become a regular...

Tried this recipe for Thanksgiving and it didn't go over too well. People either complained that there was too much ginger in the carrots or those who did not care for ginger wouldn't eat them. Anyhow, will try this recipe again for the family, using less ginger as one member stated.

My kids loved these, though I have cut down on the amount of ginger. This is the only way I will eat carrots (besides raw). I make this all the time; easy clean up quick prep and most of all the taste!

Perfect for a weeknight side dish.

My husband has complained about my brown sugar carrots, but loved these. I had a compliment from another "part time" chef, so I guess these will be a keeper. Easy to prepare. Doubled the sauce.

This was OK, a simple way to dress up carrots.

Thank you Texas...That little bit of advice is one of the best tips I have heard in a long time. Thanks again, I will make this tonight and use my garlic press....How 'bout them Cowboys.I made this last night and I did not think it was great. I prefer some brown sugar and butter.

One of my favorite ways to do carrots. I always use baby carrots for ease of preparation. One other little trick I use is to squeeze the gingerroot through a garlic press like you would a clove of garlic. It makes a nice ginger mush which mixes with the butter and honey much easier.

Great recipe - will make again and again. Served at a dinner party and got lots of compliments.

I made these for Easter using Baby Carrots. They were excellent and everyone wanted the recipe. We will definitely have them again.

I don't like cooked carrots, but LOVE this! There will not be leftovers! I added a touch of cinnamon and would do it again!

I made these for a large party and everyone enjoyed them. Many went back for seconds, and many asked for the recipe. I don't usually even care for cooked carrots, and I enjoyed them as well. I made 15 pounds(!) of them about an hour or so ahead of time and kept them in a foil pan covered w/ a towel, then served in a chafing dish. The carrots stayed warm and didn't even get mushy. Very simple, even in those large proportions.

great glazed carrot recipe. Not one was left after dinner. We will definitely keep this one for Christmas!

So tasty and easy..use baby carrots and make them prior to your lunch/dinner and just reheat. There are no leftovers with this veggie dish.

Easy, quick, & flavorful. I used baby carrots and melted the butter with the honey in the microwave for 25 seconds.

The ginger freshened up this simple, common dish. Forget the cutting; using pre-packaged baby carrots couldn't be easier.

Great, easy dish - I made it the night before and reheated it in the microwave for my son's birthday party. All 18 adults and 6 toddlers ate it up - subtle glaze doesn't overpower the carrots but enhances the sweetness. I too used "baby-cut" carrots. Couldn't be easier!

A great spring veggie dish, would have liked the sauce to be a little thicker, however, not a bit was leftover!!

A wonderful side to most any meal. I used prepackaged "baby-carrots" to cut the preparation time. The ginger flavor was subtle and well balanced with that of the honey. An easy yet elegant dish which I'll definitely serve again. My wife loved it!

Quick and tasty; I'll certainly will make this again but use slightly less honey in future. This dish also tastes good cold, and it re-heats very well in the microwave.
