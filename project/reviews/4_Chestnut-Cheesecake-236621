Sorry -- catching up my recipes. Made this for Christmas dinner and it was outstanding! At the time I couldn't find chestnuts and ended up paying a ridiculous sum--now I see chestnuts everywhere.

I served this as the ending to our Christmas Day dinner of braised goose with fig and port sauce, roasted butternut squash risotto and string beans with garlic and lemon. This cheesecake is wonderful! Great taste and texture. I am a timid baker, but found this easy to make and I was surprised that even I was able to make it come out perfectly. We didn't finish it on Christmas, so I froze the rest to use on New Year's Eve - all I have to do is make more syrup and I can enjoy it once again.

It was great! I made this cheesecake for a "cheesecake contest" at work. This was my "sophisticated" entry. I could not find sweetened chestnut puree so I made a simple sugar syrup and mixed it with the puree. The result was delicious. I was very pleased with the recipe - not too sweet, great texture, and the base was just a little different. Yum. It did not need the syrup but the addition was notable. No, it did not win, but the epicureans among the taster's were impressed.

Well, unlike most of the other reviewers I actually made the recipe as directed and it was absolutely the perfect end to the dinner! Ive nothing against tinkering with recipes -- I do it myself quite often, but I am rather amazed at those who start out I didnt do this, and left out that, and I changed this and then pretend to be reviewing this recipe. Youre not. Write your own and post it.

We are big fans of chestnuts. I used about 2/3 Graham Crackers and 1/3 Ginger Snaps. I put whole roasted chestnuts on the top and cut down on the sugar in the sauce. Everyone loved it. Yes, it is expensive to make, but something special and different for the holidays. Sent the recipe to my niece in Amsterdam. I am waiting to see how it was recieved by her finicky dinner guests.

Wonderful, easy recipe for an impressive and festive cheesecake. Chestnut puree was a lot easier to find than I expected. In the future, I would cut down the sugar in the cake itself, since the syrup is so sweet. I felt like the sweetness of the cake overshadowed the syrup, making the syrup seem frivolous. Will definitely make it again!

Ehh, it was okay, I guess. I went to four different stores looking for the chestnut puree. When I finally found it, it cost me $12.99. The result was fine - not nearly amazing enough to be worth the trip around town and the extra money.

This was incredible! I prefer a tart cheesecake, so added in a lot more lime juice, even a sprinkling of zest....the chestnut puree was very sweet so perhaps the two balanced each other. I put in a little less sour cream and added marscapone - not sure if that really did anything but it tasted wonderful in the end. The base was incredible, the bath worked wonders (no cracks) and the cheesecake was a lovely dark rich colour. My guests loved it and I would definitely make it again.

Silky, unctuous, delicately flavored with that little hmmmm of rum.

When my brother-in-law says: "This cheesecake is actually really good. I'd like the recipe," that's serious praise! I made this cheesecake with a whole can of *unsweetened* chestnut puree (425 mL minus the 2 tablespoons required for the base and the syrup). The result was a tender and creamy cheesecake with a distinct yet subtle chestnut flavour. I didn't use the bain marie baking method. Instead, I baked it at a 300 for 90 minutes and then at 325 for another 30 minutes. I wasn't a big fan of the syrup. Glaceed chestnuts would make a tasty decorative topping and provide a good textural contrast.

Very nice. I left out the lime juice because everyone else did, and I wonder what it could possibly have added to the dish. I couldn't find sweetened chestnut puree, so I made my own from jarred chestnuts, rum, honey and a little water. Good! In place of graham crackers, I used Anna's Cinnamon Almond cookies and some almonds, ground in the food processor. Loved the result. The cake filling I followed as written. I swirled the puree in and it left a pretty swirl pattern. Made the syrup as written, and dunked whole chestnuts in and decorated the cheesecake with them. It looked fantastic! Cake is not tall. Has a lovely, sophisticated taste. Some of my guests were a bit wary of it, though, never having had chestnuts.

This is utterly amazing. I've never made cheesecake before, and my spring form pan leaked! And half my cake fell out as i was trying to "drain" it over the sink. Even though, I salvaged a giant catcher's mitt sized portion of the cake in my hand, served on graham crackers, and the sauce was AMAZING. The cake is not too sweet, thank goodness. I did not use lime or rum, since the mixture was looking thin, I used agave instead of superfine sugar. I just can't wait to make this cake and see what it's really supposed to taste like! And...DO NOT BUY CHESTNUTS in the shell, it will take 6 hours to make as a newbie!

I made this cheesecake for Christmas last year and it was excellent - easy, beautiful, and delicious. My family loves cheesecake and the chestnuts make this one special. I left out the lime juice because it didn't seem necessary and I used a good bought caramel sauce instead of the syrup to save time.
