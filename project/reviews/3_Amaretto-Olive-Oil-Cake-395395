This was amazing. Light, moist with just a little bit of texture from the almonds. Sweet, but not overly so. I served it with strawberries. It's a great dessert and also goes well with coffee / hot tea (eg. breakfast bread). Will probably try to make it gluten-free by substituting (weight not volume equivalent) tapioca flour for the 1/4 cup of all-purpose.

I actually made this recipe tonight! I served it with fresh raspberries and blackberries. The cake is delicious, airy and moist as promised. My family rated it 4 forks for a Passover recipe -- and agreed it would be 3 1/2 if not Passover. This cake would be even more delicious with a bit of a coulis on the side which I will most definitely make next year.

This looks delicious, but because the rating is only 1-1/2 forks I might not have even tried it - this is because SOMEBODY rated it without even trying it!

He is right. It's bad for the users if people rate a recipe they didn't try.

You ignoramus. Don't give a review if you haven't made it.

The recipe very clearly states 4 egg whites.

This is just a guess, but I would try five egg whites. I'm thinking the ingredients list should read, "5 eggs, separated" instead of "5 egg yolks."

This sounds like it could be a great Passover recipe and I really want to try it but I am confused about the ingredient list-- no mention of how many egg whites. Any more info?
