This recipe was absolutely delicious! Being a child of the '60's, I never follow directions completely. I substuted the Thyme and Basil for Herbs de Province. I used Beef Better than Bullion instead of low sodium broth. To compensate, I elimitated all other salt from the dish. The sauce was great, but not thick enough for my taste, so I added a dollop of corn starch and - just for a kick- about a teaspoon of sour cream. I also rubbed the beef before resting with corn starch. I found it puts a nice sear on meat. Lastly, I rested the eye for 4.5 hours, rather than the 1 hour the recipe recommends. The eye of round was so beautiful, I feared it would be too tough. I highly recommend this recipe to anyone who wants to do up an eye of round roast in style.

I've made this roast many times and it is elegant, simple, flavorful and low in calories. A couple of things to bear in mind -- it is important to utilize dried herbs as opposed to fresh so they adhere to the roast. Browning the roast on all sides beforehand is also important. Eye of round is best medium or medium rare, sliced thinly or it will become tough. If you are looking for a roast with potatoes and gravy this is not for you. If you are looking for an elegant roast with a caper dijon sauce, then you will love it and so will your spouse.

My family really enjoyed this dish. A little much work and time for a week night, but kind of special for a weekend, and well worth it. I used a chuck roast instead, turned out great. These people do not normally enjoy capers. Served with mashed potatoes, green peas, a tossed salad and a Malbec Argentinian red.

I changed the recipe slightly by adding another tablespoon of the dijon mustard. The sauce was fantastic! But I was not happy with the beef. Next time I would use a beef or pork tenderloin.

I thought this was very good, but it doesn't beat out a good horseradish sauce IMO. The sauce was interesting and nice, but not spectacular. The capers and beef broth made it a bit too salty.

I really enjoyed this roast, very flavorful and economical. I purchased one that was just under 2 lbs, yet I kept the seasonings as listed. Covered with foil and cooked in counter top convection oven, so the timing was a bit different. The sauce was a real winner.I browned the butter prior to whisking in the flour, and added fresh mushrooms about 3 minutes before removing from heat. I agree the meat must be sliced thinly. Didn't give 4 forks b/c it seemed to generate a lot of dishes. Don't let that deter you, as I generate a sink full making coffee.=)

Here in Jordan I wasn't sure the cut of meat actually was an eye of round but it seemed to be. The sauce was fantastic and my husband finished the serving bowl of it while I was clearing the table. You do need to cut the meat thinly. The meat is lean so you don't have to feel too guilty and it has a lot of flavor. I just threw on some kosher salt and thyme (didn't have dry basil). The browning is essential and I did what another reviewer did which was put the meat in a roasting pan with potatoes and an onion, reserving the frying pan for the sauce. The meat did not give off much dripping anyway in the roasting pan or at least the meat I had didn't. My husband kept saying, This is special through the whole meal and he ate the capers though he asked me if they were peppers.

I and my family simply loved this reciepe. Instead of eye of round, we used prime rib, as well as top round the other times. The sauce is really important. I used Kosher salt and probably a little more dijon than called for, but it was simply amazing. Even my 3 year old loved it.

I followed the recipe exactly. However, ended up having more company than I expected for the size roast I used. I opted to use the recipe as ingredients for a sandwich instead. To do this, I sliced the meat really thin, added a small amount of the caper sauce on the bottom portion of a ciabatta bun, topped with a slice of havarti cheese, then the sliced meat, some carmelized onions and ground pepper, topped it off with the top of the bun and served. It was a huge hit and I will make it again and again!

I don't get the hoopla. It definitely wasn't my ingredients, either. I used fresh herbs from my garden as well as ones I had dried only earlier in the week. The meat itself was local farm fresh and only killed a month ago. The mustard was from a local organic wine vineyard and the beef stock was from the same cow as the meat... and yet it was incredibly average. I've made better roasts by simply throwing everything in the oven with some potatoes and carrots and waiting an hour then making gravy from the juices. I thought this recipe was incredibly overrated and yes, it was pretty tough as well. The sauce was okay, nothing special. Overall, I give this a solid "Meh"

Loved this recipe! The only change I made was by using Italian seasoning and kosher salt. I didn't have beef broth so I substituted with vegetable. I sauteed the beef in a wrought iron skillet. Then I placed the well browned beef in another pan for baking. I made the sauce in the same skillet that the meat was browned in. The flavor of the meat and the sauce was amazing! I will definitely make this again. Everyone at the table loved it!

I am glad I made this before looking at the reviews. I thought it was wonderful and I am picky. It was more tender than I expected and was simple and elegant. Made for a dinner party and would make again. Did not change anything and I think that for those who thougt it was too salty perhaps they used capers in brine and did not rinse.

Tried this with bottom round as one reviewer suggested and it was horrible. Looked like a gorgeous medium-rare roast from resting to slicing to plating, but was so tough I found it almost inedible. Too bad I wasted a perfectly good dinner party, did not find sauce very tasty either.

This recipe is delicious, easy, and was even a hit with my picky bf who likes plain food. I made a few changes but basically followed the recipe. I salted the raw roast with 1 T kosher salt for 4 hours at room temp. I quartered 4 fairly large yukon (yellow) potatoes plus 3 peeled carrots and an onion and tossed the vegetables in a roaster with a couple of tablespoons of olive oil, then added 1/2 t herbes de province and ground pepper. Roasted the vegetables for about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, seared the salted eye of round roast as directed for about 10 minutes. Placed the roast in the roasting pan surrounded by the roasting potatoes and vegetables. Sprinkled meat on all sides with 1 teaspoon herbes de province, 1 teaspoon dried thyme and some ground pepper. I inserted a temperature probe set to alert at 130 degrees internal temperature, then placed in the oven. I started the sauce in the pan in which I had seared the meat. I did not add any extra salt to the aauce as the mustard and capers contain plenty of salt. When the roast reached 130 degrees, I removed it from the oven and allowed it to rest for around 10 minutes while finishing the sauce before slicing the meat very thinly. Delicious.

Very nice. I zipped it up the herb mix with 1/4 tsp ground white pepper, and 1/4 tsp of this Calcutta Lemon Mustard spice ... http://www.newworldspices.com/product_info.php?products_id=70 I also simmered some pfifferling mushrooms in the sauce. Covered at first, then opened to let it thicken up. Cheers! ~ NCF

I used a beef round tip roast and it turned out great. I prefer my roast on the medium rare side. I took it out when the thermometer read 135 degrees and the roast had a 3/4" gray band around the perimeter and was very pink in the middle. I think next time, I will sear the roast at a higher temperature on the stovetop to try to avoid the gray band.

I couldnt get a big enough eye of round so I used a bottom round and it turned out pretty good, slicing think is definitely key and the sauce was the star of the dish, I added shallots per another reviewer's suggestion and it was great. I also roasted it with carrots, potatos and a vadalia onion which was a good accompaniment. Next time might go with a little more flour and less reduction on the sauce because I didnt have quite enough...

I used this recipie for my first-ever attempt at cooking eye of the round, on a work day, when I had only 1 hour to get dinner on the table for my family of four. The meat was tender, juicy, and flavorful. The sauce was fantastic. The prep and cooking couldn't have been easier. My children asked for seconds! Fantastic recipie!

This was wonderful, simple and elegant - which you can't always say for pot roast. The sauce is the topper for sure. I added in quartered potatoes, carrots, a bit of garlic and sliced onions into the skillet after browning the meat. I took all these things out (of course) when I made the Caper Sauce but I think this added to the flavor. I also added some chopped shallots to the sauce. I cooked this rare but not stringy and sliced very thinly as suggested. Very good.

Easy, quick and economical. I get sick of mustard sauces and didn't have capers anyway, so omitted those ingredients from the sauce and, at the end, added 1/2 cup red wine. I simmer it a little after adding the wine. Great flavour.

I love this recipe. It's simple and delicious. I used a top round roast instead of the eye because I feel the layer of fat on the top round makes the meat more tender. Also, instead of searing it in a pan, I put the roast in a 425 degree oven for 20 minutes. I then reduced the temperature to 350 and roasted until the probe thermometer read 130 degrees. It was perfect!

We really enjoyed this. A great solution for a difficult cut of meat! We get our meat grass-fed from a local farm, so it is sweeter and "beefier' tasting than store meat, and also tougher. I was so sick of braising, or making pot roast just to make the farm meat tender! This was delicious. Definitely make the sauce...it is a great compliment to the meat! (And helps steamed broccoli go down for picky eaters...) ;) The meat seasoning also works well if you use basil & CELERY Seed (instead of thyme).

I LOVE capers and was sure I'd love this dish. I was half way done preparing it when I realized that I had run out of capers, so I made it exactly as directed but without the capers. It was delicious regardless. Everyone thought the dish was wonderful, including the kids.

This was fantastic. I was serving for this to guests so I was a very concerned about it being tender. I have not had luck with roast beef in the past unless it was a prime rib. Prime rib is too expensive and too fatty. I first used a jacard tenderizer to puncture the meat. It was wonderful and the sauce is excellent too.

I just saw this cut of beef done on America's test kitchen. Their solution for the toughness was salting the meat 18-24 hours before cooking. They also slow cooked the meat at 250 until the meat reaches 115 degrees center then they turned off the oven and let the meat cook the rest of the way to 130 degrees with the oven off. It looked delicious and tender on the show so I can't wait to try it.

This was delicious. I salted with Kosher salt a day in advance and added garlic powder to the herb mix. Then I cooked it at 325 which took a little longer but it came out perfect. It definitely needs to be thinly sliced but it is very tasty and the leftovers were great on sandwiches. The sauce is excellent and easy to make while the roast rests.

Cut of meat was very flavorful, but, it was pretty tough. I tried cutting it even thinner, and that helped a bit, but it was still tough. The gravy, on the other hand, was excellent.

This is really tasty considering the small number of ingredients used. The gravy was fantastic, and the leftovers froze and thawed well for another nights meal. Served it one night with roasted potatoes and another night with mashed - both worked well with the sauce

I made this dish for Christmas Eve dinner and thought it came out well. I really liked the sauce - but I tweaked it by using only half the mustard and adding red wine. I also thickened it a bit with a standard flour/water combo as the 1T of flour was not quite enough. I cut the meat thin and it was tender enough. If I make this dish again it will be with another choice of meat just for the sake of trying other options.

This was my first time cooking this cut of meat, so I thought it came out really great and it is an economical way to serve roast beef. I made a few adjustments. I used course sea salt to tenderize the meat while it came to room temp. Then I added some beef broth to the pan periodically while it cooked. I did slice it very thin and served it with home made bernaise sauce instead of the other. I put the leftovers in the pan with the broth and will use for french dip as another meal.

We love this recipe. The sauce, especially, is terrific! We make it exactly as written, with the exception of adding sliced mushrooms to the gravy. Two cautions, already mentioned, salt only after tasting the sauce, since capers are very salty. And use a meat thermometer rather than guessing. It comes out perfectly!

Rating: 3
Fandamntastic. Simple, relatively quick, and delicious. A meat thermometer takes the guesswork out of it. If your big frying pan doesn't have an ovenproof handle, you can still use it for the searing and then transfer the meat to a baking/roasting pan. Save the "burnts" in the searing pan by deglazing it with some broth or water and setting it aside till gravy-making time. I think this is going to be our standard Roast Beast from now on.

BTW, I do know how to spell recipe. Also 40 minutes is too long to cook, 30 is more like it.

My first encounter with eye of round roast. It is a very tough cut of beef, when they say slice thin, they mean it. Slice flank steak thin. I don't like dried basil, and this receipe indicates why. The basil over powers the flavor, and it is not especially pleasant. I would go with the dried thyme exclusively. The real star of the receipe is the sauce. Don't correct the seasoning until after the capers are added, as they are very salty and you may over salt the sauce. I might add three tablespoons of dijon, rather than two. This would be much better with a roast beef tenderloin, although the theme of the receipe was inexpensive cuts. I gave it three forks for its potential, the receipe as made would only be two.

Everyone liked the meat and the sauce. I have to say that the sauce can be salty due to the capers but I would make this again
