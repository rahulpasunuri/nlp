I usually make regular tamales with pre-made masa dough. Thought it would be fun to try these and a challenge to make the masa dough. I was very happy with how easy the dough was to make. Next time I'll only puree part of the corn and leave some whole. I added a cup of cooked chicken, could have used more. I kept adding spices - some cayenne, a Tbsp. of chipotles, home made chili sauce - trying to get more flavor. They were still rather bland for our taste. Adding the liquids softened the dough so that they took longer to cook. Now I know the dough should be fairly stiff, should have added more dry masa. I will make these again with all this in mind. If I add meat the next time it will be some that has been marinated in a spicy sauce. I don't have a lot of counter space and this needs a lot of room, also a lot of cleanup after, more than with regular tamales. But I liked mixing everything into the masa instead of doing the separate filling. Just have to work on the flavor.

My corn was frozen and not very sweet so I added a touch of sugar. This made all the difference. I didn't split the fillings I just put it all in one. definately don't over stuff because they really puff up.

I actually stuffed the tamales with chili colorado in order to make tamales. This is a great recipe for the masa.
