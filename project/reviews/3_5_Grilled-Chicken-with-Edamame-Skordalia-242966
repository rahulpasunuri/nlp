I cannot believe that anyone would find the skodalia "bland." I used 4 cloves of garlic and added more basil, but even so there was plenty of flavor without these. Often blandness means that there is not enough salt and pepper. But, this is amazing, and will be a standard go-to in our house.

I agree that the chicken is a bit less "wow" that the skordalia, which is awesome. However, it's easy. Good weeknight dinner.

4 forks for the yummy skordalia. Using what I had on hand I used parsley in place of basil and lima beans instead of edamame, and 4 cloves of garlic instead of 3. I thought it was delicious and will have it for lunch tomorrow as a dip with good bread. The chicken was tender but bland and I would not use the marinade again, but the skordalia is a keeper!

Great summer recipe - especially when you have basil growing in your garden. I neglected to reserve the cooking liquid, so I substituted vegetable broth stock and it added perhaps even more flavor to the skordalia.

The chicken was good but not great but the edamame skordalia was really delicious.

This was great. A little more time to make that I wanted to spend on a weeknight, but soooo worth it. My two kids, and my husband,gobbled this up!

The skordalia was delicious!!! This is a healthy low carb dish and will be a a week night staple as it was so easy and incredibly tasty & healthy (used fat free cheese) and inexpensive. Plenty leftover for lunches!

decided to make this dish tonight because of all of the great reviews. have to say I was incredibly disappointed. I followed the directions to a T, so maybe it could have been improved by some alterations to the recipe. the chicken was moist and well seasoned but considering that the edamame skordalia is supposed to add the wow factor I thought it was lacking. it tasted fine but I wouldn't want to eat a heap of it. pretty bland and all and all weird. I would make the chicken again but with a different side.

Love this recipe! I make it often on a weeknight due to how fast it is to prepare. My 2 year old can't get enough of the delicious skordalia.

My boys love this meal! Even my hubby, who is not a chicken lover, gives it a thumbs up. Great with grilled pita bread.

Delish! I really liked the Edamame Skordalia. I would try to marinate the chicken before throwing it on the grill.

Super easy and really flavorful! Pound those chicken breast flat to around 1/4". I did them on the stove in a grill pan and they took about 90 sec per side. The edamame skordalia was great (I used a tad extra garlic as is our preference; package directions called for 5 min of cooking then cooling with a cold water rinse. Room temp skordalia was fine). The basil oil should be left on the chicken for about 30 min prior to cooking. Add a bit more oil if you want a smoother skordalia (but really, it's not worth the extra calories). You'll make that as a dip on it's own because it's so good!

We are vegetarian, so I used homemade seitan chicken in this. It was so easy and really tasty, the edamame skordalia tasted so rich! Definitely a keeper.

YUM! Yes, this does indeed make lots of "sauce" but as I made mine more the consistency of a dip, I'm VERY happy to have leftovers. I used more garlic and more basil, plus I could only find 10- oz bags of the frozen edamame, so used 20-oz. Very flavorful.

I agree with other reviewers who said this recipe was wonderful - with additional garlic. I substituted fresh edamame for frozen with no problem. My guests couldn't stop raving about the Skordalia, and one mentioned that it could be used as a healthy dip as well, which I definitely agree with.

We were on vacation in a small town in North Carolina where we couldn't find edamame. We substituted lima beans and it was delicious. Usually lima beans aren't a big seller, but our guests literally licked their plates. Would definitely make this again.

This is a great twist on an old classic. I added more garlic, but overall this was great.

I thought this was quite good, but I agree....it makes way more than 4 servings of Skordalia. I cooked my edamame according to the package directions (5-6 mins) and I was fine. Other than that, I followed the recipe and found it delicious. Just garlicky enough not to be overpowering. Even my kids (ages 4 & 6) liked it! A fun, flavorful summer meal.

I doctored this one up - I added a bit of sea salt, more garlic and a little less water. It tasted great that way. I won't even try to stick to this recipe.

Agree - ratio is way off kilter. Serving 8,I doubled - BIG mistake. Consistency was not "dip"-like; maybe I needed to cook edemame longer. Even with garden-fresh basil and fresh Parmesan Reggiano, neither taste nor texture were worth the effort of preparing the dish - at best, bland. I won't make it again.

We really liked this recipe but needed to adjust the ratio of edamame to the rest of the ingredients in the skordalia. 16 oz of edamame made about 4 cups of skordalia - way too much for 4 people. I would suggest using 8oz oz shelled edamame and keep all the rest of the ingredients the same as in the recipe. The chicken was very moist and tasted great as leftovers.

This was fantastic! The skordalia was excellent- tasty and fresh and flavorful. I used chicken breast tenders and it was fun the arrange them on a pile of the skordalia.

This was such a great summer meal! I halved it since it was just my husband and I and I did end up using about 3/4 cup of the cooking liquid to get it to the consistency I wanted (that of a dip or really whipped potatoes) This dish was so full of flavor and felt so healthy. Next time I may finish it with some more parm, goat cheese or feta over the top of it all and some crostini to eat up the last of the "dip" portion. I will definitely be making this again.

Surprisingly good; the basil and garlic in the oil reserved for coating the chicken charred over the coals and added a good flavor. Make sure not to overcook the chicken when using direct heat on the grill; the half-breasts are ready to turn when they release from the grill surface. Turning them sooner rips the meat off (it sticks), and it will be dry and overcooked if one waits too long to turn or remove. The edamame skordalia was an interesting addition; it's a thicker bed to rest the chicken upon, much like rice. It's definitely thick - not like a traditional 'dip' as is described in the text. The soybean/edamame skordalia is tasty and would make a good addition or substitution as a bed for other main dishes. We'll make this again for sure.
