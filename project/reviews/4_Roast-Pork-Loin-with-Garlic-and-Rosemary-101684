Awesome. Followed other recommendations to add EVOO to herbs for an overnight marinade. Very few drippings, but added stock and balsamic mustard for a great pan gravy. Will be a staple for years to come!

This is a great recipe for a dinner party. I followed the other reviews and added a little bit of olive oil and grated lemon peel to the recipe and marinated for a few hours. I also made a very light gravy with the pan drippings to splash over the meat before serving.

I just wished that I had browned it before putting it in the oven. I did marinade it overnight with garlic, rosemary and olive oil which helped the flavor. It was pale but very moist. I pulled it at 140F which gave it just a bit of pink after sitting for 10 minutes. I did use a smaller pan which may have inhibited the browning while in the oven.

Simple yet fantastic flavor. This has made it into a weekly dish at our home, a favorite of all, including our picky kids. The only difference I make is to marinate it overnight, to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.

Made this tonight. Very good. I was worried there wouldn't be anything left to make the salad.

Tasty and worth making again! I used about a bulb of roasted garlic, which I made previously, and also added a chopped jalapeno pepper to the other ingredients in the food processor. The pepper added a little pop to the dish without hijacking the taste, and so I recommend it. We served the pork with roasted root vegs and pan-cooked chard.

I loved this recipe but altered it using the suggestions of other reviewers. I added lemon zest and olive oil to the garlic and rosemany. I then ran it through the blender. I made a sauce from the drippings to which I added a little water and sweet balsamic vinegar which I poured over the pork. I served this with roasted vegetables (white potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots and parsnips) which were seasoned with salt, pepper, thyme and oregano. It was a bigh hit and looked beautiful garnished with a rosemary branch, a slice of lime on a spear and cherry tomatoes for color.

Not for me. Recipe was simple enough,but end product was very boring and bland. I do admit however, my first thermometer reading showed it was not 155, so, I put it back in -- thereafter probably overcooked it slightly might have added to my displeasure.

Rating: 4
This was GREAT! The only thing different I did was to add a bit of olive oil, just for better smearability of the rosemary and the garlic. I made a mushroom/mustard/cream sauce to serve on the side with roasted brussel sprout, sprinkled with a bit of olive oil, salt, pepper and some pecan bits. DECADENT!

I used this recipe for a 5-6 bone 4# loin roast. I added lemon zest, a tablespoon of lemon juice, and olive oil to my rub. Started the meat at room temp and seared at 450 for 30 minutes. Then I turned the oven down to 340 degrees for approx 40 minutes and let it stand for 20 minutes. The roast was cooked to perfection - tender and juicy.

I've been searching for this recipe! Ever since we were served the most incredible pork roast for lunch a couple of years ago during a visit to Vinci in Tuscany, I've tried numerous methods and recipes to replicate that meal and THIS IS IT! It appears that the high heat and taking care not to overcook is the secret. I changed the herb mixture slightly - adding 2 small fresh bay leaves, the zest from one small lemon and binding it with olive oil (I was told by the chef's daughter what ingredients were in their mix). I poured some chicken stock over it at the 1/2 hour point, when I turned the roast and took it out of the oven when it reached 145 F and rested it for 10 minutes. Served it with roast potatoes, carrots and brussel sprouts, drizzling the precious drippings over the meat. FABULOUS! I will make this again (and again!)

Very simple to prepare and quite delicious. I usually used dried rosemary and 2 tsp of prepared crushed garlic with just 1tsp sea salt, not kosher salt

Wow--this was simple and delicious. I marinated one 3/4 lb. pork tenderloin in a tablespoon or two of olive oil, 3 cloves of crushed garlic, and several tablespoons of fresh rosemary overnight. I seared it in a pan for 2 minutes max on each side, then roast it in the oven at 350 degrees for just over 15 minutes to a temperature of 160 degrees. I served it with a bit of whole-grain mustard on the side--delicious! Made 3 small servings. I rarely make pork but this was definitely nice enough for a dinner party. Will try it again soon!

This was so incredibly easy and delicious! I also added a TBSP of olive oil to the garlic and rosemary. I didnt really have any drippings to make the pan sauce, but you didnt need it. Was so moist and delicious on its own. My husband said he would eat it every week and my 2 1/2 year old daughter loved it!

Really good, super easy. I added the olive oil and pulled it out around 140 as suggested. Super tender. I don't know that I've ever actually enjoyed pork loin before. Will definitely make again.

Had great results following advice from others. Brining helps as does marinating pork ahead of time and browning before it goes into the oven. Also, I'd definitely recommend pulling it out of the oven at 135 rather than 155 if you want it closer to medium rare. Good recipe for sure.

My boyfriend's mouth was drooling just from the smell when he walked in the house. He doesn't cook - but liked this so much he wanted to be able to make it for me sometime. It's easy enough so he can! Barely tweaked it - had some fresh thyme so added some of that and used garlic paste to help the ease of rubbing it in. Added some multi colored carrots sliced on a diagonal at the end, 10 minutes as they were small. They roasted in the juices and were delicious. Served with some mashed potatoes.

Rating: 3
Excellent recipe, and perfect for a busy weeknight when you still want an elegant meal. Since there's just 2 of us, I cut a 2.5 pork roast in half and roasted it. I used lots of garlic and rosemary sprigs fresh from my garden, and added a good bit of lemon zest as well. It was delicious! Served with crispy roasted fingerling potatoes and a piperade.

Rating: 4
I agree with almost all the other posters - this recipe is excellent mostly because with such simple prep, it yielded a truly delicious main course. I added a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil to the rub which made it easier to spread, plus it helped brown the loin beautifully! A friend recommended I brown it in a pan beforehand, but I must have had a particularly rich cut of meat because not only did I have a lot of drippings but the collected jus rendered the fat to a crispy crust while it was face down. I do think I need a better meat thermometer because sticking it in the center at the end of the recommended cooking time showed it to be barely 140, and ten minutes later it was still 140... until I stuck it into another part of the loin and it shot up to 160! As a result, I think it wasn't as moist as I would have liked it (it wasn't pink at all anymore) but it was still delicious.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe, quick, easy and I must agree the house smelled like a 5 star restaurant. We are definitely making this again for guests. We didn't get much juice as the pork roasts are now so lean. Would suggest cooking the roast less because it is so lean.

Terrific recipe! My spouse asks for it at least monthly -- we've been making it for years! But we like gravy (which sort-of ruins it as a "Cooking for Health" entree -- sorry, Marie Simmons!), so I deglaze the foil with 6-7 oz. water or sometimes half water, half wine, pour it into a small saucepan, add a half-teaspoon of chicken "Better Than Buillion," and stir in about 1-1/2 tblspn flour mixed with equivalent water. Stir until thickened, cover and simmer for a minute or two while the pork rests. Great company meal, goes with any potato or veg.

Just made this as per recipe on the Weber, rotisserie style. The pork loin had fat, scored, in the hope of getting some crackling, which didn't happen. Pork on its own was moist and OK, but with the drippings was superb. Quick to prep and recommended.

Boneless pork roasts are easy to carve, and I have no doubt that this recipe is delicious. But I did the same thing with a bone-in 4 lb, roast. Put it in fat side up, cooked it at 450 for 20 minutes, reduced the heat to 300 and cooked for just over an hour more. Unbelievably moist and flavorful. I would rather have the bones and the resulting juices done that way.

Rating: 4
Delicious. The proportions of the spices were spot-on. I added a teaspoon of olive oil in the spice mixture and mashed it to break up the rosemary. The pork tasted great and wasn't overpowered. I'll make this for company and for family time and again.

I made this last night and I thought it was very good. I also think I will brown the meat a little for some color...wasn't very pretty when done. I just salted and peppered the meat after I put the garlic,rosemary and olive oil over top. Was very tender and the juice that was in the pan was delicious..I just poured that over the top of the roast before serving. I will make this again.

Tasty,simple preparation really features great basic taste of the pork. I spread the paste of rosemary and garlic on loin, sprayed it down using an olive oil atomizer then finished coating with kosher salt and fresh ground pepper. Cooked pork to just under 155 degrees--so moist and tender we cut it with our forks and we did not marinade it at all.

Had this last evening, and my husband said it was the best pork loin roast he's ever had! (and we're seniors! LOL) I roasted my pork with little potatoes and quartered onions, then half way through, I added a bad of small organic carrots. I served it with a dollop of sour cream on the side. Yum!

Frankly, I was very disappointed with this recipe. I think that, considering all the wonderful reviews it has gotten, that something must have gone wrong on my end. I found that it wasn't very flavorful, and even though it never reached 155 degrees, it seemed fairly dry by the time we ate it. I'm sure that I must have done something wrong, but I still don't think I'll be trying it again, despite how easy and quick it was.

Now... to go on a search for my coarse salt which I KNOW I HAD....

I loved this recipe. Made a few changes. Went heavy on the garlic, used olive oil in the rub. Also added some chicken stock, tbsp apple cider vinegar, and 1/2 cup of apple juice to roast pan after flip. I drained the juice after about 20 min put it in a pan and reduced. I put the roast back in the oven to finish cooking. I added any other juices from the pan to the sauce when roast was done. I loved the way it turned out.

Flavor was good, but this wasn't my favorite. The sauce needed something, and since the drippings burnt in the oven, it had a burnt taste for me unfortunately. I tried to save it with some white wine, stock and bit of butter. Maybe I just don't like pork that much any more. It has been impossible for me to find a pork recipe that I truly love.

Simple but delicious! This was easy to prepare. Like other reviewers, I added olive oil (and extra garlic) to the rub to moisturize the roast a bit more and marinated in the fridge for a couple of hours. With the addition of the olive oil, however, the 400 degree cook temp was a bit too high (oil became a bit smoky in the oven), so I lowered to 375 and it was fine.

Made this last night and it turned out just as fantastic as the reviews claimed. I did the extra garlic, some great pepper from penzeys and the olive oil on the rub. Also did the chicken stock basting twice while cooking. My wife (the better gourmet chef) thought it was perfect!

Super good. I brined a 2.5 lb. pork loin in a mixture of 3 cups water, 1 c apple cider vinegar, ~1.5 T lemon juice, and 1.5 T kosher salt for 4 hours. I coated the pork with the paste suggested by others (i.e., add olive oil) and marinated overnight. Then followed the cooking directions. I also quartered 2 Granny Smith apples and placed them around the roast for some essence. Turned out beautifully. Had roasted root veggies on the side. Very simple and elegant dish.

This recipe was terrific. I brined it for about 4 hours. Made a paste doubling the garlic and using the olive oil as suggested. Put a bit of mustard in with it too. Just a bit.

WOW!! Fantastic results! I prepared the paste using a little evoo, and marinated the pork for only a few hours. There were some drippings, which I combined with some barbecue sauce. Before doing that, I basted the pork with some sauce during the last 20min of cooking time. Served a pinot noir, and it was a great combination. Mashed sweet potatoes made a wonderful accompaniment. The foil bottomed pan is an excellent idea, made it v. easy to pour off the drippings, and clean up was easy.

I used fresh (frozen) rosemary from my garden and doubled the amount. Used 6 cloves of garlic.

I followed the advise of the previous reviewer and brined the pork. I had a 4 lb. loin and I decided brine it in homemade applejuice, coriander, fennel seeds and bay leaf, salt and sugar. I did this for one day and then washed the pork and left it on water for a few hours. I made the paste added olive oil to it and much more garlic than suggested, also added some fennel seeds to the paste... The pork was absolutely delicious. I thought I would have some leftover pork to have some sandwiches this week. WRONG!!! The whole 4 lb piece of pork was eaten by 4 people!!!! Everyone kept picking at it even after the dinner was over and saying how full they were but it was soooo good. Thanks for the inspiration for this recipe, couldn't have done it without epicurious!

This is a great, simple dish. I also tried it in the slow cooker and put it on top of potatoes and carrots.

This dish was tasty, tender and easy-to-make! I took others' suggestion to add ~1 Tbsp of oil to the garlic rub, and it mostly stuck to the meat. I also only used a 1 lb roast, and cooked it for 15-20 minutes/side. I used the full recipe's worth of garlic rub, thought that it was a good amount. As some of the other reviewers noted, the spice flavors don't really penetrate the meat, but 1 lb is small enough that I got some of the rub with every bite, which was great!

I also took the suggestion to use the oil in order for the seasoning to stick. I only had a 1 lb. pork loin (there are only two of us). I just cut back the time considerably (by about half) and tested the temperature a couple of time to make sure I got it right. Great for a quick meal! I also cut back too much of the salt, but otherwise it was delicious. I served it with mashed potatoes and veggies. I actually did get pan juices, and I poured some of it onto the potatoes and the pork.

This has become my standard pork loin recipe - it is easy, quick, moist, and lovely. I cook it a bit less than the time given, as I like my pork tender. I have had far too many dry pork poins in my life; this is how they ought to be.

Delicious. I had just received a Rosemary plant and wanted to use some in a dish. This was so easy and everyone loved it. I did not use any salt to bake, just some at the table. I wrapped the roast in tin foil while baking, and for the last few minutes put it under the broiler to crisp it up a bit. Very tender juicy and tasty.

I made this last night- it was super easy and came out really well- especially for someone who has never made a roast pork before. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added olive oil to the rosemary-garlic mixture to help coat the roast, and then deglazed the pan with some chicken stock and white wine. I finished the sauce with a little butter and it was delicious. Some quartered potatoes and onions right in the pan with the pork came out perfectly also. All in all, a success- easy and lots of leftovers for sandwiches. My husband was mad b/c he ate so much he had no room for dessert.......

I would only cook the roast to 130F next time as 145F and then a 20 minute rest resulted in a dry roast. I can only imagine what it would have been like if I had followed my temperature guages recommendation to 170F!

Though this is very good and will be a staple recipe in our house, I want to be judicious with the four forks ratings. This is definitely worth a try, great for family or company, but, in my opinion, is not "beyond compare." It is a very solid recipe. Based on previous reviewers' comments, I made the following modifications: added garlic (total of 1 Tbsp, or about 6 cloves); added sage (1 Tbsp); added 1 tsp thyme; added 3 Tbsp olive oil; removed from oven at 150 degrees (took just over 30 minutes), tented with foil until temp rose to 160 degrees. Next time, I think I'll brown the roast a little in a saute pan before putting in the oven, just to get a little "crust" going. Quick prep time -- great if you don't have time to marinate. Very moist. We served with salad and risotto.

Made this with a 2lb pork loin and followed suggestions - used olive oil in paste, made a bed of fresh rosemary stems, cooked at 425 to start, quartered potatoes tossed in herb mix. Didn't turn roast half way because the stem bed stuck to the fatty side and besides, the roast looked great the way it was. It was delicious! And the potatoes were great too. Will definitely make this again.

Delicious! I did take the advice of one of the other reviewers who said to add a little olive oil to the spices and salt and wrap in plastic wrap and marinate over night and another reviewer who suggested adding the chicken broth, wine, mustard and lemon juice to the pan juices to make the au jus; it just gave it a little extra boost - real nice! Will definitely make again!

Great recipe - Simple, delicious and extremely moist. For those of you who want a nice little jus try this: Combine 1/2 cup white wine and 1/2 cup low salt chicken broth in a non-reactive pan. Boil until reduced somewhat - about 6-8 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in 1 tablespoon dijon mustard and the juice of one lemon. Season with freshly ground pepper. Reserve. After removing pork from pan, deglaze pan with the reserved lemon/wine/mustard mixture. After pork has rested, pour any accumulated juices into lemon/wine/mustard mixture and simmer for a few minutes. Taste for seasonings. Note: be careful about seasoning with additional salt - Pork is already seasoned with salt. Enjoy!

I did not rate this recipe as I did not make it. I wanted to comment on the cook who mentioned this was salty. As many other people on this site point out, there is a 2:1 ration of coarse salt to table salt, which may have been a problem. Also, you may find that your pork may be brined in a sodium solution and you may not know. Where I am from, Hatfield brand pork is widely sold. I personally don't buy it, but it seems that it could be up to 9% solution for tenderizing.

Easy no fuss dinner. It was tasty. I had no juices left in the reasting pan to make sauce. Smelled great while cooking.

I was disappointed in this recipe. It has far too much salt (I did use Kosher salt as suggested) and garlic for my taste. The roast was very moist but required more time than indicated. I probably will not make this again as I have other pork recipes that I feel are tastier and less time consuming.

Rating: 4
I've made this twice and IT IS GREAT. Here is my take on how to make it even better 1) definitely marinate (the first time i marinated overnight but the next time I only marinated for 4 hours--just as good) 2) for the paste--blend in olive oil to make it moister and help it to cling to the pork. 2) double the garlic and rosemary--and use fresh rosemary!! 3)At two points during the cooking, pour some chicken broth and a dash of white wine on top of the lion--REALLY makes it much more moist and flavorful. 4) watch the cooking times! Both times I made this I found it needed about 1/3 less time in the oven to be perfectly cooked (both according to the thermometer reading and the way it looked when I cut into the middle to check)

I've made this several times and love it, but the last time I made it I used a clay baker and it was without exception the best pork I have ever made.

This couldn't have been easier and the results were really impressive. I used pre-chopped garlic in a jar (yes, the easy way out!) and mashed it with dried rosemary, salt & pepper.

I served the pork with homemade applesauce, wilted spinach and seven-grain bulgar pilaf and it was a beautiful, healthful and simple meal.

I marinated this overnight and did use the olive oil for the rub. I cooked my roast to 140* and it was excellent. This recipe like others want you to overcook pork.

Based on some of the earlier comments I played with the recipe a bit. I included more garlic, added some olive oil to the garlic/rosemary mixture and applied the mixture to the roast an hour before I put it in the oven. I don't usually use much salt but this recipe benefits from a generous amount. Following an earlier suggestion, once I stripped the rosemary leaves off the stem, I use the stems to create a "bed" for the roast in the pan. Finally, I cut a couple of baking potatos into quarters (lengthwise), then cut those in half again, tossed them in some of the remaining garlic/rosemay mixture and roasted them with the pork. I agree... this recipe is better than it looks on paper.

Delicious and easy. Seared it first in my Le Creuset, then roasted with sprigs of rosemary underneath to hold it off the bottom a bit. Cooked it till JUST not pink, then rested 15 min. Juicy and tender. I don't like using the pork that has brine, etc. injected into it, but it's usually all I can find. I think it has an "off" flavor and mushy texture many times. Longing for the good old days of meat with some flavor and fat.

WOW. If I could give this 5 forks, I would. I made it last night for my sister's birthday dinner and it was the best pork roast I've ever made. Almost all of my other pork roasts turn out dry, but this one was tender and moist. Because my father has a heart condition and must watch his fat and salt intake, I used salt substitute and skipped the last step of making the sauce, and it was still spectacular -- next time I will follow the recipe exactly and I expect the results will be even better. It's really exciting to find exceptional recipes for someone with salt-and-fat dietary restrictions. Combined with the fact that it's embarrassingly easy to make, it just becomes one of the best entertaining recipes around.

This makes a wonderful, juicy roast. I used coarse sea salt seasoned with herbs de provence and pepper and a bit of olive oil to bind, as others had suggested. I also roasted it in a cast iron skillet tossing in some small new potatoes, baby carrots and small, halved onions drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with more of the salt. It made a wonderful, and easy, fall meal!

This recipe resulted in the most flavorful, moist pork loin I've ever tasted, and it will now become a staple in our household.

I enjoyed this recipe with the following modifications: halfed the amount of garlic, and made a paste for the garlic and rosemary using olive oil and rubbed the paste on both sides of the pork loin.

This is a great recipe! I used a boneless pork roast. I also used olive oil to enable the spices to rub on easier and then put the pork in a plastic bag and marinated it overnight. Instead of roasting the pork in a foil-lined roaster pan, I used my grill pan (be sure yours can go into the oven) and then when the roast was done I let it rest on the carving platter and deglazed the pan on the stove with wine. Really easy and delicious!

Some Pig! This was amazingly easy and tasted great. I learned not to line the pan with foil, as doing so made it hard to turn the roast and to scrape up the drippings. Deglazing with chicken broth did keep the drippings from being too salty. I used white wine for deglazing the second time and it was even better.

This was fairly tasty, but not a "wow" dish. Half the garlic would have been just right--especially if you make the paste, as others have noted, and marinate for several hours. Something was missing for me in this recipe--it needs a contrasting sweetness. The color of the roast was not appealing--a higher heat at first might produce a nicer brown appearance, or searing it first in a skillet. I agree with adding 1/2 to 1 cup chicken broth to the roasting dish--makes a nice 'a jus'.

As the reviews promised, this was very easy and tasty (I would have given it 3 1/2 forks if possible). I made the mistake of serving it with sweet potatoes (too sweet), regular mashed potatoes would have suited the roast much better. I used a little olive oil to make a paste so the rub was a little easier to apply, and I also added fresh sage because I had some on hand, but I don't think either would make or break the recipe.

Just as the other cooks said, this one is a keeper. Easy and delicious. I made a paste of the garlic and dried rosemary (I didn't have fresh), rubbed it on the meat, let it sit about an hour and then roasted it about 1 1/2 hr. with a lid because it weighed 5.5# - it made a good bit of juice. Took the lid off and allowed it to brown - another 1/2 hr. or so. I hadn't planned to cook the entire roast but I'm glad I did because my guests ate almost the whole thing! Will definitely make this again!

I made this for Christmas dinner, and my entire family loved it, even the children. I put the garlic, rosemary, salt, and pepper in the food processor and added just enough oil to make a paste. I then put it on the pork and let it marinate about 3 hours. The pork was tender and very flavorful. I made a gravy by adding some wine, a little chicken broth, and corn starch. Try this for Christmas, as it is very easy to make, letting the cook concentrate on the more complicated desserts and side dishes. And it is elegant. Usually for large groups I use pork loin (which is very tender), but it was scarce this year, so my guest lucked out with tenderloin. I made New England stuffing, which has rosemary. It went beautifully with the pork.

This was so tender and flavorful. This is very similar to a recipe in another cookbook I have but they made a paste out of 1/4 c. butter, rosemary, garlic and 3 oz. of chopped prosciutto, slathered the pork with it and then poured 1 cup of Marsala in the pan. That recipe was very good, too. The prosciutto adds a lot of depth.

Excellent. The garlic/rosemary/olive oil paste easily made in blender. Overnight basking in herbs let them totally seep into meat. Remember, the leaner the meat, the few the pan juices. --So wine or stock is recommended if you care for a gravy later on. When well rested, slices nicely very thin (recommended). --Served with mushroom noodles a la stroganoff, baby carrots (with a sprinkle of parsley/garlic salt), sauteed apples, and side salad.

Cook from Toronto, As per the other readers this pork was simply delicious and very tender. Used a pork loin roast and marinaded overnight in a little oil,garlic,pinch of lemon pepper and some montreal steak spice. Then rubbed it into the pork.As per another cook added the chicken stock while cooking the pork. Halfway through added a package of sliced white mushrooms. Was unable to get rosemary. Made pork roast sandwiches with the leftovers,amazing. next time I will hollow out the middle and stuff it .

Great recipe! Like others, I doubled the amount of rosemary + added olive oil to make a paste. Put roast with paste in plastic bag overnight. Prepared next afternoon. One person commented that cooking time was right on - mine took about 10 additional minutes to reach temperature. Served with asparagus, wild rice, and homemade applesauce. Great lunch the next day. I'm serving leftovers this evening with couscous, broccoli, and more applesauce (modified with addition of dried cranberries and cherries). Great way to get a number of meals!

Not only is this the best pork roast I've ever made, I think it's the best pork roast I've ever tasted. I added olive oil to the garlic mixture to make a paste, as suggested by another person. I wrapped it in saran wrap and let it sit in the fridge overnight. Otherwise, I made the recipe as directed. Others had complained of not having juices after it was cooked but I had about 4 tablespoons, which was plenty. I'm definitely making this again. Very very juicy.

This roast is de-lish and so easy to make. At the suggestion of some, I marinated a couple of hours and seared before roasting. I found the sauce salty (used kosher salt) and diluted it with a little water and it was perfect. My husband and mother-in-law loved the flavours. Will definitely make it again.

Alright...this was an absolute hit. I had 15 people for Easter dinner and bought an 8.08 lb. roast. I put it in at 11:50am and it was done by 2:15. Succulent, moist, this is going to be permanently in my recipe box. So impressive. I rubbed the meat the night before and wrapped it in seran wrap - so it was simple to prepare and cook.

Rating: 4
First off I used an almost 4 lb. roast and used 5 cloves of garlic, but about the same amount of fresh rosemary because that was all I had, and the same amount of salt and pepper. My husband raved and my two teenage daughters, who are not big meateaters, gave me compliments. We love garlic and it was plenty garlicky, but for those that just like garlic, I am sure it would have been overwhelming. An extremely easy meal dish that did not require alot of preparation or marinating time.

Loved it! Made it with a tenderloin. Great sauce. Added more garlic and rosemary as suggested by others, as well as less salt.

I made this for Easter dinner. Even my kids flipped for it, and they don't like anything! My husband said it should go in my "Top 10" file. I added tiny onions (halved) and skinny little carrots. Also, I made a pan gravy out of the drippings (although there were hardly any). Served with garlic mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus. Wonderful dinner, and a definite repeater!

It was an easy, no hassle way to prepare a pork roast. I used a roast that was just under 2 lbs and it fed 6 (with 3 side dishes). I created a paste with the garlic and rosemary using olive oil. Also heeded the warnings of previous reviewers and used less than a teaspoon of salt, which was perfect.

I made this recipe last night using James' from California's suggestions regarding the wine and chicken stock and it was DE-lish! I could have eaten the leftover sauce with a spoon (did, actually). I might watch the salt a bit next time as it was on the verge of being too salty.

The recipe called for 1 1/2 tsp of salt. I had a 2 lb roast and used 1 tsp of salt and it was very salty! The drippings were very flavorful but I had to boil a potato in them to decrease the salt. I would make this again but use less salt. The garlic and rosemary proportions seemed good, more garlic would work for me too.

This is very good. I used 8 or ten cloves of garlic instead of 4 (you can't have too much garlic) and fresh rosemary, about 2 tsp. I also added about 1/2 cup chicken stock to the roasting pan at the turn. I stopped the cooking at 145 F. Then I added more stock, 1/2 cup and 1/4 cup of white wine to the juices. Cooked that down to a third with some butter and strained it. Yum.

Rating: 4
Terrific aroma and flavor...although the garlic was too strong (would use less next time). I also had to cook appx. 20 min. longer as noted by other reviewers. Effortless and excellent for leftovers - I added to a simple veg. noodle soup with a dash of soy sauce for a flavorful "chinese" meal.

This roast was good, but the sauce is what really makes the dish. I found that it took longer than the time called for even though my roast was a little smaller. I'll make this one again.

SOOOOOOO SALTY. I decreased to one teaspoon and even my salt loving children thought it was overwhelming. That aside, it is a decent recipe, I added some sage and made a paste with olive oil per other reviewers, a good idea...also used soft roasted garlic cloves instead of raw (which was great). I will make it again but with no more than 1/2 tsp salt(and I use good grey salt).

Wow-what a great dish with the cooler weather. We followed advice of others, and doubled the garlic and spices. Our roast was a little smaller, and we overcooked it slightly, but still very, very good. Served with mashed potatoes with carmelized onions mixed in....Yum! Will make again.

Wonderful recipe that adapted well to a favorite method of ours---smoking. Prepared the rub as directed, but took other reviewers' ideas of adding chopped fresh sage and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, and rubbed roast with a little olive oil first. Smoked over hot coals for 1 hr, 15 minutes---delcious and moist!!

I doubled the garlic and rosemary, because we like lots of flavor, and not too much salt. My husband raved!

This recipe was outrageously delicious. To the garlic and rosemary paste I added a tablespoon or so of olive oil and a tablespoon of minced fresh sage. The result was a house that smelled terrific while it cooked and an extremely moist roast with concentrated flavor and lots of pan juices. This is a simple way to cook pork that will delight everyone who enjoys full-flavored food.

When I removed the pork loin from the packaging, it was cut through as if it was originally going to be cut for butterfly chops. I decided to also chop some extra garlic and rosemary and rub the inside of the roast. Then I tied the two pieces up with linen cord. I decided to sear the roast in olive oil prior to roasting but followed the rest of the recipe. This roast was sooooooooo moist. The meat was as tender as butter. WONDERFUL!!! Even my finicky children enjoyed the taste of this roast.

This roast was really tasty. I used olive oil as well and let it sit overnight. It wasn't dry at all, and I will definately make it again. It couldn't be easier.

This was delicious and so easy! I ran the fresh rosemary and garlic through my food processor, and drizzled in a little olive oil--just enough to start to emulsify--and a few drops of lemon juice. Coated the roast with the marinade and let it sit for a couple of hours before roasting it in the oven. It was raining, but I can't wait to try this recipe on the grill! It was nice and moist--pork dries out so easily usually.

Rating: 4
Like Kimberly, I rubbed olive oil, along with the garlic, rosemary, kosher salt and pepper into the roast a few hours ahead , then grilled it for about one hour on my barbecue. It was exceptional. The key to cooking pork these days is not to overcook it so that it remains juicy. Be sure to try this recipe.

mmm mmm..i also used the pan drippings with white wine and glace de poulet chicken stock and a bit of cornstarch. with that, it deserves four forks. i also brushed with olive oil and seared to get a nice crust before putting it in the oven...i used a 2 lb. pork tenderloin (is this different?) and cooked at 325 instead for about 50 minutes. very moist...

So simple, so-o-o good! I agree with the previous reviewer who suggested white wine for a pan gravy. I added water instead of chicken stock because the drippings were very salty. The pan gravy was delicious. The garlic, salt and rosemary formed a very thin crust that was a bit salty but not overly so when you take a bite. This is a definite keeper! My guests loved it and asked for the recipe.

Succulent pork roast. Herbs and garlic made into a paste works much better. Also, I slathered paste over roast and marinated in fridge for several hours. Wow! And I did not trim fat off...if you increase heat for 1st 35 minutes to 425 your roast will be cooked perfectly and the fat devine. Do add white wine and chicken broth to make a pan gravy! This is fabulous!

Great change from boring roasted chicken or beef roast. A meat thermometer is necessary so over or under-cooking doesn't take place. Made pan gravy from the juices. Next day diced leftover roast; added sauted onions, carrots, potatoes, and green peas to gravy and meat. Topped with pie crust and baked. My family enjoyed both meals tremendously.

I prepared this receipe using fresh rosemary. I minced the garlic cloves and combined them with the salt and pepper to make a kind of a dried paste to rub on the roast.

I'm not a big fan of rosemary, so I substituted thyme; and instead of rubbing garlic over roast, I cut a couple of cloves into slivers, salted them, made deep gashes in the roast and inserted the garlic. Then I went further and made sauercraut and Polish kielbasa to accompany it Goodbye boring chicken, welcome Pork!
