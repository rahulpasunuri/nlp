If I'm well enough to make it, or rich enough to hire a cook, this is what I'll have for my last meal on earth. Beyond fabulous. I made it for Easter; used juniper berries from my neighbor's front yard and kumquat skins instead of orange rind. Added some kumquat slices (for serving) because they are pretty. It's the best. Served it with Russian fingerling potatoes roasted (at the same 425 as the legs) in a little duck fat with salt and parsley added at serving.

I made this recipe for our extended family last year over the Christmas break. It is by far the best duck I have ever had and I have eaten at some of the best restaurants in the US. I stuck to the recipe and made stock as well, which I think was key. Strongly recommend trying it but expect to spend a good part of the day in the kitchen.

I made this for christmas dinner. I used 3 ducks and followed the recipe at 1 1/2 times the amounts. I did not bone the breasts, instead splitting the ducks in half, cutting out the back bones and made stock with the necks, back bones, wing tips, hearts and gizzards (I reserved the duck livers to make pate). Instead of cooking the breast and leg separately, I just heavily scored the skin and roasted the duck in halves on a sheet pan. Other than the cooking methods, I did follow the recipe and the result was fantastic. This was the highlight of our dinner. I highly recommend this and I will make it again in the future!

I made this last night for Christmas Eve dinner. Having never butchered a duck, I was a tad intimidated by the start, but it was surprisingly easy and worth every minute of the work considering the outcome of the stock/cherry sauce was pure delicious! This recipe is worth the effort for a celebratory dinner. Also, we had plenty of leftovers. If you are serving sides and a starter, this dish can easily serve 10 people (if not more).

Made this several years ago and lost the recipe; I'm so glad I've refound it. Used dried cherries from Traverse City, the Cherry Capital, and I'll be doing it again soon. I think it'll work with wild fowl too.

I've always thought that cooking duck would be intimidating. The only thing difficult for me with this recipe was cutting the duck up into legs/thighs and breasts. If your butcher would do it for you, you'll save lots of time. another time saver is to make the duck broth a day or two before. I thought that the sauce was marvelous. I easily found dried tart cherries in the dried fruit section of my Safeway, along with raisins, apricots, etc. If I had time (and could easily find duck) I would make this at least once a month, maybe more. Lastly, what attracted me to this recipe is that it wasn't just about the duck breasts, but about the leg too (my favorite part!)

Used this recipe for my first time making duck. I feel the cooking method is the real star of this recipe. Both breast and legs came out perfect! The sauce did not thicken for me, even after 2 hours! of trying to reduce it. Perhaps one shouldn't use ALL the stock to make it. I will try a different sauce recipe next time.

Reading this recipe through the first time, it seemed very intimidating. Later I realized the amount of detail made it easier to follow and more accessible to the home cook. Read it over and over, and closely follow the directions, and your pay off is a beautiful and and full-flavored duck. The fresh herbs really make a difference. However, I admit that the first time I made it, the person who had picked up the ducks for me had them butchered-but Chinese style! This didn't make for as pretty a presentation, but the flavors were still there and everyone at dinner thought it was delicious and they asked me to make it again for the next holiday.

I made this as a turkey alternative for an early Thanksgiving, and it was great! I marinated overnight, skipping the juniper berries, nad let the stock simmer just as long - very tasty! The sauce was a little sour, but that may have been because I subbed cranberries for cherries. Still lovely.

I have made this twice now using Muscovy ducks the last time - locally raised. We had a dinner party for 8 so I used 3 ducks. Rather than cooking the duck inside, we cooked the cut up duck on the bbq - on indirect heat. It was terrific. Do watch the leg quarters as they can dry out very quickly this way- just ask my husband who neglected to do so! This is a very very good recipe. Next time I will roast the entire duck in the oven. I also agree with those who skip making the duck stock. It's a lot of trouble for probably not much gain. I think veal stock would be perfect - better than chicken.

Every year I make a special romantic Christmas Eve dinner for my husband. This year I decided to make this dish. It was absolutely wonder. I paired it with sauteed spinach and spiced whipped sweet potatoes with brown sugar. I decided to do something a little different with the sauce. Using my cuisinart smart stick, pureed it to a smooth consistency. The meal was a hit with my husband. I will definitely make this dish again.

Marvelous! Kitchen smelled wonderful while the stock was cooking. Hard to go wrong with a D'Artagnon duck. Served with sauteed corn cakes - this is a keeper.

To the cook from Oakland, this is great served with long grain and wild rice, steamed haricots verts, sautéed baby spinach and/or turnip mash. As another reviewer said, you don't need to fuss much about the side dish, these I've used combined (rice with haricots, mash with spinach in very small amounts) and they were very good and a success. Only marinated the duck overnight and was v.good, but didn't add juniper, don't have a taste for it at home.

I have made this duck twice and loved it both times. But this time I didn't like the sauce much and will probably not make it next time. Also, I made twice as much herb rub as the recipe called for. I served the duck with a cold sweet-potato salad and peas and baby onions. Everybody loved the sweet-potato salad, but the truth is that the duck is the star of this meal, so don't waste too much time on side dishes.

I am curious -- what did people serve this with? It sounds delicious, but I'm having trouble building a menu around it.

At first glance, I thought, "Whoa, this is way too much work!" But then I followed the suggestions of previous reviewers with GREAT results (and lots of raves). I brined the whole duck the day before in ice water and salt (don't know if it did anything, but I swear it works for turkey and I couldn't break my habit). Then I used the recipe for the rub and also stuck some thyme stems just underneath the skin, and stuck a piece of celery, apple and orange in the cavity before letting it marinate. Then I threw the whole thing in the oven, basting with boiling water to render the fat more quickly. I thought it was much easier, the duck came out super tender and the carcass makes really good "jook" (Chinese porridge). I did make the sauce, but made the mistake of also having Williams-Sonoma cranberry orange apple relish available as well, so nobody really touched the sauce and everyone ate the relish instead, so I can't really tell you much about how the sauce went over.

I made this for Christmas dinner using a fresh domestic pheasant instead of duck and it was excellent! The herb rub is amazing with the subtle gaminess of the bird. The cooking time is also a bit faster since pheasant is so lean that fat rendering and skimming was unnecessary.

Absolutley wonderful! Some of the best duck I've ever eaten and got raves from even friends who aren't so keen on duck. I substituted dried cranberries for the tart cherries and the sauce was still rich and great with the stock base. There are a lot of steps but it turned out perfect and it was worth every bite.

I made this cherry sauce over the weekend, to go with a duck very simply roasted. It was delicious. We intend to do the entire recipe soon, and will not change a thing. I am sure the many steps will be well worth it.

Here's my EAST GOURMET version: buy just duck breasts. Use dried herbs. Forget the stock and sauce. Instead, use Trader Joe's tart cherries in juice (in jar, not frozen)and add balsamic vinegar to taste. Reduce that sauce somewhat. Saute breasts according to the recipe. Place on a pool of the sauce on the plate. Delicious. Simple.

made this for Thanksgiving. Even my sister-in-law, who dislikes duck, liked it! I made it with 3 ducks instead of 2, because of the number of guests, so it made a lot of stock and I think that threw off the proportions a bit for the sauce--it refused to thicken! I ended up using a little cornstarch and water to make it more of a "glaze" consistency, but the flavor was awesome. All that frying was a little rattling, but the recipe was easy overall. This is a definite favorite and will go into my repertoire of holiday meals! I bow to Chef Traunfeld!

This was a great way of making duck. The pan-searing and roasting really takes out the fat and crisps the skin. Cutting up the bird and removing the back/wings (which I had my butcher do to save time - making 3 ducks) really make serving easier. Of course I made a few personal changes -- like using tangerine zest and adding some tangerine juice to the paste (excellent addition) and using tarragon instead of bay leaves -- but the recipe is excellent on its own. Also, once you flip the legs, you could roast them for about 15, rather than 20 minuites as called for in the recipe. This is definitely a keeper.

Thought that this was an excellent recipe. I did roast a whole duck, but used the herb rub and sauce. Both the rub and sauce were very good, but I thought that the sauce could have been thicker. I tried pureeing it, but the texture didn't come out right. Next time I might add a roux.

The best duck my husband and I have ever eaten! I made it for his birthday and he raved about the flavors. The recipe is extremely clear and easy to follow. Nothing needs to be changed. I can't wait to make it again.

I made this recently and it came out great! Despite the directions, it really is easy to do. The only tough part is making the duck stock, only because it is so time consuming. I didn't think it added a flavor much different from chicken, so next time I would use chicken or even veal stock. There's not that much gelatin in duck stock, so it doesn't really add that much body to your sauce, and after all that work, all I ended up w/ was maybe a cup of sauce (I halved the recipe). I stuck to the recipe w/ the exception of the juniper berries (couldn't find them anywhere), and it was delicious, if perhaps a bit heavy on the rosemary (I love it, but would reduce next time - it's v. strongly flavored w/ the herbs, pepper and wine sauce). You can't really go wrong w/ an herb rub and a wine/shallot/dried fruit sauce. Next time I'd add some currant jelly to the sauce for an extra bit of sweetness.

I made this dish for Christmas dinner. It was woderful and elegant, and not as complicated as it seemed it might be. I pureed the cherries with the sauce after cooking, and added a couple of tablespoons of butter to it, which made it thick and creamy. I'll definitely make this again.

I made this recipe twice, for two groups of guests, and got rave reviews from each party. The duck meat is tender and the herbed skin is complex in flavor. I plan to make it again -- all those steps aren't nearly so complicated as they seem.

I made this for Thanksgiving because I hate turkey. It was great. This was the first time that my husband had ever tried duck. He loved it and the cherry sauce. (Note: I roasted my duck whole, but followed the herb rub and sauce recipe.)
