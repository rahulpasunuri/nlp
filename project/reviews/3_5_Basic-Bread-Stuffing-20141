This dressing (I bake it outside the bird) has become a Thanksgiving staple in our home. It's very versatile and you can't beat the flavor. Guests are always pleasantly surprised by the buttery flavor.I'm the queen of stuffing in my crowd. James Beard clearly knew what he was doing in the kitchen.

Don't use too much sage because it overpowers?? I prefer the traditional stuffing which includes the wonderful taste of sage. Let it overpower!!

Great Stuffing! An old favorite with a new twist...I added turkey stock, fresh made pesto and dry white wine. My family was absolutely blown away!

Very flavorful. I'll cut the tarragon by half the next time, as it tended to overpower the stuffing. The buttery flavor was wonderful. Next time, I'll reduce the butter by half, and add some Molly McButter to retain the flavor, while reducing fat. Very nice change of pace from the usual sage stuffing!
