I am from Charleston SC. We make this receipe on New Year's Day for luck. I have only one question or comment. Yes, we only use cow peas but cow peas are not dried black eyed peas they are two different peas. Please only use cow peas. We also use bacon instead of pork. We also saute onion with the bacon.

We make this recipe in Barbados as well except that it has no special name and is just one version of the traditional peas and rice. We tend to boil(not fry) the pork ( pig tail or salted beef) in water until partially cooked before we add the peas and seasonings.
