In making this the 2nd time, I did want to mention that the liquid/rice ratio seems odd. Usually, it's about 1-3/4 liquid to 1 cup of rice. For this, I used 1 can coconut milk and the balance in water to make a total of 3 cups of liquid. I did this the first time I made it too. Still delicious.

My daughter is a PICKY eater and my husband does not care for coconut. This is the exception. They both love this rice. As per one suggestion, I add a bay leaf when cooking and when the rice is finished I stired in a dried lemongrass and fluff the rice. I'm making this again tonight and can't wait to eat it! Amazing.

My husband and I have made a pact: coconut rice only once a week. When we make it, we just eat it straight out of the pot and dinner is kaput. This rice is so delicious you can't think of anything else until it's all in your tummy, and even as you polish off the last grains (with your fingers, in the corners and crannies of your cookware) you are plotting the next batch, and whether or not it should be a double. Take it from me, folks. Make a double batch. If you can manage to save leftovers, pour a little coconut milk on them, pop them in the microwave and have a sweet treat for breakfast! PS I love this rice.

Very delicious - a little dry.

Really tasty & super easy. The second time I paired it with the Thai Shrimp and Halibut Curry also on this site. My only complaint was the leftovers disappeared too quickly.

This is called 'kiri buth' (or milk rice, literally) in Sri Lanka, but made without the sugar. Served on special occasions.

Easy, tasty. I made with the pork loin and pineapple relish recipe on here and it was a great complement.

Yum. Excellent recipe! I enjoyed the rice as much as the main part of the meal I made. It was a bit sticky, but I probably didn't rinse it enough to begin with. It was still tasty though!
