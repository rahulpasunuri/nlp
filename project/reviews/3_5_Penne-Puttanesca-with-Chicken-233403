It was good. Thank goodness I read the reviews. I used about 1/3 the anchovy, & the sauce was still a bit much for us. I thought there was too much pasta too. Already have a pasta puttanesca recipe we like, so probably won't make again.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some left over roasted chicken thighs and found this, and am glad I did. Since this was a last minute meal I didn't have the olives to put in it, and I substituted anchovy paste for the anchovies. We thoroughly enjoyed the dish. Now I can't wait to try it using all the ingredients!

Fabulous! I cooked for a large crowd and they loved it!! I did increase the red pepper flakes and added a 1/4 cup of red wine. Will make this again!!!

This is one of our favorite winter entrées; fast and flavorful. We call it "Prostitute Chicken", as that is what the name means in Italian. I add more garlic, and serve it with spaghetti rigate.

This is great puttanesca recipe. The sauce was very flavorful, just the right amount of spice from the red pepper flakes.

This is much better than the recipe my wife found online elsewhere (bbc good food website). Just a very good savoury, tomatoey sauce.

This sauce was great. I used shrimp instead of chicken which I sauteed in oil and then added back to the sauce right before serving. I also used anchovy paste.

Did not use the chicken, sauce is a keeper. I must admit I added more anchovies, love anchovies. Definitly a keeper. I did add pancetta to it (no chicken, thought it would work as substitute)

Solid mid-week dinner for 2 with plenty of leftovers. I followed the recipe exactly (a rarity for me). I didn't find the sauce too fishy at all...just a light note of anchovy. We both agreed that the chicken did little for the dish other than adding substance. It doesn't detract from the overall flavor, but it's hardly a star in the otherwise beautiful briny mix.

I make puttanesca all the time for my husband and I(our sons don't like it), so I thought I could fool them with this dish. Not only did our sons pick up on the "weirdness" of the sauce, but my husband commented that I could have left the chicken out. I dismissed his comment until I tasted it, and I, surprisingly, agreed. The chicken was not necessary and did nothing to enhance the flavor. The puttanesca sauce was very good, though, so I would definitely keep that part of the recipe.

It was quite good with the one exception of the high salt content, between the olives, capers, and achovies.

This is really delicious! Don't change a thing! The flavors all blend together beautifully; you don't even know there's anchovies in it. Yumm!

This was perfect for a weeknight meal for one - I would definitely make it again. Now I have plenty left to take for lunch, which is fine by me. The only change I made was to use chicken that had already been cooked because I had a ton of roasted chicken in my fridge. Since the chicken was already cooked I only sauted it with the anchovies for about a minute. The chicken was falling-apart tender and juicy by the time I was done cooking. So I'd say this could work equally well with already cooked chicken. Also, as with any puttanesca, good olives and tomatoes are key.

If i made it again it would need serious changes. It was too "anchovyy" i would cut back, and maybe use regular oil to fry the chicken. Also, cut back on the capers, and it needs a zing, maybe some lemon juice?

Very good. I added about 1/4 cup of vodka and about 1 tblsp lemon juice. Yummy!!

I've always wanted to try this but not terribly fond of tomato sauce however I love Kalamata Olives & Anchovies so I gave it a try. Really liked it! I used 1/3rd of a tube of anchovy paste, which was a guess and seemed to come out ok. To chop & prepare ingredients to dinner on the table was about 40 minutes. Will definitely try it with shrimp and maybe veal.

Dinner on a night I have school is usually difficult. On my way out the door tonight I whipped up this dish for the family. I love it because it's quick and easy; they love it because it's amazingly good. I chickened out on the anchovies, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.

I cook a lot of Italian sauces and this was tops. I followed it exactly, but halved it, and it was incredible. I actually used the Fire Roasted Muir Glen tomatoes and was fantastic. I recommend using fresh spagetini - incredible. Use sauce sparingly as this type of sauce is not one to douse the fresh pasta. Served with Reggiano and garlic bread. YES, serve with a robust red wine. Perfect meal for all, especially if you are in any type of athletic training. Ride on!

I cook for five finicky eaters. When I get five thumbs up it must be four forks. That is the case this time. I decided that cutting back on olives, garlic or anchovies would throw off the balance and now I'm glad I followed the recipe exactly except I had Nicoise olives on hand so I squished the pits out and used a generous half cup knowing the volume would be similar to halfs of Kalamata in a cup. My gang won't eat anchovies. Knowingly. So I chopped them fine and ditched the can. After the rave reviews I told them and they were amazed.

All those strong flavors going on - you can drink a very robust red wine with it - mmmmm good

A must for any pasta loving person! I followed the recipe as it was and all my guests loved it! Maybe will cut down on the olives, as I am not too much of an olive fan myself...

My husband LOVED this. I am not an olive fan, so next time I will mince them so I don't have to look at them. I used anchovie paste and olive oil, no actual fishies. I used cavatappi, and garnished with shaved parm. I will make it again.

Great! I used olive oil and anchovy paste instead of the canned anchovies and oil -- it gave great flavor without too much "anchovy-ness". I also used boneless skinless chicken breasts and less pasta. When it was finished, I sprinkled it with the parsley and with garlic bread crumbs (toasted some good ciabatta bread, rubbed it with a garlic clove and crushed it into crumbs). Delicious and it looked beautiful in a serving bowl.

My husband loved it. Used more chicken and next time would use a shade less red pepper but wonderfully easy supper with a cooling salad.

Made this the other night. I love puttanesca sauce and this recipe is very close to the one I make. I generally use boneless chicken breasts, a little less garlic, olive oil, but NO anchovies. I can't do anchovy anything. It ruins the flavor in my opinion. Sorry anchovy lovers!

Rating: 3
This was a terrific winter pasta dish and a great change from sauce with cream and/or cheese. I used one boneless skinless chicken breast (cut up as per the instructions); olive oil instead of the anchovy oil; and diced tomatoes instead of crushed, but otherwise followed the recipe. I served with a rough southern Italian wine and it was a great Sunday supper.

This is very close to a recipe I make, obnly I use shrimp instead of chicken and IT IS DIVINE! I use whole plum tomatoes and chop them in the pan to have a more chunky, rustic dish. The shrimp really makes it and I am planning to try it with littlenecks, too....

used chicken breast w/skin - browned in 1/2anchovy oil & 1/2 olive oil & then boned & cubed. Used 2 T tomato paste - browned in oil then proceeded w/recipe adding 1 cup water w/diced tomatoes. Simmered 45 min - topped w/freshly grated sicilian pepato, served w/green salad & hot rosemary/potato bread - yum! Anchovies good quality - jarred not tinned & definately not overwhelming. Will make again!

Chicken, huh? OK, I'll try it! I often make Alfredo Viazzi's("Trattoria Alfredo")Puttanesca with two cans of drained, imported tuna fish gently folded in and a whole lotta butter to smooth things out...oh oh, now I gotta have it!

I have been making essentially this dish for years but as a vegetarian dish with the addition of whole greenbeans boiled with the pasta for the last 4 minutes. I learned the recipe from the famed San Francisco Italian chef Michael Christianson. I always use anchovy paste.

Rating: 0
I didn't make this, but I make my own dish that is very similar. When I'm making it for my husband and me I use anchovies, but for guests I either use anchovy paste or mash up some of the capers, either of which will add salt and flavor but without the very distinctive anchovy bite. I never use the anchovy oil in any case. I also add chopped shallot with the garlic, and fresh basil with the parsley. It works very well over polenta or pasta!

We ran a Cafe/Bistro restaurant for years in the vineyards north of Sydney, Australia. The recipe, without chicken, was always a favourite (with any pasta). We had fun and loved diners reactions and questions to names like "Whore's Spaghetti" or "Courtesan Sauce"! Thanks for reminding me, now to try a Chicken Courtesan!

I made a very similar version of this by accident. Have always loved making puttanesca sauce. Had the ingredients for it and also needed to use up skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs. Needless to say, the additional fat from the chicken made this dish very, very rich. But oh-so-tasty. I would reduce the amount of anchovies so that the flavor is complex but not overly anchovy-y. For a batch of sauce, where I add one 28-oz can of whole tomatoes plus one 15-oz can of diced tomatoes, I usually use 10-12 filets. (I think that works out to 6-8 filets for this recipe.) Plus, I always increase the garlic big-time to balance the anchovy.

I was curious but IMO adding chicken to puttanesca sauce is gilding the lily...for the cook whose boyfriend doesn't like anchovies, try canned tuna next time-less pronounced fishy flavor

Rating: 3
First, I'm only an occasional cook, so always have to struggle to find a simple, but tasty meal. This was a great dish. I reduced the recipe to serve two persons, and still had left overs. After a day in the fridge, the leftovers may have been better than the original - the anchovies and garlic seem to have 'matured'. A sweet Italian sausage would be excellent with the Puttanesca sauce, too.

I made this recipe following the directions exactly. Being an anchovy lover, I enjoyed it thoroughly. However, my fiance did not--the anchovy flavor was much too pronounced for someone who is not used to eating them. I'd suggest using the anchovies, but instead of sauteeing the chicken in the reserved anchovy oil, just use regular olive oil. Otherwise, it's delicious.
