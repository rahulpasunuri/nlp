This is the best Peruvian-style ceviche I've ever made. The scallops are fantastico, super easy and fast to prepare for a nice & light, no-fishy taste. Halved the Aji Amarillo sauce because it can get a bit too spicy for me, so taste as you go.

Looking forward to trying this out but since I don't eat shellfish, I'll substitute another kind of fish. And choclo are very large kernels of corn that are popular in Peruvian food. A good Latino market should have them in the frozen section.

This sounds like a great recipe but, what are 'choclo'? I couldn't find them in the food dictionary. Does anyone know?

I used only half as much aji amarillo paste and the sauce was still plenty hot, so add sparingly if you don't want major fire. I also used the traditional ceviche technique of curing the scallops in the marinade rather than poaching. I sliced large scallops into 1/3 inch horizontal slices and marinated for 2 hours. The texture was just right. I skipped the choclo. Visually very stunning with the sweet potatoes.

Great flavor. Used tequila instead of pisco. Big hit with my guest. Will make again.
