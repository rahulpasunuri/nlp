Great authentic Mexican Christmas cookie that brought back memories of making them with mi abuela from Southern Colorado. We had a few slight modifications: 1. Use 1 T of anise liquid instead of anise seed to make the taste more uniform & subtle. 2. ALWAYS use lard as it keeps the cookie light like shortbread. We melt it in the microwave then refrigerate the dough for about 30 mins before rolling the cookies. 3. We also dust them in red or green sugar sprinkles for Xmas tree or reindeer shapes, or orange pumpkin shapes at Halloween ... just as good. 4. I use bread flour & sift it 3 times which seems to help keep them really light & airy. 5. For newbies, these cookies are supposed to be thick... don't roll the dough out too thin & cook them til they are a light golden brown on bottom. Both my Latino family & gringo friends love these cookies. I usually end up making around 10 batches at Christmas!

The prior reviewer was so positive, that I thought I'd try these for a tex-mex potluck. Made exactly as written, and I will never make them again! They are dry, and not very flavorful (the raw dough was pretty good..baking ruins it!) I wasn't expecting very sweet, as I'm familiar with Mexican pastry, but these just don't have any redeeming qualities.
