Very simple, and came out great. I had some left over green onions and I hate throwing away any food, this was a great way to use it up with something I would make anyway. Will def make it again.

This is a great side dish, especially with fish. I usually end up using more broth than the recipe calls for.

I cannot count how many times I've made this dish. It's a quick and lovely alternative to risotto, and it goes with just about any main course. Simplicity at its best!

Yummy. Quintessential comfort food. I used the ratio of 1:3 orzo/chicken broth and added lemon juice per reviewers' suggestions. I have frozen leftovers and successfully reheated later.

This was an excellent and easy dish, which I used as a main dish, paired with this websites Ever Greater Caesar Salad (the best!). Next time I will take the suggestion to toast / saute the orzo first; this would keep it from getting mushy.

Very simple, and very good. I sauteed the onions, took them out of the pan, then added them back with the cheese. I also browned the orzo for a couple of minutes in a little butter, and added some chopped parsley at the end.

Wow, this is easy and so good. Took the suggestions of browning the orzo and adding lemon. Like many others I had to add a lot more broth. So good. Definately a keeper.

SUPER! Used lots of parmesan and needed mor broth and added capers. SUPER! But it made ALOT... I'd say would feel 8 easily for a side dish. Better than rice, any day!

Discovered orzo 2 yrs. ago & have, since then, browned 1/3 of it in butter with garlic & scallions. Would never have thought of adding lemon juice to it but, now, plan to. As always, important to use a good Parm-Regg. The ratio I use is 1 c. orzo to 3 c. broth or stock plus more if left to sit a while. Simple & delicious!

Great and tasty. I tweaked the dish...I only had 3 oninons not 5 and I chopped and sauted the onions before adding it to the orzo w/ the parm cheese. When I make this again, based on other reviewer suggestions, I will brown the orzo and add some lemon juice.

Great and tasty. I tweaked the recipe in that I didn't have 5 onions and used 3. I chopped the onions and sauted them first, then added to the Orzo w/ the parm cheese. I thought 5 onions raw would be rather strong. I will definitely make this again and brown the Orzo first and add some lemon juice as some of the other reviewers suggested.

I loved this dish. I also browned the orzo first, and added extra chicken broth and stirring slowly to make it a risotto like texture. Delicious!!!!

This is a great subtle side dish when you have a strong main course...easy and yummy!

Excellent flavor, easy to make and company quality. The only change I made was to saute the orzo in butter before simmering in the broth.

I made the recipe as follows and on first taste, it reminded me of a fancy mac n' cheese. I added mushrooms that had been sauteed in garlic butter, chopped parsley, and chopped red pepper which made it more interesting. However, what really made a difference was following the advice of a previous cook and adding the juice of half a lemon. That made it tast like a nice side at a restaurant. Just the kick it needed. I just finished it and I hope my guests for mother's day like it.

Very simple dish. Tastes similar to risotto without the hassle. I wouldn't change ingredients too much, very good as is. I added a bit more stock (probably 1/2 C).

Simple and flavorful. Following other suggestions, I also roasted the orzo before cooking. This recipe is a keeper. A great side dish that takes no effort to prepare.

Yummy & creamy--I too, toasted the orzo in a little butter before adding the stock. Delicious & simple side dish.

This dish was simple and delicious. I made it exactly like recipe called for, although I did have to add quite a bit extra stock. This will definitely become a staple in my house. It's quick, hearty comfort food, and I personally wouldn't add too many extra ingredients to unnecessarily complicate a wonderful dish.

YUM! I toasted the orzo in a little butter before adding stock, and then stirred almost constantly, making almost a risotto. The family fought over the leftovers. So quick and easy, will become a side staple for us. Oh yeah, used a tri-color orzo.

Believe it or not, this recipe does have potential. First of all, the broth must be increased to at least 5 cups. Then, I added 2 tablespoons each of fresh chopped Italian parsley & chives. Also, it definitely needs seasoning of kosher salt & cracked black pepper to taste. Now we're talking good orzo! It beautifully complimented the seared halibut w/scallions & white wine sauce & blanched, then sauteed tender young green beans (haricots verts). Voila! It is now tableworthy!

Easy dish to prepare, esp. for company! Some modifications that I made are as follows: Toast the orzo in your skillet with a 1/2 stick of butter; add chicken broth and simmer- season to taste, I like to use a lemon/pepper blend; add as much cheese[good quality] as you want!; don't forget to sprinkle the top with thin slices of your scallions and toasted pine-nuts just before serving. Well, my family loved it this way, hope you do too!!

I thought it was just mediocre. Granted, I was probably wasn't supposed to eat it alone, but I thought it was too rich and heavy.

Wonderful and easy to make. Keep extra chicken stock on hand especially if you think the dish will have to sit for a while before beign served. It dried up a couple of times but was revived with the extra stock.

This is a great recipe. It's a perfect substitute for the same old potatoes. I served it to guests and it was a hit! Plan to use more broth than it calls for. I will definitely make this again!

This was good . . . subbed vegetable broth for chicken as my sister is a vegetarian, and I hate the taste of canned vegetable broth. So this did not have the best flavor as far as I am concerned, but I'm sure a homemade stock or a different broth would have improved it. It is a good recipe for orzo. I also had to use more broth than the recipe called for.

I gave this recipe four forks because a side dish is suppose to enhance the main dish without "stealing the show". I thought this orzo dish did just that. It's very versatile, nice in appearance, and easy to make. It went quite well with fresh salmon just pulled out of the river yesterday!

Very tasty and easy. Added some sliced mushrooms which were nice.

Excellent! What an easy and tasty side dish. I made this with the cornmeal crusted chicken breasts and steamed green beans. A hit with family and friends! I'll be making this again, and again and again. (You will need more broth than the recipe calls for.)

This was my first time making orzo and this is a keeper recipe. There is so much you can do to this recipe to jazz it up! I made 2 changes. I added 1 full cup of parmesan cheese and 1 tsp lemon juice and garlic salt. Wonderful!!

How can something so simple be so flavorful? This recipe is the easiest thing ever -- and it's really great. Thanks to the cooks who suggested using extra broth.

I agree.....you need more chicken stock than called for. I don't think I used enough onion but it was excellent anyway. Served it with Pecan crusted dijon chicken breast and asparagus. The entire meal was a hit with the family and guests.

This is an excellent, easy side dish. I served it with chicken marsala and it worked really well.

I have made this twice. It is a very good recipe but you definetly need more chicken stock. Mine tends to get a little sticky though.

I have made this multiple times and it is far to good for something this easy. I now make sure to take off the stove when the orzo still looks wet, as it does dry out quickly.Enjoy!

This is a brilliant recipe-it's like instant risotto! Made it the first time a week ago, and it was so good I repeated it four days later. Definitely need more broth than the recipe calls for. Also use about 25% more cheese than called for and mix equal amounts parmesan and romano for more flavour. Great with osso buco.

This is a nice simple side dish, but I needed more chicken stock then the recipe called for too. Leftovers were good too.

A very quick and easy recipe, and certainly worth making again, but a little on the bland side. Next time I'll add a little something to spice it up.

A big hit when I served it with lamb for some friends. I added some lemon juice and fresh chopped parsley to the recipe as well. It does require more chicken stock than the recipe calls for. A great side dish.

loved the recipe. it was very easy and quick to make. the flavors were wonderful. great accompaniment to just about anything. i've made it several more times for house guests; and they loved it too.

This was a great accompaniment to ossobuco; sauteed onion and mushroom and added fresh chopped parsley at the end. Used more than recommended amount of chicken broth - have more at hand. Also added more cheese to get really creamy consistency. Not quite risotto but close to it and a better side dish with veal. Probably could have prepared ahead and baked for easy service. Not one orzo left on the dish!

It's really good. I've substituted other small pastas when I didn't have orzo on hand.
