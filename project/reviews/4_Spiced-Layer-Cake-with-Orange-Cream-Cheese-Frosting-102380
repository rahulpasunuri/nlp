Cake was super moist and leftovers stayed that way for a week in the fridge! I added a thin layer of Orange Peach jam on the bottom two layers, under the frosting. Delicious!

This cake is wonderful! I made it after I got home from work one weeknight. The entire process- shopping, prepping, cooking, chilling, and assembling- can be done in one evening, and it tastes delicious! Everybody loved it. My boss told me I had very good taste. I didn't think it was too sweet. The spices blended nicely, but I think I will use freshly ground cardamom and fresh grated nutmeg next time, per others' suggestions, and some more orange zest in the cake. I like a lot of frosting, so I made the batch and a half like someone else also suggested. The frosting was delicious- not too sweet, not too rich. I subbed one 8oz pack of neufchatel (sp?) cheese because my store only had 2 packs of real cream cheese left and I needed 3. The substitution was unnoticeable.

The cake was fabulous and very moist. I made it several days ahead and it didn't dry out at all. The frosting was also excellent but there was barely enough to cover the cake. I ended up having to make a last-minute half batch to cover the bare spots on the top and sides of the cake. Next time, I may try orange curd between the layers and use the frosting just for the exterior.

Very moist cake with great spice flavor and an interesting twist from the orange zest. I reduced the sugar amount a bit, it was still a little too sweet for me; will reduce more next time. I baked it in a bundt pan (decided not to do the frosting), doubled the baking time, and cake came out perfectly.

Very good cake. Moist with wonderful flavor. Frosting is a bit sweet but has good flavor as well--I'll cut the sugar a tad next time. Will definitely make again.

Delish! One reviewer's advice to use fresh cardamom seeds and then grind was especially on point -- the smell is heavenly. I baked the cake in 3 sizes for a tiered look -- got raves for the look and more for the flavor. A true keeper.

I made (and reviewed) this as cupcakes the first time. I made the whole cake for my mother's birthday this weekend and I literally cannot get over how incredibly moist and delicious this cake is. I only had two cake pans so I didn't make the three layers, but it didn't seem to matter. I usually use my own cream cheese frosting but I tried the recipe included here. It was a bit on the soft side (it never really firmed up at all) but I did get helluva raves on it because it tasted so good. Really, I've never had a spice cake this good. It's not overly sweet but very moist and spice-y. The frosting was really more of a filling texture - it remained creamier and softer than I generally would have liked, but it was also delicious.

Rating: 4
The only reason this didn't get four forks is because I'll have to mod the recipe slightly in order to make it again. I made this as cupcakes and the liners were soaked in grease when they were done. That said, they were DE- FREAKING-LICIOUS! I will absolutely make them again, but I'm going to drop down the butter and bump up the eggs. Really, you gotta try these - even my first greasy batch were incredibly good.

My fiance is diabetic so I was looking for an extremely moist cake that would retain its moistness even after changing the recipe to whole wheat flour (he can't eat any white flour). Not only did this cake stay moist but it is absolutely delicious!! For any of you out there looking for a spice cake to make with whole wheat flour - this is the one!!

The texture is good, very moist. The frosting was a little too thin. I love orange but it overwhelms the other flavors of this cake. Orange Spiced Layer Cake would be a much better description.

Rating: 4
I chose this cake because it sounded interesting and because I could find almost all of the ingredients here Switzerland. It was wonderful and got rave reviews. I made sure to grind the cardamom just before making. I think this made the cake more flavorful, as preground cardamom can lose it's potency. I also added extra orange zest to the frosting.

My favorite cake, ever. This cake gets rave reviews wherever I take it.

LOVE THIS CAKE..MOIST FRAGRANT LOVELY DIDN'T CHANGE A THING HOWEVER!!!! AFTER I TASTED THE FROSTING I COULDN'T BRING MYSELF TO ICE MY CAKE WITH IT...NOT WHAT I EXPECTED...I WANTED A SWEETER ICING TO OFFSET THE CARDAMOM THAT I LOVE...SO I MADE MY OWN CREAM CHEESE/BUTTER FROSTING...AND I WAS RIGHT IT WAS THE PERFECT COMBO FOR ME/US AND WAS A HUGE HIT..SERVED IT COLD SINCE I THINK IT BEST TO KEEP MY CC/BUTTER FROSTING REFRIDGERATED. WILL MAKE AGAIN AND AGAIN

Absolutely delicious....just as the recipe is written. The frosting was a wonderful compliment. I will definitely make this again.

I've made this to great effect as a cake, and recently decided to make this as cupcakes for sharing at work -- as cupcakes, they take about 15 minutes to bake through. I would recommend doing one tin at a time as the bottom tin ended up a little wet when I did two tins in the oven at once. The yield is about 36 cupcakes if you fill with your trusty ice cream/cookie disher (I'd say about half full?) If you make cupcakes, you might be able to use up all the frosting if you go pretty heavy on 'em. I ended up doing just a mid-sized rosette piped in the middle of each one (can still see the cake all the way around) and had a lot left over. Note that people will still offer to take the frosting off your hands in spoonfuls, because cream cheese frosting is good. It's fun to play "Guess the spices" when you serve them to people. Good stuff!

The best spice cake I've ever had with a wonderful combination of spices. Cake was very moist and light, although it needed a few more minutes in the oven. Frosting was very sweet but tasty. It was thin when first made, but set up nicely in fridge overnight. I used dried orange peel, but will definitely use fresh next time to add to the flavor. This is a keeper, all the guests loved it.

I made the frosting from this cake to go with the orange layer cake and it was superb. I also added a little orange juice which inhanced the flavor alot. I would highly recommend this icing.

Wow; this was delicious! Added about 1/3 cup of applesauce to the cake batter, and a little orange juice to the frosting per the recommendation, and it was so moist! Everyone loved it; will definitely make again!

Excellent cake--very moist and not too sweet. The orange frosting was wonderful. I added a little fresh orange juice to the frosting which made it even more delicious. Also, for the cake, instead of cardamon (which was rather expensive) I just used a tiny bit more of the other spices and it was great.

Rating: 3
Wonderful flavor for both the cake and frosting. However, having a diabetic family memeber, I made some changes that didn't seem to effect the recipe at all. I substituted the flour for half cake flour and half whole wheat flour, and made the change from regular sugar (in the cake only) to fructose. See also my frosting changes. My non-dietary changes were adding a tiny bit more of each spice and additional orange zest. Next time I will seperate the eggs, beat the whites to meringue texture, add the yolks with the sugar and butter, than add in the beaten whites last. I know that will make the cake a little less dense in texture.

I've made this three times now and the request keep comming. the cardimom and orange flavours together make this one of the most delicious cakes I have ever had. Not so much a hit with the kids but the adults all love it.

This is a great cake for a special occasion. It is dense, but very flavorful! The frosting can be runny, but the orange really compliments the flavors in the cake. Don't omit the cardomom or the orange, as these flavors make the cake unique!

this was a lovely cake, but nothing extraordinary. it was a little greasy but this was hid by the frosting, also good. i tasted the day it was made, so maybe it gets better with time--but i won't make this again--not that memorable.

Wow....what an amazing cake! I made it for my brother's birthday (he specifically asked for a spice cake), and he declared it "the best spice cake he's ever had". I made it exactly by the recipe, and it was perfect...do NOT omit the cardamom! It gives the cake an edge other spice cakes don't have. And the frosting is perfect...not too sweet, and it didn't overwhelm the cake, just complimented it. Can't wait to make it again!

This is terrific. I followed the recipes exactly. We liked the cake's texture and taste very much. The frosting is delicious and for me it was the right amount.

I've made this cake at least 4 times with consistent results. A certified family favorite in my family--and I won a baking contest using this recipe! Very moist cake, frosting is just the right amount for a thin layer all over. Flavor is old-fashioned, and I recommend not changing the spices at all--I think the cardamom is the secret to this cake. Very nice for the fall.

Rating: 3
I followed cake recipe except I only added 1/2 t of cardamom, next time I will omit. I also halved the butter in the frosting. I think next time I will omit the sour cream as I found it a tad creamy. The icing recipe was more than adequate for my 3 layers. I liked the cake fine but others went on and on about how good it was, one person said it was the best cake she ever had.

Rating: 3
This is a very tasty cake. It is not a "wow" cake, but tasty nevertheless. I would recommend omitting the sour cream in the frosting--I loved the taste, but the frosting was melting as I spread it (despite 1 1/2 hours in the fridge). You MUST double the frosting recipe, or your cake will be half nude! (The recipe as written is only enough for a crumb coat.). I piped frosting decoratively around the edges which looked very nice. I also recommend orange strips for a garnish. I froze the cake and took it out 2 hours before serving. Note: I always sub orange oil for zest--easier, and no flecks.

This is a great cake. Comes out looking beautiful and tastes fantastic. I will probably try leaving out the stick of butter next time in the frosting and did up the amount of orange in the frosting to 1TBL. CAke is very light and moist, yummy

I've made this twice - it is magnificent and NOT for those watching their fat intake (below!) - the second cake I made with tangerine instead of orange and it was equally delightful. Plan on trying with lemon as per previous suggestion (I love suggestions on how to "tweak" recipes - it really makes the internet great!)

I made this for my husband's birthday party and got compliments from a professional pastry chef. He tried to figure out at first where we'd bought it! Since my husband prefers lemon to orange, that was the citrus I used and it worked wonderfully.

Must...stop....eating....cake.... This is really really good folks. I left out the orange and used cold strong coffee instead of milk but followed the recipe to a t otherwise. Not too heavy,nice moist crumb, subtle spice overtones that improve over night (at first I thought it was not spicey enough). As for the er...bakers freaking about the fat content DID YOU NOT READ THE INGREDIENTS BEFORE BAKING??? If I trying to bake "light" I'd make a sponge or Angelfood cake, It seems a shame that a few thoughtless people would lower the rating of a incrediable recipe..... Would I bake and eat ssomething like this everyday??? No way BUT every so often heck yeah. I always read the recipe first look at the ingredients then judge what I'm going to cook. Sorry to ramble folks Try this cake it is worth every calorie...:)

I made this cake exactly as the recipe was written and found it to be neither heavy or greasy...as a matter of fact it was flavorful, light and moist. The recipe filled three pans perfectly and the layers came out evenly plus the frosting recipe was not too much or too little. I made the cake two nights before serving and frosted it the morning before the dinner. In the 48 hours, the spices and orange melded perfectly. The frosting was tangy, a perfect foil. The cake was met with RAVE REVIEWS by everyone at the dinner/surprise birthday party. People had seconds, and not a crumb was left. Bit hit! I like this recipe AS IS!

I made it last week. It was so heavy, with the sour cream and whole milk and all the butter -- it was greasy and just too over the top for my taste. I felt like with one bite, I had eaten a week's worth of cholesterol, and it wasn't worth it.

Fantastic recipe. All my guests loved it and my husband and I enjoyed the leftovers during the rest of the week. I made it in two pans rather than three and only used half of the frosting. I also omitted the butter from the frosting as per the suggestions of other reviewers.

This cake was delicious! Even people who say they "don't like cake" requested the recipe. I cut the frosting recipe in half and only frosted between the layers and on top, since I don't like too much frosting, and that worked perfectly -- looked great and the flavor of the cake came through. Definitely one I'm adding to my files.

Great returns for little effort. Decorated with orange and red pansies for a bit of colour and all guests raved. The sponge is moist and soft and the frosting does not over power the spices in the cake. I have made this cake several times and will continue to keep in my favourites list.

Awesome cake!! Great mix of flavors and so, so easy to whip up fast. i used 2 10in. pans and they worked fine. delicious cream cheese frosting--made with half the orange zest and thought it was perfect. i made it for my mother-in-law's bday and it was a hit with all, even the youngest of the bunch! rave reviews!! liked it even better after a day or two...the flavors melded and it got even moister. (i also experienced the sinking middle of the cake when i pulled it out of the oven but it looked fine when frosted.)

This could be my all time favorite Bon Appetit recipe!! The spices are perfect. It's easy and the three layers make a great presentation. I didn't like the orange frosting too much, so I usually cheat (shhh)and buy a couple of cans of ready-made cream cheese frosting.

If I could I would give this 3.5 forks. This cake got rave reviews! Used 10 inch pans, substituted neufatchel for the cream cheese and then used only 8oz and not 16. Spread was thinner, but squeaked by (not really noticeable) & still tasted great. Also, reduced butter in cake (1.5 sticks) and the frosting. Still got a super-buttery & melt in your mouth taste that way & less fat!

Someone at work requested this recipe for their birthday and it was so good. People were actually eating 3 or 4 pieces each!!! I used the wrong size pans and didn't have all the spices listed (I cheated with a generic pumpkin pie spice) and it still turned out great. I followed other people's recommendation and halved the amount of orange in the frosting and it was perfect!!!

this is a tasty, easy cake. i didn't find the cream-cheese frosting that exciting, and it was a bit too orangy even though i used the prescribed amount of peel. the cake layers themselves were delicious. the frosting set to a more firm consistency after a couple of days and the cake tasted a lot better as leftovers because of this.

I actually made this cake in two bundt pans and turned it into a pumpkin for my husband to bring to work. I added about 2 teaspoons of orange juice to the frosting to give it a little bit of a kick and I also tinted it with some orange coloring paste to give it a "pumpkin look." It got rave reviews from his co-workers! Definitely a keeper!

Best spice cake I ever made. Absolutely delicious. I use half the amount of orange peel in the frosting for a lighter flavor. Hint: don't let the butter get too warm, and beat the butter/sugar until it's really light and fluffy for best texture - this could take a long time in cool weather, but is worth it.

Is this cake supposed to sink when it comes out of the oven? I'm not sure! It was really dense and moist which I wasn't expecting - but considering there's only 2 cups of flour maybe it is right! The frosting was good! I'd make that again - would be good on carrot cake I bet!
