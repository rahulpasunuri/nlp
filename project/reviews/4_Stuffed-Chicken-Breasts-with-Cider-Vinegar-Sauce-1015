Although this was really tasty, for me it's definitely NOT worth the effort. I think I spent almost 4 hours total preparing this dish. I don't mind spending that amount of time for a special occasion, but then it better be over-the-top. This was not. The wine pairings were not quite right. I paired it with a nice Pinot. That's the right wine for this dish. Also, I served it with a wild rice & mushrooms and a side of roasted brussels sprouts. That was a great combo.

Delicious but time consuming. I would cut back on the sugar next time. I used sundried tomatoes as someone had suggested and substituted drid cherries for the apricots. Used baby spinach. Really tasty and nice looking for a special occasion.

I loved the sauce, wonderful, will double the amount next time. It made the dish. I used half brown sugar (more complex but used less because it is sweeter) and white and split the difference between using a bit of corn starch and the quantity of butter called for to finish the sauce. I hit the perfect consistency that was delicate and covered the back of a spoon. I found a unfiltered vinegar that was great addition. I can't really review the chicken, I used sausage, apple, raisins, mushrooms, and spinach for stuffing. I did think it benefited by being made the day before. I used a lot of stuffing so I had to tie it. I think a half of a chicken breast was way to large to be considered a single serving, especially assuming you are serving a side.

Morning after addendum. Leftovers were not good in my opinion and one of my dinner guests simply said "not your best work." Next time I want autumneal flavors, I'll opt for pork or some sort of Moroccan inspired recipe and pass on all the sugar and butter.

This recipe was time consuming as warned and so I budgeted (and used) extra time and also got other dishes going while things cooked (thanks reviewers!). It's also counter space intensive so by all means prep in advance if you have a small kitchen. Results were good, everyone had a clean plate but me (too much time with that chicken, I'd lost my enthusiasm a bit) and portions were generous. I would not make this recipe again as is because of all the butter (didn't notice that last step till my guests were here, yikes!). The skin on the chicken could also probably be removed if you're prefer cooking without, I think the pan browning and the stuffing would keep it moist. Served with wild rice and salad, but would recommend an even lighter side than salad, maybe green beans?

Made this recipe for a dinner party for 12 because of all the rave reviews. I also liked that it could be made in advance. I do not want to spend all day in the kitchen and then have a long evening entertaining. This is what I would do differently. I would pound out the breast to make the thicker parts more even before stuffing. The recommendation was to brown, stuff, and refrigerate. Then bake before serving. I would finish the recipe by baking immediately and then refrigerate. To serve, slice and pour the sauce over the meat and then microwave to reheat. The leftovers heated this way are very moist and since the flavors have married, it is better than the original dinner. Serving sizes are very generous. One recipe was to serve 6, but I would say it serves at least 8-10. Since the chicken is served sliced, it goes farther that giving each guest a whole breast. Not sure if I would make it again as it does take a lot of time to prepare-especially when you double the recipe.

Very tolerant of substitutions! We made this with what we had on-hand. Browned chicken before stuffing as others advised. SAUCE: used frozen pearl onions instead of shallots--also omitted last 4 Tb of butter, used a bit of flour to thicken. Used turkey and chicken stock. Sweet, but pairs well with chicken. Stuffing: Used dried Chinese shiitake mushrooms, soaked for a half hour. Used a mix of golden raisins, dried figs, and prunes instead of apricots. Used sundried tomatoes packed in olive oil, drained and chopped. Note: at 425 edges of chicken and stuffing get crispy. Lower heat or enjoy the crunch as we did!

Are you kidding me!?! So unbelieveably good! The best chicken dish I've made/found so far! I really hope to find other winner dishes like this. I loved it so much, I purchased his book to see what other goodies were in there. Made this receipe twice. The 1st being so much tastier than the 2nd for 1 simple reason (see #3). Here's the modifications I tried: 1. Browned the chicken as other reviewer suggested. Then stuffed it and used a toothpick to hold. 2. Did not add extra butter to the sauce at the end b/c (a) way heathier and (b) doesn't need it - still really, great sauce! 3. Here's what made the main difference b/w the 2 times I made it. After browning and stuffing the chicken. I let it sit in the fridge for 2-3 days. It really was much tastier than the 2nd time I made this dish, which is when it sat in the fridge for only for 2-3 hours. *Enjoy.

As others have noted, the sauce is fantastic and you definitely do not need to add all of the extra butter. The chicken breasts were delicious. I combined the ingredients (after cooking as directed) in the food processor and both stuffed the chicken breasts and made the sauce a day ahead. The execution for Christmas dinner was easy with advance prep and the dish was a huge hit.

Quite good. I used a combination of fresh and dried apricots for diversity. In retrospect, might have been better with golden, rather than regular, raisins. The sauce is a bit sweet but well complemented by the chicken's filling. Restaurant quality.

Wow! This makes a dish that the chicken takes a back seat and all the wonderful flavors are enjoyed. I timed the amount of time from beginning to end...and I think I'm a pretty fast cook and it was 1 1/2 hours to the time it was taken from the oven. I cut boneless skinless breasts like a pita and filled. I added a little feta...but would not next time as I don't think it is needed. I did saute 4 min each time but would reduce it to 2:30 because they were 1/2 cooked and it was only the inside of the chicken that needed to cook. I think 15 min at 425 may be enough. This is just wonderful even though it is time consuming....and amazingly, I had everything in the pantry except the apricots so it doesn't really need fancy ingredients for a very fancy taste! Company quality. I also did not add any butter to the sauce in the end for dietary reasons and thought the sauce was great as is without the guilt!

This is a keeper. Served this for a small dinner party along with pecan rice pilaf and buttered grean beans with dill. It was a big hit. I didn't think the prep was as bad as a few others mentioned, I used the slice and chop features on a small food processor and it went pretty fast. The only problem I had is that I couldn't find skin on boneless breast so I had to bone them myself. I also had way too much spinach, I think you could use half the amount called for. I think I will try browning the breast before stuffing as someone else mentioned. They don't lay flat when stuffed.

I love this recipe and have made it many times. One thing I think I have improved upon is the color of the sauce which is decidedly yummy. I now add about 1/2 cup of carrot juice to the reduction and get a much deeper color, very close to the color of the apricots.

This was great as is and while I love feta, the recipe as written is fantastic. Our guests said that it was the best chicken they've ever had. One of our guests doesn't eat red meat and is allergic to shellfish so I searched high and low for a chicken recipe that I could get excited about...the recipe didn't disappoint!

Wonderful recipe for elegant dinner for 24 people. Yes, a lot of work, but worth it. Everything can be done ahead of time and simply bake before serving. Followed recipe ingredients but quadrupled it. I browned the chicken before stuffing it, as another reviewer suggested. Also used a apple corer with plunger to stuff a pocket within the chicken breast instead of opening it like a book. I put the stuffing into the corer and used the plunger to push it into the pocket I created by slicing into the thicker end. Another reviewer posted photos of this process, it was a great time saver. The best $4.99 kitchen gadget! This kept the stuffing in place while baking. I could have made a larger pocket, more stuffing would have been even better. I wish I had removed the tender for more uniform appearance. Loved the sauce! A real winner from a first class restaurant.

This is an excellent recipe. I recommend making it a day ahead. I made extras and they were MUCH better on the second day. The various flavors had time to mature.

This dish was excellent and not hard to repeat quickly once you know the recipe. The chicken had a buttery taste and the sauce was a nice complement. If you are short on time or you are counting calories, skip the sauce, the chicken can stand alone. Enjoy!

This is a great dish for entertaining. It is fairly labor intensive but you can do most of it ahead of time. I used toothpicks instead of kitchen twine. I also had two vegetarians attend my 23 person dinner. I just topped two balsamic vinaigrette marinated and grilled portabellas with the spinach and fruit stuffing and shaved a little parm on the top then baked. They loved it and asked for the recipe!

The sauce on this recipe is wonderful. I used it again with beef tips and rice. I stuffed the chicken differently than suggested. I used spinach, sundried tomatoes, and provolone cheese to stuff mine. Then I topped it with the sauce. Wonderful!

Rating: 4
Excellent receipe that requires some prep but nothing ridiculous. I made only one change to the recipe, which was to put the stuffing mixture in a food processor and pulse a few time. This made the mixture more consistant and easier to stuff into the chicken. Also the time it took to reduce the suace was about 50 min not 25min. I think the size pot/pan you are using will greatly affect this. I browned the chicken in a mixture of peanut oil and butter which worked perfect.

After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to make this for the first time for guests. I should know better! The sauce and stuffing were easy enough to make. I added feta to the stuffing. The problem came with the chicken breasts. They were large breasts and because of that I couldn't really fold them over like a book. I took all of the stuffing out and pounded them some. That worked better. I also added some cornstarch to the sauce as it was very thin. The overall receipe results were not at all what I expected. Marginal at best. The sauce was oaky, although not great (I "only" put in 3 TLBS butter). The stuffing flavors did not come through enough to enhance the dish. I guess I would recommend pounding chicken thin and using more stuffing (with feta) in each breast.

I made this for company and it was great. It takes a lot of preparation but can be done in advance. I did it the day before and then just had cook it. I did not add the cheese as suggested but would next time. THE SAUCE IS TO DIE FOR!

Every time I make this dish I think two things: why didn't I invite more people to dinner? Why didn't I start the preparation 4 hours ago? Not a weeknight dish (it takes about 3hrs of intensive labor to make), but a true gourmet spectacle for a weekend of entertaining. The sauce is especially good, and presentation is superb. I highly recommend it (being forewarned of the time it takes to prepare).

Yes! It's a winner. Great crowd pleaser. For a side vegie, I just made french string beans with a little butter & lemon. *Any other suggestions for a side dish?* For starch, I went with a simple white rice, and it worked well.

This is a rich dish but a definite winner. Takes a bit of preparation but it's tasty and well worth it... great for dinner parties too since you can make it all in advance. I didn't have all the ingredients in the kitchen so I used prunes instead of raisins and added feta cheese (with sundried tomato seasoning) to the fruit mix... it was excellent!

If you want a recipe that offers both taste and a beautiful presentation, this is it! Be prepared to spend lots of time in the kitchen though. I served the fanned slices with a scoop of rice almond pilaf. Sixteen guests tonight. Lots of compliments!

Subbed cranberries for the raisins, used toothpicks to secure the stuffing/chicken. Didn't add the extra 4 tbs. of butter at the end for the sauce but thickened it with cornstarch slurry. Thought the cider sauce was too sweet on its own, but with the chicken, fantastic! I'm usually not fond of fruit and meat together, but this was really elegant and special. Added feta to the stuffing mixture, as previously suggested, which lended a creaminess to the filling. Really good dish for entertaining because it's unique, tasty, and can do ahead! Does take time though!

I agree with past reviews - the recipe takes some time but it is fantastic..I used cranberries and added feta to the stuffing and it tasted spectacular - the flavours were lovely and the chicken was very moist. I made the sauce and the stuffing the night before and also stuffed the chicken. Definitely a recipe you can make ahead to save time! I appreciated all the other reviews too!

I have to agree with the cook from Philadelphia... I made this for my husband and was delighted and tickled when he picked up the (mostly) empty plate and licked the remaining sauce from it! That was a first for him... I made a few substitutions due to what I had on hand (no apricots, currents for raisins, added feta, etc.) but it still came out great. I think whatever you had in there would be fantastic as long as there's plenty of the sauce!

I live in Philadelphia and now I know why Le Bec Fin charges what they do for dinner! It takes forever to make this recipe. The end result is delicious, but do not attempt this if you are time constricted. I will use the sauce recipe again for other chicken dishes and make it ahead of time as it does make one want to lick the plate!

I prepared this dish for a dinner party, stuffing the chicken and making the sauce ahead so I could just toss it in the oven before dinner, but our power went out just as our guests were arriving. Instead, I cooked the chicken outside on our gas grill (heated the sauce out there, too, although I used only half the butter which was fine)and it was wonderful! I think the grilled flavor really added to the flavor of the dish. Everyone loved it!

Rating: 3
I LOVED the flavors in this dish. It was time consuming, but I found only in rolling and securing the chicken breats - the sauce and stuffing can be made simultaneously and fairly quickly. After adding the butter the sauce was still very thin, so we added a bit of cornstarch/water combo to thicken. We served each breast unsliced (they were fairly small) over a bed of spinach with a rounded spoonful of brown rice on the side. My guests loved it!

Rating: 3
This is a great dish, especially given the fact that you can prepare it ahead of time. I followed the recipe as written, with the exception of the cooking method. I baked the chicken at 425 for about a half hour, which I thought was easier considering the stuffing. They cooked perfectly. Will definitely make again!

Made the sauce and fruit mixture (w/ extra apricots but no mushrooms or raisans) as directed. Used grape tomatoes, seeded the first time but not the second time. Served the sauce and fruit mixture together over plain grilled chicken and brown rice. It was very easy. The sauce and fruit mixture are very flavorful. My husband loved it.

Very nice -received RAVE reviews from my guests. I too substituted dried cranberries. And anything that can be prepared in advance gets an extra two points from me!

The dish was very good, and beautiful, but would have needed to be transcendental to justify the effort. I used dried cranberries instead of raisins, and Swiss chard from my garden instead of the spinach, and those both seemed like good decisions. Also, I think the sauce recipe makes more than necessary and used a bit too much butter.

Very good. Took awhile, but worth it. I inserted the filling after the browning, and then did without the strings and it came out just fine. Dried cranberries are a good alternative to raisins, and a little cognac or Drambuie is just right.

Really great. I substituted sundried tomatoes for regular tomatoes, threw a little cognac into the sautee of fruit and mushrooms, and instead of stuffing the chicken, just baked everything together with the chicken(including the spinach--chopped). I served it with wild rice pilaf and a green salad, with the California Orange Walnut Pie. Very autumnal and all the flavors went together beautifully. Great with a good, oakey Chardonnay.

Made this for dinner last night and it was YUMMY! I used dried prunes instead of the apricots and raisins. I also used skinless breasts and pounded them... It was a bit of a pain to roll them up and secure them with the string though. I also used shitake mushrooms and tomato confit (instead of chopped tomatoes). The flavors really blended well. Served it with some Navarro Pinot Noir grape juice from Mendocino. Yum!

A friend and I made this for dinner last night and it was magnifique! I must admit that we did cheat and used already prepared stuffed chicken breasts, one stuffed with spinach mix and the other with asparagus, from a new wonderful store here called The Fresh Market. We prepared them as directions called for in this recipe (easy), and used this wonderful Cider Vinegar Sauce over them; delicious! Please note: it did not take as long as the recipe called for, for any of the sauce preparation steps, so be careful not to reduce it too much! Barb and I loved it! I think she's making it for her husband tonight! Enjoy! KIMBER

This was a good recipe, though I made changes: substituted thawed, drained spinach for steamed fresh (that's what I had), used dried cherries instead of raisins, mixed it all together. I also used skinless breasts and pounded them till even, stuffed, folded over and secured with small skewers. The main changes were the sauce: I used only low sodium chicken stock (no beef stock at all); I prefer balsamic to cider vinegar, so my sauce used balsamic with a tiny amount of apricot jam instead of sugar. It was excellent, though different from the original recipe.

An outstanding chicken dish. To make things easier, cut "pockets" into the breasts, fill with stuffing, and close with turkey skewers. Remove skewers before serving. The cider sauce is the perfect accompanyment to the dish - although it does benefit greatly from the addition of a thickening agents such as corn starch.

This is a fantastic recipe. It is a bit time consuming to split and stuff and tie the breasts, but really is worth it. Stuff and brown the breasts and make the sauce the day before your dinner party. To serve 8 I doubled the recipe and had just one breast left over. I used a mixed variety of mushrooms and this really added a nice element. Try it! Has anyone thought of pounding the breasts flat and stuffing them or rolling them?

It was a delicious dish, but awfully involved. I didn't stuff the breasts because the tomatoes, plums and mushrooms were just too much. I piled the stuff atop the breasts and baked til done. Sauce was excellent, but everything took too long.
