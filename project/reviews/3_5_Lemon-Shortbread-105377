This was a nice, buttery traditional shortbread recipe. Add more lemon zest for punch. Will definately make again.

Delicious. The dough is very dry, but it bakes up fine.

So far so good. It is in the oven right now. I did not notice the missing C in the cornstarch. I used 1/4 C. white rice flour, I always use some rice flour for the texture it gives. I was making it in the food processor so it was quick and easy. I subbed 1/4 tsp. Boyajian Lemon oil for the zest it is smelling pretty wonderful. I am trying out a new shortbread pan and am experimenting with different recipes in it. Looking for the perfect one.

3.5 forks actually. It's a very delicious authentic shortbread in texture and butter flavour, the lemon zest makes it even better. The great thing really is though how easy it is to whisk this up in no time. It's a saver. Oh, I did not have corn starch on hand so I just added 1/4 cup more of flour and it was fine.

These turned out tough and didn't have a bold or interesting flavor. I may have overworked the dough which the recipe warns against. Nonetheless, I'd try another shortbread recipe.

Beleive it or not, but I have made this by adding 2 teaspoons of freshly chopped basil and it tastes amazing! I am going to try it with fresh thyme in the future. I think that citrus and herbs taste great together and most likely any citrus-herb combination could be tried with amazing results.

Easy to make and melt in your mouth good. Everyone raved about this cookie.

So delicious! And easy too, just zzzip! in the cuisinart. I made one 10" round pan, and ate enough dough raw that I didn't have enough for another pan. Instead I mushed out small clumps inside cookie cutters to make shaped cookies - cute and yummy, next time I will try dipping the shapes in chocolate. (Shapes take less time to bake than the panfull, so watch them.)

Excellent. I worried because the dough didn't hold together in much of a ball, but I pressed it into the pan and baked anyway and it come out wonderful. Will definitely make again. Served with fresh strawberry ice cream from this site. Yum!

To the Cook from Seattle, i think the recipe should read 1/4 cup cornstarch. If you dun't fancy that, substitute the cornstarch with rice flour (obtainable from asian shops too). It is more authentic in my opinion 6 give a "crunch" to theshortbread

excellent and tender shortbread. i ate too many warm out of the oven. like others, mine didn't come together as a dough, more like crumbles. i added 2 T more butter, then patted the crumbles into two pans. baked for only 30 minutes in dark nonstick pans, because i wanted more tender then crunchy. used orange and lemon zest. also iced these with lemon icing for an extra special company dessert.

Well, so I ate these raw (couldn't resist pinching little bits of dough), hot (had to grab a wedge right out of the oven), room temp (in a civilized manner, i.e. when guests were present), and frozen (just couldn't wait for them to thaw a little)... every state was amazing. I will make these over and over again, perhaps with a bit more lemon zest the next time.

I have question on this recipe. How much cornstarch do you use? It says 1/4 cornstarch. I looked up another similar recipe, which used 1/4 Cup, so that is what I did. It has an off-taste, which leaves a somewhat burning sensation in your mouth. Is it 1/4 teaspoon? Thanks

This recipe was quick, easy and delicious. The lemon zest adds just that little touch of flavor. The shortbreads come out crisp and crunchy once they cool. They pack and travel wonderfully. Even overseas!

It was the perfect shortbread recipe! I've got beautiful clay shortbread molds that I've tried several times to use, and the shortbread always breaks coming out.... but I followed this recipe to the letter, and the pieces came out of the mold perfectly! I dusted them with powdered sugar and on a depression glass dish they looked gorgeous.... we had them w/ choc covered strawberries...

This shortbread was very good. I followed the recipe exactly however the dough did not come together like the recipe said - mine resembled flour, almost like it needed more butter. I poured the dough into the pans and flattened it the best I could. In the baking process it came together and once they cooled they were crisp, buttery cookies. Yummy!
