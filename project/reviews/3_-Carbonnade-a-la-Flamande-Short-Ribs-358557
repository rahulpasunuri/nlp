I'm making this today for the 3rd time. Of course it's going to taste somewhat bitter, dark beer, duh! I don't add the prunes just because I don't feel like eating them in this recipe. I use Guinness exclusively and not always the darkest brew; I think any dark beer will be sufficient. What a wonderful meal this makes! Thank you Epicurious.

For people getting a bitter taste from this, I think it's the boiling of the beer. When you see "boil" in the recipe replace it with simmer or almost boiling. Also I don't like too much sweet taste in savory food, so I leave out the prunes and cut way back on the sugar.

Wow...is it possible for a beef stew to taste like a dessert? This turns out so sweet and savory at the same time. I made it to try to recreate the Carbonnade a la Flamande my husband and I had in Belgium. Unfortunately I took my eye off the broth when it was reducing and I burned some of it but I rescued it and put it in a new pot and it didn't seem worse for wear. We served it with some good Belgian beer and "fast-food style" frozen french fries and it was a real stick-to-your ribs treat but man is it filling (and takes a while, you can't make this in a hurry.) Hard to stay away from the leftovers the next day... and yes, I will repeat what others have said, you need to make the bouquet for this recipe and NOT use ground spices as a substitute.

"1)substituting the whole spice bouquet for ground spices can very well lead to bitterness, and over-seasoning." I stated this backwards, sorry. Do use the bouguet garni!

To those who have not achieved the desired results, may I suggest some likely errors; 1)substituting the whole spice bouquet for ground spices can very well lead to bitterness, and over-seasoning. Remember, the bouquet is actually removed at the end of the braising. The flavors of the whole spices are gently imparted to the stew without overpowering. Ground spices by contrast are interspersed in the stew, and will remain there--different results. 2) 16 Prunes and 1/3c. brown sugar is a lot of sweetness!!! Don't add all the sugar at once, but season to taste. Still bitter? see #1. May this duplicate 4fork cancel out another users duplicate 1fork. However, I wish they had a fork category for user error...

Do not hesitate to make this! Similar to Beef Bourguignon, but with different aromatics and the use of beer instead of wine as the braising liquid. The flavors are complex, deep, and the sweetness added from the prunes is delicious. We served the stew with a classic pairing-- french fries and mayonnaise. Truly amazing results-- our guest begged us to send her home with some leftovers!. I made some minor alterations: Chuck Roast cut into 1 1/2" cubes. Doubled amount of onions, added 4 cloves sliced garlic, and cooked them until deeply caramelized and reduced in volume. (definitely longer than 5min cook time here...) I also used Chimay Red Label Belgian Ale. Can't understand why you would use anything other than a good Belgian Ale. They often have a lovely fruity/floral spicy flavor and aroma which adds tremendous depth to the dish. This dish takes time and affection from browning the meat (without crowding), to caramelizing onions properly, and watching the pot gently simmer for two hours, tasting constantly... Heavenly.

This was good, if not a bit unusual tasting for me. My fiance enjoyed it, and we both agreed it was not bitter or too sweet. I used powdered cinnamon and star anise, cut back on the sugar a bit, didn't have prunes so I used a handful of Craisins. Cooked in the oven at 300 for 2 1/2 hours, very tender meat. The quality of the beer (or any alchohol) for a braise is VERY important to the taste...when I use cheap beer or wine for cooking, the result is often bitter or sour. I used New Castle and Guinness here.

I thought this recipe was fantastic. I used a teaspoon of chinese five spice because I couldn't find star anise. Im not sure what I did different than the people that have review this recipe but I had 6 different people rave about it, at different times. I used Newcastle brown ale.

Please do not make this... I made it last week for a dinner party... I threw it away... the waste of time, and the expense, kind of makes me cross, it should be tested before the recipes are printed... I wish they had a fork category for awful. Fran

Being a beer lover, I was so excited to make this recipe! However, like one of the other reviewers, I got an unpleasant bitter flavor that was hard to get past. I'm unsure where it came from. The meat still came out very tender for me, but I just didn't care for the flavor of the braising liquid. I think this recipe needs some tweaking, but I'm not sure what exactly needs to be changed.

Not very good as made. Next time I would reduce amount of prunes and/or brown sugar as it was too sweet. Also, I would braise in the oven on a low temp instead of simmer on stovetop. Oven braising would result in MUCH more tender meat.

Too sweet. Should have known from the amount of brown sugar. Its a waste of good beer, you get none of the savory flavor. I'll braise in beer again, but omit the sugar.
