Delicious. Had to double the amount of sauce but not the cilantro. Healthy and good tasting. Portions are on the small side.

Great recipe with strong, complex flavors and a nice spiciness. You will probably have to visit Uwajimaya's or similar Asian Food store for some of the ingredients. Sichuan peppercorns are marketed as Prickly Ash. Also, Lan chi is "chili paste w/ garlic", no chili-bean in the name, but still the ingredient you want. I also served this in lettuce leaves, as it helped moderate the spiciness. Leftovers for lunch will go in soft corn tortillas.

This was a huge hit with my family, and will become a dinner staple. I made this mostly as written, except I forgot to buy Sichuan peppercorns, so I skipped that and added extra chile oil. I had about 50% more chicken than the recipe called for, so I doubled the sauce which was just barely enough. I also added shredded carrots for texture and color and chopped peanuts because my husband likes them. Despite living in Houston, I couldn't find a mild long red chile, so I used 1 jalapeno seeded and chopped. I served it wrapped in butter lettuce.
