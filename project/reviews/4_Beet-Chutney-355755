I've made this recipe countless times... for parties, family holidays, and everything in between! I always make a double batch. It's great served by itself with toasted bagette or crackers but to really take it to the next level, put it in a baked brie (puff pastry with brie topped with chutney inside)! Super easy, looks very impressive, and one of the best appetizers I've had in awhile! Note: As previously mentioned, it does take longer to cook off the liquids but I feel the flavor is fabulous!

I really like this, made it a couple of times - I only think it's a bit too sour, and takes much longer to cook off the liquid than indicated, so think reducing the amount of vinegar to 1/3 cup might solve both problems at once.

I made this recipe as written and found it a bit sweet for my taste. I compensated by toasting and grinding a teaspoon each of mustard seed and cumin. It was extraordinary!! I would highly recommend following the magazine's suggestion of serving this chutney atop toasted baguette with softened goat cheese. It makes for an amazing light lunch or fabulous canapes.

I've made this twice, once substituting the red wine vinegar with rice vinegar, once with champagne vinegar. (Good old Law of What's On Hand.....) Delicious both times; doubled the recipe for in-law Thanksgiving and it was totally welcome in a household of cranberry lovers. Extra good if you sautee the beet greens as well and eat the chutney on top.

please allow me 4 forks in advance of preparation: i make and preserve chutney like people eat popcorn, and this recipe just sounds right. i'm looking for colorful and flavorful sides or sauces, and although our summer garden has long since passed, the beets i planted early march still have lovely bulbs ready to pull. i have to assume that the PERSIMMON note is a mistake. deep breath...move on...

Why is Persimmon listed in the main ingredients and not anywhere in the recipe?
