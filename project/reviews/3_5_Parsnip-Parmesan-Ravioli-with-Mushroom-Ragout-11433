An easy recipe that offers a tasty result. I made just the ragout and served it over polenta for a vegetarian entree. Thanks to the reviewer from Austin for his/her slight modifications: I, too, increased the garlic for my garlic- loving crowd and pureed some mushrooms to thicken the mixture. And while I think it's important that a variety of mushrooms are used, the preparation works well with any combination you may have on hand.

Definitely roast the parsnips and even add a little cream or liquid to the puree to make it into a better texture and definitely amp up the seasonings. Wish I would have followed my instincts or other reviews and done so. What I turned out with was a marginal ravioli (even though I did make my own delicious fresh pasta) with an ok, but not completely fitting ragout.

Spectacular! I roasted the parsnips and added water to the filling to get the creamy texture. I added more parmesan, sage, salt, and pepper until the flavors seemed to meld. A healthy does of salt makes a huge difference in both the ravioli and the ragout. The result had a subtle and complex flavor that was incredible. My ravioli didn't fall apart at all, either (I used less filling, crimped the edges with a fork, and made sure the water was barely simmering). It was SO incredibly good - I can't wait to make it again!

Cheated on this and didn't make the ravioli - used a fresh ravioli with chicken and roasted garlic instead. HOWEVER, with a few modifications based on other reviews, the mushroom ragout turned out great! I sauteed the onions with a 1/2 tablespoon of butter, 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil, and a little chicken broth. I upped the garlic to five cloves and I pureed about half of the mushrooms with a little chicken broth into a paste (helped to make the ragout thicker). Followed the rest of the directions but added a little Worcestershire, soy sauce and red wine vinegar and about 1/3 cup of parmesan cheese. Very flavorful and fairly healthy - we really enjoyed this and will make it again!

Although I like the dish well enough, I found the ragout to be rather bland and my husband found the parsnip flavour too strong. An interesting idea. Perhaps it would work better if the ragout were thicker and richer. The parsnips would definetly be more mellow if roasted.

My partner and I made this for the first time for company (We commonly make new dished for company). The ragout is fine but needs more seasonning, I added mores sage, about 1/2 cup white wine, and my partner added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. That helped a lot. he ravioli we left pretty much as the recipe calls for. The dish was a hit. However, next time we plan on adding red wine instead of white and anchovy paste instead of Worcestershire sauce. We'll add the red wine before the tomatoes and let it reduce too.

i made the ragout only. it was good, but quite boring. life's too short for boring. I wont make it again.

Three generations of woman joined in the making of this recipe - and it turned out very well. The mushroom sauce would also be great on a simple polenta. We paired this dish with the Jicama and Cilantro Relish (Gourmet 1999), a refreshing compliment.

Although I may be in the minority here, I really liked the parsnip ravioli. I thought it was the perfect pairing with the mushroom ragout. Highly recommend it!

For this I actually didn't make the ravioli but used the ragoux in a dish. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. I added it to some frozen pierogies that I had and the meal tasted like it was straight out of an Italian restaurant. I added a little soy sauce and 4 cloves of garlic instead of two. I will definitely make this again.

I served this recipe to some friends, and it was well-received, but I personally found the parsnip filling a bit too sweet for my liking. The mushroom ragout was pretty tasty though, so I may make it again with a more typical or savory filling.

Loved this recipe, although I made a few changes due to a fussy husband. I ended grinding up the cooked and cooled mushrooms into a nice paste and added them and alot of parmesan cheese and some cream to the sauce. also, steaming the ravioli worked better than boiling them... they tended to fall apart too easliy. But this recipe was amazing and I could eat it over and over again. Also the husband that hates mushrooms loved it more than I did.

very filling. the ragout is delicious, but parsnip as a filling, after the first bite or two, is just a little too much for me.
