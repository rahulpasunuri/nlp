We used guinea hen - and did just one for the two of us. I didn't do anything fussy w/the potatoes - I just roasted them w/the guinea and used tarragon dijon mustard instead of whole grain since that's what I had on hand The rest of the recipe was followed and the guinea was fabulous. Occasional basting w/melted butter. Just a simple, wonderful dish.

This is now my standard recipe for roasted chicken, I prefer to use organic kosher chicken ( instead of the hens ) and halve the recipe for 1 chicken. excellent every time! I used to be vegetarian!

Absolutely delicious. I used only one guinea hen for the three of us but kept the rest of the ingredients the same. Had some wonderful leftovers.

This is really lovely, and a nice change from the usual. Finding the guinea hen is well worth the trouble, especially if you brine & dry it well. I like it with some nice garlicky filet beans and a good rose-- try it!

This dish was wonderful! I've made it a dozen times for guests and it gets rave reviews EVERY TIME. I use the cornish game hens instead and reduce the cooking time by 10 minutes. I use the pan drippings to make a mustard cream sauce (with the addition of heavy whipping cream, some chicken broth and 1-2 TB of seeded mustard). Delicious!
