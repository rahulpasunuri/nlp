Yummy! I used chicken broth instead of water and added a few Tbsps flour to thicken after sauteeing veggies... otherwise followed to the letter. Oh, OK, also added about a half cup cream and some frozen corn. We loved it. Yum. Will make it again.

This was an excellent chowder for a cold winter night. I used thyme rather than dill because that is what I had, and substituted clam juice for the water. I used the irregularly shaped tail pieces in the chowder and saved the center of the filet for more elegant presentations.

This is delicious with a few changes. Add 2 cups heavy cream along with the 2 cups of milk and 2 tsp of fish base. I also grill my Salmon first to give it a smokey taste.

I make this all the time for my family - everyone, including my 2 yr. old twins, love it. Very cozy. I agree it can be a little bland as is so I add a pinch of dried thyme and a bay leaf and use stock instead of water. I also add corn to make it a bit heartier. For those whose soup seperated or curdled, that usually happens when you use lower fat milk as opposed to whole milk or cream. To 'fix' it you're going to have to add some fat, specifically in the form of a roux - a mixture of butter and flour. Since you're already beyond the optimal way to cook the roux (at the begining before adding liquid), what has worked best for me at this point is to smash the butter and flour together (about 1 TBSP each) until it becomes pasty then add some of the cooking liquid to it to disolve' the paste. Then ad the paste to the pot while on med-high heat and whisk vigorously until it comes together. It will not be perfect but a lot better than what you started with. And yes some of the fish and/or potato may break up a little bit, but who cares. I hope this helps!

excellent! I omitted the bacon and used 2 tbsp butter instead, also used red potatoes. Worked fine w/ 3/4 milk and 1/4 cream. At first the chowder was a bit thin, but then it magically thickened up by the time dinner was served!

Easy and quick to make, I was satisfied with this recipe.

No way is this a dish beyond compare, but it is a really nice, homey and easy dish to make. I left the bacon in with the rest of the stuff, and used veg. broth instead of water. Used half skim milk and half cream. I thought it could actually use *more* dill (this seems odd in lieu of other reviews, I guess), but my husband seemed very happy with the given amount.

Delish! We had drop in company (a guy), he, my husband and I loved it!!! Making it again today. Used veg. broth instead of water, 2% milk instead of whole and fresh parsley instead of dill, and good ole Idaho potatoes. Yummy!!! Go Broncos!!!!!!!

Hands down, one of the worst chowders I have ever made. Followed the recipe to a tee - know what I'm doing - was way to fishy and extremely bland.

Rating: 3
Tasty, quick, and easy. I didnt have whole milk so I used 1% and a bit of cream (although it ended up being so rich I could have easily just used the 1%). Next time I will use maybe half the dill (I used fresh) because it was very strong and overpowered the chowder a bit.

A wonderful quick cold weather dinner. I prepared it to the point of adding the salmon and then put it in the fridge. When my husband got home, I just re-heated to simmer, added the salmon, butter and dill and dinner was ready in 5 minutes.

Excellent. Yukon golds are great in this. Other potatoes fall apart and thicken the sauce. I prefer the yukon golds, with the delicate light milky broth.

Loved the quickness of making it. It was delicious and satisfying. Came out fine with dried dill. I also used leftover poached salmon from another recipe and used the broth from that instead of water.

This is fantastic! Not to mention totally quick and easy! I made it with wild sockeye salmon, no bacon, and half cream half ff milk. Delicious easy weeknight dinner. I can't think of a thing wrong with it.

we love this! I use lowfat milk to cut calories, and it tastes great. I usually add more salmon and veggies than instructed so the broth doesn't seem too watery. I sometimes add cornstarch to thicken at the end. If you don't heat too high, the milk should not curdle.

I just wanted to counter the nasty remarks made by other reviewers. If made properly, and without bacon, this dish is perfect. It is thick and creamy, flavorful, and satisfying. In the words of somebody who ate the soup, "It's delicious."

This is an excellent recipe - so rich and yet so simple to make. It is a dinner that the family will look forward to, and certainly could be served at an informal dinner party.

I wouldn't make this again. It's basically poached salmon in a milky, watery, greasy broth. The bacon gave it a decent overall flavor but it just wasn't very good. If you don't like poached salmon, you definitely won't like this. I would suggest trying one of the other chowder recipes on this site instead.

If there is any herb on the planet you don't care for (like dill),replace it with chopped curly-leaf parsley. Italian flat leaf has the same exact flavor but is a bitch to work with (like cilantro, hard to chop...sticks to everything) and is about 3 times stronger. This recipe is kind of boring to me. It is a basic Boston clam chowder with salmon and dill. No carrots? Use parsnips! OF COURSE the milk will curdle! Use half and half (light cream) or heavy cream OR use a little liason, ROUX comes to mind :) Pop a TBLS of flour into the bacon fat, stir it for a minute, then add liquid. Water? Scuse me? At LEAST add a veggie stock (rolleyes).

Thyme is good in chowders, although dill and salmon are a great combination. To avoid curdling, allow milk or cream to come to room temperature before using.

This recipe seemed a little bland, so we added spinach, mushrooms, garlic, rosemary and thyme and was AMAZING!

Delicious and easy to prepare. Milk will curdle if heated too hot. I added extra salt and pepper to taste. Made it for family and they loved it.

I made this tonight for the first time. It was so easy and delicious, my husband said he wants to have it again tomorrow night. I don't eat bacon, so I just sauteed the veggies in a little butter. I used reduced fat milk, since it was all I had, doubled the pepper, used fish stock instead of water, and used dried dill instead of fresh. It turned out great. We ate it with a big hunk of bread and it made a great weeknight dinner. Will definitely have it again.

This recipe was easy to make, and everyone loved it. I used basil because I don't like dill, and it turned out fine.

Easy to make, good weeknight dish. Good with a green salad and crusty bread. I would like the broth itself to be a bit thicker, so I will probably add cornstarch next time.

Used basil instead of dill and it worked well. I'd recommend putting in more than the 2 T. called for. I would also recommend salting the salmon for a half hour before using and then rinsing off.

This is an amazingly simple and wonderful chowder. I have made it twice now. Each time my husband swears it is the best chowder he has ever had!

My husband hates dill---anyone have any suggestions for a substuite in this recipe?

Rating: 4
Great tasting and easy to prepare. The consistancy was just right; the use of milk instead of cream keeps this from being too creamy for me. Make sure that the heat does not get too high to simmer to prevent separation.

I had the same problem as Erin. The chowder tasted fine but it looked curdled. Any suggestions?

Rating: 3
This was quick, simple, & delicious. The supermarket was sold out of fresh dill (for Easter), so I used dried, and I substituted half & half for milk, since that was what I had on hand. I also tossed in about 8 oz of bay scallops, since I had them on hand as well. Use a good quality bacon - it makes a difference in flavor.

I liked the flavor of this dish, and that it was not too thick. However, after I added the milk and it simmered for awhile, it began to look separated. Maybe I cooked it too long? I will definitely make this again.

If I could, I'd live on homemade soup and oatmeal cookies. This quick, easy recipe was hearty and pleasing to the 'buds. It's got a permanent place on the soup rotation roster at this house. If only I could find an oatmeal cookie recipe this delicious, quick and easy.

Delicious, not your typical overly thick chowder. My guests enjoyed it very much, too. Easy as anything, serve with salad and your ready! Definitely use the salt and pepper, though.

Really tasty and quick. The bacon and fresh dill absolutely make it. I only had 2% milk so I thickened it with a little cornstarch; other than that made it as is and wouldn't change it.

This is very nice--better than I expected. It's a quick, easy, nutritious weekday dish.
