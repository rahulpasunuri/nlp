This is always a winner at a party. Simple and looks fancy. I've never bothered tossing the apricots with juice, I just make sure I buy tender dried apricots. Very tasty!

I didn't use the OJ since the apricots were moist and plump. Mixed the goat cheese with some cream cheese and a bit of milk and used a pastry bag to pipe the cheese. These are delicious and were a huge hit at my party. Had to convince people to try them at first - but then people couldn't get enough. I also made some with small dried berries instead of pistachios because of nut allergies; rather sweet, but also delicious! Will definitely make these again.

Did a trial run of these last night and was very impressed. Don't bother soaking the apricots, just start with decent ones. I also tore the apricots in half along the natural seam, otherwise it was little too much. Mixed the goat cheese with some cream to soften, added a splash of triple sec and tossed in a ziplock. Pipped onto the apricots when ready and just chucked the nuts and some fresh pepper before serving. Looked, tasted just awesome.

MMMM! we substituted almonds for pistachios (bride's choice). Even people who don't really like goat cheese liked this dish!

Easy to make and my guests loved these. I had plump dried apricots and thus didn't soak them. Forgot to toast the pistachios. Mashed a bit of cream in with the goat cheese so it was easier to spread. They were the hit of my party.

Simple to prepare, yet they look amazing on a stylish tray and taste delicious. I found they were best served to a small crowd - when put out at a larger pot luck most people didn't know what they were and were wary of trying them.

These are fabulous! Use a very good goat cheese, such as Sainte Maure, and good quality pistachios and apricots, and you can skip the soaking in oj step.

In a word, nasty. Even after pitching the apricots, which were horrible with the goat cheese mixture, the pistachio cheese mixture sat untouched all night long. Do not...and I repeat...do not waste your time on this one.

These are excellent - sophisticated, interesting and easy. I mixed the pistachios with the goat cheese and the spreading was no big deal. Everyone loved them and the recipe yielded a ton.

These are the best, tastiest, easiest party dish ever! All of my friends have gotten the recipe from me and made them at their parties too!!! YUM!

I think this tasted wonderful esp. if you're looking for something different/original to serve as finger food. Looks very nice too. I served it "chip n dip" style but the goat cheese is quite thick so you need to actually spread it w/a knife onto the apricot and then your fingers get all sticky from the apricot...this was a bit obnoxious and yes, you only eat 2 or 3 of them b/c the goat cheese is so rich. I tried to thin out the taste/texture a bit w/cream cheese and milk but it's still rich and thick. 1/3 of this recipe is more than enough but I will definitely make it again.

I brought these to a summer party and they all went. I did find them to be a bit messy however. Since making them I have read a new review which recomments mixing the toppings together and then apply to apricot...that is what I'll do next time.

This is an unusual combination of flavors that I really like! They are also quite beautiful, but 150 is just too many. I was serving finger foods to a little over 60 people. Guests either loved 'em or hated 'em, but no one ate bunches of them. Even though I liked them, I couldn't eat more than 2 myself due to the richness of the goat cheese, and the sweetness of the apricots. I would make half the amount next time.

I've made this recipe several times, and I just love it. I deviate, though, by just tossing all the ingredients together to serve, which is extremely easy, and the dish is still attractive and tastes wonderful. I use whole turkish apricots and freshly squeezed orange juice. I've made it for several cocktail parties, and it always disappears.

Looked good, but obviously not popular as I ended up throwing the majority of of them away.

This recipe was a big hit, and very flexible. I thought the orange juice was a nice way to plump the apricots, and added a bit of tang. They are not too soggy if you drain them on paper towls.

Ditch the OJ marinade because who wants soggy apricots? Also use California dried apricots--the Turkish ones are just gross and belong in fruitcake.

Sounds weird but tastes wonderful. Turkish apricots, whole, worked fine. They were a big hit.

Like a previous reviewer, I let the cheese come to room temperature, then piped it out of its own cryopak. Easy! I used green chile pistachios, which added I nice bit of spice. A great combination of textures (chewy, soft, crunchy) and flavors (sweet, tangy, spicy).

Made these for our annual Christmas party, and they were the biggest hit! Didn't bother soaking the apricots in the OJ since the ones I got were pretty moist to start with, and I toasted all the nuts, not just half. Kept the goat cheese out at room temperaturee then piped through a pastry bag. SO easy and delicious!

Did a demo run this afternoon in preparation for my Bachelor Bob Season Finale Party on Wednesday. Very easy to make. I used salted pistachios and I am very pleased with the result. I am going to pair it with the Cherry and Creme Cheese Spread and have on hand a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc and Piesporter Michelsberg.

This recipe worked well for a light Hors D'oeurve! I used hole California Apricots instead and I loved the result. Not the biggest hit at the party of 200 but I would serve it again maybe to a smaller crowd of 10 to 20 people.

This recipe is fantastic!!! I've made it for two different parties recently and they fly off the table. I chop the nuts and mix them with the goat cheese and then put them in a zip lock to make it easier. It is still messy, but so worth the effort!

This was actually quite easy to prepare and your result will depend on the quality of your ingredients. A very simple and different appetizer that adds color.

My 15-year-old daughter made these for me for my Xmas party (which easily had 75 hungry guests). I brought these out late and they diappeared after about 5 minutes. Very luscious. We made them as the recipe stated, but used a mild domestic goat cheese, rather than a french chevre. The pistachios added a pretty touch.

I made this recipe for a friend's girls-only cocktail party and all of her guests were impressed. They didn't take long at all to assemble, just set up an assembly line. I marinated the apricots in peach schnapps and orange juice, and it tasted wonderful. However, go light on the goat cheese because too much will kill the other flavors you've got going on. I would definitely reccomend this recipe.

Too much work for the end result.

Yummy yummy! Easy to prepare, and easy to scale down for no. of guests. We mixed Southern Comfort with the OJ and kept the pistachios whole- they nest nicely in the soft cheese. Recommend Turkish apricots- tastier and not difficult to halve- just peel them apart along the natural "seam" of the fruit.

Love this recipe! Made it for a cocktail party, and everyone loved it, even my husband, who hates goat cheese! I took advice from another review, and added grand marnier to the oj, excellent! I am going to make this for an upcoming halloween party, if you use whole, pitted apricots, fill them with cheese, and roll the top in the pistachios, they look like little pumpkins!

I marinated the apricots in orange concentrate and a little triple sec. Used 4 pepper Rondele Cheese, piped it on with a pastry bag and placed whole pistachios on top. Very nice presentation, can be made in advance and quite different. Think blue cheese would be a great alternate for stuffing too.

Rating: 3
Easy to make and well liked by a group of very discerning guests. I added approx 1/2 C of Grand Marnier to give the apricots a little kick. I cut the recipe down by 1/2 for 10 people and had gobs of marinated apricots and chevre left over. Next time I will reduce it even more and figure 5/guest max.

Different flavors and great choice for a finger food to accompany an assortment of other appetizers. I don't suggest serving it as your only appetizer. I did 32 for a dinner party of 8 along with 2 other appetizers and had a few leftover. Considering that you are topping each apricot it wasn't that time consuming. The toasted pistachios really add flavor.

This hors d'ouevre went over very well--a few people asked me for the recipe. It did make a lot though. I had a party for 37 people, I bought two pounds but ended up using about 1 1/2 pounds and having about 30 left over. So you could cut the recipe a bit. Also I used about half the goat cheese, because I preferred putting a small dollop of cheese on it rather than a big one, so the cheese wasn't overpowering. I didn't mix in the nuts, because I didn't want lumpy cheese.

This is a great recipe!! I found that if I mixed the chopped pistachios in with the goat cheese, you could taste more of the nuts and it gave it a nice texture too.
