Great concept but bland by itself. I added to the purée fresh basil and then stirred in freshly ground parmigiano-reggiano. Top with cracked pepper, salt to taste, and fresh roasted red bell peppers.

As is, it's pretty bland. I ended up adding a lot more lemon juice, salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper and added extra roasted garlic and dijon. Not sure I'd make it again.

Added too much garlic by mistake, but could tell that beneath the strong garlic taste was a nice flavor. I would suggest increasing the amount of red pepper flakes.

I love the texture of a white bean puree. But based on the previous reviews, I realized I needed to add some flavor here. So I sauteed the white and pale green part of 2 leeks, simmered the broccoli in chicken broth before pureeing, and added a healthy dose of white pepper. I then served it atop well-seasoned grilled polenta rounds. Flavors were still subtle, but delicious. I enjoyed this very much.

This was very bland. I agree with the cook who said it was missing something -- although I probably wouldn't bother making it again to figure out what that missing ingredient is.

Although easy to prepare and full of healthy ingredients, I found this to be pretty tasteless. I even used more garlic than was suggested. I will try to make it again because I like the key ingredients and want a healthy snack, though this time I'll add even more garlic, hot pepper flakes, and maybe something else to jazz it up . . . mustard? Maggi? Time to experiment.
