A very unusual salad, great for those who are adventuresome. The coriander gives it a spicy taste, as do the radishes. Very easy and beautiful to make at Christmas because of the red radishes. Be sure to put enough dressing on the endive leaves, since endives can be a bit bitter alone.

Took this on a ski weekend, was an interesting variation on a salad accompaniment for coq au vin. I lkied it, as did my husband, but the more conservative folks seemed to pick at it. Felt the bacon drippings left the dressing greasy.
