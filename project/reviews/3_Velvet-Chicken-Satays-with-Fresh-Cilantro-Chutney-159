Chutney was okay, I wasn't a huge fan of the texture of it but the flavor was nice. Chicken was nothing special but like the cook below, I didn't marinate mine for very long either. Very easy and quick though.

The chutney was wonderful with fresh from the garden mint and cilantro. The chicken was nothing special, but I only had 1+ hours of marinating. It was all rather easy.

I am not sure why this recipe has not worked out for so many, we LOVED it. I marinated the chicken overnight not for a couple hours. We broiled it and it browned nicely. The chutney was great - I added a touch extra red pepper & curry powder and used champagne vinegar. I tossed the chicken with the chutney and I served it cold, too.

I made this for a holiday buffet cocktail party. I grilled the chicken and it was okay...nothing special The chutney was gross. I couldn't even serve it. I went out and bought a ready-made Thai peanut dipping sauce instead.

This chicken definitely improves with cooking on the grill. I sprayed it with a bit of tamari and popped it on the grill to brown it up after coming out of the oven. Next time I'll skip the oven altogether. Served with a spicy thai peanut sauce and it got rave reviews! Already have had requests to make it again for next outdoor party.

I made this for a cocktail party and the marinade was very subtle but flavourful. We grilled these on the barbeque which added a nice smokiness. This was great for my guests who don't like strong flavours. I served this with a peanut sauce that got rave reviews. I will definately have to make more than two skewers per person if I make them for a party again!

I really enjoyed the marinade, and I have a few ideas on how to tweak it. I loved the chicken as well. Ill defenitly be making those two again and again! I had some problems with the chutney. Perhaps its beyond my skill level, but it came out a mushy, hot mess, lol. Perhaps Ill try again.

Actually if we were ranking just the chutney alone, we'd give it a 3 for sure! The Chutney definitely makes the dish- it's "fresh and light" as my husband said. I also liked that I was able to use the fresh mint from our garden for this one. I think it will make a very interesting zippy addition to any dippable bite -shrimp, pork, you name it. Perfect for summer! Nothing special about the chicken except that the velveting makes it nice and tender.

The satay recipe was pretty pedestrian, but the chutney was a winner! If you like this kind of asian spicy sauce, this is a great basic recipe you can modify for yourself & use on anything.

I liked the chutney better than the chicken. I had left over and tried it on shrimp (very good) and mixed with pineapple, tomatos and hearts of palm (really good). My chicken didn't brown in the over, and I had to finish it on a grill.

The satay chicken turned out well and I minimized the water in the sauce, and liked the results. I think the mint sauce was a bit too sweet however.

This dish was excellent. An orgasmic delight to the senses! The chutney was very spicey due to a few too many red chilies, and I didn't have curry so I used tarragon leaves instead. And yes, keep the tablespoons of water down to 4 or less, not 5. Mine was just a little waterery with 4 tblspoons. The marinade for the chicken was absolutely excellent too and could stand on it's own. A keeper!!!

Okay... I'll start with the sauce: very flavorful, but I agree about reducing the amount of water to have a thicker consistancy. It's always better to add than to do the opposite. I would call this more a dipping sauce instead of a chutney. As for the chicken, well it was unbelievably moist and very tasty too. I added some fresh ginger to the marinade, used lemon juice instead of white wine and let it marinade for an hour only (it was a weeknight...) and it came out perfect. I also served it with some curried roasted potatoes and butternut squash. My boyfriend REALLY like it, so I'll make it for sure!

I didn't care for the "chutney". But, the satays worked well with another recipe. Try gilling the satays and serving with fusilli lunghi and peanut sauce with julienned cucumbers on the side. It makes a delicious salad.

The marinade was excellent; good garlic and subtle spices. Worked well on the grill. The "chutney", however, was somewhat disappointing. Nice combination of cilantro and mint, but hardley the consistency of what a chutney should be. Way too watery

The chicken seemed bland without the dipping sauce. I would have to experiment to see if there was a different marinade that would accompany the sauce. The sauce was the best part of the recipe.
