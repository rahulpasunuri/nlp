Made this last night. Was a nice change from traditional meatloaf. Instead of dividing out into 7 mini loaves, I just put it all in one and since I was not making the whole weeks worth of food from Shape magazine, I just sauteed enough onion, garlic, broccoli and red bell pepper for this recipe. The kids (3 & 5) found the glaze too spicy, so I just gave them portions with the glaze cut off and they ate it up, veggies and all. My wife and I both enjoyed the spicy glaze. I made this with garlic-herb mashed potatoes also from this site which were fantastic!

This is a GREAT meatloaf recipe. The glaze is ABSOLUTELY delicious and adds a lot of flavor to the already flavorful meatloaf. Modifications: - Used regular whole milk instead of almond milk - Used 2 slices of white bread (after making it, I felt even 4 slices would have been okay - it is very meat-heavy otherwise) - Used onions (2 medium) and garlic (3 cloves) sauteed in olive oil instead of onion-garlic mix - Used sauteed red bell pepper (sauteed with onions and garlic) instead of broccoli-pepper mix - Skipped the dry mustard - Added peas to the meatloaf mix

The flavor of these loaves was so good! A little different from the standard meat loaf which is a nice change. Because I was not making the full 5 meals, I just made enough onion/garlic/broccoli/red pepper mix that i needed and sauted it all together.

I found this pretty time-consuming, what with making the onion and garlic mix and the broccoli and red bell pepper mix (though it was convenient to have the leftover mix for other recipes, even though I'm not doing the companion recipes from Self), and the result wasn't good enough to be worth the work for me. My husband likes these, the kids don't, and I think they're nothing special.

These were really good for such a simple recipe. I followed recipe pretty closely except for adding some additional vegetables: diced red pepper, carrots and corn. Nice and spicy. I'll definitely be making often.

Everyone liked this - kids and husband - very tasty! I skipped the glaze and it was still very moist and flavorful. Instead of chili powder, I used sriracha because I was looking for a different heat & flavor.
