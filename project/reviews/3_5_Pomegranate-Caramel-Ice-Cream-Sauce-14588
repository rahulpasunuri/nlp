I made this using both bottled , mixed juice pomegranate juice and one fresh pomegranate. I used Eugene's tip to do the caramel making first, with the water and sugar. I then added cornstarch to some slightly warmed pomegranate/blueberry/grape juice. I added that mixture and the bottled juice to the caramel. It seizes up, but then gets smooth again as it heats. I then used Santa Cruz' s tip for using a plastic bag to pop the seeds, and then I added that strained juice to the pan and boiled it all down by half. It turned out a gorgeous, ruby-red sauce, sweet and tart. I served it on top of a homemade pumpkin-eggnog ice cream with brown-sugar bits and crumbled ginger cookies. It was an enormous hit!

This was my first experience cooking with pomegranites. It definitely takes a lot of time, but it's fun! Possibly therapeutic. I certainly have a better appreciation for the high cost of pomegranite juice... Worth the effort.

The previous reviewer nailed the taste bud response to this sauce on the head! The sauce is very different when tasted on ice cream (I think better) vs when tasted alone. I enjoyed the sauce but I don't recommend making the caramel in this fashion... its easier when the sugar and water are combined to dissolve and turn golden, then add the juice combined with your thickener (btw cornstarch in the same amount worked fine). The texture of this sauce is rather bizare (like colored vaseline), but makes sense considering the use of a thickening agent. A unique ice cream experience... with a host of possible variations when one changes the juice (to wine, port, tea or coffee?)... I sense an experiment in the making!

I'd rate this higher except that pomegranates are not for everyone, so I don't want to foist off my personal preferences! This dish is fun to make, and in fact my first experience with making caramel. It's a gentle introduction after all of the warnings I've read! One note: this absolutely requires ice cream (or perhaps other cream foods) to bring it out. It tastes sort of spicy and odd by itself, with no particularly desirable flavor of either caramel or pomegranates. But once placed on top of vanilla ice cream, there's the wonderful flavor of both caramel and pomegranates. The caramel sauce comes out a beautiful ruby pomegranate color, and the embedded seeds are shown to their best advantage. Another note: I used two HUGE and very perfectly ripe pomegranates to make this the first time, and needed to use five smaller pomegranates to get the required 2/3 cup of juice the second time; get more pomegranates than you think you'll need if they're small. I put the seeds into a ziplock bag and squished them with my hands, and then popped the seeds: time consuming but sort of fun, like popping bubble wrap. The second time I tried running the popped seeds through a food mill to extract more juice, and that worked fairly well. Compared to seeding and juice extraction the actual cooking bit is not very time consuming.
