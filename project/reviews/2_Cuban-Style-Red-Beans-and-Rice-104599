Doesn't work! The problems with this recipe can be summed easily: any bean recipe that doesn't call for salt--especially one where you are cooking dry beans--has a problem! The final result was bland and flavorless. In addition to not calling for salt, it doesn't call for pepper either. I kept adding salt, cumin, and oregano until I got something approaching flavor, but adding seasoning at the end doesn't work as well as adding it as you're cooking. There are much better beans and rice recipes out there. Don't waste your time on this one.

The previous reviewer's sofrito sounds like a wonderful addition-- but then again, adding it would mean you wouldn't be making this recipe. Which, by the way, is not a bad thing--this was terrible. I agree with the reviewer who said to serve plain white rice instead. That's exactly how much flavor this recipe had, with a ton more work. And as an aside, while I do immensely enjoy and utilize other people's suggestions, please don't give this recipe three forks if you're forced to add something as drastic as a sofrito to make it edible. It's misleading. Simply give the recipe as written one fork, then go on to tell us about all the wonderful changes you made, and why they were necessary.

this recipe just needs to be modified. Yes - do a sofrito, with onions, bell peppers, a jalepeno pepper, and a chopped carrot. Also, cook the ebans in veg broth instead of using the vegetable chunks for flavoring. I add a cinnamon stick and orange zest to the beans, and double the cumin. Top the beans and rice with the sofrito, avacado chunks, and serve with a tomato salsa. Yum.

I won't be making this recipe again! It was disappointing and lacked flavor of any kind.

To those who have reviewed this dish to say it is bland, the problem is that it does not call for the use of a "sofrito." A sofrito is a saute of red/green peppers, onions, garlic, olive oil, and my Cuban family always adds cumin, oregano, salt and black pepper. A sofrito is a must for any bean dish that calls itself Cuban-style and it is what adds the perfect seasoning to any Cuban-style dish.

I made this and thought it was good - but I did change a few things. First, I sauteed the onion bell pepper and garlic together and then threw in the rice with the spices (increased those as well) and sauteed everything togehter for just a minute or two and then threw it all in my trusty rice cooker (makes cooking rice soooo much easier!) Towards the end of cooking time I added a can of kidney beans and lots of cilantro. It went great with the shrimp and bell pepper stew. Yum! But you do need to spice it up a bit on your own by increasing spices - also going to all the trouble of cooking the beans seems like too much work for a dish like this.

This is a super easy recipe that takes no time at all to make. I used canned kidney beans to save time, and added beef bouillon to the rice as it was cooking. This recipe is nothing exciting, but it's a good basic bowl of red beans and rice - and low fat, as well. It is a bit bland, but with a few dashes of Tabasco, it wakes up. I will make it again for a quick mid-week supper.

I too served this dish with the Spicy Shrimp and Bell Pepper Stew from the same issue-- the shrimp was fabulous, but this rice just didn't cut it. It was a lot of work to make the two dishes together, and in the end, I didn't think this rice warranted all the effort. We thought it was just too bland. If you're planning on making the shrimp, I suggest saving yourself the trouble and serving a plain white rice instead.

Perfect rice for Spicy Shrimp & Bell Pepper Stew with Cumin & Oregano. I used canned kidney beans and didn't rinse the rice.

This dish is very bland. I added spicy sausage to the sauteed onions and bell peper, but even that didn't do it. Add lots of spices to this one!!!
