I did not appreciate the sweet flavor in the sauce. I'm thinking it was the red pepper. I will replace it with a hot pepper., the recipe does need the extra kick. Not wanting to provoke cancer, I tend to avoid canned products (tomatoes, beans...) mine were about about ten normal size fresh, skinned and seeded tomatoes. The beans took longer than 15 minutes to cook even though I soaked them the night before. As a result, the recipe was better the next day. Eggplant is great, don't know why people omitted it. Vegetarian taco, is a great idea, but it needs a little work.

This was pretty good, but nothing fantastic. I felt like it was missing something, so I added lime juice, a jalapeno, and some coriander. We served it in taco shells with grilled shrimp on top. The shrimp were a great addition,which I would highly recommend. All of the separate parts of this dish took less time to cook than the recipe indicated, so I think that this can actually be a pretty quick recipe.

Our new years resolution was to incorporate one vegitarian meal a week. This has made an exelent addition to our vegetarian recipies. Eggplant is not in season, so I did omit that ingredient. My husband thought the dish would be a lot hardier with the eggplant. Even he was surprised though at how much he liked this recipe. I took another reviewers advise and served this over rice with cheese and sour cream. Excellent. Will make again, with eggplant next time.

I omitted the eggplant but loved this dish! Also, the parsley was swapped out for obviously superior cilantro. Fabulous with crispy shells or with warm whole wheat tortillas, you certainly won't miss the meat.

Very good - you don't miss the "meat". I did make some adjustments. I left out the plum tomatoes because the ones at the market did not look good. I also used black beans instead of the kidney & chickpeas.

Very yummy! I didn't add the parsley. TJ's was all out of cilantro but that's probably what I would have used because cilantro would definitely compliment this spicy dish! I also used black beans instead of the kidney beans -- delicious. I upped the amount of veggies, it wasn't soggy at all. It's kind of like a mexican ratatouille. I topped it with organic pepper jack cheese and rapped it up in whole wheat hand made tortillas from Trader Joe's. Delicious - healthy - inexpensive!!

Poker Guys say save time and put all items in a bowl, crumble the shells over items, Pour Picante sauce over the top and you have Taco salad sans the beef. Not a fave this time.

I love tacos but always feel so fat afterwards. These were so light and refreshing! America's Most Wanted Recipes: http://instant-download-now.com/go/recipesecrets

Excellent vegetarian dish. Can also be served as a thick dip with corn or pita chips. Easy to double or triple recipe. The whole recipe can be made in a large saute pan instead of casserole. Mine was not at all runny. If it is too watery, continue to cook with the cover off until the extra liquid steams out.

This recipe is one of our all-time favorites. We've never made it with the eggplant, but I'm sure that would make it taste even better. This is so filling and tasty, we never miss the meat. We've used soft corn tortillas instead of hard, and we also frequently eat the filling alone over rice. So good! And a good one to share with vegetarian friends (and, with some easy modifications, vegans too). Try this one!

Loved it! My family and I are trying to incorporate more vegetarian dishes into our diets. We all agreed that this taco recipe is MUCH tastier than any meat or chicken taco that we've tried. It's delicious as a leftover, too. The only downside is that it's pretty runny. I drained the can of tomatoes - still runny. I served it with a slotted spoon, which worked out alright. I'd love to hear ideas about how to thicken it up a bit.

I made this and it's delish. However, instead of tacos(don't like), I served it over rice and sprinkled the shredded lettuce and onion over it with the sourcream on the side. Ialso made some guacamole as a side. I had it for lunch the next day and added some sausages; yum
