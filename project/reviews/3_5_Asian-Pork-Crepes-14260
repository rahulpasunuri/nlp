very time consuming, but they turned out well.

I made these small, finger-food-sized, and thought they were good when I tasted them. However, they were barely touched at the cocktail party I served them at. I probably wouldn't make again for that reason, but I thought they were tasty and had good presentation.

Another positive review. Great taste, although I wish my crepes were a wee-bit heavier.

I did modify this recipe to become a main dish and ended up having to make my own plum and hoisin sauce as it was not available at the markets here. A truly outstanding dish, very easy to make.

I made this with other dishes for a cocktail party for 50 guests. Easy to make crepes the day before and will make the dish again...one change to suggest...it is easier to make small crepes rather than a large one to cut.I made the crepes pn a griddle rather than a crepe pan and plan to use the crepe recipe for other fillings.

EXCELLENT. A bit of work, but worth it. I've made several times

This was absolutely delicious. I actually roasted the pork in the hoisin/honey sauce which enhanced the flavor. Since it's many steps for an appetizer, I'm thinking of using it as a main dish - just don't cut up crepes.

This is a finnicky recipe with many steps but well worth it. Many wonderful flavours in a moist crepe. I have made this twice and both times were great.
