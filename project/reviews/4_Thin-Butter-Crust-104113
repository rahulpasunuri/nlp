Love this pie crust recipe. It has been my go-to crust recipe for a few years now. I sometimes use two knives to start cutting up the butter into the flour, but then I use my fingers. I really think using one's fingers is key to this recipe. I do recommend making more than the recipe calls for (like a half recipe more) if you are using a deep dish pie pan.

This was an excellent, easy crust. I did not have pastry flour on hand, so I used white whole wheat flour instead. I had some trouble cutting the butter (had been storing it in the freezer), so I used a cheese grater to reduce it to small pieces. Rolling the crust between two pieces of waxed paper worked perfectly - it came together much more quickly and easily than I had imagined it would. Yay!

I love this crust and have used it time and time again over the past 7 years. My nieces have been raised to make it on their own it's so simple. I use it any time a pie recipe calls for a basic crust. It gets rave reviews from family and friends every time it's served.

Wow you guys, really??!! I'm not a pie crust novice and I found it very difficult to work with this dough. I made three crusts with this and each time was a challenge. Clearly it's something I'm doing, but I still am done with this particular recipe.

this was great - i should have made a bit more, it was difficult to cover the entire pie, but VERY easy to make. Great for someone new to baking!

This is a great crust. I used my food processor with a blade to get it going and then dumped it out after I had added the water. It was SOOOO easy to knead. My mistake was adding too much water. I hadn't realized how easy it would be to knead and in the past, I've had trouble getting crusts to come together. It chilled for 30 min in the fridge and rolled out plenty of dough for a 9" double crust pie. It didn't brown very well but that was totally my fault due to adding too much water. This is a keeper.

One of the best pie crusts I've ever had. I'm going to use it for all my pies from now on. Made it a few times for apple pie, and I'm going to try with rhubarb in a few days. Very yummy :)

This is my favorite all-butter crust, and I've made several. Not too short and not too dry. It rolled out nicely on my first attempt.

Ideal crust for any dish. Comes out perfect in minutes with food processor.

I make this crust now all the time. It seems to turn out a little uncooked on the bottom sometimes, but this last time I added a teaspoon of vinegar to the crust and it turned out perfect and flaky.

This tasted great and was so easy to make and roll out. This will be my pie crust for all fruit pies from now on.

After reading the previous reviews - I had to try it. I was so exicted when one of the guests said "This crust is so flaky!" It truly was a hit. Great recipe!

This was first attempt at making a pie crust. I was amazed at how easy it was to make. I didn't have to do any patchwork and it tasted great.

I had just about given up on pie-making (at least until I shell out the money for a food processor) and then I tried this pastry recipe. Simple to make and the result was flawless. I too used all-purpose flour, but I bet it would be even better with pastry flour.

This was simple to make and came out very well for the apple pie I made. Guests commented on how well the crust stayed together. I used regular flour because I couldn't find pastry flour.

I gave up pie-making a long time ago as I was absolutely hopeless at making and handling the pastry! Therefore, I was totally shocked with the results I got from this recipe - no patching, no tearing, no swearing - just perfect flaky pastry. Try it - you will love the results!

I am a first-time pie maker who tends to screw up everything I bake and this pie crust came out perfectly! It was light and flakey and it held together beautifully, even when it was cut. I made the crust with "all purpose" flour which didn't seem to make a difference. The only problem I found was that the dough was too hard to work with fresh from the fridge -- after being in there for several hours. I had to let it sit 15 minutes before I could roll it out properly.

Oh my gosh!!!! I have finally found the recipe! This is a wonderful recipe and I will make it again. I can't believe how well it turned out! I have a feeling that me and my family are going to start looking like the Clumps after a few more pies!

This was my first flaky pie crust (before now, only pat-in-pan butter/shortbread crust), and it turned out wonderfully! Lovely texture, very simple to make and pure tastes - no shortening, yay!
