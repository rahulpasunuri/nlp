We thought the brine was much too strong. The salty favor dominated everything. Will not bother to make this one again.

Simple and delicious! I agree that the brine soak is essential - it really brought out the flavor of the shrimp. I followed the recipe exactly, and would not change a thing. Really great.

This is a fantastic recipe. My husband made this for me on our first wedding anniversary back in 1996. We decided to make it together this year for our 12th anniversary but could not find the recipe after our recent move. I am so thrilled and relieved that we can make it now. The technique with the ice water and the sea salt has greatly enhanced many recipes that we have made over the years.

This is a great recipe. I made a few changes to fit my taste. I used 4 cloves of garlic and a tablespoon of red-pepper flacks. It was nice and spicy. Served with baby spinach sauteed in oil and garlic.

This is a great recipe. I also turned up the garlic and red pepper flakes and also served over pasta and spinach but I added the fresh baby spinach right before tossing so it was just wilted and topped with Parm Reggiano, Italian parsley and a little drizzle of olive oil. Oh my God!

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! As suggested below, I upped the garlic and red pepper flakes and added about 1 tablespoon of butter. I would absolutely make this again! It's fantastic!

I made this over the weekend and thought it was great. I did use equal amounts of olive oil and butter and I added a little Fruits de Mer Gold (see GatewayGourmet.com)and served it over spinach and pasta as one other reviewer suggested. I highly recommend all of the products at Gateway Gourmet. This dish will become one of my regulars and is perfect for dinner parties too.

Hubby recommended 2.5 forks, but of course not possible. Quikc and tasty but nothing too fabulous. If shrimp are on sale I'd make again, cutting down on white wine which dominated taste. I also served with spinach which was delicious with the sauce. Perfect for week night evening as it was on the table in 30 minutes and we had to peel the shrimp.

I used tiger shrimp (one step up from jumbo), upped the garlic, substituted vermouth for white wine and served over braised escarole. Instead of peppers I added crushed red pepper flakes at the same time I added the vermouth, turned up the heat and let the whole thing come to a lively simmer for another minute. The flavors came together in grand fashion. Great dish. If I could train myself to make a dish more than once I would definitely add this to the repetoire.

Fabulous! Up the garlic a bit, use extra olive oil, and pour it over angel hair pasta when serving. Don't skip the salt-water soak for the shrimp- it really adds flavor. I sautee fresh spinach in a separate pan with olive oil, garlic, and salt. Arrange spinach over pasta, top with shrimp, drizzle with oil and garlic from pan. Butter would be nice too, but my health-freak husband won't allow it. Oh, well, still delish.

Scrumptuous! I also added more garlic, red pepper flakes and wine. Did use a few Tblsps. of butter with the olive oil, then a bit of dried parsley in with the mix just at the end. Served over thin spaghetti and squeezed fresh lemon over top just before serving. Also good with sprinkling of parmesan. Do try! KIMBER

This is an excellent recipe. I serve it over Parmesan Polenta. Wonderful!

A great classic. I add the wine earlier for 2 reasons; it needs longer to cook off the alcohol and you risk overdoing the shrimp if you don't. The first time I made this the "30 seconds of cooking to evaporate alcohol" caused the dipping sauce to be too wine flavored (I used chardonnay). OK, I'll try it one more time with a lighter wine, say a sauvignon blanc.

I made a few changes in the recipe because it sounded a little too bland for me. I mixed this recipe with the SEARED SHRIMP WITH WARM NEW POTATO SALAD. I did the marinate and then I sprikle Goya Abodo Seasoning all over the shrimp. Then in the skillet I sauteed 1/3 cup of chopped shallots and 2 Tbls of Rosemary . I also used extra garlic - 2 extra cloves in the skillet and added all the marinated juice. That combo is very flavorful!

Very good recipe for scampi. Make sure the parsley you use is the Italian kind -- it's delicious and adds a nice flavor to the dish. We served it over garlic/water spaghetti. It was a great combo! Will make again!

We loved this recipe. I used one pound of our wonderful local shrimp, four gloves of garlic, a generous amount of red pepper and added a small amount of freshly grated parmesan cheese at the end. Delicious!

Delicious! I too used 5 cloves of garlic and 1/2 stick of butter but I also used 1lb of shrimp instead of the 1/2lb. suggested. There was plenty of sauce for 4 of us. Before serving I gave each plate a squeeze of fresh lemon. Great recipe!

Wow!! Boosted the garlic (per suggestion from previous rater) and also the red pepper flakes; served with a crusty black olive bread so none of the sauce was wasted. Having it again tonight!!

i'm not much ofa shrimp eater, but when i tried this recipe, it blew me away. it's a popular dish with all my friends.

Boost the garlic to 5 cloves. Make a garlic and oil spaghetti, 8 oz dry spaghetti is about enough for this recipe. A steamed green vegetable for contrast. Spaghetti onto plate, arrange shrimp on top of spaghetti, sprinkle parsley over shrimp/pasta, finish with a sqeeze of lemon for a final touch. Mixed green salad and bread. Nummy.

I had guests come over on Good Friday and made this dish as an appetizer. It was a huge success. I took the advice of some of the others that rated this recipe and added one additional clove of garlic as well as lemon at the end.

Rather than adding peppers, delete. Increase garlic to three cloves, add 2 tbs of butter. Broil rather than sautee and when served, spritz with a scant flavoring of lemon. This recipe is hearty, flavorful, and carries the richness of butter without being overwhelming.

I have been looking for a scampi recipe that closely matches one that I typically order in restaurants. This seems to be the one! It seems that butter is a key ingredient in most restaurant recipies yet I prefer to not use it. I double up the recipie so I can enjoy lots of shrimp and I typically add extra garlic!

Very good- I used this for a main dish, with fresh asparagus, homemade sourdough bread, and a salad of mixed baby greens. I added a little butter (1/3 stick) and followed Flora's advice of sprinkling with paprika. Very goog!

I usually use more shrimp than half a pound and use half a stick of butter..& sprinkle with paprika and juice of half lemon...Flora
