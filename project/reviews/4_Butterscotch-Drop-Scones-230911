The bottom of mine turned out a little burned. It was still a wonderful scone and I am going to recreate them today. Everyone gobbled them up.

Love this recipe! It has become my go-to scones recipe and I've gotten rave reviews. I've made the original butterscotch and also cranberry-walnut and they are both amazing, but the butterscotch is everyone's favorite. Will be giving these out in cute tins for the holidays with some homemade jam.

This recipe was so good, excellent. Easy to make - I baked my on a baking stone and had no problems with the butterscotch chips burning and 20 min. was perfect timing. They smell wonderful

Seriously the best scone I have EVER HAD. My family went nuts for these - it's not our go-to recipe, but the butterscotch chips are the best so far (we've tried dried cherries and almonds and others too.) Follow this to the letter and it will not disappoint. Only thing different I recommend is to add an egg wash + raw sugar dusting to the top. The texture is EXACTLY what a scone should be. And it's easy peasy too - a perfect recipe! FLAVOR - A TEXTURE - A+ EASY TO MAKE - A- INEXPENSIVENESS - A+ OVERALL - A

Awesome and easy to make. The butterscotch was a nice flavor mixed in with the scones. Brought them to my office where they were gobbled up fast.

These are the GREATEST scones! The butterscotch is an unexpected treat. I have requests at least 2-3 times per month for these from my office. There is NEVER a disappointed taster. DO NOT change a thing in this recipe. It is amazing like it is. I cannot stand how bakers alter the recpies, add this, substitute that.....and then give it a rating. Make another scone and submit it. Its really not fair to rate and review an altered recipe.

These are the biggest hit. I urge you to try the recipe as is and not make all these changes. How are you expected to rate and review any recipe when you don't follow it??? The only thing I do add to it is the topping. I take 1 egg and 1 tablespoon milk and whisk together as an egg wash and lightly wash the top of the scones before you cut into wedges (you will have a ton of egg wash left over, but use it for other baking). Then take some raw sugar and sprinkle on top, then cut and bake. It adds an extra little crunch and a bit of sweetness. Add it to any sweet scone!!!!! Its really good :)

I made these this weekend for my husband and a friend during a Movie Night. I also made frozen pizza. The scones were inhaled! The pizza got cold as the boys ate these amazingly delicious little biscuits. One thing I added was a brush of melted butter on the top of each scone as they came out of the oven. This will be in my party and shower repertoire!

Rating: 3
Very tasty, but I thought they were more akin to biscuits than scones. I used lowfat buttermilk and the dough was very moist. I will cut the sugar down to 1/4 C next time.

Loved them! I may add a little less salt next time, 1/2 tsp instead of 3/4. They were tender and flaky, as they should be. Will add to my repertoire.

Great easy recipe. Made for a brunch and they were a hit! Cooked for 18 min, 3 min less than recipe, scones were done and butterscotch chips didn't burn. Served with homemade honey butter.

I also replaced the cream with nonfat vanilla yogurt to cut down on saturated fat in the recipe. These turned out lovely. I did form them into hockey sized pucks and they turned out great. I might cut down the salt a little bit. I thought you could taste a lot of saltiness as an after taste.

good recipe. no need for cream. I substituted lowfat buttermilk, choc. chips and added almond extract. was wonderful.

Used non-fat plain yogurt for cream, added orange zest and replaced butterscotch chips with chocolate chips. Excellent...light, good crumb, moist, tender. Definitely a repeater.

Fantastic recipe....replace butterscotch with dried blueberries and grated lemon rind (about 1/2 lemon) Just like cake for breakfast!

I made these yesterday substituting the butterscotch chips (can't find them in Amsterdam)with unsweetened coconut and they were delicous and just the right sweetness.

Made these for St. Patrick's Day and they were a huge hit. Several people asked for the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.

I made this recipe for a mother & daughter tea party. The scones were gone. Everyone enjoyed because of the slight sweetness to the scone. I added about 1/4 cup more butterscotch chips and I cooked the scones at a lower temperature. The scones did not burn as much at about 350. Thanks for an easy and delicious scone recipe.

I love the taste of these. I have made them many times. My only complaint is that the chips that touch the pan tend to burn. I have tried different things but they still seem to burn.

These scones get rave reviews every time I make them! I don't change anything about the recipe but have found that while it is possible to substitute ingredients, as the intro suggests, the results aren't quite as tasty.

Super easy tasty recipe. I made this tonight with organic whole wheat flour. As suggested by previous reviewers, I reduced brown sugar to 1/4 cup. Instead of using half and half I used a carton of vanilla yogurt which is a trick I learned from another scone recipe. I scooped the dough out with a 1/4 cup although I made no effort to level etc. The scones looked lovely and have a great texture, not cake or muffin like at all. It did only yield 10 scones for me. They were a big hit with my toddler, so I believe I will try again with dried fruit for a more healthful version.

I've never received so many compliments! These were absolutely delicious! Next time I'll try using regular milk instead of cream to lower the fat content, but other than that, this recipe doesn't need any tweaks at all.

I really enjoy this scones. They seem to be moister than some I've tried. I think you could reduce the sugar a bit as another person suggested, as they are pretty sweet. I used fat free half and half instead of cream and only needed 2 extra teaspoons to get the right consistency. I also sprinkled a little cinnamon on top before baking, but might mix some in next time. The scones took the full 20 minutes to bake...may depend on whether you drop the full 1/4 cup per scone onto the baking sheet (which I did, and maybe a little extra)? They came out a bit crunchy on the edges but I like that. At any rate, these were pretty easy to make (no kneading!) and faster than some recipes I've experienced...give them a try!

Outstanding. I added a whole bag of butterscotch chips, and they were very sweet, but delicious. I also used 2% milk instead of whipping cream. Super simple to make. Great consistency. I formed them into crescent shapes, and the recipe made about 14 or so. Must try with different add-ins. I did not have to use extra milk. Baked only about 12 minutes though!!

Rating: 3
this was good, but the half cup of cream is not nearly enough. i didn't have cream so i used whole milk and wound up needing about a cup of milk, which is about on par with other scone recipes. maybe the dry winter air had something to do with how much liquid i needed. also, this baked in my oven a lot faster than the recipe suggests, so check it carefully! very good!

I love scones and these are delicious, albeit on the sweet side with the butterscotch! I like the drop factor ... very easy to mix up and bake and they come out flaky. I baked on a baking stone and the turned out great.

I made these for an office potluck. One co-worker announced that she didn't like scones or butterscotch...and then proceeded to eat 3 of them. They are delicious and easy.

This scone recipe is a staple at my house. The scones are delicious and not too heavy. I don't really like scones that much, but I love this recipe. It is easy and the dough stores well in the fridge so you can bake a few at a time when you want them.

The brown sugar makes the difference in these perfect scones. I opted for dry berries instead of the butterscotch chips. Delicious!

I have been looking for a good, sweet scone recipe for a while. Too often the scone recipes I find make really light and cakey scones - which are more like muffins, really. Instead, I was looking for a somewhat dense, buttery and sweet scone that could be adapted to include many different ingredients. I think I found that in this recipe. Whip up a batch this weekend and see for yourself :)

Rating: 3
Delicious and easy. The first batch, I made the scoops too small and they ended up more like cookies, but I have a great new cookie recipe! 2nd batch, made them bigger but too full to try. I chilled dough between batches. Will try batter again with different mix ins.

I love this recipe and make it often for brunch. This weekend I didn't have any butterscotch but wanted these scones so I made my own butterscotch with brown sugar, molasses, butter and vinegar. It turned out so much better than the store bought variety! An extra bonus is my son loves the new candy snack!

Rating: 3
Delicious and simple to make! I was a houseguest this weekend and made them for the hosts and other guests and they all loved them. These are moist, unlike store-bought ones that you choke on b/c they are so dry! I do think some cinnamon added to the recipe would give it more flavor.

Rating: 3
I used this recipe as a basis for orange scones, putting some zest in the batter along with a tsp of orange extract, and drizzling with an orange glaze made of orange zest, confectioner's sugar, and orange juice-- add the zest to taste, and the juice til you get the right consistency-- 1/2 orange should do it. They were really good, the base recipe is delicious and produces nice consistency scone-- not too dry nor too puffy/moist.

Made exactly as the recipe said and enjoyed them very much. Next time I'll try dried cranberries instead of butterscotch chips.

I thought these were tasty - nice delicate crumb, a bit of a crunch outside and moist inside. But the next time I make them I'll cut the sugar back to 1/4 cup. I have quite a sweet tooth, but these scones tasted like dessert.

I made these for a brunch and everyone loved them. I added about 4oz more butterscotch morsels, cooked them about the same time and they turned out perfectly!

I made these as part of a brunch for my mother-in-law's birthday. Everyone loved them. It took people a second to figure out the taste, and then they said, "Mmmmm, butterscotch!" Our niece, who won't eat anything but meat and chocolate, actually ate two of these. Needless to say, there were no leftovers!

Really, really good! Unlike another cook, I found they took longer than what was specified. Could be my oven though. Anyway, definate repeater!

I hate to give a low fork rating to a recipe just because it needed a little tweaking, just because I tend to pick recipes on this site based on how they rate and I wouldn't want anyone not to make these. My only problem was that the cooking time was about twice as long as it should have been. Maybe something is wrong with my oven, who knows--but I hopped into the shower while the scones were baking and when I came out 15 minutes later my apartment was filled with smoke. Looked up another scone recipe in a cookbook and decided to try the next batch at the same temp for 7-8 minutes. They were perfect, especially if you are not a big fan of the dryness of your typical scone.

Quick prep time, easy enough for a beginner, and yet unique / impressive for an office breakfast treat. I used Cranraisins and a little coconut instead of butterscotch chips. I also made them a little smaller, shaped them into triangles.

These are wonderful. My husband who never eats stuff like scones loved them and keeps asking me to make them again.
