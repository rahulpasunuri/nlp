This smelled fantastic while it was cooking and the flavor was just ok, but the texture put my family over the edge. It was a bit slimy. Also, this is not a pretty dish to display. Disappointing, because everything looked and smelled great in the preparation. However, as potpurri, it's great!

Great recipe, everybody loved it. Added a little heavy cream (2 TBS) at the end to make it a little saucy. It was a big hit!

This was really pretty, but to be quite frank, I had to force myself to eat it (and this is from someone who likes fennel).

I prepared this to accompany a Christmas Eve Seven Fishes dinner. Everyone loved it. The only thing I did different (other than add more garlic as suggested by another review) was to add some sea salt. The salt seemed to boost the flavor and I was surprised that the recipe did not call for any salt (unless I overlooked it).

Is salt needed for this recipe? I'm going to make this for a Christmas Eve dinner.

This is always a hit - even with people who think they don't like fennel. Agree with other reviewers that it needs more garlic.

Made this to go with the duck with fennel and garlic on this site and it was delicious. I followed the recipe to the letter and the only thing I would change next time is to reduce the uncovered cooking time slightly, as the lemon juice and cooking liquids tended to burn on the bottom of the pan. Great, easy side dish.

Excellent. Added a leek I had lying around. Easy and yummy.

Great recipe. Made it for Thanksgiving and it was the first dish finished. Roasted it in a wood burning oven for about an hour and a half and it was really delicious. I will make this one again.

Served this at Thanksgiving and it was gone immediately. Very nice balance of flavors and the lemon works particularly well. Next time I will go a little easy on the shallots.

Mellow flavors. Best to serve it alongside a dish with some zip. Added an extra clove of garlic. Great Thanksgiving side dish for our Italian inspired menu.

Very bland.
