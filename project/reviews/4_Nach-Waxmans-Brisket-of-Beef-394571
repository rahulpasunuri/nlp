Those of you who allowed your annoyance at the political reference in the recipe to deter you, you have cut off your noses to spite your face because this is far and away the most delicious succulent brisket recipe I have ever made or eaten anywhere. And easy! I

Ditto on the LOL on "perhaps...Obama." I asked myself, what kind of person would throw an Obama reference into an intro to a brisket recipe? I found out it's a person who self-describes her work as "profound." From Amazon: "I was born and raised in Baltimore, went to college in Connecticut, worked in advertising in New York since the day I graduated from college. I have always written - advertising copy (I am a creative director at a small NY agency) and books. I like to write about lifestyle, food, entertaining, and issues that are relevant to women. I am a contributing editor to Metropolitan Home Magazine. I have written profound books about body image issues of teenage girls and I have ghost-written cookbooks. My new book lets me use my life experience to help other women shortcut their own experiences. I think of myself at the moment as a Life Sherpa. Or as Oprah would probably say, "as a life sherpa in progress." I feel like I have done pretty much everything, at least once. I have had one marriage, one husband, one divorce, two daughters, many Bearded Collies, countless cats, zillions of great friends, endless life experiences, one perfect macaroni and cheese recipe." Ditto on keeping politics off Epi. Because? 99% of the time the politics are insipid.

Was going to try it, but author's Obama worship made me lose my appetite. Try the 2nd Ave deli recipe, it's a killer.

I have been making this brisket recipe for years. It always turns out great. I get raves from family and friends. I highly recommend it. It's even better if you make it a day ahead, the flavors meld beautifully. I do add extra carrots, that's my only change.

Easy and fast for delicious, flavorful, succulent meat. I started with a 3-lb brisket and used 1 very large onion & 6 cloves garlic. I followed the recipe, but used 3 TBSP tomato paste. Since I had only 2 hours to cook, I turned the oven to 500ºF and used convection to roast for 30 min. Then I reduced the heat to 375ºF for 40 minutes. For the carving the meat step, I found that the brisket was extremely tender, so good. The meat was resting in a rich, tasty broth. It needed no more cooking. I roasted for a total of 1 hr 10 min. Now that's a quick recipe! Many thanks to Mr. Waxman!

What a terrfic and easy recipe--my guests, including 4 kids under 6, gobbled it up. Did add more carrots than called for. Served with roasted root veg and some horseradish cream.

I just took this out of the oven and it is tender beyond any experience I have ever had with brisket, and I have been making them ofr 40 years. I was a little worried because I used grass fed beef which can be too lean. I am puzzled though because the recipe and some posters give the impression that there is very little liquid; I have tons, as much as in a standard brisket recipe that adds liquid. Not sure why, but i am not complaining.

To the cook from Florida with the heat question: The 1st part of the recipe up until the "turn off the heat comment" (searing the meat and browning the onions) takes place on the stove top. Then you put it in the preheated heated oven.

I was surprised at how rich and delicious this was with so few ingredients. I kept thinking I should add brandy and flambe or even some wine...nope, just tried it first as is - great! I made it the day before using two briskets as the store had none larger than 4 pounds and I was feeding a crowd. I followed the directions but stacked the two roasts after brushing them both with tomato paste - thus using more than suggested. I served with roasted carrots and smashed potatoes. I'm glad I have some leftovers - hash!

This recipe is the Xanax for my annual brisket anxiety. It was by far the best, unfussiest, and most satisfying brisket I have ever made. Thank you!

I have been making this recipe for years and my husband and I both love it. Although you do have to cook it for several hours, you don't have to tend to it except once during that time and the brisket comes out very tender. We always add more carrots since we like them and sometimes I throw in some red potato chunks to make it a one pot dish.

Just a point ....recipe states to turn off heat for the tomato paste....no mention of turning the temp back on and to what...then it says to lower it to 325 after slicing and returning it to the oven....would appear the temp remains at 375 until this last step but...unclear....My mother always seared the meat uncovered at 400 for an hour, then reduced to 350 and added zillions of onions, cover and let it go.....ALWAYS moist and tender and full of very caramelized onions and a HIT with my family....

Oh for Passover, I just use matzoh flour instead of regular flour. No big deal and then it is Kosher for Passover!

This is WRONG..............you can't use flour at Passover. And since you posted it a day before the first seder, you have made a huge error................

I have made this recipe since I first got the New Basics over 20 years ago. It is no fail. I don't baste. Depending on the size of the brisket (anywhere from 1 to 4 lbs) I double or triple the tomato paste. With a small brisket I reduce the number of onions and with bigger brisket I increase the carrots.I cook potatoes separately. I cover the pan with foil and then the lid. It is never dry. I chill and remove the fat from the gravy, sometimes I add some wine and cook on the stove, other times I puree the onions and carrots with the gravy and make a thicker sauce. Either way, it gets devoured!

This has become the go-to brisket recipe in our Brooklyn apartment building. Simple and delicious. Traditional in a good way. The only change I make is to throw in a few extra carrots. I use as many sliced onions as will fit in my double burner pot. After the slicing step, I often cool and refrigerate overnight, then complete the cooking on the night I am serving it.

I thought this was fabulous! The slicing midway through approach did result in a very moist brisket. Having all the braising liquid come from the onions resulted in a very nice, rich gravy and the onions were beautifully carmelized at finish. Be careful to watch the moisture level after returning the sliced meat to the oven. It did absorb the braising liquid fairly quickly. I agree with the previous reviewer who suggested more vegetables. A few more carrots and some potatoes would have been a nice addition. Go Nach!

Not my favorite brisket. I wonder if highter heat and faster cook time accounts for less tender results.

Flour and corn oil are not allowed for Passover! You may want to explain that since this recipe is included in your Passover guide.

This is the first time I've ever seen my Mother's recipe written out just the way she made it and taught me how to make it. She always said the secret was in the onions. And however many you think is OK add one more. The long slow cooking makes the combo of the meat and onions with the small amount of tomato sauce into a delish gravy. Slicing the meat half way through is the other secret to tender, flavorfully juicy moist meat. The addition we do is to prepare carrots and potatos (peel and cut) and add them after slicing. They add another layer of flavor to the meat and the veggies take on the flavor of the meat and sauce as well. Don't forget to check every half hour or so to baste and make sure there is enough moisture. Prepare a day in advance to allow flavors to mellow and to remove fat. ALWAYS a rave review because it's fantastic.
