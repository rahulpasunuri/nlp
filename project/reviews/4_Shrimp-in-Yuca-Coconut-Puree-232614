We made a few shortcuts and still ended up with a fabulous meal. Instead of making a shrimp brith, I used organic low-sodium chicken broth. Couldn't find malagueta chiles, so we used two Thai chiles (also known as chiles de arbor.". Used canned, drained yucca, cut into small pieces, which I sautéed in olive oil with the onion and garlic before adding the coconut milk. Also couldn't find dende oil (we live in a culinary wasteland), but the dish was spectacular anyway. I have used dende in the past, and it would have given the dish a whole different flavor...but still good.

This is by far one of the best dishes I've made in a long time. I went to 5 different grocery stores and couldn't find yuca, and ended up using sweet potatoes and a yam instead. (it's what I had on hand). The dish turned out great. I'd love to try it again, next time actually using yuca, but the sweet potato/yam combo was still really great.

this recipe for Bobo (accent on the second o) is great, however it's worth noting that it's typically served as a stew with the yucca puree and shrimp all mixed in, not on top of the puree. My only complaint is that this recipe is time consuming- but very good and not challenging.

Great recipe with a wonderful mix of flavors!! In my version, I substituted fish for the shrimp (I like it more), added small chunks of cococut to the yuca and lemon juice, cumin, and curry to the red sauce because I thought it sounded like a nice touch. Turned out great!! I highly recommend it. Especially great if you live in South America (which I do). Way easy to find the ingredients...

Awesome blend of flavors. Couldn't find the Thai peppers so had to substitute a Serrano and could have used more, an added kick would have been superb!
