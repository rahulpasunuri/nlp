This is a "do-over" recipe that my 14 year old son and wife loved. Take the time to reduce the sauce. The carrots came out a bit more "al dente" than is my taste, but nonetheless, very good.

I thought this was great! I only used the 300 ml bottle of sake because 750 seemed like a lot to have to get down to 6 tbsp. The fish was flaky, tender and moist, but took about 12-14 minutes to cook. Paired it with a Moosewood recipe of lemongrass/pineapple rice.

This was indeed a tasty and healthy meal. I used a multi-purpose steamer for the fish and veggies, and threw in a variety of small potatoes for the starch. Also, a nice alternative to the sake was Korean soju.

Overall a simple and healthy meal. I believe the halibut was a little dry, although it may have been because I overcooked it. I used a smaller bottle of sake because the stuff's expensive. The dill works really well with both the carrots and the halibut. I'd make again.

I made the recipe exactly as written, and it was superb. The flavors were complex but delicate, harmonized perfectly. And the reduced sauce was to die for. I served it with steamed black rice and nothing else: it is a dish of understated elegance. Great.

The halibut was great. The vegatable were "not taste"

Some people might complain that I missed the whole point of the recipe by not using sake, but sometimes you've just got to use what you have. So what I had was a bottle of white zinfandel left over from a Sangria party. The sweetness of the zinfandel was lovely with the halibut and carrots. I'm teaching the husband to eat fish, and the fact that he scarfed it down and asked for more means we had a resounding success! So easy, healthy, and tasty!
