This is a delicious dressing. We prepared it as written, except for the fact that we eliminated the parsley. The creamy white dressing contrasts beautifully against an assortment of greens and vegetables. It is really an exceptional version of a blue cheese dressing.

I made it as a dip (by omitting the buttermilk) and served it with crudites. It was excellent.

Really delicious; I think the herbs make it and I would not omit the parsley. I like to substitute 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo for all dressing bases as opposed to all mayo. I also had to use regular milk, which I think made the dressing runnier than if I had used buttermilk. In either case my advice would be to add the liquid until the dressing's at your desired consistency.

So easy and fresh. I used the new Olive Oil mayo. My 13 yr old nephew was almost eating out of the salad bowl. I forgot the chives but it was still good. Hope to remember them next time.

This was outstanding. We used it as a sauce for grilled tenderloin. I took everyone's suggestion to heart and added an additional tablespoon of blue cheese. Lastly, if you don't have buttermilk, you can use the following substitute which is darn close. Add 1/2 Tbl. white vinegar to 1/2 cup milk. Wait 5 minutes and then use with recipe.

This is perfect. Added a bit more cheese as others suggested and that was a good choice.

Easy and Awesome. Perfect on a steakhouse salad with some heirloom tomatoes and crisp bacon. Yum!

In my review below I said I would omit the parsley next time. But after it sat in the fridge overnight we had it again and thought it was very good with the parsley. More fresh tasting and a little different. I recommend you give it a try with the parsley especially if it will have a little time to blend flavors. Still needs a bit more cheese though.

Really good dressing and would be an excellent crudite dip. I made it exactly as written but will definitely omit the parsley and increase the amount of blue cheese next time as some others have suggested.

This is THE best dressing. Great with bacon bits sprinkled on after dressing the salad. We love it.

I pretend that this recipe is my secret blue cheese dressing recipe and make my family members beg for it! I do not use the parsley, I think it has a flat flavor, but instead use fresh dill in its place. Of course, I always double the garlic and add extra cheese.

A good basic blue cheese dressing. It had a bit of a heavy mayo flavor for me so i sharpened the flavor with some sherry vinegar. I also left out the parsley and sprinkled the chives on top of the salad instead. It was a hit in the end and with these tweaks i'll make it again.

This is the best Blue Cheese Dressing we have ever made! It's great on lettuce and sliced apples at this time of the season.

Wow, super tasty. I didn't have buttermilk so I used powdered buttermilk mixed with water but added twice as much powder as I should have. No matter, the extra flavor was great! It came out pretty watery, but I was winging it with measurements, and heck, it tasted good, so I didn't care--I just used a spoon to scoop up the dressing, then plopped a baby carrot on the spoon, and down it went. Nice, nice!

This is so easy and really great tasting. My chives are done for the season, so I used a tablespoon of minced onion and it worked fine. I tasted it without the onion and it was just as good. Terrific over a simple green salad of romaine, onions, and shaved carrot. Could also see this as a dip for crudites...

Oh yeah. I didn't have enough blue cheese but it didn't matter. I made it as dressing and served it as dip with veggies, and it vanished.

Yummy, yummy. I tasted the dressing without the blue cheese and also thought it was excellent - could use as a base for a sort of green goddess dressing. Couldn't stop dipping things in the final product.
