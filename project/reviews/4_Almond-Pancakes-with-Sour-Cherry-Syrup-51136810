These pancakes are so deliciously simple, the syrup isn't even necessary. Works with any fruit. I added a little regular (I used 1%) milk to thin the batter so that they pour/cook better.

I made this on a quiet Saturday morning. And they were excellent. The previous reviewer mentioned adding butter, but I didn't because the lowfat buttermilk has enough fat in it. The pancakes were tender and fluffy, and the syrup was really nice - especially a couple of days later when I ate the leftovers. Because of that I would recommend making the syrup at least the night before to really let it absorb the cherry flavor. Made the day of, it was definitely more maple flavored than cherry. I will be making this again

The syrup is really good and I will make again. The pancakes are good, but if you have a basic recipe you really like, use that and add almonds and almond flavoring. I added some melted butter to the batter because none is listed and pancakes usually have that in the them.
