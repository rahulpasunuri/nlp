Great first course for a gourmet group of 8!! We made the mistake of grilling the quail ahead of time and then just 'crisping' it before serving. We forgot to take it out of the refrigerator so we nuked them for 2 minutes, then put them on the grill, skin side down, for a couple of minutes. Needless to say, overdone. They grill so fast it really wasn't necessary to do ahead but this was a multi-course dinner and, well, you get the picture. Dressing is great and presentation is unique.

I made this as a starter for Christmas Day dinner withe my parents. I made it exactly as specified with the exception of grilling the quail (not an option where I live). Instead, I seasoned it very lightly with olive oil and Lawry's seasoning salt and baked it in the oven. On first read I thought the dish would be ho-hum, but the combination of all ingredients are terrific together. Do yourself a favor: don't omit any of the ingredients, as everything works so beautifully together. This one is a keeper and really pleased all palates at my table.

I just made the vinaigrette--really easy and really tasty! I doubled the garlic, used wine vinegar and used half-and-half instead of cream. Probably would be better with all the real ingredients, but this is what I had to work with, and it was great!

I can't rate the quail part as I only made the vinaigrette, desperate for a tasty salad dressing. It is OUTSTANDING. I generally hate bottled dressings but sometimes buy them for convenience anyway, but I will never buy another bottled dressing now that I've made this. You can increase or decrease the garlic per your taste but I found the recipe amount to be perfect. So simple to make, even simpler if you just pour into a cruet and shake vigorously rather than wisking. I just put it on a regular boring green leaf salad w/tomatoes and carrots and suddenly I had a restaurant dish. Especially tasty with shaved parmesan on the salad. Yum!

GREAT recipe. It's a good vinaigrette recipe for another use, too. We enjoyed a Sierra Cantabria Rioja with it, as a first course.

This is terrific. I serve it as a starter and always get compliments. I just serve the quail on a bed of mixed greens/mesclun and it's quick and easy. In my permanent collection.

Great salad dressing with a nice 'bite.' I doubled the recipe and filled a cruet to store in the refrigerator and take out when salad is on the menu, along with several others. A quantum leap better than store-bought dressings and much, much cheaper!
