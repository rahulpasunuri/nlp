As written, way too much lemon. The juice and zest of one lemon would have been sufficient. It would have been nice with some toasted pine nuts as well. I think I've made this before and trusted my instincts the first time about the lemon and pine nuts, but this time I followed the recipe. It wasn't very good at first but fortunately the lemon taste did mellow out a bit for leftovers. I would make it again with modifications.

This was kind of just okay. The flavor combination was interesting--don't omit the ginger!--but wasn't really my favorite. Good way to use up beet greens though.

Very tasty and a great way to get greens into your diet. I was worried it would be too tart with all the lemon juice, but it wasn't. I used 8 oz of whole wheat penne rather than 1 lb of orechiette to make it a little healthier. Also, I was running short on time so I omitted the ginger.

I just made this for dinner tonight & it is AWESOME! I used some curly mac (I didn't have ears). & I did not have beet greens so I used broccoli with the chard. Also - We pretty much only used 1/2 the pasta in a shallow bowl & put the cheese & greens on top to give more greens & less carbs (for 2 people), & fresh cherry tomato, grated parm & fresh chopped basil. It's pretty lemony, but fresh & Yum

I loved this dish! I followed the recipe exactly and my boyfriend and I were so pleasantly surprised by how good it was. Don't skip the fresh ginger if you can, it really brought a level of complexity to the dish, and tied together the bitter greens with the lemon and the goat cheese.

Very good.... and very easy. I had all the ingredients, so I followed the recipe except I skipped the ginger (didn't want to combine it with goat cheese) and added pine nuts and red pepper flakes. I'd definitely make it again.

I loved this dish, and it takes about 35 minutes from start to finish. I also altered my recipe just a bit. First off, I was cooking for 1, so I halved the recipe and I certainly have leftovers! So, I forgot to buy ginger, so that was left out. I used a mixture whole wheat penne and whole wheat rigatoni, and the sauce/topping is very complex and dense that I think it went well with the WW pasta. I added red pepper flakes for some heat, sliced up a small summer squash which I added to the onion/garlic saute, and used arugula in the very last step when I tossed all the ingredients together. Also, the grocery store didn't carry golden raisins, so I used normal ones. I drank it with a chilled Montepulciano, and I thought was a great mixture as well. A really great, healthy, filling dinner. Yum!

This was delicious, though I did change the recipe a bit. I didn't have raisins so I used currants instead. I didn't have lemon juice, lemon zest or ginger so I just omitted them. I soaked the currants in water and it turned out wonderful.

This recipe turned out pretty well, and makes for a nutritious and interesting pasta dish. The raisins add a nice sweet note and the flavors meld well, although I did make some alterations. I added some white wine to the onion and garlic before adding in the greens, used kale rather than chard, hot pepper flakes instead of ginger for some extra kick, and topped with pine nuts.

I'm not going to rate this one since I deviated from the recipe. I omitted the raisins (didn't have any) and lemon juice. Substituted the ginger with approximately 2tsp red pepper flakes and farfalle instead of orecchiette. I used Chabis with black pepper for the goat cheese and topped it off with toasted pine nuts. Turned out good (probably a 3 for rating), but a little dry. Next time I'll save some of the pasta water to moisten it a little.

Must have done something very wrong, like using feta instead of goat cheese but was it awful! And the color, ugh! But I must say the goat liked the leftovers the next day. And they were aplenty.

Wonderful. We added a little white wine and it was great. Can't go wrong with goat cheese and greens. Served with sauteed jerusalem artichokes on the side and dinner was a hit!

Yum! Had everything but the beet greens and it was still delicious....used crumbled goat cheese. very interesting flavor combos here.

Wow -- this was delicious. I used double the chard, instead of chard + beet greens, and farfalle for the pasta. Just fabulous.

This was really good! I cut back a little on the goat cheese but other than that made it as written...we loved it. Definitely will go into the regular dinner rotation.

Well, I was out of lemon juice, so I used orange juice instead, and the tanginess was wonderful! To be honest, I added a splash of lime juice to make it a hair less sweet. My husband was worried about the raisins, but he just loved it in the end! Easy, too.

I've been very pleased with every other recipe I've tried on this site, but this one was NASTY. It was too sour for us, and we like lemony things generally.

This won't be the prettiest dish you'll ever make, but it is full of wonderfully delicious flavor. My husband groaned when he saw it (he was expecting pasta with cheese), but he ate two large servings. This is a great way to eat healthy greens; I wouldn't change a thing.

I needed an appetizer so I made the filling, mixed in 1 egg + cream, then filled into a pastry triangle for an excellent and different app. Great combination of flavors!

This was very tasty! I have chard in my garden and this is a great way to use it up. Try pine nuts as a garnish.

We followed the suggestion and roasted beets to serve with the pasta. I actually roasted them a day ahead when I was using the oven for another dish, so I served the beets cold with a little balsamic vinaigrette, like a salad. (I copied this from Boulevard.) We liked the pasta, probably because it had goat cheese in it. I have a hard time getting my husband to eat greens as a side, so this dish was a tricky way to do it and it worked. He really liked it.

LOVE this recipe -- and it's easy to make too.

This is a great recipe - and very versatile - You can add or omit without totally affecting the flavor, sometimes I plump raisins in water or wine. Onions, shallots also work. I don't use the ginger. It is so quick and easy - perfect for a busy day. Red pepper flakes can spice it up as well (probably what the point of the ginger is).

I had this a few weeks ago and haven't stopped thinking about it since! It was really delicious, and so unusual! I absolutely can't wait to make it again.

I really thought this was awful. The flavors didn't meld at all, and the goat cheese made this dish overwhelmingly rich without adding a lot of flavor. It actually made me feel sick to my stomach! I certainly won't be making this again.

Very unusual, and very tasty. I made this because I found myself with both Swiss chard and beet greens in the fridge. I just couldn't figure out how the flavors would meld, but I went on faith, and it turned out great. The greens wilted down and became very manageable; the ginger, which I can never seem to mince small enough, was a nice note but not obtrusive; the raisins are much subtler than I thought they'd be. I was also concerned about the goat cheese, but it simply melted into a kind of modified cream sauce.

I had high hopes for this recipe b/c I love goat cheese and swiss chard. When I actually tried it, the ingredients did not combine well, the beat greens were bitter, the goat cheese became mush and the greens clumped together. We ended up tossing most of it out. However, the critics above gave it good reviews. If I had all the ingredients on hand I might give it another try. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to make this again.

I was a little apprehensive about making this recipe, as the ingredients seemed very eclectic- goat cheese with ginger? but it worked tremendously well, turned out to be a sort of "chic" mararoni and cheese... the roasted beets on the side turned out to be a treat for my guests as well...i highly recommend!

It was delicious; even my husband enjoyed it and he is not particularly fond of anything vegetarian. Very refreshing with the lemon altho I might use a little less the next time. I served this with roasted beets - simply marvelous!
