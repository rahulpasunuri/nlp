My men did really liked this. The color was not good. I'd change that if I used this recipe again.

Yesterday, made this recipe a second time, but used honeydew melon with a touch of lime. It's simply quite sensational, sorbet like and a palate cleanser. You do need to whip it to break up the ice crystals and NO you don't need an ice cream maker. We are trying NOT TO eat it all up quickly, but I do want to try the watermelon next. YUM YUM

I loved this stuff! And so did my guests. I wanted some creaminess, so I used coconut milk instead of cow's milk.

I found this really tasty, and easy. Definitely be careful about how much of the sugar syrup you add, as I found half was enough.

I will definitely make this again -- so creamy and delicious, and less fatty than ice cream.

Made this recipe as instructed. Would try again with condensed sweetened milk and water instead of separate milk and simple syrup. I've had this recipe served as a smoothie at vietnamese restaurants as well, though with less avocado flavor than here.

Even without the Ice Cream maker this recipe was absolutely delicious!! I was in Oaxaca for one week last month and did try the ices on Plaza de la Soledad, and I cannot believe I am making it now. Thank you!
