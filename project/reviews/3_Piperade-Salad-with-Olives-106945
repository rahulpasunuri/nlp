I made this for guests to accompany my paella. To say it was a hit is an understatement. I think they may have liked this more than the paella!

I served this as an accompaniment to our dinner and it is wonderful. I can see if you chop it up it would be great as bruschetta. One thing it isn't is blah!

Needs something. Too blah for us.

I have made this recipe several times. I use it as an appetizer. I grill baguette slices, place goat cheese on them and top with the piperade recipe. It has always been a hit.

I am now a HUGE fan of sherry vinegar!

Very easy and attractive side dish for a buffet or potluck. Everyone liked it.

I made this for a side dish at a buffet luncheon, and it was a great way to add a lot of color to the table. The taste was good, but it really stood out in terms of appearance. A warning, though: it doesn't make enough for eight people, unless they take rather tiny portions.
