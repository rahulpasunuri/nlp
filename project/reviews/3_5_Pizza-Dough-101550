We make this recipe regularly, and when we had small kids in the house, they helped out kneading the tiny balls of dough (not always with the best results...). I also use some whole wheat flour, and I pre-bake to get a crispy crust. (You can take these pre-baked shells and either freeze or refrigerate for a day.) Note that dividing the main dough into six balls, as recommended, makes for *tiny* individual pizzas. Great for quite young children, but not much else.

I chose this recipe because of the minimum of negative comments from the other reviewers vs the other pizza dough recipes listed. It was easy and fast. I used the whole recipe and made one 16" pizza dough which I baked on a pizza stone. It came out perfectly golden and crispy, but lacked a distinctive flavor. I did add some garlic powder to the flour, and brushed olive oil on the crust prior to baking, which gave it the golden color. I think a little more salt, and some herbs added to the flour would jazz it up a bit. But for a plain ole pizza dough, it rocks!!

Excellent pizza dough. Cheated a little and used my bread machine to mix kneed and rise the dough. First I let the yeast proof in the machine bucket than added the flour & olive oil. Will be mading the dough again

I have been making this pizza dough for years. It is simple and delicious. I even make it during the week after work. If you like your pizza thin and crispy, pre-bake the crust on a stone for 7 or so minutes, top it and then finish baking. If you pre-bake it be sure to poke forks holes in it so it doesn't bubble up. Just like a resturant.

I add 1/4 cup olive oil (not extra virgin, as I love the taste of olive to carry in the dough, and some fresh rosemary. A tip with fresh rosemary- place leaves in a cup and use scissors to snip it multiple times in the cup!

This is the best pizza dough I have ever made myself. That said, I still felt like it could use something . . . maybe a light brush of olive oil just before baking? Otherwise, chewy, crisp and delicious--we made personal pizzas & everyone loved them! To answer the previous cook's question: only add as much flour as you need to get a smooth dough that doesn't stick to your fingers or the kneading surface; too much flour, and you start to get a leaden lump of unworkable dough (speaking from experience here:D) Bon appetit!

This is my first time in making pizza. This recipe is excellent. I added 1/4 cup whole wheat flour to the 2 1/4 cups white flour which added excellent taste and texture.

I make this pizza dough recipe once a week - even after work. It is easy and delicious. After I roll out the dough I place it on a pizza peel sprinkled with corn meal (for easy transfer). I put on the toppings and slide it into the oven on to a preheated baking stone. Perfect every time.

This is the first time I have made homemade pizza and while it does not taste like take-out pizza I thought it was very nice. Also, it did not take a full three cups of flour when making the dough. Did other people use all three?

Great - and classic recipe. Make sure the oven is 100% pre-heated. I'd do it again.

The pizza crust turned out hard and was a disappointment. Unfortunately, my experience was not the same as the other reviewers.

After trying numerous pizza dough recipes, this one is by far the best! I do it all in the food processor, using rapid rise yeast. After rising for about 45 minutes, it's ready to toss on the hot stone. It bakes up beautifully with an artisan look that's very impressive. I've topped it with smoked chicken, caramelized onions, ricotta, roasted red peppers and a really good parmesan. Woohoo!

I got tired of take out pizza in our small town and wanted to try something new. My 2 girls tried this and they absolutely loved it. I let them make their own individual pizzas. (Which was great fun). They even ate all the crust, which they never do. Wonderful flavor and texture. Made my own pizza sauce while the dough was rising. It was phenominal. My husband came home and loved it so much he had two pizza's. Each with our various topping. Alot of fun and we got to dress it with our own specific tastes. We used a pizza stone. I think that made the crust crispy and tender at the same time. I think I will use this for my next childs birthday party and they can embelish as they like. YUMMY!!!! I wouldn't change a thing. AWESOME!!!!

This is the BEST dough recipe out there. It rises beautifully and tastes great. Make sure to knead the dough just like it says -- it takes a little while. Results are so worth it. I've made this recipe for 4 years now and it is terrific.

as someone who has a big fear of yeast (too time & consuming & too high of a risk of failure), this is a no-brainer. I made it ahead & stuck it in the fridge (note- it will continue to rise even in the fridge!) anyway, my only goof was not letting the dough come to room temp before shaping my pizzas. they wound up a little thicker, but still tasted scrumptious. my favorite pizza in ATL uses pastry flour for a super-thin crust, haven't tried it yet, but may next time. if you have whole wheat flour- go ahead & throw it in- you'll never know the difference & a little extra fiber never hurt anyone!

one question: if you freeze the dough, do you just let it return to room temp (and how long does that take?) or do you have to let it rise again at room temp? would be helpful to know for meal planning...thanks!

My fist attempt at this recipe was quite the dough debacle! It was all me though, not the recipe, and as a testament to the recipe, even with my misteps and shortcuts, this dough turned out great and made a wonderful foundation for a two family make-your-own pizza night. To the previous reviewer, yes, use your processor. I used my Kitchen Aid with the dough hook attachment and it was fine. I also forgot to let the dough rest after I cut it into samll balls. I had a friend's children (4 and 6) kneading their own pieces, and it was still great. Crispy and flaky. I did use 1/4 C whole wheat and would definitely do it again. I will try making this and keeping some frozen for easy use during the week.

I've never made a pizza in my life. Now I got a food processor for Christmas gift. I'd just like to know if I can use food processor to simplify the dough making process?

I was concerned that this was going to be a little too labor intensive, but was not. It turned out great. I rolled my dough fairly thin for a more crispy crust. Anyone could put this together.....oh, and my husband thinks he will never order out for pizza again..that good. :)

This was my first homemade pizza dough ever and I was VERY nervous making it. I did think the recipe had a lot of steps and the dough really didn't seem to double in size after an hour. I kept telling myself to trust the recipe because I followed it to a T. Well, I rolled out three individual pizzas (maybe 4 small slices cut up in each) and cooked one right away to see if I'd jacked anything up. Surprisingly, the dough baked just fine and tasted pretty darn good. I did get bubbles in the dough as it was cooking that I "popped". This seems like a great basic pizza dough recipe to start with and maybe add herbs, garlic, etc. to it to jazz it up. I still thought it was pretty time consuming and seemed like a lot of waiting and kneading was involved. I'd sure like to find an easier recipe where you just mix up a few ingredients and roll out a dough but maybe that's wishful thinking for this rookie! I hear T.J.'s had great pizza dough and next time I might just resort to that :)

This is the recipe I've been hunting for since I got married 10 years ago! My husband and I never agree on any doughs I've tried (one likes it and the other doesn't) but this was one was a hit with both of us --and our picky toddler as well! The dough was super easy to make and came out tender but with a firm crust, not too thin and not too thick. This is the dough we'll be making from now on.

I've made this recipe about a dozen times and it very good though I suggest the use of fresh yeast in place of dry. I use about a third of a 50 gram block (~0.5 ounces) and the dough rises much better than with dry yeast. The final product is a light, slightly chewy but very tasty dough.

I love this recipe! It's the first pizza dough that my whole family likes and all my friends are asking me for the recipe. I used my mixer with dough hook instead of mixing by hand. After I took it out of the mixer I kneaded the dough for a minute or two. Turned out chewy on the outside soft and light on the inside. Delicious!!!!

I've come to the conclusion that pizza dough is tricky (and this has been supported by pastry chef friends). It is hard to get that perfect combination of tender and crispy. I'm not going to go to the trouble of making it again (Trader Joes has bags of pizza dough for .99c and it is amazing!)

This was an easy pizza dough with good results. I put the dough onto a hot pizza stone and then pre-cooked it for about 5 minutes to ensure that I wouldn't have a soggy crust. It turned out great. I doubled the recipe and put half in the freezer for next time.

I picked the recipe based on the reviews...and I came to the conclusion that either I have totally different taste buds than most of the reviewers, or I messed up in some point in the recipe. I personally think the crust did not rise very much -even though I left it for more that 12 minutes(because it looked undercooked)-and still I did not get a puffy pizza crust. Also it lacked flavor and substance.

I made one large pizza with this recipe and found it to be great. It rose well and turned out nice and crispy. I'm sure this would make a great thin crust if I rolled it out further.

This recipe is the best because the proportions are so easy to remember. I have it memorized now. I make double batches and always have some in the freezer.

I made this recipe with my little sisters; it was the best homemade pizza crust we've tried. We baked it on a pizza stone and brushed the crust with olive oil during baking. It was much enjoyed!

I decided to make one large pizza from this recipe, and it worked great. My pizza crust turned out near-perfect--and its near miss with perfection was because I didn't have a baking sheet large enough for all of the dough, which meant I couldn't roll it out as thin as I would've liked. It rose beautifully and was crisp outside but chewy, soft and bready on the inside. The perfect Chicago-style deep-dish pizza, even though I was looking for a slightly thinner crust. I added 3/4 teaspoon of baking powder to the flour (helps make the crust crisp and also aids in raising it), brushed the unbaked dough several times with olive oil (infused it with a nice subtle flavor) and pre-baked it for about 10 minutes before adding the sauce, cheese and toppings. I'll definitely be using this recipe again--hopefully with a proper pizza stone to bake with. My mind is already full of variations and possibilities for this nice, basic recipe. Perfect for beginners too--this was my first attempt at making pizza and my second attempt with a bread product (do doughnuts count as a kind of bread??).

This dough is super easy to make AND good! I've tried (with only minimal success) several different pizza dough recipes and this one works the best for me. It makes really great pizza, and my kids had a blast making their own little pizzettas. I baked them on a pizza stone at 500 degrees. The crust had a nice crispy texture on the bottom, but was still a bit chewy in the middle. Just the way we like it!

Hi my name is Sammy T and today (nov 5 2000) I had a craving for a homemade pizza so i decided to look up a recipe. Everyone in my family thought it was the best!

It's most likely my fault that this recipe was no better than most pizza crusts I have attempted. I added about 1/4 cup of mixed herbs and 1tbsp of roasted garlic to the recipe. I also used my bread machine to make the dough. It all turned out very nicely until I cooked it. Even at a high temperature and on a dark seasoned pan the crust on the bottom was somewhat soggy, and not puffy and yummy. I'm sure it's my technique and would appreciate any advice that could be offered.

This is a very dependable recipe. It has good flavor and texture; rises very well. For those of us who are not pros at dough tossing, it's a bit of a challenge. But don't give up. It will fit eventually.

This gets high marks for being easy and rising quickly. The resulting pizza crust, when cooked, was somewhat bready and needed more taste.

This is definitely a no-fail recipe. I have always been able to cook but was not strong on baking. Today I decided at 4:45 I wanted homemade pizza for dinner and the end result was flawless (due to the recipe not the chef!) I topped ours with caramelized onions/shallots, basil, a little Parmesan cheese. I froze half the dough so I hope that works as well too.

Kudos on this recipe. It is amazing. But would someone have a recipe of pizza dough made with baking powder as the rising agent? Thank you fellow home cooks.

I made this dough for a couple friends and my husband. We each topped our own pizzas and I cooked them on baking stones. We all like the crust very much, and I plan on making it again soon. Compared to the other recipes I read for crusts, this one seemed much simpler.

An excellent recipe - I've used this dough recipe 3 times in the last 2 weeks to make various sized pizzas! I use garlic-infused olive oil to add some more taste and I double the thickness of the crust (highly recommend). When you double the thickness, the dough bubbles up and is crisp on the bottom and thick, soft and chewy on top. A fool-proof recipe.

Everything worked just like it said it would. My 3 year old and I enjoyed making up the pizza's. She topped it with pepperoni and grapes (to each her own I say!) I brushed the crust with Olive oil for extra taste and double layed the crusts so that they were thicker. Plan to make more this weekend!
