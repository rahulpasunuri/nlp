I made this just as the recipe called for and I like it enough to try it again, but with some revisions. It needs something to jazz it up a bit. Perhaps some pancetta or good quality prosciutto. The flavor of lemon and fresh nutmeg was nice. I might experiment with other flavors as well. It sparked my imagination for different things to fill the toasted bread shells with. Yum!
