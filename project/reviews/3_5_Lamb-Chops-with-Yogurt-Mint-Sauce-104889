Simple and pretty good. Not quite impress-your-friends good but it's-a- weeknight-and-I'm-cooking-for-two good. The yogurt gets better with time. Consider night before to mix it up, perhaps. Not necessary but a nice to have.

This recipe was fantastic, but what makes it is the cumin/paprika rub listed in an earlier review. i just seared the chops in a pan with olive oil a few min per side and they were ready to go. the entire meal took 20min of prep and cook time!! will def make again!!

Thanks to the reviewer below for the dry rub tip. I did this and it was absolutely fantastic with the yogurt sauce. I'll be making them this way again. Served with a chilled orzo salad with asparagus, yellow bell pepper, cherry tomatoes, garlic olive oil, lemon juice, s&p... this was great.

I varied the receipe by using Jacques Pepin's quick method for lamb chops. Press dry rub on to chops--1 tbs. ea. cumin, paprika, s+p. The chops are then rubbed into the olive oil on a foil, wrapped cookie sheet and broiled @3 mins/side. The sauce was the perfect compliment.

Everything as good as imagined. One thing though--How can this be a serving for 4 when there are only 6 chops called for? 'Here, two for you, and two for you, and two for you and.....'

This was a wonderful and simple recipe. I cooked the chops in the oven at 500 degrees and watched the internal temperature. I used my little food processor/chopper for the mint/yogurt sauce. the meal was a perfect 10 and we will do it again!

I also loved this recipe. The only bad thing was that the chops I bought were awful--fatty and tough and just plain bad. But the sauce was great. I served it with the sauteed fennel and carrot recipe also on this site. I think those were the best veggies I've ever had. My boyfriend and I ended up skipping the chops and eating the veggies with the yogurt sauce. I'll make this again, but I have stopped going to that butcher!

I loved the yogurt-mint sauce! Had to substitute dried mint so continued adding "to taste" (approx. 2 tablespoons dried), and made ahead to allow time for the mint to rehydrate. Really good!

Unreal! My boyfriend is not a fan of mint, so I gave the recipe a try with cilantro instead. It was incredible! I also grilled the chops (rubbing them with garlic first) instead of cooking them on the stove. I'll be making this recipe again and again and again.

I have made this dish many times now and it is one of our favorites. I make the yogurt sauce the night before and it blends better, be sure to take the time to really chop the mint finely so you don't get any leafy taste.

The wife picked up beautiful loin lamb chops at Costco. We essentially prepared this recipe. I prefer a little mustard spread on the chops before grilling. And we like to make this yogurt sauce well ahead of time to let the flavors come together. We served orzo on the side, with a little fennel, chopped kalamata olives and parsley stirred in. Store bought baklava for desert. Perfect!

We all loved this recipe! It was so easy and quick, yet delicious. I could not find the cut recommended, so I used lamb loin chops and grilled them brushed with the olive oil. I accompanied with the cous-cous with apricots - another easy, tasty dish

Very easy to prepare and tasted delicious. Served to six people who all wondered how I became an expert at cooking lamb. Trust me--it was the recipe!
