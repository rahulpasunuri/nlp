I may have simply not been skilled enough to execute these, but they did not quite hold together for me (though my first test ball did OK). (FWIW I would consider myself a relatively experienced cook, but I have not made dumplings like this before.) If I had to guess, I'd say there was too much water left in the chard, but I wrung it out quite thoroughly using a cheesecloth, so maybe it was something else. Of those which did not fall apart, I was not terribly impressed with the flavor-- it wasn't that exciting beyond the flavor of the chard and cheese. The sage browned butter was nice, of course, but didn't rescue it for me.
