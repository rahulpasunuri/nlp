This is a delicious salad. The goat cheese croutons make it. So if you're not going to make the croutons...don't make the salad. In answer to the question below, you brown the bread under the broiler on one side, then flip it over and put the goat cheese on. If you don't want to cut the bread into 4 pieces..the bread with the goat cheese makes a wonderful appetizer. Also, highly recommend the roast chicken with Olivada that originally went with this recipe.

I used storebought Caesar croutons rather than making my own. The salad was good but we found the dressing to be too vinegary. I would reduce the vinegar, or else use a very light vinegar (i.e. rice vinegar) if I made this again.

I also question the use of the goat cheese. I have seen references to goat cheese croutons, using the slices of cheese as the croutons in place of bread, and that is the recipe I was looking for when I came across this one. Very strange...I'll check the magazine to see if the instructions are more complete....
