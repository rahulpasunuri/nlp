So good! Made this for Christmas and everyone raved. Sauce was delicious the next day too. I used a 9 pound ham butt, fresh, but doing the basic cooking beforehand worked well. I didn't use the extra apples, just really good cider and it was wonderful.

I've made this a couple of times and it's been delicious each time. The shank half works well, and I substituted two sliced apples for the dry successfully. Especially good reheated - the sauce keeps it moist. I served with the easy hash-browns casserole, also on this site.

Loved this recipe, as did my guests.

This comes out moist and delicious. Very easy and the fact that it can be made ahead of time for a buffet brunch is great. Used pineapple instead of dried apple. Loved it and would make it again.

Used the sauce from this recipe for our Thanksgiving ham. There were no complaints but it wasn't spectacular. It's a good balance of sweet and sour & the dried apples soften to a nice texture. But in the future I'd use a winter fruit chutney, a Cumberland sauce, a Madiera sauce or a Port sauce.

I used the apple cider mixture as a glaze, omitting the cooling & reheating parts of the recipe since I wanted to serve it the same day it was prepared. Omitted the dried apple chunks, too, and it was still delicious! Cooked the ham very slowly, so it came out incredibly tender. The sauce that was left was passed on the side.

The ham was tender, not salty, and delicious. My entire family enjoyed it and we had enough ham leftover for three meals afterward, so it was an incredibly economical dish. My wife usually doesn't care for ham, but she has already asked me to make it again.

I used a sprial-cut, honey-baked ham and the sauce for this recipe on the side. It was a big holiday hit. I will definitely use this recipe again.

A fabulous sauce. I used this with a smoked ham which I first simmered in ginger ale for half an hour to remove excess salt (fresh butt not available). Everyone loved it.

Some say the definition of eternity is two people and a ham, but I served this for Easter dinner and my husband and I continued to enjoy the leftovers right to the last bite. Great flavor and ease of preparation make this a keeper.

This was truly the best ham I ever had.
