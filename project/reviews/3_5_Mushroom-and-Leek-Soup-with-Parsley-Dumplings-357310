This is a great comfort food recipe. What I crave during a long, cold Montana winter.

Absolutely delicious and worth the time. I used beef instead of vegetable bouillon, chardonnay instead of sherry, regular cottage cheese and almost twice the amount of parsley, garlic, onions and thyme. I will definitely make it again!

While this recipe was a lot of work, I really enjoyed it! I know that other reviewers thought it was bland, but my broth was delicious. I sauteed the onions, leeks, and mushrooms altogether in the same pan. Then made my veggie broth with "Better than Boullion" which is just delicious. The dumplings were great, but next time I would not boil and brown separately. Instead, they can go straight into the broth!

I made the soup with boxed veg broth and thought it was OK, but a bit lacking in mushroom flavor. Next time will try making my own broth and perhaps adding more mushrooms. However, I thought the dumplings were delicious. Lovely fresh parsley flavor. Anyone who felt that they were tasteless probably didn't use a full 3/4 cup of finely chopped fresh parsley. Only used half the butter called for to saute the dumplings and that seemed to be plenty.

While I thought this was very tasty, I just hate dirtying every pot in the house to make one dish. And the dumplings are a tad heavy. So I'm not sure I'll make it again. It certainly wasn't bland. I used vegetarian Better than Bouillon for the base. The combo of mushrooms, garlic, onion, and leek was really good. When it comes to saute time, I'd recommend sauteing everything in the same large pan. I also like another reviewer's suggestion to use the food processor for the dumpling mix. I felt there was a tad too much butter in them, and then they get fried up in butter. I guess that's dumplings.

A lot of work for a soup! This may be way I don't make soup very often. I took a night out of my week to make up the light vegetable broth (which ended up requiring me to use my turkey roasting pan it had so many ingredients!) and I made the soup and dumplings the day before a dinner party, but then still had to saute the dumplings the day of. Just note that if the dumplings have been in the fridge it will take a long time for the water to evaporate enough to make them start browning, so perhaps these should be taken out a bit ahead if they're made ahead and refrigerated. Great taste, though! Just don't do what I did and try to saute the porcini mushrooms instead of the crimini mushrooms...I wish the recipe said to set aside, or have you go ahead and work on the other veggies and mushrooms while the porcini mushrooms are steeping, THEN tell you to slice them, which would then be time for everything to go into the vegetable broth.

This was quite a bit of work for a simple soup but the flavour was really nice, if a bit subtle. Right towards the end, I tasted it and it did seem a bit bland, so I mixed in 1/2 tbsp or Sriracha Sauce and it picked it right up. I don't know if I'd make it again, but it is exactly what I felt like at the time........ bitterendive.blogspot.com

this was so so bland. i followed the directions for the soup and after making that and tasting it didn't even bother to make the dumplings. i couldn't believe it was so tasteless after i spent quite a bit of time (and $'s on the ingredients).

Just read the other reviews. I have no idea what I did differently than the other posters but my soup was fab as were the dumplings. The only things I can think of that I didn't differently: used homemade veg broth I had in the freezer (I'm vegetarian though my husband isn't and he thought the soup was great) used mixed dried mushrooms (you can get a large amount from costco for not too much - I keep them on hand for all my dried mushroom needs) did a healthy glug of sherry (more than the recipe) into the mushrooms when they were done sauteeing added spinach at the end to the soup For the dumplings, the only thing I did that was different than what many would do is use an egg from one of my hens - other than that I made them just as other people did but mine were full of flavor and could be eaten plain. I disagree that this was a lot of steps - I sauteed everything in the same skillet in stages and it was easy.

This was delicious! I added some spinach to the veg broth which made it a bit more hearty. I would make the dumplings for many other soups and my husband thought they'd make really good dipping appetizers.

markoz91's comments are right on the money -- dice the porcinis and add them into the sautee mix. Can increase the amt of porcinis if you like. I also made the dumplings in the food processor -- puree cottage cheese first, then add to it the other ingredients as instructed, stirring in last addiiton of flour, cheese and parsley by hand. Very good overall, tho a lot of work if done at once.

There are better mushroom soup recipes out there. This was pretty bland and uneventful. The dumplings were so-so. At least I am not afraid to make them now and will search for other dumpling recipes to experiment. It WAS a snowy day today and so I did stay in and make this soup and it was too much work for too little payback. I mean, it didn't take THAT long, but I think if I have to do all the fine tuning others are suggesting then it's just better to go with a different soup recipe.

Because of all the reviews about how bland this soup was, I did make numerous adjustments and it came out amazing. I hope they help some of you guys out! I used boxed vegetable stock and allowed it to simmer with a few thyme sprigs. When sauteing the mushrooms, I also added the chopped porcini mushrooms because they tasted awful right out of the water, but they absorbed wonderful flavor in the wine later on. I did not have sherry so I used about 1/4 cup chardonnay and waited for the liquid to absorb. Onion mixture stayed the same, but I upped the garlic by 1 clove. For the dumplings: I used 1/2 cup whole wheat, 1/2 cup all purpose flour. I added 1/2 cup cheese (1/4c Parmesan, 1/4c provolone), and instead of nutmeg (because I don't like it) I put a pinch each of ground clove and allspice and about 2 teaspoons granulated garlic. Also did not use 3 tablespoons of butter when frying the dumplings- would have been too much. Note: it makes it easier to use wet spoons when handling the dough because it does get sticky. This soup does take a while, but with 30 inches of snow outside, I wasn't going anywhere!! Took about 2.5 hours total. Next time I'm going to add either some heavy cream or fat free half and half because this will make an incredible cream soup!

I followed the directions for mushroom, etc. but then added to some turkey stock that I had. I made the dumplings but, after tasting a sample, added more cheese, added a little cayenne pepper, etc which really helped the taste. The soup was good, the dumplings tasty but heavy. Needs a lot of adjustments.

Do not make this soup. Likely the worst soup I have ever tasted.

This was very good and I did make the veg stock the first day and the soup the second, but this is a LOT of work for soup. If you're trapped inside on a snowy day this is the meal to make. That said, I found it surprisingly filling as a main course for dinner with a salad. The flavors are rich and complex. I liked the dumplings but I did liberally season the batter with salt and pepper.

The soup was delicious. I was skeptical about flavor since the base was vegetable broth. I thought for sure I'd have to add a little beef or chicken broth to enhance the flavor. But the mushrooms and the mushroom soaking liquid did the trick! Delicious, earthy flavor. I agree with the poster who said it has many steps, but if you break it up it helps. I made mine over two days so I wouldn't have to go through all the prep in one day. I also agree with the poster who said the dumplings were bland. Defintiely use the full 3/4 C parsley, the parsely flavor is good if you can taste it. Maybe up the cheese amount? Something to fiddle around with. Also, they seemed a little dense, but I might have overworked my batter. Still, I think next time I might separate the eggs and whip the whites then fold back in. I have two young kids under the age of 3, so I definitely wouldn't take the time to make the recipe if it wasn't worth it. I will absolutely make this again.

Overall, this soup is delicious, although I agree that the dumplings were tasteless. Next time, I will poach one first to test the seasoning.

Made this yesterday & followed the recipe exactly. I found the dumplings to be a pretty tasteless and although I like mushrooms I didn't really like the super-earthy taste the porcini added. Not something I'd make again.

Excellent recipe. I used homemade mushroom stock which made it even tastier. The dumplings were such a great addition.

Wow! Just made this soup and had to give it a great review! It is a bit time consuming if you do all steps at once, but so worth the time. I'll admit, I did forget the cayenne but didn't realize 'til I read another review. So savory, and the dumplings are delicious!

This is a fantastic soup, especially on a cold winter day. Everyone very happily had seconds. This is definately going to become a staple recipe in our house.

I didn't have any porcini mushrooms so I used shitake instead along with the baby bellas and added a small cayenne pepper for a bit of heat. I can't imagine it being any better. We thought the soup was wonderful.
