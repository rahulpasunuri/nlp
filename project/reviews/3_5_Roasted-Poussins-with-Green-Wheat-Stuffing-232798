I would give this 3.5 forks if I could. I was experimenting with this so I only made one bird, but cut everything down. I didn't have any wheat so I made some couscous with raisins and pinenuts, and the other goodies in the stuffing instead. It worked out well. The bird itself cooked perfectly and the jus was just right - the directions worked perfectly. I could see this being a really good center piece for a dinner party or a nice Sunday roast.

This is not your usual review. I needed a stuffing for pork chops and chose the stuffing from this recipe, not the poussin. This stuffing is really good and very different in taste and texture. Not sure the original recipe was ever conceived to be used with pork, but it sure worked well.
