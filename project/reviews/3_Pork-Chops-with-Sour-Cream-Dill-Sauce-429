I have been making this recipe since 95 (17 years). I have always loved the flavors, however I have not found an overly appreciative audience through the years until recently. I decided to make it for my new husband a few months ago. He feels the same way about it that I do. Absolutely fantastic flavors! Tonight I am making it for my in- laws. I hope they feel about it like we do. The only thing I have changed is that I add a teaspoon of hot red peppers to add a little zing. I will never give this recipe up.

Nothing special at all. Not bad but not good.

I think the dill could be optional or traded out for a different flavor. It is really important not to get the sour cream too hot.

This is fairly easy to fix, and is very good. If you like dill you will like this...........AG

I was not impressed with this recipe. Maybe it's just a unique flavor that I didn't care for, but I won't make it again. I added some fresh lemon juice which helped a bit and the pork was tender and juicy. I just didn't like the taste of it.

This was AWESOME! I followed the recipe, although I will try using yogurt or fat-free sour cream next time. For sake of room in the skillet, I removed the pork chops before mixing in the sour cream mixture, and I did not add the flour that the recipe called for. I served it with roasted red potatoes and brussels sprouts - my husband was impressed and I had to assure him that yes, I will make this again!

This came out decent. To prevent separation, try taking the pot completely off the heat and then gently whisk in the sourcream/dill mixture. That way it cooks evenly into the sauce, and the bit of flour the recipie called for added to sour cream does not clump up or disolve unevenly. I added about a cup more of chicken broth, and added some cooking white wine which gave it a nice kick. To season the chops with, I marinated them in worchestershire sauce, crushed black peppercorns, and something called Badia Complete Seasoning...I do not know why, but that seasoning seems to go perfect with anything I put it on (still haven't figured out what's in it..lol).

I was really disappointed in this recipe. By the looks of the ingredients you'd think this would turn out to be wonderful but definitely not. Wouldn't recommend this in the future.

This dish was very good. I made it with 5 medium-sized pork chops, and I have about a cup of sauce left over. I substituted oregano for the marjoram, and I didn't have any caraway so I left it out. I used 1tsp of hot paprika, which gave the sauce a lovely orange color and a bit of warmth. Delicious over egg noodles.

This is a great method for tender, juicy chops with a scrumptious sauce. My hubby was very doubtful about the addition of sour cream and dill at the end, so I divided the sauce at that point and left those ingredients out of his half. Final opinion? I liked his plain sauce better than the half with sour cream and dill. Normally, I love dill, but just felt it didn't add a thing to this recipe. I'll definitely make it again, but will stick to the plainer version.

Wonderful meal. Only thing, it needed more pork chops or less suace. My whole family liked it. Even my three year old.

My husband has requested that we have this recipe at least once a week! I left out the caraway as I did not have it on hand and it tasted fine. I also added capers. Next time, I think I'll heed suggestions to add mustard and white wine.

Excellent. Wouldn't change a thing.

Pretty good. My wife doesn't like dill and she loved it. I like sour cream, but I'll omit it next time and try something different. Went well with green beans sauteed in garlic and olive oil, but next time I'll try simmering the beans with the meat before the sour cream step so they can soak up all that sauteed-garlic-and-onion goodness.

I loved this recipe, my husband hated it. Next time I'll make it without the sour cream part of the sauce, just use the broth to cook the pork chops in, hopefully he'll eat it that way. If you don't love sour cream, you probably won't like it.

This dish came out very nice, and it was very easy to make. Like a number of the other reviews, we used white wine instead of chicken broth. I also increased the dill by 1/2 tbsp. My only complaint is that I would have liked more sauce, for the egg noodles I served the pork chops with. Will definitely make again!

Was ok but nothing to write home about.

Good way to prepare the sirloin cut of pork chops. I used hot Hungarian paprika plus a pinch of cayenne to give it a kick. Be sure to reduce the sauce enough. Also, a sprinkle of finely chopped scallions or fresh green herbs just before serving gives the earthy dish a brightening touch.

This is THE recipe for the most tender, juicy, yummy pork chops. Made as directed with the exception of substituting white wine for the broth and it turned out wonderful. Easy to make - even for a weeknight meal. Will definitely make again!

One of the BEST Pork Chop recipes ever. I have also made this recipe substituting white wine for the chicken broth, also very very good.

I would skip the chicken broth and use a zinfandel instead. Worked well. I used 1/2 yogurt and 1/2 fresh cream as well as fresh herbs. Home made flat noodles accompanied this dish. Also fresh green beans.

Big, big disapointment. A lot of effort for very poor results. Followed the recipe to the letter and think a can of mushroom soup would have worked better. Appearance and taste were disapointing.

I really enjoyed this dish and so did my husband who normally does not care for pork. I added some dijon mustard as some others had recommended. The flavor of the dill was mild and next time I will add some extra dill. I seved it on a bed of egg noodles with some of the sauce added to the noodles and then topped them with the pork and a little more of the sauce. My family will enjoy this one again.(Even my kids liked it!)

very good dish. I was surprised. Fresh herbs make all of the difference, and do not try to spoil this dish as others have by using fat free sour cream. ( and dried herbs!)

Rating: 2
Was disappointed. The addition of flour on the meat and in the sour cream is unnecessary and tends to make it gummy. The taste of dill did not enhance the flavor as I thought it would. It seemed to have a flat taste, and would probably benefit from some white wine reduced in the sauce or possibly dijon mustard added with the sour cream. Unfortunately, not a keeper.

Very tasty dish. Found there was too much sauce. Next time would cut the sour cream in half. Pork chops were tender and sauce a nice compliment. Served with potato pancakes.

This was quick and easy, and a nice change from my usual pork chop methods. I added just a touch of mustard also, and it came out quite well. A keeper for rushed evenings!

Having never been a fan of pork chops, I must say this recipe was the answer to a prayer. I found it a few years ago but do not make it that often. It is a dish to be made when we're tired of the same old thing. In sharing it with friends the review has always been favorable.

I found this recipe rather disappointing. While the meat was very tender, the texture of the sauce was not what I expect, and the overall flavor was not particularly balanced. I did wind up using dried dill and non-fat sour cream, which may have biased my results, but still--not a keeper. Sorry.

Huge hit at my dinner party. Best pork chops I've ever made, very tender and juicy. Served with stuffed(herb & garlic cheese,sour cream,butter) potatoes, Green bean and red onion salad with Radish dressing, and cranberry tart for dessert.

We found this to be a wonderfully rich and juicy way to enjoy pork. While not our typical Monday evening meal, it was a great taste test prior to serving it to friends on a relaxed Saturday nite.

My children love this (ages 1 & 10 ) I used just a little caraway ( I don't like it if it is to overpowering) Noodle are a must to serve the sauce over. Next time I think I will cut the pork into strips to make it easier for the kids.

I've made this recipe several times. I omitted the caraway seeds and reduced the sour cream by half. You can substitute chicken for pork. Try to use fresh dill. It makes a big difference in flavor.

I have 2 small children and it was a litte too involved and rich for them. I would recommend it to be served to adults in a gourmet environment.
