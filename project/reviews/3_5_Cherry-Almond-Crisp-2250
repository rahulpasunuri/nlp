I usually make this once per summer (once because it is a lot of cherries to pit) and everyone loves it. Though it can be difficult to find the canned cherries in water to add to the recipe, usually I am able to find them. They're much better than using the ones in syrup or canned pie filling cherries. I also double the topping because my family loves that part. There is never any leftover when I make this.

Love this recipe versus the normal canned cherry pie filling. Really good.

Delicious! My grocery store didn't have the canned cherries in water, so I substituted cans of lite red cherry pie filling in place and omitted the tapioca. I was also more generous with the almond extract and kirsch, and doubled the topping as others suggested. Everyone loved it, it will be my new summer staple dessert!

This was a hit with my boyfriend!! Vanilla ice cream made it even better.I will make it for thanksgiving this year...something a little different instead of pecan or pumpkin pie. I will also double the amount of "crisp" in the recipe.

Don't they mean fresh cherries OR canned? Seems like a lot of cherries for the amount of other ingredients and why would you use canned if you had fresh? Just curious.

Even if you are not a fruit crisp nut like me, you will find this Oh so EASY & GOOD. If you like cherries, you'll LOVE this one. I will freeze some cherries this summer to make it during the cold winter months.

Very delicious! I substituted pecans, and doubled the amount of topping (isn't the topping the reason that we make crisp??). Served with Haagen Dazs vanilla ice cream. All in all, a big hit.

This recipe is wonderful! Very easy to make and a hit with everyone who has tried it. I'll make this instead of cherry pie from now on.

This pie was a hit at our family reunion (good thing I made two pies). It was easy and the aroma coming from the stove was wonderful. I plan to make two more for the church homecoming.

Yum! I made it with thawed sour pie cherries that I'd pitted and frozen last summer, and increased the sugar.

Wonderful desert. We've made it three times during the prolific bing cherry season and everyone loves it. Have frozen some of the bing cherries so we can make this again in the future.
