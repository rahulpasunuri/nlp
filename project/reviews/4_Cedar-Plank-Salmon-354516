Delicious. Certainly my favorite recipe. I hate how Epicurious won't let us update photos....so below you'll find a picture of my latest salmon cooked as above. http://img825.imageshack.us/img825/1705/imagedfv.jpg

Yummy!

I've made this many times. As written it's fabulous and the combination of lemon zest and rosemary to mimic the fir needles the Salish would use is extraordinary. This is supposed to have a sort of "pine-y" flavor. I've also used lime zest instead with good results. I've used both the honey and the maple syrup. The difference is subtle. The maple syrup adds another woodsy note to the flavor, but with the cedar plank on the grill you get that anyway. I've used Dijon instead of grainy mustard, and I might like Dijon better. But any time I've made this, as written or with the subs I mentioned, it's turned out excellent. I'm out of cedar planks; next time I'm going to try mesquite chips in with the charcoal.

This is our new go-to salmon recipe. It's easy and really delicious. I have a life time supply of fresh rosemary and am always looking for ways to use it. I've tried it with both the maple syrup and the honey and like them both. I think the honey adds a bit more sweetness but I couldn't swear by it. It could have been the salmon that time. Either way, this is a keeper.

I made this for the first time yesterday, used honey and dried rosemary - couldn't find fresh. My adult kids said it was restaurant worthy!! High compliments from them, as they can be very picky eaters!!!!! Will definitely make it again and again and again ....

Great flavor in this recipe. Turns out I had neither honey or maple syrup, but being in Arizona, I had agave nectar. Wow, what a great switch! I have since tried it with honey and prefer my switch. That, and you really want to use a big thick fresh wild caught salmon. The first time I made this I used a 2" thick fatty fillet and it was decadently good. A great char from the extra time on the grill due to the thickness, and the unctuous goodness of fresh wild caught salmon, and I have been chasing the dragon ever since with my salmon eating.

I enjoyed the smokey flavor from plank grilling, but I think next time I will go with some kind of a ginger/soy marinade. I didn't love the maple syrup.

Suprisingly good. I used maple syrup and salmon with the skin cut off. I added salt and pepper. I felt like it really brightened the flavor of the salmon.

I made this for 6 of our friends and it was a huge hit! I used the maple syrup not the honey and it was wonderful! I will definitely make this again!

Outstanding!!

OMG this is so good. I have made it as written several times, and this time used orange zest instead of lemon. Beyond good! I use cedar paper (flat) instead of plank, I think the fish cooks better. add a little extra salt and pepper over the glaze before grilling.

Awesome recipe!!! A perfect balance of sweet, tangy and citrus. I didn't change a thing. cedar planks are nice too because the grill doesn't get dirty :) I bought mine from Sur La Table for $3.

We call this "crack salmon" in our house. Yum! It does well on skinless salmon as well, in which case I usually coat all sides of the salmon.

I hadn't made this for a couple years and after making it for friends last night, I can't imagine why. It was so moist, so tasty, and so easy! One diner not known for over complimenting put down his fork and said "Superb!" I may make it again this weekend.

I made this for my wife last night. She is a salmon nut, but only likes it certain ways. This is now one of those ways. This was also my first attempt at plank grilling and I found it easy and flame free. I enjoyed the contrast-sweet/tangy of the maple syrup/mustard glaze. As a side we enjoyed the Grilled Asparagus recipe from this site. Excellent meal.

This is outstanding! Have made this a ton and am always thrilled with how easy it is. One tip is to soak the plank for a good 6 or more hours, it will really bring up the taste of the plank which just adds a whole other fantatic addition to the flavor. A great dish for when company comes, takes very little effort and always a hit.

Simple and divine! I would be just as blissed out if I used half the maple syrup in the future but everyone I made it for loved it as is.

I made this recipe for my Grandfather's 84th birthday party, and all ten attendees (some of whom are notoriously picky eaters) raved about it. I used honey, and added a bit more rosemary and lemon zest than was called for. This is my new go-to salmon recipe.

This was exceptional! The most "refined" palate at the table said, "I think this is the best salmon I have ever had." I did use wild salmon that I got in Costco, grade B syrup and maybe a little extra lemon zest.

I love this recipe. I use the honey and it is always great, I add more lemon zest and rosemary though, also used Grey Poupon and loved that! Made for a party of 50 last weekend grilled the prior day and served chilled, MMMM! Rave reviews!

Came out great! After reading other reviews, I used 1/2 the amount of syrup and there was only a hint of sweetness. It took 20-25 minutes for my larger (1 inch or more thick) piece of fish to cook. And despite soaking my plank for 3 hours, it still caught on fire -- nothing that couldn't be controlled with a spray bottle of water. I can't wait to repeat this (wish salmon wasn't so $$).

Followed other cooks' suggestion and use the maple syrup, grade B, and it is always delicious. Best with the cedar plank, but not necessary. Oh, and it also works with lime, or even a splash of orange juice if you don't have lemon on hand.

After reading reviews, I halved the amount of maple syrup I used in the recipe. It was still a little too sweet for my family, and it over-powered the salmon (it's salmon season, so our salmon is usually pretty good). I would try it again with a smaller ratio of sauce to salmon and maybe cut out the syrup all together. Otherwise, it was a very easy dish to prepare.

I followed the recipe and all four people at the dinner table had the same reaction: "ewwwww." We tried to salvage the salmon by scraping off the overly sweet sauce, but the damage had been done.

Sometimes the simplest of recipes make the best dishes. Here, I used maple syrup instead of honey (I was out of honey), but otherwise made exactly to spec. The salmon turned out perfectly and everyone raved about the marinade. Simple, simple, simple, but so so good.

big huge grin here - i love this dish. whether its because i'm a biased canadian or the fact that this is truly one of them most flavourful and easy dishes to prepare - who knows, who cares. give it a go. collateral bonus? your house will smell like fabulous fresh cedar for a day or 2!

One of the best things I've ever fixed from this site--and I've loved a lot of them. I fixed this for a dinner party for eight and got raves. This from several people who always try to outdo one another. Truly spectacular. Moist and incredibly flavorful.

I was amazed how easy this was and sooo tasty. I followed the recipe to the letter, but I made sure to put my plank on the grill for 3 minutes and then I flipped it and added the salmon for 15 minutes. I let it rest for 5 minutes and it was wonderful.

This recipe is delicious, easy to make and beautiful. I was unable to obtain a cedar grilling plank and made it over a gas grill with huge success amongst my guests. I should mention that the salmon took a bit more than 13 to 15 minutes to cook following the cooks' note procedure.

Great recipe- fast and delicious. I cooked over an open charcoal (campsite) grill, without a cover, so the cooking time was much longer. Divine!

I used the honey and had lime zest on hand so went with that. Also, only had dijon mustard. It was still delicious! I had a thicker fillet, so had to cook for longer. Definitely an easy recipe that has fantastic taste!

I used whole grain dijon, maple syrup and Sockeye salmon for this recipe. My husband is a maple syrup junkie, but we both felt this was too sweet. Maybe we would have preferred the honey, or maybe a blend of mustards -- like Grey Poupon Country Dijon + some of the wholegrain. Either way, we felt the deliciousness of the cedar was masked by the syrupy sweetness of the topping in this rendition.

This recipe is obscenely good. I've literally made it three times in the space of two weeks...once with halibut instead of salmon. I think the maple syrup option is the best, personally...and, if possible, get some nice, dark, grade B syrup...adds more complexity and richness to the flavor.

Very good and easy to prepare. Really, 3&1/2 forks. Have made many a plank salmon in the past and this is so simple to throw together at the last minute. Good company fare.

Wow!! Excellent, easy preparation! I used the maple syrup!

Ok, this recipe is the bomb! A great entertaining recipe, very little work and time involved.The plank is great for the presentation,we just served it straight to the table. We found that it did take longer to cook as well, ended up turning the burners underneath onto low to speed it up a bit, didn't seem to burn the wood at all, but then we gave it a good long soak. This recipe is a defenite keeper!

Amazing combination of flavors. I did this in the oven by putting the blank over a broiler pan. Had to stick it under the broiler for a little while because it took a bit longer than expected but this crisped up some of the skin and worked well.

Excellent recipe. Wouldn't change a thing. Used wild salmon from Costco and maple syrup.

Made this for friends last night (with the maple syrup) it was terrific! Obviously, having good (i.e., wild and fresh) salmon helps but the topping was delicious. Definitely worth repeating.

OK. There are not enough forks. I need special allowance to give this an eleven fork rating. I followed the recipe exactly, using the maple syrup option, and I would not change anything except for the fact that it is gone, because we couldn't stop eating it. I assume that since this is a cooking site I am not supposed to use sexual references to describe things, so I will close here. You must have this salmon and then you will know what I mean!

This was delicious. My husband and I grill together - I prepare and he attends the grill. It was easy and very yummy. Will definitely make again. This time I used maple syrup and I will try honey next time to taste the difference. Our farmers' market fresh wild-caught salmon certainly made it even more wonderful I am sure.
