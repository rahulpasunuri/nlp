I served the salad dressing over red leaf lettuce and frisee. I substituted toasted sliced almonds from Trader Joe's for the hazelnuts and used Hop Kiln Toasted Walnut Grapeseed Oil. The taste was phenomenal with the fresh ginger and balsamic. The whole dish was company good--delicate tasting scallops and bean puree. I cooked my own beans from dried and used sage and garlic with the water. Delicious!

I used the vinaigrette as a 'dressing' for a potato pizza that was just simple: spelt pizza dough, potato slices, red onion, crumbled feta and thyme. I then put greens on the pizza slices (all kinds of lettuce) and finally this vinaigrette. Very good combination

This is my 'go to' recipe when I want to impress someone. It truly is wonderful...I make the beans from scratch and use my sister's homegrown hazelnuts. It is to die for.

My whole family loved this dish. Having been a resident of Charlestown (home of Olives) I was anxious to try the recipie. I didn't have rosemary so I used sage in the white bean puree and thought it was wonderful on its own and with the scallops. The scallops were quite large and looked lovely on top of the puree, especially with the hazlenut vinegarette. I garnished with little sprigs of fresh thyme poking out from the center of four scallops. Even my father, who gives every recipie a score of OK said I had outdone myself. I'll be making this again!

Twhite bean puree is delicious! It was great as a side dish and I even used it as a mayonnaise-type substitute for meat loaf sandwiches. Very very good. I didn't care for the scallop recipe at all, I'm afraid.

I liked the sauce but I did not think that the white bean puree was a very good match with the dish. Both the sauce and the puree are very complex in flavors and they clash. I would make the sauce again but accompany the scallops with steamed Jasmine rice, for example.

This was fabulous! Even our boys loved it. A keeper! Be sure to make the accompanying white bean puree, too.
