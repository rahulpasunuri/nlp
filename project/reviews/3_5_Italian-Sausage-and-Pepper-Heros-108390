Why would you suggest to prick the sausages. That is letting all the moisture escape.

Very easy to prepare. I cooked the sausage on top of the stove instead of the broiler, cutting them after 10 minutes or so and cooking through in halves. The family loved it! It rivals some of the best sausage and pepper I've had at feasts and BBQ's. It is definitely a keeper.

I used mild italian sausage ground, browned. Added Asiago cheese to pepper and onion mixture after cooking and then combined the sausage into this. Served over focaccia bread. I used Focaccia bread warmed in the oven. Family loved it. Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Italian-Sausage-and-Pepper-Heros-108390#ixzz130RZWE2C

We cooked the sausage on the grill. It was quick and easy and a nice alternative to hot dogs and burgers for a BBQ.

Love this recipe. It is easy, fast and everyone enjoys it. I add 3 Tblsp. of balsamic vinegar halfway through cooking the pepper/onion mixture and then 1 cup of tomato sauce and the halved sausages at the very end until heated through. Always a hit in the summer when grilling and during football season. Enjoy.

Made this for two of my friends, and they gave it two thumbs up! We used some toasted hot dog buns instead of the italian bread, and the sausages tasted superb topped with some dijon mustard.

Good. Easy and quick week-night meal. Added extra garlic and crused red pepper. Also sprinkled with balsamic vinegar.

Great recipe. I recommend starting the sausage before the peppers since it takes longer than 10-12 minutes.

We have been making this recipe for years, using hot and sweet sausage interchangably or together. This time used both and followed the given version. Used the grill instead of the broiler due to the summer heat (air conditioning bills, y'know). Came out great. We sometimes add tomatoes (Jersey, of course) and mozz. or provolone cheese. In winter, when the tomatoes are anemic and sad, you can use jarred tomato sauce for extra flavor if you like. Always a hit, and easy for a barbeque or casual party.

Sausage and Peppers without a red sauce...hmmm. However, my husband commented every time I would make our family recipe, what about the mustard? This was the perfect answer. Our family enjoyed the dish, including our 5 year old. We will be sure to keep this in our list of recipes - great for late Sunday afternoon football.
