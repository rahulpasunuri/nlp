Love this recipe and have made it numerous times. I cut the cumin amount in half, add more chicken broth and omit the cilantro.

This was great as written. The cumin and chilli powder amounts were perfect. Didn't find them dominating at all. Served with salmon and the lime butter sauce from this site. I used long grain brown rice in this recipe and cooked it for the hour on low.Excellent!

Wonderful taste and flavours. I agree with the cumin, but I served it with homemade flautas and it was perfect. The colors really add to the presentation.

I love this rice! It makes way too much as stated in the recipe so I always just make half...and still have leftovers! I only add half of the recommended cumin..otherwise I think it's way too much. You can add peas or corn for added color/texture. I served with grilled chicken, black beans, southwestern caesar salad, and corn bread. Yummy!!

I made this as a side for roast duck along with some steamed broccoli and it was simple, lovely and prefectly matched. I agree with a previous comment that one needs to be thoughtful when pairing pilaf as a side dish. Generally, I think roasted poultry & broiled fish dishes are best-suited. This recipe makes a lot of pilaf. In the past I have made fried rice with leftover pilaf; a great idea for a 2nd weekday meal!

Ok - but not worth making again. I normally like cumin and chili powder, but didn't particularly like these spices in this rice dish. There are many better rice dishes I'd rather eat/serve.

This is a DELICIOUS rice dish. I made it several nights ago, and it lived on again tonight as leftovers. I had originally divided the recipe in half to make 4 servings, but it made more like 6. For my half recipe I did add 3/4 cup of frozen corn kernels. The night I originally made this I served it with BBQ'd chicken leg 1/4's, and the delicate flavor of the rice dish was overpowered by the BBQ sauce. Tonight I served leftovers with "Pan-Roasted Veal Chops With Arugula" (also on this site) and the combo of the two recipes made for a delicious meal. Be careful what you serve this with. My husband raved over tonight's dinner!!!

I wanted a dish to compliment both grilled salmon and grilled steak. I made this dish for Father's Day and am more than pleased that I did. My family loved it. I used a whole stick of butter and four cans of chicken broth, because the recipe calls for so much rice. Like other reviewers, I stirred constantly because I was afraid it was going to burn. The finished product is colorful, with a great taste. I gave my first print of the recipe to my son who loved the dish, and e-mailed it to a few close friends :). I can't wait to make again.

This is a very colourful and pretty pilaf. I halved the chili powder and cumin and found it still came pretty close to overpowering the shrimp dish I served it with. I agree with Ottawa's suggestion to omit the spices completely.

This is definitely one of the best rice side dishes that I have made. When I made it for my friends & I the first time, we couldn't believe how something so easy and simple could be so good.

I was looking for a good recipe to use my leftover peppers and onions. This was not great. Not much flavor, and not worth the effort. I halved the recipe, maybe it turns out better if you use the full recipe.

Despite all the previous rave reviews, I was extremely disappointed in this dish. The rice was hard (even with added broth) and all I could taste was the cumin. I took about three bites and then threw away the rest.

My boyfriend and I tried making this last weekend and it was absolutely wonderful! We made it again this weekend! It makes quite a large portion, so I halved everything except the cilantro, which I love!

Excellent dish! I omitted the spices, so it can be served with just about anything. The cooking time is much less than noted in the recipe though - check on it after about 18 minutes so as not to overcook.

Very good--and makes a lot! It was quick and easy too. I unfortunately didn't have cilantro so omitted it but it was still good. It cooked much more quickly than the time stated. Received compliments from picky BIL.

Wow, I read all the ingredents and didn't think this could be much, I was wrong, it was incredibly easy to make and really good!

I wanted a colorful dish for a buffet and this fit the bill perfectly. It was very tasty, easy to make, and reheated wonderfully.

I have made this pilaf on several occasions and have always been pleased with the results, although I always halve the recipe when cooking for just the two of us. It's sooo easy and dependable. Last night, I served it with grilled chicken kebobs and the flavors were MARVELOUS together - we used an old standby marinade with soysauce, honey, red wine vinegar, oil and herbs. I highly recommend the menu!

Have made this often. Everybody always loves it! Makes lots, but never have had a problem having the leftovers, just turn it into a new meal with chicken added to it or whatever is around. Its a predictable tasty dish and it looks great!

Excellent dish, would defitnately make it again, the whole family loved it.

This was a great tasing rice. The spices were just enough. I wouldn't change a thing. I added frozen peas at the end of cooking time for added color. Any vegtables would add a nice variation. This recipe does make a lot of rice. As a side dish I had so much leftover. I may grill chicken and/or shrimp and create another whole meal. This was certainly a favorite rice recipe.
