I really liked these - I used mostly brown sugar and added cinnamon for an extra kick. They came out well, moist, no burning. I would definitely make again. Next time I'll try one of the variations here.

FANTASTIC! I used peppermint in place of vanilla and added a candy cane hershey's kiss to the top of each cookie. They became an instant holiday tradition.

I was very excited when I saw the recipe for these cookes as I wanted a chocolate cookie like, NOW. I got busy & put all the ingred together, made them exactly as written including the baking time. What a disappointment! They were flat, too salty (even tho I used unsalted butter) and a few were burned even tho I baked them on parchment paper. Airy, salty & burned edges are not what I call a good recipe.

I was excited to try making these. I'm a little disappointed with them, though. Mine turned out flat and cakey, not puffed up or anything. Next time I make these, I'll use baking powder instead of soda to try and get them to rise.

These are great! After reading some of the reviews I baked for only 8 minutes an they come out light, delicate and melt in your mouth around the edges and moist and slightly chewy on the inside. Delicious. They would be great for homemade ice cream sandwiches.

YUM!! Super fudgy/ chocolatey. Added 1/4 (rough) cup milk choco chips to melted butter; added some more to finished batter. Made them small and cooked for 6 minutes. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't have a problem with them burning at all.

Listening to the reviewers problems with burnt bottoms, I made sure to cook these on my air cookie sheet (is chambered so the radiant heat from below does not hit the cooking surface) and set my alarm for 11 minutes instead of 12... I waiting 30 seconds after the alarm went off and then pulled them out. They came out that near perfect combination of crispy/chewy. I add 1 cup of crushed Emerald Dark Cocoa Almonds to the recipe (I like my cookies with STUFF).

Other reviewers are right: these do burn easily and get ruined. BUT if you get it right, they are the best chocolate cookies EVER. To make mine soft and chewy, I use 1 stick of butter and 1/4 cup Crisco shortening. Then I add a 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and half a cup of chopped Dove dark chocolate promises. I scoop and freeze dough balls after the two-hour chill. I take them out of the oven right after they've puffed, and they turn out moist, chewy, chocolately and very satisfying--almost brownie-like.

These were very easy to make and came out delicious! They were easy to burn but only a tiny ring around the outside burned on a couple of my cookies but they were still good. Very chocolatey and delicious!

I followed the recipe EXACTLY and the cookies turned out very cakey and not very chocolatey....am going to keep looking for a good chocolate cookies recipe...

Warning! It is extremely easy to burn these cookies on the bottom. I just wasted half a tin of expensive cocoa on these, so make sure you check them early, and don't make the mistake i did and put them it for one more minute...it could ruin them. Hate to be the voice of dissent, but not an easy recipe for me and I very rarely write bad reviews.

Rating: 3
The first batch I made I may have left for 13 minutes instead of 12 and they burnt on the bottom. They also tasted a little dry. Then again the butter wasn't mushy when I added it. The second batch was must better. I left them in for 10 minutes or less. They are still a little dry though. Any recommendations to make them less dry?

Rating: 4
Holy moley those are some good cookies! I am not sure how some previous reviewers ended up with "cakelike" cookies, mine were as chewy and perfectly cookie-ish as one could ask for. I followed the recipe with the following adaptations: I used 1/2 dark brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, added 1/2 bag of white chocolate chips and 2 regular-sized bags of M & M's (what I had on hand!), I refrigerated the dough for a few hours (I recommend always doing this with cookie dough) and I baked for a bit less than the recipe calls for (about 10 minutes). If you find that cookies aren't coming out as perfectly chewy as you'd like, a great tip is to cream the heck out of the butter and sugar before mixing in any other ingrediants, then add the eggs and beat till light and fluffy again. But really, REALLY cream that butter and sugar.

I would give these cookies about a 2.5. The texture of these cookies were very cakey and not what I expected. I let my butter sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes before using it in this recipe. The cookies came out pretty flat. With the cakey texture and the flatness of these cookies they were a bit on the delicate side. Im not sure how some of the reviewers were able to use them for ice cream sandwiches. I took the advice of others and did half brown, half regular sugar. I added Gittard mint chips which I thought was an excellent touch. If I were to try this recipe again, I would either use cold butter to prevent some of the spreading or place the batter in the fridge for 10 minutes before baking. Another note, the recipe indicates UNgreased pan, not greased pan as someone indicated on their review. Overall not as chocolaty as I would have liked and the not chewy, not crispy, but cake like texture of the cookie left something to be desired.

As others have commented, these are very easy and turn out great. It's the perfect little recipe for when you say, "I want something chocolate..."

Of the many baking recipies I have tried, this is the most fool proof, not to mention delicious! I tried adding ingredients to the countless batches I have made such as oatmeal, banana and peanut butter, and they all turned out amazing. Everyone who I served these cookies to loved them.

YUM!!!! Quick, easy and idiotproof- I have problems with cookies and these were perfect, I did add 1 cup mini choco chips - what I had on hand. I got 2 1/2 doz. 10 baking time was perfect. Start to finish under 45 min. You won't regret these. I am thinking about making "mini" ice cream sandwiches with these....hmmmmm

I have made these many times and always add a cup of dark chocolate chips. Underbake them slightly. They are delicious. I also freeze them unbaked on a cookie sheet after formed and then put them into a freezer bag once hard. Just bake a few or as many as you need. I found a bag with a few of them in the bottom of the freezer once that could have bee a year old. Baked them up and viola terrific.

these are so delicious as is, but especially so with some mint-flavored chocolate chips mixed in. they're like chewy luxurious girl scout cookies!

These cookies are amazing. So light and fluffy and do require milk to drink along with each cookie. They came out perfect out of the oven, nice and round. I added 1/2 bag of semisweet white chocolate morsals and it made them to die for.

These were soooo tasty! I added some semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter and sprinkled the tops with some crushed peppermint candy canes before baking for our Christmas cookie swap. They looked very festive and were a huge hit with the kids. I baked them for nine minutes on parchment paper.

Hersey's cocoa just didn't cut it. Even though I added about 3/4 C. each high quality dark chocolate chips and a combination of walnuts and pecans, I still was not wowed by the cookie. Had no problem with the texture or the spreading issues that others had. I used some what cold butter and did not greese the pan. Also, I made the cookies about twice the size - but still baked for same amount of time - turned out perfect. The texture was perfect - sort of a combination of cookie, cake and brownie. Also, some people may have had problems with spreading if they forgot to add the baking soda. All in all, cookies were very dark in color and very rich, but they just were not very interesting. Although...considering how easy it was...I can imagine, if one were not very discerning, one would likely be entirely content - with the recipe as is, so long as spreading or burning did not occur. The next time I make these, if there is a next time, I'll use a better quality cocao powder. This is the only thing that might make a difference. If that still doesn't give them more of a WOW factor, then it will be the last time I make them.

I thought these cookies were delicious, and very easy to make. I like larger cookies so I doubled the recipe. The cooking time worked for my larger cookies so i would probably shorten the time with the size they state. The recipe itself would be three forks, but I added large chunks of Callebaut semi-sweet and white chocolates along with some coursely chopped nuts!!! That made it a 4-forker for me.

Rating: 1
Gross. I don't know what went wrong, I am an experienced baker, I used unsalted butter, not too soft, good cocoa & I followed recipe except to add 1 cup of chocolate chips & nuts each. The cookies were thin, salty & greasy. I'm glad so many people were successful with this recipe but this will not be a repeat for me.

This recipe is great and very easy, but only bake for 7 minutes or you will get blackened cookies. My first batch burned at 10 minutes. I added a combo of peanut butter and chocolate chips, yummy.

Rating: 4
Exquisite!! I used a gluten-free all purpose flour and it didn't effect the taste in the slightest! I even left out the vanilla (didn't have any). They were moist, light, fluffy, not too sweet, with delicately crisp edges. I threw in some dark chocolate/espresso candy bar chunks and used organic dark chocolate cocoa powder. Baked about 10 minutes and they were the best cookies I've ever made!!

Rating: 3
these cookies were awesome! I added chopped walnuts and dried cranberries which added nice texture and flavor. 9 mins in the oven is perfect. don't melt the butter and they'll come out great- like a super rich (but not too sweet) cookie/brownie. YUM!!

These were ok, but the flavor was a little boring, and I really felt they needed something, so I drizzled melted mint chocolate on them which helped a lot.

It is delicious. Not too sweet and very chocolatey. I love them same as my husband. I decreased the time to 9-10 min and don't grease the baking sheets. It turns out to be great. I also added some dried cranberries and walnuts in the cookies mix and on the top of cookies. It looks very good and taste great, too.

I wish I could give 2.5 forks--they're okay. They definitely taste nice enough, but I just don't think they're special enough on their own to warrant using that much of my organic cocoa powder. I think their taste and texture would be PERFECT for ice cream sandwiches (mine came out firm yet still a bit chewy and easy to bite through, with a nice crisp to the edges). I added a bit of espresso powder to the dough (which I would do again but I don't think is necessary) and I also refrigerated the dough for about 15 minutes before dropping 1-inch scoops onto my cookie sheet with a cookie scoop. I think this helped prevent some of the excessive spreading other reviewers mentioned (they definitely still spread, but not in a way that made me think there was anything wrong). I would make them again, but not own their own.

This makes a delicious and tender cookie--just the thing for when you have a chocolate craving. I also increased the sugar to 1.25 cups and I decreased the time to 9-10 min. I think part of why mine were so tasty and popular was because I used a high-quality cocoa. I don't think Hershey's would cut it for this .

Rating: 3
I thought this was a delicious cookie, it almost tastes like a piece of cake. It's fluffy, chocolaty, and easy to make. I added a handful of raisins to the recipe. yum. The cookie isn't very sweet so I think I'll make it with a glaze next time. I reduced the time to 10 minutes and used cold butter.

Rating: 4
These are so good! And addictive! My normally easygoing daughter has temper tantrums when I cut her off. They're easy to make and easy to revise. I don't know why the other reviewers had problems, but like all cookies, results can vary from batch to batch depending on how you handle the ingredients. I've made them a couple times with different results but they were still excellent every time. It's not a "dish beyond compare" but it's DELICIOUS- I gave it 4 forks cuz I feel like it deserves a better rating than it has now.

Rating: 4
DELICIOUS! light, rich, fluffy, moist, soft, YUMMMY! I added three bittersweet chocolate chips to the top of each one. They added a nice touch. Don't overbake them- I checked them at 9 minutes and they were beautifully done. Great recipe!

These flattened slightly from the large drops, but were still fluffy and light. After reading other reviews, I decided to keep the butter cold, whipping it with the sugar when it was easy to cut into chunks, but by no means warm. I even put it back in the fridge after whipping and before adding the eggs. Like some other users, I used half brown sugar. These cookies were so chocolatey. I wanted to eat them all, but they were also incredibly rich. Like little cakes.

Rating: 3
I added 1/2 teaspoon of peppermint extract and reduced baking time to 8-10 minutes, and most of my cookies turned out great. I had a few spread like some of the other comments said, but I think I had a few globs of unblended butter in those ones. Overall, very good- soft and chocolatey!

Rating: 3
I don't know if I can honestly say I made this recipe the first time, because I added a tsp more vanilla, 1/8 c instant coffee concentrate, half a bag of white choc chips, and half a bag of dark choc. chips. I had my doubts about the dough... ...but it came out great and none of the first pan made it as far as the cookie jar!

Mine were good and had good texture. they were very simple to make (I doubled the recipe and used 1/2brown1/2granulated sugar). I'd do it again and maybe add some whitechoco chips for color. or I bet they'd be good with a hint of mint.

These cookies turned out flat as a pancake. I used organic pastry flour instead of all-purpose flour, but I don't think that made much of a difference in the texture, judging by the comments of the other reviewers. These cookies tasted good, and I added slivered almonds, but the unpleasant texture was hard to overcome. I wouldn't make these again.

Rating: 3
The first cookie sheet I made of these wound up burning on the bottom, I think it was because I followed the recipe and greased the cookie sheet which I don't normally do. I covered the cookie sheet with parchment paper for the rest and they turned out fine. The dough was sticky, but no more difficult to work with than a peanut butter or molasses cookie dough. The cookies didn't have much spread to them, they were basically still somewhat ballish coming out of the oven, but that was fine by me! If anyone else has ever lived in Montreal (or the rest of Canada? I'm not sure) and had two-bite brownies, these are very similar, nice soft, crumbly texture, very chocolatey and browni-like.

Don't know what happened with these, they ended up being crunchy pancakes -- not sure if my oven was too high, or what, but they melted into puddles on the cookie sheet and turned crispy. They taste pretty good, but I'll have to make again to see what went wrong. Fortunately, they were easy to make....

Rating: 4
Not sure why other reviewers reported "runny" dough. Possibly, they microwaved their butter to soften it or...? anyways, just set the butter out for 15 minutes before you start the recipe and this will make a great dough- a sticky consistency- and DARN GOOD! The cookies are great too, they come out of the oven looking like they were burnt crisp- they are SO chocolatey dark. I added chocolate chips for a little extra- nuts next time. Make these.

I've made this recipe a few times, to rave reviews each time. It pays to use dutch or european process cocoa powder, and the freshest ingredients you can. These have always turned out almost brownie-like for me.

I used this recipe (with some added cinnamon and cointreau) to make chocolate mint sandwich cookies and won a cookie contest at my company. They are rather delicate and cakey, but the flavor is really yummy. I took my inspiration for the mint filling from the previous reviewer who made oreos. I just added some peppermint extract to the mix. Got rave reviews!

These cookies are simply horrible. They're not chocolatey at all, and they come out of the oven either not cooked or rock hard.

This was one of the first times I was disappointed by a recipe on Epicurious. The cookies taste good, but they turned out very, very thin despite the cakey texture, and the edges were almost lacy. And after a few days, it is hard to get them out of the cookie jar without them breaking. I don't know where I went wrong.

I made these for the express purpose of trying to create homemade "oreo: cookies. The batter is very dark and chocolatey. It worked! easy recipe with great results! Now, I'm working on the filling... :) So far, the best filling results are with confectioners sugar, a little vanilla and some cream made into a thick frosting. It dries just like the filling!

A very nice and simple cookie. Chocolatey enough for us!

The best thing about these cookies is that this is a good basic recipe that you can add to easily...I baked the first batch "as is" and found that 12 min at 375 was too high - the bottoms got burned. To the remaining batter I added tart dried cherries and chopped almonds, and reduced the baking time to 8 minutes at 350 which was much better. The plain cookies would make a good cookie for homemade ice cream sandwiches.

These cookies were ok, but not dark enough for me (I like very dark chocolate). They were simple to make, but nothing to write home about.

WHAT A TREAT- the batter came out a little thin and cake like- so I poured it into a pan and baked it like a brownie with dark chocolate chips- and I think I stumbled upon the perfect bitter-sweet brownie!!!!!!

I had a sweet tooth and, specifically, a craving for chocolate. Unfortunately, the only thing in my kitchen was cocoa powder and a few other bare necessities. This recipe is great because it only calls for ingredients normally kept on hand. Not to mention, this quick and easy treat did the trick for my munchies.
