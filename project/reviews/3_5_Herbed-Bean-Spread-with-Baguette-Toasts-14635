The dip was well received on just crackers. To add a bit of zing I doubled the garlic. Half the recipe was nice for 6 guests.

This is a nice spread if you need something vegetarian to serve, but it wasn't too thrilling, and several of my guests took one bite and wrapped up the rest in their napkin! Maybe they thought it was something else. The combination of flavors was good (the more garlic the better, and it needs a lot of salt, even with the capers), a lot like hummous. Be warned, it makes a TON, and there's no way you'll use it all unless you are serving a party for 200 -- it just wasn't that popular.

SHould be called garlic bean not herbed. I cut the garlic to 1/2 a clove and it was pretty decent.

I'd give it two-and-a-half forks, if I could; more-than-just-like-it-not-quite-delicious! A nice variation on the hummus-type dip, and very easy with a hand-held blender. Made it as one of a selection of dips for a party, and although it wasn't ignored, people certainly weren't going wild for it. Unlike others, I thought it was a rather pretty dip with the flecks of green in it - maybe I didn't puree the herbs as rigorously as some people would ;) I'm finishing it off now as part of a veggie wrap - and that is rather yummy. Couldn't really taste the capers, and I might increase the thyme and possibly the lemon next time I make it. There will be a next time, too. Much cheaper than store-bought hummus, and no tahini. I love tahini, but I don't always have it in, and some of my friends are allergic to nuts and sesame seeds. I will consider it a sandwich filling rather than a dip, though.

I have made this several times now, always with great results, tho the last batch was close to being too garlicy. (Saying "large" is just too relative these days.) Still, it is a keeper, and I am even wondering about a Texas version using black-eyed peas and cilantro!

Really easy and delicious. I already had all the ingredients, so it was great to pull them all down from the shelves and make this. The capers give it a great kick.

This is the second time I've made this and it's great. I halved it this time but kept the garlic at two cloves. I also used romano beans which make the texture quite silky. The lemon juice is indispensable.

Good, but not very pretty- kind of a starnge color.

This is delicious and has the added bonus of being healthy.

Deeeeeee-licious. I have made this recipe many many times with rave reviews. So easy. Better if you make the spread a day ahead of time to let the flavors intensify. I used extra salt and about 5 Tbsp of lemon juice instead of 3.

Definitely a good finger food to serve when you have a number of people over. The garlic does need to be reduced a bit, but other ingredients (lemon juice, capers) can be increased. Once you've made it once, it's easy to alter to your taste. It has received rave reviews, and is very easy to whip together if you have a food processor.

I have only one word for this dish - HORRIBLE! The garlic was absolutely overpowering even after cutting it down by a third, and the other ingredients added nothing. Make this at your own risk!

I made this recipe for my Christmas party and ended up with a serving dish scraped clean! Try it with cilantro, Mexican oregano and lime juice in place of parsley, thyme and lemon juice.
