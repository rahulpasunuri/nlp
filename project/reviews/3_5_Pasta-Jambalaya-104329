A very solid and easy meal. I substituted a frozen seafood medley (mussels, squid, shrimp and fake crab) for the shrimp, and used Sriracha hot sauce. I also used butter instead of olive oil, which may have given it a little more richness.

This is a very good recipe. After reading some of the reviews I was concerned. I halved the recipe and pretty much followed it - less pasta; more green pepper; more celery. The result was quite spicy and would have fed at least 5 people (not 3).

I substituted hot linguica for the andouille and added cubed chicken breast. It was unbelievable! I will make this over and over again. My son made a Hogey out of it and said it was better that way than on Pasta. I used Linguini intead of bowtie also. Could be used on rice as well.

I highly recommend this recipe. Made it for four people and hardly had enough left for leftovers (because we all had seconds, and a few had thirds!). I changed the pasta to ORZO, (the kind that looks like rice), and used a homemade pasta sauce in lieu of the diced tomatoes (Tomato Sauce, dried seasonings, fresh basil, and a big handful of shredded parmesan). Will definitely make this again.

Tripled the recipe for a large group, except for onions. Easy to put together and everyone was pleased. Now make frequently for family and friends.

Wow! My guests loved this. Keep pasta seperate (dose with a little olive oil to keep from sticking) from sauce and allow your guests to spoon the jambalaya over the pasta as desired. Served up with corn muffins....very southern.

I am not a Jambalaya fan but,this was terrific on a snowy night. I used Kielbasa, because it was in the fridge, and added a teaspoon of hot pepper flakes. I also added a tablespoon of capers(my five year old loves them). I doubled the garlic...can't go wrong. Over all, this was a hit! Easy and very satisfing on a cold night.

Based on other revies I cut the amount of crushed tomatoes in half. It turned out delicious.

I followed the suggestions left by one reviewer and cut down on the tomato paste (I used 6 oz. or half a 12. oz. can instead of 28 oz.). With a few other modifications, the jambalaya was delicious.

Yuck-- I shudder just thinking of this recipe again. Leftovers were pitched before the end of the night. Waste of money.

This dish was overwhelmed by the tomato puree-- no other flavor was recognizable. Too bad, because I had some wonderful andouille. I'd probably try other pasta jambalaya recipes before making this one a second time.

We had something similar to this in a restaurant in Dallas, but this version was superior. We didn't imagine it was to be the same as Jambalaya (which we love and make often and know is a rice dish), but that it was a "take" on the ingredients of a typical jambalaya transposed to pasta. Loved every forkful. Allspice is common in cajun cooking and there's often a lot, too much for some, like my kids; I hold back a little until the end, taste and then adjust. You've got to taste!

Made it with the rice and it was fabulous and easy to prepare!

I loved the flavors that developed from this recipe. I changed a few things, however. Rice instead of pasta, added a fresh jalapeno pepper, more worchestirshire, no celery, a whole dried chipotle pepper and no cheese. I also added sweet corn, about 1 1/2 cups. It was a nice slow hot with a mild sweetness thanks to the corn.

I made this for my brother for his birthday and he loved it. I made some substitutions, as usual. I used chicken instead of shrimp, fennel instead of celery, I didn't have a bay leaf so I omitted it, rotini instead of farfalle, and red pepper instead of green. I don't know that it deserves to be called jambalaya, it's more like a hearty sausage pasta - a great winter dish (I made it in January).

Simply, the pasta in this doesn't work, if you make it, do it over rice! Overall the jambalaya was good, but I agree with the previous review that quite simply, jambalaya is a rice dish. I added a little more cayenne and cummin to git it more of a kick.

Ok, certainly spicy which we like but will stick with my rice jambalaya recipe when we're in the mood for jambalaya. I sautéed the shrimp with a bit of the garlic after browining the andouille to give our Ohio shrimp some flavor. More than 6 servings but the leftovers were better than the first night's dinner.

Nice variation, good and spicey. I didn't have shrimp or allspice(used a little cinnamon and clove).

It's my husband's new favorite! And although I don't care for shrimp, I like it because I can pick around it and eat the sausage. We could only find kielbasa and thought it was great.

I did not care for this dish. The allspice did not seem to compliment the other flavors.

Rating: 2
Good, but I was not duly impressed. The end result was kind of chunky, and not as smooth or flavorful as I had imagined. I will stick with Emeril's jambalaya recipe, which I much prefer. His jambalaya just melts in my mouth!

I made this for dinner. My husband and I really liked it. It was pretty spicy.

I made this dish for my wife and her parents. My father-in-law loves spicy dishes and he enjoyed it. My wife and mother-in-law enjoyed the dish but stated that this is a "guy's dish. We all agreed that it would be good for a superbowl party or larger gathering. I enjoyed it. It was not difficult to prepare and it was not too spicy.
