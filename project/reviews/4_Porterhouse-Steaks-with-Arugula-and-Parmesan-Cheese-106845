Simplistic and easy. Any steak works good on this one, i also add a little Italian dressing on top to add flavor.

To put the finishing touch on this receipt I boil down some balsamic with a few black pepper corns and a spring of thyme to a syrup, and drizzle over steak salad when served. Makes all the difference in the world, let me know how it works out.

Easy and simple--used London Broil instead and worked well, leftovers served with quiche next day...yum

I absolutely could not believe how good this dish was. The arugula adds something so unique I can't quite put my finger on it. Incredibly simple to make and Fantastic taste! Definite keeper

3 1/2 forks would be better. This was easy and delicious- guests loved it. I did use Sirloin steaks as they grill a bit more flavorfully

I used London Broil instead of steaks, and this was delicious. I think any kind of beef would be great with the arugula and parm cheese. Such simple tastes, and a wonderful combination.

Be forewarned,the size of the porterhouse steak called for in this recipe would have cost over $35 A PIECE! And this was just at a local grocery store...not even a specialty butcher. The semi-boneless strip steak I used instead was very tasty, served whole, not going to the trouble of slicing it. All in all a good dinner,using the suggestions of a rosemary garlic rub, but not a great deal more outstanding than just grilling a plain steak.

Good, not great, but it's a quicky. I also tweaked the meat with fresh rosemary and garlic. Even so, it doesn't resemble the Florentine steak I've had in Italy, probably because we (and consequently our meat purveyors) have all become too concerned about fat and delicious marbling. All the more reason to buy locally raised meat from farmers who remember what beef and pork used to taste like....

This was absolute perfection and so quick and easy. I tweaked it a little by smearing a rosemary, garlic, salt, pepper olive oil paste (mushed with a mortar and pestle) on the steak. In addition to following the very simple recipe, I squeezed a little lemon on the arugula and steak.

Simple in preparation but not simple in taste! I added some rosemary and some finely minced garlic to the oil but otherwise did not mess with this recipe! Served with grilled portabello mushrooms and a simple red potato salad.

I almost passed this recipe by chalking it up to "too boring", but it looked so easy, I thought I would give it a try. In a word, DELICIOUS. In addition, it looks gorgeous on a plate, requires only 3 ingredients, is rather inexpensive and can be prepared in 15 minutes flat. You can't beat it!

Just made this for a wine tasting dinner party on Saturday night. We decided to use thick filet mignons (individual steaks) instead of porterhouse steaks. We have no grill in our NYC apartment so we just broiled for about 4-5 minutes per side. We plated each steak on top of the bed of arugula, then added a few lemon wedges and shaved parm to each. Also added red potatoes roasted with garlic, parsley, rosemary and salt. Super easy and a beautiful presentation. A great compliment to our three Syrahs. Our guests were very impressed and every plate was clean. (Nice follow on to our first course -- linguine with hot chilis, pancetta and manila clams). Delicious!

Fantastic, even though (for lack of grill in Manhattan studio) I simply pan-seared for 4 minutes on each side. This recipe is one of the most pleasant surprises on Epicurious, as I would have never guessed that the arugula and steak would taste good together. For my own personal taste (being only somewhat tolerant of bitter greens), I would use half arugula and half spring mix next time. Excellent served with the wild mushroom risotto on this site.

So simple...so delicious! I usually make changes to a recipe as I go along...not this time. It was perfect the way it is.

Very easy and delish! Used 1 1/2"-thick porterhouse steaks on a George Foreman grill, 10 minutes total. Perfect. Key is to use the best quality steak, melts in your mouth with little effort.

Clean, simple tastes. Very easy to make, the tastes combine splendidly.

This is a great summer meal. Make sure you get the thick porterhouse...great flavor! I used garlic powder instead of salt on the meat as not to dry it out. BBQ over indirect method. I also used hickory chips...added marvelous flavor! I lightly tossed the arugula with olive oil, balasmic vinegar and salt and pepper. My guests marveled at the presentation.

Outstanding! Now that Prime beef is increasingly available, a three-inch thick Prime Porterhouse enhances this dish all the more. Another great way to make this dish even better is by smoke roasting the meat (fire on one side, using oak, hickory or mesquite, with the meat on the other). Wonderful!

I live in a one bedroom apartment so unfortunately had to cook my steak on the stovetop (with a little olive oil and butter) Nonetheless.. what a great combo of flavours. I used truffle oil per a previous recommendation and it was divine. Use lots of fresh parm shavings. Arugula needs GOOD rinsing..

The arugula give this delicous dish such depth, really rich tasting! I actually used Rib Eye...a family favorite cut. It made for an easy and elegant dish, I took the advice of an earlier chef and also served it on an Armetale alloy platter...it was beautiful and delicious.

This is so simple and makes such a big impression. I made it for Valentine's Day and my husband thought it was the best steak I ever prepared. Serve with a big cabernet.

Sooooo good. We had wine brought back from Tuscany that was to die for. Served with cherry tomatoes, hearts of palm salad with basil and balsamic vinegrette with a crusty loaf to soak up the oil and juice..mama mia! Each time every body raved! Have made it at least 4 times!

Nice summer steak salad. Guest loved. Will make again.

This dish was awesome! I used the porterhouse, pricey but yummy!! The presentation of this dish is quite impressive with the bed of arugula and the parmesan shavings on top! I used a very large silver tray and it looked quite grand. It's a very showstopper dish if you are looking for something for a special occassion. Yet it is so easy to make. I loved it, my guests loved it! I can't wait to make it again. I served it with a homegrown tomato, basil and mozarella salad, wild mushroom risotto, sauteed green beans with pine nuts and rosemary bread. A wonderful feast! I could go on and on about it...

I used tenderloin and topped with halved heirloom tomatoes - it was beautiful and delicious. Also, it was easy to make ahead, so I wasn't in the kitchen when the guests arrived. I served with the green bean and fingerling potato salad - everyone was very impressed

The perfect summertime dinner. Gorgeous presentation.

In Florence, they serve this dish every where. Although, there is always a half lemon on the side to squeeze on top. Delish.

This is a great steak/salad entree for summer. The combination of argula and aged parmesan shavings is unbeatable. In the future I would not use Porterhouse steaks because the filet portion cooked differently (faster) than the strip portion. I would chose either strip steak or tenderloin steak cut to the same thickness as indicated in the receipe. Also use truffle oil instead of olive oil for the salad. TERRIFIC!!
