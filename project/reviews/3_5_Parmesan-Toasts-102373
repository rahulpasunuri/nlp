Love this salad with the toasts

Rating: 4
I'm going to make this salad tomorrow, but I thought I would get a jump on my dinner by making the parmesan toasts in advance so I made them last night and they are FIERCE! Now I want to find lots of other things to smear olive oil and butter on!!! YUM- O!!!!

Went over well with the broiled Halibut i made.

I completely burned these -- probably a combination of my oven temp and the thinness of the slices. I definitely do better with more foolproof recipes.

So so. Not to die for.

These toasts were a hit at our house. I already made garlic bread this way, but sliced the bread thicker and used less cheese. I liked the crunchiness of the thinner slices.

These were so good. Everyone wanted the recipe. I baked them a little longer than the 13 minutes - about 16. Will definitely make again!

Fabulous! and they're sooo easy. Problem is you have to hide them before serving because they disappear. Can also be used as an appetizer or with most any pasta dish, etc., etc.

Excellent. They are devoured eveytime I make them. Taste best with freshly shredded parmesan cheese.

These are excellent! I want to make them with every salad I make from now on.

These are very good--and addicting! I made mine earlier in the day and left out on the counter. At serving time I just reheated in the 350 degree oven for about 5 minutes. Makes a nice big crouton and would be good with soup as well.
