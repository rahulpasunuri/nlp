I just made this for dinner. I made a few changes, I added a few cloves of garlic, used yukon gold potatoes, used chicken broth and no nutmeg (didn't have any). Everyone LOVED it. I would give it 4 forks, but it doesn't seem right as I changed it a bit. I think this will make a nice addition to my Christmas dinner.

Add a clove of garlic and use however much potatoes and parsnips you have. I didn't worry about coring the parsnips and it didn't seem to be a problem.

Bi-i-g disappointment! I like all three vegies, and thought this would be sublime, but it turned out lumpy, too sweet and uninspired. I'll take my parsnips combined with carrots and glazed, for a side veg in future.

This is a fantastic variation on mashed potatoes. Every time I make it I get very good feedback. It's not a million miles away from Champ, if you're familiar, but it is more savoury and a little less creamy.

Very nice alternative to traditional mashed potatoes. Even a three-year-old guest loved it. I skipped coring the parsnips and had a fine result.

I substituted turnips for the potato, took it to an office potluck and everyone loved it.

What a yummy mix of flavors! I liked it so much I didn't even mash it in the end. Just left it as it is. However, next time I'll plan for this and not cook it quite as long. Also, I'm dairy allergic so I used coconut butter instead. Yum!

I made this dish last night for an early Thanksgiving party and it was quite the hit. Very tasty and creamy. Although I had quartered the parsnips lengthwise, I still found it difficult to core them. The task became rather tedious and a waste of my time. The cores didn't even seem that rough or woody so in the pot they went. I also added three cloves of garlic to the initial leek batch. How can a recipe like this omit garlic I say. In the end after the mash down I stirred in a bit of cream. I will make this again no questions asked.

very tasty....made it to go with the Roast Chicken with Fennel & Garlic. The flavors complemented each other and the chicken very well and it reheated well too. Took the advice of another reviewer and used 1 cup skim milk for one cup of the water which definitely added a creaminess to it.

Wonderful! For the reviewer who had trouble coring the parnsips - if you quarter them length wise, you can simply slice off the woody bit from each quarter. I added a wee bit more nutmeg and a dash of cinnamon, and substituted one of the cups of water for a cup of milk for added creaminess.

I hadn't made anything involving parsnips before, and was baffled by the recipe's instructions to core them. This was not a straightforward process, and left me injured and in a state of nerves. Still, it was a nice change from the usual mashed potatoes. Served with roasted chicken.

We all like this a lot. I would boil it down a bit more the next time. It is surprisingly creamy.
