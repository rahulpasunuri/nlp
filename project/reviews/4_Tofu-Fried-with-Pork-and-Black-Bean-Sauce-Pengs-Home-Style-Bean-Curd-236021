This was delicious-I used cornstarch instead of potato starch and a jalapeno and serrano pepper instead of the mild red chiles. It packed some heat, so I didn't add the chile oil at the end. Next time I will incorporate some greens....

Excellent flavors, and deep-fried tofu is so much better than regular stir-fried tofu! I had to make several substitutions and it was still great: soy oil instead of peanut oil, Thai chilis instead of finger chilis, tamari instead of dark soy sauce, and corn starch instead of potato starch. I'll definitely make this again.

Easy to make and easy to eat! I am always looking for more tofu dishes, this one is a keeper
