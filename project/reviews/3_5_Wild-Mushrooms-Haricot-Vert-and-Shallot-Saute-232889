Had it at a friend's house. It is to DIE for!

This is good but not great. The mushrooms are nice, but the green beans don't pick up enough of the flavor. I used 3x the amount of wine called for, because the original amount didn't give enough flavor. I used a combination of madeira and marsala, which turned out nicely.

Made the receipe as called for. Easy to make ahead and warm. I also cooked the haricot verts early, splashed with cold water and chilled. Glad I used the Madeira for the flavor.

Although I had some hesitation, I made this dish because all the reviews raved about it. I wish I'd gone with my first instincts; it wasn't anything exciting. In fact, I think it is bit of a waste of good mushrooms and haricot vert! It is pretty bland. A much better recipe (and the one I really wish I'd made this time) is the one (on this site) for green beans in a shallot-balsamic vinegar reduction. That one is absolutely divine; this, not so much.

Delicious exactly as it is. Easy to make mostly in advance, just combining and reheating just before serving.

AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS. Used Marsala instead of Madeira. Did not need the chicken broth. Served with "My Favorite Simple Roast Chicken" from Thomas Keller (on this site) and steamed spinach. This may well be one of the best recipes I have ever followed. And... it's easy!

Great flavor and quite easy. I used frozen haricot vert and did not cook them separately. I added them at the end of the mushroom saute and heated them through. I used a little more Madeira than called for and did not add the butter or chicken broth. Excellent flavor.

We made this to go with Turkey over the holiday. Nice change from the traditional fare! Hard to double due to the amount of mushrooms though. I'd cook in batches the next time. Also perhaps using some dried morels (which are quite flavorful) would be nice as a substitution for some of the whole mushrooms. Everyone liked very much though just as it was ...

Prepared for Thanksgiving using shitake and chanterrele mushrooms primarily. Whole family loved the dish! Will plan on repeating for Christmas dinner.

I'm a veggie lover and this was a great side dish to a pork tenderloin. Very tasty.
