This was ok, I agree with the reviewers who said it was bland. I'd start with a new recipe next time, before trying this again and making an attempt at spicing it up.

This is nice and basic. Parboil green beans, asparagus, or whatever other hardy vegetable you have. Stir fry them separately and remove before you add the beef. Substitute sherry for the wine and add a teaspoon of red chili peppers. It's good.

eh, this was a lot blander than i expected, based on all of the rave reviews.

Quick and delicious. The only variations I employed from the recipe as given were a) I cooked the beef for around 90 seconds (lean flank steak starting out at room temperature and sliced around 2"x0.25"x0.25") b) I happened to have a pot of superfluous and miscellaneous ingredients that evolves as quantities purchased/able exceed the needs of recipes. In this case I had a melange of chicken stock and pulped tomatoes; c) I added a finely chopped, fiercely hot chilli pepper to the marinade mixture. The table went wild! Definitely a keeper.

Very delicious, and easy to add/subtract vegetables. I used sirloin steak cut in strips and as with previous reviewer substituted dry sherry and added crushed red pepper. I also always serve Chinese food at the table with Japanese "tongarishi" (another hot smallground pepper to sprinkle)and soysauce. Well worth making.

As is, a rather bland stir fry recipe. Total waste of filet mignon. Too much cornstarch, not enough pizazz. Boring.

I modified this recipe a lot, but it turned out the best stir fry I've served. I combined it with ideas from Cooking Light's "Three Pepper Beef." I added 1/2 tsp ground black pepper, 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, 1/2 tsp sugar and a dash of sesame oil to the marinade, as well as using sherry instead of wine and low sodium Tamari instead of soy. I used a mix of red, yellow and green peppers (about 2 cups total) and green onions. Cook the beef over high heat and the marinade mixture will really caramelize in the pan; be sure to incorporate the brown bits when stirring in the sauce (I acually deglazed with a bit of white wine to get them all up). I slighlty froze the meat and sliced it REALLY thinly and across the grain; I used sirloin, and only cooked it until barely no longer pink. Sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds when done. It had a fabulous depth of flavor; I rarely use beef broth (usually substitue chicken), but I think it really helps the sauce. I also added about 1/2 cup water to the sauce mixture.

I'd make this again but I would definitely play around with it first. I happen to like very hot and spicy Asian food, and this just didn't do it for me, it really did seem tasteless and bland - but perhaps I've abused my taste buds? I also found the sauce a little too thick for my tastes so I would cut back on the cornstarch next time. The family enjoyed it, however, so I'll make it again but jazz it up with some chili paste, extra soy, garlic, and red bell peppers as well as some onions. I followed other reviewers suggestions and doubled the marinade & broth mixtures. I like to sop up the extra sauce with rice.

This is a very good recipe. I would reccomend using lo-sodium soy sauce. I added black pepper sauce, chopped celery, and some hot peppers. Very tasty!

Since I don't eat beef, I used salmon chunks which worked well. I had to use a bit of red wine in place of the white and added some sugar to the sauce. The directions call for too much work with two bowls of sauces. After stir frying the green pepper and water chestnuts, I simply added the salmon mixture, cooked a few mins. then added the broth (used vegetable) and the sauce thickened wonderfully. I also had to quadruple the sauce - the recipe as is makes very little. I might do this with a mixture of veggies, too. Or shrimp.

This is like a 2.5. My husband said he really really liked it. I thought it was okay. I did make a few changes. Instead of water chestnuts, I used sliced bamboo shoots. Also threw in a dash of fish sauce and doubled the sauce (we like a saucy stir-fry). At the last minute, I threw in 4 tiny sliced Thai chilies that I had forgotten I had. Added a really nice hot punch. Good basic recipe that leaves itself open to whatever you have on hand.

I made this for my boyfriend who really liked it, he ate A LOT of it! Personally, I didn't care for it. I added baby corn to it,which we both like, but I found it rather tasteless. He liked it though, so I suppose it's just a matter of personal preferance.

This dish is very good. I added more garlic and also added a red dired pepper to kick up a notch. I also added broccoli and mushroom and green onion--turned out great

Really good basic recipe. I added more garlic and doubled the sauce using a whole cup of beef broth. Marinated the beef about four hours. Also added a little celery and bok choy. Yummy! A keeper for sure.

good, basic recipe. add more ginger and garlic. rice vinegar substitutes just fine for the wine.

This recipe was very straightforward and easy to make. The results were quite surprising and the dish was delicious. I added some extra garlic and found the original recipe portion more appropriate, especially if you are not eating alone. For the newbies like me your going to love it, everybody enjoy!

We used the leftover beef broth along with water to cook the rice. It was a wonderful complement to the stir-fry. This is keeper!

This was a very tasty stir fry. Much better than I've ever invented myself. And it was quite simple. My wife loves it. I'll certainly make it again and probably vary it a little.

This recipe is nothing extra special -- very bland. I would, however, make it again because my mother loved it (after adding several dashes of soy sauce to her portion). Next time, I will add a 14 oz. can of pineapple, for extra flavor. (I marinated the beef for 4+ hours, and it was very tender.)

Above average, good recipe for stir fry. I'll keep this posted on the refrigerator. There is nothing unusual or unique about it, but it is reliable and I think you could probably use whatever vegetables you like. Your guests will like it, but they won't talk about it for days to come.

Doesnt require too many ingredients therefore quick and easy to make. Would cook the peppers a little longer though otherwise its great!

Great recipe - but always trying to adapt. Added asparagus, red peppers and mushrooms (probably a little more ginger too!). Added to the weekly slate of weeknight meals!

I loved this recipe. It was very easy to make and tasted great. I think that it needs a little more spices to it. I didn't add the wine since I couldn't find it but it still tasted great. This one is a keeper.

Easy and delicious....I used more beef in this, as we have a lot of meat-eaters in my family (dad and brother were happy there was so much beef available). I put a few dashes of some pepper sauce in to heat it up a little bit and balance the ginger.

This was a good dish. I surprised myself by ending up making something that you would come across at a good Chinese restaurant. It could have had a few more spices in it, though, to make it more interesting. The recipe was quite easily to follow; I had no problems and was very content with the directions. My friend's dad, from ye Olde England, said the dish could have had more beef in it, but my friend and I disagree, as we are not so much the meat-and-potato kind of guys.

I used chicken and chicken broth instead of beef...I even had to leave out a few items like garlic and something else...but it was still delicious...my girlfriend's favorite yet!!!!

I used double the amount of ginger. I also mixed wild rice with the white rice to give it a nutty flavour. It was great!!!
