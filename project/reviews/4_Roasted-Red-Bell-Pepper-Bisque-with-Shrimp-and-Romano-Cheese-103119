This is a great recipe. Simple. Flavorful. Relatively healthy if you substitute non-fat half/half. I also included a whole onion and a couple whole garlic cloves when I brought the chicken stock to a boil, and then removed them before blending....Delicious.

This is outstanding and deceptively simple and tasty. The shrimp is a great touch but definitely not mandatory. I used parmesan and a bit of smoked paprika in addition to regular paprika. Leftovers were awesome too.

My husband & I thought this was outstanding. Will make this again for a holiday sitdown dinner for 20. Cut the peppers in half; roasted them until they were black; put into a paper bag for about an hour. Skins removed easily just using my hands. Sprinkled Emeril's dry Essence onto the shrimp before sauteing. Excellent!

Delicious. I threw a sliced onion on the grill when roasting the peppers and added it to the stock. Also put a few cloves of garlic (diced) in the sautee pan with the shrimp and red pepper. Used half&half instead of heavy cream and omitted the sugar. Served as a main course with crusty bread and small salad. Definitely a do-over.

I added 2 medium roasted onions and some garlic that I simmered in white wine and butter. I was skeptical at first, but as the soup simmered the flavors came together beautifully. Terrific flavor!

Hi, all. I'm giving this 4 forks b/c I don't want to throw off the rating, but I wanted everyone to take a page from my lesson book. Don't use shrimp stock. I had made some stock from shells that we routinely freeze and thought this would be a good use, especially since everyone was raving about this bisque. The shrimp stock was too much. Completely over powered the roasted red peppers. Will try this again using veggie or chix stock. The bisque was also a bit thin for me. I'd use less stock next time.

Rating: 3
this was great! Used veggie stock instead and left out the hot pepper sauce. I will make this again and include the hot pepper

Rating: 4
Have made this several times and is a great recipe as written. As others have noted, using half-and-half works well and the roasted onion & garlic are a must. One other modification, I season the shrimp with cajun seasoning prior to sauteing.

This bisque was excellent. I used homemade chicken stock, which gave the bisque rich flavor. My husband ate 3 bowls & made sure that I had saved the recipe to make it again. The hot sauce is a must - it adds a nice spicy background flavor.

I made this exactly as written and it was delicious and different. I would definitely make it again.

I received rave reviews from my guests. I made the following changes: I pureed all 5 peppers, used half-n-half instead of whipping cream, and parmesan instead of pecorino. I had a little trouble removing the charred skin from the peppers even though they were blackened and put in a brown paper bag. I ended up having to use a paring knife to scrape them under water. I think they lost a little flavor that way.

Rating: 4
Really good! I added one poblano to the mix, and used parmesan. Instead of plain cream and hot sauce, I made the serrano/garlic cream from the yellow pepper soup on this site, using yogurt. Did not have shrimp and it tastes good without, but seems like they would have worked well.

Rating: 4
Gee, I really thought this would be an absolute bore! I put this together exactly as written and what a pleasant keeper. Don't be afraid of the hot sauce. Add as much kick as you want without turning the flavor too far. I set this up with toasted italian bread and bubbling gruyere cheese and a side of bacon-wrapped roasted asparagus. Killer.

Rating: 4
made this for lunch yesterday and was thrilled with results. Followed recipe except skipped paprika (not a big paprika fan), used chili oil instead of hot sauce, and used milk instead of cream. Didn't have any shrimp so used cut up turkey sausage instead (but think shrimp would be great)...even my 7 year old son loved it. a definite keeper.

Rating: 4
Used this recipe for Christmas Eve, it got rave reviews. I did make minor changes, I added a quarter cup of crab meat, used only three cups of chicken broth, and added a quarter of a jalapeno. Next time I make it I'll add more crab meat, not use the shrimp, and add more jalapeno (I enjoy spicy foods).

Rating: 4
Absolutely fabulous! I've made it twice now and had rave reviews. My changes: double the romano or use parmesan, add a couple tbsp. of Emeril's 'Kick It Up' Red pepper sauce for a medium heat with flavor, brown 1-1 1/2 pkgs. of Perdue Turkey Breakfast sausage and add to the soup. When you bite into the sausage it adds a little more spice and when you bite into the shrimp it cools the flavor. Makes for an absolutely fabulous gourmet meal that's relatively easy to make!

Great! I added onions and garlic as someone else had suggested which definitely added flavor-think this would be exceptional for Christmas-colorful and tasty!

Just a note...peeling peppers is easier if you let them stand for more than 10 minutes...like 45 even. Just do the pepper part the night before or something. If you get the peppers really black (I set off the smoke alarm), then they peel really easy

Rating: 4
LOVED this soup...well, my version of it. Roasted a couple of onions and about 8 cloves of garlic with the peppers and pureed the whole lot together. DIDN'T use whipping cream...about 1/2 cup of half and half and same of skim. Forgot to chop the shrimp. Oops... And added shredded basil on top. Raves!

This has become my new favorite soup. I don't eat shrimp, so left it out of my dish. The other guests raved! It's gorgeous and very flavorful. I look forward to trying it this summer when the bell peppers are even sweeter. Excellent!

I have made this soup at least a dozen times. It is fabulous every time. I have made it with and without the shrimp. I use brown sugar instead of granulated and also a squeeze of lemon juice for body. I am generous with the hot pepper sauce and also add a little parmasean cheese to the top. The basil is key.

Very nice soup to use as a first course to impress your friends. I used fresh parsley instead of basil. I also used an 8oz. block of cream cheese and a handful of parmasean. Turned out very smooth and tasty!

really easy and packed with taste - my husband loved it - I used more basil than was called for and forgot the sugar and it was still great - oh I also skipped the cream and just used whole milk. very yum and super easy!

Very good soup. I made a few modifications.... I used 5 sweet red peppers and 2 medium to large jalapeño peppers, roasted them all. By using the jalapeño peppers, i didn't need to use the hot sauce later in the recipe. Yes, I seeded them after roasting. Also, I used 4 cups of broth to compensate for the additional mass of the peppers. Finally, I had some bay scallops as well as shrimp in my freezer. I used a combination of them and added crab meat. here's a money saving tip, instead of buying the high end crab, buy the pouches of crab you will find near the canned and pouched tuna. The pouched crab is a small quantity, reasonably priced and stores well. Perfectly good for soups and other dishes were it isn't the main ingredient

Rating: 3
I think this was a delicious soup. I loved the interaction between the different flavors. Roasting the red peppers was actually fun! I also liked the flavor of the shrimp in the soup but I want to try it out with other types of seafod too. The only change I made was to roast some garlic cloves at the same time I was roasting the bell peppers and throw those in the soup.

Rating: 3
This is an excellent soup base and very simple to prepare, but I personally think it was quite bland as written--and I was generous with the seasonings. I am eating my first bowl as I write this so can't suggest any changes I have made, but my initial comment is that it has too little cheese rather than too much. When a recipe includes cheese, my mouth expects to taste CHEESE. The red pepper base is certainly flavorful enough to support more. I had it as a main course, however. If you were using it as a starter, the more subtle version may be perfect, depending on what follows.

Rating: 3
This was sooo good. I've never made my own soup before so I was a little nervous but this was easy. I took another's advice and cut the peppers in half and flattened with my hand on a foil lined pan before roasting. The roasting didn't take long and the peel came off easily. I used shrimp but this would have been just as good without it. I'm a cheese lover and usually think more is always better but I used maybe 3/4 of what was called for and it was great - I think too much could ruin this. I used about 1/2 the paprika (seemed like a lot) and sprinkled a few chili flakes with it. It was amazing but I think I'll try a lower fat version next time and see how it turns out.

Rating: 3
Great soup - easy to make. Did not have the cheese so added a couple of squeezes of fresh lemon juice to brighten the flavour a bit. Also only used half of the cream - agree with previous poster that this would be nice with crab meat - will try that next time.

Wonderful Soup! A perfect starter to a gourmet meal... or great simply coupled with warm crusty bread. Although it doesn't need to be changed I might substitute lobster instead of the shrimp just to mix it up.....Great Dish. Enjoy!

Excellent soup! I make this in large batches when the peppers are coming out of the garden. I season the shrimp with a rub and grill it along with sweet corn. Slice the corn from the cob and add to the bisque. Fantastic. This soup also freezes well. I served it as a starter for Christmas dinner and received raves!

made it, i thought roasting the peppers was fun! I followed it exactly except i didnt have romano but just used parm cheese. when i put soup in blender i also added about 15 shrimp in the soup made a great texture. For a dish to serve with it I sauted up some Brocoli Rabbi in olive oil anf garlic, added 15 shrimp to pan along with some red pepper matchsticks. great Look.!

This bisque was excellent. The pepper peeling is a lot easier if you ensure the peppers are blackened everywhere. If I make it again, I wont even bother with the shrimp, I felt it actually took away from the recipe. I followed the directions exactly this time.

this was really great. I didn't use the shrimp at all. you could easily skip the cheese too, and I thought it tasted fine without the cream, though with it, it was even better. i tried the recipe with green peppers as well. while not as tasty as with red peppers it was still flavourful, though the color was a bitt off-putting.

This was soooo good! I agree with all the other reviewers, this is so delicious, elegant, and easy to make(aside from the pepper roasting time)And it had such a nice depth of flavor and finish. I used crabmeat instead of shrimp, and also tossed in a few croutons toasted with paprika, but honestly you could serve this with nothing at all, just the bisque, and it would still be amazingly good. A new favorite.

Beautiful presentation. Just remember to not forget the hot sauce! With my first bite, I thought, hmmm, this is good but lacking something. Then I realized what it was, I'd forgotten to add the hot sauce. This reheats easily in the microwave if you double the batch or have leftovers. Just nuke on Medium for 3-4 minutes per bowl.

Hands down the best soup I've ever made...and I AM a soup maker! The only 2 suggestions I have are to add more shrimp and to buy a jar of roasted red bell peppers to save time.

Rating: 4
This is without a doubt the best soup I have ever made. You really don't need the shrimp. The powerful flavor of the roasted peppers is all that you need. It is such a festive and colorful soup to have this time of year. Just put a couple basil leaves on top when serving to obtain the red and green effect. I mixed the basil and shrimp in with the soup and used 1/4 tsp. red pepper. Using a dollop of crabmeat on top in lieu of shrimp when serving might be a nice touch.

Outstanding recipe!! I'm not a very experienced soup-maker. Very easy to make and tastes wonderful. I've made it many times. Very difficult to mess up. Save yourself some time--get the peppers from the grocery store (salad bar of high-end grocery store--jars packed in oil are too expensive). Roasting and peeling the peppers is by far the hardest part. I've used lobster and crab instead of the shrimp---all are good. Doesn't need the cream (to save fat) but better with it.

Second attempt w/soups. Easy and wonderful. Made it "too spicy" the first time, but came out better than when I followed the recipie later. Definately a keeper.

Rating: 4
PERFECT!!! It may seem like quite a few steps, but it truly is simple to prepare. Pay the most attention to the seasoning at the end (hot sauce, salt and pepper). It takes it from good to great. We make this soup often and have only used the shrimp once. It really doesn't need it. It can stand on it's own. Also be careful not to add too much cheese (normally I'm always for extra cheese but not this time)

Rating: 3
Fantastic soup. I actually tweak this somewhat and use this recipe combined with the cream of red bell pepper soup on this site. (I prefer a little shallot/garlic combo added initially). Roasting your own peppers is the only way to go. (the jarred peppers are not the same in my opinion- fresh is always better).

I doubled the recipe. While I was roasting the 10 peppers in my electric oven and peeling them, I had second thoughts about the trouble involved in this recipe. When I tasted the soup, those thoughts disappeared! This is GREAT!

This soup was excellent!!!! Everyone was asking for more. The only problem was I didn't have enough left to go around. Next time I will double, even triple the recipe!! I only made two changes. I used light cream and reduced the red peppers to 4 instead of 5. It does take a long time to prepare the peppers, but it is certainly worth the trouble.

I use shredded grilled chicken instead of shrimp. perfect with a pepper jack grilled cheese.

Fabulous! I have made this recipe several times (exactly following the recipe) and it has been delicious each and every time. (Okay, the truth? I almost always add some extra shrimp, because I love them, but you don't need to.) I strongly recommend that you use the Romano cheese (and NOT parmigiano) as its pungency is an essential contrast to the sweet red peppers. This recipe is definitely restaurant-quality good. YUM!

I was looking for something low fat, easy, and healthy. I used already roasted red peppers in a jar and substituted milk for the cream. Finally I did not cook the shrimp in oil first I just used cooked jumbo shrimp and added them directly to the soup. I didn't add the cheese and it was delicious and very low in calories. I can only imagine how good it might have been if I had followed the recipe the high fat way.

Very good. Used Parm instead of Romano and prawns instead of shrimp. I also chopped up all the peppers at the beginning and didn't reserve the strips as it calls for (was just being lazy). Added a few splashes of Tabasco which was perfect. Good the day its made, excellent the next.

This bisque is fabulous... a hit with all including the children. We cooked the shrimp in the bisque prior to adding the cheese and cream. We also added some crab meat at the end and the Romano cheese was substituted with Parmesan. This bisque is just as tastey using half and half. Will definately make it again and again...

This is a lovely soup. I used half and half instead of cream to cut down on fat calories and it turned out very nice. While you could skip the shrimp, it adds a wonderful flavor, so I recommend adding it...going to try chunks of lobster next. Perfect starter for a dinner party.

Much better than I expected - the flavors are wonderfully balanced. It's fairly quick to prepare and elegant to serve. Instead of five red peppers, I used 2 red, 2 yellow and a pasilla. I'm not sure what the author means by 'hot pepper sauce' as there are many cultural variations, so I diced a good sized jalepeno.

Amazing! My guests loved this dish - a true winner. I didn't have pecorino Romano cheese so I used fresh Parmesan instead. I also cut down on the whipping cream, using 1/2 cup. I added some red pepper flakes to the shrimp which gave the soup an extra kick. I'll make this again.

Fabulous! Made this just over the weekend - really delicious! I halfed the recipe (there are just two of us). I'd have to agree with many others - the shrimp isn't necessary at all. The bisque has a wonderful flavor all its own!!! Will make again. I roasted the red peppers !!

This is a GREAT soup, would cost over $12.00 per bowl in NYC, and be worth it! Excellent texture, color and very rich flavor.

I made this for Valentine's day and my husband and I both loved it. I used Reggiano Parmesan instead of the romano, and Dave's Insanity sauce for the hot pepper sauce. I also prepared it a day ahead adding the sauteed shrimp, basil, cheese and whipping cream right before serving. Definitely a keeper!

My husband and I loved this recipe. We will definitely make it again. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers. I made the bisque earlier in the day and just warmer it up and prepared the shrimp and bell pepper. I sauted the shrimp and peppers in minced garlic and a little onion. I think it really jazzed up the recipe. I served the soup as recommend( basil) but as another review mentioned, I put a touch of shredded cheddar on top for color. I then made quick drops of hot sauce around the rim of the bowl for a great look. It looked beautiful and was very yummy!!!

This is and excellent recipe. I made a few minor alterations like most people. I sauted the shrimp with onions and garlic, we substituted chicken stock for vegetable stock and parmeason for the Romano. My husband and I both thought that 1/2 teaspoon of Paprika was WAY too much. I would reduce it to just a pinch for taste and no hot sauce was needed.

This soup is simple and delicious. I love the fact that there are so few ingredients. I did add some garlic and basil to the shrimp mixture, and I infused my cream with garlic, red pepper flakes and basil before adding. I plan to make this again for a first course at a dinner party I have coming up. I'm going to add some shredded cheese to the top along with the basil for added visual appeal. I wonder how this recipe would taste using roasted red peppers from a jar for a quick weeknight version?

I've made this recipe twice now in the past week. The first time I made it it was super. The second time I made it I doubled it. It was more runny (I also threw in 2 yellow peppers instead of the red) but just as delicious. I think doubling the recipe doesn't quite work as well (for me at least). I loved the recipe and think it's fantastic for the fall/winter. This recipe is definitely a "keeper" and will be served at my next luncheon or dinner party.

I actually made this because I grew up in Western, NY, and have since moved away. I liked the soup, and it wasn't all that labor intensive.

This is very yummy if you like roasted peppers. I have made this twice with rave reviews.
