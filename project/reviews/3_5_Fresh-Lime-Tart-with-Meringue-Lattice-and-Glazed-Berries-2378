I agree that this is a great recipe even though I didn't make it exactly as written. I used my own macadamia nut crust recipe, left off the lattice and cut down the sugar by about a half. I also increased the lime zest by a teaspoon and used a dash of pure vanilla extract to avoid the time and expense of the vanilla beans. I also didn't use any liquor since there wasn't any that seemed appealing for this recipe. I had an easier time with this custard recipe than I've had with others. It turned out beautifully and was a real crowd pleaser. Thanks!

I'm a big fan of key lime desserts in general and have tried many variations of key lime tarts and pies. This one was disappointing and my least favorite, perhaps because of the wine. Ironicallly, that's why I tried it -- sounded interesting. My guests were not thrilled with the tart either -- good but not up to par with other ones I've served them. My advice - find a simpler recipe without the wine; there are many on this site. [Also, don't use the zest of the key lime itself (juice is great, though); the peel of ordinary limes is better. ]

This recipe was a hit! It is extrenely visually appealing. I used vanilla extract instead of making the vanilla syrup. I didn't chill the pie crust. Next time I wouldn't bother with the grand marnier. It really didn't do much for the dessert and we ended up eating up most of the fruit form the bowl instead.

suprisingly good! i used a 9 inch tart pan, didn't have any trouble with crust. followed directions exactly and it smelled heavenly with the lime zest. i made changes to the rest of the recipe: i do not cook with alcohol, so i subbed unsweetend apple juice for the wine in the filling. for the berry topping instead of casis, i heated some raspberry syrup and lime zest and gently tossed in blueberries, strawberries and raspberries. then instead of the meringue i used a very lightly sweetened whipped cream. end result looked very professional. i've got a request to make this again!

I am only 12 years old, making this repice BY MYSELF, I thought ti was pretty easy. I do advise, however, to not to try to do everything thing at once, it gets really complicated! Next time I won't make the meringue because I couldn't really taste it, but when I made it, I just used vanilla extract instead of a vanilla bean. The final product was wonderful! It's tasted wonderful and looked amazing! I just made it because, but it would make a great gift or dessert for a fansy evening.

I also thought this recipe was ridiculously complicated for what is essentially lime meringue pie. I would make it again because it tasted great, but next time I wouldn't chill the pastry before rolling it,so it doesn't crack, I would bake the crust for half the time, I wouldn't bake the filling (it's already cooked) and I would whip the whites with the sugar and some vanilla essence like usual meringue, rather than the vanilla bean syrup performance. I don't think anyone would be able to tell the difference!

I am really surprised at everyone's ravings about this recipe. I thought it was way too much work for what it was. Like another reviewer, my crust also kept cracking and falling apart and had to be pieced together. I thought the meringue was a waste because you could barely see it once the fruit was on, and definitely couldn't taste it. Lastly, I thought it had too much lime. It did look beautiful, though!

I love this tart. The cooking time for the crust is too long. It is so beautiful and equally delicious.

The most impressive dessert I've made! I made this into six individual tarts (Note: you will have leftover filling and meringue.) The first time I made the crust I did not mix it long enough with the pastry blender. Used my fingers the next time and the dough turned out awesome! Just the right blend of lime zest. The berries are worth making. I used blueberries, strawberries, blackberris and rasberries. Crust cooks quicker than recipe calls for in small tart pans. I also made tarts one day ahead and covered with plastic wrap. The crust did not get soggy as I feared. Worth the time!

I skipped the meringue and the berry glaze and made small, individual tartelettes instead of a big one. Turned out beautiful, appealing and delicious, and did not miss the troublesome toppings at all. Fantastic for tea time or to give to friends as treats!

This is a fabulous dessert; an impressive close to any dinner. It is quite time consuming but worth the effort. Take care in cooking the crust - mine was cooked in far less time than recommended.

This is spectacular every time I make it. The lime is superb, the vanilla meringue matches perfectly, and the wider variety of berries, the better. Absolutely makes anyone look like a professional pastry chef.

This recipe was more time-consuming than it needed to be, but the result was a show-stopper! Next time, I'd use a different crust; this one broke apart and had to be pieced and pressed into the tart pan. The good news is, the tart looked just like the cover photo when it was done...gorgeous!
