The filling is insanely amazing & the cake is tender & airy. I brought it to a party tonight & everyone asked me to make it again. I followed the recipe exactly, and followed the many recommendations to chill the filling a full day before putting the cake together, then chilling that for a full day. Definitely worked. My cake turned out plenty high enough to cut in half. I wonder if it's about really gently folding in the egg whites, not rushing it, so you don't lose the air. Next time, I will make only half the filling so I can taste the cake too. Definitely needs to be kept chilled. It sat out at the party in a warm dining room for an hour before we served it, and it definitely began to wilt and became hard to cut -- at that point the topping was more firm than the filling so it was slipping & squishing. Only when I had a knife dipped in hot water did the cake slice easily. Next time I will slice it when still firmly chilled. It's so rich I cut the pieces small -- I got 20 decadent slices from it easily.

I had some mocha filling leftover from a chocolate cookie recipe that I wanted to use up, so I just made the cake portion of this recipe. The cake came out looking great, I used two 8" rounds and I think I baked it for about 20min. I also made an Irish whiskey whipped cream to serve with it. It all tastes good together, however I'm a little disappointed in the texture of the cake.......it's kinda spongy. Perhaps, if I made the cake with the syrup it would've been more moist.

Very rich but delicious cake! Came out great the first time, but I will definitely make only half the filling next time and also double the cake. I added some spiced rum to filling and 1/2 stick a butter to cake to get it more moist. The top coat didn't come out very shiny, so I'll use a better quality chocolate, like Lindt. A really decadent treat!

I agree with the description of this cake as far as it being an "Ultra- rich" dessert because it most definitely is very rich. I liked the concept of this dessert and the filling is to die for, the execuetion however is not what I was expecting. There was way too much filling for this cake and not enough actual cake. I thought seeing the inside would make it a bit more "upscale" so to speak it actually was not that appealing. I therefore used the filling to frost the sides of the cake as well. So if I make this again I would make the following modifications. Double the cake to make four layers, the cake is very airy and light and does compliment the filling nicely. I would also do an 8 inch round cake because I like the look better. I would not add as much rum to the filling, because it was almost overpowering to me. I liked the topping a lot and would be interested in seeing how it would be on the side as well. When I first made the filling I kept thinking that I had left something out because it was almost like chocolate milk and I was very nervous that it would not set. However when I pulled it out of the fridge the next day the filling had set very nicely. Do not overmix it, it literally does take less than a minute to become spreadable, otherwise you will have to wait for it to set again. Oh and being that the filling is so "spreadable", I put in the freezer for about 10 minutes to set before I put the top layer on just so it would not ooze out of the sides. I would highly recommend doing this. Overall, a very nice cake that I am interested in making again.

I baked the cake in an 8 inch square pan. It came out just thick enough, moist and just a little hard to slice, but not too much. I made 3/4 of the filling specified and even so it was just a little too much. My main problem was that even though the filling thickened up just fine overnight in the refrigerator, when I started to beat it in the morning, it inmdiately started to curdle. I can't think why?! It was still great tasting and held up perfectly when assembled.

Rating: 3
I would make this again...in hopes that it would turn out better the 2nd time. The flavors were wonderful, but I had the same problem that some other users did with the filling being too goopy when I served it. If I made it again, I would probably reduce the amount of cream in the filling (quantity-wise, I thought a 3/4 quantity of the filling was perfect). Also, I followed the suggestion of some other users and baked the cake in two 2-inch round pans (13 minutes), and that worked out great.

I have made this cake many times and each time I serve it my guests LOVE it. It is ultra-rich so I usually serve it after a light meal and along with a good port wine. This cake does take some time to make so I almost always start the cake two days ahead of my serving day so I can refrigerate it one complete day and allow the flavors to meld together.

I made this for a bake sale, I was worried about the cake standing up, and the filling being to 'oozy', it held up perfectly and I got rave reviews! I made 2 cakes for the sale and someone bought the 2nd cake whole to take home. My only suggestion is to half the filling recipe... I was able to use the filling from one recipe to fill both cakes. I have the fililng for the 2nd in my fridge... I'm thinking of it as rum mousse. Over all wonderfull cake!

I made this for my company's holiday party, and it was a smashing success--I got compliments from at least six different people (including company president) who told me it was above and beyond any other dessert there! I read the reviews beforehand and used 3 1/4 c. whipping cream instead of the full four cups. I also divided the rum-chocolate cream into two bowls while it stiffened in the fridge. After six hours, it was the perfect consistency and I didn't have to beat it. As others have noted, there was way too much cream filling for the cake--I still have half of it left over. This cake is a bit time-consuming but well worth the effort. Turns out great if you follow the steps carefully and take the advice above.

I have made this cake before, but unfortunatly I made the mistake of over beating the chocolate. it came out chunky. so beforwarned, dont overbeat

I took some of the advice from the reviews and did the following:: cut the filling recipe in half, omitted the dark rum from the syrup, doubled the cake recipe, used instant cappucino powder instead of coffee powder, and baked two cakes in 8" round pans. I left the filling in the refrigerator overnight and whipped it the next day while still cold for approx. 4 minutes on high speed. Consistency was perfect but colour was not as dark as the picture. Both cakes hardly shrunk but sides and bottoms were pretty crumbly which made icing the cake pretty difficult. Don't know what I could've done to prevent this other than grease and flour pans, which I did. The cake was a bit too high for my liking after assembling everything but looked good overall. I may use one 8 1/2 inch spring form pan the next time and cut in half.

Rating: 3
This cake was very good and looked just like the picture. Be forewarned that the filling must be whipped for longer than one minute to obtain the desired consistency; I added extra rum to the filling and used half semisweet/half bittersweet chocolate for more complexity. It seemed that the rum syrup really made the cake, carrying the rum flavor throughout. A very rich, tasty cake, but not terribly unique in terms of flavor complexity, so I don't think I'd make it again. But it was enjoyed!

This cake is worth the time and calories. It's very special. I failed with making the cake and cutting it in half. I made the cake a second time in two 9 inch round pans and was very successful. I also decorated the top with strawberries. I'll keep this recipe and volunteer for dessert for many parties to come.

I used a chocolate Duncan Heinz cake mix, and baked it in a springform pan for about 45 minutes, then let the cake get cold in the fridge. When it was completely cooled, I took the sides off the pan, and sliced it horizontally. (Didn't make the syrup for fear of having a somewhat soggy cake.) The filling was wonderful. I used a coffee liqeur instead of rum and beat the filling for 5 minutes. Put the sides back on the pan and built the layers right in the springform pan. Topped the thing with trufles and let it get cold in the fridge. This is a very professional looking and pretty cake, and guests had seconds. I'm craving that filling even now.

I read the reviews prior to making this and boy did that help. Also making everything the night before and assembling the next day made it relatively easy. I used an 8x8x2 square pan and the cake was just the right height and easy to handle. I used a good quality chocolate and substitued in grand marnier. Great recipe and will make it again.

this was absolutely incredible tasting, but much messier looking than the picture. I am about to make it again and will put it in individual cups parfait-style so that the filling (which is wonderful) doesn't ooze over everything. But even messy, it looks incredibly decadent and yummy. I topped each serving with a cappucino truffle, which gave it some more height and finish (though a truffle is NOT needed for flavor purposes!!!!)

Very good and moist. Yes, cake could be thicker, but still good. Cut back on heavy cream, but next time won't. It was very thick. Good to use on sides of cake, because doesn't look as good as picture.

Well worth the time and effort! The cream filling is marvelous - it makes this recipe special. The cake layer was difficult to cut in half but it was easy to re-adjust when cut too thin on one side. The cake mended itself.

Delicious dessert that was enjoyed by all; especially the chocolate lovers of the family. However, it almost didn't make it on the Xmas table. As some experienced...the cake collapsed during the cooling process; when sliced one-half completely fell apart. Had to bake a second one in order to get the two halves. The filling oozed out of the sides (between a warm kitchen and cream filling required longer whip time) and there was too much of it. From an appearance standpoint I was ready to toss in the towel. My persistence paid off though. The filled cake firmed up overnight, and was able to clean up the sides that oozed out. Then used the reserved chocolate topping as a ganache to coat the top and all sides of the cake. Made for a nice presentation, and a much more chocolaty dessert.

Wow! I'm really glad I read the other reviews before making this. I made it exactly as written. I kept the filling in the fridge over night and when I whipped it, it got stiff, although I really should have whipped it longer. I think my keys to success were that I didn't let the cream get too hot prior to adding the chocolate and I kept the mixing bowl in the freezer before the final whipping. I did need to work fast to assemble it and used cardboard to keep the filling from spilling out since I didn't whip it up enough, but it set nicely in the fridge & is delicious & beautiful! Give it a try!

Excellent! Made this for an office party and people were licking their plates. Very rich, but otherwise good. I left out the coffee and substituted Chambord for the rum. The cake and filling were perfect for me and I had none of the problems that other reviewers had. For those who had problems with the filling, I found from making other whipped ganaches that the secret is to have them VERY COLD. I usually make it one evening and let it chill overnight or longer. Also having a good stand mixer helps. Will definitely make again.

Rating: 4
Fabulous recipe, but unlike previous reviewers, I had no trouble with the filling, but DID have a problem with the cake. I think the key to the filling must be as someone else stated, to not let the heavy cream come to a boil. I only had to beat it for about 2 minutes before it became thick. The cake, however, sunk in the middle, making it very difficult to cut 2 good layers. I ended up making 2 cakes, and would definitely make 2 cakes if I do it again . The filling is wonderful, and would make a great eggless mousse filling for any other recipe that calls for a mousse filling.

The cake turned out phenomenal. I made it for a birthday party and had people swooning over it -- surprisingly, it wasn't overpoweringly rich, in fact several people had seconds! Note to other residents of warm climates: refrigerate until the last possible second or the thick mousse filling will start to collapse...

I've made this cake three times since finding the recipe in November 2003. A great hit with everyone - office, family and friends. I made two cakes and split them in half to get the extra height. It was a show stopper. I also used the filling to frost the cake entirely so I didn't have any filling left over. The syrup is an absolute must in terms of moistness and taste. I also used Grand Marnier instead of Rum - personal preferance.

I really enjoyed the challenge of this recipe. I made it in a 9.5 in springform and as a result the cake portion of the recipe should have been doubled (at this point what's a few more calories?). Next time I would let the filling come up to close to room temperature before I whipped it to make it more spreadable, but otherwise, no problems. I made it as a birthday cake and decorated it with small dollops of whipped cream around the edge then topped the dollops with whole strawberries. The result was very appealing to the eye and very pleasing to the palate. Soooo elegant, it made the birthday girl feel very special.

This dessert is certainly decadent, but a wonderful treat. Cake part was light and delicate, good contrast to the filling. I am not a chocolate expert, but I do know from bitter experience that chocolate will exact revenge if not handled properly. Use good quality only! Chop chocolate by hand with a large, sharp knife not in food processor. I think the trick for the filling is in chocolate chemistry. In this recipe, it must keep its so-called "temper". If the chocolate is heated too high it will loose its temper (you might too) and not recrystallize (set) properly when the filling is cooling. The cream should be just hot enough to melt the chocolate - and if the chololate is good quality that is not very hot. So, just barely steaming cream. My filling was already quite pudding-like even before beating. It did not gain any volume during beating and firmed up in less than a minute. I think I even may have overbeat, it started to curdle just ever so slightly! But delicious and definately a keeper. Just 3 forks because of the work involved, but good recipe even for non-bakers.

I tried this recipe for Christmas dinner, was really great. Had some left over,and was even better after it refrigerated for 2 days. Word of advice, to make it thicken better cut filling recipe in half,and add 3/4 of a package of instant chocolate pudding mix. Also I put maraschino cherries sliced in half on top to make it more presentable, and added great to the overall taste.

I wish I'd read the reviews before I made this because I would have done what the posters suggested rather than slavishly follow the directions. YOU MUST BEAT THE FILLING MUCH LONGER THAN THE DIRECTIONS SAY, unless you have an incredibly powerful beater. You have to treat it like it's whipped cream (which it basically is) and whip it until it's stiff, not just "thick" (I also had leftover filling). This took me about 4-5 minutes, after putting on some filling initially that was way too soft and ran over the sides. As a result, the cake was not so pretty. But it is scrumptious, and I'd definitely make it again. I'd have given this a 4 if it weren't for that serious fault in the directions.

I followed your recipe exactly, but I used a spring form pan instead of the square one you specified. The cake and filling were delicious, but there is a definite problem with the recipe. According to your description, the filling should have been 1 inch high, and according to your photograph, the color of the filling was that of dark chocolate. My filling, which was never thick enough, was at least 3 inches high, and much lighter in color than your photo. I believe that there is a mistake in the recipe. If I make this cake again, I will use one half the amount of cream you specified. That way, it will be thick, the amount will be correct, and the color will be the same as yours. I think you should make this cake again. There has got to be a reason why so many readers said the filling was excessive and too runny.

I, too, had my filling smoosh out all the over the place. In desperation, I scraped it back into the bowl, added 1 1/2 tsp. gelatin dissolved in some hot cream, and then poured the filling into the 9" square pan lined with saran wrap. I refrigerated this until firm, then unmolded it and placed it between the cake layers. It worked, although wasn't very pretty. The flavor is wonderful and it is VERY rich.

We made this for Christmas dessert and was a bit of a disaster. The filling never stiffened up enough and as a result it oozed everywhere. Perhaps beating the filling longer would make it stiffer.

This cake was superb and worth the effort....several steps, but not difficult. I found the recipe to work perfectly, without tweaking. I did substitute 1/2 the semisweet chocoate with bittersweet chocolate--just a personal preference.

My cake could have been the picture in the magazine!

The taste of this cake was fantastic. Served on Christmas and everyone loved it. Unfortunately, it was a nightmare to split the thin 9 x 9 cake and worse to try and flip it over.

Since I received rave reviews of the taste, I will try it again with the changes above.

I used a 9in spring form pan (instead of the 9x9 square) and found the cake to be too thin. I also found I needed to beat the filling for a lot more than the 1 minute called for, but once the cream "whipped up" the filling became nice and firm. I would suggest scaling back the filling by 3/4.

I too thought the filling for this cake was a little runny. One remedy was to put a little of the filling on and let that firm up then add another layer-this worked very well, although time consuming. The ratio of cake to filling was off, but guests didn't seem to mind-very decadent.

Rating: 3
I had the same problem as two of the reviewers - too much filling, and it was not thick enough (initially). The filling did finally thicken about 10 minutes or more after I beat and attempted to add to the bottom layer. It was extremely frustrating as I, too, definitely followed the recipe to the letter. If there is a required "waiting period" after one beats the chilled filling, the recipe should have said so! I also found the cake layers to be rather thin compared to the filling and glaze. It is a very tasty dessert. I might make it again, although I'd probably be more apt to use the filling and glaze (whether together or separately) for other desserts.

This would have gotten 3 forks if the filling hadn't been runny and thin. Why didn't it ever thicken? I checked the recipe 3 times but I followed it to the letter. This morning, I had to add some more melted butter and chocolate in the hopes that it would solidify when I put it back in the fridge. I let it refrigerate for another 6 hours but ended up adding a whole box of confectioners sugar in order to get it to firm up (tastes okay but a little too sweet for me). I'm following the previous reviewer's advice and am putting the cake back in the baking pan in order to make sure the filling stays in place. Very disappointing because all the components taste good.

Although it tasted wonderful, I couldn't get the filling the thicken at all! It was a soupy mess. I even had to put it back in the pan to assemble it so it wouldn't be all over the place.

This was a Christmas party "show off" dish. Recipe initally sounded very difficutlt, but surprisingly fun to make. Allow enough time to do all steps unrushed. Thought ammount of mousse was way too much, and needed to beat longer than the minute called for. My garnish choice was marachino cherries, chocolate truffle curls, and fresh mint (very Christmasy). Definitely a special occasion fun "challenge" cake, good way to get invited back to future parties!
