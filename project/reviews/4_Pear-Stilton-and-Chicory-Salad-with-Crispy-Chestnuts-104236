excellent! it even stands up to substitutions: subbing half apple and half peach for the pear, mostly seasoned rice vinegar and a little balsamic for the sherry vinegar, and danish blue for the stilton still led to deliciousness. a tip: use prepared chestnuts (vacuum-packed or in a jar) to save yourself some time. i also thought it'd be better to thrown the shallots in with the chestnuts to cook them; i doubled them as a result. might've been good raw in the dressing instead, but perfectly good and sweet as made. (fyi, we also crumbled morningstar farms veggie bacon onto the finished salad--a lot of other chicory recipes pair the green with bacon and mustard--but i thought it overpowered the other flavours.) delicious!

I made this for our dinner group when the theme was "English Food" and it was a hit. One suggestion: make extra dressing -- I didn't think there was enough in the original recipe.

Yummo!Really tasty flavors. I've made this for the last two Thanksgivings. Even salad haters loved it. The cheese and chestnuts give them what they don't usually get in a salad - fat and flavor.

Very unusual dish. I tossed the salad about an hour before it was served and the flavors were absolutely delicious together.

Wonderful combination of ingredients. Nice way to use chestnuts during the holidays.
