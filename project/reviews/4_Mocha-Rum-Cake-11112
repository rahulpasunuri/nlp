This cake was a huge hit and I will make it again. I did replace some of the coffee with Kahlua, but otherwise made it as written. I didn't have any trouble getting it out of the bundt pan.

Great but definitely needs less baking time, it was done at 1:40. I added 1 T orange peel and substituted 1/2 cup coffee with Kalua. The dark rum was artisanal rum, it really added a punch. My son was so happy with his BD cake he took several slices to freeze for future enjoyment.

Delicious, very moist and dense cake that would be perfect for a Christmas party. I increased the rum as suggested and it was way too strong the first day (more like an after dinner drink than cake), but mellowed after being wrapped in plastic in the refrigerator overnight. Instant coffee made it easy to control the strength of coffee flavor (2X suggested). Instead of a bundt pan, I decreased the quantity by 1/3 and baked it in a sheet cake pan (too runny for springform), cut it in half, and stacked the layers to make an attractive square layer cake. It was delicious filled with cream cheese mixed with whipped topping.

I have made this recipe at least four times and it is always a hit. I am a bit of a chocoholic and add more chocolate. I have always enjoyed reading reviews and have really benfited from them, so I wanted share this: Bakers Joy! I got some on sale and used it on my bundt pan this time. The cake slid out flawlessly. Hope this is helpful.

This was good. Very tender and moist, but not enough rum flavor. Nearly impossible to get out of the pain (took me 10 mins with a lot of coaxing from a butter knife).

This cake is delicious as is with just a hint of rum flavor. There was extra batter when I used my bundt pan. Just be sure to leave about an inch for the cake to rise.

This is the best rum cake! After reading some of the reviews, I used 1 1/3c. rum and 1c. Kahlua. Perfection!

After all of these years and making it dozens of times (first made this in 1996) - I FINALLY found the trick to getting the perfect release - I bought a silicon bundt pan (buttered and cocoaed). Well worth it!

Amazing, moist chocolate cake. I also altered the rum/coffee ratio and used 1 cup dark rum and 1 1/3 cup strong coffee. Glazed it with ganache and served with whipped cream.

Rating: 4
This recipe definitely does not disappoint. Luxurious chocolate cake without the sickeningly sweet overtones. The rum and coffee is perfectly balanced. I tried it with the addition of a java infused rum syrup and spooned that over the already moist cake and vanilla ice cream as just an extra touch of decadence. I also used 1/2 cup of rum and reduced the coffee to balance out the recipe. Make a syrup with 1/2 cup rum, 2 cups sugar, one cup coffee and a T of vanilla, simmer in a pot on the stove until you reach a syrup consistency. You can also add cinnamon, but I did not.

This is a great recipe and very easy to make. I took the advice of many others and increased the rum to 1 cup, and used 1 1/3 cups strong coffee. I also added about 2-3 extra ounces of chocolate, which gave it a little extra oomph. It turned out great!

Hey y'all....ever heard of Baker's Joy? It's a spray-on like Pam but with flour. I read that so many people had trouble getting it out, and mine practically fell out, all of its Bundt indentures in tact! I was pretty liberal spraying it on and was sure to get the cone all the way around. I had only an 8-cup Bundt pan and so multiplied all the ingredients by 2/3 or .66. I also used Bob's Red Mill All-Purpose Gluten-Free flour and 2 t of xanthan gum. Cake turned out just the slightest bit dry. I baked for 1:54 and would probably take it down to 1:45 next time. Still, it was yummy, especially with a cup of coffee! Wasn't satisfied with simple sugar glaze I found somewhere but felt buttercream would be too heavy. Guess I'll try the recommended whipped cream in the morning when I have my next slice!

Rating: 4
I followed the advice of others and substituted espresso for the coffee and used 1 cup of room instead of just 1/3. The result was a not-too-sweet, perfectly moist cake that my friends raved about. When I try this again I might make a glaze to add a little bit of sweetness without losing the edge of the espresso and rum. Another baker mentioned that her 12 cup bundt pan overflowed, but I did not have any problem with my 12 cup bundt pan.

cake was excellent increased amt of rum and decreased coffee slightly. i think the whipped cream doesn't do it justice. it tastes excellent with the mocha buttercream recipe on this website

Rating: 4
Scrumptious! I too upped the rum to 1 cup and substituted expresso for coffee but left the dry ingredients as listed. I was worried because the batter was quite runny but the slow and lengthy baking time resulted in a dense, moistt and - have I mentioned SCRUMPTIOUS - cake. The only thing I found is that the cake is not sweet at all, which is not a bad thing. Just not expected. Whipped cream definitely helps but next time I think I'll make a coconut glaze or frosting.

Have been making this for years...can't believe I never reviewed it. Made exactly as written. Not too sweet, sophisticated, a real winner. Can make in advance, wrap well and keep chilled if you don't have enough freezer space.

I made this over memorial day weekend for my mother in law while she was in town. After reading all the reviews I decided to make just a few changes (I always follow these exactly as is the first time). I used 1 1/3 cup dark rum, 1 cup kahula and 1 T. espresso powder. Baked for 1 hour 40 minutes. Could have baked for full bake time. Came our really moist! Let set for 25 min in pan before turning out onto cooling rack. really chocolate flavored, some mocha. This cake was a huge hit!

Rating: 4
My guests raved over this recipe and asked if they could pay me to make another one for them. I did two things differently: 1. Used espresso instead of coffee 2. added 1/2 cup rum Oh, and after it was baked we poured about 1/3 cup rum on the serving platter and let it soak it up overnight.

I feel like an idiot.I have 12 cup bundt pan and a much deeper tube pan. I wasn't sure which to put this in and decided to go with the recipie. I even measured 12 cups of water to make sure my bundt pan was the right size. Long story short. Disaster. I should have known better when I poured in the batter and it went right up to the edges. The cake is in the oven right now, massively spilling over the pan. I should have used a MUCH deeper pan, like the tube pan. SO much for 20 dollars worth of chocolate.

Rating: 4
This cake is delicious! One of the moistest cakes I've ever made. My only complaint (which may have been my fault) is that it stuck badly to my bundt pan. But I did not cook it for the full cooking time so maybe that had something to do with it. I also may add a little bit more rum next time...

Rating: 4
I have made this cake at least a dozen times, and it never fails to be a huge success. The only tinkering with the recipe I have done is to occasionally use espresso in place of the coffee, and, because my family is not fond of rum, to substitute Bailey's Irish Creme for the rum. It's a great taste addition.

Rating: 4
Ok - so I took all of the other reviews under advisement and followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT for the rum and coffee. I used 1 1/3 cup of dark rum and 1 cup Kaluha... FABULOUS!! Moist, rich, and amazing flavor! Ate it hot with vanilla ice cream and cold with a confectioner's sugar glaze. Didn't last long, a new favorite in our home!

This cake is fabulous, although it's neither especially rummy or especially mocha-y. Which was fine with me and my guests. It yields a dense, moist, decadent chocolate cake! If you're looking for something 'tipsy,' then you could experiment with drizzling a rum/sugar concoction over the base of the cake while it cools? Or look for a different recipe, perhaps.

I developed a kind of love/hate/love relationship with this cake. Using the suggestion of other reviewers, I changed the ratio of rum/coffee to favor the rum (1 cup). When pouring the cake into the pans, I couldn't stop sneaking a taste of the batter: it was amazing (maybe that was all the uncooked rum talking?). The cake fell somewhat during baking, and then again when cooling (some of the hate in our relationship). Getting one of two cakes out of their loaf pans was also really tricky (a little more hate), and all of this resulted in a pretty compromised presentation, had I wanted to show off the loaf to my guests. I ended up slicing the cake, poundcake style, and serving it with homemade whipped cream and a little raspberry reduction. It tasted wonderful and looked pretty good by that point, too. I fell back in love with the final product, though my husband said he thought the rum was overpowering and would have preferred mocha. I think the recipe is worth trying again, but I'll keep tinkering.

Rating: 4
This was an easy cake recipe, moist and rich. I used an Austrian Rum (Stroh 120) that is traditionally used with chocolate which gave plenty of flavor with the 1/3 cup. I also used extracted Espresso, but would like to try coffee licquor in the future to get more coffee flavor.

Rating: 3
Well, I can barely detect the rum and I can't taste the coffee at all, however, I must say this is the most moist chocolate cake I've ever made. And, it's just the right amount of chocolatey-ness, not a overpowering, cloying chocolatey-ness. Very good.

Rating: 4
This was awesome! I took the advice of other reviewers and changed the liquid to: 2 cups rum (silver) and 1/3 cup fresh espresso. I baked this in two standard size loaf pans for about 1 hour 40 minutes. They both came out of the non-stick pans perfectly - I heavily buttered them in preparation. This is now my other chocolate cake! I like how easy this was to make, and the loaf shape can be quite elegant depending upon how you dress it up! I loved this!!! My husband, thought a light sprinkle of even more rum on the top after baking might be good, but I am not so sure. I think I might try whipped cream with a bit of rum on it.

This recipe is great. I'm not big baker and more than often my baking projects turn out disastrous, but this one was a gem. I did modify the recipe and subbed out 1 cup of coffee with 1 cup coffee liquor and went heavy on the rum. Baked in a snowflake shaped cake mold and it popped right out no problem. Very moist.

recipe was a winner, adjusted recipe by using 1 cup of meyers dark rum and 1+1/3 cup coffee. Cake was ready in 90 minutes. I had no problem removing cake from bundt pan but I used real cocoa powder and didn't remove any excess, I let it cool on a rack and it popped right out. the taste was fantastic. I would definitely make this again and again!

I followed the recipe exactly and the cake turned out fabulous. Amazing flavors. I used a well buttered bundt pan with lots of indentations, and the cake fell out easily. I have a convection oven, so it cooked in 1 Hr and 41 minutes. Used Cruzan dark rum, and didn't taste much rum at all. I may use another rum next time, or increase the volume slightly.

Rating: 4
I made this recipe as written and it was EXCELLENT! Some people had a problem with this recipe, but I suspect it's because they made alterations. Changing a baking recipe that works can be risky, because you are messing with the chemistry, not just flavors. I might add some rum/rum extract and sweetener... or coffee liquor... to the whipping cream instead, if I wanted to add a little something.

Rating: 3
It TASTES delicious, and it has only been about 4 hours since I baked the cake! (I did 1.5 cups rum and 1 cup coffee. Can't wait till tomorrow...) I give 3 forks because not only did the cake stick to the pan, but half of it fell apart on me once it was outside the pan. It was also really crumbly (moist, but annoyingly crumbly, if that makes sense) when i tried to salvage the other half by cutting off the unpretty parts with an electric knife. I baked for 1 hour and 40 minutes. What happened??? Hope it turns out better next time!

A wonderfully moist and dense chocolate cake. I followed the recipe almost exactly as directed, except changing the 1/3 C of rum to 1/2 since everyone said you really couldn't taste the rum. I think I would just follow the original recipe since I definitely could taste the rum (not the coffee, though). This is going to be my go-to chocolate cake recipe henceforth!

Rating: 4
Made this cake with the following modifications: used 2 1/3 c dark rum and 2 T instant espresso powder in lieu of 2 c brewed coffee and 1/3 c rum. All other ingredients and directions followed faithfully. Cake was a major success: tasty, moist, rich but not overly fudgy or cloying. As suggested, I served with plain whipped cream. As you might expect, with 2 1/3 c rum the rum flavor was strong but not overpowering. My guests raved about this cake and demanded the recipe. A real keeper!

I live at 3500 feet which is enough to throw off almost all of my baking recipes. I made this cake the first time without any changes for altitude. What a disaster!!! But what I was able to salvage was delicious. The next time, I simply halfed the entire recipe (except on eggs, I used two) and it came out perfectly. It is a wonderful cake which baked in 1 hour 20 minutes.

Rating: 3
This is absolutely, bar none, the moistest cake I have ever made, if I can even call it cake! It wasn't dense like fudge, but it didn't have the crumb texture of cake. Sort of like a light mud pie. I think cooking it at 300 degrees and for so long -- though I only cooked it for about 1 hour and 30 minutes, and the middle was really gooey and fudgey, just how I like it -- is a great idea because it makes the cake really fine and smooth. I was a bit surprised that the rum and coffee flavors were much more subtle that I thought. Maybe the cooking took away the flavor somewhat? Or just because it cooked for so long? A divine combination of flavors, though. I made a basic chocolate cream cheese frosting and chocolate sauce so my family could put what they wanted on top. SO RICH -- I could barely finish mine and I'm usually the one finishing off others' dessert!

Yum! I made this recipe exactly as written, using my brand new Christmas gift "Cathedral" bundt pan. Beautiful! Folks at work loved it, and it was breathtaking with lots of 10-X sugar sprinkled all over it. Even better the third day. It's in my favorites file now and forever.

Rating: 3
I followed the recipe exactly, since several of the reviewers suggested doing so. Instead of making this in a bundt pan, I used 2 9" round pans, and watched it carefully. My only suggestion would be this: you cannot over-butter the baking dish; I used non-stick and it STIll stuck. I think this could be easily fixed by putting the baked cake, tin and all, into the refrigerator overnight, or at least 6 hours. What needs to happen is the butter needs to return to a solid state, in order to release from the pan; room temperature cooling will not work for that. Otherwise, this cake is fantastic.

Rating: 4
Do not adjust this recipe until you have fully prepared it once. Batter that seems too thin at pouring firms up to moist, ideal consistency upon baking. My concept of an excellently balanced recipe is one in which the ingredients don't try to shout over each other, i.e., you can't really tell what the individual components are. What you get here is a luxuriously complex chocolate sensory experience. The rum and coffee are there for the added dimensions they give to the chocolate. Use a Jamaican dark rum (like Myers).

Like I have Emailed my family about this cake, It is awesome!! I have a few choice chocolate cake recipes that I have used for 30 years and did not think I would discover another an additional one. However this one goes right to the top of my list. Just two comments; I needed to bake the cake 20 minutes more than suggested. I checked it every 5 minutes and when the cake pulled away from the pan, I knew it was done. After following the original recipe, I made another cake using 1 cup of rum. In a word: "Delicious."

Rating: 3
This was SO GOOD!!!! This will now be on my list of regulars. As previous reviewer said don't mess with the ratio of liquids etc. Baking is actually quite scientific. I put in 2C of rum (mainly because that was all I had) 1/3 C of water mixed with 2 heaping TBSP of instant espresso powder. Perfect!!!! I made the cake 2 days ahead and I think that let the rum flavor intensify to perfection. Do let it come to room temperature before you serve, I took mine right out of the fridge and it was a little to firm. Great rich dense cake!

Excellent flavor and aromas. Very moist and chocolatey.

This is really a great recipe. I read all the reviews and figured out what was happening. Most of the cooks were adding more liquid and then adding more flour to compensate, which is wrong, because your flour/eggs/sugar/fat ratio is off. Keep the liquids to 2 1/3 cups as the recipe says. If you like the strong rum taste, use 2 1/3 cups rum and no coffee, just add instant expresso powder instead (about a heaping tablespoon). You can play with the ratio of rum/water/espresso powder to your liking. Also, if you cut the recipe in half (use 2 eggs), it will bake perfectly in a 9 x 5 loaf pan. Try 325 degrees for about an hour. Trust me, it will be perfect.

Brock from Calgary made this for me and it's wonderful, I have since made it many times to huge raves. I serve it with lots of whip cream and chopped skor pieces. I also increase the alcohol content and have substitued kaluha or amaretto when out of rum. Always fantastic, just increase the flour to your alcohol increase. The cake is heavy and very intense.

I made this recipe for my sister-in-law's birthday as she requested a rum or a chocolate cake. I also followed Tim's variations to originial recipe. But I had to add almost 2 1/2 cups extra flour before the batter was the right consistency. I think it depends on if your espresso is hot as mine was. The batter filled a traditional (read-- small) bundt pan and made a dozen cupcakes. I served it with whipped cream flavored with 2 ounces of the rum. I used Captian Morgan's Spiced Rum. We tended to notice that when eating the cake you cannot taste the rum if you are also consuming a rum beverage! ;) Also I never could taste the mocha although other people could. Definitely make it again!!

This is the only cake I have made for which my daughter now begs for instead of dairy queen ice cream cake on her birthday!. Kids and adults alike will beg for more...a must try. If you can Callebaut Chocolate, for sure it is the best(you are welcome Bernard!)and Calgary is its home! The extra rum is great and the only additional advice is be careful not to over cook or it gets dry, and oozy is better!

Followed suggestions by Tim from Edgewood, WA: used 2 cups rum total and offset it by 1.5 cups of flour (the batter seemed too runny w/ just 1 additional cup). Since I served this at an office party, I bypassed any additional glaze or topping and just sprinkled w/ powdered sugar. All turned out well and the cake was quickly devoured!

Rating: 3
After reading the reviews I too increased the rum to 2c. For a more intense coffee flavor I added 4 shots of espresso (2c). I also creamed the butter/sugar. I wound up adding about 1c more flour to compensate for the extra liquid. I baked it at 325 for 1h 20m. The cake neither fell nor stuck to the pan. Mine turned out quite heavy and very RICH. The flavors were very intense. Fresh whipped cream topping complimented it quite well.

The cake was very good, but it tasted like chocolate cake, not rum cake. Next time I will take the advice of another cook and add more rum. It also needed a sauce drizzled over it to give it a little pizzazz. I will definitely make it again, with the above changes.

I love this recipe! i doubled the amount of rum, and to give it a little more kick i used half coconut rum and half dark rum (bacardi 151). i increased the amount of flour by 1/2 cup to compensate for the extra alcohol, and it's much more of a solid cake. I also added 1/4 tsp of almond extract because I love what almond does for chocolate. The first friends i served it to didn't quite like it with the whipped cream, so I made my own chocolate glaze with a little bit of kahlua for kick. The second set of friends didn't leave a trace of the cake!

I have only a 6-cup bundt pan (you guys must cook for an army! 12 cup bundt pan? Wow!) so I had to cut the recipe in half. (Don't ask how one cuts three eggs in half; I used two and added 1/4 cup more flour.) I followed everyone's suggestions: more rum; dusted with lots of cocoa. No sticking! And it is just delicious!

Trouble removing cakes from pans? ALWAYS DOUBLE FLOUR THE PAN or in the case of this recipe, DOUBLE COCOA THE PAN. After greasing the pan, flour it, tap out the excess flour, wait 5 MINUTES, then flour the pan again and tap out the excess. You should have no problems with sticking.

Rating: 3
I've made this cake several times, but this last time I changed the proportion of rum to coffee. Although I like a strong "mocha" taste, I like the rum even better, so I used 1 C. of rum, and 1 1/3 C. of coffee. It was much richer. Also, I reduced the cooking time to 1 hr 30 minutes and the cake was a lot moister. I agree with previous chefs about not cooling completely in the pan.

This cake is very easy to make. DO NOT let it cool completely in the pan, or it will not come out. I took it out of the pan when it was cool enough to hold in my hands. Use a strong coffee (I didn't- and I could barely taste the coffee). The cake has a nice texture and tastes good refrigerated the next day.

Totally intense!!! One of my all-time favorite cakes for the consummate chocoholic. As it's also very easy, I make it often. I agree with the comments about chocolate and coffee choices.

My favorite cake - I've made it a dozen times, and everybody loves it. I serve it with rum whipped cream (mix powdered sugar and rum to taste into cream while whipping) to enhance the flavor of the cake. I use Ghiradelli chocolate and strong Peet's (or Starbuck's) coffee - it makes a difference.
