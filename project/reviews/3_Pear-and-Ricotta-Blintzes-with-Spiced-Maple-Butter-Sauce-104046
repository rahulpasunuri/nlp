I made this recipe with canned pears to save time. This was wonderful. We tried several toppings - the maple sauce was way too sweet. Rasberry jam was great. Simple sugar & cinnamon was really nice too. Skip the maple sauce and try it. It's very good.

I grew up in a french family making crepes so I had no problem with the amount of work involved. The batter, however, was much heavier in eggs than it needed to be. Also, the delicate flavoring of the rum, currants and pears just didn't agree with my fond rustic memories of german blintz.

For all those folks who have made this and complained about the prep time, I would guess that you've never made crepes before. I found that the time and effort it took was expected and was well worth the effort as with many other types of crepes. I served this recipe for Christmas breakfast. Everybody loved it. The crepes were tender, and the filling was delicious. To counteract the very sweet sauce, I finished each blintz with a dollop of sour cream on top of the sauce. Very, very nice!

Got outstanding reviews from my whole family for Easter Brunch, but it was VERY time consuming to make. I don't usually mind the prep time if it's good, but I've made better recipes in less time.

Made this for Christmas morning. Although due to the lengthy preparation time (plan to make the crepes ahead) we ate it for brunch rather than breakfast, it was worth the effort. (Note that apples work as well as pears)

Nice dish for brunch, once we got down the crepe-making tasks, was fairly easy. Got very good reviews from my Christmas day guests. Would make it again. The recipe seems to make way too much filling for the number of crepes I got....
