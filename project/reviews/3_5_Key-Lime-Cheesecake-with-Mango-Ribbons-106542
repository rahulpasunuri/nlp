This was delicious and on the lighter fluffier side for cheesecake. Many people asked for the recipe when I brought it to a pot luck dinner. The mango ribbons add a lot of work, and the pie is superb even without them. So if you want an easier pie, skip the mangoes and just serve with whipped cream.

My husband made this for my birthday when we first got married. Everyone I make this for asks for the recipe - it is delicious! I've made it with bottled juice. Perfect amount of tartness. Wish I had a piece right now.

From the cheesecake perspective, this is great. I was really pumped at the thought of the mangos on top, but ... it was not what I imaagined. A tropical fruit medly of sorts across the top might be a neat twist. I'll continue to make and enjoy this and see what changes I can do to better tune it to my taste. More if anything noteworthy develops! ~ Cheers ~ NCF

I've made many cheesecakes over the years and this is not a traditional cheesecake. It doesn't have the height or texture of a New York Style cheesecake. It's more like a Key Lime Cheese Pie. If I were to make it again I would make it in a large pie plate rather than a springform pan. It had a good flavor, but definitely wasn't a cheese cake in the traditional sense of the word.

I used fresh key limes and a prepared Keebler crust. We're not that fond of mangoes so I made a sour cream topping. It was very tart and refreshing, light and creamy, delicious! Thanks to suggestions on this site I used a garlic press for the limes. That was brilliant!

My review of 4 forks is based on prevous suggestions and my own additions. I borrowed some ideas also from the Key Lime Cheesecake recipe also on this site, Bon Appetit Oct 2006. This is the wonderful cheesecake I made, to raves from my July 4 guests: Crust: 1.5 cups graham cracker crumbs; 3 T sugar; pinch of salt; 1 stick of butter (melted and cooled.) Filling: 16 oz softened cream cheese; 1 cup sugar; 3/4 cup lime juice (I used a combination of bottled and freshly-squeezed); 1/2 cup sour cream; 1/2 tsp vanilla; 3 T flour; 1/8 tsp salt; 3 large eggs; 2 T grated lime rind. I used a no-bake topping of creme fraiche spread on after the cheesecake had been refrigerated overnight, and I garnished the topping with a little more grated rind. The flavor of this cheesecake was refreshingly lime-y, tart, but still with sweetness. The creme fraiche, slightlysour in taste, was a wonderful enhancement. I baked it in a 10" springform pan because I wanted more individual servings. Because my larger springform pan wouldn't fit inside any other pans I had, I wrapped it in several layers of aluminum foil and baked it on a middle rack in a slower oven of 325 degrees. In this larger pan it was done in under an hour (50-55 minute) and the texture was very very creamy. Refrigerating overnight is very important.

Most cheesecake recipes include the instruction to refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight. I did that, even though the recipe didn't mention it, and mine came out firm enough to slice. I also didn't make the cream topping, just garnished with a little fresh fruit. However, I didn't at all like the texture of the cheesecake itself--it wasn't as smooth and creamy as I prefer and as I have found with other recipes. Perhaps not enough sour cream? Key lime flavor was good and I used bottled key lime juice. I will not make again; if I'm going to offer a rich dessert I want it to be perfect and worth the calories.

Excellent Cheesecake. I also skipped the mangos and used blueberries, raspberries and sliced strawberries for the top. I also doubled the cream topping. Definately a keeper.

This cheesecake is wonderful. I substituted low-fat sour cream because it's what I had on hand. I also didn't make the mango ribbons. The cheesecake had a wonderful tangy flavor with just the right amount of sweetness. I used Nellie & Joe's Key West Lime Juice. I refrigerated over-night before serving. Several people said it was better than the Cheesecake Factory version.

I made the cheesecake and crust exactly according to the recipe, and substituted raspberries for the mango ribbons. It got rave reviews from everyone, and I received several requests to make it again. The only drawback is juicing all those little key limes!

Loved this cheesecake! Like many reviewers, I skipped the mangoes and served with fresh strawberries and blueberries on the side instead. I varied the crust, using half graham crackers and half ginger snaps, and only baked the crust for 5 minutes. It was a little tough, so next time I will try it for four minutes. I used bottled key lime juice I found in the liquor dept. at the grocery store. Didn't have any problems with the cake being undone in the center. Made it the night before and served the next day. Easy recipe, fantastic results. I highly recommend it!

I love this recipe - it has become my standard cheesecake recipe and is very popular with all who try it. I usually use less sugar in it because I don't like things too sweet but it still works well. Be sure to try it!

I made this cheesecake for son's 20th birthday. He loves key lime pie. It was fabulous and I should have made two. The only trouble I had was with slicing the mango. I like mango when its ripe and sweet, which made it hard to slice with my mandolin. Had to resort to a peeler. The curls wer not as perfect as I would have liked but the taste was perfection!

I found this recipe to be a fabulous dessert. It received many compliments and while actions speak louder than words, it was gone within a day, so I guess it really was a hit. I made one revision as I'm not the worlds biggest mango fan, I decided to make a lime curd for the top of the cheesecake instead. Wow, what a great addition and gave it a real lime kick! A little whipped cream and this is a gem to add to any dessert list. Enjoy!

Rating: 1
Decided to try this because of all the rave reviews and found it to be nothing special at all. Took forever to juice enough key limes and still didn't find it tangy enough for my liking. The only bonus about this cheesecake is the texture---I made it the night before and let it sit in the fridge for 24 hours before serving----was perfect. Took another's suggestion and added a handful of coconut to the crust and regretted it. I will definitely keep searching for a better key lime cheesecake. Don't waste your time with this one.

Followed recipe, but used excellent bottled key lime juice. Although it was well received I found it was too tart and the cheesecake did not set properly. If I do make it again I would read others suggestions on alterations.

I absolutely will make this again! I made it individual style in the muffin tins, with a home-made graham cracker crust. It was sooo good. Being that this if February, in Ohio, my mango selection was not at its peak, so I diced the mango and sprinkle it around the cheesecakes and did a lime twist over the top of the cakes. Guests loved it, husband loved it, I cant wait to make it again.

Fabulous! I followed the recipe fairly closely. My notes: 1) added ground almonds to crust 2) reduced the amount of lime juice by a couple of tbsp, 3) increased the amount of flour for a total of 3 tbsp (after reading some reviews that the cake did not set), 4) used a very thick brand of sour cream 5) used low fat cream cheese 6) refrigerated cake for almost 2 days before serving. 7) didn't do the mango topping It could have been a bit more tart IMO but maybe it made a difference that I used regular limes, not key limes. Lovely creamy texture & consistency. I served it with a blueberry sauce but next time I would make a blueberry coulis instead. My friend who tasted it said it was better than what you would get in most restaurants. Definitely a keeper.

I thought this cheesecake was wonderful. I added a handful of macadamia nuts and shredded coconut to the food processor when making the crumb crust (as per prior reviewers) and that really made a difference in flavor that was great with the tart filling. I cut back the lime juice in the filling by a tablespoon or so and baked it slightly longer than the recipe calls for, and the filling was a nice, dense consistency with a perfectly tart flavor without being overwhelmingly so. Also, I topped the cheesecake with sliced kiwis rather than the mangos (not a favorite at my house) and the flavors went together nicely. DO make the additions in the crust for a really great dessert.

Rating: 2
Rather than the mango ribbons and regular whipped cream, I topped this with candied lime zest and white chocolate whipped cream. Although the cheesecake was well-received, I found it to be too tart and rather gooey, making it hard to cut. Juicing the key limes was very hard work even with a reamer. In all, not really worth the effort.

Rating: 4
I made this for my husband who wanted a key lime cheesecake for his birthday. He loved it!! He wants me to make it all the time. The only thing I changed was added key lime zest. This makes the taste of key lime even better, about 2 tsp or more if you like more. And I didn't do the toppings the first time but will buy lite coolwhip for more flavor.

This is a great cheesecake - light, creamy, and tangy. I was happy to find key limes, but next time I make it I will be getting a juicer (squeezing by hand is hard work & I didn't know those limes were so small). I'm not a big fan of mangos so I used strawberries - thought it was great. I took this to work to share and everyone who was able to get a piece loved it - they couldn't say enough good things about it. Cheesecake is a great way to meet people in a new office. This is definitely a keeper for my recipe file.

Very delicious and a real crowd pleaser. I did not have key limes, so used fresh standard limes. Instead of the mango ribbons I made raspberry coulis, which was easy and quite complimentary to the lime. I will absolutely make this cheesecake again.

Awesome recipe, & very adaptable - I made a more or less low-carb version for my father's birthday by substituting ground almonds for graham cracker crumbs, & Splenda for the sugar. Also skipped the mangoes & replaced them with fresh strawberries.

Wow! This turned out really great. I skipped the mango as well but the cheesecake and the key lime whipped cream was awsome on it's own. It's smooth and creamy and very simple to make. The flavor is awsome. I got rave reviews from all of my guests who insist that I make this again for the 4th of July party next month!

I decided to make this cheesecake after reading all of the reviews. Glad I did. I took one reviewer's suggestions of adding coconut and macadamia nuts to the crust. A nice addition, however, next time I will not bake crust the for as long as the recipe states. It was a little overdone, but no one complained. Otherwise, I followed directions up to the mango ribbon stage. I felt 2 mangos was a bit much, one was plenty. I didn't feel like getting out the mandoline so I used a vegetable peeler -- a pretty good substitute with less equipment to clean. I would not use lime juice on the mango ribbons again. It made them too tart for my taste so I put them on paper towels to soak up some of the juice before placing them on the cake. I, also, sprinkled toasted coconut and macadamia nuts on top of it all. Served with fresh raspberries. Everyone loved it! A nice alternative to key lime pie.

I made this for a dinner party and the result was fantastic! I made the cheesecake two days ahead and refrigerated, as suggested. Followed one reviewer's suggestion and used a purchased Keelber crust as I did not have the time or equipment to make the one in the recipe. I was able to use nearly all of the filling. Used the only brand key lime juice available, Nellie and Joe's. I typically do not sweeten my whipped cream very much, but did with this recipe to help balance the extra tartness of the key lime. The mango ribbons make for a beautiful presentation with very little extra effort and time. Presented the finished product on a clear glass cake stand. Our guests thought it had come from a professional bakery.

This was nice smooth tangy cheesecake. Skipped the mango, didn't have any available and was not interested in the work. I used macadamia nuts and some coconut in the crust and that just rocked. I also added a bit of lime zest in the filling to add some character. It turned out well. My bake time was much shorter due to my convection oven, only 45min. As the top started to become blonde I turned off the oven and then let it cool inside with the door open. It definately needs some chill time. I was able to slice it warm, but it was pretty soft. It's in the fridge right now and it seems to be firming up enough to eat for dessert tomorrow. This recipe will be added to my collection.

Keep it simple! I have made this three times to rave reviews! Use the larger Keebler prepared graham craker pie crust and skip that whole step. (You will throw away about 1/2 c. filling). Bake filling according to directions and refrigerate for several days. Top each slice with a squirt of Reddi-Wip whipped cream and top that with a lemon or lime jellied fruit slice cut in half. Everyone thought I got it at a bakery! Yummy and light!

This is an excellent cheesecake, my guests loved it! It set up beautifully, I didn't have any problems with the filling being runny and I had no problems slicing it. I used 2 1/2 8 oz packets of cream cheese and 3 Tb flour, and had refrigerated it 2 days before serving. I used a gingersnap crust and the flavor really complimented the key lime and the mango, I thought. The mango slivers made for a beautiful presentation, although my husband thought it was tricky to eat. Great recipe!

Oh, Lord, was this a little slice of heaven. This is the first cheesecake I ever made and I couldn't believe how good it was. I skipped the ribbon thing and instead cut up the mango into small chunks and tossed them with the lime and some lime zest. Real purty. Everyone loved it.

Loved this cheesecake. We did not find it to be overwhelmingly tangy as others did. I did add toasted coconut and macadamia nuts to the crust, and saved time by pureeing mango, sugar and lime juice and drizzeling over top with whipped cream. Truly wonderful.

This is a great recipe, but slightly tart (I used fresh key lime juice). Serve it with whipped cream to cut the tartness, and it will be fabulous. When the baking time was up, I took the cake out of the oven despite the fact that the batter was boiling-which made it still seem liquid- but the cake set beautifully even without fridge time.

This recipe looked delicious, and I was encouraged by the reviews. However, when I baked it, it never set. I ended up leaving it in about twice as long as the recipe stated, and it was still totally liquified when I finally gave up and removed it. (Aside from increasing the baking time to try to get it to set, I followed the instructions exactly.) Once I did take it out of the oven, it set up somewhat, although not to the usual consistency of cheesecake. Of course, the crust was so hard by that time that it couldn't be served. The filling tastes really good, but we had to just scoop it out with spoons. For other people who have made it, did you take it out after the stated time, even if it was soupy? If so, did it set up okay after that? The taste is so good that I'd love to make it again, but only if I knew it would actually work this time.

I'm not a big cheesecake fan or key lime fan, but this dessert went with a theme of a dinner party I was giving. It was sooooo good and a big hit with everyone else. It was easy to make and the leftovers went to our church office staff who called to rave about it as well.

Of all the cheesecakes I have made, this is the one and only that I will never make again! If I wanted soup I would have gone to that section of recipies!! Why I thought this would set properly with that much liquid is beyound me. The taste was also way to tart.

Poor me - I couldn't find key lime juice. However, I used regular lime juice and founbd this cheesecake delicious! I just chopped mangoes for the topping, and rather than use cream and sugar, I mixed 2 c. sour cream, 1/4 c. sugar, 1/2 tsp. vanilla, and the lime juice and baked that for 5 minutes on top of the cheesecake after it had cooked through (see the recipe for "Red Berry Cheesecake" which is where I stole it from).

Be careful....this cheesecake is addictive!!!! I love Key Lime pie and I thought this was a wonderful variation of it. I think the amount of key lime juice used in this recipe was not overpowering at all and allowed the desert to still taste like cheesecake. I used bottled juice and didn't think it was too tart at all. I also added a few crushed almonds to the crust which gave each bite a little more something. I cut up the mango, tossed it with some key lime juice and served that alone on the top. My guests actually asked for seconds!

I am a Pastry Chef and made this cheesecake for the restaurant. My garnish is different, I use raspberry coulis, fresh raspberries, and vanilla whipped cream. I also ground up macadamia nuts (not toasted) and mixed it in the crust. Along with the other garnishes, I sprinkled the plate with toasted macadamia nuts. I think I might try incorporating coconut into this dish as well.

Wow! I made this for my husband's birthday and everyone loved it! Some even asked for seconds. It's a great summertime dessert. Squeeze your own key lime juice if you can. I did not top with mango ribbons. Instead I topped with whipped cream, lime zest, and lime wedges. It was fantastic.

I am not much of a baker and rarely make cheesecake so was a little apprehensive about tackling this recipe. Had some bottled key lime juice I bought in Florida (Florida Key West was the brand name) and wanted to try it. Didn't even consider mango ribbons -- don't have a mandoline and the reviewers gave me pause. Followed the directions carefully, baked 1 hour and 10 minutes. Chilled overnight and consistency was excellent. Decorated with thin slices of mango and some fresh strawberry halves in the center. Dinner guests raved about appearance and taste; it wasn't bitter at all. Thanks to other reviewers, I checked the crust prior to 8 minutes to be sure it did not burn.

De-lish!! I used the Key Lime juice from Williams-Sonoma. Since you only use 3/4 C, freeze the rest in a plastic container and save for the next one! I got nervous reading the reviews (about it being too mushy) so I added an extra egg, doubled up on the flour, and after an hour and 5 minutes at 350 on the oven, I baked it an additional 15 minutes at 275 - then let it cool in the oven with the oven door open. I did not add any juice to the whipping cream, but did add more sugar and 2 Tb of clear Vanilla to offset the tartness. I also applied the whipped cream using a pastry bag and coverd the top in stars. Everyone in the office loved it! I will make this again!

I thought the tartness of the lime was offset perfectly by the sweetness of the mangos. I made "petals" of mango using a potato peeler and arranged them on top of the cheesecake. Most excellent!

The cheesecake was a little on the soft side - rather like a cross between Key Lime Pie and cheesecake. Delicious flavour if you like things on the tart side! Disregard your inclination to overcook - it just doesn't get any firmer - rather like my over-40 thighs.

Oops...I had to make it at 5 am and I misread the recipe and used 2 1/2 cups of flour instead of 2 1/2 TBSP...so it had a very strange consistency. Therefore, I *would * make it again, this time, at a more reasonable hour, but....mangoes don't curl. At least the ones in MA don't...so I marinated the mango with the lime juice and a little sugar, strained off the excess liquid after a while, and pureed it and put it on top of the cheesecake. Then I used the whipped cream to just decorate the top...

Yummy cheesecake. I am a lime fanatic, so the tartness doesn't bother me. However, I burned the crust and it was kind of bitter. Yuck! Next time I will not cook the crust beforehand and I might add more sugar to the crust to balance the tartness of the lime. More whipped cream would be good too. Didn't use a mandoline either- I don't trust myself with a mandoline and slippery mangoes! It didn't matter though. The mango was just as good cut up and I added a strawberry in the middle for color. Very pretty.

I made this recipe as an alternate to birthday cake for the adults who attended my daughter's 3rd birthday part recently. It was a smashing success! Since we live in FL, we're all used to Key Lime pie, but combining the tart Key Lime flavor in a cheesecake that wasn't overwhelmingly sweet-fantastic! The only thing I would do differently next time is make 2!

Always said I've never met a cheesecake that I didn't like...until now! Too much egg, not enough cream cheese. The lime was way too sour, I upped the sugar in the whipped cream, which helped, but this was a huge dissapointment. Will definately not make this again. YUCK!

OUT OF CONTROL! Wow! This cheesecake was really something else! I made it for the Jewish holiday of Shavuot on which it is traditional to eat cheesecake.

Mmmmm.... just thinking about it makes my mouth water. I might just have to make this one every year!

I liked the texture of this one quite a lot. I used a 10" springform pan and baked it 1 hour and it was perfect. I sliced the mango and put it a fan design on top.

The only item I changed on this wonderful cheesecake was the crust. I use an almond and zwiebak crust from another recipe, that has become our "crust of choice" for most cheesecakes. We found this cheesecake to be absolutely delightful. Used fresh key limes and I did make the cheesecake a day in advance of the topping. I used a veeerrry sharp knife to slice the mango and had little problem placing them on the top of cheesecake.

This tasted delicious but was too soft, making it hard to slice pretty pieces. Next time I'll make the day before and chill overnight. Also, thinly slicing mangoes is really hard, and then makes it even messier when trying to slice the too-soft cheesecake. I'll puree and fold into the whip cream next time.
