After reviewing the other reviews, I made this recipe with gruyere cheese instead of mozzarella. It added a lot of taste. Several people at the party asked for the recipe!

GREAT!!! I loved this recipie! I love cornbread and this was a great new twist from the original cornbread. I seasoned the tomatoes with salt and pepper like another reviw said, and I added the right amount of fresh parley as well as a frw pinches of dried to give it some more flavor. It made a great presentation and tasted great with the lamb and ratatoui I made!

I was quite disappointed with this recipe. As I'm originally from the south, I was nearly raised on corn bread, and love to experiment with new twists on the old favorite, but this isn't a recipe that I'll bother with again. Quite dry and very little flavor.

I don't make this exactly as written, but the changes make relatively moist standard corn muffins. I omit the parsley, cheese and tomatoes and use veggie oil. I vary whether I use thinned sourcream or plain yogurt or buttermilk. This recipe makes 12 muffins that are simple and extra good with honey. They bake in about 15 minutes.

I thought the recipe was basicaly a good one. I found that shredding the mozzarella instead of cubing it helped the cheese to melt evenly. I also added more spice in the form of a little salt and pepper on the tomatoes before incorporating them into the batter. My boyfriend and his friend liked it and it went well with the roast chicken I made. Just needs a little more zing! :)

No taste at all. I added a few more herbs but no difference. It missed salt to bring forth the flavour. I wont waste my time again. I wasted alot of cheese.

This was very good, but I made a few changes. In a pinch, I used dried parsley flakes vs. fresh Italian. I also added a few shakes of Italian-blend seasoning, which might have counteracted the blandness the previous reviewer noted. Try to eat it all on the first day -- it got soggy by day two.

I was a bit disappointed with this dish. It was bland even though I added extra parsley. If I were to try it again, I would add cilantro instead of parsley for more flavor. But, I would save the time and effort spent making it and just by a French bread or Italian loaf.
