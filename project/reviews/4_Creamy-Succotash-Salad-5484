I wait until I can get fresh corn and lima beans for this salad. I also char and peel my red pepper like another person. This is a great summer salad. And yes even lima bean people are won over. I don't normally use all the dressing and I wait to dress it until just before serving. I think it tastes fresher. It's still good the next day.

A very nice summer salad. The dressing was too sweet, next time I will leave out the sugar.

This is such a nice change from potato salad or macaroni salad at a summer barbecue. I use one red pepper and one orange pepper if I can find it. I char the peppers under the broiler than put them in a paper bag until I can peel them. I'm sure it's just as good with a raw pepper, but I like it better with roasted peppers. Besides that--the recipe is perfect.

I love this recipe. I have made it many times over the years for family barbecues. You don't have to be afraid of the lima beans--it is delicious and very pretty.

I thought this was very good and easy. I used fresh baby lima beans, which added a bit of time, but really are worth it.

Made this for a birthday barbecue. Was a perfect compliment to turkey burgers and drunken baked beans. Loved the colors and the dressing. Would definitely use this as an alternative to the same-old, boring macaroni salad.

This refreshing, delicious recipe has become a summer favorite of our family, even winning over the 'non-lima' people.
