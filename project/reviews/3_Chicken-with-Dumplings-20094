Seattle's dumplings are amazing. Light and fluffy. The buttermilk gives them a delicious flavor. I haven't made my grandmother's recipe since trying this version.

My Grandma was a German dumpling making machine. However, she never recorded any of her recipes. Her sons, daughters and now grandson have been trying to recreate her recipe. This is what we have come up with and they are pretty dang good. I still feel I'm missing something. If any good German knows the secret help us out. Thanks. -- Recipe: Get a stewing hen and boil on low for 2hrs. Put 5 boullion cubes in the water. In a bowl, put 6 eggs and 1 1/2 cups of milk. Stir. You will add about 2-3 cups of regular{ not presifted flour} a little at a time and stir with a spoon in your hand. You should be able to keep the spoon upright in the batter for a few seconds if the consistency is right., You add the flour a little at a time. When you get the right consistency, take a tablespoon and drop the dough into the boiling broth. After you have dropped all the dumplings, cover and put it on low for about 10 min. Take out of the pot. Take about 3 cups of the broth and put it into a pot. Take about 2 tablespoons of flour in a small jar with hot water and shake it up. Add it to the broth. Stir constantly on low until thick. Add about 2 tablespoons of granulated chicken boullion to he broth. Now you have gravy. Put chicken and dumps together- Enjoy Serve

I used my new stainless steel pressure cooker and had a healthy & delish family meal on the table in 35 minutes! *Used 4 split breasts w/rib instead of whole chicken; made "Seattle's" dumpling recipe, added rosemary & parsley. It only took 5 minutes to have perfectly plump dumplings in the pressure cooker.

I have not yet tried this actual recipe, but ran across Seattle's dumpling recipe while searching for an alternative to our family's tried and true "mama's dumpling recipe" - which could, at times, yield gummy, dense orbs floating in my soup. Seattle's recipe for dumplings is OUTSTANDING. Sorry Mama! I mix a bit of chopped flat leaf parsely and fresh thyme into the dumpling dough. Adds just the right amount of flavor to the dumplings. Thanks Seattle.

I made the dumplings from the recipe that Seattle provided and they were wonderful. I have also made the Chicken and Dumplings recipe from Gourmet 1994 and I like that recipe for the stew a bit better. Thank you for providing the tips Seattle.

Well, my family (including the toddlers) really enjoyed this recipe. Sure, it's not the most exotic, eclectic, or trendy ingredient list, but it _is_ nice, satisfying comfort food. And, the ingredient list is nice and short, so it's actually possible to make dinner without it being a major production. The house smells delicious, too - it's a pleasure to walk into it from outside, with the kitchen smelling so appetizing. The dog is beside herself. :-) And frankly, I appreciate the steps saved by using Bisquick for the dumplings. I omitted the salt because of other reviewers' comments, and the dish was quite tasty but maybe could have used the salt after all -- could go either way. Definitely a keeper. I think I'll go and have thirds, as a matter of fact.

Thank you Seattle. If I want a recipe for bisquick, I'll look on the side of the box. It's not what I'm coming to epicurious for. Frankly, the "side of the box" dumplings were better than these but the recipe from Seattle were the dumplings I wanted.

Thank you Seattle!!! I have been searching for a good homemade dumpling recipe. Bisquick dumplings are fluffy and great...but they taste like Bisquick! Go figure. I have taken this dish to a different place and speeded it up a bit. I brown chicken (thighs)in olive oil & butter, add vegies, spices, 1 cup white wine 1 cup(or more) water and simmer (covered) 35 minutes. Add dumplings, steam for 15 minutes and serve. Fast, easy one-dish comfort food...does it get better than that?

This was a nice, simple recipe that was easy to put together and kid-friendly. We enjoyed it fine, and it seemed to take less time than grandmother's recipe. I like my grandmother's recipe better, but this is different (the dumplings are airier - so what I'm used to and like best may be different for somebody else).

Went here to find a better recipe for dumplings than the one we were using. Already had a good chicken stock and soup recipe. Our search was lengthy and intense for a dumpling recipe that resembled those made by my wife's mom more than 30 years ago when she cooked to bring healing to childhood illnesses. My wife's memories of her mom's chicken and dumplings where very vivid. We were looking for a dumpling that was "light as clouds". When looking at reviews of this recipe we read the one from " a cook in Seattle, March '01. We thought that this transplanted PA Dutch had discribed the dumplings eaten and remembered of long ago. Indeed having just completed a meal of them, she had captured the very same dumpling. Our heartfelt gratitude to "a cook in Seattle. Wish there were some way to let her/him know of our appreciation.

for heaven's sake. I have had scratch dumplings and bisquick dumplings, and to tell the truth there is so little difference I would not bother making them from scratch. this was not intended to be high and mighty fancy pants food. It is basic home cooking and from the 1960's to boot. This is what my mom and my Grandma would have made.

This is a pretty decent recipe, the kids loved it and it was easy. I can't believe that the so called purists (in dumpling making)didn"t mill their own flour and churn their own butter.

I agree with both Seattle cooks. I prefer most food from scratch and dumplings is one of those. I was surprised that a recipe from the 60's calls for Bisquick! I also appreciate the recipe left by the Pennsylvanian...Thank you.

Bisquick??? Horrors! (Giggle)It has basically the same ingredients you would use making biscuits from scratch. It's good for making large amount for a big familoy. Comfort food that the kids loved.

I am with NYC and Seattle! I am southern down here we take our dumplings seriously and no self-respecting cook would use Bisquick to make their dumplings!!!!!!!!!

I agree with the cook from Seattle, using Bisquick dumpings is unthinkable and my recipe for dumplings is similar to hers/his. Devine!!

My family is from western Pennsylvanian German stock. Chicken & dumplings are a staple dish in that part of the country. As common as hotdogs in a baseball stadium! I CANNOT believe that the only, non-cornmeal, dumpling recipe on this website calls for "biscuit mix!" The basic technique for making chicken & dumplings are accurate in most of the recipes here. To make real flour dumplings here's a basic recipe: 2 cups sifted flour, 1 teaspoon salt, 3 teaspoons baking powder, 4 tablespoons shortening, 1 cup of buttermilk or soured milk. Mix together the dry ingredients. Cut in the shortening until crumbly, stir in the buttermilk taking care not to over mix. Allow to stand 5-10 minutes. Drop by rounded tablespoons into the simmering chicken. Bring back to a soft simmer, cook 10 minutes with the cover off, 10 minutes with the cover on. Remove the dumplings to a serving dish with the chicken. If you want to do herbs in the dumplings, stir any kind you like into the dry ingredients then continue. Personal choice here. If you like - and this is REAL Pennsylvania German, eat the dumplings with a little cidar vinegar sprinkled on them.

This was okay, but a little disproportionate. I made half the chicken part of the recipe, with the full amount of dumpling, and my husband and I both thought there was too much chicken and not enough dumpling. Also, I agree with the previous reviewer about the salt - and I did only use half a tbsp. I have better recipes than this...

This dish was absolutely wonderful and very easy. The chicken was falling off the bones. It reminded me of Grandma's cooking. Way too much salt though, even for me. Try 1/2T or less.
