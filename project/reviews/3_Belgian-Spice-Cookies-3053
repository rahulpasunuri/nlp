you will have the best result if you are patient enough to roll them super thin, like see through, well not really, but you get the idea... my girl makes sugar cookies this way, very special girl she is, and very difficult to do if you have no patience... also if you roll out on powdered sugar when thinning and not flour, the dough won't get tough and bakes better!

I've been searching for a good Speculoos recipe ever since I ate at "Speculoos" bakery in Galveston, TX. These had the right flavor but were a different consistency. Perhaps I should have rolled even thinner, but you had to be careful not to crack a tooth when eating them because they were so hard. You definitely need a cup of coofee/tea/milk to dip them in before eating them. If anyone has any tips on how to prevent this I'd love to hear them.

They taste just like the originals, even when made at a high altitude.

Very good cookies! I had no trouble rolling them out to the right size (the dough isn't bothered by being cut and patched to keep the rectangle regular), but I did end up needing to bake them longer (about 14 minutes) in order to get the centers crisp as well as the edges. My first batch (baked for 8 minutes) was crisp at the very edges and a bit tough at the center. The 14-minute batch was an even, crisp consistency throughout after cooling.

These were a little tricky to get onto the baking trays. Apart from that they were yum - v crispy, buttery - exactly what I wanted!

I thought this dish was to die for. I was doing a project on Belgium and I made these. They were a big hit! If you make cookies, these are the ones to make! These cookies were nice and thin and were sweet in the right places! These are truly Belgian cookies!

I had to make these cookies thin as to make as many as the recipe said there could be made. The cookies came out crisp. I usually make soft cookies but these cookies are delightfully crisp. *The recipe calls for 2oz of white chocolate, but I ended up using a little more.
