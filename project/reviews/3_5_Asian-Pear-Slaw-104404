I am thinking about making this salad again using some dried Shingo pears that I got from Trader Joe's. Do you think that would work out well?

Yummy hot weather salad. Because I didn't have enough celery, I added some jicima.

Very tasty, has a nice tang, lots of flavor for so few calories

This recipe is reason enough to plant a couple of Asian pear trees in your yard. Yummy! Have made it many times, with and without cilantro, always to great reviews. It's light, refreshing and delish.

What a fine discovery this reciep is. I thought it rated 3- forks, but my husband clearly thought it was a 4- forker. He loved it and even used the work innovative to describe it. It is a very tasty, fres, late summer dish. I will definitely make it again, expecially since there are 5- more Asian-pears sitting here.

I hate celeries so I never use those,and I often add the pre-bagged cole slaw mix to this but this is an endlessly adaptable recipe that works as a side dish to pretty much any meat dishes. Fresh, summery, and healthy.

I found that I needed to add more celery (approx double) to achieve a better ratio. This was EXCELLENT with a bbq Asian main dish (we did hoisin ribs).

oh, and add some chopped peanuts if you have them around!

realized today that I reviewed this more than 6 yrs ago--I make this recipe so often these days I forgot that I found it on this site; I can do it from memory! This is now a standard part of help-guests-recover-from- jet-lag menu (a la Laurie Colwin), with BLT sandwich made with arugula and some beer. Works like a charm, no kidding.

I've made this twice with no changes. A little goes a long way, but it's so refreshing and every one liked it a lot. It's unusual and low fat.

The dressing was refreshing, but I was unimpressed with the dish as a whole. Used regular pears when I could not find Asian pears and maybe that was my mistake. I also took the advice of other cooks and added mango, but it didn't help.

Light and refreshing. Took to a champagne tasting and everyone loved it.

Very much enjoyed this dish -- light, refreshing! Takes some time to prepare. Took it to a summer gathering and everyone loved it, a couple of people asked for the recipe. One thing - the pears were so juicy that to prevent it from swimming in the juice I had to strain it just prior to the party. Didn't lost it's flavor and i eventually just discarded the juice. Went over so well that I plan tol take it to another gathering this weekend.

I made this for a luncheon I was giving - everyone raved!! So, I've made it twice since. I use a small amount of Asian Hot Sauce in lieu of the chili pepper - mixed in the dressing!

Fabulous and sooo unique. Also, fat free! Endive also works instead of the Celery and if you don't have fresh red peppers you can use the dried (pizza) red pepper.

Colleen - Jicama would work fine; fennel might be too strong. And I'm giving this four forks as it's my favorite salad ever. It made a cilantro believer out of me!

Very yummy. I couldn't find Asian pears, but it seems any old pears will do well, as they did for me. I might suggest easing off on the scallions, but only if you are somewhat less intrepid :-)

Fellow chefs: Could I substitute fennel or jicama for the celery? I like fennel much better.

My friend Krista made this FABULOUS salad for our Santa Cruz bookclub. The salad was the hit of the bookclub! The HOT and sweet spicy are a great combo!

I was a little skeptical about what this would taste like, but after the first bite I was in heavan, and couldn't get enough. It's a nice alternative to the standard side dish. It made a nice accompaniment to honey-ginger salmon.

A great variation on the chopped salad. I have made this 3 or 4 times, and it has been consistently good. I was planning on making it today, but I can't find any Asian pears! Recipe is very forgiving, have made it without scallions, with jicama, etc. etc. etc.

Wow! I really wasn't sure what this unusual combination of ingredients would taste like; I made the recipe only because I needed to use up some celery and Asian pears. I was so stunned when I tasted this savory-spicy-sweet salad. For once, I would not change a thing! Most people will either love or hate this salad. I love cilantro, seasoned rice vinegar, ginger, scallions, and just about all Asian foods, so...
