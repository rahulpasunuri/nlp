Living in Wisconsin, I have been enjoying rhubarb since childhood. Every year, the rhubarb will be a little more or a little less sweet, depending on how cold the Spring, how much rain, etc. You will always have to adjust the amount of sugar accordingly. Best to start with less sugar and add more. Also, some like a recipe more tart.

Absolutely delicious! I loved this! One warning, though: I used only 1/4 of the amount of rhubarb and it boiled down to... not a lot. I'd eaten almost all of it by the time I got it out of the pot and into a dish. Don't scale this down.

You have to like rhubarb; if you do this is entirely wonderful. So much better than applesauce!

This is heavenly for those of us who like rhubarb. Simple, sweet-tart with actual identifiable small chunks of rhubarb. (Don't stir very much...just enough to make sure it isn't sticking.) I cut back the sugar to about a cup and a half since I prefer rhubarb, applesauce, etc. on the tart side.
