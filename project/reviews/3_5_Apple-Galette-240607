The Pastry Dough recipe seems to have been left off of the main recipe. If you look on the SHOPPING LIST for the recipe there's a link to Gourmet's Pastry Dough recipe.

lurohamey: I thought the same thing when I initially read the recipe but the first ingredient is a link to a pastry dough which can also be found here: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Pastry-Dough-240606. Delicious and simple! The flavor of the fruit really shines through.

2 TBSP of semolina? No butter? Where's exactly *is* the pastry in this recipe? I agree, it *looks* great. Now fix the darn recipe. Please.

one of my husband's absolute favorite desserts. without all the spices, you really can taste floral notes in the apples. when I'm in a hurry, I use pre-made crusts. I also toss in a handful of golden raisins in with the apples for texture. delicious.

Gorgeous recipe, really a celebration of apples in all their natural glory. *One important tip: let the dough warm up a little before rolling it, so the edges don't crack and it will be easier to manipulate when pleating it around the apples. You may have to let the dough sit out on the counter up to an hour. I rolled it about 1/8 inch thick. It came out perfectly! Beautiful.

Made this recipe 2x this weekend. Really tasty! My changes: " substituted Gala apples for Golden Delicious...great! " added chopped toasted hazelnuts when done broiling...great! " baked on a pizza stone 2nd time...improved bottom crust from cookie sheet baking.

We Love It! So far I've made it different each time, once with cherries on the bottom under the apples, once with a little cinnamon, and this last time with cardamom & ginger. I think I'll try the suggestion of Rosemary next, or the blood orange & vanilla.

Fantastic! Much easier than a double crusted apple pie and I think as good and maybe better. I omitted the lemon rind and added 1 tbsp.of chopped fresh rosemary. Yum! And impressive for guests. This will become my new "for company" apple pie.

How does one make pastry with just flour? It says nothing about butter - or any other ingredient - just 2 tablespoons of flour. I don't get it.

Simple (really), delicious, and pretty to look at. Before I cut it, I always show my guests.

Impressive weeknight dessert -- so easy to make. Has all the best elements of apple pie. Lots of simple flavors.

Best dessert ever. I always get requests for this from my friends. The crust is buttery and flaky and the fruit doesn't have that heavy too-sweet gooeyness that makes me averse to apple pie. Since the apples are near-naked, you should use the freshest and best-tasting fruit you can find. When I make this using honeycrisp apples, people cannot stop talking about it.

Very tasty. A bit plain though. As they said, apples in the buff. I prefer a bit of cinnamon or nutmeg on top.

I made this with pears. Instead of lemon I used a blood orange and I added the seeds from half of a vanilla bean. Yum! This is a great, versatile recipe.

This is a delicious apple dessert! The polenta gives it an interest twist. This recipe is a light dessert with a well-balance sweet and tart taste. Our family loved it!

We made this as a light dessert for Thanksgiving and it was excellent. Quick, easy and the lemon and apples were marvelous together.

The apples came out to be mushy when the cook time was over - maybe if I used apples that we're as ripe it would have worked better. The recipe for the pastry dough came out really nicely - buttery and a little flaky. I would try it again with a different fruit.

Lovely dessert for our soup night. Just the right balance of sweet and tart. Might have the leftovers for breakfast.

This was a Thanksgiving hit. Easy to make with excellent taste. The apple flavor really comes through with a hint of lemon. This is a definite repeat.

I used my mother-in-law's pie crust, which is wonderful in its own right. Other than that, I followed the recipe and made two in one evening. They were fantastic. Making two more for Thanksgiving, thinking about using pears for one of them.

This was exceptional. Used ready made pie crusts. Same amount of apples made 2 - next time may add 1 more? Used regular flour served with vanilla ice cream for a decadent dessert. Plan on making for Thanksgiving.
