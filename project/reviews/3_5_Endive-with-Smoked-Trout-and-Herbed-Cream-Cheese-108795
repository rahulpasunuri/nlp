I make the herbed cream cheese, and serve it with smoked trout(made in a stove-top smoker), along with bagels or pumpernickel bread. Delicious.

Delicious and beautiful.

I loved the recipe but agree with the other reviewers who found the endive too bitter. I would consider serving it on slices of granny smith apples spritzed with some citrus.

Love this appetizer! Light, fresh, and yummy. Get raves and recipe requests from everyone who has tried it.

I made this twice so far. Once with smoked salmon since I couldn't find smoked trout. It was good. Then I made it with the smoked trout - and it was awesome. There was a huge difference in taste - the cream cheese was really designed to go with the trout. Will definitely make this again - and only with the trout!

I agree with the previous reviewer, although I think I would make this again - with a few changes. I don't think this pairs well with endive. It has a vey flat finish. However, I think a bit of garlic or apple might bring some much needed life to the dish. Also, I think this would be better on crackers or toast. I ate the leftovers on bagels with sliced tomato and a liberal sprinkle of trout on top.

Well, I was really looking forward to this - the reviews were SO positive. I should have read them more closely. Apples would have helped a lot, but as written, this recipe didn't do much for me. Too dilly yet bland. I had doubled the recipe for two separate parties, so I had a chance to fiddle with the second batch to no avail. Apples! Should have used apples... Wouldn't make it again anyway.

This is incredible. Made it today for tomorrow's T-Giving dinner. Some thoughts: it is very Food Processor friendly. I threw everything in to mix it up --- trout and all-- and it tastes delicious. I'm using the endive, but next year maybe the cucumber or frozen phyllo shells from the supermarket. One tip: remember to strip off the skin off the back of the fish. It's fishy.

I am a lazy chef, and what I do is use any smoked fish, add the green apples, mix it all together, and let my guests fill their own endive leaves!!! I also set out crackers and cucumber or zucchini slices, the added crunch is nice...

AMAZING! We had a hard time finding smoked trout here in Seattle, so I substituted smoked salmon and for fun added a little caviar to the top of each. In the two weeks since we found this recipe we've already made it for 3 gatherings and received rave reviews! Definitely a keeper.

We prepared this as a starter for our gourmet dining group and all loved it... simple and good: who could ask for more? Served with a viognier and a pinot grigio -- both were excellent pairings.

This was so simple to make for someone who has not cooked in over 3 yrs. Made this for my boyfriend (a connoisseur), who loved it. Thanks for the suggestion of adding some of the smoked trout in the cheese. Will definitely make it again though could not find red endives.

I made this for a cocktail party and it was great. I made the mix a day ahead, added apple and used smoked salmon. I am doing it again for Christmas night. I THINK USING THE SMALLER LEAVES MAKE A BETTER APPETIZER.

I've made similar recipe in the past, and would like to serve this at Christmas. If I add the apples, do they turn brown if made ahead, or do I have to stir them in at the last minute?

I agree that adding a dollop of sour cream is good, but try using a little creme fraiche. Yummy!

This was delicious and really easy to make. I ended up not using trout, but using hard smoked salmon. It was a big hit!

Strikingly good - I added a dollop of sour cream and put the trout (flaked into pieces) directly in the mixture - it is sitting in my fridge right now and I can't stop sampling it; delicious! The flavors really come together after some time to meld, its a great make-ahead.

I really enjoyed this dish. The saltiness of the smoked trout balances the bitterness of the endive and the tartness of the dill. However, it was the least eaten thing on my table. Might have been the wrong occassion. Make when you have guest that enjoy finer foods.

Lovely, light! The lemon zest is crucial. I had very good smoked trout which makes a difference. Be careful not to use the stems of the dill when decorating as they're tough.

Lovely presentation, our guests loved it. I added minced apple as suggested below and the sweetness of it complimented the smoked trout beautifully. Don't forget the lemon peel, and add plenty of freshly cracked black pepper, otherwise it will be too bland. Elegant, easy, make-ahead party-worthy appetizer! Enjoy!

Terrific! I substituted smoked salmon and cucumber (after reading the reviews) and it turned out delicious ~ creamy and savory but while maintaining a light feel.

This is a great fancy-ish appetizer. After making it last year for Thanksgiving, I've been asked to bring it to several subsequent parties - always to rave reviews.

I served this last weekend at a cocktail party. I added the apples...a must. The sweetness of the apples pairs well with the dill, cream cheese & smoky fish. But it did not fly off the serving tray. I think some of my less sophisticated guests were scared of the endive. I did find red endive at Whole Foods. If I make it again, I may try the cucumbers as others have suggested.

Nice make ahead addition to our Thanksgiving dinner. No luck in finding the red endive which would have livened up the presentation, but was still good. Endive was a little bitter for the kids, so will use the suggestion of cucumber slices for some in the future

I had this at my mom's Thanksgiving dinner and loved it so much that I went home and made it for my holiday party. It is delicious and I can't believe someone below thought it was a lot of work. One change we made, mixing a bit of the trout into the cream cheese mixture. Definitely a winner.

I made this three times in the last month and all my guests love it. Any other smoked fish works just as well.

Very good appetizer. Quite easy and I incorporated the suggestion of adding apples, would HIGHLY suggest it -- I peeled and cut in tiny cubes and mixed into the cream cheese -- it adds bulk and a lot of flavor but isn't at all overpowering, people might not know apples are in there if you don't tell them. 1/3 c. dill is a lot and some might like less. I adored the smoked trout but it's a bit expensive. I saw they had much cheaper smoked mackerel and I may try that next time although I fear the strong flavor may be overwhelming. Good and relatively light appetizer.

I made this as one of the appetizers for friends and family on Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! I loved the fact that is was so easy to make. I used smoked trout with black peppercorns, skipping the dill, and substituted tofutti cream cheese for the real thing due to dairy allergy. Will definitely be making this one again.

I served this several weeks ago at a dinner party for 8 and everyone LOVED it. Two of the guests were running a little late, and there was very little left for them... A couple of changes...there was no Belgian endive that looked decent at any of our markets since we're in the midst of a grocery store strike. I used sliced hothouse cucumbers instead, and it was a wonderful substitute. Also, couldn't find smoked trout, so smoked swordfish was a wonderful change. I'm never afraid to try something different if an ingredient isn't available...that's sometimes how we discover a great new recipe!

We had Thanksgiving dinner at our home using the entire menu that goes with this recipe. Ihad a guest make this dish and I thought it was beautiful and went well with champagne. My guest {the one who made "it" } thought "it" was alot of work. Next year I'm rethinking my guest list.

Very disappointing. Too much dill. Even my pig cousins who usually eat everything in sight tasted one and left the rest.

Wonderful on cocktail pumpernickel (ran out of endive.) Added a wee bit of chevre (didn't have enough cream cheese.) Innovation in the face of adversity! Good basic recipe.

EASY, ELEGANT AND DELICIOUS. CHOPPED APPLE WAS A NICE ADDITION!
