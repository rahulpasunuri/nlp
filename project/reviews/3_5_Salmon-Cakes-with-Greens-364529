I liked the adding mayo to the cakes idea and so I added about half of the entire dressing to the cakes themselves before I cooked them. So good! Hearts of palm are good in the salad for adding a little extra substance too.

Served with popovers, this was lovely lunch fare for early June. I substituted Ojai Light Lemonaise for the fat-free mayo and grated some lemon zest into the dressing.

This review pertains to the fish cakes only, which were delicious. Made with Basa fillets instead of salmon (just because it's what i had) but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Yummy. DO use all the capers, they are a great compliment to the fish and little balls of delicious.

The cakes were wonderful. (I didn't make the greens. I served this the leek tomato quinoa recipe from this site.) I used raw salmon and the texture of the cakes was great. Not at all rubbery. (Can't tell if that person who said it'd be rubbery ever made this recipe or is just spouting off.) Anyway, I used panko instead of regular breadcrumbs for some extra crisp. Very good.

It sounds delicious doesn't it? I admit, 5 tablespoons of capers seems like a lot, but actually the salmon cakes are quite tasty. Crispy, salty, yum. (I preferred my cakes on the thinner side.) The dressing on the other hand tasted like Miracle Whip. My husband revolted. I plucked off the salmon cakes and ate them with a little lemon. If I make the cakes again, I'll try it with a a spicy honey mustard dressing instead of the dijon/mayo.

This was delicious; I'd say it's definitely made routine dinner rotation. I added some of the caper juice to the sauce as well as some smashed up avocado in place of some of the mayo and it was wonderful. I used panko instead of plain breadcrumbs, made the cakes with raw salmon as directed, and used a whole egg instead of two whites. The texture was perfect; crispy golden on the outside and tender in the middle.

Do not use canned salmon. Mine turned out pretty rubbery. The sauce we delish though!

I would definitely make this again. I made it exactly as directed and did not feel like the cakes were rubbery or anything less than delicious. I didn't have as many capers as I needed, so I added a little of the juice and threw in some dried dill in hopes of making up for any lost flavor. The Salmon Cakes received rave reviews from my hubby, too!

I made these last night and they were great. Light and not heavy they are great for a summer dinner or lunch. I did cook my fish to be safe and only did 4 tbsp of capers. I did not make the sauce but next time I will. I did have some mustard with honey and dill which was great with the cakes.

My husband made this for me today, for Mother's Day. He made a mistake and added the mayonnaise to the salmon. We thought this would ruin the dish, but as it turned out - it was AMAZING! He didn't cook the salmon first, but just made the balls as instructed with the addition of the mayo. Not rubbery at all. I will definitely make again, and will continue this error. The sauce was also divine. My kids ate the cakes, but not the sauce.

Starting with raw salmon you are always going to get rubbery, tough patties. Crab meat is already cooked, so they are not the same in recipes. Having the salmon already cooked and flaked, the patties are tender and delicious!

Followed the directions exactly - light flavors and my 2 year old and 4 year old cleaned their plates. We opted to serve this dish with asparagus and rice in lieu of the salad; however, we made the dressing and served it on the side as a sauce. Recipe was very good - not exceptional, but something that we'll be making again and again!
