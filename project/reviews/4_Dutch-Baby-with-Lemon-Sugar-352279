Very good basic recipe, but much tastier with maple syrup or some preserves. No one liked lemon sugar. Also spices didn't work well with lemon flavor and were just unnecessary. Next time I'd skip the spices and put lemon zest and a bit of sugar in the batter. Also it was just a bit too dry, but I used 1% milk and much less butter. I made it in a oven-safe nonstick pan and it rose very tall. This is a keeper.

So easy, fun, and delicious. This basic recipe can be adapted to any taste--savory or sweet. I can't wait to experiment with additional toppings and flavors.

You won't find an easier dessert. I made it for Easter exactly as written. Just fabulous. My husband and I wanted to eat the entire dessert, but we exercised some restraint and saved half for the next day. It warmed up beautifully in the microwave on a low heat setting. This is a keeper!

I introduced my family to these 40 years ago when I was a college student or soon after, and now my father makes them every year for Christmas breakfast. We use a Sunset magazine recipe that has no spices in it, so cinnamon with lemon sounds odd to me. Highly recommended!

so so so good. i used the lemon sugar from this, but i combined it with alton brown's dutch baby recipe, and made it with orange instead of lemon.. i added zest right into the batter too, like another commenter did. so good! link to my version here: http://www.baker-maker.com/2012/02/orange-sugar-dutch-baby.html

I love this crazy pancake thing! I don't make the lemon sugar. I just add the zest to the batter and sprinkle the top with powdered sugar and another squeeze of lemon. All the excitement of a souffle and none of the dangers.

I was hungry but allowed time for the eggs and milk come to room temperature and was not disappointed. Rose beautifully and was incredibly easy to make...and easy breezy cleanup. It barely took 18 minutes to cook, almost afraid it would burn. Can't wait to try different toppings and different sugar-flavoring combos! Will definitely keep the nutmeg and cinnamon in the batter.

I love these as does everyone I have made them for. Very festive looking and taste great with the lemon sugar and powdered sugar. One time I had an issue with it NOT rising and I figured it was that I had old flour. It was at our vacation home and had been sitting in a humid kitchen for too long. Otherwise it has always worked brilliantly.

This recipe is a big hit with my kids. I've made it several times, and it's always yummy. I've tried it with the full amount of butter, and also with just 2 tbsp. I personally think it tastes better with the full amount, but it's still fine with half and is certainly healthier. If you don't have a lemon, sprinkle bottled lemon juice on top before sprinkling with sugar. It's not as good as with zest, but still fine.

Rating: 4
These are incredible. I followed the recipe exactly, except I just used some maple syrup on top instead of the lemon sugar. The baby puffed up beautifully (inches above the side of my enamel pan!) and was ready at 18 minutes. I might even try for less cook time in the future since the edges were a bit overdone. I would say the key to getting the "puff" is a super hot pan. Also, use the full amount of butter in the recipe even though it seems like A LOT! I'm not sure if the type of milk used will affect the rising. My friends used 1% milk when they made them for me and I used whole milk today. Both babies puffed really nicely. I will definitely make these for my parents when they visit Seattle next month!

Rating: 2
Very tasty but it didn't rise in the center. It was dense and raw after more than 25 minutes - even at 30+ minutes! Maybe I didn't whip the eggs long enough? I used whole wheat pastry flour - was that too dense for it to rise? Super easy to make so I'll try again, hopefully with better results.

As a Seattle gal, I grew up on these beauties. I have been telling my husband tales of the saintly, delicious dutch babies for years. We finally got around to making one this morning. Why had I waited so long? God...so good! The only variation we made was to sub half and half for the whole milk as we didn't have any. Ours turned out just as I remembered them, light and fluffy in some areas and dense and chewy like a crepe in some areas. I used a cast iron pan and it worked perfectly. It rose up the sides of the pan during cooking. They don't always puff up evenly on all sides, so don't feel like you did something wrong if that doesn't occur. Trust me, it will still be amazing! We served ours with the traditional lemon and sugar, as well as some maple syrup (if you like it on the sweet side). Additionally, lingonberry preserves are an excellent accompaniment to these. Try this!

The best!!! Never saw a dutch baby rise as high as this one did!! Beautiful to watch thru the oven door and a definite breakfast conversation piece! Used a 12-inch enameled cast iron skillet and it rose 6 inches all around the rim of the skillet!

Excellent recipe! Crispy and light. Used 2% milk instead of whole milk. Perfection! Better than a recipe I made last week from an America's Test Kitchen magazine. This is a keeper!

Maybe it was because I used 1 percent milk......it did not rise like it should have. The flavor was okay. And lacking moisture...

Very easy to make. We've substituted orange or lime zest when we don't have lemons and it's still great. Today we added half whole wheat flour and while still okay, it was a bit gummy. I'd stick with the all white flour and get my fiber from other sources!

I made this for the first time today and it was perfect in every way! I didn't have the right skillet but used a pyrex 10in dish instead. It was actually better because I could bring it straight to the table with a nice presentation. This is a winner!

Whoa! Was I ever wrong there. The Dutch baby DID originate in Seattle a long time ago at Manca's. I should always check my facts before making statements like that (in my previous post) - So sorry folks. Oven is heating up now and I'm ready to try this great recipe!

I'm going to try this, using a cast iron skillet with a wooden handle covered with heavy foil - apparently folks at "Chowhound" have done this without a fire. Looks like a very good version of a Dutch Baby, which certainly did not originate in Seattle - it has been around for many, many years and is famous at the Original Pancake House in Portland. People stand in line for hours to eat their Dutch Babies and Apple Pancakes (another version of same.) Let's see how this foil-covered handle works out!

Made this last weekend and everyone loved it. Mine puffed up way more than the picture showed, I may have had the pan too hot. Didn't have a lemon but used orange zest to make orange sugar and it was quite delicious!

Rating: 2
I would give this 2 1/2 forks if possible. I followed the recipe exactly and it didn't come out the way the picture, nor any Dutch Baby I've ever had, showed it to. Nevertheless, what I did make (a very large, thin, flat pancake that didn't rise or puff) tasted really good. Next time, I might add some lemon zest into the batter. I served it with fresh lemon wedges on the side - it needed the extra moisture from the lemon juice.

Made this today as a "red, white, and blue" breakfast to kick off the holidays. It was wonderful! Two of us ate almost the entire thing! I definitely think you can cut back on the butter (probably by half) and I used only half of the lemon sugar (and I like things to be sweet). Covered it with blueberries and raspberries - YUM!

Wow...I was looking for something different to make for breakfast this morning--and this is fantastic!! I have a 12" cast iron skillet, and I increased the ingredients by 1/3 to accommodate the larger size. I had no whole milk, so substituted 2/3 lowfat with 1/3 heavy cream. I had no lemon zest, so I substituted dried lemon peel with a dash of lemon extract. The only thing that I will do differently next time is to make less of the lemon sugar. I have enough left over from this recipe to last 2 more. My boyfriend suggested that I make a cream-cheese/sugar filling for it next time and pipe it around the edges...I think he's onto something! This is definitely a keeper!

Excellent and super easy! I also used Meyer Lemons which, as the previous review said, gave it a very nice lemony-orangey kick. I also used the exact amount of butter and sugar and was very glad for it. All the sugar was needed to fill in the nooks & crannies after mine just about climbed out of the oven!! This will be a definite, go-to for a quick, impressive breakfast/dessert.

I love this recipe! I've made it for Easter brunch and for other special family occasions. The lemon sugar really makes this recipe special. I usually serve it with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.

Tips from a cook who's made this 50 times: 1. Reduce the lemon sugar. Substituting powdered sugar is preferred. 2. You can add lemon to batter for variation 3. If it doesn't puff, either the oven wasn't hot enough or pan wasn't hot enough when batter was poured in. 4. Mixer/Blender/Food processer all work. 5. You can put a double batch in a 9x14 pan, but modify the time. I suggest being familiar with the recipe before it is tried. 6. Undercook rather than over cook. 7. Minimum of 2 TBLS of butter necessary to keep the baby from sticking to the pan when it comes out. 8. Enjoy

I have made this often. I only use 2 Tbsp. of butter in the pan, and it still is plenty enough for it to climb. ( I tried 1 and it was too small of an amount. Also, although I have a gigantic sweet tooth it definitely doesn't need all the sugar on the top. I mix in just enough to coat the zest, and it is plenty. YUMMY!!

Rating: 4
Wonderful recipe - I made this gluten-free using brown rice flour with a pinch of cream of tartar. It puffed up wonderfully high. I reduced the cooking time and the heat a little after it was in the oven, so it wouldn't brown too much. The lemon sugar is lovely - we left it to the individual to sprinkle sugar on their own slice, and had lots of sugar left over. Next time I am going to make it in individual cast iron skillets (4") for a different presentation, with lots of stewed fruit!

Rating: 4
Absolutely fabulous! I made it in the Cuisinart and it worked great. Also, used powdered sugar rather than granulated, a la Original Pancake House. And for one more nifty addition, I used a Meyer lemon for a really nice orange-y flavor. My hips will regret it, but this recipe is a keeper!

A great little recipe - the perfect thing to brighten up a dreary December morning. I would on the next go around however, consider using less and/or a different sugar (the granulated sugar was a bit much in sweetness and quantity). I would also likely use a bit less butter as well. Still, a great, quick recipe. Also, it cooked really beautifully in my 10" Le Creuset pan.

I found this recipe to be wonderful for my family. It was a beautiful collaboration of French toast and flapjacks. The only problem with this recipe is that is was so delicious that the recipe did not make enough. This is undoubtedly a recipe I shall be using again..

This is a great way to break away from Sunday bacon and eggs. What we do though is after the butter has come out, we layer the skillet with sliced green apples and bake them for about 5 minutes and then we add in the batter and cook for the suggested time. A huge hit!

This was great! My family always mixed lemon juice with butter for a topping instead of the lemon sugar, but I got a number of compliments on the lemon sugar. Mine didn't puff up like I would expect, but I'd made some slight changes so perhaps that was my fault. Mine turned out significantly thicker than the Dutch Babies I usually make, but again, it was very tasty.

Made this twice over the holiday weekend. I recommend using powdered sugar (gentler texture and flavor) rather than granulated sugar and fresh lemon zest. This was a hit with my guests.

Really yummy! Just made these in popover pans for brunch. Preheat popover pan in oven just as recipe states, but cut amount of butter called for in half or it will drip in the oven. Divide the butter equally among 6 popover pans after preheating and bake. They were beautiful!

Very fun. Very yummy. I reduced the butter like others did, and also added low fat milk instead of whole. As far as I can tell, it didn't make a difference. We also made orange sugar, rather than lemon. I used a pizza cutter to cut the slices out of the pan which made for a great presentation. Next time we'll top with lots of berries.

Yum!! When I took this out of the oven, my husband announced that I had made one big Yorkshire Pudding. This turned out really well. I made it in a large casserole dish and I used spray oil. I will make this again for breakfast and may try it the next time I make Yorkshire Puddings.

Classic recipe that stands the test of time. I added juice from a 1/4 lemon to the batter and it added the lemon tang without the need for too much sugar. I'll be making this again; but now I need to go burn these calories.

Ack! I was so disappointed by this. The appearance is totally stunning, the name adorable, the taste lacked cohesiveness for me though. If I make it again, I will certainly add at least some sugar to the pancake (thought it tasted eggy and wierd without it) and probably up the spices some for more punch, even though I did use fresh grated. The texture is cool, and it is lovely, so I will play around with those changes. I wanted to like this so bad, it is so pretty, but it tasted too much like an eggy unsweetened pancake for me as is. The lemon sugar is fantastic, however!

Have been making these for years; always great with fresh fruit (peaches and raspberries are wonderful; also with bottles lingonberries. Someone said theirs was a little tough; that is from beating the batter too much after you add the flour. Beat the eggs, milk, etc. well first, then add the flour and stir just until mixed; may be a little lumpy. Can make individual miniature babies, in small round au gratin dishes. Sometimes I serve them open-faces; sometimes I roll them like a crepe.

Wonderful recipe. We first came across a more basic version of this dish on our honeymoon in the Black Hills in 1996 at the B & B that we stayed at, and it has become our Sunday morning go-to breakfast. It is our 9 year old's favorite! We make ours in a seasoned iron skillet and it works very well.

Needing to follow a gluten-free diet, I made this recipe using a mixture of gluten-free flours. As the other reviewers suggested I reduced the butter to 2 tablespoons and that was plenty. The top was very golden brown and it appeared to be cooked through but it wasn't. Will try it again but will cook longer.

I just made this this morning for brunch and it is outstanding. What presentation! I made exactly as recipe said but cut the butter to 2 tablespoons and used a 1/4 cup turbinado sugar instead. Don't skip the lemon zest - it gives the dish wonderful freshness and isn't overwhelming at all. It melds with the sugar over the hot cake. I topped with fresh strawberries and it was devoured. I will be making this again and again for an impressive addition to Sunday brunch.

Rating: 4
What a great addition to a Sunday breakfast/brunch and so simple. I only had to bake mine about 12 minutes as well before it was big and brown and starting to burn a bit. I also agree that the butter should be reduced by at least one tablespoon. I ended up mopping out some of the excess butter with a paper towel. Served it with fresh raspberries mixed with a bit of jam, powdered sugar and the lemon sugar. A big hit. I will be making this one again and again.

I loved this recipe - except I put too much sugar on the Dutch Baby. We all scaped off the sugar and it was delicious! Maybe I will try powdered sugar next time. Also it only took 12 minutes to cook - but that could be because of the altitude!

I have been making individual dutch baby's, to the delight of my houseguests. I preheat the oven,(425) then use small cast iron skillets, placing 1 T of butter in each, then mix in the blender 1/4 C milk; 1/4 C flour (spelt works well);dash of vanilla, and one egg per skillet. I pour the mixture over the melted butter in the skillet, bake for about 12 minutes. They rise beautifully, and are delicious.

I first tried this in a restaurant at the Surftides Inn in Lincoln City, Oregon. They serve it with fresh strawberries, blueberries, or Marion berries with lemon slices on the side and powdered sugar as well as pancake syrup. I spread sugar free orange marmalade over the top while it is warm as well as fresh squeezed lemon juice. my grandchildren love it.

Dutch Baby is simply delicious! Usually I don't tweak a recipe the first time I try it, but the amount of butter did seem excessive. I halved the amount called for and couldn't ask for better results. We had fresh strawberries on the side. Yummy!!!

This was delicious and greatly enjoyed as an impromptu breakfast for my family. I made a few alterations based on what I had around the house and personal preference but had fantastic results. I didn't do the lemon zest since I didn't have any and have had bad luck with the stuff. So I added an 1/8 tsp of lemon extract to the batter and sprinkled the cake with powdered sugar and put a lightly sweetened strawberry puree on top. It was great. I can see this cake as a base for tons of dishes both savory and sweet. I envision it with a cheese/mushroom/vegetable topping. Heavenly.

Easy and fun to make! Works just fine with skim milk instead of whole. Added some vanilla paste (instead of extract) to the batter so it had a hint of sweetness. 2T butter was plenty to coat the pan. A keeper!

Dutch babies are a favorite. On holiday once I looked for a receipe in Joy of cooking which had no flour, but cornstarch!! I think it had to be an error..didn't try it. Like popovers, the hot pan is the secret to great dutch baby's. Not a dish to be served to a group unless your That Good!

This is probably my absolute FAVORITE breakfast food! It's so easy and so delicious (and decadent)! Definitely a great way to impress people for breakfast or brunch...they're beautiful coming out of the oven. Like the last reviewer, I also normally serve them with lemon juice and powdered sugar. To the people complaining of too much butter...the recipe I usually follow has you pour the majority of the melted butter into your batter, mix it up, and then pour the batter into the pan. You might try that if you want to maintain the buttery deliciousness but minimize the greasiness. Cutting back on the amount of butter also works, but I'm a fan of mixing some in.

i loved this recipe. true... it does need a little augmentation. 1. 2-3 tbl butter is plenty. 2. less than a 1/4 c. of lemon sugar is also plenty. 3. i added just a tbl of sugar to the batter itself which i think that it needed. mmmm... i want one right now.... with a squeeze of lemon juice on top.

I made the Dutch baby with lemon sugar. (Gourmet April 2009) It was delicious! As other reviewers have commented, I recommend reducing the amount of butter and using only a small portion of the lemon sugar. If I make this recipe again, I will also reduce the cooking time slightly. My pancake was slightly overdone in 18 minutes. We served our Dutch baby with sliced strawberries and had bacon alongside. A perfect Easter brunch.

Instead of the suggested lemon sugar, I squeeze the juice of an entire fresh lemon over this and sprinkle confectionary sugar on top. I also don't think I use as much butter as suggested. Just enough to cover the pan.

I liked this, but didn't love it. Like others have mentioned, there's way too much butter, if I make it again I will reduce it by half. I didn't like the nutmeg and cinnamon, with lemon, I'd omit them. It was also a little tough. Oh, and I'd reduce the amount of lemon sugar to 1/4 cup.

This turned out great. I also feel there was way too much butter, but decided to use the 1/2 stick just in case. Next time, I will reduce. Also I put a table spoon or so of the lemon sugar in the batter. If it didn't rise, you are doing something wrong.

I made this exactly as directed in the recipe and it was absolutely the best Dutch Baby I've ever had. Like other reviewers, I also thought there was too much butter in the pan but it cooked in without a trace of greasiness. I used convection and mine cooked in 10 min. I would cut down the amount of lemon sugar next time.

waaaay too much butter! when i poured the batter in the butter pooled in with it, leaving a thick layer of butter on top that prevented it from rising properly. the taste was good, although the texture was kind of weird (most likely because of above reason). i would reduce the sugar in the topping to about 1/4 cup.

I found this recipe to be missing something. The list of ingredients! Here are ingredients and quantities found on another site that most closely resemble these instructions. Don't forget to use a cast-iron skillet and sprinkle with the lemon sugar (that DID make an appearance here). We loved these when we went to the Netherlands, but have never made them. If someone has a better recipe, let's share! So here they are..... 6 eggs, room temperature; 1 Cup milk, room temperature; 1 cup sifted bread flour or all-purpose flour*; 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract; 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon; 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg; 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt; 5 Tablespoons butter. * Bread flour is a high-protein flour. The high protein helps the pancake rise. All-purpose flour may be substituted, but the results wont be as spectacular.
