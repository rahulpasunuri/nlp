Delicious way to use sour cherries.This was a big hit with the whole family.

i used fresh cherries, and barely got enough juice. Didn't even need to boil it down a second time. Flavors were good (I cut the sugar in half), but I thought the whole process of running the cherries through a sieve and then re-adding them was unnecessary.

We made this with frozen sweet cherries, which were all that were available. Recommend reducing sugar and using an ice cream that is not overly sweet.

This was quick and easy. We used cherries we had picked last summer and frozen (nothing like a bit of summer in the winter). Used a 1.5 tbls of brandy because we did not have kirsch.

I've made this recipe twice with fresh sour cherries. Easy to make and very tasty with Hagen Das Vanilla ice cream. The first time I omitted the kirsch, the second time I substiuted almond flavoured tequilla. Plus, I used 3/4 cup of sugar instead of one full cup. Still tasted great.

I scribbled down this recipe last summer and spent the morning looking for it in anticipation of this year's harvest. This is delicious. I don't have kirsch but may have used a little bit of almond extract or just omitted any extra flavoring. The neighborhood kids who were here at the time loved it. Maybe we'll have to invite the parents, too, this year.

I disagree with the reviewer who said this recipe was difficult to understand. I found it fascinating since I have made many recipes with carmelized sugar and this method seems foolproof and much easier. It was fun to see the sugar melt, turn brown and then become so candy-like. Very delicious. I used frozen cherries - drained very completely.

Unbelievably wonderful. I used fresh sour cherries (which I think was key) and omitted the liqueur (it tasted quite rich without, as if it had it). But so simple, so delicious, over vanilla ice cream. Easy to make, and a wonderful treat.

The process was easier to DO than to FIGURE OUT from the recipe. Made ahead to last reheating, had supper, then finished and served. Substituted on-hand Grand Marnier for kirsch, it would likely have provided an extra cherry kick.
