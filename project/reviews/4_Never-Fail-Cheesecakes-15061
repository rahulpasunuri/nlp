I have made this recipe numerous times, it is now a staple in my arsenal of good recipes. I do a graham cracker crust by mixing them with melted butter in the cuisinart and don't put a filling on top. I love this recipe and get tons of compliments on it! Enjoy...

Love this recipe! I make it in my mini-muffin pans (which make approx. 72) and have found that the papers stick, so I just spray the pans with cooking spray and they pop out just fine. I add grated orange peel to both the batter and the sour cream mixture, which enhances the flavor. As they freeze well, I keep them on hand for "emergencies". I either top them with drizzles of chocolate or assorted fruit preserves. And when a small dessert is needed to end that perfect meal, just two or three of them, along with a chocolate dipped strawberry, are just what is needed.

These are so cute and very good. I just topped mine with toasted sliced almonds, and they were so pretty. The batter is pretty thin, so it was easy to pour it into a small pitcher, then into the mini-cupcake liners.

My nephews love this recipe!. It's been a standing request at Christmas & his birthday for years. It also travels well.

Aside from wonderful texture and flavor, these mini cheesecakes are very versatile. I've used different cookies for the crusts: ginger snaps, chocolate wafers, and shortbread. I've also topped them with strained jam and ganache. They always turn out perfectly (never-fail, indeed), and they yield just the right serving. I highly recommend this recipe, especially for making birthdays extra-special (top each cheesecake with a letter to spell out a birthday greeting). Easy and delicious - you really can't go wrong.

This recipe was not nearly as good as I had hoped. They did not have a rich, creamy cheesecake flavor or texture. They were very puffy and crumbly, like a cupcake. I was prepared to make 2 batches but after tasting the first will put the rest of my cream cheese to better use in a real cheesecake.

I make these cheesecakes quite often, they are fun, quick and easy to make. I especially like to make them around Christmas time and top them with Jalapeño jellies since they come in red and green varieties. Quite festive. Note that this recipe is for mini-cupcake tins, not regular-sized.

Very nice, very easy. I melted some chocolate and mixed about 1/4 of the cheesecake batter into it, then dropped some of that on top of each and sort of swirled it in. Served them on a platter with fresh strawberries. A terrific gluten-free treat all round.

I made these for a party, and they were an absolute hit! I made an easy graham cracker crust and omitted the sour cream frosting, topping with berries instead. I will definitely make them again!

This was fabulous. I did do a little alteration-substituted a "sugar blend"-part splenda part regular sugar, added dried blueberries, and for the topping I substituted 1/3 cup of sour cream with lemon yogurt and added a good amount of lemon peels to it. It was great from the start- and got better everyday after! Only sorry that I didn't make more. Easy and Yummy!

I have a solution to make the "spooning" step easier. Wilton makes a tool called an Easy-Pour Candy Funnel. I ladled the batter into the funnel and it worked like a charm. No mess, really fast, even distribution.

Definitely very easy recipe. I made it for a party and people raved about it. Kind of laborious assembling the individual cakes, but the response was worth it. I topped with raspberry sauce, creme fraiche and a sprig of mint.

These are so delicious and make such a beautiful presentation when topped with raspberries or kiwi or strawberry slices, etc. I spray the mini-cupcake tins with PAM instead of using the paper liners and they little cheesecakes are fairly easy to remove. These are great to take to parties and both adults and kids love them! You can use Splenda and they are great for the low-carb people!

I love this recipe... Instead of making mini cheesecakes, I used a springform pan and made a big cheesecake. My whole family loved it!! And I make them for work every few months.

This was an excellent and easy recipe. I love putting Tabasco brand jalapeno jelly as a topping. (Don't curl your nose at it until you've tried it, it's a fabulous blend of flavors along with sweet, but spicy). Only issue: the recipe does not make as many as it claims, but doubling the recipe is no issue.

Never fail is right! This was a hit! Not only was it very very easy and quick but there was no fail on the taste. I used an Oreo bottom crust which added just the right amount of chocolate for me. Give it a try.

Perfect for parties. I used regular a regular muffin tin instead of a mini. It worked great. I also followed one of the reviewers suggestions and "seasoned" 'nilla wafers with a raspberry liqour. Highly recommended.

I would definitely recommend keeping the sour cream topping and adding a graham cracker crust on the bottom as suggested. We topped it with fresh raspberries. The cheesecake has a very smooth taste and needs a little bit of tart (lemon juice?) to give it some zest.

Soooo good!! And could not be more simple - a true "never-fail recipe." I like the sour cream topping, especially since the cheese cake batter is a little on the sweet side - gives it a good balance. I also like the versatily of the recipe - tried it with pineapple, but might try chocolate and/or berries next time. A great recipe for a party - easy, make-a-head, safe, and really yummy!

made a few changes and it was AWESOME! first made a simple crust (2 cups graham cracker crumbs mixed with about 3/4 stick of melted butter) and patted it into the bottom of the the tins, skipped the sour cream topping and topped with sliced strawberries and melted chocolate- wow!

This was the easiest and tastiest recipe I have ever had for cheesecake and they're not as messy because they're already single servings...no cake to cut!! :)

My grandmother used to make similar bite-sized (at least they are if you happen to be a kid) cakes. However, she placed a 'Nilla Wafer (TM) at the bottom of each cup. Try experimenting with the wafer lightly introduced to a yummy liqueur (definitely not a Grandma thing). Also, please keep in mind things like these are meant as comfort foods to share with dear friends and family, not culinary exploitation pieces. So, be kind and enjoy a small good thing.

I also left out the sour cream mixture, and cut the vanilla in half and used a good ammount of lemon juice. This made it taste like a real cheesecake! I made a topping of reduced pineapple cooked with brown sugar and topped with a marichino cherry- AWESOME if you love pineapple upside down cake!! These will get made very often because they are so easy and look so elegant!

I love cheesecake and it is my favorite thing to eat. I am a big fan if your not, why it is sooo good!

It was good although I didn't like the sour cream topping I just liked it plain. Any topping was good on these. I used many different toppings on my little, convenient cakes.

Substituted 1/2 tsp of almond extract for equal amount of vanilla, then a jigger of amaretto in the topping. Quite nice with sliced-toasted almonds and apricots on top.

I made this dessert and brought it into work. While my fiance and I didn't care for the sour cream topping, my coworkers loved the mini cheesecakes. I added chocolate chips to the batter and frangelico to the topping for a more interesting twist.
