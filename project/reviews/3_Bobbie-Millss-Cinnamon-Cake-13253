This recipe was a big failure for me, and I won't make it again. The cake was so dry and crumbly, I could hardly work with it. The frosting was good, but it didn't matter because the cake was useless.

The cake itself was good and easy to make, but it was dry and crumbly and not as moist as I would have wanted. Perhaps I didn't sift the flour finely enough, or the recipe should use more shortening or oil. The frosting called for entirely too much sugar. I only used about 3 1/4 cups, and that was more than enough. The frosting also got entirely too stiff and I had to add milk to soften it enough for beating and spreading.
