I have to disagree with my previous review. After pureeing the soup I added some shredded smoked gouda. I was pretty good. Even better after several days.

I was disappointed with this recipe. Used chicken broth & added more at the end as it was too thick. I ended up adding cayenne, touch of Asian vinegar (for balance),carmelised onions, Greek yogurt, little whipping cream but still didn't care for it.

Lovely soup, I had a quantity of spinach from my CSA box,and this was a perfect use for those greens. The hard boiled eggs are a must,and, of course, the nutmeg, salt and pepper can be adjusted to taste.

Yum! Went the vegetarian route with modifications: veggie bouillon, 1 tbsp coconut oil and 2 tbsp olive oil instead of butter, spelt flour and brewers yeast for a little cheesy flavor. Added tomato paste to the broth, juice from a blood orange for Vit C to help absorb all the iron and topped with feta cheese instead of eggs. Not so pretty color afterwards but pretty good taste. Not so Norwegian anymore and I live in Sweden :o)

I've been wanting to try this soup for a long time and I'm glad I finally did. It won't be the last time. The combination of spinach and beef bouillon is fantastic. I did use Better than Bouillon beef base, which I think is richer tasting. Like many of the reviewers I did increase the spices, using a teaspoon of nutmeg and double the pepper. The eggs add to the soup as well, don't leave this part out. It made a great, flavorful and filling lunch for my husband and myself with plenty leftover.

Used olive oil instead of butter, no salt and a whole egg per portion, which sunk instead of float but it didn't matter because it was good.

I found that it needed the salt!! Also added more nutmeg and it was divine!!

I used spinach fresh from the garden. Didn't have beef bouillon but substituted WF's Veg broth and a can of CAmpbell's beef consomme. Raves.

Just made this- Wow, totally surprised by the flavor! It is very tasty and filling. I too used an immersion blender after the final simmer; and I really liked the consistency it gave the soup. Next time, I would omit the salt, the bouillon gave it plenty of salt. As a final touch next time, I will toast some toast points and add it to the side. And fresh spinach is the way to go on this one.

Wonderful flavor in this soup despite it's simplicity. Fun to try something so different, but even so the hubby says we probably won't be having it again.

Haven't made this yet, but I can't help but noticing how many people are subbing veggie broth for the meat. I think this is funny because it's exactly what I intended to do when I saw this recipe. I'm also thinking perhaps making it as egg drop instead of with hardboiled egg.

Absolutely delightful.

Wonderful! I also used veggie broth, upped the amount of nutmeg, and pureed the soup. Great flavor!

Left out the salt, used vegetarian stock and upped the nutmeg a little to compensate - turned out great. The colour may put some off - after blending it came out a lovely emerald green, but this contrasted nicely with the egg slices. Good, hearty, humble Scandinavian food.

This soup is a yummer. I used Rapunzel brand bouillon with sea salt and herbs and a pound of prewashed baby spinach. As other reviewers suggested, I did not add the teaspoon of salt listed in the recipe. I pureed it at the end, and loved the rich smooth texture.

I used vegetable stock instead of beef bouillon and a full teaspoon of nutmeg instead of just 1/8. With salted butter, no salting was necessary. Overall, it was simple and especially nice with the egg.

unique flavorful dish. Defineately use fresh spinach instead of frozen, and try veal stock if available.

This was a wonderful hearty soup. Mostly wilted spinach but good stock gives it the real yumminess. A hit at my house.

Thank you for the advice not to add salt, that helped a lot. However, I did not find this recipe to be all that amazing. It was good, and it is different. I think it would be good for any dinner menu to give it a different feel.

I followed the advice to leave out the salt and it was great! Everybody loved it, even though the spinach was way too finely shredded in our awful food processer. The flavors all blend to make a strong but tasty soup. But my big problem was that the egg pieces promptly sunk in the soup, and it looked pretty unappealing(though it tasted good). I recommend using this soup as an appetizer to the Norwegian-style poached salmon with anchovy butter, also on this site.

Get a good, natural beef broth without MSG (monosodium glutamate) and don't add the salt to the recipe. That avoids the oversaltiness. Yes, the eggs and nutmeg make all the difference, I agree.

why anyone would use frozen spinach when you can use fresh, i will never understand.

I don't know how two of the reviewers could have gone wrong. This recipe is so simple and quick. I used chopped frozen spinach (looks almost pureed) so I omitted the 10 min boiling part. I was careful with the amount of bouillon,didn't use salt and just sprinkled in the pepper and nutmeg. I also don't think I followed the other cooking times indicated - just used my judgement which was alot less than 5 min. The eggs make a difference. Add them.

I love beef broth and love spinach but this was not a good combination....very little flavor...wife and I tried one spoon each and into the disposal it went....hope others have better luck than I did....this recipe was better off staying in 1964.....

Delicious!!! I didn't have enough beef stock on hand, so I threw in some chicken stock and even some of the water from boiling the eggs. I also strained the stock after cooking the spinach, to make sure there wasn't any grit from the spinach left. I just eyeballed the quantities of the salt and pepper, and used more nutmeg than called for. The nutmeg and the egg really make the soup. Yum, I had three bowls for dinner and the leftovers for lunch the next day!

This recipe was incredibly too salty for my tastebuds. I ended up throwing most of it out.

If you use a good quality beef base or homemade stock this soup is absolutely fantastic. I served this at a dinner party as an appetizer and it was my favorite part of the meal! (Don't skip the egg slice in the bowl as garnish. It adds a lot to this dish.) It's quick, easy and under 8 grams of fat per serving. I recommend that you serve this with a fresh egg bread to sop the broth.
