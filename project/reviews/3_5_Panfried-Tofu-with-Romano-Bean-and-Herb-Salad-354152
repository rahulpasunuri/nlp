this took waaaaay longer than the recipe says. i should have read the recipe closer and i would have known this to be the case. but it was delicious. like another reviewer, i substituted broccoli for the beans and it was yum. i also put less tarragon than called for because i'm not a huge fan of it. the tofu was good, but a bit greasy - i may have used too much oil, so take caution with this. i'd probably make this again for a dinner with friends - but not just for me. too much work for a just-me meal.

I enjoyed this a lot. I especially loved the salad and dressing. I might make that just on its own for another meal. The tofu was pretty good. I eat tofu in various dishes, but this is the first time I've eaten it like this. It seemed to want something...more salt? It may be that I'm not used to the flavor of soy. It does pair very well with the salad. My guests really loved it. I know they'll make it again. Me? Not sure.

This was surprisingly delicious! The plain flavor of the tofu was complemented perfectly by the flavorful dressing and arugula. We used broccoli instead of beans. The dressing clung to the broccoli which delivered more dressing with every bite.

Fantastic recipe - I'm normally not very excited by tofu, but the egg coating & panfrying got it so yummy and crispy I am sold on this technique. The dressing was great although I don't have a food processor and used a whisk to incorporate the oil in the old-fashioned way. We used 1/2 arugula and 1/2 baby spinach, which worked well, and cut back on the tarragon a bit as it can be overwhelming when raw. A really yummy dish I am going to make again - I suspect I'll play with different ingredients (e.g., asparagus?).

I substituted baby spinach for the arugula and the salad was delicious. Wasn't overly impressed with my tofu, but for lunch leftovers I diced it into the salad. Next time I'll dice it before pan frying and immediately add to the salad. Also, I was thinking while eating my salad that a great (not so healthy and non-vegetarian) addition would be some bacon crumbles. Mmmmm.

Delicious way to serve tofu on a weeknight. Did take slightly longer than I thought though.

I feel like I have been waiting and waiting for tofu cooked at home to taste palatable. This is so good, I have made it twice in two weeks! I did think that having the same dressing on 3 things was a bit overkill, so this time I made it with fresh ears of corn. I added tomatoes and avocados to the salad. Yummy! I ate one piece straight out of the pan.

The salad is fabulous, the combination of green beans, arugula, tarragon and the sauce make a real gourmet salad! I will try it as a side dish for fish or other seafood as well. The tofu is so so. I am not a fan of panfrying....but serving the tofu with the sauce make it taste much better! I used half or less of the vegetable oil required and it worked perfectly.

This is delicious! I didnt really know what to expect (the picture doesnt make it look all that interesting), but the flavors and textures work perfectly. Whod have thought tofu could be French? I made a little extra sauce and adjusted salt and pepper to taste. I also liked cooking the tofu longer so that it got a nice crust on the outside.
