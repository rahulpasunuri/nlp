I have wanted to make these since I saw the recipe in Gourmet in 2006. (better late then never) They have great flavor and texture. I am going to freeze then and see how they reheat. Serving them on St. Patrick's Day with cornbeef hash!

A lot of work, for ho hum results. The smell was incredible, and the dough performed perfectly (rise times accurate, etc.). They were OK when first made. Flavor was unusual, but more muted than I expected. I tried to like it more than I actually liked it. Worst though, they got really dry the next day. I followed the make ahead instructions, but they came out DRY AS A SHUCK!

So I made these a few years ago and people are STILL asking for them at every family event. This year it is the rolls with our Thanksgiving meal.

Makes 12 delicious full-sized muffins that would make good dinner rolls. I left out the star anise and substituted wholemeal flour for the plain, and dark brown sugar instead of molasses. The orange zest is a nice touch.

*Next time I will double the recipe: 24 mini muffins are not worth the effort!* This bread is remarkable. Not heavily spiced but very interesting. I cook too frequently with cumin and caraway, so almost omitted them for a new taste  but I'm glad I didn't! The balance of spices is perfect, such that none overwhelms the others and they harmonize beautifully, creating something truly different. The crust was nice and crunchy, the interior springy and tender. I made two tiny flat loaves instead of the mini muffins, baking them at 350 for 50 minutes; that worked nicely.
