Although good, it wasn't what I was looking for. I am looking for my mother's Viennese recipe for Marillen Knoedel (apricot dumplings) which was only made when the first apricots ripened. The dumpling had small apricots in the center and were rolled in cinnamon and sugar breadcrumbs. If anyone has the recipe, I would really appreciate it. Thanks

I have the Austrian/German version of this. Just write me at aloha@pcmagic.net and I will let you know about the potato dough.

this wasn't quite the recipe I was looking for. Does anyone have a recipe for the German dessert dumplings called KNOEDLS? They were made with a yeast dough and filled with pitted cherries, topped with melted butter, sugar and cinnamon. They are a favourite childhood memory - my father could eat 20 at a sitting! Unfortunately, nobody in my family has the recipe.
