I tried this recipe despite the poor reviews... altered it some and it turned out great! The sugar measurement is off for sure. I did 2 tbsp of sugar and 2 tsp of salt. Worked great! I also ran out of milk so I blended up some water and 1% MF cottage cheese and it lended to a very nice soft inside and crispy outside... also, I added caraway seeds and finely chopped leeks in place of the parsley... they taste marvelous. Try it this way, you won't regret it.

I would really like to try it but that sugar quantity scares mes. what if I don't add sugar?

I wanted a recipe featuring parsley because my parsley was overgrowing everything else in my herb garden. These were really good! I took the advice of others and increased the amount of parsley by about half and the amount of cheese by about half too. I didn't roll them, just kinda formed them, and brushed with a little extra butter before sprinkling with cheese. I also mixed in just a little garlic chives as well. I ended up using quite a bit more liquid than 1 cup because of the extra cheese and because I live in a drier place, so the consistency came out perfectly.

We fixed these biscuits for Christmas dinner. We were terribly disappointed. The balance of savory and sweet just didn't work. They were too sweet...we won't do this again.

I agree that these are just ok. I used 1 1/4C of parmesan and added a couple of Tbl of thyme along with cayenne and they were still just ok. I think it needs more butter?

I'm more likely to have parmesan cheese and fresh parsley on hand than the buttermilk that most biscuits require so likely to make again. That said, thought were just okay and would follow the advice of those who said add extra pepper.

These were really good. I added much more fresh cracked pepper & used a mix of chives & parsley, but added a little more than what was called for. Serving it with the spicy sausage, pasta & garbanzo soup.

We loved these. I added some grated asiago with the parmesan, very nice flavour. I also used 2% milk as it was all I had and they turned out great.

Can these biscuits be frozen and if so, how would you defrost? Used dried parsley instead of fresh. These were very easy to make, but did have to serve with a little butter. Will add more cheese and fresh chives next time for a little more flavor. Overall a fresh and delish homemade biscuit. I always have these ingredients on hand.

Boring, dull, bland. I used parsley and the biscuits just didn't taste like much. If I try this again I will use chives and a whole lot more cheese.

I made these for the first time for a New Year's Eve dinner. I spent days preparing the perfect menu, and all my guests could talk about were the biscuits! I couldn't decide if I should use the parsley or the chives, so I used 1/8 cup of each. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.

Delicious!!!! My family gobbled them down - and even my husband - who doesn't care for biscuits - had nothing but compliments.

Scrumptious biscuits! I added extra cheese and pepper - they smell so good when warmed. I didn't have a biscuit cutter so used the top part of my Quisinart: worked fine. These would be great for company...I froze them, and have been enjoying them on weekends when I don't feel like cooking. Wonderful and easy!
