I have made this recipe many, many times. Very easy. I always add more garlic and use whatever bread/ breadcrumbs I have on hand. Amazing every time.

Made the recipe for Easter this year. It was a huge success. I'm not a fan of lamb in general, but I loved how this turned out.

Great recipe!!!!.It was so easy and so good. It was my first time cooking rack of lamb and it turned out perfect.

I've made this over a dozen times easy and every time I make it, I get compliments. You can definitely use rosemary in place of the thyme. I also love making this with rosemary garlic potatoes and sweet corn. They're such a great combination!

I thought it was excellent! Using double-chop lamb chops i broiled them for 20 min. @ 400 c, and replaced the bread crumbs with toasted almonds like suggested. I will make this again.

An excellent recipe I substituted ground almonds for the bread crumbs I also scored the meat so the mustard cover would penetrate.

Excellent tasting dish. Great for a dinner party! I actually used lamb chops and coated both sides. Other than that, did not change a thing.

Rating: 4
The flavors were delicious. The only problem with the recipe is that I had to cook it a lot longer than the recipe called for. At 25 min, the lamb was still raw.

I was really surprised at how well these came out. Sometimes, simple is better. The only change I made was using loin chops versus a whole rack of lamb. I did this so each bite of lamb had the mustard-thyme crust. A keeper recipe.

Easy and excellent. Lamb was perfectly cooked, tasty, and very tender. I did press on Panko instead of fresh breadcrumbs and then sprinkled them with olive oil.

Fabulous and simple to prepare. Loved the breadcrumb topping~ I always marinate my lamb dishes 6-8 hrs to enhance~served with couscous and roasted carrots/potatos. A keeper!

Another Christmas favorite in our house.

Excellent recipe, would definitely make again. I roasted 4 racks of lamb and used only 1 16 ounce bag of panko bread crumbs and I had plenty left over. Also there is no need to make 4 times the mustard recipe for 4 racks. I would recommend a 400 oven for at least 30 minutes, and then check with an instant read thermometer.

This was very tasty and easy. Didn't need anything but a sprinkling of salt. I'll make it again.

I used a prepared mustard (Stonewall Kitchen's Champagne and Shallot Mustard) paired with lots of chopped parsley, and then used left over wild mushroom couscous as the crust (which I'd dried out on a baking sheet in the oven). Unbelievable. Perfect. Amazing.

Rating: 4
This recipe was a delight! Followed exactly and made a sauce as one cook suggested by reserving half the mustard mixture and simmering with 2T cream and 2T chicken broth...a nice addition. This would be great for a special occasion, but easy enough to fix for an every day meal!

It was very good. It does need some type of sauce. Then it would be awesome

This is the best and easiest rack of lamb recipe I've tried. A full tablespoon of garlic is a lot, though - the first time I made it the garlic didn't cook all the way through, and there was a slightly harsh raw garlic taste. I cut back just a bit now, to about 2 teaspoons or three regular sized cloves. Its really plenty.

Savory, complex and elegant without any fussiness. The lamb comes out extremely juicy and non-gamey. The guests were very content.

This was truly delicious! I had some lovely lamb striploins (rather than racks) so used this recipe as a starting point with a few modifications. I generously sprinkled lamb with coarse sea salt and fresh ground pepper then quickly seared in olive oil over high heat to seal in the juices. I used a combo of Dijon and whole grain mustard, added fresh rosemary as well as thyme, and whisked in an egg yolk which helped the crumb coating to adhere. Rather than toast the breadcrumbs, I melted 2 tbsp. butter and stirred into the crumbs prior to coating the lamb - the crust browned/crisped nicely while roasting. I baked at 400 degrees (my oven runs a little hot) for 20 min. and the lamb was perfectly done (medium-rare) after tenting/resting for 10 minutes before slicing. Very moist, tender and flavourful, this lamb was a gastronomic delight!

This was really delicious, especially taking into account how simple it is! I served it with french bread and a crisp green salad, accompanied with a bottle of Shiraz, which, I think, was a great macth. I used thyme and rosemary together, with thyme being the dominating herb, but next time I will try the other way around. As for the bread crumbs, I first toasted thin slices of bread, and then crushed some if it using pestle and mortar, while crumbling the rest using my fingers. That helped it stick the meat better, I guess.

I served this at a dinner party and the raves were incredible. Everyone said it was the best rack of lamb they had ever tasted. I made four racks (1/2 per person) but certainly didn't need four times the crumbs. I recommend this recipe highly!!

This was delicious. Never cooked a rack of lamb before, but it turned out very well. i substituted rosemary for thyme as other reviewers did, but i included some thyme in with the breadcrumb mixture. The crispy crust did fall off easily, but still delicious. Garlic mashed potatoes, sauteed asparagus, and a good Shiraz. Great meal

This was so easy, elegant, and delicious, although I didn't taste the thyme - perhaps I was a bit overly generous with the garlic? I used an herbed Dijon mustard, which made a surprisingly green coating. Yummy.

Excellent very easy and delicious - I make it at least once a month - I use twice the tyme or rosemary and garlic - I also infuse the oil with garlic and tyme before cooking the bread crumbs. Its a once a month meal for sure.

This is truly a fantastic recipe, however instead of using the thyme I used fresh rosemary and more garlic. My friends keep asking when I am going to have them for dinner again! Try it you will love it and it makes you look soooo good and it's so easy! Canadian Cook in BC

Earlier reviewers have got it right--this is easily the best, the easiest, and the most delicious rack of lamb recipe I've ever prepared (and believe me, I've tried them all). Try substituting rosemary for the thyme in this recipe--another great flavor with lamb. I made this for my husband on our anniversary--he asked me to marry him all over again after the first mouthful!

I was bored of grilling my lamb and this was a nice recipe where I could bake it. The flavour was very nice and the lamb was extremely tender. Definitely suggest a digital thermometer where you can watch it's temp rise as it cooks to get the right doneness.

This is a fabulous way to do rack of lamb! I usually use rosemary instead of the thyme; it just goes so well with lamb. Also, to make a sauce, I reserve about half of the mustard mixture, and to that add a little chicken broth and heavy cream (about 2 T of each). Simmer till slightly thickened. Yummy!

OH MY GOD...is right!!! I cook all the time, and this was one of the easiest and best dishes I have made. Never, ever made a rack of lamb before. Now, it will be one of my new favorites. The 25 minutes was perfect....came out nice and pink and full of flavor. You cannot go wrong with this one! RN

OH MY GOD!! This is the easiest and best rack of lamb recipe I have ever made!! I made this for my wife for Valentine's day... guy's if you want to get "lucky" this is the dish to make for your girl. This is an incredibly simple and elegant main dish. A side of your favorite potatoes and fresh aspargas and your there. Serve this to her on her birthday or other special occasion and be prepared to " rock and roll" You could get creative and add crushed walnuts or macadamia nuts to the crust. Trust me, If you have never cooked anything in your life,you can cook this!

My!Oh! My! This was excellent! I would not change a thing about this recipe! I'm still savoring my evening! I made a white bean and red onion salad for a side,with ciabatta bread and a 1998 Matanzas Creek Merlot. Do I need anything else for the evening? I don't think so!

Made this nice recipe for my son and husband. It was easy and went together very well. They loved it, and pronounced it "a keeper". I didn't change a thing....I never do the 1st time I try a recipe, and I was very happy with it. The lamb was succulent and crusty at the same time. I highly recommend this recipe.

This recipie is so much fun, and so easy. I served it for Easter and everyone loved it. One tip, be a bit more daring than just plian dijon mustard. I bought a dijoun and tarragon mustard dressing, and it was perfect for this dish. SO much better than just plain mustard. Then top it with herbs and pepper. Have fun. Experiment. You will love it.

Tasted great, but as always with lamb the crust never "sticks" very well. Anyway, the crumbs that fall off still taste great. Simple, easy and elegant dish for weeknights or a dinner party.

This very close to a favourite recipe I had lost. I use ground toasted hazelnuts instead of breadcrumbs. Also I use mixed herbs vs. only thyme. Added a rich red currant meat-based gravy with a touch of mint...heaven. No one knew I lost my original recipe. It's important to know that in racks of lamb...the ribs/meat will vary in size per your source. Little ribs are preferred, hence the 15-10 min cooking times you tend to see. For a Welsh treat..make munchep... a blend of mashed potatoes, parsnips, carrots & parsley.

Very easy recipe. I normally do not really like lamb, but this was quite good. Instead of bread crumbs, I used panko crumbs which worked as well. The meat was very tender and moist...

This was OK, I guess I thought the Dijon mustard taste was too strong, maybe I used too much, I didn't measure it out exactly. The bread crumbs very good, but they did fall off when cutting chops apart. I prefer lamb chops than the frenched rack, more expensive than I think it's worth, although I did get it from Costco and they were very tender and meaty. Australian lamb, I think, is much tastier than US.

Have made this many times and it's always wonderful! Just make sure and slice the lamb gently so as not to knock off the crust. This recipe can easily be tripled for six people.

YUMMY- Very simple to prepare, and the taste is excellent. Be sure to trim all the fat from the meat before putting on the mustard and crust. I used 2 cloves of crushed garlic because we love it. Didn't overpower it.

Very very good. Even my 9 year old enjoyed it. I would not use so much bread crumbs. The timing was way off. I had it for 30 min. at 425, then, I had to increase heat to 450 for 10 more minutes to make it medium-rear.
