Lovely flavors and such pretty presentation. I served these at a New Year's Day buffet and they disappeared quickly. I used the zest of two lemons in the creme fraiche. Next time I will use larger potatoes, cut slices slightly thicker (I used a mandoline slicer this time) and use a larger cookie cutter (the 1 1/2" stars are fiddly for guests to pick up and not quite a biteful). If you have olive oil spray it makes prep much easier, brushing the little stars with oil is difficult.

A great appetizer for dinner parties -- my guests loved it! I don't have a mandolin and just sliced the potatoes thinly with a sharp knife. The 2nd time I made this, I used sour cream instead of creme fraiche and it turned out great as well. It looks time-consuming, but is actually quite easy.

I enjoyed this recipie and read the reviews prior to preparing it, as I find this helps. The reviews that don't help, though are those from the likes of "a cook a cook in jersey". Silence is better than smug, stupid, and useless comments.As fo the juice, I used both lime and lemon.

This is a great way to serve/eat caviar! We've added it to our annual New Year's Eve dinner menu. The potatoes are best if they're a little soft in the center and crispy around the edges...just don't over cook them and you'll love it.

I agree with the cook from Freo, but for a nation that can't accept cooking in a Microvave, how can they understand quotes. Real English Fish and chips is cooked in mono saturated fat, making sure the fish is coated in a batter. This recipe (in quotes ) is for a savoury and really looks great and will be very tasty. An Australian addition would be a small wedge of lemon, although I think that a triangle of Tahitian lime, 25mm thick and 100mm triangle would add the zest to set it off.

Duh!!! I wish stupid people would stop reviewing recipes. This is a great site and I'm tired of people who think they are so much more intelligent than the rest of us soiling it with their comments. Did you really think nobody else knew what real 'fish and chips' was?

To the first reviewer below: Of course this isn't authentic fish and chips that's why the recipe title is in quotation marks. But it is a clever interpretaion using fish eggs(caviar) and potato chips. No need to be so closed-minded.

This is not a true Fish 'n Chips recipe. True fish 'n chips consist of fried fish and french fries ("chips").
