Very simple and an excellent use for those grapes that are still fine but people won't eat whole because they're getting a little soft. However, the next time I make it I'm going to reduce the water. This is very refreshing and has a lovely appearance (should look good with whole berries and mint leaves) but it's a bit watery for my tastes.
