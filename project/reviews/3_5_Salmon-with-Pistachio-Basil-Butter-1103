I've been dressing up poached fish fillets with this butter since it first appeared in Bon-Appetit I '92. It's one of my staples.

Used less butter and more basil, garlic, pistachio and lime juice and found the outcome to be delicious, easy and impressive. Despite its simplicity, this dish has what it takes to wow company.

...almost ate all the butter, basil, garlic mixture straight out of the blender. The world is a better place just because of the mixture of these ingredients. I will review the whole recipe if I can stay out of the coating.

Sorry to rate this recipe for only 1 fork but I found it very bland although I add more lime juice, salt, basil and pistachio like other reviewers. I feel bad for my friend's salmon (that he caught), it should have been better with the salmon, but this recipe makes salmon tatse worse.

I would also double the pistachios and basil. I didnt have any dry white wines so I diluted some hard apple cider with water. I also used thai basil leaves. Cook time was alot less (6-7min). Turned out great! I served it on a bed of wild rice with spinach and some haricot verts with shallots.

I made this tonight and it was excellent, i went heavy on the pistachios and doubled the basil and garlic and it was perfect. I had one large (500g) piece of salmon and did 11 min before putting the butter on, then 8 after and it was nicely pink.

sorry- didn't mean to imply this was pesto, just that the amount of basil i use is more the amount you would use in pesto. i definitely do not use pine nuts or cheese, so my version is actually close to the original. by the way...buy the pistachios pre-shelled at trader joes and it's a cinch.

A delicious and easy way to impress anyone. I took the advice of others and doubled the pistachios, basil and garlic while keeping the amount of butter the same. I thought the cooking time was too long at 12 mins (total) and next time, I think I might skip the wine and broil fillets. Enjoy!

My husband and I made this recipe for Easter brunch, and it was a big hit! Love the combination of flavors, and wild rice accompanies it perfectly. As a testament, there were no leftovers of this dish. This one definitely goes into the recipe box!

This pistachio-butter is really delicious, on just about anything. Everyone I serve it to loves it.

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe many times and I love love love the flavors. Tonight was definitely the best incarnation, though: I increased the pistachios and basil so that the topping is more like a crust (only enough butter to hold everything together; this also reduces the heavy feeling of butter plus fatty fish), and because I had very thin filets I broiled them. The crust became wonderfully crunchy and the fish was beautifully cooked.

I rarely give any recipe 4 forks, even the ones I love get 3...but this recipe? I'd give it 5 forks if that was an option! I changed very little to this recipe. I upped the pistachios to 1/3 cup, doubled the basil leaves, doubled the lime juice, and used 4 cloves of garlic. I served this atop a mix of brown and wild rice. To the rice I added salt while it was cooking, and 1/4 cup of wine, spinach, and some of the pistacho-basil butter when the rice was nearly done.

Hey hatestomeasureindelaware. Did you even READ this recipe? The difference is more than wayyyyyy more basil. In pesto (which you seem to think this is) There are pine nuts, cheese and olive oil. Do you even see these ingredients here? Just rate the recipe next time.

i have to say, i searched for this recipe only b/c i lost another similar one i had that i (and everyone) loved! on mine you brush the salmon fillets w/olive oil, sprinkle salt and pepper and grill right before serving. the pesto can be made ahead... major difference is waaaay more basil - more like a standard pesto recipe, and 7 Tb butter and 1 Tbl olive oil. lime does matter! just serve the salmon with a dollop of pesto on top --- YUM!

This is OUTSTANDING ! We are not fans of sweet sauces or glazes for Salmon so this butter was a perfect fit. I upped the pistachios to 1/3 cup, basil to 15 leaves,the garlic two cloves, and used lemon instead of lime. Also used some of the lemon zest.I left the butter amount alone.By making it a bit stronger I used less butter to top the fish which I grilled with Mesquite chips.I sprinkled the wine over the fish letting it rest while the grill was heating up and did not refrigerate the butter. Left over butter? Stir into hot fresh Tomato soup, top crusty french bread,or use on Grilled Chicken. I put my leftovers on a piece of saran wrap shaped into a log and froze it.Now when I need a dab of flavor I slice a piece off.Believe me it did not last long in the freezer. Delicious and will make anyone look like a star.

Wow! The butter smelled so good when I was making it. And the fish got rave reviews! I also put a bit of the butter on the fish with the wine, then the remainder when I put the fish back in the second time. I also had to cook it for a few more minutes than indicated on the recipe (maybe 18 total) b/c of the thickness of the salmon, I think.

I have mixed feelings about this dish. I am a salmon/fish lover and I agree with the cooks from Philadelphia: the butter on this fatty fish is too overwhelming. This is NOT a light meal.

Rating: 4
I've been making this for well over a year and it is fabulous. I've seen some write that the butter is to much with a fatty fish like salmon, but salmon also has a stronger fish flavor than the white meat fish and I think it really balances out the flavors. My 6y/o eats this at least once a month, if not more.

Very light and tasty. I added some of hte butter to the wine sauce like other suggested and it was good. Served with parmesean rice and a green salad. Very nice light meal.

Rating: 4
Wow was this good! I used skinless baby silver coho salmon. I halved everything, using 1 very small garlic clove, and an extra leaf or so of fresh basil (definitely use fresh!) I also cooked it about 1 minute longer at each phase and whisked a bit of the butter into the pan liquid as suggested by previous reviewers. I served it with steamed green beans with a little lime and orange zest. It was wonderful. Definitely making again, often! I'm not a big fan of fish but would like to eat more - this is going to help that along.

Leave roughly 1 tbs of the butter, mix it into the remaining wine after cooking. This makes a great sauce

Rating: 3
Easy and tasty. i melted the butter in the microwave then added nuts and basil and used lemon juice instead. this made for a '"liquid" of wine and butter, + a bit of lemon pepper. Baked for 12-3 minutes w/skin side up. Turned it over and using a slotted spoon basted flesh side for another 5 minutes. Just before serving, poured off most of the liquid and spooned nuts, etc on a bed of fresh basil. Poured liquid over a small side dish of angel hair past, adding more fresh chopped basil. Definately a "keeper."

This was absolutely delicious! It was simple to make and was a really elegant entree for our birthday lunch. Everyone had seconds of the salmon - we'll be making this again soon!

Wonderful and very easy. I would add a little more salt and brush the butter over the salmon, the trick is to make sure you serve it immediately.

I've been making this recipe for over a year. It is delicious and the flavors just stand out in this dish. try it today!

Divine! Used Tilapia instead of Salmon but the butter would be amazing on almost any fish, as well as on chicken. The recipe title leads one to expect a liquidy butter sauce, but this was more like pesto in consistency. Served it with steamed artichokes as a starter - a memorable, easy meal.

Rating: 3
Great combination of flavors. Huge success. Based on prior reviews, I doubled the pistachios,garlic, basil and lime juice. Also, I used bourbon-marinated salmon fillets. One guest who has dined all over the world pronouned this "the best salmon I've EVER had!"

This dish was easy to prepare, and not bad, but I don't think I would make it again. Like a previous reviewer wrote, the butter sauce makes the rich fatty salmon just too too. It might be nice on a leaner fish.

I have to agree with everyone else -- this dish is great! The salmon was so moist and the sauce was delicious. And it couldn't be easier.

A delicious and relatively easy recipe that's impressive to serve to guests. I found that I had lots of the pistachio-basil butter left over, so next time, I've going to halve that part of the recipe. However, I used it to make toast later on.

We really liked this recipe. I increased the amount of dried basil, garlic and lime juice in the butter a little bit. Served the salmon over linguine tossed with the butter, olive oil and coarsely chopped pistachios. May simply flake cooked salmon and serve as pasta dish next time. Left-over butter also good on toast.

After all the good reviews I really wanted to love this, but didn't! The preparation was fairly easy, but the nut/basil flavors didn't really stand out to me. The presentation was pretty, a nice green topping and certainly would have impressed guests.

I gave this one three forks, my husband gave it two and my 10 year old son scraped the herb butter off and just ate the salmon. The fish was incredibly moist. I was a little skimpy with the herb butter on top and next time I will use a little more to cover the entire top of the fish.

My husband and I both loved this. I cut the recipe in half and just used 2 salmon fillets. It's so quick to prepare but it tastes and looks like something you'd get in a restaurant. Really pretty when it comes out of the oven - you have that nice green topping from the basil and pistachios and the peachy colored salmon. I served thin asparagus on the side which I tossed with olive oil, lemon juice, s&p, and baked in the same oven, same amount of time as the fish. I will definitely make this again. It's an easy and fast way to make a usual piece of salmon into a delicious and beautiful dinner.

I have made this recipe many times and everytime it comes out delicious. I have made it for my relatives and they all want the recipe. The only thing I do differently is add more pistachios and more garlic!

To my tastes, and my wife's, this recipe is highly overrated. She gave it a reluctant three forks. I gave it two. As I sit down to write this I think perhaps that one of the problems lies in the use of a butter sauce with an already fatty fish--a bit too much for my tastes. Also, admittedly, we aren't crazy about salmon but there have been exceptions. Our top dog: Glazed Grilled Salmon. We also enjoyed seared salmon with Horseradish Mustard Vinaigrette.

I've been making this for years, and we never get tired of it -- it's so delicious, and incredibly easy. I make a double or quadruple batch of the butter mix, roll it into "logs," and freeze it to use when unexpected guests arrive or whenever I need a great dinner in a hurry.

My friend is known for burning pots when boiling water, and I've been teaching her to cook with minimal success. After I tried this recipe and discovered how easy it was I sent it to her. Not only is it delicious but it was so easy to make that even she was able to make it perfectly the first time with out my help. It is also wonderful with basil pasta (premade). I used the extra pan sauce for the pasta to tie the two together, or drizzle the extra sauce over sourdough bread...yum.

The Salmon with Pistachio Basil Butter was not only so EASY to make but absolutely heavenly to eat ... I literally rolled my eyes in ecstasy! *smile* Serving suggestions of steamed baby vegetables or baby potatoes with a salad, some french bread, and a creamy chardonnay! Also, with my oven, I cooked it an extra 5 minutes so be sure to test it for flakiness before you serve it!
