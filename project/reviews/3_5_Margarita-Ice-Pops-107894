I'm seriously confused. Does enough tequila stick to the lime pop to make a difference. I love tequila, and love TJ lime popsicles so this sounds great but i just don't get it! (Dorry to be dense)

Perhaps someone can clear up something... what effect does pouring a little bit of tequila over the pops make? Doe sit even stay on long enough to be worth it? It seems to me that it would be a very temporary flavor and that you would soon be eating nothing but a lime-pop. Could someone who has made it clarify this a bit please?

Ok, they may be 'Lazy' but that doesn't mean that aren't fun and yummy. I served these at a party for Cinco de Mayo and everyone loved them. The lime popsicles also compliment mexican beers that would normally be served with lime.

lazy? we are talking about dipping popsicles in tequila here...why the need to be critical? Personally, I'd be happy to meet the great mind that conceived this lovely plan - hats off.

What a fun idea! I served this at a casual late-afternoon luncheon on the back patio. Very summery and easy.

For the previous reviewers, a recipe doesn't have to have a million ingredients to be a successful dish. If you have access to natural lime pops, then the recipe is a unique "grownup" way to serve popsicles. Also, there is a picture attached to the recipe, so instead asking "do you serve them in a glass?", you can see the presentation, in color.

Is this a joke???

Cook from Columbus: you are not alone in your confusion. I think I initially also did not understand the "recipe", partially because it is so silly. Pretty much you take a convenience product, pour some tequila over it, and dip it in salt. Why are the people at Bon Appetit becoming so lazy? People have every right to criticize this lack of effort.

OK be kind, but I'm not sure I understand this recipe. Do they mean just salt pops, put in a glass and pour lime/tequilla over? Do you eat it out of the glass? I think I would rather make my own pops with basically frozen margaritas then dip in salt.
