Listen to the reviews and REDUCE the amount of SUGAR. I went down to 1/2 cup and it was still pretty sweet. Next time I'll either go down to 1/4 cup or omit it all together. I used the canned coconut milk you find in Asian markets, but maybe the ones you find in the fridge at the grocery stores are less sweet? Other than that this is a very good recipe!

I love this recipe! I was concerned about the sugar, so I only put a 1/2 cup and that was sweet enough--can't imagine what it would have tasted like with more than that. It is a delicious pudding!

Decent and different! I used light coconut milk for all of the coconut milk called for rather than half and half, and because of the prior review, I cut the sugar back to one cup. Next time I would probably cut it back to 1/4 of a cup -- this is REALLY SWEET. To be honest, the coconut milk alone probably makes it more than sweet enough. I also grated some fresh ginger because I have no ground ginger, and it worked just fine. The raisins plump up while cooking and are a delicious addition. Of note, I think it could all probably stand to be cooked a little bit more to ensure more thickness, but still tastes quite good!

Delicious! I omitted the raisins and used coconut oil instead of canola oil. I also used the food processor for the sweet potatoes and coconut oil. Turned out great but it is very sweet! next time I would use less sugar. I initially served it warm but eating the leftovers... I prefer it chilled. It chilled to an excellent pudding texture. Unique recipe and very delicious!
