I made this for an Oktoberfest party and it was a hit! Even people that don't like potato salad said they liked this one. One note: I boiled 2lb of white round potatoes (boiler potatoes) in salt water and then sliced them. And for the salad, I made a few substitutions: 1) used 1T of cornstarch as the thickening agent 2) used 1/3 C of sugar 3) used 6 slices of thick sliced bacon 4) used 2-3 T of bacon fat (not all of it) I also thought that the dressing was more than enough so I had about 1/3 of the dressing left over.

In a word ... YUMMY! The recipe is a definite keeper.

Of all the German Potato Salad recipes on this site, this one sounds the closest to the way my mother (and now I) prepare it. Instead of flour, I use cornstarch as a thickening agent. It makes a lovely, clear dressing without the floury taste. I also add chopped celery and green pepper (sometimes some red), and tend to make it more tart than sweet, though it's good both ways. Depends on personal choice. Rosemary sounds like a nice touch, though I've never used it.

Very simple and easy to make. My family loves bacon so I added few more slices. I would also do a little less sugar because we like the vinegar taste, but overall it is a keeper and i have had several request for me to make it again.

Can't get more authentic than this. Incredible flavors. Why anyone would put mayo in their potato salad is beyond me. Fresh and delicious.Only added 1/4 c sugar. I feel like you could omit some if not all of the bacon grease. I didn't, but plan to next time around. My husband and neighbors loved this

Rating: 4
I halved the bacon, salt, and sugar, and threw in a bit of olive oil to compensate for the missing bacon grease. I might even use less sugar next time. It was still pretty sweet. And I just plain forgot the onion. I wouldn't leave it out intentionally, but it was very good even without it.

My Oma made this for me all the time when I was a kid! I LOVED it and i hate traditional potato salad! She added boiled eggs to it and a beef bullion in the water. I don't think she put that much sugar in there. MMMMMMMM! Just thought someone else might like to try it that way.

really good. The only thing I changed from the original was to pour off most of the bacon fat - there was still plenty. Another time I would probably add a little more mustard and a little less sugar but it was good the way it was.

This recipe is definitely real German potato salad, not the fake stuff they sell in the supermarket. It is the only way to go. One thing I did do, I had a lot to do when I was making it as I was preparing for a large party. Julia Child has this thing about slicing the potatoes before cooking them for French style potato salad. I tried it. It saves tons of time because the potatoes cook in 5-10 minutes. You do not hurt your hands handling hot potatoes. Plus, the potatoes are ready to dress when cooked. Try it.

The recipie, as it stands, is great and people have loved this. In our family, however, we're not big fans of sweet food. I cut the sugar and pepper in half. The parsley isn't necessary.

I made this last night to serve with fresh bratwurst boiled in beer and onion, then grilled. I made is essentially true to the recipe, rosemary and all. I did modify the bacon because there was no weight specified and I have my bacon cut somewhat thicker than the norm. The vinegar I used was white wine vinegar and I cut down the salt and sugar a bit. I used skin-on new crop redskin potatoes that I sliced to 4 mm in a food processor. I boiled them about 5 minutes in salted water and drained them and poured the dressing, bacon crumbles and fresh parsley. I think the sweet, salty, tart flavors were in balance. The comments about "rosemary not being 'typical' were kind of amusing to me. It is an ethnic dish. Isn't saying 'not typical' pretty much the case when making a food that you have not prepared before? The first time I made Steak au Poivre, deglazing the pan with Cognac was not typical for my family, either but they loved it.

Recipe was tasty, and came together quickly. Used sliced red potatoes, cider vinegar, and dijon mustard because it's what I had. Also chose to leave out the rosemary. Know that dry mustard would have lent that extra spicy tang. Served with blue cheese topped grilled burgers.

I LOVE this recipe! This IS the recipe given to me by my German grandmother (who got it from her grandmother), except it never had rosemary or mustard in it and had a lot more onion. I use about 2 medium onions for 3-4 lbs of potatoes. I cook the onions in the bacon fat until translucent before sprinking with the flour and cooking a bit more. Lately I have modified it slightly from my grandmother's original by using small boiled red potatoes leaving the skins on and then quartering them. (She always peeled them.) It's good to make this a day ahead to let the sweet and sour sauce soak in well and then reheat before serving. (A couple of times I have had so- called German potato salad served cold. Blech!) The essence of this recipe is the sweet and sour sauce. I usually use cider vinegar and cook it to the consistancy of thin gravy before pouring over the cut potatoes.

I made this recipe for the first time for a crowd of 150. I had never had German potato salad before but I had volunteered to make a German feast for our school. We had many fabulous dishes but this one had the most heart felt positive reviews. People in their 40's, 50's and 60's were almost teary eyed saying they haven't had German Potato salad like this since their grand mother died. I am a good cook and I get lots of compliments but I can say the complements were for the recipe. I would make this again and again. Don't take out the rosemary. I would use apple cider vinegar and as much bacon as you feel like. I noticed some reviewers added more sauce. I can not be sure because I increased the recipe so much but it is likely I didn't drain an awful lot of the bacon drippings. This is not a recipe to make when your goal is to reduce your cholesterol. It is a recipe to bring back old memories. Thank you PEM

not so good. i cut the sugar by about half and it was still too sweet for me, which was offputting, and the sugar syrup/bacon fat combo just sort of sat on the potatoes without getting absorbed very much. Guests seemed to like it and it was mostly gone, but if i ever made this again i'd probably drop the sugar down to about a tablespoon.

Made this yesterday and LOVED it. Thought it was the best German Potato Salad I had. My husband loved it too and he's German.However, I nade a few adjustments to it. I used turkey bacon instead and added olive oil to compensate for the lack of grease that comes from cooking it. I used about 3 tablespoons of less sugar and I omitted the rosemary. I didn't have any any dry mustard so i used coarse grain mustard instead. I also added sliced boiled eggs to it, which I highly recommend. The traditional German potato salads always have egg in them and I thought the sweet, vinegary dressing was very complimentary to the slices of egg. This recipe is a definite keeper and I will now be making this for years to come.

Rating: 3
This came out good. I skipped the rosemary, though I had some, it didn't need it. Added a bit more vinegar at the end because we like it to have bite. Used 9 slices of regular cut bacon, used kitchen scissors to cut it into little pieces before cooking. went over very well at a small get together. I also made it ahead of time and reheated it as a reviewer suggested, the only complaint I had about the reheating is the nice sauce that covers it had all been absorbed by the time we reheated, so you may want to make double and add the second half when you reheat.

Rating: 3
I omitted the bacon grease and flour, and added a little olive oil instead. Looks like a lot of 'liquid' but the potatoes eventually absorb most of it. Wish they noted how long to cook the potatoes. I boiled mine for about 12 minutes and they seem a bit too mushy for potato salad. but all in all in tasted pretty good.

Rating: 3
Delicious. I took this to a potluck and received many compliments. I used turkey bacon and a little canola oil as I had very little fat from the bacon. I tried halving the sugar, as some reviewers suggested; I ended up adding a little more and tasting along the way, and found the full amount of sugar tasted great. I'll make this again.

Rating: 4
This was wonderful! And it was surprisingly easy. I did half the sugar and excluded the mustard (personal taste). I found the quart measurement for potatoes a bit odd. I would say to use about 1 kg (2.2lbs) for this recipie. Definitely a keeper!

yes, pru, try it with the cider vinegar. it's great!

Rating: 4
This is a delicious recipe; have made it twice so far. I do wish, however, that it specified what kind of vinegar to use. I can't remember what I used last year, but I just made it today with red wine vinegar and I'm not sure I picked the right one - the flavor seems a bit mild. I'm going to try cider vinegar next time. The only thing I plan to do differently next time is cut the sugar in half. It's slightly too sweet for my taste. But honestly, this is one of those wonderful recipes that if you make enough times and slightly tailor the amounts (don't omit anything, especially the bacon! just adjust amounts) to your taste, it will become a perfect family favorite.

omitted the bacon???!!! yikes!!!i have a delicious german potato salad recipe of my own so i havent made this version, but i just had to comment... im all for changing a recipe to suit yourself, but bacon is a key ingredient in this dish ... its all about the great bacon flavor with the onions, vinegar, sugar, etc all melding together with the potatoes... without the bacon it just isnt the same dish...you might as well omit the potatoes!!!!

Rating: 4
I made this for Mother's Day and it was a hit! I made a lot of changes based on other people's reviews. Here's a summary of the changes: Double the amount of bacon and cut it up before frying to save time. But, cut back on the amount of bacon grease. Bake potatoes (yukon gold) to almost done instead of boiling them, then cut them up. (About 4 lbs). Use (just under) 1/4 c sugar, 1/2 c vinegar, 1/4 t rosemary, one half cup onion, 1 t salt, 2 t prepared german mustard (instead of powdered mustard). Brown flour and onion in bacon grease before adding the rest of the ingredients. Make this the day before and reheat in 350 oven for 45 min. Delish!

I made this for a party and everyone loved it. I had many requests for the recipe. Based on other reviews which sugested reducing the amount of sugar, I used less than 1/3 cups sugar for a double recipe. This was a little on the tart side and next time I'll use more (somewhere between 1/3 and 1/2 cup) to smooth it out a bit. Overall though, a really yummy recipe.

This dish is awesome. I take it everywhere. However, a neat trick is to bake your potatoes instead of boiling them, they don't get mushy and I add alittle more bacon. Not greasy at all. Even the kids like it :) I usually double the recipe.

I've made this recipe 2 or 3 times already. Like other people, I used at least half as much sugar and put in a little extra potato to the amount of sauce made. The one time I forgot to put in less sugar, I found it inedible. Fresh parsley in my opinion, makes a big difference, and I also went light on the rosemary. I normally do not like potato salad, but this is one I crave. Even my husband who normally likes mayo based potato salads, really liked it.

i dont like to be negative about anything so this is hard! ive been a cook for 12 years now im usualy pretty good adjusting something that looks like it might clash. but ive never tried to make german potato salad so i followed the recipe. i figure if you like this you have never had it made by a real german! it was too sweet, the vinigar ammount was rong. it actualy gave me gut rot after eating it because i used all the bacon grease like they said and i even strained it. im sory guys this is just plain bad!

Use red onion, a whole one, to add color and taste. Substitute cayenne for the black pepper, reduce sugar to 1 tbs. and vinegar to 1/2 cup - also, prepared dijon mustard works fine. Using red potatoes 1/2 inch slices adds color. - As altered, the recipe is actually quite good - as written, so-so [why bother?].

I served this on the same day that I made it and it was too sour. On the next day it was less-so, but still a bit too sour. Next time I would cut the vinegar down to 1/2 cup and taste it first. Overall it was very good and I will make it again.

This is fabulous!! I often have dinner in a little German restaruant where I live, and always order a side of their German Potato Salad. The first two bites are always delicious, but I can never finish it because by the 5-6th bite I am nearly gagging over the vinegar taste. I was afraid the same thing would happen with this recipe, but was very pleased that there is only a light vinegar tang to this recipe. I did make a few changes though, such as omitting the rosemary. I used red potatoes and left the skins on - makes a very pretty presentation - used a whole,medium onion instead of only the 4 tsp. called for, and used dried parsley instead of fresh. All in all, this is an excellent recipe that I plan on making for our family reunion next month.

I've made this according to the recipe above many times - it's great! Also, I had a "clean out the icebox day" last week, and made it with: ham instead of bacon, curry powder instead of mustard powder, apple cider vinegar instead of regular and a dash of brown mustard just to satisfy what was left of the purist in me. I have to say that it was really really good. I thought i was just wasting perfectly good potatos while I was doing it - but I'll be damned if it wasn't really good. 'Just goes to show you really can't mess up a fundamentally sound dish. ;)

this is a wonderful, simple salad. I used white wine vinegar, omitted the rosemary,and used 1/4c. diced red onion. I also added the flour to the sauted onions to make a roux. Followed the seasoning directions exactly. I also only cook with kosher salt or sea salt.

I was in the mood for german potato salad when I found this one. I had all of the ingredients except the rosemary and white vinegar, so I substituted marjoram for the rosemary and seasoned rice vinegar for the white vinegar. Since my seasoned rice vinegar already had sugar added, i omitted all of the sugar from the recipe. It turned out fabulous! From now on I think I will continue to use marjoram instead of the rosemary in this recipe. Try it!

I served this dish with Grilled Kielbasa, sauerkraut, and a hearty brown bread. It was delicious! My husband and I really enjoyed it, and I will definitely make it again. If I was to suggest one thing, I would say to go easy on the Rosemary. It can be very overpowering if you are not careful. :o)

This recipe was easy and delicious, prepared as printed, with the exception of oven-frying the bacon and using nine peices of bacon instead of eight (I just wanted to eat a piece of bacon, but then that meant that I used the fat of nine pieces of bacon, rather than eight). I served it at an Oktoberfest party, and everyone loved it. I made the recipe the night before and then stored it covered with plastic wrap in a Pyrex dish in the refrigerator, reheating it (replacing the plastic wrap with foil) at 400° for 45 minutes before serving.

Made this dish for an Oktoberfest party in Hawaii. Just about as far away from Germany as you can get. It got good reviews from all but the one that counted was from a German guest. I used half as much sugar as the recipe called for. I was told that the sugar offsets the acidity of the vinegar so I'll try it again with the full amount of sugar.

Served it at a potluck yesterday - everyone raved and asked for the recipe. I left out the rosemary and cut the sugar in half. Cooked more potatoes than the recipe called for (I used Yukon Gold), so stretched the dressing with canned chicken broth and a little olive oil. Added minced red onion for crunch. Made it the night before and let it come to room temp. Delicious.

I served this at our last pool party/bbq to rave reviews. I used unseasoned rice wine vinegar and cut the sugar to 1/8th cup. Also, I substituted green onions for regular onions and added a little celery salt. Finally, halved baby yukon potatoes added a buttery flavor that finished the dish well. The only criticism I have is that it lacked a little crunch. Next time, I may add chopped celery or some other unassuming vegetable.

To those annoyed with the bacon frying: Bake it in the oven at 350 - 375 degrees for about 20 minutes. Check it about 10 minutes into it or when you begion to smell it and then every 2 minutes or so thereafter. It browns quickly at the end. There is virtually no mess, it is incredibly easy and the bacon comes out beautifully!

My friend insisted that the dry mustard be replaced by real mustard and that that it also must contain pickles. I did that and it ended up too sweet for him. I think the there was too much sugar in the recipe to begin with and the pickles added a bit too much liquid. Otherwise, this was a great recipe. Frying the bacon was difficult so I think next time I will get the pre-cooked package and just add oil in a pan.

Flashback!!! Very close to what mom and nana used to make. The closest recipe on your site to authentic German potato salad. I made this for the company pot luck and everyone loved it. I cut down on the sugar and allowed the flour and onion to brown slightly before adding the water and vinegar. Also, since I was short on time(and clean pans), I sliced the bacon prior to frying it. It cooked fast, and I thought was crispier than if they were fried whole. Definitely a keeper.

Better than mother used to make! However,I only used about a third of a cup of sugar, 1/2 tsp of dry mustard, and 1 tsp of salt (4 teaspoons of salt seems like an awful lot of salt, especially considering the bacon in the recipe). Turned out perfect--the only thing I may do the next time is reduce the rosemary just a bit, as I thought it may have been just a little more pronounced than I like, but it depends on your taste.

THIS is German potato salad... if mom made it when you were a kid, follow the recipe and prepare to feel nostalgic. I first made this again in March, to serve with grilled meats, and have made it twice more since then. The snap of the vinegar on your tongue blends so well with the salty bacon and the touch of sweet sugar. Make it ahead of time, leaving the potatoes somewhat firm, then cover and place in a warm oven to allow flavors to mingle and intensify. YUM!!!
