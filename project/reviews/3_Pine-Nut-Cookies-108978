These were wonderful! We are an Italian household and enjoyed them with a nice Vin Santo. My husband and Father in law could not get enough. Even the non Italian friends called them "Crack Cookies" cause they couldn't stop eating them! I am making ANOTHER batch now (you have to buy pine nuts at Sams or Costco.)

Excellent recipe - best one out there. The lemon zest really makes the difference here. I am making again tomorrow because my daughter in law keeps eating them up! Note, I buy my pine nuts at Costco or Sams Club in bulk - saves $$$!

Wonderful cookies... my mother liked them so much that she asked me to make a second batch for her to freeze and bake when I'm gone. These are light and a bit cruchy, but also chewy, and spectacular with vanilla or hazlenut gelato.

The batter tastes like traditional pignoli (pine nut) cookies, however the baking time (20min) must be incorrect because when these cookies were done they were HARD as a rock--not soft in the middle as they are supposed to be--if you make this recipe I would reduce the baking time to 10-15 minutes (depending on your oven) and even possibly the temperature to 325 degrees. It is honestly the first time I have ever baked something no one in the family even went near!

As the One fork says - just so-so, and given the pine nuts, they were VERY expensive cookies. Mine, too, became rock hard -- I had to try to push them on family members at Christmas time as biscotti. Perhaps like the other reviewer suggested, cooking for a shorter time would mitigate the tooth-breaking texture, but I won't be making them again to test that theory. The taste was just not that good.

Blech! Agree with the other reviewer tasteless and tough! Don't waste your money.

Tasted great when first made but they just don't keep well. After one day they were really, really hard. I stored in airtight container, but that didn't help. I would make again only if they will be eaten immediately.

Excellent. Was making them for Christmas and my family keeps eating them so quickly that I had to make more if I wanted to go around to friends. My only recommendation is to be careful as to how long you cook them. The recipe calls to bake for 20 min. I have a Viking oven and maybe it is a bit more true to temp, but in 20 min they lightly brown. I find when they cool they are not as soft in the inside as they were whrn I cooked them for about 15min. They look white but will brown over a little on the cooling rack. That way they stay soft in the middle. Very tasty!!!

I bake cookies once a year - at Christmas. When I found this recipe and made it I struck gold. They are incredibly gourmet delcisous, worth the time and worth the word celebration. What a find!

These were delicious! WOWser! Definitely different from any other cookie that dips its hand & whole arm, practically, into the chocolate barrel. I was definitely pleased with the softeness factor & surprised that the cookies don't spread when placed on the cookie-sheet. You definitely can bake quite a few cookies on the sheet with this variety. The only thing, I didn't like much was the stickyness. Even after I placed the dough into the frig to chill a bit, the sticky-factor still reared it's ugly head. Overall, I would definitely make this cookie again & again. I really enjoyed working with marzipan/almond paste, gives the dough a sweet but lighter taste. & the pine nuts were a nice addition, though I didn't chop them up like the recipe suggested. I just left them whole & they turned out great.

These are now added to my Christmas Cookie list! I followed the recipie as is and they were delicious! Also an extremly easy cookie to make. Next time I will try to double this and also try some cookies in log shapes to see what happens...I had never used almond paste before in a recipie but it was simple and delicious!

I've found a new Christmas cookie! It's a nice change from the usual heavy-chocolate-sugary standard. They're delicious and easy! Best when fresh, but they freeze very well.

If you have had the pleasure of the pistachio macaroons from Mike's Pastry in Boston's Northend, you will understand that any cookies that resembles Mike's is great. These do!
