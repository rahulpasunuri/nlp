I thought this was a great weeknight meal. Flavour was good, not over the top. I added ginger, kind of by accident, but it made for a nice addition.

I appreciate delicate dishes(ie cantonese dishes) with not alot of spices going on, but this dish seems to miss the mark, especailly for a Viet. dish which are full of flavors

I made this for me and two friends and one loved it and the other two of us weren't impressed. I used dried shitake mushrooms from an asian market, and reconstituted the mushrooms of course. I thought it was tasty, but it probably needed more jalepeno and some more sauce. I probably won't give it another shot, though, because I think I realized I'm not a shitake fan. I'll just try another recipe next time.

This was easy and tasty. I added more jalapenos and lemongrass. I also doubled the fish sauce and sugar to make it saucier.

Absolutely loved this!! The only substitution I made was adding Hungarian wax peppers instead. It was the only thing I had available in the garden. So many flavors, it really enhanced the wine we were drinking as well.

I used the basic sauce for this (including the lemongrass part) to make a stir fry. i had to increase the amount of sauce because there was a lot more vegetables, but it turned out pretty good. also had to add a bit of soy sauce and some sriracha for a kick.

I made this for my parents using a sesame flavored firm tofu. I fried the tofu until it was really firm and it was wonderful. Easy and delicious!

Pleasant, but no big deal. There are better tofu recipes out there -- this doesn't provide enough flavor due to the low quantity of sauce. That said, let me point out that I didn't deep fry the tofu, but rather pan fried it in spray and a touch of oil. But given tofu's inhgerent blandness, and also given that it did crisp up very nicely, I don't think my healthy modification impacted the taste.

very tasty and so quick to make! I pan fried the tofu as suggested, worked OK but took consdierably longer than 2 minutes to get it golden brown. This recipe works well with chicken for those who don't like tofu. A definite keeper!!

I am not a big tofu fan, but this was pretty good. My husband actually loved it. I marinated the tofu in soy sauce in order to give it some flavor and I also more pan- than deep-fried the tofu. I used hot pepper flakes instead of the jalapeño chili.

Very nice recipe. We added 1 additional clove of garlic and used 1 heaping tablespoon of chili-garlic sauce instead of the jalapenos to give it more of a saucy flavor. I would give our version 4 forks - it was excellent! Always nice to find new ways to use tofu.

This dish has potential, but as written the recipe was a little low on flavor for my taste. I'll make it again but next time will add a bit more jalapeno and lemongrass. I also pan-fried the tofu rather than deep-frying, to make it healthier. It worked great.

Excellent.

We liked this dish a lot, but it wasn't thrilling--somewhat like other dishes i've made. I added carrots and broccoli for color and more veggies, I would add more mushrooms as well as peanuts next time. I served it over coconut rice (rice simmered with 1/2 water, 1/2 coconut milk) and it was the PERFECT combo, really completed the dish.

This is great! I pan-fried rather than deep fried the tofu which worked fine and is a little healthier. I will add more veggies next time.

Mmmmmmmmm....fresh lemongrass and fish sauce are key, don't try to substitute them if possible. I added broccoli for extra veggie. Yum!

This was great! And so easy to make. I added the fish sauce earlier than the instructions said (with the lemongrass, garlic, etc.) to give it more time to mellow out and mingle with the other flavors. It worked - it didn't taste the least bit fishy and all the flavors came together really well.

One of my favorites! So fast and delicious. I also use frozen lemongrass from the asian market and add some dried chile pepper flakes to add a little spice. Serve over brown rice. Yummy!

You only use the stalk of the lemon grass, up till it's no longer pink/purple in the center. Cut the stalk about 4" from the root end and examine the center of the stalk. The leaves have very little aroma. If you live near a well stocked Asian grocery store, ask if they have any frozen lemongrass. These are already minced... and handy. The aroma is not as strong as fresh lemongrass, so just use extra in your recipes.

OK I am stumpted! How do you utilize the fresh lemongrass? I can find no one who speaks English who know if you just use the root or if you use the tall stalks. Can you please help me? This recipe looks terrific but I cannot proceed until I get the lemongrass figured out!

I doubled this for vegetarian guests, and it was a hit. And I doubled pepper proportion (used 2). Fresh lemongrass is not easy to come by where I live, so I keep dried on hand--for this, I processed it with garlic and chili. I often find stir-fries boring--this one definitely wasn't and we'll make again.

Very good. Even my husband who made a face when I told we were having tofu for dinner finished his off and liked it. I used red and yellow peppers and crimini mushrooms and it was great.
