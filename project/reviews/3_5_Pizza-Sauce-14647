I don't get it. Tomatoes and olive oil? Seriously? That's not sauce. That's...tomatoes and olive oil. Maybe add come basil, salt, pepper, oregano, garlic.

Made this for years but then came across this deep dish pizza recipe. http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/chicago-style-deep-dish-pizzas-recipe/index.html Was not crazy about the whole deep dish thing but the sauce is now my go to. Sorry about the cross linking to that other site but all is fair in the kitchen.

EXCELLENT! Added 2 frozen "blobs" of tomato paste (3 T.), 2 large cloves garlic, fresh oregano, red pepper, basil, thyme. Used immersion blender to smooth it out and had leftovers. Froze in muffin tins for future quick pizza "blobs". Unbelievably good leftover flavor AS WELL AS on the pizza itself. Made a GREAT 5 STAR carb-less cauliflower pizza crust too. Whole family of men & boys LOVED it!!!

This is the perfect canvas for creating your own taste. I like to chop up a couple of cloves of garlic, add fresh oregano, a pinch of sugar, a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes, and let it simmer for a couple of hours (if I can). I will salt to taste towards the end of simmering.

How about adding salt, pepper, and your seasoning of preference. Basil, oregano, or an Italian blend. This recipe is just tomatoes and oil, how uninteresting.

This is by far the best homemade pizza sauce I have ever tasted, I did add a couple of garlic cloves,pinch of sugar and some Italian herbs. It was super easy to make. Will be a staple in my recipe box.

This is the yummiest pizza sauce and so easy to make! I sauteed some garlic and added fresh oregano, red pepper, salt and a little balsamic to kick up the flavor. So good on french bread style pizza.

Kind of boring as written, even with Italian seasoned tomatos. It is a good base recipe, and is quite good with the addition of a pinch of sugar and garlic.

This was so easy to make and it tasted great. I also added sugar as another reviewer suggested and some Italian seasoning.

Excellent sauce, the absolute best I've ever tated! I only added oregano and a little garlic to the initial recipe. The flavor is that of a sweet, fresh roasted tomato.

i had a good 2 cups worth of tomatos i'd grown on my apartment balcony. this was great as an alternative to eating them whole. i took the advice from the person who added the sugar and it turned out great. i used nothing but fresh market mozzerella and pepperoni to top it with.

Made this with Williams Sonoma pizza dough recipe. Used the "00" flour, imported from Italy. Added 2 cloves fresh garlic, sliced, to the sauce and a pinch of red pepper flakes. All 3 kids raved. My son said it was the best pizza he had ever eaten. This is a good one!

This is the first homemade pizza sauce that I have made that my son has liked. He actually said it was really good and gave me the thumbs up. The only additions I made were to add garlic and oregano to the sauce, and I let it simmer for about an hour.

Simple yet delicious pizza sauce. For pizza sauce, it doesn't have to be fancy, but this is definitely worth doing instead of just buying a bottle of prego.

This is a great pizza sauce. I fry a couple of cloves of garlic in the oil and then remove them before adding the tomato. I also sometimes add a splash of red wine vinegar and some oregano towards the end of the simmering.

This gives a perfect consistency, but the taste is a little bland unless you're going to put a lot of toppings on your pizza. For a bit more flavor, I add a couple teaspoons sugar and some dried basil and oregano to taste. However, this remains my basic recipe, and I do recommend it as a base.

Made the first time w/all on hand, canned tomatoes & cheap evoo & very good. Next time made w/6 IN 1 brand ground tomatoes in puree & same oil & fantastic. Simplicity. I like to add the garlic, oregano or fresh basil, etc to the pizza as topping. I did simmer each time for an hour or more. Saturday night pizza is back!

This recipe gave me a bit of inspiration. When making pizza for just the two of us I use one can of diced tomatoes in puree and one small can tomato sauce. I start off with olive oil and add a couple cloves of garlic (the more the merrier) and then add fresh oregano, salt, and crushed red pepper to taste. As it is cooling I throw in a teaspoon of sugar and several fresh basil leaves. Very yummy!

Rating: 4
I loved this simple sauce. I modified it slightly to suit our tastes - first sauteed 3 cloves of minced garlic in evoo, added a dash of hot pepper flakes and about 1/2 cup wine. I let that reduce a minute or two, then followed the recipe. It was fantastic and so simple. Much richer than you would expect. I am making it tonight again - it's my go to Friday night pizza sauce.

ok, 3 forks, but with modifications. I used roasted garlic & roasted garlic olive oil (from the epicurious site),a bit of crushed red pepper 'cause I like it with a bite, and some minced fresh oregano to taste. Aside from measuring the oil, dont ask how much, cause I always eyeball it. Being half italian, I was taught this basic rule: Pasta sauce (gravy) gets basil, pizza sauce gets oregano. But it's your sauce, season it how you like! For me, it's not "real food" without garlic! lol! An hour simmering in the pot minimum, and let it sit - dont use it till the next day! yum!! You can even put this on whole wheat pita with some nice mozz and a good romano, toss it in the toaster oven till the cheese melts and it'll taste awesome. Just imagine it on a good pizza dough with your favorite fixin's!

This was exactly what I was looking for - who knew it was so simple! I added a little oregano and basil and cooked it for almost an hour.

This was delicious! I made it exactly as written (always do the first time) with Muir Glen tomatoes, kalamata olive oil, and sea salt. (Wear an old smock - it spatters and leaves oil stains!) I did take one cook's advice and simmer for an hour (watching carefully) - I think that's how long it takes to get to the right consistency. Furthermore, if you let it go an hour, it tastes like sun dried tomatoes in the end! Delicious and easy!

Great, simple recipe. I keep it unchanged for my kids. For my husband and me I throw in basil and garlic.

Don't write this off just because it has two ingredients. The magic is in the long, slow simmer. I would say that you pretty much have to use San Marzano crushed (or pureed) tomatoes. Like others, I added pressed garlic to the oil for 1 minute and then added the tomato sauce and a t of sugar. It was so good, I purposefully didn't use all of it for the pizza so that I could eat it. Made the best pizza I've ever eaten, or made (and I've made many a complicated sauce).

Rating: 4
This pizza sauce is perfection, and how pizza sauce should taste. I added a little garlic to the simmering sauce, and then about 3 large finely minced basil leaves as it cooled. Excellent! Just watch the salt as it is cooling, mine needed very little. I haven't found the perfect dough yet, but I'm done looking for a perfect red pizza sauce.

one of the best pizza sauces. I used half the quantity of ingredients requested & fried 1.5 garlic cloves & 1 small diced onion with the oil before adding diced tomatoes (they are called pizza tomatoes here in germany & that's what we use for making pizzas)before adding dried harbs - lotsa oregano, a bit of thyme, peperocini, basil & rosemary. Was wonderful...a definite keeper!

What a wonderfully simple sauce. I was surprised by how full-bodied and flavorful this was. I did add a dash of red pepper flakes for spiciness. I will continue to use this recipe. It's a fun one to experiment with.

I didn't use italian tomatos - i just bought the plain crushed ones. I also added 2 cloves of garlic, fried them a little in the oil, and then added the tomatos. This was so easy, and really delicious. everyone thought it was much better than the prepared kind we usually use.

Rating: 2
It's a good start. I would add a suite of spices: Equal parts of basil, thyme, oregano, oregano (twice, yes), nutmeg, rosemary and a clove of garlic. GRIND the dried leaf spices together in a mortar and pestle. About a handful of aromatic spices to your 2-1/2 cups of sauce. Without the rosemary, it's not Italian!

I loved that there's so few ingredients. I used 3 pints of homemade canned tomatoes and like everyone suggested I added basil at the end. I chop up the basil and freeze it in ice cube trays. I used 2 cubes. This is now the only pizza sauce I make now.

I join the crowd who were amazed by the excellence of this simple recipe - ok so I did throw in a couple of cloves of crushed garlic, a sprinkle of basil and some red pepper flakes but I'm convinced that it would have been great as written with the Stromboli (on this site-check it out for a great meal)or as a base for any pizza. Simple can truly be superb-good food doesn't always need six steps and 15 ingredients!

I thought this recipe was a bit too simple, but in the end I was amazed. The flavor was great, and preperation could not be more easy. I used San Marzano tomatoes, and I recommend using the highest quality canned tomatoes you can find. In addition, I added a clove of minced garlic but that was my only modification. Who knew something so simple could taste so good?

After years of searching for the perfect pizza sauce, I have finally found it here. My only changes are adding a clove of chopped garlic, a pinch of sugar, and sometimes in the summer, a little fresh basil after cooking is complete. This sauce compliments almost any pizza topping. It's simplicity is it's beauty.

My husband and I thought this pizza sauce was just right, and I finally have a standard pizza sauce recipe. We used Muir Glen ground tomatoes in puree and cooked it for about an hour. I am a pretty good cook, but sometimes the simplest solution eludes us, so I am grateful for these basic recipes. They can make all the difference in one's cooking.

Being a "tweaker" of recipes, it was hard not to add to this. Sure am glad I didn't! This is like a clean canvas for whatever pizza ingredients you want. Ya gotta have really good canned tomatoes. San Marzano, if possible. And really good olive oil. I wonder if the people that have trouble with this just can't believe something so simple can be a positive instead of a negative. Perhaps if one compares this to butter on toast it would be easier to digest.:) Pun intended. Would they add other ingredients like---dried strawberries--or chopped up peanuts to the butter and then smear on the peanut butter & jelly?

Well color me surprised, this was really good! I did let it simmer an hour which reduced it quite a bit. I had my husband taste it before I told him that it only had two ingredients, and he said it was great. Which surprised me even more since he can't stand to leave anything unseasoned!

This is the best pizza sauce I have used. It is more than just heating a can of tomatos which I have tried in the past. There is a much different flavor. This sauce has such a fresh flavor of tomato that it allows the other toppings to be enhanced as well. Adding sugar and other ingredients ruins the fresh flavor and makes it taste more like a spaghetti sauce. It is very good with fresh whole milk mozz. Do make sure that you use a can of crushed tomatos in PUREE.

I think many of the reviewers missed the point of this recipe. If you've tried to make pizza sauce for years and never gotten it right, try this recipe. You won't believe how good it is. I normally add things to recipes, but I DON'T with this one. It's perfect as is. I used to add onions, and tons of spices to pizza sauce. Now I know that is what I was doing wrong.

I thought this recipe was good, but I made a few changes. I used fresh saucing tomatoes, crushed, seeded, cooked until reduced, pulp sieved until a silky sauce remained. I then added virgin olive oil, pressed fresh garlic, shredded green onion, fresh ground pepper, fresh rolled and copped basil, finely chopped chives, some fresh oregano. Simmer this for an hour then add to taste sugar, salt, and balsamic vinegar. Like I said, add a few simple changes and this is what a recipe should look like. Otherwise drive to the store and buy a canof PREGO.

I can't believe that something so simple can be so good! I didn't have any tomatoes w/ puree, so I used canned cut-up tomatoes in the sauce. When cooking was complete, I pureed in the blender slightly then added basil and crushed red peppers. My husband says it's the best pizza he's ever had.
