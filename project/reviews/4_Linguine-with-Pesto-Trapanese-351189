What a fast, delicious recipe! I grew Juliet tomatoes this year and have been annoyed with them as they're too big to be grape tomatoes and too small to be romas but they were perfect for this! I used about 24 oz. of tomatoes. I make my own pesto and freeze in ice cube trays so I thawed 4 cubes and processed it with the tomatoes and almonds. I used whole grain linguini and a little fresh parm on the top. Wonderful!

This is so wonderful and easy! I used fresh tomatoes from my garden that I par boiled and peeled,then drained most of the liquid so as to make a lovely thick sauce. I double the recipe and freeze in batches to be used later.

I used a bunch of cocktail tomatoes I had on hand instead of romas, and I think they may have made this more watery than it should've been. It was still good, though, I'd make it again for sure. Quite easy and tasty. I pan fried some scallops to serve on top.

Excellent taste and easy to make! We had a little left over, so we spread it over some crusty French bread like a tapenade. Delicious!

I used canned Italian roma-style tomatoes and it turned out heavenly. Definitely a keeper!

Just a comment. My recipe called for 6 plum tomatoes, so how many cherry tomatoes would the recipe prefer? Thanks.

Liked this alot. Easy to prepare. I preferred it a bit hotter than room temperature though.

Just read the featured recipe. The ingredients state basil and cherry tomatos, but no where in the picture can I see one piece of basil or one cherry tomato. Maybe you should replace the picture? Will make the pasta this weekend.

... maybe because in Sicily you can eat this delicious pasta all the year long...

I have a very similar dish for several years now. Extremely easy and very tasty. One thing I particularly like is to leave the grape tomatoes whole and saute with a little olive oil just until the heated through, the skins start to wilt at this point. When stirred in with the pasta they just pop in your mouth and the burst of warm flavor is great! Bueno Appetito!

This recipe is exactly seasonal if you live in the Sunbelt where tomatoes grow this time of year, and usually are left out of the fuss about other "seasonal" items. I made the recipe with hand-picked tomatoes and some Georgia pecans, so it's not only seasonal but kind of local too. Quite tasty, but my 1/4 Sicilian spouse didn't appreciate that part of the directions - he says you don't have to be Sicilian to understand the importance of properly cooked pasta!

Why is this listed as seasonal for January?
