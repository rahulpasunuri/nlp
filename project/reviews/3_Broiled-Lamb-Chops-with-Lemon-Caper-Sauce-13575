I thought the flavors of this were just right. I used slightly less lamb, but the same amount of the sauce and found the lemons and capers a nice balance to the meat. I also used a grill pan and put it right in the oven under the broiler. Served with creamed spinach--also on this website

Hey, try this one with a simple variation. Use orange zest and orange juice instead, and double the sauce recipe. Use a bit more OJ than suggested. At the end, blend in some half and half. It's very tasty, and I think the orange flavor is great with the lamb.

I served this to someone who generally doesn't like lemon in her food and she raved about it.

The lemon sauce is tasty but WAY overpowering. It drowns out all the other flavors. Perhaps it needs another ingredient to balance it out? Or maybe it's better suited to another dish?
