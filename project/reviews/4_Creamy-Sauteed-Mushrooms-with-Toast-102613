Simple and wonderful, even without the cream!

My new favorite way to cook mushrooms! I had picked up a few pounds of beautiful spinach at the farmstand this weekend and ended up using that instead of the shiitakes in the second skillet, so I got to taste the just the mushrooms and then add in the spinach. Very similar to my favorite app at a restaurant that burned down two years ago! Can't wait to do this again..

This is a great recipe - my friends have all raved. I have served as a side dish with filet mignons, and also as a marsala sauce over sauteed chicken breasts. I use a mixture of regular and portabello mushrooms for deeper flavor and red onion instead of shallots. Chopped cilantro also works as well as parsley. YUM!!

Guests enjoyed the appetizer. Mushrooms let out a lot of water so it took a while to simmer. Something a little different, nice when the weather gets colder. Only did 1/2 the recipe, turned out good.

Made this for Thanksgiving appetizer. I had 25 guests, so doubled the recipe. I could have tripled it! My guests were hanging around the chafing dish waiting to get a hold of the spoon to scoop up mushrooms. This is an easy to make recipe. Although the recipe suggests using two large skillets, I used one very large one and had perfect results. Where I live Marsala can not be found. I looked on line for a substitute: 3/4 c. white wine + 3 t. brandy. Worked for me.

Very good. Should be served warm. Cream seperates when it cools.

I made this just as an extra tidbit for my wedding party. It was amazingly good. I didn't mnanaga to get all the mushrooms but I managed to buy all the fancy mushrooms I could find with extra baby portabellas thrown in. Finger Licking good!

My son-in-law is from Kennette Square PA, "the mushroom capital of the world", I first made this a number of years ago and EVERYONE loved it, especially John! I do love the Marsala wine...really distinctive. Just very ymmy!

These are incredible. I cut the top rind off of a wheel of Brie, topped the cheese with the mushrooms, and baked until the Brie melted. Served with crackers. Every morsel scarfed down at our holiday party.

This recipe is unbelievably good. I followed the recipe very loosely, using mostly shittakes and not bothering to measure anything or separate the mushrooms. I added a touch of cornstarch to thicken the sauce and served with simple garlic crostini. Fast, easy, and absolutely delicious!

This was delicious. I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms. I used a dry white wine I had instead of the Marsala. I couldn't stop "sampling" it out of the skillet! I also added some thyme.

I have been making this dish since '99, and have always gotten rave reviews! I use leeks, no shallots, otherwise follow the recipe. I serve it at parties, super easy, but still impressive to guests. I do use whatever mushrooms I can find, but always throw in shiitake or portobellos.

I love this recipe and have make it several times. It is delicious but somewhat expensive to make.

very good recipe...make it even better with 1/2 tsp of crushed dry thyme or 1 tsp of fresh thyme while sauteing mushrooms...

I really was not thrilled with this. I expected a thicker, tastier spread. Sorry to break the trend. My girlfiend tried this with pasta, and she said it was pretty good. Maybe it is me....lol.

This is fabulous! I used a mix of wild, portabella and white mushrooms, and port wine. Everyone loved. A keeper for sure!

WOW! I made this for a New Year's Eve party and it was absolutely wonderful! I can't wait to make it again. I was easy to make and tasted fabulous!

One word- DELICIOUS!! I have made this three times, and always a hit! I just made this last night as a starter followed by a caesar salad, then lobster thermidore (also on this website which is just as incredible) and risotto. Also offered garlic bread (paste of olive oil, butter, parsley, kosher salt, and of coarse lots of garlic) baked on baguette. Guests raved ON AND ON!!! The best meal! (apples in puff pastry for dessert with fresh whipped cream), and a great bottle of champagne with the meal! THE BEST!!!

Amazing.

I literally just made this and it's fabulous! I think I'll cut down on the shallots next time (a little overpowering) and/or try another's suggestion of a shallot & leek combo, and add some crimini mushrooms to the mix. The only puzzling thing is that it doesn't look like the picture - the mushrooms appear "dry" and without the creamy sauce in the picture. Oh well.

I made this recipe a year ago for a Christmas party I had. I served 20 appetizers and this one has been my most requested to repeat. I am making it again on Friday as requested for a party I am going to. It is very easy! I use any variety of mushrooms that looks great at the market. You won't be dissappointed!

This was great, and it was really easy. I will certainly make it again. Everyone loved it!

I have made this several times and love it! I usually substitute Port for the Marsala but both are great. I have also used milk or half and half if my guests don't want the rich cream.

I love serving this as an appetizer for a very special meal (great with champagne). Some variations that I've tried and recommend: try substituting 3/4 cup leeks and 3/4 cup shallots for the shallots. I've also tried several different fresh herbs - thyme, oregano, marjoram, and once added a head of roasted garlic to the mixture (this is how I always make this recipe now). This recipe is also great to make ahead the day before (make the mushroom mixture, then simply warm up in a sautee pan before serving with the baguette toasts).

Absolutely Fabulous!!! I used Portobello mushrooms, had to use a non-dairy creamer(can't use regular cream), and made my own homemade French Bread. Yes, will use this recipe many times more.

This recipe is absolutely incredible! I was looking for a sauteed mushroom recipe to top grilled chicken breast and ran across this. I cut the recipe in half and used only button mushrooms, as they were the only mushrooms I had available. I also slightly reduced the sauce to keep it rich and thick. I can't wait to try this again using an assortment of wild mushrooms!

This dish is full of flavor! I served it at a party and everyone raved about it. I substituted portobello mushrooms for the shiitake mushrooms and also used garlic olive oil on the baquette slices. When I make it again, I'll cut the butter down to 1 stick as it tended to separate from the mixture and rise to the top. This dish would also be good as a topping for various meats.

Served this as a first course last night....absolutely delicious. b/c mushrooms are so plentiful and good in this area, I selected an assortment of different wild mushrooms. Also substituted a 10 yr old port which only served to make this recipe even better.

My husband and I prepared this dish together for our big Christmas party. We did two batches in one large electric fry pan and then combined and set aside. Later, the mushrooms were warmed in a chafing dish and served to rave reviews. Despite an abundance of other foods, the mushrooms were enjoyed down to the last smidge of sauce. Guests were begging for the recipe...simple to prepare and well worth the cost of the shiitake mushrooms!
