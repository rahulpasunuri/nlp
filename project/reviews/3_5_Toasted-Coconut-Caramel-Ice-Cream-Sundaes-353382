All 8 of my guests raved about this dessert and asked for seconds. The roasted coconut makes the dessert. The best part is that it is so easy to make.

This is a very easy recipe and was excellent. The caramel needs a pinch of salt in my opinion, so we sprinkled the sundaes with a bit of fleur de sel. I also added some toasted slivered almonds to the coconut. Yum.
