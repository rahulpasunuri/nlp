I haven't made this particular recipe but I make paneer and peas all the time. This amount of Gee is rediculous. You only need half that amount. Regular onions are fine, no need to fool with pearls. It's also easy to make your own paneer. Just get 1 gallon of whole milk, bring to a boil. Add 4 Tbls lemon juice reduce head and stir gently till it curdles. turn off the heat and let it sit till it separates. pour through a cheese cloth, reserving a couple cups of the whey. sit a can of tomatoes on the cheese and let it drain for about an hour. Then just cut into cubes. You use the whey in the sauce instead of water for creaminess. mmmm

This recipe would have been better had it not been for the overdose of coriander. Other paneer palak recipies only call for 1 TEASPOON, rather than 2 Tablespoons!!

I substituted canola oil for the ghee, and reduced it to 1 Tablespoon, and used regular brown onion instead of the pearl, recipe turned out fine. Liked it best when served warm.

I had omitted the onions (too expensive) and used only 1-2 Tbsp. veg oil and tofu instead of paneer, and thought it was good. I would try another version next time though just to compare.

Pearl onions and tomatoes out of place in this dish. Way too much ghee. Curry Lover in Vic. B.C.

There are many better recipes for palak paneer out there - this one is too greasy. The pearl onions are definitely out of place here. Puree the tomatoes for a smoother texture and cook it along with the spinach.

My husband is Indian and he didn't much care for this recipe because of the tomatoes, which he says are never added to saag. I thought it was ok.

blech! this was terribly bland and tasteless. also, it left an oily taste in my mouth because there was so much ghee used in this recipe.
