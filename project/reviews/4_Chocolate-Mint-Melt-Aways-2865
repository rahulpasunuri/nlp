These were rich and delicious. My only suggestions would be to cut them small and wait until the last minute to add the crushed peppermint candy on top because it gets sticky with humidity (or by putting them in the fridge).

I make this every Christmas, I keep them in the fridge, and they stay fresh for a week or so. They're delicious and beautiful.

I finally tried these after saving the recipe many years ago. I didn't like them and found they were much too heavy for a cookie. The idea was great but unfortunately Mint Milanos still do it better. And cheaper.

After reading the reviews, I was a little hesitant about making these,but they were relatively low-drama and absolutely delicious. I let the butter get very warm, and let the mixer really whip up the sugar and butter. I also used a few drops of peppermint oil instead of the peppermint extract. I pushed the cookies through a cookie press (star disk),and had no problems at all with them being crumbly or dry. I think next time I may try rolling them out. I took the lazy way out and drizzled them with the chocolate. These are wonderful, and worth any extra time or energy.

I have been successful at piping these into ovals. You need a star tip with a large opening. Mine wasn't a 4, I think it was a Wilton 199. It's worth it for the finished look - people don't believe that these are homemade! The trick is to really whip up the butter. I just made these last weekend and the dough was stiff, probably because it had been sitting for a while after mixing before I could get to it. I whipped in some more butter - just shy of 1/4 cup - and the dough became workable again and able to be piped. I pipe a small oval, then fill in the center in one pass, ending with a small piped star. Looks wonderful, and any gaps get filled in when they bake.

I would like to give this 3.5 stars just because the cookies gave me some trouble since they were so dry. I'm not sure how anyone would be able to pipe them at the consistency they were for me. They kept falling apart. Regardless, I pushed through - the ganashe and coating were very easy. Messy, but easy. I used Ghiradelli white chocolate chips for the ganache and it was fabulous. Like others, I also added a little bit of mint extract to the chocolate coating.

probably the best cookie i ever made. elegant, delicious,and beautiful. i used a square-scalloped cookie cutter.

I have made these a few times now and they get rave reviews. As other cooks have noted, they are a bit more work but are very good - the cookies have a nice, light texture. I don't bother to pipe them - just roll them into balls and flatten them a bit. Works fine and a little less labor intensive.

I made these two years ago for a Christmas party, and since then there is talk of these cookies as soon as the invites go out. I now make them every year. They are time consuming, but they are SO good! Kind of like mint Milanos but better.

Everyone at our Christmas party loved these. They are a little time consuming for "everyday" cookies but were excellent for Christmas.

also, the cookies took a little longer to bake in my oven than the recipe staed. Just keep an eye on them. And does anyone know where a picture of these cookies as made with the piping in the recipe can be found? I'd like to see how tey were supposed to look. I know someone said they were "o" shaped, but I'm just curious to actually see them.

Rating: 4
It was a little time consuming for me, but I had the time and a little help, so I didn't mind. And the cookies came out great! I followed the recipe exactly, except for the piping of the dough and dipping in the chocolate. I just shaped them into ovals by hand, and used a spoon and knife to spread both the ganache and the chocolate. Also, like one of the previous reviewers, I had extra choclate left over so I drizzled it over the cookies. They came out tasting like fancy Mint Milanos and looking even prettier, almost professsional, according to my family. The chocolate was a little messy, and later tends to melt quickly if you leave it out, but otherwise, it was great! I'll probably be making these again if and when I get the chance. (My mom has already suggested I can make another half-batch with the chocolate I had left.) Also, I used Baker's white and semi-sweet chocolate for the recipe.

The best mint holiday cookies I've had. Followed recipe except since I didn't have a cookie press I rolled out dough and cut into bells. White chocolate did get a bit gloppy and started separating slightly, but I reheated and it was fine. Kept in fridge and ate cold. Really delicious!

Rating: 1
This is the first recipe off of epicurious that I didn't like. I found the cookie to be way too dry. Perhaps I would try a different sugar cookie recipe with the white chocolate/dark chocolate dipping. But then again, it seems like it still would not be worth the effort.

Rating: 4
Family favorite -- had to add to my annual Christmas list due to family demand. I am an accomplished baker so was able to pipe the dough ok -- though it was stiff. The way I did it was to pipe "stick" ovals rather than an "O" as some other reviewers have suggested. I simply got a fairly big star tip and piped a straight line about 2-1/2" long. After baking, I spread the white chocolate ganache on the bottom, and once it was set, dipped the bottom in the dark chocolate. They are quite refreshing with the mint, guests at my annual party loved them, so I had to make more for my family -- and it was the first cookie they asked about this year.

Rating: 4
Outstanding. Labour intensive but worth it. Won best overall cookie at Xmas cookie exchange. Definitely sprinkle any excess chocolate over top of cookies for effect. I also rolled cookies & pushed down with fingers. For those unclear - ganache is spread on flat side of cookie (with metal teaspoon or something similar) and then chilled with ganache side up. Then ganache side of cookie is dipped in dark chocolate & chocolate side is placed down on foil in fridge to chill.

Rating: 3
The cookies were delicious. I agree with the reviewer that said they are best served chilled. I doubled the mint in the white chocolate mixture and believe the mint in the cookie recipe should be doubled as well.

Rating: 3
Great cookie - got rave reviews from all the holiday guests. Worth all of the time it took to make it. I listened to other readers and did not pipe the dough. Shaping in balls worked fine. Not very good at room temperature. Be sure to serve chilled.

i've already made these twice this year after discovering the recipe a few weeks ago, and they were well received by all who ate them. i played around a bit with the coatings (i preferred not to use shortening but used more whipping cream instead), and both times they were wonderful. like many others, i gave up on piping them and used my hands instead, which worked well. they will definitely will be on my cookie list for years to come.

These cookies are delicious! I rolled them and cut them with oval shaped cookie cutters. Instead of dipping, I put a spoonful of chocolate on each and spread it with a knife. A big hit!

A favorite with everyone!!! I didn't pipe the cookies and just made ovals from hand. They turned out great! These cookies weren't as much trouble as I thought they would be. EVERYONE raved about them! They will become a holiday staple in our family.

Rating: 4
Deee-lish!! Per the other reviewers I made little balls and smooshed them down just a bit with my fingers (might try 3 balls into a heart shape in Feb?). I also had issues with the ganache separating but put it back over heat and it re-incorporated enough to spread. Could have been the extra extract - maybe that's why others were adding the extra to the semi-sweet? I was very confused about dipping the ganache end in - seems like a finger burner - but then realized the reason for the foil is to put them chocolate and ganache side dow - a little pat on the cookie and the chocolate spreads out smooth. I also drizzled the remaining chocolate over the exposed cookie. Very delicate and tasty - not too much work in the process.

Rating: 4
Absoultely delicious cookie, but I gave myself carpal-tunnel syndrome piping the cookie dough. The butter was soft, but even so, piping that dough out was like trying to give birth to a 16 lb baby. Also, the chocolate layer melted the ganache a bit, so I'd wait a bit more for the chocolate to cool. For those brave enough to try piping and are confused about how they should look, think of making an oval (or circle) and when the ends of the oval (or circle) meet, have the next inch of the piped cookie dough rest in the middle of the oval. It almost looks like a cursive capital "O" with the loop of the "O" coming down and resting in the middle of the "O".

HELP! I am an acomplished baker, but I don't know WHAT happened with this! The cookie itself was fine...I put it through a cookie press using the razor bar disk. However, the ganache was a major problem. The butter completely separated from the chocolate. Maybe the Plugra butter had too much butter fat. The bittersweet chocolate got thick and clumpy. Don't know WHAT went wrong! Any suggestions?

Help...I'd like to try these, but I'm a little confused about how to pipe them out of the pastry bag? It says 2 1/2 long ovals with solid center?? Can someone who has made these before elaborate (or describe in a different/better way?) Thanks!

I am not a big cookie person, but in the spirit of the season decided to make these cookies. I was initially confused by the recipe, but once I got done, I was in heaven!! I just loved them and so did everyone who tried them. Everyone thought they were store bought. I hope this will help anyone who was similarly confused after reading the recipe - basically it turns out at a layer of cookie, a layer of ganache and then a layer of chocolate. I tried making it into a sandwich type cookie, but it is hard to get the cookies the exact same shape and size. I also tried dipping the entire thing in chocolate instead of just the bottom - it's too messy to eat. So persevere and you will love them!

I have made these before and will make them again this year, because they are so good. Yes, they can be a sandwich cookie, but after all the effort I would just leave them as one piece so that the recipe yields more.

These are fabulous! I echo all the praise. I'll be making them again next year. Like many others, I didn't bother with piping it -- just rolled them into little balls and flattened.

These were wonderful! I used a cookie press and made small, round, thin cookies. I also used Plugra butter (made them flaky & tender) and added 1/2 tsp peppermint extract to the chocolate coating-- still subtley minty. The ganache took about an hour to firm. I used a microwave to melt the chocolate. My family & boyfriend said that this was the best dessert I'd ever made, and I was offered money to make them for my dad's office. So definitely try these--they are classy, elegant, sophisticated, and tasty.

De-lish. Not your average cookie!

Rating: 4
WOW!! These were spectacular! I've already made a second batch, the first disappeared so fast. I drizzled a bit of extra dark chocolate over the tops of the cookies when I was done, in random patterns, to make them look even more delicious. Also, I don't have a #4 star so I couldn't even attempt "real" piping, but I did load the dough into a disposable icing bag, cut off the tip (leaving a BIG hole) and used that. I made sure to push and release the bag several times, making about five "bumps" in each cookie. They were really cute! I'll have these on my Christmas baking list FOREVER!!!

I wanted to make these as part of my Christmas gift to friends and family but wanted to give them a try first. My trial batch was absolutely wonderful. I did add a little peppermint extract to the dark chocolate coating and it was great. I also did not pipe my cookies, I shaped them with my hands, but I am going to use a cookie press that makes rectangular shapes for Christmas. I also sprinkled some crushed peppermints on the dark chocolate. Definitely a keeper!

I really enjoyed making this recipe. It was easy to make and I added a little peppermint to give it an extra minty taste.

I made this cookie as a part of my holiday gift box that I give every year to my friends and colleagues (I am a trained cook and food stylist). Wow- they are delicious. I had trouble piping with the star tip as well, so I used a 1/2" straight tip and made sure that the butter was even slighly warmer than room temperature, nearly to the point of melting. The batter was slightly softer and it allowed me to pipe them out. I was thinking that this year, I may only dip them in the dark chocolate coating (with peppermint added), because the ganache is fairly soft and I was concerned that they would get mushy sitting in a gift box in a heated room. Has anyone tried it without the ganache?

I have to make this one again...they'll be demanded every Xmas! Didn't even bother with the piping... just rolled the dough into little balls & they baked into nice circles.

These are very good but very time consuming to make. I had no trouble piping them out but used a much larger tip than a #4 star. Be sure not to let the ganache cool too long in the refrigerator before you spread it on the cookie. I can get stiff and more difficult to spread.

Rating: 4
These cookies are wonderful, but really time consuming. I didn't pipe them either -- I chilled the dough, rolled it and cut out into small stars. These are rich cookies, so smaller is better, plus one batch will go further for the effort. The dipping was too time consuming for christmas cookies, so I spread the chocolate only over the bottoms, then criss-crossed the cookies with small ribbons of chocolate on the tops. These are a '10' for presentation. The peppermint ganache makes them irrestible. They are delicious -- but be forwarned: these require time/patience.

I made a double batch for a Christmas cookie exchange - yes, I'm a braveheart. Labor intensive but very tasty - definitely Mint Milano's. I was a little confused with what shape and size to make them - didn't pipe - so I tried a variable. Finally settled on small tubular shape flattened. I'll make them again - but next time I'll make a single batch and make the cookies smaller.

I did end up using the pastry bag but used a 1/2 inch diameter tip instead. I also put a bit of red food coloring in the dough to make it a bit more festive looking. They came out beautiful and taste even better!

Don't make these cookies unless you're prepared to have your friends and family demand them every Xmas for the rest of your life. They're THAT GOOD.

I've made these cookies for two Christmases and a puppy shower and they always get rave reviews. Instead of piping them I just roll them out and use an occasion specific cookie cutter.

Great cookie! I didn't try to pipe the dough out, after reading the reviewers. Instead, I rolled out little logs, placed them on the cookie sheet and pressed them down. This worked great.

Rating: 3
When it came to piping the dough, it helped to warm it with my hand(while in the bag of course) that made it easier. I squeezed out little kisses shapes, iced flat side with ganache, spread some bittersweet choc. and sandwiched a second cookie to it. I also made some as described in the recipe and the sandwich ones were cuter, easier to pop in your mouth and disappeared the fastest. I also noticed a big big difference between "good" white choc. v.s. the bag of white choc.chips. spend the $$$$, the taste is worth it. I'll make this over and over.

Despite having read all the advice to the contrary, I also attempted unsucussfully to pipe the cookies. Ended up rolling it into a log and slicing them (like those Pillsbury slice and bake cookies - but better). This worked fine. The chocolate layering is so attractive I don't think the shape matters too much. Very elegant for a cookie. This is a keeper - I'll definitely make it again but only for special occasions.

This is definitely one of my most requested holiday cookies - I've made it every year since it was published. My solution for the piping is to let the dough warm in the kitchen and then use plastic icing bags and large tips - you still get a workout but the results are more even. Worth the hassle however!!!

Fantastic cookie! They've become a favorite of friends and family. I receive special requests for them during the holidays. This lovlies even won an office cooking competition judged by instructors from an area culinary arts school when I subitted them. I do add a little extra peppermint to punch up the flavor.

These cookies are delicious! I added a bit more peppermint extract to make the mint more of a contrast to the chocolate. I agree with the other reviewers that it is difficult to pipe the cookies.

These cookies are expensive and time consuming but well worth it for a special event!

I used a cookie press, with the lady finger pastry tip, and it seemed to work out fine (although I had to push the cookies into shaped afterwards.) The end product is a really, tasty cookie. Definite keeper.

The way this recipe is presented it is extremely difficult to get the desired result. At the end mine looked decent but tasted delish! It is near impossible to squeeze the dough through any tip let alone a #4! DON'T TRY IT! I just shaped the dough into 1-inch balls and then flatened them into biscotti shaped ovals. I baked them for only about 8 minutes. The rest of the recipe is pretty self explanatory and worked out fine- they ended up looking like Peppridge Farm Milano cookies but tasted a lot better! Lastly, if you're like me you'd rather buy some new jeans or something than some swiss chocolate; therefore I used Nestle white chocolate chips and then some Ghiradelli semisweet chocolate chips and it ended up tasting fine. Good luck and DON'T TRY TO PIPE THE COOKIES!

These cookies are fabulous!!! I would suggest using a cookie press for these. It is much easier than the suggested instructions, and the result is prettier. I used the star/swirl die. Also, adding a tsp. of peppermint extract to the chocolate glaze enhances the mintiness. After dipping the cookie, I dizzled the remaining glaze over the top. Yummy!

These cookies turned out great. I used them for a cookied exchange and got lots of compliments. I cut the bottom off of a disposable pastry bag and just piped it out of there. Then I flattened it out a bit with my fingers. Very buttery,not too minty. Nice during the winter.

Am I the only one who thought the finished dough was crumbly? I felt that I committed a sin by wasting all that good chocolate on a mediocre cookie! Did I do something wrong, because it seems like everyone else thought these were good?

This is, by far, my favourite cookie. It does take a little extra time to prepare, but it's well worth it. I find it's much easier just to form the dough into balls and press them flat with my fingers. After dipping the bottoms in chocolate, I drizzle any extra chocolate over the top. If ever I give these away as a gift, they're always assumed to be from the bakery. Enjoy!

I was very surprised to come across this recipe while scanning this site. I purchased BonAppetit Classic Desserts Magazine on Dec.28, 1991. I had written date on cover of magazine. There were so many luscious recipes in that issue, that I decided to dismantle magazine and place each page in a sheet protecter. I then compiled a recipe book from this issue. I have been making this cookie for the past 8 years at xmas time. It's one of my best cookies!! The only revision I made with the recipe was to decrease oven temp to 300, I only bake them for 7-8 min. The dough is extremely difficult to push through a cookie spritzer or cake decorater because it becomes stiff. My simple solution to this was to dismantle cake decorator and simply push enough dough at a time through the tip with my thumb for 1 cookie. This alleviates all the pressure needed to push all the dough through cake decorater. This is an excellent cookie!!!!!!

This recipe although time consuming was worth the effort! The best cookie I have ever made.

The taste of the end product (although good) did not justify the effort that went into making this cookie. I actually ended up making these cookies as straight, 2" lines instead of ovals as it was quite hard to push out a continuous stream of the dough through the tip. This shape looked quite attractive as well.
