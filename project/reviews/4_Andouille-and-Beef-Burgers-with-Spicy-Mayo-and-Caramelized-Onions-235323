What a fantastic burger! This recipe really elevates the traditional grilled cheeseburger. The only thing that I can see wrong with it is that we didn't have anyone over to share it with us! We can't wait to have a summer BBQ to make these for our friends and family! We used goat cheese instead of blue cheese and it was fantastic.

I love Hamburgers! I used Chorizo since I could not find Andouille. I loved the little spiced up burger meat. I was not sure about putting pecans in my burgers and I will do it again. My fiance said this is what made the burger for him. For me it was the spicy mayo. Simply amazing! I added extra heat and lemon juice to taste and I hate to say that I was dipping my cucumbers into it. Not healthy but YUM! I didn't do the caramelized onions and I don't know if I will. On burgers, they just are not my thing. Instead I used, lettuce, tomato, onion, and cheddar cheese. Wow! I want to make these burgers again today.

All the family love this just as is. One daughter thought grilled pineapple would be a good addition, I'd agree if you like that kind of thing.

Heavy, dry and not very intereting. I added extra hot sauce to the mayo and that was good, as were the onions. The burger, I will not make again.

Made these for a poolside BBQ the other day. Everyone really liked them and one person posted a facebook post that she had the best burger she'd ever had that day! Tasty and easy. Love that you can do them ahead then just grill them up when you're ready.

So I have been making turkey burgers for a while now, and they get slightly boring. So tonight I used ground turkey and raw CHICKEN andouille suasage to make something like this burgers and they are so good! Saved me from turkey burger boredom. Used walnuts instead of pecans because those were the one kind of nut I didn't have. Still amazing.

Rating: 4
Fantastic. Not too spicy at all and I even doubled the spices/hot sauce in the mayo. No time to do the carm. onions but still awesome! Ground Moose works excellent with the Andouille sausage too...for all those northern folks who have access to good moose meat. Also, never have enjoyed blue cheese so left it out here and just used regular marble with all regular toppings...tomato, pickles, onions, lettuce. Husband loved it!

Made this tonight with some slight variations. it was delicious. instead of okra I used arugula...!

Rating: 3
Very good burger recipe. I was skeptical about the seasoning but chose to trust the sausage to provide a distinct flavor and it did. The blue cheese does add a nice "funk" to the sweetness of the onions, so that was definitely a win. I wanted to make 6 large burgers and only had enough meat for 5.

Rating: 4
Ok, I cheated. I followed the suggestion of one of the reviewers (thank you) and used chorizo. I didnt have hot sauce so i used a little Cayenne powder. I also used lettuce and tomato instead of Okra since my daughters are very picky eaters. They liked it! a tad bit to spicy for them because i used about 1/8 more chorizo and less hamburger, next time i will use more beef and less chorizo, but all in all, i loved this. Will certainly use it again.

this recipe is delicious!!! I made the mistake of making the patties too thick, so they ended up being a bit dry, but the spicy mayo helped quite a bit with the dryness. everyone loved the burgers, will make again!!

It's a "heavy" burger. The spicy mayonnaise and caramelized onions are a great addition, but next time I would add traditional lettuce and tomatoes instead of the okra and watercress.

Rating: 4
Impossibly good! I'm not sure what the pecans do, but will leave them in to keep everything perfectly the same. If you don't like blue cheese, give sharp cheddar a shot - both are euqally perfect pairs. The onions are compliment the tang and spice of the mayo and andouille. I cannot wait to make these for company in the future! My finicky husband is in a euphoric food coma! Enjoy!

Really good. I made the burgers with 80/20 & ground pork...no okra or watercress. I agree with previous comments that the mayo. wasn't spicy, and I will mince the andouille next time. Still, really good flavor.

O.M.G...seriously!

I stuck to the spirit of this recipe, if not the letter. I made the burgers with ground beef and uncooked chorizo sausage, which made the patties moist and flavourful. I kicked it up with a sprinkle of Tony's on each side. I made the mayo with a mango chutney, creating a milder sweeter flavour. I did the caramelized onions as the recipe stated, and I found it was an important part of the flavour mix, adding moistness and a little sweetness. I topped these burgers off with an arugula/spinach blend, and all in all, I'm certain I'll make these again. A really gourmet burger.

Simply wonderful. Never had pickled okra before and gave it a shot. Glad I did! This one's a keeper, to be made again and again. Served with sweet potato fries. Yummy!

Rating: 4
This was soooooo good! I did make a few tweaks here and there... For the mayo, I added more cajun seasoning and instead of regular hot pepper sauce, used a vidalia onion and peaches hot sauce. For the burgers, I added a bit of cajun seasoning to the meat. It looks like a lot of work, but really it isn't... Wonderful burgers... A definite repeat!

Rating: 2
We made these last night...I have to say I hesitated based on some of the reviews...and now I agree. I used 80/20 beef and added 1/4 cup of beef stock and the burgers were still really dry. The flavor was nice, although the mayo really didn't add anything to the burgers and I added extra hot sauce and it was still not spicy. I'm not sure we would make these again. Interesting concept though.

Very messy but awesome-made without the okra and watercress but a definite hit-nice flavors although not sure you need the pecans as I couldn't taste them with all the toppings

This has become my husband's signature burger and everyone that has ever tried it, has loved it. In fact, I actually crave it at times. The toasted walnuts, give it that extra texture that sends this over the top. We keep trying other burger recipe, but this is bar none our favorite.

The holy trinity ... Ha, the spicy mayo, caramelized onions and the cheese. Now for the burger, ... used hot sausage, I can tell you folks that was the tastiest burger ever. My Family asked me, "Dad, when can you makes those burgers"? We really enjoy the mouthwatering magical blend of flavors in this recipe.

This burger was amazing! We replaced the andouilee with hot sausage mixed directly in with the grass-fed ground beef and omitted the pecans - this worked out perfectly for us.

Rating: 4
Wonderful! I used 3 lbs beef and 12 oz of sausage. I was concerned that my grass-fed beef was too lean to stick to the sausage and pecans, so I add some bacon fat we keep in the freezer (this really added to the flavor!). Made 8 burgers for 4 adults and I'm the only one who didn't eat 2 (well, I ate the 2nd the next day:) ). I found "rick's picks smokra" (pickled okra with smoked paprika) at whole foods - was pricey, but ended up being really good. I think all the flavors were great together - I wouldn't skip out on anything.

Rating: 4
What a fabulous burger! The nuts add a wonderful texture. I minced the sausage a bit smaller than recommended so you could only taste the nice combination of meat flavors. The mayo, the onions, blue cheese...don't leave out a thing. I found some pickled okra and it was a great thing to try, but had the same flavor as a regular dill pickle.

Rating: 4
This is a great burger recipe. If you use 20% fat ground beef and the sausage, there is no way it should come out dry (unless, of course, you overcook it).

Rating: 3
I didn't do the blue cheese since nobody in my family likes it except me and didn't do the okra because I couldn't find it. That being said, I didn't think the nuts really added much. I also thought it would be better with choritzo rather than andouille and I will try it again that way. The mayo and onions were awesome.

This burger was awesome. I made a miniature version to fit on "slider" buns, and found it to be plenty moist, and the pecans added a great crunch.

This burger is a must-try recipe. I used this as inspiration for a burger I made in a burger cook-off. The competition was stiff (duck sausage burgers, greek lamb burgers) but this burger came out on top and I am now the undisputed burger master. The combination of flavors--salty andouille, spicy mayo, sweet onions is to die for. I didn't use any greens on my burger and it was awesome. I recommend Tony Chachere's for the mayo! Make this burger!!

Rating: 1
Just okay, nothing special. We had never tried pickled okra before and that was an interesting addition to the burger. The cheese did not melt and I don't like that much blue cheese. I think having the andouille cut into cubes and I bought 10% fat ground beef made the burgers dry and easily overdone. The watercress didn't add anthing to the result. Not a repeater in this household.

Rating: 2
Not impressed. The mayonnaise and caramelized onions would be good on any burger, but I found the combination of andouille and ground beef lackluster. There are better burgers out there, and I've found burger creativity should be invested more in the condiments than in the patty itself.

Rating: 4
Oh and YES! These are amazing burgers. The pecans must be toasted (325 for 10 minutes) and the andouille cut tiny. The Okra is losable - the watercress is not! This is a MUST DO AGAIN dish (but don't check your cholesterol for one week). . . . :-)

Hands down my favorite burger recipe. I never tried it with okra though and instead used Arugula. In my opinion, its better if you use pre-cooked sausages. I've tried it both ways the texture and taste seem better with the pre-cooked andouille.

Rating: 3
No andouille so I, unhappily, substituted with linguica. I did not have okra or watercress so I went without. After eating my husband and I talked about which topping (onions, mayo or bleu) would be indispensable -- it was impossible to exclude any one of them. It's too calorie-laden to make regularly, but I'll definitely have again.

My in-laws made this the summer the recipe came out. We tried it tonight, using good ciabatta rolls for buns, not using okra and substituting arugula since we couldn't find watercress. They were as good as we remembered and we had no trouble with them being dry! Only wish we had more spicy mayo to go with the sweet potato "fries" we threw on the grill.

I have been trying Epicurious recipes for years with great success. I like to try recipes that have proven successful by ratings and reviews. This recipe I had been anxious to try for some time. I made these burgers last night with our daughter home for spring break. I have to say they were quite disappointing. I followed the recipe as written. Both my daughter and my husband felt as I did. We found them dry and not very flavourful, even with the andouille sausage....which I felt added more fat than any of us need. I will continue to use Epicurious and will be grateful to those who leave reviews, positive or not.

YUMMMO! Made exactly as stated and the love everything abou it. I chopped up the andouille to make it more like the ground beef and that helped with keeping it together. The onions are deliciouslyl sweet and carmelized, the burgers have a great kick ... just absolutely fabulous! We all ate 2 ... and we never eat 2 burgers! Came out to 6 perfect servings.

Absolutely FANTASTIC! I'm not an onion fan, but even without them it's delicious. I would make the burgers a little smaller, just 'cause they wind up being almost unmanageable (could probably split a burger with someone and wind up full). A keeper for sure!

I found this to be a wonderful burger, though it was, indeed, a little salty the first time I tried it. On the second attempt, I used a different brand andouille and a different bleu, and it turned out just right. It might be useful to test andouilles and/or cheeses prior to choosing one for this recipe.

Best burger ever! I made these a few times last summer after reading the recipe in Bon Appetit & I'm so excited that bbq weather has come back to chicago so I can make them again. I follow the recipe exactly because I love the way the flavors come together. Nothing better than blue cheese & carmelized onions!

This recipe is great! I have made it several times and all folks introduced to it want the recipe. I pair this with the Asian corn recipe that was in the same edition. When in a hurry, I don't bother with the spicy mayo and just use mayo. Can't tell the difference.

I've now made this for a second time. Out of laziness more than anything, I skipped the mayo and caramelized onions this time and focused on the burger. My husband loves it with the blue cheese, but the burger itself is so rich that I don't think it's needed. It's an unusual and delicious burger.

This meal was ordinary. The andouille added some flavor, but I usually make burgers from ground lamb which I think has a far superior taste. The spicey mayo was bland...I added extra hot sauce and cajun spices and ended up throwing out the leftovers. Onions are great, but I have been making these with burgers for years. You don't need the sugar...the onions have enough sugar to carmelize themselves without it. Blue cheese (which I love)was not a good variation from Muenster or Swiss. Watercress was a nice change from lettuce. Didn't use okra. Very disappointing after the rave reviews.

Rating: 3
In reference to the comment below, I find that a great many of the recipes on Epicurious are way too salty -- and I do LOVE salt. When I use recipes like this and other meat dishes from Epicurious, I cut way back on the salt. More can always be added to taste later.

Rating: 1
We made these burgers last night, following the directions except for reducing the amount of salt called for. Wow! These burgers were still way too salty. The blue cheese (and we love blue cheese) was very salty to begin with. Add to that the salt in the andouille and pow! Neither of us could eat more than half of our burgers before we began to feel ill from the salt. If you want to try these, look for a less salty blue and omit the salt altogether.

Rating: 4
We made this tonight, and not to repeat about 20 people before me, but this was truly an amazing burger! Like many of the others, we also omitted the okra - maybe we are missing something, but it is hard to believe it could taste better. Don't skip the pecans though, they really add to the complex flavor of the sweet, spicy and hot combination. The other twist that we had was using gorgonzola cheese instead of the blue cheese. This was not a concious substition, it was more of a function of not knowing what was in the fridge . . . but the end result had to still be similar. Using a more typical cheese like swiss would probably still taste good, but the more potent flavors of gorgonzola or blue are better in combination with the spicy sausage and mayo.

Rating: 4
It was defintely the best burger I had. I made this dish without reading the reviews and was interested to see that my opinions matched everyone else's. Who would have thought that these common ingredients would make a great burger. Like most of the others, no okra or watercress, but it was great without.

This was, by far, the best burger of my life!! The andouille and pecans add so much flavor to the burger. I went out and bought fresh hamburger rolls, the burgers are to good for storebought. The onions and spicy mayo were amazing. The only thing i changed, was to use tomato and lettuce instead of the pickled okra and watercress. I highly recommend this dish and will make it, myself, over and over again in the future!

To the person who wanted suggestions for what to serve with this -- the burgers are VERY filling. I served a baby romaine salad with a light vinaigrette, plus oven-roasted Yukon gold potatoes tossed with olive oil and some of the Cajun spice. Frankly, I was too full to eat many of the sides, although my husband gobbled everything up. So I would stay away from anything too heavy as a side.

I'm still wiping my mouth after dinner but couldn't wait to write a review. This recipe was fantastic! Definately a four forker. So many different flavors and they all mix together perfectly.

Delish and very rich! Next time, I'm going to make the mayo a little more spicy, but otherwise, the combination of sauce, burger and onions is perfect. I did skip the okra. I'm still traumatized by a childhood spent eating badly-cooked okra, and I don't think the burger needs it anyway.

Thought this was three-forks good, but not four-forks good. Although my husband and I certainly thought the burgers combined with the mayo dressing and onions were delicious, I"m not sure I'd make them again, just because they were a lot of work. Certainly worth trying, though (especially if you have a number of people to make them for and don't have finicky children).

AMAZING! Couldn't find andouille sausage, so found a recipe to make andouille sausage and it was nothing more than taking my butcher's ground sausage and adding some cajon spice (among other herbs) to the sausage.

The runaway hit of the summer. MAKE THESE EXACTLY AS SHOWN IN THE RECEIPE. I almost ommited the pecans, but really made the burgers. Go out of your way to find the okra and watercress, it is so worth it. I cannot say enough about this recipe. There is alot going on, but it really comes together. Pair them up with a mint julep, and the South may stand a decent chance of rising again!

These were good, but boy are they rich! Still, I left off the okra and used lettuce instead of the watercress. Next time, I won't use as much andouille, but love the flavors together. I had to leave out the nuts due to allergies, but one of these days, I'll try it with them.

My new favorite burgers. It did sound a little strange at first, but every taste in this recipe blends beautifully.

Definitely give these a try!

Best Homemade Burger Ever!! I sometimes have a hard time imaging how things will taste, especially with this recipe. You're tossing all of the raw ingredients and thinking to your self, "what have I done???" sure, it's ground beef, but all the other ingredients are not normally found in a burger. Don't be shy. Except be very afraid of pickled okra, or any okra for that matter. Okra are alien seed pods that hatch in your body and then .. I digress. Make this burger and you will LOVE IT! I used bib lettuce instead of the watercress. Watercress is risky in that there's usually funky stuff lurking inside that you don't see until you get it home. I have issues, but not about this burger. Do it, enjoy!
