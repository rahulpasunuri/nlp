Very easy and delicious. I only used 2 cans of beans and added escarole at the end. I will mention that you don't need to season much as the spicy turkey sausage and the chicken broth add plenty of flavor.

SPICY! Partially depends on what sausage one uses. Definitely needs the avocado to cool it off.

Great flavor. Used spicy Italian turkey sausage and definitely recommend it if you want a bit more spice. Freezes well too.

Very good. I went with two cans of chickpeas and beef broth. I'll add a bit more jalapeño next time since it was a little mild for our taste. Served it with cornbread and veggie crudités.

Terrific recipe! I added a bunch of chopped chard at the very end to get some additional vegetables into the soup, it worked out perfectly.

Used homemade beef stock and Mexican chorizo instead of turkey sausage. Also toasted and ground a variety of seeded, dried chilis and added 1.5 t. to the 1 t. cumin to the tomato mixture. Delicious!

Nifty little soup. Always looking for soups that are heavy on the protein and light on the carbs and this fits the bill AND tastes great. AND is easy. I added a diced carrot and used two cans of garbanzos instead of three. Would have been wildly bean-y, I think, if I'd used all three. I think one of the great things about a recipe like this is that it can take a lot of monkeying so see what you have in the fridge and have a ball!

Loved this....added one chopped onion, 1/2 red pepper with 1 lb of spicy chicken italian sausage. In place of garbanzo beans, 1 can black beans, 1 can Azuki beans drained, and 1 can spicy chili beans. Really enjoyed the mix of beans. Added a really nice texture. I made cornbread to compliment the soup.

Amazing recipe. Added carrots, kale and fresh corn kernels. Subbed chipotle for jalapeno. Did not add broth. Yum!!

Rating: 4
I don't like the texture of canned garbanzos, so I first made the beans from scratch. (Soak overnight, simmer for about an hour the next day.) Wow-what a great texture to add to the soup. Not too soft, not to hard with flavor that complements the spiciness of the broth. Didn't have a jalapeno, so I tossed in a can of regular green peppers and added some chipolte powder for kick, one mild and one spicy chicken sausage since turkey wasn't available. Very nice soup and I think it would be just as appropriate in the summer as in the winter.

Rating: 4
A hearty soup with a nice depth of flavor that's easy to make - gets my vote! Here are the adjustments I made based on suggestions from other reviewers and what I had on hand: I added three chopped carrots, two stalks of celery and 1/2 of a large onion which I sauteed first in 1 T of olive oil. I used leftover breakfast sausage, 2 chicken and 4 pork links. I subbed a chipotle pepper for the jalapeno and used a full 14 oz can of diced tomatoes. I subbed 1 can of kidney beans for 1 can of garbanzo beans. I drained the beans and used about 2 1/2 cups of homemade chicken stock, and because the stock had a good deep flavor I didn't need to add salt or pepper at the end. Other reviewers are spot on that the lemon is key (although I think lime would work well). I think corn would be a good addition, but because I was using breakfast sausage with hints of maple I thought I had enough sweet for this dish.

Outstanding! Hearty and scrumptious. A favorite in my home.

Rating: 4
Absolutely wonderful, especially knowing how easy and relatively healthy it is. I sauted celery, carrots & onions after the sausage, which added a little more in the way of veggies and added richness to the final dish. Definitely give this one a try - this will be a cold-weather regular for us.

This was great.. I used a chicken, feta and spinach sausage and then tossed in some spinach and arugula I wanted to get rid of at the end. oh and threw in some feta with the avocado and cilantro. Used all the other ingredients. Pretty yum.

This was simply delicious. I had duck sausage from my local Greenmarket, which I used instead of turkey. I also went with the garbanzo/cannellini/pink bean triad. I left out the avocado completely. Also, because I prefer my hearty soups thick and pureed, but didn't want to puree it afterwards because of the sausage, I used my immersion blender to liquefy the tomato mixture and then the beans and broth before adding them to the soup. This got reverent raves from my dinner guests!

Great soup... I started by sauteing onions, celery and carrots to add some veggies to it. I didn't have sausages so I used left over turkey from thanksgiving that I had frozen and turkey stock that I had made and frozen in ice cubes. The jalapeno's give it a great kick. Really nice warming soup!

This soup was so easy to make and incredibly delicious. The only thing I changed was that I drained the beans (who needs all that sodium?!) and added some more water to the broth. Wonderful!

Rating: 4
Delicious & satisfying... changed recipe as follows: (1)Used mild Italian sausage. (2)Doubled the amount of tomatoes to 2 cups as suggested by earlier reviewers, good call. (3)Used canned jalapeno peppers -- worked fine. (4)Used the following beans: 1 seasoned pinquitos (pureed these in food processor before adding to soup & that made the soup creamier), 1 black beans, 1 white beans. Great combo. Used NO garbanzo beans. (5)Drained the cans of white and black beans before adding to soup. I did review this earlier without the changes I just added so please ignore my earlier review.

Easy and delicious, but I did tweak the recipe a little: (1)Used sweet Italian sausage instead. (2)Used 1 can each of seasoned pinquito beans, white beans, and black beans. (3)Pureed the pinquito beans using food processor before adding. Made the soup creamier. (4)Used canned jalapeno peppers, still fine. (5)Doubled the amount of tomatoes from 1 to 2 cups -- good idea from another reviewer. All of these added up to "make it again" status. Yum!

This was delicious. The only adjustment I made was not using all the liquid from the beans. Too much sodium. Also didn't salt it at the end. Read more http://deepdomesticthoughts.blogspot.com/2010/03/spicy-garbanzo-bean-and-turkey-sausage.html

So delicious! We used mild Italian pork sausage and added 2 cups of chopped kale for the last 4 minutes. The whole jalapeno added a good kick, and the lemon juice made it taste really fresh. I put a dollop of light sour cream on top for some creaminess. The depth of flavor was amazing, definitely the best soup I've made all winter.

Excellent soup recipe. My daughter and I loved it. I made this over the weekend and it was great. Since it calls for using the liquids of the beans and tomatoes, I purchased organic. Also, I went to New Seasons Market for turkey sausage, which they do not carry. I spoke with the butcher and he suggested these fabulous smoked turkey legs, which were not in the case but back in their cooler. I bought two. I trimmed the meat from the bones and cut it into small bite pieces. I threw the meat and the garlic into the Dutch oven at the same time and started the soup process like the recipe said, I just didn't have to brown the meat. It turned out fabulous. This is a great recipe if you love garbanzo beans, which I do :) Not hot at all from the jalapeño. If you want hotter, add more of the pepper.

totally worth making - the broth was delicious, the turkey sausage was better than I expected - my entire family & I all decided the beans just weren't the right texture. maybe we're not garbanzo fans. a soft white bean would have been really nice. Will make again with that substitution.

My husband loves this soup! I made it last night with only slight modifications (increased to 1 lb of hot Italian sausage, doubled the tomatoes), thinking it would last us a few days. He ate four bowls! So much for having leftovers.

Rating: 4
Yum, yum, yum! Like some other reviewers, I added extra tomato (2 cups instead of 1) and used 1 tbsp rather than 1 tsp olive oil. I also made the following modifications: 2 cans navy beans + 1 can adzuki beans instead of the chickpeas (my husband thinks he hates chickpeas); 1 lb sausage instead of 3/4 lbs.; serrano chiles instead of jalapenos. The sausages I used were unsmoked/uncooked and slid easily out of their casings once the ends were snipped off. The finished soup was aromatic, stewy, and absolutely delicious served with a dollop of sour cream on top along with fresh chopped cilantro. I served it with cooked quinoa and sliced avocado on the side, and we enjoyed dropping spoonfuls of quinoa directly into the soup. My husband, who is typically very critical, declared the meal to be amazing, and something he never imagined a mere mortal could prepare.

Rating: 4
This was delicious. My husband made it last night and followed the recipe more or less. The biggest change was he used dried garbanzos (rehydrated) vs. canned. The next time, I think we'll blend some of the beans up with the broth to thicken it. Will definitely add to our winter rotation.

Rating: 4
I thought this was excellent for a cold day when you need some comfort food. I blended the garbanzo beans to make the soup thicker (and to hide the beans ;) ) Didn't have any chilis on hand so added some drops of sriracha hot chili sauce and tabasco. Used "better than bouillon" chicken base for more flavor.

This soup is exceptional. Only changes I made to recipe were diced canned chilis and lime instead of lemon juice, because I had both in. Result was delicious! As suggested we added diced avocado as a garnish and tortilla chips. This was perfect for a midweek main course soup. Leftovers were even better the next day.

I doubled this recipe. I loved it. I followed other reviews: I used the Trader Joe's cilantro chicken sausage, added canned corn, I added more jalapeno chili - a whole pepper - maybe 3 tablespoons? I used the Muir Glen fire roasted tomato sauce, and drained my beans, and added more than 2 cups of chicken broth - I just eyeballed it. I served it with cilantro, avacado, and sour cream. Everyone loved it!

Rating: 4
This soup is quite exceptional, and like other chefs, I tweaked it a bit. I added some onion, frozen spinach, and swapped out a can of chick peas for 1 of black beans. But my favorite addition here is adding some adobo sauce to sour cream and putting a dollop on top. A can of chipotle chilis in adobo sauce is easily the best thing in my pantry, and a spoonful of the sauce goes a long way here--adds a nice smoky depth (and a lot of heat). Enjoy!!

Rating: 4
for those not in the mood to be quite so health conscious, i used 1 lb of real italian sweet sausage and a whole 14.5 oz can of diced tomato with mild chiles. it was...AMAZING. even better the second day! i diced two decent sized jalepenos, and to cut the heat a touch I added 2 tbs of the tomato tomato jam i made earlier in the week to top some turkey burgers. this is a keeper.

Delicious! I made this for a poker party and everyone seemed to like it. Thank you to all of the previous reviewers for great suggestions! I used Amy's chicken chorizo sausage and Muir Glen fire-roasted tomatoes with adobo seasoning. Served with grated cotija cheese, sour cream, cilantro, avocado, lemon wedges, and crushed tortilla chips.

This is my second review written. I have made this soup so many times that I have lost track. I use Muir Glen organic "fire roasted" diced tomatoes with green chilies. The chilies add just enough spice. I omit the jalapeno. I also like to add a can of hominy replacing a can of garbanzo. Everyone LOVES this soup!!!

This soup is like the best of all possible worlds: made from ingredients that are usually in the pantry, quick, simple, adaptable and yummy. I basically followed the recipe, but added more lemon juice and some chipotle chile powder. Next time, I'll toss in some greens, too. Perfect for a chilly autumn day. I'll make this the next time I feel a cold coming on.

I love this soup! Did as suggested, adding a can of corn (not frozen), didn't use the bean juice but used all the tomato juice (I used my own canned tomatoes), added a dollop of sour cream and crunched up tortilla shells at the end. Very very good. Also used canned jalapenos rather than fresh and used cans of mixed beans.

I made this without the sausage (didn't have any on hand), and put in 2 extra cans of chickpeas instead. When it was finished, I pureed 2/3 of it in the blender, then mixed it back in. It was wonderful - smooth and creamy, very healthy, and very flavorful. I'll definitely make it again.

It's yummy, fast, easy, nourishing...I always have the ingredients on hand (I buy sausage & freeze it, and the rest is basically canned goods)...and my 4 year old and 2 year old will eat it as long as I leave the jalapeno out. What's not to love? To cut down on the sodium, I usually drain the beans in the can and then fill it back up with water.

Man! Is this good soup or what? I agree with draining the beans. I had chicken stock to use up & think it's better all round than liquid from the beans. Used candied jalapenos, garlic powder, toasted cumin seeds ground, leftover smoked turkey, a can of Mexican corn & a whole can of stewed tomatoes. Excellent!

Holy delicious, Batman! At the suggestion of another reviewer or two, I used the Trader Joe's chicken cilantro sausage and subbed one can cannellini beans for a can of the chickpeas. I would also recommend a tbsp olive oil to brown the sausage, rather than a tsp. I think it would have burned otherwise. Darn unfatty chickens! At the simmer for 15 minutes part, I threw in a can of drained sweet corn (TJ's as well). Made for great color and a nice sweet texture. I didn't include the liquid from the beans, as other cooks warned of it making the soup too runny. It turned out perfect, but I have a feeling it will be quite thick tomorrow. Because I had used an extra sausage (4 at 16 oz rather than the 3/4 lb. that 3 would have been) I used the whole can of tomatoes (14.5 oz over 1 cup). It is not necessarily spicy, but rather nicely warming and perfect for the cold, rainy crappy Oregon February weather!

YuM-MO! This is a fast easy soup that is delicioso as well! I also was unable to find turkey sausage so I used Soy-Rizo which added a ton of flavor (regular chorizo is probably even better). I used chicken broth for stock, lime instead of lemon, added fresh spinach and topped with avocado, lowfat sour cream, crunched up blue tortilla chips and cilantro. Served with fresh corn tortillas with butter and lime. Rave reviews from all!

Wish they had half-forks--I would have given this three and a half. Delicious. Adapted it to use Thanksgiving leftover turkey. Made it pretty much like it said, except substituted some shredded leftover turkey for the turkey sausage. (Threw in a pinch of sage and some crushed fennel seeds to approximate a sausage flavor.) And made the broth by simmering the turkey bones in water. We gobbled it up!

This "soup" was fantastic! I would call it more of a stew (I did add some extra ingredients as some other reviewers suggested). I added a medley of frozen baby corn, peas and green beans, but any extra veggies you have on hand would work. Do not discount the fresh lemon juice at the end....I really think it added a lot to this recipe!

Wow, amazing soup!! Relatively easy - just lots of prep work. I did jazz it up some more too, per some others' great recommendations. Did add the following: roasted corn (frozen), red bell pepper, white onion, subbed 2 cans of chick peas for 1 can each of black and small red beans. I wanted to buy that TJ's cilantro sausage (would have been great), but to save a trip, I bought mild spicy italian sausage instead. I thought the cumin was fantastic in it. I, too, added the whole can of tomatoes, per others' recommendations. I also drained all of the beans. Soup had less liquid (because of this) than I would've preferred, but was still really, really good. Avocado was a great touch on top, along with the cilantro. Also added a spoonful of sour cream, chopped green onions, and a tiny bit of colby jack cheese on top. Great flavor!! Got lots of rave reviews about it! Will be making again!

This soup was great. I added two cans of garbanzo beans, a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of just the cup, and I cooked it for probably 45 min instead of just the 10. Three cans of beans would have been too many. It was very easy and everyone liked it.

This recipe deserves all the accolades given it. I needed something to make for a relative who is sick with a bad cold and found this soup. It was perfect - slightly spicy, tart, meaty and very hearty. I drained the beans (2 cans of chick peas) which helped solve the excess liquid problem.Used some smoked turkey/jalapeno sausage and a couple of turkey brats and the whole can of jalapeno tomatoes and half a fresh jalapeno.Kept out a little of the meat until I blended about two or three cups of the soup for extra thickness.Delicious!!

This is SO delicious. My husband raves about it. I made several changes, many of which have been suggested by other cooks. I used ground turkey instead of sausages (just because it's easier). I used only one can of garbazos. I used a whole can of tomatoes with jalepenos in it, rather than using fresh jalapenos. I also added about 2 oz. of diced green chiles (from a can), ten oz. of spinach, and some red pepper flakes. This is still delicious using many canned ingredients, and it's quick. I'm already making it for a third time. A+

We really liked this soup--would give it 3.5 forks if we could. I used the chicken sausage from Trader Joe's that has mild chiles and cilantro in it. Used the whole can of tomatoes and added 10 oz. of fresh spinach, as others have recommended. Due to dietary needs, we cut the garbanzo beans to 1 can. Easy to make and the cilantro and avocado garnish makes it great!

Made this recipe with regular hot Italian sausage and found it nothing special. Decided to try it again using Italian turkey sausage. It was delicious. I added a large onion and dried red pepper in the beginning, changed one can of garbanzo beans for drained and rinsed black beans. Used a full can of tomatoes,and the required broth, just simmered it at each stage much longer. Added kale at the end and simmered long enough to cook the kale. Don't skip the avocado and cilantro as this gives this soup a wonderful Southwest flavour.

This soup has been winter weeknight dinner staple at our house for years. Out of convenience, I use a whole pound of turkey sausage and a whole can of tomatoes. I don't adjust seasonings, but you could. Three cans a garbanzo beans are a bit much. I use two and add a 10 ounce package of frozen chopped spinach, thawed. Prettier, tastier, healthier and highly recommended.

I have made this soup more often than any other dish in my repertoire. Fast, easy & delicious, it is always better the day after, plus it freezes well. I use 1 can each of garbanzos, red kidney beans and black beans, plus the whole can of diced tomatoes. I also use more chicken stock than called for and then cook the soup longer. A good variation is to add chopped chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, if you can find them. A real winner!!

Terrific use of pantry staples! I used 1/2 lb smoked turkey sausage and a whole can of tomatoes. My only mistake was going a little overboard with the rosemary. I was using some that had been on my spice rack for awhile and I thought it might have lost some flavor so I used about a tsp--wrong. It was clearly too much but it was still quite good.

I added less liquid to this than called for. I think it would have been too diluted otherwise. It's tasty but ugly and needs a bit more color and texture contrast. Next time I'll brown onions with the meat and add lacinato kale cut in to half inch strips with the liquid and simmer until tender.

I can see how pureeing would give you a nice creamy soup; I made it per the recipe and its great that way too.

Awesome! I hadn't read the reviews prior to cooking, so I ended up with a bit of a watery soup at the end of the 15 min simmer.

The lemon juice at the end provided some nice freshness. Healthy and delicious!

This was delicious, easy and perfect for a weeknight supper on a foggy day. I took the advice of others and pureed the soup about halfway with a hand blender, then added the already cooked sausage back into the pot. I also used 1 can garbanzos, 1 of canellini beans and a whole can of diced tomatoes. Since I forgot to get the jalapeno, I substituted approx. 3/4 of a 7oz. can of Herdez green (tomatillo) salsa. We'll make this again - seems great for entertaining.

I thought this recipe was great, only I thought it would be better if it were thicker. So I used a hand blender and pureed half of the soup.

I also used a little less than a tsp. of cumin. All in all though, great flavour! loved it!

I made this about two weekends ago and my husband and I both loved it. I doubled the recipe and substitued white beans and white hominy for some of the garbanzo beans. It's relatively easy and the flavor is fantastic! It freezes well, too... can't wait to make it again.

So good! I used only 2 cans of garbanzos, a whole can of tomatoes and added some fresh chopped sage. Wonderful!

Thanks to all who posted reviews and encouraged me to try this recipe. Quick, easy and very tasty, an immediate family favorite. Is this a great site or what?!

It was cold and snowy here yesterday, so I printed out this recipe and stopped at the store on the way home to get the ingrediants. It was wonderful - warm and homey and it smelled great while cooking. Super easy too. I used white cannelli (sp?)beans instead of garbanzo and mistakenly put in a whole can of diced tomatoes instead of a cup, but i really enjoyed it. Next time I'll probably add a bit more cumin, and possibly leave out the lemon (I'm guessing its more important if you use the garbanzos). But there will definitely be a next time.

I made this using 1 seeded habanero (b/c it was what I had) and it was very good and actually LESS hot as a leftover. The only change I'd make is to make and add a roux to give it a little thickness - great w/fresh bread and a salad!

This soup was excellent --- much better than even my favorite chili recipe. Plus, it's simple to prepare in just minutes and can be doubled just as easily for entertaining. I think the amount of garlic was perfect, just be sure to use fresh garlic. Be sure to use fresh rosemary... as well, the avocado and cilantro garnish on top really made it all the more spectacular. I'll be making this again and again.

This soup was very tasty and filling. I used beef sausage, and tomato sauce because that was what I had in my kitchen, and it was wonderful.

This is a quick, fabulous meal. Next time I'll double the recipe (except the sausage---I'm not a huge meat eater) so that we have a good amount of leftovers for lunch. The lemon juice at the end is key!

I doubled this recipe which meant 16 garlic cloves. I LOVE GARLIC, BUT, I tasted it for days. Please beware.

Amazing! I've been making this soup for many years. Just a suggestion: I once tried it with regular sausage (not turkey) and it does NOT work.

Perfect hearty soup for a cold winters night. Very easy and quick to make. To go along with the soup, I made the corn muffins from the Nov 94 Bon Appetit. Perfect combination.

This delicious recipe has been part of my repertoire since it first appeared on the cover of Bon Appetit. It's wonderful, comforting, and satisfying! It reheats well, and you can turn it into a very hearty tortilla soup by pouring it over good tortilla chips, adding cubes of monterey jack cheese, and squeezing a bit of lime juice over all. Don't forget the cilantro.

I added 2 links of andouille sausage for just a little more substance and flavor. Found it was very heartyand could feed more than stated. Will add this to a SUPERBOWL line-up.

This is one for garlic lovers! If you want taste, you have to try this recipe. It's lowfat and nutritious. I served it with a side of cornbread and left out the avocado.
