My husband and I enjoyed this very much. Since tomatoes aren't at their peak, we substituted two cans of chopped tomatoes. The resulting sauce was enough for a pound of pasta, twice what the recipe calls for. Done this way, the sauce could use a bit of a spicy kick. Next time I'll throw in a few red pepper flakes.

Used a yellow pepper which suits the dish and added 1/4 tsp. dried parsley and a tablespoon of fresh chives that were hanging around my refrigerator. Would have added some chervil if I had it. Great vegetarian meal and would be a good side for garlic shrimp or prawns on the grill. The cauliflower makes it all happen though.

Delicious, sweet (rather than savory) recipe that benefits when you add sweet greens, like spinach. I used canned tomatoes for ease. Another winner for vegetarians/vegans (sans parmesan).Will be making this one again tonight for the second time in two weeks!
