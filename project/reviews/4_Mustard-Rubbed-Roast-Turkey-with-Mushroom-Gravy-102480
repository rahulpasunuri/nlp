This recipe is exceptional. The turkey was juicy and delicious! This amateur cook had no trouble at all recreating the recipe. I highly recommend it!

I had high hopes for this recipe based on reading the reviews, but the turkey turned out poorly. Cooked it according to the directions, but it dried out. The sauce and gravy were also disappointing.

This was my first Thanksgiving turkey and it turned out very well. The meat was very moist and tender, even though I kept forgetting to baste the turkey. For some reason the gravy did not thicken up -- someone asked me for a bowl for the mushroom soup -- but it tasted quite nice. I recommend trying this -- it was quite easy to prepare and came out nicely.

My family insists on this particular recipe every Thanksgiving.

Best turkey ever! Definitely worth rubbing 2 days ahead if you have the space. Excellent! I used a free range 15 pounder - not prebasted or injected.

This is an excellent recipe. I had my doubts at first regarding the mustard, thought it might be too over-powering but boy was it delicious! The turkey was moist and very flavourful. I didn't follow the mushroom gravy recipe and just made a standard flour/water paste. The gravy turned out delicious. The hint of mustard was really good. This recipe is a "keeper". Side note - I paired this with Wild Mushroom and Walnut Stuffing which was really good. My husband said it was a meal in itself.

This year instead of one large turkey, I made two 12 1/2 lb turkeys and two different gravies from the drippings. I used this recipe on one, and made the other the same way I have for years. This one was the best, juiciest and most tender by far! I only marinated it about 15 hrs, and didn't make the mushroom gravy. But I made a roux from the fat, adding all the pan juices, some turkey broth and some of my homemade chicken broth. Everyone loved that gravy more than the usual one. This will be a staple for our Thanksgiving now, I'm sure! Really wonderful!

My dinner guests all agreed that this was the best turkey they had ever tasted. The flavour was divine and the mushroom gravy to-die-for! I served it with Garlic Mashed Potatoes. Can't wait to make it again! May try with chicken next time.

This was delicious! My turkey turned out awesome. The flavor was savory, but not overwhelming. Would definitely prepare a turkey this way again. I did not make the gravy this way though, so I cannot comment on that, but I'm sure it would be great also!

The turkey was very tender and moist but the gravy....now this is something to brag about!! There were only 4 of us this year but we used up almost all of the gravy over dressing and garlic mashed potatoes. Next time I will attempt to double the gravy recipe. A very good choice of bird roasting.

The best yet, we have Thanksgiving at our house every year and have tried many other recipes. This will be our standard.

I made this for my daughter's 2nd birthday, to help the parents with the screaming. It was devoured, I didn't make enough. Extremely tender and juicy. The gravy was awesome. I love showing up my Mom and Mother in Law, although I'd never risk being boastful and being banned from their next home cooked meal! First 2 hours you think by the smell that this is going to be a huge over the top super mustard turkey and then it mellows and blends very nicely.

My mother and I have made this recipe since it came out in'99 at her house and this is the first year we'll be having Thanksgiving at my house. I wouldn't even think of using any other recipe. It is outstanding. The only thing we changed is that we make it with the carmelized onion balsamic gravy from the Nov. 98 issue. Very good, and no cream in it for those watching their fat intake.

Rubbing the turkey breast under the skin really brought out the flavor. A very intimate moment with an otherwise tedious traditional bird.

All of my guests truly loved this recipe. I marinated it a full 2 days and it was incredibly flavorful and moist. The gravy can use a little more umph - but I think it's because my turkey had very little run off juice to blend in.

I have been running from turkeys for years. I made one long ago which was as dry as the Sahara. Then I ran across this recipe. It sounded delicious, and it truly is. Everyone raved! I was so proud of myself. I'll be sure to make this all the time now. It's easy to prepare, moist, and oh so tasty! Anyone who has a turkey phobia to overcome should give this one a whirl. It's great!

This recipe is spectacular. For the first time, the required Thanksgiving narratives ("lovely turkey", "it's so moist") were replaced by sighs, mmmmm, and simple "ohmygod". The table fell silent and everyone slowed down to truly enjoy this luscious fare. No other recipe could compel me to roast a turkey without a holiday or large crowd as excuse. I used mostly criminy mushrooms, with a little porcini and portabella for lift. People asked to take the leftover gravy home! Do this for yourself at least once. By the way, you can do it with a couple chickens too, with 12-24 hours marination. I can't wait to do this again!!

I made this turkey (my 1st turkey) in '99 when the Thanksgiving issue came out and loved it. I thought I had kept the recipe and planned to make it again this year (2002). I couldn't find the recipe and was starting to get nervous. Went online, and here it is! It's absolutely the best, so moist and pretty easy!

I had a 24 pound turkey in my freezer that I bought last November when they were .33 cents per pound. In search of a recipe to use, I came upon this one and decided to give it a try. It was so good. Incredibly moist -- especially considering how long it had been frozen -- and so flavorful! I just had to increase the ingredients. Only change was to use 1/2 and 1/2 instead of whipping cream. Very good recipe.

Since this recipe came out in '99 I have made it over and over again. It makes every turkey moist and full of flavor. This is the type of recepe you keep and pass on to all your friends and family.

This is a great turkey recipe. I marinated it for 2 days and the mustard mixture really soaked into the meat for fantastic flavor. The gravy is excellent and I doubled it for 10 people.

Using this receipe for the 3rd year! Everyone loves it. I have found a roasting bag works well and have even used a cake keeper to marinate.

I made this recipe last year for Thanksgiving dinner and the guests loved it! I haven't made the gravey yet but will try this year. Enjoy!

I have made this recipie several times and everyone always likes the turkey. I have not made the gravey. I suggest adding a few cloves of garlic to the mustard mix for extra flavor.

I tried this recipe Thanksgiving '99. Both the turkey and the gravy were superb. The turkey was very flavorful and tender! Will do it again this year! Everyone loved it.
