Great Christmas appetizer! Substituted V8, no vodka (kids in the room!) and chili sauce for ketchup. Served them in a Chinese soup spoon on a silver tray. Very festive! Was concerned that they would be a little messy with the amount of liquid in the spoon. No problem, not even for the kids!

I have been making this for years. I put in on endive leaves instead of the spoons. Everyone loves this. It's easy to make too.

I served this for a Christmas party and it was a huge hit! I followed the recipe exactly. I used regular vodka and extra black pepper since I did not have the Peppar vodka. I found wide mouthed/stout shot glasses at World Market and served the shrimp in them with some big funky toothpicks I found. I noticed my guests drinking the remaining sauce out of their little shot glasses and thought - either I should have used a small spoon instead of a toothpick, or I could have added a bit more vodka for more of a "shooter" theme. The glasses looked gorgeous on a silver tray. I have had to email the recipe to most of my guests.

Excellent, a real crowd pleaser. Get the spoons, they are perfect for serving. Watch the celery and scallion quantities, I cut mine. Been making this for years, always requested by friends.

This was a big hit for New Year's. Found the spoons (cheap) at a Chinese grocer. We used frozen shrimp boiled in a Cajun spiced water.

This was an increadably easy recipe. Since I only had 8 Chinese soup spoons, I decided to use Belgian Endive for the containers. I used 16-20 count shrimp, placed 1 whole shrimp to one endive leaf, spooned sauce over all, and garnished with cilantro. The presentation in a white porcelain fish shaped platter was quite lovely, and there wasn't one left. Our local market did not carry Absolute Peppar so used Smmirnoff vodka and added a healthy grind of black pepper.

Made these for Christmas Dinner as a first course. Did not have soupspoons, used large wine glasses and put torn lettuce leaves on the bottom. As a first course this served six. This is a keeper and will definitly make again.

amazing! made with V8 last night and it was a hit! they didnt all get eaten but the people who dared try it (I live in WV and people arent used to things that arent fried!) said it was amazing. Great spicy kick at the end. I marinated the sauce and shrimp for three hours before i served them

These are a delicious spicy chilled pick-me-ups. Make sauce preferably using V8 or Clamato juice rather than ketchup; increase quantities of horseradish, lemon juice, tabasco, salt to make a jolting spicy sauce. Serve in plastic small wine glasses; pour 1/3 c sauce, top with 3-4 shrimps. Garnish with fresh oregano.

Perfect recipe for entertaining. I've made this several times for parties and everyone loves them. Be sure you have lots of spoons!

Excellent. I was a skeptic to be honest making this and people raved about it. I added advocado to the celery and scallion mixture. I also did 1/3 chili sauce to 2/3 ketchup. I orginally did 1/2 and 1/2 but found it too sweet. Overall a great and easy appetizer and a surprising crowd pleaser.

My guests loved these. I served them in mini martini glasses as someone else suggested and the presentation was eye catching. Cutting the shrimp into thirds was just right for the glasses. Would make this again

ps. I did use little plastic shooter cups instead of chinese spoons and it was easy for everyone, no muss no fuss.

This is such an easy appetizer to prepare and gets great reviews by everyone that eats the shrimp. I do use part ketchup and part chili sauce though and add to taste, more horseradish and tobasco. I also add large diced avacado. Made it this year for xmas eve party and every bit of it was gone within no time.

Great recipe & super easy. I used a pretty strong horseradish, so these had a definite kick to them. I left the shrimp whole and served them in Chinese spoons - two shrimp per spoon - and they were a huge hit. It did seem to make a lot of sauce though, so next time I will cut down on some of the sauce ingredients. If you're looking for an impressive but simple appetizer recipe, this is it.

P.S. I used V8 juice instead of ketchup. This is definitely a bloody Mary lovers recipe. If you don't like bloody Mary's, don't make this.

Well I just did my own pre-Xmas dinner test, Gourmande65, and I don't know what's wrong with your taste buds, but this stuff is excellent! You can have the ordinary cocktail sauce; I'll take this anytime. Can't think of a thing that would make it better!

Too much green onion and celery, very spicy but lacks complexity. Not that tasty. I may just try cocktail sauce with some of the ingredients of this recipe. I'm 0 for 2 today after trying the quiche in prosciutto cups...good thing I did the test before the Christmas dinner!

Incredibly fast and easy...those who crave heat will love this dish. I used the Barefoot Contessa ketchup, which added some pizzazz, and cut down on the amount of tabasco as the Barefoot Contessa has added spice. This one is a keeper.

great recipe- I do not cute up the shrimp and serve whole - presentation on a platter and spoon extra sauce on tops. Have your appetizer picks ready for your guests to serve them up - Works great and you can leave it on the buffet and enjoy your guests

Very good, but would use less ketchup or maybe chili sauce as another reviewer wrote. Ketchup made it too sweet.

Great as a sterter for a special meal. I actually used Whole Foods prepared coctail sauce and added the vodka. I also added cilantro --- the left overs are great the next day on tortilla chips!

I have made this recipe several times now, both at home and to take to parties. Everyone loves the taste and texture everytime. I use endive, as one reviewer suggested, and I actually think it adds to the flavor and makes it taste and feel even more like you are eating a great bloody mary appetizer. I highly recommend and will continue to make this recipe.

Made for Xmas and it was a huge hit. Instead of the Chinese spoons I used miniature pastry tins that I got a Cost Plus for $.29/each. Will make again but w/ a large group (35+ people) I would not recommend UNLESS you have the spoons/tins already staged.

Very tasty! I've served this dish several times for family and company. Consider serving bites of the shrimp mixture over whipped cream cheese and crackers.

Just made this - served it in bowls to scoop onto endive. I spiced it up a bit - used another commenter's recommendation and went with chile sauce instead of ketchup, plus extra horseradish and Worcestershire. It was a huge hit. I'll definitely make it again.

I made this last evening as part of a tapas meal. I was underwhelmed! There wasn't a lot of flavor, in spite of the combination of spicy ingredients in the sauce. I cut back on the scallions and celery, because the amounts in the recipe were out of proportion to the amount of shrimp. I used endive, as was suggested earlier. The sauce was a little too thin for that but it was better than investing in 50 Chinese soupspoons that will never get used again. My guests and I thought a good cocktail sauce would have been a better way to serve the shrimp.

This a a WOW appetizer that your guest will love. Is now requested from family/friends at every holiday get together.

Outstanding recipe and quick to make. I used Grey Goose rather than Peppar, a little extra hot sauce and horseradish. It was a big hit with everyone at our dinner party.

This is a great recipe. A time saver tip: Buy pre- cooked deveined shrimp (31-40/lb), thaw, remove tails, then mix with sauce and let marinade before serving.

This was extremely easy to make by using precooked frozen shrimp. It was an absolute hit with the guests. I served them in mini martini glasses and will be adding this recipe to the keep list. While the recommended vodka is pricey for a recipe - it proved to be well worth it.

I did not have the special spoons and also wanted to make an appetizer that was more substantial. So, I increased the recipe and spooned the shrimp mixture into margarita style glasses. Topped that with real Bloody Mary mix I made with V8 juice. Garnished each with celery stick "twizzlers." It was a big hit at my 2007 NYE dinner party!

Rating: 1
Went out and bought all the spoons and was really excited to have this chic appetizer. Did not go over well. Was tasty, but nothing special. Would probably consider serving again, but would use precooked shrimp and maybe a store bought bloody mary mix. The color of it was a little off and really unappetizing. The celery and green onions were not really incorporated into the sauce at all.

Yum! I made these three times over the holidays, once for Christmas Eve with neighbors, for our Christmas Day "Feast of Seven Fishes" and again as part of our 8th annual NYE progressive dinner and they were a big hit each time. Twice I used the Chinese soup spoons to have elegant little bites and on Christmas day with with family when I wanted it to be an entire course, in small Martini glasses with a small cocktail fork. I took the suggestion of previous reviewer and used chili sauce to replace the catchup and because my horseradish was strong used only 1/2 the amount. The first two times I cooked shrimp and cut, for NYE when I needed more portions and a time saver I used frozen pre-cooked baby shrimp from Sam's. With the great sauce this is the way to go and the small size made it even easier to load into the Chinese spoons (hard to find this season except at World Market)!!

Made it as a "trial" before serving it at a friend's b-day party next Saturday. Will definitely make it. It is SOO good!

A big hit as an amuse bouche on NYE. I forgot the avocado, which may the reason it gets three forks and not four.

A huge hit! I used frozen shrimp, cut the avocado right into the mixture, and served in small bowls. Seconds and thirds all around!

Served this at a bridal shower - rave reviews. I personally was worried about the vodka but you can't taste it at all! If you use endive leaves it may be difficult to keep them crisp once they have the shrimp in them. I think next time I'd just cut the shrimp into bites and serve it alone.

Made this recipe for New Year's Eve and it was a huge hit. Used pre-cooked shrimp and it saved a ton of time. Didn't have the Chinese soup spoons (used shot glasses instead which work in a pinch but aren't ideal) but will purchase the spoons for the next time I make this. This will be a great tailgating recipe for football season!

This was delicious, easy and a hit on Christmas Eve. We used endive as well, which adds nice color and flavor.

Simple and tasty. A bit spicy for some tastes; to accommodate all, I would use half the tabasco and pepper next time. Serving on endive is a great alternative, the spooons are cute, but inconvenient to clean and re-load.

We used little paper dixie cups - not too elegant but very practical! These were the hit of my family Christmas party. The sauce is spicy - we had contests who had the highest tolerance for heat.

I put all the shrimp in a glass with a big piece of celery that people used to scoop the shrimp onto their individual plates, I really like the endive idea though, especially if you looking for bite sized hors d'oeuvres with no plates.

debnev perhaps the hollowed out end of a cucumber or half a lime could substitute for the spoons.you can cut the tips off so they can stand on end

I haven't made these yet. I have a question. Can anyone suggest how else I might serve these? I'm hardly going to go out and buy 20 of those those spoon things. Thanks.
