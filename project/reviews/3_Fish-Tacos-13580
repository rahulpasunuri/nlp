These tacos are so good. Very good. So Good. They are light, almost like ceviche. To take it over the top, fry the corn tortillas in corn oil for crispy delish taco shells and nachos. Sure to please on a buffet or pot-luck. Load up the fried shells (they won't get soggy) and garnish with more lime wedges. EVERYONE will LOVE IT! My hat's off to Gourmet magazine test kitchen - the best recipes are in the 80's and early 90's

i was looking for a way to use some tilapia i had in the freezer and found this. excellent, healthy, tasty! next time i'm going to add some capers -- i think it would be a nice salty foil along with the olives. also, since my husband and i like things spicy, i added some crushed red pepper flakes.

I will not make this recipe and I just wanted to share that no fish taco I EVER had in Baja had olives and jalepenos on it, let alone topped with lettuce. A true baja taco is fried fish, fresh salsa, cabbage, and a mayonnaise based sauce. Simple and perfect!

Just a comment. They don't use "ranch sauce" in the part of Mexico I spent time in, so I'm not sure what all this about traditional fish tacos is. Don't give forks if you haven't made the dish.

I thought this was a wonderful easy and healthy recipe. I used flour tortillas instead of frying corn tortillas, and cole slaw mix as suggested. Only marinated fish in tomato mixture 40 minutes b/c we were hungry, could have used more time for flavor to develop. Also served with black bean salad, delicious! I will definitely make this again.

I tried this recipe and found it turned out very good fish tacos. I did change a bit of the recipe to suit my palate. I used Iclandic Cod which I gently pan fried. after the cooling and flaking I drizzled lime juice and added chopped cilantro. I chilled this for about an hour. then I toasted some taco shells, added the filling and topped it with pre-packaged cole slaw mix, sans the mayo (Dispise the stuff) and a good fresh salsa. Muy Delicioso! Also to those who said this is not a traditional fish taco, who cares! In cooking and dining taste is what matters most.

I started to make this recipe last night. I halved it, and so only used a 12 oz. package of "Captain's Cove" frozen cod. I baked the cod as per the package directions, and it turned out tough and rubbery. Marinated the fish pieces in the sauce overnight and made the tacos tonight. The fish was still terrible and the corn tortillas fell apart. Maybe I suffered from bad ingredients, but this was one of the worst recipes I have ever made and will never make it again, at least not as written. My suggestions: use fish other than cod, hard taco shells, lettuce instead of cabbage, and serve warm as soon as you can mix the fish with the sauce. Then it might be edible, and perhaps even good.

I agree with the "Cook from Bowmanville, Ontario, Canada" but why isn't anyone adding chopped cilantro right before serving? It's the final savory taste to a very tasty recipe.

I have made this dish several times, great cause I can get home from work, prepare the filling, go take a walk or bike ride, come home and finish up the dish. I have used several types of fish, red snapper, tilapia etc, never scrod, with good result each time. I use only us purple cabbage on top and serve with yellow rice and black bean salad (a 4 forker). Obviously not traditional, but who wants to fry fish at home??? thats why there is rubio's

If you dont want to fry (which I dont) you can just use empanada dough which you can buy frozen in your suppermarket, and dont marinate the fish that long its supposed to taste like fish remember.

I am looking for ways to cook fish that do not involve frying. The suggestion of wheat shells is great, and as for those who do not try a recipie and then bash it because it is not what they consider "original", go to Mexico and see if all the dishes are cooked the same in each household. We all adjust recipies to fit our own tastes.

Just for the record, the person in San Diego who "didn't bother making" these is basing their idea of a traditional fish taco on Rubio's fish tacos which are close, but altered to suit the American palate. How do you figure that "ranch sauce" which isn't even what Rubio's uses is a traditional mexican condiment? Clearly you know little about food and why bother to review something if you haven't made it? You have just illustrated one of societies greatest ills... ignorance. Now that that is out of the way. These are great, but substitute shredded green cabbage and try a mayo/salsa mixture for the sauce.

The traditional fish taco recipe is one of my favorites. Here is my version. The sauce I use is a mix of mayo and spicy salsa, laid atop the sauce I put beer-battered fish strips, shredded cabbage and finally, a squeeze of lime. Delicious!

The January 2000 issue of Gourmet has a recipe for traditional San Felipe fish tacos that are out of this world. Highly recommended, although I can't find it on this sight at this time.

I've made this about 5 times using Pacific snapper and it is great every time. We use whole wheat tortillas instead of frying corn tortillas. The negative reviews are misleading. TIYLI

I didn't even bother making this dish because these are NOT traditional fish tacos. For starters, fish tacos are made with shredded cabbage, not shredded lettuce. Also, the sauce is a certain type of ranch sauce.

This is in no way a true Mexican Fish Taco and will probably give my favorite taco a bad name.
