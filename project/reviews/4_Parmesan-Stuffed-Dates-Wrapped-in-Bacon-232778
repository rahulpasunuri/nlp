Everyone at the party I brought this to LOVED them! I shopped at Whole Foods for my ingredients I got the Black Forest Bacon which is a thick cut and quite sweet. Also used the regular dates that Whole Food offered. I ended up opening the date in order to stuff it with the cheese but give such a thick cut of bacon it worked perfectly! I can't wait to make these again, super easy and party approved!

Whenever I make these, they get eaten up immediately. It does take awhile to assemble these, but the flavors are well worth the effort. Putting the sticks of parm inside the date is much easier than other recipes that use softer cheeses.

I was looking for a recipe that would replicate some delicious blue cheese-stuffed bacon-wrapped dates we had at a restaurant. I found this and have been using blue cheese instead of parmesan, which is a wonderful alternative if you don't think the parmesan works.

Made these at Christmas. Resisted temptation to eat the last two kept them to see how they would reheat next day. Heated them in the microwave for a couple of minutes and they were just as good. I used the Medjool dates, next time I will try the regular size but found the Medjools perfect, too good to resist.

I had these in a restaurant and wanted to duplicate at home. I am very pleased with how they came out. They are both delicious and easy. It did take longer than the time shown however to get the bacon crispy in the oven. Took five minutes to prep. Line your pan with foil and then there is no clean up time.

I make something similar using blanched almonds rather than parmesan, but I'm definitely going to try this version. I've never put the toothpick in until after cooking (I just cooked them seam-side down), but if I can do it without lighting the toothpicks on fire, I will. People go nuts for these!

Made these for Christmas 2nd year in a row. I bring them to my brothers and throw them in the oven in the midst of everyone crowding around the kitchen, so I could not attend to them as I would have liked but they were still fine. I didn't turn them, so I wish I had thought to put them on the baking sheet cheese side up, to minimize cheese out leakage. Regardless, they are different and the flavor combo is unusual and works.

I wanted to add my positive review of this recipe--people always request that I bring them to parties! I cut the bacon slices in two and first fry them slowly at low heat till the slices are translucent but NOT browned. Then I wrap the filled dates (plain "California pitted dates," according to the package), secure them with toothpicks, and bake them at 375 F for 10-15 minutes (depending on whether they've been refrigerated) until browned. (Drain on paper towels.) They don't need to be turned over in the oven. They're not crunchy but are a nice sweet contrast to other more salty appetizers.

We've had this app various times but have never made it. In this case, we used Medjool dates as the recipe called for and I feel this is a mistake. Smaller Algerian dates would work better & be a single-bite app vs the Medjool which is at least two bites. We tried the recipe with & without the Parmigiano & found the cheese really did little for the dish. The times & temps worked well though. Next time I'll use smaller dates & no cheese.

I wouldn't make these again. I thought the taste was just okay and I used top notch parmesan and medjool dates.

I usually make bacon wrapped water chestnuts smothered in brown sugar, mayo and chili sauce but decided to go with this recipe as a more healthy alternative... Had many relatives tell me that they prefer the crunchiness and flavor of the water chestnut version as opposed to the dates so I will not be making this again.

Rating: 4
These are fantastic and so easy. So many variations, so be creative! I use gruyere cheese and I broil them so I don't have to flip them at all. If your cheese is falling out the ends, you're using too big of a piece. You don't want the cheese to be exactly as long as the date. I also use maple bacon to compliment the sweetness of the date. People who don't like dates always go back for seconds. Sure to please any crowd!!

Thanks to this recipe, I won second place in a friend's bacon-themed gathering, Baconalia. Everyone brought dishes made with bacon. Since the recipe is so simple, using excellent ingredients makes the difference. I got Black Forest bacon at Whole Foods and it was outstanding.

Very very easy and exceptionally good. One friend told me they were the "best thing she had ever put in her mouth." Use blue cheese and prosciutto for a more complex flavor. If you use prosciutto instead of bacon 6 minutes in the oven is plenty.

Fabulous! A chef friend recommended "poaching" the bacon first for 2 minutes before wrapping it around the date, and that really made the bacon easier to work with!

always a huge hit at parties, great to make ahead and reheat. I like using prosciutto instead of bacon as it completing shrink wraps around the dated and you don't need picks

I had a champagne party and these were the biggest hit of the night! I used Parmesan for some of them, but I tried stuffing some with Fourme d'Ambert bleu cheese and those turned out even better! I tried these once with regular dates, but I think the medjool dates are easier to work with and stuff. Highly recommend this recipe for an easy cocktail party dish that's guaranteed to impress.

these are so yummy. I also stuffed the dates with almonds. They are always a hit at any party.

I made an assortment of these: parmesan with fresh basil, parmesan with pinenuts, and manchego. All in all, I thought they were just okay. The bacon didn't keep the melting cheese from leaking out of the dates, and the bacon's strong smoky flavor overpowered all the other flavors. The dedicated bacon lovers ate a bunch of these when they were fresh, but no one good face them again later, so all the leftovers went in the trash.

These truly are exceptional. I actually up the oven temp to 500 and cook for about 6-8 minutes. No need to turn. Another variation that is sure to please is to stuff the dates with an unsalted almond and goat cheese. Simply to die for!!

This is delectable and so easy! I used petite dates which seemed the perfect size (the common dates seemed too large). I recommend flipping the pieces half-way through the cooking time. I also discarded the overly fatty ends of the bacon strips to ensure a nice amount of meat around each piece. These were the quickest appetizers to go at my party. I will definitely make them again!

These are truly exceptional, and have received categorically amazing responses from everyone I know who has tried them. The only caveats: baking may take around 20 minutes -- cook until the bacon is done, and, depending on your ventilation will make the place smell like bacon.

These amazing little miracles always make my guests swoon and they are fantastic with a cocktail. I like that I can prep them in advance and then just stick them in the oven as my guests arrive. I've tried making them with other cheeses and while I like them best with Parmesan, they are also delicious with a blue cheese. Goat cheese can melt too fast and get a bit runny so if that's your choice, try to use an aged one.

Rating: 3
I really like this recipe. I make it using an almond in the middle, rather than cheese. I found it needs a whole strip of bacon that way, rather than a third. Another reviewers suggestion to cut the dates in half seems like a great idea.

I loved this recipe. I was trying it for our gourmet group. It is very rich. You can not eat many of them. I will probably make this recipe with no more than two per person and something light as well. To bad more people don't like dates. HOw wonderful you can assemble the day before.

These were so good! I used Manchego (a hard sheep's milk cheese) in place of the Parmesano Reggiano. I think that they are best made with a harder, nuttier cheese that won't ooze out onto the baking pan. Very nice. Best served HOT is right, just don't burn your tongue.

Wow....these little nuggets could be the first step toward world peace! I didn't plan to double the recipe, but thank goodness I did. We had a hearty crowd at our house Saturday night and the smell from the oven must have been spectacular...they didn't even make it to the parchment paper...one man swiped on off the baking sheet. This was definitely the bell of the ball!! I used the Manchego as suggested by a previous cook.

Made 4 stuffed date versions: parmesan, gorgonzola, pineapple & spiced pecan ... all wrapped in Niman Ranch thick cut bacon (found at Trader Joe's). Thick cut bacon takes closer to 25 minutes to cook, but these can be reheated in a microwave with good results. The gorgonzola melted away, but still tasted good - I thought the pecan was the winner but the pineapple was very popular too.

I make a lot of Epicurious recipes, and have never commented before. But, these dates were so good I had to say something. I made them for a party and they lasted about 30 seconds. Everyone kept coming back for more. I had to beat people off so I could save some for the late arrivers. I did make one change though. I used Fontina instead of parmesean. I do think the sharper parm would be better though (if it is even possible).

Addendum to prior review: I also tried this using dried organic Turkish apricots and dried plums. I think the apricot version was the best of the three.

We had these last night at AOC and today I made this recipe to compare. The only difference seems to be that AOC uses less bacon or a very thin slice. I had to cook these 20 minutes total--the bacon was not cooked after only ten minutes. Also, using parmesan cheese sticks makes it very easy to stuff the dates. Not sure why anyone would use a creamy/soft cheese for this recipe. What a mess. In any case, the bacon flavor is so strong that I couldn't even tell there was cheese. Even at AOC, I was picking at the date, trying to see if there was any cheese as I couldn't taste it. Maybe next time I will wrap in bacon only. They are still delicious.

Like other reviewers, I find dates cloyingly sweet so opted for dried mission figs instead - worked beautifully! Wrapped with bacon and stuffed with a variety of fillings: a chunk of parmigiano-reggiano wrapped in a basil leaf, coarsely grated parmigiano-reggiano with chopped toasted pine nuts, peppered goat cheese and snipped chives, and coarsely grated Swiss emmental mixed with slivered toasted almonds. Served to my book club and they proclaimed the winners: Emmental/almonds and parmesan/pine nuts although all were tasty. Suggestion: If using dried figs, I think bacon (rather than proscuitto or serrano) is preferable due to the higher fat content which helps to soften the figs. Enjoy!

Rating: 2
I tried with manchego as the other reviews suggested. Did anybody else find the balance off? The cheese didn't really come through -- just a lot of date and bacon. I did use medjool dates, perhaps they were just too big? Other people did seem to like them, but I think I will keep trying.

Rating: 2
The dates can get cloying (hard to chew, like taffy) once they start to cool. The salt and sweet flavors are terrific. This is not an "EVERYONE LOVES IT" recipe, but would be great for a holiday cocktail party where people need a choice.

How dare Suzanne Goins claim this recipe as her own invention! I too enjoyed these in the 60's - my nan made them to hand round before xmas dinner. My favourite is blue cheese but any cheese will do. I now always make them for parties but intersperse them on the plate with bacon-wrapped bananas (my own invention?) Simply wrap chunks of banana in bacon and secure with cocktail stick. Cook in the oven with dates. I do have a bit of a passion for bananas but everyone else raves about them too! I'd appreciate anyone else's opinion if you try them.

Suzanne Goins is a truly gifted chef...however "invented" is a bit of a stetch on this one; my mother's most in-demand hors d'oeuvres in the '60's was identical to this recipe, the sole variation being sharp cheddar rather than parmigiano/manchego/bleu....and they were, and still are, sensational (though she didn't "invent" them either) so, all you alternative-version fans, there's another one to try...enjoy!
