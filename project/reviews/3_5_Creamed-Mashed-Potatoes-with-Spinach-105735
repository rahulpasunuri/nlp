Even though I love garlic, I resisted the urge to add it and made it just as directed. It was delicious.

i make a version of potatoes with spinach where instead of just wilting the spinach before adding it to the potatoes, i sautee the spinach in olive oil and garlic. yum.

I liked this recipe a lot. The consistency was appealing and the taste surprisingly light, despite the sour cream.

I made this recipe for dinner tonight and not only is it easy to make it is a real hit - even for entertaining. The order that I did this in was altered from the directions. I used unpeeeled potatoes, cut up. When they were soft I mashed them with the cream and butter. Then I added the spinach. Less work, less clean-up and excellent results. I used fat-free half and half and added a few peeled garlic cloves!!

This was a nice alternative to regular mashed or the overdone garlic mashed, but needs more salt. I also tried this with skim milk and less butter and was pleased with the results, although it wasn't as rich as the cream recipe.

While there was certainly nothing wrong with this dish, I was underwhelmed by it. I served it as a side dish to the very elegant Glazed Sea Bass with Ginger Butter Sauce. The tastes went well together, but the Spinach Potatoes didn't look as nice on the plate as I hoped.

I've been searching for this recipe for a long time-it reminds of a dish my Hungarian grandma-in-law use to make! Delicious!

Really good, and my kids liked it too. But obviously they posted the wrong picture.
