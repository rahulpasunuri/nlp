We make this rocky road candy every year at Christmas and everyone loves it. It's a great recipe, easy to make and a great addition to the candy dish.

Candy was too hard, marshmallows too big, even tho I cut them in quarters, and it just tasted like melted bittersweet chocolate. Won't do again.

This was very tasty! I used 50%Valrohna Dark Orange Chocolate and 50% their 70% Bittersweet and omitted the orange peel. The Orange flavored chocolate has a nice flavor and worked well for this. Also used some "old-fashioned" vanilla flavored marshmellows that I cut into 1/8's and they added a nice flavor, too. Followed another cook's advice and spooned mixture right into candy cups and they looked great and were so easy to handle, too.

The tart cherries and crystallized ginger gave these a wonderfull bite in what could otherwise be a cloyingly sweet treat. Also used bittersweet chocolate and mini marshmallows. Can't wait for next year!

I used high quality bittersweet chocolate and mini marshmallows and this was wonderful! It just went into teachers' goodie tins - what we didn't eat, that is.

I substituted lime peels for orange peels, and omitted ginger. Everybody liked the result. NWRR is a great improvement on the classic dessert.

I don't believe this is worth making again. The orange flavor was way too strong and the marshmallows were way too large. Many guests didn't like the dried fruit in it either.

This deserves a 3.5 fork. It was incredibly easy and delicious. Next time I will use more crystalized ginger and not chop it so finely (tip: Trader Joe's has crystalized ginger chopped and cheap), and will keep the cranberries whole. DEFINITELY cut up the marshmallows. I cut them in 4ths. Minis would work well, too. All in all, an excellent recipe that can be whipped this up in minutes for last minute hostess gifts, Christmas gifts, etc.

Incredibly easy. I made a few changes: I omitted the crystallized ginger and used miniature marshmallows. I also used dried cranberries and Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips (I just heat them in a heavy pan right on the burner and skip the double boiler--I've never had a problem with that if I just keep the heat low.) Instead of spreading the whole thing in a pan I dropped teaspoonfuls directly into foil cups (sprayed lightly with cooking spray). They look and taste great! Perfect for the holidays.

What a great candy to make for the holidays! Great presentation. The orange flavor was way to strong for us, so I will leave it out all together next time. I may also cut out the dried fruit and add some coconut instead. Yum yum!

This was fantastic! I used a 9x9 pan. Yes, cut up the large marshmallows, but otherewise, don't change a thing! The ginger, orange, cranberry combination was just about perfect. Made several batches to put in "omyage" bags (Japanese for little gift) for my husband's retirement party. Can't wait to make this for Christmas gift boxes.

One of the greatest things about this recipe, is that it can easily be made vegan - with vegan chocolate, and kosher marshmellows. I will make this recipe every year for my vegan friends.

This was a big hit at our holiday party, and very easy to make. I substituted 1/2 bag of mini marshmallows (why not?), and also used 1/2 semisweet chocolate and 1/2 white chocolate in place of all semisweet, which worked out great. I kind of swirled it in the pan. I also left out the nuts because my family does not like nuts and it wasn't a problem. For a holiday touch I sprinkled red & green sugar on top. I will definitely make this again -- rave reviews from friends and family without too much work on my part.

I thought this was great. I cut the marshmallows in half, but may take the advice of a previous reviewer and cut them in quarters. This will become standard fare for me during the holidays. Very easy to make.

I had to rate this as a 3 because I'm not a big marshmallow fan, but others who ate this on Thanksgiving loved it. I'm making more to put in baskets for Christmas gifts. This time I'll be cutting large marshmallows in quarters so they are larger than mini, but not as big as a large size. Also, I used 1/2 the amount of ginger and it came out great.

This was very easy to make and the quantities worked out in terms of filling the pan and being able to make the amount of candy that the recipe said I would get. If I had some changes next time I might try to use about half a bag of small marshmallows instead of 22 big ones, because some candy pieces were marshmallow-deficient while others were all marshmallow. Another change I might try would be to use less orange peel, because I felt the orange flavor was a little too dominant.
