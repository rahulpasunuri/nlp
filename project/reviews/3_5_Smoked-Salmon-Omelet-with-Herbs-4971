Interesting blend of flavors. I don't care much for sour cream, but it's essential for this. The grainy mustard, tarragon, onions and salmon were each noticeable and yet blended well. That being said, here's my wife's take: "Oh my God, this is WONDERFUL!!! We've GOT to make this again!" The only caveat I have is make sure everything is ready to go before you start cooking, and have everything at room temperature. It matters.

This was a really simple and easy brunch-like dish to make on a day when I wanted to do something with smoked salmon other than put it on a bagel. I didn't have tarragon so I used a dash of dried sage instead. Not too heavy. Go easy on the mustard spread.

I served this to a special friend tonight and we each have our own opinions. I felt that the sour cream/mustard mixture in the omelet gave the sensation that the eggs were still pretty runny inside. The flavor was very good, but in the future, I'll make it with the sauce drizzled across the top. Also - I normallly like grainy mustard, but in this case, it made the eggs feel as if they were grainy, which was disconcerting! My guest said that he liked it a lot, but he felt that if he were to make it, he'd put the salmon on the side, perhaps with a little lemon sprinkled on it. He liked the combination of herbs, mustard and sour cream, although, he thought the "full strength" (regular sour cream) would have given the omelet a richer taste. We would both have this again. We had it w/ a lovely New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, a lobster bisque to start, and a salad of mesclun, peeled tomatoes, nicoise olives, avocados and a basalmic vinaigarette dressing, which we both felt was a good foil to the slightly greasy smoked salmon. This was so quick and easy to make and it looked very nice. I'll put this in my quick recipe file. Good to serve at brunch, lunch or dinner!

This is a very chic, yet simple omelet. Nothing to add, nothing to withdraw. It's just perfect. Note: I don't think it's necessary to cut salmon into strips, whole slices look (and taste) much better.

I used fresh cooked leftover salmon fillets to make this dish. I replace the tarragon with dill but mixed it with the salmon mixture to avoid loss of flavour from overcooking. Very good!

Very good! I would make it again. Use grainy mustard. I made this last Spring when my chives were the most tender, however you could use choppped green onions.

Easy recipe - wonderful flavor add it to your Sunday best list!! I used regular dijon and think the grainy would be better and reduce the amount. The chives & tarragon are a great combination!!!
