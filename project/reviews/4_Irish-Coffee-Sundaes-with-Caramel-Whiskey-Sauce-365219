I tried to halve this recipe and it didn't work. There just wasn't enough liquid and sugar and it sort of just solidied in the pan. So, I'm going to make another FULL batch and I'm sure it'll be fantastic. Just note: Don't try to halve this one! :)

This was great! My caramel sauce took a lot longer to turn color than indicated in the recipe but that's no big deal. The combination of toffee, caramel sauce and coffee ice cream was delicious. My guests thought so too. Try this easy but inpressive dessert.
