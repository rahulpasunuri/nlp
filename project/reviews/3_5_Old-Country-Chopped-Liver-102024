Because of cholesterol issues, I only make this at Passover, but it is worth the wait! This is a delicious chopped liver, and I look forward to Passover so I can have some!

This is a good classic recipe. I find that I CAN make it in the food processor if I am very careful to pulse only a few times, so the texture remains course. (It helps if you process the cooked onions and cooked liver separately and then combine.) I want to add some serving ideas. Spread on rye bread for a sandwich, or on one side of a sliced turkey or chicken sandwich. Use as dip with crackers, or cucumber slices, or (my favorite) on a big juicy stalk of celery. My mom used to serve it on some iceberg lettuce leaves. I'd roll up the leaf and eat it - like a dolma. Delish!

Thanks heaps. I grew up in New Jersey Philly area and spent nine years living in NYC in my 20's to mid thirties. Have been in the Dallas area now for 20 years and I've never seen chopped liver at any store or on any menu here. That is why I use your recipe to treat myself once in a while. Gentile - ly.

No different from any other "recipe" for chopped liver, all of which comprise livers, onions, eggs, salt and pepper, and minor additions. (Dear Minnetonka: "frozen chopped onions"??? You can buy schmaltz and gribenes, but can't chop fresh onions? FROZEN onions????? Pathetic.)

My go-to schmaltz recipe. Adding gribenes is a revelation. But Jewishmama, butter? Oiy!!!

I'm sorry I didn't read this recipe before I read "Grandma's Chopped Liver" and left my comments on that one. I also use 1 lb chicken livers, but I fry them in schmaltz, not broil. I use 1 bag frozen chopped onions (saves a lot of time) and fry them in schmaltz and 3 eggs per lb of livers. I don't add pepper or gribenes. I PULSE each one individually in the food processor and mix in the salt last. Fabulous.

Too formal, My recipe is as follows: depending on how many at the sedar and how many will be taking chopped liver home. 4 containers of store bought livers. chop one onion per container saute in either schmaltz (best) or 1/2 stick of butter per container. Saute till livers are done When cool pulse in a food processor till coarse cook hard boiled eggs one egg per container (more if you want copped liver to be stiffer) cool eggs and chop Add eggs to chopped liver and add salt and pepper to taste. Refrigerate a few hours (I cool overnight)

how do you use the meet grinder. This sounds like my moms recipe and I want to make it for my day. My mother recently passed and I never learned it. She use a meat grinder.

My grandmother has been gone for over 10 years, and my mom never learned to make chopped liver. I was having my mom over for Rosh Hashanah and wanted to surprise her with chopped liver. I found this recipe and it sounded just like my grandmother's. The only change I made was that I did use a meat grinder, because I know that's what she did. It tasted EXACTLY like my grandmother's chopped liver! I can't thank you enough for a great recipe, and wonderful memories of my childhood dinners at Nana's!

Thank you from the bottom of my heart for this recipe. I grew up in suburban Miami, FL and was very fortunate to have wonderful Jewish friends who fed me delicious cuisine. I have always loved chopped liver and when I lived in Chicago for 10 years, I was deeply happy. I am now living in Macon, GA (don't even ask!) and I would have to drive at least 90 miles into the Atlanta area to find anything remotely like a lovely Jewish deli. Thank you again for giving this wonderful secret to us all.

In my family we use the same ingredients with 1 addition. When we cook chicken soup for the holidays, we also use a boiled carrot from the soup for the liver. It adds a wonderful sweetness to the liver. If the liver comes out dry after chopping/grinding we add some chicken broth to it to moisten. I have an old school metal hand grinder for the sole purpose of grinding up chopped liver, just the way grandma made it.

Loved this recipe! Made it as per the recipe except for the schmaltz. For dietary reasons I used a quality extra virgin olive oil instead and it worked beautifully. The flavor was right on and the texture was lighter, less pasty. More like a relish than a spread -- the gain in flavor amply made up for the change in texture. Had some prior to refrigeration and that worked too! Good food made easy. A definite winner.

Great recipe. A comment on the previous snd a suggestion. To the person who gave this recipe one star because it wasn't made out of beef liver, maybe you should have rated a beef chopped liver recipe instead. As far as rendering fat, I learned the hard way to use a double-boiler to render chicken fat when mine blew-up all over the ceiling one year because I let it get too hot. Same result with less risk. Only problem is, no gribeners. No biggie as far as I am concerned.

Rating: 4
For other goys, gribenes are essentially chicken-skin bacon bits (!!!). They're very crisp leftovers to rendering the chicken fat. Sorry, Bubbie, but I used my Cuisinart. You just have to be careful to leave good texture. Also, I added some garlic. Great recipe.

Note- If you keep kosher it is required by jewish dietary laws to Broil chicken livers under a flame, this is the reason kosher fresh chicken livers are hard to find and usually come pre-broiled and vacum packed these days. If purchased at a certified Kosher butcher raw the package will have a warning on it referring to the "Broil" fact

OMG! Wow....this really does need thousands of forks...fabulous, incredibly rich and savory...the kind of mouthful that makes you throw your head back, shut your eyes and hope you aren't moaning out loud. I, lacking time and gumption, skipped the broiling part...I was sure that just sauteeing the livers with the onions would leave me wanting a depth of flavor, but the livers got a nice sear in the schmaltz and like I said...it was amazing. I agree that sauteeing the onions a little bit more than the livers, brings out their sweetness, and the little crackly bits make a texture RIOT! I have a question for you experienced chopped liver maker/eaters... does it freeze?

Rating: 3
Contrary to previous comment, I find broiling the livers first so much better than sauteeing! I alway used to sautee the liver and onions together, and the livers exuded so much liquid that is wa almost like boiling them! Broiling solves that an the flavor is much richer.

We haven't had homemade chopped liver since Gra'ma went to the retirment center. Made it for the family and they went nuts! First time, I sauteed the livers and onions in the schmaltz. (Must use chicken fat) It was too liquidy so I drained it a bit...then it was a bit dry after it chilled. I mashed everything with a potato masher and the texture was fine. Second time, I broiled the livers and sauteed the onions in the fat; I did not drain the liquid from the onions and chopped the livers with a big blade knife. Both times I added a splash of brandy to the pan. Excellent!! Even the first batch which was a little dry tasted just like Grammie's.

This is almost exactly how I make my Gramma Jenny's chopped liver. The only changes I make is that I saute the livers in the chicken fat, take them out of the pan and do the onions.. no broiler. And I put a tablespoon or two of brandy into the final mixture after I salt and pepper it. You can't really taste it after it's rested in the refrigerator, but it gives a little extra "oomph" to the dish. You may need to re-salt after it's refrigerated. I use a meat grinder to chop everything, just like Mom and Gramma did. I'd give it 4 forks if it had just that little bit of brandy in it. Don't overdo the alcohol.. this is one place where a little more isn't necessarily better.

I didn't have any schmaltz so I substituted bacon fat. It was great. I suppose it's not too kosher but I'm Irish so it's ok.

Yum. Even though I didn't have schmaltz and had to use duck fat, this came out pretty good!

This is real jewish cooking. And my mother cooked it the same way. And she was a polish jew and only cooked jewish. This is the best, four forks are not enough.

I used to buy my chopped liver from a local Jewish bakery but when it changed hands (and the recipe) I decided to try making my own for our Passover seder. I looked over this recipe and the recipe from "Second Helping Please" and asked my mom how her mother made chopped liver. Basically I followed the epicurious recipe but sauteed the livers in the shmaltz with the onions (which is how bubbe made it!). I also thinned the chopped liver with homemade chicken stock (recommended by Second Helpings Please). I used my cuisinart with the metal blade on pulse because I don't have a food grinder. The result was really excellent in terms of flavor and texture. My mother and I think that the only thing that would make this better is a bit more shmaltz. I would like to make this when I get the food grinder attachment for my kitchenaid, but for now this works very well.

The best chopped liver is made with beef liver not with chicken liver. Use fried onions as well as raw onion and a hard boiled egg. Anyone I know that has eaten chicken livers has converted when they tasted my family recipe with beef liver. My husband and I have a very exteneded family with many friends. They will not eat any other chopped liver. When you have the best it is hard to eat the others.

The flavor was delicious. I will make it again but chop the livers a little finer.

This was a first for me, having never eaten chopped liver before. What a pleasant surprise! It was simple to prepare and a real crowd pleaser. As I was pressed for time, I did not chop everything by hand, but using pulse on my food processor chopped the livers coarsely enough that the consistency remained slightly chunky and hearty. This dish is sure to become a staple at my parties and dinner celebrations.

I'm about to make this recipe, which is very close to mine. The difference is that I brown the onions in the schmalz, then cook the livers in the schmalz. I also use a food processer, since my bubbie's wooden bowl and crescent chopper are in my brother's possession. Just pulse to get the right consistency.

Gribenes are the scrumptious cholesterol-laden cracklings left after the chicken fat is rendered--basically crispy bits of browned onion, fat, and chicken skin. As children, we always fought for them after our Mother Lillian Woldman, of blessed memory, made schmaltz every Friday for use in the Shabbes meal--in chopped liver, which she always chopped by hand with a crescent shaped chopper in an ancient wooden bowl, and especially in luscious flaishig mashed potatoes--yummy!

The chicken fat and nayack are used interchangably- for meat/dairy-parve. The chicken fat (schmaltz) must be "rendered". Save the big hunks of fat, and skin. Cook the fat, sliced onions and skin in a small skillet over low heat until the fat is clear and the "gribenes" are brown and crunchy. Strain the schmaltz and refrigerate.

Brown the onion much more than is called for. Adds a much deeper taste.

Nice, but not worth the trouble. Go to Zabar's, or Barney G's, or even Fairway, and you'll find better "livuh" at decent prices.

I couldn't find the schmaltz in the Jewish section but I did find something called Nayafat which was a vegatable product substitute for chicken fat. The recipe was good but perhaps called for too much onion. I would make it again.
