Wow. This was amazingly delicious. I thought at first that the temp was going to be too high, that the meat would be overcooked and dry, but I followed the directions exactly: I made it the day before our Hannukah Dinner, then the day-of, just sliced it, poured the finished sauce over it, covered and re-heated. It was falling apart tender & the sauce is delicious! Well worth the effort. Aunt Marsha even asked for the recipe! I didn't change a thing, and wouldn't.

Made this dish for a dinner party of 20. 8 pound brisket and used 1 1/2 the ingredients. It was excellent! Very high reviews from the crowd. Quarter baby bella mushrooms- they were fantastic and hold up well. I served cream cheese and chive mashed potatoes on the side and it was a marvelous fall feast.

Takes some serious time but it's well worth it!

I have made this several times and always for entertaining and EVERYONE loves it. It is incredibly flavorful, my husband says "off the hook" delicious. I like to make it on a rainy day, definitely let it sit overnight, and then the day you serve it it's so easy. I too use olive oil and not bacon fat. I probably don't use as much liquid as it calls for so I do get a rich gravy. I use a course german mustard and the malt vinegar which definitely makes it POP. So good, and will aways be in my recipe box!

I served this at a German-themed book club meeting last night and everone raved. Yup - it was time-consuming, and I really enjoyed it. I totally recommend it!

This was wonderful-the epitome of "melt in your mouth." This recipe is time consuming, but well worth it. I used considerably more vinegar than called for in the recipe, but "your mileage may vary." It's vitally important to taste test the sauce before serving and adjust seasonings as needed.

Made this for a dinner party with friends. Everyone loved it! It was a little time consuming but many things are so it wasn't that much of a hassle.

I hope my mom is not reading this but here goes... all I wanted was a recipe that matched hers... and I'm afraid to say- this is hands down the best brisket prepared and inhaled by my family and friends. The recipe looks more complicated than it really is- just know that you'll need to be near the stove - but not fully engaged. THE BEST!

This was soooooo delicious! It is a complicated recipe to make because it's time consuming, but my husband who has only recently started adventuring himself in the kitchen, was able to do this with no supervision whatsoever and it came out great! The meat was super tender and tasty... it was well worth the effort!

I made the Oktoberfest menu and while Porter isn't German this was a really great recipe. Time consuming yes but worth it. I had a Jewish guest that said it was the best brisket he had ever had which was a huge compliment!

I only made a 3lb brisket - I followed the recipe exactly, just halved, and it was wonderful. It does take a LOT of time and fiddling, but on the rare chance I'm home and interruptable for that long, I would make it again. Great flavor, ridiculously tender.

Excellent. Despite what seem like untraditional ingredients, it comes out like a traditional brisket. I used first-cut brisket, and it was perfectly tender. So good I made it twice for guests over the holidays.

This was heavenly!!! Don't be put off by the numerous steps (covering, uncovering, turning brisket, etc.). This is a GREAT dinner to make on a lazy day that you plan on spending at home and have the ability to attend to the brisket every few hours as needed. The meat was so tender and flavorful, not dried out at all, and the gravy was divine, very savory and a perfect complement to the meat. I made this exactly according to the recipe, which is somewhat rare for me, but it turned out great and when I make it again, I don't think I would change anything. I prepared as a side dish to this dinner the Mustard-Roasted Potatoes, which was altogether a perfect complement of flavors, in my opinion.

Made this pretty much exactly as written except I didn't have time to do it a full day or two ahead. I made it in the early afternoon, and then reheated it and finished the sauce for dinner. It was fantastic, I'm sure only that much better after it sits a day. It was delicate and succulent. The only change I made at all was to use big sliced portabello mushrooms so the non-mushroom people at the table could easily eat around them and the mushroom lovers could enjoy them. Absolutely my go-to brisket recipe for now on. Yum.

I did not change the ingredients at all, but I was very casual about the cooking time. I was out of the house for awhile so I lowered the oven to 325. Then, I actually fell asleep while it was still baking. I rescued it from the oven at about 2:00 am., having been wakened by a very intense aroma. Although most of the liquid had cooked away, and the vegetables were well past the carmelized stage (heading toward charcoal), it was nevertheless amazing! I added more broth to the pan, along with the vinegar and mustard and it tasted great. I do not recommend this technique - just letting you know that it is a very forgiving recipe that does not require hourly check-ups.

This was so tender it was almost hard to spear with a fork, it was also flavorful and succulent.

I made this for a dinner party last weekend and it was amazing. I liked that you can prepare it a day ahead and finish the dish an hour before serving. We were able to sit on the patio that night and one guest said the Fall air made the meal sensational! I recommend trying this brisket.

While the overall cooking time was long, it wasn't much work, just check in on it every hour or so, turn the brisket, add broth, veggies, etc. I did find that the final product was saltier than I like and while I expected the alcohol to cook off, so did the flavor of the stout which initially lent a nice dimension to the pot. Next time, I will replace some of the broth with water and add a splash more stout toward the end of cooking time.

Although I found the chocolate stout layer cake from this issue to be a bit too "grown up" and not sweet enough for my very sweet tooth, this brisket filled the bill. Made exactly as described, except when it came to boil the liquid and vegies at the end, I skimmed out all of the onions -- that is a LOT onions! The onions invaded the meat to the point where you couldn't even see the meat. So I skimmed it all out and left the carrots, mushrooms, and clear liquid. Heated that up and it was perfect. I will make this again, but I think that 1-2 onions are plenty enough.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was just too over-the-top intensely seasoned and savory for me and my husband. It helped somewhat to serve it with plain boiled potatoes. Plus it was so labor intensive - something to do every hour -- unlike my usual brisket recipe. I always use lower sodium broth, so it wasn't too salty.

Wonderful. I did not add the mustard and vinegar at the end. Next time, I will try that. I would also thicken the sauce a bit. I think I will also try adding more prunes. But overall, just delicious.

Although it takes a long time to make this recipe, it is worth it. Don't be discouraged by the endless covering, uncovering, covering, etc. The result is perfectly succulent. Our dinner guests thought it was blissful. I increased the malt vinegar to three tablespoons and used Bavarian stone ground mustard. There is a large amount of gravy, but I boiled it down a bit before pouring it over the sliced meat.

I really love this recipe. I didn't use as much broth as it called for and it turned out really good. Some of my friends think it was the best dish I made yet!

Delicious! I could not find a good brisket, so I used chuck roast. It substituted perfectly. I used more broth than called for. I made the entire Oktoberfest meal in this Bon Appetit issue, subbing mashed potatoes for German fried potatoes - glad I did, because the gravy and meat were perfect over potatoes.

Being a chef (retired) and using recipes more as a guideline than gospel, I would ask 'a cook' if there was a kosher/dietary consideration we aren't aware of? There was a great balance of the bacon fat with the vinegar used. Also, 'NOT good for you' is a personal thing, less than welcome on such a public forum.

I agree with the opinion that it might not be worth the time it takes to make, but it's perfect for entertaining! I served it to guests and everyone loved it. The meat was tender and flavorful, and I was free to greet guests as they arrived.

Ok so here ya got a bunch of Poker Guys from Texas waiting to see how this Brisket is gonna taste. Now these guys aint a bunch thats real crazy about cookin veggies with the meat so there is some skepticism in the room for sure. But lo and behold if they didnt only love the Brisket, but they was makin Brisket and Veggie sandwiches!! That was some good eatin, but we still favor a good ole Mesquite flavor 12 hour heartattack right off the smoker. This was a great entree for the game indeed.

I just made my first brisket ever using this recipe. It was a huge, huge sucess. The gravy was plentiful and thick, and the flavor was so rich and savory I just kept wanting more. I had to use 3 2-pound cuts of meat which may make a difference.

I made this for my family and it was a huge hit! I accidentally left out the mustard and vinegar and would leave them out if I made it again. I agree with the review of not enough broth, I would add more next time. Absolutely delicious!

Just made this for extended family and there was silence at the table, everyone was enjoying eating so much. Will definitely make again. I substituted rosemary for the sage and used Murphy's stout rather than porter. I also used olive oil, not bacon fat. It definitely took a long time to cook--I started it yesterday and finished it today--but the flavor was rich and worth the wait. My 5 1/2-pound brisket absorbed all of this liquid, so next time I might add a bit more broth. Absolutely perfect fall dinner. Served with red cabbage, mashed potatoes and apple strudel for dessert.

I had just received my Bon Appetit and saw this recipe. I couldn't wait to make it and so I started it yesterday and we had it tonight for dinner. My initial reaction is that while it is very tasty, it is simply not worth the amount of time it takes to cook. I made a 1.8 lb brisket and it took almost 5 hours of bake time - and this did not include the time for prepation. Also - although the picture shows a glazed dish with a seemingly thick gravy, the gravy was very runny - even though I followed all of the directions. If I made it again,I would thicken the gravy before heating the slices of brisket. This recipe took far more work and trouble than it's worth - a french pot roast is just as tasty but take a lot less cooking time.
