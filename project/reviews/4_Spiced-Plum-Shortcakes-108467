I made this tonight and it was so easy- 45 minutes max start to finish! I used 5 pluots and 10 or so cherries for the fruit part, and the pluots were were delicious cooked. I will definitely make this again.

The "shortcakes" are really more like biscuits. The biscuits by themselves are ok--very scone like. Husband said he could taste the baking powder...I would consider using self rising flour next time (and cutting the bp). The biscuits are significantly better with the plums and sauce. The plums have a nice slightly sweet but tart flavor. Not a ton of sauce just enough to sufficiently coat the plums. Made the biscuits in the food processor. Much easier to pulse in the butter, transfer to a bowl and then add 1/2 and 1/2 and knead. Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Spiced-Plum-Shortcakes-108467#ixzz0oyp5QLM7

This was easy to make and absolutely delicious. When the plums on my tree are ripe next year, I'll make it again.

Easy, showy, and very, very good, especially for fall. The ginger makes it special. My guests were not overly excited to hear about plums but are now big fans. They gave it rave reviews and all thought it was a complicated dessert, just what I like!
