So good! Very lush and creamy. I added some parmesan to the top to get it a little browner and add a more sharp cheesy flavor. I also added more garlic than called for. If I made it again I would probably not use shiitakes because they remained a little to firm.

made just a couple changes. sauteed crimini, shiitake and porcini mushrooms in bacon fat seasoned with shallots, garlic and rosemary. also left the skin on the russets. so good. seriously.

Rating: 4
Rich, delicious gratin. I've made this several times and always get rave reviews. May be made without the mushrooms, but the russet potatoes are a must, as opposed to white or red, due to the starch content. I have also added onions or shallots a time or two, though I have to say I like the shallots better, but it's not necessary.

It was definitely tasty. Added some thyme to the recipe as well. The cream was delicious, but I honestly didn't care for the potatoes. This made basically a mushroom/potato alfredo. Every time I took a bite I thought about how much more I would enjoy this sauce over some pasta instead of with the potatoes. We did get several positive comments on this, though...including (surprisingly) from someone who doesn't like mushrooms??

I didn't have high expectations, but really, how could anything cooked in cream not be good? The mushroom mix added a nice earthiness and the Gruyere was a perfect topping. I cut my Yukon Gold potato slices a bit thick, so I boiled them in salted water almost to tenderness, drained them and placed in the baking dish, then covered with the cream/milk mixture. I baked for 45 minutes, removed from oven and let stand at room temp for about two hours, then reheated for about 15 minutes while I was roasting a tenderloin. The sauce was perfect and the flavor had a lot of depth. Our mushroom-loving friend ate thirds. Too rich for us to eat regularly but a nice holiday treat.

Really fairly simple and tasted great. there was no wow factor keeping it from 4 forks.

I made this for Easter dinner (as a change from simple mashed potatoes) and was surprised that the prep was not nearly as difficult as I had anticipated. This is excellent fresh out of the oven with extra cheese within and on top (gruyere, yum); however, the leftovers fell short. Overall, this recipe was very good and I loved the way the flavors combined.

Sorry, meant cremini, not porcini.

Excellent and easy gratin. Used baby portobellos instead of crimini.

This potato dish is really nice. The spiced cream compilements the mushrooms very well and the gruyere is the piece de la resistance. Doesn't get to four forks only because those are reserved for dishes that make people say "wow" and this didn't. But I'd make it again in a heartbeat.

Rating: 0
Excellent taste. I did not rate, because I did not follow the directions exactly. I used Swiss cheese (on hand) and plain old mushrooms (also on hand). I will try again with better mushrooms and the Gruyere. I also think it was almost better the next day with the addition of a little cream to "loosen it up". This is company-worthy for certain. Lovely dish.

I made this over New Year's and it was met with rave reviews - even by someone who doesn't like mushrooms! Also, to save time, I made it ahead, took it out of the oven 10 minutes early, then placed it back in right before dinner. Will make this again and again.

I have made this a couple of times. This dish is always a hit. Even the day after. I don't know how long the Cook from Vancouver cooked the potatoes, you are supposed to just bring them to a boil and then remove them from heat.

This dish has a wonderful flavor, but next time I will skip step two (precooking the potatoes in the cream made a scorched mess of my pot!) I think the same result could be achieved by making a simple white sauce to layer with the other ingredients with way less stress. I was able to rescue the ingredients but it was a close call and a real challenge to clean up the pot! If I make it again I will change the method for sure.

Made this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner, it was a hit! I used 50-50 baby bella and shitake mushroom instead, added dried thyme afer the grated cheese and also added powder mushroom buillon in the liquid while boiling. Ah, it smeels wonderful. Don't forget to add more cheese too!

This was a lot more work than I thought it would be -- the 2 hour prep time turned into more like three but the end result was worth it. For the chopped shittakes, I used the food processor to ensure that they would cook through and it worked great. I also added a bit of parmesan with the gruyere. Overall, a terrific result - my guests -- a picky bunch -- raved!

family went crazy over this recipe. make it ahead! it only gets better with age! You can play with the mushroom mix, but one cautionary note - don't sub in dried shiitakes, unless you're sure to VERY carefully cut out any tougher parts of the shiitakes, they wind up very chewy in the finished product, but then again, maybe no one else noticed.

I made this for our family Christmas Eve dinner to such rave reviews that I made it again last night for our New Year's Eve dinner party. A definite keeper - my husband affectionately refers to this dish as "Potatoes Alfredo"!

Oh yum yum yum! I've never made a potato gratin before, this was really good! As did another reviewer, I substituted 1 1/2 c. low-fat sour cream for the heavy cream -- was still delicious with a nice tang. A nice side to our Christmas dinner.

Oh, my gosh. Incredibly rich and yummy. Served with lamb racks, sauteed spinach and garlic, and sweet potato chips. Our guests were properly impressed. I did use all cream as one reviewer suggested-way creamier. Used the shiitake, oyster, and button shrooms and Yukon gold taters. Only the second recipe I have ever given 4 forks!

This recipe was extremely good. I made it for a small group of people. Even the 10 and 13 year old picky eaters thought this was tasty. This one gets saved to my recipe box to be made over and over again. I should say as well that I increased the potatoes to 5 lbs for the group and added a little extra of everything else. Very easy recipe to scale up or down to your needs.

This was really excellent. I usually struggle with gratin recipes--the potatoes don't cook or the flavor doesn't meet my expectations. This, however, was great. Great flavor and texture. I couldn't get my hands on interesting mushrooms, so I just used plain buttom mushrooms, but we still loved it. So, I can't wait to see what great mushrooms would do for this dish.

Eh--an unsatisfactory ratio of kitchen mess to yumminess. It wasn't awful but it wasn't great either. Made this as directed with creminis and shitakes ($10/lb vs $25 for chanterelles). The mushrooms didn't add anything particularly delicious to the recipe. And the quantity overwhelmed my gratin dish (precisely the size specified) leading to a smoky, drippy mess on the floor of my oven.

Served this for Christmas dinner with ham. Made half without mushrooms for the non-mushroom eaters. It was the best gratin recipe ever. Had to substitute emmentaler as my market was out of gruyere.

Scrumptious!! And simple to make. The first time I doubled the recipe and served it for potluck after church. Everyone loved it! The second time I made it was better than the first, as I did a little modification. The original recipe is a bit salty, so I reduced the salt by 1/2 tsp. I also substituted 2 c. whipping cream for the heavy cream and milk. The first time, I also tried to mix the Gruyere cheese with mild cheddar; they didn't blend well. So my modifications are: 1 tsp salt, 2 c whipping cream, and use 1 1/2 cups Gruyere cheese. I served the second edition when I met my boyfriend's family for the first time last weekend. Everyone raved about it! Thank-you Epicurious!

This is an excellent recipe - a great hit at a recent dinner party. I tried making portions using a 4" diameter cookie cutter as suggested by an other review, but found that this was too large a portion and the mushrooms slipped out. Also I used 4 # potatoes since the LeCrusset pan I was using was rectangular rather than oval and I didn't have enough potatoes to cover the mushrooms. I highly recommend this recipt.

Rating: 4
I made this last night to rave reviews -- oh, was it good. I used chanterelles, cremini and button mushrooms, but really you could get away with just button mushrooms because you're basically making duxelles, which uses up whatever is lying around. In fact, I usually have some frozen, which would save some prep time. Fantastic -- in fact, the leftovers are calling me now.

What a hit!! The flavor of this dish was perfect and not to heavy. It is also very easy. I served it with a rack of lamb and fresh green beans and didn't change a thing. Enjoy!

The mix of mushrooms really adds to this basic gratin. Before sauteeing the shroons, saute minced leeks and set aside to add later. I also added fresh basil, thyme and a little rosemary toward the end, and added more gruyere and the fabulous Cougar Gold cheddar cheese. Baked the whole thing in a clay pot cooker; it was delicious next to oven fried buttermilk chicken and chioggia beets in a raspberry vinaigrette.

Fabulous flavor. The only problem I had was getting the servings out of the gratin dish. They wanted to fall apart at the mushroom layer. I used 2% milk instead of cream and whole milk and I used extra cheese and garlic..

Yum, Yum! I have made this several times and it's always wonderful and super easy! The last time I made it, I really simplified the recipe - used just 2 c. whipping cream, 1.5 t. salt and about 1 t. black pepper for the sauce; used Yukon gold potatoes, which I sliced and threw in the dish, layering with mushrooms, then poured the cream over the top. Baked covered 45 min, then set aside till dinner time- Uncovered andbaked about 30 minutes since the potatoes were at room temperature by then. FABULOUS and even easier!

Second time making this dish but wanted to try the sauce over cauliflower for a lower carb version. It was fab again! I chopped up cauliflower (did not precook in cream) placed it in the baking dish, topped with sauce and baked till brown and bubbly. Very yummy and our friends loved it. Didn't pour all the sauce onto cauliflower but plan to reheat sauce add a little wine and toss with pasta. The sauce is very versitale and makes any dish delicious.

This was alright, but just "alright". The mushrooms completely overpowered the dish. In fact, the end result was "gray" from the liquor from the mushrooms (even though I sauteed them the specified time); not a particularly appealing presentation. I meticulously followed the instructions, as I always wish to rate the actual recipe instead of some other formulation (I take that back, I only baked it for 32 minutes as it was definitely done and would have burned at 45-55 minutes). On a positive note, the consistency was ideal. The last gratin I made was curdly and watery. This was creamy and just right. The gruyere cheese was phenomenal. I will experiment with this and try to find the right combo of ingredients for us (plain ole cheese gratin?). At any rate, it's fun to try a new recipe. Thank you Epicurious. Maplegirl

Made this for Easter dinner and it was a big hit. I let the cream mixture simmer on the stovetop a few minutes longer to thicken it a little before combining and putting in the oven. Added a layer of grated cheese in the middle as others suggested and it was perfect. Feeds a crowd, will absolutely make this again!

This dish is wonderful. I made it for Easter and everyone was raving for it. I used shallots instead of garlic and found fresh porcinis at me local market and the flavor was unbelievable. I agree with the others it is best with more mushrooms than they specify.

We also served this with a rib roast at Christmas dinner and it was fabulous and a fabulous combination. I increased the garlic and cheese and assembled the gratin in more layers as suggested in earlier reviews. I only had a deep 3 qt. dish and did have problems with bubbling over, but it wasn't a catastrophe. I will definitely make this again, especially when I'm hoping to please vegetarians without completely orienting my menu that way.

Made this for Christmas dinner, everyone loved it. I found the potatoes to be slightly undercooked, even though I sliced them ultra thin in the cuisinart AND I probably overcooked them in the cream before baking. Due to limited oven space for 5 dishes, I cooked the gratin 3 hours before dinner, and it stayed warm while covered. I used Cremini and Shitaake mushrooms.

Everyone asked for recipe when I served with our Rib Roast Christmas dinner and thankfully all I had to do was email from site. Very delicious. I did not pour in all the cream sauce into the serving/baking dish due to complaints of it bubbling out.

Fantastic. Made this for Christmas Eve dinner for 12 people, so I increased the potatoes to 6 lbs, and increased the milk and cream to 2 1/4 cups each. Also added a half pound each of chanterelles and shiitake and increased the amount of cremini mushrooms to 1 pound. This recipe was a perfect match for beef tenderloin, and the mushrooms made it different from your usual scalloped potato recipe.

Really delicious. Heating the potatoes and cream in a pot gives them a good head start and helps to speed up the baking time. Check for doneness after 30 minutes; you might not need to bake this for the full amount of time stated.

Made this dish with a crown pork roast for Easter and it was absolutely fantastic. One of the best and easiest recipes I've tried in a long time. Everyone loved it. Not one critic in the bunch. I couldn't find fresh wild mushrooms in my local supermarket, so I bought dried exotic mushrooms and simmer them for twenty min.(package directions) and along with the cremini they worked as well. A DEFINITE keeper!!!!!!!

This dish was wonderful with rack of lamb. The wild mushrooms gave the potatoes a unique and delightful flavor. The only change I made, when making this dish for the second time, was to use 3 cups of heavy cream rather than the milk and cream that was called for in the original recipe. It was, of course, much creamier and almost decadent! The Gruyere cheese was a perfect topping with the flavor enhanced by the touch of nutmeg in the cream sauce. While preparing the rack of lamb, we let the potato dish sit in a warm (not hot) oven for 30 minutes, and it set up perfectly for slicing into squares. Room temperature would have also been okay - as we found out when eating the small bit of leftovers!

Rating: 4
This was so delicious! I made some additions to my recipe as well--I added some fresh thyme into the cream, some minced shallots into the mushroom mixture as well as extra garlic. I also used a regular aged swiss instead of the gruyere as my market did not have any, and it was still wonderful (and much cheaper!) Definitely a keeper.

I made this for Christmas with a few changes on the advice of previous reviewers. It was excellent, although I think it could use more salt and more garlic. I doubled the amount of cheese and sprinkled in on the first layer as well as the top. I used a mixture of portobello, cremini, shitake and oyster mushrooms, but I think using all cremini would be fine - you couldn't taste the difference. I also used Yukon gold potatoes, but I think russets would have been better - the golds didn't get soft and soak up the sauce the way the russets would. Overall, a good dish and a nice change from traditional scalloped potatoes.

I cut the recipe in half and it was simply delicious. I used portobellos instead of creminis only because I had them on hand and didn't want to run out to the store. I didn't see the previous reviewer's comment about adding more cheese to the first layer, but I do like that idea and will try it next time. My husband and I both thought this "company worthy" and will certainly make it again and again.

This is superb and particularly wonderful with the herb crusted rack of lamb. My husband and I made both for our "wine group" (red wine lovers, of course) and it was a hit! We followed instructions with only one change--we added Gruyere to the first layer as well as the top. We'll make this again...and again. Thanks for providing.
