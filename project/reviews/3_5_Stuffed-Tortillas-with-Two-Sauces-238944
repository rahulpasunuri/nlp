Absolutely fantastic! This recipe does take quite some work but is well worth it. I couldn't find epazote leaves so I used oregano instead. Be sure to cover your blender with a kitchen towel to avoid the hot liquid splattering in your face. And the roasted tomatoes added so much flavor to the sauce.

I tripled this and made it for a group of 15 (carnivores) to rave reviews. The crisp tortillas matched the veggie filling, made wonderfully creamy as the egg yold dissolved a bit -- and 2 sauces was a great combo. Probably didn't need triple the sauces -- there was leftover -- but it looks like they'll freeze for later use. On the pumpkin seed sauce -- recommend grinding the seeds in a food processor until smooth, then adding hot liquid to avoid spattering.

Aside from the fact that in preparation for the seed sauce my blender blew up, spewing hot liquid in my face, this dish was delightful. The tomatoe sauce compliments the creamy/crunchy filling for the tortillas.

This was a lot of work and was only sort of good. I should have known when my blender blew its stack making the green sauce that this wasn't going to go well. The tomato sauce was very tasty, and the egg and zucchini filling was tasty. All together, though, I didn't care for it. I left the dish on the counter when I was cleaning out the fridge a few days later. My cats tag-teamed it - one ate the tortillas while the other ate the egg filling. It didn't go to waste, but I can think of easier ways to feed my cats.
