Very easy and quick to make -- love the fresh but filling tastes. I dipped the cabbage wraps into lime juice and it helped the flavors pop -- otherwise I did everything pretty much as describes in the recipe.

I used this recipe as a base. I sauteed everything, starting with shallots, then garlic, then added some mushrooms, bean sprouts instead of cabbage, and chopped water chestnuts for crunch. Served in letuce cups with peanut, sriracha, and hot mustard sauces. Husband loved, and me too!

i followed the lettuce wrap idea and it ended up being a solid healthy meal for a reasonable price (thanks for the suggestion). i added some minced ginger and chopped peanuts to the pork mixture for extra texture and flavor. I also julienned green mango and carrots to add some color and more veg. i don't know as i would say it's amazing but it was quite tasty and i will def make it again.

This is best when you use butter, bibb or Boston lettuce to make wraps. Add bean sprouts for a nice crunch. Serve with Thai dipping sauce (boil 1 c sugar, 1/2 c water, 1/2 c white vinegar 5 mins; reduce heat and stir in 2T chopped garlic, 2T fish sauce, 1.5t Chinese chili sauce; cool & add 1/4 c shredded carrot and 2T lime juice). YUMMMMMM

Surprisingly easy. Subbed Turkey for the pork and browned it instead of boiling and straining it. A true crowd pleaser I have now made this for a birthday party and a dinner party and both times it was eaten to the last crumb.

So much flavor for very little effort. Followed the recipe pretty exactly but added a red chili too.

This is one of our family's favorite recipes for an oriental themed dinner night. For simplicity's sake we skip the mint and bread crumbs and substitute a small red onion for the shallots. Then served over Iceberg lettuce. We haven't had bad review yet from our kids nor any guest who's sampled it. I suspect the main difficulties experienced by others could be remedied by exercising care to not overcook the pork and adding extra lime juice and fish sauce when ready to serve it.

I love this recipe but my husband is bananas over it! I use Belgian endives instead of the cabbage and add Cholula hot sauce to the mix then serve the whole thing over salad with grape tomatos and green beans. (I also skip the fish sauce.)

This is a great, refreshing recipe. I used Napa cabbage instead, and I love the fresh crispness the cabbage gives. I added extra lime juice, and think it was great. Lots of fresh mint and cilantro really give it great flavor. Next time I'll serve it with a plum or other kind of sauce to top individually at the table to give it a little zing.

Not worth the effort. Followed the recipie exactly and it came out bland and dry, even after adding some rice vinegar as suggested. The cabbage was thick and dry, even tried to quick blanch it but that changed the taste. This salad also is need of side accompaniments such as sliced cucumber and carrots with a hoisin sauce to even remotely consider making it again.

I tried something different with these. I followed the earlier directions(more liquid, browned rice powder, ginger slivers), but then I used dumpling sheets to make half of the recipe, cabbage leaves for the rest of the recipe. I also served with a Maple Chipotle sauce that was very nice. I will definetely make these again.

This was very good and easy to make. I chopped the cabbage and mixed it into the salad. I used about six TBS of lime juice instead of four. I used toasted whole wheat Panko break crumbs. And if you add a little rice wine vinegar - just a little - it adds some zing.

I replaced the pork with firm tofu to make it vegetarian, and it worked equally well.

Very good and simple to prepare. I also served with lettuce. Also, I used 16 oz of pork with the same amount of fish sauce indicated. I would use less next time and serve with a sauce. This dish was DEVOURED!

Very, very good. I also used toasted ground rice instead of breadcrumbs - better flavour. Additionally, I substituted cubed pork tenderloin for the ground because I had it on hand. I love the blend of lime and fish sauce.

my husband and I both liked this a lot. I used breakfast sausage (want I had on hand) reallly good. I added the gingered and served in butter lettuce leafs. Delicious

This was a very tasty dish, but the cabbage leaves were a little too heavy for this dish. Next time I would choose lettuce over cabbage. I would also look for a chili-type sauce to serve this with, similar to the sause offered at PF Chang's, as the dish was otherwise dry. The taste was great, however...just a little dry. Will definitely make again with a few modifications.

overall, this isn't a very bad recipe, but it is not authentic thai or laotian laab moo (i spent six months in thailand and laos and had this dish almost everyday all over the countries!) you definitely want to substitute the bread crumbs with toasted rice (just toast the uncooked rice in a hot pan and then grind in a coffee grinder for a few seconds.) you should also add some red chili flakes and adjust the lime juice and fish sauce to taste. also, try serving uncooked chilled long beans with the cabbage (especially on hot days!)

It's not "authentic", but this recipe works with leftover roast pork, too, and fits into a low-carb diet if you use sesame seeds instead of bread crumbs or rice. Note that you don't need a whole bunch of mint or cilantro, just two T of each, chopped. Cube the roast pork (I used tenderloin) in tiny cubes, mix with cabbage (or chopped celery), onions, mint and cilantro. Mix rice vinegar, fish sauce, sesame oil, chopped ginger, and lime juice. Toast some sesame seeds and add to dressing, then toss with pork. It's good cold.

I very much agree with the suggestion to add ginger. I also substituted basil for the cilantro as one guest didn't like cilantro (at all). It's easy and flavorful.

There are too many decent thai restaurants around here for me to take on such a feat as this meal. It wasn't horrible. But for what I got, I would rather go out to eat. Maybe a better cook could do this meal justice.

The recipe is great with the exception of the bread crumbs. Crushed uncooked rice (rice powder) makes a more authentic "larb." Otherwise this is one of my favorite dishes, and I've served it regularly with great success.

I made this for my friends and everyone loved it. Instead of bread crumbs, I added roasted rice powder. I think this helps to keep the juices in the dish. Simple to make and tasty!

The recipe is a little bit strange from mine. I do not call this "LARB" coz one important ingredient is missing. Take uncooked rice, fry it in hot pan(just hot pan), then when it begins brown, take it out. Grind the rice. Put this sand rice in the dish after you got all thing. Am I right?

This dish turned out to be a winner after following the advice from other reviewers to up the liquid, shred the cabbage, and add ginger (used pureed, but the julienned would have been nicer). I also did some of my own doctoring and added rice vinegar (seasoned) and chopped peanuts. The flavors were really authentic and this was so easy!

This was a great first course for my Thai lunch. I used about 1/2 the crumbs called for and added about 1 1/2 tablespoon short juliened ginger. I think the ginger sent it to 4 stars.

This is such a great combo of flavors. Instead of using the big slices of cabbage I chopped it up and tossed it with the entire salad and served it over rice. So good. Will make this again and again.

Called "Larb" this recipe doesn't yield quite enough "sauce" like you might get in a restaurant, so add a bit more rice vinegar and fish sauce. Avoid bread crumb. Roasted rice is the thai way. Quite refreshing for lunch.

Very delicious, easy and fast for us. We LOVE Thai food and this dish uses a minimum of ingredients while retaining a true Thai flavor!

Although this recipe is good, I prefer Larb Chicken Salad (another salad wrap Epicurious recipe). It has similar ingredients, but the lemon grass, limes and shallots give it a boost. Try it, it's excellent.

Yummy!but I also agree with Mr.Powell.It's better with ground rice.Toasted it's even better.

I have made this recipe with ground chicken and ground turkey, and both ways turn out excellently. I find this dish very tasty, especially when I kick up the cayenne to 1/4 tsp. The presentation is lovely; tucking in the whole sprigs of mint and cilantro enhances the eating experience.

This is very close in texture and flavor to nam sod without peanuts. I have made it several times and like the substitution of ground rice for bread crumbs.

Wonderful! I dropped the cabbage into boiling water and peeled off individuals leaves, in which we wrapped the pork mixture.

Really good, quick, easy, and can be made in advance. Well worth trying. Note that although the ingredients list calls for cilantro roots, the recipe does not use them!
