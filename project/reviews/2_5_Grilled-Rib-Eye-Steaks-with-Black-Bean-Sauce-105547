LOL! Stale socks, that's a new one. Asian black beans are NOTHING like the black beans used in other cooking, like southwestern fare...my wife & I love this recipe, and I generally don't change a thing, although I've used rice vinegar instead of lemon juice sometimes, and I've also used a couple of tablespoons of prepared black bean garlic sauce (it comes out pretty good this way). The favorite, though, is using real fermented black beans, bought at an asian market. I disagree the sauce is too rich, it is perfect; however, it is very flavorful, and can fully support a great cut of beef, like a New York steak. Yum!

To those who do not know, Black Bean should not taste or smell like bad socks. If it does, it turned bad. When possible, buy Chiu or Guangzhou bean sauce, it keeps better and is not preserved in Vinegar. This recipe is great, but lacks a sort of common sense article to those whom are unfamiliar with Chinese/Asian cuisine.

This is a keeper. I substituted one table spoon of a purchased "black bean garlic sauce" for the fermented black beans and it turned out great. Will bring back again.

I haven't made this recipe exactly, but thought the sauce will go nicely with pasta...and it was pretty good. I reduced the amount of butter and omitted flour to lighten it.

I must have done something seriously wrong--at least I hope so. Finally found the black beans at an Asian market. However, even after soaking and rinsing the beans several times, the smell of dirty, stale socks was overwhelming. Cooking didn't do much to help the situation, and the sauce had a nauseating dirty, stale aftertaste. These black beans bore no resemblance whatsoever to the black beans I know and love. What happened?

Everyone at dinner the other night enjoyed this dish. The cream together with butter make the sauce unnecessarily rich, masking the fermented black bean a little, so I'll use half and half next time, and cut back on the butter a little. Otherwise outstanding!
