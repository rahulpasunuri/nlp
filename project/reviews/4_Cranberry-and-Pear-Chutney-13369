This has been a Thanksgiving staple, on our table and others we've visited, since it was first published in 1991. I up the sugar a little (after it cooks down and I can taste it) and I cook it a bit longer than the recipe calls for, as I prefer a bit softer chutney, but otherwise, it's perfect. Best made a few days ahead and lasts a long time in the fridge. Can't wait to use it for turkey sandwiches and it's also good with ham and pork chops/roasts.

I love chutney and savory cranberry sauces, so this is delicious. I couldn't find my grater so I substituted a few tablespoons of fresh lemon juice. Also added a bit of dried ginger because I didn't have enough fresh, and I think the combination worked well. Left out the raisins too. I will make this for Thanksgiving for sure.

Make at least a day or two ahead to allow the flavors to mellow and meld. I was worried this would be too harsh for my guests when I tasted it warm,after a day in the fridge, it was the perfect balance of tangy and sweet.

This is very good. It fills my need for something a little less sweet to go with the over-abundance of sweets served at holiday meals. Have been making it for years. Looked-up the recipe today for a friend who asked if I have a good chutney recipe.

Um... I just have to say that this is one of the best things I have ever tasted...I made it as stated by the recipe and I just finished it. It's still warm and it's amazing. I can't wait to taste it in a couple of days when the flavors all have time to meld.

Warm, spicy, tangy and a great meat accompaniment. What a non-ordinary way to add a condiment to your table. I don't get some of the substitutions like white sugar or black pepper. The richness of the red pepper and the depth of flavor with brown sugar really add to this recipe. The has become a standard in our house.

This was a wonderful recipe (as a personal preference I did leave out the raisins). I have used it cooked on a baked brie and it was a huge hit. It is also great served cold with meats. Stores well in fridge as stated in recipe. I already have plans to make it again for a holiday party!

This recipe is very good if you make a few changes. First, use regular white sugar instead of brown. Second, use candied ginger instead of fresh. Third, use grated orange peel instead of lemon. Eliminate the hot pepper flakes and use freshly ground black pepper instead, this gives more floral aroma and less intrusive heat. Eliminate the mustard seed and vinegar and substitute a teaspoon of regular yellow mustard instead. You may also substitute dried cherries or apricots instead of raisins. Follow these tips and this recipe is a winner!!!

This has been our preferred cranberry accompaniment for Thanksgiving since it first appeared in 1991. Quick, delicious, and easy to do ahead and allow to mellow in the fridge for a week or more. Our guests are always delightfully surprised by something other than the rimmed cylinder of Ocean Spray. In making today's batch, I used a full 16 ounces of cranberries and a mixture of light brown sugar with a bit of maple syrup, as I was out of dark brown sugar. No other changes - it came out just fine.

This is practically identical to a better one from Bon Appetit that did not call for fresh gingerroot, but instead used ground ginger. I am still looking for this earlier/other version, but can remember it well enough from this. In the one I am looking for, you add the pears after cooking and cooling slightly, which leaves the pears more recognizable and better. I must have given away the last of my many copies, for I have made this for years, and always get requests for the recipe.

I've made this for every Xmas and Thanksgiving dinner for the last few years. And I get requests to bring it to other people's dinners all the time. It's so much more complex and special than regular cranberry sauce. And it's not that much more work than opening a can of commercial sauce. Everything just simmers in a pot. Super easy.

This is a new family favorite that has taken the place of the traditional cranberry gelatin-like crap that we used to serve at Thanksgiving.

This has become a staple for both my husband's and my family Thankgiving and Christmas meals!

This is awful. Just made it as a do-ahead and freeze item for Thanksgiving. Glad I did so I can do something else. The gingerroot is so overpoweringly bitter. I added lots of sugar but couldn't salvage it.

Just the right amount of sweet and spice with a hint of warmth. The perfect complement to holiday meals. No more plain cranberry sauce for my family and friends!

This is the 6th year making this chutney. I fill small jars to give as Holiday gifts...it's great with pork chops and chicken.

I made this for my family for Thanksgiving last year, and it's now replaced our traditional cranberry sauce (with celery and almonds)-- Really good! Add walnuts for a crunchy twist.

This is a perfect accompaniment to many entrees, not just turkey. It's a supporting player that often steals the show from the star with its wonderfully balanced sweet/tart/piquant flavors.

A little too much ginger for me. try cutting it back by 1/2

Great cranberry chutney with a spicey, sweet complex flavor. I've served it three years in a row for Thanksgiving turkey dinner to rave reviews.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and was very tart. Added 1/2 cup more brown sugar and it was okay. Flavors did not harmonize well. I usually have to play with most recipes but this one was bad to begin with. I am curious how there are such good reviews! Epicurious please look at this one again.

I make this every year for Thanksgiving. Simply awesome.

I must have done something wrong because this was HORRIBLE! I tried to tell myself that I liked it but I couldn't stomach it. I couldn't get over the vinegar and I love vinegar. I will try it again because everyone else raved about it and it is very possible that i made it wrong.

If you like sweet and sour-spicy relishes, this is a good one.

Great recipe. I've used this for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners since it was published. Practically no-fail preparation and can stand a fair amount of modification, I have substituted apples for pears on occasion, Penzey's dried gingerroot for fresh, raisins and currants for raisins. Perfect with turkey and dressing.

Our family just loves this for our cranberry dish! This will be the 3rd year that I have made it. The flavor is wonderful and just the right amount of spice to give zip to our holiday table. My daughter-in-law plans on making a few batches of it to give as hostess gifts this year.

I've been making this chutney at least once a year since the recipe came out in the early 90's. No more cranberry-and-orange sauce for me! Even my fuddy-duddy Dad looks forward to it on the Christmas table. When cranberries are out of season, I use fresh sour cherries, which work nicely.

A friend of mine described this as "outta control." I had to multiply the recipe by 1.5 to accommodate a crowd, so I used dried cranberries for the extra six ounces and added a tad more vinegar and some water to keep the moisture right. I also substituted crystallized ginger for the fresh. Really great with poultry.

Good as far as chutneys go... my family liked it more than me. I thought it was a tad spicy so I added more brown sugar. The pears are a nice addition of flavor and texture. I might add more raisins because you can't see or taste them. If you're looking for something like traditional cranberry sauce, this is not it. This one has a distinct personality of its own.
