This sauce is awesome. It's really spicy but also really tasty. We doubled the recipe which worked great. To cut the spiciness we ended up adding one extra avocado. Even our 4 year old gabbled it down. Yum!

I altered this as I don't like spicy food. I added no peppers, and added and extra 1/4 cup saute'd sweet onion in addition to the raw. I also added 1 tbls of water instead of 1/4 cup as we wanted to use left overs for chips. We really enjoyed the strong citrus flavor of this guac and smooth texture. The sauted onions added a nice hint of sweetness.

It's so simple to make and so incredibly tasty! The most time and effort is spent finding the fresh ingredients, but it's worth it. I finely chopped all my ingredients without the help of a food processor and it still turned out great.

I added tomato and garlic to this and cut out the water and it was delicious!

I thought this was really great and a nice change from the Mexican guacamole I usually make. Will definitely make it again.

I quintupled this recipe as I did it for a party of 30 (flank steak was served). While I think it is good as an accompianment to the flank steak recipe, I wouldn't suggest it as a stand-alone guac. It finishes with quite a burn, akin to Hee-Haw when they hit in the rear with a board. I added plain yogurt in lieu of water to take some of the burn off it. But as a nice, smooth sauce for the meat, it was perfect. Don't mess with it too much. I think they are calling it guac because it has avocados. It was not meant to be traditional or served at a beer bash.

This was very good and easy to make. Not as good as the Mermaid Cafe's (in Westerly RI) guacamole recipe though

I usually make my own tried and true guac recipe from scratch--standard flavors and chunky. This is a delicious alternative that I used with the marinated flank steak. It was absolutely yummy. Whip it together and let the flavors blend for 30-60 minutes in the frig. I also leave the avocado nuts in to help keep the guac green. This recipe was still good after a week!

Loved it! I followed the advice not to add water. I added a tbs of aji instead of chiles.

great recipe! I omitted the water and added an extra small avocado, and lime juice because I was scared it was going to be too runny.. overall an excellent recipe! I've made it three times in the last week

My husband is from Cali, Colombia and he grew up with his family not adding any hot chiles or water. So we omitted this and used the sweet maui for the onion. Excellent!

If you want to use it as a dip, just use a fork instead of the procesor to get a better texture and don't put any water!

I have lived in colombia for 33 years and do not ANYBODY who puts water in their guacamole,otherwise it is basically the way we make it here. My daughter is famous for her guacamole, but of course it is the only thing she can make!!

Great as a sauce for the flank steak, but I wouldn't make it as a guacamole for dipping. Either way, add the water slowly to make sure it doesn't get too runny - or have an extra avocado on hand to thicken it a bit. Don't be afraid of salt and lime juice, and it'll all turn out ok!
