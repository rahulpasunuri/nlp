I used to live in the UK, and Korma is a very popular restaurant dish, so I was excited to make it. I used chicken instead of lamb, and it was delicious. I would definitely OMIT the cream at the end. I was tasting it through the whole process, and was very pleased with just the yogurt flavour, but after I added the cream it took on almost a cheese-like flavour. My boyfriend loved that but I had been spoiled by pre-tasting. Served with spinach naan.

Made with 300 gr lamb, black pepper instead of white, but otherwise followed the recipe. Had to grind nuts in a mortar & pestle & that was a killer. It tasted very good, but strangely like Thai food instead of Indian...
