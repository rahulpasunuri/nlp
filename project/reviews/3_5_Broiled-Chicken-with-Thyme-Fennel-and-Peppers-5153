Grilled skinless chicken breast and veggies, both came out very well. Chicken was nice and moist.

Great recipe. I made the vegetables and the chicken on the grill. My only complaint is I wish they had specified skin on boneless chicken in the listing of ingredients rather than waiting until the instructions to mention that I needed the ones with skin.

I love this recipe as it is, and I have made it several times over the past five years, but I have changed a few things about it. I no longer drizzle the veggies with butter, but instead mix them with some additional lemon zest (I zest an entire lemon for the recipe now). And for the chicken, I use boneless and skinless chicken, which I coat with salt, pepper, and another 3 tsp of fresh thyme, and then brown and cook in a skillet with the butter and an additional tbsp of olive oil. I deglaze the pan with the juice from the lemon, add 1/2 cup Pernod and any remaining lemon zest, and boil it down to a sauce. Then I serve the sauce over the chicken with the fennel bulb and peppers. That way the chicken and veggies can be done at the same time without waiting for the broiler. (Then the left over fennel fronds go into a fennel pesto recipe I found (http://www.recipeinterrupted.com/blog/2010/03/recipe-penne-with-fennel-pesto.html), because I just hate to have any waste from a recipe.)

This was very good done in a frying pan. Used large, frozen breasts; Browned the chicken, then Sauted/braised the veggies with the chicken for 15-20 minutes, adding a little white wine to steam and tenderize. Hubby loved it, and no pounding or broiler mess.

I have been trying our different chicken breast recipes and this one is the best. I used boneless skinless breasts and I did use butter and not the olive oil because my husband is not fond of olive oil. He actually said it was delicious. I made the recipe with white bonelss fish fillets instead of chicken for myself as I don't care for chicken and it was scrumptious! I used a little more fresh thyme than it called for and this made it tastier.

Warm goat cheese salad aside, I listened to the SF/Boston cook below. The farmers market had beautiful fennel bulbs this weekend, so I tried this recipe for a change. Used whole spilt chickens instead of chicken breasts, but made the fennel/red peppers per the recipe. Also used lemon on the chicken and did not use butter either. EV olive oil did the trick! For an easy simple Sunday dinner, go for this! I served pasta with a simple tomato sauce, Italian bread and a simple green salad.

This is great...and easy too. It was a big hit at a dinner party. I actually used extra virgin olive oil instead of the butter since I had a special oil we brought back from Provence. I served this with a tomato and zucchini gratin and a warm goat cheese salad (cliche, I know but always a hit)
