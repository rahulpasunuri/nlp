This was outstanding. Sauce was prepared just as directed,and I used fresh steamed shrimp, chilled. Instead of serving on lettuce, I mixed in shreds of baby romaine hearts. The remoulade sauce is delicious.

Made this for new years eve, left out the hearts of palm and served a scoop on a leaf of boston lettuce. It looked nice and everyone loved it.

I made this for a cocktail party and it was a big hit. It did seem to have too much remoulade, so when I served it over butter lettuce, I left a lot of the remoulade in the marinating bowl. The hearts of palm were good but got kind of lost in the sauce. I am not sure it was worth the $6 price per can.

We really enjoyed this! For the first run, I followed as directed, except that I cut it in half. I used Legal Seafoods Jumbo Shrimp from BJ's because that was all I had on hand that was just sea salt and shrimp, (not shrimp, salt and sodium tripolyphospahte) - much better for a fresh salad, and worth it. Also being January, I went with hydroponic Boston lettuce. I let the shrimp marinate overnight in the remoulade,while keeping some back in reserve as to not overwhelm it and added some to taste as needed with the celery and hearts of palm. This is a lovely first course or could be a main lunch course. You could tweak it to suit yourself (green onions, Old Bay, more horseradish or hot sauce) to be sure. Give it a try and then add your favorite flavors.
