I enjoyed this recipe, although next time I would hollow out less of the radish since saltiness of the filling was a bit much.

very good light appetizer. We tried it for X-mas eve and brought in the family to sort, cut and ball and fill radishes, it allowed all the kids and teen agers to participate.

These were delicious! Cold, crunchy, tasty, and kind of refreshing. These were a nice counterpoint to the other richer appetizers I served that night. The olives were a bit over-powering. To correct this, I added some of the radish centers (chopped fine) to the filling mix. This had the benefit of adding texture and more radish taste. Instead of using a pastry bag, just put the filling into a small baggie and cut off one corner.

Very good and easy to make. I cut down on the amount of olives to some degree and found it necessary to chop the capers. The saltiness of the olives & capers are a nice contrast to the peppery radishes.
