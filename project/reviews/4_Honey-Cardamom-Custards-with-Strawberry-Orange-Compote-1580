I only had cardamom pods so I cracked them open and just used the seeds whole. I also left out the orange rind and used about a tsp of vanilla extract instead of the bean. This made a really simple, smooth custard and let the cardamom flavor stand out. After 40 minutes in the oven they hadn't set, but I think that's due to my oven being old. Anyway, I cranked it to 400 for 5-10 minutes and they came out great.

this was delicious. out of necessity, we substituted lime for the orange, it was excellent and intriguing with the strawberries. the honey really rounds out the richness of the custard.
