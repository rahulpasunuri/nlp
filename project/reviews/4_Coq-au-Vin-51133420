Made this dish for a 50th birthday celebration for a friend, and it was amazing! I followed another reviewer's suggestion to use shallots and garlic, which was a good addition. I served this with a baguette, roasted potatoes, and sauteed carrots and leeks. Really delicious meal!

I don't know if this tastes French, but it sure tastes wonderful.

I am a fairly experienced cook but thought it was really odd that this recipe did not specify whether the fat should be poured off after rendering the bacon. I did pour off fat and was glad I did. It would have been swimming in grease otherwise. This recipe was too labor intensive and time consuming. Glad I made it the day before, for a dinner party. Took out of fridge for 1 hour at room temperature, then 45 min. at 350 degrees.

I LOVE this dish! So easy and delicious with roasted potatoes or mashed. I added garlic and shallots to the mix. Rich sauce, chicken that falls off of the bone and delicious dish!

Excellent recipe. Followed closely but added a couple of minced shallots a after the bacon was rendered and a couple of minced garlic cloves towards the end of that step so they would not burn. A straight forward and excellent recipe.

Great Recipe; Used up chardonnay and pinot wines leftover -- and it was great! Also used some chicken thighs as well as legs.

Wonder and easy. Mushrooms add a new favor the this classic. Next time will use 6 chicken legs. Was even more tasty three days later. All you need is a good crusty french bread and a green salad,

Delicious, easy comfort food. I added four cloves of finely chopped garlic; it seemed strange that the recipe did not call for it. I served the dish over rice, but it would be lovely with just some crusty French bread. Enjoy!
