The mashed potato mix was fairly easy to make but I found the mix was too wet, so I added extra bread crumbs and it still fell apart. I used the suggestion of making them smaller and it didn't really work. It's good mashed potato though!

this was good, i would have given it 2.5 if able. anyhoo, the cakes def. needed to be much smaller, they lost their crispness at the 1/4 cup size recommendation. i would probably half that for a side dish and use a heaping tablespoons for an appetizer. the taste was delish, i perhaps would have used a little goat cheese or some other soft cheese. will def. make again with the above changes.
