I have made this couple times, following the instructions carefully. I can't stop eating these until they are gone!!! If you leave the cookies about 4 hrs in the refg, shape into rope and then let stand in roomtemperature about 1 hour before baking, the dough won't be that sticky to handle.

I made this cookies for Christmas and made the mistake of cooking the apricots too long. After the logs were baked, the filling was rock hard. It was difficult to cut the cookies.
