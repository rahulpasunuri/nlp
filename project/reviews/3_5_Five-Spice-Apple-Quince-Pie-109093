Excellent! Like an apple sauce pie because the apples got mushy but the quince cooked nicely. Hot or cold it's yummy!

Nice delicate flavour, but with 6 lbs of fruit this is definitely a deep dish pie! If I wanted this to fit into a regular pie plate, I would decrease the fruit to a total of 4 to 4.5 lbs. I like quince so next time I would make it with 3 lbs each of quince and apple. I would also pre-cook the apple and quince slices separately as together they completely filled my largest casserole pot so it was difficult to cook them evenly and stirring them mushed some of the apples. I also think the quince take longer than the apples to cook. Because I was using a prepared pastry shell and there was so much filling I ended up not using a bottom crust. Put it all into a large deep-dish pie pan and topped with one crust. Lovely served warm with organic vanilla yogurt.

I baked this recipe for my 6th grade class as a chinese food in social studies. It had such a different taste with a spices flavoring your mouth!Everybody seemeed to enjoy it, and kids are tough critics! The teacher liked it too, so with a little ice-cream this is a great meal for all ages and a great winter pie! Caraugh Ball Holy Trinity School, 6th Grade
