Wow. I have made this recipe for years and just realized that I don't follow it exactly. I mix all of the ground beef ingredients together and then I make them into big meatballs. I then scoop a little whole into the meatballs, fill it with grated cheddar cheese and cover it with the ground beef. This makes it so the cheese melts in the middle of the burger (instead of on top). Everyone loves them. However, I can't for the life of me figure out how I came up with the idea to put the cheese in the center of the burgers - instead of on top. You might want to try it, they're great!

4 Forks only if you add blue cheese to the mix. I saw a chef on master chef do it, and it took the burger to a whole new level.

These burgers are awesome, and so easy and inexpensive to pull together. I just made these for the 4th of July, and they were killer! The burger patties are unbelievably good with the simple addition of some BBQ sauce to the mixture, you'll be surprised. My Dad, who is seriously into grilling, grabbed a leftover burger from the fridge the next day and immediately came to me asking what I'd done to make them so delicious! The onions are also a winner. I'll absolutely be making these burgers again.

Good quick burger recipe. I did modify it by adding one chopped red onion and one egg to the mix as I only had 93% lean ground sirloin on hand and didn't feel like making the onions separately. You can definitely taste the bbq sauce. I think adding a crispy bacon slice would also be great.

This is a great burger... just made for the 4th of July; all loved it... barbecued onions a must with this burger... its amazing; made exactly as recipe but used cider vinager which is a bit more subtle.

Fantastic tasty and juicy burger. Definitely make them thick and flip once - don't press on them. They were so juicy and delicious.

I hate to add to the chorus, but truly the best burger any of us has ever had... I inserted a layer of vermont aged white cheddar cheese in addition to the cheese on top - what a wonderful recipe!

I am a vegetarian, but when hosting a cookout for friends, I chose to make these burgers! They were a hit! One of my friends said it was the best burger he ever had! I agree to put in your favorite BBQ sauce- we used Sweet Baby Ray's, my fiance's favorite!

Wow. I'm not a big red meat eater, but I decided to make these for my family and couldn't help myself. These were SOOOO good. My husband said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had. The barbequed onions are a must. I bought the ground chuck as someone else suggested and the burger still fell apart, but who cares!

Yum! Yum! Same for the onions. Did them on the George Grill. Wonderful. I suggest using YOUR favorite bbq sauce. My preference is a smokey sweet one--like Sugar Rays.

I like to use Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce for this recipe. Adding a little cheese inside will also make it extra delicious. Won us over!

Maybe I didn't use enough BBQ sauce but the burger did not stay together well during grilling and the buger turned out a bit dry. I'll probably choose a burger recipe with breadcrumbs & eggs in the ingredients next time

This was great!! Very moist. I also added a bit of cheddar cheese inside the burger before cooking and got rave reviews.

Great, flavorful, and easy. We also make a little extra and freeze some uncooked burgers for a quick weekday dinner.

I followed the advice of the cook from Ohio and made it with homemade Beer and Molasses BBQ sauce. I served it with cheddar cheese, the recommended carmelized onions, fresh summer tomatoes, and mayo. On the side, I served fries, corn on the cob, and cucumber salad. Great summer meal!

Served these at my Fourth of July to party and got rave reviews: used homemade barbecue sauce (Beer and Molasses Barbecue Sauce from this site) and five-year-aged Wisconsin cheddar. Served with Roquefort Mayonnaise (also from this site) as well as the Carmelized Barbecue Onions the recipe calls for. Guests absolutely gushed with praise for these burgers; will definitely make again. One last note: my butcher (who also raises all of their own stock organically) advised me that burgers made from meat that is too lean will often fall apart on the grill; subsequently, they recommended ground chuck for these burgers as opposed to a leaner cut like ground sirloin.

Flavorful, juicy and tender burgers. Easy and quick. Definately the way I will be preparing burgers for the bar-b-que from now on. Of course best made with Alberta Beef, the best in the world.

Very Good! I cooked the burgers on the Foreman grill and they stayed together perectly. The addition of the BBQ onions are delicious.

I served this twice and no one really liked it. I realize the reason--the meat has more of a 'meatloaf' taste, than a grilled burger flavor. If you like barbequed meatloaf, you will like this burger, but I cannot recommend it.

Probably the tastiest burgers I've ever had. The onions are great. Just a few things keeping this recipe from being perfect... I had issues with the burgers falling apart as well. I guess my only advice (without changing the recipe) is to only flip them once. The less you touch them, the less they'll break. Also, they're pretty big burgers. If you follow the recommendations, the "adult" burgers are almost half a pound! Something to be aware of.

Excellent burgers! My wife said it was the best burger she has had in a long time. I used the recipe as is.

These were great! I added a tint but if bread crumbs, as the mixture was indeed quite moist. And instead of putting the cheese on top, I made two thin patties, placed a nice layer of cheese on top of one, then covered and sealed it with the other. Fabulous flavour from the barbecue... we used Pigman's. Can't wait to make this again.

This was very good! I added some Worcestershire sauce and added a clove of minced garlic and some onion salt. I also added an egg to keep it all together. I used 85% lean beef... not for dieters. Delicious!

I made these for a friend's BBQ party. They were great and really easy. People who showed up late and didn't know I had prepared the burgers were telling me how good they were. Definitely will be making these again.

One of my two favorite burger recipes. Carmelized onions and baked "french fries" are wonderful too.

The burgers had good flavor, but fell apart on the grill. Since no one else mentioned this, it must be something I did (or didn't do). I'd like to try again, though, since they really did taste very nice. We particulary liked the addition of barbecue sauce to the meat.

This was a very good recipe to liven up hamburgers very good with the onion recipe on the side - no need for ketchup.

My friends and I celebrated summer solstice by having a cook-out, so I served these delicious burgers WITH the carmelized onions and portobello burgers for those who don't eat meat. These burgers got rave reviews; cooked up nice and juicy and kept a nice, controlled flavor of cheddar barbecue. I've made 'em since!

Very good burger recipe. Incredibly easy. Just enough flavor but not over the top. I added dried thyme & rosemary to the mix as well, which also added a nice flavor. They were very moist.

Excellent summer dish. I made the bbq onions to go with, as well as the oven potatoes, rounded out with corn-on-the-cob. Absolutely scrumptious. This will be a staple this summer.

These burgers rocked! I combined this recipe w/ another epicurious recipe and the results were the best burgers ever! The other recipe included bbq'd red onions to top off the burgers and roquefort mayonaise to heap on the toasted sesame seed bun... do it, it's sinfully good!

The burgers are very tasty and very yummy with the barbequed onions and sauteed mushrooms. However, if you are a little health concious, 1/2 the recipe for 4 burgers, make 1/2 the potatoe wedges: leave the skins on, use the olive oil, omit the butter and serve grilled corn on the cob.

The Burgers were so tasty! The Barbecue sauce was a great way to spice up plain hamburgers. They were a big hit at my son's birthday barbecue.
