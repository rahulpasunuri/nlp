The best Brussels sprouts recipe I have ever found..this made lovers out of two haters in our household! Because I used pancetta instead of ham, I omitted the butter and olive oil since it already had adequate fat. Otherwise the only change I made was substituting pine nuts for the pecans, since that's what I had on hand. Shredding the Brussels sprouts is genius, it makes a few go a long way and seems to cut the bitterness. This is now my go-to recipe for Brussels sprouts...wonderful!

I had never liked Brussel sprouts but made them because my husband does. I loved them in this recipe. I omitted my main course and just ate brussels sprouts for dinner. I did not have smoked ham so I cut up sandwich slices of deli-ham as a substitute.

Made this dish for Thanksgiving and the family of 17 loved it. We didn't add the ham but everyone wanted the recipe.

Blech. I like Brussels sprouts, but this dish was like a pan of sauteed grass. Not enough ham or pecans for the amount of sprouts. Also, shredding the sprouts ruins the texture - you'd have a much nicer dish if you simply halved the sprouts and sauteed them in olive oil with ample quantities of ham and garlic.

This was a nice and different way to use Brussels Sprouts. I didn't used the shredding disk but rather the slicing disk on the processor. Also thought a splash of vinegar would make the finish nice. I chose this recipe because I had leftover ham from New Years Day and think that prosciutto would also work well.

Loved this!! Even my kids ate it. I sub'd the broth for white wine and used almonds rather than pecans and scratched the ham, since I didn't have any. Still delish!!

Even my 6 year old declared "Yum!" This was really good. For the reviewer who thought they were too grated - be sure to use the slicing disk on your food processor, not the grating disk.

Fantastic! This recipe is very easy to prepare. My husband isn't a huge fan of brussels sprouts, but he really liked these.

I served this recipe for Christmas dinner and it was a hit. In my rush to make the dish, I accidentally disposed of the chicken broth. I substitued it for sweet vermouth and it tasted great.

Just served this for Thanksgiving. My husband could not believe I was shredding the sprouts, but after he tried it he stopped complaining. I think this way of preparing softens the cabbage taste. Will definately make again.

Fourth Daughter made this for this year's Thanksgiving feast and we all LOVED it!! I'm planning to use it for a forthcoming dinner party I'm doing.

This recipe did nothing to make me like brussel sprouts any better. Perhaps following loridraper's suggestions would make this a better dish. One Thanksgiving of this dish was enough. Will NOT be making it again.

I loved this recipe. The saltiness of the ham (I used prosciutto) was a great offset to the sweetness of the sprouts. We plan to make it for Thanksgiving this year. Next time, I plan to omit the broth next time, or saute the sprouts in oil first and perhaps add some broth later to finish the cooking.

Made this recipe tonight and wouldn't tell the kids what it was. They ate it and called it delicious. Even the DH ate it and he has horrible childhood memories of brussel sprouts, as do I. Trying out recipes for T-Day and do think I will making this one. Even if you think brussel sprouts are disgusting, trying this recipe, you may change your mind!

Not happy with this recipe. First, I was expecting an entree, not a side dish. It's definitely not an entree. Second, the texture was very strange and off-putting. I used my food processor to "grate" the brussels sprouts. But it's such a small vegetable, that grating them is really more like "flaking" them. The texture was too fine, almost mealy. I was expecting a more shredded, texture, maybe like shredded cabbage. I was disappointed. Also, it was too dry. Needs more sauce or something to kind of bind it together.

This recipe is decent, but I think a few changes would make it better. 1) Double both the amount of pecans and smoked ham 2)Add cranberries for a more dynamic taste, and diced green apple if you choose 3) instead of chicken broth, use apple cider for a sweeter taste
