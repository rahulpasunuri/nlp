Made it, loved it. I cut up a whole chicken instead of just thighs, and increased the baking time to 30 minutes. Turned out great! Next time, I will add cornmeal to the flour mix as suggested by another reviewer.

I cannot believe how many poor reviews this recipe has received. I have been making this dish for nearly two years and it is fantastic! It is not the typical "Southern" often found in meat-&-three's- it is better. It is not to greasy, and the flavors are well balanced. I do normally make this recipe with chicken breast, but that is the only change I have ever made, and myself and the countless others I have served to have savored every bite.

Like other reviewers I found this chicken to taste really bad. I love chicken and rarely throw it out, but I did with this chicken.

While I agree with most of the reviewers that "Southern Fired Chicken" is a bit of a misnomer, I liked this dish very much. It has become a family favorite that is begged for constantly. I have no idea how any of the reviewers could have taken a few bites and thrown it away. The only problem I have found with this recipe is that it doesn't make enough.

Boy oh Boy, is this boring! I agree with the other reviewer- a waste of time and ingredients. It's one of those dishes that you eat because 'it'll keep you alive...' as my Mom always used to say.

How could you possibly call this "Southern" fried chicken? Maybe "Southern New England" fried chicken but no way can you call this "Southern Fried Chicken." No actual Southerner would touch this dish. I am even offended. What if I posted a recipe for "New England Clam Chowder" featuring tomato sauce and cat fish? Next time do some reshearch. By the way, volumes have been written on how to make real Southern Fried Chicken.

I have to admit this has become a family favourite. I make this at least once every two weeks! Freezing any left over chicken (which isn't very often) and putting on a salad. Wonderful flavours. The only suggestion is to serve the chicken seperately from the gravy. I normally serve the gravy on the side. Enjoy!

My issue with this recipe is not the misnomer "Southern Fried Chicken." It's that it's just not good. I imagine that the restaurant version with rabbit comes off much better, but hubby and I both agreed it was a waste of ingredients and effort. The gravy is overpowered by the flavor of bacon, and battled with the chicken rather than complementing it. We ate a few bites, then threw most of it away.

As a frequent diner at many of our fine establishments here in Porstmouth, I was thrilled to hear one of our own made it to the RSVP of my favorite cooking magazine. Unfortunately, I never picked up a copy so here I am looking for it. After reading many of the reviews I fell the necessity to defend a great recipe from probably one of the most popular restaurants in town. I believe many BON APPETIT readers are misled by the title "Southern Fried Chicken". Lindbergh's is a fine restaurant that serves FRENCH /North African Cuisine. It's my assumption, especially since the original recipe called for rabbit, that this recipe is FAR from your stick to your grits southern(American) fried chicken. I've consumed the original and it's fantastic & thrilled I can do it at home!!!!!

I did not make this gravy, but rather a simpler turkey gravy. Had no mustard seed, so added 1 TBSP Dijon mustard to the egg mixture. Cut white flour to 1 cup, added 1 cup corn meal for crunch, used 1tsp cayenne instead of chili powder, and used boneless turkey breasts that were 1/2 inch thick. (Hubby has a chicken allergy, turkey's ok.) I only fried the coated turkey in canola oil (olive oil has a very low flash point, which really scared me). No baking, which made things go much faster.

I did not make the gravy and only fried the chicke, no baking. I liked the chicken quite a bit. A nice variation of fried chicken

While this recipe is not exactly a traditional "southern fried chicken", it is rather tasty and will impress all but the most discerning fried chicken fans. The thick gravy is full bodied and tastes great as is.

you can't get a recipe for Southern Fried chicken from New Hampshire.

This recipe must have come from southern Italy. Try 70% vegetable shorting 30% baccon fat for frying. Remember many in the south were poor and used baccon fat for frying. Fried chicken is fried not baked.

I think most of the negative reviews are because this recipe calls the chicken "southern." No, it's not even close to "southern" or even home-style. But the gravy is delicious. It's a very elegant recipe. It's no picnic dish to be sure; but it would be great for a dinner party with a good wine. Maybe they could change the name to "snobby" fried chicken and it will get better reviews.

The complaints about this recipe not being "authentic" are ridiculous. (No one challenges the authenticity of "Oriental" chicken salad, for instance.) Anyway, I needed a fried chicken recipe that wouldn't take too much time-- so I made the chicken and cut out the gravy. The spice mixture could use more salt, but other than that, the chicken turned out crispy and tender.

OLIVE OIL! Never fry chicken in anything other than veg. oil or shortening. It's so simple to make "Southern fried chicken." Pour enough Texas Pete over chicken pieces to coat. Shake on some seasoned salt and pepper. Probably about a tablespoon of seasoned salt and a teaspoon of pepper. Dredge in flour and fry until crispy and no longer pink in the middle. To make gravy, pour off all oil except approx. 3 tablespoons. Add 2 tablespoons of flour and stir until bubbling. Add a cup of milk and stir constantly. If too thick add more milk. Salt and pepper to taste. Now that's southern fried chicken and gravy!

Yes, this is chicken and yes, it's fried. But Southern???? Good Lord, who came up with this mess? I was blessed to be raised in the Carolinas around some of the finest Southern cooks in the area. We don't use olive oil (gak!) nor do we adulterate our gravy with the junk in this recipe. Marinate your chicken at least several hours in buttermilk flavored with Tobasco, salt and pepper, dredge in seasoned flour and fry in vegetable oil or shortening (we sometimes flavor it with a bit of bacon drippings) 'til brown and crispy. It's a simple method for a simply delicious dish that does not need tweaking. I agree with the cook who suggested Martha's recipe for Perfect Fried Chicken. Crispy and yummy.

I would never make this recipe again. Look: Marinate skinless chicken(with bones,the bones give flavor) in 2tbs crushed garlic, 1/2 cup vinegar, 2 cups buttermilk, and 1 tbs tobasco sauce over night would be best. drain and coat in seasoned flour. Deep fry until golden brown and drain on paper towels. Voila!

My boyfriend thinks fried chicken without gravy is a sin (sigh). So I made the Spicy Fried Chicken recipe from this site and the gravy from this recipe. It had good flavor but wasn't what I had in mind. It was grey in color and lumpy because of all the different ingredients. I even ran it through the food processor to make it more smooth. But it made it look worse. And I doubled it to make sure there was plenty - UGH. The whole concoction is still sitting in my fridge - hardly touched.

Dude, why would you fry a chicken in olive oil? Try this: 2 bone/skinless chicken breasts, 1 c. buttermilk (even in Michigan, we know buttermilk goes with fried chicken), 2 T. hot sauce, 3/4 c. flour, 1/4 c. cornmeal, 2 t. kosher salt, 2 t. black pepper, 2 T. fresh mixed herbs, and 1 qt. canola oil. Cut chicken into 2-in wide strips, mix buttermilk and hot sauce in bowl, marinate overnight in the fridge. Combine flour, cornmeal, salt, pepper, herbs in a ziplock bag, remove chicken from marinade and shake in seasoning mixture in baggie. Fry chicken uncovered 4 minutes in preheated 350 F. oil. Turn pieces halfway through. Olive oil! Yuck!

I loved this recipe, every part of it. The gravy was great, I really like the mushrooms and onions in it, very thick. We call it "dirty gravy" and the chicken was very good. I've never made any other fried chicken, but I will say this was quick and easy.

This chicken was way to greasy. I think a canola oil would have been much much better. The olive oil was too heavy. oilive oil is not for frying canola gives food a lighty crisp taste. It was Awful Yuck!!!!!!

I must say that I agree with Kentucky. Being born and raised in Houston, TX (40 yrs. next month), it would be a sin to fry chicken without first soaking it in buttermilk. And olive oil?! No self-respecting southern girl would let her momma know she used olive oil to fry chicken! Also, the gravy needs to be kept simple. Just use the drippings/oil from the chicken and flour cooked to a medium brown roux, with salt, pepper and creole seasoning, add milk and bring to a boil and stir, stir, stir. Serve with smashed potatoes and then you'll have true Southern fried chicken.

I know I hate it when people review a recipe and they haven't even tried it. However, I feel that I am entitled to voice my opinion as somebody born in New Hampshire (and whose family is still there), and by good fortune was raised in the South (I live in KY now). I have learned that southern recipes are made by southerners, not Yankees, and vice versa. 'We' shouldn't tell them how to prepare fresh fish, and 'they' shouldn't even pretend to know how to fry chicken. OK? A couple things off the bat wrong with this recipe is that the chicken isn't marinated in buttermilk, and it is fried in olive oil. Disgusting. If you are looking for a great recipe for the authentic meal, go to marthastewart.com, and look for her Perfect Fried Chicken recipe. And yes, I do realize that blessed Martha is a Yankee, however she has great resources, and this is a good recipe. Best of luck to ya'll..........

The chicken was very good but the gravy was only so-so. Next time, I'm going to discard some of the solids (onions, mushrooms etc.) and puree most of the rest so that the gravy is creamier and a lot less lumpy.

The chicken was actually quite good, but the gravy was absolutely awful. Even the smell turned my stomach.
