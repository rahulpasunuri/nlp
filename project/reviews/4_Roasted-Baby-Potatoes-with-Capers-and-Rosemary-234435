Great, very simple recipe! We included it in a vegan seder (really) but I'll now include it in many other meals. I used fingerling potatoes cut lengthwise--they were perfectly roasted in a bit less time than directed. The garlic, capers, rosemary and salt are all PERFECT!

Just tried tonight(1/24/12). It's easy & delicious. The aroma lingered long after we finished the dinner. I would suggest to pair this potato w/ any creamy feta cheese salad dressing. It's divine. Also, this can be a very good dish for the summer cook out or entertaining.

I thought this recipe was great, however made one mod based on reviews and roasted in a casserole dish instead of baking sheet. Kept the potatoes nice and moist.

These were very good with the itty-bitty potatoes and I didn't even need to cut them in half. The garlic chips that were in the pan after cooking were an extra bonus treat!

Great and easy recipe. even my 7 yr old and my gourmet friends enjoyed it. forgot to add capers and it was still great. Used as side-dish for Passover and am taking for Easter!

I'm not sure why the potatoes just didn't have the flavor I was looking for. Next time, I'd chop the rosemary and garlic. They halved cloves and large sprigs of rosemary were just getting in the way. I would prefer more flavor with every bite than this. Nothing spectacular when it comes to roasted potatoes, I think a good spice mixture would be better, although I did enjoy the caper touch.

I'm alway trying out new roasted baby potatoe recipes because I can never seem to get mine to taste as good as restaurant ones. This one is definitely the best so far. Use parchment paper to prevent burning and sticking, and turning them often really helps to keep them from drying out.

Made some changes and it was amazing! First, I cut the potatoes into bite sized pieces. Second, I sliced and minced the garlic. Third, I added the capers to the mix and baked everything together. It turned out so good. I cooked longer than suggested to get a crispy golden brown on the potatoes. The purple and red potatoes are expensive, but well worth it.

I agree with reviewers who found the potates dry. I used a mix of baby yukon, red and purple potatoes and found all but the yukons dry and flavorless. At $4 a bag, I'll skip these next time and use regular yukons cut into bite sized pieces. I had problems with the fresh rosemary. It became very dry and lost flavor. I'll try dried next time, which seems to hold up better in the oven. In my haste to get dinner out of the oven on onto the table, I forgot to add the capers until after the potatoes were out of the oven. Will definitely try these again and get this part right. I second the reviewer who suggested larger capers so they don't become lost on the plate.

I had capote capers in the fridge, and the larger size was fantastic with the potatoes. This has made it into our regular rotation! I can't stop raving about how great it was compared to how easy it was!

This is very easy to make and is something that requires little attention while you prepare the rest of your meal. I have made it four or five times both as a brunch side-dish and for dinner and consistently well liked. Also very good heated up the next day.

I left this recipe for my husband to make while I was at work. Something very wrong with the instructions. 400 degrees on a cookie sheet? The garlic burnt up and the potatoes where dry. He did turn it down to 350 when he smelled the garlic burning. I think this could be good at 350 in a casserole dish with a lid that you could put on half way through. The capers added a nice flavor.

Very good. I made these back in March to rave reviews. Forgot to review til now. Looks great with a variety of baby potatoes. Will make again for sure.

It's already too hot to use the oven for dinner, so I tried a pan roast. I microwaved the potatoes on high until they were just tender, then popped them into a dry cast iron skillet on high heat to add some color. Added olive oil, garlic, salt, and rosemary after a toasty brown crust developed, and cooked until nicely fragrant. Hubby loved 'em, even though I forgot to add the capers. Looking forward to making these in the oven come fall.

It's either pretty bad or pretty good that such a simple recipe can upstage a main course that you spent 3 hours preparing. Not sure which. In any case -- these potatoes are easy and magnificent. Just make sure you toss together a lot of different colors -- like baby purple potatoes -- for dramatic effect.

High marks for ease and taste. Capers were a nice touch.

simple and easy to make and was a total hit at the dinner party. I would definitely make this again. I also drizzled truffle oil on the potatoes before serving.

I will always roast my potatoes with capers, garlic and rosemary after discovering this recipe!

We loved this dish! The only change I made was to use less oil which had no effect on the delicious outcome. This will definitely become a standard recipe at our house.

This recipe was ABSOLUTELY DELISH!! My whole family loved it and it was easy to make with ingredients I had on hand. I didn't have capers so I simply omitted them. Potatoes were VERY flavorful! Am planning on making it again tonight!

I roasted the potatoes on the grill instead of in the oven. I stirred about every 20min or so, whenever I had to check on the meat. I had the grill temp on low so it took longer for the potatoes to cook but next time I will use medium heat. This dish was very tasty. Next time I would like to try a different type of potato~the reds seemed to get a little dry. Overall, very tasty and a breeze to prep and cook.

This is now my favorite roasted potato recipe. I used yukon golds because I love the flavor. It's a great way to use some of the rosemary from my herb garden. Yummy, yummy, yummy!

This dish was fantastic! Normally when we roast potatoes in the oven we're just slightly dissatisfied with some component of the taste and texture, but this choice of purple potatoes was just right! A major hit with everyone.

Delicious and easy. I used Yukon Gold baby potatoes which gives the dish a nice contrast between cripness on the outside and creaminess on the inside. I added more garlic and fresh rosemary than called for and was happy with the results.

We made these for passover and I have made them again. Simple to do and has incredible flavor. we did not stir every 15 minutes and they still were crisp.
