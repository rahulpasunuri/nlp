I combined all the ingredients as another cook described and added a dash of cayenne pepper to the croquettes. I agree that they are sort of bland. I served them with maple syrup/dijon mustard dip and an Asian dip and that seemed to really inhance the flavor. I would serve these again for a pre-dinner snack. All that rice and cheese soak up the alchol.

Following the recipe I could NOT get the rice mixture to form into fryable shapes. I had to add the 2nd egg and breadcrumbs INTO the mixture to get the consistency I needed. That said, my family & friends really liked this dish and said they want to add it to their regular cycle of meals because it is easy and tasty. As others mentioned this recipe is very simple so the taste is simple as well. I am sure the more I make this the more I will experiment with spices and flavors such as garlic, horseradish, fancier cheeses, etc. Overall this recipe was a big hit:)

Easy ti make and my guests really loved them. I served them a an appetizer at a dinner party with some champagne. Fried foods and champagne go so well together. I made them smaller than the recipe suggested so that they were more like "finger-food." A real winner.

Superb!One of the easiest apps to satisy a wine swilling crowd. I followed the recipe to the letter the first time and everyone loved them. The next time I made them I added smoked Spanish Paprika and that took it over the edge. The same crowd (they have nowhere else to go) applauded the addition.

As others said, these justs didn't wow. I even doubled the cheese, added 3 crushed cloves of garlic and some chives, and it still wasn't too flavorful. I think a very good cheddar would be a more fitting cheese.

pretty good - I added a bit of horseradish after I made (and tasted) the first batch and that helped a lot!! Just the right kick they needed...

this was okay. i ran out of plain bread crumbs and used italian seasoned bread crumbs for half of them. that half turned out much better. the kid loved them.

I found these pretty bland (even after adding lots of extra cheese), but people at the event I took them too raved about them. Not one of my faves.

We used leftover risotto and less cheese. Terrific!

We loved these! I made them with brown rice instead of white to make them a little bit healthier for my kids. They were a huge hit with not only the kids but with my husband and I too.

My daughter loved these. However, they were really a pain to make because the rice mixture falls apart as you are putting the little balls in raging hot oil. I would have added more Parmesan cheese as well.
