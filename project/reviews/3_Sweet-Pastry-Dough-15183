Excellent pastry dough recipe. I forgot to combine the egg and ice water but it wasn't a problem putting them in separately. Really not too different than any pie dough, but sweeter and perfect for a tart. Bakes very well.

This is an easy crust that works for everything! I've used it over and over again for a standard tart crust and it never fails.
