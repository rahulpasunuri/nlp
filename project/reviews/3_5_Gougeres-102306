Worked perfectly! I am not sure what the other reviewers did - mine came out very puffed up, and totally delicious. My children devoured them! They would be perfect to add a savory filling also. I will make these again for sure!

Add fresh parm reggiano for some more exciting flavor (and a lot more gruyere!) They turn out less dense and more flavorful

These turned out really well for me, but I wish I read the other reviews before I made them. They definitely could have used more cheese/flavor. I served them as an appetizer and they were tasty, but a little bland and unremarkable. More flavor could have made them a hit!

I have a tried and true recipe for Gougeres but had a penchant to try this version. Unfortunately I ended up with dense, very un puff like cheese puffs. My recipe has less butter and flour than this recipe and comes out perfectly every time.

First, mine did puff as choux should and I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I will add more cheese, cayenne and salt. This was VERY EASY.

There are various adjustments to this simple recipe. You can start with chicken broth instead of water for example. It is also important to dry the pate on the pan (just keep on stirring for a few more minutes until the pan is coated slighty). Transfer the mixture to a mixer before adding the eggs as it's a lot of work to combine them by hand. Add more cheese if you want a stronger flavor. Start with the oven at 425 for 10 mins and then turn it down to 375-50 for another 20, or until they are golden. DOn't open the oven door, and let them start their cooling process in the oven (turn it off and leave them there for 10 mins. Gougeres are delicious and very successful in dinner parties!

These are the best! Delicious! I dry the dough a bit before I start to add the eggs.

There are are few oversights in the recipe; these do not puff and hollow ou like choux paste should. First off, you should double the amount of cheese or its flavor will be barely detectable. After adding the flour, keep stirring for a minute or so, to evaporate some moisture. Then, take it off the heat, and let cool for a few minutes (no more!) before adding the eggs or they will immediately cook. When cooking, you may want to start them at, say, 450 to spur puffing, then lower to, say, 325 for 30-40 minutes. If you're making ahead, poke the bottoms after oyu remove them from the oven, turn upside down and let dry out on the baking sheet.

These are excellent, and always a crowd pleaser! Tip: Use finely shedded cheese. Also - cheddar works well, too.
