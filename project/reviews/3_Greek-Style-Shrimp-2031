We've been making Greek shrimp for years for both company and special family gatherings -- all to rave reviews. The problem with this recipe, as I see it, is that it wants you to cook the onions to death, which greatly reduces the flavour and texture. Use lots of onions and garlic for best results, but only saute them for about 30 seconds (yes, that's 30 seconds, not 8 minutes!). Also, DO NOT omit the feta cheese from the recipe. Just before serving, crumble about 8 oz of feta cheese into the soup, and stir. Serve with fresh Italian bread for sopping up the juices and a glass of fine white wine, and you've got the makings of a very romantic evening! (the rice suggestion sounds yucky to me. I'd go with the bread -- it's more tactile and fun, and tastes great).

I thought this *sounded* wonderful, but the feta and shrimp together just really did not work for me. The tastes clashed too much. Threw half of it away.

Great recipe! I added feta cheese to give it some "bite". Have made it a few times for company and they loved it.

I've made this several times...with changes, of course! I add 3 minced garlic cloves at the end of the cooking time for the onions. I use atleast a cup of wine(takes a little longer to reduce but it's worth it). When the shrimp is cooked I add a liberal amount of feta and chopped fresh cilantro. The recipe as it appears is OK but lacked depth of flavor. It's a family favorite now.

This was absolutely GREAT! We made the Mint Rice with Feta also. We only made enough for 2 small servings, and we really wished we'd made more.

Followed recipe exactly as written and found this dish to be rather bland.

the tomatoes and shrimp tasted so good together. and the feta and mint rice added a unique taste. a good recipe for those with daring tastes. for those not so bold, try regular rice.

This dish is simple and quick to make, tasty and "fancy" enough to serve to guests, and uses a minimum number of easily found ingredients. I liked the minted rice and actually found that I wanted to add more mint--then again, I tend to like onion bagels for breakfast. The only problem with the recipe is that the mint goes dark very fast, and so I have to add it JUST before serving.

For a college student who really only cooks for themself and whatever random roomate happens to be walking by at the time-- this dish was great. Quick, easy, not too much of a mess, and no wierd ingredients to buy and use only once. I added olive slices and crumbled feta on top.

Very easy, with a great flavor. Tried it with the feta-mint rice. Rice turned out very well, but seemed strong against the shrimp. I will try it with steamed rice next time.
