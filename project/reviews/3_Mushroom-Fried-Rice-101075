Tasty dish, but as described, it is way to salty. Cut back on the soy sauce and salt by half. Try it with brown rice. Works well.

This dish is rapidly becoming my husband's favorite meal. We use this as a main dish, so we usually add chicken or good-quality steak sauteed in sesame oil to make it a bit heartier.

It was okay. My husband hated it (but he doesn't like exotic mushrooms), but my father-in-law liked it a lot.

Very tasty. I ran short on time, so purchased white rice to go from a nearby Chinese restaurant. I still had to season it a bit with more soy sauce at the dinner table, but overall it was a very good side dish. The mushrooms and cilantro, especially, came together nicely.

Excellent flavors and it comes together quickly. Prepare the Chinese rice as directed for best results.

Excellent side dish. I increased the cilantro to 1/3 cup and added a little sesame oil to the sauce.

Excellent!!! I only had shitake mushroom and didn't have rice wine or sake so I used sherry cooking wine instead. came out really delicious. Definitely will make it again.
