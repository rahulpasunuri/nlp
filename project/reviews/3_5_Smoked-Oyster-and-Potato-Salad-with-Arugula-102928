Good, not great. Be mindful of the fresh lemon juice, I thought 2 TBSP was too much and would recommend starting with a little over 1 TBSP and adding the rest to taste. It is quite lemony but maybe that's perfect for some. All the components worked nicely together, but it wasn't a stand-out combination for me.

Very good and quick to prepare. Something about the combo of oysters and potatoes really works. I happen to hate red onions, so I substituted scallions. I also suggest tasting the dressing before you add it, I tweaked the proportions more in line with a typical vinagerette. I might even make it again tonight

Like others, I made it exactly as the recipe, but the onion was too strong and the dressing blend. With less and very thinly sliced onion, the dressing made of oilve oil, the lemon juice, 1 teaspoon of a very good mustard (grainy better) salt and pepper, and it was very nice. Helene

I'm really sensitive to the taste of purple onions, so I used 1/2 of what the recipe calls for...turned out great, and is very easy to make. Also, I used the smoked oysters that come in a pouch -- I suggest draining them some, they are quite oily!

I agree with the other reviewer; lemon plus the flat-leaf parsley makes the salad bitter. I used lemon plus white basalmic vinegar and it was much nicer. Everything else about this recipe is terrific. The smoked oyster/potato/arugula combination is really different and delicious.

This was our salad for New Year's Eve dinner, and the combination of oysters, potatoes and arugula was a wonderful contrast of flavors and textures. A very elegant yet simple dish. I ended up making a viniagrette for the dressing, because the lemon in the dressing recipe made it too bitter. Better lemon and better dressing next time.
