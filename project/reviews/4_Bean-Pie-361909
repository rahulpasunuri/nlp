This pie is amazing! I used the Basic Flaky Pie Crust recipe on this site, and it came out divinely. I made this because I had the remains of a can of Cannellini beans to use and had all the rest of the ingredients in my pantry--I didn't imagine it would turn out as well as it did. If using canned Cannellini beans instead of navy beans, you may want to puree them in a food processor or blender in order to get a smooth consistency.

This recipe is so unique and delicious. I always cut the sugar when making desserts, and so I cut the sugar in this from 1 c. to 1/2 c. and it was still plenty sweet. To make up for the difference in consistency, I added 2 Tbsp. flour; after baking and cooling for the directed amount of time the consistency was divine! I paired this pie with the simple graham cracker crust from the "Sweet Potato Pie and Marshmellow Meringe" recipe. It was very tasty.
