Very easy and delicious. My only problem is getting the crust to bake all the way through --looks crispy and ready on the outside but was a little gummy. I made this with a mixture of pears and apples, which worked well too -- I cooked the apples a little longer.

everything in this recipe took a lot longer than it said it would...except for cooking off the puff pastry. that said, the filling was delicious. i didn't have enough time to cool it thoroughly, so it fell apart when i inverted (which was *highly* amusing). that said, everyone ate it even though we'd just had a HUGE potluck dinner and there were still 10 other desserts on the table! one addition: i sprinkled a little ground clove and cinnamon and also added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to offset some of the sweetness. got rave reviews!

I made this dish for a gourmet dinner party held by a group of friends. We always go "all out" to impress each other. This dish was so good, that we all had seconds... and after a big, delicious dinner, that's saying something (especially since we're all trying to "cut back"). I not only will serve it again, I am sharing this recipe with others.

It was alright. Have had other pear tatins that were much better. This was a little too sweet.

I take pastry out of freezer 20-30min before using, and roll it out in a lightly-floured 2gal plastic bag, refrigerating it in the bag till I'm ready to shape and use it. I also put pear slices in about 2Tb lemon juice while I'm slicing, adding juice (and pinch salt) to pan before putting in the pears - makes it much richer/deeper tasting.

I've made this 2 or 3 times now with nothing but rave reviews. The combination of fresh ginger, vanilla and pear is beyond compare! And if the taste combination isn't enough, the amazing aroma that wafts through the house as this cooks is enough to drive any dessert fan to the brink.

An excellent combination of flavors to compliment any meal. I followed the directions exactly and the tatin looked and tasetd delicious. It takes some time to coordinate the defrosting and rechilling of pastry, but the effort was minimal considering the result.
