This can be made into a truly awesome appetizer. Instead of 4 figs...seems like a lot to me...I used one, stuffed some of the cheese in it, wrapped it with a fourth as much prosciutto and cut the phyllo into 32 instead of 8, doubled the recipe and had 64 beautiful little pockets of fig, Stilton and prosciutto heaven. The sauces are amazing and really make the dish special. My guests loved these and raved about them for months. I highly recommend this!!

This was terrible. I followed the recipe to a 't' and ended up throwing it out it was so bad.

I agree with the other review that said this tasted weird. I loved the individual elements, however I didn't think the flavors melded.

This recipe is amazing! It is the kind of dish you almost wish was not so rich, so you could eat more of it. I used dried figs and gorgonzola and it was perfect. I would not change a thing. My dinner guests raved. Would definitely make a again (and again).

I first made this recipe with fresh figs and found it VERY sweet and too goopy; I just made it last night for a dinner party with dried figs to really rave reviews. I found the dried to be not only easier to work with but less syrupy and made for a better concentration of flavors. Yum!

I made this as a starter for Christmas dinner and New Years! It impressed everyone. The flavours are gorgeous. To save time I prepared it up to the stage of wrapping the prosciutto around the cheese and fig. Left in fridge (covered) until the next day when I finished the phyllo and two sauces! A definite keeper and sure to impress.

I agree, this dish is fabulous. Not as time-consuming as you would expect, and the end result is fabulous. I used 4 dried figs per phyllo packet, and it ended up being a bit sweet - I will cut them in half and use 4 figs halves per packet next time (and maybe use fewer phyllo sheets as well). They were also rather large - my guests were nearly full by the time they were finished with them - maybe I'll try a mini version next time.

I had never used phyllo dough before and found it easy to use. I made these for company and they all asked for the recipe. I made a handful without the prosciutto for those in the group who don't eat meat - and they liked them as well. Next time,I'll experiment with adding aspargas as well.

I thought the combination of flavours was fantastic! I used kalamata figs, since that is what I could find. I sliced them in half before pressing into the cheese, using about 6 halves per bundle. The next day I warmed up the remaining figs and stilton, and drizzled with the leftover sauces. Yum! This recipe is a keeper.

This recipe is fantastic. I have substituted gorgonzola for the stilton and served this without the port sauce. It is a big favorite

I was so excited to try this recipe for a dinner party. Presentation was beautiful, drizzled w/ the glaze. Everyone had only one; it tasted weird. I love all of the elements -- I always make the fig tapenade w/ blue cheese from this site, and love prosciutto & blue cheese gratin w/ artichokes, also from this site -- but together the taste was just off. A friend at the party said, "I thought it was just me," but everyone concurred: Beautiful presentation, strange end result. I entertain a lot, I cook (and pretty well) a lot and generally pick terrific recipes. I won't be making this again.

This is one of the best yet from Epicurious. I used large, fresh figs and the end result was simply fabulous. My guests loved the sweet-saly mix. It was a hit and everyone took home the recipe.

The recipe was easy to make and my guests loved it; even those who would never eat a fig or taste stilton. This is a winner.

These are delicious. I served mine as a cheese course. I had to use dried (Calmyrna) figs as fresh had gone out of season. I also used Gorgonzola cheese as that's what I had in the refrigerator. Finally, because I was using up an open package of phyllo, I made each one in just one sheet of phyllo buttered and folded in half nad then wrapped around the bundle. They are also huge, perhaps because we had them at the end of a meal. As much as I enjoyed the sauces, I continued to enjoy them reheated by themselves with just a glass of port.

I made this ahead of time and had to reheat in the oven but it was still wonderful! got raves from guests. I used 1 fresh fig and filled it with the cheese. I used a little more proschutto than called for. enough to wrap fig. Sauces were superb. a Winner!

OK, this one is truly over the top. We served it as a dessert course with some nice Port, and by that time one "bundle" was enough for each of us. Whether you use fresh figs or dried, this little beauty is impressive and decadent.

agree, the sauce was divine. served these as dessert with honeydew melon. i think i need to play with the recipe though -- the cheese completely melted out of the phyllo during baking. i would use 3 or 4 figs: i tried 2 as suggested, but thought that more were needed to balance the saltiness and pungency of the cheese (juice) and proscuitto. overall it was very intriguing & i recommend.

Wonderful first course. The flavor combination was amazing. I would definitely cut down on the figs. Either cut 4 of them in half and press those into the Stilton or only use 2 figs total. The sauce is absolutely out of this world and a goes perfectly with the whole dish.

This was a very tasty appetiser for a recent meal. Some suggestions and tips: (1) the 4 sheets of filo/phyllo pastry made for a rather large and heavy starter. Using only 1 thin sheet of pastry made a smaller and more delicate dish (2) fewer figs and more prosciutto worked better (3) when the port sauce stops boiling and begins to foam - it's done!
