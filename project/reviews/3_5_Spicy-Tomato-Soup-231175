Served in small cups chilled at a party - crowd favorite. Warmed is ever better as the heat of the flavors increases. My favorite tomato soup ever. I add canned fire roasted Muir Glen diced tomatoes.

I used: - 1 can of tomatoes without juice - fresh tomatoes peeled, half the volume of canned tomatoes - 1 cup of chicken broth - 1 1/4 teaspoon chili This turned out to be just right.

The soup is great but I served it with pieces of chicken breast and rice noodles. Red peppers, cilantro, lime wedges and thin slices of carrots was as topping. Fantastic outcome.

Added 2 more jalapeno's for more spice, cut the chicken broth in half and add in stead heavy cream to match, blend with Vita-mix no need to strain. Top with basil. The best...

For my money, the Tomato Dal soup on this site is much more interesting and delicious than this soup, and contains some of the same flavors. But it's true that I used fresh tomatoes for the dal soup, and canned tomatoes here--as the recipe suggests. Perhaps the fresh are just so much better that I was spoiled. It's also true that I didn't strain this soup after making it, since I wanted something hearty for a cold day. I wouldn't make it again if I didn't have an immersion blender. I'm not ruling out the possibility of making it again, but neither am I in a rush to do so.

I loved this soup! I used an immersion blender which made mixing a breeze. Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great (except for the amt of salt... I will add less next time).

As a kid I hated tomato soup, since what I got was served from a can. With a bumper crop of fresh tomatoes this year, I decided to try making it homemade, and this recipe made the most outstanding soup I've ever tasted! The ginger, jalapeno, everything comes together for terrific flavor.

Ah! 1/3 full is the capper, eh? Thanks for the tip. Makes sense if you stop to think about the kind of pressure something hot will exert on the available airspace in the container vs. something cool or cold. DING! Brain on!

To the cook from Portland who doesn't like the blender - you can't fill a blender more than one-third full when blending anything hot - this means you have to do it in batches, but it does make for a super-creamy texture.

I'm not a terribly experienced cook, but this was fairly easy to make (even if a little messy!) The soup came out delicious! Very spicy, which I like, but adding a little rice and low fat sour cream helped to balance it and make it more filling. Definitely worth the effort!

Simple and quick! I didn't have any trouble with using the blender; I recommend holding the blender lid down tightly with a towel. Also, I added a whole jalapeno pepper and skipped the straining. Good for a cold night!

A blender?! Do the authors of this (admittedly delicious) recipe have any idea the havoc that you will wreck upon your kitchen if you use a regular blender? Ho-ly cow. I've made this a few times and find it super tasty but always used an immersion blender. Well, cue a house-sitting gig without my trusty Blender On A Stick, a snowstorm and then a you-know-what storm when I realized what a massacre results when you try to puree hot soup as though it were a daiquiri. Do what you will with tweaking the ingredients or not but for the love of not discovering just how semi-gloss your kitchen paint happens to be, just make sure to immerse, not (tomato) disperse.

We really enjoyed this distinctive and simple tomato soup. We skipped the first puree-ing and the sieve.

This soup is easy and fantastic! It is spicy but not too much. Highly recommended.

Great soup, I used fresh homegrown tomatoes, about 6 lbs (4 small roma size tomatoes = 1 lb). Dipped tomatoes into hot water for a few minutes or until easy to peel, peeled, then pureed using food processor. Poured thru baking sifter to remove seeds - this worked great. After cooking the onion mixture, added onion mixture to food processor with some tomato puree and blended. Only used 1/2 the salt, & add more to taste at table. Very fresh tasting, nice blend of spices but was not that spicy. Next time I would double jalepeno's and maybe also try it with doubling all the spices. Served with bread that you dip into soup. For bread, used sourdough, brushed with olive oil, baked till crispy, then rubbed with garlic. Bread was great addition.

I chose this because it was a quick-to-make soup, and because it was a recommended accompaniment to a grilled cheese recipe I had chosen. I'm not a big soup eater, but I did enjoy this flavorful recipe. To make it more quickly, I pushed it through a sieve before I added the blended tomatoes to the onion mixture (thereby not having to worry about getting the onions to pass through the sieve). I used 1 1/2 tsp of ginger and 3/4 tsp of jalapeno and the result was flavorful w/out being hot. The soup was quite watery, even after simmering uncovered, so I took prior reviewers' advice and added some whipping cream. Very good and very simple.

This is an excellent recipe for soup. So delicious! Unfortunately it takes a lot of work with the various steps of blending, cooking, blending and straining. I think it's worth the work, if you have time.

it was wonderful! i was worried while making it that it was not going to thicken up but after i blended it in the blender it was all good! and i used a whole jalapeno because i love spicy food!

very very good. we used the whole jalapeno, which made it REALLY spicy. i think we'll go with 1/2 next time.

I teach kids to cook and we made this recipe with 20 of our 9 - 11 year olds back in December. Everyone loved it, even the ones who didn't love tomatoes.

I didn't have a jalapeno, but used all other ingredients. My whole family liked it, but didn't gobble it up. The cumin flavor adds a great addition to the flavor of regular tomato soup taste.

I have yet to rate a recipe with 4 forks, but this was excellent. Didn't do the 1st step, just placed whole toms with juice into sauted vegs. Smashed them up with a wooden spoon during cooking. Added more jap, garlic & ginger to taste. The end, added so much fresh black pepper, some olive oil or parmesan, depending on who's bowl I was scooping up. I can see adding some fresh parsley or cilantro, depnding on what else you are serving. SO much healthier than canned tomato soup. Served with grilled cheese.

I was on a liquid diet and can't stand canned tomato soup so I looked for one I can make. This soup is wonderful! Especially on a cold and rainy evening!

This is a fantastic soup and an easy recipe. I skipped the sieve, opting instead for a thicker, heartier soup.

Went over really well, I added a small can of diced tomatoes, one small carton of heavy whipped cream and fresh basil at the end.

I've made this soup a couple of times. It is one of the best tomato soups I've ever had. Some people with disappointed reviews should keep in mind that this recipe is one where quality of ingredients is very important (eg. using an onion with higher sugar content, using really fresh cumin, etc.). For my personal taste I would choose to put a little more jalapeno. Also be careful with ginger. It's easy to overdo it. For added creaminess I would suggest adding a little heavy cream. Creme fraiche and sour cream would add a sourness that would overwhelm the acidity in the tomatoes. The balance of flavors in this soup is very delicate.

This soup was ok, I was hoping for a really spicy kick and didn't get it. Would consider next time using the fire roasted tomatoes and a spicier pepper. I used the suggestion to liquefy at the end and it did make the sieving easier. Great consistency and my husband liked it. I would make this again with some changes- different tomatoes, different pepper and consider switching one can of tomatoes to a can of sauce.

This is a delicious soup that doesn't take a long time to make. I used one can of whole tomatos and one can of sauce. I used only cumin (no peppers) and organic chicken broth. Very yummy, all who've tasted like it. I'll make it often and share with friends.

I liked the consitency of this recipe - much better than a lot of other tomatoe soups I've made. BUT - the flavour isn't all that. I added red wine and basil to try to liven it up. It was somewhat more tasty but still average. So - I added a dolop of creme freche (sour cream) to the centre of the soup and it looked really pretty - but upon eating the soup - I wish I had added a good two or three spoonfuls of creme freche to kick it alive. My guests were ever so polite by saying it was, but NO ONE TOOK SECONDS!! WE had loads left over. I will never do this recipe again. My reputation took a bit of a nose dive last night.

I'm now on Weight Watchers because I've made so many great recipes from this site and gained a few extra pounds. I'm so glad I found this recipe because it is very tasty but also very low-cal and healthy. I used the Trader Joe's Organic Fire Roasted canned tomatoes that a previous reviewer used. I think it probably does add more flavor than regular canned tomatoes. I started to use a sieve but stopped because I prefer a more hearty soup than a thin one. I may add just a little nonfat half and half next time to make a creamy, spicy tomato soup. I think this recipe makes more that 4 servings...I had two big bowls and I still have a full soup tureen of it left. I'm looking forward to the leftovers tonight.

Substituted vegetable broth for chicken broth. Added chopped summer savory, sage and thyme. Used habanero peppers instead of jalapeno.

i love this soup. fresh jalapenos and fresh ginger. OH IT IS GOOD. my husband got some pretty good heartburn but told me that it was worth it. you have to have grilled cheese with it.

Rating: 4
A fantastic, out of the ordinary offering. A few tips for preparation - set the blender to liquefy for the 2nd blending session....it helps chop the onions small enough to make the sieving stage easier. I found forcing it thru a sieve to be an overly tedious process and used a handheld flour sifter, which worked beautifully. I agree with the earlier reviewer - leaving out the jalapenos really compromises what makes it so special...the balance between the sweet and hot with the tang of the tomatoes sets it apart. I've made it 2x - once with a conventional yellow onion and once with a Mayan sweet onion - I think it was a bit more complex in its flavors with the sweet.

A notch above, this soup goes from stovetop to bowl in a jiffy and packs a big taste. Fresh ginger and cumin are the secret. For ease of preparation, use of ingredients likely to be on hand, and boldness of flavor, I give it four forks. Appropriately named, the soup beckons all those who love spicy hot food. Faint of tongue, beware. My husband, usually less than enthusiatic about soup, agrees this is a keeper.

Definitely a keeper recipe! My family loved the soup, especially the spicy kick! This recipe is exactly what I was looking for.

Really good flavour combination with the tomatoes, ginger and cumin. Didn't have a sieve handy so this one came out a little chunky, but it still tastes great and I'll definitely be making it again.

This soup was delicious, had a pretty colr, and the spices added a very nice touch to the whole dish. I loved it and will make it again.

A very tasty and easy dish that we will definitely make again. The combination of spices with the chile, ginger and cumin made it different than other tomato soups. I didn't take the last step of blending the whole soup or sieving it and we enjoying the textures. I used Trader Joe's canned whole organic fire-roasted tomatoes which gave the tomato base a more complex flavor.

But if you get rid of the jalapenos, how is it spicy tomato soup? Without the pepper it's just...you know...regular tomato soup.

Rating: 3
I eliminated the jalapenos because it overran the rather delicate/complexity flavor of the tomatoes as I ate it.
