My go to recipe for lemon bars and lemon curd in general. I double the filling and reduce the sugar by about 1/2 a cup (per batch). If Myers lemons are available, they make these insanely good, but they're fine with regular lemons too. With the sugar reduction the curd is nice and tart so it works well in other deserts that already have something sweet going on with them.

Perfect! Easy! Just allow time to cool. I thought the shortbread base was just right. Lime sounds good, too.

So good and easy. Just don't overcook the shortbread base. I always add extra lemon and some lemon zest. Sometimes I use lime, or a lemon/lime combination.

Really enjoyed these lemon bars. Easy to make, and nicely tart. I will be stretching the recipe somewhat on my next pass - two 8x8 pans will make the shortbread base a little thinner, and I plan on increasing the lemon top by about 25% to make the lemon thicker.

These turned out alright. Probably just my oven, but they didn't turn out as firm as i'd like them to be. Turned more like a rectangle slice of pie than a bar. I would add five minutes to the baking time for both shortbread and filling. Other than that the taste was phenomenal. My partner (who had hated lemon bars) loved the taste of these. I would gladly make them again, with a little tweaking.

These are my go-to lemon bars. Tart, simple, wonderful. I just took them to a party- where people could not stop raving about them and the entire plate was devoured by the time I was ready to leave. Cut them into little bars and it's just enough sweet and tart. Even people who said they didn't like lemon were going back for seconds...

Rating: 2
This may be a quick recipe but I think it's rather disappointing. To all those who double the filling--you are crazy! Just a single portion of filling, as the recipe calls for, makes an incredibly thick, gooey, rich lemon bar, far too gooey for my taste. The shortbread is decent but all in all, I would rather spend more time on a better recipe. Made a pan of these for Christmas and at least half of the pan had to be thrown out.

Really bad. A total waste of money and food. These are headed for the garbage this morning. Stick with a classic lemon bar which I should've done but I wanted to test these for my bakery. Bad idea.

Rating: 2
This was a pretty good recipe,not so fond of the texture of the lemon compared to my regular lemon bar recipe (that I could not find). I followed some suggestions about doubling the filling for a 9 x 13 pan and would say it was a good proportion of filling to shortbread. I didn't double the sugar, but probably could have gone to 2 1/2 cups as it was still pretty tart with 2 1/4 cups (and I like lemon bars on the tart side). Not liking the shortbread for this recipe - too soft! I like a crisp buttery shortbread and this one wasn't it. Would use this as a back up recipe if I lose my regular one again!

incredibly good! I put less lemon juice than in the recipe and less sugar and next time I will stick to the lemon juice in the recipe because I thought they could have been a bit more tart. The shortbread was amazing. Lovely recipe, will definitely do it again!

Fabulous and way to easy! The shortbread dense crust goes perfectly with the smooth tart lemon topping.

I think I will definitely play around with fun additions to the crust, like nutmeg, ginger, or pepper.

Have made these several times and I always add lemon zest. To the cook from Davis: The bitter aftertaste you're getting may be from the pith of the lemon. Be sure not to get any of the white pith when you grate your lemon zest. I find it easiest to use a microplane grater and run it lightly over the lemon.

I LOVED these lemon bars! They are super easy to make and taste amazing. I also cut down the sugar to 1 cup and added 1 Tbsp of lemon zest! One random question, did anyone else get a bitter aftertaste ?!? it might have been from the zest but other than that, it was delicious!

These were great and super easy to make. I also added about a teaspoon of lemon zest. Also, put the sugar on top just before you serve the bars or it will dissolve and you'll have to put more on later.

These bars were easy to make! The only hard (well, tedious) part was juicing the lemons! I didn't have any lemon juice on hand. For me, 30 min was the perfect baking time. The filling came out very smooth, at least ten million times better than the filling that you make from a mix. I really liked the ratio of crust to filling; there is a lot of crust, but it's good! More filling would just be too sweet. If you want more filling, cut back on the sugar!

This is my first try at making lemon bars and am impressed with the results from this recipe! The portions between the shortbread base vs. the filling is a bit off though. It's more shortbread than lemon bar. I will double the filling next time. I also added only 1 cup of sugar and zest of 2 lemons. I would also add a bit more lemon juice next time, as a like mine a bit more on the tart (but not too tart) side. All in all, a good and very easy recipe. Will try this one again.

I have been making this recipe for a few years, and have used for family meals and taken it to pot lucks and tailgate parties. It is always a welcomed addition and my family looks forward to the bars! A hint.. you can power sugar the tops right away, but it will get gummy after a day or so. So, I tend to power sugar them about 2 hours before I serve them. Also, I have used crushed lemon drops as a light layer, and then used the powdered sugar.. it really added a punch of flavor and everyone seems to like that addition.

AMAZING!!! I served these at a fourth of july barbecue and everybody raved, declaring them THE BEST lemon bars they had ever had. I doubled the filling recipe and used 2.5 cups of sugar. I also used the zest of 4 lemons and 1.5 cups of lemon juice. They were very tart, not overly sweet, just the way they should be!

I followed the recipe pretty closely except for a few small changes: I baked the shortbread crust for 16 minutes only as per some of the reviews, and used seedless berry jam since I had no blueberry jam at home. I also used meyer lemons (all I had on hand) instead of the regular eureka or lisbon lemons so it wasn't very tart. In future, I'll definitely add lemon zest since I like my lemon bars fairly tart. I will also consider making 50% more lemon topping.

I have made this dish several times- always to rave reviews! The first time I made this recipe the shortbread crust also rose to the top- I realized my problem. You must pour the lemon filling on as soon as the shortbread comes out of the oven.(to the post on 11/19/05) If you allow it to cool before you pour it on then you will have the same disaster! Hope that helps!

You must bake the shortbread recipe first, otherwise you will have problems. Click the link for the shortbread and follow that recipe first, then begin with the lemon curd recipe. Followed this way, it's a terrific, easy and tasty square. Good luck with your next batch! (My only change is to add perhaps 1 tsp or so of lemon zest, for extra zing, as I like it quite tart.)

The lemon flavor is excellent. If you prefer them tart omit sprinkling the powdered sugar on top. I also had a problem with the lemon curd on the bottom.

I'm assuming it is something I did because no one else mentioned this problem in their review. My shortbread crust rose to the top of the lemon topping while baking. They are chilling right now but Im pretty sure I have a disaster on my hands. Any idea where I may have gone wrong?

I reduced the shortbread cooking time by a few minutes because it was already golden and it came out wonderful! I had a little problem with foaminess on top because I think I mixed the filling too much, so I recommend a gentle hand for that.

I made these for the third time yesterday, and I love them as much, if not more, than the first time. They are TART (which is how I like my lemon desserts), and the texture is perfect. The only change I make is that I always add the zest of one lemon, and I make a double recipe of the filling, as suggested by previous reviewers. I use a wire whisk to mix the filling and this is a gentle enough process that doesn't result in foam on top. I never have a problem getting the bars out of the pan, and they cut cleanly as well. I must say that the flavor develops and gets even better the second day (if there are any left). These are GREAT.

I made this recipe pretty much as written with a few changes: added lemon rind to lemon mix, mixed base by hand (creamed butter with sugar, then mixed in the dry with a fork). I thought the shortbread base was the very best part--I cooked it for about 15 minutes before I added the lemon mix. My boyfriend said they were the best lemon bars he'd ever had (and ate half the pan to prove it).

A wonderful recipe. I've had two requests for it already and I just made it three days ago. I thought the lemon topping looked too runny and doubled the flour, but after it was cooked, I thought perhaps I shouldn't have done that. However, it appears that despite my overzelousness, the cookies survived well. Next time I'll ignore my instincts and use the 1/3 cup of flour.

Although these turned out tasty, I had a great deal of trouble getting them out of the pan. The shortbread recipe definitely needs some instruction on lining with parchment paper. I've never had this trouble with any other plain shortbread recipe, but this was my first lemon bars attempt and I guess the extra baking time creates the problem.

Rating: 2
OK...I read all the reviews and recommendations, and the only thing I did differently was to line the baking pan with parchment, and reduce the bake time on the crust to 15 minutes. After 15 minutes it was golden, and that looked pretty done to me. Unfortunately, it wasn't. The crust on the finished bar is not crunchy, but soft. Further, the taste is great, but as many others have written, there's not enough of the lemon curd on the base. I'd double this if I were to make it again. As to the foamy top, there's really no way to get rid of the foam before baking, otherwise there would be even LESS of the lemon. Another good reason to double the lemon part. Finally, don't even think of storing these in anything other than a single layer (as I did). I'd thought the bars were sufficiently cold to store in layers with wax paper between. Not a good idea. The paper pulled the foamy part of the topping off the bars. I guess that's one way to remove the foam :-)

These were GREAT! And so easy! The best part - the ingredients are things you have on hand. I even used bottled lemon juice - in a lemon-craving pinch - and they were fantastic. I will definately make these again. I didn't have any problem cutting, although I did follow other instructions and baked the shortbread for 15 vs. 20 minutes.

First time making lemon bars, and I was so pleased with my results! Followed directions exactly, other than cooking shortbread base for 15 (have done this with the cheesecake bars w/same recipe several times ), and they were swell. Maybe it was the cold, dry WI air, but they set well and I had no trouble at all cutting them neatly. I did have some trouble with little flour lumps rising to the top, but I picked them out and covered w/ powdered sugar. Next time I won't let my 3-year-old mix!

My best friend and I love this recipe!!! What we found works really well is to only use 3 eggs instead of 4 and to add a dash of extra lemon juice to the recipe.

I doubled this recipe. By mistake, I thought a single recipe called for 1 1/2 cups of lemon juice, rather than 3/4. I only rechecked the recipe after I had already added 2 cups of juice.

I recommend increasing the amount of juice!

I love these so much! So does everyone else I've ever made them for. Several people seem to have problems with the shortbread base. I think they may be baking it too long. If you bake it until it's just set and lightly browned, you shouldn't have a problem. Mine is always buttery and delectable. I've eaten a whole pan by myself! I think the flavor combination and the texture of the filling are superior to any other lemon bar I've ever had.

I was totally disappointed in these. I made them to put on an assorted sweet tray for company and ended up throwing them out. The shortbread base was tasteless, and turned into a crumbly mess when I tried to cut the finished product up into squares. I did follow the directions exactly but perhaps my base came out too dry (?) either way it totally overpowered the very thin layer of lemon filling. My suggestion would be to definitely double the filling and cut the cooking time on the shortbread base.

This recipe was AWESOME! I made them for a potluck and they almost didn't make it with the snitching swipes from my own family on the way! HINTS: Add 1 tablespoon of lemon zezt; make sure the filling is ready to go the minute the crust has baked (the heat from the crust clearly helps to "set" or cook the topping/filling to the right consistency). This bar is like a deliciously sweet and crunchy-ish crust that is a wonderful platform for the BEST flavored lemon filling. Use fresh lemons for certain, do not substitute. Like the best lemon pie on a cookie crust.. heavenly!!

These lemon bars were quite good. There was too much specificed shortbread, though. I also attempted putting on Smuckers Low Sugar Strawberry Jelly on the top, as a type of thick icing. It was absolutely delicious. I also suggest putting in some lemon zest. Zest the side of each half-of-lemon a bit, not much zest, but just a splash. If you're a citrus nut, you can't have too much lemon! And if you're a strawberry fanatic... the jelly works fantastically. But use only the best, if you can't home-make it!

These were a hit. I had a bunch of lemons laying around the other day so I decided to try this recipe. I had a least six lemons and I only managed to squeeze out a little more than 1/2 a cup of juice, so that is all I used. After reading the advice of other reviewers about the confectioners sugar melting into the bars, I left it off completely. My husband was bringing them into work and I wasn't sure how long they would sit, so I just didn't bother. Personally, we liked the proportions of the lemon topping to the shortbread. The shortbread was so simple in our food processor and it was so easy to work with. A great spring dessert!

A really solid recipe - I like to call them "I-Just-Found-Out-My-Ex-Boyfriend-Is-Becoming-a-Priest Rasberry Lemon Bars." My roommates loved them, too. I used the suggestion of a fellow reviewer and put liquefied seedless rasberry jam (in zig-zags, piped out of the corner of a snipped Zip-Loc bag) on half of them. I did this part with 10 minutes left to go in the baking time, ; that way everyone is happy - the berry-people and the rest of us. A new favorite!

I also added grated lemon zest in the filling for an extra bit of lemon zing!!!! They were deliciously tangy and refreshing and so easy to make. I will definitely make these again.

We really enjoyed these lemon bars. They were very easy to make. Much better than the fudgy brownie bars that go with the shortbread.

This recipe was very easy to make but I was a bit indifferent to the flavour. The shortbread base is excellent - try the other toppings associated with this base especially the cream cheese one

My husband scores big points at work whenever he brings these in...they are so refreshing and the shortbread crust is amazing. I've also noticed that the crust is thick compared to the lemon top, not a bad thing at all, but who'd miss it if you took a few spoonfuls out and baked it separately, to give you a delicious cookie to nibble on? Oh, yeah, I've done it...it's the best!

I made these lemon bars twice and everyone loved them. I did generously butter the pan, sides and bottom and had no difficulty removing the bars from the pan. Both times I made these the lemon mixture was foamy but that was easily covered by the powdered sugar and didn't affect the taste. I'm making these bars again today for a sick friend who requested a dessert. Definitely a keeper!

Received rave reviews on this recipe. I substituted pure passion fruit pulp (remove seeds in blender on low, w/ minimal if any water) and added 2 T. minced lemon rind. Delicious!

I would say the confectioners sugar should be sprinkled on these immediately before serving, otherwise it kind of melts into the lemon. Also, I guess the crowd I served these to weren't so into Lemon/Fruit cookies. These were the only cookies left on the platters. (I had made bunches of kinds of cookies for a pot-luck dinner party for 27 ppl). So, while they weren't bad per se, I don't think I'll be making these again, except maybe for my father's b-day (he loves lemon!)

I recently went to a BBQ and brought the lemon squares. They were gone even before I got to sprinkle the confectioners sugar on them! Definetely the best lemon bars around!

Very good -- great flavor -- easy to make! I would not let bake for 30 minutes though -- edges were a little too brown. Definitely a keeper.

These are fast and delicious. A perfect lemon bar recipe and one that I will make again and again. And they keep very well. It took us one week to eat the whole pan (leftovers airtight in the fridge) and the taste didn't suffer -- the texture was a little moister, though, by the end of the week. Still, not bad for a week later!

I had to make these two days prior to serving and they were FANTASTIC! Tips to keep them from getting mushy: Bake full time or a few minutes longer. After baking, turn off oven, crack oven door to allow moisture to escape for about five minutes. I did this for both shortbread and in final baking. Cool bars uncovered; first on counter and then in refrigerator until very cold. Cut, place on doilies on serving tray - the doilies allow a bit of ventilation to bottom of bar. Cover lightly with saran wrap and keep cold. Use wax or parchment paper in pan bottom to prevent sticking. They were GREAT, got rave reviews and weren't a bit soggy!

This is the best lemon bar recipe ever. For a change, before you sprinkle powdered sugar on top, spread a thin layer of rasberry jam over the pan, for rasberry-lemon bars. It looks fabulous when you cut the bars up and it tastes delicious.

Divine. I tried mine with half the pan sprinkled with chocolate chips and half without. I think I prefer the without - as it's not as sweet. I also didn't have enough lemon juice - and substituted the juice from a couple of limes - can't even tell the difference. Not as crisp the next day, but chewy is not a bad thing.

Rating: 4
This has become my standard lemon bar recipe, after trying many others. It's simple and produces a great result - everyone I know absolutely loves these. I sometimes add chocolate to the recipe (like in the chocolate macaroon bars). I sprinkle chocolate chips on the hot crust, put them in the over for about 2 minutes, then spread around. Just be careful when you pour the lemon mixture over the chocolate - do it very gently so you don't inadvertently stir up the chocolate! This is also a very popular lemon bar - some of my friends are so disappointed when I make them without chocolate!

Every time I make these, I always have requests for the recipe. Be sure you use all of the lemon juice called for or it just isn't the same.

These were very good lemon bars and so easy to make. Mine did get foamy eventhough I added the flour as directed in the recipe. However, when you sprinkle confectioners sugar over the top the problem is solved. I would take the advice of other reviewers and make them the same day you plan to serve them. On the second day the crust is mushy.

These were very good lemon bars and very simple to make. I did not get a foamy top like some others out there. The recipe reads to stir in the flour after the eggs go in and i think this may calm down the foam after whisking in the eggs. Try it.

I added grated rind from 1 lemon (good choice). However, these particular bars didn't freeze too well. They tasted great when thawed, but looked a bit bedraggled.

The lemon bars were very foamy on top. Didn't look very good. What did I do wrong? They tasted just ok.

Tasty! And fairly easy to make. I only had a 1/2 cup of store-bought lemon juice (sue me), so I also added the juice of one lime and a funky orange-lemon fruit that we happened to have. So it was more of a citrus bar than lemon bar, but it was still excellent and I love the shortbread crust. I will definitely make these again.

I used this recipe as a last minute dessert for my book club. It was warm still when I served it. For being so fast and easy, it was very tasty. It was a giant hit with all my fellow readers. No substitutions, ingredients are pretty standard and it has a nice tangy flavor. I will definately make this again.

My chocolate dessert-loving children have requested to have these bars INSTEAD of dinner(and they think I'm a great cook!) Without a doubt, this is THE superior lemon bar. I stopped testing different recipes after finding these in the March l999 Gourmet.

These were tart and tasty, although I think I ate too much while I was cutting them! Very filling. The shortbread crust was the best part. I think mine needed to be firmer, and they kind of had a foaminess to them on top, I'm not sure if that's how they're supposed to look or not.

Yes, a four-fork cookie! These tart and yummy treats went to a church-youth-group bake sale, labelled as 'Adult Cookies'. Four bars were cut into bite-size 'samples', which were carefully doled out to Adults Only (to get more grownups to the bake sale table). These bars were priced higher than the regular cookies, and SOLD OUT. In fact there were requests for more ...

I really like this recipe. The bars are perfectly tart with a great shortbread layer. It is very easy to make. I used parchment paper and was able to easily remove the whole recipe from the pan at once. There was only one little bar left over and it looked and tasted fine the next day.

These came out perfect! I added about 1 tsp of lemon zest and topped with lemon flavored powdered sugar. Nice texture and not too tart. Oh and one last thing, they are very pretty and will impress friends and family, who tend to think I cannot cook!

These are the yummiest!! I have been making these bars for over ten years...recipe in Bon Appetit about '91 (doubled the curd part). I always cut the sugar a bit (1 cup only) and add some grated lemon peel (fresh or from spice jar). The very top "skin" gets all the pell bits in it and gets a touch chewy, and SO tart and GREAT!

I have been looking for a great lemon bar recipe for a while. Brought it to work and everyone raved. Definitely a keeper. The lemon part is tart but thats the way I like it. The shortbread does go soft overnight although it still tastes great.

I love to cook, but I don't bake. I was less than thrilled with the idea of a separate recipe for the shortbread base, but since it seemed like the perfect ending to a light summer dinner, I decided to give it a try. I made these lemon bars along with an orzo salad Nicoise, and everyone flipped. I was hoping for leftovers, but since there were none, I'm making them again. I'm hoping these lemon bars will become my signature dessert!

Pucker up tasty. Smooth and sweet. My favorite Lemon Bar recipe to date. My only complaint would be that the lemon did not adhere to the base very well.

delicious, lemony flavor, although the lemon part was a bit thin compared to the cookie crust.

VERY quick and easy, but still tasty! A couple people mentioned the tartness, so I was a little worried, but I put in the full amount called for by the recipe, and didn't think they were too tart at all. I did, however, have problems removing it from the pan, even after I had sprayed generously with Pam. This might have been due to the fact that I kept the lemon bars in the baking pan and refrigerated them overnight, so next time I will try removing the bars immediately after they have cooled. Also, I thought these bars would be lighter than they were, but even though they were richer than expected, they still tasted good.

Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum! These are definitely the best lemon squares I've ever had! And so quick and easy! I have a four month old daughter, and those qualities are important! They were so good I ate the whole batch myself! The best part is definitely the shortbread base--so sinful! But the lemony topping is great, too--these things melt in your mouth! I'm going to try them next time with a cheesecake-like layer in between. Make these lemon bars now! Don't delay!

Could this BE any easier? I was done before I started, that's how easy! And GOOD? Very, very lemony, and just tart enough (I used Meyer lemons). Great consistancy. I had no problem with the shortbread, and I did not butter the pan - just patted the dough in as instructed. Made it within an hour on Easter morning. Completely stress-free and I cannot stress how good they were. Elegant simplicity. Make them now.

i loved these lemon bars! i cut the recipe in half just to try it and before i knew it, they were all gone! i really loved the shortbread recipe and the tartness of the lemon topping was just right--not too sweet either. i am going to make a whole batch when i get home tonight!!

I made these 2 days in advance for a party. Won't do that again. It made them a bit mushy. The shortbread lost its crisp and the topping was so gooey that the confectioner sugar was liquified when I spinkled it on. I'll try tham again and serve on the same day.

I cut this recipe in half and baked it in a long, thing tart pan (the kind with a removable fluted edge). It was a huge success and much more elegant than plain old lemon squares. I also used Myer lemons, which helped to make it special.

I didn't have any parchment paper so I used waxed, it worked out just fine. I also used Myers lemons, they were sooo good!

Really delicious dessert. It is best when you wait to cool about one hour. To keep from sticking, as one person complained, I always put a sheet of parchment paper in the bottom when I bake. In this case, when the lemon bars were done, and after cooling on a rack, I picked up the parchment, after passing knife around, and literally was able to "slip" the entire 9x9x2 dessert out of the pan by pulling on the parchment. No sticking! They are kind of heavy on my stomach so, eat early in the evening not before going to bed. Really, really good and lemony.

My guests ALL requested copies of this recipe. The shortbread crust is wonderful and we preferred the taste on the day this dessert was baked. After refrigeration the shortbread crust loses its cruchiness.

IF YOUR DOUGH TURNS TO LARGE BALLS INSTEAD OF CRUMBS LIKE MINE DID, JUST BREAK IT UP AND MASH IT INTO THE PAN (GOD DID MAKE HANDS FIRST). IT WORKS JUST FINE. I'VE LEARNED NEVER TO EXPECT A RECEIPE TO DO WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL. WHEN IT DOES, WOW! AM I SURPRISED.
