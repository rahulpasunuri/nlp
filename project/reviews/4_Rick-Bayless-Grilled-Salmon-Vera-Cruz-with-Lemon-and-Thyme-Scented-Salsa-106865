A different way to enjoy salmon. A very interesting combination of flavors.

I am a huge fan of Rick Bayless and made this exactly as published for part of a lunch buffet for 35 people. It was good but I agree this was a little bland. It was one of the only dishes with half left over. We entertain a lot and were thrilled with the prospect of a dish you can make ahead but this was just ok. Much better salmon recipes on this site.

I also should note that I often substitute hot green chilies for the pickled jalapenos, and actually prefer their flavor. Both work just fine though. Also, do not skimp on the capers - they really make this dish.

Unbelievably delicious!!! I cannot get enough of this dish!!! The salsa alone is to die for, you will want to put it on everything, or even eat it by the spoonful plain (I do). When you start cooking the salsa it may appear that the ingredients aren't marrying quite right, and aren't cooking down into each other, but just be patient and keep your pan covered and everything will come together in about half an hour.

I made this for the first time yesterday for dinner with a friend. She's from Chicago and has eaten at Rick's restaurant there. We both loved it. I grilled salmon filets instead of steaks and served it with an orzo, tomato, basil, and feta salad. I'll definitely make the salsa again but serve it over grilled chicken -- husband won't eat fish.

A fantastically flavorful dish that, unlike most fish dishes, can be made ahead and kept for several days. I prepared according to the recipe.

Gotta divulge: did it w/ salmon filets that I baked. also didn't have pickled jalapenos so i subbed in some red pepper for heat. the boyfriend liked it but we both agreed that puttanesca spooned over the salmon would have been just as good, if not better. just a little bland for us, I think...

This was fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful. Although I don't care for salmon steaks so much. The meat is a little more special than a filet, but the bones don't make up for the slight variation in flavor/texture. Served it with a side dish of whole wheat pasta coated with pesto sauce and grilled corn on the cob. What a perfect outside meal for a warm spring day!

Mmmm, delicious! My husband loved it too. I made it pretty much as stated, except since I had some extra chopped basil on hand, I added that along with the thyme. Came out great. I used a mandolin to slice the onions which worked great, but next time I would cut them in half after slicing, as they're too long and stringy when cooked. Oh, yeah. I rinsed the capers (not the olives) and found I still needed to add a little salt. Will definitely make this one again.

A good and easy salmon dish. Next time I'll increase the spice a bit more chili (fresh), more thyme, etc. We rinsed the capers, the olives, and the jalapenos, and the dish needed no additional salt. My girlfriend loved the sauce (I made hers w/ grilled tofu & tempeh).

Fabtastic. My favorite salmon receipe. I get raves every time I serve to guests. I have had to grill indoors on Jenn-air a couple of time due to weather & flavor not quite as good but still great.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe and used just 1 seeded fire roasted jalapeno, and added crushed red pepper to taste, 3 fire roasted yellow bell peppers, omitting the water. I barbequed fresh sea bass the day before and added it to the Vera Cruz Salsa which I served in a large pot with warmed tortillas and homemade salsa for extra zip along with a lemon-garlic cucumber salad. Next time I will omit 1 t lemon zest. I have impressed my friends beyond measure. They are still raving days later. Thank you!

Rick Bayless knows how to do Mexican; we have been to his Chicago "Frontera Grill," so knew this recipe would be good. Served this to 30 guests on Valentine's Day with much success. To answer sylvia ("what do I serve with this?"), we served with (1) a tabouleh salad, and (2) broccolini with lemon butter. A good buffet menu requiring only a fork. The next time we serve this dish, will reheat the salmon. The salsa is wonderful!

What would make a good vegetable side dish to serve with this?

I had been looking for a fantastic salmon recipe with bold flavors, and I finally found it!! I only used 2 salmon steaks as it was just me and my husband, but I used almost the full amount of all of the other ingredients. I used less Tomato, olive oil, and water. I ended up with a fatastic chunky salsa that I poured over the top. It was super easy, and will definatley add it to my staples.

Simple to make, left out water completely, made a good presentation. Rave reviews from guests.

We had provisioned for this on a sailboat trip. It turned out that we weren't allowed to grill the night this was planned. We had to cook the salmon in the galley on the stove. It still turned out just great. All 6 aboard loved it. I'll definitely make this again at home (on the grill next time!).

Delicious! I halved the recipe for just my wife and myself, and didn't add as much water as called for because the sauce seemed too soupy already, but the taste and presentation was fabulous.

Excellent but not the best I've ever eaten. There are so many good recipes out there!

This is the best salmon dish I've ever had! Guests were enthusiastic also. Not only does it taste great, but it is a beautiful dish for entertaining.

This was wonderful! A big hit with my family! I served it at room temperature, as suggested, but it would be good hot also.
