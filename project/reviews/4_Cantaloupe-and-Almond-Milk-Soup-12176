I make this the lazy way and it is the most fantastic smoothie: store-bought almond milk and cantaloupe in the blender. Pour in a glass, add a tablespoon or two of almond meal to thicken it and stir. Done. Delicious and very low in calories. My palate doesn't require the honey.

I've been making this for years and it always wins raves. I garnish with a thin slice of lime and the toasted almonds. I also let the cantaloupe ripen for a day or two for maximum flavor. You don't have to change a thing. It's delicious.

this was quite good- really 3.5 forks. i only used one cup of water to blend the almonds, one tablespoon of honey (the melons were very ripe), and more lime juice (probably about 2 tablespoons)- it was very refreshing!!

very very nice. gives a sense of the value of almonds in a fruit gazpacho. I did not make the almond milk; I had almond meal on hand, and merely combined that with all of the other ingredients in a food proc and blended for 10+ minutes with no straining. I only added a tinsy bit of cayenne to the list of ingredients. The longer I blended, the more the orange color of the canatloupe came out, making both a pleasing appearance and a thickness from the almonds, for more fiber in the diet (the consistency after that amount of time in the food proc was acceptable for my taste not to strain - plenty fine enough). Decided to add mint with the sliced almonds as a garnish because I liked the taste.

Delicious! I added a few drops of almond flavoring to punch up the flavor just a bit as my alomnd milk seemed a little insipid.

A refreshing, fruity, yet creamy soup. I added a little spicy twist to it by including one teaspon of "quatre epices" in the ingredients in the blender. Try it!

Delicious as a smoothie! I saved the almond solids to use on cereal, ice cream, or in baked goods.

Very good. I use store bought almond milk so it is super easy.

I picked this recipe because it did not have any dairy products. It was simple to make. I think it will take less time the next time, because I now know how to make the almond milk. Putting a thin slice of lime on the soup as a garnish adds an interesting twist to the flavor. Don't overlook it.

I've been making this soup for years. As a starter for a summer meal, this cannot be beat - light, flavorful, refreshing. Garnish with a very thin slice of lime.
