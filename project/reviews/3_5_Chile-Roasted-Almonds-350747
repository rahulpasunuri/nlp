This is SO EASY and absolutely delicious. I kept the spicy oil and was having a friend to dinner so drained some sweetcorn and quickly warmed it in the oil - absolutely yummy. Oh yes, I sliced some clementine peel and added it to the nuts as they cooled with the salt, mostly to give a pretty touch, but they also add a subtle delicious flavor. Served it in a small copper frypan. Looked great.

Just made these for a party on Friday (it is Wednesday) and I can't stop eating them! It's a problem...but a good one. I did as recipe called for but a little less oil and also put them on paper towels from the skillet to sop up a little more. But really they're perfect. I will definitely make this again.

Tasty, quick and easy. I was concerned about the amount of red pepper, but it works very well.

Yummmm, these go great with cool cocktails as a classic bar snack. Kosher salt is essential, I did this with a batch of pecans and it worked out beautifully.

I've fixed this a half a dozen times because everybody loves it.

Added extra crushed red pepper (about two tablespoons) and a considerable amount of salt (used flaky sea salt). The amount of oil was perfect, and they were delicious. My guests also seemed to approve!

Made as written. Used Penzey's crushed "pizza peppers" for chili. This was not very spicy, and if I were to make again, I'd add more pepper, or use a spicier variety. 3 Tbs. of oil was a bit much; lined the tray with paper towels to absorb the extra oil.
