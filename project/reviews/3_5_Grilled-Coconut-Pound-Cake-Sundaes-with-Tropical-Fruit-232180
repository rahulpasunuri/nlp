First time grilling pound cake and I loved it. It takes just a moment and the effect of the warm, slightly toasted cake is delightful. For me, this topping did not work - too simple, maybe it's OK it you have really good fresh fruit. I didn't like the thinness of the sauce, so I tried to thicken it a bit and it came out like spicy molasses - not too subtle - maybe this was where I went wrong. I would definitely grill pound cake again but would probably use some other type of seasonal fruit or compote as a topping.

Don't hesitate to make this - it's unforgettable! A bit of work but so well worth it. Skipped the grilling step for convenience though intruiged how that could make it even better! Used pineapple, mango & starfruit. Paired this with a curry main dish & flavors worked well. Will make many times again...

This recipe is soo good, especially in the summer. I've made it twice and everyone has loved it. The only problem I've had is that the middle of the poundcake never comes totally cooked, but its still great! And it's really different from a lot of desserts I've made or had.

ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE! It was great at my wedding shower... everyone loved it! I used mangos, kiwis, star fruit and fresh pineapple for the fruit portions.
