I made a lot of modifications to this recipe due to not having a lot of the ingredients (frozen green beans and fresh broccoli, a little cilantro instead of mint, no pasta water because I don't like it, and tube pasta instead of long.). But I have to say I really enjoyed this and still captured the essence of the dish. This is easy to modify, and I did use feta, which really to me makes the dish!

This has a light and refreshing taste that does not seem right served hot. I liked it better cold the next day with a touch of red wine vinegar. Followed the recipe exactly but think it needs some spice so added crushed red pepper after cooking. If you don't like mint, you don't really taste it is you cut the mint requirement in half and make up the difference with basil.

This dish was simply delicious. Have made this several times: once with purple basil and Orzo pasta which was by far the best. Adding a little bit of lemon and not just pulsing the sauce, but consitantly mixing in the food processor gives it a pesto-like consistancy. Tonite we are trying it with baby broccoli instead of asparagus.

This is a really easy recipe that tastes inspired. I made it in late February and the fresh herbs tasted so Spring - definitely an escape from heavy winter casseroles. Also, it makes plenty, and tastes better the second day (and third). Enjoy!

My husband and I both LOVE this dish. The only thing I omit is the parsley, and I grill the asparagus. Yum!

Made this excellent recipe just as written and found it perfect! Have made it four times, finally remembering to recommend it to others. Enjoy!

This was a hit with my household -- a great weeknight quickie meal. I used fresh linguine and prepared as directed with the following exceptions: didn't add parsely or the reserved cooking water. As others note, it was tasty next day and at room temperature. For those reasons would make a great buffet dish.

Like other reviewers, I enjoyed this more as a barely reheated leftover. Two things I'd change: a little bit less of the chopped herbs, and an un-stringy pasta like bow-tie.

I really liked this, and it was EASY! My only complaint was that by the time you add the cooked pasta the rest of the ingredients are a bit cool which leaves the whole meal not as hot as it could be. I didn't have enough basil, so I also added some fresh oregano and tarragon, subbed the scalllions with fresh chives, didn't have enough feta so also used some fresh mozzarella. It would taste great as a cold pasta salad as well I think!

This dish was extremely bland and needed either a sauce or even a meat to give it flavor.

I thought that this was a fantastic summer dish that was even better at room temp the next day. I liked the idea of adding nuts (from the previous reviewer) and added some toasted pine nuts that were in my freezer. I also tossed the pasta with halved grape tomatoes (red and yellow). The tomatoes really made the color pop. I added a LOT more black pepper and a pinch of crushed red pepper as well.

This recipe was GREAT and very EASY!!! The mint made it very refreshing but did not overwhelm the dish. Left-overs were even better!! Substitutions included Ricotta Salata instead of feta (omit extra salt). I hand chopped all the herbs and cheese and liked the result better than pulsing them. Read the suggestion of walnuts/pecans too late but will definately try it (perhaps pine nuts?).

EXCELLENT RECIPE. THE TRICK WAS TO KEEP THE PASTA AL DENTE, USE FRESH ASPARAGUS, AND COOK THE ASPARAGUS, JUST SHORT OF BECOMING TOO SOFT. I USED BOTH GREEN AND WHITE ASPARAGUS. INSTEAD OF USING A FOOD PROCESSOR, I CHOPPED THE BASIL AND THE MINT.

This is a wonderful dish. It is one of the prettiest dishes I have ever made. I think the vegetables would make a great hot side or cold salad on their own.

Yuck. I though we were going to love this recipe when I read it as we love all of the ingredients. After happily chopping and pulsing, then easily cooking and assembling the dish, my husband and I sat down to dinner. I am sorry to say we were thoroughly disappointed in this pasta. We even tried to like it, but found it too salty (and I like salt/seasoned food), too oily and the mix of herbs seemed awkward all together. Seriously, we threw out the leftovers, which rarely happens around our place! What a waste of some fresh, local asparagus.

We tried this recipe and found it to be delicious. The first reviewer added toasted walnuts, and I have to say that this is an excellent addition and would always add this extra ingredient. This is destined to be a regular item in the summer months.

P.S. How does one rate 1/2 fork?

to sunsetchaser: you followed the method for the recipe and that makes it valid. I also added nuts (pecans; my daughter is allergic to walnuts) and left out the mint (I hate mint). Otherwise this is DROP DEAD pasta.

On my own, I probably only would have given this three forks -- but it was one of those dishes that prompted the perennial "You could open a restaurant" conversation with the boyfriend, so I'm giving it four. Those who pooh-pooh reviewers who haven't actually made the recipe in question can stop reading here. I had baby spinach in the fridge that I needed to get rid of, so I did that instead of the asparagus. I had fresh peas, but not frozen. I forgot to reserve any of the pasta water, so I added enough olive oil to destroy any "low fat" claim this recipe may have had. I had a bunch of locally grown organic parsley from a friend's farm, so I used way more parsley than the recipe calls for. I toasted some chopped walnuts and threw them on top. I poured more olive oil on it. I added a ton of fresh ground black pepper. Italian bread with butter on the side. A bottle of wine. Two chairs on the deck. A beautiful early summer evening. Perfect.

This was very good. A lot of flavor thanks to the feta cheese. I used whole wheat pasta.
