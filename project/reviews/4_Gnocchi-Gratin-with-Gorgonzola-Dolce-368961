I used store-bought gnocchi and it was still 100% fabulous. I get rave reviews every time I make this for guests. I can't wait to make it again!

This is fantastic! I have made it about 4 times now, three times with homemade gnocchi and once with store bought. Making your own gnocchi is hugely better, but it does take a lot of time. So, if you have time, or it's a special occasion, make the gnocchi. However, with store-bought, it is still pretty darn good and is pretty simple and quick to make, so I wouldn't let that deter you. It is still a great dish. It is hard to taste the ginger, but I imagine it is subtly there. The gorgonzola and rosemary come through in spades. This is really melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I have always followed the recipe exactly, and it has no weaknesses, so there is no need to "improve" it by fiddling with it. Get good gorgonzola, and it will be good.

This was delicious and I will make it again; however, I was surprised at the flavors that came through. I could not taste the ginger (which was fine because I thought it was a bit strange sounding with the other ingredients) or blue cheese at all; but the rosemary flavor was wonderful and the gnocchi was very creamy and delicious.

This was exceptional. I made some changes based on reviews. Before adding the cream to the saucepan I lightly sauted crushed garlic in butter with dried, crushed rosemary (didn't have fresh)... and I added a little less than called for cheese directly to the cream during the preparation of the sauce. The home made gnocchi has a great texture and is much lighter than anything you can buy. This is good enough for guests and special occassions. I wonder if this will be as good with cheeses other than blue as I know many people have a real aversion to blue cheese... Will be making this again.

This was melt-in-your-mouth fabulous. I've made gnocchi before with gorgonzola sauce, but adding the bread crumb topping really makes this dish spectacular. I don't want to think about the calories in this, but I will definitely splurge and make it every now and then. I followed the recipe to make my own gnocchi from scratch. I'm sure store-bought would work if you don't have the time to make your own, but it will not have as light a texture. I am going to have to make this for my husband's family sometime - they love gnocchi!

Total comfort food, just don't think about all the cheese, butter and cream in here. Absolutely make your own gnocchi, if you don't all you are really doing is boiling cream, steeping cream and making a topping. You cannot really take the credit for this recipe if you don't put in the time. I added two cloves of garlic to the cream in addition to the rosemary and ginger.

In fairness, I just made the sauce and used pre-made gnocchi for speed. This is about as easy as recipes get and both infinitely variable and forgiving. I boiled the gnocchi (forgot to salt the water which was a MISTAKE of course) then put them in a shallow tart dish and arranged zucchini spears on top before covering with the sauce and cheese. Made for a lovely presentation and got our veggies in there. This is a wonderful go-to preparation and I will use it again.

Delicious. I took a shortcut and used frozen gnocchi and it was fantastic. Next time I would try adding prosciutto in as well! I cannot wait to make this for my next dinner party and have people obsess over a very simple dish (with the shortcut of course).

This is, quite possibly, the best thing that has ever made. I did add a little garlic because it seemed fitting; otherwise, I made as directed. A little labor needed, but all fairly easy do, and WELL worth the effort. Will absolutely be making in the future for company...it is a little rich, decadent, and a complete indulgence.

While this is a fantastic recipe, the amount of cream called for really takes away from the flavor of the gorgonzola. Great comfort food, but not very flavorful. Also, not sure why the rosemary and nutmeg are called for as they don't really impact the overall flavor.

This gnocchi dish is delicious, and the house smells amazing while you cook it, too! The gnocchi takes some patience as you work out the dough... I added about another 1/4 cup flour to the dough as I got it to the soft but not sticky texture. Also, it needs to be gently kneaded with your fingertips as you work in the flour -- this incorporates everything but doesn't overwork the dough at all. My only additional step at the end is I broiled it for a few minutes to get the top a little crunchy and browned. Other than that, have patience with the gnocchi, and you'll love them so much, you'll never buy them from the store again.

This is the best comfort food ever. Treat yourself, it's not that hard to make, and don't change a thing, it's perfect as is.

Incredibly delicious! I substituted a garlic clove for the ginger in the cream infusion and will actually up it to 2 cloves the next time I make this, but really amazing recipe. I did make the gnocchi from scratch...and frankly may short cut from now on. They were really delicious and I was proud but a LOT of work.

This was my first time making gnocchi; I found the process to be easier than I expected. The gnocchi were light and nicely flavored. The cream sauce was lovely. Sprinkled some chives on top before serving - delicious!

I made this for Christmas, and it was really good. I was surprized at how easy the gnocchi were to make. I had to use Dainish blue cheese instead of the Gorgonzola dolce because I couldn't find any at my local grocery store. It may have been a bit too sharp, so I would be interested in trying the recipe with the correct cheese. However, to cut the sharpness, I ate it with cranberry sauce, which worked so well. I would make this again.

I used store bought gnocchi and added julien zucchini to this before baking. Very tasty and definitely a do again.

Unbelievably delicious! Made this for my family, and every single one of us loved it. I actually used about 2 lbs of potatoes (6 medium sized russets), and only used about 75% of the actual gnocchi in the casserole (I used the remainder the following day with a simple tomato sauce) but didn't change anything else. I will definitely make this again. And again. And again.

My first review ever. Delicious, but hey, with cheese and cream how can you go wrong? To save time, I used about 24 oz of packaged Gnocchi instead of making it myself. Boiled it three minutes then put it together as directed. My husband and three boys loved it!

So delicious! Followed the directions as written. No changes. I may try this with other cheeses other than Gorgonzola Dulce in the future as well! The flavors would accompany many cheeses nicely! This recipe is a KEEPER!

Made this last night and my wife and I loved it. I followed everything exactly except that I cut the cream in half and used 1% milk instead. I forgot to add the parmesan to the dough so I put it as well as the gorgonzola in the sauce instead. After steeping the rosemary/ginger per the recipe, I then reheated it just enough to get the cheeses to melt. Excellent dish!

Made this for Christmas Eve. Made and froze the gnocchi on Thursday and I was seriously considering throwing them out. This is the wettest gnocchi dough that I have ever made. Even adding tons of extra flour there was no possible way that I could make pretty gnocchi out of this. I can only call these potato dumplings as they are not what I think of as gnocchi. As horrible as they looked I hoped that the astoundingly good sounding sauce would make up for them. It did! Seriously, my family ate this up like there was no tomorrow. They asked me to make them again on Christmas Day. I used gorgonzola dolce (sweeter and less salty) and more parmesan than called for because I prefer bolder flavors but otherwise I followed the recipe. I would make this recipe again despite the weirdness of the gnocchi making process because the whole thing works. It didn't matter that the gnocchi were ugly and weird because, when cooked in the cream and cheese mixture, they turned into something quite lovely. The dumplings(as I now think of them) weren't heavy and were very flavorful. If you freeze ahead of time boil them directly from the freezer. Mine spent 2 hours warming in the car and this made an even stickier mess that finally resulted in my throwing out at least 20 percent in sheer frustration. If/when I make again I will use the Cooks Illustrated foolproof gnocchi recipe but add the parmesan cheese called for in this recipe because these gnocchi abominations were just that delicious.

I made this as written using regular gorgonzola (never seen the dolce version) but microwaved the potato and scooped the insides out. It was excellent, good texture on the gnocchi and the sauce was really good. Next time I will up the cream as it does get soaked up pretty much.

I, too, included it with Christmas dinner. But I didn't have enough potatoes and subbed sweet potato. It worked very well, but I needed to add lots of flour to make the dough workable. It was perfectly paired with sauteed rapini and garlic. We fried up leftovers this am with our chickens' eggs. Yum. When I make it again, however, I'll sub in a pint of half and half in place of the cream. The gnocchi really soaks up that one cup of cream and I think I'd like it a little creamier.

I just served this for Christmas dinner and even the most rabid carnivores in our family scarfed it down. Used Stilton as the blue cheese and sprinkled some smoked paprika and chopped (curly) parsley on top so it was "Christmasy". I served it with a curried vegetable ragout with tomatoes, eggplant, okra and peppers followed by a mesclun salad. Great combination We are quite disappointed there are no leftovers.

It was amazing! A little salty but I think that's from using a stronger gorgonzola than we should have. We had it with roasted brussel sprouts and a orange/pomegranate salad. Perfect for the holidays!
