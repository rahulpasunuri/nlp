I forgot to add my favorite "tip" - use homeade freezer jam. It has a runnier texture for easy spreading, and a super fresh taste.

This has received rave reviews from everyone who has tried the cookies. I am not a fan of taking the time to roll cookies, too much time out of my day! So, I mold the dough to be chilled into a rectangle or circle log, and cut it into slices after it has chilled. Then I proceed with cutting out shapes in one half of the slices. My cookies were smaller by choice, I had a lot of mouths to feed.

These cookies were wonderful. I made them for my husband's poker night and the men ate the 3 batches I made. The only thing I did differently was use strawberry jam for the hearts and diamonds and grape jam for the clubs and spades. (blackberry jam worked well too.) I got the cookie cutters at a place that was like a kitchen supply store Sur la Table). It was the first place I checked. Be creative when you make these. Have fun with it and they'll be a blast.

Ok, I haven't actually made these, but could someone tell me where I can get the cookie cutters? I've looked everywhere.
