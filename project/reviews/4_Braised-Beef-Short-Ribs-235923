This was outstanding and a huge hit with my fussy family. But, 1 hour of active cooking time is impossible. As noted, it took a lot of work, but was well worth the effort.

Okay it must have been the fact that I used beef stock not the veal demi. I saw that some of the other reviewers used beef stock so why was this only good and not great? it was so bland I had to throw everything in the spice cabinet into the pot to help this dish out. the extra balsamic was key. In the end it turned out to be good but not the fantastic dish I was hoping for.

Made this over the weekend as part of a fall-themed meal. I did not do the sencond bacon-vegetable part of this recipe, since I served the ribs over paprdelle with a mushroom sauce and didn't need extra sauce. This was good and I don't think I would have changed anything. I'm not a huge short ribs fan (has something to do with my mother forcing pot roast on me at a young age, which I always managed to sneak to the dog) but it was really fantastic side by side with the mushroom-sauce papardelle. I think that short ribs are so forgiving...you can basically just eye-ball it on a recipe as long as you follow the basic steps: brown the meat, sweat the aromatics, add a liquid, boil it down and braise the browned meat with it , low (heat) and long (time). you just have to OK with that pot-roast like texture, which still makes me cringe a just a tiny little bit. But the sauce is yummy.

I made this as a last minute dinner for my husband and I so did not have the fresh thyme but oterwise made the ribs per the recipe and it was very good. Will definitley make them again with the veg. I served with mashed which were perfect to soak up the sauce. I did not puree the sauce and cooked for 3 hours at 300 and they were fall off the bone and the consistency was good.

Excellent recipe - although I turned it into a short rib risotto dish. I didnt strain juices from short ribs but did skim some of the fat. I then added 1 1/4 cups of arborio rice to the juices and stirred for about 15 min. I shredded the short ribs and added them back to the rice while it was still a little soupy. I stirred for another 10 min until the rice absorbed most of the liquid and was tender. Delicious.

I just finished eating this for dinner - delicious, and perfect for a winter evening. I would have given it 3 forks, but I tweaked a few things to make it more to my liking, hence the 4 forks. I braised the meat at 300 degrees for 3 hours as suggested in another review. Might shorten that by 20 minutes next time. The meat fell apart easily and was good, but seemed to be lacking a little on flavor, so I added the solids back in with the shredded meat after removing the thyme and bay leaf. This added a lot of flavor and was perfect after the liquids were poured on top. I used boneless ribs instead of bone-in to cut down on the fat (I hardly had any fat to skim off). The time to reduce the liquids initially is more like 20 minutes, rather than 8. I served it over mashed potatoes since I didn't have time to make the vegetables in this recipe -tasted great! I will definitely make this again!

This gets five stars for flavour but only three for ease of use. This was a ton of work to follow to a T. It's very rich and incredibly fatty - I did it in one night and tried my best to skim as much fat as I could without refrigerating my sauce. I ended up using a slurry of cornstarch and red wine to thicken after straining the solids and the fat. Unlike other reviewers, I loved the bacony veg on the side. I loved the sweet bite the vinegar gave and the saltiness from the bacon rounded out the sauce. Overall delicious, but a once-a-year type meal here.

This is short rib heaven! I didn't bother making the veggie but just served the ribs over rice with it's awesome sauce (and my fave Kale as a side). Best dinner I've had in ages - and it's really easy to prepare. As another reviewer suggested, I braised mine in 300F for about 2-3 hrs and it was fall-off the bone. A definite keeper in my recipe box!

Rating: 4
Awesome recipe. Very easy. Used fewer carrots but whole can of chrushed tomatoes instead of just one cup which meant I could get away with only 3 cups of beef stock. cooked it at 300 and it was fall off the bone in 3 hours instead of 4 to 5. A real keeper!

This is simply an amazing short ribs recipe, have made it several times. Every taste is just breathtaking. Only change I make is going with a beef and vegetable broth instead of veal stock. Pretty simple to make.

Rating: 4
This was fabulous and I will definitely be making it again. I followed others' advice and made the short ribs two days before a dinner party. As soon as they were done, I cooled the ribs in the sauce, then took the layer of fat off the day of the party and cooked the veggies then. My sauce didn't take long at all to reduce, but the chicken stock on the onions and carrots did take quite a while to cook down. However, everyone raved and the last minute prep was very easy. I served with polenta and loved the combo.

Excellent! The changes I made: beef stock instead of veal and I omitted the garlic (because I don't like it). I also served some of the vegetables that cooked with the meat over polenta...AMAZING. My husband raved, I raved! I will absolutely be making this again and again and again!!

Excellent recipe. I read in Cooks Illustrated that bone in didn't add the extra flavor one might expect so I did boneless ribs (so none of that gross connective tissues around the bones). Made it a day ahead so I could refrigerate and take off the fat. There is a lot less fat with boneless than bone in so not sure this is even necessary for boneless. I strained the juice. I pureed the cooked vegetables and added them back in after boiling the strained sauce for 30+ minutes (which reduced but didn't thicken). Adding the pureed vegetables back is the best way to thicken and enhance flavor without flour, cornstarch, gelatin. 250 seemed to low compared to other recipes. Used 300 for 3 hours (should have gone longer) The vegetable part of the recipe is nice. I used baby carrots and frozen pearl onions, but following the recipe for the rest. Reheated on the stove then put in a crock pot till time to serve.

This was delicious and flavorful. However the sauce overwhelmed the meat flavor. I thought the shortibs were so tender and good that they could have stood out on their own, and the strong sauce flavor was really at the forefront of the dish. Would probably try some other recipes with a milder sauce before making this one again.

I made this dish without pork products or butter, and it came out fine. Really delicious in fact, and the guests raved. Also I didn't realize how much demi glace I had to buy, so used some of it and some good chicken stock.

Excellent recipe, superb flavor! Perfect dish for company! We followed the directions to the t, with the exception of using beef stock in lieu of veal stock. We served the ribs over poelnta and creamy braised leeks. As others have pointed out, the shortrib sauce is rather thin, so pouring it over the polenta was a winning move. You don't *need* the bacony-vegetables, but they are a nicely matched side.

I made this recipe yesterday and it was fabulous! I recently ordered beef short ribs at the Dilworthtown Inn and they were so delicious I decided to try to make them at home. These ribs were just as good at the ribs I ordered there at over $30 an entree! I made just under five pounds and it served six people with generous portions. This is definitely company fare as it takes all day to make. It's not so labor intensive other than you have to be home to keep an eye on everything. I didn't make the vegetables to go along side of the ribs. I just chopped the onion, carrots and garlic and after it cooked in the sauce. I used my immersion blender like someone else suggested. I had to boil down the sauce until it thickened which took forty-five minutes. I kept an eye on it making sure it didn't stick but it didn't. It was so tasty that it was liquid gold...I wasn't going to ruin it at this point! I used my crock pot to keep it warm while I was boiling down the sauce. This worked well..I just put a little bit of the sauce in with it to keep it moist. I served it with mashed potatoes. Delicious!!

This was delicious. Only substitution was beef stock for veal stock. For the vegetables I sauteed the pearl onions and mushrooms - each separately - and added at the very end. I thickened the sauce with 2T butter/2T flour mashed together and it made the sauce beautifully thick with a gorgeous shine. Everyone loved this.

The ribs were awesome. You don't need the vegetables - they are a lot of work and not that flavorful. Skip them and serve the ribs over pasta with a side of something else (although nothing else is needed). I followed the ribs recipe to the T and they were amazing. I've also made with pork using beef stock and they were outstanding then too. Use a good bottle of wine - it's worth it.

There is absolutely no need for the vegetables used as a side. They are fine but add nothing to the short ribs. That being said, i made the short ribs exactly as described and they were out of this world! I made a day in advance and the next day reheated for a few hours in a crock pot on low. I added in dry fat noodles in the 30 minutes on high (tagliatelle - sorry if misspelled!). Served with a side of dark bread and everyone was in heaven. The veggies? We ate them later after the short ribs were long gone. I didn't think they were especially interesting flavor wise and would not waste my time making them the next time.

Rating: 4
I agree with previous reviewers: cut all vegetables at the same time, even if you braise a day ahead; bacon isn't necessary; there's too much liquid; definitely use frozen pearl onions. Still haven't figured out how to thicken sauce -- maybe just blend non-strained vegetables with a hand blender.

A wonderful recipe! I did use less sauce on the vegetables. I don't think this compromised the taste. Serve the sauce on the side...yummy! I did make the ribs ahead to remove the fat. I'm really glad I took the time for this step.I warmed the ribs & sauce & then placed the ribs in my crock pot to keep warm until I served. I used the immersion blender to the sauce & found that it thickened beautifully. Will make this again!

I was immediately interested in this recipe after reading the ingredients, but nervous to attempt it after reading all of the reviews. Instead of following the advice of the other reviews, I decided to follow the recipe as close to the written way as possible. I DID NOT need 2 days to make it. It took me about 1.5 hours of active cooking/prepping time. I did make one major change. I cooked the short ribs in a Crock-Pot on low for about 8 hours on the low-10 hour setting and they turned out PERFECT! Also, I used beef stock as I could not find veal stock or Demi-Glace in my local grocery store and I used red wine vinegar. I took the short ribs out of the Crock-Pot and placed them in a warm oven after 8 hours. I removed all of the liquid from the Crock-Pot and transferred it to a sauce pan and boiled the liquid from the short ribs for about 45 mins on medium high, until it reduced to about 3 cups. It thickened up beautifully and was extremely tasty! Meanwhile, I cooked the vegetables (using about 16 baby portabella mushrooms) and made Horseradish and Garlic Mashed Potatoes (a lovely side to this dish!). I used frozen pearl onions and it was perfectly fine. When the carrots were tender, I removed all of the vegetables from the sauce pan and set aside. I boiled the liquid from the vegetables on medium-high for about 30 mins, in order to reduce the liquid. It reduced, but not as much as I would have wanted it to, so I discarded all but 1 cup of the liquid. I added 1 cup of the reduced short rib liquid and mixed it with the vegetables. Instead of discarding the short rib liquid or saving it for another use, I dipped each short rib in it to give them a wet/glazed look before platting them and I served the remaining liquid in a gravy dish. I served it with Regusci Cabernet Sauvignion (2005). This dish was such a hit! This will be my go-to beef short rib recipe!

Rating: 4
The short ribs are easy - it simply takes planning earlier in the day to get them in the oven, braising, early enough that they'll be ready for dinner. I made mashed potatoes to serve with them, which works well. I did the onions and carrots, but not the mushrooms, as we have a mushroom-avoider in the family. I think it would have been fine without the veggies, just using what had braised with the ribs. Skipping those would cut down on the time, too. I did use frozen pearl onions, which helped.

Made these tonight, started this morning, and didn't find them all that difficult or time consuming. I wish I had leftovers to find out if the flavors melded more after a day, but alas, they are all gone. I followed some of the advice of the other reviewers, added something of my own, and now these will be staple in our house. I used only 2 cups stock (used beef cuz the store didn't have veal) and only 1 cup chix stock for veggies. For the ribs, I used a whole 14-oz can of tomatoes (pureed). There was plenty of liquid for to braise the meat and tenderize the veggies. To the veggies, I added fingerlings before I added the onion (used frozen pearl onions and worked out fine) and omitted mushrooms. The bacon was not needed as the veggies and sauce both have plenty of flavor. I will not bother with bacon next time. When you don't need bacon to make a dish taste good, that's a tasty dish. Agreed that this is restaurant quality and will definitely make again. Soon!

With a little adjusting, this is actually a very easy recipe. Sauteed the onions,carrots(cut into large chunks, and garlic in a separate pan while browning the ribs in the dutch oven. Dust with flour first, then discard the fat from the ribs. Add the vegies to the meat. The recipe calls for too much liquid. I used 2 TBSP of tomato paste instead of the canned tomatoes, and reduced the stock to 2 cups. (Used Better than Buillon beef). I think straining the sauce from the veggies and then remaking veggies is a waste. I loved the bigger chunks of the slow cooked carrots.Served with creamy polenta-great

Rating: 3
This is a fine, strong recipe that allows room to 'play' with some of the details. First, I decided to taste the vegetables from the stock before throwing them away, and they actually were very flavorful from their simmering in the stock. Second, I found that the stock was thin and pretty difficult to reduce to a proper sauce consistency, but still delicious. I'll work on that. These, however, are nits. The recipe is strong and the result was wonderful.

Rating: 4
Splendid. Time consuming, but well worth it. Braise a day before. (I didn't leave the beef in the sauce overnight, but probably would next time.) I would also prep ALL vegetables at the beginning, rather than in stages. Once you've got the cutting board and knife out, might as well do everything. Meat braised, and veggies prepped one day before, and the recipe becomes a snap on the day of dinner. Two things to watch out for: 1) if you plan on making the meal in one day, there will be tons of fat in the sauce when it's done braising. you can use a fat separator OR, as I did, throw the sauce in the freezer for 30 minutes while the veggies glaze. The fat will congeal at the top. 2) according to the recipe it takes 20+ minutes to reduce the stock when cooking the vegetables. that is wayyyy off. use less stock, or do not cover when you cook. i haven't found the perfect solution, but am surprised by how wrong the recipe gets this. served with potato and parsnip mash on the side. it is a wonderful, crowd pleasing meal that will have your guests demanding seconds.

This flavors of this recipe are fantastic. The vegetables are especially good. The meat is fall off the bone tender. HOWEVER, it was very labor intensive. It took me most of Sunday afternoon to make. The meat must be browned, the mushrooms and bacon must be cooked separately, the onions and carrots have to sautéed and then the liquid must be reduced to nothing. If you start a day early and prepare the various components, then the whole recipe can be prepared in the oven 4-5 hours before the meal.

This is a fantastic short rib recipe. It's hard to make bad braised short ribs but this just had a beautiful flavor with the wine and the demi glace. It does make a ton of sauce though. I followed another reviewers recommendation and just used my immersion blender to puree everything after I took the meat out. This worked out perfectly. I'm replacing my old favorite short rib recipe with this one.

Delicious and tastes similar to Julia's boeuf bourguignon with a little (not a lot) less work. I'm not sure what the "more elegant presentation" refers to because after so many hours in the oven, the meat falls off the bone so it looks like boeuf bourguignon. It would be interesting to do a side by side comparison between this recipe and Julia's.

We have made these Short Ribs many times and we have tried several others but always gravitate back to this one, it's Awesome. I like to get my ribs cut with the bone, so that each rib is about 8-10 inches long, also known as the "English Cut" full of flavor. Kids would eat this every day if offered. The Demi-Glace is expensive but worth it. Made brown veal stock last week lot's of work and about the 1/2 the price of Demi-Glace

My first attempt at short ribs. Yum. Pretty much followed the recipe with these exceptions (largely gleaned from others' reviews): Used 14 oz San Marzano crushed tomatoes. Added a tablespoon or so of Worcestershire sauce after bringing crushed tomatoes to a boil. Used my trusty Oxo fat separator for removing fat, pushing veggies through its strainer, then tossed the "squozed" veggies into the saucepan with the defatted sauce and used my submersible blender to combine it all. Made a lovely, thick sauce. Just yummy.

I used 3 1/2 # for two people. Just the right amount for 2. I chose to follow other reviewer's suggestion and make the meat portion on Day 1. Followed all but added 14 ounces pureed tomatoes instead of 8 oz. Day 2: easy to break off the fat that rose to the top. I removed the meat from the veggie and liquid, and pushed the mixture thru a fine mesh strainer, using the back of a wooden spoon to get all the liquid out. Then, reduced the liquid. Was reducing sloooowly, so added about 2 TBS balsamic vinegar, and thickened with Wondra. Absolutely fabulous.

Rating: 4
absolutely delicious! It does take time, but it's completely worth it. The only change I made, was that I ran out of steam toward the end and therefore, rather than straining the sauce, I boiled it down and then used an immersion blender to thicken and smooth it before adding the vegetables. Delicious, elegant and a huge hit. The sauce is enough for significantly more servings, so now I'm going to get creative the rest of the weekend.

Excellent!! Great romantic dinner - and makes the house smell incredible. Well worth the time and effort. We cooked it in the oven for 4 hours and the meat was so tender the bones were all detached! We added more mushrooms and less onions, and used basic tomatoes and real beef stock. Otherwise we followed it exactly. Served over some fluffy mashed potatoes with grainy mustard, cheese, and parsley added.... divine!

absolutely delightful! I had less time, so I roasted this at 300 degrees for 3.5 hours. skipped the vegetables part, and made glazed carrots and roasted asparagus for side dishes (so SOMETHING on our plates was healthy!) also, if you have an immersion blender, it's really easy at the end of the recipe, to strain about half the braising sauce, then blend the unstrained part (take out the bay leaf and thyme sprigs) and add this to the strained sauce to thicken it, rather than boil it down.

Rating: 4
This was delicious. The meat was falling apart tender and the sauce was really flavorful. Like many reviewers, I used beef stock instead of veal, as that's what I had; I don't think it made a huge difference. The sauce is thin and requires quite a bit of reducing. I made the meat the day before so I could skim the fat, and I strongly recommend this. I have to disagree with those reviewers who thought that prep time was too long. The vegetables for the sauce can be chopped in a processor; they'll turn to mush anyway. The worst job is peeling the onions. It was more work than I'd usually put in for a weeknight, but it wasn't dinner party level fussy.

I had an epiphany with short ribs - buy the boneless ones which are widely available. They are wayyyy better. also - make these a day ahead or even two. separate the ribs from the liquid to skim the fat. once the fat is skimmed pour over the ribs on the second day and warm for a few hrs at 250.

I have tried making short ribs a few ways. All have been labor intensive and expensive. After trying again with this recipe, although the flavor is good, not worth the effort. I will stick with a pot roast from now on. Just as good, melt in your mouth beef for a lot less money and effort.

Quite the crowd pleaser...made this for 6 people and it is quite labor intensive but provides the taste reward. I increased sauce by 1/2 which means you need to allow about an hour for that to cook down after taking out the ribs. I would double the mushrooms and bacon next time...otherwise this one got rave rave rave reviews.

I love short ribs, but I always assumed that they were very difficult to make--but not with this recipe! I asked the butcher to cut the ribs in half, which made the whole process easier and made them more attractive on the plate. Used 3 cloves garlic instead of 2, only 2 cups of chicken stock--could not find veal stock--and about 1/2 cup of pomegranate juice. Added some water later. Only took 3.5 hours to cook at about 275-300 degrees. Skimmed off the fat the next morning and it was delicious. I bypassed the vegetable part. The short ribs are very rich and this recipe easily could serve 5 people, possible 6 with smaller portions.

Making this again for the second time - what a fabulous recipe - I agree very forgiving. Actually using some the "jus" leftover from last time that I had frozen. This is a good bit of work, but not that bad. To the cook who halved recipe - don't do that! If anything increase and freeze, you then have something lovely tucked in freezer for when you don't feel like cooking. I also like to cook my vegetables in with the braise for about the last 1 1/2 hour or so - just delicious! A definite keeper!

I skipped the vegetables part and improvised a bunch of replacements to manage with what I had at home, but it came out wonderfully and I think would do with the originals or various other changes -- very resilient recipe. Changes: - 3 carrots instead of 4 - 4 large shallots instead of 1 onion - added 2 small ribs celery - 4 cloves garlic instead of 2 - added 1 tbsp tomato paste and fried it then stirred in, after the carrots/onion were soft. - instead of 4c veal stock, used combo of chicken/veggie stocks I had around and some more red wine. Cooked for 4 hours at 265 degrees. Fabulous! In some ways I might even prefer this to the Daniel Boulud version (and it's certainly a lot cheaper to make without using six bottles of wine!)

Would someone tell me what I did incorrectly. Because we are only two people, I halved the recipe. Cooked it about 4.5 hours and ended up with little to no sauce. Mind you what is there is divine! Has anyone else tried halving the recipe? And if so, what corrections did you make?

Made this for my wife the other night and the beef turned out very tender. The sauce from the braising made excellent gravy in both flavor and consistency! The veggies were so good we decided that we'd make those to go with other dinners too! Some reviewers had the suggestion of letting the mixture cool over night and removing the fat. I did not do this but would recommend it as the flavor of the beef itself would have been better if it had time to set. Overall fun to make, smells great and I'd make it again!

This was such a great recipe! I made this for 8 people for Christmas Dinner. With that said, I would do the following differently the next time- and there definitely will be a next time, sooner rather than later: As others have mentioned, prepare this a day or two in advance- having leftovers last night attested to the more complex flavors having melded together over night- amazing! I felt that the sauce needed a bit more complexity so I added a few tablespoons of Worchestershire Sauce, and maybe 1/4 c of dark Brown Sugar. Reducing the sauce at the end did take too long for my very hungry guests- the aromas from the kitchen were driving everyone crazy. So, I added the traditional flour/water mixture and thickened it- no harm done and it was perfect! There was an amazing amount of sauce, and the left over is now resting in my freezer until a lovely piece of meat calls for it. Well worth the time to make this but give yourself enough time.

I made the beef on Thursday, braised for 5 hours, then cooled the meat andthe sauce in separate containers and removed the fat from the top of the sauce on Friday afternoon. I cooked the veggies and reduced the sauce, combined veggies, meat and sauce together, and left on super low heat on the stove until my guests were ready to eat. Fabulous! We all sat around, slightly stunned by how absolutely perfect those flavors are. I've made boeuf bourguignon many times, but I'v always felt that the stew meat was the weak part: Neither I nor my butchers seem able to keep the cubes of equal size due to fat running through it or just the shape of cut. Three of the six short ribs lost their bones during the second warming period, but they were still lovely and easy to portion. I did make this recipe with 6 ribs (4.5 lb) without running short on sauce, and I followed everything pretty much to the letter. Okay, I added another slice of bacon, but I couldn't help myself there. I will definitely make again, and I would encourage home cooks to consider braised dishes like this one for entertaining. By the time your guests arrive, most everything is done and you can be relaxed and enjoy their company. I served over mashed potatoes, but would also consider parsleyed egg noodles or polenta just for a change. We also had light appetizers, a sliced fennel and orange salad on the side, and a good sour batard, followed by bananas foster for dessert. The whole meal was great, but it's the beef that we kept talking about the next day.

Good but not great. My guests enjoyed it (and the gorgonzola creamy polenta) but I thought that it was only "good" and not really worth the two days you have to spend with it.

Great variation on beef bourguignon. Next time I would add the vegetable mixture to the sauce during the last 45 minutes of cooking (and skip the extra liquids and vinegar used for boiling to a glaze- just brown your bacon and add your peeled and blanched onions and carrots (baby carrots work well), rather than making separately- The smokiness of the bacon will add further depth to the sauce. I separated the sauce from the meat and let it cool it overnight to make removing the fat easier, strained it and reduced and added the meat and veggies back in during the last 15 minutes or so of reheating. I braised at 300 for three hours- perfect. Would give 3.5 stars if that were an option.

This is one of the best things I have ever made. I would suggest cooking this the day before, refigerating so the flavors combine, removing the fat the next day and braising for another hour. Refrigerating will cause a thick layer of congealed fat to form-it is much easier to remove the fat this way. The meat melts in your mouth and the flavor is complex. I could not find veal stock--just used beef--and I don't feel the flavor was compromised.

Flavor is great. Prep work a bit excessive. Braising at higher temp in oven would save time without decreasing flavor/tenderness. Sauce was way too watery, needing either a roux or extended reduction. Probably too much stock during braising.

Where in the Oct 06 issue is this recipe? I don't find it listed in the index, and don't find it in "You asked for it...", so where the heck is this recipe in the mag? (seems silly to print it if I have it already)

Classic short ribs dish. Didn't have the ubertime alloted in the recipe, so turned the oven up to a reasonable 300 and cooked it for about 3 hours. Removed from oven, chilled for the next morning, reheated and strained the sauce from the pot into a large measuring cup then chilled this and took off the fat cap. Returned the sauce to the beef and served it that night. Served with polenta. Excellent.

Good but not fabulous. Very time-consuming.

Had I read the recipe more carefully I might have started preparing it earlier than 4pm for dinner that night. Having said that, it was well worth the wait. Didn't change a thing and won't the next time I make it.

Spending a cool fall day surrounded by the smells of braising short ribs almost makes up for the fact that the golf season is almost over. Comfort food makes the off seasom almost bearable!!

To the cook in search of veal stock, I find demi-glace concentrate in the soups and broth section of many gourmet and natural food stores (e.g., Whole Foods and Wild Oats). It comes in a small, flat, disc-like container, and is labeled demi-glace. It also comes in chicken, vegetable and seafood versions. For what it's worth, at times I've substituted half of the stock in this recipe with the chicken version because I was short on veal stock, and it tastes just as good.

I'm a bit of a short rib freak and always looking for THE great recipe. This one just might be it. The extremely low-temp braise and perfectly balanced acidity of the sauce seem to be the hot ticket. I don't think I would change a thing and, in fact, I plan to adapt my braising recipes for other meats to this one.

Where can I find veal stock? I live in a university town with several organic food and international food shops, but no luck with veal stock. Any suggestions?

This was wonderful. My husband commented on the wonderful aromas coming from the kitchen as I did the veggies and reheated the beef. I was unable to open my new bottle of wine vinegar so I just doubled up on the balsamic vinegar. Also, the beef was falling off the bone after 3 hours in the oven, so be sure to check!

This was time-consuming, but not difficult. The prep work is straightforward and the ingredients are available in your local grocery store. I started too late in the evening ended up having to set my alarm for 3 a.m. to get up and take the beef out of the oven. Start earlier in the day! The flavors are delicious. Overall a great recipe for a low-key night in but elegant and delicious enough for a dinner party. Simply divine!

To make this dish properly, you should prepare it two days before you plan to serve it. When you let the beef and sauce marry in the fridge, the dish will develope unimaginable levels of flavor. Classic...

This recipe is cleary a restaurant dish in that the prep work and time required is not the typical for normal "sunday night fare." Being a culinary school refugee I was more than up to the challenge! In the end, it is MORE than worth the time and labor. It is truly wonderful (and I mean like 4 michelin stars at home wonderful). Next time I will likely braise the ribs a day ahead of time, not to save on cooking time, but so I can skim some of the fat out of the sauce. To add to the decadence, I did chocolate souffles for desert, and it was an evening not to be soon forgotten.
