I have to say this was pretty darn good. I simplified by not chopping the 1C of peas and I just blended everything in one go. I also added mint. Light, easy and simple. I will make it again

I added an extra cup of shelled peas to the puree, along with lots of garlic. Yumm! Great hot the first time, and great cold as a salad, too!

Next time, I would still double the salt -- but not the garlic (wow -- what a kick!). Good way to get more veggies into the kiddos.

Very quick recipe. We added some store-roasted chicken breast to make it more of a one-bowl meal.

used whole wheat pasta, which gave this dish a heartier dimension, which i think is needed. this dish really relies on the uncooked garlic for its flavor, so make sure you add acoording to your taste preference - it can get spicy. for the leftovers the next day, i freshened it up by adding some sauteed cut grape tomatoes with a splash of balsamic - pretty darn good!

This dish was great. I halved it but added extra garlic per recommendations and it was delicious. I would also recommend chilling and serving as a cold pasta salad.

I thought this was a great accompaniment to a whole lemon rosemary roasted chicken dish we made last night. It is perfect for a spring meal. I added extra garlic and parmesean since it was a little bland at first. I may try roasting the garlic first next time, as it was a little spicy for our taste. Also, I would use a medium sieve so the pressed peas aren't too liquidy.

This dish is easy to make. The flavor is light, almost to the point of being bland, even though I added extra garlic. If I made it again I would add more garlic, more cheese, and maybe some other seasonings. I added grape tomatoes and some extra blanched snap peas, and that end up being my favorite thing about this recipe - the combination of textures with crisp vegetables and soft pasta. It works either warm or as a cold pasta salad.

The pasta looks nice if you cut the peas on an angle so they are pointy like the penne. I followed the recipe as directed, and it was good. Not anything fancy, but a simple yummy spring dish.

Quick, easy and yummy - a great way to use up an overabundance of garden snap peas.
