This not a Maltese recipe. Maltese love their chicken stuffed and sealed in a rich broth, finished roasted in an oven and served with roast potatoes.

So, I changed this around, and it came out very good with some rice! I marinated chicken thighs with lots of red wine, tons of garlic, some pepper and olive oil. Then, I fried up some yellow onion, and dredged the chicken in flour, frying it in that. Added one thinly sliced zucchini, more liquid from the marinade as the chicken cooked, and some honey. It needed a little more sald than I had put in, but overall, came out very good, particularly the sauce. Next time I will marinade overnight instead of just for a few hours to get more flavor in the chicken, but overall,a good recipe to play with.

It was nice to finally see attention paid to Maltese cuisine. Unfortunately, people seem to get the wrong idea on how things are properly done. If anything good comes out of this recipe is the fact that I rarely see or hear from this many Maltese people without it being from my own family gatherings.

I have to agree with my Maltese counterparts that this is definitely not a traditional Maltese dish, and we do not eat rabbit on the beach, but rather hobz biz-zejt(delicious tuna sandwiches). I have not tried the recipe, as I feel traditional Maltese rabbit is much better than this - especially without the honey.

I decided to try this recipe despite the comments and low rating. I used chicken thighs and added two teaspoons of chopped fresh thyme with the red wine and honey. I also browned the chicken without the cover on and then covered the pan for the last ten minutes. I thought the result was delicious -- one of those 4 ingredient (chicken, red wine, honey, thyme) wonders. I'll certainly make it again.

I haven't made this recipe, but hailing from Malta, living in Malta, and being an avd cook I can say this: Neither Maltese Chicken nor rabbit is made with honey, however, Honey IS used in Maltese Main courses (i.e. with liver.)

This is nothing like you would find on the beaches of Malta. Honey is not an ingredient the Maltese people would use in main course dishes.

A very boring and flavorless dish. Definitely not close to Maltese cuisine; adapting a recipe using honey with chicken.

Recipe was simple but recipe does not add a lot of flavor over just eating plain chicken. Dryer chicken also due to frying it up.

Being Maltese this is a bit disappointing as it is not authentic. Maltese dont tend to cook with honey and the orginal version would be chicken or rabbit marinated overnight in red wine and garlic and then stewed with vegetables and served with pasta. Quite a tasty dish but unfortunately this is not reflected here. Try marinating with red wine and frying in garlic and then adding shredded onion, tomatoes, tomatoe puree, bay leaves and at the end peas. The sauce should be thick - you could also add some potatoes. Yummy

I made this when this issue came out, but since there are no reviews, thought I'd cast back in my memory for fellow recipe flash readers. This was very fast and easy to make. It gets points for that, plus it was different from a standard chicken with red wine kind of recipe. However, we thought it overall lacked complexity. I will try it again, but will definitely tinker: thyme and possibly garlic and some finely chopped onion seem like they would make this much more flavorful.
