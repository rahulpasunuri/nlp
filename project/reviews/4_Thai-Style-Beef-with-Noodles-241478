This was awesome! I took other reviewers advice and added shiitakes. I also added pea pods to increase the veggies and doubled the broth. The flavor was great. Finally, I added pressed garlic to the marinade, leaving the meat in it for about two hours. A bit of prep with all of the chopping, but worth it.

Also forgot to add that I added shittakes, which did help the flavor.

Good dish...not fabulous. Surprised this is a blue ribbon recipe. I used a good flank steak, and marinated it overnight. Used udon noodles as well.

I thought this was a great recipe but having read all the other reviews I tweaked it a little. First I marinated the beef for a day. Next I doubled the proportion of ginger, chili paste and lime. Then I added cilantro and kaffir lime leaves. It was really, really good. Will definitely make again.

I like to add some bean sprouts, extra lime cilantro and thai chilis at the end.

This was an excellent, and easy restaurant quality recipe. The soup broth was quite good, which I doubled to make a main course for 4 people. I used rice noodles instead of egg noodles and it turned out great. I also sauteed sliced crimini mushrooms in a tbsp of vegetable oil and added that on top for more variety. My 10 year old said she didn't like it -- she *loved* it and there was nothing left at the end of the meal. Served with steamed rice.

Thie recipe sounded really delicious but wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be. I think the meat needs to marinate longer (a couple of hours rather than 20 min), and needs more 'oomph' esp. for a Thai dish. Next time, I might add some other vegetables -- as well and more scallions and more Thai green-curry paste. We used Sriricha sauce which added a kick/spice which the dish really needed.

The marinade was good and easy. I didn't try the noodles. Next time. It wasn't exceptional but good.

Great receipe. I think next time i'd add some shitaki mushrooms and a little bit of crushed red pepper flakes. Definately a keeper though.

Absolutely delicious recipe. This is the type of dish that will leave you craving it a few days after you make it for the first time. This is simple to make, though I would warn you to CLOSELY watch the shallots when sautéing them in the first stage. They can go from nicely browned to blackened and unusable in the blink of an eye! I would suggest low heat for this step. As for the beef, I have used several cuts, with flank or tri-tip being my favorite. I usually marinate them longer,(4-6 hrs) then just cook on the grill while broth is simmering. You gonna like it!

I made this to take to our Wine Tasting Club last night & it was excellent! I did add 2 cloves of garlic, I used flat iron steak, I used Karo syrup because I didn't have any honey & I used angel hair pasta. I was looking for a recipe to serve with the Merlot wine that I had selected for our November Wine Tasting & found this one. (Love that Epicurious recommends wine to go with many of the recipes!) It smelled so good while it was cooking & it tasted just as good!! Everyone wants the recipe...definitely a keeper

Not bad, but the overall dish was tangy-er than I would have preferred. I'm considering trying again with red curry paste and seeing if that gives it a more robust flavor. That being said, it's just my personal taste. I can see how others would enjoy this dish immensely.

This is very good. My husband loved it. I would not change a thing to the broth. I would add more vegetables, and probably change the noodle to udon. Other than that, I will make this again and again.

Delicious! It was wonderful to be able to create these flavors at home. Was not exactly a speedy dish to put together for a weeknight meal, but worth it in the end. Definitely add garlic and mushrooms per other reviewer's suggestions.

This is a great, easy recipe. I've made it 4 or 5 times now. It works great with any vegetables you have on hand. My favorite way to prepare it is with roasted asparagus and mushrooms. I also add some minced garlic when I saute the ginger and I add a bit of red wine after I saute the ginger/garlic/green chili paste, before adding the broth. I think it adds a bit of depth to the broth

Absolutely delicious. It's too cold in Denver right now to pull out the grill so adapted this for indoor cooking (broiled the steak; roasted the vegetables at 450 for 8-10 mins). Like others suggested I added quartered mushrooms -- also added in about 7 whole garlic cloves to the vegetable roast. Important: Drizzled each bowl with a little bit of sesame oil and a garnish of fresh cilantro right before serving. Devine!!

The broth was great. I could have just eaten it and the noodles together. Even the kids ate it (picky eaters). I will try it next time with some stir-fry veggies.

This was outstandingly delicious and easy and I know we will be eating it again many more times, although it was an insufficient amount of broth - - only enough for 2 dinner servings (with some leftover beef), which was fine because only my husband and I ate tonight. In future, I will increase all the broth ingredients. I substituted Agave nectar for the honey, red curry for the green, thin linguine for the Asian egg noodles, and skirt steak for the flank because that's what I had on hand. As recommended in several of the reviews, I also sauteed a half pound box of shitake mushrooms along with the red bell pepper and scallions. Because we like spicy food, I tripled the amount of curry. It is a wonderful dish!

I liked this meal alot. And it actually kept well enough to have leftovers. I used udon noodles instead of egg noodles and next time I would add more broth, there wasn't enough for my liking.

Wow, what a hit!!! I added more green curry paste then called for almost triple. We absolutely loved this dish. Just need more forks to rate with as four doesn't do it justice.

So good and a welcomed change of pace for a weeknight dinner. Who needs take-out? Will be adding the mushrooms next time, as I could have used more veggies. Also used Soba noodles because they're better at soaking up all that great broth.

Yum Yum Yum. Very good. Amazingly good. I added two cloves of garlic with the ginger, grilled my steak outside, and pan sauteed the peppers and scallions. A very good recipe. Will be making again for sure.

I felt like this recipe needed one more ingredient to make it completely satisfying. Perhaps next time I'll add some garlic to the mix. I did add mushrooms I had on hand which my family liked. Will try again with a few changes.

I really liked this recipe and it was easy and warming for a fall night. I BBQ's my steak M-R instead of frying it and used chinese cabbage, shitake mushrooms and buckwheat noodles. The next day I added some coconut milk to extend the broth and it was fabulous.

The broth for this dish is superb. I used red curry paste (and at least a tsp. extra) because it's what I had in the pantry. We rarely eat beef, but this is a winner.

So good! This was a bit spicy for my 3-year-old daughter, so I didn't add broth to her noodles and steak, just a little soy sauce. My husband and I enjoyed the heat.

This is the easiest, and most delicious thai dish i've ever made, and my 5 yr. old loved it! - add dried mushrooms for even more flavor. I'm going to try this with chicken tommorrow

Really good. I used flat iron steak instead of flank and added about half a pound of shitake mushrooms. I felt that even with the addition of the mushrooms it could have used a higher ratio of veggies to other ingredients to make it healthier. My husband and I both added some Sriracha to our portions, so next time I will just add it to the whole dish, since we like things a little spicy. I grilled both the meat and veggies outdoors.

Very versatile recipe. I didnt have flank steak, so I used center cut pork loin which I sliced thin ~1/2 inch before marinating. I added some fresh, sliced shitake mushrooms which added a nice flavor and a contrasting texture. I also used Udon noodles. The kids can't wait for me to make this one again. Thanks!

I really liked this recipe! I increased the curry because we like our Asian food spicy, but I think next time I would use the previously- recommended Siracha instead because the curry flavor was a little overwhelming. I added water chestnuts and a some raw bean sprouts and cilantro on top. Definitely will be making this again.

Wonderful flavors. Will make it spicier next time. Used white onion as I did not want to make a trip to the store.

We loved this recipe. As suggested by another cook I added asparagus, which added a lovely flavor. We will make this again and again!

My shallots were not so big, so I added sliced red onion to make up the difference. Also, I added about 3/4 lb of asparagus, grilled, to the vegetables. I highly recommend this addition. Also, I didn't have the Chinese noodles, so I substituted regular fine linguine which tasted great.

Each week we have a gathering of friends at our house and I cook for them. They make requests (in return they bring the wine!) and this has become their most requested meal. A sophisticated tasting meal that's easy to prepare. I'm a fan.

This meal was very flavorful. My husband and I had seconds. What I liked most about this dish is that I could accommodate my picky kids. I just sliced the flank steak for them and gave them plain noodles and a few raw carrot sticks. They were happy and my husband and I were happy.

Delicious! Used thin cut sirloin since it was on sale and there was no flank steak. It was perfect, hubby called this one a keeper!

I am inexperienced in making Thai food but I had fish sauce and some red curry paste I bought and was waiting to try. I love my butcher, so my flank steak was very tender. The marinade! Wow! It is so simple and delicious, that I'd use just that part of the recipe. I had some organic soy ginger broth, from Trader Joe's that I used instead of beef broth. I added all the ingredients, except ginger (obviously). This was really delicious and took 30 minutes from start to finish. This is going to be a keeper. Loved it!

This was a delicious meal. I added extra green curry paste and crushed red pepper for more kick. I would try a different cut of meat next time - the flank steak was not as tender as I would have liked. I didn't have honey, just used splenda and it still turned out great.
