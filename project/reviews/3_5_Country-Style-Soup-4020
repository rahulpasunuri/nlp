Since this recipe seemed to have "subtle" flavor, I substituted chicken stock for half of the water. I also substituted collard greens for the cabbage and lettuce. This made for a very flavorful and still healthy soup.

This recipe was a complete waste of time. Don't waste any parmesan cheese in this recipe. I followed the recipe. There was no seasoning, so there was no flavour. The savoy cabbage was overpowering and sucked up the juices. I had never used dried fava beans before. They were very time consuming peeling to get ready for this recipe. They also lacked flavour. Now I'm wondering what I can do to save this.

Okay, I was hungry and wanted to shorten it up a bit,,, I sauted the chopped vegs along with fennel and 1 red potato. Added the water and later added a can of white Italian beans. Fast, simple and got comfort food without meat and fuss. Very nice even without garlic and herbs...

Great Northern beans are an American variety of white bean, available in the USA either dried or in cans. I suspect any dried white bean would work equally well, or take the quick way, as mentioned before, and use any canned white beans which have been rinsed and drained. Of course, if you have access to those wonderful Tuscan white beans, they would be the perfect substitute.

Can anyone tell me what a UK translation for Great Northern Beans is please?

Used canned beans also, rinsed them, and added to boiling water at beginning. The canned beans cut down on cooking time. This is a great recipe, wonderful comfort food. Did add mozarella, parmesan cheese, but no olive oil at end.

A wonderful soup! With little time to prepare this dish, I drained and rinsed canned beans and added them in the last twenty minutes. It worked fine! Also, boston lettuce was a good substitution for bibb. The cheese and olive oil at the end are the crowning touch.

astoundingly good--I had to resist my normal inclination to add touches. Served hot with salt and pepper and good reggiano cheese it is really wonderful
