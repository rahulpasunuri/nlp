Every year, I plant a few sugar pumpkin seeds, and harvest the small, brilliant colored fruits after the first frost. Because pumpkin is time-consuming to cook, one finds a place at the table for Sunday dinner. I didn't have prunes handy, so I substituted currants, which don't puree well, so they were sprinkled on top, after preparing as directed. A smooth and delicious accompaniment to Swedish meatballs.

Really good! I previewed this tonight, and it's definitely going on my holiday table. Very dramatic!
