These are delicious and quick to throw together. If you can't get plums, try prunes. Very popular with my daughter. Enjoy!

Solid recipe. Really liked the sweet/spicy mix. Try it with Boston lettuce for a healthier wrap. Made the following changes: Skip the plum - why bother? Add some more cayenne or a dash of chili garlic sauce. Chop the chicken, add all the marinade and cook in saucepan - the oven is a pain. Add shredded carrots, napa cabbage, and some mung bean sprouts for extra crunch.

This was easy and different. I enjoyed it but my 3 yr. old was not.

I wrapped it in romaine, served it with rice. I also used low sodium soy sauce, I think regular would have been too salty

I got thumbs-up from my gang on this recipe. I thought the flavor was good but I felt like something was missing. I did follow suggestions from other reviewers like, making additional sauce and adding lettuce. Next time I think I will add to the recipe i.e. bell pepper, cuccumber or maybe even cabbage for a little more crunch.

Definitely add lettuce and make a 1/2 more on the sauce. Very good - easy to make with interesting flavors - I used cut up chicken breasts instead of thighs.

This was a fun-to-eat meal thanks to the wraps. The chicken was tender but could have used more seasoning. The sauce however was kicked up by adding more dried chili pepper. And the sliced scallion complimented every bite.

This dish was just ok - the chicken should be marinated to really get the flavor, otherwise it's too bland. Ours also dried out, so be careful not to overcook. The sauce was great, but we ran out before we were finished. I also recommend using iceberg lettuce instead of tortillas or pancakes - gave this a much-needed moisture boost!

This dish is super-easy to double or triple, and with some fried rice, this is a great, easy, delicious meal for a crowd!

These were very good and a fairly quick and easy midweek meal. I also used cucumber in the wraps (scallions too), and loved the addition. I served with the hot and sour coleslaw recipe on this site, and topped the cabbage with peanuts and sesamae seeds. Went very well together. My 4 yr. old even added the slaw into his wrap. yum!

Made this dish for my entire family and it was a huge hit! Instead of tortillas though, I used iceberg lettuce as wraps to eliminate those carbs. I also added chopped peanuts after the dish was finished. Even the pickiest of eaters loved it.

This was just delicious. I used a grill pan instead of broiling, and didn't even bother wrapping it up--just ate it 'au natural' with some brown rice. Amazing flavors, will definitely try again, next time using wrappers or perhaps lettuce leafs.

I LOVED this-- to speed clean-up, i foiled my broiler rack and sprayed it with pam, so throw-away was all that was required. The scallions are a bit hard to bite through, so i substituted strips of cucumber, which added nice crunch. I also used chicken breasts instead of thighs, which worked beautifully and were cooked through and very juicy after 10 mins under the broiler. I wrapped assembled ones in foil for lunch the next day--great cold too!

i doubled the recipe, found it hard to control cooking, outside was burning while inside was still uncooked. it may just be my oven but i will definatley try this again.

Everyone including the kids loved this recipe. We doubled the chicken and had a nice lunch the next day. We simply mircrowaved the tortillas for 30 seconds each instead of stacking in foil.

Very good! We wraped them in Romaine leaves instead. Also didn't add as much cayenne and added more honey and soy sauce.

Made with precooked shrimp instead of chicken and loved it. Sauce is tangy and just a little spicy. Great, easy dish.

Easy to prepare, a little much with the sodium content of the Hoisin and Soy sauce, but tasty none-the-less!

I made this for dinner last night, and both my husband and son said "It's a keeper!" Next time, I'll use more scallions and maybe add slivered Napa cabbage for more crunch.

Fast, easy and good! Actually tasted like Chinese food as opposed to something out of a can like my homemade Chinese sometimes does. Used low carb whole wheat tortillas, (NOT something I would usually use), but they were thinner so they were more like Peking Pancakes! A definite keeper that even the picky kid liked.
