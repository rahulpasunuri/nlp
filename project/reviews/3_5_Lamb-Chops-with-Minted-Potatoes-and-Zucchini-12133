Simple and to the point. Only change was to put the chops back in with the taters and zucchini just to re-warm. Will keep this one on hand.

Great dish for family or for company (if its a casual dinner--requires last minute cooking). Very fast and easy and the lemon, zucchini and mint really make the dish interesting. We had leftover lamb chops and so I made it again a couple of days later, cutting up the leftover lamb and warming it by adding it to the pan between the potatoes and the zucchini. It worked great that way too.

A little bit of chopped garlic sassed this up nicely. Simple and delicious.

Delicious! Temporariy sated my craving for Lebanese food. The lemon and mint combination is tart and tasty and unique with the zucchini. For a low fat alternative, consider using Pam Olive Oil pan spray. I sprayed the pan lightly, then cheated and used 1/2 tsp of extra virgin olive oil. I suspect I would have been fine without the real olive oil, because the true taste of the dish is the lemon and fresh mint.
