Delicious and healthy! This is a FANTASTIC (and healthy) side dish. To make it a bit more health conscious, the second time I only added 2 tbsp of butter and tossed in a little low fat milk and added a little less maple syrup. It was still delish!

delicious! This is becoming a family staple. Instead of cooking on stove, I placed in the oven.

I used olive oil instead of butter and it still came out pretty good. I would make this again. Simple and healthy.

I gave this 4 stars because it's so easy. Nice change from mashed potatoes. Plus, it's versatile. You can add pretty much anything that might sound good. I added a bit of cinnamon, fresh shaved nutmeg, powdered ginger. Enhanced flavors nicely. served under pork tenderloin with balsamic/cranberry sauce. Flavors were delicious. Nice easy side dish.

Very easy and delicious. A good way to use squash from the garden as a quick addition to dinner. I used chipotle pepper and did the bacon variation. Our dinner guests raved about it.

I LOVE this recipe and make it all the time. Make sure you add the full amount of salt. Combined with the sweetness of the squash and the maple syrup, it elevates the taste to heavenly levels! I've used butternut, kabocha, and acorn squash, and each was delicious.

I made it with the ginger and didn't like that aspect at all. The salt and pepper were too strong as well, so I would cut them by half and then season them to taste at the table.

prepared recipe exactly as written and it was a "smash hit" for Thanksgiving. Several of my relatives cited it as the best dish of all this year. Definitely will be a keeper...and extremely easy to make.

Simple, fast, and delicious. You must try it with the ginger. I finely chopped about 1 tablespoon of ginger and added it while pureeing the squash. I know this will be a big hit this Thanksgiving.
