Hot dog, this is one unique and tasty pie. The gingersnap crust is rich and crunchy, with an awesome unexpected kick. Sweet potato puree is divine - not overly sweet, fantastic fresh flavor - but USE FRESH sweet potatoes, not the canned guys the recipe suggests. Makes all the difference in the world - roast those guys for 45 minutes or so and you have the makings of a marvelous pie! Taste is an A, ease of preperation gets a B+, expensive rating is a solid B+, texture gets an A, and presentation also gets an A. Overall, A-!

This recipe was amazing and easy to make even in a blender. I will be making it again and again due to popularity!

Just made this for a Pre-Thanksgiving get together and it was a huge hit! Like others, I used fresh, baked sweet potatoes rather than the canned, and I also increased the spices a little. Just taste it as you go. I also used a glass pie dish, and the edges of the crust browned a little, but didn't burn. Yummy!

We have made this recipe with "no" crust and used Jack Daniels instead of rum. It was first introduced to us as a vegetable dish, not a desert. It is wonderfull!

I love this pie & make it every Thanksgiving. The crust is tricky because it has burnt a couple of times on me.

I actually thought this was great, but I used fresh roasted sweet potatoes rather than canned. That probably made the pie much fresher-tasting. I thought the crust was great in combination with the sweet potato filling; I also added slightly more rum and more sweet potato and decreased the brown sugar a bit. Served this with whipped cream and we all really enjoyed it!

Yams in the U.S. are actually sweetpotatoes with relatively moist texture and orange flesh. Although the terms are generally used interchangeably, the U.S. Department of Agriculture requires that the label "yam" always be accompanied by "sweetpotato."

I had 8 oz of leftover baked sweet potatoes and pureed them in my food processor. The crust is nice, just bake it ahead of time so it gets crisp. I baked it in a tart pan, and it was very nice. The pie is rich, so cut slices on the slim side.

Jim, canned yams are not yams. They are canned sweet potatoes. They are misnamed because that is what people from Louisiana call them. It might have something to do with the African slaves who were the cooks at plantations calling the sweet potatoes the African name - Yams.

What is wrong with you people? A YAM is not a sweet potato. You're making yam pie, YUCK.

I made this for Christmas last year, substituted regular pie crust and used butter brickle as a garnish. I thought it was just about perfect.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit!!! Everyone was talking about it for weeks!!! My only complaint is that the crust didn't hold its form extremely well . . . but it was so tasty that it really didn't even matter!

The combination of egg and rum with sweet potato reduces the sweetness of the sweet potato. Then you add sugar to increase it (and increase the calories intake). What a waste! Not only so, this dish gives a real funny taste that I sure do not enjoy. I've tried many recipes from this web site and by far this is THE worst. I strongly urge those from attempting to make this pie. I am so glad that I actually took a taste of the sweet potato puree cuz the whole pie ended up in garbage can. I am sure the ravens who constantly watch out our garbage collection would love this.

This pie has become a family favorite at the holiday time! I do use a pottery pie pan or a thick glass pan. The crust gets pretty dark brown...but doesn't burn!! We have eaten this pie since it first appeared in the Bon Appetit!! That is many pies!!

I made this for a work function and got two wedding proposals! I used half-half yams and sweet potatoes freshly steamed and peeled. I also used pecans instead of walnuts.

The taste of the filling was wonderful, but I had a problem with the crust burning before the pie was done and I think it had to do with the metal pie pan. I am going to try again using a glass pan.
