Horrible! Do yourself a favor and skip this recipe! I made it for company, and 100% said "yuck!"

I add 1 tsp each cloves and nutmeg for extra spiciness and love the flavor. For some reason this cake falls upon cooling every time I make it. Suggestions how to prevent this are welcome.

I'd call this Molasses Cake. The ginger is subdued by the blackstrap. Has a great texture and moisture . I sweetened it up with a multi-fruit puree and ice cream.

SO good. I made it last night for friends and everyone loved it. Very moist. I highly recommend serving this warm with the whipped cream. I liked it so much I ate leftovers with applesauce for breakfast. A very nice spiced winter dessert.

I made this cake on a cold, wintery afternoon for my knitting circle. Perfect with tea. When served with whipped cream, the ginger flavour comes out beautifully. Do use the best powdered ginger you can find, or substitute fresh.
