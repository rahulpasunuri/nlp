We made this with broccoli from our garden. We thought it was delicious, and served it with a homemade tomato soup. I agree with the reviewers about a little less salt and greasing the pan. I had the leftovers for lunch today and it held up wonderfully. We will definitely make it again.

Really enjoyed the flavor of this bread pudding, but found 2 tsp salt in the egg mixture made it way too salty for my taste. However I did use prosciutto instead of pancetta so maybe that added to the saltiness. I would definitely make again. I served this as a side dish to the Rosemary Grilled Veal Chops and a Jose Andres' Catalan Spinach recipe.

Just made this today and absolutely loved it! Made two changes based on the personal taste of my family: used spicy sausage instead of pancetta and sautéed spinach instead of broccoli. This was so quick and easy to prepare and has a big taste. I think it will be fantastic as a left over too. I served it with a simple kale salad because it is a pretty hearty and filling dish but would be great with grilled lamb or any meat of your choice. This will definitely be a go to dish in the future.

This was a wonderful side dish with Rosemary Grilled Veal Chops. My guests demanded the recipe. I loved it because it was simple to assemble and put into the oven while we enjoyed antipasto and drinks before dinner.

What a nice change from potatoes! Served this with grilled rack of lamb on Easter and it was a hit! Increased the garlic and added some sautéd some onions.

We made this recipe for Easter brunch. It was outstanding! Used home made wheat bread and have been raving about it since we made it! Try it, you'll like it.

Wow. This may now be our favorite way to eat broccoli rabe. We made some changes, mainly because we were going to make Bon Appetit's broccoli rabe grinders (try them, awesome!) and had the ingredients for that. So we used cut up italian rolls instead of white bread and slightly undercooked bacon instead of pancetta. We also added some provolone and tripled the garlic. Yeah, I usually hate it when people change things and then review, but these were relatively minor changes, so oh well. A couple things I will do in the future - it's a wee bit too eggy so next time I'll cut out one or two eggs and increase the milk by a quarter or half a cup. That seems in line with some other savory bread puddings on epicurious. Also, grease the baking dish because it will stick. And keep an eye on it, because it barely took 45 minutes in the oven. Everything else was really perfect. Yum!
