I thought this was excellent. I used slightly more potatoes than was called for (because I had a bigger crowd coming) and whole milk. I also made it the night before and reheated it in the oven and it turned out just fine. In fact, perhaps it was even better with this second turn in the oven!

This dish was great. I was in a hurry so baked it at 400 for about 50 minutes and then 25 more minutes (uncovered) at 350. I recommend spreading the goat cheese out as much as possible since that is the best part! My husband devoured most of the dish and he is not so much on goat cheese.

I made this for a dinner party many months ago and everyone loved it. In fact, it will be on the table for Christmas dinner!

I followed this recipe to exact specifications and brought it to a pot luck dinner. It was one of the first dishes to go and many were raving. I will indeed make it again. I had never tried to cook with goat cheese before and was a bit skeptical after reading reviews...but thankfully gave it a try anyway.

I love goat cheese and any excuse to eat it. However, this recipe did not turn out for me. It was runny and very average.

I won't rate it since I didn't make as specified, but I substituted plain soy milk (which usually works really well) for the milk. My potatoes came out looking gray. Even so, I didn't care for the taste of the goat cheese baked with the potatoes--even though I normally love goat cheese.
