The only change I made here was the omission of morcilla (for two reasons: 1) you can't find it where I live, and 2) I don't like it, anyway). Aside from that, this was a very filling dish that improved after sitting in the fridge overnight. We didn't throw any away. However, we agreed that we would be happier using our red beans in a Louisiana-style red beans and rice. Although I love Spanish food and was very excited about making this for my Spanish husband, I'm sorry to report that this was not bad, not great.

Oh, that was good. That was very good. It was not a difficult meal to prepare. The hardest thing I imagine would be getting the Alubias de Tolosa (red beans), which were a wonderfull rich dark black colour. This was a particularly heavy meal so I wouldn't recomend preparing much in the way of an entree. As a matter of this is the sort of meal that would punish gluttony quite severly. It tastes so good you want to eat it all, but after half an hour, it will begin to expand in your belly. So, go easy. A fantastic hearty, winter warmer of a meal. Get it into you!!!
