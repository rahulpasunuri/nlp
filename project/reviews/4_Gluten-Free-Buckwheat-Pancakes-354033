Tasted like sweet pancakes and cooked up nicely. I used millet flour rather than the corn flour, almond milk rather than soy, honey rather than maple syrup, and coconut oil rather than canola oil. I also had to thin them with additional almond milk before cooking since they thickened up quite a bit with sitting. I topped them with real maple syrup and they tasted sweet, nutty, and with a touch of coconut flavor. Almost like a dessert. Turned out better than I had hoped since they are gluten-free.

Great! My gluten-full and meat-eating fiance thought these were even better than normal pancakes :) I subbed brown rice flour for the corn flour and added frozen wild blueberries while the pancakes were cooking. They have a nice, hearty, nutty flavor and tender texture. I will absolutely make them again!

Love these! I wish I'd discovered them sooner-I had to give up gluten last summer & I've missed pancakes. I've made these twice, each time subbing coconut flour for quinoa flour, almond milk for soy milk, coconut oil for canola oil & cooking spray, & I've added an egg to 1/2 a recipe to help emulsification, rising, etc. & add some more protein & nutrition :-). It's all worked wonderfully. I really like that I can adjust the flours as needed. My husband's making a batch now-I love that man :-)!, & I'm going to ask him to add some chopped walnuts & a banana. As others here have said, I like not feeling weighted down & sleepy after I eat these.

great recipe! we're new to GF, so we didn't have all the flours at first. Substituted almond flour for the quinoa and corn flour, and it was still excellent in taste and texture. Reliable and flexible - it's our weekend standard.

I've made these several times and really enjoy them! I sometimes premix the dry ingredients and store them in ziplock bags so that I can quickly make a batch whenever I feel like it. This time of year I like to top them with some diced peach or nectarine, blueberries, sliced almonds, and a little drizzle of agave or maple syrup. Yummy! :)

My husband found this recipe and made the pancakes for me this morning. They were the best pancakes I have ever had! I just loved them. He added walnuts, bananas and blueberries. Yum. And I didn't feel like a needed a nap after eating them, like I usually do with regular pancakes.

I liked these more than I thought I would. I used cornmeal and buttermilk, and also added extra water because the batter was very thick.

I agree! These are the best gluten-free and vegan pancakes I have ever tried. I used sorghum flour and millet flour instead of corn flour and quinoa flour. I tripled the recipe so I could freeze them for a quick microwave pancake fix!

These have very good flavor. They do cook differently than regular pancakes and I had to turn the heat down a little so they wouldn't burn. I didn't have flax meal, so just left it out and I used sorghum in place of corn flour. I've been missing pancakes since going gluten free and these will be great.

I was happy they didn't have that off taste that most GF pancakes have due to rice flour? Nonetheless, I had problems with the "light and fluffy" part. I always have problems getting GF pancakes to cook through. The insides are never fluffy - but kind of pasty and thin. Not sure what I did wrong. I followed the recipe exact except for the addition of about 3 Tbsp of water. I'll try it without the water but it looked very thick and stiff before I added the water. Anybody have any ideas?

These are amazing. The best gluten/egg/dairy free pancakes I've made so far! As other reviewers said they are light, fluffy and delicious. Even gluten eating non-allergic family gobbles them up and they are much lighter and taste healthier than traditional pancakes. I use millet flour instead of the corn flour and hemp milk for the "milk". These are delicious with maple syrup or a fresh fruit compote.

An excellent gluten-free, vegan recipe that yields fluffy and delicious buckwheat pancakes. Sorghum flour can be used to substitute for the corn flour- I've made them both ways and I think I slightly prefer the sorghum. I also have made these with hemp milk instead of soy. Delicious! Isa never disappoints and her vegan and gluten-free fans love her for it.

My family loved these. We're not gluten-intolerant so I subbed the quinoa/corn flours for all-purpose (I'll try whole-wheat pastry next time), omitted the tapioca, and kept everything else the same. Added frozen berries at the end and these were some of the fluffiest, most delicious pancakes I've ever made. My toddler gobbled down two whole ones with only a smidgen of syrup.

A great addition to my hyper-allergic son's diet. He loves these and they've got a much better texture than other wheat/dairy/egg free pancakes I've tried. I've already made these several times.

I love these. Instead of leaving that ugghh-I-just-ate-pancakes feeling, you feel simply great. Sometimes I substitute a tablespoon of coconut oil.

Simply delicious. Made a blueberry syrup to top them off. Will make whenever the pancake mood strikes!

These are much lighter and fluffier than other gf pancakes that I have tried. My 2 boys gobbled them up!!
