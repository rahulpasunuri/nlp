I thought this was terrific. I didn't have amaretti or sesame candy either, I just skipped that part and served with thin almond crisp cookies. Initial broil was a little longer than "2-4 minutes" (I used the "starting to brown" metric). Easy! WONDERFUL way to do height-of-the-season peaches that dresses them up just a little. As to the salmonella issue, frankly I would rather die young than not eat meringue. Seriously people, your risk of death is much higher driving to the farmer's market to get the peaches for this recipe.

Easy, yes. Good, yes. Great, no. I didn't have amaretti or sesame candy, so made a sesame brittle with 1/2 cup sugar and 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds. The sesame brittle added crunch which would have been missing otherwise. If I am rushed and have peaches on hand, I may make this again, but whould not have it as a regular item on our menu.

This was fantastic and easy (which is important to me); but then again, I'll eat anything with meringue! I didn't have a chance to get any sesame snaps and missed the crunch as they were a little mushy in texture without.

Despite my reservations about the almost raw egg whites, I made this as per directions. Then I sat the peaches in a pool of homemade blackberry syrup. Now, we have incredibly good peaches in the Mid Atlantic, and although it was good, and impressive to look at. I'd almost rather eat just the peach. Not sure.

So incredibly easy and delicious. I used the sesame candy, which is readily available at my local health food store in the bulk section. Everyone raved about them.

In New England, salmonella in egss is so prevalent, that we stopped making things like meringue. However! Since moving south, salmonella is not a problem and if we're sensible, we are free to use eggs in things like this. I don't know what happened in the northeast corner, but it fortunately doesn't seem to affect most of the country. And apparently not Europe.

Added a few drops of amaretto to the egg white while it was beating up...deelish. Kept it under the broiler til the meringue was nice and brown. Total keeper for a nice ending to a summer meal.

What is the expression..."Nothing stays the same"? I grew up on a home made breakfast drink we called "egg nog" with raw eggs, milk and a bit of orange juice. I survived yrs of them in the morning. Would I eat a raw egg now here in the US..absolutely not! After the problems we have had over the yrs with salmonella I would play it safe and "pass" on raw!

Vancouver - You are right...make your own Amaretti cookies. epicurious/gourmet January 2009 - Chewy Amaretti Sandwich Cookies. I left out the final steam step and didn't make the 'sandwich.' Everyone in my office raved about them!

A very nice simple end to a meal, however,If you are not comfy with the egg white, prepare the peaches just as the recipe calls for and while they are warm just before serving top each with a serving of whipped topping,or Vanilla Ice cream,your choice. It will get raves for you as well.

Perfect for Ripe Summer Peaches!! Made these without the sesame candy, and served whole amaretti cookies on the side. I used a little granulated brown sugar instead of the white sugar and reduced the amount significantly. Easy, delicious, and elegant. I made this for a dinner party. I did slice a very thin slice froom the side of the peach halves so that they would sit straight on the baking sheet and on the serving dish. For added visual appeal and taste, serve the peaches in a SMALL pool of raspberry sauce for a Peach Melba Under Meringue. Be sure to serve the cookies alongside. The crunch adds a lot. Delightful.

I can't believe the American obsession with raw eggs! You must have a big salmonella problem in the US, or half of Europe would have died of salmonella or listeria if you must belief your raw egg scare. Raw eggs in recipes or raw milk cheeses are very common. Even young children get a raw yolk in their mashed potatoes!

Use meringue powder available at cake decorating supply stores to make your meringue - no chance of samonella!

these worked wonderfully. very summer-ey, but is samonella an issue? by the way, ameretti cookies are italian sugar cookies; look in italian food stores or gormet stores. (or make your own)

I did this without sesame candy or crushed amaretti in the meringue. I thought it was a very nice and pleasant summer dessert that took no time at all. I put the meringue on the peach under the broiler for 30 seconds, as the recipe asked, but I would have done it longer. I would make it again just for the looks... If you are looking for a quick and easy summer dessert, this is great! By the way, what is amaretti?

Gave this 4 forks, for ease, presentation and taste. Couldn't get the candy and had to use heath bar, but think I would have like butterfinger instead. Will need to search harder for sesame candy next time...

Healthy, easy, and tasty. What more do you want. Very quick.

I seldom, actually never, make desert for a weeknight family dinner. But this was healthy with limited sugar and really quick. It was quite tasty. I will certainly make it again while the peaches and nectarines are in season.
