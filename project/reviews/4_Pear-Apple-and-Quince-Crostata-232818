It was good with vanilla ice cream, but I have had better fruit filling.

This dessert is a winner! The crust was excellent, the filling was excellent, and the roasting of the fruit made the crostata that much more extraordinary. I substituted currant juice for the apple cider (didn't have any) and added a bit of apple brandy right before baking. I also added some dried cherries that had been soaked in kirsch right before baking. I would not recommend lining the baking pan with foil for the roasting. What a mess! Everything stuck to the foil and had to be peeled away. Also, I had a hard time finding the cloves after roasting - they were easily hidden among the fruit and dark sugar. I'll add a pinch of ground cloves to the mixture next time. I will also increase the amount of fruit ( 1/2 again as much) - it started out as a lot, but the roasting process substantially reduces the volume of the fruit. I'll definitely be making this dessert again!

First time I made this I couldn't get quince so I got some quince paste instead and mixed that in with the roasted fruit, and it was great. We just picked up some fresh quince, and I'm really excited to try it as intended!

It's been said many times before, but this recipe is really a winner. It's shown up on my Thanksgiving table for the past four years. The pastry crust is my go-to recipe for any pie. I like to increase the proportion of filling by about 50%.

OMG...this was amazing! I made it for Thanksgiving in addition to my exceptionally good pumpkin pie and there was hardly anything left of this crostata! I used orange juice instead of the lemon juice & apple cider and it was excellent. I also used Pillsbury's refrigerated crust which I rolled out to fit into my tart pan, and this was fine. I found that I needed to beat the brown sugar filling longer in my mixer for it to become smooth and spreadable. I made this a couple of days in advance & refrigerated it. When it was time to serve it I just put it in a warm oven and it was perfect. I will make this again because it was crazy good! Jonathan Waxman, you rock!

The drying of the fruits is labor intensive but the result is extraordinary. This is one of the finest crusts I have come across. I substituted rhubarb for quince (could not find) and it was excellent. I recently found quince and am looking forward to trying this following the recipe precisely. This is going to be one I save for very special occasions.

Terrific tasting and the least fuss of any tart I have ever made. My gang ate it all on our post thanksgiving (re)feast topped with some ice cream and leftover caramel sauce from the thanksgiving tart tatin. I liked the reduced fruit filling but am anxious to try it again with less fully cooked fruit to preserve the individual punch of each element.

This tart is genius. I had quince from the farmers' market and was looking for a way to use it; I wasn't expecting this rustic yet elegant and insanely delicious result. I made it as written and it completely blew us all away.

Excellent.. and malleable. Granted, some consideration should be given to water and sugar content when choosing fruits for the filling but the pastry is solid and this can be considered an excellent vehicle for many things. I made a rendition that used apple, pineapple, raisin and a little vidalia onion that got raves...oh, also swapped out the cloves (hate em) for a bit of cardamom and baked it in a 9.5" round springform pan. I left out a little crust and filling as I saw fit, but still it was perfect after 43min at 375F. So yeah, malleable.. my kind of pastry.

Exactly as written this has become a family favorite even with one member who doesn't usually like cooked fruit. I've made it several times, sometimes with other pastry. It will serve at least 10. With ice cream probably 16.

This recipe is a masterpiece. I used granny smith apples instead of fuji, and a bit of apple juice instead of cider, but otherwise followed the recipe excatly. It's the best looking and tasting dessert I've ever made, maybe ever had.

This is a fabulous dessert - very unique in flavor. Could easily alter the fruits in the filling.

The quince is absolutely necessary, in my opinion. It adds both a firmer texture to the fruit mix, and a fragrant tartness that balances the sugar. Without it, its apple pie. When the recipe is followed exactly -- its a masterpiece!

Good. Agree with previous reviewer that it was a little too sweet. Will definitely cut back on the sugar next time. Also agree that quince was not necessary.

I served this warm at a dinner party with lite dulce de leche ice cream and everyone loved it. Next time I will use a more tart apple like granny smith, and reduce the sugar a bit. The accompanying story said this was "not too sweet" but I thought it was just a bit. The quince is not necessary if you can't find it, I used a little quince preserves, and that was fine. I used more apples and pears. I made a 1 1/2 recipe and baked it on a pizza pan to serve 12. Definitely serving this at Thanksgiving.
