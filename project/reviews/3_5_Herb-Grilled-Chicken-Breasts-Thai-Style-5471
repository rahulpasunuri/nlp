I followed the ingredient list exactly as written. I did however, chop the chicken into kebab pieces before adding the marinade. I marinaded it for 2 hours before firing up the grill. Overall, this recipe was very fresh tasting and good. The flavors just did not wow me. Sadly, I am not that excited to eat the leftovers. There are so many stellar chicken marinade recipes that I will not make this again.

Followed the recipe verbatim, except the brown sugar (realized that I was out, and subbed a mixture of molasses and white sugar). I let it marinate for 24 hours. Be very gentle with the time on the grill, folks. Super high heat on the grill is fabulous for caramelization, but white meat dries pretty quickly at high temps. So get the color you want with 2 minutes (max) per side, then turn down the flame. Served with Hugh Acheson's watermelon, feta and serrano salad. Perfect.

I omitted the fish sauce, doubled the soy sauce and didn't use the chili I bought. I did marinate it over night. And the result had enough punch and flavor for me to love it. Fresh mint and basil from my garden really gave the chicken sparkle.

wow, this is really good! Even better next day cold! Since I don't have a grill, I cooked in the oven @400 for about 20-25 mins. Used bonelees, skinless thighs.

Two Words.. love it! I'm doing weight wathcers and have been converting my favorites and trying to find new recipes to point out. This was fabulous and healthy. I subbed sesame chili oil for canola oil. I cubed the chicken and served as lettuce wraps. My husband really liked it and there are many ways to use this basic recipe. I could see using this on pork or beef - think flank steak!

I made this recipe for family this summer. I substituted Italian flat-leaf parsley for the cilantro (husband doesn't like) and a jalapeno pepper for the serrano. I did not put the marinade ingredients in a processor, just finely chopped, and then removed most of it from the chicken before grilling. So moist and tender even our "picky" eater thought it was a keeper. I made the coconut basmati rice from this site to accompany it. Mmmm!

This is awesome! We usually double it (To use up the mint- -this is the only recipe I buy it for and I hate wasting fresh herbs from the market). Sometimes I add a few dashes of chili oil to give it a kick, but not necessary. Great with stir-fried Asian vegetables and jasmine rice. Leftovers are delicious tossed into salads

I don't have a food processor, so I just minced all the ingredients by hand and made the marinade that way. It came out well; very tasty. I'll make this one again.

Very nice summer marinade. I used dried Cilantro from penzey's, as I had forgotten to buy fresh. It was still very good and my husband even remarked that perhaps that helped keep the cilantro taste from overwhelming the marinade. Also, sis not bother with all the dicing and mincing- just threw all the ingredients into my mini cuisinart. The fish sauce is a very strong component to the marinade- so beware if you are hesitant about that flavor to begin with.

Found this recipe when I was searching for something that wouldn't irritate my girlfriend's sensitive stomach.

I got nervous while this was marinating, and had to read these reviews to reassure myself. I was afraid that the flavors of the marinade would not really penetrate the chicken. Well,just about everything went wrong last night, including my grill malfunctioning,but the chicken was delicious. I made the recipe as written,which I usually do the first time around.The family loved it. I served it with coconut rice and salad. I'm going to have to plant more basil!

This is easy, tasty and versatile. They're great as part of a casual meal, or something fancier depending on your sides. Leftovers are good sliced into a noodle salad, or stuffed in rice wrappers as spring roll filling. I've also cut the chicken in pieces and grilled on skewers as a cocktail hors d'oeuvre.

Yum! I didn't have any mint and this still tasted great. It's just enough marinade for 2 large chicken breasts. I ended up baking the chicken breasts in aluminum foil pockets with some sauce and the herbs covering the top of the breasts. It was delicious. I think it would taste good with fish also.

Love this recipe. It is one of the few I don't modify. It freezes well, and we have used it as seasoning in other dishes - mixed with hoisin and soy sauces for stir fry, in place of green curry in green curry-coconut chicken, and stirred into soups for extra flavor.

This chicken was excellent. The only change I made was adding 1/2 t or so of sesame oil. I marinated for 24 hrs. The chicken was amazingly moist, tender, and full of flavor. The woman who said her chicken was bland and a strange green color MUST have made a mistake. My husband ate his as is, and I made mine into a salad with a light Asian vinaigrette. This is a keeper!

This marinade is awesome! I made this for a group of non-meat eaters using tofu instead of chicken, and rolled it up in Thai green onion pancakes with some romaine, red peppers and shredded carrots. We stir-fried the tofu in a wok. Completley amazing.

I think it's fabulous! I made it for dinner plans that we had with some friends. We did a Thai theme so we were all supposed to bring a Thai dish so I brought the chicken. I also made some stir fried rice noodles w/ a bunch of fresh basil, cilantro, and green onions. Everyone loved it. The chicken was extremely tender and very flavorful. The only thing that I did different was use Braag Sauce ( a soy sauce substitute- tastes just like soy sauce but a little healthier. You can find it in any health food store.) Our friends loved it so much that they wanted to eat only what we brought and nothing that they made! Definitely a keeper!

Rating: 4
I've been making this regularly ever since I found the recipe and it's one of my favorite dishes ever. I make the marinade in the summer when the herbs are fresh and freeze it like pesto. I just made it the other night with thawed frozen marinade from last summer, grilled it on my indoor grill pan, and it was still great. As some others have noted, you have to marinate it long enough so the flavors can blend and it's also better the next day.

Rating: 3
Simple to make and wonderful flavours! You must however at least double the amounts for the liquid to have enough marinade (I may have read this in one of the reviews - it's true). Tried it with pork tenderloin and liked it even more! Goes really well with a reisling-gewurtz from Strewn called Two Vines.

After reading the rave reviews on this recipe, I decided I had to make it. Let me tell you, I was NOT impressed at all. I actually made it for some friends, and they too did not like the recipe. Not only was the chicken unappealing (green colored), it also did not taste very good. It was just so so...nothing like the reviews described. And I actually made this twice to see if the first time I did something wrong- --sorry to break the trend of rave reviews! But I'm being honest!

Extremely moist and very flavourful. I have to admit like others I was a bit sceptical, but this dish was easy and very very tasty. I made as written, but for the substitution if chili oil for the serrano chili, and peanut oil for canola. I halved the recipe for two large chicken breasts. Chicken was marinated for a day and a half and grilled on the BBQ. A definite keeper!

We absolutley loved this chicken. I substituted chili paste for the serano, forgot to add the sugar and marinated for 1 1/2 hours. I'm surprised at the comments regarding the prep being time consuming. The prep was amazingly easy. Using my mini-chopper, it took me all of three minutes to prepare the pesto. We paired the chicken with roasted vegetables. It was a wonderful meal that will become one of our summer favorites. It will be a great way to use all the herbs that I planted this week. Next time I will try to remember the sugar ;)

I subbed peanut oil for canola and 1/4 tsp red curry sauce for serrano chili. It was raining so I baked my chicken. It was pretty darned good! I'm looking forward to grilling it outside. This recipe is a keeper. I listened to others comments that this didn't make enough for 6 breasts and would agree. Seems perfect for 4.

Rating: 4
This has become my standard for large gatherings for dinner. I cut back a bit on the fish sauce and you can substitute thai chili paste for the serrano chili. It freezes well so when herbs are in abundance I tend to make several batches and freeze them so it is available quickly. Works well with pork tenderloin but do prefer the chicken. Tastes great even when done in the broiler. This really is a great recipe!

This chicken was delish! I marinated it for 24 hours in a zipper bag in the refrigerator, then seared it for 3 minutes per side in a nonstick skillet sprayed with vegetable oil spray. Then I sprinkled sesame seeds on top and broiled it for another 10 minutes. It was a hit!

Contrary to a prior post, I found this an extremely easy dish to prepare. As with any marinade, you must plan ahead. But, this one is packed with flavor. It was a rainy Cape Cod night, so I baked the chicken instead. We just finished the leftovers by reheating them on the grill. Crispy and delicious! I used the two Thai dipping sauces from the recipe for Grilled Chicken Wings With Two Thai Sauces.

8 people coming for dinner and my husband came home with ahi because there was no chicken at the store. No problem. Mixed this sauce which I had already prepared with some plain yogurt, a little mayo, a touch of wasabi, lime juice and ginger juice and told my guests it was the sauce for the fish. Everybody loved it.

This is the most delicious marinade I've ever used on chicken - it is SO GOOD. It is the only chicken marinade I use now - tried it early in the summer and have made it at least 10 times since, and people always ask for the recipe. Really delicious and intense flavor. I find it works best on thighs (boneless skinless are fine, or bone in is fine too) because then you don't even have to stress about it drying out. I did try broiling them in the oven and the results were not as good though. I have also tried it when I had no cilantro and it was still tremendous. I substitute a little hot sauce for the the hot pepper.

Wonderful. Couldn't find the fish sauce so omitted it (saved on sodium) and since I'm not a big fan of mint I omitted it and doubled up on the cilantro.

Excellent and low-fat/low-calorie! Since the weather was threatening, I cooked the chicken in the broiler, rather tha the outdoor grill, but it was still delicious. I suspect that charcoal grilling will be even better. I added four serrano peppers (seeded) instead of just one, and it wasn't too spicy at all. But...we tend to have cast iron tongues, so adjust accordingly if you're sensitive to a little chile pepper heat.

These were very yummy, flavorful and moist. I didn't barbeque but used a cast iron grill pan that worked great. I think I'll try pounding them out a little next time. I put my chicken and marinade in a ziploc bag and put it in the freezer and took them out a week later, thawed it and there was no problem. Great easy recipe!

Rating: 3
I've made these a few times, both on outdoor and indoor grills, and find that a bit of lime juice and minced lemongrass in the marinade enhance the flavor nicely. Also, pounding the breasts before marinating is important for cooking uniformly. After grilling, I cover with foil in a dish for about three minutes - they're juicier this way. If you're not overly concerned about calories, this is also lovely on boneless thighs - much more flavorful than the breasts.

Rating: 3
Very flavorful and moist. I had to make do with broiling it and then finishing it off in the oven, since I don't (yet) own any sort of grill. With that preparation, I wished I'd saved some of the marinade (I made a double batch and therefore could have spared some) to use as a basting sauce, since the top got a little dry. I also think that next time I'd like to save time on the cilantro and just use the entire plant instead of painstakingly picking off the leaves; I doubt it'll make much difference in the food processor anyway. Surprisingly, marinating the chicken a second day decreased its appeal tremendously. I found myself scraping off the marinade, which seemed to have acquired an off flavor after the extra day.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious! I prepared it a day ahead and let all those flavors sink in. Everyone I've made it for has asked for the recipe. I tried making it this winter and since it was too cold out to grill, I cooked it in the oven - NOT GOOD! It must be cooked on the grill to make it work!

made it for a BBQ and it was a BIG hit. I butterflied and scored the chix breasts, and the marinade got in there with only about two hours marinating time, plus cooked up quick and MOIST.

very good and easy to make. i would use a hotter pepper but that is a personal choice. the fresh mint really gives it a wonderful taste.

I love this recipe! I quadrupled the recipe and included it as part of a buffet for a party of 50+. That was 2 weeks ago and I'm still getting phone calls raving about the food. The chicken turns out so moist and flavorful. This is now definately part of my repertoire.

This was great! I did not have a pepper on hand so I used Chinese Chili Oil instead of the Canola Oil. Also, my husband does not particularly care for Thai food, and he LOVED it!

Made this for dinner last night and it was a BIG hit. We used shrimp instead and it worked very well. Very easy, but lots of flavour. Making it with chicken next weekend.

This was easy and delicious. Great way to use fresh herbs from the garden. Next time I would use two chilis for alittle more spice.

The chicken was delicious and so easy to make. I wasn't able to locate fish sauce the day I made it so I substituted Oyster Sauce. I had unexpected company show up for dinner and they loved it as well. I definitely plan on making this again.

Delicious. My husband suggests a little more of the chili would add the zip he associates with Thai food and likes.

I wanted to try this out since I was planning to use it for Father's Day--it was great! I had to substitute dried mint and ground chili paste (for the serrano pepper)and it was delicious. I will definitely use this again.

Everyone loves this chicken. I have used whole chicken pieces also and it always turns out great. I cook it indirect on my gas grill for about 45 minutes depending on what pieces of chicken I am using.

I made this recipe for a dinner party - everyone LOVED it and my husband and I loved it! I also marinated a pork tenderloin in the same marinade with delicious results. I've made it several times since my original serving of it and it always tastes just as good. The soup that was with the original menu is also delicious as well as the pasta salad.

Everyone loves this. It is also superb on a salad with a Thai style dressing.

A fantastic and easy dish. Include some coriander/cilantro roots if possible for even better flavour. Dinner guests have raved over this dish. If they like thai-inspired cuisine you can't go wrong.

This is a wonderful, easy recipe. I used basil from a jar since I could not find any fresh the day I prepared it, and then let it marinate for 2 days as opposed to just over night. I then barbecued it over a low flame until it was pretty much done, then raised the flames to high for a few minutes to crisp it. Tasted quite similar to a Larb Gai(sp?) salad. Markus
