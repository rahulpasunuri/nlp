Just so you're aware, Morning glory is both a hallucinogen and toxic.

Every recipe that I have made from Samuelsson's cookbooks have been amazing. This was another winner. The combination of flavors worked so well and created a profile that was very unique. There is a lot of prep involved, so this is more of a weekend recipe but I will be making it again very soon.

Dear Iowa - thank you so much for sharing your story! I really needed a good laugh. I hope you guys recovered! It reminds me of going to a seed store in New Orleans, and being advised by the check-out girl that I'd better not eat the morning glory seeds. "Why would I want to eat them" I asked. "Because they make you high". She then added the fact that the seeds I was purchasing had a preservative on them, and THAT was why I shouldn't eat them. My best friend was quite intrigued and ate them that night. I never did, and had forgotten the whole episode. I very much hope the rest of your friends weren't freaked out by the episode. BTW, morning glory is also the name of a green - though not in America. Read the recipe notes.

Well, despite an amusing misunderstanding I enjoyed this soup very much. I used morning glory seeds rather than whatever the heck "morning glory" (I assume the leaves and flowers?) refers to and only used 4 TB, thinking 4 cups was a typo (my b/f copied the recipe down onto paper for me. Fortunately I made it for friends because those seeds are apparently hallucinogenic! We spent the remainder of the evening tripping.
