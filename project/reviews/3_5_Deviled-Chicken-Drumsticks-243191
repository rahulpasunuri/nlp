Totally edible, but not that tasty. Just tasted like any other drumstick rolled in breadcrumbs. Maybe I didn't use enough mustard?

Nothing special at all. Mixed the dijon with honey. Not worth a recipe or making again....too basic.

I used spicy chile oil instead of butter. Even more heavenly!

I really enjoyed these. I marinated them overnight and then grilled them for lunch. I had to cook them for almost an hour - but that may be because I was using my little portable grill. Nice flavor and even my grandson who said that he wouldn't try Indian food ate 2 of the.

Simple enough for the middle of the week. Have changed a few things bepending on the mood and whats in the pantry. I have used honey mustard, taken out the spice on occation and I have used turkey and chicken breast cut into smallish pieces. I also use a rack while cooking so there is no need to turn(though I do)and I also use the convection feature. YUMMY

This is really delicious as is. Even if I make the recipe exactly as is in all other respects, I do consistently make one small change. I bake it on a wire wrack in a half sheet for all around crisp without turning. And, there is plenty of room to toss oiled vegetables on the rack to roast right along side the chicken. For even better panko texture and flavor, I lightly brown it in the butter in a skillet before breading the chicken.

Outstandingly crunchy, and easily adaptable to SCDI just swapped out panko for almond toast crumbs. (But watch the temperaturealmond bread burns more quickly than starch.)

Added honey to mustard, and decreased the cayenne ( kids......) Also skinned the chicken.....still very juicy! The family says.....a definite!

Yum yum yum! Used Penzeys Red & Black instead of straight cayenne and a mix of mayo and whole grain country dijon mustard, and got a really nice balance - lots of flavor with a nice amount of heat. Will definitely make this again.

Flavor was just ok to us...not very complex and mostly mustard flavored. Panko was crunchy straight out of oven, but leftovers were soggy because the panko absorbed any mustard left underneath so definitely eat immediately...

Soo tasty!! I've had these made as written by my sister, and have made them for my family switching it up a bit, (using equal parts dijon and honey to dip the chicken in and reducing the amount of the cayenne). Both versions were immensely delicious.

Fantastic. It's become a real staple in my entertaining recipes. It is a bit spicy for a couple of more squeamish eaters.

Very, very good. I pulled off the skin before making it, but otherwise followed the recipe pretty closely. Made a batch for the little one without the spice, and it was still very good that way. Family has asked me to make it again.

Made as directed, using bone -in and skin on thighs, reducing cayenne to 1/2 tsp and for cheese used about half powdered parmesan and the other half coarsly shredded asiago. I skinned half of the thighs and left skin on for the balance. Placed on buttered foil lined cookie sheet, 400 degrees convection to start, then once browned took off convect and left 400 degrees. Total time about 40 min. Flavour was great, chicken juicy though a bit too spicy for my son. Both skinned and unskinned were delicious - tasted like chicken fingers as per my son. Next time all the same except reduce cayenne to 1/4 tsp.

I made this recipe for a casual dinner party where I wanted a couple of meat options and used skinless, boneless chicken thighs so it would be less messy than drumbsticks. My guests RAVED about it! The cayenne gives it just the right kick without being too spicy. It's a keeper in my recipe box.

I made these as a part of a buffet for 15 guests. They were just outstanding. I used drumsticks but pulled the skin off, using paper towels - really easy.I didn't roll them in the panko but simply brushed the chicken with the mustard and spread the panko mixture on top. I also cooked them 10 minutes longer as they were larger. BTW the other two main courses were beef tenderloin stuffed with mushrooms from Fine Cooking and Ina Garten's seafood gratin. The whole meal was a success and all the recipes worked well together. I liked the chicken so much I made it again last night. This recipe is really worth trying.

This was fabulous, the acid of the mustard really complimented the salty crunch of the panko crust. Used boneless skinless thighs, other than that, followed recipe as written. Time estimate was about right for a first pass, I think it'll be much quicker and a great worknight dinner the next time we make it (which will be soon!)

The bottom of the chicken turned out to be soggy and oily for my family's liking. Also I suggest to use 1/4 creme fraiche and 1/4 Dijon mustard which makes the whole taste milder. I also added some dry herb (thyme) to this recipe.

This has become an absolute staple. I always remove the chicken skin, and have forgotten to add the butter a time or two, but never missed either. For a fast weeknight meal, this can't be beat. Even better - the mister loves them best after they've cooled off for a while, so I finish the dishes before I even put dinner on the table!

To quote my bacon-loving, fast food sneaking husband, "If baked chicken can be this good, why would anyone bother with fried chicken???" I rest my case.

Yum! I used 8 big thighs as that was what I had on hand (baking time went up 20min). Had to use 1/2 dijon and 1/2 spicy stoneground as I ran out...but things turned out great! Loved the cayenne kick & panko crunch. Leftovers warmed up nicely. Perfect picnic or for a comfort "fried chicken" meal.

These are delicious. They make wonderful picnic fare.

Yuck! Followed directions completely and chicken started to burn and smoke when baked at the recommended temp. So I turned it down by fifty degrees and added ten minutes to baking time. I pulled it from oven and it didn't look very palletable. I stuck the meat thermometer it in one drumstick and blood shot up at me! That's when I realized I had tried this same recipe months ago with the same results. Never again!

This recipe worked well, a bit too much kick of cayenne. The coating is very nice with the panko, although I did add a small amount of regular bread crumbs too. I did some wings and thighs along with the drumsticks.

These are excellent!

Wow! My family and friends love this recipe. It is so tasty. The description provided is right on the money: these are great right out of the oven or as left-overs. We make this all the time. Sometimes Panko is hard to find so I substitute with Corn Flakes brand 'bread' crumbs and I think it's just as delicious. Sooo easy, too.

I loved this. Came out perfect! I had to substitute regular Italian seasoned bread crumbs and I used a beer Dijon mustard and yet it came out great. It really only took 30 minutes and was indeed great leftover.

I followed this recipe completely and it was beyond exceptional. The chicken was so tender it fell off the bone and the flavor had a gentle kick. I love fried chicken but really want to avoid the fat but now I've found a really good replacement. I'll make this again and again.

My husband looked at me askance when he saw that I was planning to make "just drumsticks" for dinner last night. I told him to trust me. I don't usually follow any recipe to a T, but the flavors and proportions of ingredients in this one struck me as being spot-on. I used a blend of Romano and Asiago with the Panko crumbs, just becaause it's what I had available. These crisped up beautifully, with a nice but not-overpowering kick. A perfect Sunday night supper with sides of an endive, tomato & prosciutto salad (from Sunday's Boston Globe ) salad and warm potato salad.

Now that I've tasted the cold leftovers, I change my opinion. Cold from the 'fridge, the panko breading is still nicely crisp, and the flavor is better. Tho' fried chicken is still better when served hot, served cold I'd say this is better, and certainly more healthful. Will be great chopped up in salads with tomatoes and basil.

Rating: 2
I wonder if I did something wrong. This recipe just did not do it for me or the husband, who requested an alternative to fried. It wasn't that it was bad; it was just blah. I suspect it may taste better cold, as picnic food. And maybe breadcrumbs would be better than panko.

Rating: 3
I really like fried chicken legs. I especially like them with the skin crisp and well cooked. I could eat these greasy things all night long.....and that is the problem. I made this recipe a few weeks ago and I am making it again tonight. This is not the greasy crisp drumsticks that I have learned to love and savor, but these are the drumsticks that I will eat going forward so I don't become a stroke patient of my wife's who is an occupational therapist.

I made this for a Super Bowl party exactly as the recipe was written. It was a huge hit - everybody raved about it. I left the skin on because I didn't want the chicken to dry out. However, I think next time I will try it without skin. Also, to make it spicier I will try mixing some Siracha with the mustard. Definitely a recipe worth keeping.

Loved this recipe! Made it for my family and a picky 6 year old had two pieces all by himself. replaced the parmigiano-reggiano with finely grated new zealand cheddar and it was still delicious!

I used a 2:1 ratio of mayo and mustard (which I had seen in other similar recipes). Since my husband doesn't like mustard, it worked out really well with the ratio. I also used chicken breasts cut into strips, since we always have those in the freezer. It was really tasty and we will be making it again soon!

While I thought this recipe had great flavor, I didn't like that the bottom of the chicken pieces didn't get crispy. Perhaps this happened because I removed the chicken skin before coating with mustard?

Was sceptical but tried it anyway as I was looking for a quick weeknight dish. I'm glad I did. Loved them. In my haste, I totally forgot the butter on the breadcrumbs. I didn't miss it. Lined the baking sheet with foil and then sprayed with a little fat-free cooking spray. The chicken didn't stick and the clean- up was easy.

Very good--permanent place in the repertoire. If you mix the mustard with a lightly beaten egg, the coating adheres better and really crisps up. Wings work just as well as legs.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious! Regular breadcrumbs also work in lieu of the panko. I find the drumsticks need to be baked a little longer and turned over halfway through in order to cook the meat all the way to the bone.

Made these a day ahead for a picnic party where they were a hit at room temperature. I used thighs and drumsticks and personally prefer the thighs. Lined a jelly roll pan with alum. foil for easier clean-up and glad I did!

I was somewhat disappointed with this one even though my husband and kids enjoyed it. The Dijon mustard was overpowering and if I made it again I would definitely take off the skin first. I felt my arteries clogging up with each bite of the crispy part.

These were absolutely delicious. I made them the other night for a BBQ and made slight modifications - only had 5 drumsticks but left the rest of the quantities the same. I also used sweet and hot mustard instead of dijon and paprika instead of cayenne because that's all I had but it still came out very tasty and my guests couldn't stop raving about them! Definitely will make them again.

Yum! Crispy and delicious right out of the oven, and not at all greasy. The flavors in the coating combine beautifully. My husband and very picky son loved them.

This is a great alternative to fried chicken. It's not as greasy and I'm sure its caloric impact is significantly less than buttermilk fried chicken. The texture and flavor of the cheese-mustard-cayenne-panko coating is wonderful. I will definitely be making it again.
