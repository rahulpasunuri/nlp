Impressive, delicious holiday side!

Love this! Seems so simple, but the shallots and fennel add a lot of deep richness to fresh green beans. I made it for Thanksgiving for a gourmet version on a tradition (there is NO way a can of mushroom soup finds its way into my kitchen). I added slivered almonds, otherwise followed exactly.

This is a wonderful recipe. We serve it every Thanksgiving and have for many years. We use regular green beans, but otherwise make it as per the recipe with great results. Fennel bulbs can very greatly in size. Thus we aim for more-or-less equal portions of green beans, shallots, and fennel. If we have a big fennel bulb, we won't use all of it. The beans are the star.Be sure to slice the fennel small enough to roughly match the size of the beans and shallots. Select the shallots carefully for this recipe. The oddly shaped ones tend to fall apart after peeling and slicing in half. If we have a really big turkey that is stuffed (long roasting time) we put the fennel and shallots in the oven on the top shelf. At 325F it takes about 80 minutes to roast them, stirring every 15 minutes or so. At this lower temp they do not roast as well, but not badly either, and it is very convenient. With a smaller turkey we roast them first.The par-boiling of the green beans (we go 4 minutes) followed by the ice bath is critical. The magic is in the contrast between the fresh crispy beans, and the sweet roasted fennel and onions. Garlic would be a good addition.

My entire family really enjoyed this. I made it as a side dish for Thanksgiving (late giving my review) and will definitely make again.

I have ben using this recipe for the past 4 years at Thanksgiving. My family loves it so much, I make it a few times per year additionally. A few tips- salt the water heavily when boiling the haricots verts, also i line the roasting pan with olive oil as well as coating the veggies prior to roasting. We find this recipe can be done the day before and taste wonderful as all the flavors marinate well over night. It is easily reheated in the oven with no loss of flavor but an enhanced one....enjoy!

I made this to accompany my usual Thanksgiving menu and I must say that this dish was outstanding. I followed the recipe to the letter, except I microwaved the rinsed beans for 3 minutes and used only 3 T. oil, which was plenty. This is now my favorite way to make fresh green beans.

Very easy way to dress up green beans/haricots verts. Simple and delicious.

Made as a side for Thanksgiving--delicious! To save time/bowl, tossed sliced shallots & fennel with only 2 T olive oil, salt, pepper on a large baking sheet. Used Trader Joe's Frozen Haricots Verts as per bag instructions, drained well. used only 1 T olive oil in large skillet, add haricots verts & roasted vegetables. Seasoned to taste with salt & peeper.

Good not great.

I thought this was yummy, the roasted veggies added so much to the dish. Next time I'd core the fennel and either cut the pieces closer in size to the shallots, or start them roasting earlier and add the shallots later so they don't get too done. The crispy shallots were so good that I was picking them out of the pan to eat before tossing everything together.

Good recipe although I like it better without the fennel.

Fantastic addition to easy, reliable repertoire of regular dishes. Variations that work for us too: finishing with a peppery/fresh e.v. olive oil (arbequina or similar), or garnishing with a squeeze and zest of meyer lemon and fresh ground pepper.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving, and it was terrible! Don't waste your time

Rating: 3
Delicious...not quite exceptional. I've made this side dish 3 times now and would emphasize to cut the fennel in uniform pieces otherwise some pieces end up too hard. Furthermore, a seasoned olive oil (w/ italian spices) added more flavour as well right before serving.

Rating: 4
The recipe calls for too much oil. Use only enough to coat the vegies, and you'll love this. My goal is to make much more than I need for one dinner so I'll have some for another time, but we always seem to eat everything. ;-) It does keep in the frige quite well.

I did not have green beans, so I used frozen peas instead. I thought their sweetness would balance out the fennel nicely and I was right. I will make this again for sure and use the peas again. Easy and delicious. By the way, I cooked this to go with the chipotle stuffed pork tenderloin recipe, also from this side and it was a nice pairing.

I made this as a side dish on thanksgiving dinner for 8, it was a hit and I am making again for Christmas dinner-- I roasted the fennel and shallots the day before and brought them to room temp before tossing with the beans. Weren't any left overs on Thanksgiving.

I also made this for Thanksgiving. Great flavor and so easy. Perfect side dish for when you've run out of ideas. Roasted the vegetable the day before worked great!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone raved about it. I roasted the fennel and shallots the day before (just pick out the really burnt pieces), blanched the beans earlier Thanksgiving day and sauteed everything together in some butter. Delicious!

It was OK. I prepared this for Thanksgiving for a few people and got mixed reviews. Personally I thought it had too much oil that overpowered the natural flavor of the beans. The roasted fennel and shallots, while greasy, had alot of potential. Think I'll try to rework them into a different recipe and use less oil.

Rating: 4
Great recipe. I am not a green bean lover but with the fennel and shallots, it made a nice combination. The only thing I would do different is cut the fennel and shallots a little smaller. I think I cut the wedges a little too big for the delicate beans.

I served this elegant dish for the first time at Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews from everyone. It was easy to roast the fennel and shallots ahead of time as well as blanch the haricot vert. Just before serving I heated everything in the olive oil in a large skillet.

Rating: 3
This is a tasty dish. I would use the 3 tablespoons of olive oil to coat the vegetables to be roasted. Maybe 1 T. for the skillet if that. I do like the idea of adding the green beans to the roasted veggies in the oven the last 5 mins before serving. Will try that next time.

Rating: 4
Fantastic combination -- a hit even with my husband, who normally dislikes fennel. I do think the dish would have been too oily if I'd used the full 5 tablespoons, however. As instructed, I used 3 tablespoons to coat the fennel and shallots, but I only added enough oil to coat the pan (which I then blotted with a paper towel to absorb the excess) when heating the blanched green beans and roasted vegetables. An olive oil mister also might work.

This recipe is good in theory but has some major problems. Our veggies were charred within 25 minutes at 450, so make sure you check on them. Plus the number of pans is annoying for a simple side dish. If I were going to do this again, I'd probably roast everything in a pyrex dish and throw the beans in to roast 5 mins before the end. Also, almonds are a nice addition.

Rating: 0
Mushy and greasy, as one of the previous reviewers observed. There's something missing from the recipe, or I'm not understanding it. Two fennel bulbs is one heck of a lot of fennel--so much that there's no way it could fit on a pan even without the shallots. 450 degrees is one very hot oven, so the outermost layer of a shallot burns and falls off when stirring, allowing the next layer to burn, etc. so there's not much shallot left. I never bothered with the beans, simply throughing the whole greasy mess away.

I've made this twice now. Once with shallots and then with onions. It is so good either way and a great make ahead side dish. I used the leftovers in a beef stew. Yum!

I made this for the first time tonight and it instantly became my "go to" fennel recipe. The carmelized fennel and shallots worked really well with the crunchy beans. I used those frozen Trader Joes Haricot Verts. I thawed them in the microwave and just added to the pan in the oven for the last 5 minutes, which saved me the hassle of washing an additional pot. After plating I drizzled a little extra virgin olive oil and sea salt on the veggies. It was so good that I could eat a plate of this for dinner.

Rating: 3
Wonderful flavor combination. My shallots and fennel were not as browned and caramlized as I would have liked (rather mushy) but I believe this is because in trying to make a large batch I over crowded the roasting pan. I will try again and pay particular attention to this.

Great recipe. Fennel provided a nice flavor to the dish. 4 forks as it was not very hard to make and everyone loved it.

This is my very favorite for roasted vegetables ... people cannot believe there are no added herbs or spices since the roasted shallot and fennel are so aromatic. I've made this many times now - so simple and impressive.

I made this dish as one of many sides for Thanksgiving. I thought it was good but it got lost with the over abundance of food we had on the table. I would like to make it again and have it stand out a bit more. I didn't think it was as delicious as some of the other reviewers had mentioned but it was tasty.

An unusual dish and highly recommended. The haricots verts pick up the fennel and shallot mixture well, and the beans stayed crisp. When I asked my husband what rating he would give it, he said 10 forks!

There's never any leftovers of this dish... It tastes great, smells great, and looks great. To the reviewer from Mountain View, do you drain the roasted veggies first? I've found that if you don't, you don't need the extra oil for the beans. Also, I've made the roasted veggies the night before, drained them, and chilled them. The next day, I reheat them in a little butter or olive oil while the beans are cooking, then toss it all together. I've never had greasy or mushy veggies with this recipe. Hmmm... Also, if you can't find fennel where you live, try Target, believe it or not. They're the only store that carries it here.

What am I doing wrong? The shallots and fennel turned greasy and mushy. I don't want to serve greasy veggies with al dente beans. I used the proper 3 TBSP of oil. Bummer, because this looks like a winner...

Love love LOVE this recipe! I make it for my family whenever we get together for a holiday. Sometimes fennel is hard to find so I usually use dried ground fennel seed. Don't sub regular green beans for the haricots verts. It won't be the same- Sooo tasty, easy to make, and healthy. One of my absolute favorites!

This was a great way to make green beans. It allows the freshness of the beans to come through. however, it wasn't the most spectacular thing I've ever made. I'd make it again, but not any time soon.

Excellent side dish - I love fennel, but even people who were hesitant about it gave it a try after getting over their disappointment about not having the "regular" green bean casserole. I couldn't find haricots verts so I just used regular green beans instead, which worked really well.

I served this for Thanksgiving and for Shabbat dinner and people liked it much more than I expected. It came out oily, which surprised me, but the flavors were very nice. I used regular green beans because the haricots verts are very expensive, and the result was not lacking at all.

We were asked to bring green beans to the Thanksgiving dinner. I suggested to my husband to make these. They turned out to be a big hit. They were in the hostess' top 2 dishes of the meal. My 10 year old daughter went back for only the beans when the leftovers were brought out later that evening. Will definitely make these again.

Like others, I too made this for Thanksgiving. Once you've re-warmed the shallots and fennel, the haricots verts really don't need too much. The combination reminded me of the recipe for Spring Vegetables with Shallots and Lemon (Gourmet, April '95). Perhaps a bit of lemon zest as a garnish would be my only addition.
