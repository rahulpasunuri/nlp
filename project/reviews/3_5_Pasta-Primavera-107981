I like this recipe except for all the little tomato skins in the sauce. By the time the tomatoes cook the total of 6-7 minutes, the skins separate from the tomatoes. Next time I would use larger tomatoes, such as romas, and peel them first.

It was nice to have help in the kitchen while making this recipe. Once everything was prepared it came together quite well. I didn't have asparagus and so used broccolini. Not sure if the morel's added anything special and at the same time the entire dish was very tasty. The bite from the red pepper added an interesting burst of flavour when eating it. My family enjoyed it - this recipe is a keeper.

Time consuming, but tasty! The tomato-balsamic topper really makes the dish. I doubled the lemon rind and used herb de Provence when sauteing vegetables. I cut back on the red pepper flakes as I didn't want to spicy for our young daughter, but could have gone full-boat plus and been fine.

I really enjoy this recipe-as have my guests. One variant that I have tried is that I cut down on the cream and butter, then substitute chevre for the parmesan, and arugula for the basil and parsley. I find cream sauces a little bland and the substitutions give the dish a little more snap!

I've made this several times it's amazing but a little time consuming. You really need to follow the recipe as written. Its worth it. The one change that I did make was that I used fresh mushrooms instead of the dried morels. It works well if you cook them separately and add at the end with the tomatoes. I'm sure the morels are great they're just expensive.

work intensive but worth it! I substituted button mushrooms (on a student budget!) and added a bunch of shrimp, which I cooked in an extra rotation of garlic/chili flakes/olive oil between the veggies and the tomatoes. Also my market was out of asparagus so I used broccolini instead. Made it to serve 7 starving students and still had leftovers! Huge pot full of pasta but soooo yummy. Served with a crisp Sav Blanc.

This was really delicious. I used my favorite vegetables and simplified a bit and it came out great. I think next time I would leave out the cream - the veggies, oil and cheese add enough flavor, doesn't really need the extra fat. Will definitely keep making a simplified version in the future.

I appreciate the type A, hyperdetailed instructions in this recipe. However, I think most guests would not be aware of all that, and would think this is nothing special. In addition, how could cream, butter, cheese, fresh herbs and veggies, and morels (very expensive) on pasta not taste good? So . . . delicious but not exceptional.

This is a great sauce base. I was short on time and ingredients so I made a few tweaks that cut the cook time in half and still made an incredible dish: sub red and orange peppers for the green veggies, cook the halved grape tomatoes with the garlic and veggies rather than in a separate sauce and throw in a fistfull of fresh, homegrown basil. It turns out as a light but rich pink sauce with such fresh flavor.

Rating: 4
I very much enjoyed this dish - but it was time-consuming. It's not particularly difficult -- just long. Because of some of the reviews, I added a bit more cream so the sauce was more plentiful. I also made it without mushrooms - because I'm not a huge fan -- but, it was still a wonderful meal (multiple actually) and one I will make again.

I made this recipe for a dinner at a friend's house and, although it was time consuming, it turned out amazingly delicious, well worth the wait. I then made another batch for myself at home with the leftover ingredients and a lot less attention to the precise measurements called for, and the dish was distinctly less awesome. This is a fantastic dish for a dinner party that actually doesn't take that long to cook if you can get your chopping done beforehand, and if you are careful about your measurements you will be rewarded -- the taste is fresh, fresh, fresh!

This is one of the best recipes we've ever made. Only changes were no mushrooms (I hate them) and my husband made fresh pasta. My neighbor claimed this is one of the best things she's ever had in her life. Will make it again and again.

This is a dish for vegetable lovers-- don't bother with it otherwise, you'll resent the time investment. Me, I poured myself a glass of sangria, and had a blast messing up the kitchen. Wonderful with fresh produce, including English peas, from the farm market. My only substitution was fresh brown criminis for the morels; I just used more garlic and a minced shallot in the tomatoes, and there was plenty of flavor. I forgot the lemon zest and the pine nuts, and it was still wonderful. We'll do this one again.

Rating: 4
A ton of work but worth it. Don't cut corners - buy the damned expensive morels, quarter half the friggin' cherry tomatoes, use the calorie-laden heavy cream.... and then, dear cook, then you will come to understand why this recipe is worth it.

This was an okay meal. I subbed julienned zucchini for the green beans and regular white mushrooms for the morels. Added shrimp, cigar-cut spinach, and left out the pine nuts. This recipe makes a TON of food. I cooked for three people, and would have had plenty of leftovers had I halved the recipe. I recommend the addition of the shrimp. I threw some precooked jobs into the pan with drippings from the tomato concoction, and it worked out really nicely to absorb the leftover juices. The red pepper was just the right amount. It worked for both the spicy-food lover and the opposite at the kitchen table. The tomato sauce would be delicious on top of many things, I would believe. It uses just the right amount of balsamic. Cons: The prep time was ridiculous. I have a lot of patience for prep, but this required a lot of chopping and a lot of waiting. I would not make this again due to this factor. It tasted good, but I think the appearance of the food was better than its taste.

This is one of the best pasta primavera I made. Most of the preparation up to spagettini can be made ahead of time. My question to all: what do you serve it with ?

Rating: 3
I didn't use mushrooms, and only halved the tomatoes (I didn't see the point in the qtrs). Additionally, I used light cream and brocolli instead of asparagus. This made the meal cheaper and a little healthier. Really loved this, but its a lot of work.

I would not make this again. Very labor intensive and ends up tasting like two different recipies put together.

Time consuming prep and expensive with all the ingredients but very pretty and tasty! Substituted regular mushrooms and used half and half and it was so good the guests asked for the recipe. Increased the red pepper and garlic. Used regular spagetti. For a side dish I'm going to make the greens in the recipe with the red pepper, garlic and olive oil. Perfect!

I altered this recipe for my mother-in-law who was on a low sodium, dairy-free diet. I left out the cream, cheese, and hot pepper flakes, but it was still excellent. The oil mixed with sauteed tomatoes provided enough sauce. My husband thought it was so tasty that he requested we leave out the cream & cheese in the future too!

Rating: 4
This is currently my favorite meal and I make it every chance I get. I've added sausage a couple times which definitely changes the character but is quite nice. The light cream sauce is delectable, giving the dish just the right amount of heft while still allowing it to be a refreshing, healthy meal. I usually cut back on the oil by about half. I use regular sliced crimini mushrooms, not dried, cooking them with the tomatoes. I also cut back on the red pepper flakes. Because although I do like spice, I don't think this dish needs that much -- it overpowered it when I cooked it per the recipe the first time. But about 1/4 - 1/2 tsp makes for a nice kick on an otherwise subdued plate.

I doubled this recipe for 10 and had a ton of leftovers. I skipped the morels and added sauteed mushrooms into the cream sauce at the end instead. I also added about 1 cup of nice pino grigio in with the cream, based on other reviewers comments about the lack of sauce. I thought it was delicious. I served with grilled shrimp skewers and a spring salad - everyone loved it. Lots of chopping and prep time, but worth it in my opinion.

Yikes. This is almost too good. I altered the recipe slightly by changing the vegetables a bit, but the taste was incredible. I shortened the cooking time by using more pans. But getting it to the table more quickly was worth the extra clean up. I will definitely make this again.

I would have given this 3 1/2 forks. I had to use Porcini because Morels were $13.99 for 1 1/2 oz here but in future, especially if I was making this for company, and I do think this is, despite the work, company worthy, I would make the effort & save my pennies for the Morels. So much of the final flavor with the mushroom steeping sauce is carried into the final dish that it does make a difference & next time I'll go for the Morels. I sauteed my Porcini in with the asparagus & green beans, left out the peas & added a small leek, cut into 1/2-inch slices. I should have put those in first to saute as they take longer. Also, I only par- boiled the asparagus & beans for 2 min to avoid mushiness. My life partner's been eating my nightly home cooking now for 13 years & he rated this a Top 5. Me not so much but oh well. I also trippled the garlic & doubled the hot pepper flakes for two people. I used a box of DeCeeco Spinach Nests and for two dinner servings and one rather large next day leftover serving, I used 8 nests. I made the entire sauce as given so I would have plenty per other reviewers. The pasta does soak up the sauce. I used organic half & half, full fat but think the dish would not suffer if I'd have used fat free half & half. I loved the crunch of the pine nuts and he especially loved the leeks. Plan ahead & this won't be such a chore to make - worth it though.

Excelent. But 1 oz morel is too costly, I used less and next time will add less expensive mushrooms.

This is a wonderful dish. It is a bi-weekly staple in our house. I double the garlic and the chili flakes and use fat free 1/2 & 1/2 (so that we can eat it more often without the fat of whipping cream). Great leftovers that we wake up craving.

It was yummy but a bit too sweet with grape tomatoes and balsamic. Next time I would use regular vine tomatoes to cut down on the sweetness.

This was a very good recipe. I found fresh morels and had to have a recipe to use them in. This was a bit of work, but mostly busy work. Nothing difficult. I added a bit more garlic then the recipe calls for, and a bit more red pepper. Otherwise followed the recipe closely. I'd be tempted to give it four forks, but it's not quite THAT good.

This dish has become a favorite in our hosuehold. I double the amount of sauce and tend to go over-board on the veggies, too--always appreciated by our guests.

I wish there was an option for half-forks - this would be a two and a half, almost a three. It needs tweaking... I did find the sauce a little dry - would make extra next time, which is easily done. Boyfriend commented that with the spicy-creamy veggies and sauce, the balsamic flvours of the tomatoes seemed to just get lost in it all. We'd served the tomatoes seperately over garlic toast as an appie, maybe. But over all a nice, tasty pasta dish.

Yes, this one is difficult but it is a GREAT one to cook with someone, husband, mom, a friend. We made it without the mushrooms (my daughter can't stand them!). The taste takes your breath away, it is that good! It is worth the effort and will WOW your crowd. I can't wait to make it again this weekend with my hubby!

I made this last night for friends and it turned out pefectly...got rave reviews. I loved it and did not think it was time consuming or difficult at all. I did steam the veggies instead of boiling them though. Way more interesting and flavorful than most primavera recipies. A new fave that I will make again and again.

Rating: 3
I made this the other night-basically used the recipe as a 'guide'. (Didn't add mushrooms,lemon zest, herbs or pine nuts, only because I didn't have them on hand) It was spot-on and very good. I would love a recipe without cream so that it would make a lighter, fresher dish. Anyone know one?

Rating: 2
This recipe needs to have the tomato sauce, the vegetables and the cream sauce doubled. It was a bit dry and flavorless. Another Primavera recipe called for 2 cups of cream and 1 1/2 cups of wine. Total: 3 1/2 cups liquid. This recipe, even including the water from the morels, was much less. I also added four leeks, extra garlic, and extra red pepper. In addition, I would make sure I had about three cups total of the vegetables (excluding the leeks). I think you could use Parmesan cheese prepackaged in the bag during your preparation; the Parmigiano Reggiano I used was somewhat wasted. I would grate some of that on the pasta at the table. I will probably also use a bit more of the morels next time.

The penultimate pasta primavera recipe. Was tempted to use fresh mushrooms but tried with dried instead--loved the complex, smoky flavor. Together with the freshness of the lemon zest and the sweet acidity of the balsamic splashed tomatoes, made for a memorable dish!

This dish is a mess of work, but well worth it since it makes oh about a thousand meals if you're only feed two people. I used wood-ear mushrooms instead of morels.

I simply blanched all my veges about 2+ minutes since they get combined and warmed further. I skipped the morels (not kid friendly enough for the price) and added blanched carrots. I used 1/2n1/2 instead of heavy cream and I also ended up making two separate sauces since my kids don't like red pepper flakes. Overall, however, it was worth the effort. Family review was a 'thumbs up'.

Rating: 2
I was disappointed in this recipe after reading all the great reviews. It was bland, and I don't know how that could be with so many great (and expensive) ingredients. There wasn't enough cream sauce to adequately cover the pasta. I may make a version of it again but I'd use half the amount of pasta so that the veggies don't get lost. I'd also lose the morels, they aren't worth the cost. Any other mushroom would be equally good, I think. I would, however, keep the tomato sauce, it's delicious.

Rating: 3
We've made this recipe several times and it always wins rave reviews. We've made the actual recipe and have also varied it quite a bit. Most recently, we took a Southwest turn with grilled corn, grilled tomatoes (with oil and balsamic), red bell peppers and added a chopped, roasted jalapeno to the cream sauce before adding the pasta and veggies. You can't go wrong with this recipe!

Rating: 4
Excellent dish, a little time consuming but worth the effort. To make it more healthy I successfully substituted half-n-half for the cream, and used whole wheat penne. I also substitued veggies I had on hand (carrots, broccoli) but the grape tomato sauce is a MUST. I was also generous with the garlic and red pepper flakes. Yum! A definite company dish!

Rating: 4
Awesome recipe! My partner and I have made it twice - a lot of prep work but well worth it. I prefer steaming the beans & asparagus - if you cook them the length of time in the recipe they get mushy. We substituted the morels with cromini and portabella mushrooms. We have also added some fresh crabmeat and shrimps for variety. This recipe is definately a keeper!!

I really liked this dish- time consuming yes, but easily the best pasta dish most of your friends will have ever tried. Everything you have tasted with the seemingly ubiquitous title "primavera" is a pale, pale version of this recipe. Plus, you can modify ingredients to make it simpler for everyday use.

Rating: 3
This pasta was outstanding but time consuming to make. This is definitely a weekend dish - my husband and I made this together and it still took a couple of hours. The work/prep was well worth it though. We used Monterey Blend dried mushrooms and used a cup of whipping cream rather than 2/3 cup. We're both garlic lovers and LOL at "2 teaspoons minced garlic" - for one or two servings maybe but definitely not for six! Also, we always substitute Asiago for Parmigian as it has a better/nuttier flavor.

I made this dish for the first time last night and served it to 13 people -- evryone raved. I thought it was delicious, and will definitely make it again. It really isn't hard to make -- it's just that the vegetable prep and balnching takes a little time. No big deal.

No pasta primavera recipe should be this involved. Not only very time consuming, but it was amazingly awful.

Fantastic, from a cook who makes pretty much every pasta with vegetable recipe I run across in the magazines. The cream sauce is not too rich, and the tomatoes make the dish. I left out the mushrooms out of personal preference. One could also omit the pine nuts--fewer steps, less money, and they all sink to the bottom of the bowl anyway.

I thought this recipe was too time consuming for what you get. Although, I have to say that I will make the tomato sauce again. It has a very nice fresh taste to it, and the balsamic vingegar really adds some bite. I also used roma tomatoes, along with cherry tomatoes, since I did not have enough.

Throw away any misconceptions you have about the often boring and bland restaurant version of pasta primavera, which is normally served as alfredo sauce w/ peas. This recipe is really tasty, especially with all fresh ingredients. It was a little fussy to make, but it was well worth the effort and is going into our list of keepers. We halved the recipe and it made two generous portions and I substituted chopped roma tomatoes (chopped into 1/2 inch chunks) for grape tomatoes. It worked great without having to make another trip to the store.

This dish had an abundance for flavor that changed with every mouthful. It certainly painted a pretty picture on the serving plater as well.
