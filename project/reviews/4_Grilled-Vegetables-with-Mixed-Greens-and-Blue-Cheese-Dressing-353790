Do not make this without a grill basket for the potatoes. Also, the potatoes should probably be microwaved before putting them on the grill, because by the time the insides were done the outsides were either charred or leathery. When making the fennel, be sure to trim the outer layer, as it doesn't cook especially well.

I've made this twice now, both times to rave reviews. The only thing I changed was that I did not use the shitake mushrooms. Also, the first time I made it, I didn't have dijon mustard, and it was still excellent. The dressing really makes this dish, especially with the combination of vegetables suggested. I grill the potatoes and beets first, in a veggie griller, and then add the rest of the vegetables to the basket once the potatoes and beets are 3/4 done. Then I serve the final vegetable mixture on couscous or quinoa instead of greens to make it more of a meal. Delicious!

I was in search of a good recipe for grilled beets and was not disappointed. But I have to confess that I left a lot of the other veggies out. We just grilled the beets and fennel, tossed with some mixed greens, goat cheese, and the dressing. Delicious and simple salad!

This was a great summertime dinner - the blue cheese really pulled it together. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the shiitake mushrooms - they cooked so much quicker than everything else and kind of got lost with the dressing. Would skip those next time.

This was AMAZING!!!! I cut the veggies smaller than suggested and put them into a veggie platter on our grill. They took a little longer than 12 minutes... more like 20, but it turned out FANTASTIC!!!! I couldn't get my family to be quiet, they were raving about every bite! I will put this onto our regular summer menu.
