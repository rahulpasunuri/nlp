I modified this recipe to use up leftover turkey and it was delicious, and healthy! The modifications were to saute the vegetables in 2 T olive oil (no butter), add the diced cooked turkey later in the saute process after the vegetables had started to soften, and skip the beef broth, tomato paste, and cinnamon. It was a big hit with the whole family; I'll make it again (after next Thanksgiving).

my husband and i made the dish mostly following the recipe but didn't have a red pepper on hand. we also added cinnamon with the second can of tomatoes. i liked the dish, and would make sure the carrots and celery are finely chopped, per the recipe, so they're not still crunchy.

I really liked this recipe. I didn't have any rosemary so I left that out. I added fresh basil during the last five minutes of cooking, which gave a nice fresh taste to the sauce.

This is a very easy, somewhat nutricious, no-frills mid-week recipe. Granted it's not to be served to impress, but it's tasty. I added all the tomatoes at once and didn't have any of the problems the previous reviewer mentioned. I also really liked the interesting light sweetness and aroma of the cinnamon. Overall, it's good, hearty, homey food.

I found this dish to be quite sharp. I tried adding sugar to counteract it with only moderate success. If someone were to try it (I won't be making it again) I would suggest adding all the tomato at once so it has a chance to mellow.

We found this recipe tasty. I added 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes to it and eliminated the cinnamon. It makes a nice midweek meal that comes together in under an hour.

This is alright. We enjoyed it, but this low fat variety isn't quite as scruptious as the real thing. But - we have to watch the waistline!

This was a little bland so we took the other reviewer's suggestion and added a little hot sauce...it was good but not great. Too much chopping and simmering for the end result that is nothing special. I like spaghetti better :)

Had lamb I wanted to use, so I ground my own lamb and made the receipe. Found it to be bland. Added red pepper and tobasco sauce(we like things spicy), that did the trick. Also used allspice as the previous reviewed recommended. Used long fusilli and served with parmesan cheese.

Delightful. One might consider using Allspice rather than cinnamon. Poultry works just fine as the meat, provided that it is ground and crumbled or baked and shredded first, depending on your preference.
