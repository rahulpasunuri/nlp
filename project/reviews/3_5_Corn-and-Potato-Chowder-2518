I gave this one a try. It is very easy to make. It does not take a lot of time. It tastes great. I followed the recipe to the letter. I served it with crunchy bread. I will be making it again. A great weeknite meal.

I did this recipe for a Halloween party this year, and it went really well! I served it in a fairytale pumpkin, which imparted some subtle flavors into it, and also kept it steaming hot for OVER five hours! Lid on, of course. I made this as a vegetarian course simply by leaving out the bacon, and switched four medium shallots for the onion. Instead of whole milk, I used half heavy cream and half milk (only because I ran out of cream). I definitely would recommend this recipe and use it another time, too!

I don't stray from the recipe when I make it in winter though I have used a vegetarian bacon and it works well. I've also added steamed carrots for some extra vitamins but for the most part I like it as is. In the summer I substitute the frozen and canned corn with a half dozen ears roasted on the grill (leave the husks on to grill and remove after), use 1/2 skim and 1/2 whole milk, and use basil instead of thyme. It's every bit as good just a little more summery.

I've made this several times, and I always make a large quantity so we can freeze for quick meals. It's simple to make and delicious! I thicken it a bit with instant potato flakes, if it's not as thick as I like.

AMAZINGLY GOOD!!!

I've made this several times, and everyone has loved it. I add 2 tablespoons of butter when I cook the onions, I like the flavor - and I also like sage better than thyme. If it's too thin, add some potato flakes to thicken it up.

I've been using this recipe for AGES! My family members ask for it as soon as the weather starts getting chilly. Everyone here LOVES it! That's from 62 to 7 years old, and plenty in between there. I just always add lighty boiled carrot slices, and chopped (bite sizes) of ham. It's simply Heavenly! Since I don't have fresh herbs, I just use the dry.

I made this with 1% milk. It was delicious, easy, and made everyone happy in the family!

This is one of my standard soups - always a winner. Make sure to use fresh thyme. You can also use evaporated milk if you don't have fresh.

I've made this soup tice now, once with yukon golds and the other with russets. The russet version is much better and I left the skin on the potatoes as well for a more rustic soup. I used 1% milk and sprinkled a few bacon crumbles on top in the serving bowl. This is great for a cold weather supper with a nice glass of white wine, and a roaring fire! Enjoy!

Great as is--didn't make any changes and everyone loved it. A keeper

This chowder was ok, nothing special. I followed other reviewers advice and used half milk and half chicken broth for the liquid. The chowder still tasted pretty bland to me, even after salt, pepper, thyme and red pepper flakes. I also added a diced carrot for more interest. This still tasted really bland to both me and my boyfriend, with not much corn flavor. This was very easy to make and satisfied a craving for something hot on a cold night. But I'm certain there are better corn chowder recipes out there, which I will try next.

This soup was delicious, with just a few modifications...It was a little thick for my taste, so I skipped the creamed corn and used 2% milk instead. I also blended it to make it more of a "cream of potato" chowder. With enough red pepper and a little carrot, it turns out a fun pink color. Try melting some cheddar cheese on top for an extra zip.

I don't use the red pepper in this recipe. Instead I add a cup of chicken or turkey. I use a cup of chicken stock in place of one cup of milk to give a bit more flavour. Also, try using sage instead of thyme for a great change of pace. This recipe was so good that my sister insisted on taking the leftovers home!

Delicious. Next time I would be more generous with making it spicy. I would use 1 % or skim milk (maybe 1/2 1% and 1/2 skim) next time. I used whole milk, as I was worried about the thickness of the soup, to me it seemed really rich and almost too thick (especially when reheating a few days later). otherwise would definately repeat this recipe. Also, used turkey bacon instead of pork bacon - delicious but maybe a bit more nutritious.

Outstanding recipe & very easy

My daughter loves this chowder. I just add a little bit more bacon and potatoes, and I include a half of Goya chicken bouillon. The results are creamier and tastier for us.

An excellent recipe, and easy too!

This was great--made it the night before (tripled the recipe) and warmed it up in a crockpot for a group lunch. Just needed a little extra milk to thin it slightly. I used lots of fresh ground pepper and stirred in about a tablespoon of butter while it was simmering. (Some in our group are vegetarian, so I followed the recipe, but left out the bacon and just sauteed the onion in a little olive oil.)

I don't know, there was just something missing with this chowder. It was all right, but pretty unmemorable.

This soup is delicious. I have now made it 3 times. It is very good as leftovers...personally one of my largest criteria for good food! Good bad weather food!

Very good. The chowder turned out quite thick. I added a little more milk, still thick, added a little bit of chicken broth. Everyone loved it. While they ate theirs, I snuck a tiny bit of chipotle into mine.

I don't usually alter recipes so much the first time I try them, but I was missing several ingredients so improvised, and came up with some good alternatives. I used chopped ham and added chopped carrots and 4 cloves of minced garlic. I also stirred about 2 T flour into my milk before adding it, and I used about 2 1/2 C total of skim milk. I followed other reviewers and skipped the creamed corn. Didn't have thyme, so I used basil and also added some dried chipotle pepper. Finally, I used my immersion blender at the end to blend the soup just a little--just enough to blend some of the corn kernels and potatoes to create a thicker overall texture but keep most of the veggies intact. So...it's a little different than the recipe, but this was a great starter for some creativity in the kitchen!

This was pretty good and I would make it again,. In order to thicken it, I added 2 tb of flour when I was sauteeing the potatoes/red pepper. I also added some broccoli to add more veggies. Not sure what the purpose of the bacon is... seems to be in a lot of corn chowder recipes.

Rating: 3
This was quite good. I used all kernel corn as I bought the wrong kind, and it seemed fine. I thickened it with a little flour mixed with water. Next time I will use half chicken broth and half milk, as I found it too fatty-tasting (we usually drink 1% milk). Also will add less thyme. Otherwise, good comfort food!!

I have been making this dish for years and had lost my recipe clipping. It's rich and creamy and I like to triple so I'll have some leftovers.

An easy crowd pleaser. Made it with all frozen corn instead of part creamed corn. Added thickener. Nothing fancy just good eats. Would definitely make it again.

This is the first recipe on the site I've rated, and with good reason. This is a flavorful, easy chowder to make, and I'd reccommend it to anyone. I used 1c chicken broth and 1c 1/2% milk. Cut the fat and calories and was still thick and creamy. Great for a quick, but impressive, week night dinner.

I altered this a bit. I increased the bacon to 1/3 lb and removed it from the pan prior to adding the onions (I increased the amount of onions as well). I used a 15 oz can of chicken broth instead of milk. I pureed the ingredients prior to adding the 2 types of corn, thyme, cooked bacon and salt and pepper. This really came out well.

As an old New Englander who loves chowder but doesn't have the time do the all day affair, this recipe is terrific.

I thought this dish was okay. Wasn't as thick as I like my chowders. My husband liked it even less than I did.

Rating: 3
I did add another cup of milk, and would next time deglaze with chicken broth. I also added a chopped shallot and 1 thinly sliced bunch of scallions to add to the onion flavor and add color. I added extra dried thyme(since my fresh was under 18" of snow), and chopped fresh parsley to top. A great and easy and very comforting soup that I'll take to neighbors, friends etc.

Next time I'll try some of variations other cooks experimented with--great soup for this cold weather!

I made this corn chowder and it came out GREAT! But of course I made changes. I added vegetable broth to the chowder after I was done cooking the bacon, onions, and pepper. (It deglazed the bottom of the pot.) I then added the potatos and let them simmer in the the 2 cans of vegetable broth with the bacon. I then added the milk and seasonings. I added much more corn than the recipe called for (more kernel corn than cream corn) and I also left out the thyme. It came out spectacular. Everybody loved it!

Rating: 3
Nice comfort food soup. Ended up using quite a bit more milk than called for and a few dashes of hot pepper sauce - not tradtional for a chowder but to my family's taste.

This is a great recipe for a cold winter night. I used cans of creamed corn and it turned out just fine. I also used fresh parsley instead of thyme and it was great.

my wife and I loved it!my changes were to season chicken breasts with salt&pepper and grill it along with fresh corn.I added the corn when potato was cooked and pureed a small amount to thicken & then added the grilled chicken. this gave it anice smoky flavor.MMMMMM

This soup has great color and tasted fantastic. Use fresh thyme if you can. I substituted unpeeled red potatoes, cut into 1/2 inch peices for the russet potato. I also sprinkled a little flour over the vegetables, and added double the milk.

I love corn chowder, and this is just so tasty with a few caveats I usually have salt pork on hand, and I used that instead of bacon...very tasty. I concur with both of the other reviewers... 1. Creamed corn makes the whole thing "soggy." 2. My mother raised me on chowders made with evaporated (skimmed) milk. Chowder any other way is weird. This is my new "pantry standby"

Rating: 3
Delicious, although I will omit the creamed corn next time as it just muddied the sweet flavor of the fresh corn.

This is an easy (and hearty)lunch recipe to make for guests. If you don't have whole milk, you can substitute evaporated milk. I make it frequently.
