I just season to taste so it's hard to comment on measurements in this recipe. I typically add some greek olives cut in half. Be somewhat liberal as the salty taste of the olives goes great with the potatoes. Super yum!

This is simple and very good. Even my very particular kids liked it!

yum! quartered potatoes, tossed in olive oil, fresh pressed garlic cloves, freshly chopped rosemary and oregano from garden, sea salt, and coarsely ground pepper.

I loved this recipe. Very simple and fast to throw together. I used fingerlings so didn't need to worry about cutting them. I used 4 large rosemary sprigs from own garden. Kosher salt takes them to wonderful. However, dh says it's probably because I'm a potato lover.

Right mix of ingredients, terrible proportions and preparation. But fixes can take this from two stars to four. Heeding the advice of others, I cut the potatoes into quarters, or halves, if they were small to begin with. I broke up a full head of garlic, and added it to the mix. Also cracked a bit of fresh pepper, and increased the salt and the rosemary, slightly. Used sea salt to finish after they came out of the oven and rested a moment. As for the cooking, after 30 minutes at 450, I removed the pan, and mixed the potatoes around slightly, to get some more even browning. Be careful when you cut them smaller, as they wont require quite as much cooking time. After 30 minutes, they are acceptable..but at 45, they begin to border on overcooked.

Very bland. Would half or quarter potatoes next time and add garlic and pepper.

Last night I used a pound of new red potatoes, cut into the proper size chunks. Mixed a bit of salt and a few sprinkles of powdered rosemary into the oil. They were done in less than 1/2 hour. It was a bit bland--next time I would use 1/4 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. powdered rosemary. We really enjoyed these potatoes!!!
