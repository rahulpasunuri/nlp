This was so simple and good! I used frozen butternut squash cubes from Whole Foods. I also added about a tsp of cinnamon to the water.

This is fantastic! Tastes great, can be made in advance and almost no fat. A welcome side dish on the fat-laden holiday table.

Yum! This is so easy and so good! I made it the night before Thanksgiving and momentarily consider eating the whole thing myself instead of serving it to guests.

A very good Squash variation to serve at Thanksgiving.

Excellent dish to serve at the holidays. Very creamy and the squash has a nice earthy flavor. I added extra Maple syrup. Easy to make too!

Delicious! I made it two days ahead, it reheated beautifully! Also, the supermarket was completely out of butternut, so we used acorn squash, it was delightful...

This is a great dish that I have been making every Thanksgiving for several years, and it's always praised. It's a nice alternative to sweet potatoes if you're making mashed, and it provides one healthy dish for the Big Meal! It's very simple to make, and you can make it 3 days ahead and reheat it. Best of all, I've seen people initally pass it over, hearing that it's squash, and then try some and then go for seconds!
