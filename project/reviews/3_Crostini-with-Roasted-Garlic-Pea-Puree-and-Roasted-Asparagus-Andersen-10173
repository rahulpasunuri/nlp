These were good, and I'd make again. Everyone who I served them to liked them a lot. A lot of flavor for simple ingredients. Very green and spring-like.

I thought this was very good, and everyone I served it to really liked it. It's very green--good for St. Patrick's Day! Very fresh and spring-like.

I made these crostini from what I believe was a 1998 recipe in Gourmet. Instead of asparagus they were topped with arugula and shavings of romano cheese. Overall a great party nosh and big hit!

Though an odd sounding combination, this turned out to be an excellent, bright and flavorful spring appetizer. Upon tasting these, everyone's reaction was astonished delight. The bread could be toasted and the garlic roasted in advance, but I would mix the peas and garlic fairly shortly before serving. The garlic is strong enough without any extra time for the flavor to further develop.
