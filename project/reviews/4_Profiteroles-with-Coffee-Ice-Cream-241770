This review pertains only to the profiteroles, but they came out beautifully and were very, very easy. I used salted caramel ice cream instead of coffee, and I just used purchased chocolate sauce, which was appropriate for the quickie dessert I wanted to whip up. Would definitely use this profiterole recipe again and again.

Made this for me and my partner and they turned out fantastic. I've not done much with pastry before but this is a fun easy and quick recipe. I would definitely make these again.

What an easy and AWESOME recipe! I was so nervous because I've never made this kind of batter before but it was so easy and came out exactly as the directions said they would. I even made my profiteroles huge on accident and they still puffed up beautifully. Mine took about 15 minutes. And the chocolate sauce!!! Oh. my. GOD. so good!! I've never made caramel either and again, the instructions were spot on. The caramel base really adds another dimension to the chocolate. When you add the ice cream, it's over the top good. The cold, creaminess and the soft, puffiness and the warm richness of the sauce are awesome together!! Don't be intimidated, you can do it!

I made only the profiteroles without the chocolate sauce or ice cream (will be filling them with a different kind of creme tonight), & they were perfectly lovely. Actually I expected them to be good, but ended up being surprised by just how good they were. I doubled the recipe & used slightly under half a cup of whole milk instead of water & the flavor was very evident in the final product - in a great way! I also used salted butter & decreased the amount of salt I added simply because I didn't have unsalted butter on hand. Next time I make these (next weekend in fact!) I'll used unsalted to see the difference, but it sure didn't make them taste bad this time around!

just used the dough recipe. followed others advice about adding milk instead of all water and a bit of sugar. made homemade vanilla ice cream and piped it into the middle with a pastry bag. served with homemade whipped cream and a chocolate/merlot sauce I had on hand. Was amazing!

Not the greatest profiterole recipe I've ever made, but still pretty tasty. I recommend adding 1 tbsp sugar to the choux batter, and use a bit of milk instead of all water. The last time I made them I added 1/4 cup of chopped pecans just cause I had them and was bored and they were delicious! Also, if you do not have a pastry bag, which is not necessary, make sure you spoon them between two spoons a few times so the batter is tight and smooth, otherwise they will not puff up that well and will have many fractures releasing that precious CO2.

Because the chocolate sauce has a base of a caramel flavor, it doesn't taste like the simple, traditional dark chocolate sauce. It is rather a caramel-chocolate sauce and is delicious, but as an fyi, it leans to the sweeter side as a result.

This was a snap to make, and everyone practically licked the plate! I took the advice of another reviewer and added some milk to the pastry mix - it was a nice touch. The puffs were light and airy - I can't wait to try the choux pastry for something else!

I think this was good:)I used strawberry icecream and a star tip to pipe out of bag. I would make this again

Oh my...heaven on earth. The sauce is to die for, and it's so easy to make. Lick the plate clean good, this is a must-try for anyone looking to impress. I chose vanilla ice cream instead of coffee, and it was amazing.

No one in my family really cared for these. In all fairness, we wouldn't dive into a plate of cream puffs either, so it might just be personal taste. Found them eggy and bland.

These are truly EASY to make and absolutely delicious. Don't worry if you've never made profiteroles before, it is fast and simple. Everyone loved this dish. I have one major recommendation, however - do not make the chocolate sauce in advance. Make it right before serving. I made it two hours in advance and kept it warm on the stove. Nonetheless, the fat separated and although it tasted good still the texture had turned clumpy and unattractive. It takes no time to make so I advise you to wait, or make on-site wherever you take it.

This recipe was just fabulous. I decided to try it out for our easter desert after reading the reviews. My pastry bag actually broke as I was piping out the first profiterole so I just used two spoons to place mounds of even size on my pan. They still turned out amazingly! I did a less complicated chocolate sauce and used a hazelnut gelato. Cant wait to make it again!

I made this recipe for my classmates and it was a tremendous hit, I am on a diet and trying to stay away from sweets but I couldnt resist, they were so utterly delectable. I made mini versions and ended up with about 40. Great foolproof recipe

Great recipe! We had a similar dish once in shanghai and my fiance loved it. The pastries are surprisingly easy to make. I don't have an electric mixer or pastry bag, but it worked fine beating it by hand and using two spoons to dollop the batter onto the sheet.

I made this exactly to the recipe, but used vanilla and strawberry ice cream in addition to the coffee. Delicious! Perfectly puffed pastries. I don't have a pastry bag, but a zip sandwich bag worked just as well. One tip I found helpful: By putting the dough down in two bursts, the pastries had a natural break which made cutting them very easy.

Very good. Used Starbucks Classic Coffee ice cream. The sauce does take a while to make (the caramel takes time), so be sure to plan for that. I used 4 oz. Ghirardelli Semisweet and 3 oz 70% cacao Bittersweet, and added the brandy at the end. It was very thick, but oh, so delicious! Next time, I think I'll try adding 2 Tbs. of Grand Marnier instead and see how that works.

I'm a pastry chef, just signed up a few minutes ago, and though I haven't tried this recipe, this is exactly how we make the puffs: great instructions, bravo!

My 17 year old daughter made these for my birthday last week--very, very good. The Profiteroles were tender and flaky, and the chocolate sauce was simply outstanding. She used low-fat coffee ice cream without diminishing the richness of this excellent dessert.

Since I had homemade mocha ice cream and chocolate sauce in the fridge, I only needed to make the profiteroles. This recipe is VERY EASY and the profiteroles were perfect.

The first time I tried to make profiteroles, as a young married woman, they turned out like blinis: little, flat pancakes! I went through three batches that night before I came up with cream puffs that actually puffed! This recipe is absolutely IDIOT PROOF! Fast, simple, delicious. A note: when re-heating the chocolate sauce in the microwave: make sure you lower the heat level from maximum. If you don't, or if you heat it too long, the fats separate from the chocolate...unless it's the melted sugar that separates...and it is very hard to get the liquids back into the chocolate, so that the resulting sauce is too thick and gloppy. Still, YUM!

These were fantastic, surprisingly easy to make, and a huge hit with my guests. I thought the coffee ice cream detracted a bit from the taste of the pastry and the chocolate sauce and would stick to the traditional vanilla when serving them again.

I used a mocha ice cream with fudge and roasted almonds which was a nice addition. Also substitued ghirardelli sweet ground chocolate and cocoa for the chocolate bar in the sauce. Big hit with my guests - Really tasty!

Very similar to a recipe that I use from the Barefoot Contessa, Ina Garten. She uses milk instead of water and I find it makes a richer dough even when using skim milk

Absolutely divine. The profiteroles are so easy to make. Instead of pastry bag I just used a plastic bag and cut the corner to pipe out the dough. Didn't have bittersweet chocolate so I used a semi sweet dark chocolate and cut back the sugar to a little over 1/4 cup. Used brandy instead of cognac. This recipe makes A LOT of chocolate sauce. I would suggest cutting the recipe in half for serving of 6. Served with haagen- dazs coffee ice cream right out of the container. This was surprisingly simple to make and phenomenally delicious.. I will be making these for guests.
