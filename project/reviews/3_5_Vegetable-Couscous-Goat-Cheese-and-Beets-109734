utterly fantastic & combo is something i would not have thought of. only changes i made were using veg stock instead of water, tomato couscous instead of plain, fig vinegar instead of sherry, & fine chopped scallion instead of chives. the beets really offset this brilliantly. i made it twice yesterday & will make it again today.

unbelievable flavors! i substituted a scallion for the chives, veg stock for the water, tomato couscous instead of plain, & fig vinegar for the sherry. absolutely perfect!

So for clarification - are the beets in this dish raw?

Excellent couscous. This has become a common side for my family in the summer months. Just add herbs to couscous, rather than rolling cheese in them. A lot less work!

Okay. I just made a riff on this with pearl (Israeli) couscous, the same vegetables (fresh corn), but instead of rolling the goat cheese in dill, I added dill to the veggies just as they were done cooking. I used fig-infused balsamic vinegar instead of sherry and added minced garlic to the dressing. Then after everything was tossed together with the dressing and couscous, I added one tablespoon of spreadable goat cheese to the couscous salad and stirred it in gently. Wow. FANTANTASIC!

This dish has become a staple for us. We love it. Most times I use plain goat cheese. The beets give a nice crunch. One comment, only use fresh corn. Frozen corn gave a mushy texture,

This is a good dish. I roasted my beets whole for 1 hour at 350, then sliced and tossed with the vinaigrette. The goat cheese is crucial to the flavor of the dish. It is so pretty, but could have had a little more flavor.

We made this into a "family-style" dish by quadrupling the recipe (and then some!), cubing the beets and dispensing with the molding step. I served it in attractive bowls with beets on one side, couscous on the other, and garlic-and-herb chevre atop. My daughter is allergic to zucchini, so I substituted some leftover chard-with-leeks. After the first few bites my daughter said, "I'm not finished yet, but I hope there's more." It's also much simpler than it sounds: this is just beets vinaigrette, a little stirfry or sofrito mixed into (practically) instant grain, and a garnish of soft cheese.

I did not mold this, just served it spread out on a plate for dinner. I thought the proscuitto superfluous as the goat cheese and beets have such strong flavor. My husband also loved it!

I have made this dish twice, I liked it so much. I made a few adjustments and I think they worked fine. The first time, I purchased the goat cheese with dill already coating it, much easier! The second time I made it, I used smoked salmon instead of the proscuitto for those who don't eat meat and they loved it. I also just used plain goats milk cheese without the herbs on the outside, and used a bit of dried dill in my dressing and everyone was happy.

My husband, who swears that he hates couscous, couldn't stop eating this. I used chicken broth instead of water and skipped the prosciutto. Delicious!

Already made this dish twice! my hubby and I loved it. Replaced water with veggie broth and added a dash of lemon juice to the couscous mixture. The beets add a definite flavor and the goat cheese with the dressing is the perfect tangy accompaniment! Server it with a sprig of cilantro and voila... it looked as yummy as it tasted!

skipped the beets altogether. very yummy! light, summery--would be great with grilled salmon.
