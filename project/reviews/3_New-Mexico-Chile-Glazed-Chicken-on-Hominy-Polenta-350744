This has become a staple at our house. Lots of flavour and made with "stuff" you have around the house. Although I will admit I skipped the organic and went with the regular, grocery store stock.

After reading the reviews, I made the sauce using two dried New Mexico chiles, and two dried ancho chiles. This did add a bit more heat. We really enjoyed this meal and we served it with the spinach radish slaw also found at this website.

Made the sauce exactly as specified and it was delicious--not at all thin. I was a bit concerned that it would be too spicy, but it was not. For those looking for a spicy sauce, I'd agree that adding chipotle power or diced whole chiles would be nice. We grilled our chicken. I substituted white hominy for yellow, and that made for bland color pallet so stick with yellow if you have it.

My sauce also came out very watery, and was not at all notable. The roasting in the oven part seemed entirely superfluous- the chicken could easily have been sauted. I used regular polenta as I couldn't find hominy, and added mozzarella cheese, and the polenta was more popular than the chicken.

A really interesting combination of flavors. My only complaint is that despite closely following the directions, my sauce came out very watery but I'm not sure why. Also, I cut down on the amount of butter used (just one tablespoon to saute the chicken and two in the polenta) and roasted the meat for about half an hour -- they weren't cooked through by eight minutes in. I served this with a side of black beans cooked with cumin, serrano pepper, and green onions. Delicious, easy, and pretty healthy with the modifications in butter.

This was very successful, in my opinion, for being such a simple dish. I really liked the sauce, and the hominy was yummy. I agree that I might blend the hominy more finely. Also, I might try it with less butter all around to keep the fat down.

This was good! Though I totally changed it up. I didn't have the New Mexico chilies, but I did have a can of green enchilada sauce, which I opened and heated separately. I also didn't want to heat up the oven for only 8 minutes of baking time. So I pounded the chicken breasts until about 1/2" thick and sautéed for about 4 minutes a side. I followed the recipe the rest of the way. I really like the hominy. I am going to buy the chilies the next time I am at the store as the sauce sounds amazing.

I didn't really like this dish. The sauce came out watery (I used the 3/4 cup broth the recipe called for) and a bit too sweet for my liking. Maybe I should have added some chipotle? Also I used a tube of polenta (cooked down with a bit of milk and butter) instead of the hominy. Overall, I thought it was bland and lacked any "wow appeal".

A lot of flavor for little work. The sauce reminded me of mole without the chocolate. Added about 3/4 tsp of chipotle chili powder to give it more spice. I was skeptical of the hominy but it worked just fine.

I agree, the sauce was just like enchilada sauce! Which was fine with me. I had never even seen hominy before, so that part was interesting, and my husband and I both enjoyed it.

Easy and tasty weeknight meal. I really liked the sauce and did not feel a need to add anything else to it. In fact, I made the sauce a second time to use for enchiladas, which was a fantastic improvement on my recipe (I usually use canned El Pato to dip tortillas in before filling). Next time, I might chop the hominy a bit more to get more of a polenta feel. I love hominy, but the course chop had an odd "mouth feel" to me. I'd prefer it whole or better chopped, I think.

I really liked the way this came out. It is a light dish, the hominy was tasty and the sauce was a nice sweet and spicy combination. I think for more heat I'd add in some pepper flakes next time.

This has real possibilities, except that the sauce is somewhat bland. I added 1 chopped chipotle chile to the sauce mixture in the blender, which helped liven it up. The hominy polenta was quite tasty, and the whole meal came together very quickly
