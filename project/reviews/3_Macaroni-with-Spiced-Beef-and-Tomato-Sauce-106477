This is quite delicious...a really interesting blend of spices. I make it as described.

I love this recipe, it's a nice break from classic Italian, it freezes well for on-the-go lunches, and it's great comfort food along with a salad and a good glass of hearty red. Thums down to the 'cook' from Scranton who added cumin and garlic powder, didn't add cinnamon or cloves, & then had the nerve to rate the recipe! He/she missed the whole point of the recipe Bleah!

What I like about this dish is that it's so simple to prepare, yet its flavor is complex enough to take it out of the blah, everday meal category. It's great with a simple salad and a good bottle of red wine

This was not supposed to be a gastronomical fete....just a quick simple meal. I didn't follow the recipe....I don't like cloves or cinnamon in my food....so I did my own thing. Added cumin, garlic powder, salt pepper but did sprinkle it with parm at the end.....I thought it was excellent and better than hamburger helper...which is what I was trying to imitate.

Really good weeknight dinner. I used 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon; 1/16 teaspoon cloves; no wine; 1 can diced tomatoes with sauce; 1 teaspoon salt; 2 pressed garlic cloves; and small macaroni that I had on hand. Great flavor. Any more cinnamon or nutmeg and it would have been too strong. This makes enough to serve 6 to 8 people.

One of the least successful recipes from this site. Too much cinnamon, and the addition of cloves doesn't help much either. You'd be better off with Hamburger Helper.

One of my regular recipes that everyone we serve it to loves. It is unique and complex and is not supposed to be "tomato-ey" or an Italian red sauce. If you like mediterranean/Morrocan/layered spice flavors, you will love this. I love the cinnamon and usually add more to taste. It uses basic staples and is delicious. I usually sub 1 can of diced Muir Glen tomatoes and a tablespoon of double concentrated tomato paste, since fresh, tasty tomatoes are seasonal.

One of my go-to comfort foods is Stouffers Mac and Beef microwave dinner. I wanted to find a homemade version to help me save money and maybe a few calories. I think this is just the recipe Ive been looking for. I followed the recipe, and only made the following modifications AFTER I had a chance to taste the true recipe. I used canned diced tomatoes, and assumed 1 can for 2 tomatoes. Seeking a redder, saucier Mac and Beef, I added an additional 2 cans of diced tomatoes with juice, another 8oz can of tomato sauce, and more red wine. To round out the spice I added a pinch of red pepper flakes, a dash of paprika, and a little crushed garlic. I didnt rinse the macaroni after draining, and simmered the macaroni in the sauce, trying to get the sauce to stick to the mac, and using the pasta starch to help thicken the sauce. Overcooked pasta? No problem, that way it's just like Stouffer's! Even after the modifications the cinnamon is very prominent in taste and smell, I will probably use a whole cinnamon stick next time for a milder flavor.

I pesonnally liked this a lot. It was subtle and just plain good. It sort of reminded me of a Pasticcio that I make but with out the fat and richness. I subbed the fresh tomatoes for canned and ditched the tomato sauce. I also added 1 tablespoon of concentrated tomato paste. I though of this as "comfort food".

This is one of those loaves-and- fishes recipes that you might not appreciate until you've made it and found it to be better the second day and to even accommodate a couple of unexpected guests. You can add or substitute what you happen to have on hand (green pepper, fresh mozzarella slices), and add more cooked macaroni and more tomato sauce and a little water if it seems to need it for reheating. It's very good with a green salad and fresh orange slices.

Eh. Although it looked and smelled promising, we were not wild about the spice combination. Too much cinnamon. It wasn't divorce-worthy as some reviewers suggested (we made it through the meal without calling a lawyer), but wouldn't make it again.

I definitely agree with the people who liked it. Add more tomato paste, as recommended, and I toss in raisins as well. Note: Instead of large macaroni, elbows work well, and I imagine that shells would be splendide.

I've been making a version of this dish since I was 12 -- now my kids love it. Feel free to experiment with all the spices other reviewers mention, but to leave out the cinnamon is to make something else entirely. It is THE signature flavor of the dish. Try sticks instead of the ground version for a milder flavor, but I use both with the cloves, too. Try topping it with a traditional grated Greek cheese like Mitzithra or Kefalotiri or even Ricotta Salata. Double it & freeze half for another night. As for the bechamel -- that's a baked dish -- entirely different. This is a quick weeknight meal.

This is one of our favorite dishes. It originally appeared in the Bon Appetit Mediterranean issue, which was filled with tons of amazing recipes. If you don't understand the story behind the recipe (a merging of greek, morrocan, and turkish flavors/influences) then you won't understand this dish. If you replace the spices then you take away the mediterranean flavor and make it something else, like Italian, which completely misses the point. A little background really helps. The only alteration I've made is to double the tomato sauce so it doesn't dry out. This is one of the easiest and most delicious dishes in my repertoire!

I don't know what people find wrong about this recipe but I personally couldn't get enough of what it ended up being. People who complain about cinnamon might be using the wrong teaspoon to measure the spices. Just a touch of cinnamon gives the dish an amazing flavor that you cannot get any other way. For a kick add some Tabasco, red pepper, cumin and oregano. Boil some pasta, put on some music and pour some ouzo and you'll be sailing to a Greek island in a matter of minutes. Enjoy the flavor while you are there.

there are a few things i think are wrong about this recipe. first, i would get rid of the cinnamon, cayenne, and cloves, and instead use nutmeg and oregano. then i would replace the red wine with white wine. i get the general idea behind the "pastitsada" but the flavors aren't quite right.

A recipe like this can cause a divorce. My husband looked at me like I was feeding him dog food. My kids threatened to move out.

Like old-fashioned American beef macaroni, with the addition of cinnamon. Don't think it adds that much; not bad, but probably won't make again.

We used a 12 oz package of Smart Ground (meatless, soy, ground beef replacement) instead of the meat and otherwise followed the recipe. It was pretty good. If you use the brand of soy that doesn't require refrigeration, this would be a great back-packing or river rafting recipe.

Not one of the better recipes on this site. The cinnamon was over powering. With out a doubt I will never make this again.

My family ate this dish but they were not wild about it. The cinnamon and meat combination is just a little strange.

This was wonderful. I made it on a weeknight whim because I had all the ingredients on hand. I used large rigatoni for the pasta and added an extra tsp. of cinnamon to the sauce after tasting. I tossed in several handfuls of fresh spinach at the end (I like to have green w/every meal) and it wilted perfectly in the sauce. Superb!!!

I made this exactly as written, except that I used a handful of cherry tomatoes instead of two larger ones. They have more flavour at this time of year. I wasn't expecting anything exceptional but this was surprisingly delicious and amazingly quick and easy. We sprinkled some really good Parmiggiano Reggiano over the top and served it with a mixed green salad, crusty bread and a robust red wine. Almost as good as Marcella Hazan's bolognese sauce and made in a fraction of the time.

Wonderful recipe. I too added the brown sugar and found it added a smooth flavor to the beef. I incorporated additional items such as a pressed clove of garlic, salt & pepper. I didn't have cayenne so I used Gebharts powder. I also used a Radiatore pasta which held the meat sauce great!

This is an easy meal with some interesting flavours. I added some sliced mushrooms, chopped red peppers and garlic to make it a little less meaty and it was enjoyed by both the adults and the kids.

This is a winner. Next time I'll increase all of the spices though... the flavor was good but not quite strong enough. Very good with a simple salad.

This recipe is very good, but I make a variation of this that no one may be interested in. I use a combination of ground chuck, ground veal and ground pork- kind of like a meatloaf mix. I add 4 whole allspice and a half astick of cinnamon instead of ground. The ground cinnamon can be overwhelming. I also let it cook for about 45 minutes longer. This really helps the flavors meld together. Every Greek has a variation of this recipe.

First off it's supposed to be meaty, so I'm not sure what other cooks were complaining about. The cinnamon is a lovely compliment to the beef - and a nice change. I added some grated orange peel, garlic and let it cook slow for a bit longer than suggested. Indeed cooking it the day before is amazing, if you can deal with it.

I only liked this dish once I had added a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar. Until then, I thought I had a dud on my hands. I would make it again, only because my family absolutely loved it and I have picky children.

This is a very meaty dish. I made it for my boyfriend and he liked it, and although Iliked the spices, I thought it was just too meaty.

Wouldn't make this one again. The cinnamon and beef together created a not so appetizing aroma. The dish tasted good, but getting past that initial whiff of spiced meat was difficult. For an easy mac and beef dish, I think I'll stick to the old italian garlic marinara combo instead of this one.

Rating: 2
Lets see: I wouldn't advise Cinnamon again- I was sceptical and the results reinforced my thinking. Besides that, for a quick pasta recipe, its ok. I don't see how you can make a marinara based sauce and not add Garlic. Chump.

I really liked this. The onion, cinnamon, cloves, and meat where delicious together. I used 1/2 lb pasta as opposed to 1lb. It's piquant, spicy, zesty. A little bit sweet and a little bit zesty. It was even better after a day or two when the spices had melded.

I think I added too much cinnamon, because my brain kept thinking it should have some apples or some whip cream on top (kidding). Also I added all the meat sauce to the macaroni at once. This made it a bit dry, and I only had 6 ounces of macaroni vs. the 8 it asked for, so I would have added about another 4-8 ounces of tomato sauce, if I plan on doing that combination next time. Also I had to drain the meat, because I couldn't find ground sirloin, so had to go for lean hamburger, which still had a bunch of fat in it. Then I had to add about 200 shakes of salt from my salt shaker to satisfy my pallet. Boyfriend's comment twards it was "this is really good", I enjoyed it- but kept thinking of the power flavor of cinnamon, so I think next time I'll add more tomato sauce and be more carefull with the cinnamon. It was an easy and fast meal, which I can appreciate during the work week, and we enjoyed the rest of the wine on the side! Plus for two people there were left overs galore, which made for a fast lunch the next day.

We LOVED this dish. I'm not a huge fan of ground meat, but the flavor is so good. I preferred ground turkey to beef. Also, I doubled the cayenne, cloves, and cinammon....and added a crushed clove of garlic! Definatley a step above 'chili-mac'....

Very simple and tasty, mediterranean chili mac. The kids really enjoyed this dish.
