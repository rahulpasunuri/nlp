Wow-I thought this was great. The flavor was delicious and it was a nice alternative to regular steamed green beans. I'll definitely make again. I have plenty of leftover pesto, which I'm looking forward to using with something else this week.

I liked this pesto recipe, but next time I'd forego shocking the green beans. I'd just drain them, return them to the pan, add the pesto and toss them. Either that or follow the suggestion below to add them to a saute pan and warm them up, to avoid serving cold green beans.

This pesto really made ordinary beans special! I recommend putting the beans into a saute pan and adding the pesto to heat it all up, so they can be served hot. The next day, I put some on a turkey sandwich, then for dinner, my husband used it on pasta, I'm definitely making this again. I would just add a little less olive oil next time.

The pesto is a great idea for dressing green beans, and very versatile. I used left-over pesto on pasta. The flavors are fresh, and the nuts add texture to both the beans and the pesto. I might try this with filberts instead of pecans some time. Everybody liked the dish.

I made this last Thanksgiving and everyone wanted the recipe - even the kids liked it. The pesto is very versatile.

Sounded different & tasy but was actually pretty darn boring for the work. Lacked zip.
