I've made this recipe with both canned albacore tuna and fresh tuna. Both versions were loved by all! It's a great recipe and easy to make!

Made this on an early fall evening when there was a cool chill in the air. Added broccoli (to up the veggie intake). Also, do not care for the texture of bread crumbs, but wanted to keep the lemon accent, so I doubled the parsley and tossed it in lemon juice before adding. Followed others suggestions to melt the cheese into the cream sauce. Turned out great!

Using a package of organic Asian Stir Fry Veggies, I sauteed the vegetables in butter. used yoghurt instead of cream, but the yoghurt separated from the butter in the pan. I added a few Kalamata olives, which added depth to the flavor. Whole wheat bread crumbs for the crumbs. The flavor was quite nice, but the appearance suffered by adding yoghurt. I was surprised that it tasted good to me, because the standard Tuna Casserole was all I'd ever eaten before. I also added some Seafood Seasoning for flavor. McCormick. Maybe stirring the yoghurt in just before serving would work.

I had some leftover roasted chicken which I substituted for the tuna. The flavor was good and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Not sure if I will make this again... I was left uninspired by this dish even though I love tomatoes and peas. I did not make the breadcrumb topping because I don't care for it and it wouldn't change my rating anyway. Instead of using parsley, I used some leftover basil. I also used grape tomatoes rather than cherry because I find they are sweeter and less acidic. The one good thing about this recipe is that it is super quick and easy to make and I had no trouble with the sauce thickening. The overall taste was just too generic to warrant more than two forks and definitely not worth using fresh tuna.

The only changes I made were to start with a roux and substitute asparagus for the peas. I used leftover grilled tuna, which may have added to the great flavor combination. Everything works well together; especially the lemon breadcrumbs (If you make this recipe, do not leave them out - without them this is just an ordinary pasta/cream sauce dish). I will definitely make this again and the only thing I would change is to add the tomatoes last, as they cooked down a little too much.

I've made this with both fresh and canned tuna, fresh for company, canned for family, and really loved it both ways. If you want the sauce a little thicker, stir the cheese into it as it simmers, rather than make a roux. I thought the point of the peas was that this was supposed to be a modern take on tuna noodle casserole. A humorous take. And aren't cherry tomatoes vegetables?

Two forks at best. Even though peas are a vegetable, they are considered a starch for dietary puposes. It's a pet peeve of mine that some use it as the only veg and then call the dish something-something with VEGETABLES. Sorry, doesn't cut it for your 5 servings of veg a day. I always go heavy on the vegetables in a recipe and omitted the peas and added shallot, carrot, red and green pepper. So maybe it's my own fault. But, I would not spend $10 on a tuna steak and waste it to make this again. I believe I could have winged it with a simular technique, a can of clams and done better. I did also add a little cumin and recognizing that combination (tuna & cumin) may be the best thing I got out of the experience.

This is nothing like tuna casserole, it is wonderful and I think it's pretty elegant. I would have preferred a thicker sauce to cling to the pasta, next time I will start with a flour/butter roux and then add the cream, to thicken it a bit. The best part is that it comes together in a snap.

This is wonderful. It was so good that even my toddler daugher ate it. I had to pass this recipe to family and friends and raved about it for a week. If you like fish this is a recipe to make. You will enjoy it.

Like the cook from L.A. said, I added cumin to the sauce, too. I used the canned tuna, and instead of peas, finely chopped carrot (microwave it for a minute first) because I did not have any other veggies. It tastes great and I am planning to take it to work for lunch. The grated lemon peel makes this recipe a little more than a regular pasta dish, I think.

First, I made some mods: Substitute fusilli or bowtie pasta for the fettucine, because the fettucine is just so damn heavy. Also, added a hint of cumin, because I think tuna and cumin have a secret love affair. If you're looking to save bucks, you really don't have to spring for the fresh stuff. Just buy White Albacore Tuna, and you'll be surprised at the mere subtle difference. I'm not saying that fresh tuna isn't fantastic, just that the canned tuna isn't really bad! Also, crushed red pepper to bring it up. My girlfriend loves this recipe!
