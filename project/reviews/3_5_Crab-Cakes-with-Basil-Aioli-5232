Excellent. I make this for company as my "foolproof" WOW dinner. Did make three changes though... way to much breadcumbs. I use 1/2 Italain Bread Crumbs and lemon zest instead of grated lemon peel. Also, I use a full pound of crabmeat (Costco $14.99)

Used a generous gift of rock crab meat from a local fisherman in this recipe -- best crab cakes I have ever eaten. Great recipe to work with -- it's a keeper.

I have had this magazine page since it came out never having made it till today. I loved the aioli, but the crab cakes definitely need more seasoning than what's called for. Next time I will add some garlic and maybe some minced scallions.

I really like this meal. It wasn't hard to make and it was a favorite for all ages. The basil aioli as a dipping sauce wasn't that good. Next time I think I'll just have it with some lemons.

They fell apart! This was messy to make and to fry. Loved the basil aioli.

This dish is fabulous! I have made this dish many times for family and friends. These crab cakes always go over very well. I make one change which is to use store-bought finely-ground bread crumbs instead of the fresh bread.

This was a terrific recipe, I made larger cakes (15 for this recipe) and served 3 per person, the basil aoli was out of this world, everyone raved about it. really liked the baking of these rather than frying.

This was an easy make ahead for a tea party (I made smaller crabcakes) and yummy! I dried out the bread a little in a low oven before putting it through my blender to make finer breadcrumbs, which resulted in a crispy coating. My husband requested no butter so I sauteed in olive oil - still very good. The basil aioli was also delicious. Will definitely make again.

nice alternative to old bay cakes, and a great way to use that late summer basil. i also make these smaller and serve as appetizers.

I can't believe the positive comments about this recipe. I didn't find this recipe to be a knock over. The only thing I changed, I didn't beat the egg whites and coat the crab cakes with the egg whites. Can't see how this can change the taste except for giving it a crispier crust. I'll be looking for another crab cake recipe while experimenting with my own recipes until I get it right.

I made these as a first course for my best friend's birthday dinner and they were by far the best crab cakes I have ever eaten - bar none! Everyone raved. I used a roasted red pepper aioli instead of the basil aioli. What an incredible experience.

These are the best...and we love crab cakes. They do take a little while to prepare, and the cakes are a little loose whaen coating, but chilling them for a few hours before cooking tightens them up just fine. We serve them as a main course with mesclun greens and crusty bread, but they'd do just as well as a first course.

I usually tinker with the crabcakes a bit, but I have tried many recipes and the basil is what makes these. I did want to add that since we usually have aioli left over, have found it a wonderful dip for artichokes leaves. BTW, just click on the "Basil Aioli", third item down, and you'll find the recipe: add 3 tbsp., as per instructions...

My husband and I are big crab cake fans and we were really impressed with this one.

We loved this recipe! I have made this before with fresh chopped red peppers also, when i didn't have the other, equally as tantalizing. The basil aioli is fabulous sauce for this..But then how can it not be with yummy fresh basil.

This dish was very easy and the results were wonderful. The crab cakes tasted like they were from a restaurant.

We were never big crab cake fans until we tried this one. The Basil Aioli makes the dish. Especially during the summer, with a cold glass of Pinot Grigio, it can't be beat!

substitute cilantro for the basil in both the crab cakes and the aioli. Excellent result.

Amazing. How nice to have crab cakes without Old Bay Seasoning. My dinner guests went crazy. I used a small cookie scoop and make 2" cakes.

i added a sprinkle of old bay seasoning, and rather than make basil aioli, i added some pesto sauce i already had to some mayo. it got rave reviews from all.

Very easy to make and delicious!

This was quite good, but we really like Crab Cakes, Nov. 1991 much better. Maybe adding the Old bay seasoning would make the difference here. So while it is good, we will make the other recipe when we want crab cakes.

Basil aioli was a delicious compliment to the crab cakes. Not to complicated of a recipe and the results are of restaurant quality.
