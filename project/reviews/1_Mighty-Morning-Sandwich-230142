LOLing. I have to agree that there is simply no reason this recipe should be in the database. What a waste of a spot in my search results!

Not of interest. Barely a recipe designed for the crowd that does not cook.

Seriously? Why not publish. . . place two slices of white bread side up on a plate. Spread 2 Tbsp. freshly ground peanut butter on one slice. Spread 1 Tbsp. grape jelly on the second slice. Press together firmly.

I don't look at epicurious recipes to loose weight. It's not bad though, if you fry the egg, and use real cheese.

Obviously Self's aren't going to be "up to par", they're meant to be for weight loss!

i agree with the statement that Self recipes are just not up to par with the rest. I have been looking through many recipes and Selfs has basically always been voted poorly or changed so much it becomes the viewers not Selfs.
