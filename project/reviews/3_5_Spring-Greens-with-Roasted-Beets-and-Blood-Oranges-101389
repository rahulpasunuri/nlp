Made it for the salad course and everyone raved about it. Used olive oil and balsamic, used candied walnuts ready-made. It was a winner.

Changes: used baby spinach and navel oranges from our tree. Yummy, simple, and a crowd pleaser!

This has an excellent flavor. I toasted pecans since I didn't have any walnuts on hand. I used kale and savoy for the greens - colorful and a great spring dish.

Wonderful flavors and colors. I added a couple of tablespoons of creme fraiche to the vinaigrette - very nice with beets.

there were some blood oranges at real foods in SF and I was having some people over for meatloaf; this was the salad..and it was a standout. It had a real fresh cool taste. I bought the sherry vinegar and walnut oil; chilled the oranges & beets before slicing and serving-- this is a very good, relatively easy salad to make.

Perhaps a more sophisticated host would have prepared something the guests might actually like. Sniff.

Sophisticated, so not well-liked by my midwestern mashed-potatoes-and-noodles guests for Thanksgiving. A lovely salad. Had to substitute navel oranges and used only olive oil. Was a welcomed lighter dish when served with all of that heavy, Thanksgiving food.

Delicious, attractive, great combination of flavours and textures. Sprinkled on a little bit of blue cheese but the salad is wonderful as printed.

Excellent ! I used the walnut oil where suggested in the recipe. It was delicious and pretty !

Very good - a refreshing salad. The combination of ingredients is surprisingly good (although I must admit I was a bit hesitant before making it). Didn't get walnut oil, so I used only olive oil. Also, I added the onions to the dressing about 30 min. before serving, so they would be "marinated" a little, and I added about 2 Tbs. red wine and 2 Tbs. orange juice to the dressing, because it seemed too "chunky" with the onions. Will be making this again!

A spring salad BEAUTY--the color alone is worth making this dish. The combination of flavors, however, was divine. Both my husband and I savored every bite and wiped up the dressing with bread. This would be a beautiful starter salad for a dinner party...it's elegant and delicious!
