These scones are fabulous. Sweet, flaky and tender. I had some sugar that was lavender infused, (1 cup granulated sugar and 1 tablespoon lavender buds finely ground in food processor). Using the lavender infused sugar along with the lavender buds in this recipe provided a very flavorful scone. I would make this again. They would be delicious for Easter brunch.

Good, but i should have followed my instincts and cut the butter into the flour using knives instead of rubbing it in with my hands. The result was more dense than flaky/crumbly/buttery scone texture. Also, maybe the fresh lavender leaves that i used from my garden were not fragrant enough, but they were drowned out by the lemon zest. I even added twice the amount asked for in the recipe.

these were excellent! baked them for a brunch gathering and they disappeared in no time. Served them with my homemade lemon curd and whipped organic cream on the side....yum! Only one change, added 1 more tsp of lavender buds.

Definitely wonderful. Doubled the lavender. In English recipes, it would be triple. To the reader who is going to raise their own, be sure to follow some directions for culinary lavender... the cleaning and using is different than for sachets. Also, be careful about the variety you decide to raise. Consult a garden center first. Making this for a Diamond Jubilee Tea this weekend to celebrate Elizabeth's 60th anniversary as queen.

Wonderful recipe. This is the first time I worked with culinary lavander and was blown away by the flavor. I've made 3 batches already. The only change I made was using a biscuit cutter rather than cutting them into triangles.

Just finished making these, because I love anything with lavender, and also love scones. The recipe is incredibly simple, and yields flaky*, floral perfumed scones. (Your house will smell amazing while they bake!) I subbed 1/3rd whole wheat pastry flour to sneak in some whole grain. I also had some lemon curd in the freezer that I made this winter, so we were able to enjoy these right away. While the scones are great on their own (especially with a cup of tea) don't skip the curd - the combination is wonderful. This recipe is definitely a keeper; can't wait to make them with homegrown lavender this summer. *If you haven't made scones before, the trick to keeping them tender is to handle the dough as little as possible. Don't over-mix. I simply patted my dough into a rectangle once I turned it out from the bowl without kneading.
