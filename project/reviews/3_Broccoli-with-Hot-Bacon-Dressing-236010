I overcooked the broccoli and the vinegar was too strong - this coming from someone who LOVES vinegar. It was ok, but I am not a bacon grease fan, so that might be why I did not like this recipe also. If I had a crisp piece of broccoli instead of the soft stuff I poured this dressing over, it may have been better. With that said, my one year old LOVED this... he definitely got his fiber intake!

The dressing didn't really add anything, and the bacon became soggy (although crisp when I cooked it).

I didn't care for this. It was greasy and heavy...sort of killed the point of eating a healthy food like broccoli. The flavors weren't bad, but not spectacular. Nothing I'll make again.

This was really nice as a side at Thanksgiving. I added about 1/2 cup of a mild crumbly cheese (English Butter Crumble), which really filled out the flavor.

I really, really enjoyed this. And even better was the fact that my boyfriend who, "Doesn't like broccoli," loved it. I subsituted white wine vinegar for w hite, because I prefer it.

This was really delicious. The only variation is that I used apple cider vinegar because we didn't have white vinegar. I like "real" bacon but this recipe would be great with turkey bacon, too. Definitely a keeper.

This was delicious; the combination of the sweetness from the raisins (I used golden), tartness from the vinegar and salty crunch from the bacon with the broccoli was perfect with our grilled chicken. The only thing I would do differently next time is add more garlic and maybe add a few red pepper flakes with the garlic...

Very quick, tasty veg. My family kept calling it "salad," I guess because of the vinegar. Anyway, we all loved it!
