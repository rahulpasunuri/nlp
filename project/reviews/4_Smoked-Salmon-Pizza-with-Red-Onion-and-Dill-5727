The filling ingredients here are an unbeatable combination no matter how they are used! I have been making this pizza for years to raves reviews and I have also made "Herbed Crepes with Smoked Salmon and Radishes" (an Epi recipe on this site) calling for much the same to raves as well. I was served the same ingredients in purchased pastry cups at a cocktail party and they were wonderful! I believe you would get rave reviews if you served it on a red brick.

Really quick and easy way to impress your guests. I made this and brought it to my book group and everyone requested the recipe. Used the thin Boboli but will probably try crostini next time.

So good for something so easy. I made it on corn tortillas, and added some pomegrante seeds as a garnish.

Very easy and flavorful....I actually skipped the pizza dough and put them on toasted baguette slices...received RAVE reviews.

This was so easy to prepare and absolutely delicious. Used it on crackers with the addition of 2 teaspoons of sour cream to make it a little more spreadable. Can't wait to make it again - definitely doubling the recipe next time!

This tasted fabulous! I made it as part of a New Year's Eve cocktail party - it took no time at all to prepare.

This is really good. Used premade Boboli shell and warmed several pieces in the oven. While we were eating that I was warming the next batch. A little of everything goes a long way with this dish - so dont overdo.

Love this recipe and so do my guests. However, instead of making the pizza I use the cream cheese mixture on crackers or crostini and top it with smoked salmon and capers. Delicious!!

i mixed the some capers and extra lemon rind into the cream cheese mixture and made my own pizza crust so i could add in some dill to the dough for color and flavor. be sure not to roll the cheese mixture on too thick so it compliments rather than becoming the main taste. i had alot of cream cheese left over. a yummy appetizer and great with champagne!

Wow--this was so easy and delicious! I spent maybe 5 minutes preparing it, but my guests raved. I'm not a salmon-lover at all, but I still really enjoyed it. I will definitely make this again.

I used the thin Boboli crust and my guests were delighted. This is by far the best pizza to eat cold the next morning.

Heavenly. Try it on toasted baugette slices for a more elegant presentation, and sprinkle some capers on top. Everyone who tastes it stands over the serving plate until it's gone.

I made a rye based pizza dough added a Tsp of Lemon juice. Added capers, smoked Sturgen and Smoked oysters. The Sturgen looked like a toping of Cheese, Salmon (pepperoni) and the oysters cut in half (sausage)

Easy and tasty. I used about a cup of sour cream, which I found easier to mix and spread than cream cheese. I also sliced the onion very thin and spread it on the crust with a little olive oil before baking, which worked nicely to tone down the onion flavor. I also skipped the lemon peel, used much more horseradish than called for and sprinkled about 2 tablespoons of capers on top.

sounds strange but tastes GREAT. My husband was crazy about it! I'd give more forks if i could!!!topped w/ capers.

I found this recipe to be very tasty. I used fat-free cream cheese and served it on round multi-grain crackers instead of pizza crust. Very tasty! I also used crumbled pieces of a whole smoked salmon that I received for Christmas instead of lox-style smoked salmon. That added extra texture.

The flavour combination for this is exactly right, but I would not waste the wonderful ingredients on a plain old pizza base again. Lovely crackers or perhaps on a different, more flavourful flatbread of some sort (focaccia, etc) would prove a much better base for these lovely flavours. Do try the other ingredients-just don't waste it on a pizza base. (I would also recommend seasoning the cream cheese mixture with some fresh black pepper and some sea salt. Definitely developes the flavours better.)

Very tasty. 3 1/2 forks. I've made this several times for an easy no fail starter recipe. Used reduced fat cream cheese.

Really great!! I used Pilsbury pizza dough in the can and precut rounds out before baking them. Turned out great. Simple, tasty, and can be made ahead. This will be a standard in our house.

My sister and I made this together once when I was visiting and we both just adored it. The recipe is perfect, we wouldn't change a thing. As a personal chef, I have clients who love this as little individual hors d'oeuvres. YUM!

I love how simple this recipe is and our friends always enjoy it--we had it recently at a wine tasting with a fine pouilly fume and our friend "Murray" gave it the thumbs up as a great match!

A favorite appetizer to bring to parties paired with the leek and goat cheese pizza. I cheat and use the Pillsbury pizza dough to be quick. Everyone will flip over it. It's a cool and refreshing alternative, the lemon zest gives a great kick.

Excellent! This is one of the dishes that I made for my husbands winery picnic in Santa Cruz. The presentation was beautiful. Everyone loved it.

I thought it was great but then again, I like cream cheese and lox and I got good lox.

My friend Wendy Kelley made it for our Christmas buffet. She used puff pastry sheets rolled slightly so they wouldn't puff too much. It was really quite good.
