Good soup, but a bit bland. I added some spicy seasoning to it, and was much happier..l couldn't taste that much celery, may have used too much potato. Husband loved it!

I had to add another three cups of broth to thin it out. Other than that, followed recipe and it was much appreciated by those at the table. Everything balances out really well. Hearty soup to get you through the cold seasons.

I have not been a celery fan, but now have been converted. Next time I will omit the celery root and lessen the heavy cream as others have suggested in their reviews. I am looking to see if this will freeze well, but worry about the cream separating. Possibly I will freeze half the batch as leftovers before adding cream. Let me know if others have done this in the past.

Needed a good use for lots of leftover celery and this was perfect. Didnt puree all the veggies as we do like chunky soup. And, instead of celery root, just added an extra potato. Used a little half and half instead of cream as soup was already pretty thick. This is a keeper for sure.

A great recipe for a time when I had too much celery and too many leeks from our CSA farmer. I substituted leeks for onion, and I substituted 1/2 tsp salt for celery salt. I used 1 potato, but no celery root. I added 1/4 tsp white pepper and 1 tsp or so dried tarragon. I also added potato to celery and leek/onion for faster cooking -- and I added a little white wine. I used 1/2 cup whole milk instead of 1 c. cream. It was delicious. Even my 6 year old loved it! Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Cream-of-Celery-Soup-996#ixzz1de7UhXbu

This is a great recipe, I added four stalks of tarragon with the chicken broth, which gave it a really complicated and rich flavor - highly recommend this tweak. I also doubled the butter (used L of L light butter), skipped the potato, used half a large onion and 6 green onions (wanted leeks, but the market was out), and doubled the garlic. Also, used fat free half and half and sprinkled celery salt on top instead of where the recipe said to. So delicious!!! A new favorite!!

Nice recipe, but it definitely doesn't need all that cream. Next time I'll use a half cup, maybe even a quarter cup. Otherwise nice.

I didn't think I cared for celery but this soup was amazing! I omitted the potato, as I try to keep my carbs low, and didn't have celery salted but otherwise followed the recipe. I think I'll try omitting the celery root next time, as they're quite expensive here, and I'm not sure this soup makes the best use. (Excited about trying David Lebovitz's Celery Root Remoulade next time I pick up a celery root). Will probably toss in carrots or whatever I have instead.

Surprisingly delicious. I was craving soup and had most of the ingredients for this but I had low expectations because I don't particularly like celery on it's own. But this was really yummy and comforting. I substituted a potato for the celery root and used regular salt instead of celery salt. I thought the result was fabulous but probably more cream of potato and celery. It would probably have a stronger celery flavor with those two. I'm definitely making this next time I have extra celery around. I'm not sure it's special enough for a dinner party but great for family dinners.

I have made this dozens of times, exactly as listed, and everyone LOVES it but read the reviews and I think I will try the sweet potato variation this time - Sounds GREAT!! I've also used leeks instead of onions - cause I had them and did not notice significant change of taste. Really good either way - SO EASY!

I'm planning to make this soup for Thanksgiving, so I wanted to lighten it since the rest of the meal would be, well, Thanksgiving. It doesn't need the olive oil or the cream . I made a fat-free version and it was absolutely delicious. Here are my adjustments: (1) I substituted a large leek for the onions. (2) I sauteed the celery and leek in a pan coated with cooking spray instead of using the olive oil. (3) I didn't add the cream. It would no doubt be heavenly with the cream and I may have some handy for guests to add, but really, the flavor and texture are lovely without it.

Thank you to the person who suggested bread crumbs since they didn't have a potato! Well, let me tell y'all I did everything different from the recipe, added cabbage, mushroom broth, a carrot, butter, and then some....HOLY MOLY.....the soup was delish and the celery came through. You can't go wrong with this recipe, you just can't....yum.

I didn't have a potato so I substituted breadcrumbs. I also added chopped parsley to the top when serving. Delicious soup, light and hearty at the same time.

The three adults in the house loved the soup. I couldn't find any celery root, so I substituted a parsnip. I also added 2 leeks, just because I had them. I left out the celery salt as well. I actually made the soup without the cream and froze it on a Sunday. Then one night during the week I thawed it and all I had to do was add the cream and heat up. A great success. Leftovers were great too.

What a wonderful soup! Very simple to prepare and tastes very gourmet. I like soups with a little back heat so I added a roasted jalepeno peeper that I peeled and seeded. My kids loved it, as did the whole dinner party.

This soup was delicious. I didn't tell my kids what was in it and they ate the entire bowl. I didn't have a russet potato so I substituted a sweet potato. This gave the soup a nice faint orange color and a delicious sweetness. I just finished the rest for lunch and it was just as good as last night. Highly recommend this recipe.

Delicious! I did not have celery root in my market so I used turnips, used half and half (thought I had whipping cream at home and didn't feel like driving to market), and did not use celery salt. The finished product was still so yummy. The broth was so good I adapted it to be part of my staples of soup stocks. I simmer celery, onion, garlic, and turnips for about 30-40 min and then toss out the veggies and keep the stock for whenever I feel inspired!

I haven't tried this yet but wanted to point out to whoever is in charge of these things that this is NOT vegetarian as is stated to the right of the recipe. It includes chicken broth. Simple enuff to substitute veggie broth, but inaccurate nonetheless ... flesh-less and vegetarian are not synonymous!

I made "as is" and found this soup very bland. When I added the cream it was even worse - like an odd tasting bowl of cream, nothing celery about it. Not worth a second try in my opinion

This soup is wonderfully bright and flavorful. I made it "as is" the first time and it was fantastic. The second time I added one bunch of sliced green onion with the broth, garlic, etc. Then, just before blending I added a 9 oz. bag of spinach and stirred just until wilted yet bright green. (Both additions were because I had them on hand and wanted to use them~not because I think the recipe needed help.) It just made the soup that much brighter and healthier. My suggestion for "wowing" guests at a winter dinner party... Make the carrot fennel soup, also found on epicurious and ladle both soups into bowl simultaneously and drizzle with the fennel oil. The orange and green side by side is beautiful and the flavor combination is fantastic!

I made this exactly according to the recipe and it was very tasty, with a mild, creamy celery flavour. For lunch today I heated a bowl of the leftovers and stirred in some cambazola cheese, which was really good.

Rating: 3
wow - really good. My only alterations: I used light cream. I think heavy cream is rarely called for. And I added a hefty grinding of black pepper. Don't skip the celery root -- it adds a delicious creaminess & bright celery flavor. Also: I cut the recipe in half 'cause that's all the celery root I had in the fridge. But it left me at at least a day's worth of leftover soup. Will definitely make this again as long as cold weather holds on.

Good soup. I added grated gruyere cheese on top of individual portions to add flavor.

Nice recipe, but lots of chopping for these arthritic hands. Ground up celery seed in a mortar and pestle instead of celery salt. I froze a few containers without the cream so I can have a hint of spring all summer.

Not a surprising or inventive recipe but one that produces reliable results. I like the use of the celery salt. I did not have celery root and used a lot of the celery leaves, which really bolstered the celery aroma. I found I needed more stock than what the recipe called for. Haven't had a bowl yet, but from the tasting, I am looking forward to it (sans blue cheese and tabasco, as others have suggested).

This was the most delicious soup I have ever tasted! Did not have celery salt so subed in a bit of regular salt, however, it really did not need much as it already had a full body of flavor. Used about an extra half can of broth to thin and about half the amount of cream. It tasted great without the cream, but the cream just gave it that extra finishing touch! This will knock the socks off any of your guests!! Will def. make again!! Yummm

I made this soup as a way to use with the piles of celery sticks left over from a crudite platter. I substituted a small parsnip for a large celery root. It was great!!

This is a wonderful soup...full of flavor! I added the third can of chicken broth as it did get too thick, and that made a big difference. I used light cream to save on some fat and calories, and it was just wonderful. Suggest buying at least a pound and a half of the celery root as you will peel and cut away at least half the root when cleaning. Very rich soup. Will def. make again!

I thought it was a very good, tasty solid and traditional cream of celery soup. The "Rich Chef" should spend less money on celery and more on glasses - he must have mixed his soup and hot wings recipes together, 'cause there is no blue cheese and tabasco in this soup...

I'm a vegetarian, so used vegetable broth. I also doubled the garlic, used half the butter, and nonfat evaporated milk instead of the cream. I would reccommed using celery seeds to flavor, along with a dose of pepper. This recipe proves that some things are classic. There's no way to tell this recipe is 10 years old.

Didn't have celery root or celery salt so improvised and substituted dill seed, added it with the garlic saute. Omitted the potatos, was perfectly thick without it, using the stick blender. Upon serving added a dollop of sour cream with a sprinkling of dill. The combo of celery and dill was great. I would make it again.

This is the second time for me to make this soup. The flavor is wonderful! The first time I blended the entire soup and it was velvety smooth. This time I reserved some of the cooked celery/celery root and used a stick blender to make a coarse texture. This combined with the velvety smooth texture to make it very interesting. I garnish the soup with a small amount of celery salt and chopped celery leaves. Everyone loved this soup.

Great! Variations/substitutions: Omit potato since thick enough without, especially when homemade chicken stock is on hand. Used leeks instead of onions (yum!) & added 1/4 t. celery seeds, 1/2 t. dried thyme & 2 t. salt during initial stewing process. After blending, added only 1/2 cup of heavy cream. It was enough. (Use only 1 1/14-1/2 t. salt if cream eliminated.)

Quick and easy to make. Most of the ingredients were things that I had on hand. Tasted even better the next day! Next time I will try adding tabasco or bleu cheese, as suggested.

Absolutely loved this recipie - couldn't eat it fast enough! Used celery from the garden, so I had LOTS of celery greens, and not much celery root ( hmm... this is my first time growing celery, does the root REALLY get as big as what you find in the store??? ) So I put in more potato to make up for the missing root, and just before pureeing, I added ALL of the raw leaves to the hot broth ( approx 3 cups chopped leaves ) - so the leaves just-wilted but didn't cook through before pureeing. Didn't even add the cream, as I fell in love with it straight of the blender! The celery and leaves were quite mature - much more tangy than what I usually find in the store. Used sea-salt instead of the celery seed or celery salt ( plenty enough celery taste with all those leaves ! ), and WOW! I am on my out to the garden to dig up another head of celery and make this soup again!!!

I rated this a two-fork; made it again and it was quite good. Had to season it up a bit. I like to use Sylvia's seasoning. Get some in the ethnic area of Safeway on the west coast. I made 1/2 a recipe but used a whole potato and a small celery root, then thined with some more stock.

This is a very good excellent cream of celery soup recipe. The only modifications I would recommend are: 1) Replace the celery salt with celery seed for more flavor. Also add white pepper to taste. 2) For a slightly lighter version, place 1 or 2 TB cream in a measuring cup and fill to 1 cup with lowfat milk. 3) When serving, chop up celery leaves (if you have them) and garnish the soup.

I will make this soup whenever I have leftover celery, it is delicious, and the combination of celery and celery root is very nice. It was a bit bland, so I added a dash of white pepper and a few dashes of Tabasco (it needed a touch of acid, lemon juice might work as well) prior to adding the cream.

Very easy and very tasty, even without the celery roots. Personnally I like to add the cream directly in the serving bowl to make a circle or spiral motif. Another serving suggestion: add a tablespoon of crumbled blue cheese in the middle of the bowl.

This is a delicious, delicate first course. The subtle celery flavor plays on the palate. The better the celery you use, the better the flavor, too. A very easy gourmet touch to a special meal.

I made this and left out the celery root, couldn't find it. i dont think it made much of a differnce and i also didn't puree the mixture. it gives it a nice chunky look instead. i can only imagine the other way around would be like eating... well i wont say ...

This was delicious on a chilly November night. It will also be my answer for what to do with the leftovers when you buy a head of celery and then use just a stalk or two. The celery root is essential, as is prime quality chicken stock.
