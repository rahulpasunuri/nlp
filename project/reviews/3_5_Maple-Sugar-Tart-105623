I loved this dish. I made it for a party where some of the people couldn't eat refined sugar. The only change I made was I left out the nuts and added a pinch of salt. The creme fraiche is really important to help cut the sweetness.

I have to admit that I didn't follow the recipe exactly. $9.05 bought 1 1/4 cups of maple sugar. I substituted 1/4 c. dark brown sugar and 1/2 c. grade B maple syrup for the rest. Though the raw syrup and maple sugar had a very intense maple flavor, it diminished during baking. Only 1 of 8 dinner guests were able to guess that this was a maple tart - The others identified the flavors as caramel, corn syrup or or burnt sugar. Everyone liked it, but I don't think the high cost of the specialty ingredient was justified. The crust however, made with just slighty thawed frozen butter and with 1/4 tsp. baking powder and 1 tsp. white vinegar added, was superlative.

I got maple sugar at www.saintpierrefarms.com, way cheaper than the other listing. You need to ask them for it, though. They also stock grade B and C maple syrup. I paid only 25 dollars for a GALLON of grade B with them, at the other place mentioned, they want 18.25 for a Quart!

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but sugar pie is a Vermont favorite too. For cooks who can't find maple sugar near them, it can be purchased on-line at Maple Grove Farms (http://www.store.yahoo.com/maplegrove/toppings1.html) for a reasonable price. It makes a great sweetener!

I live in Quebec, where Sugar Pie is a favorite of many people and I love this one! We usually find recipes for it with brown sugar instead of maple suger and believe me it makes a huge difference! I will so make it again!

I made this for my family for Thanksgiving in place of the usual pecan pie and it was wonderful! I used the maple sugar, but I am sure that a mix of raw sugar and maple syrup would work.

I made this tart for my family and my boyfriend's family and they both loved it. I wasn't about to search all over for Maple sugar so I bought granulated sugar in the raw and added maple flavoring to taste and it turned out great. I'll definitely make it again for the holidays.

I went to Whole Foods to buy the maple sugar, and it was $10 for a pound, which should be just about 2 cups. I just wasn't willing to spend that much on this tart, although it sounds luscious!!
