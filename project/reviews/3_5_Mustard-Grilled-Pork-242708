Quick and tasty. This is a nice quick wet rub for pork. I would recommend keeping half the cabbage cooked as in the recipe and charring the hell out of the other half (as I did) to get more grilled taste. The centers of the burnt cabbage quarters will still be crunchy and cool.

This was a huge hit. I used Kozlick's smokey mustard and it was AMAZING. Great BBQ recipe that I will use again and again.

Not great, not much flavor.

I did not make the slaw, will do so next time. This is simple, straightforward and went over well with 2/3 of my kids. Definitely reserve 1/3 or so of the sauce for the table. Made it with the Grill Potato and Onion Packages from this site. Do the potatoes on the grill first and while they are resting in their packs, do the pork.

This was okay at best- even for just a quickie weeknight meal. Even though I let it marinate for 10-20 minutes before grilling it in the sauce, I found it had little flavor. Dijon is not extremely cheap and I am angry that I used 1/2c. to yield only a weak mustard flavor. Doubled the taragon and only tasted a hint. I was disappointed in this- maybe it would have been better with the slaw?

used marinade on pork tenderloin medallions instead and pan fried in butter (grill was out of propane!). Tasted delicious!

Was just going to make this with the sauce and at the last hour decided to do the cabbage slaw. I only used 1/4 of one cabbage and had plenty, so I see no reason to toss two cabbages at this problem. That said, the slaw really was good. and using the grilling sauce as a dipping sauce was brill. I made it with an ethopian green been and potato recipe that I found elsewhere and it worked out fine.

this was an easy delicious summer recipe...save some of the glaze for dipping...it was a big hit...

I made this using the glaze on a whole tenderloin thrown on the BBQ. It was a hit. We're making again for the 4th.
