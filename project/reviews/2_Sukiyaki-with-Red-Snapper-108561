Not as sweet and saltier than "true" sukiyaki. Add sugar. Saute green onion pieces in a little oil in the pan first. Add napa cabbage and yam noodles too. Add some sugar to taste. Serve with raw/parboiled in shell egg and rice after.

well after reading this recepE,I find that it lacks personality...it is rather like a fast food restaurant item on a menu made with available ready ingredients..ok for someone who knows nothing about cooking..but lacks creativity,and the tastes of the ready-made sauces will dominate..therefore losing the suble flavour of the main ingredient....THE FISH
