Great chowder although cut cream by half to reduce fat - still plenty rich. Also liked additional red pepper flakes on top as it was somewhat bland prior to the addition.

I substituted cauliflower for potatoes - cooked separately then added with the shrimp - and it was a great low-carb soup! It is a great recipe!

Wow - this is a keeper! I cheated and used chicken broth instead, but it still turned out incredibly well. Make this!

Fabulous. If you can't find the small shrimp, remove tails and cut the larger prawns into thirds.

I was so excited to see this recipe, and I thought the result was very nice, if not phenomenal. I blame myself for deciding to try the recipe even though I only had about a pound of shrimp. Otherwise, I pretty much stuck to the recipe. The shrimp got lost, and I really can't taste the fennel much, either. It's a good thing I like the other components!

Great recipe....I decided to follow someone's review and sped up the steps. I also chopped the onion, fennel, cut my potatoes into small cubes and my shrimp into thirds. I also pureed the soup after potatoes were done...then again after cooking tomatoes and finally a third time after shrimp was done cooking. I made sure I left about 1/3 of the shrimp in big chunks. I only added about 1/2 cup whipping cream. The soup came out great.My two toddlers actually ate it too! Definitely a soup worth making...a nice one for company too. :)

Easy and delicious. Since it was reviewed by a number of people and 100% said they would make it again, I stuck to the recipe. I will definitely make again, just may use a tad less cream,maybe 1 cup instead of 1 1/2.

We have made this twice now, and it is absolutely fantastic! Pretty much stuck faithful to the recipe. A delicious, delicious soup. Our 8 year old could not get enough of it!

I have made this twice now. First time it took me almost 4 hours, second time, only an hour! Don't do the instructions in order. Do this: peel shrimp and chop tops off fennel. Start the stock with the shells and fennel. At the same time, put on the bacon. The bacon browning and the stock should take about the same amount of time: 20 mins or so. While they are cooking, chop the fennel and onion. After you put that on, clean and slice the shrimp. Then do the potatos. Then when it's time, drain the stock directly into the big pot. Follow the rest of the directions as directed, but this simultaneous-tasking cut my time a ton! and has made this something i can cook anytime now. My last variation i added a pound of bay scallops and didn't add the cream... it turned out delicious too, and lighter! This is going into my rotation of soups...

Fantastic hearty recipe. I prepared exactly as the recipe said with the exception of prosciutto for the bacon. Chowder had wonderful flavor!

We used pre-made chicken stock instead of the homemade stock. We also added 1/2 lb. of scallops. It was fantastic!! Would not change a thing!

Made this last night and it was a big success. Left out the bacon, because I didn't have any any and sped things up by preecooking the potatoes in the microwave. My fiance loved it and siad it was quite possibly my best soup to daye. Very easy and not too anise flavored.

Enjoyed making and eating this one! Used pancetta instead of bacon and the whole can of chopped tomatoes rather than just 1 C. Also used table cream instead of heavy whipping cream. All in all - a great seafood / shrimp soup. Ate this with a nice salad and fresh bread. Husband gave it his highest marks and displaced my previously favorite shrimp soup!

My entire family loved this recipe. The fennel is a great compliment to the subtle sweetness of the shrimp. We didn't find it too rich as written and will most certainly be making this again and again. It would be impressive yet easy "company" food and tasted even better the next day.

I made this with Langastino instead of shrimp, and 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream and it was absolutely fabulous. Did take a while to make, but well worth it. And the leftovers the next day were even better. Next time I'll double the recipe and save it a few days before serving. yummy!

Excellent, even after exchanging the cream for a thick bechamel sauce made with milk, added at the end. I used 1 kg (2.2 lb) unpeeled shrimp - it was a good amount. It took some time, but it was worth it! I also added less water and put a lid on it instead of letting it reduce.

We really enjoyed this chowder! It is very rich b/c and I think next time I will substitute some of the heavy cream with half and half. It received rave reviews and is definitely a keeper!

I found White's assertion that there is no tradition of shrimp chowder a bit off base, since as a native Mainer I've been eating and making shrimp chowder with Maine shrimp for years, as had my mother and grandmother before me. Nonetheless, I tried the additions of the fennel, and found it delicious. It's shrimp season now in Maine, and hubby will be bringing home 15 pounds tonight, some for dinner and the rest for the freezer. Maine shrimp are small but so sweet and tender!

Yummy! I used 2% milk which made it a little lighter nutritionally, and in taste. It needs way more liquid than it called for, and more garlic is a must. Ham instead of bacon is nice, too.

This dish was absolutly lovely!! Don't be put off by all the procedures, it was quite easy. I used light sour cream instead of the cream to lighten it up a bit, frozen shrimp, prepared broth, and some diced green peppers(to offset the pink). All worked fine. My husband loved it and he is very picky!!! I will definatly make this again.

This recipe turns out good. I held way back on the cream and what I did add, I cut with half and half. It still was rich and creamy. Also I used regular bacon. A good hearty soup.

This recipe was excellent! For the one time I needed it, couldn't find a fennel bulb to save my life! Used celery root instead. This chowder was slightly funny looking, pink in color, but the taste! Used Yukon Gold potatoes, other than that, followed the rest of the recipe. If you like clam chowder, you will love this one even more!
