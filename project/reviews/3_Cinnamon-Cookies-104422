I have been making this recipe for 10 years, it wouldn't be the holiday season without these cookies. I use toasted pecans instead of the walnuts, other than that I follow the recipe. These are my favorite cut-out cookies.

I went back and dug up my vintage copy of Gourmet Xmas 2010 to try my hand at baking this recipe. What a disappointment! Despite being the cover recipe, the recipe was a disaster. There was no mention of eggs in the ingredients section or throughout the method. I should have listened to my instincts and abandoned ship right there and then but I wanted to give Gourmet the benefit of the doubt. Apparently, you did say that your team had spent all year testing and retesting the cookies. I thought that perhaps by some miracle the butter and the oil in the nuts would be sufficient as a binding agent but no. The dough was a crumbly mess to which no amount of refrigeration would improve. I went ahead and baked a tray as as pressed cookie balls in a sad attempt to salvage what I could but the look and taste meant they were only good enough for the bin. Very disappointed.

Mediocre at best. Will store and see if cookies improve. Tried powdered sugar/cinnamon dusting, but still not dancing around the kitchen.

The cookies tasted wonderful! I was short on time, so I made drop cookies instead of rolling out the dough. Also, for the icing, I used lemon juice instead of water.

No way can this dough be rolled out. We ended up making drop cookies. My family liked them, however I thought they were just mediocre. This is not going into my permanent recipe file.

These cookies are great! I made them as soon as I got the recipe in 2000, and realized that something was off immediately upon attemping to roll them out. So I just threw the dough back in the mixer and added another 1/2 cup of butter, and NO EGGS. They turned out fantastic, but were still difficult to roll cleanly. All my friends loved them and are now making the eggless variety. I finally decided to look at the web and see if there was a comment about them. Knowing that eggs are a required ingredient I will try the updated recipe, but will see if they are better than the crispy, buttery, cinnamony variety that we have been making now for years.

I made the corrected recipe using hazlenuts instead of walnuts, and found the dough to be impossible to roll out--even after chilling it overnight as some other reviewers suggested. I ended up forming the dough into logs and cutting thin slices and then baking. They turned out fine and were sweet enough that they didn't need icing.

If you are looking for a twist on traditional holiday sugar cookie cutouts, this is your recipe (added bonus: they will send a heavenly scent through your home). This is a terrific, tasty cookie, which is not overwhelming in its sweetness (unless you really pack on the icing). A perfect "grown-up" cookie, they were also a huge hit with my two-year old. I am not a huge fan of walnuts and subsituted ground pecans and it worked beautifully. I would agree with others and say this dough needs to be well chilled -- overnight is just right. To the cook who's looking for a "softer" cookie: I have found that time in a Rubbermaid container softens them (and mine are iced). I can't speak to the butter v. shortening debate, though I can't understand why you'd want to loose the flavour that butter provides. I'd be tempted to try adding another egg, or maybe substituting brown sugar and/or maybe adding some baking soda. Then again, I think that the nuts lend themselves to producing a harder cookie overall. But frankly, mine didn't turn out rock hard as other cooks have described theirs to be (though my cookies weren't really soft either). At the end of the day, I liked their texture. Let us know how it goes.

Fabulous. I made one recipe last year--I made huge snowflakes out of it and only got ~12 cookies. I intend to make 10 or more times that this year. A real "gift" cookie

I haven't made these yet but they intrigue me. Could someone tell me though, (before I create a disaster) if shortening instead of butter would lend itself to them being softer? Ignore the email address above....my address is duardonme@yahoo.com

I made these last Christmas time and was iniItially disappointed with them. I did not frost them but used Swedish Sanding sugar on them. I put them away in a tin since I was doing a bunch of advance baking. I hauled them out a couple of weeks later and they were wonderful. The flavor had developed and they had become more tender. Make these ahead anD let them age!

This was a very tasty treat, however the cookies did turn rather hard quite quickly. They were still very good, just difficult ot bite into. My boyfriend suggested a little applesauce in the mix might help, and he might be right.

I used this recipie to help my 5 yr old granddaughter make cookies to leave for Santa. It was simple enough and fun. Unfortunately, I forgot to purchase the nuts and so did without them. Perhaps having them would have made the difference. Although they were fine to leave for Santa, and my granddaughter liked them, I found them to be somewhat bland.

These cookies were just okay - nothing special. I made them with the corrected recipe and I did not have any trouble with the dough. I used snowflake cookie cutters - they looked nice that's about it.

WOW! Never again will I make a bland cookie-cutter sugar cookie - these cinnamon cookies rolled out well, cut beautifully, and tasted fantastic! I suspect others didn't like the cookie because they altered the recipe -duh! I'll admit to using a plain royal icing to decorate the cookies rather than the walnut icing, but I will try it the other way next time I make them, which will be very soon!

If you like dry, hard and crunchy cookies (that's even with the eggs), these are for you! I added more cinnamon and nuts than ther recipe called for and they still lacked any "hmmmmmm" power. Didn't even bother to finish them off with icing since the cookie part was so disappointing.

This was a simple and fun cookie to make. I made two batches at once. I also added 1tsp baking powder and some vanilla to the mix. They made great X'mas cookies!

Unfortunately, I made the recipe from the magazine so I can't fairly judge the cookies if properly made. Making them without the eggs was not only hard work but of course they had the texture of cardboard. I guess in the future, I should get all of my recipes from the website.

This recipe is just delicious. What really surprised me was that the dough was so tender, I was able to re-roll it (which I know you're not supposed to do) a couple times with excellent results. I just had to get every last drop. Beautiful cookie with an amazing flavor. I gave them away for Christmas gifts as was labeled a Gourmet cookie maker by my friends. Definitely a keeper. Thank you for a decorated cookie recipe that is truly superb.

I was fortunate enough to try the corrected recipe first and it was wonderful!!! I had no trouble handling the dough and the cookies turned out perfect. I used pecans instead of walnuts and used melted chocolate for decoration. They were a big hit. Definately a keeper - much more interesting than plain old sugar cookies...

made this recipe with little success due to fact there was an error in recipe. disappointed the cover or any recipe from gourmet would let such an error slip.

Unfortunately, I didn't have the foresight to check the site before I made these, so I too got the botched recipe. The dough was a disaster to handle, and I ended up treating it like a pie dough, adding cold water just until it finally bound together. The flavor was very good, and I'm sure with the addition of the eggs, it would have been great.

I have a couple of nitpicks with this recipe. The major thing to know beforehand is that the dough is very difficult to handle, even when I chilled it for more than twice the recommended time. After one hour this dough was nowhere near ready for rolling, it takes more like 3 hours to chill it firm enough. Even then, it's a very fragile dough that breaks and sticks easily, so it will require more flouring, but too much flouring quickly makes these cookies very tough. Also, the recipe doesn't make 6 dozen, it's more like 5 dozen (I used a 3 inch cutter). And you will need much more than "a drop" of lemon juice for the icing, I used more like a teaspoon or more, but it adds nice flavor. After all that, the cookies were really delicious and won rave reviews from my "test audience" (husband's co-workers). I'll make these again, but probably only for a special occasion.

I too got stuck with dry dough because of the misprint. I added water to compensate and the cookies turned okay. But I'm not sure they were worth the effort.

Good fortune caused me to look up the recipe on-line, although I was going to make the cookies this holiday from the magazine recipe. (I was interested in reading reviews of anyone who had made it.). I was very disappointed to read the reviews, but having seen the correction in the recipe, I decided to try it anyway. I can't rave enough about this cookie! It is FANTASTIC! I feel very sorry for those who came before me, not having the benefit of the correction as I did because it is a wonderful cookie! The nutty-cinnamon flavor is great with coffee, especially! I found the dough a little soft/wet, so I added just a touch more flour, and the consistency was perfect. The dough rolls well (I re-rolled the scraps 2-3 times with no trouble). The cookies have just the right crisp, and they keep well for a long time (it's been a week so far, but alas, I ran out!). This is a keeper- I will make this every year!! I hope your readers will give it another try. In the future, I will always look up recipes on-line-- just in case!

Not seeing the egg correction online, I also had distressingly dry dough. Corrected by adding more butter. Taste of finished cookie only OK for such a time intensive recipe. Will skip next time around...

Wooed by the cover photo and the editorial on this cookie, I attempted it. I am an accomplished cook. The dough was a disaster. I discussed the cookie with a friend, and we decided perhaps I worked with the butter when it was too cold. Unbelievably, I tried it again. Wasting the effort, ingredients and a messy kitchen a second time around. I'm waiting to see the errata notice in the January issue!!!

This is a lovely cookie recipe, and it has replaced the nutmeg sugar cookies I previously used for Christmas. But it does require chilling overnight as it is a sticky dough, and cinnamon that hasn't been around your spice cupboard for years. I also used my own icing. My son adores these, and I had many requests for the recipe when I served them at our Christmas open house. Do try them.

I baked these cookies today after chilling the dough overnight. They turned out OK. They taste really good but aren't very attractive. I iced them with my own powdered sugar frosting recipe instead of the one printed with the cookie recipe. I left my icing white and used red and green sugar sprinkled on while the icing was still wet. They'll do but I don't plan on making them again.

I made cinnamon men, by using gingerbread men cookie cutters to cut out the dough. I left the cookies without frosting (too lazy) and they were still a huge hit with friends.

I made the cookies from the recipe in the Dec. issue and found the dough unworkable, so I added 1 egg and one half stick of butter, making it better. I see that the recipe has been corrected now. Next time I shall add 2 eggs, as suggested. The color was not appetizing but the icing made it better.

I used the recipe in the magazine, but I figured there must have been some mistake when my dough turned out so dry. I added some more butter and an egg and got it to a point that I could work with it. Still, I found the flavor bland and the color not very appetizing. The icing wasn't very tasty either. I'd make these again, but only with some alterations to the recipe and a different icing. p.s. glad to see the correction about the eggs!

We all liked these cookies. I made them for friends too, and they really liked them as well. Instead of using walnuts, I used pecans, and I made them regular instead of giant sized and iced them and decorated them like our usual Christmas cookies, delicious! Easy to cut out and roll too!

here's the thing, i really loved the taste of these cookies but found the drab camel color to be a bit off putting. yet, the frosting tastes so mediocre (almost metallic) that it took away from the outstanding flavor of this cookie. if i can find a better alternative to the icing i'll try again. oh, i rolled the scraps into cords, wrapped them into spirals and baked them. they were excellent!

If you like cinnamon these cookies are AWESOME! The ones I made disappeared as soon as they were iced.

This is a wonderfully delicious alternative to sugar cookies! They are fragrant and crunchy and a beatiful warm brown color! I had to refrain from eating the entire first batch! They are good decorated or plain. I always make decorated sugar cookies for holidays and special occasions, but I was bored with the plain, mundane sugar cookies. These are a perfect solution! Easy to make, and yet deliciously different! Thank you Mrs. Mack!
