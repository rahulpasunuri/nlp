This recipe is so basic, but the star of this dish is the sausage which comes out incredibly tender when done. I used hot Italian sausage and omitted the crushed red pepper flakes, and used one red and one yellow pepper instead of the green. Made terrific Italian sausage sandwiches!

This recipe turned out wonderfully. It is definitely going to be added as one of our favorites! However, I made a few changes to make it my own!: Instead of 2 green peppers, I substituted one poblano pepper and 2 yellow peppers. I realized too late that I ran out of oregeno, so I used 2 teaspoons of Emeril's Chicken rub (it had oregeno in it!) I also did 1 lb mild sausage and 1 lb hot italian sausage. I mildly browned the onions in a pan before adding it to the mixture. I increased the olive oil to 6 tablespoons. The juices at the bottom of the dish was my favorite part! I served it with large, doughy white rolls to absorb all the juices. I also turned up the temp to 375F and it was perfectly cooked after 45 minutes.Enjoy!!!!!

yummy way to use fresh peppers from the garden. Next time I will brown the sausages and remove from oven-proof pan, add 1/4 the oil and quickly saute the veggies just a bit then add back the sausage and drizzle top with 1/4 oil, oregano and a little chicken stock.

SAUSAGE AND PEPPER BAKE It was my lucky day. My small, owner-owned meat market had made hot Italian sausage. Peppers, onions, olive oil, sausage....perfect. The plump, succulent sausage cooked perfectly in a little over 45 minutes. What is a host to do while waiting for the peppers and onions to cook? Watch the first two-hour episode of Ken Burns The War ON PBS is an option. Watching your guests getting drunk and calling a taxi for them is less appealing. Onions and peppers give off water when they cook, and cook and cook and cook and cook, and cook and oven roasted never, ever get the well done, slightly charred goodness of sauté...at least not according to this recipe. Was anyone in the test kitchen? Apparently not. Don't try this disaster. If you have to go to the trouble of browning the sausages just add some peppers and onions and spices and have a great dinner. DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME.

This is a very good sausage and pepper recipe. Simple and not too time consuming, especially if you are cooking for a crowd. Doubles easily. A winner.

I loved this dish. This is a good recipe for 1st sausage and pepper cook. I added marinara sauce to at baking time and used Wegmans basting oil instead of regular oil

I was disappointed with this recipe. Liked the time-saver of not having to saute the peppers and onions, but by baking instead of sauteing you lose out on the ever-so-important caramelization process. Also, the vegetables release quite a bit of water which sit at the bottom of the baking dish. Yuck. Had the vegetables been sauted, much of the water would evaporate and the peppers and onions would take on more desirable color and flavor. I'll stick with the traditional saute method next time.

Man, was this ever good. To keep it juicy, I covred it with foil the 1st 30 min of cooking, then uncovered the rest of the time. It did take more than 45 min but worth it. I dont eat green peppers so used only red, orange, and yellow. Nice and sweet. Extra garlic goes without saying. Hubby loved it.

Great, easy recipe - put a 24 oz can peeled tomatoes in with peppers, used 2 1/2 lbs hot sausage, skipped the crushed red pepper, 10 mins before serving threw some bread crumbs on top to absorb some of the juice/oil. Very good all by itself or with warm rolls.

Delicious, authentic and surprisingly easy. Next time I will add at least two more peppers, as they shrink considerably during cooking. I also added about a tsp. of fennel seed, which enhanced the flavor.

Excellent recipe...Easy and delicious!!

This has become a staple recipe in our house - to add more flavor, I add one 8 ounce can of tomato sauce before putting it in the oven, and a bit more red pepper. Delicious!

Delicious and easy. The only comment I had was maybe to increase the amount of oil (or other liquid)- the finished product was a little dry.

Much to my surprise this dish turned out to be wonderful. I did use italian turkey sausage to cut down on the fat. This dish was also very easy to make,I will make this again and again.

These were wonderful! I did, however, add 2 tablespoons of white wine vinegar (could use red, also) & a tablespoon of fennel seed. And of course more garlic. But I prefer it sliced rather than minced. I also cut the sausage on the diagonal for easier eating, whether in a bun (as some chose) or just on the plate. And served the peppers & sausage seperately. Good idea for teen agers. They don't always like the peppers & onion thing. Easy & fun company dish!

The taste is great, and it's very quick and easy to prepare. We used really good sausage from a local butcher and served it with good, crusty bread. MMmmmm. We will make this often!

This recipe is a mainstay for us since 1994! I add extra garlic (of course, don't we all??) and serve it over bowtie pasta. Yummy!

This recipe was great! Very easy to make. We used hoagie rolls and I added a little extra garlic. We will definitely have this again!

Absolutely foolproof! It took 10 minutes of prep time and then I could relax while it baked. Perfect weeknight meal!

This is really great for loading onto a crusty roll for sandwiches. It's a little greasy but the grease soaks into the bread and I think it's just delicious. Good food, not too hard to make, something different. I cut the sausage up after I browned it, it makes the sandwich more manageable.

My husband I enjoyed this recipe very much. The only thing I would change is to double the amount of peppers and onions and I cut the sausages into rounded pieces. Easy to make - pleasure to eat.

I liked this recipe because it's very easy to make. I added diced potato chunks also, which was how my mother used to make it.
