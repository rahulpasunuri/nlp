I thought this was a really nice dish with great flavor. I loved the flavor the dill gave to the peas, and definitley use fresh dill. I took the advice of another cook and waiting until serving time to mix in the bacon so that it doesn't become soggy. Glad I did!

I liked the combination of dill with peas. I'd remove the bacon while cooking the peas because it became soggy .

Super easy. Nice because no one pays attention to peas....no special pea recipes....I might season to taste with salt, because bacon is so salty already, then it calls for a tsp. which is a bit too much. Probably can skip the butter at the end too, but i didn't. and this dish was rich and delicious, and pretty! served with grilled lemon-pepper rubbed halibut.

Easy but on the dull side. No pizazz.

Nice diversion from boiled or steamed peas. If it has bacon in it, my husband is gonna love it!!! Didnt wow me, but I would make again.

Tasty and hearty vegetable dish. I served it next to Polish-style beef steaks with sour cream sauce, which complemented the dill very well. I used dried dill, but I suppose it's essential to use fresh for a fresher taste.

After all the raves I just had to try this. Great side, lots of flavor. I may even add more dill next time.

I absolutely loved this! Who would think such a simply recipe would rate four stars, yet it does. This is so easy you could serve everyday and would be a hit as a fancy side, or on a buffet. I will definately be making this again!

Not WOW, but pretty darn tasty! The dill was a nice touch. I served this at a women's dinner party and everyone loved it.

Easy and quick. The dill really adds to the dish with a fresh spring flavor. My children loved this and vegetables are always a challenge. I will definitely make again.

Very easy and flavorful. Nice side dish for either every day dinner or something "different" for guests.

The better the bacon, the better it is. We use Neuskie's Applewood Smoked Bacon. Great smokey flavor which really works in this dish with the dill. Making 1/2 the recipe (one box of peas, 1/2 of everything else) is plenty for four as a side dish.
