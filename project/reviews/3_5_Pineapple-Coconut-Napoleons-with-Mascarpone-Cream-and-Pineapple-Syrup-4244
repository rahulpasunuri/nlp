This is an exceptional desert. I love the jalapeno pinapple reduction sauce!

This was absolutely fabulous, and incredibly easy. I used water, since I didn't have pineapple juice, and it was still lovely. I also used Greek Yogurt instead of the Marscapone, and added a bit of the syrup to it to sweeten it. Complements all around, even from the chef who almost never comments on what I serve unless it is exceptional. Oh yes, I used the baking paper: a brilliant suggestion; the tuilles wanted to stick but with the paper all but the first three came right off.

Just made the tuiles...the batter was very loose. Ended up spreading all whole thing on silpat, baking it and cutting out circles. Liked the concept of adding coconut..will use my recipe next time but add coconut. Also maybe put the coconut in the food processor so the cookies will cut better. The edges were rough

This was an excellent, unique dessert. Don't be scared by the ingredients for the syrup. I made it exactly as instructed and it was fantastic. The pineapple does not turn out spicy, but instead has a nice depth of flavor instead of simply being sweet. These were easy to do ahead, up until the last minute assembly, which was quick. My guests loved it, the only problem was that they were very messy to eat. Emjoy!

I loved the recipe, syrup and all. I doubled it for a dinner party, and I have two comments related to that: First, I did not double the spices in the syrup because I was afraid it might be too overwhelming--using the original quantities worked fine. Second,the reduction time for the syrup took much longer than the recipe stated because of the quantity I made.

I made this dessert for a dinner party. Everyone raved about this unusual treat. It is a little time consuming, but was well worth the effort. The addition of the jalepeno pepper gave it an interesting kick. I would definitely make this again.

Making the tuiles is easier and less of a palaver if you use non-stick paper (such as Bakewell). Nothing will stick to that. Your tuiles will slide off, and no oil is needed. This recipe makes very large tuiles, so I trimmed them into small (3") squares which looked rather professional alternated with the pineapple rings. Pineapple syrup is nasty - don't use it to drizzle! I made a simple chocolate sauce instead (cocoa powder, sugar, water)and served that chilled. Also substituted half fat creme fraiche for mascarpone mix as felt latter would be extremely rich - tuiles are already rich.
