I like the balance of flavours and textures in this recipe, particularly the sharpness of the ginger, the fragrance of curry, the smoothness of the fish, and the cruchiness from the veg. I used baby bok choy instead of shanghai bok choy, as it is a bit more tender (but still crisp). I didn't bother with the sugar, but will try rice wine vinegar instead next time, as suggested by one of the other reviewers. Serve with fragrant jasmine rice. Delicious.

I used scallops because the super market didn't have any of the called for fish. Delicious. I cut down on the sugar and also the salt. We noticed that the house reeked of scallps, ginger and curry for two days. Not totally unpleasant. January and not condusive to opening windows. I thought the vegetable combinations and the seasonings were excellent.

My wife and I modified this a bit, based on a dish I like to get at Cafe Santorini, in Pasadena, CA. The modification is to add just a little soy sauce and the juice of two small lemons (thus a ginger lemon soy broth). We used all the ginger but otherwise cut the broth in half to serve 2 rather than 4. We also heeded the advice of those who warned against adding sugar. We prepared the fish (we used Wahoo - aka Ono) exactly as the recipe instructed, and served it over soba noodles. It was absolutely delicious.

We put the spice rub onto the flesh side of the fish, as opposed to the skin side, and it worked well.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I like the contrast of the crunchiness of the breaded fish against the soupiness it is set on. However, it needs to be served very quickly so the fish does not get soggy. With proper presentation, it is something that can be served as a course for a fine dinner. I did not add the sugar as the recipe instructed to do so. Came out very well.

This was fabulous! I used rice wine instead of sugar. Other than that, I followed the recipe. Definitely this one is a keeper!

I modified this a bit and used monk fish - which was delicious. I also simplified the broth significantly and used only carrots onions and ginger which made the flavors much simnpler, but very nice

In response ro kschanak from Lonville, MN on 12/31/05, I agree on the white sugar theory of keeping it in baking and in dressings. I use light cornsyrup instead... no aftertaste as it is mild and the corn alcohols change the molecular structure when heated. Also try adding a teaspoon of white vinegar to the sugar to bring down the pH. This acidity also keeps the "nauseating sweetness" at bay. Good Luck, and Good Eats! Alex

I have to know the answer before I make this: Is the Shanghai boK choy the same as baby bok choy? Please email to: thecordells@comcast.net thank you!

OK, maybe I shouldn't rate this as I made a change, but we thought my version was very good. I substituted large sea scallops for the bass and tossed them with the salt, pepper, curry powder & corn starch before searing in 1 tsp light sesame oil & 1/2 tsp veg oil. (Still used veg oil for bokchoy/carrots/ginger & sesame oil in finished broth mixture.) I also added a sliced red chili in the stir-fry step, and subbed mirin for the sugar. I thought this was a fast easy dish - 45 minutes from first chop to sit-down. I used 4 scallops per person for dinner. This would also make a nice started dish with 2 scallops each.

I haven't made this yet but wanted to suggest adding a little mirin (sweetened rice wine) instead of the sugar. I agree that white sugar leaves a bad aftertaste.

This is a good recipe, but very time consuming. And my advice is DO NOT use sugar in this recipe! It leaves a very strong after taste that is, well, nauseating. I have a real problem with white sugars being used in anything other than baking or maybe dressings. White sugars are especially bad in Oriental-type cooking. I wish I could suggest an alternative, but the natural sugars in the carrots should be enough to stave off bitterness of the bokchoy and the saltiness of the broth should give enough flavor so it isn't mundane. The fish is outstanding, however, and I would make it again with some adjustments.
