Delicious as is! My guests were mesmerized as I plated this salad--it was just so beautiful! And then they quickly ate it all up. This will now be a staple in my salad rotation.

This will be a new standard for me. Beautiful and delicious. My husband who never finishes a salad ate every last scrap of this and gave me an unprecedented "salad compliment." It blew me away.

This is good. Not "wonderful! special!", because I found it a little too bitter and you have to invest a lot of time with a sharp knife or a mandoline. But it's pretty good and maybe in the summer when the ingredients can be had fresh/local it would be better.

Delicious and aesthetically pleasing! This is the tastiest salad I've had in a long time. Great combination of flavors and colors. This recipe is definitely a keeper and would make a great salad for entertaining. Used Bleu d'Auvergne instead of Roquefort. Yummy.

I made this salad for a dinner party and everybody was ranting and raving about how delicious it was. It has just the right combination of flavors, textures and crispy freshness! I will be making this for Xmas dinner

This salad is great...and even better if you slice an orange in it. Instead of roquefort I used bleu d'auvergne, which is fantastic.

I made this last night and it was good, then made it again for lunch today adding a cup of strawberries and it was amazing!

The unusual ingredients intrigued me, so I tried this for my gourmet group. Besides tasting great, the presentation was lovely, so it was perfect for the occasion. My husband and I loved it and the group seemed to like it as well. The arugula at my local grocery store was quite picked over, so I filled it out with red leaf lettuce. I made the dressing the night before and assembled all of the other ingredients ahead of time so all I had to do was toss it and arrange it on the plates before serving. All in all, a wonderful recipe.

The salad was delicious, but the dressing was a favorite in this home. It was a welcome change from the typical balsamic vinegar abased dressings we usuaully use.

I don't usually try recipes which haven't been rated but I had all the ingredients on hand (I used Maytag Blue instead of Roquefort though)and loved it. I got rave reviews from those who happened to have it for dinner. It is a great salad...I even included it in my Thanksgiving menu and it went over so well there was none left!
