Not only does this salad look appealing it tastes great. I followed suggestions about cooking zucchini before and was happy with the results. They had a more "noodle" texture. I also substituted champagne vinegar for lemon juice and liked the subtle acid taste. My basil crop was taken by a hail storm, so I used (and don't frown at me) the freeze dried option Litehouse sells and it still gave that great basil taste.

A great way to use tomatoes and zucchini from your garden. I followed the advice of others and sauteed the corn with the zucchini in EVOO. Used regular garden tomatoes chopped in place of the grape toms. I was afraid that this recipe would be a little boring, and it wasn't. If your veggies are good and fresh, the dressing allows them to be the star. Loved this, and will make it again.

I went throgh the process of salting the zucchini and then sauteed it in a little olive oil with the corn. I also added a few diced sacllons, used balsamic in lieu of the lemon juice and a tsp of honey in lieu of the sugar. I was very yummus!

This was pretty good, but not exceptional. I'm not sure if I'll make it again because for some reason the zucchini tasted a little bit floury to me. I kind of like the idea of grilling the zucchini, but it means that the recipe would take considerably more time and effort than I feel like putting into it, because I feel like the whole point of this recipe is to simply serve some of the tasty produce of the summer. It's worth a try, though--maybe you'll like it a little more than I did.

I halved this recipe last week & it was so good that we did the full receipe for guests on the weekend. I thickly sliced the zucchini, then grilled it with EVOO & S & P to crisp tender. I chopped the zuc into corn kernal sized dice. I also grilled the corn in husk rather than boiling. Unfortunately I wasn't able to find fresh basil but used the frozen cubes the first time & from a tube the second. Both worked but I'm sure fresh would be nicer. This really presented well & got rave reviews at dinner. We'll definitely make again.

I followed the recipe but didn't have exact amounts of the vegetables/basil. It didn't matter- this was a great dish! Used fresh ingredients from the farmer's market, cut the dressing in half, and made orzo with grated fresh parmesan and put the salad over that to serve as a main dish. Served w/oven roasted baby potatoes- yum! I did salt and drain the zucchini, which was great, I think because I cut it in the julienne style by hand it was a little thicker and the sweetness of the fresh zucchini was wonderful with the salty taste.

Delicious and fresh recipe - great for summer. Followed recipe exactly except did not cook corn.

fresh parsely also works instead of basil. I added chanterelle mushrooms once and it also worked nicely. I agree with other posters - lightly blanche or grill the zucchini instead of salting, etc. ENJOY!

Just ok.

I really liked the flavours in this salad but next time I will grill the zucchini rather than salt it. I felt that the zucchini as prepared in the recipe didn't add anything positive to the salad.

I made this over the weekend and thought it was good, but julienning the zucchini was unnecessary. Or maybe it's just my mandoline: the zucchini was so thin it gooped together too much. Next time I'll just make small chunks of the zucchini. Taste is nice, though.

Ommited the salt- no need for that and it will take aways the Freshness of the zucchini

I started making this dish several years ago and following the instructions of a very helpful reviewer replaced the lemon juice with high-quality balsamic vinaigrette. I also never use anything but fresh ingredients because it makes a big difference in the taste and the wonderful, fresh crunch. This recipe has gotten rave after rave at every dinner party, barbecue, and brunch I've ever served it at. I highly recommend it but make sure to use balsamic vinaigrette instead of lemon juice (you can put in a little squeeze of lemon juice depending on your taste, but I usually don't).

Very fresh and yummy. I wasn't sure whether futzing with the zucchini, salt, and strainer, but it was.

I substituted cilantro for the basil, threw in some black olives, and dressed it with a garlic vinaigrette. It was a big hit.

My guess is that the pasta-looking objects in the photo are the julienned zucchini. Hence, no pasta.

The picture looks like the salad is mixed with pasta of some sort??? But no pasta is listed in the recipe? What's up with that? Pasta or not?

This salad was absolutely gorgeous with the red tomatoes, the green in the zucchini, and the yellow corn. I thought it was good, but not great. I think next time I will roast the corn on the grill. I think the dressing could bea bit more upfront. Also, I would let the zucchini sit for 2-3 hours instead of just 1 hour. The one hour mark produced a scant teaspoon of liquid.

A very tasty (and pretty!) salad. I've made it several times and it's always turned out well.

Very good flavor! Light and refreshing. I had to use frozen corn but it still was delicious.

I made this recipe several times last summer then lost my copy of it. I'm thrilled to find it again. I julienned the zucchini at home and took it to our summer cabin where cooking conditions are VERY primitive. I picked up fresh corn in the Central Valley on the way to the cabin. It was just fabulous!!!

The texture of this salad makes it outstanding. It really compliments steak right off the grill. Make sure the corn you use is sweet.

This salad is all ready an all time favorite among family and friends. It is a showstopper - so long as you follow the recipe and do not cut corners, be it ingredients or method. It is a summer salad and can only stand out when the freshest of ingredients are used. For the tastiest results, start at the farmer's market.

I really would rather rate this 2.5 forks. It was tasty. I also shredded the zucchini in the food processor but next time I will do as the recipe says and see if that makes it a little better. When shredded in the processor, the zucchini pieces were too small and limp. Overall a good side dish.

I shredded the zuchinni in my Cuisinart and also used frozen corn. I think this salad is delightful! It is a nice change from lettuce or pasta or potato for the summer, and it is SO pretty with the colors and shapes. The dressing could use something - it is fine, but not special. And I don't know if the salad would hold up well at a potluck, but I hope it does because it is just the right refreshing mix of flavors and is so festive.

I loved this salad. Perfect in summer when you have it all in your garden. I think this would be great when you sign up for salad at a potluck because it's easy, tasty, and different.

Recipe is a great side dish to any italian cusine. Even without lemon juice it works well. Try a red wine vigarette dressing for a splash of flavor.

Delicious salad. Freshness of the ingredients is definitely key.

I made this with regular tomatoes - fresh and ripe and juicy. The zucchini tasted very salty so I had to rise it well before adding it to the salad. I also added orrechiette pasta and served it as our main. It was ok, but I don't know if I would make it again. The freshness of the vegetables was by far the key element.
