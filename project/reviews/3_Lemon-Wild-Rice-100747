In place of the white rice I used black rice which made the dish much more enjoyable. I also added a splash of lemon juice and topped with broiled salmon.

I also increased the wild rice and used brown short grain rice instead of the white rice (healthier). I stirred in some fresh grated carrot for color. The lemon zest married well with the grassy flavor of the wild rice. Everyone loved this dish. Not your tradiional rice pilaf.

Use chicken broth instead of water and this is a wonderful side dish--try it with the grilled salmon cakes with lemon mayonaise. Yum.

Turned out great! Not bland at all.

A great recipe. I increased the amount of wild versus regular rice. I don't think it needs all the extra spicing others are advising, although I tend to serve it with something saucy (great with veal or ckn picata).

I haven't tried the recipe as written because of all the bad reviews. I added a clove of garlic, juice of 3/4 lemon, a finely-diced tomato, and a splash of vegetable stock. With these additions, it was a great fall accompaniment.

Not every rice has to taste like Rice-a-Roni. Food does not have to be overloaded with flavor to be good. Too many reviews here mistake subtle as bland. This rice is supposed to be delicately flavored so that it doesn't interfere with the main course that it's served with. Emeril-ites, ease off on the garlic and the seasoning salt and enjoy more gentle flavors for a change!

I think this recipe is haunted. I'm pretty good at sprucing up a boring dish, but though I cooked the rice in chicken broth, added copious amounts of butter and hazlenut oil and tons of spice, I couldn't seem to impart a "wow" quality to this by any stretch of the word.

This recipe was bland, bland bland, I don't mind subtle, but this was tasteless. I used good quality wild rice, and tried to perk it up with extra lemon juice and butter at the end with no luck. I'll skip making this recipe again.

I have made this recipe several times. I find the flavors very subtle, but quite suitable as a side dish for several entrees. REAL wild rice (the expensive kind!, not a substitute, is imperative, however.

Very Bland. I added garlic and lemon juice and it was still bland. If I were to make it again I would try using Chicken Broth to cook the rice.

This recipe was very bland and tasteless. I tried to doctor is up by squeezing fresh lemon on it in addition to the zest. It perked it up a little, but I wouldn't make it again.
