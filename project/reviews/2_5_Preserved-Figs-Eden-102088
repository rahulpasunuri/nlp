I wish there were negative numbers! :) the taste did not appeal to me at all. Pith or orange and lemon gave a peculiar not-so-pleasant bitterness, definitely too much of quantity of spices for 16 figs however large. I had to throw it away. So unfortunate, as I love figs.

I followed this recipe to the letter. The type of fig was not mentioned. I used a green fig, very tasty when eaten raw. The amount of sugar four pounds) and water could probably have been reduced by half. There was far too much syrup when the cooking time was over. There wasn't much spice flavor, but that may improve with age. I filled 4 pint jars, 4 figs each, and still had a lot of syrup left over. It could be used as pancake or waffle syrup I guess.
