Delicious. I used mixed greens instead of escarole. Crunchy shallots are good on anything!

Very good! I'm not rating because I used sliced apples instead of prunes. But the overall concept was great, the dressing was easy and good (though this is too much salt).

I made the whole recipe for 2 and ended up eating 3 large bowls of this salad it was so good. I substituted blood oranges for the prunes, however. Although good, in retrospect a fruit with less acidity may be better w/the lemony dressing.
