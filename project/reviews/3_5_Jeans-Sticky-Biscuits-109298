It is completely misleading to call this a biscuit. I would call it cooked dense dough with orange juice and sugar. Is it because I used butter instead of vegetable oil? I dunno, I kept thinking about how it tasted like sweet & sour chinese food. blah!

Great recipe. I used margarine instead of butter for the glaze and low-fat milk to try to cut out some of the fat. It still came out tasting fantastic.

Exceptionally good. My mother and I cooked just the biscuits by themselves to pair with grilled BBQ chicken and homemade mashed potatoes (the recipe came from here as well coincidentally.) Everything was sublime. The biscuits, which came out late due to forgetfulness, were the perfect ending to the meal and were very tasty. Not sure how to describe it by it was awesome either way.

I wanted a fast biscuit to use with leftover Thanksgiving fixins. This one is fast, but is pretty tasteless as a stand-alone biscuit. I'd make them again for this purpose, but I'd use melted butter instead of oil. Half & half might add some richness as well. Still, they had a decent layering and texture, and were done in no time. I split them and topped them with leftover mashed potatoes and gravy-soaked turkey. Yum.

Mediocre... These have neither the depth of flavor of a yeast sticky roll nor the richness and fluffy-crispy texture of biscuits. Also, the glaze is extremely sweet,so the cinnamon flavor doesn't come through like it should. Not bad, exactly, I just think it's worth spending a little extra time to make the real thing! (and cut back on the sugar)

Very fast and easy to put together. About 30min from melting butter to eating a warm fresh out of the oven biscuit. Will not replace the more traditional yeast variety but I will make again when short on time and craving something sweet. I did cut back on the amount of butter in the glaze by half and used a good splash of milk in place of the o.j. b/c I didn't have any on hand. I also doubled the filling.

These sticky buns were amazing. I loved the glaze that went with this.

These were fine but not something I would make for guests. I usually like orange with my cinnamon rolls but not so much in these. I will dedicate extra time to work with yeast the next time.

These were very easy to prepare and tasted great.Just one question for expert reviewers out there:do I use the whole amount of glaze?, it just didn't seem right to me.Maybe next time I won't use the glaze at all 'cause I was looking for something less sweet that morning.

Wonderful! Easy! Delicious! Adjectives begin to fail me but these were great and I'll definately make them again with my own twists-- pecans & raisins. These rolls are versatile and wonderfully caramel-y. Perfect for a cold wet morning and strong coffee. Thanks!

i made these buns just before collecting my children from school, so they would be warm. need i say that they were a hit! i used light olive oil because that was the only light flavoured oil i had; i'd like to know if it would work with butter?? i might try that next time.

I did everything possible to screw up this recipe - couldn't find my real rolling pin, had to refrigerate before baking, overbaked a bit - and it was STILL delicious and a huge hit at brunch! Very delicious and easy to make, especially from someone who is rolling-out-dough challenged.

I made these from the original recipe (from the American Century Cookbook) and was surprised at how easy they were to make and how impressive they looked and tasted. Definitely something to wow last-minute brunch guests.
