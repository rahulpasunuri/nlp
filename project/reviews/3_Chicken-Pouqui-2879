This recipe has great bones b/c it contains things that are typically in my kitchen already. It just needed to be brought into the 21st century. I deleted the butter and used only extra virgin olive oil. Also, there is nothing worse than dry chicken, so I increased the sauce volume using the whole can of cream of chicken soup, substituted 1/2 and 1/2 w/ milk (increasing that amount to achieve an appropriate thickness for sauce) and finally upped the white wine. I also sauteed the chicken (cut into bite-size pieces) in olive oil and seasoned w/ sea salt and ground pepper. Served over orzo, w/ steamed asparagus as a side (topped w/ lemon juice and garlic salt). Young kids loved it, as did my picky husband.

Both my husband and I loved this dish. Made exactly as stated and it came out wonderful. I will definitely make this again.

I was not as enthralled with this dish as some others. I am a lover of cream sauces, so I thought I'd love this. It wasn't very flavorful, even though I used a tablespoon of fresh thyme instead of the half tablespoon of dried. It might be improved by some more wine or sherry at the end. I'll probably try this again since I have some leftover soup (!), but I think it needs doctoring up.

quite good for something so easy!

A good mid-week recipe (took about 20 minutes). Especially nice as most if not all ingredients are on hand. I added a shallot to the onions and more wine and half and half to increase the amount of sauce. I think next time I'll cook the chicken and then deglaze the pan and make the sauce that way.

Following previous suggestions, I added mushrooms and served over mashed potatoes - wonderful! The thyme really makes this dish. This will be made frequently at my house.

This is one of my favorite recipes from this site. I always double the sauce and fiddle with the spices a bit, with great results. Yummy!

This chicken was very yummy! I used evap. milk instead of cream and low-fat margarine. I doubled the sauce because I love sauce. Although I accidentally put in 3 T of thyme instead of 1 T. Still tasted good. My fiance didn't like it though as he claims he does not like thyme. How one knows that is beyond me. I still liked it!

The recipe could have been made better with the addition of some colorful vegetable(s) such broccoli, carrots, green beans. the taste was nice but it reminded me of a version of my Dad's chicken noodle casserol. And believe me that is not a compliment!

I really liked this recipe not only for it's great taste, but because it was extremely easy. I like a lot of sauce so I used a whole can of soup and 1/2 cup of 1/2&1/2, and 6 tbls. of wine.

A nice basic hearty dish - I added garlic and additional spices. Using less oil and ff margarine to sautee the chicken/garlic, and using skim milk instead of cream, and low fat soup base made this a low cal/low fat meal that tasted very rich!

I added mushrooms to the sauce and deglazed the saute pan with about a tablespoon or so of wine and added it to the sauce. The dish tasted good, presented well and was extremely fast and easy. What more can you ask? I served it with yellow rice. It would also be good with buttered noodles or garlic mashed potatoes. I will definitely make this again.
