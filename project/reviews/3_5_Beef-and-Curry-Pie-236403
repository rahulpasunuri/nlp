The beef pie turned out to be delicious with a moist filling and crunchy, flaky crust. I followed the other reviewers' suggestion of adding some water or chicken stock to make it more moist. I added about 1/2 cup while stir frying the potatoes. I didn't have madras curry on hand but I had the Japanese one so I used that. The curry taste was not overpowering and provided a nice contrast to the seasoning of the beef. I also used lean ground beef since that's what I had on hand.

I'd give more than 4 stars if I could. . . soooo good! The only change I made was to use 3/4 pound of LEAN ground beef and substituted 2+ Tablespoons of Hoison sauce for for the soy and sugar! Also preboiled the potatoes for approximately 20 minutes. Oh, and instead of pastry sheets used purchased pie crust that I had on hand! PERFECT!!1

I always have to add to this recipe. My family wasn't fond of the frozen puff pastry, so I wrapped the filling in French bread dough (Pillsbury). I would make it again, just not too often and not exactly as written.

What am I missing?!!? Most of the reviews say it's great but really, it's soooo bland and uninteresting!

I didn't have the dough, so I used a pillsbury French bread dough that I had hanging around. I also used ground turkey instead of chuck. The flavor was great! I had to add a little more oil when browning the meat, but still an awesome dish.

This is positively wonderful. My husband is from New Zealand and he said this is far better than the pies he had there. I followed the recipe and the aroma throughout the house was incredible. As I was cooking the filling, I felt it needed golden raisins--regular raisins won't do. The addition of the raisins along with the incredible blending of flavors (the Madras Curry is a must) went over the top of the taste meter. Here are some other ways I used up the left over filling. I had some Pepridge Farm puff shells and I used them as I did the sheets, I easily rolled each shell into a 5" round, and used 2 shells for each pie. It worked perfectly and was a lot easier than fiddling around with the sheets--nice scalloped edges too. Today I used the filling in Filo dough, served it with smooched baby potatoes (first boiled, smooched in the frying pan and fried)and topped everything with a poached egg. Gourmet delight. This recipe has unlimited possibilities.

Love this recipe. We make it again and again, and while the filling is a bit dry that can be easily remedied with a bit of water or broth. Am so glad it's getting cool again so I can make this!

Didn't love it. I followed the recipe as written, only substituting heated pita bread, as another cook suggested instead of the recipe's puff pastry and adding cooked mushrooms seasoned with garlic and white wine. Several cooks recommended using left over creamed (mashed) potatoes instead of the cooked russet potato. which would have been so much better. I agreed with the majority of reviews that the beef filling was dry, despite adding more water. I went to the extra expense of buying the Madras curry, and found the the curry too dominating. I didn't mind the hot curry, but the curry flavor over-powered the other ingredients.

Just loved this recipe ! Great taste and so quick and easy to make. I added a bit of garlic, parsley and a few mushrooms to the filling... yummy ! Did half the recipe with puff pastry the first time, but stuffed small pita breads with the filling the second time ! Even better !! A few drops of olive oil and salt on the pitas to make sure they'll be nicely crisp, bake 10 minutes at 375°.

I liked this recipe. I added garlic, spinach and peas! Also, a little water to moisten it.

When I made these, I used leftover mashed potatoes as well, instead of uncooked russets. Also, I added about 1/2 tsp. ground ginger and 1/4 tsp. garlic salt. I used the frozen mixed veggies, cooking them in the microwave before adding them to the rest of the mixture. Then, instead of making larger pies with the fillo dough, I used my muffin tray to make a dozen somosa-style pies. All in all it was a good meal, but definitely needed some kind of sauce to top it off. I'd do a side curry sauce next time. May make these again for an appetizer.

Yummy. One box will go far enough for the amount of filling made. Fairly easy.

Excellent, I would definitley agree with using madras - it was nice with "regular" curry but would be "beyond compare" with a little more kick.

This was awesome! My family requests this recipe often and it's a great blend of flavors!

Yum! These are great, and really easy to make. Surprising how far 1/2 pound of meat, a potato, and a handful of peas can go. You don't need two boxes of puff pastry (Pepperidge Farm) to make eight pies; you can re-roll the scraps and get 16 5-inch rounds (I actually used a quart yogurt container top, which is more like 4-1/2 inches). However, there's filling for more like 12. The filling isn't exactly dry, but maybe a dollop of leftover gravy would be good. I'll make them again as is, though.

I used ground venison and it was to die for. Everyone I fed, wanted the recipe. No problem about it being dry or greasey. For the users that didn't have enough pastry...may I suggest you go back, try again, and stay small! It's a winner.

I found this to be really easy to make, I didn't have enough puff pastry and ended up making two bigger square pies rather than the 5-inch circles, it was delicious and not too dry. Me and my husband ate it right up and intend to make it again soon.

We thought these were great. Added a bit of butter to the saute, and mushroom, and used cubed filet instead; and they weren't dry at all. Steak pies are not supposed to be wet. These were flakey and flavorful.

I thought it was boring. Dry despite increasing the liquid. My friend however loved them! I will make again with modifications.

This is easy to make, but the filling was not great - as some others mentioned it was a bit dry. I will use this concept again for a different filling.

I follow the recipe exactly as written. Very tasty. It makes 8 pies, I wouldn't say 8 servings though. Very good, will make again.

I made this as written, but ended up making one "pot pie", since I had less puff pastry in the freezer than I thought. The family consensus is that we should have it again (divided as to whether we want small pies, though). Needs some fixing, though. Less meat (yes, I said less) and more potato, more curry, and use a touch of oil to fry the onions and potatoes and use lean meat. It was too greasy tasting for my liking.

I made this with ground turkey and it tasted wonderful! I had about a cup of leftover mashed potatoes, and used that instead. I speeded up the recipe by adding the onions a few minutes before the turkey was finished, then added in the potatoes. I also used frozen mixed veggies (corn, beans, carrots, and peas), which worked fine. My husband loved it, and I served it with some chutney I had. Great recipe!

I was looking for a recipe to use some leftover skirt steak. I used it in this recipe instead of the ground beef and it was delicious. I also did not have puff pastry on hand, but had some frozen pie crusts. I rolled them out quite thin, and it worked very well. The flavor reminds me a bit of a samosa. I'll definitely make this one again!

Everyone loved this- even my kids. Had less puff pastry than I thought in the freezer so, instead of individual pies, put the meat mixture in a casserole and covered with pastry. It was great.

This is the recipe I have been looking for! My husband is from New Zealand and they have meat pies in every bakery there, and there is nothing like them here. Until now. He ate three of them in one sitting! I know I will be making this recipe again and again, the pies are so tasty. It only took an hour start to finish plus baking time. To answer the previous reviewer, I too was skeptical about only 1/2 lb of meat not being enough. Thing is, when you add the potato it bulks up the mix a ton, and there was even about 2/3 C leftover stuffing after the pies were made.

I used regular ground beef (80% lean) and added a teaspoon or so of ground ginger to add more flavor. I also used more water, about 8 tablespoons so it wasn't so dry. I was able to make 8 smaller sized pies (about 3 inch diameter) using 1 package of puff pastry. Delicious! It tastes best straight out of the oven

I haven't made this yet, but plan to. I am curious...how can 1/2 lb. of meat, 1 potato and a small amount of peas make 8 servings?

Rating: 4
Me again. One error I made, just brought to my attention: I neglected to use ground beef. For some reason I saw "beef chuck" and not "ground beef chuck." Dumb. I bought thinly-sliced beef chuck and sliced it into small chunks, like the potato and onion. But it was, as I said, wonderful. So....

As soon as I saw this recipe in Gourmet I had to try it. I followed it exactly, even going to the trouble of buying "Madras" curry powder instead of the "regular" curry powders I already had. It was DELICIOUS. The only qualm: the filling was slightly dry. But that didn't affect the wonderful flavor. My lean & healthy husband ate three pies. I will make this repeatedly.

This was a great Pie and as a Kiwi I am a bit of a expert (New Zealanders love pies)
