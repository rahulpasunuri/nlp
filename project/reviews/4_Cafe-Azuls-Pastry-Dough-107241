It really works! I'm serving empanadas for a party today, and I was nervous to serve a trial-run of a recipe at a party, but I just pulled a couple out of the oven and they are perfect. In fact, I think this is the best pastry dough I've ever made. Bake with confidence!

Ridiculously good. Deviantly unhealthy. Hooray.

Light tender crust. Melts in your mouth good. Sweet even though no sugar is used. Awesome no fail. Used my food processor and halved the recipe for a double crust.

We used half the butter and regular white wine vinegar and it was still awesome. If fact, I can only imagine more butter making it greasy.

Yes, it is not a traditional empanada recipe, which are probably made with more water and oil instead of butter/shortening. Also, I chilled it for a little over an hour and it was ivery workable; more than that and I can see how it would harden and become more difficult to work with.

I used this for ground beef empanadas. The dough is mre forgiving and easier to work with than other, more traditional pastry recipes Ive used, probably because the egg gives it "flexibility. The smell when baking is simply incredible and the result is the flakiest crust I have ever made. BTW, this recipe halved is equivalent to more than a single pie crust, maybe even a double crust if you can roll it out thin enough, or about a dozen empanadas. Dont be put off by the champagne vinegar either; I will use this from now on for both sweet and savory pastry recipes.

Great for the empanadas, but it has also become my standard pastry dough recipe. I use it for all sweet and savory recipes!

Simply Amazing! I made Chilean meat empanadas stuffing and wanted to try a different dough. I followed the recipe as shown but used white wine vinegar instead. So easy to make, easy to handle in my opinion , too. This is a keeper, it is going directly into my permanent book of oustanding recipes.

I LOVED this pastry! I used it for empanadas, but found it a bit too rich for the picadillo filling I used. I would definately use it again, but not with a meat filling. Can't wait to try it in a pie!

Sensational pastry dough recipe. I use it for my empanadas and every time I get RAVE reviews. Yes, it is buttery. Very buttery. Some might say too buttery, but when it's cut with the acidity of a good empanada filling, it's just rich and wonderful. What I especially love about it is that it's so incredibly easy. I've used Rose Levy Birnbaum's dough recipe before, and while it's perhaps better than this one, it is so time consuming that I tend not to make it often at all.

This pastry is almost identical to one that my Grandmother taught me to make 20 years ago. She called hers, 'Never Fail Pie Crust'. This is the first time that I have seen another pastry dough that incorporates the egg and the vinegar. I don't know why, but it does make an incredible crust!!! One of the best recepies I know!

This is the best pastry dough recipe yet. I use it for both sweet and non-dessert dishes. It is delicious. When I make empanadas with this dough they disappear in minutes. I do not add salt just use salted butter for empadadas. My empanadas filling consists of ground beef fried with onions together mixed with canned corn and salsa.

This was way too buttery and heavy for my taste. Perhaps it works better for something sweet, but it was not what I was expecting for empanadas. If you're looking for a calzone-like (for lack of a better way to describe it) exterior for your emapanadas, this is not the recipe. This baked dough reminds me of rich cheese puffs instead (not a bad thing, but not what I wanted for empanadas).

This was great pastry dough. It browned nicely and was very flaky. Rolling out the chilled dough took some effort. All the butter made for a very firm dough. My only complaint is that the leftover scraps were hard to work with. I tried to gather them and roll them out again, but the dough was like elastic. I could stretch it out, but it would just shrink back to its original size.

i agree with all the other reviewers. this is one of the best pastry doughs i have ever made. flaky, flaky, flaky. i used it with a different empanada filling up any would do. i actually substituted basalmic vinagar (couldn't find champagne) and it worked fine. i also used the dough after letting it sit in the fridge overnight. no problem.

The best recipe I've ever used.

Not only is this an amazingly easy pastry dough to make and work with, it can be microwaved to be reheated. It freezes wonderfully uncooked, and once baked(I generally use it for empanadas, the pastries can be reheated in the microwave and they turn out even flakier than before, making this a great recipe for parties.

The filling for the mushroom-squash empanadas was so pungent that I need to try this crust again w/ a less distracting filling before I can know whether I love it or not. I would suggest dividing the dough into thirds and wrapping them individually before chilling, because once it is very cold, it is very hard to separate off just one third. I subbed white wine vinegar for the champagne vinegar, and thought the dough turned out fine.

This is a fantastic pastry recipe. I have used it with sweets and savories (the empanadas, tarts, and pies) and works great with everything. I tried using Plugra one time to see if the flavor was improved over a regular butter, but the dough was MUCH more difficult to work with, and although the flavor was improved, it was not enough for the extra trouble. Otherwise, using a regular butter on a granite countertop, there was no difficulty working with the dough.

This is THE BEST pastry dough recipe I've ever tried, and I will certainly be experimenting with using it in other dishes. It tastes like a cross between pie crust and croissant. To make it easier to work with, be careful about keeping it cold. This dough gets very sticky when it gets even a little warm. Make sure you make it with ICE water and sit it in the refrigerator before you try to roll it out. It makes all the difference. Also flour your rolling surface.

This is one of the best pastry recipes I have ever made. It is a tad difficult to work with. I used a lot of plastic wrap. But the texture and flavor is just wonderful. I plan to use it a lot in the future.
