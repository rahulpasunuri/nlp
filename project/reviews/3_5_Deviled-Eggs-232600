Delicious! Exactly what I was looking for, I started small with the mayo, just adding little by little until I got the consistency that I wanted (per the warnings of other reviewers - thank you!). Added a few drops of Worcester and sprinkled a pinch of paprika on each egg, also used a Plastic pastry bag (you can Also fill a ziplock bag and snip a corner) to fill each egg to present for hor d'oeuvres. Everyone loved and I will definitely make again!

Have made this several times, and use half mayo and half nonfat Greek yogurt. I used one-half cup of mayo/yogurt mixture for 18 eggs, boosted the celery, pickles and relish and they were delicious.

I agree about too much mayo. The first time I made it the filling was too runny and looked too light of a color. When I halved the mayo it came out perfect! I added a couple tablespoons extra mustard. I also used sweet relish instead of chopping up pickles.

I made deviled eggs for a Halloween party just last week. For a firmer and richer filling substitute half the mayonnaise with some softened neufchatel cream cheese. Add a dash of Tabasco (or two, or three) and a dash of Worcestershire for some extra flavor.

A nice recipe! I took the advice of the previous reviewer and did not use as much mayonnaise, and the filling turned out really well. As a note, I forgot to add mustard. Five ingredients and I manage to forget something ... oh dear. But the sweet pickle added a lot of flavor, so the absence of mustard didn't seem to hurt. For the garnish, we did not have paprika on hand, so I used an extremely small amount of cayenne pepper for a dash of color.

Traditional yet very tasty deviled egg recipe. I was a bit disappointed with the consistency of the filling - it came out runny, which made the eggs look really ugly when I filled them. I would recommend lessening the amount of mayo for a less runny filling.

I add a little bit of white vinegar to the mayonnaise along with some powdered mustard. For some extra zip try adding 1/2 tsp. of Keen's hot mustard.

Was simple and loved it. Sprinkled some paprika powder on top of each.

This recipe tastes just like the recipe my Aunt Greta used to make. The only thing that makes it a little better is adding some of the sweet pickle juice. The celery adds a crunch that is a nice contrast to the smooth/creamy egg texture.

Made these for Easter -- These should be called Egg Salad Deviled Eggs, b/c that's really what they are and what they taste like. I like egg salad, but prefer it on a sandwich. I might make these again for a picnic lunch, but for next Easter, I will go with more of a traditional recipe.

Awesome! I nixed the celery and I used sweet relish instead of the pickles.

Easy and very quick to make. My children put the whole thing together, so it is very kid friendly.
