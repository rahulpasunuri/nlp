So my oven broke when I was trying to make this recipe :( So I had no choice but to boil the beets. I keep the water I boiled the beets in and used it in the soup as well. The color of the soup was fantastic, and the flavor was even better...absolutely loved this recipe, and the bf said it was the best soup I've made so far!!! I used veggie broth. and let it cook on the stove for a good 50 mins. I didn't use allspice, and I used fresh ginger instead of powder, black pepper and kosher salt. YUMMY WILL MAKE AGAIN!!!!

We love roasted beets so this was a natural for us. We used four different kinds of beets, two of which were a golden variety, making the color a vibrant magenta -- quite striking! As some others did, I used chicken stock instead of water, and about half the amount. I substituted Nantes carrots for the celery. The seasonings are inspired, though I did leave out the allspice as some suggested. We're on a low-fat regime so I substituted European-style plain nonfat yogurt for the crème fraîche, which worked really well. And of course I put the heart on top -- how could you not, with that picture?

Wow! This recipe is great. I made it for a dinner party and people were asking for the recipe. I will make this again for sure. I only made one minor change, I used chicken broth instead of water. An amazing dish!

This was a good base recipe. I was looking for a beet soup recipe, this was closest to what I had in mind. I followed the recipe mostly but added carrots, alot of them. I didn't have parsley but had fresh thyme, dill and cilantro. Tossed a wee bit of each in. I skipped the allspice, though love it in other foods this just didn't seem to fit with allspice, glad I left it out. Didn't have whipping cream, used half and half, worked fine. Extremely delicious soup!

This was a deliciously easy way to use up my bumper crop of beets. I served it with goat cheese and Swiss chard tart for a lunch that looked like it took hours but really was fast and easy.

This soup is amazing -- I have made this recipe several times and even the I-don't-like-beets people love it. Elegant, gorgeous, and absolutely delicious. Good advice on using chicken broth below -- thanks.

A lovely dish, in both looks and taste, and easy! Loved the sweetness of the beets combined w/ the tanginess of the sour cream.

Sadly, the color of the soup did not turn out well for me ... it was brown and muddy looking, instead of the pretty purple color in the picture. It tasted yummy though!

A great, simple recipe full of flavour - in short, perfect both for entertaining or an easy simple dinner or lunch. We used regular black pepper and slightly less cream, and thought the creme fraiche could have been cut in half. One tablespoon almost seemed to get in the way.

I added a bit more than they asked of all the veggies in the recipe as well as adding some small creamer potatoes- about 8 small ones. I used chicken broth instead of water and added full fat Total greek yogurt at the end and it was the best soup I have ever made. Totally delicious, tasty and light feeling but heavy enough to be comforting. I suggest some diced avocado to work as a garnish too.

A hit! I added a bit of chopped red cabbage as well (as per the traditional beet soup).And instead of all spice, I used garam masala for a bit of sweet spice. YUUUUUM.

This is a good recipe. One change, use 50/50 clear stock/Red Wine (shiraz) instead of water. The wine makes a nice flavour plus helps keep the desired colour. Also add a bit more allspice and ginger. Yumm and very pretty to look at as well.

Great soup! Mine was a bit watery, but I think that was my mistake. I'll definitely make it again. Next time, I think I'll tweak the ginger-to-allspice ratio, using the same amount of spice overall, but a little less ginger and a little more allspice. I may also try chicken stock in place of water. I will also remember to tie the herbs into a bouquet garni. While I suppose some folks might enjoy fishing for elusive bits of bay leaf and thyme in a blood-red pot of soup, I could do without repeating the experience.

We loved this soup. I made it as a starter for a 3-course valentine dinner. The flavors are amazing, the colors are also very special. If I am in a hurry, I will probably use a can of beets though. Also, the use of gloves when dealing with beets is a must otherwise you will end up with red fingers for few days

I made this soup for Valentine's Day and last night and it was superb! My husband and I both loved it. Beautiful color, excellent flavor. Followed the recipe to the letter and will make it again.

The dish was simple to make and especially lovely in color. It was delicious. I ended up steaming the beats instead of roasting, and they turned out great.

This was wonderful. Very nice colour, as in the picture. The roasted vegetables really gives the nice flavor. Make sure you do this part correctly. The portions are a small. I will double it next time. Was not able to do the heart well as my 35% cream was too light. Beware, they are not all the same thickness!!

This is a wonderful recipe for an out of the ordinary soup. It has terrific texture and compliments seafood entrees well. It is definately something that I will make again!

sexy and sophisticated. definetly delicious. substituting the water with stock was a good idea, so i used two cups of veggie broth instead. not the same outcome, but not in the least bit bland and certainly better. just look for broth that's kinda clear- otherwise, you'll cloud up the soup and dull the deep magenta color.

I had just harvested beets from my mom's garden and was looking for a different dish than my typical one to use some of them up. This was surprisingly good. It was a little bland for what we usually have for soups, and maybe next time would substitute stock for water, but very good for what it was. Great presentation too! It was a big hit with my dinner party!

I made this for Valentine's Day and my husband loved it. It had a nice red pink color like on the picture and was very tasty. I will make this again!

I enjoyed making this recipe very much. It was a suprise for the 10 or so folks at the dinner table, several of whom did not LIKE beets. All of whom LOVED this dish and asked for the recipe. My only criticism was I expected more servings than what I got so I would increase the number of beets in the recipe. It is a keeper.

It was a beautiful soup, pretty to look at, but disappointing to eat! I thought the allspice overwhelmed the sweetness of the beets. It had a smoky flavor that masked their fresh flavor. We tried to triple this recipe ( a recipe for two is somewhat useless in my world.) Maybe that threw off the proportion?

I strongly disagree with the last review...I made this soup for Valentine's Day too!.....even with the creme fraiche heart....and it was WONDERFUL! My guests loved it!! Great soup and I will definitely make it again!

I made this soup for my Valentine last night and was terribly disappointed! I followed the recipe exactly. There were a number of problems. The picture shows the soup to be deep red but mine was reddish brown yet I even weighed the beets to be sure of the quantity. I had to add red food coloring to make it look presentable. The recipe says to bake the beets and saute' the vegetables until they are beginning to brown. This resulted in a taste predominently of earthy roasted beet and browned onion-not very attractive. I improved it considerably by adding some chicken broth concentrate. I won't repeat this recipe but if I did, I would boil or microwave the beets, not brown the veg at all and use chicken stock rather than water.
