One of the keys to making this recipe it the allow both the squash and potato be completely cool, if not even cold by refrigerating both before combining with the rest of the ingredients. Cooking time is more like 3 to 5 minutes, in batches. After they float, there about done.

I was on a search for tender gnocchi pillows! Well, this recipe fits the bill. Only thing I changed was the amount of nutmeg. I only used 1/4 tsp. Plus, the cooking time was 5 minutes..Not 15. Very, very delicious!

I have made this recipe three times now and the last time I perfected it! The first two times I cooked the gnocchi the 15-17 min , it was way too long and the gnocchi were somewhat waterlogged. 3-5 min. is all that is required and the texture is much better. I also agree with increasing the sage amount. Awesome recipe! Lots of compliments.

Fabulous. I've made this twice now, last time for Christmas dinner. If you do not have a potato ricer, then use a mesh strainer which works just fine. To add a little extra flavor, flash fry whole sage leaves and sprinkle on top.

I thought this recipe was very easy to make and it turned out well. I never noticed that it took a great deal of time to make since I was cooking other things and doing other things waiting for the squash to bake and the potatoes to boil. I will definitely use this recipe again.

As someone who has long had trouble with homemade dough in general, my gnocchi turned out really well! I think the quality of squash and potato play an important role in this dish and the consistency of the dough. This recipe is time consuming but nothing that will ruin your day. But I doubt anyone who decides to make homemade gnocchi would ever think it's a snap to prepare. Enjoy!

After reading many reviews, I decided to make these and I am quite happy with how they turned out! They are really delicious. I actually froze the gnocchi and make half of the batch later, they were delicious. I also doubled the sage. Important: for these to be properly cooked, take them out as soon as they have floated to the top of the pot! Time does not really matter, freeze the gnocchi first, and only cook them until the float! Then these will be super delicious. Yum.

I had no problem with the dough, although I could not seem to get the rolls to 1/2 inch. They seemed stuck at 3/4 inch, so I just cut the roll at 1/2 inch intervals and turned each piece when depressing with fork. If it helps anyone, I found that using a floured thumb to hold one side of the gnocchi, then depressing other side with floured fork worked well. Then I used the fork to lift the gnocchi, help to release the thumb, and move it to the pan. I also froze for an hour and found the cooking time to be accurate. But I would expect that it would be less with less frozen gnocchi! My big problems were that I did not feel that the butternut squash flavor was as noticable as I would have liked it to be and I also felt that far too much butter was used for the saute stage, resulting in too greasy a gnocchi for my taste. Three tablespoons of butter (but all the sage called for) would probably work just as well. MY BIG QUESTION: WOULD THESE FREEZE WELL AND TASTE AS GOOD AFTER A WEEK OR SO IN THE FREEZER?

Made these for a dinner party along with rest of Lidia's menu, and they were outstanding! Light fluffy pockets of delisciousness. Time consuming, but well worth the effort. I followed other reviewers advice and froze them for an hour, then boiled them in the afternoon, mine took about 10-12 minutes. Then placed them back on parchment sheets covered with plastic and kept them in the fridge. To serve for dinner reheated in the butter sage mixture right before serving, so was very easy. I too doubled the sage. These would be a perfect dinner on their own with some good crusty bread, a salad and great wine!

These were delicious. My dough was the perfect consistency. I needed to add a little bit of flour. I didn't roll them on the fork to save time. I would add less nutmeg. As other reviews have said, I would decrease cooking time to 5-7 minutes and double the sage in the butter sauce. I sauteed delicata squash with onions and added them to the gnocchi right before serving.

I'm glad I did not read many of the negative reviews of this recipe before trying it because I might have hesitated. This is definitely not a beginner recipe, but it is worth all of the time and effort. Yes, your hands will be a sticky, floury mess after rolling and shaping the gnocchi, but after tasting the first bite of nutty, brown butter fried sage goodness I knew fall had arrived. I boiled for the full 15-17 minutes and the gnocchi were perfect. Served with a big salad and glazed carrots. This recipe is a winner!

We followed others' suggestions and they worked perfectly! FREEZE for an hour before cooking. Boil only about 5-7 minutes. Do two batches of brown butter and gnocchi instead of all in one. And DOUBLE the sage at the end. We made those slight changes and the gnocchi were divine! This is not a beginner recipe but the results were worth the effort!

I thought it was very lovely. I also did the potato and the squash a day before and then threw it all together tonight. The flavors are pure fall and yes, it IS rich, but with a large salad and a dry glass of sauvignon blanc, it was really delicious.

Time consuming- is it worth the effort for a side dish? But very tasty! I was worried about the stickiness of the dough. Was not able to roll it out properly but ended up gently rolling out small balls then making indentations with a fork. I put them in the freezer as previous reviewers recommended. They held shape and cooked perfectly (about 13-14 minutes at a boil). Added extra sage.

After reading the reviews, I had doubts about this recipe. I made the entire menu for a birthday dinner. I followed the instructions as written, except after forming the gnocchi, I froze one hour instead of chilling. My dough was a little sticky, as the recipe states it should be, but not impossibly so. The flavors and texture were exactly what I imagined and hoped they would be. The gnocchi and the veal were favorites, though everything was liked. I can't wait to make this again; possibly a double batch. Don't be dissuaded if you are an experienced cook it should be well worth your time.

I have to say, I was super excited to try this recipe, but as most of you I was not exactly "happy" with the turn out. The dough was way too sticky, and adding too much flour (our first batch) made it impossible to work with. Gnocchi does take a lot of time, so I wasn't worried about that - but I think the key is to cook AS MUCH liquid out of the squash and to also add less than a cup to the cooked potato mixture. I think this recipe just needs some personal tweaking. But I do agree the gnocchi set up better with at least an hour resting in the fridge.

This is not for beginners. The dough is not easy to handle and it takes awhile (like the first tray) to get the hang of the rolling on the fork and shaping. Do not overwork the dough--and add the amount of flour needed, it could be more or less. I had no need to cook the puree because mine was already thick. I also simmered the gnocchi in water the full 15 minutes without a problem. Do not skip the chilling for an hour step before cooking. I just thought the brown butters sauce was just so so, a little too rich. I will probably do a light cream sauce with sage and parmesan for the other half that I froze.

I did not have the issues with the recipe the other reviews seemed to, but I also broke the prep time up and made the squash & potatoes the night before and then refrigerated them. I also froze the gnocchi instead of just chilling for the 1 hour asked. The 15 minute cooking time was fine, otherwise the gnocchi was gooey in the middle and undercooked. The sage butter browned them up nicely. Very rich and probably better off as a side, but absolutely wonderful.

Boil the gnocchi for 15-17 minutes??? Seems like typo to me as all the other gnocchi recipes I have compared say 1-2 minutes. Despite this, I followed this reipe to the letter, made the dough perfectly, rolled the dough, shaped, chilled them, etc., and sure enough, after about 5 minutes of boling, they dissolved into a big cloudy saucepan of nothing. What a waste. Labor intensive, for sure, and doubt the the cooking time is correct.

Yummy dish, but definitely time-consuming. I actually didn't end up using all of the flour called for in the recipe... They got a bit sticky at the very end when I was heating them with the brown butter--I should have just given them about 1 minute with the butter instead of 3 or so. I might decrease the nutmeg a bit if I make them again, and I actually might because I have a bunch of extra squash puree (I started with a much bigger squash than 1 lb).

Took many hours to make, must say had lots of family fun rolling the gnocchi BUT it was a sticky doughy mess when cooked. Tried to firm it up a bit when cooking in the butter and sage. Tasted good, but too labour intensive for less than 'sensational'. Would not make again.

I spent several hours making this. The mixture remained impossibly sticky, and even with the addition of far more flour than was recommended, I ended up having to wash my hands and utensils constantly to remove the "dough" so I could function. I did not detect any squash or parmesan flavor by the time the gnocchi cooked, and they ended up looking and tasting like oversized, misshapen spaetzle. I'm hoping the butter and sage and lots more parmesan will retrieve them from the status of just barely edible. So disappointed!

This Gnocchi has a great flavor, though it is very labor intensive. I found that I had to add quite alot of extra flour to make it workable. When boiling it, keep the second batch in the fridge (the humidity made it sticky) and add more water in between batches.
