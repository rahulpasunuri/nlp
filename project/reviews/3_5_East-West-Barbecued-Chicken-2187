This is the only barbecued chicken I'll make now. It's exceptional!

Love this recipe -- chicken stayed moist on the grill (used breast only, skin on) and had a lot of kick. Great with Malbec.

This was an easy and delicious way to do BBQ chicken, and I'll use the chili/hoisin sauce by itself as a shortcut in the future. However, I wouldn't agree with baked potato and garlic bread to accompany this; we did rice and grilled veggies including yellow zucchini and baby bok choy which turned out great with some of the sauce brushed over during cooking.

We've made this dish several times for dinner parties and everyone loves it. The acid in the orange juice must tenderize the chicken because it turns out tender and juicy! You can add or cut back on the spicyness too.

I'd make this dish again with some changes. A little too much vinegar to suit our tastes, but it was easy and worth trying again.

I agree with previous reviewers that the marinade did not stand out. However, I tried it with lamb and elk and it seemed to tame the stronger flavor of these meats. The sauce is also great without the marinade. I have taken marinaded meat and the sauce to several BBQ's and everyone loves it. I always take extra sauce so others can use it.

Fast, easy, and the chicken stayed very moist (I used drumsticks only), but I wouldn't make it again--no flavor came through other than the spiciness. Still, not bad.

Simple and tasty but not unique. I didn't think that the marinade flavor came through the sauce. The sauce was easy and good and can be used as a quick BBQ suace with any meats. It might be interesting to try the marinated chicken without the sauce and see if the flavors stand out.

9/11/00 Tried this on the grill last night. Everyone loved it, however, did not really taste the hoisin suace. Will need to use more next time.

Yum, Yum, the barbecue sauce was delicious. I'm going to try it on ribs next!

We barbecue often, so I am always looking for something a little different. If you double the recipe, do not do the same for the chili-sauce as there is plenty to go around. This is nice for something quick and easy.

We discovered that we do not like hoisin sauce, at least the brand I purchased. So we skipped the barbecue sauce. The marinade was very good!
