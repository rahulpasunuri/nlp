Quick easy and tasty. Not as good as a long slow simmer chili but good for a quick weeknight dinner.

I found this chili to be too mild and too tomato-ey. Skipping the tomato sauce may have helped.

We followed the directions to a 'T' but found out we like to kick it up a notch. We added 1/2t. of Tabasco Sauce and we will have this every Thanksgiving week-end from now on. Thanks, Don...

I would definitely recommend this dish it was easy and fast. The only thing that worried me was the call for"Chili Powder with masa flour" because I had a hard time finding this at the market. I substituted one packet of McCormick Chili Seasoning and it turned out delicious. Also, I would cut down the turkey to 3 cups of cooked turkey, it was a bit too much turkey. Good Luck!
