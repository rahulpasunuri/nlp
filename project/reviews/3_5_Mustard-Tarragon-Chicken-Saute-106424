Followed the recipe with small exception of using lemon pepper for seasoning the chicken. This was simple, quick, and very tasty....great for a weekday meal. Mustard and tarragon make a great marriage.

Great, easy weeknight recipe. I used leeks instead of shallots and doubled the sauce recipe. Served with sour cream and chive mashed potatoes.

This dish was so easy and flavorful it will definately become a weekday standard. in the time it takes to cook rice this dish can be prepared along with a salad and steamed vegatable. Even my finicky 12 year old son liked the flavor.

This tasted ok to me, but was a little bitter. I used regular dry white table wine instead of vermouth and my bunch of tarragon had larger leaves than I am used to seeing so I think this may have contributed to the bitterness. Its still work trying the recipe, just not one of my favorites.

I don't know what makes this recipe so amazng, but it is. I am not a huge fan of tarragon, so I used about half, I let the chicken set for about 10 min before serving and my husband ate every morsel without one word of complaint - he almost ALWAYS complains when we have chicken. The flavors meld wonderfully, the sauce is addicting and I'm glad I made extra - this is a keeper. I used thighs because thats what I had and added baby bella shrooms tasted even better for lunch today

Delicious, bistro-style chicken dish. Don't substitute ingredients, especially the vermouth - it won't taste like the same recipe!

Sauce is a little strong, but very creamy and delicious. The vermouth is key.

Truly exceptional..easy enough for impromptu and has gotten rave reviews at my table for years. I agree with the cook from New Zealand: I switched to Bianco from the Dry Vermouth, and even add a tiny pinch of sugar sometimes..the bare hint of sweetness works with the tarragon to counter-balance the mustard and vermouth.

Very simple and fast preparation and cooking. It uses minimal ingredients, yet each goes with the other perfectly. Very tasty. I used chunks of chicken and served it with campanile shaped pasta. The sauce clung to the shape, and it was not at all dry. I would like to experiment with what to serve with this dish--the pasta was ok, but not great. I wonder if wild rice mix or white rice would be better than the pasta?

Excellent flavor, and very easy. Good paired with nutted rice pilaf or lemon fettucine. Even faster if made with chicken tenders instead of chicken breasts.

This was a hit with our dinner guests. Easy to make and keeps warm so you can cook it ahead. I think I would halve the breasts next time. I added extra mustard,chopped tarragon, vermouth and cream for more sauce.

Quick and absolutely delicious! My only change was substituting one of the tablespoons of whole grain mustard with country dijon mustard to make the sauce a little creamier. Be generous with the shallots and tarragon and give them both a coarse chop.

Hmmmm, not sure if I missed something, but this was nothing compared to the reviews it received. (Did use white wine as other reviewers suggested since we didn't have vermouth so maybe that was the problem...) It was fast, I'll give it that. And we didn't dislike it, but no one was too excited. Won't be making it again.

FABULOUS! I use chicken tenderloins already sliced and skinned instead of breasts. They cook that much faster and more evenly. This has become a staple at our house. I can make it in about 15 minutes so you can't beat it for a weeknight meal. Over wide noodles it's heaven.

I was a bit skeptical after reading the rave reviews and decided to test this recipe. Result....A fabulous dish! It has to be one of the easiest yet TASTIEST recipes I've tried in a very long while. I love that you can pretty much eyeball the amount of ingredients to use based on your taste preferences. Love it with chicken, scallops, shrimp, pork chops, salmon, you name it. I made this dish for my boyfriend and loaded a scoopful of the mustard chicken on top of some creamy mashed potatoes...and voila! Quick, simple and utterly delicioso!

Easy and tasty. The recipe defines a standard cream sauce from which other combinations can be easily tried. Experiment with it and have some fun.

I give this recipe four forks because it is so simple yet so delicious. I chopped up the chicken for quicker cooking and served it over white rice (I only used 2 chicken breasts but the same amount of sauce ingredients, and I was glad to have the extra sauce.) This is a meal that you can make just as easily on a weeknight or for company. I'm sure it would work over pasta or mashed potatoes too. Yum!

A nice twist on a simple French bistro classic. I loved the vermouth! Served this over a flat egg noodle, although mashed potatoes would have worked too. A great way to use the tarragon from the garden before the frost gets it.

I've made this four times and tried something different each time and it still comes great. It's so simple. Instead of the heavy cream I use Land O'Lakes fat free half and half (I follow the South Beach diet) and it works fine. Tonite I'm adding capers and Calamata olives to give it a Puttanesca spin.

This is a great recipe to add to your stockpile because you will almost always have these ingredients on hand. I do serve it with mashed potatoes and you can get away with using dried tarragon over fresh if you have to.

I made this in a very few minutes and thought it was great. I browned the chicken in a pan with non-stick spray instead of butter, used about 1/4 cup of light cream and then about a cup of 1% milk and then reduced to make a thick sauce. I thought it was very good and easy. I will definitely make it again, and am thinking of using the sauce with scallops.

Such a delightful surprise...quick & easy & alot of flavor "bang for your buck". Pounded chix breasts to even 1/2" thickness, used minced yellow onion, & had barely enough fresh tarragon from my spindly plant (at least some fresh herb really makes it). Would make nice casual dinner fare.

Exactly what I needed, an easy, inexpensive, high-flavor dish. 1/2 and 1/2 gives plenty of richness and flavor - and I used regular old dijon, not whole grain. I just eyeballed the ingredients, it is that kind of a dish, making it even easier! Very good for a weeknight (always a challenge)

Fantastic - Made this on a whim, due to an overload of fresh tarragon in the kitchen, and served over Cappelini. Amazing - I couldn't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch, and there were only leftovers because I wanted to extend the experience.

Great quick to fix recipe! The mustard, vermouth and tarragon made a great sauce that we had over mashed potatoes with the chicken. My husband doesn't care for tarragon and he liked this dish alot! I think it was the mustard and vermouth that adjusted the strong tarragon flavor. GREAT!

Rating: 3
I've made this dish several times since I first tried it, and I still haven't tired of it. The vermouth and fresh tarragon are what really make this unique (btw, dried tarragon doesn't work well as a substitute). I usually double the sauce because this is great as a leftover dish with rice pilaf when there's extra sauce. I also cut the chicken breasts up before frying them to speed up the cooking time.

This was incredibly simple and delicious. I had no vermouth so I used dry sherry. Everyone but my daughter liked it. Frankly, if she likes anything I worry about her, so the fact she disliked it only confirms how good it really was.

I made this for my family and they loved it. So quick and easy. I diced the chicken and made a little more sauce and served it over rice. Also I didn't use the amount of cream in the recipe. I instead just used a tablespoon or two for the flavor and just milk and a touch of cornstarch to thicken it. Very good. Fresh tarragon is best if you can get it. I will make this again, soon.

My wife and I loved this recipe. If I could, I'd make it all the time, but it's just so much cream. I cut down on the amount of shallots and used chicken medallions to soak up more of the sauce. The sauce is so spectacular- we were eating it with our bread, brocolli, and potatoes!

I liked it but my family didn't. ( wife, 2 kids 10&11) Similar to many cream sauces I have made & the family has enjoyed, but the tarragon/dijon combination is probably for a more experienced palate. It had kind of a cinnamon flavour? Anyways, that's my opinion

I made this last night for an anniversary party and followed the recipe exactly and it was a hit.

This is really a very tasty and great looking chicken dish. I used 2 pks. of the breast tenders and marsala wine instead of the vermouth.

This was a wonderfully simple, yet elegant dish...worthy for entertaining. I wouldn't change a thing. However, in speaking with other cooks who use tarragon, the freshness/quality of the tarragon makes a difference. The tarragon I bought and used for this dish was quite mild in flavor (older?? or not quite as new as freshly-picked??). I didn't feel that I had used enough; however, others seem to think that they'd cut back on the use of it as it was way too strong! You be the judge!

Great dish especially for a week night. I add some sliced mushrooms to the sauce the 2nd time I made it and liked the flavor with the fresh tarragon. Also to cut the fat I used fat free half and half and then a little bit of a cornstarch slurry to thicken it. Was excellent!

This was good, although with some modifications. There is WAY TOO MUCH shallots in the sauce! I omitted the shallots completely the second time around, and that was much better. I also added some chicken stock and garlic to the sauce which really added to the flavor. Good!

Great if you're looking for something different but quick. Most of the ingredients are something you keep around anyhow, so its easy to whip up. The only thing I would do different would be to use the dried tarragon. Some herbs are better fresh, but I find tarragon seems to have more flavor when its dried, just use about half of what the recipe calls for. Great with roasted asparagus with a drizzle of fresh lemon!

Excellent! However, I knew beforehand that it would be too much tarragon. So, I cut back a bit. I would cut back even further next time and use 1/2 of what the recipe calls for...I'll cut back on the shallots next time too...However, overall, it is excellent and easy!

I love this recipe for a quick meal! I have opted out the cream in favor of skim milk. Doesn't have the same consistancy, but the taste is close. Good choice for all you calorie conscious.

To Oakbrook: By "stringy" when you brown the chicken, I assume that the chicken breasts stick to the pan and shred when you try to turn them. If that is indeed the case it could be one of these reasons: (1) you may not be patting your chicken dry (both sides) before you saute it, it will stick if you don't; (2) you may have your heat up too high -- make sure your heat is medium-high not "full blast" high; or (3) you may be putting the chicken into the pan before the oil or butter is fully heated. Also, if you are already doing the three things I mentioned above, you may be turning the chicken before it is ready to be turned, which will cause it to shred. As it is browning, don't move it or keep turning it over to check on it -- instead try lightly pushing it from the side with your tongs (or whatever utensil you use), when it is browned and ready it will "give" and move easily. Quite simply, if it doesn't "give", it isn't browned or ready to turn -- just be patient until you can move it easily. I hope this helps, good luck!

Made this because it was easy and sounded good. I didn't have cream and used half & half. Also, I used white wine (dry) instead of the vermouth (same quantities). No fresh tarragon either, so I used 1 1/2 teaspoons. It was wonderful! Served the chicken over buttered egg noodles which nicely absorbed the sauce. A great easy but elegant -tasting meal!

Excellent. Based on other reviews, I made double the sauce recipe and used 1 tablespoon of dried tarragon leaves, which we found to be just about right. Also used part olive oil and part unsalted butter for frying the chicken. I think I will try this with boneless chicken thighs next time, as I find thigh meat to be more moist than breast meat.

This was a very easy and tasty dish. My family loved it. I substituted sherry for the vermouth after I realized I was out of it and used dried tarragon at 1/3 the amount of fresh. I added a splash more cream than called for as the whole grain mustard had quite a kick to it and there were kids at the table. It was great. Served it with garlic mashed potatoes, baby peas and maple carrots. Will definitely make again as a quick dinner for guests.

Just made this for my family, and everyone liked it--I will make again. I made it with egg noodles and peas. Used white wine instead of vermouth.

With the changes suggested by many of the readers,this was a tasty, low fat dish which we really enjoyed. I used low fat sour cream instead of cream, used dried (2T) taragon, and olive oil instead of butter. I also grilled the chicken. Very nice and took very little time.

Rating: 1
Well, in trying to keep this dish low fat, I really blew it. I used the fat free half and half and a nonstick pan and it was awful, although it did thicken up nicely. I think the main part of it was the strong tarragon taste, as my husband said, "It's tastes industrial." (whatever that means, but it wasn't a compliment!) No kidding about the tarragon being too overpowering! And, I even cut back on it this time too! Next time, I will try this again as written, only I will vastly cut back on the tarragon, more like down to 1 teaspoon of fresh. Served with mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus.

A nice, easy way to showcase chicken breasts. But you'd better like tarragon -- this much is overpowering. I will cut back next time, or try another herb.

I needed a fast and easy dinner that was both tasty and somewhat elegant. This recipe filled the bill. My adult daughter paid it the highest compliment by taking the leftovers home with her.

Used pork sirloin chops instead of chicken. Since I cook for 2, I made all the sauce the first time with 2 sirloin chops, and reserved 1/2 the sauce for the second time. First time I felt it was just too salty, so I fried the chops in a little olive oil and added extra half and half to the reserved sauce. Second time it was excellent!!! Also, in this town, shallots are in litle packets that equate to $9 per pound. I'm sure red onions would be just as good.

Rating: 3
Very gourmet, very fast! An ideal weeknight dinner. I used half and half and added a little extra plus a little extra vermouth to get some more sauce. Re vermouth, you can get half bottles and it keeps for quite a while in the fridge--it's great to have on hand for cooking. My wine shop recommends Noilly Prat. I think the half bottles I get are $4, in downtown Chicago, which can't have the best prices. Boozinsusan, your comment must have been pulled, but I totally admire anyone who makes ALL of the recipe flash recipes even when they don't all get great ratings. I had a large glass of vermouth with lime and club soda while cooking in your honor!

I like this recipe, but prefer it with these substitutions (which also increases the amount of sauce): olive oil instead of butter; 1/2 cup dry sherry instead of vermouth; increasing the dijon mustard to almost 1/4 cup; and using about 1 cup (8 oz) of creme fraiche instead of the whipping cream. You'll need to simmer it a bit longer than the three minutes indicated in the recipe. My husband also likes sautéed sliced mushrooms added and prefers dried tarragon to fresh (less licorice taste). We serve it over brown rice or couscous. Either version, this is very easy, and very good.

This was easy and terrific - served with mashed red spuds and grilled squash. The flavors are so complimentary that it seems like you've slaved over the sauce.

To me, the cream is a non-issue at only one ounce per portion. If more liquid is needed, probably chicken broth would work, or additional wine, but the finish wouldn't be as special. Every other item on the menu could be low or no-fat to some- what compensate for the cream indulgence.

FOR LOW-FAT FANS: I can give you a low-fat version of this recipe that I have been making for a couple of years. Sprinkle chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken breasts and sauté until cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to platter. Tent with aluminum foil to keep warm. Add 1/3 cup shallots to same skillet and sauté 1 minute. Add 1/2 cup of dry white wine and 1/2 cup of chicken stock in pan over medium heat; reduce until about 4-5 tablespoons are left. Add your 2 tablespoons tarragon, 2 tablespoons grainy dijon mustard and 1 tablespoon honey. Stir for a minute or 2 until thickened on LOW heat and add chicken for 3-4 minutes to coat with sauce. Serve. It's a never-fail receipe that my husband loves!

in lieu of the whipping cream, try using evaporated skim milk-much less fat. You may have to thicken it a little depending on your preference

To the cook from Phoenix AZ, I'm with you. Too high in fat for me although I'm sure it would taste good. I prefer healthier recipes. I'm going to try it with the new non-fat half half. May need to be thickened depending on consistencty you want. I'd also spray a non-stick pan and cut down the butter. Something else that sometimes works as a cream replacement is non-fat evaporated milk, although again the flavor will be different. Doesn't work for everything. To the cook with the vermouth question, it's great to cook with and not expensive. Try it!

I love how this recipe sounds. But, as politically incorrect as this may be, does anyone have any suggestions on reducing the fat...like what to substitute for the whipping cream perhaps? I know, not as yummy but I would love to try this in a lower fat version. Thanks in advance.

To the cook from Delta, BC -- White wine is a fine substitute for vermouth, but before you make the substitution, try the vermouth! You can get those little "airplane" bottles at many liquor stores. Like sherry, vermouth adds a unique flavor, particularly to chicken.

I'm interested in trying this recipe. However, I don't have vermouth, and I can't imagine buying any. What would you suggest substituting for it? Would white wine work?

Yummy--I enjoyed with a rice pilaf and a side of fresh spring asparagus. I added some thigh meat to the saute to add a little more flavor to the sauce, and reduced the mustard a touch.

This was simple to prepare, and my husband and I enjoyed it very much! It was aesthetically pleasing as well.

I have been making this dish long before your recipe came out, and no matter if it is chicken or fish, it's always wonderful and pretty much fool proof. One thing that I do add is a little chicken broth when deglazing the pan with the vermouth. I don't see how anyone could not like this unless you're not crazy about tarragon or if you put too much dijon in it. Go by taste!

I didn't like this recipe at all. The shallots and the mustard made this way too sickening for me. I make a similar version that I like much better than this.

Whipped this recipe up for a quick midweek supper and found it was simply delicious. My husband loved it and was convinced I had spent hours making it. Next time I will definitely make it for guests.I used strips of chicken tenders which worked very well. In the interest of cutting down on fat I used less butter and cream, and I substituted sour cream for whipping cream. A real winner.

Not spectacular, but very easy to make. It's perfect for a quick, easy, satisfying week day meal.
