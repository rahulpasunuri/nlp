I dug this recipe up after not having made it since it was first published. It wasn't quite as flavorful as I remembered - seems to be missing a kick. It also serves well with a simple guacamole (avocado, garlic salt, pepper) - especially for the diabetics!

Excellent flavor. I used spinach dumpling wrappers. Skipped the plum sauce and dipping sauce- still terrific!- but will try them next time.

I made a few changes but I was shocked at how well these went over. I used a full pound of chicken. about a tablespoon of cilantro paste with another half a tbsp dried because it was what was on hand. I didn't have a whole cup of green onions. I used a lot more chili-garlic sauce. I used half thai chili garlic and half sriricha. I didn't have any lemon so I omitted it. I tried out a few different shapes with my egg roll wrappers. Then instead of using the pot I baked them in the oven on 425 for 20 minutes. I had to cover with foil for the last 5 min so the corners of the wrapper wouldn't burn. While they were baking I made a dipping sauce of soy sauce, rice viegar, sesame oil, natural reduced fat peanut butter, plum sauce and hoisin sauce. It was all delicious. I was worried the chicken wouldn't be fully cooked but it was. I hadn't even looked at the mint chili sauce recipe so I don't know how that would have been.

A winner! This turned out delicious the very first time and I´ve made it again and again. I use0 vietnamese rice paper )the one used for springrolls instead of egg roll wrappers. This makes them light and crispy. This is also a very kid friendly recipe if you skip the plum sauce dipping and mint sauce entirely. My kids just go from the pan to the soy sauce dip and that´s it!!! We make a full meal out of these. Oh and they also love to help me make the pockets. Enjoy...

The mint sauce turned out very thin and the mint separated. Anyone else have this happen?

Excellent recipe. We made a few changes of our own... We left out all the sauces and used a soy, rice vinegar sauce for dipping. We used only egg whites when it called for eggs - makes it a bit healthier and not so eggy. We also browned the potstickers in a pan, then added some water and steamed them for 6-7 minutes, then browned them again. We froze half the raw filling and made it again the next night. This is definately a keeper recipe

We also had problems with the potstickers being mushy after frying them in the plum/sherry mix, but everyone likes them so much we had to make them again. What we did was cook all the insides together and then filled the wrappers. This way we only had to fry them for a minute or so to crisp them up, not to cook everything. This seemed to work because they went fast.

whilst i did enjoy this dish i have a couple of points. a potsticker is called such as it should be cooked in a hot frying pan then you add a laddle of water to this and cover with alid for about 3-5 mins. when you remove the lid the potsticker should resemble a dumpling on top and be stuck to the base of the pan, this will be very crispy, and stuck, thus potsticker. you will get better results by making a water paste. 200g 'oo' flour 35 ml olive oil 105 ml water salt. blend all the above and allow to rest. roll out thinly, cut into circles, fill and seal with water not egg. crimp the dumplings like little pasties. try it!!

I made these dumplings last night for guests,& they were delicious,except the mint-chili sauce is too overpowering,a simple dipping sauce made with soy sauce grated ginger & a little chili flakes was enough.I made both & after trying each everyone preferred the latter.I also baked these on a cookie sheet sprayed with PAM in an oven @ 400 degrees for 10 minutes & they came out great,a little golden as if fried without the fat,I then tossed them in the plum sauce until just coated & they were so pretty they glistened.Also steamed some in a bamboo dumpling steamer;they were good but more delicate, so more difficult to toss in plum sauce & harder to pickup with chopsticks which makes it a little akward for guests.Every one preferred the baked ones & they disappeared quickly.I would definitely make these again,with the modifications stated above.

I fried these and steamed these...hands down the steamed ones were better! i will definitely tweak the seasoning more next time...maybe add cabage too...

Wow! What great flavor. My kids absolutely LOVE potstickers and after having these told me they were better than their favorite restaurant's version! (My kids are 7 and 4!) As others suggested, I skipped the plum sauce step and the mint-chili sauce. Instead, I made a dipping sauce with soy, diijon mustard, honey sesame oil, and ginger. My husband thinks these would be really great for an appetizer for one of our dinner parties, but suggested that I make them a lot smaller for that purpose.

the potstickers were great without the sauce. i didn't even bother making their sauce, instead i made my own soy sauce with vinegar and chili sauce. it was delicious! i will definitely make it again when i'm entertaining.

I love this recipe just as it is! I followed it closely because so many reviewers omitted the plum sauce step and skipped the mint-chili sauce I wanted to try the real thing as printed. The plum sauce step did not make mine soggy but rather gave them a sweet sticky glaze which I thought was good and different from a typical potsticker. The way the wrappers fold over in a triangular shape is very fun and looks good after you practice your technique a little. The mint chili sauce was fantastic and very flavorful and pretty. The potstickers are so flavorful themselves that it is hard to tell where the flavors are coming from but all the flavors together make this a very exciting recipe. I can't say enough good things about this site in helping to find GREAT recipes!

This recipe would be four forks if it wasn't for the plum sauce step -- it makes them too soggy. I would go with the recommendations of the reviewers who suggest browning them and steaming them with a few tablespoons of water. The filling is absolutely delicious!

I made this for a dinner party this weekend. It was delicious and a big hit. I followed the recipe closely for the potstickers but made my own dipping sauce instead of the mint-chili sauce.

I make these for dinner parties and always receive generous compliments. I'm Chinese, and while these are not entirely authentic (made with thin wonton wraps), they are irresistible and disappear quickly. Of note, the premade wrappers are a significant time saver. The chicken is suprisingly tasty, but I use other dipping sauces.

I've now made this several times with a few variations; ground turkey instead of chicken, a bit less ginger and cilantro, added 1 Tbsp. dry sherry to the filling. I use wonton wraps too, but use a biscuit cutter to cut rounds out of them. I also don't cook them in the plum sauce, just make them the classic potsticker way (brown, then add a few tablespoons water and steam until cooked - then usually let them crisp up a bit again and flip to brown the other side) and use plum sauce and soy sauce as dips, rather than the mint-chili. These are a big hit in our house!

I enjoyed making and eating these potstickers! I used regular wonton wrappers (the small kind), which yielded about 40. I ate them without the mint-chili sauce, and they were still flavorful and delicious. The main thing I would change is cutting down the amount of ginger a little.

These are wonderful but WORK! I substituted tofu for chicken and chinese cabbage for spinach and they were delicious. I didn't brown them like the recipe suggested but instead steamed them in a steamer. Not something simple that you can throw together at the last minute but well worth the effort if you have the time. I used won-ton wrappers and it yielded 40 potstickers. The flavors gel very well together.

I needed potstickers to go with the spicy vegetable recipe in the Williams-Sonoma catalogue. I used this one, substituting tofu for chicken, and sweet sherry for dry sherry (had it on hand), and adding portobello mushrooms, then blending the filling for smoothness. The kitchen was a mess when I finished but the potstickers were scrumptious, and visually pleasing.

healthy filling but you can also use round dumpling wrappers found in chinese groceries and wrap them in crescent shapes and pan fry them in a little oil and when both sides are golden brown, add about 2 tbsps of water, simmer and cover for a few minutes until water evaporates and presto! you got some authentic chinese pot stickers! Dip them in soy sauce, vinegar, ginger, sugar and chili mix and use chopsticks to pick them up. Delicioso!

Served these gooey, delicious potstickers at a party and they soon disappeared- amid moans of pleasure. If you've never made dumplings from egg roll wraps before, you might want to practice your technique on a few 'dummy' potstickers first.

Fun to make and eat. I love to spend time cooking, but if the process is long and tricky, it should be equally rewarding. This falls a bit short for me.
