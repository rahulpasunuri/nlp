Oh this dish is so good don't be ashsamed to use the Knorr demi glace to make your life easier (no body's gonna know)-we live in the real world with real world time frames. This reciepe is Ga - ron -tee delicious.

Since I used a substitution for the demi-glace (a cheat of beef base and red wine), I can't fairly "fork" this, but I am going to guess that the demiglace is too much for this dish and can be omitted entirely.

Delicious is the verdict from my teenage foodie critics. Since I tend to read a recipe and go by memory afterwards....I missed the oregano, guess it didn't make that much a difference to the end result. YUM!

We found this recipe to be extremely flavorful. The sauce was wonderful, just not enough!I don't understand other reviews stating that this was bland. My suggestion would be to use a better grade of Marsala and for sure to use veal demiglace.That makes all the difference in the flavor!

Rating: 1
Agree with previous posts that this was bland. The Cook's Illustrated recipe for veal marsala is much better -- using dried porcini mushrooms and sauce reduction for intense flavor. I wish I had found that recipe first.

This was really really good. My fiancee raved about it the day after! Drizzle some reduced balsamic vinegar over the top to finish the dish.

Very bland - needs more flavor from herbs or a heftier Marsala than I used.

Bland, bland, bland, this should be popping your taste buds, instead it has little flavor, made just as instructed, used veal demi-glace, just bland,would not make again....

A real keeper of a recipe! We followed the recipe, with one exception. We used fresh thyme instead of dried (an oops moment mid recipe, go heavier on the thyme) ... turned out great. Veal was served over egg noodles ... worked very nicely. I agree with other reviewers, make extra sauce! No leftovers ... :-)

I'm sorry...but just not a good Marsala. Very boring...my search continues...

I prepared this exactly according to the instructions--which few people do. It was great, and I used a high quality demi-glace. I paired it with a simple spinach salad with thinly sliced red onion and a viniagrette. A good Chianti and rustic Italian bread brought it all together. My only complaint--it is pretty expensive to make, veal was $20/lb at Whole Foods. Add up all the ingredients and wine and we could have gone out for the same price. Nonetheless a great dinner at home and will make again. Next time I may add a Tbsp or two of tomato paste along with several types of mushrooms for an interesting twist.

I didn't have demi-glace so used beef base (Better than Bouillion brand) with 1T. flour and 1/2 cup water. Cut down some of the calories and was still great.

Rating: 3
Good and easy recipe. I reduced 1 cup of veal stock to 1/2 cup and reduced 3 cups beef broth to about 1/2 cup. The result was great. There was an overall sweetness to the sauce. I added a medium minced shallot to the saute mixture. I would prefer thicker sauce. We had .85 pounds of veal (3 scallops) for the 2 of us and we only ate 2. One approximately 4" x 9" scallopini is enough for 1 person. I served this with egg noodles and a simple salad.

this is basically a good recipe BUT the additional herbs merely complicate it. parsley is fine as a garnish. the other reviewers are right that the veal must be fresh and of good quality. however you're still going to have to flatten it more. it must be paper thin. i generally start with the mushrooms as stated but, after setting them aside, use the same pan and remaining sauce to cook the dredged veal (adding butter as necessary). when the whole batch of veal has been browned, i add the mushrooms and turn the heat to high. then i pour over DRY marsala until it thickens to a glaze. i like to accompany this with cottage fries and either fresh asparagus or spinachi alla griglia...

This goes together much faster than 45 min. It's quick and tasty. I used Costo's scallopini veal, which was quite tender. The secret to tender veal is a short cook time, no more than 1 1/2 minute per side at high heat. I also used homemade demi-glace and served the veal over linguine. Actually I like Emeril's veal marsala a little better than this recipe, though both are exceptional.

Rating: 4
Great recipe. All my guests raved about it. I added some dried figs that I marinated in Marsala for a few hours. I also added about a 1/2 cup of heavy cream. I used dry Marsala instead of sweet. I agree with some of the other reviews, make extra sauce!

Rating: 4
The quality of the veal is key. Used a mixture of 4 different mushrooms (sliced) for depth of flavor. Used a dry Marsala as I am not fond of sweet with meat. Will look for "homemade" frozen demiglace (from Central Market) next time (wasn't 100% pleased with Wms. Sonoma veal demiglace). Worked easily for a mid- week meal. Delicious!

A great recipe. The quality of the outcome is contingent upon having great veal. Without it... good luck. I say this from experience. I had some nice veal and was planning on making this dish for my husband and me. There is a gourmet (and very expensive) grocery store in our area. My husband told me that we were having two additional guests and he picked up some extra veal at that particular store to accomodate our extra guests. I made it all together and it was obvious which pieces were from which grocery store. They were all good, but the expensive veal was outstanding! The outstanding veal was $26 per pound. The decent veal was $14. I may stick to having veal in restaurants, but I would certainly use this recipe to make chicken marsala.

Rating: 4
Excellent! Make sure your pan is HOT, but not smoking, so that the veal browns slightly. Also make sure the veal is dry, if it is wet, the flour will turn to mush on top of the veal slice. I used simmered (1/2 reduced) beef base from "Better Than Bouillon" in the jar, with a touch of brandy added. Better recipe than most restaurants. Keep the pasta light or use garlic mashed potatoes.

Rating: 2
I had a little trouble getting the sauce right for this dish, and I served it with penne which was probably a mistake. The mushrooms, not the veal, are what really gives this its character, so I recommend finding some fun mushrooms (luckily my local farmer's market has a great shroom guy).

Excellent recipe. I was feeding a crowd and adjusted the recipe accordingly with great success. I agree that using more sauce is important. I poured the marsala/demi-glace/mushroom sauce onto a big bowl of pasta and put the meat on top. I used pork tenderloin instead of veal and used a wide variety of mushrooms (shiitake etc). It got rave reviews from everyone.

This was excellent! I didn't change a thing and eventhough I am not a great cook it turned out amazing. My husband gave me the best compliment, stating that it tasted like something we'd order at our favourite gourmet restaurant.

Haven't made this one, but in response to "rupostal", the demi IS the sauce, so yes, one cup is appropriate for 4 servings, especially over pasta.

I have a question. I am planning on making this very soon. 1 cup of demi-glace seems like a LOT. Is this a typo, perhaps?

Easy and delicious. As ever with meat this thin, err on the side of caution--do not overcook! I added the spices to the flour before dipping the veal rather than putting them on first.

I really enjoyed this dish and so did my family. It was very simpe to make and thereis alot of room for change on this one.

As a transplant from Chicago where Provimi veal is readily available, I've learned to adjust by substituting thin boneless pork for the veal. Beat it paper thin before sauteing. I do the same thing when preparing Veal (pork) Piccata. By the way, you can't even get demi-glace down here, so I make my own.

The flavor was fabulous and I too would make more Marsala sauce. I make my own demiglace and welcomed the opportunity to use it. My problem was the veal....it is impossible to find good veal in the Santa Barbara area. I would like to give it a try with chicken or turkey, but it would be disappointing to substitute the flavor of the veal. Excellent falvor and I will make this again.

I used my own stock recipe instead of the demiglace, but still, it was as good or better than any restaraunt I've ordered a Marsala sauce dish in. My husband and 3 yr. old son raved, which is no easy feat. Plus, the recipe was far easier than I initially expected. Thank you for getting the evening menu out of ho-hum mode and into oo-la-la.

should have instructions in the recipe for making the demiglace or equivalent

The thyme and oregano overpowered the veal. Lost the flavor of the Marsala. Next time I'll eliminate the veal spices and add more wine. I used the Demi-Glace Gold and as usual, it was perfect.

I loved this dish. However, I have never used the demiglace in the past. I used Aromont, but I didn't know the portion of demiglace to water. I had a hard time getting the right consistancy. Any suggestions?

Made with both veal& chicken, very big hit.I had to print out numerous copies of recipe for the gentlemen at work so they can surprise they're wives as well as I did.

A classy twist, as well as a tasty surprise for your guests - add chunks of lobster meat to the dish, along with a sprinkling of seasoned Italian breadcrumbs.

Make sure you take the pan off the stove before adding the marsala. I was in my usual flurry and had a flaming pan to contend with. The marsala caught fire. My 18 yr old said that he was impressed how I knew how to put the fire out, so I guess that there is a silver cloud in every lining.And it made me slow down a little as well. Make this dish even if you don't have the demi glace. I just used a good quality strained brown gray I had made this weekend. It was delicious. The thyme/oregano adds a lovely flavor. This meal was a major hit with the picky eaters as in the 18 yr. old named above. I'm going to try chicken next time as a less expensive alternative.

I actually haven't made the recipe yet. I wanted to note that on the TV Show, they replaced the veal with turkey and paired it with a Chianti wine. I have trouble pairing wine with food, so I thought this might help others as well as myself. I look forward to trying this one! Thanks to everyone for the recommendations on the demi-glaze.

This was GREAT!! I used boneless, skinless chicken breast and pounded them very thin. I also added the salt, pepper, thyme & oregano to the flour. Knorrs makes a Demi-Glace that is very good, you just add water. This a keeper. Two thumbs up!

Served with wild mushroom ravioli. Great accompaniment. Would easily make again but increase the volume of marsala sauce, or reduce it less.

I substitute chicken breast for veal - one half breast per serving which i flatten with a mallet. This recipe is all about the sauce and it's fantastic. In my opinion, the demi-glace is a must and I have been happy with 'More than Gourmet' as a source for such complex sauces and stocks ... definately worth a try for the serious cook. I also use a variety of fresh 'shrooms and add a chopped shallot with the garlic. I can't give this a 4-star because its too simple ... but it is an easy to prepair tasty main coarse. A keeper recipe for me !

I did not have veal so substituted chicken and chicken stock for the demiglaze. This is fabulous, now I don't have to get it in a restaurant, I can make it at home and my husband loves it.

I am not a big fan of veal, so I substituted chicken and found the recipe delightful! I've made it 5 or 6 times and even once for a large dinner party. It's always a hit! Especially with nice, fresh mushrooms!! My only suggestion is to make sure there is plenty of marsla sauce!

Although this was different than the typical Veal Marsala recipe I have used in the past, we all thought it was quite good. I do think using demi glaze is essential. Will definitely save it and make again!

This was good, but I've made better. I had to thicken the sauce with a flour water mixture. (I used my own homemade veal stock instead of the demiglace.) The best veal marsala recipe I've made is, believe or not, Emeril Lagasse's. Do a search on his website and you'll find it, it really is beyond compare.

I added some dried tarragon to the herbs. This is a wonderful dish.
