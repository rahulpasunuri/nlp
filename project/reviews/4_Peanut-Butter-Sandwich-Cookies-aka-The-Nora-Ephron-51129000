I had set the bar pretty high when I saw the Dalia Bakery connection as that bakery rocks. But,.... loved 'em but still gave 3.5 as they weren't the best thing EVER which I save the full stars for. Will consider eliminating or reducing butter from filling as 3 cubes of butter for not a ton of cookies is obscene and saved for 4+star desserts. If I eliminate butter I would increase honey and p. sugar a bit to hold it together. Won't use skippy as it has shortening/h. fat in it...but Adams worked great. Amazing how perfectly round they baked. Also think the "base" cookie would be fun to play with for other recipes by eliminating filling entirely. For example, putting peanut butter chips (T. Joes has them, W.Foods too) in them would be really good.

Haven't made this yet but based on the reviews it seems I must. I think I will change it up a little by making the dough, rolling into small balls big enough for my mini muffin pan, bake, then sink a Reese's mini peanut butter cup inside as soon as they come out of the oven. Once cool I will make the filling, put it in a piping bag fitted with a star tip, and pipe on top of the cookie. Maybe even garnish with a little chocolate jimmies or shaved chocolate. Yeah, can't see them hanging around long that way either!

I just made these and I cannot get over how amazing they are! I'm normally my worst critic too when it comes to baking new recipes but this is absolutely the best peanut butter cookie, EVER! I wondered if anyone had any suggestions on the best way to store these, I was thinking in the fridge (due to the soft texture of the filling) but bring to room temp before eating? If they last that long... :)

These cookies are delicious! Really, more of a 3.5 star. The filling is light and creamy. I used smooth peanut butter for the dough instead of natural chunky since I didn't have any in the cupboard However, the batter is very soft (perhaps my butter was too melted) so I have a couple recommendations. I'd put the cookie dough in the fridge between switching out batches in order to firm up the dough. Secondly, a tablespoon per cookie is WAY too large. I think this type of cookie should be smaller and more delicate. Having such a large cookie sandwich looses some of the appeal and makes it 'super-sized'. Will keep in rotation and update.

absolutely the best peanut butter cookie I have ever had. It takes time but is very very worth it.

These are to die for! I followed the oz weights because I could see the gram weights were not all correct. I had to take them to work so hubby and I wouldn't eat them all. Worth the work for sure.

beatrix is absolutely right. One ounce equals 28.3g. Sometimes the math is right and sometimes it isn't. I'm going to assume the oz. weight is more accurate since it was the first unit provided. These reviews, especially the "cream" questions, were very entertaining. I'll come back and rate once I make them with the ounce weights.

this recipe confused me a bit since 6 tablespoons of butter does not weigh 168 grams, and 1.5 cups of flour does not weigh 227 grams (a full stick of butter=113g, and a cup of AP will be 120~125g). I wasn't sure which set of measurements to follow -- did anyone else have this problem?

These cookies are what I imagine Nutter Butters will taste like in heaven. I followed the recipe to the letter, and they turned out perfectly. I used a 1-oz. scoop, and, unlike the previous reviewer, I found it to be exactly correct. I ended up with 47 perfect 1-oz scoops (I guess all the licking of fingers along the way caused me to lose 1 scoopful). I was worried the cookies would be too sweet (the batter was, to my taste), but, once baked, they were just right--slightly under-sweet to balance the sweeter filling. I had to bake for 15-16 mins to achieve "evenly golden." The cooled cookies are crispy and chewy at the same time. (Must be all the butter. I calculated that each sandwich with filling contains 1 oz of butter!) I have a 2-teaspoon scoop, which I used for the filling. The 1-oz scoop would be way too much, even if underfilled, since 1 oz = 2 Tbs = 6 tsp. Now I have to finish baking the final trays. The baking process does take forever...

As noted on another review, a 1 ounce scoop is way too big. No way will you get 48 cookies! If using a 1 oz. scoop fill no more than 3/4. Also, ever tried whisking peanut butter? Mix the filling ingredients thoroughly first with a wooden spoon and THEN whisk until shiny. End result still delicious but directions are far from accurate.

This is not a review...yet. I just want to add a few kind words to Cook from Canmore. Perhaps this cook has not done much baking yet and is still learning terminology. We do come to this site to learn, don't we? And perhaps the English language has a few confusing quirks here and there. To "cream" butter and sugar is to beat them together until the mixture is fluffy. If you click on the "video" tab above, you'll be taken to a demo of the technique. There is also a technique called "reverse creaming" demonstrated by the Cooks Illustrated crew for their luscious New York Crumb Cake. Happy baking! Now, on to those great looking cookies to pay homage to the wonderful Nora!

It means to cream the ingredients together, not add cream

Rating: 0
Cream is not an ingredient but a method. You "cream" together the butter or any other fat and sugar.

Rating: 0
Cream as a verb, not a noun. It's often what one does with butter and sugar when preparing to bake.

Cook from Canmore: You're kidding, right?

Step 3 says to add sugars and cream, there is no cream listed in the ingredients....

OMG are these ever good. They are totally worth the time to make them. I think my cookies were slightly larger than they should have been and I have since purchased a cookie scoop. They are light and buttery, creamy and crunchy. Hands down - THE BEST peanut butter cookie EVER!!
