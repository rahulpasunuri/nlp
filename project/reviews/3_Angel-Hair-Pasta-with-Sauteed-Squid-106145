Amazing recipe. My picky husband said it is the best seafood pasta he had ever tried. I am looking forward to having lunch with whatever is left of this dish tomorrow.

I am not rating this recipe but the previous review and I give it four forks for originality. By the way, Patsy would eat anything - remember her comment about that fashionable restaurant in London : "anything with a pulse is lunch !" Furthermore, I couldn't picture Pats and Eds eating chicken livers either.

Oh the preparation. I gave myself 2 hours to do this but slowpoke that I am, I took almost three. What I despise the most is cleaning squid, but once you get past that its all easy. But to be fair, I wish I wouldn't set aside my lazy Sunday afternoons for trying out epicurious recipes anymore. They look so great on paper but seem so mediocre when its in my plate. This dish was great but a) I would have preferred using chicken livers or smoked sausage instead of squid. I am not a huge fan of squid but in this recipe it sucked. Sorry, just had to say that. For all the attention it got, it should have tasted better. b) I love olive oil and Italian recipes, but I would rate spaghetti over angel hair pasta anyday. Its like eating worms that have half-decomposed. No offence to the worm community but they're not the most attractive creatures on a dinner plate. c) Don't sautee the squid - FRY it. Get rid of that horrid, vomit inducing raw taste that permeates the entire dish. God, if I ever served this to Patsy and Edina from 'Absolutely Fabulous' they would throw me out the window and reach for the nearest bottle of wine. Thats near similar to what I did, darlings. Skip this one. Or if you HAVE to make it, add your own special touches alright?
