I loved the taste of the cumin seed and I thought the dough needed more salt or maybe I'll serve next time with salted butter. These are beautiful - way better than the picture in the magazine. I made these Thanksgiving Day and they aren't that difficut because the work is split up. Enlist a helper for the last part divide, dip and tie in knots. I didn't have a helper but I made them sloppily and they looked great anyway.

This dinner roll recipe has become a tradition every holiday and the "good thing" is you can make the dough the day before so, you have more time for the main coarse.
