I think the key is that the carrots should be good to start with. The bagged "baby" carrots I used the second time around were tough and tasteless to begin with, and while roasting brings out the sweetness of vegetables, there wasn't much sweetness to bring out here, so the balsamic ended up too tart. The first time I made this it must have tasted better, because I wouldn't have tried it a second time if it hadn't. I'm not sure I'll try a third, because think I prefer braising them in butter, anyway.

This is one of those wonderfully simple recipes where the freshness and quality of your ingredients can shine through. I used carrots purchased at my the local farmers market and a good quality, aged balsamic vinegar and added just a pinch of thyme. I made it for a pot luck dinner and it was perfect. It was quick and simple to make on a week night. It re-heated nicely in the microwave. Everyone asked me for the recipe and no one could believe how simple it was.

Add some walnuts with the balsamic at the end. Perfect light lunch or side.

The better the balsamic vinegar the better the carrots. My picky 12 year old (who is not, by choice, a veggie eater) loves these.

The balsamic didn't caramelize well, and the carrots were not as tender as I would have liked. Would have preferred to make balsamic reduction on the stove top and pour over the carrots.

With carrots from our CSA this was a wonderful recipe. I used my convection oven and loved the way they turned out. Followed the time and temp instructions and all was well. The addition of the balsamic darkened the overall color, but not in a bad way, and the dish was delicious! Definitely a keeper!

I added a few tablespoons of fresh mint to the finished dish. This one is definitely a keeper.

Didn't love this one. I prefer roasted carrots with olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper.

The carrots came out wonderfully, with a nice, mellow balsamic flavor. I also added a little dijon mustard and honey to mellow the tang of the vinegar, but it probably would have been equally tasty without them - the basic flavors are a great combination. My mother-in-law can't have any salt in her diet, and this was a great, flavorful side dish in which I could leave out the salt, and no one missed it.

Great recipe. I don't follow the measurements too well, but roast with olive oil and sprinkle with balsamic and roast a little more. Everyone loves them and asks for the recipe. If you can't taste the balsamic, see the doctor, maybe your taste buds have gone bad!

I do not understand the negative reviews of this recipe. The oven temperature and roasting time are correct. The carrots were nicely caramelized and the balsamic vinegar balanced the sweetness of the carrots. I do recommend using less olive oil. I lightly sprayed the carrots with olive oil.

Very easy and quick to make and a great tangy flavour. Would definitely make this dish again. I used baby carrots and cooked them for 45 minutes at 350.

The carrots came out BLACK!! And it wasn't from the balsamic vinegar. The temp should be 400 degrees, and about half the time. (And my oven is set correctly, too)

I made this exactly as the recipe and thought it was great. The carrots were sweet and the vinegar gave it a slighty tangy taste. I used a 10yr aged balsamic.

The carrots were well received at my dinner but nobody was awed by them. Still, they are very easy to make so I'll probably make them again.

I loved this dish. . .but probably wouldn't have if not for other cook's comments. I made carrot and parsnip sticks and after putting them in a roasting pan I added olive oil, salt, pepper and nutmeg. After 30 minutes I added a mixture of balsamic vinegar, mustard, and sugar. I brought these to a Thanksgiving party and they were excellent! The hose even kept some back so she'd have some to serve her house guest the following night. One complaint: Why don't you give temperatures in Celsius as well as Farenheit? The internet is international, after all!

Indeed, not very exciting. Try blanching carrots a tad and adding fresh mint.

I roasted the carrots in the oven while I was making Pork tenderloin, so the oven was higher than 425F and so I left the carrots in there longer than I meant to, so they kinda got singed. But they looked and tasted like sweet potato fries and were really good to my surprise. Next time though I will stick to a 425F oven.

Very simple and tasty. Nothing to write home about, but certainly a good preparation for carrots. I added a little frech oregano before serving, and I think the suggestion to add some black pepper is probably good.

:) This is my favorite way to cook vegies. Never thought of carrots, though. The only thing I do is add freshly ground pepper before popping into the oven. And I don't bother measuring any more. Just eyeball it! And baby carrots make great appetizers!

I rated this (3) forks the first time, and the second time I must rate it (4). I used a quality rice-wine vinegar, and it waw over the top. One must understand, this is a relatively simple vegetable dish - we're not talking gourmet preperation here, and in it should be judged in that context. It is easy and delicious as a side to most main entrees. Everyone loved them, and I will keep this in my collection.

I too have made this several times and I agree with A Cook from Fort Worth: this is a starter recipe to play with. I also added black pepper and thyme (great minds thinks alike!) and found it added a nice depth. The balsamic is sweet enough so no additional sugars are necessary as some cooks have suggested. (Which is curious since Balsamic is a very sweet vinegar to start with) Well, whatever. To each his own. In the end, this is a good 'basic' recipe to experiment with. And I think, imho, is what recipes are all about. They give you the basics and then you adapt them to your tastes/opinions/etc. Which, now that I think of it, kinda makes this forum worthless? Just kidding. Well, sort of. Anyhoo, it's a good recipe and one that can be adapted to many different tastes. 'nuff said.

Have made this 3 times now. First time as stated was fine but just a little boring. Second time I added fresh ground black pepper and crumbled some dry basil over all. Better. 3 time also added some thyme. Best yet. Great starter recipe to play with if you like roasted carrots

Made the recipe as is, and like some of you, found it to be lacking something. Made it a second time, but sprinkled some sugar over the potatos and added a bit of honey. The result was much better the second time around. The sweetness was a nice counterpart to the balsamic.

I made this New Years Eve to accompany Rack of Lamb and Gruyere Potatoes! I thought it was easy and very tasty. I used a really good Balsamic Vinegar that I have for special occassions and it was great! Although a very good Balsamic Vinegar could probably make anything taste great!

I received a great bottle of artisan balsamico for Christmas, which I am almost afraid to use, but I will for this recipe. Balsamico rocks! Hint: if using a commercial, widely-available balsamic, adding a bit of brown sugar to the vinegar can help make it taste more true.

I, too, made this dish for Christmas dinner. I was so easy to prepare--I used baby carrots and parsnips- and fit in the oven with along side the rest of the grub! I couldn't believe how sweet the vegetables were--like candy! I think the trick is to use good quality balsamic vinegar and to cook until crisp and brown! Yummy! A definite keeper recipe!

I made this for Christmas dinner and everyone loved them. I used the peeled carrots used for salads. I also used a good quality exta virgin olive oil and a good balsamic vinegar, but not the really good stuff.I did these in a large saute pan.I added about 2tsp. sugar while browning the carrots to help give them a deep caramel browning. I finished with kosher salt,fresh black pepper, and chopped italian parsley.

Easy. I expected the vinegar to be overpowering, but it wasn't. The roasting takes the punch out of the vinegar, and the carrots have a mellow and earthy flavor.

Rating: 4
As in all Italian recipes, the trick is to use the highest quality and freshest ingredients available. To those of you that thought the recipe had a "vinegary" taste or was banal, try using a better quality Balsamico. As a note of cultural interest, high quality Balsamico vinegar is considered to be such a precious commodity here in Italy, during World War 2 when the Americans were bombing the area, the people saved their highest quality bottles Balsamic vinegar instead of their gold jewelry, because they knew their higher quality bottles represented a greater equity. Even today, there are bottles of Balsamic vinegar that sell for $200.00 (NOT NECESSARY to use in this recipe!). However, if you do a recipe as simple as this one, you HAVE to use good ingredients because there're not enough ingredients to mask inferiority.

If, like me, you like your carrots to be properly roasted instead of soft & floppy, you definitely need to cook these in a big pan. The balsamic vinegar can be a bit overpowering after a few bites, so in future I would make this with a contrasting side dish to dilute the effect.

I loved this dish. I added parsnip (cut in sticks also) and fresh thyme. It was totally easy to prepare, as we were roasting a pork tenderloin along side. Some came out crispy, some came out tender--what more can you ask for?

I do all the cooking in our house. My wife decided to surprise me by making me dinner, and, since she doesn't cook, she felt she needed to check out recipes on this site. This was the side dish to chicken breasts with pablano's and cream. She halved the carrots and added a celeriac, which I love, and based on reviews, added an onion cut into wedges. A salad and some purchased bread rounded out the menu. She still doesn't want to learn how to cook, but she was so proud, and deservedly so! The whole menu took about 45 minutes, since I already had some roasted poblanos from the night before in a jar in the fridge. Easy and delicious as a menu, and the carrots were both easy and perfectly balanced as a sweet and savory side dish.

I had to laugh upon seeing this, as all summer long while grilling mushrooms, onions, and red peppers in a balsamic vinegar mixture, my husband always insisted on throwing in some baby carrots. I chided him about grilled carrots, but he is now vindicated. They are delicious.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner. The recipe was so simple it was easy to "slip in" while all the other dishes were being prepared. I, too, served them at room temperature.

Was looking for a new way to prepare carrots (I typically braise them in apple juice or steam them) so I tried this. It was okay ... simple enough and a nice accompaniment to roasted chicken breast. Didn't knock my socks off.

To the cook from peoria, I cook items like this and serve at room temperature. On Thankgiving I cook an abundance of vegetable (at least 8-12 types) with different techniques which would be impossible if I tried to serve them all right off the fire.

I've been preparing carrots like this for a long time. Usually, I include red onion and sometimes slices from a bulb of fennel. Probably use more olive oil than is recommended here! And, yes, of course using organic carrots is best...

I have used this with carrots, sweet potatoes, red potatoes and onion quarters, in various combinations. Guests tend to hang around the platter, eating "just a few" before the meal is served. With a yogurt or sour cream dip, the roasted vegetables make a good appetizer. The Balsamic vinegar can be replaced with rosemary or other fresh herbs.
