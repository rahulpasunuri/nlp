instead of 2T sugar I used 1 and added a chopped carrot, chopped apple for added sweetness. Also added a chopped onion. It came out good but I had to cook it more than recipe called for

I used rice vinegar because I didn't have cider vinegar, and the substitution worked out. The dish was a little on the plain side. Using plenty of fresh ground pepper perked it up so much that I'm wondering what a little Asian Fire Oil might do.
