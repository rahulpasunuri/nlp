If you follow the recipe exactly, you will certainly be disappointed. However, try what I did, replace warm water with beef broth, add 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, 1/2 finely chopped onion(drain all liquid),1 clove garlic finely chopped and 1 teaspoon dried oregano. It wasn't quite as airy but much more flavorful.

I will not make this dish ever again! Not only was it extremely time consuming, but its taste was very bland and not worth any minute that was spent cooking it.
