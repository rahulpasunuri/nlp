I was gifted the print version of this recipe, so I've been making this for years. It is my favourite cheesecake recipe. That said, I usually skip the fussy crust and crumble some lady fingers with a bit of rum to moisten them into the bottom and up the sides of the pan. For those of you who love rum and raisins I recommend soaking 3/4 cup of raisins in rum and then sprinkling them on top of the cheesecake before baking, with a bit of brown sugar. Also, this is very good with a blueberry sauce instead of strawberries.

I really don't like cheesecakes; a long time ago I had one on a whim that turned out to be more creamy and not stiff and dry like all the ones I had growing up (sorry, Mom!). This is such a cheesecake; the lemon peel and rum add their respective notes, and the minted strawberries put it over the top, especially if you're in strawberry season and can get them locally! I brought it to our opening of Don Giovanni as a Spanish-themed dessert for our principal singers; one of them first refuse it due to their diet, then I cajoled them into having one bite, their eyes got wide, and then they proceeded to dive into it. I love it when that happens.

This cheesecake was great, light and wonderful as everybody mentioned, with just a slight hint of rum flavour there to remind you that there's rum in it. The lemon is a little stronger than I expected, but it was still delicious. Very light, very easy to eat, very delicious!

This is a wonderful "light" cheesecake...not the heavy bowling-ball-in-your-stomach type cheesecake. We loved it. Very creamy and flavorful. Especially declicious with the fresh strawberry compote. A real winner. I made it with a graham cracker crust.

This recipe was very easy for first timers, such as myself. It was rich and creamy, like traditional cheesecake, but the rum gave it a special twist. I substituted coconut milk for the cream and lime for the vanilla and lemon to give a tropical flavour. It tasted great, even without the compote.

More of a flan than a cheesecake, not bad, but not great.

Wow, my first attempt at baking cheesecake and it turned out sooo yummy-delish!! The lemon and rum balance nicely, not too sweet, and the lemon peel in the filling provides a more satisfying texture. I was very pleased, indeed.
