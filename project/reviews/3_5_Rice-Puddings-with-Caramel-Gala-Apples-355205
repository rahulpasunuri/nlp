Very good! The only complaint I can make is too much liquid. Both the rice and the caramel apples had too much liquid. Next time I will try it with less milk/cider. All in all, very good!

To chanel11 from Australia The recipe calls for "Apple Cider" - not cider vinegar. Apple cider is a type of apple juice that we have here in the USA in the fall months. If you cannot get apple cider there, perhaps you could substitute apple juice purchased from your local supermarket. It is no wonder you did not like this recipe if you used vinegar in place of juice. My family really enjoyed this dessert and I will be making it again and again.

This was great, but yes, do make sure you brown the sugar for the apples or else you will have soup.

I have a love affair with rice pudding. Thankfully I live in NYC and Rice to Riches has fulfilled that. Unfortunately I like to know that I can make things myself as I'm a purist in many ways. I've tried several rice pudding recipes and none compare to this. I followed the directions thru and thru and the end result was mere perfection. I also added golden raisins and cinnamon to it and skipped the caramel apples. The trick to a nice creamy pudding is leaving alot of the liquid in as the pudding cools.

This was fabulous! I've made rice pudding (a more basic version) before and I said then what I say now -- it is definitely time consuming! Thank heavens for my stellar calphalon pan! Really, you need to stir A LOT in the later stages of cooking the rice with the milk. I think I actually cooked it a little too long. I sort of forgot that once you chill it, it hardens just a little bit. Anyway, it was still delicious. Next time, I may put a cinnamon stick in with the rice/milk as it's cooking. That's what I did last time & it was delicious. I did end up sprinkling some cinnamon on everything at the end. Highly recommended, but takes a little time.

I made this recipe the week we received the magazine and my husband is still raving about it. It may not be to everyone's taste but if you like rice pudding you will love it. To the cook from Australia, no wonder you weren't thrilled when you substituted vinegar for the cider!

The cider vinegar ruined the apples for me, it was all I could taste. My rice also took ages to reduce down and I found it more grainy than creamy. Didn't really like it.

I thought this was exceptional rice pudding. As several reviewers mentioned, it takes a good 15 to 20 minutes longer than recipe says to cook rice pudding -- a total of 50-55 minutes. Likewise, it it takes a minute or two more to caramelize the sugar (about 5 total), and a couple extra minutes (about 4 total) to thicken the sauce after the cream is added. I recommend using an oversized pot to cook the rice pudding because it can heat up and spill over very quickly if you are not paying attention. Only changes I made were I used Fuji apples, vanilla bean paste and added a bit of cinnamon to the apples. If you layer it in parfait or martini glasses it is very presentable. Great make- ahead dessert. Next time I will double the recipe.

I used Macintosh apples instead of Gala because that's what's local and cheap, and the very tart flavor was delicious with the creamy rice pudding. I followed the recipe to the T and it came out perfectly- the medium heat did not burn the milk (you have to stir fairly often), and it cooked in the correct amount of time. My husband and I loved it.

Really enjoyed this one. Just sweet enough but not too sweet, and very creamy. Instead of using the apples as a sauce, I just mixed them right into the pudding, and I thought the flavors really melded nicely. I doubled the recipe (I always double dessert recipes!) and it did take forever to thicken to the right consistency, about 90 minutes for the doubled quantity on a low heat. I had no problem with the caramel, but it is really important to let the caramel cook longer than you think you need to so that it really does caramelize the apples and not just end up soupy like other reviewers have described. Also, I had no cider on hand so I used a cream sherry instead! All in all a great comfort dessert. Not a "wow your guests" type of dish, but perfect for the family.

The first time around, I made the caramel apples without letting the sugar caramelize properly, and wound up with a pale, beige-colored soup of apples. I strained them and tried again, this time letting the sugar deepen in color, and results were SO much better. Rice pudding took nearly 20 minutes longer than the recipe suggested to thicken according to my taste, but I also had the burner on quite low so as not to burn the rice. Only used 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract. The final product got rave reviews from my boyfriend and his friends, but another friend was turned off by the lack of eye appeal. As such, this dish is not recommended for entertaining, but is definitely a great, comforting dessert for a cool evening. Next time I might put out a 'buffet' of brown sugar, cinnamon, and raisins.

Extremely bland and flat. Rice and apples were not a good mixture. Edible but totally nondescript.

I thought this was just about perfect as a comforting fall dessert. Loved the caramel apples and thought they were great with the yummy rice pudding. The pudding did take longer than the recipe suggested, but it was well worth it. My 12 year old sisters didn't like it at all but the "grown ups" thought it was lovely.

I followed the recipe, but added a little extra lemon juice which added a nice flavor. In the future, I would reduce the amount of sugar in the pudding itself. I shared this with friends who were not "Pudding" types and all loved it.

While basically this is a good recipe, it does need some reworking to make it more successful. I used arborio, but it also took much longer than 35 minutes to cook (more like 50). I didn't like the acidity the lemon juice added and would leave that out next time. I would also boil down the caramel/cider mixture much more before adding the apples; it ended up too watery in the end. All said, my family loved it (I'm much pickier than they are) and I would make it again.

I basically "re-worked" most of this recipe. I substituted the arborio rice with Jasmine rice, and, instead of boiling and discarding the nutritional value of the rice, I cooked it in the microwave. (saving all the good stuff, instead of throwing it down the drain) I also replaced the whole milk with 3 cups of skim milk, and 1 cup of heavy cream. I also added golden raisins to the rice/milk mixture once it was near cooking completion. Sorry, I'm a rice pudding raisin purist. Instead of using the apple cider in the apple mixture, I substituted Calvados which really jazzed up the whole taste. These little "changes" really made this dish Pop in your mouth.

I've never really eaten rice pudding, so I'm not sure how well I can really rate this recipe. However, that being said, I certainly thought that the rice pudding was easy to make and had a great taste. If you're watching calories, this probably isn't the recipe for you. I also made the caramel apples. I don't think that I let the sauce carmelize enough, and so I didn't like the taste of the apples. Also, I didn't really like the combination of the flavors between the caramel apples and the rice pudding. If it were up to me, I'd just eat the rice pudding. By the way, I used arborio rice and ended up cooking the rice/milk mixture about 10 minutes longer to give it the chance to thicken.
