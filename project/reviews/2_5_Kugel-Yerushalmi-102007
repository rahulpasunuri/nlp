Oily and disgusting. I'll never made it again.

This is definitely the worst kugel recipe I've ever attempted to eat or make. I should have known better when it said a) to dissolve the sugar in oil, b) to use that much oil in the first place c) to use so many eggs. I made it according to the recipe, took a bite, and promptly searched for the garbage to spit it out. My flatmate did the same. I quickly altered the recipe before Shabbat to use water instead of oil, and only about half the amount. I also used 4 eggs instead of 6. The kugel is usually made with probably two, but the four gives it a nice, albeit different, texture.

I am shocked by the negative reviews. I made this twice now and both times it has come out EXCELLENT! A different take on the kugel I am used to but delicious!

This tasted like deep fried sugar noodles. I followed the same recipe as these people, but should have known better when it called for so much oil and eggs. Save yourself the heartache and make anything else.

Since it took me a while to figure out that chemicaly, sugar can not dissolve in oil, I had a hard time following the recipe. I gave up on that and cooked the sugar/oil till it carmelized but it was very greasy, and could have used more salt, more pepper too. Many better kugel recipes out there.

A great dish for Shabbat Lunch with Cholent! I made this today in one of those cool silicone pans in a bundt shape. It came out beautifully. I have great memories of this dish from Israel. Easy, tasty and grat to make ahead.

made it the first time last year for a holiday dinner. it tastes different from most traditional kugels. there was a hint of sweetness and an intriguing texture with a crunch on top and chewiness in the middle. it was very easy to make and perhaps a little too easy to overcook or even burn. great way to fill up before the yom kippur fast.
