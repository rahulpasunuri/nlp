Used the recommended grains, chopped dates and dried cranberries. Omitted the butter and sugar (wasn't missed) and threw it all into the slowcooker with 8 cups water on low for 8 hours. Love the fibre content, and after dividing into 8 portions (little ziplocks) love the ease and quickness of nuking in the morning. I like mine topped with greek yogurt and my daughter likes hers with almond milk.

Really tasty and as others have mentioned, there's no need to add the butter or brown sugar really...One reviewer said she would freeze it but didn't say how that turned out. I'll try as well b/c this dish makes a LOT. I wish I had used my crockpot for this and make it overnight. Definitely worth making.

Very tasty! I subbed in a dark rice for the bulgur, and a smaller amount of coconut oil for the butter, to keep the recipe plant-based. Glad to find a way to use barley and to use up random little amounts of grains in the house.

Keeper. Delicious. Low fat. Full of fibre. Cooks beautifully in my rice cooker (I just dump, program to cook on "porridge setting" and go to bed). Infinitely variable (I've subbed in chinese black rice for the bulgur, for example). Nukes well when I take my breakfast to work on weekdays... So, really, what's not to love?

Made as written. Good but not great. Sigh. I'd still rather have good steel cut oatmeal.

This has become a family favorite--but with some easier adjustments. I eliminated the fruit (to be added later). The night before, I place all the grains and rice in a crockpot, add 8 cups of water and salt. Cooking it on low overnight results in perfect cereal first thing in the morning. Serve with an assortment of dried fruits, brown sugar or any other favorite topping. YUMMY!!!

Following another reviewer's suggestions, I eliminated the brown sugar and used only 1 Tbsp. of butter in the mix. The cereal is very good and hearty with a subtle sweetness from the dried fruit. I divvied it up and froze some portions... we'll see how they like being defrosted.

I love this recipe! Healthy, quick to grab in the morning and go, nutty and delicious. I used others' recommendations about the sweetness and only added a little brown sugar. This is a fantastic recipe!

I ate - and our most gracious hostess cooked - this delicious recipe. Great mixture of textures and normally savory grains served sweet. A wonderful breakfast for a large group, served with milk and maple syrup to pour over, fruit and yogurt to eat alongside.

Delicious! A very nice combination of flavors, and the best part is that you can make a batch last all week.

I have been making this recipe every fall and winter since it was published. It is the best hot "cereal" I have ever had.

This is a great recipe, I don't have a crockery pot, but used my rice steamer instead and left programed it on pouriage. Used a mix of wild rice, buckwheat, 3 different brown rices, steel cut oats and millet and dried cranberries. Also added some vanilla. The recipe inspired me.

WOW! This must be the best porridge on the PLANET! It doesn't reheat quite as well as when you eat it fresh but is still very, very good. I didn't change a thing and I'll definitely make it again and again.

Nice and chewy and nutty. A little too sweet. Next time I'll leave out the brown sugar, and let people add it to their taste.

This recipe is great! To make it easier, instead of baking in the oven, I dumped everything into a crock pot and cooked it overnight on low. I was worried it might be too mushy, but the grains retain a nice bite, especially the barley. When I eat the leftovers, I add sliced banana, milk, and sugar or sweetener and microwave for a couple of minutes. The bananas really help to mellow the heartiness of the grains. Very satisfying and a nice change from regular oatmeal.

I altered this a little. I didn't have bulgur, so I used wheat berries instead. I also added walnuts, and after tasting the finished product straight from the oven, added more cinnamon, some nutmeg, and honey. We all loved it. I also used dried pears instead of raisins, as I was out of raisins, too. It lends itself to infinite variation...change the fruit, use molasses or maple syrup or barley malt syrup. I'll keep this in my recipe box. Very satisfying.

Delicious! I didn't put in the brown sugar and it was sweet enough for me. The raisins baking with the grains impart sweetness to the dish. I also did not butter the baking dish and used only 1 tablespoon of butter instead of 3. Make this ahead and you have a healthy breakfast in a hurry.

A great breakfast dish for the coldest days of a Canadian winter! I make this every January -- it brings back childhood memories of hot cereal at breakfast before setting off to walk to school.
