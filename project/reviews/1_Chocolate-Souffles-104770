Sadly, this recipe was quite a disappointment. I followed it to the letter and the souffle came out...well I can't put this nicely...terrible. The recipe simply did not call for enough sugar. Perhaps it would be fine if you added more sugar to the mix but I am not willing to mess around with the proportions when I can use a recipe that already has the proper amount of sugar represented. I do feel that the choice of chocolate was an excellent one. Caraibe is one of my favorites.
