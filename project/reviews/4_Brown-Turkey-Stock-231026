This makes a wonderful stock. I did make a few modifications. I used the roasting method but roasted at 450. I also added 1 head of garlic, sliced in half around the equator, to the veggies. I also added a few sprigs of fresh thyme to the broth. This will be my "go to" recipe in the future. It makes amazing gravy.

Add about a cup of Madeira wine while roasting in the oven! Yummy

I have made this stock every Thanksgiving for years. I use the roasting option for the turkey parts and vegetables because browining on the stovetop is messy. This stock is wonderful, particularly in the Rich Turkey Gravy recipe on this site.

This stock is nothing short of phenomenal. I have been making it for years. As noted in other reviews it makes a wonderful gravy. It also adds a richness and so much flavor to my cornbread dressing (as we call it in the South.) I also inject this into the breast of my turkey before cooking. I make this on the Monday before Thanksgiving. I also make 1 1/2 batches as this leaves me some to use with the inevitable leftovers. It is absolutely worth the time and effort involved!

This stock is absolutely wonderful! I chose to roast the meat and veggies in the oven. I put the pan in and let it preheat with the oven, then throw the turkey in skin side down. When I roast the veggies I let them get almost burnt in some places. This makes for a darker stock. The only changes that I made were to add 5 cloves of garlic and all of the celery leaves from the celery bunch to the broth. I used this stock with the "Herbed Turkey Two Ways" from the Nov. 2010 Food and Wine in lieu of their stock recipe last year and had the most phenomenal turkey and gravy ever. I don't think my children will let me stop making this stock or that turkey recipe EVER!

This advance work makes the best turkey gravy ever! I always brown the meat and veggies I use to make stock. It really brings out the flavor and makes a richer stock with a nice color. Do this and your turkey gravy will never be wimpy and pale again!

Besides the 5 hours it took, this is easy and totally worth the time.

I use this, or one similar every year. Anyone know why this one can be chilled T class and the Nov '08 one says only chill 2? (freeze if longer).

I told my daughter that I might not be making this again this year because I was short of time. Her response was, "it's the best and most important part of the dinner!" So off to the store I go....3rd year in a row. I have to agree, it's indispenable.

I have been making this every Thanksgiving as the base for the best turkey gravy ever. The extra effort to roast the turkey parts more than pays off in a rich stock that also enriches my stuffing.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and I am here again making it for this year. I truly feel this is the secret to an unforgettable gravy.

I made this stock one week before Thanksgiving and froze it. I made sure to brown the turkey parts to a deep mahogany. It made the the most marvelous gravy. I am going to make it even earlier next year.
