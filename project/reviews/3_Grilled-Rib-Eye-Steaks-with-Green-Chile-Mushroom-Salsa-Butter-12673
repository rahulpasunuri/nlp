Made this dish as part of a larger experimental dinner. I agree that the rub is too salty. However, the dish as a whole with the salsa butter is wonderful. I modified by using top sirloin. Next time I would definitely cut the salt, but having said that, I have every intention of using up the balance of the rub. In fact, all my guests took home a bag.

The rub is WAY too salty - and I only used 1 cup of salt. I made this for a dnner party and no-one finished it.

I did have a hard time finding the chiles but when I did I bought a bunch. This rub lasts a long time and my best friend always asks for the steak whenever she comes for dinner.

I didn't care for this recipe at all. I found the rub had to much salt and the salsa wasn't what I was expecting. It just didn't have the pazazz I was looking for.

the rub had a great flavor, but was really salty. i would decrease the salt a bit next time. i had trouble finding fresh chipotle peppers so i used some out of the can.
