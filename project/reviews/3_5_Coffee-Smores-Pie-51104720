Absolutely decadent and delicious. My only suggestion is to make more meringue with proportionally less sugar- I used 3 egg whites and a scant 1.5c sugar. I also added an additional 2oz very dark chocolate for a fudgier texture. Make sure your coffee/cream is still steaming hot when you add it to the chocolate so everything melts completely: re-heat the cream if necessary. This recipe will be perfect for finger-food tarts at my next potluck :)

made as a tart instead of a pie. the crust was delicious. the coffee ganache was a nice change of pace. doubled the amount of meringue as was suggested in earlier reviews---and was glad I did. there were no left-overs, and many requests for the recipe. will definitely be making this again.

Very rich desert, but so tasty for a chocolate lover like me - I was good with a small portion. I used the meringue from this recipe as it actually has marshmallow in it - http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Sweet-Potato-Pie-with-Marshmallow-Meringue-240425. I also used hazelnut flavored coffee to compliment the Nutella. Yum!

The flavor and texture of this pie are excellent. I forgot the butter in the chocolate portion so it would have probably been even better. I also think there is not enough meringue so I added another egg white. The crust with the crushed chocolate, graham crackers and Nutella are like a candy bar and would be a terrific topping on their own. The pie is extremely rich so small portions would work best.

AMAZING! I should have done what another cook recommended and doubled the meringue, but it was still delicious. This is my new go-to dessert - it was a huge hit at a 4th of July bbq!

This was a huge hit! It's very easy to make, especially on a hot day. I doubled the egg whites and sugar for the meringue. I doubt that two egg whites would be enough. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and will definitely make it again.

The chocolate portion of this pie is too intense. Can't hardly taste the graham cracker portion, and there isn't enough "marshmallow" topping.
