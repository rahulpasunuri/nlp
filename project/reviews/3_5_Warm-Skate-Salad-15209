No tomato in the house so I used a nice orange and a citrus-type vinaigrette. A nice change from my usual panko-breaded pan frying of this delicious fish. A big hit with my conservative partner.

This dish is amazing - just like Le Bernadin in NYC! The court bouillon is key.

I haven't made this recipe yet, but it sounds delicious and you can bet that I'll dig it up next time I come across skate at the fishmarket!
