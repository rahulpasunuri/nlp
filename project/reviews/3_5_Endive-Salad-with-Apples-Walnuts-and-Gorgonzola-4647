Valentine's Dinner second course. SIMPLE to pull together. My husband and I enjoyed the salad very much. We will be having this again! Thank you Rancho Pinot Grill, Bon Appetit and Epicurious for sharing!

Great salad -- crunchy, creamy, sweet, tangy, and nutty. We served it at Thanksgiving and it was a bright, fresh counterpoint to the rest of the rich foods served.

I used mixed greens that i had on hand, gorgonzola, and rapsberries. Very easy, quick, and delicious!

Unfortunately, this recipe did not meet my expectations! Although this was quite a mixture of various, unique flavors, I thought that they would have blended better. There was something a really bitter in this salad, and that is what I disliked.

After I had thrown into the salad bowl the endive, arugula, and apples, I decided to taste it. Thank goodness. I realized that even when paired with my favorite ingredient in the world (i.e. arugula), raw Belgian endive is still horrifically unpalatable. (Sorry endive-lovers, just my personal taste.) I picked it all out, finished making the salad, and then thought it was wonderful! I guess it turned into an Arugula Salad with Apples, Walnuts, and Gorgonzola. Very flavorful and colorful. As always, I omitted all the oil from the dressing because I think it tastes better that way.

Made this a couple weeks ago and came back to make it again. Couldn't believe the previous Canton reviewer's comments!!! This is flavorful and crunchy and sweet and wonderful. I am absolutely clueless as to why you could think it is blah. Fabulous, classic tastes together.

This salad is blah. The dressing has no taste whatsoever. Lots of salads are better than this one. Don't waste your time.

This was excellent! Very similiar to salad served at a very fine restaurant that we visit often. Guests said that it was the best salad they had ever had at a person's house!

This is easy and presents nicely, not to mention that it tastes great. Next time, I'm going to try a creamier cheese...mine was too dry and crumbly. Maybe also some dried cranberries or raisins...?

Totally delicious. I served it for Mothers Day lunch for 12 people, and all went back for more. I left out the apple because my main dish had Pears in it.

Absolutely delectible! We loved this salad. I will definitely make this often especially when I am entertaining. It looks as great as it tastes!

This was a delicious salad. In lieu of the gorgonzola cheese I used a leftover slice of cheese that was a sharp cheddar layered with gorgonzola. The combination of the two cheeses was a nice compliment to the salad. Next time I make the salad I will substitute a different fruit, probably pears. I loved the apples but like to experiment a bit.

I can't wait to make this salad again for more people I know! I recently used it for a dinner party I catered, and people kept coming back to snitch additional bites! The salad has great flavor balance.

This is a great salad. I've also used rasberry vineagar with great success. Yum!

Delicious althought I modified the dressing by substituting seasoned rice vinegar for the sherry vinegar and I added some honey. I served the salad on a bed of mixed baby greens.
