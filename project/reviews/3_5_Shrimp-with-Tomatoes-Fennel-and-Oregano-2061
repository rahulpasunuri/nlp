excellent, even without the fennel, which we didn't have. served with rice, and wished we had made more sauce!

This is a deceptively simple dish. I think the amount of hot pepper may be a misprint; 3/4 tsp was fine. It gave a nice warmth without searing. I made this in March, when tomatoes are sad, but it didn't seem to matter. Used a large fennel and a very large onion and a lot less feta, maybe a quarter cup. I also halved the oil for the vegetables and served it with penne. It was terrific! My husband decided to have more instead of dessert. This is company worthy.

This dish is wonderfully simple and incredibly tasty. I happen to like the heat, but for my family I would reduce the red pepper by half or so because it's pretty spicy. Otherwise, the flavors blend together beautifully and it's really easy to make.

Watch out for that red pepper! I added the recommended amount and it was WAY too hot. I'd make it again with 1/4 tbsp of red peppers and I bet it would be great.

Definitely tasty...don't skimp on the feta because it balances out the tartness. I added more than 1 Tbsp oregano and think it could have used more. Served atop brown rice.

This is delicious even with canned tomatoes. I used only 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes and it was still pretty spicy. Also added some strips of fresh red pepper with the fennel. A great easy meal.

Actually, I would give this a 3 and 1/2 -- because of its simplicity as well as taste. I did cut the red pepper flakes to 3/4 teaspoon rather than 3/4 tablespoon and the olive oil to 4 Tablespoons.

This dish is fantastic and very easy to put together! The key here is to use fresh garden tomatoes (I combined several varieties of heirloom tomatoes) and don't overcook the shrimp. Based on the previous review I cut the red pepper down to 1 teaspoon (3/4 Tbsp. seemed like a lot to me too) and it was mild. I think you could easily add more hot pepper to it according to taste. If you're counting calories I think you could cut back on the olive oil a bit with good results. A new favorite!

I can't believe that no one else found this recipe scaldingly spicy! I cut the red pepper in half, and we still found it to be on the border of being inedible! I can't imagine what would have happened had I used the full recommended amount. I am going to try this recipe again, and cut down even more on the red pepper---then I expect it will be a 3- or 4-fork recipe. Except for the mouth-burning, it was delicious.
