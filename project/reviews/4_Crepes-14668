I used cheap Trade Joes Lager and they came out great. Didn't taste like beer at all. My kids loved them and said they tasted like fried dough. They ate a few plain, then we filled the rest with a spinach feta filling. Came out great, and not even one complaint about eating spinach!

I made these crepes today using Heineken for bananas and Nutella. It was wonderful. My crepes did not taste like beer, they were great. I would definitely make them again.

They came out well in terms of texture and thickness but the beer taste was not quite right. I used a lager with salty crepes. I cannot imagine using this for sweet crepes as the beer was a little much even with the salty. I have tried other good crepe recipes that are more traditional and will stick with those.

Great recipe. I've used it for savory and sweet crepes and have been completely satisfied. The beer has to be chosen to match the use of the crepe is all.

We live in Germany so we know crepes! I have made them since I was a kid as I am Czech; for years I followed my grandmothers recipe. Sadly, this recipe is better than grandmothers! My husband and son LOVE these crepes. I make the batter the night before and let it "ferment" on the counter to produce a tarter crepe and enrich the flavors. I agree with the other comment - WOW, diet coke? How fast food-ish!

Love this simple Recipe. Note, Beers come in many flavors. Dark, Light, Hoppy, Bitter etc. Think about that when you choose a beer for this recipe. For those who don't like beer taste choose a weeker tasting beer. One more thing, Beer is nothing like Diet Coke. Don't even go there.

Loved this recipe, but I couldn't envision the beer with smoked fish. So I just substituted club soda instead.

For a dessert crepe, I suggest substituting champagne for the beer.

Guys! This is a SAVORY crepe recipe! Of course it's going to have a mild "yeasty" taste. The Italians make 'crespelle' using active yeast. Perhaps those of your with complaints of too much "beeriness" we attempting to use this delicious recipe for a dessert crepe.

i acutally use diet coke instead of the beer. It adds just the right amount of fizziness and vanilla flavor, which is perfect if using these crepes for a dessert filling.

I love this crepe recipe! A year ago our family went to Amsterdam and had dinner twice at the Pancake Bakery. Is a great base to recreate the pancakes we had on our trip. We use carmelized onions, gruyere cheese, mushrooms and ham or bacon. Put all of the ingredients in the skillet then pour a thin layer of the crepe batter on top and flip once. They are fantastic and quick! Use the left over crepe batter for grilled or pan fried bananas and nutella or pan fried apples with a little sugar and cinnamon for dessert. It makes a wonderful meal.

This was my first time for crepes and thought they were really great. I used spelt wheat, and a bottle-conditioned IPA for the beer, then olive oil, coconut oil instead of butter for the pan. Just trying to think of things to combine with it at this point, but I'm sticking to these proporitons.

good basic crepe recipe. I used good quality hefeweisen and the result was not as overwhelmingly "beer" flavored as if using a stout or the like. I added chives. very tasty and tender.

I LOVE IT! Crepes are a great meal, side dish, or even snack at anytime of the day! Crepes go way back in my family, and we are German so we call them Balachingas. Crepes can be enjoyed with any of your favorite foods on top! Crepes can also be a great low-fat & meatless food, just add fruit jelly and low-fat cottage cheese, then roll them up like a taco. Then enjoy them with a cup of fruit on the side for a snack or light meal! ENJOY!!

Everyone seemed to like this recipe but me! Despite early inclinations to alter the recipe, I followed it to the "t" but it tasted too beery. I added sugar and lemon juice to try to recover the ingredients but ended up throwing it out. My husband, who loves pancakes of all kinds, did not like it either. Maybe less beer?

This is the crepe recipe I have been searching for. I used an 8-inch pan and 1/4 cup of batter and produced a few more crepes. I froze the extra ones between wax paper sheets and simply thawed them in the microwave. I would recommend this as the perfect crepe recipe.

This batter was very light and fluffy. The beer gave it a depth of flavour that added to the batter in a positive way. We added a pat of butter in a heavy pan, sprinkled some sugar, put the crepe on top. We doused the crepe with 1oz of Grand Marnier, then flambe'd it. It was superb!

I've never done crepes before and this was a terrific and easy recipe. My guests gobbled this one down!

my first time making crepes and i used this recipe. this makes a great basic batter that is very easy to work with...accidently made some too thick and even these were still flexible. i found that letting the edges brown before that first flip is the key to not breaking them.
