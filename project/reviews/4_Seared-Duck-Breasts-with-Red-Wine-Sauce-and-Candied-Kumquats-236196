For once, I made a recipe according to directions. OK, almost. (I added a liberal dose of salt to the sauce since my homemade stock is unsalted, but I don't think that counts). The sauce was quite nice (I did give it extra time to reduce and thicken), and the kumquats added a lot of sweet-tart punch to the mix. A good solid recipe, but not quite 4 stars. It might be worth making again with a different wine to see if that ups the ante. On the other hand, I have a bunch of delicious kumquat syrup leftover...I'm thinking I'll reduce it and use it to replace simple syrup in some cocktails. I have the feeling something great could be in the making...

This was amazing! I followed the recipe almost exactly but my duck breasts were smaller. It's a lot of last minute cooking but well worth it. The candied kumquats were delicious and so easy to make. Can't wait to try it again.

This dish was absolutely amazing. The sauce is completely dependent on wine selection but even using a mediocre wine it turned out wonderful.

this is a fantastic way to do duck. I eagerly await kumquat season just so I can make this. It is truly a show stopper

This was terrific! I used candied orange peel since kumquats were not available. I probably reduced the sauce more than needed but it was delicious.

I have served this recipe both to my husband, and then to dinner guests. Every time it receives rave reviews! We live in the Bahamas so exotic ingredients such as kumquats are hard to come by, so last time we substituted good quality marmalade, which worked really well. I agree, the sauce takes forever to reduce but the whole effect is well worth the wait!

I can only speak to the sauce with kumquats (which is really the essence of this recipe anyway) as my local market was out of duck and I had to go with boneless lamb loins. The sauce actually really worked well with lamb, so if you have no luck at the supermarket with duck, don't despair! This sauce is really great. The candied kumquats really are nothing more than garnish -- the raison d'etre of the kumquats are to get that taste into this outrageously bold wine sauce. What a delight! Will make again and again.

Really delicious! This was my first time making duck and it turned out beautifully. (The sauce does take forever to reduce, though - I was glad that I read the reviews.) I was unable to get kumquats where I live, so I substituted physilis (cape gooseberries) instead. They still have that tart, citrusy, flavor but have more of a woodsy quality. I would definitly make this recipe again (in fact, my husband has requested it). Also, I served it with bulgur pilaf - very basic and a great success.

Elegant and delicious! The red wine sauce needs more reduction time, as mentioned in another review. It is a perfect balance of tart and savory. Definitely try-one of the best duck recipes I've found! Enjoy!
