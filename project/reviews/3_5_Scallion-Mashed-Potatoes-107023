I substituted skim milk for the whole, and I think that was my mistake. These were bland and boring.

I am 11, and this was a pretty easy recipe for me! It was good, but the parsley is kind of chewy, so I suggest that you use just a little less. But my family liked it! (my dad suggested vinigar, but it sounds gross)

Hmmm... It's good, but I think this recipe is missing something. Perhaps heavy cream instead of whole milk to make it creamier. Maybe some more butter...

This recipe has become one of my standards now. Yukon potatoes are a must.

I made a modified version of this for dinner last night and we really liked it. I had to use what I had on hand: 1# potatoes; 1/2 cup chopped scallions; no parsley; FF sour cream for the milk - excellent flavor.

These were great and easy - parm adds a great flavor.

These were really very good! More flavorful than I thought they would be. Cannot wait to do again.
