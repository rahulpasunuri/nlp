I made these for a party last night, using left over mushroom risotto. My first time deep frying anything, so I was a bit worried. But they were very easy to make, and more importantly, they were delicious! I finished them in the oven as well, but I found that made them less crispy. Perhaps something I did wrong? However, I think next time (and there will definitely be a next time), I'll just make them smaller and skip the oven.

I made these for a wine tasting party, and they were a hit. I used leftover roasted cherry tomato risotto and mozzarella. I think next time, I'll use a more flavorful cheese, or no cheese at all. Panko was definitely key for the breading. As suggested, I also finished them in the oven.

I made this with leftover truffle risotto. Any risotto will do. It is a very good recipe - I made ahead for a party and reheated in the oven when the guests arrived. I agree with others that the panko flakes are best.

FANTASTIC appetizer at a party. I omitted the mushrooms for my picky guests, and they went so fast! Truly delicious, simple, fun, appealing recipe that can be adjusted any way you like.

Fantastic. We lived in Rome for four months and discovered "suppli" (which means "wires," since the molten mozzarella is like telephone wires...) This recipe was perfect. I made them with Panko and they turned out light and crispy on the outside, dense and chewy inside. And I bought mozzarella pearls, or curds, which were just the right size for stuffing. For leftovers, reheating them is important...totally agree with SabaNL.

These are awesome, but here are two important tips, from my experience: 1) The mushroom risotto recipe makes a TON! I was doing these as appetizers and had to throw out most of the risotto because there were just too much. Maybe half that recipe if you're planning to use these as such, or for less than 10 people. 2) The way this is written, the cheese didn't melt, and they were kind of luke warm on the inside. After frying I finished them in the oven, 15 mins at 375. This could be just based on the size of the ones that I made, but do a trial one first to see how it cooks.

Definitely a crowd pleaser! I used a pepper jack cheese to give it a little kick and also used Japanese Panko flakes. They make the crust much lighter and crispier. Very good.

These were really good as an appetizer or side dish. I don't use the mozzarella, I thinl it is too bland. Instead I used asiago or manchego. I have made them a few times and the last time I made a batch I froze them to save time. when I was ready to use I just took them out of the freezer a day ahead, just before frying I rolled them in bread crumbs again. The still turned out really delicious.

I love this recipe, it's fun, flexible, and a definite crowd pleaser. I use panko instead of regular breadcrumbs for a lighter, crispier crust. I also experiment with other cheeses like pepper jack & colby for the center, but have yet to find a serious rival for fresh mozzarella. And in a pinch, you can use just about any risotto you happen to have on hand in this recipe and still turn out a winner. What's not to like?!?

My husband said yum, definitely repeat!

Very quick and easy to make. I used a deep fryer instead of pan frying the balls and it worked great. The bread-crumb crust was just like that found at the state fair. These would be great as an appetizer at a party, if made smaller (about 1 inch).

I tried this with leftover butternut squash and blue cheese risotto (the recipe is available on Epicurious too). It was amazing! Don't add the mozarella though...it already has plenty of cheese inside.

This is similar to the rice balls that I grew up with. My mom would make this the next day (she used to add peas and meat not mushrooms),as well as potato crouquettes.

I haven't tried this recipe, but have to comment. When my wife and I went to Italy several years ago, we took a train from France, via Switzerland (but that's another story). When we stopped in Milan to change trains, we hadn't eaten all day, and had very little time. In the station was a stand almost like a deli with all kinds of wonderful looking things. My Italian was (is) essentially zero so I mostly pointed at things that looked good and held up a number of fingers for how many. Everything was good, but most memorable were these rice balls. After we got home we searched high/low for a recipe, couldn't find anything that sounded like what we had until one day looking through a cookbook we already had I found a picture labeled as "croquettes". The recipe was essentially the same as this one, although it has directions for making risotto if you don't have leftover. Fried leftover risotto! That's all it was. Since then Mario and others have made these popular, but back when we had the darnedest time figuring out what it was.

Cut corners by using instant risotto. Still looked and tasted good.

This is a fun one! A local restaurant serves these as an appetizer and my husband always said he just wanted to eat a plate for dinner, so after I made the full risotto recipe for a dinner party, I had plenty left over, the following night I made these and we enjoyed a plate of them with a side salad...a fun, tasty treat.

Restaurant quality! I used and recommend fresh mozzarella. Served with a spicy tomato sauce.

Good recipe, fun to eat, would add 1/2 cup minced fresh Italian parsley to rice before forming balls. That will create a wonderful taste, trust me.My mom used to make this when we were kids.

The risotto was great and it held very well in my fridge for 3 days. The rice balls were very easy to make. If you ejoyed the risotto and you like rice balls then this is a wonderful dish. Enjoy!
