I make this in a 9" non-stick springform pan and after browning the marshmallows I release the collar and slide the pie onto a cake platter. It makes for a really nice presentation - with a few candles it makes a great birthday "cake".

Very good and easy. I used fudge covered graham cookies for the center because I could not find chocolate covered crackers

Though I had read the other reviews, I made the sauce and glad I did. It was good without, but GREAT with it. Also, I could not find chocolate covered graham crackers so used chocolate dipped shortbread cookes with great results. The cookies taste similar and gave a similar texture so may be an alternate (and much cheapter) substitute if you can't find the covered graham crackers. I also used a pre-made crust and saved on time. A wonderful recipe, the family was impressed and did not take too long to make! YUMMY! I definetely will make it again and again during summer.

Very good, extremely happy with the results...a bit of a pain to make unless you've got a lot of room (I happen to live in a small place without ample counters, but managed to make this without too much mess). But quite delicious, not difficult to follow, definitely worth trying. Just make sure if you store it in a freezer that it's level, or the marshmallow spread will start to drip!

YUMMY! I made this for a friends brithday and it was enjoyed by all. I didn't make the sauce, it was sweet enough for me without it.

This pie is fabulous. I don't know why anyone would think otherwise unless they just completely screwed it up!

Holy Moly was this good! I skipped the sauce after reading other reviews and it wasn't missed. I did melt down some milk chocolate chips and drizzled those over the top, refroze, and then warmed under the broiler. Absolutely delicious. Did anyone else make a mess when making this recipe? I guess that's part of the fun. Anyway, everyone raved over this pie at the dinner party.

I have made this several times and is a HUGE hit with kids & adults. Only recommendation is to not put it too close to the broiler - it will catch fire. It is great all year round!

Big hit with kids and adults! Rather than browning the marshmallows under the broiler, I used my mini kitchen torch. Didn't have to worry about the ice cream melting this way. I didn't bother with the sauce - it wasn't missed.

What a desert. So easy and can be made ahead and then brown the marshmallows just prior to serving. This is very rich. I used a premium ice cream and I think it made the difference.

I thought the chocolate sauce was too much. The dessert is fine without it, and the addition of the sauce made it too rich for me. I don't think the chocolate covered graham crackers did all that much for the pie. If I were to make this again, I would maybe add a thin layer of chocolate chips instead of the chocolate covered graham crackers, and omit the sauce.

I made this recipe for my daughter's 10th birthday sleepover party and it was a huge hit. Too bad I didn't get to taste it--they gobbled it up. The recipe has one error--it tells you to use half of the chocolate covered grahams to fill the pie but doesn't mention the other half. I used them to make a border around the edge of the pie after I put on the marshmallows and topping.
