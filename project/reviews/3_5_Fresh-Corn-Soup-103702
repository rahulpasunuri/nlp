I woke up craving a simple fresh corn soup. After reading the recipe and reviews I decided on this. I did want a creamier taste so substituted 2% milk in place of the water. I've only just finished running the soup through my blender, OH MY! Exactly what I wanted. My corn is local, fresh, and white here so that's what I used. Nothing else. I may pull some chives from my garden, or saute a red bell pepper to top it, but it really needs nothing more.

Really delicious when made with farm fresh corn. The consistency is thin so I added a bit of the corn pulp to thicken it and then topped it with chopped cilantro.

Question-- what's the consistency of this supposed to be? When I used a strainer to get rid of the solids it left me with a very tasty yet liquidy liquid, which wasn't what I was expecting. Again, loved the taste, but was expecting it to be more of a puree.

I read the other reviewers comments and used milk instead of water. I felt like it was a still a little bland, so I added extra pepper and cilantro. With these additions, everyone thought that it was wonderful. I will definitely make this again - so simple and delicious!

great balance of corn to liquid. add mint or cilantro or white pepper to make different punches of flavor.

This recipe is so easy to make, and requires no special skills, making it easy for the beginner chef. Fresh corn really makes a difference, but I regularly use frozen supersweet white corn. Just fantastic. Almost anything could spice this one up.... yum!

My husband made this with sweet, farm fresh corn and it was DELICIOUS! He passed it through a chinois twice so it was unbelievably silky and then just before serving we added grilled lobster meat and some of the corn (that was simmered). FANTASTIC!

Great--garnish with salty popcorn and a drop of white truffle oil

I realize I'm stating the obvious, but this is a recipe for the purist. It is, literally, the essence of corn. If you love corn, you will love this recipe.

I love recipes like this that provide a base for interpretation. My interpretation you ask, 1/2 water, 1/2 Vita Soy Creamy Original Soy Milk (behaves closest to milk in my opinion), blend, pass through a chinois, garnish with sauted corn kernels...drove people wild!

I made a soup very similar to this -- only difference was that i used milk instead of water (2 cups whole milk to 6 ears corn, from the "chilled corn soup w/ crab meat and chile oil"). i added salt but not the chives (i didn't have any). i used farm-fresh corn, and the soup was AMAZING. it's like drinking the essence of corn. i'm not so sure that i would want to try it without the milk though -- it adds a nice mellow creaminess to balance summer corn's strong, almost overpowering sweet starch. in any case, try some version of this soup -- it's like a new comfort food!

Have made this 3 times since it first appeared in GOURMET. Everyone that I've served it to has loved it. Fresh, peak-of-season corn is essential. Otherwise, you may as well use frozen, but it won't taste the same. As one reviewer commented, it does have a taste reminiscent of creamed corn, but compare the ingredients. Definitely a hit with purists and freshness advocates.

I tried making this soup with both fresh corn kernels and frozen kernels. To my taste, there was no difference except it was a lot easier with the frozen. When I gave the soup to friends, they all wanted the recipe. It is truly delicious, especially chilled.

This soup is definately a purist delight. Its almost too simple. I really did not enjoy it very much at all- maybe better quality corn would have made up for the lack of flavor? Tastes sort of like really light canned cream corn pushed through a sieve- sort of like taking out saltiness and preservatives. Not really that impressive tasting, but definately fresh. Not for the exotic food lover out there.
