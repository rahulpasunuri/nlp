made this last night for dinner as a side vegetable. Of course, salmon was not included when being prepared. I had a small amount of hash browns in the freezer and wanted to use them. I was pleasingly surprised at the taste of this dish. The small amount of cream is the essential ingredient in making this an ok dish to a very nice substitute vegetable every now and then.

i was intrigued by such a discrepancy in the first four reviews. being a big fan of fresh dill, i thought i would give it a try. needless to say, my wife and both really liked it quite a bit. i did use extra dill, and the amount of cream suggested is actually very little. it was a nice, refreshing change to have for a light dinner along with a salad

I have made this several times and it has always met with rave reviews from people ho enjoy smoked salmon. It is moist and delicious and quick to make. I wonder if the others who made the recipe and did not like it used good quality smoked salmon or tried to substitute lox, which definitely would not work.

I used Alaskan smoked salmon and it worked really well. It is not fatty and has flavor that can stand on its own. It is a great favorite with our friends and I make it often. Especially as I am not to fond of this type of smoked salmon.

The delicate flavor of smoked salmon is lost among the other ingredients in this dish. Everyone who tried it found it to be heavy and bland; a little like eating warmed lard. If you choose to make this experimentaly be prepared to dispose of it quickly; before anyone finds out.

Heavy fat content for little or no taste.
