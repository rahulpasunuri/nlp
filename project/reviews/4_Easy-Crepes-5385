I've made this recipe twice in the past two days! It's incredibly easy and quick (I didn't use a blender, nor did wait the 15 minutes to chill... we were hungry!) and the crepes come out perfectly ever time. I substituted 2% milk and filled our crepes with strawberries and nutella. Delish!

This has already become a family favorite. I substitute 3/4 cup rice flour with 1/4 cup cornmeal because I have a family member who is gluten intolerant. I also add 1 teaspoon baking powder to adjust for gluten free. That being said, this is easy to make, flavorful and very tender. We like to roll them up with fillings, top with cheese and bake for 15 minutes to make "tapas."

A quick and easy recipe for when you're craving crepes! The only change I made was to double the sugar as I was making dessert crepes.

I made a double batch of these for work and everyone loved them. Great and east.

Easy and highly recommended. I've had crepes with better texture than these, but they'd probably improve if you blended them longer and let the batter sit longer than an hour. Since milk is $4.19/gal, I substituted dry NF milk w/ no problem.

Oh my god! I have tried to make crepes so many times before and these are so so good! I give them three thumbs up!

This made the absolute BEST crepes ever. My friends and I had a French cuisine night and used these crepes for savoury and sweet dishes. As the other reviewer mentioned, it's very important to have the right type of pan. I will DEFINITELY make this again.

This batter was spectacularly easy to make. I have a fantastic high-end crepe pan, and I'm sure that helped, but the texture was great - just the right amount of thickness. Filled the crepes with bananas and topped them with creme anglais and canned chocolate sauce. I got rave reviews including people nagging me to have them over for crepes again. Total time investment (including cooking the crepes) was about 20 minutes. Wonderful.

One of the easiest desserts ever. Served this with sliced fresh berries, ice cream and drizzled chocolate sauce.

WOW! Can I say that again? WOW! EASY is right! I did not have whole milk so I used 1/2 cream and 1/2 skim milk. I doubled the sugar as others suggested and added a small splash of vanilla. Used strawberries (in sugar) for the filling and topped with whipped cream. This beats short cake any ol' day! Delicious. (and great that thay can be made ahead of time!)

Does what it says on the tin- great easy recipe. I used a nonstick pan and they were still lovely. Yummy.

EASY EASY!!! Anyone can make this in a flash. I was concerned that I didn't have a "crepe pan", but not a problem. I made them for a light breakfast and had some left over and for an early dinner stuffed them with mushrooms, chicken and aspargus. They were all the rave.

This is indeed an easy, fast and reliable recipe for crepes. I often make it in the morning for breakfast. And the crepes always turn out fantastic.

I LOVE IT! Virtually anyone can make this recipe! Crepes are a delicious food, and these are so easy to make. For people that don't have much time for their family, this recipe is GREAT! Crepes are great with fruit jelly and cottage cheese on top. This is a great meal for kids, just add the toppings/food they like and roll them up in the crepe, like a taco. These are an all around easy food to make. This is a FAVORITE IN MY FAMILY!!

I can't believe how easy this was, I attempted crepes many times and they never turned out quite right, this time they were perfect!!!!

I believe the crepes were a little to eggy, but worth it because they were easy. I like them with A LITTLE bit of honey instead of suger. Healthier, and tastes great if the crepes are also made with wheat flower!

This is a very easy recipe. It was my first time making crepes and I have a few suggestions as to how to make a successful go of it. As with pancakes, having the right heat for the skillet/crepe pan is key...I threw out several because I didn't cook them properly (burner was either too high or too low). It takes some testing to figure it out. Make sure you let the batter chill (covered) for at least 1/2 hour and up to one day. These pointers will help to make these crepes a great success. I actually filled the crepes with brown sugar strawberries and creme anglaise, heated it up in the oven and then created a strawberry sauce for topping.

I had to triple this recipe for the number of people I was feeding and wound up with milky scrambled eggs...not crepes! Later, I went back to the drawing board (or bowl of batter, in this case!) and added another 2 cups of flour and was able to make crepes. Good luck!

We don't have an IHOP in our area, so I was ecstatic to find this WONDERFUL crepe--it's just like my favorite German crepe. Like a previous reviewer, I increased sugar to 2 Tbsp. Spread crepe with melted butter, drizzle with fresh lemon juice & sprinkle with XXX sugar! YUMMMM!

Just so you know, this recipe can be made without a blender....simply use a large whisk. A great recipe.

I hate it when other people chang a a recipe all around and then rate it, but now I am doing the same thing. (at least I am positive rather than changing 5 out of 6 ingrediants then saying ugh) I too used skim milk, and vanilla sugar rather than plain sugar. filled them with frozen strawberries mixed with a little cinnamon & sugar and topped with whipped cream. They were devoured and I will make this many times with different fillings. YUMMY! Who knew crepes could be so easy!

My mother and I *loved* these crepes. I used skim milk instead of whole and didn't have time to let it come to room temperature. After chilling for only 15 minutes, they turned out light and flavorful with a wonderful texture. Perfect with a compote of simmered apples, dried cranberries and fresh lemon!

Very easy. I have made this many times, with 2% milk and wheat flour, and they come out well -- easy to work with.

Just as the name suggest easy! and great. I top them with a variety of things, roll them like tacos and put either cheese or chicken and cover with a tomato or bechamel sauce and melt them in the oven. If you can get your hands on mexican "cajeta" sprinckle crushed pecan nuts on top an serve as desert. Delicious!

Wonderful recipe, easy to follow. I used 2% milk. Crepes turned out beautifully. Filled with warm cherry preserves and topped with sour cream. Absolutely wonderful!

easy to make. chose it on a whim, and discovered that I was out of butter, so used 1.5 tbs of olive oil instead. worked fine. nice to know you can wing it without the perfect "crepe" pan. also added a little cinnamon and vanilla.

Very simple and delicious; I've used the recipe many times. I experimented with 2% milk and that was fine, but using all non-fat is not a good idea...too watery and not very crepe-like at all.

When I had first Made this recipe I had never made Crepes before, This recipe Was very easy to make and the Crepes Tasted delicious! I can't wait to make them again.

Not very impressed. I was hoping they'd turn out like the way they make them at my favorite crepe place in Berkeley, but I was sorely disappointed. Too flimsy, soggy, and "eggy" for my taste. Although I admit that they were indeed very easy to make, I won't bother with this recipe again.

A very simple recipe with delicious results--the crepes keep well too, so you can make them ahead and store them in wax paper or an airtight container. The next time I make the recipe, I think that I'll double the sugar since I like them without syrup. I served my crepes lightly dusted with confectioner's sugar with with butter and lemon. IHOP's German crepes have nothing on this recipe!

I substitute soya oil for butter and add 3 tbsp of juice from Screw-Pine leaves (Pandan Leaves) to have a great light green color and a wonderful flavor

I've always been intimidated with crepe-making. This was the easiest recipe I've every made. I blended the ingredients in a blender and chilled them overnight. The next morning, it was just a matter of pouring and swirling, Voila! Crepes!

So delicious and easy. I add a bit of vanilla and serve it the traditional french way- squeeze fresh lemon on it and sprinkle with sugar. These also freeze well and pop into the microwave for a quick on the run breakfast! Enjoy!

The crepes were great! Of course the first one didn't really work, but after that I couldn't make them fast enough for my guests. I didn't let the milk become room temp., it made me uneasy. Good Luck!
