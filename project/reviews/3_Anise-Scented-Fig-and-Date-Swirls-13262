This is a very simple, yet elegant cookie. It is a new Christmas favorite.

It was fairly easy to make and quite tasty. I made them for Christmas and they looked quite festive. I added a touch of orange extract as well. I don't know that the brown sugar on the outside adds much, but I do suggest baking them on parchment to make the clean up easier.

I made this for my father and husband and they both raved about them. It was super easy to make!
