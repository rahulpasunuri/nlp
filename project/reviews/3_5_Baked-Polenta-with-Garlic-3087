I lovde this recipe because you can make it ahead, put it in the oven, and still have a creamy polenta at the table. I love garlic, but next time I would use only two cloves.

Very rich and tasty! Increased chicken broth by a cup (reduced water by same amt)and used a whole head of roasted garlic. Also, used thyme in place of rosemary. Made it the night before my dinner party. Served with grilled steaks w/gorgonzola butter and arugula salad. Fabulous!

Very tasty and easy. I used a pinch of dried rosemary and than crushed it before adding it to the polenta.

Very easy to make, especially if you assemble it a day ahead. Even with the cheese and the herbs we found it rather bland. I'm thinking maybe we just don't like polenta very much because this seems to be a very decent example.

This was very good and easy, my whole family liked it. I followed the suggestion of putting in the garlic and rosemary in big pieces and removing them before baking.This worked fine with the garlic, but the rosemary leaves fell off and were scattered throughout the polenta. Next time I'll put them in piece of cheesecloth.

This is a fantastic side dish. I always make it for our BBQs - I am vegetarian so I used vegetable stock. Quick, easy and tasty.

Best polenta I've had! A suggestion for eliminating the rosemary crunchies - buzz it around in a spice grinder for a while, a morter and pestle would likely work well too. I did this, and I added some fresh sage, it gave the polenta a slight green tinge but it was not unattractive, and most importantly - it tasted awesome.

Fab. One suggestion is to leave the rosemary in large pieces, then fish them out after bringing the mixture to a boil. Mildly flavors the broth/milk mixture, but without having to chomp on any prickly rosemary bits when eat it. Also did the same thing with the garlic (fished out the large bits) Guests raved. Recipe distributed. Great with braised lamb shanks.

I love polenta but can't stand stirring it. This recipe is a great compromise and allows you to get the rest of the meal ready while its baking.

Great for company. Creamy right out of the oven, hardens up quickly--serve immediately if you want it creamy. I reduced the parmesan by at least half to allow it complement other dishes and reduce fat.

Easy to make and prepare ahead. Everyone to whom I served it loved it.

This recipe was easy and excellent! My kids loved it! Note: I used 2 14oz cans of chicken broth and 1 1/4 cups of water. Will definitely make this for a dinner party.

I love polenta but hate having to stand and stir for 45 minutes! This recipe was not only one of the creamiest and best tasting but also easy on the cook! Being abelt o prepare it ahead of time is a real plus. I think this will become a favorite!

Ready to kick it up a notch? Here is the ultimate adaptation for a phenomenal appetizer. It blew my Italian mother-in-law away! She's been making polenta for 50 years!!! Bake the polenta in a cookie sheet (with edges) so that it is only 1/2 inch thick. After completely cooling use a cookie cutter to cut out neat shapes. Top with a bit of sauteed wild mushroom, put a dot of sharp cheese such as gorgonzola on top and put under the broiler briefly until melted.

Very good. I used more parmesan as well and added more chicken broth when it was simmering, since it seemed to get a little too thick. My very finicky 16-year old son had 3 helpings! It went very nicely with grilled veal rib chops.

Deliscious and great to prepare ahead. I use extra parmesan and cut the water by 1/2 cup so I can use 2 cans of chicken broth.
