It is a fine weeknight meal. Chicken was yummy (I did brown it first). But squash was pretty bland. I skipped beans (not enough time) and used fresh toms (a farm share abundance!) In the Future, I will stick with the "Chicken Thighs with Squash, yams and dried apricots, it is a little more interesting.

I had no problems with this recipe, and the result was very good. It will probably be even better tomorrow. I used my Le Creuset dutch oven. after browning the chicken i sauteed an onion purely out of habit. used 2 cans of beans, drained and rinsed. i let the beans and meat gently simmer 45 minutes before adding the squash so the flavor would really develop. next time i will oven braise. the chicken thighs were fall-apart tender and very flavorful. the sweet contrast of the squash is lovely and lightens the feel of this otherwise wintery dish. if you mash the squash and beans on your plate they absorb all the lovely liquid.

Amazing dish! I would serve this to anyone and it would be loved! I didn't have the white beans, so I added some garbanzos (canned white beans would work) to the squash. I cooked it 30 mins., and the squash was mushy, still very good,, but next time I will check after 15. Also, so much liquid this could be a soup.

I have made this several times. Twice it turned out with a lot of flavor. Twice it did not. I haven't quite figured out what the trick is, but perhaps this is why there are differences in results. I will try it again tonight!

Haven't made this yet, but in my opinion, you could brown the chicken briefly to get a nice crisp on the skin (add thinly sliced prosciutto for an even better taste), then turn the heat down. Way down to a simmer while you add the veg and let the ingredients mix for the rest of the cooking time. Cook it like a fricasse.

This dish has been a family and company favorite for over ten years! I get rave reviews every time I make it. I use 2 cans white beans instead of cooking beans from scratch and I have found that you do need to add salt and pepper to the chicken before browning it. You can substitute spinach for the butternut squash and it even works with boneless and skinless thighs without the flavor suffering too much, but it's definitely richer with the skin. All in all, you really can't go wrong with this great recipe!

This was quite good. My husband devoured it. I will confess, however, that I realized after I started cooking that I didn't have white beans -- so we used one can of chick peas and one can of black beans. I used boneless thighs and breasts, extra squash and added chicken broth as well as there didn't seem to be enough liquid. All in all it was very good. Next time I'll make sure to buy white beans!

Made this tonight with 2 bone-in skin-on chicken breasts. Added a 9oz bag of artichokes, used browned chicken stock instead of the wine and used canned beans. My wife LOVED IT. I can't wait to try the leftovers because I think the flavors will be much greater after a day or two. This is so easy to make and so good that it's going to become a staple in our home!

I served this with the Roasted Butternut Squash Risotto (Gourmet, Nov 2001), except I left the squash out of the risotto and added extra to this dish. I used 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts and I steamed the squash in the microwave for 10 minutes prior to adding to the sauce. It all turned out great. With the visual contrast of the spinach in the risotto and this dish made it much more appealing than it would have been plain. I also doubled the tomatoes and the wine, and added 1/2 an onion to the vegetable mixture.

I wasn't impressed enough with this dish to make it again, although my husband said he would eat it again. I uses skinless chicken parts and dried herbs and canned northern beans. The chicken ended up being overcooked for the amount of time it took to make the squash tender. There was too much vegetable mixture compare to the amount of chicken and too much liquid. You could easily drain the tomatoes before adding. I sauteed the garlic and 1/2 chopped onion a bit before adding the wine to enhance those flavors, but the dish still seemed rather blah to me.

We found this OK but a little bland. I thought it was a bit short on liquid to be a proper braise, so I added some water; if I was to do it again, I'd use chicken broth.

It's a waste of a perfectly good squash. The chicken is fine, but the beans/tomato/squash loses any interesting flavor.

Substituted canned beans and sauteed the onion with the garlic, etc. Homey, tasty, visually pleasing, and makes excellent microwaveable leftovers for weekday lunches at work. :-)

Oh dear. This sounded great and the reviewers all raved. The entire dish tasted and looked beige. It failed to excite. We kept salting it, hoping to bring up some flavor. We should have sent out for pizza.

I also use canned beans. I sautee onion and garlic and squash, then add the tomato, beans and browned chicken, let simmer and it is a very good one-pot meal.

Wonderful! Easy, visually pleasing, tasty, and great left over. I substituted canned beans, and added 1/2 an onion to the pan just before the wine and garlic. Increased the garlic a little, too.

My family loved this dish. Hearty and great for a winter night. The combination of the beans, squash and chicken is great. You will not be disappointed.

Do not listen any of the blah reviews. I am a personal chef and have made this for my pickiest clients, who have all raved. P.S.- it does not need a starch, you have the beans~ just get a loaf of crusty bread to soak up the amazing juices!

This is company fare at our house...and everyone takes home the recipe. I use herbs d' Provence rather than the dried trio. This dish is simple and deserves to be made with dried beans rather than canned.

As some of the other reviewers pointed out there is something missing. This was on the bland side and one too many chicken dishes for my husband. He does not want any more chicken for a while. Well, on to the next recipe :-)

This recipe was fantastic -- drew rave reviews from my guests. By mistake, I overcooked the beans, so pureed most of them, and that worked well.

My husband and I were pleasantly surprised with this recipe. I was short on time so used drained canned Great Northern beans (I'm sure it changed the consistency but it was great!). Sauteed these with a whole chopped onion and garlic then did the chicken in the same pot w/ extra salt, pepper and spices. It was a gorgeous dish with a lot of flavor and color. Served it with fresh, steamed green beans w/ garlic and a roasted garlic ciabatta...YUM!

It was ok - I like the colors but it seems to be missing something. Also, it was hard to know what to serve it with...pasta or wild rice maybe? Not an incredibly interesting chicken dish.

I'm a Fireman and I have cooked this a few times for the house.Everyone really likes it. It's fairly simple, flavorful, and cheap to make!

Not sure what over reviewers like about this. We found it extremely bland, even though I used fresh herbs, free-range chicken [the most flavour-full available], increased the garlic, added a little concentrated tomato paste, etc. It's too bad, because the bean, squash and liquids and seasoning made a sauce that seems like it would be very nice with something over than chicken, perhaps some type of flavorful European sausage, like kielbasa. Truth be told, the ingredients would make a lovely bean soup with the addition of a strong flavored pork sausage or ham, but as a chicken dish you can do much better.

We enjoyed this very much. Everyone went back for seconds. Wouldn't change the recipe a bit. A nice, simple dish to enjoy in front of the fire on a cold winter's night.

This was good, but I didn't think it was great. It was better the next day.

very good. I will make it again and I think use a bit of cinnamon, clove and alspice, maybe a bit of hot pepper.

The sweetness of the squash can fool you into thinking there's some sweet spice in there, like cinnamon or nutmeg. Come to think of it, maybe a dash of one or both would be a nice addition. With the canned beans, a quick and delicious dinner. Serve over polenta, maybe?

Great Fall and Winter comfort food. Better when made ahead and refrigerated before liquid is reduced. Needs seasoning well.

This recipe was fantastic! I made it much easier and quicker by using canned white beans instead of dried.
