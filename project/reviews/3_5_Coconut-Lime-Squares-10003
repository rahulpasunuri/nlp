If you like key lime pie then this is close to it. I didn't like the consistency and the lime is too intense.

These got rave reviews from everyone who tried them, and I tripled the recipe and served them to a large group. Many remarked that they were really special, a delicious twist on the traditional lemon bar. I made the recipe exactly as written, I used a microplane to zest the lime which gets good zest and no bitter pith. I had some regular limes and some persian limes, which were not very juicy, so I did finally (since I made such a big batch) cave and use some bottled lime juice to get up to the full amount. I lined my pyrex pans with parchment and sprayed with baker's joy and they came out perfectly. The flavors make a great dessert with asian food. I will definitely make these again!

I halved the sugar and used unsweetened flaked coconut. I was unsure if the custard would set with less sugar so added 1 tsp of gelatine to ensure it did. (might not be needed). To get the top layer to caramelise a little, I sprinkled 1 tsp of berry sugar over it (extra fine ordinary sugar). Before cutting, I scattered the citrus 'pearls' from one Australian Native Finger Lime over all (tiny intensely tart, strong lime flavoured, beads). Compliments and requests for the recipe all round!

Good in every way except the lime tasted bitter. I think I'll stick to lemon bars or perhaps a lemon-lime mixture next time. The coconut added a nice texture but not much flavor.

Super pleased with this recipe. I was able to prepare, cook and clean up after it in about an hour. The ingredients are very simple. And, most importantly, it came out delicious and was a complete hit when served a few hours after baking. I'm so happy to have a non-chocolate recipe that doesn't feel like non-chocolate filler - something that people can get excited about in its own right!

Fantastic!! I have made this as an "as is" recipe, but did a substitution of Meyer Lemon Juice from our tree and found out that is is incredible with limes or meyer lemons!

This is a great recipe! I used fresh key lime juice. I lined the pan with foil for easy removal and I cut them after an hour of chilling. They really are better the next day, so it`s a good "do ahead" recipe. I highly recommend!

I worked with a previous user's idea of making these into little tartlets with a mini muffin pan, and they came out exceptionally well. I used about a tbsp of dough and 1.5 tbsp of custard per cup, and baked them in mini muffin liners for easy removal (some had said that the bars stuck to the pan). The little tartlets were charming looking; I would only change two things about the recipe. Next time I will put a bit less dough per tartlet, and use some coconut milk in the custard. The coconut flavor was lost to the fresh lime juice.

For those who had problems with it sticking in the pan the next day, just make a sling out of foil before greasing and flouring- whole things comes right out!

These are fantastic. I doubled the recipe and it worked perfectly. I used a sugar substitute in place of both the sugars and I replaced the sweetened coconut with unsweetened- baking for a diabetic, I'm always looking for recipes that I can "unsweeten" and still have a fantastic dessert. This one is perfect. I will definitly be making these again.

Yummy!! I love the strong lime flavour. I accidentally mixed the coconut for the topping in with the custard mixture, but it came out great anyway :-) The only thing I would change next time is I would make the crust thinner.

I bought a bag of limes from costco for margaritas and never got to it, so I made this recipe for us and one to give to a friend's family. I loved it, our friends loved it, but our kids were a bit "iffy". I might try more of a cookie type crust next time and I think it will fly. Personally, my husband and I thought it was wonderful!

These were very good and very easy. I had pretty large limes, so the 1/2 cup + 2 Tbs was easily met after juicing about 3 limes. It was nice that you didn't have to cook the custard like so many other lemon or lime bar recipes. Also, when I added the flour to the custard, I did get some clumps, but they dissapeared after being cooked. My only criticism (and it's not necessarily a bad thing) is that the lime flavor was very strong and I didn't taste too much coconut. Some reviewers said that the tartness died down the next day, but unfortunately I didn't have a chance to try them the next day. In terms of texture though, the coconut added a nice dimension. Overall, these were absolutely delicious, super easy, and I wouldn't hesitate to make them again.

I have made this recipe twice and loved it both times! I forgot to prepare the pan the second time, but had no trouble removing them from the pan. The flavors are perfect together. I think the coconut balances out the tartness of the lime. They are quick and easy to put together and then they just chill in the refrigerator. Enjoy!

These were good and easy. I would absolutely make them again. Just be sure not to toast the coconut too much. Mine was a little crispy and dark.

We really enjoyed this recipe. The best advice was to cut up right after the chill period. It sticks a lot if you don't. Has anyone tried making these in mini muffin pans? I would love to make mini lime tarts.

Made this recipe along with a frosted cookie and the triple chocolate brownies (on this site). These were the only ones left. I did cut down on the amount of lime juice (less than 1/2 of a cup) based on reading the other reviews. I wish I hadn't. They tasted too bland. However, I would give the crust and how easy they were to make 4 forks!

Perfectly balanced in flavor and texture, a simple and superlative dessert, especially after a hot and spicy meal.

Delicious! I thought the texture of the filling was perfect - thick and creamy. I did not have coconut on hand, so I omitted it from the recipe. I also used about a pound of key limes and one regular lime, which was a little more than 1/2 a cup of juice. I will definately make this again, maybe with lemon or orange instead.

I'm making these for the third time. They're a nice contrast on a tray of cookies and squares. And the tart taste is nice and unusual.

Rating: 4
I love these more every time I taste them. They're easy to put together, and the balance of sweet and tart is dead-on. You can make them with lemon too. I agree with the reviewers who say that the tartness mellows overnight - the bars are a little puckery on the day they're baked. I suggest cutting the squares right after they've chilled for the recommended 1 hour. If you leave the whole thing in the pan, the crust starts to stick after a day or so in the fridge and they're impossible to get out.

I make this recipe all the time. I have brought them to many potlucks and everyone raves about them. Sometimes I leave out the coconut when I don't have any around and they are still great!

Rating: 3
I give these a good, solid 3 forks (but my hubby gives these only 2 forks). I took these to a potluck last night and served them after they sat in the refigerator for about 5 hours. Everyone liked them - but you'd have to really like lime flavor to love them, which I do. And yes, they were even better today.

I added chopped macadamia nuts to the crust, otherwise made as directed. I love them, but they didn't go very quickly at the cookout. Of course, there was a lot of other desserts on the table. I'd make again.

Soo yummy! I followed the recipe exactly and left the squares in the refrigerator overnight as other reviewers suggested. When I woke up in the morning, half the pan was gone already. My family insists that I make this one again.

To the cook from St. Louis, regarding the zesting issue: Williams-Sonoma or any other fine cookware shop sells the BEST grater called the Microplane. Don't buy an imposter-- the Microplane zester yields showers of fluffy zest with hardly any pressure applied. Well worth the investment.

Does anyone know if I could double this recipe and make it in a 9 by 13 pan? It sounds like it's worth making extra! Thanks.

For the cook from St. Louis - buy a zester - it is a little gadget that makes zesting a lime or lemon MUCH easier. They carry them at Williams Sonoma and Crate & Barrel for anywhere between $3 and $8.

On grating lime zest without it sticking to the grater: put a piece of parchment or clingwrap over the grater you're going to use, grate as usual, when you peel back the parchment/clingwrap the zest should come with.

Rating: 4
YUMMY! Easy to make (except grating one tablespoon of lime zest). Like other reviewers, I agree that this is very "limey" on the first day. But if you make it a day ahead and serve it on the second day they are just perfect. Any hints on how to grate lime zest without having most of it stuck to the grater?

I used the filling for mini tarts, as I had already mixed up a butter crust dough. I didn't have coconut, so I used sliced almonds, coated with a mixture of egg and sugar. Delicious!

The first time I made this was for a party. One woman actually shouted her delight with these bars; another commented that she loves lime and these actually had enouch lime taste. Uncomplicated to make and thoroughly enjoyable.

Great--easy, and flawless. I make this frequently, whenever I have guests who normally complain desserts are too sweet, or whenever I need a quick dessert for an Asian-flavored meal. I like them the first day _and_ the second.

Scrummy...I added some halved macadamia nuts on top with the coconut, and they added great texture and boosted the tropical quotient. I think next time I may try some graham crackers in the crust.

At first I thought something was wrong with the base, but it turned out well. I like the sweet/tart thing that the coconut/lime mixture gives it. If you want to eat it the same day, simply add less lime juice. I added just under 1/2 cup and it was fine to eat right away, although the next day it wasn't as limey. Very good bars.

Rating: 4
These bars are wonderful. They have a nice custard -to- crust ratio, and the coconut adds a subtle flavor and a great texture. If your guests aren't coconut fans, like one of mine, you might try sprinkling only half the pan with toasted coconut at the end. Then, when you pull the pan out of the oven and they've cooled a little, dust with some powdered sugar. It's a nice, refreshing variation of lemon bars. I agree with the other cooks -- the lime needs a day or so to mellow out.

Rating: 3
These were very easy to make and also very tasty. I messed up and put the coconut directly into the lime mixture, but it turned out fine - I also put more coconut on top. I would definitely suggest making them a day ahead and letting the lime flavor "mellow" a bit. Otherwise, an excellent recipe!

Rating: 3
Maximum wonderful for minimum effort! This relatively simple recipe makes a very satifying treat. We made a doublebatch the day before we were to serve this confection and after slicing and plating the bars decided to preview one. We tasted and found them to be a little over-the-top with lime flavor. However, after resting about 24 hours the flavors had melded and mellowed and we found the bars to be extremely delicious (so did everyone else!).
