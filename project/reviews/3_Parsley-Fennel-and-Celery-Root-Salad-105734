Fresh, crisp flavor, and it keeps! We enjoyed this salad for several days after Thanksgiving, then the rest went in the turkey/vegetable soup.

This salad is very pretty and is a nice refreshing addition to the Thanksgiving table. In the future, we would use less parsley, and add more shaved fennel, though. A little orange juice and/or zest might be nice, too.
