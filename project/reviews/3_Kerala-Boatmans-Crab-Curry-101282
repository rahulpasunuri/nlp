Excellent - used it to use up some leftover crab meat. Not enough crab so I added shrimp and it was delicious. I did increase the amount of spice and added toasted cashews and coconut as condiments.

WOW! It took me 6 years to finally make this recipe after tasting it at a restaurant and hunting for it online. Having all the ingredients on hand at the same time was somewhat of a challenge and today I finally got it all together! This recipe was tasty. I doubled the recipe for all but the crab meat. I was out of onions, so I used the white parts of green onions. I think I may try it again with sweetened coconut milk next time. I usually order it a Baluchis in NYC and it is ridiculously good; this recipe is close and good enough to sate a craving. But I can't wait to get to Baluchis again.

I was really disappointed with this dish. I found it to be bland. I even added fresh curry leaves as stated in the recipe. It smelled great while I was cooking it but after I added the coconut milk, it just tasted creamy. There was not enough spice flavor. I ended up adding fresh chili peppers for more heat and added prepared curry powder. It smelled too fishy for my preference (maybe because I used canned crab meat?)Everyone else gave it rave reviews. Maybe I'm just spoiled with all the great Indian restaurants in the city.

Being from Kerala myself, I was curious to try the recipe. It was authentic tasting (I did increase the spices somewhat) and very flavorful. I plan to make it again.

We've made it often from fresh Maine crab. It gets rave reviews.

Delicious, easy, and unusual (in my kitchen, anyway). I used canned crab and light coconut milk, both of which worked fine. It's low-carb, too, if you skip the rice.

This turned out pretty good, but not as thick as i would have wanted. It might have been because i used light coconut milk instead of the regular. I also added quite a bit of extra spice. It was good though

This was easy to make and very tasty. I used canned crab and it worked nicely. I will definitely be making this again.

A fabulously different way to make crab! Very, very good. It was spicy and delicious. I got raves and will definitely make again.

We didn't have cilantro or scallions, so we substituted lemon basil and spicy basil for the cilantro and chives for the scallion garnish. Delicious! Also, to avoid breaking up the crab, use the handle end of a wooden spoon to gently stir.

A delicious recipe. I recommend using fresh lump crab meat and adding the crab at the very last second as it is very delicate and will come apart with to much handling.

This dish is quit adaptable to taste. The ingredients were readily available. We substituted some of our favorite Italian and Mexican herbs and spices to flavor it to personal taste!
