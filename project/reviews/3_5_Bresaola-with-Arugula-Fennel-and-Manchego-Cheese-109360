A friend made this as an appetizer using watercress and Gruyere and it was pretty wonderful.

great finger food for wine tasting... the fennel pairs well with pinot noir.

I made this as a salad, tossing the arugula and fennel with the dressing, spreading it out on a shallow platter and strewing the parmesan and bresaola on top. It was delicious!

First of all Arugula is known as Rocket in the US. This is a very good recipe for a great appetizer. I have made this with chopped "Rocket" mixed with whole milk Ricotta then rolled in the Bresaola and served on a bed of... you guessed it "Rocket", it's wonderful.

I converted this into a salad, and it was fabulous. The flavors really compliment each other. Very refreshing with the fennel.
