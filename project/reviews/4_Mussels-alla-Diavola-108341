A lovely mussel dish that is simple to prepare and amazingly improves overnight as the flavors blend!!

Though this meal was quite delicious, be aware of what the recipe title means!! My Italian friend told me this means mussels from the devil, which is clearly disconcerting. I prayed before and after cooking this meal, and of course boiled the pasta in holy water, but I couldn't help feeling uneasy after knowing the meaning behind this recipe. I will not be making this recipe again, but if you do may the LORD be with you. Keep Jesus in your heart and dinner.

Such a great recipe and so easy to make. Will most definitely make again.

This was a memorable dish. Made a few modifications...cut back to 8 cloves of garlic, 1 tsp red pepper flakes, 1 tsp dried oregano. Left out the capers and olives. Used canned San Marzano tomatoes and DaVinci Chianti. Added fresh basil at the end, sauce needs to be salted to taste. Served with fettucini and crusty Italian bread. If you are in north Jersey, get your mussels from Denville Seafood. We both agreed that these were the best mussels we have EVER had.

As many other reviewers already wrote, the sauce is quite good. The hardest part was probably pitting the olives. That said, I thought the mussels got lost in this dish, overpowered by all the garlic (I used two bulbs which yielded fewer than 12 cloves), olives, capers, and tomatoes. Instead of dried basil, I just used some fresh which helped lift the dish, in my opinion. Hearty, filling, and one where the heat slowly but surely builds up.

Last night was my second time making this, and it was amazing again. The recipe couldn't be easier and is totally fool-proof (throw in a little extra of one thing, a little less of something else) and it is great regardless. My boyfriend said he would be happy if this was served to him in a restaurant. It's definitely spicy, but we like that. I made with linguine this time, just crusty bread (the sauce was sort of like a zuppa de clams) the first time. A household favorite which impreses every time!

was awesome!!! i did cut the garlic a little back. 12 cloves sounded a bit much. i did not have any tomato paste and it worked out just fine. used fresh basil. great flavors. it's a keeper!!!

Should have checked first to be sure that my guests loved mussels, but the sauce was a huge hit. It would have killed had I made it with shrimp.

I was a little worried that I would mess this one up, but its so good no matter what you do. I cooked the mussels separately and then poured the sauce over them so that less stuck to the shells, and there was plenty of sauce that way.

Great mussels recipe even for a novice. We all agree that the pasta sauce would be great even without the mussels. I used 1 teaspoon of pepper flakes and it was a good spicy...wouldn't do anymore.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious. Per some other reviews, I used about 1 tsp of red pepper flakes and went a little heavy on the wine for more liquid - otherwise, made per the recipe. It's our new family standard mussel recipe :)

Rating: 4
This is one of my favourite recipes, I make it again and again. Sometimes I substitute the mussles for shrimp, prawns or even hot italian sausage (in which I cut back on the red pepper flake). In my opinion, a good recipe is one that stands well with substitution and my daily living!

Very good! Cut back on the red pepper flakes, added several peeled, fresh plum tomatoes that had on hand and fresh basil and oregano from the garden.

I was so excited about this meal I got on the phone after dinner to tell my folks about it ...that good! I made a few alterations ...I used fresh basil & oregano from the garden, I used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes (instead of whole tomatoes & tomato paste), used 3 tsps of olive oil and only 1 pound of mussels (which were plenty with leftovers for me & my beau). We didn't have any pasta on hand so Beau had his with quinoa & I just enjoyed mine strait up ...I can't wait to make it for more people!

Found this recipe using the epi mobile application. Very tasty. Like others, reduced the dried peppers to 3/4 tsp. Perfect. Wasn't sure what was meant by tomatoes in puree, so used a 28 oz can of tomato puree--worked well and gave a nice thick sauce. DH liked the sauce so much that he's requested this be used for all pasta dishes and mini pizzas.

really delicious and very spicy- i added 3T of tomato paste, and less olive oil. not for you if you're afraid of spice!

Rating: 4
Very Good! I used 2 fresh hot red peppers instead of dried flakes which made a mild temperature.Fresh Oregano and Basil instead of dried and I over measured the wine a little. I was just cooking for 2 so I used 2 pounds of mussels and found there was enough left over for a third person. I will be making this again very soon.

Rating: 4
Amazing dish! Other than the mussel prep, not difficult at all. It was a tad on the spicy side, so if you're sensitive to that, only add half the red pepper. So good. I will definetly serve this if I want a good pasta dish or need something to serve to guests. My only complaint was my own fault, and it was that I forgot to get crusty bread! It was needed to sop up all the wonderful sauce!

Rating: 4
This recipe is always a huge hit, whether served as an appetizer with crusty bread or served over linguine. You may want to increase the sauce to mussels ratio, however, as a lot of the sauce sticks to the mussel shells and creates some waste. I agree with other reviewers that it doesn't need anywhere near the amount of oil. I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 c of oil, 36 cloves of garlic, 2 t. pepper flakes and added 4 shallots. It was incredible and people raved and raved about it at NYE dinner.

Rating: 4
I have made this fantastic recipe a few times and have always been impressed. This time I made it with hot Italian sausage, cut from the casings and browned before adding the garlic. I cut down on the red pepper flakes a tad because of the spice in the sausage. Need less to say, it was perfect.

This was delicious! I agree with the previous reviewer - the best red sauce recipe I have found. I didn't change a thing.

I live in Portland, Maine and have ordered mussels at every restaurant that serves them and, aside from those at a top Portland restaurant, these are the best (and there are lots of mussels to be found in Maine!!). I served these to friends visiting from the midwest, as an appetizer to a traditional lobster dinner, and they were a huge hit. I can't wait to make them again, and already have my can of San Marzano tomatoes waiting.

Rating: 4
All I can say is, "WOW!" This was the best tasting "red sauce" mussel dish I have ever had. We did not change a thing. For those who do not like spicy dishes, reduce the amount of red pepper flakes to 1/2 teaspoon. A keeper for sure!

Rating: 0
Simply divine! A very salty and delicious dish. No need to add additional salt and pepper. I agree that I would use less oil next time. I took another reviewers advice and used 3 tbps of tomato paste and really liked the thickness it added.

Rating: 4
Delicious! The capers and olives add such great taste to the sauce. The only thing I would change next time is decreasing the amount of crushed red pepper down to about 1/2 tsp. or so. I LOVE heat and spice, but too much of it will overpower the delicate taste of the mussels!

Rating: 4
This was wonderful! I am a tentative cook, and I had never cooked mussels before, so I was a bit nervous undertaking this. It was incredibly easy and my guests were so impressed with this recipe. It is wonderfully spicy. I recommend a crusty bread and parmesan available on the table. The only thing I would do differently would be to make extra sauce.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe and easy, I used half the red pepper flakes and slightly less garlic, but added shrimp and some sugar to cut the tomatoe taste. Thanks for a great addition to my culinary delights.

Great "go to" recipe. Add shrimp and scallops to dress it up. Love that the sauce can be made ahead - enhances the flavors and makes an easy, impressive meal for guests.

Rating: 4
Fabulous! The capers and olives make this a brinier dish than just a regular ole marinara. I didn't have tomato paste but it worked out fine. I had some leftover olives from ages ago and was able to use them up. We put it over whole wheat angel hair and the sauce was fabulous. Definitely a keeper and will make again.

Made this last night after reading all the rave reviews. Like another reviewer, I used a 28 oz, can of diced tomatoes but otherwise didn't change a thing. Unfortunately, I was out of capers, but even so, this was absolutely delicious made with fresh PEI mussels! Yum!

Rating: 4
Wonderful! Had to make a few substitutions as I did not have all the ingredients on hand...omitted the capers, reduced the amount of garlic significantly, substituted the red wine for Tomasello's Cape May White (NJ), picked fresh parsley, basil and oregano from the garden and added a few shakes of Pampered Chef's seasoned salt. Despite all the changes, tasted quite well.

Rating: 4
This was really delicious. I made the recipe exactly as written, with the exception that I used frozen mussels that were already cooked. I just tossed them in at the end to warm them through. There was just enough spice in my opinion: a little heat, but not overwhelming. It was even better the next day for lunch!

Rating: 4
This was excellent. I used diced canned tomatoes and 2 TBSP of spaghetti sauce instead of tomato paste. I also recommend using angel hair pasta instead of linguine. A keeper!

Rating: 4
These mussels were fabulous! I added quite a few more flakes as we like spice and omitted the pasta. I simply served it with great bread and enjoyed it that way.Make sure if you are a garlic lover to use the amount stated as that is part of the great flavour. You can't go wrong with this one.

I made this as an appetizer(just the mussels, not pasta) for my dad's birthday and it was a big hit. I made the sauce a day ahead and the flavours were fabulous. The olives and capers put the dish over the top. This is a keeper.

Rating: 4
This was truly delicious. I'm not usually a fan of olives and my boyfriend doesn't usually enjoy capers, but everything came together so well in the sauce. All of the flavors really complemented each other. I made the sauce the night before and it was very good, but the juices that the mussels released into the sauce during the cooking process put it over the top. I served it over fettucini and with the same cabernet that I used in the sauce. A definite keeper!

Rating: 4
Terrific. I made a few mods, some previously mentioned. 1. Much less oil, but good, virgin oil; 2. More pepper flakes(2 tsp); 3. One small chorize, diced and cooked with onion; 4. Four heapjng tsp of commercial minced garlic, added just 30 seconds before cooling the pan with the tomatoes; 5. 1/2 cup minced quahogs, just before the olives; 6. Added olives only 2 minutes before the mussels, so as not to "cook in" too much. Cheers!

I did make this with mussels, but I think the sauce would stand alone. Tasty and quick to make with ingredients from the pantry.

This is so delicious! I used the best canned tomatoes (San Marzano) which made a big difference as they're sweeter and less acidic with a gorgeous deep red color. I always use more red pepper flakes than called for, and eyeball the amount of wine until I like the consistency. Used a good Zinfandel which was lovely in this. Like another reviewer, I found that about 2 lbs. of mussels in this recipe was just right for 2 people, and I skipped the pasta opting for some crusty bread instead. I also found that there was no need for additional salt, and 9 cloves of garlic was plenty (they were big). Incredibly good, hearty fare. I will be making this often.

One of my favorite epicurious recipes. Consistently good and a crowd pleaser. This is a staple of my New Year's table--but easy enough to make any time during the week. My family loves it. Use extra red pepper flakes and garlic for a bigger kick.

Rating: 4
Marvelous! Didn't use the pasta, just sopped up the sauce with crusty bread. Did it twine now once with 1 1/2 pounds of mussels and the second with the full three pounds. I think you need at least 2-3 puonds to get the right effect. Loved it.

First, let me say that this dish is fantastic, only we didn't make it with seafood. We made it with ground sirloin. (It was all we had in the house!) I think this recipe is so versatile. It's been a week since we had it, and really, we're still talking about it. We'll make it again and again, and next time, with shrimp!

Rating: 4
oh ... my ... goodness. SO fabulous. Didn't have any olives, the saltiness would have made this even better (if that's possible!). Only had 2 Lbs of mussels with the full complement of sauce. Served as a first course with a Rioja - truly noteworthy!

This was a great recipe with fantastic flavors. I used about two pounds of mussels and served two with enough for leftovers. I cut down the oil and added a finely chopped onion. A great result.

I've made this twice with rave reviews from my guests! The first time I made it with muscles and calimari, the second with just shrimp. I left out the olives and capers, but added worchestire sauce. Though it says this dish serves 6, I think it more realistic to say it serves 4 healthy-sized main course servings.

Loved it - has a great kick. However, next time I will reduce the amount of oil.

I was told by one of my guests, the wife of a respected local chef, that these were the best mussles she ever had, and the sauce was so easy. Of course I added extra red pepper flakes.

This was so delicious and absolutely so easy. I was amazed. I followed the recipe absolutely with the addition of a little salt and pepper and served with an Italian salad and bread to soak up the sauce. A big help to making this so easy was Whole Foods. They sell already completely cleaned mussels-- all I did was rinse them in a colander-- and also already pitted Kalamata olives. With a bottle of red wine (Menage a Trois from Folie de Duex), it was a relaxing and convivial Sat night. Lots of raves.

Delicious! My husband is Sicilian and I can hardly ever please him with Italian food. This recipe went over very well, however. And it was my first time cooking with mussels. Easy, easy to follow. Even if you don't have mussels, make the sauce! Next time I will try with shrimp. Initially I worried about all the garlic in this recipe and NO SALT, but after putting sauce together I understood that you DO need all that garlic and salt is not necessary because of all the heat from the crushed peppers. Make it for company, fabulous.

I came across this recipe while looking for calamari fra diavolo, which I had at an Italian restaurant recently. Calamari worked wonderfully in this recipe, just add it to the sauce after the pasta is cooked, it only takes a minute to cook in the sauce. It was absolutely delicious and so easy to make!

This dish is wonderful. I am a lover of capers and mussels. I would not have thought to combine the two, but I'm glad someone did. The first time a served this dish I prepaired the sause 3 ways. 1- with mussel (for the mussel lovers) 2- with shrimp (for those who don't eat mussel) 3- just sauce (for those who are boring) It pleaded everyone. I highly recommed it.

This was so-o-o-o good! I cut the recipe in half and used 14 oz Muir Glen diced tomatoes with some extra tomato paste (as suggested by another reviewer).

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS, EASY AND INEXPENSIVE!!!! Mussels are fairly affordable, so this dish is not a bank breaker. I wouldn't change a thing, except I may try including clams and scallops next time. BRAVO!!

Outstanding! I added a chopped onion, and a little sugar to cut the acidity a bit. I used crushed tomatoes in puree since that's what I had on hand and the tomato paste. This sauce would be great with or without the mussels. We will definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
easy & excellent. I omitted capers and still found it plenty salty. I used canned diced tomatoes in juice so upped the tomato paste a bit. Made 2/3 of the recipe for 2 lbs. of mussels and didn't have so much sauce -- I'd do full recipe for this amount next time. Great for make-ahead/ company, as sauce benefits from sitting an hour or a day.

Rating: 4
Simple perfection. This dish was outstanding, another one of epicurious.com's home runs. Normally I don't hesitate to make suggestions for variations but I wouldn't change a thing on this one. (With the exception of salt & pepper as noted in other reviews.) Try this one and enjoy!

This is delicious. It's got a nice kick to it, which is a fun departure from a standard marinara. I like this recipe because you can make it any time you can get fresh mussels--the rest of the recipe is basic pantry stuff. I agree w/the other reviewer--don't forget the S&P!

This dish was great and so easy to make!!! It needed salt and pepper, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. You could also add any other type of seafood to this dish.
