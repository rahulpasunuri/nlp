Like the other reviewers, I made a few changes. I used whole wheat fusilli pasta. Skipped the shallots and added three minced garlic cloves after the lamb and onions were sauteed. Added a can of diced tomatoes with their juices, then added the white wine. I diced the zucchini into 1/2 cubes rather than grating it, left the skin on, and added at the end of the cooking about 5 mins prior to adding the cooked pasta. Used additional fresh basil as well. Reminds me of a dish my mom used to make except she used ground beef and mushrooms in place of the lamb and zucchini. I'd definitely make this recipe again.

I think this recipe requires too many adjustments to warrant more than two forks. Needs salt; agree with others that 1 pound of meat is necessary. Additional basil is also needed as many reviewers have stated. I do not think it would require additional butter with the basil.

This was pretty easy and a nice change from the typical saucy pasta. I didn't think it was particularly noteworthy (and the flavors weren't too strong), but I'd make it again. I couldn't taste much basil, so I think I'd add more next time. Also, we sliced the zucchini rather than grating it, and I liked the way it turned out. Also, if you don't like lamb, you probably won't like this-- there isn't much seasoning, so the flavor of the lamb really comes out.

I found this recipe delicious! The lamb was definitely not as good the next day, and my husband and I agreed that roasted chicken would be better than the lamb in the dish. Regardless, I would recommend it. Yummy!

This is a "regular" recipe in my home. It's simple to make, healthy ingredients, and everyone LOVES it. Such a great recipe to give some flair to weeknight meals. I'll make it again and again.

Excellent, fun and easy twist on everyday pasta. Can use pretty much any ground meat. Try ground venison, or combo of ground beef, pork and veal.

This was very good, and quite "summer-y", but I somehow feel like it's lacking something, especially in the color department. I would certainly make it again though.

This worked really well -- although I made some amendments. I used a full pound of ground lamb, added a bit of chopped garlic to the basil butter, skipped the shallots, and added half of a small can of tomato paste. It was pretty easy and got absolute raves around here. I will definitely make this again.

This was very good, enjoyed by adults and children alike. Only change I'd recommend is to use one pound of ground lamb instead of only 8 ounces. Made the dish better I feel.

I enjoyed this dish, probably because it was something different and didn't have a sauce. It was a great way to use up all the zucchini growing in the garden. I used gluten free pasta (rice & corn) and it turned out great. It was even better the next day!

This was a fantastic dish. Instead of lamb, not being a big fan, I added a specialty chicken or turkey sausage like garlic and artichoke or basil and garlic. The sausage I would take out of the casing and add it instead of the lamb and it was fantastic. This is one of my favorite dishes and is really easy to make.

Before I made this pasta, I had not read any of the reviews. Actually, I got the recipe from a Bon Appetit cookbook. I thought it was a bit bland and would change two things. I would add more salt and pepper and not cook the zucchini quite as long, perhaps adding it with the wine. I did grate it, and since it was sliced very finely, it did not need to be cooked as long. With lots of parmesan, this is a good wholesome pasta recipe.

I substituted italian sausage for the lambe it is divine!!! Be sure you don't cut the zucchini to thin, otherwise you will lose the flavor. Definitely a favorite in my home.

Had never had lamb before, so I was skeptical during cooking due to the smell, but I was pleasantly surprised. I tinkered with how much of each ingredient I added (I was only cooking for 2) so there was neither an overwhelming amount of zucchini nor was the lamb the only thing you could taste. I kept the basil butter, accidently forgot the wine, and subbed feta for parm like someone else did, which I think was a great substitution. All in all, simple, tasty, and something different.

I was skeptical - but went ahead having had all the ingredients in my fridge. It was wonderful - and here are my changes. I added red pepper flakes after I softened the onions, removed and drained the lamb(used 1 pound)onion mixture, then deglazed the pan with wine, then returned the lamb mixture and added the zucchini and sauteed another 3 minutes. Used feta instead of parm (about 1/2 cup) and basil instead of basil butter (as previously suggested). My husband is super tough and loved it (when he eats something 2 days in a row, it's a big deal for him). Fresh black pepper when serving. (and next time I will try not to forget the garlic). It was even better the 2nd day.

I found this dish light and satisfying, just the thing for a warm summer's day served with a well chilled white wine. All it really needed was a pinch of salt to really bring out the flavours. I used a bit more lamb than was called for, because I love lamb and the friends I was serving it to like meat! I'll definitely make this again.

Even the cat would not eat it and he loves lamb.

I thought this was pleasant, not great, but okay for a change, but my husband absolutely hated it--he ate two bites and then refused to eat anymore. We both agreed that the zucchini consistency and its bland flavor overwhelmed the dish. Will not make again

This is a keeper. I would omit the butter used for the basil butter and just toss the basil in after the lamb has been browned. I think that there is enough fat in the lamb. It was a little greasy. I also agree with the garlic addition. I will try that next time.

I was astounded that so little lamb could make such a satisfying meal. I had bought a large container of fresh basil, so froze leaves in what I imagine are recipe portions in sandwich bags. I used two of them, snipped, in the butter and you'd not know they were frozen. I also added a carrot, grated, for color. Our guests, who weren't sure they liked lamb, asked for the recipe, too. An easy wonderful dish.

A little too bland for my family...could use some garlic possibly? Would leave out the basil butter and use just fresh basil next time.

This recipe is abslolutely DELICIOUS! The basil butter really makes it.

I used leftover roast lamb instead of ground. It was delicous and light! I just chopped the lamb and let simmer in the wine. Would be an excellent meal with white wine and a sald for a nice summer evening. I think you could serve it cold too!

I think that this dish is definetly a "keeper" for my family. Although I didn't have any shallots, it was still good. I also used twice as much lamb as the recipe called for, and I think that there might not be enough meat with just the 8 ounces called for. Even my son, who doesn't like lamb had two servings.
