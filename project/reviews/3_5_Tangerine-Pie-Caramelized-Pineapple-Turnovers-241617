This recipe is ideal for a video to demo the shaping technique. Although many components were quite easy, it was extremely labor intensive and time-consuming. I used 1 large (reg.sized) pineapple, only 3/4 cup of palm sugar, and Vietnamese cinnamon bark. The sweetness was so perfect. I also accidentally added ALL the eggs to my dough. The pies still tasted and looked great. My son's entire preschool class (incl.teachers & parents) LOVED these and asked for more. Since they barely puff up during baking, imperfect "tangerines" will still look imperfect later. Mine tasted WAY better than they looked. Although everyone else seemed impressed nonetheless. Won't do it again, however. WAY too much trouble.

Found this easy to make, especially if dough well chilled. I wasn't sure how big a 'small' pineapple was, so just used one of the larger available, but would add more next time as a bit on the sweet side, but still delicious. Dough was light and flaky - very nice.

These take a bit of time but are worth the effort. They're pretty to look at and have a delicate flavor. To cut down on problems with stickiness make sure none of the filling leaks through the dough. We put at most a 1/2 tablespoon in each and that was all they could hold (we had half the filling left over--for a cake perhaps? :).

The dough and filling are really tasty, but the dough is incredibly sticky. There's no way i could roll the balls in my hand, so I flattened the dough out and cut the circles, but had to use so much powdered sugar on my board that after filling them I couldn't get the dough to stick. Also, a tablespoon is WAY too much filling. More like 1/2 teaspoon. Then the balls pretty much just "exploded in the oven, spilling gooey pineapple all over the place. I'm an experienced cook and while it tastes good, this is a horrible recipe to try to execute.

I lived in Singapore as a girl and these were a childhood favorite. Our Chinese neighbor made them every New Year and I loved them! This recipe is authenic and easy to follow. Takes a bit of practice to shape and fill them-I ended up shaping a circular disk of dough in my palm into a cup, filling it, and then pinching off the top before adding the clove "stem". Thanks for the recipe, my kids loved them and I'm thrilled to re-create a forgotten favorite.

This was really tasty and pretty easy too. I only had about a half of a medium pineapple, so I halved the dough and added a 1/2 cup or so of sweetened coconut shreds to the filling. Somehow I made way fewer pastries (like only 16) but it was the perfect ratio of dough to filling. The finished product is really cute, and the pastry looks golden and crackly.
