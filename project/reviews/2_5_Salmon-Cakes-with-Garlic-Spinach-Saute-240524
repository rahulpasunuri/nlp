Thins sucks. Even adding an egg and chilling for hours, these cakes disintegrated. Well, half did. 3 fell apart, ad three held. So, no sure what to do. But, there are better salmon cake recipes. I added 1tsp of barley malt to the sauce to cut the salt, and used kale rather than spinach for a heartier meal.

I used leftover salmon from a large fillet I had grilled on the bbq. I added a cilantro/dill/chive chopped mixture and I added 1/4 cup of egg white. It made for an excellent lunch with a salad.

Added some chopped cilantro and celery as well as a grated radish and carrot. Added a dash of Siracha. Omitted curry powder. Added egg as suggested.

I echo the call for a binding agent, but recommend perhaps one egg white instead of a whole egg so as to not become a fritter rather than a cake.

Once I saw the meat that I was supposed to make into patties, I immediately went to reviews. Thank you all out there! I then, of course, added 1 beaten egg. To the sauce, I added hot sesame oil. It seemed odd to me to add curry to something that is going to have a soy based sauce but it works. I didn't measure the curry but i know I put in more than they called for.

Very tasty and easy weeknight meal. I added 1/4 cup minced red onion, 1/4 cup finely chopped cilantro, 1 beaten egg, 1 T. lime juice, and 1/4 t coriander to the salmon, and upped the curry powder to 3/4 t. I put the cakes in the fridge for ~10 minutes while I made the sauce (added 1/2 T lime juice); cakes held together fine, but I'd have liked them a bit firmer / crisper. Next time I will make 8 smaller cakes instead of 4 larger ones.

I liked this recipe, but it could use a little more herbs and spices in the mix. I used fresh salmon that I poached for about 5 minutes. I didn't have any problem with the cakes falling apart, but canned salmon might act differently than fresh. I added some parsley and more curry powder and I used fresh ginger instead of dry, but the sauce was too one dimensional, only salty. With some work this could be a good recipe.

I also used an egg to bind the ingredients. I substituted minced ginger for the curry powder. I also added chopped onions, parsley, and lemon juice. I will definitely make again! *To prevent crumbling- place the patties in the fridge for 20 min before cooking.

I forgot to mention, after reading others reviews about the cakes falling apart, I added one beaten egg to the mixture. Worked fine and held together perfectly.

This was a good way to make canned salmon. I doubled the dipping sauce and added extra scallions. I used plain bread crumbs and white rice.

Whoever wrote this recipe should be banned from cooking... the cakes fell apart COMPLETELY, leaving me with some sort of sauteed salmon mush. Who ever thought of making this recipe without including a binding agent!? Well, at least the spinach was good.

One of my favorite quick & healthy meals. Cakes can be a little loose, but the flavor is great, especially with some additional scallions & lemon juice (might try lime juice next time).

Flavor was good-ish. Cakes just fell apart though, and I even added an egg because I was concerned about the lack of binder.

After reading the comments below, I added 1 Tablespoon of flour to the fish juice and mixed with a good fresh curry mix. I didn't have any bread crumbs handy, so I used oat bran instead. Then I drizzled a little lime oil over the cooked cakes. Delicious.

yuck. this recipe went right in the trash. Cakes didn't hold their form AT ALL & I ended up just mixing the pieces with leftover steamed veggies.

This was ok. I had to add some lime juice to add some flavor to the salmon cake. I think it needs more of a binding factor because the cake kept breaking up.

I thought it looked too easy to be good, but I was wrong, my husband and I both loved it. I'd add more curry next time, but I think the curry we find here in Bastia is milder than curry you typically buy in America. I'm not sure. We used regular soy sauce because that's what we had, and it was way to salty and completely overpowered the taste of the salmon cakes. my husband suggested cutting it with some juice next time. also, we used fresh salmon instead of canned and just added a little olive oil to the mixture and it worked perfectly.
