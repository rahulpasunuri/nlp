My husband, 1 1/2 yr old son and I LOVED this! So simple, and tasted WONDERFUL--husband thought I must have used butter to make taste so great...I doubled the thyme and loaded on the salt...used red skinned potatoes

An easy and tasty side dish. Sara Moulton prepared this on cooking live, but used fresh rosemary, which tastes much better. Don't forgo the salt! And use red potatoes.

This is fine, but plain and not gourmet. I would recommend quartering the potatoes and "skillet-crusting" more than one side in order to increase the flavor and crispiness.

This is a great technique, suitable for various seasonings. Last night I made this for the 2nd time and added curry powder and seasoned salt to the oil in the pan. Turned out great!

I saw the recipe made on the show. I had to try it, but did not have fresh thyme. I used dried parsley and the flavor was fabulous. This is now a regular recipe in our home.

My husband and son refused to eat more than a few bites because they disliked the taste of the fresh thyme. I enjoyed it.
