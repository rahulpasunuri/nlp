This was very tasty. No need to roll the crust out to 15" -- that's a waste, 12" should be plenty. I used baby shitakes which was probably a mistake, they didn't have much flavor. Still everyone loved it so I might make it again.

love it love it love it!!!! I keep making this and it gets better. I double up on everything and make a tall crust (makes it look more fun). Everyone loves it everytime I make it

I love this and use it as a staple for almost any Sunday afternoon or cocktail party. Do yourself a favor and use puff pastry as the crust. Fantastic and a time saver!!

This is definitely one of the most fattening dishes I've made, but it was DELICIOUS!!! The only change I made was to use 1/2 cup whole wheat flour with 1 cup all purpose flour, which I highly recommend. The rustic flour goes well with the earthy mushrooms. I think I'll serve this as an appetizer next time I have a dinner party, but I will use individual tart pans and serve each tart on a bed of mixed greens. Divine.

I made this for a brunch along with three other tarts/quiches and it was a major hit -- gone in a flash. The combination of shiitakes and goat cheese is excellent, but the garlic really brings together the flavors (with subtlety). I can't wait to make it again.

Made this for Easter breakfast, and it was just delicious!!! It took great restraint from everyone not to finish all of it that morning. The flavours work so well together, and the crust is tasty too. This tart, must be done in steps but not too difficult. Definitely will make it again!

Heavenly! This is an EXCELLENT recipe. Don't change a thing. The crust is perfect. I'd use it for other recipes from now on. Pretty easy to make too!

Everyone loved it. It does take a long time to make, especially the cream topping. It says to stir occasionally....I would say every 2 minutes at least. The milk cuts if you aren't careful.....mine took a little longer to bake after putting the mushrooms and cream. My crust came out perfect. I think because of sheer luck. But what I did was bake it the first 2 times at 350 instead of 375 (it may depend on your oven. The 3rd time I did do it at 375. Came out wonderful!!!!

Excellent recipe! I added asparagus to the mushrooms & it complimented the dish well. The crust is very good, but mine was a bit too soft. Next time I will bake it longer, before adding the toppings. I also added freshly grated parm. regiano to the top right before baking. Looking forward to making this great recipe again!

This dish has become one of our standards. It's so versatile--wonderful for dinner with a simple green salad, a terrific accompaniment to roast meats, the perfect brunch entree--and so simple. This is the recipe most frequently requested by our guests. What did we do without it? The only change we sometimes make is to use an herbed chevre--makes an already great dish even better. Enjoy!

This is a wonderful recipe! I was very short on time and so I used Pillsbury pie crust sheets which fit perfectly into a tart pan and are really quite good. I used a mixture of mushrooms and asparagus, but I imagine you can use almost anything you like in this tart. The goat cheese spread on the bottom definitely makes a statement without being overpowering, such as in Herb and Goat Cheese Tart (Gourmet, July 1997). Garnish the dish and you have a very nice first course.

I cheated & used a frozen pie crust. Also, I had no mushrooms & subbed asparagus - it was a huge hit!! Very easy too! Next time I would brown the pie crust a bit first
