i like a really hard biscotti that can hold up to coffee, this is not it. its way to crumbly and soft; and too sweet for my taste. if i would ever make it again, i would cut out the butter, maybe leave a tablespoon or 2 (typical biscotti has no fat in it) and i would reduce the sugar in the batter to 3/4 or 1/2 a cup. if you prefer a crumbly and very sweet biscotti this is the cookie for you.

SO FABULOUS!!!!! I made these for the holiday gifts we gave to my family. They were a hit!!! I made them froze them. The only problem was that it didn't make as many as I want - people loved these. FABULOUS!!!

I have been making this recipe for years and it is always a big hit. I add a handful or two of dried cranberries or dried cherries. I also sprinkles some cinnamon sugar ontopof the loaf before baking.

works every time...i like to put the cinnamon sugar on top of the dough before the first baking, because it makes a nice crackly-looking crust as the dough expands and bakes.

I had the same experience with a super-crumbly dough. I followed the proportions for another biscotti recipe that I knew worked and all was well. I added another egg to the mixture, which worked very well. I also decreased the cooking time to 30 minutes at 325 degrees in a convection oven. Very, very tasty!

The dough on this recipe is way too dry and crumb-like in texture. I found it impossible to shape into logs and ended up putting it back in the mixer and adding another edd yolk. Cookies turned out crumbly. Will not make again although the flavour was delish.

I used the real recipe (times and all) and it came out the way biscotti should come out (crunchy!) So if you want soft biscotti then lower the times, if you want REAL biscotti, then make sure that you use the times noted!

delicious...i reduced both cooking times as well, and sprinkled the cinnamon sugar on each loaf before they were baked instead of after they were sliced. the dough expands and the cinnamon sugar makes a crackly sort of crust on top.

Rating: 4
perfect. very classic biscotti taste. I did however adjust the times. for the first bake I went for 35 minutes, cut them while they were hot, and for the second bake, only did 15 minutes. A very simple and yummy biscotti recipe, and I will for sure make these again. I drizzled mine with melted white chocolate. SO GOOD.

I made this last night with some modifications - I added an extra tsp. of cinnamon, and an extra egg as I couldn't get the dough sticky enough. Most of my other biscotti recipes call for 2 eggs + yolk in the dough. I also adjusted the cooking times/temperature as suggested. It came out great with those modifications.

I am giving this recipe two forks because of the directions. Very simple biscotti, however, the cooking times are completely off. Unfortunately, I was busy doing something else as these were cooking. I now have very dark and crispy cookies. I normally read the reviews, but didn't on this one, my bad. 30-35 on the first bake and 10 minutes on the second. Yes, I would make them again because we enjoy the cinnamon-sugar flavor.

Rating: 2
The dough wouldn't hold together, so I turned it out and kneaded it, and forced it into logs. It baked well, with the time modifications suggested below, and tasted fine, but if I'm going for a cinnamon-sugar taste, toast is much easier! If I'm looking for biscotti, there are other prettier, tastier options.

Rating: 3
I thought these were very good and easy to prepare. I cut the baking times down as suggested by others to 30 min the first bake and 15 for the second. Also I sprinkled the sugar mix on one sheet of cookies and left it off of the other. There was no big flavor difference so I will leave it off completely in the future.

This is my kids favorite biscotti recipe. At our house biscotti is for Christmas gifts and they like to give this to teachers, etc. I agree that the shorter cooking times are a must especially if children will be eating it.

Rating: 2
Fifty minutes is definitely too long for the first bake. My biscotti turned out very hard, almost impossible to bite without dunking in coffee. I would try again, baking 30 minutes, and another 15 minutes after slicing, turning once during baking. I thought the sprinkled sugar was unnecessary as these are very sweet for biscotti. Also, the recipe says it should yield about 40 - I only got about 20.

Rating: 2
The taste was good and certainly easy to prepare, but I was not impressed. The biscotti spread as it should, but did not rise as with others I have made.

This simple biscotti is so good! It's like cinnamon toast but better. It really goes well with a cup of coffee.

Rating: 4
It was easy to make & while it is baking, I was free to mix another batch of cookies (Christmas!). I am not sure if this made a difference, but I used Vietnamese cinnamon. The aroma & taste were divine. Good for dunking in hot chocolate, or coffee...

If you like cinnamon toast, tea and cookies by the fire or cookies that are interesting but not too sweet, then this cookie is for you. It's more of an adult cookie than a decadent kid-friendly cookie since it is crunchy rather than chewy. Don't let the logs cool for too long before cutting since they harden fairly quickly.

Rating: 4
The biscotti was not beautiful to look at, but tated great.

Rating: 4
So good. I agree, cook only 40 minutes and then 15. The perfect hostess gift for people with kids or when you don't really know what flavors they like; you can't go wrong here. FYI-this only made about 24 cookies (around 1/2 inch thick...maybe a little thicker) so double if you need the 40 it claims to make.

I've given them as gifts to rave reviews.

Based on other reviews I thought these would be great, but these were rather underwhelming. There are so many other recipes that make stand out biscotti, I won't make again. Oh, 40 minutes was more than enough time for the 1st bake.

Excellent recipe! I've never made Biscotti before and was really pleased with the results! No problems with the length of cooking time or with crumbling cookies, either. My family loved this type of cookie and I'm now searching for more wonderful recipes.

Great recipe and easy to make. All of my coworkers enjoyed these and many asked for the recipe! I did bake for only 40 minutes the first time and that worked out well. I think 50 minutes would have been too long.

I've never made biscotti before but decided to make them this year for the holidays. This recipe was so easy and so fabulous.Everyone wanted the recipe! I've made many cookies but these were the biggest hit and the simplest to make. Another great recipe from this website!

Made what seemed to be thousands of these for gifts this year. I like them because they are plain and appeal to all tastes. I substitued Amaretto for the vanilla and found it superior. I also baked the dough for only 40 min on the first baking. I found mine to be sufficently cooked by then to cut. Do cut while still warm or you'll have a heck of a time sawing through them.

I don't see how it could get any easier than these. Simple and delicious.

This was the first biscotti I have made that actually spread while it was baking. I might try baking it for a shorter time the first time because I always have problems with crumbling when I slice it.

This was my first attempt at biscotti and I was very happy with the results. I dipped them in dark chocolate instead of using cinnamon and sugar and I reduced my oven temp to 300. I also used fresh nutmeg. Very adaptable, I will add nuts next time.

Really great recipe! I made a few changes though; the person i made them for doesn't like cinnamon, so I eliminated the cinnamon, replaced the vanilla with a teaspoon of almond extract and added 1 1/4 cups of sliced almonds. They were delicious!

Very easy and delicious. I also shortened my baking time. Makes a great gift, too.

Although the honey, anise and almond biscotti is my favorite, this turned out well also, the second time! I found it did not spead so I formed it the width I wanted and about half the height. It then turned out fabulous- got great reviews when I brought it up North. I also followed the oter reviews and bakd it initially only 40 minutes.

Rating: 2
I made these cookies but the dough came out crumbly and I had to press it together with my hands to form the logs. It took a long time and was difficult and when I baked them they came out like rocks. I followed the recipie to the letter so I don't know what went wrong and although they were very hard they had a good taste to them. I would only make this again to see if comes out any different otherwise I would never make it again.

Rating: 4
These are the best biscotti I've made so far! I reduced the baking time to 35-40 min & 10 min respectively. I added 2 whole eggs & skipped the egg wash step. I also added 1 cup of almond slices to the dry ingredients & piped melted raspberry chocolate onto the finished product. I will definitely use this as a reference recipe on which to make many variations. Great base recipe!!

Very simple recipe. Much improved by adding 1 cup pecan pieces to dry ingredients before adding to wet, I would also recommend shortening the baking time to 40 minutes and then 10.

First time biscotti maker and make the double chocolate ones as well. I thought that these were very easy and my husband loved them

A good "kid-friendly" biscotti recipe (no anise, etc., and nice dipped in hot chocolate). I made them to mail to my brother's family along with the Double Chocolate kind, and they were well received.

Rating: 1
Somehow adjectives in other reviews like jawbreakers don't merit 4 forks. I thought these were much too dry, chalky and dense. I followed the recipe as written, cutting down the baking time would probably have helped. As far as I am concerned there are too many other good biscotti recipes to try this one again.

Rating: 4
These are terrific! So easy and a bit different than most biscotti recipies, even my fiance will eat them (and he does not like biscotti). 50 minutes, however, is far too long to bake the dough - I would shoot for about 35 and then about 10 with the sugar on. Mine came out great this way!

Excellent, easy recipe. I did 2 recipes of this and used 3 whole eggs instead of 2 eggs and 2 egg yolks. Worked out fine!

Rating: 3
These were very good. I took the advice of other reviewers and baked mine for 25 min. This was the perfect amount of time. Then after slicing I baked for about 10 more min. My cookies would have been bullets had I followed the baking times as printed in this recipe. I did accidentally add 2 extra tablespoons of butter and stirred in all the cinnamon. This did not affect the outcome. I'll definitely make these again.

These are great - I love them for breakfast or dessert - anytime I'm drinking coffee!

I agree with the reviews about cooking less than 50 min. 35 min is usually ok and they don't turn out so hard. I have mixed up the recipe eliminating some of the cinnamon and adding espresso powder and chocolate chips, or adding dried apricots and macadamia nuts--all excellent and disappear FAST!!

I thought that these were delicious. As per the review below, I baked them for 35 mins and then an additional 10 minutes. They can be eaten without dunking them if you follow the shorter cooking times.

Do not bake these for 50 minutes - we are talking serious teeth-breakers. I baked for 35 minutes, cut them and re-toasted for an additional 10 minutes. They were plenty hard. I have made these 3 times now. Everyone loves them. I have NEVER brushed the egg on top, nor have I sugared them. They are perfect. I am a chocoholic - but (gasp) I did not care for them dipped in milk chocolate (it overpowered the cinnamon flavor). One batch made 2 'logs' that both fit down the length of one cookie sheet on parchment paper. They have never run into one another.

Rating: 4
I followed the recipe, not changing anything and this makes great biscotti! Rave reviews from everyone. Next time I would make the logs thicker, so the biscotti ends up longer. I will also be drizzling chocolate on the next batch.

The first time I made this recipe, I did as written and thought it was a very good basic recipe. I made it again for a dinner party and decided to dress it up a little by drizzling the finished biscotti with melted white chocolate and reserving the cinnamon sugar until the end at which point it adhered to the chocolate. Rave reviews!

This was extremely easy to make and was a huge hit at my house! After buying store bought biscotti I was disappointed so I decided to try my hand at home-made and I was not disappointed. I do have to say, the dough was too soft to mold into logs but was easy enough to pour onto the cookie sheet in a rough log shape. Absolutely delicious!
