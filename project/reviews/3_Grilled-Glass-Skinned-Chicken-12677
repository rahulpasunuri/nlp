This was delicious! I was looking for something to make using the boneless, skinless chicken breasts I had recently thawed, so I decided to try this. I just marinated them overnight and grilled from there. I also made the raja and (my)guacamole and served with corn tortillas. What a wonderful combination! The next time (and there will definitely be a next time!), I will plan ahead and use chicken as it is called for in the recipe. Although the boneless, skinless chix breasts were definitely worthy!

I'm surprised more people have not tried or reviewed this recipe! It is wonderful! I used ground achiote instead of going thru the process of soaking the seeds for 2 hours. I used a mild New Mexico red chile powder, as I couldn't find ground ancho powder. I also did not read the recipe far enough in advance so did not have time to cool the chicken down completely before grilling...went right from the oven to the grill. It was still fantastic. The skin is great, and even the parts that look burnt don't taste it. The recado would be great with pork too! I will be making this often.

The recado was a delicious marinade, I think I didn't grill the chicken long enough though. I didn't get the little carbonized bits I was looking forward to. but that's my fault not the recipe. I will definatly try again maybe next time with chicken pieces.
