Yummy! This will make it into my rotation! In order to save money I cut 3 breasts (boneless and skinless) into cutlets for the 5 of us. It came together quickly and I was able to get the rice and roasted carrots done all at the same time. I might try cutting the brown sugar to 1 tbsp as the sauce was sweet, but my 11 and 13 year old kids loved it as-is! I zested a whole orange and candied the remaining peel for my 13 year old, as she frequently asks for Epi's pretzel crusted pork chop with candied orange peel recipe for dinner. The pork is good, but she loves the candied orange peel!

Very easy and delicious, made a few minor changes. I used boneless chicken thighs and cut them into strips, they are more moist than breats for the little ones. I used dijon musturd, and added 1TB of apricot jam and a ts of corn starch to thicken the sauce. My 8 yr old wants it for breakfast this morning.

Loved the flavors of this -- we had with potato salad but would be great over rice. I did put zucchini and mushrooms in as well and used Russian mustard rather than dry. It was big hit and my partner is still talking about it which is what makes it a 4 fork recipe! And it was quick and easy to make. To the cook who found the orange made it bitter -- you probably got some of the pith in the zest.

Pretty good. I improvised a little--added a minced clove of garlic, a few dashes of ground coriander, and a couple of tablespoons of mirin (sweetened sake). Also, I added some sauteed broccoli spears so the woman of the house would give it her blessing.

I've made this using tofu and chicken. Both versions taste great. I added some garlic, soy sauce, and chili sauce(sriracha) to give the orange sauce some more kick.

This was quick, easy and delish. I skipped the butter and the orange peel. Other reviews said to use fresh oj, but I used regular store bought and it tasted fine. I also added some chopped garlic and red pepper flakes for an added kick. Will definitely make again.

This was a great weeknight dish, definetly will make it again, I did a few adjustments though. Used grapeseed oil instead of the butter olive combo. Added a clove of garlic, used dijon instead of dry mustard and only 1 tsp brown sugar. cooked the chicken first and set it aside, then cooked the onions with some red bell peppers and snap peas, added the chicken to this pan and then, wisked together the OJ, peel, ginger, garlic, mustard, sugar and a bit of soy sauce in a seperate bowl and poored it over the chicken and veggies in the pan. This created a great glazy sauce. Served over steamed jasmine rice topped with some toasted almond slivers as garnish to add extra crunch. The whole thing was ready in 30 minutes and tasted amazing! Next time I will add a bit of heat with some chilli or something.

My husband, my 10 year old and I all loved this recipe. I made it as written except I only used one cup of orange juice and I made it with six drumsticks and only one breast, because my husband and son like drumsticks better. It did take longer to brown the drumsticks, but everything else was the same. Leftovers (what little there were) were great too.

Rating: 4
I rated this four forks after I made some adjustments to the recipe. I've made this three times now and I think I finally created the perfect recipe for this. First thing; before cooking, cut the breast meat into 1 1/2 inch pieces. In a large bowl combine the green onion, 5 cloves minced garlic, two tablespoons of soy sauce, and two tablespoons of Mae Ploy or similar sweet asian chili sauce. Cover, and let marinate in the fridge for an hour or up to 4 hours. Then follow the recipe as directed EXCEPT add half the ginger and orange peels and only fresh OJ. Just for fun I added some mushrooms to the sauce after adding the OJ and they cooked wonderfully! Served with properly cooked Jasmine rice.

I halved the recipe as I was just making this for two people and added zucchini and red bell pepper. You could probably throw in any veggies you want. It was just a little too bitter from the orange peel I think next time I will use about half as much. Fresh OJ is a must. If you want a slightly thicker sauce you can add a little corn starch to it to thicken. Yum!

I don't know what I did... but I thought this was gross... my boyfriend thought it was ok, but I thought it was very sweet and tangy, very liquidy, and the combination was not a good one.

I had a bunch of clementines and always have ginger on hand, so this recipe was perfect! I hand-squeezed the clementines and wouldn't imagine using store-bought OJ in it's place. I cut my chicken into small cuts, and honestly had a hard time not eating them all as the glaze was reducing. ;) It was a wonderful recipe! I'll definitely use it again!

We made this the first time by the recipe and it was great, the kids inhaled it too (always a bonus). The second time we replaced the brown sugar with a bit of sugar and about a tsp of molasses because we were out of the brown and added a bit extra garlic and a pinch of chipotle chili powder and it was even better. The recipe doubles nicely as well.

Rating: 3
This is an excellent, fast recipe. I cut the chicken in 1-2 inch pieces, omitted the brown sugar, cut the orange juice back a bit (MUST use fresh!), added spicy apricot preserves, a couple of garlic cloves, a few drops of Asian chili oil to the sauce, used safflower oil instead of olive oil/butter combo - better for Asian-style cuisine. Stir-fried some veggies, tossed all together over rice and garnished with toasted sesame seeds. Great when served, great lunch-overs!

Excellent. My husband, the picky eater, loved it! I did make a couple of changes (1 purposely and 1 inadvertently) I didn't want to buy dried mustard so I used what I had on hand - dijon mustard. I thought the recipe said use 4 tbls of ginger instead of 4 tsp. :) It's a good thing that we love ginger around here. Any way, I got the thumbs up and will be making this again for dinner.

I have made this dish many times. It is delicious and not overly sweet. Make sure to use fresh orange juice. I cut up the chicken into bite size pieces, add some veggies and serve with brown rice. Sometimes to jazz it up a little I add chili-garlic sauce or red pepper flakes. I have made it with the full 2 cups of juice and also with less. It is good both ways.

This has become a weeknight standard at our house. I usually cut up the chicken and serve it with rice or orzo. Adding some hot red pepper flakes balances out the sweetness of the orange juice nicely as well.

I used boneless skinless breast halves, and it worked very well. Make sure you have very fresh OJ on hand. I'm going to try this again with fresh squeezed. Overall a quick and very interesting alternative to my usual Italian preparations. The leftovers were delicious in a salad - the orange & ginger flavors really permeate the meat. Excellent!

No quite as flavorful as I'd hoped for, but still it was pretty tasty! Even my picky 7-year old ate it!

Will definitely make again!

I really liked this dish and so did my boyfriend. I'd definately make it again. I cut the orange juice to 1.5 cups as recommended my other reviewers and added some soy sauce, but I almost wish I hadn't cut the orange juice in the end. My boyfriend doesn't usually like "fruity" dishes, but he enjoyed this one a lot. I thought it was easy to make and really tasty for the amount of effort I put into it. I served it with jasmine rice and white wine, and I think it went well together.

Very tasty and easy. Following the advice of previous reviewers, I made sure to use full pulp o.j. and added about 1/8 tsp of ground cayenne and clove of minced garlic for extra kick. I topped the pieces with a few sliced almonds and it added a nice finish.

Loved this dish, but am glad I read the reviews first as I made some modifications: 1. added a drop or two of chili oil with the butter and oil, 2. used almost two pounds of sliced boneless, skinless breasts, 3. added some blanched carrots and broccoli, 4. added a little white wine, soy and apple cider vinegar (highly recommended to add a little tartness)

It's quite good for quick food. The next time I make it, though, I'll make sure the orange juice has lots of pulp just to give some more oomph to the recipe.

Pretty good after modifications. Like everyone else says, don't use so much OJ. I used 1 1/4 cups and it was great. I used honey instead of brown sugar and only used 1/2 tablespoon. I also used Grey Poupon style mustard because I did not have dried mustard. I used cubes of chicken tenderloin that were put in an egg and crushed red pepper wash before dusted with flour to give it a little most zest. Also, I added some carrots and broccoli about two minutes before the chicken to give it more variety. You can see a photo here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/nekosukidmb/218009752/

For all those with a problem of too much OJ, remove the chicken and let the OJ boil down to the consistency you want. It cooks down quickly, in about 7 minutes on high.

A pretty darn good recipe! I did a few modifications though. It seemed like it would be a little bland as is, so I reduced the orange juice to half and added 1 minced garlic clove, 1 TBS Oyster Sauce and 3 TBS Soy Sauce. It added the flavor I was hoping for. Try it!

Rating: 3
It sounded from the reviews that the sauce from this recipe was too watery so I made some substitutions. I eliminated the orange rind and sugar and subsituted 4 tablespoons of marmalade. I substituted two heaping tablespoons of grey poupon country mustard for the dry mustard and cut the OJ in half. I added about a half a cup of chicken broth and kicked it up a notch with about a teaspoon of red pepper flakes and 2 teaspoons of garlic instead of the green onions. Right before serving, I added a tablespoon of chopped fresh parsley. The result was a thick and delicious sauce and very tender chicken. I'd definitely make this again!

AWESOME! I served this with Pad Thai (a packaged mix), and Cucumber, Mustard & Dill Salad (see this site--it's a deceptively simple, delicious recipe). I cranked this recipe up a bit by adding 2 cloves of minced garlic with the ginger and 1/2 Tbls of red pepper flakes with the OJ and zest. I cut back the OJ and zest to be the juice (about 1/3 cup), and zest (about 1 tsp.), of one orange. I added 1 cup of chicken boullion to make up for some missing OJ. --still less liquid than the recipe calls for. Another change... I sliced 5 boneless chicken breasts to stretch it a bit. I served this to my daughter, she's a senior in HS, and five of her friends, with ginger tea and the Cucumber, Mustard and Dill Salad and steamed broccoli. They loved it.

I also cut the orange juice to 1 cup, then added 1/2 cup apricot preserves and simmered. There wasn't a lot of sauce, just enough to moisten the chicken. It was more like the shiny orange chicken you see in restaurants. Don't skip the ginger or the dry mustard, you'll love the zing!

This was delicious, but I should have listened to the previous reviewers. Definetely cut down on the OJ as it is a little overpowering. I'm sure 1 cup, and some water added would have been much better. That having been said it was a very good recipe.

I varied the recipe based on other reviews and it was great - comparable to a restaurant dish! I used 3 TBL olive oil and 1 TBL butter to saute the chicken (boneless, skinless), reduced the O.J. to 1 cup and added 1/2 cup water to lighten the orange flavor even more. Added 2 cloves minced garlic with the ginger, omitted the peel, then thickened it at the end with a soy/cornstarch mixture. I think the soy & ginger are the keys to the great flavor. The soy added sweet & salt to balance out the zing from the ginger and garlic. Next time I'll add julienned carrots and I'd like to try it with lemon instead of orange. Definitely a keeper!

Rating: 4
This was delicious. I used regular mustard, since I wanted that zing, but didn't have dry mustard. Also, cut chicken into chunks, and reduced OJ to about 1.5 cups. Delicious! I thought it was as good as some dishes I've had like this in restaurants. I have to comment, the ginger is a main ingredient, I don't know why someone would ever omit.

Rating: 3
made this as per cook from Farfield's suggestions, added 1 T cornstarch and 1 T soy sauce, would probably reduce to 1/2 T of each but still really good. Great recipe for playing with could omit ginger replace with shallots and add some tarragon? Also did the chicken in the oven as I have a newborn and can't be at the stove for long periods of time.

Really good and easy to make. I substituted Lemon zest for the orange peel - gave everything a really nice tangy flavor that's a little different than the straight orange flavoring.

I have made this many times. I thought the amount of OJ was too much so each time I make it, after sauteeing the chicken, I take the OJ, ginger, brown sugar, dry mustard, orange peel and a spoonful of flour and whisk it together. Remove the chicken, add the OJ mixture and cook for about 5-7 minutes. The sauce is very smooth and thickened and the flour cuts down on the acidity of the OJ. Add the chicken to the sauce and top with green onions. We like to have enough sauce for the chicken and rice. It's better to have more sauce than not enough.

Rating: 4
We loved this recipe. I followed some of the suggestions posted by other reviewers -- I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into bite-sized pieces, cut back on the OJ by about half (I used about a cup and a quarter), and I used chives instead of green onions (that's all I had). Served w/ steamed broccoli and basmati rice. My 15-month old son gobbled it up! Definitely a keeper in my house.

As a college student, good meals that cook quickly and easily (as well as cheaply!) are musts- and this meal is all of that.

Some modifications due to what was readily available. Used 1 cup OJ (wanted sauce/not soup). I happen to be a big fan of ginger so I didn't use the suggestions of others with the garlic. Used dried hot mustard instead to give a punch to such a sweet recipe. Added soy sauce and cornstarch to reduce/thicken the sauce. Didn't have the green onions. Also substituted chicken breasts with skinless thighs. This recipe was a 'yum yum' and my kid went bonkers over it. So would i make it again.... definitely!

I'm not fond of fruit/sweet and meat, but this was GREAT! It wasn't too sweet at all! Though, I did take the advice and cut the sugar in half, and used half juice half colombard wine.

It's a keeper in my house. Last night's version - as others suggested: I dipped it in beaten egg, did 50/50 garlic and ginger, half the amount of oj, dried red pepper flakes in oj mix and when sauce was thickening, added 1 Tbsp corn starch with TBSP soy sauce and returned chicken to misture. Also cut chicken in smaller pieces - lots of ways to make this dish! Sesame seeds or nuts at end might be nice.

Needs some work, but this dish has great potential. I had it for dinner and my husband had it as leftovers. He raved about it and polished off all the leftovers I had in the fridge.

I'm a novice cook and didn't expect this to turn out as well as it did--simply delicious. Taking the advice of another cook, I put the chicken in an egg-wash and then battered them with the flour.

Simplistic, not interesting. Not worth the work, esp. squeezing 2 cups of orange juice. Bitter taste was slightly present in cheickn breasts, not at all in the skinless chicken thighs that I also used. Another advantage re: dark meat: it takes longer to cook and gives the flour a chance to cook completely and thicken the sauce. Adding salt to the flour ahead of time and some freshly ground white pepper as chicken cooked improved it slightly.

Rating: 3
Tasted delicious! I didn't use anywhere near as much butter as the recipe called for...I actually just used a teaspoon of margerine in a non-stick skillet and everything went fine. The thick glaze/sauce gave a great visual presentation too. Garnished with mint and orange zest and we were good to go...

I hate reviewing recipes that I've changed dramatically, but please excuse me in this instance. I like spice, so I followed the suggestion of using the egg wash with chili oil. I then dredged chicken tenderloins (what I had in the freezer) in flour mixed with salt, pepper and a bit of cayenne. This made the breading a little thicker. Also, I used a non-stick pan and cut back on some of the fat. I had to toss in a few minced garlic cloves. Based on previous reviews, I used 1 c. oj, but ended up adding more as the sauce simmered. I thickened it with cornstarch mixed with soy sauce at the end as suggested by another reviewer. I thought the dish turned out great - and the chicken was very tender. My version reminded me of a lighter version of General Tsao's chicken (minus the fat and salt).

This was a great, quick meal. I used the suggestion of using skinless chicken with an egg and chili oil dredge. I really think that little added heat made a big difference. Next time I will add garlic and a bit more ginger. Husband said it's a keeper.

I used all fresh ginger and garlic to see the difference. The ginger was strong. A little stronger than I'd have liked it. And I cut my chicken into small strips. Next time I will used pre-processed ginger and garlic, and cut back on the amount of ginger. And I'd like it spicier but I'm not quite sure how to achieve that yet. It was nice to see the meal come together.

This dish is excellent, however I made a few changes: I only had boneless, skinless chicken, so I dredged it in an egg and chili oil mixture, then flour. I used an orange flavored oil instead of veg. oil and I cut the amount of O.J. to 1.25 cups. Also, I added chopped garlic with the ginger--absolutely delish! Served it with brown rice and cooked carrots. Will definitely make it again!

Here's a sure way to make this dish out of this world. (My picky 5th grader loved it!) Omit the oil and just use the butter. When you add the ginger (use med-low heat) also add 2-3 cloves of garlic, minced. Do not brown the ginger or garlic. If you do, start over. I cooked the chicken as directed and it came out wonderful. Very nice golden crispy crust that didn't get soggy in the sauce. For the sauce, I omitted the orange peel b/c I only had dried orange peel and I feared it would overpower the sauce. Maybe not. Use 1 1/2 cups OJ instead of 2, bring the sauce to a rolling boil and then maintain a very low boil until thickened. I didn't have green onions either, so I omitted them, but they'd probably be tasty. Finish cooking the chicken in the sauce as directed. Wonderful!

Rating: 3
I loved this recipe, although I used shallots instead of green onions the second time around, and kept the heat lower than the recipe. I also made a quick salad of a naval orange, spinach, and fennel, and used some of the sauce with it. (Doing this while letting the sauce thicken passes the time better, and gets rid of the excess sauce.) It was a fantastic accompaniment! The chicken is great with couscous (Especially if you add a touch of orange peel to it), and if you really want to get carried away, orange bread too.

Rating: 3
I would not use the 2 cups of OJ that's recommended; I think I used maybe a cup- if you use 2 cups I think it would end much too watery. I used 1 t. Dijon mustard instead of dried mustard and I thought it was fine, especially since I'm not a huge mustard fan. The sauce also need more than the recommended time to thicken. W/ thes alterations a great recipe.

It helps to turn the oven temp to med-low before adding ginger...mine burned the first time I attempted this recipe, and I had to start over making the sauce. Save time and turn it down!

I agree with the last reviewer 100% I followed the recipe to the letter except for using ground ginger instead of fresh.

I made this in December pretty much as is, and we thought it wasn't all that tasty and was very bitter. This time, I made some changes in the method, and now my husband raved, and I was satisfied. We used boneless skinless chicken thighs cut into bite-sized pieces, sprinkled w/salt, pepper, and cornstarch instead of flour (better for the sauce later on); stir-fryed until fully cooked, with 3 cloves garlic, minced, and the ginger in the oil. Removed all, added the mustard powder, brown sugar (I agree, had to end up using more to cut the bitterness of the OJ), and some Chinese chilli sauce, then the OJ (skipped the peel). I let the sauce reduce a lot while I made a spicy-sesame Korean spinach dish and white rice, then added the chicken and the scallions (really a highlight of this dish) back to the reduced sauce and just boiled to coat. Overall, very good!

A New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc was just perfect with the meal!

I thought that this dish was delicious and very easy to make. I found the sauce to be a bit on the sour side.
