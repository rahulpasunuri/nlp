We made this for Thanksgiving. First, the pork is amazing. Utterly delicious, flavorful, moist and perfect for fancypants dinners. The presentation was lovely (once we looked up how to tie it together correctly). We bought our cuts at Costco. We will make this again and again. The stuffing was a HUGE disappointment. It was basically thrown away. The flavor was great but it was like eating a bowl of bread crumbs. It needs more eggs and stock. There HAS to be an error in this recipe because it turned out that off.

I've made this several times--and have a few points regarding the recipe--and the comments to date. Starting with the fact that I'd describe the recipe for the stuffing as a starting point--by all means dress it up if you feel so inclined. I've added--a can of Mexi-Corn (purists may shudder at something so plebian--but it's a tasty addition here.) Another time, I added chopped, cooked bacon and minced red and yellow pepper. To the reviewer who noted the high cost of making this recipe via the meat department of Whole Foods--one word: "Costco." I get the cut there for 1/3 what Whole Foods Charges--the reasons that make Whole Foods a compelling purveyor of many types of meat (local, grass fed, free range, etc) do not apply in the fresh pork department--and Costco's meat inspection regime is every bit as rigorous--if not more so, as Whole Foods. Last but not least--to the cook who gave the recipe just one fork because he/she was disappointed by the stuffing as a stand alone recipe, I think I speak for more than a few of the cooks who use Epicurious when I say "If you don't make the whole recipe, it really isn't cricket to rate the whole recipe." Many of us sort the search results by ratings--and lean towards the four-fork recipes that top the list. Your one-fork for half this recipe--at a time when--as of your posting--there were just two reviews--effectively--and unfairly drove the fork average down for what is really a remarkably tasty and impressive dish. There are few things more ludicrous in the reviews here than people who begin their reviews with the line "I really didn't follow the recipe" and then proceed to denounce what resulted as an indictment of the recipe. But your review comes close.

3 forks instead of 4 only because of the stuffing. The pork was fantastic as written. The stuffing, as others have said, is supremely dry and rather bland. As suggested, I used more eggs (4) and broth (~1c). I also used jalapenos instead of poblanos. I'd make the stuffing again, but would add even more broth and maybe another egg. Maybe some chipotles and/or garlic would add interest to the stuffing.

I made this a couple of years ago for Thanksgiving (yes, instead of turkey). I have to say that it was one of the best pork roasts I have ever had. I changed up the recipe a bit, but the base idea is wonderful. I suggest spicing up the stuffing a bit more than the recipe calls for ;) The only drawback is that a full pork crown roast can be quite expensive if you buy it at Whole Foods... but what isn't expensive at Whole Foods!?

I did not make the pork ribs, but I served the stuffing at Thanksgiving this year. It was awful. I poured about 2 cups of broth over the cornbread, but it was still way too dry. It was rather bland.

Make sure you order the crown of pork from the butcher a couple of days in advance. Definitely would want to use hot peppers - like the first reviewer, our first go at the corn bread stuffing would have been better with a bit of kick. Maybe add some Serrano chillies? Great for 15-18 people.

I made the pork exactly by the instructions and it was delicious as well as a striking presentation. For the stuffing I made 3 modifications: used corn bread and staled white bread, used 6 eggs, and used 3/4 can low sodium chicken broth. It was moist and delicious. I wish I'd used more Tobasco because the poblanos didn't have as much kick as I expected. Overall though, it was a feast my family enjoyed.
