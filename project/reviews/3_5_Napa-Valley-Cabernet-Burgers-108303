I've been making these burgers for years -- they are a huge hit. I agree there's not a huge Cab flavor -- but the wine flavor is definitely there. Made Cabernet sauce as recommended. However, in the burger meat I also added some additional spices (garlic powder, onion powder, rosemary, black pepper, ground fennel seed, oregano) then put in wine sauce. Cooked burgers as recommended in recipe. Also, I toasted the buns and the used brush to put a small amount of the sauce on the buns after they were toasted (not too much it will get mushy). Finally, I top each burger with a Gorgonzola / Butter mixture instead of the cheese and tomatoes called for. Delicious! They are always a hit at a BBQ, or just anytime we want a delicious burger.

This was a disappointing recipe -- the burgers didn't feature enough of the wine flavor, despite the reduction of an entire bottle of red wine. the lack of other condiments showed the weak characters of the dish. I won't be making these again.

i made this recipe with ground elk. it was a huge hit. because elk is such a lean meat, i added about 1/4c of olive oil and 1/4 of bread crumbs as binder. did them under the broiler in oven, as it is the middle of winter and really windy with no hope of lighting a bbq! worked great. 4 min each side and they were done medium.

The best summer treat....ever! I've made this a half dozen different ways. Less expensive wine doesn't seem to harm the product at all. However once I did forget the brown sugar, and they did disappoint. So it's vital. Not sure why, since it's a scant two teaspoons, but it is. A must though, in my opinion, is that they be grilled. Done under a broiler, is not the same!

This is the best burger recipe ever. I think it is so easy to make and the results fantastic. Can't understand why previous reviewers say it is hard/time consuming? You just put the shallots/wine in pan and only have to stir occasionally then add to meat and make patties. Every time I've made for dinner parties (which is a lot!!), people have raved. This is a keeper

I use about 1/3 of the rosemary butter and just lightly spread it on the bread.

The burgers were moist and juicy, but the Cabernet flavor really didn't come through for us. Not sure I would go to the expense and trouble to make this again.

These are a summertime favorite at our house. I usually omit the arugula and substitute romaine lettuce. I have made these many times using regular hamburger or sandwich buns instead of the focaccia, although the focaccia really adds a special touch.

This recipe is EASY and IMPRESSIVE with a few tweaks: (1) purchase already made sirloin burgers from your butcher (2) make the cab sauce and marinate the burgers in the sauce 3-6 hours (3) add BLEU CHEESE along with the cheddar (St. Augur Bleu is GREAT with this). (4) Reserve a little of the sauce before you marinate the meat and save it to spread on the focaccia prior to serving. I get rave reviews every time I serve these!

Tired of limited choices and high prices at the ball park, we looked for an alternative and found the best burger EVER! Juicy, flavorful and easy to prepare. Everyone loved it and we even won the football game!

I liked this recipe but something was missing in the flavor. It needs something more. I'd probably add more brown sugar if I made it again. Also maybe seasoning salt to the meat.

Rating: 2
This was okay, but not great. Given that a friend raved about the recipe, I was pretty disappointed by it. The salt and cheese overpower the subtle cabernet flavors. We substituted ciabatta for the foccacia--the ciabatta was great but I would substitute olive oil for butter if I made this in the future. The butter was just too much. I probably won't make this again.

A burger for grown-ups. The foccacia, tomato, arugula, and sharp cheddar combine sublimely. However, I'm uncertain about the wine reduction. Cabernet flavor was absent, due to the powerful combination of the beef, bread, and condiments. After reducing an entire bottle of decent cabernet, shouldn't a souvenir be in order?

I had to tweak the recipe a bit given the ingredients I had on hand. In place of shallots, used minced sweet onion and 3 garlic cloves. I used about 1/3 of the amount of butter the recipe called for. I melted a tbsp butter and sauteed the onions and garlic for a minute or two and then added the wine. I again, used much less than the recipe called for (because I wanted it to boild down more quickly)..probably about 1-1.5 cups. And then followed the recipe as is. They turned out great, next time I would make more sauce, so that I could have more to baste the burgers. All in all, very good burger.

Really liked these, but they are a lot of work for burgers. I tried the caramelized onion foccacia from emeril per another reviewer's suggestion and thought it did not taste like foccacia at all, so I will look for a better recipe for the bread. Also didn't think the rosemary butter added much in flavor. I used thinly sliced provolone instead of cheddar, and really liked that.

A fabulous party dish that is easy to make. My friends and I prefer the dressier presentation of making two very large burgers on two whole loaves of foccacia bread, then cutting those into quarters. This recipe gets raves at every barbeque, and now is on our perpetual "special request" list.

One of my very few 4-forkers. The key is definitely to misread the instructions and mix in all the wine mixture with the raw meat (or as much as possible). They are so juicy that they will still feel like rare burgers when they are well done if you do a squeeze/poke test. However, even a bloody-burger diehard will love them well done. The only time I failed with these was when I followed the directions. Otherwise they are everyone's new favorite burger.

My husband and I both agreed that this was tasty, but nothing special. The sauce adds nice flavor to the burgers, but we weren't impressed enough to make this again.

Cabernet sauce is very rich and has nice depth of flavor. Great way to use up leftover red wine. Next time I will put the sauce on top of the burger after cooking also to get a stronger effect. Forgot the cheese this time. I'm sure it would be even better with it, helping to balance the acid in the sauce.

I made these for my daughter's birthday party and I have to say that they were pretty darn tasty! The cabernet sauce was exceptional and the burgers were a fun to eat, a nice conversation piece and low key so that everyone could enjoy themselves and the kids party. This will be a keeper in my recipe box for all of those reasons!

I have made this for several barbecues and my guests could not get enough. I did change one thing, I actually mixed the wine-shallot mixture right into the raw hamburger meat, and then I made the patties. It is a bit wet but the burgers are so moist and delicious.

This was literally the best burger I think I have ever had. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I used 90/10 ground beef, which was still great. I paired the burgers with the carmelized onion foccacia (emeril recipe on foodtv.com), which was absolutely fantastic. My husband was doubtful that he wouldn't need something else on his burger (he is a major sauce man), but he loved it as is. I did let the burgers rest for an hour or so in the fridge before we grilled them, which may have helped intensify the flavor. Be sure to use the arugula and a nice heirloom or flavorful tomato. Can't wait to make these for company this summer!

Fabulous! We always bring these when we go camping. I use Two Buck Chuck cab and it works great. I add a little thyme to the wine while reducing then add worcestershire at the end with the brown sugar. We prefer blue cheese or stilton instead of the cheddar.

These burgers were fantastic. I made them on a whim, so I had a box of burgers from my butcher, which are better than most, but still not like forming them myself. Everything else I kept the same, and the results were outstanding. One of the first burgers I've had that I didn't feel needed something else to it.

Mediorce. The article about these said they were suprised that no one had ever made wine burgers. Well, Harvey's Wineburgers in Phoenix are FAR superior and have been around since the early 70's.

Great, memorable burgers. I followed the directions about the buns to the letter and they would be great with any burger. A nice change from the standard burgers we usually make. It hurts to part with an entire bottle of wine for 4 burgers, but I wasn't dissapointed!

I made this with ground turkey because I had some. I was frightened at first when the raw turkey turned a grape purple, but that actually went away, and with the wine reduction glaze on top, looked pretty great, for turkey burgers. Very delicious. I added a little bit of chopped fresh rosemary and sage, and bound the turkey (1 lb) with one egg. I also added a generous amount of salt and more than a quarter cup of the reduction to the meat. It was super flavorful, and I plan to try this next with either lamb or grass-fed beef. And, the lame-o who posted the adverstisement (don't look for it, you will just be like, why did I spend time looking for it) should be banned from epicurious. What a dumb-a*&!

"Best burgers we ever had" is what I hear after serving these hamburgers. They are juicy and full of flavor. I have put a cub of the cheese in the middle of the burger and they are even more moist.

I used a Trader Joe's reduced-fat white cheddar which took a long time to melt on top of the meat, causing the meat to be a little overcooked. I couldn't taste the rosemary butter - next time I'll let it "marry" longer. I used a foccacia that had olives and tomatoes in it already, and felt that it was almost a little too rich. The arugula blended remarkably well. My son tasted an arugula leaf by itself after dinner and swore there was nothing that vile on his burger (which he had happily eaten!) I agree about In-n-Out being the ultimate basic burger, so if I'm going to do burgers at home, I'll do this one.

These were really juicy and had great flavor. We are not sure, though, that it's worth an entire bottle of cab. I only cook with what we would drink, and taxes here make even a basic table wine $15-20.

This burger is one of the best I have had!!! I used 96% lean beef and they still came out juicy (remember: don't PRESS them on the grill!). Skipped the butter on the focaccia since I had just made it fresh. Used provelone instead of white cheddar. MAke it and this will become your favorite burger!

AWESOME--loved it! Maybe the best burger I've ever eaten. Make sure to use the right fat-content beef and follow the directions and the burger should not fall apart. I used 2-buck chuck, and was happy to find something to do with it...

We loved this! We used ciabatta bread instead and think it was delicious. Only change I would make is to let the wine mixture reduce further.

Though the burgers were very juicy, my husband and I felt there was something missing. Next time, we may add either more of the reduction or shallots to the meat. Overall, these were very tasty.

I loved these! I liked them even more than my husband, who made them. The only change we made was to use buns instead of focaccia, and we added a slice of onion with the tomato and arugula.

You couldn't put too much of the wine mixture into the burgers or they would fall apart, and because of that the flavor wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Next time I might reduce a ruby port rather than wine, and add a lot more shallots. However, the burgers did stay juicy, that's always a plus!

Now, this is a burger! Very tasty and tender. However, could have totally disregarded the arugula..<<

Oh my gosh... this was absolutely heavenly! (I don't even want to think about the calories though). My family raved and looked around for more. I added more of the sauce to the raw meat mixture,a nd there was plenty to baste with on the bar-b-q. I served it with pita bread halves, with tomatoes, basil, onions, and cheese as condiments, and made pesto also to go along. This will definitely be a family classic!

It takes a lot to beat my favorite drive thru burger: In-N-Out, bless them! So, a burger recipe better deliver. Wine and red meat? Wow, what a killer combination. Unfortunately, I was not wowed. It was a good burger, but not great. I find that if you tell people it's a new recipe, they'll rave about it. It's Stepford Wives etiquette. I would rather grill up a juicy steak and serve the wine on the side.

I wasn't impressed with the burgers when I served them. Surprisingly, the leftover patty I ate the next day was much more flavorful. I will try this recipe again, but allow the beef and wine mixture to marinate for a while.

I prepared these amazing burgers for guests and everyone demanded the recipe. The burgers were very juicy and the combination of flavors from the cabernet reduction to the rosemary butter and white cheddar was amazing. I followed the recipe exactly except I did not use focaccia. Instead I used bakery kaiser rolls which grilled well with the rosemary butter. Give these a try!

For 4th of July, I made these burgers with ground lamb rather than ground beef (omitting the cheese) and they were fantastic. I made my own Rosemary Focaccia (recipe from this site) and the combination got raves. Rather than tomatoes, I served the burgers with (grilled) roasted red peppers. I also served the burgers with Stonewall Kitchen's Roasted Garlic mustard.

Although personally I thought this recipe was nothing to write home about, all of the guests at my party absolutely raved about these burgers, and begged for the recipe. In my opinion, the Guadaljara Burger in July's Cooking Light was a lot easier and a lot more tasty.
