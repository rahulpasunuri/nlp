I made this dish for the third time over the weekend for a potluck. This time I made some changes. I found the slices of polenta from the roll remained too firm after cooking even though I used the whipping cream on top of each slice, so I substituted Trader Joes frozen Creamy Polenta With Spinach and Carrots with about half a polenta roll, cut in pieces incorporated into the prepared polenta. I added the ½ cup of whipping cream to the polenta. I used half golden hominy and half white hominy. Chopping the cilantro is tedious but worth it, and I used Trader Joes Salsa Verde. The cheese was a mixture of cheddar and Jack. Everything else was according to the recipe, except I wanted to use a glass baking dish that was a little bit longer and a little bit deeper than my 11x7x2 one so I increased all ingredients by about 1/3. It turned out beautiful and delicious. I will make it again.

Good comfort food and an easy filling veggie entree/potluck dish. Suggest using homemade polenta and good salsa verde - guy fieri's is good.

Made this as part of a buffet. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I did make my own polenta and hominy. I will definitely make this again.

I've made this many times, sometimes adding, sometimes just as the recipe calls.. I always get rave reviews - making again for bookclub tomorrow night. This time I made my own polenta in the Microwave - I heard about this from some expert on NPR - It was so easy and came out perfectly - just put the cornmeal in a bowl with water and any thing you want to spice it up with, then cook for 5 minutes, stir and cook for 5 more. I then did an extra 1 minute and then poured it out on some foil to cool. tomorrow I will cut it up for the casserole.

Followed the recipe without any changes and it is very good. The only thing I would do different next time is to add something to give it a little more kick. Maybe some chipotle.

Rating: 3
This is a very nice recipe. I made my own polenta which turned out to be pretty easy. I used 3.8 fat milk which I don't think dragged the recipe down. I also sauted a bunch of vegies and added them to the salsa mix. As many others encourage, stick with the Hominy. It adds a great character to the dish.

Rating: 1
This is a solid, easy dish to make but lacking the pizazz and freshness I typically seek. If I make it again, it will be with all fresh ingredients. It's pretty dense, so I would not serve it as a main dish (I served it with pork). I used instant polenta instead of a pre-made polenta roll.

Very good. Can be made mostly from canned or gourmet it up with all fresh ingredients. I made my own polenta and stirred it forever. HINT - Polenta thickens AFTER it cools.

This is a tasty and delicious casserole with a colorful presentation. I like a little more kick so I used pepper jack cheese. Next time I'll add a little chilli powder.

I use fat free milk rather than heavy cream. I also use salsa verde in the jar in addition to the can

Rating: 3
The first bite I questioned it, but then I decided it was pretty good. I made my own polenta as I think even instant taste better than the logs and I added some chipoltes to the beans because I like some heat. I think there is way to much cheese and would suggest 2 cups or less. I am looking forward to leftovers.

Rating: 3
I made this for my husband a while ago because we are vegetarian and so often you lose a lot of the hearty flavor not using meat, especially in Mexican dishes. That is not the case with this dish! Served with a salad or a side of rice, it makes the perfect meal. I do add one more can of beans, and one more can of diced peppers than it calls for.

Rating: 3
This was really delicious and easy. I added diced red pepper to the bean mixture, and it was a nice addition. I also increased the cilantro/salsa mixture, using Pace brand tomatillo salsa, and it was perfect! This casserole has made for great leftovers, too. I also used a square dish, rather than oblong, and it was just the right size; there aren't enough ingredients to fill up a dish any larger!

Loved it! Went heavy on the cream, the polenta was creamy and delicious. I also went heavy on the cumin and added a little chipotle to compliment. This will become a regular on our winter rotation!

My family did not care for the texture of the store-bought polenta. I would make this again, using corn tortillas...

Made this last night as we headed into predicted 3 day string of subzero temps. It was delicious and would be a quickie to prep but for washing, drying, chopping cilantro (but cilantro adds so much to the dish). Here's what I did differently: 1) lowered oven temp to 325 so I could use a ceramic oval baker; 2) sauteed 1/2 onion with garlic cloves then added to chili mixture; 3) used entire 4 oz. can of salsa verde; 4) "dolloped" each polenta coin with about 1 tsp of fat free sour cream instead of using whipping cream; 5) used a pre-packaged "Mexican" (not taco-flavored) shredded cheese mix; 6) reduced cheese used to 2 cups (about 3/4 c on first layer; 1 1/4 on second--you won't miss the extra cup); 7) ground a little fresh black pepper on the sour cream layers; 8) baked at 325 covered with foil for 30 min; uncovered for 15 until golden; and 9) garnished with the 1/4 c cilantro and 2 chopped green onions. It was very tasty, family loved it and I am polishing off the remainder for lunch today.

This is a great recipe to get rid of leftovers...I throw in whatever I have on hand, onion, black beans, etc. A great way to not waste whatever is left around the house...which is always important when cooking for one.

I loved this recipe. I altered to fit with the Weight Watchers core program by using fat free sour cream instead of whipping cream. Also I used soy monterey jack cheese instead of real cheese. The soy cheese was odd to work with and was more like tofu, but the results was great. The tastes are wonderful and it's a very filling vegetarian dish.

I've made this more times than I can count and never the same way twice. That's the beauty of this recipe. You can switch beans, use different salsa, change the cheese, and vary the heat. Sometimes I make my own polenta but I never forget the cilantro! And yes, the first time I followed the recipe exactly. My family and friends love this!

mmm mmm! this recipe is heaven. it contains all my favorite ingredients. i love it! i've told a few friends and have made it several times. i substitute frozen corn for the hominy and use less cheese. i also leave out the cream entirely. could use even more beans - i'll try that next time. yum! it reheats well, too.

This is easy and tasty but ABSOLUTELY depends on the quality of the salsa. Boring salsa = boring dish. Good salsa = very tasty.

This dish is a lot of work for what you get: glorified black bean dip. I made it by following some of the suggestions posted (added salsa verde, etc.)but it didn't pass the home-test so I didn't even bring it to the potluck I had made it for. There are many more flavorful, less superbowl-esque vegetarian dishes out there. Try one of those instead.

Rating: 4
This recipe has become a favorite. It's DELICIOUS with a few changes: I substitute the corn for the hominy & added a layer of salsa fresca & salsa verde (tomatillo salsa), which all add more kick. This recipe is a bit time-consuming, but is a great make-ahead meal to eat throughout the week. Freezes fairly well.

I really enjoyed making this recipe. It was simple and quick. I just changed it to half the amount of cumin and added red pepper; it was delicious!

I slow cook pork in a crockpot with the spices, salsa, and chiles. I shred it on top of the mixture and then add cheese - delish! I also use corn instead of hominy. I think it needs a little extra salt too. We LOVE it! I've made it for company and it always gets raves!

This is so easy and so satisfying. Adding more spicy stuff or sauteeing onions or making the polenta is just making more work for yourself! Its great comfort food, and that's all it needs to be.

Rating: 3
This recipe is a good starting point. Storebought polenta would be very fast and is not that expensive, but I made my own (6 cups water, 3 cups polenta - makes a lot, but the extra is good for so many things). As other reviewers suggested, I whisked sour cream with milk as a substitute for the cream. (Not sure what part that really plays in the dish, but hey...can't hurt.) I can't imagine making this recipe exactly as is with no onions. I sauteed one onion, 1/2 a red bell pepper (just because I had it in the fridge), some minced hot pepper, and lots of mushrooms then added the salsa verde, garlic, and spices to that mix. I layered polenta, beans, veggie mix, cheese (x2). Next time, I'll mix the beans with the veggies and do that as one layer and add a thick layer of salsa or tomatoes - we agreed that it needs the extra flavor and juice. Cooking times were about right - I only did 10 minutes without the foil instead of 15. I have a feeling the people who thought the dish looked messy didn't give it time to cool and set. Our first servings (five minutes out of the oven) were very messy, yes. Once the dish had rested 30, though, and I was putting it into tupperware for lunch, it sliced and 'served' beautifully.

Rating: 3
You can enhance this recipe with a few minor adjustments to the polenta and beans. First, make your own polenta and add a finely chopped chipotle pepper. Then, saute onion and add cumin and Mexican chili powder and cook for a minute or two. Add beans and simmer a few minutes. It only takes a little more work but makes a big difference. Delicious!

This is a really good veggie dish. I think I will try using pepper jack cheese next time, though.

This is a really good casserole - and simple! Like other reviewers, I made my own polenta (can't see spending $4 for cornmeal and water!). It's nothing spectacular, but a nice family meal.

This is a great vegetarian dish. I make a very simple polenta, just cornmeal and water to use with this casserole. I usually skip the hominy and/or corn. You can play with adding other veg's and using red tomato vs. tomatillo salsa. I usually find it runny immediately after cooking (even after "standing") not sure what to do about it but no worries, It's delicious!

Great flavor! Reminds me of tamales. I've made this a few times adding olives, petite dices tomatoes with jalapeno, and grilled corn. Even my friends who shy away from any kind of spice like this one!

The beauty of this dish is the wonderful Southwest taste combined with ease of preparation and conduciveness to substituting and adding ingredients. Like others, I used sour cream (beaten with milk) instead of cream, corn instead of hominy. I also added chopped green onions to the cilantro/garlic/salsa mix. The polenta roll is easy but I'm sure it would taste even better with freshly made polenta.

Rating: 3
Great flavor and very easy to make. I wasn't turned off by its appearance-it's a casserole, so who expects it to be beautiful? Made recipe as written, except was out of cilantro and subbed regular salsa for the tomatillo and pepper jack for the regular jack. Too spicy for my daughter, but the grown-ups liked it. It was a little runny-maybe I should have cooked it longer (had to use an 8x8 pan)?

This dish is delicious, full of flavor, and easy to make. We loved it! Just ask Otis. When he makes it, it is the best. Follow the recipe, and your dish will taste nothing like "wheat paste!"

We really liked this, had to use jalapeno salsa instead of tomatillo but I think that turned out to be a good thing. Used less cheese, not for dietary reasons but the recipe calls for a ton. Very good and different - good hominy recipes are hard to come by!

I and my family really liked this recipe. I whip up a batch of my own thick polenta and skip the hominy. I also use about 3/4 cup each of chipotle salsa and salsa verde in the layering and a sharper cheese than the monterey jack. I have passed the recipe on to others looking for a good vegetarian dish.

I was determined to make this casserole in spite of my skimpy pantry. The polenta roll I had...substituted pinto beans for black; fresh salsa plus 1 jalapeno for the chilis; fat free sour cream plus skim milk for the cream; mozzarella and lite havarti for the jack cheese and frozen corn for the hominy. Our guests raved; it was delicious. Will absolutely make this again.

I've made this recipe dozens of times and it's not pretty but always delicious! It's become our official "new baby" casserole to bring to friends for that first hectic week home. It's such a nice vegetarian alternative to all the pasta and stir-fries we normally eat. I like to add a half to one tablespoon mole sauce to the chili mixture for a change sometimes. Even my three-year-old loves it.

Rating: 4
Excellent! I too had difficulty finding the polenta role, so I made my own--most boxes of cornmeal have a "cornmeal mush" recipe printed on it, which is essentially the same as any basic polenta. I added some cilantro and chili powder to my polenta, spooned it into a loaf pan to cool and cut my slices accordingly.

Rating: 3
I really messed up on this recipe for a couple reasons. First, after looking all over I never could find this "polenta" roll or even anyone who knew what it was. I wasn't able to get salsa verde or the hominy either. I used corn for the hominy, 3 bean salsa for the salsa verde and boiled potatoes for the hominy. I put all the potatoes on the bottom as I didn't realize till it was too late that it's supposed to be layered. I also messed up and mixed the black beans with the salsa/spices. Anyway, it was still pretty good and it's a nice vegetarian dinner.

I made this with the garbanzo beans instead of hominy and added corn as suggested by the other reviewers. Instead of cream, I used soy milk and also used low fat cheese. This is an easy, tasty dish that I will make over and over again.

If you are conservative, the hominy may seem 'weird,' as one reviewer put it. But the hominy and polenta are a perfect balance for the salsa and cilantro. This is a fantastic dish that is just as good reheated. Try it.

I liked this recipe. Made it as a side dish to go with pork tenderloin. Next time, I'll leave out the cream and perhaps the hominy-with all that polenta, just seems like more corn. I did use about a cup of the tomatillo salsa and the pepperjack cheese. Reheats well in a microwave.

Good recipe, but I made a few changes. I used Fire-roasted (hot, red) salsa for spice. I added a teaspoon of salt and a squirt of lime juice to the chili/salsa mix. I also and omitted the cream, used pepper jack cheese, and polenta roll that was flavored with cilantro and chili. These changes made for a spicy and very delicious cold weather meal. I think next time I will use just black beans as I didn't get much out of the hominy. A good recipe top experiment with.

I couldn't find polenta roll so substituted rice. This was fine tasting-- but I don't usually hope for fine. I made it as a main course and after two helpings each, my husband and I were both hungry; it wasn't substantial. Probably a good side dish. Next time I'd add salsa and refried beans. For meat/chicken eaters that suggestion was a good one.

Rating: 4
I must admit I made some slight alterations to the original recipe. Not being a fan of cilantro, I substituted chopped fresh baby spinach. I used chopped jalapeno peppers (from a jar) instead of diced green chilies. Modified the salsa verde by adding a tablespoon or so of mole, and like several other reviewers - frozen corn in place of the can of golden hominy. I also replaced the whipping cream with an equal amount of plain yogurt and Silk soy milk combined. All that said, this was excellent and will most certainly make this again and again.

Rating: 2
I would make it again with some changes. It was unusually runny. That bothered me. I agree with another review that it needed some salt added. The homeny was different, but added an interesting component. Perhaps corn could be substituted. I would rethink the addition of whip cream though.

I have made this several times and found it needed more salt. The other night I used 1 1/2 cups salsa verde, no chili's, pepper jack cheese and used milk instead of cream. When served we added low fat sour cream. It added a little extra kick and was really tasty! We've also used corn or garbanzo beans instead of hominy.

My husband asks for this dish at least once a month - it is a weeknight staple and freezes/reheats well! I prefer to use fresh-made polenta rather than the prepared roll; it has a better texture, although it does require a little extra effort. I also found that the fresh polenta absorbs the cream, and the dish is not as runny when it first comes out of the oven. I like some of the recent reviews suggestions (corn, roasted red pepper); I'm already looking forward to making it again.

Disappointing. My daughter and I thought it was just OK but my husband hated it! It was easy to put together and I had some wonderful fresh cilantro to use but even that didn't make this dish memorable. And we weren't particularly off-put by the appearnace, either! There's a similar dish on this site - a ground pork tamale with a cornbread crust - which is far better and not that much more trouble to make. I shan't bother with this one again.

I took this dish to a book club pot luck and it was well received. Several people wanted the recipe. I did a trial run prior to the pot luck and made one change. I added a can of regular corn in addition to the hominy and it really improved the dish. I think the cream is an important addition to soften the polenta. I would definitely make it again.

Didn't chnage a thing (except I used fresh salsa) and it was a big hit. I served it with corn bread and a green salad. Next time I'll use hot chilis instead of mild. It's not a "pretty " dish, but that's ok -- it's a casserole.

A great dish - powerful flavors - very much worth the effort. I made my salsa by placing tomatillos and garlic in the food processor and this really made a difference. I forgot the hominy so I doubled the black beans - it was great. I would not bother making this recipe if you do not have the cilantro on hand. That, with the fresh salsa, really made the difference. My four-year-old was not that impressed, but the adults loved it.

This dish is really delicious! Very easy to make, not expensive, good vegetarian meal. To make it lighter, we omit the cream and leave the beans somewhat undrained, we also omitted the cilantro but definitely kept the cumin as it gives the dish a special taste.

Loved this! My book club hostess made it when we read Tortilla Curtain. I loved it so much that I immediately made it a few days later. Though I loved it spicy, I used mild tomatillo salsa and took out the cumin so that my 3 year old son could eat it. It was still great if you don't like it too spicy. The next time I make it I'm going to trying putting tortilla chips in it and maybe sprinkling diced fresh tomatoes on it. This was comfort food at its best!

I love polenta and hominy and tried this recipe as soon as it came out in the magazine. This is heavy and rich, real winter comfort food. The cream does a lot to mellow the flavors. Took it to a potluck and got rave reviews. It was also excellent reheated.
