I have made this recipe several times, each time with complete success. I like the balance of the cardamom and the plums and did not find it overwhelming at all - and the colours are gorgeous on the plate.

This is a very beautiful dessert. If you want to double it, DON'T. When you whip the egg whites, they must be put into the oven immediately, or they will not have the nice texture and consistency that you want. The sauce can be doubled.

We loved this recipe! Very nice blend of flavors, very elegant and summery. Did exactly as written and found it very easy to do. Will definitely do it again!

This was very easy to make, although it did take some time. I would go a little light on the cardamom to spice the plums. Overall, it was very good and I'm glad we have a little left over!
