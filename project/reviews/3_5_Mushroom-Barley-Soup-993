This soup is now a staple for us in the late fall/winter. It is hearty, and the barley retains some texture for leftovers. With some warm crusty bread and a glass of red wine--a perfect cozy meal. For a little punch, I sometimes add dried porcini or wild mushrooms. That might be too fragrant for some, though. (I did try to freeze it and it became a little mealy, so I wouldn't do that again).

Recipe is overall very solid. use a bit more barley and only 6 cups of stock for a much hardier soup the dill should also go in at the beginning that will give it more time to permeate. Also mixing the flour with some of the soup first in a separate bowl will help it spread evenly and avoid clumping. The parsley isn't needed it doesn't do much here double the dill instead the mushrooms and the dill create a nice balance.

Love this recipe, but made a few adjustments. I stagger the veggies - onions first, until they turn clear, then carrots & celery, then when those are starting to soften, add the mushrooms, and barley last. It definitely came out more flavorful that way.

The dill in this recipe totally ruins the whole thing...it is way overpowering. I would definitely sub it out for rosemary or thyme....asides from that, everything else was shaping up to be yummy.

This is one of my go-to winter soup recipes. Tasty, hearty and comforting. I use beef or turkey broth for a little extra unami. The whole family loves it!

I used a beef soup bone and a small piece of london broil to make a beef broth. Added the diced beef to the soup making it beef mushroom barley, it is very good! No meat is OK, but with meat it is a meal.

Forgot the flour and added extra barley -- still hearty and delicious!

I love this soup. It's not too thick or thin. I use beef broth and add a pack of dried porcinis to bump the mushroom flavor up. Serve with toasted crusty bread. Mmm.

I make this soup a few times a year by demand from family and friends. I change it up a bit if any other veggies look good and find it best when I use a variety of mushrooms. Simple and always delicious.

Rating: 4
I made this almost exactly as the recipe stated, except for a few minor things. First, I sauteed all the veggies except for the mushrooms for 10 minutes and then added in the mushrooms. I wanted to be sure that the other veggies browned nicely and this worked well. Second, I didn't use dill, but substituted dried thyme instead. It is delish!

Super tasty, full of mushroom goodness with extra heartiness from the barley. Easy too. Didn't have a problem with the onion browning/the level of moisture pre-broth.

Rating: 4
Fantastic! Yes, I added more mushrooms, salt and pepper while I was cooking as opposed to the end - but this soup was top notch! My Husband loved it so much he insists I make it for company and not even mention it's vegetarian....fabulous! I will make this for sure again! Oh, I added fresh baby spinach to the bowl and then put the soup on top of the spinach so that it wilted and became a part of the dish, outstanding!

I also used cracked wheat instead of barley (only because that is what I had on hand) Was great and, I guess, just about any grain could be a sub.

Rating: 4
Why does everybody keep turning vegetarian dishes into beef or chicken broth opportunities???!!!??? I made this exactly as directed and loved it. One change I will make next time is that I will use 1/8 cup of butter as there was a film of butter at the top of the finished product. Tip, some people mention too much liquid in the pot. Try not washing the mushrooms as they are like sponges and can ruin a meal when they are brimming with water.

Rating: 1
Made as written. This is a half-decent soup, but the method is completely wrong. The mushrooms and onions will never "brown" if you put them in the butter together with barley. The mushrooms' moisture is immediately absorbed by the barley and what you get is burned barley sticking to the bottom of the pot. The way to do it is to brown the onions, mushrooms and veggies in butter first, then to add the already cooked barley. I have read positive reviews below, but it seems the soups cooked by their authors have nothing to do with the actual recipe above. It is really interesting how people alter the recipes and then review their own creations.

Rating: 4
I browned all of the veggies but the mushrooms for a while then added about a half cup of dry sherry. After the wine reduced a bit, I added the mushrooms and broth, a bay leaf and some salt (I used broth from the freezer- needed salt). Cooked for a couple of hours on low heat, stirring often. YUMMMMM. Going to make this one again. I love that it's totally vegetarian and can even be vegan if one uses olive oil instead of butter. I did use chicken broth this time, but my veggie kids will love this.

Rating: 3
Delicious soup, but I did make some adjustments and would make more in the future. I used half beef broth and half chicken stock for more richness. The carrots were a bit mushy after sauteeing and cooking in the broth. In the future I will saute the onions, celery and carrots seperate from the mushrooms and add to the broth about 15 minutes before finishing. I like more bite in my vegetables and they never seemed to get to the 'browning' stage because there was so much liquid from the mushrooms. I added twice the barley & about 1.5 times the mushrooms (mini-portabellos) and omitted the flour addition. I wanted a hearty barley soup and this hit the spot. A little dollop of sour cream w/the parsley & dill at serving is delicious.

Rating: 4
This was a very good non-cream mushroom soup. I added 1/2 beef and 1/2 chicken broth (low sodium) because canned vegetable broth is just too salty and onion tasting. I used mixed white and baby portabella mushrooms. Also added a bit of cayenne and sherry. It turned out great on this cold Wisconsin night.

Good winter soup. I followed the recipe except I used turkey broth which I had after Thanksgiving, and omitted the dill. Served it with a bit of sherry and it was delicious on a cold night

To really build up the flavor, I made the following very successful adjustments: 5 cups beef broth (made from boullion) plus 4 cups water for 9 cups total liquid; reserve half of the chopped mushrooms until end -- saute in pan with 2 T butter until liquid has been released, add 3 T dry sherry, cook another minute then add to soup; flour and parsley omitted and not missed; DEFINITELY ADD dollop of sour cream in each bowl at end for thickener and bigger flavor! Additionally, I added the chopped celery & carrots after 50 minutes of cooking time and let it cook another 30 minutes more. It was very delicious and something my guest was especially enjoying, which is always a nice thing.

Dish delish...soaked about 1 oz of dried mushrooms in 1 c.water, and added chopped mushrooms, substituted mushroom cooking water and 1 cup of sherry for 2 cups of vegetable broth. Also used hulled, rather than pearled barley, and thyme instead of dill. DH and friends raved about it all week, so am making it for a soup supper we're having over the weekend!

Rating: 0
Great starting point for wild mushrooms and barley - I also threw in some leftover turkey, black pepper, thyme and half a Knorr cube, left out the dill and parsley, used olive oil instead of butter making it a different dish I suppose but it sure was good!

Rating: 2
This is so quick and easy and I had everything on hand. It does need a night in the refrigerator for the flavors to fully develop, and it does need a bit of a boost to be a rich soup. I put in 1/2 oz of dried chanterelles with soaking liquid along with crimini and button. I added 3/4 c of dry sherry as per other recommendations, which added complexity. I used part mushroom broth and part vegetable stock. I added a bay leaf and thyme to the saute. I upped the barley per other reviews. This soup is comforting, tasty and will freeze well. I would make it again. However I do not consider this to be company worthy.

Rating: 4
I followed this recipe almost entirely but cut the quantities down by 1/4 except for the barley, for which I used the full 1/2C. I used 4oz of sliced button mushrooms and 8oz of sliced baby portabellas. For broth, I used 16oz vegetable broth and 32oz mushroom broth, both made by Pacific Natural Foods. I cooked the soup for a good 2 1/2 hours because I like it thick. The flavor and textures were perfect, and every mouthful was a delight. This is the recipe I've been wanting to find for years!

this was really tasty! my suggestions would be to use a mix of mushrooms - button, shitake and crimini - and to increase the barley to 1 cup. the dill and parsley are awesome. will definitely make this again.

I made this soup with dried porcini and the kind of barley that has the hull on it (it's much more nutritious than pearl barley) and it was delicious and filling. Would definitely recommend using at least some dried mushrooms for flavor. Next time I might throw in a potato, too. Also thyme is a good addition.

Mmmm...delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of the vegetable stock. I added 8 cups of water and 4 packets of George Washington's golden seasoning (because that's what I had in my house) and it was wonderful. Everyone loved it. I made it last night and it's gone already, so I'm off to the grocery store for mushrooms to make some more. It's the perfect comfort food!

I chose this recipe over all the other ones because it looked the easiest and what a surprize! it's also the best one i've ever made and i am a big lover of mushroom barley soup! i made a few changes also....added more barley...used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and left out the dill and used thyme instead when i was sauteeing the vegetables and mushrooms together...i think thyme goes much better with this soup than dill. it's totally delicious and THIS is the recipe i will use from now on.

This was a very good soup that satisfied the meat-eater and veggie (me) in the family. My toddler absolutely loved the soup! I pretty much followed directions with a few minor exceptions of adding dried thyme instead of dill & parsley. Thyme goes so well with mushrooms. I love dill but it sounded like a weird addition. I also added a porcini bouillon cube with the vegetable stock. I also added 1 cup of barley instead if 1/2. It was hearty.

Rating: 4
Comfort food to the max! I followed some of the other reviewers' suggestions: I used chicken stock; lots of mixed mushrooms, much more barley than stated...and I had forgotten to saute an onion, so I threw in a minced shallot during cooking. I don't see how anything could change this soup -- it's basic bones are so good. My kitchen smells heavenly and the soup is absolutely divine.....

Rating: 3
Fabulous winter/fall soup. Very hearty! I did take some suggestions from other raters, I added a shot of sherry while veggies were cooking and used about 1/4 cup of butter and added some olive oil instead to cut out some fat but not all the flavor. A keeper for sure.

Rating: 3
This is a hearty soup, which makes it tough to give a 4 star rating, which I reserve for things I'd call "sublime." My husband said this is one of the best soups I've ever made. I substituted olive oil for the butter (2 Tbsp.) and let the veggies get browned, leaving a nice fond on the bottom of the pan. I also added a bit more barley than called for, and used 1/2 mixed "gourmet" mushrooms.

Rating: 3
This should probably be a 4 forker due to how easy it is! I have made it a dozen times and almost always stick completely to the recipe with a few exceptions - I'm pretty sure I end up using way more mushrooms (I just love them) and usually use baby bella's (my favorite). The first time I made it I forgot the part with the flour and it was still nice and thick so I've never used it any time since. Like other reviewers I sometimes use more barley than called for and also use the longer cooking kind (again, just love barley). If I have spinach or chard or kale that I need to use up I will chop that up and throw it in at the end. Just gives a little extra nutrition and yumminess.

Rating: 2
After reading all the glowing reviews I was disappointed when my version came out just..."eh" and I kept having to add more and more salt to get some flavor. I followed some of the suggestions here: used olive oil instead of butter, a little less than called for, which was not quite enough to brown the veggies (they started sticking before their time was up) but still left the soup a little too fatty for my taste. Also used slightly less broth (my pot was not quite big enough) and subbed a little sherry for some of it. Next time--and there will be a next time, because I really believe this could be as good as you all say it is--I'll use the called-for amount of oil for browning, add a bit of garlic, more onion, more celery, and plenty of salt, and skip the dill and sherry. Wish me luck!

This soup turned out great ... tasty and very rich. I made a few changes: in addition to white mushrooms and shitake, I added a small handful of reconstituted wild mushrooms. I did not use fresh herbs (having none on hand) and instead added bay leaves during the simmering and dried oregano at the end. I also added a dollop of dry sherry at the end. Also, simply because my dutch oven wasn't large enough, I only used four cups of liquid: one cup of the reserved liquid from the reconstituted mushrooms, two cups of vegetable broth, and one cup of water. That was sufficient for tonight's soup; perhaps I might need to add more for tomorrow, if the barley swells overnight. In the future, I think I will use less butter and add some olive oil as the butterly richness is a little heavy for my tastes. Overall, though, a great soup and lovely for a cold, blustery day like today!

Rating: 3
Really good. I added a shot of scotch for more of a "scotch broth" flavor versus the Sherry.

Delicious. Have been looking for a vegetarian version for a while. Used olive oil for saueting, 1/2 tsp thyme and was out of veggie stock, so used some kelp from one of my health food shopping sprees boiled in water..amazing., I will use the kelp stock again, it works very well with the mushrooms, for those like me, who sometimes buy on impulse but cant throw anything away.

We love this receipe. I originally made it for our vegetarian French foreign exchange student but I keep going back to it because it is so good. I cut the butter by half, also never add the dill or the parsley-we like it fine the way it is. A great cold-weather soup.

Used half the butter and substituted olive oil. Still good. Richer mushroom barley soup than I'm used to. Prefer more barley. Also I used unhulled barley for extra nutrition. It has to be cooked longer but it also has more flavor.

I love!! this recipe. I'm a total novice cook but it still turned out great! Also, on my mom's advice, I threw a little sherry into it at the end which really adds to it. Plus, i really think the parsley and the dill ramp up the taste. Anyway, yay! so goood!

Rating: 4
I followed other reviewers' advice and arrived at the following revisions: doubled barley to 1 cup, substituted from the veg broth 1 cup sherry, 1 cup porcini rehydrating liquid, and 2 cups chicken broth (that because of what I had on hand). I chopped the porcini fine and added it to the pot just after adding the broth. Finally, I omitted the dill (meant to add thyme but forgot, to no disadvantage) and added the parsley to individual bowls rather than to the whole pot, so that it will be fresh today as lunch. A fabulous dish for a cold night!

Rating: 4
This gets four forks from me for being delicious, healthful, and above all, easy and quick! I used baby bella and white mushrooms. Next time, I'll use more flavorful mushrooms to add more flavor. I accidentally forgot the flour, so I added a little cornstarch at the end instead to thicken it. Also, I thought I had dill, but didn't, so used thyme as per other reviews. Definitely try squeezing some lemon on top right before serving, it contrasts beautifully with the mushrooms and barley. Don't skip the parsley, either.

Rating: 4
Absolutely fantastic soup. I did substitute shallots for the onion, added a leek, some garlic, a dash of tabasco sauce and a generous splash of cognac since I was out of sherry. I also used fresh crimini mushrooms. I think the soup would be great without my tinkering as well.

Using selected reviewers' suggestions from over the years, I found this to be superb. In short,I added three minced garlic cloves, doubled barley to one cup, used thyme instead of dill, added a leek and one cup of dry sherry just before serving. My addition was a cubed leftover steak and I substituted beef broth for vegetable broth. This soup is company worthy!

Delicious. I made the mistake of not adding the barley until after the broth was added, but I just let the pot simmer until the barley seemed ready...and it came out great! The carots were scrumptious and the mushrooms (crimini) were juicy

This is quite good!! I thought it was better the next day--which is usually how it goes with soups. I did not have any homemade vegi broth, so I used a quart of Imagine and a quart of Swanson's. I tasted both and would never use the Imagine again. The Swanson's is so much better. Taking the cue from others, I added about a half cup sherry. I think it was a great idea! Would definately make again.

I love to make soup and this was easy and delicious. I made a few changes: I added a few minced garlic cloves with the onions, doubled the barley to 1 cup, and used 3 c. chicken broth, 4 c. beef broth, 1 c. liquid used to hydrate dried mushrooms. This makes a thick soup that can be thinned as desired. Tasted better the next day.

I deviated. I browned the veggies in less butter than was called for, set them aside, then toasted the barley and flour together, set them aside, and browned some cubed leftover roast beef in a small bit of olive oil. I used beef broth instead of vegetable, and the soup turned out wonderfully.

This was delicious . . . the PERFECT soup for a cold winter's night! Like others, I added sherry and I always substitute one can of consumme for one of beef broth when making beef based soups.

Delicious, warming, soothing ... perfect comfort food for a cold night. Only change I made was to use low-sodium chicken broth, as I couldn't find vegetable broth in my supermarket. Putting dill in this soup was an inspired idea. It adds something special to the flavor. I liked it so much I added a little more to the leftovers! I'm going to be making this soup a lot this winter.

This recipe has become a standard for me - it is easy, quite quick for soup (yet tastes like a long, slow simmer-type dish), and it tastes incredible. I might experiment with some of the different herb combinations suggested by various reviewers, but frankly I like the dill - it gives the soup a crisp, sharp note that contrasts nicely with the rich earthy flavor of the mushrooms. I would highly recommend adding this to your list of standard family winter meals - a true gem.

Rating: 3
Great soup. I omitted the dill and parsley and instead used just a touch of rosemary. I also increased the mushrooms, replaced half the vegetable stock with an organic mushroom stock i found, and added a little marsala wine. As with other reviewers, I find that thicker is better with this soup.

Rating: 3
Very tasty soup. I used two 14 1/2-oz cans of beef broth and 4 cups of chicken broth and 1 cup of water. I think the beef broth brings out the earthiness of the mushrooms. As for the mushrooms, increase the amount and quarter them. I also used three carrots, and 1/2 tsp thyme instead of the dill or parsley. Add the thyme with the liquids. Serve with a crusty baguette and a wine you enjoy (thank you to the previous reviewers for all the advice!) The next morning the soup had thickened to a stew. I recommend it!

I loved this soup!!! I have been looking for a good mushroom barley soup recipe for a long time and I finally found one. I made the soup this morning and used slightly more celery, carrots and barley than the recipe calls for (just my preference). Also, I found that the soup really did not need the parsley and dillweed as it had a wonderful flavor on its own. (I did not add those ingredients.) It's a very delicious and hearty soup and I would definitely make it again. It does require some significant prep time because of all the chopping of the vegetables.

This is a wonderful, hearty soup just right for the winter months! I am not particular to dill, however, and substituted a little tyme instead. I also doubled the recipe for a large crowd which brought the first cooking of the vegetables up to about a half hour. I also cut down on the stock (14 cups instead of 16) to make it heartier and more stew like. It was a huge hit and I do plan to make it again and again!

This was very, very good. I made some modifications for taste & health: I used half unsalted butter and half canola oil to saute the vegetables and barley. I used canned beef broth (Swanson's) in place of vegetable broth -- which has the effect of lowering the sodium content a bit as well. Finally, I used about 1/4 tsp. of thyme leaves in place of the dillweed. Altogether a very savory dish. I made one and one-half recipe and at that it makes about 5 or 6 main-course servings with bread and salad.

Rating: 3
Delicious, however I doubt that this hungry body-builder will get more than 5 servings out of it. You do need to watch the pan fairly closely until you add the broth. It took about 18 minutes for the mushrooms to give up their liquid. Adding the barley along with the vegetables and browning them all a bit really added to the flavor. I used dillweed and it worked just fine.

Serve this to a small group of close friends on a very cold winter afternoon - preferably with some crusty French bread and a glass of your favorite wine. When word spreads about what you have done, you will be cast in bronze and enshrined in the nearest public park.
