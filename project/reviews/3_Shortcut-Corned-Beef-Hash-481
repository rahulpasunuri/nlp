Quick and tasty, and being a bachelor, that's how I like recipes to be. This was my first attempt at hash. Had to use canned corned beef, as the real deli stuff isn't readily available here. Used yellow bell pepper--no red at the store, as was suggested elsewhere. I turned up the heat at the end to brown it all more quickly. I agree with kriscrossapplesauce about adding a bit of garlic.

This recipe is pretty good.It was satisfying, but it could have a little bit more garlic in it. But I added it anyway! I may consider preparing this recipe again.

I found this recipe as a way to use up an eye of round roast that I overcooked. Let's put it this way -- most of the 3-pound roast was left over. Then I remembered that my dad used to make beef hash out of leftover pot roast. So I found a package of diced potatoes and followed the recipe -- except for doubling it for 4 people and adding butter to the olive oil -- and it was a big hit. Leftovers gone!

Yum! Used organic yukon gold frozen hashbrowns defrosted,red pepper not green and a mayan sweet onion topped with 2 organic poached eggs. Even my picky kid loved this (he helped make it too)

This is pretty good given the speed and ease of preparation. You can improve it by adding a tsp (or more to taste) of Dijon (or your favorite) mustard. For an additional kick, add a bit of horseradish or worchestershire sauce - just a dash. The texture of frozen potatoes isn't all that great, so I usually just boil some potatoes the night before, then peel them (or not.) To really expedite this short cut - use your food processor, doing each ingredient separately and combining them in a bowl. Simply cut each ingredient in large chunks and then pulse to dice - no need to clean out processor bowl between ingredients. I prefer to cook the hash in a combo of butter and vegetable oil. Top with poached or fried egs for a delicious brunch.
