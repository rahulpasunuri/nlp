This turned out great and I plan to use it in stead of cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving. I played with the recipe a lot though... I used fiji and granny smith apples, increased the water by 1 cup, added 2 tbsp orange juice along with the lemon juice and threw in a cinnamon stick from the start. After 30 minutes, I drained most of the liquid away to use as a cider (AWESOME!). I then added 1/4 cup light brown sugar, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, 2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp more of cinnamon. I excluded the cardamom. The sauce is very flavorful and I will definitely be making this again.

I just made this recipe and I am definitely going to make it can it was sour and sweet and the two flavors combined together very well I would definitely recommend this! I would give it a three and a half if possible.

Have loved this recipe for years. I always halve the sugar.

Very good, very easy...but WAY too sweet in my opinion. I would definitely cut the sugar in half or omit entirely, depending on apple variety. Have made it several times and last time I used about 1/3 pears, 2/3 apples (both free from our neighboring orchard) and it was great. Another wonderful way to enjoy Washington apples!

Great recipe, very simple and basic ingredients. We have apple trees (not even sure what kind but one is likely McIntosh) and I used my own apples. I also used half cherry juice to give it more depth of flavor, half brown sugar, and added raisins and cranberries toward the end because my husband likes them. Right out of the pot all warm and bubbling it was wonderful - the kind of thing you could keep spooning up for just a little bit more. I'm planning to freeze some to serve alongside cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving and my husband has already expressed his desire to have some over vanilla ice cream after dinner. Definitely a multi-tasking applesauce!

This was my first time making homemade applesauce - wow, it is delicious and so easy to make! I didn't have cardamom, I used some nutmeg instead.

This was a good recipe. I used brown sugar and added more cinnamon. I also made it in the pressure cooker which worked great. No mashing necessary as the apples sort of disintegrated into a slightly chunky sauce under pressure. If you like the chunks bigger and firmer, pressure cooker is not the way to go.

Yummy -- esp with that cardamom. I used a dozen or so apples -- assorted from the CSA.

Loved it! Easy, delicious and satisfying! I used very tart Macintosh apples, so I used a bit more sugar, and I used brown sugar because I love the flavor. Didn't have cardamom so I substituted nutmeg. An easy recipe to tailor to your own taste, and I love the chunkier texture. It was a hit with my roommates, too.

Fabulous recipe! Since I have made applesauce many times and used less water, I used half the amount on this recipe and it was perfect!

Definitely use 1/2 Apple Juice - 1/2 water !!

I've made this applesauce every year for Hanukkah (and several other occasions, as well) since I first found it. It's delicious warm from the pot. I sometimes substitute pumpkin pie spice for the cardamom, and sometimes leave it out. Often I add a bit more cinnamon, too. Most commonly I use a mix of Grannys and Fuji or Gala because I like really chunky sauce and it ends up a hair more tart (plus I'm not a huge Red/Golden Delicious fan, despite growing up in Washington). Leaving some peels on from red-skinned apples gives a lovely pale pink hue, if you like that kind of thing.

I too used half apple juice and half water. Makes a HUGE difference in the flavor. I also cut back the sugar by about half since the apple juice added it's own sugars.

I made this for my fiancee and for Pot Luck at Church this past Sunday morning and was truely impressed by how quick and easy AND delicious this recipe was!! I had purchased some apples at a roadside stand in Eastern Washington and they were perfect for this recipe. I didn't mash the apples like suggested, I just left them as they were after being cooked...LOVED the big chunks!! I highly reccomend this recipe for using up apples. I am going to attempt canning this so we can enjoy it at Christmas time served warm with dinner!

Cardamom is a spice sometimes used in pumpkin pies. It is not really needed here, so if you don't have any, it will still be okay. If you want your family to think you're the best, serve this to them warm from the stove for dinner - it tastes like warm apple pie filling! Great far a cool autumn evening! Great Stuff!

What is cardamom?

I substituted half the water for apple juice, which I think keeps it extra apple-y good!
