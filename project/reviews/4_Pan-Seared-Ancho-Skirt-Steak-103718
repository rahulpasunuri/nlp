This is a great way to grill skirt steak...While generally quite tough, the sauce and searing method renders the meat tender and flavorful...The sauce isn't good poured over the cooked meat though (the last step)...The seared meat is PERFECT all by itself!

This recipe can be an easier outside recipe. Mix the sauce ingredients in a 4-cup measuring pyrex, microwave for 2 mins or so. Brush on the steaks while they're on the grill or marinade them after the sauce has cooled to room temp.Skip the oil in both steps, you won't need it on skirt steaks.

also works great with chicken and tritip on the bbq. Definitely would reduce the amount of vegetable by half.

This was the first time I ever cooked skirt steak. The recipe is delicious and very easy to prepare and cook. Served with succotash with a kick and these made an easy and very tasty meal.
