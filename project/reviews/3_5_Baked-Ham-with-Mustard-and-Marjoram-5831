With some changes, this recipe was fabulous! No Madeira, roasted at 375, regular OJ instead of concentrate in the glaze, only 1 cup of mustard....I strained the glaze and used it "straight" without reducing....this ham was delicious!

We forgot to put the mustard glaze on during cooking. But can say the sauce was great and likely would have been over the top great had some of the mustard dripped in while cooking. Can't wait to make it again.

We messed up and forgot to put the mustard glaze on the ham. So served the mustard as a side with the ham. Great flavor. The wine and orange juice sauce was simple and great. It would have been over-the-top- great with some of the mustard glaze in the drippings. We baked a 9 lb. ham with sauce at 375 degrees for 3 hours to an internal temperature of 160 degrees. (Entertaining, so did not want to trust the recipe's shorter time frame.)

This turned out really really well for our Easter lunch. It was juicy and tasty and everyone loved it. I froze the leftover sauce to use with a weeknight ham steak some other time.

Excellent ham. I wish it came with supporting recipes & ideas on how to use the leftovers! I really liked the sauce & especially enjoyed the bottom of the ham that soaked in it. I would think that ham steaks, fully emerged it the sauce, would be incredible & will plan to try that out the time time I am craving ham, but don;t have enough guests to get through 1 pounds of it.

I have my Roast Prime Rib w/Madeira & horseradish sauce for Christmas & now I have my Easter ham! Excellent-moist, tender & flavorful. Bought a 10# Costco ham which served 16 adults & lots of kids at the Easter buffet. Baked @350 deg. 1 hr. 15 mins., then piled on the sauce. It sure looked like a lot of mustard but at the end, most had disappeared. Baked another 30 mins. @350 deg., removed the juice & took it to my daughter's home. Baked 30 mins. @350. Added some cornstarch (no add. marjoram) to the sauce to thicken. Delicious!! Everyone was raving about it & wanted the recipe. This is a keeper.

Wonderful! Made it for a brunch with rave reviews. Had to add it to my Easter menu!

Made this for Easter dinner today. Everyone raved! I used a fully cooked boneless ham studded with cloves, as I was more in search of a glaze recipe. This fit the bill. Baked at 350, and substituted the concentrated OJ with apple butter. Not much leftover!

I used port wine instead of madeira, worked just fine. Great variation on my husbands usual brown sugar and mustard mix.

I get requests to make this recipe all of the time. I have three exceptions to the recipe; first I use a spiral ham, second I don't add the extra marjoram and third I thicken the sauce with cornstarch.

The glaze did become too dark on the top. I thought it was good, but that the garlic was off-putting. If I make this again, I would skip the garlic and follow Verona's advice about cooking it times and temperatures.

Ham was nice and moist but the mustard and sugar burn...not a pleasant appearence.

Simply delicious. I made the first 6 ingred the night before and in the afternoon of the 24th, just popped the whole thing in the oven. Very easy and would love to make this again.

I think this is the best ham I've ever made! The sauce was excellent, I omitted the extra marjoram at the end. I pretty much made it as the recipe stated, except I used apricot preserves instead of the frozen OJ concentrate. I also stuck in cloves and reduced the oven temperature to 350 for the duration and cooked it longer more like an hour and 15 minutes, before adding the glaze. Then another hour at 350, this prevented any burning of the glaze, and the ham was delicious, just perfect! Definite keeper!

We waited until the last minute to come up with a ham recipe for Easter! This one not only looked tasty, but we had most everything. We skimped a bit on the mustard and had to use a little bit of sherry to make up for not enough madeira, but it turned out great! The aroma of it cooking was wonderful and everyone loved it. It did have a good mustard taste. We will make again with all the correct ingredients.

I had trouble getting the mustard coating to stick. For a half ham, I halved the other ingrediants (which was plenty), substituted orange marmalade for the frozen concentrate, and used fresh squeezed orange juice with the Madeira. I kept the oven temperature at 400 throughout, and let the ham sit 20 minutes before carving. The sauce was too intense for my taste. My correct e-mail address is carljoan@attbi.com. I can't seem to change it on this review.

This is my standard ham recipe now. I have made it about three times so far. I cut the mustard in half and I don't add the madeira because I don't have any in the house. The leftovers make great sandwiches.

I've made this three times now; my husband requested it for Sunday dinner last night. He has actually written to friends and family about this ham!! Used a quarter ham (didn't want to be eating ham until 2003!), halved the ingredients and used marmelade instead of oj concentrate. Also, followed the previous reviewers who suggested turning down the heat to 350. I have never made the dipping sauce - the glaze on the ham is enough of a treat!

Rating: 3
Excellent ham! I left out the madeira simply because I didn't have any and used more orange juice. I cut way back on the mustard because the kids don't like the spicy mustard taste and poured some orange juice into the mustard mixture. I also didn't use as much marjoram as it called for. It turned out great. I would like to try it as it is in the recipe but was scared it would be too strong tasting for the kids.

I made this with some trepidation for a B.B.Q. some friends were having. I thought I would have plenty left over for sandwiches for the week. Ha Ha Ha, they were scraping the bone clean. If we hadn't tasted and tested before we left the house, we wouldn't have gotten any.

I made this ham for Easter dinner and got rave reviews from my entire family. I followed the recipe as is. I too turned down my oven to 350 after adding the mustard glaze to avoid burning the top of the ham. The ham turned out juicy and delicious. Will definately make again!

I made this recipe for a dinner party last week, with a few adjustments. I left out the marjoram and added about 3 tablespoons of fresh chopped ginger. I also used a good spiced rum instead of the madeira, because I don't like madeira. It was delicious! The ham was moist and flavorful and the sauce was incredible. I'm thinking about buying another ham just so I can make it again.

I agree with the Traverse chef in that the mustard coating was about double the amount that I needed. I also turned the oven temperature down to 350 degrees to keep the crust from burning. It was definitely worth the trouble though, very delicious!!

The ham was delicious. But--I felt there was double the amount of coating needed. I also turned the heat down to 350 and left it there. The fat was browning too fast. I "tented" the edge with foil until the coating was applied. I didn't use the sauce--too much fat and too much mustard coating fell in (and too much else going on to bother). Basting with the Maderia and oj might be enough.

Rating: 3
We served this ham for Easter brunch to rave reviews all around. The only small problem was caused by increasing the oven temperature to 450F (it singed the crust of the ham) and I agree with other comments that you should skip that step and keep the oven at 400F for the duration.

Rating: 3
A fast add on that makes even a cheap ham taste expensive. Unlike many glazes that in my experience don't add a lot of taste, this glaze sticks to the ham better than most, and makes the taste a little stronger than most.

I prepared this recipe for my family on Christmas day. They loved it. It came out so juicy and tender. I ordered a butt from the local butcher. However it looked a little to large so they cut part of the shank off. I put the cut off end down in the roaster. and cooked uncovered as per recipe, basting occasionally. When coating ham with the mustard sauce, it was too runny, so I litely coated the ham and placed it back in the oven till the coating was sticky. Then recoated heavy with remaining mustard sauce. The mustard sauce has a strong flavor and should served sparingly with carved ham.

This ham turned out wonderfully - everyone loved it! Only change I'd make is to keep the oven at 400 instead of raising it to 450 - the top of the ham burned a bit when I raised the temp. at the end.

Rating: 3
Great Ingredients...definately not your average brown sugar and cloves ham. My only suggestion is to cook it longer at a lower temp (325-350). My ham was definately under-cooked which I found out much too late when it was time to carve and serve. Suprisingly the sauce was mild and not too sweet. Will probably try again.

Everyone who tasted this thought the flavor was out of this world. I also used both portobellos and shittake mushroom.

I made this ham last year for our Christmas party and had many guests say it was the "best ham they ever tasted". I came back to Epicurious to get the recipe again for this year's party. I can't imagine making another entree that we would like as much! Everything about it is great, from the sweet mustard glaze to the wine/orange sauce. I would not change a thing.

I have made this twice already and will do it again for Thanksgiving. Both times have been for company and everyone has loved it. Definately think this is a four fork recipe.

This recipe was a HUGE hit. I had a full house of guests on Easter Sunday and every single one of them said it was the BEST ham they had ever eaten. I put a bit more brown sugar in the sauce mixture, didn't cover the ham at all, but left the oven temp. on 400 until the last 15 minutes. I then turned the oven to 450. I didn't have ANY ham left and everyone had THIRDS OR FOURTHS!!

Yuck! The sauce in this recipe is 'not a good thing' but the mustard glaze on the ham is decent. Next time I'll try the recipe first before serving this to guests on easter!

Interesting flavor the first night, but difficult to use for leftovers later because of the madeira taste in the meat. No matter what you do to it, the odd and unexpected wine/marjoram flavor comes through.

Very good ham receipe. I did lower the temp. to 350 vs 400 and cooked a bit longer. I did not cover the ham... it browned wonderfully and was very tender and moist... I did reduce the wine/mustard mixture to desired consistancy, tasted very good and rich over the slices of ham. If you keep the oven temp a little lower, this is a wonderful slower cooked ham, that tastes great...just keep basting it.

This dish was simply divine. Our guest loved it. The sauce is delicious and the ham was scrumptious. The sauce is very strong, not much is needed.

I laughed when I read the review just below. Similar thing happened to me several times ago. All the evaporating alcohol flash-burned when I opened the oven after about half an hour. Singed my eyebrows and scared me to bits. Nevertheless, this is our favorite baked ham recipe and we raise a whole pig every year so have lots of hams to deal with. I usually use dark Myers rum, orange marmalade instead of concentrate, sometimes leave out the marjoram, and always crack open the oven door slowly and frequently in the beginning.

Caution! Don't cover this ham too tightly. I used the Madeira wine and a roasting pan with a tight lid. 30 minutes into the baking, the pressure blew not only the lid off of the pan but blew my oven door open. There was an actual blue flame flash. It was like a day at the races. The ham was still very tasty but it has a new name at our house; Top Fuel Ham!

Excellent ham. I agree with previous remark that it should be tightly covered to keep the jucies. We shared this with friends for Christmas dinner for the first time making it and were not disappointed! Everyone enjoyed it. (Also had to use Sherry as substitute).

A really, really good ham recipe. I thought my husband would explode -- he just kept eating. This is the second time I made it. The secret is to seal the pan really well with foil so the juices don't just cook off. Try it -- you'll like it.

Wonderful. Made this for part of a Christmas Party buffet table.. easy and delicious. Pulled it out of the oven a hour before serving time - moist, flavorful and still warm, especially with the finger-licking sauce. Used a spiral cut ham for easy of serving. A Keeper!

We thought this dish was very, very good. Guests at a recent party raved about it. The boiled down "dipping" sauce is almost unneccessary and relatively rich...and the ham is very flavorful on it's own, if prepared precisely the way it is explained here (although I will say that we also used Sherry in place of Maderia, with apparently no ill effects). Highly recommended for a twist on traditional Christmas or Easter dinner.

Made this for the second time this Easter Sunday. Wouldn't change a thing. Followed the recipe exactly & it turned out perfectly. Succulent & juicy & my guests came back for seconds & thirds. The ham & sauce are quite rich, so we paired it with a variety of oven-roasted vegetables & a fresh watercress salad. Delish !

I made this ham for Easter and everyone liked it. I used half the dijon mustard listed and a little more brown sugar. My husband said it still had too much dijon. I did not use the whole grain dijon - maybe that would make a difference in the taste of the sauce. A little sauce served on the ham was great.

Don't skimp on the ham. I bought a gorgeous 10lb ham from my local butcher which I am sure made this dish especially exceptional. Don't buy an expensive Madiera. We bought the cheapest bottle of California Madiera at the market and although it was unpleasant to drink the sauce was still wonderful. Don't fret that the mustard will overwhelm. The mustard and marjoram glaze spread on thickly and smelled so strong we could barely smell the ham, but it cooked up to a terrific mellow brown crust that make the entire ham taste amazing. We just loved this recipe.
