Toasted the walnuts, used Greek yogurt, added cumin, coriander, and chicken and it was great on a piece of hole grain. Will definitely add the the afternoon repertoire.

Made this for a work potluck. Substituted Miracle Whip for mayo and omitted walnuts (just in case of nut allergies) - Next time when I make it for myself I'll put the walnuts in for sure. And maybe some different fruits too. Coworkers approved and even asked for recipe :)

I used 1/4 c. of cashews and 1/4 c. of sunflower seeds insstead of walnuts. I served the salad on a bed of baby spinach. Very good!

I also grew up eating this and still enjoy it. I like it best when it's made with more than one kind of apple, ideally a sweet one and a tart one. I use the same dressing my mother did: Marzetti's Slaw Dressing (the original, non-refrigerated one with the blue label) instead of mayo/sour cream. It has more punch than mayo.

Indeed it is a Waldorf salad. I'm no lawyer, but given that Waldorf Astoria is a registered trademark, it's likely that Parade Magazine and Epicurious are simply playing it safe with the generic title.

The reviewer who said why not call this Waldorf Salad was right on. I'm 72 and first ate this when I was 2. Slight variations, but same dish. My mother used "Miracle Whip" and no raisins. I use cranberries instead of raisins. Regular mayo and plain yogurt mixed. My daughter (42) and I made it for her family and guests on Christmas Eve a few weeks ago! Still good after all these years.

Pretty basic - doesn't last too long and isn't too exciting.

I only use plain yogurt with this recipe and add roasted chicken for weekly lunches -- it's yummy. I am going to try using Bosc Pears with extra lean Turkey Ham for a change. I love this recipe

I made this recipe almost exactly as written, and I found it to be a bit disappointing. To be fair, I had to substitute lime juice for lemon juice as I am currently in Honduras and (oddly enough) lemons are not available here. That said, it really needed something more to balance the apples, which are the overwhelming flavor of the dish. If I were to make this again (which I probably won't), I would definitely double the amount of walnuts and use something in addition to the raisins to add a bit more sweetness - perhaps some chopped dates would do the trick.

A wonderful Waldorf-esque salad that with a few modifications (see below) can taste even better and be an incredibly healthy variation on what many of us grew up eating. My husband won't touch yogurt, yet ate 3 servings! The meyer lemon really made this salad sing. Quantities reflect what I had on hand.

Yummers. This classic combination worked really well, even with another variety of red apple (I'm not the biggest Fuji fan, so no loss for me) and without the mayo (but doubling the sour cream).

Why not just call this what it is... "Waldorf Salad". My grandmother taught me how to make this when I was about 8 years old. Its still delish tho, no matter what you call it. I think MacIntosh apples work best, but that's just my preference.

Wow! For the simplicity of this recipe, you get a lot of taste. It only took five minutes to prepare and made a healthy meal; I swapped almonds for walnuts because I don't like them, and used Greek yoghurt instead of mayo/sour cream to make it a little healthier. Great results - next time I'll play around with lime instead of lemon and maybe add tarragon or apple cider vinegar. I'd also add more apples.
