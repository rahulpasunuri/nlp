I found the taste of herbs was too pronounced, but everyone else loved it (ore they were being polite).

Made this last year for Thanksgiving everyone loved it. There were no leftovers.

have made this two years running and it is simply THE BEST. the first time, we had oven problems and it still came out great. so moist, juicy, and flavorful. the garlic was not overpowering to me or any of my guests as others have suggested. it was soooo well received and many said it was the best they've had... even my mother. the second year my boyfriend's father made it and it was equally as good. both times, we've skipped the suggested gravy and have made our own traditional brown gravy. will be making it again this year!

Delicious! I only used one head of garlic, and the garlic flavour still came through well. I also used olive oil instead of Grapeseed since I had none. The onions under the turkey were a great accompaniment as well!

All of my guests raved about this turkey! One even said it was the best turkey he's ever tasted! The rub is what made this turkey great. It really lets the flavors sink in if you put it on the night before you cook it. Delicious!

This recipe was relatively easy, and oh, the turkey!!! I too was told by several of my guests (and my husband) that this was the best turkey they ever had. I had about 30 cloves of garlic in two heads and stopped there. The flavor was amazing! The roasted garlic gravy was the perfect finishing touch. I highly recommend this to anyone who is contemplating making it.

Don't know what the fuss is about this. Too garlicy for my family's taste. The turkey was definitely moist. Would not make again.

I made this without the parsley and olive oil instead of the grapeseed. I cheated a bit and rubbed the skin with one pad of butter. Turned out great and the gravy was amazing!

This one is back again this year! I am using a 22LB Free Range Hen from the last family Turkey Farm. People have come to expect it as it has become our standard since 2005 and everyone seems to love it. I have to pick-up more Spanish Paprika for the Grapeseed Rub. (That's my secret)

We've made this for the last 2 or 3 Thanksgivings and it has always turned out well! We'll be making it again this year!

This truly turned out wonderful and it was my first turkey ever. Left overs were beautifully seasoned.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year. I stuffed it with a herbed sausage stuffing that I make every year. Everyone loved it. I think it had way too much garlic, it was overpowering and came back on you later. Read - bad breath for days!

The light and dark meat actually melted in my mouth! Friends raved about the flavor and an epicurian requested the recipe. Changes Made: Replaced rosemary with dill seeds and dill weed. Added 2 TBSs ginger paste to rub for zing(helped it adhere to bird); Tented bird after first 30 min. of roasting; Basted every 30 min. The turkey was the most beautiful deep golden brown color. VERY little fat in drippings. My turkey came from Branigan's Turkey Farm in Woodland, CA. As for the gravy, I omitted the 2 heads of garlic and added 3 chicken bullion cubes as it didn't have much flavor after seasoning. This will be MY traditional TG turkey recipe from now on!

Too much garlic in the parts of the bird by the herbs (didn't make the gravy), not an overwhelming taste difference in the rest of the bird. I like spicy and flavors and garlic, but this just didn't work for me.

I made this with chicken, and it was great, and got rave reviews. I used olive oil instead of grapeseed. I also added lemon zest to the marinade and filled the cavity with lemon quarters and leftover herb sprigs. It was very tender and juicy!

The herb mixture was heavenly. I did alter the recipe by doing the following: two days before Thanksgiving, I chopped all of the herbs and garlic, placed them in a bowl, and poured olive oil to cover. It was a signficant amount of oil, and became wonderfully infused. The night before cooking, I rubbed down the turkey per the recipe with salt, pepper, and herbs/garlic/oil. Right before, I squeezed a half lemon into the oil mixture. Everyone agreed this was the most tender, delicious turkey they'd eaten!

I used this receipe with a 17.3Lb Organic Hen. I added Spanish Paprika to the Grapeseed oil baste to give the turkey deep brown turkey color without drying out the turkey. I poured a cup of warm white wine over the turkey in the last hour to keep the turkey moist and improve the gravy. I also added a bed of carrots halved on top of the onions as a base for the bird to get is up higher to insure the bottom and sides cooked evenly and flavor the gravy. Some may be distressed by the uneven color the herbs under the skin give to full turkey, but once it is carved it is great. This turkey got rave reviews, my wife said it was the best turkey she ever tasted!

This turkey is amazing! I actually brined it for 20 hours, and it wasn't too salty, it was great. I also used olive oil instead of grapeseed oil and it worked just fine. I made Thanksgiving dinner for 30 people and a handful of people said it was the best turkey they had ever had.

I followed this recipe this Thanksgiving and, personally, it was so-so. My guests said they really liked it though and took second helpings. I love garlic, but this was too much with nothing really to balance the flavors. Beware, my 12lb bird without stuffing took A LOT longer than the recipe says to reach 165 degrees (obviously, it depends on the oven). In the end though, the bird looked great and was very moist, thanks in part to the fresh orange juice I squeezed on it and the constant basting. Oh, I also added a couple of cans of organic chicken broth. I'm so glad I did that.

This was the best turkey I have ever made. The flavor was magnificent and it was tender and juicy. The gravy was also fantastic. Everyone at the table had rave reviews. Make it! You won't be sorry.
