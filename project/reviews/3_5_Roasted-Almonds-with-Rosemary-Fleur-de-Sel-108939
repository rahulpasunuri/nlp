The coating is great - but my almonds were overcooked at 40 minutes. Take them out when you think they're 'almost there' as they will continue to cook out of the oven - I should have stopped after the 3rd 10 minute stint. :(

An easy stand-by! I used marcona almonds and also substituted smoked fleur de sel, lemon sugar and lavender. I wasn't sure if it would work but it totally did. I think this is one of those things that you can really tinker with and have it turn out great. I added extra cayenne and a pinch of smoked paprika for more kick and they still weren't that hot. Cooking time seemed long but it's easy to tell when they are done enough to your liking.

Yummy! Definitely better tasting the next day. Stirring is essential.

Also, do not overcook these almonds. They take me about 25 minutes, checking and tossing every 8-10 minutes. 40 minutes is way too long.

I love these almonds. I have made them countless times and serve them before dinner parties as an appetizer. But, instead of sugar I use agave syrup, and instead of sea salt I just use kosher. This is a winner every time!

I agree with the review by the Cook from Texas. The nuts seemed so-so when tasted immediately after baking and cooling; I considered not bringing them to my family gathering the following day. However, they tasted fantastic the following day; my family and I loved them. The recipe is very easy to make.

eh. this was okay. the cook time was definitely too long and I think it would have been better had it not been overtoasted. Too much sugar, not enough rosemary, can surely be tweeked to be awesome, though.

I cannot imagine not liking this--my husband, I, and all my guests eat them until we can't anymore!

The Pacific ocean is saltier than the Atlantic, so yes...Fleur de Sel is probably less salty than a Pacific salt. The grind also makes a big difference, the finer the grind the stronger the salty sensation will be.

Is Fleur De Sel less salty than Pacific sea salt? I used the latter -- I was surprised it called for so much, so I even scaled it back by a half teaspoon, but yikes they were salty! Very tasty though. I will try again next time with half the salt called for.

3 1/2 forks. Really addictive. I used almonds, pecans, & pistachios. I tasted some rosemary nuts at a catered theater production, and liked them so well that I searched for a recipe. The ones I had previously I think had oils infused with rosemary, so you didn't actually eat pieces of rosemary. I don't like this one as well, but a close second!

Made these for Christmas snacks, and everyone loved them. I can't believe how easy they are to do. I've had two requests for the recipe so far. I used sea salt instead (had it on hand)

After reading the reviews, I made this the day before our faculty Christmas party. (and, I have to admit, I used Kosher salt instead of fleur de sel.) I must have had a dozen requests for the recipe! They seem like not much when you read it over, but they were quite the hit. Nice balance between the salt and bare hint of sweet. I used fresh rosemary, too. Quite lovely, really.

I have made this recipe twice and it was a hit both times plus it does no use any dairy products.

The first time I made this, I tasted the nuts as soon as they were cool enough. I thought they were boring and I didn't take them to the party as I planned. A couple of days later I was looking for a snack, and decided to eat the nuts...they were wonderful. The double recipe I made was gone in no time. This one is better with age, perhaps that's why it's not rated better. I have used fresh and dried rosemary, almonds and pecans, sugar and splenda depending on who was eating. They have been wonderful everytime, (I just make them the night before I am planning on eating them)

We loved this recipe! I've made it half a dozen times now and get rave reviews each time. I've tried it with both blanched and unblanched - each works well. The only difference to the recipe suggested is that I find the almonds are done after 30 minutes of baking.

YUCK! These were terrible! Maybe because I used "skin-on" almonds, but these tasted horribly bland and burned. What a waste; I ended up throwing the whole batch out. Tried another B.A. sweet/spicy roasted nut recipe that was a milion times better, in the November '02 issue. Honestly...DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE!

I thought the idea sounded great, but when we ate them they were just so-so. Not enough salt or cayenne to make a spicy almond, not enough sugar for sweet, not enough rosemary. All in all they tasted like 'health' food. (low fat, low salt) Might be better with fresh rosemary.

Very good! I made these for a party and they were a tremendous hit. However, if you use regular almonds with the skin still on, the cooking time needs to be shortened by about 10 minutes.

These are delicious. They are also addictive.
