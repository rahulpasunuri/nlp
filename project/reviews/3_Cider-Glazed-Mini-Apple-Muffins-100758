I doubled the recipe to make 12 regular sized muffins. It's true that the cider glaze takes a really long time to cook down, so I recommend starting it before you even begin to prepare the muffin batter. Mine never became syrupy, but I just poured it all over the muffins while they were still in the tin. They soaked up the cider really nicely to make a super moist (almost bread pudding-like) batch of muffins. If you skip the glaze, the muffins will certainly be dry and bland.

These came out so dry. Not delicious. I followed the ratios exactly. the glaze is nice, but not nice enough to compensate for a tasteless,dry muffin base. I did not have a mini muffin pan, so made 8 regular-sized muffins.

I used 1/2 cup apple sauce instead of a fresh apple and the muffins turned out superbly. They were very moist and tender and received rave reviews at brunch. I will certainly be making these muffins again.

These were ok. I added 1/2 cup of apple yogurt and a teaspoon of vanilla and they were still a bit dry and somewhat bland.(no nuts) Hopefully the kindergarteners I made them for won't mind. ;)

The muffins are a breeze to make and super tasty. The glaze, however, took a LONG time. I used regular apple cider from the supermarket and it took at least 40 minutes of the cider boiling for it to reach 1/2 cup. Another 15 minutes with the sugar added and stirring continuously to reach syrupy consistency.

These are SOOO yummy! I just finished making them for my 3 year old's b-day in preschool tomorrow. I doubled the recipe and got 36+ mini muffins. I grated one giant macintonsh apple, used cider in the muffins, but juice in the glaze. Skipped the nuts because they're not allowed at school. It all worked out very well and would say do NOT skip the glaze in this recipe. That might be why some cooks found it dry; the glaze soaks in. Also, the glaze is DELICIOUS!

Makes 24 actual mini muffins. I don't know what's with this "sort of mini" muffin size but I got 24 in my seriously mini muffin pans. These are nice. I used frozen apple/passion fruit concentrate for the glaze and it turned out delish.

Really wonderful! I too grated a whole granny smith and they were moist and very flavorful.

Nice little recipe - not spectacular but quite tasty. Two and a half forks really. These were amazing warm but got a bit dry as they cooled (maybe I didn't use enough glaze). Only substitution I made was apple juice for cider - didn't have it on hand. Do start the glaze first.

my kids loved them. These are sweet little morsels and would be a nice addition to a brunch. The recipe whips up very quickly, I took the previous reviewer's suggestion and grated the apple. I skipped the nuts because of allergies and they really weren't missed. I found that the recipe easily made enough for 18 mini-muffins. I couldn't find unpasturized cider (something of a health concern these days anyway) but the local organic cider seemed good enough and didn't require straining. THe resulting glaze is slightly tart and jelly like. My recommendation is to start making the glaze before starting the recipe since it took at least 25 minutes to cook down as specified. A great easy project to do with kids.

Other reviews commented on this recipe being too dry so I used a whole apple and made sure to use a mini-muffin pan. Grating the apple instead of dicing is easier and makes for a nice texture. Definitely a keeper!

hey chef from virginia...so you didn't use cider or cider glaze, the muffins weren't mini and they weren't apple....and yet you still think you made this recipe? It amazes me that you think your comments represent a fair review of THIS recipe...it may only reflect on your own judgement in choosing replacement ingredients.

I multiplied it 4x and used regular muffin cups. They were a bit dry but the taste was good. Pouring the apple juice on the hot muffins helped a lot.

I increased the recipe x4 and added more apple cider to compensate for the dryness and it still came out dry. I did not make the glaze so I don't know if it would make a difference. There are plenty of other apple muffin recipes out there and I think I will stick with those.

I'm a Chef and was looking for muffin ideas for my son's pre-school class. I made regular-size muffins (recipe X4 - 25) and substituted dried blueberries for walnuts and apple juice for cider. Also skipped the glaze and sub'ed cream cheese glaze. Recipe was good, but very dry and added 1/4 - 1/3 C. more AJ to make-up the difference. Also added vanilla extract. Turned out well - moist and good. Son loves it.

I didn't like these muffins as much as the reviews made me think I would. They smelled great,looked great, but I did think they were a bit on the dry side. Maybe I was expecting more "cakey" muffins instead of cornbread like consistency. Still, I had none left over and it's a nice way to use fall apples. I'd melt the butter in the microwave next time: I tripled the recipe to make 6 giant muffins and several mini muffins.

I have no idea where I went wrong...after the wonderful reviews this recipe received, I was surprised my muffins turned out so horribly. Although they looked beautiful, they came out very dense & dry even considering I had to add an unusually large amount of cider to batter (because the initial result ended up looking more like a cookie dough than a muffin batter). I guess even though I added more liquid, it still just wasn't enough. I seriously doubt I would try this recipe again.

This was my first attempt at muffins and they were fantastic! Very easy to make and deliciously light. I took the advice offered in the previous comment and used apple juice instead of the cider.

This recipe was great. I tripled it to make approximately 16 normal-sized muffins. Also, I used regular pasteurized, clear, cheap, unsweetened apple juice, so I didn't have to strain it. It worked really well. The only problem was that since it was unsweetened, I had to add alot more sugar to the glaze than I originially expected in order for it to thicken. Otherwise it was fine. Also, I didn't need to triple the amount of glaze. I used only 3 cups of apple juice and it made more than enough glaze for all of my muffins. They look beautiful and taste amazing!

These muffins were unbelievably delicious and moist. I couldn't find apple cider at the store, so I got cherry cider. It was wonderful. I think you can use any kind of fruit juice for the glaze. Also, the cherry juice I used was pasteurized, and it didn't seem to hurt the recipe. Also it simplified the recipe by allowing me to delete the straining step. Next time I make this recipe, I'm going to double it. These muffins went so fast that we didn't have any leftovers to enjoy the next day!
