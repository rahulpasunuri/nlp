Delicious. I made it with cod instead of shrimp. It does need something acidic at the end--I added some sherry vinegar instead of lemon juice, and it was great.

I made this for New Year's Day and it was delicious and healthy. It will be our new good luck meal of the year! I used a package of organic frozen precooked blackeyed peas - worked great. I cooked the beginning part of the recipe one day ahead, reheated on NYDay and then cooked the shrimp quickly - a very easy meal to put together. Great with some good bread and butter on the side. Leftovers were good too.

This has become a staple on cool evenings. We keep all the basics in the pantry/freezer. Comes together very quickly, with just a bit of prep. Truly delicious, satisfying, one pot meal.

Wow this was really good. I did use more garlic and thyme. I used red jalapeno instead of red pepper flakes and used a freshly roasted red bell pepper instead of green bell pepper. Also didn't have black eye peas so used navy beans. Simmerered the broth so it was not soupy. Added the shrimp last so they did not overcook and get rubby. The flavor of this dish was so good. Served over bed of sauteed spinach, along with a fresh salad and crusty bread and a nice bottle of wine. This is definitely a recipe I will make again for both family and friends.

Based on the reviews, I only used 1 can of beans and added a little jalapeno and 1 teaspoon of blackened seasoning. It had some kick which was nice. I also added some mustard greens for a little more vegatbles!

Use more garlic and more spice. Otherwise perfect and delicious.

I did this the other way around: fried up the shrimp first and then used the same pan to cook the veg and black-eyed peas (less to wash!) This was a great recipe. I upped the heat as well by frying the red chili flakes in oil before throwing in the veg. I didn't add any bacon because I didn't have any but I'm sure it will add a ton of extra flavor when I make this next. A keeper!

Based on the other reviews that the dish could use more spice I added 1/2 jalapeño with seeds; used extra red and black pepper; and allowed the black-eyed pepper mixture to reduce down before I added it to the shrimp. I also added lemon juice at the end. Next time I will cook shrimp for less time than the recipe calls for and consider adding greens to the black eyed pea mixture. Overall, I thought it was a very good dish and plan to make it again. Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Garlicky-Black-Pepper-Shrimp-and-Black-Eyed-Peas-351811#ixzz1JBB6clqy

This was good, but not great! I think next time, I would use less broth, or let it reduce longer. Also, i think I would use more garlic.

Rating: 4
Mmmmm, this was good. Believe it or not, I'm in my late 40's, and I've never had black eyed peas before. Now I know why they are comfort food. I will be looking for more uses for black eyed peas. The shrimp is real easy to overcook; pay attention to the recipe exactly. I am also going to try this with chicken, and a vegetarian version.

This is a good, solid weeknight meal. Pretty sure I'll be putting it into play for my New Year's Day celebration next year, as well.

I made this as described but replaced the bacon with Proscuitto and refrigerated it overnight. That may have allowed the flavors to be more pronounced. I brought the dish in a crock pot to a New Year's Day brunch and everyone loved it.

This was awesome at my house New Years day! My spin... I used a 16oz bag of dried peas and cooked accordingly. I omitted the carrots,celery and hot pepper flakes. I used turkey bacon and I simply removed the tails from the shrimp and dumped them in the brew right before serving along side warm jalapeño cornbread muffins! Yummy!

Rating: 4
Once I'd completed the pea/veggie mixture, it tasted a bit bland so I added some creole seasoning. After adding the shrimp, it became a really good dish! I'd recommend a dash of creole seasoning to the pea/veggies (I used Zatarain's), which added a bit more spice.

Rating: 1
I made this as written and it was not good. It was bland and flavorless. I don't know where all the flavor from the garlic and bell pepper went but they weren't in the dish. This recipe was a waste of bacon. I ended up adding lemon juice like another reviewer said and that perked it up a bit but I still wasn't impressed. Even with Tabasco and Sriracha added on top it had no flavor. I will not be making this again.

Rating: 3
I made this without the bacon because I didn't have any. I think it's still delicious and tastes wonderful. I just used olive oil to cook the peas mixture. I will definitely make this again and will try it with bacon next time.

This dish is a lot better the day after it is cooked and it is perfectly wonderful the day it is cooked. However having it sit in the refrigerator overnight seems to bring out the spicy nature of the dish and it makes left overs something to look forward to.

Very tasty. Didn't use reduced-sodium chicken broth and was a little salty. Next time will omit the 1/4 t salt added to the shrimp. Also, used dried black-eye peas. Cooked 3/4 of a 16 oz bag.

It was just ok. Not good use of prawns in my opinion. Will not make again.

This was outstanding. I tripled the recipe and served it for my mother in law's 91st birthday. Everyone loved it. I followed the recipe almost exactly, but did decrease the olive oil when cooking the shrimp, because did not think it needed to be tripled. Served it with bread, but leftovers were excellent over rice. I will make again very soon.

I am a personal chef and I make this for my employer's family and my own family several times a year. Super easy, quick, hearty and delicious. Best with sauteed greens and garlic bread.

One of the best things I've eaten in awhile... cooked the shrimp for slightly less time and came out nice and tender. Didn't have green bell pepper, so substituted tomatillos I had lying around. Ditto shrimp stock for the chicken broth. All in all, great dish with great flavor and texture.

Rating: 4
I've made this several times and all audiences agree that it's wonderful. Enough spice to give it punch and not enough to scorch the palate. When rushed, I stop by the salad bar and buy the veggies and give 'em an extra chop or so. I never scrimp on the garlic and it's never been overpowering. Lovely comfort food for a cold winter Sunday. Serve with corn bread so that you can sop up the wonderful broth.

This is the BEST use of black-eyed peas I've ever had. They had such a complex flavor han normal. I think this may be the new New Years Day black-eyed pea dish. I devoured it and wished there was more.

Rating: 4
the perfect "good luck all year" meal! i made the pea mixture the day before so flavors could blend more. feeling lazy so chopped all the vegs in the processor together which worked great. heated it up and added the cooked shrimp. forgot the bacon darn it but it was still great. the bacon would have made it even better no doubt but that will go into my fritatta this morning instead. happy new year!

This was great! Made it twice, once as directed, once ala Moosewood with tomatoes, dijon mustard, honey, and sweet vermouth instead of the dry white wine. Both times it was fantastic-restaurant quality stuff.

I've made this about 3 times now and it's really become a staple. Have used scallops in place of shrimp to equally satisfied guests. Would be a great New Year's Day meal!

Delicious & different! Definitely make the beans the day before for best flavor. Then just add garlicky shrimp right before serving.

This was really good and incredibly easy to prepare. I increased the shrimp by 50% and upped the garlic sauteed with the shrimp. Next time I would increase the sauce a bit as well.

This was surprisingly delicious. I hate black eyed peas but decided that I had to try to do something with the ones my husband bought... I used celery seed, turkey bacon and white wine vinegar as substitutes but it came out great! Guess I don't hat B.E.P. so much after all!!!!

Wow - this was unexpectedly great. I used a red bell pepper instead of a green one, but otherwise followed the recipe fairly closely. Really delicious. I highly recommend.

Outstanding dish. I used happy-pig, deep-flavored bacon from a local organic farm and it just took this dish to extraordinary heights. I used a Riesling and (as usual) much more garlic and red pepper. We couldn't eat it fast enough. And be sure to have some crusty bread to soak up all that great sauce.

I just made it for dinner, it was very good indeed, I'm impressed...!! I used pinto bean instead- couldn't find canned blacked eyed peas - with half the ingredient. No fuss and yet gives you that deep flavor - definitely my favorite.

Made this once before and loved it! The only change is that I used red peppers instead of green. Served with white rice. Easy and delicious. Tonight I am making it again, and adding some cubbed ham...yum!

This is absolutely fabulous! It tastes very "authentic Louisiana", and leaves friends asking for seconds! Serve this with the Buttery Cornbread recipe from this site, and with Bell's Best Brown Ale, and you will have yourself a nice little dinner! I have made it twice -- once with turkey bacon, and once with real bacon. Of course the version with real bacon was best, but the turkey version was still very good and is worth trying for a healthier alternative.

Rating: 4
fabulous! my husband said it is definitely one of his new favorites. as a non-bacon-eater, I did as another reviewer suggested & added some drops of liquid smoke. Also added more red pepper flakes than in the recipe (I like it spicy). Quick, easy & very tasty. Will make again for sure.

Delicious. I usually make half a recipe with 3 quarters of a pound of shrimp. Two minor substitutions. 1) Used red pepper rather than a green - wifes preference. 2} I use a dash of Tabasco rather than red pepper flakes. Just dont like the spottiness of the heat. I also recommend backing off on the black pepper: I dont think it needs much. Better to let diners add it at the table. Otherwise made as directed with a bit more broth  half recipe probably needs a little more. I finely chopped the celery, carrots and the pepper  very easy with a santoku knife. Looking at the photo, I would say the food stylist did not. What happens with the fine chopping of the veggies is the flavors combine beautifully allowing the shrimp and the black-eyed peas to be the visual stars. More importantly, you get two basic textures in the mouth - the symphony of flavors with the soft peas and the sweet chewiness of the shrimp. I eat any leftovers the next day  cold. Fabulous.

Excellent! Used onions instead of scallions and added a few splashes of red pepper sauce to up the heat level. Also reduced the wine/garlic broth after moving the shrimp into the black eyed peas, then stirred the reduction back into the whole mixture -- it was really, really good! Forget the rice -- just soak up the juices with crusty bread.

I love this recipe. I just made it for the second time by the book to make sure it wasn't a fluke. Its NOT. Its FABULOUS. Quick, easy, tasty, and delish. I served it with a chewy baguette, and a side salad with a simple vinaigrette. Fabulous.

My daughter and I made this last night. Surprisingly good! I did add a whole chopped jalapeno to add some more heat. Served this with white rice, cheddar cornbread and one of my favorite Cabernets. I will definitely make this again.

Last night I needed a last minute recipe. Something quick, easy and comforting given this weird cold spell in Atlanta. This looked like it fit the bill so I tried it. By far the BEST thing I've cooked up in quite some time. The flavors are absolutely amazing. I couldn't figure out what would go best with this so after agonizing over the decision between jalapeno cornbread, a crusty baguette or rice I just decided to make all three. All went well but quite honestly the broth was perfect all on it's own. I highly recommend this and this will be the star at my next dinner party.

Dinner last night and looking forward to the leftovers! Very tasty and satisfying. Next time I'll use more red pepper flakes -- a little mild for our tastebuds. I might serve it over a bed of rice to absorb every last drop of the juiciness.

I thought this was fantastic! I followed the recipe closely, adding just a little more red pepper flakes. It was a little soupy, which I liked. I served with cheesy cornbread muffins. Will make again for sure!

I often feel that it is hard to coax a lot of flavor out of beans. That is not a problem here. Absolutely delicious, simple to make and a crowd pleaser. I followed the recipe pretty closely, and really the only problem I had was that the recipe says that this serves six. We ran out with four.

it was a lot of chopping but well worth it. i added a bit more red pepper flakes & black pepper so it was nice & spicy. it did come out a bit soupy (as noted in the recipe) which works really well with a nice crusty bread. i will definitely make this again.

SO GOOD! Easy to make too. The flavor of the dish was surprisingly refined yet cozy (if you can describe a dish like that). It was actually even better the next day. NOTE: I must say I did not use real shrimp (husband's vegetarian), but still made it basically the same but with veggie shrimp and no bacon.

well, I didn't have any canned Black Eyed Peas at the time, so I use frozen Crowder Peas which I pre-cooked. The flavors went very well together even though I thought that the Shrimp would get over powered... didn't happen. I'll do this one again!
