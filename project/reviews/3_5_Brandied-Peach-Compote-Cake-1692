to the non-jewish cook - This is a Passover recipe so to be Kosher for Passover, it can't use any type of regular flour. It also cant use dairy products if you are going to serve with meat dishes (assuming Kosher rules are being followed). If you want to make this for everyday use, you can certainly use milk/cream instead of non-dairy stuff. If using regular flour, you will have to adjust the eggs mixed in. The reason the eggs are separated is to whip the whites for volume (since there is no flour, it won't rise). With regular flour you wouldn't need to separate eggs - you probably wouldn't need as many eggs either - but you would have to play around with the consistancy. Hope that helps.

I can't believe that in three years, no one has read this that can answer this for me! Can anyone help? Original post 4/01: Can anyone tell me if it is possible to substitute regular and/or cake flour for the matzoh/potato starch, and if so in what quantity? Also, can I use cream and butter in place of the non-dairy? As I am not Jewish, I frequently find these recipes that sound fabulous, but don't know where to find ingredients and don't know if I can use things I have at home.

A friend and I just made the recipe this week and it was terriffic. Really a good cake. My husband has cut wedges everytime he passes it by and I am trying to control myself. Not at all hard to do tho there are several steps.

My kids request this every Passover, and even during the year. I substitute canned peaches for frozen ones, and it works just fine.

This was, by far, the best Passover cake recipe I have ever made. It was moist and full of flavor. Everyone at my seder thought it was wonderful.

It was very good and I would make it again. I made several adjustments to the recipe as follows: I made it in a 12" springform pan, which made a nice base for a more torte-like feeling. I think this worked out well, as the cake part would have been too dense for the thickness from a 9" pan. I did not to the ring of additional cake, the fruit stayed fine without it. I also added a few pinches each of cinnamon and ginger. I did not add the raspberries, but served them on the side and added them to the middle for garnish. Add more peaches if using the 12" pan. Enjoy. I will be making this again next year.

This was a delicious Passover recipe, very moist. However, I had to make a few substitutions. I looked in vain for frozen sliced peaches, therefore, I substituted fresh pears. The pears worked fine. I do not have a Kosher for Passover foodprocessor so was unable to prepare the vanilla sugar as specified. Therefore, I combined some liquid vanilla with the sugar.
