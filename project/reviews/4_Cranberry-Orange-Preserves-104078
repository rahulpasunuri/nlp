This is delicious, but definitely for those who like a strong marmalade/orange zest flavor. A wonderful consistency--thick and chunky--everyone enjoyed it at our Thanksgiving table.

This is utterly delicious. I loved the slight crunch of the fresh cranberries, and although it's sweet, I used imported Scottish marmalade which tends to be a little bitter, so it cut the sweetness. I think it would be terrific as a replacement for the usual cranberry relishes served on Thanksgiving, and I will make it this year.

Hey, aren't preserves supposed to be for, you know, preserving? I'm sad that these "preserves" only last one week.

Easy to make. Great with the Pumpkin Walnut bread.
