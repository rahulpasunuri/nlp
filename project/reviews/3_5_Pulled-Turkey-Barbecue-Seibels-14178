Making this today! I've made this a number of times before, each time with a considerable amount of dicking around with the original recipe. This time I'm using 6 cloves of garlic, one large Vidalia onion, about 1/2 cup of red wine vinegar, and "cheating" by using a liberal amount of Carolina mustard-based BBQ sauce. I also added a couple of chipotles in adobo. It smells amazing and will have much more flavor than the recipe as written.

My favorite! It's heavy on onion, so I cut that back. I also make it with chicken occasionally. You have to love vinegar to like this recipe!

A very interesting alternative to pulled pork! We made this for a group of 15 people to rave reviews. We are not big turkey fans so instead, used three whole chickens cut up which totalled 5lbs. I think the combination of white and dark meat really added to the overall flavour. The day before our party, I cooked the chicken, removed it from the sauce, then reduced the sauce to a thicker consistency. At that point, I adjusted the flavours to my liking and put it in the fridge. I then re-combined everything the next day and finished the recipe. A really tasty (and stress-free!) recipe for a group.

I agree with the person who said this is like really moist turkey. It is easy, it is a neat way to use a turkey breast, but it is extremely extremely bland.

With some additions, this is delicious! As a previous reviewer noted, bone-in is necessary! I added about 4 chopped chipotles in adobo for more smokiness and heat! Fabulous. Served on buns with extra sauce, pickles, & onions. Yum!

tastes amazing and really easy to make! tweaked it just a bit by adding more garlic, molasses, agave and a bit of allspice. used bone in chicken breasts instead of turkey. needed to thicken sauce a bit but could be because i used a crock pot. flavor was great! loved it! will definitely make this one a lot!

As the second person to review this recipe who has made this several times and found it to be great, I have been confused by the negative reviews UNTIL I made it with a skinless, bonelss breast. Horrendous. Must use bone in skin on. Otherwise if using boneless, skinless, SUBSTITUTIONS: replace hal f the vinegar with chicken broth, double the butter, and add 1/4 cup brown sugar. But with the skin and bone, it's much, much better.

I really liked this recipe. Followed it exactly, although I added some heat. Yes it does have quite a tang to it, but I love tangy, hot foods. I took it to an outdoor BBQ. I made it the day before and used our portable grill to re-heat in a heavy dutch oven. I served it on smaller sized rolls with creamy cole slaw on top! I doubled the recipe without issue. Then froze the left overs, which was also delicious!

This was a lot of fun to make and super easy, a real great dish for a fall party where you plan on doing some informal feeding, or you could even use small rolls and make tiny sandwiches for a superbowl party. The meat really soaks up all the flavor. I reduced the liquid after the turkey was cooked, as some other cooks have done. When it was all said and done it was basically just moist turkey. Perfect! i didnt think it was too vinegary at all... in fact i wonder if the person who said that didn't let it cook the full four hours. It reminded me a lot of cheesesteak, and grilled green peppers would be great accompaniments. however, it was indeed too spicy for the five year old at my table, so I dont think you can assume that this is a kid-friendly dish. if you are serving it to a child i'd cut the Tabasco in half.

we've been making this recipe for years, since it first appeared in gourmet. it's a consistent hit--with adults and children alike. agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer who suggested freezing. it's a great weeknight, reheat dinner! we serve it with southern-style collard greens and cornbread for a super combination.

Great recipe. Buy a big, cheap turkey at Thanksgiving, throw it in the freezer, make up a batch of this at the beginning of the summer, and freeze it in portions or serve for a party. After removing the turkey pieces in the first cooking phase, I strain and discard the solids. Then mix in the shredded turkey and cook the second time according to recipe. Then strain out the turkey, reduce the sauce by 2/3, and mix in the turkey. Try adding grated cheese and shredded lettuce to your bun with this.

This recipe is so easy and quite delicious.

Yes, this is vinegar-y but we liked it. Serve with cole slaw to offset the vinegar. Its nice to have a barbecue recipe that is not pork. I will definately make this again.

This was a tasty recipe. I made it using boneless chicken breast and in the crock pot. It came out great!!

I have made this recipe more times than I can count! Each time I make it friends ask for the recipe. I have also used a pork shoulder instead of the turkey breast and it has tasted just as delicious. Also instead of cooking on the stove I have used a crock pot with the same wonderful results. This recipe has become a Fourth of July favorite with family and friends.

OMG! This has GOT to be THE WORST recipe that I have EVER encountered on Epicurious! If I could rate this a minus zero it would be way too high. I totally wasted good turkey breast on this one. I have absolutely no good comments at all. You might as well have chugged the vinegar straight from the bottle. Tried to rescue it by adding sugar to counterbalance it but ended up in the trash anyway. YUCK!!!!! Skip this one over!

Way too much vinegar. I would suggest a new name - Pucker Up Pulled Turkey!

Brought this to a tailgate party and got rave reviews! Definitely will make again! Couldn't be easier...

I have made this recipe countless times. It freezes well. Always raved about.

I keep some on hand in the freezer all the time. Great stuff. After transferring the turkey to cutting board, the remaining liquid seems a little thin, so I reduce it somewhat, then stir in a bottle of commercial hickory flavored bbq sauce. Also, to spice it up, I add a dried chipotle chili pepper (or ancho, or whatever you like best) at the beginning and simmer it with the turkey.

The first time I try a recipe, I follow the ingredients and instructions and then make changes the following times I make it. With this, I can't think of how I could improve upon it. I had a church pot-luck to go to and discovered I had a large, frozen turkey breast in my freezer but didn't know how to make a good buffet item out of it. With soft Italian buns, it was a huge hit, gobbled up in no time. It takes a long time to cook, but your actual time doing things is not that long.

this is delicious with buttermilk-dressed coleslaw. i used leftover roast turkey and cut the cooking time in half -- in less than an hour, it was shredded and tender. not a fan of ketchup, i substituted it with a larger proportion of crushed tomatoes (~1 c.) and added a bit of brown sugar.
