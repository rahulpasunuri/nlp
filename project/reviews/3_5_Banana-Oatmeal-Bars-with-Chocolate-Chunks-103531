This is a delightful recipe and a nice alternative to traditional chocolate chip cookie bars. I love this recipe becasue it goes together quickly, is a great way to use up bananas and is slightly more healthy than other desserts/cookies. I've read a lot of mixed reviews on this...a lot of people tried to make it more healthy with wheat flour, etc. I think the recipe could stand up to that however the only alteration I made was to use a bag of mini chocolate chips (ghiradelli) vs chocolate chunks. It yields a hit of chocolate flavor throughout mixed with banana...YUM! A huge hit everytime for those that like a banana/chocolate combo!

Actually, this was an okay recipe - not outstanding. Mine was not a "bar", it was truly cakelike. I wonder if it was becasue I used 3 bananas (too much moisture?) Anyway, glad to use up my ripe bananas in a new way.

My family love these ! Very good healthy snack ... especially with the tweaking thanks to others and my own :) Halved butter and added 1/2 cup ground flax. Use 1/2 amount of sugar and WW pastry flour, double the amount of oatmeal and use 3 mashed bananas. Instead of adding choc chips I melt chocolate and put in ziploc bag, snip off corner and drizzle over cut bars. Look fabulous and cuts on choc calories !

These are so yummy - I've made them a couple of times. Perfect way to use over-ripe bananas if you aren't in the mood for banana bread. Plus - what's yummier than bananas and chocolate?! I love reading reviews on this site to come up with new inspirations for cooking. Today I made these using pumpkin and sunflower seeds as another review suggested. Thanks!

My kids really liked these. I halved the sugar and substituted 1/2 cup of applesauce for one of the sticks of butter. I also substituted wheat flour for one of the cups of regular flour. Next time I will use 3 bananas, add more oats (I did not add any nuts this time) and cut back on the sugar even more.

My kids beg for this bar. I have made a few changes. I changed the flour to 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour and 1/2 oat flour and cut down on the sugar using only 1/4 cup replacing the sweetness by using a small (kid sized0 organic vanilla yogurt. Yummy!! I also bake these bars in a smaller pan as we prefer them thicker.

great recipe, but i made it my own. only used half the butter and sugars and added an extra banana and 3/4 cup of peanut butter. swirl a little jelly and peanut butter oatmeal topping on top before baking and omit the chocolate. i made banana-pb-jelly bars! i guess its a whole new recipe now. **note the minimized baking times recommended by others

I followed this recipe to a 'T' and it cooked in 20 min NOT 45, so you might want to check yours halfway through. My family liked this recipe enough for me to make it again but I don't think it tasted banana enough. I would replace one of the teaspoons of vanilla with banana extract maybe. A good bar cookie and it wasn't cakey like other people said.

Rating: 2
Good inspiration but I'm afraid I may have altered it quite substantially: 1/2 cup (125 g) all purpose flour 1 cup (250 g) quick-cooking oats 1 tsp baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup (125 g) unsalted butter, room temperature 1/4 cup (60 g) sugar 1/2 cup (125 g) packed golden brown sugar 2 large mashed ripe bananas 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 3/4 c (100 g) semi sweet chocolate chopped into chunks It was not as cake-y as some have complained and definitely sweet enough.

These were ok, but too cake-like, I prefer bars that are more cookie like. I also decreased the sugar because the amount called for was obscene.

Rating: 3
Used 4 bananas, extra 3/4c of oatmeal, only 1c each of sugars and instead of chocolate chunks added roughly 2c of mixed toasted sunflower seeds, slivered almonds, pumpkin seeds, and some flax seeds. also added about cup and half of chocolate covered raisins. not out of the oven yet but I'm sure will be fantastic. baking in a 9x13 covered with tin foil to avoid over browning.

These are a nice homey dessert bar. Not a gormet item so enjoy them for what they are. I made a few adjustments that turned out very good. I used 2/3 cup of canned pumpkin and added 1 tbl of pumpkin pie spice then instead of all the chocolat end nuts I added what I had on hand which was: 1/2 cup choc chips, 1/2 cup white choc chips, 2/3 cup pecans, 1/2 cup sliced almonds, 1 cup raisins. Also, if the texture of your bars is wrong perhaps you are not mixing it right. Remember to crem the butter and sugars till nice and fluffy before you add the eggs and the rest. also I used the pan size suggested(my oven temp is right on ) and I only had to bake them for about 30 min. longer and they would have been really over done. Oh yea. I also topped them with a streusel topping before baking and that was nice too.

I was looking for a way to use up a large bunch of very ripe bananas and thought this recipe sounded appealing: similar to banana bread but a little different. I read most of the previous reviews and made the following revisions: 2 cups whole wheat pastry flour; 2 cups oats; 1 stick butter creamed with 1/4 cup peanut butter; 1 cup of each sugar; and 3 bananas which measured in at 1 cup. My kids said the bars were AWESOME. I thought they were a little sweet and I would probably use less chocolate chips next time. Also, I did not have a 15 by 10 inch pan so I used a slightly smaller pan but cooked the bars for 45 minutes.

Rating: 0
Ok, but not 31/2 forks. I used regular oats and more banana- they were a bit to moist, so will try another time with 1 1/2 cups butter and one cup of each sugar and the increase of banana and regular oats (I never use quick-cooking oats as the texture of regular or steel cut are much superior in my opinion)

Too much sugar! Cut it in half!!! I added sunflower seeds, raisins, chopped apricots and a handful of chocolate chips. I would make it again - but without all that sugar.

I am always having a problem making baked goods for my picky son. He won't eat cookies, or cakes, BUT he will eat these. He loves them. I made something similar last month and he went nuts. So I decided to try this recipe today and he liked it a lot. This will be a lunchbox treat for him in the first days of school. Great and easy to make. I used the standing mixer to make the batter. I also used half Splenda, 1/2 sugar as I ran out of sugar. These smell amazing as they bake. Great and I will make them again.

Yum, I reduced the butter down to 3/4 cup and did have chocolate half butterscotch chips because I like the "all in one" bars. If you see a negative post about this recipe, ignore it, these are too good to be true

I am surprised by the overall positive reviews for this recipe. This was supposed to be a no-brainer use for my very ripe bananas. Instead, it was a waste of some very expensive, imported chocolate. The bars were doughy, tasteless and did not resemble any "bar" I have ever made. I did as other reviewers suggested by adding a little more banana and cutting the sugar to 1 cup each. A real waste in my opinion. I tossed the whole batch!

I had this recipe for a long time before I made it because I was looking for the right occasion for a semi-dessert with two sticks of butter. Found one, made it, and it was delicious. Used toasted hazelnuts and extra bananas. For the size of the pan I figured two sticks of butter would be fine - it wasn't greasy or too buttery, just very moist, almost too moist. The chocolate chunks were the best, especially with the hazelnut crunch! Very good and easy.

A nice change from plain old banana bread. In future, I think I'd substitute coconut or dried fruit for the chocolate bits.

NOTE to review readers. IGNORE the so-called "advice" below and try making these bars as written! I listened to the other users and left out one stick of the butter and reduced the sugar. Yuck! The result was a dry, spartan, Puritanical treat. So I re-made the bars exactly as the recipe suggests, and they were wonderful. Who are these people who have to cut the fat and sugar out of everything? These bars are grand just as they are... enjoy!

Mine turned out delicious. Served them with fresh strawberries and whipped cream and they were eaten up quickly. Thank you all the previous reviewers - I followed many of the suggestions!! I reduced the sugars (1 cup of each) and butter (3/4 cup), increased the bananas (3 medium sized), used chocolate chips (1 1/2 cups) and added a tspn of cinnamon. If you want a more solid bar (as opposed to a cake like texture) reduce the amount of baking powder (I put in 1 tspn instead of 1 tblspn). I also cooked mine for about 1 hour so it was cooked through. I've frozen the left overs as a future treat!

talk about a rich treat! I followed advice of others and cut to one stick of butter and added 4 bananas and cut the sugar too, but I used just brown sugar and sugar in the raw and added flaked coconut, grahmn flour and whole wheat flour. They turned out perfectly decadent.

I decreased white sugar to 1/2 c and brown sugar to 1 cup and ONE stick of butter (with butter prices so high, this is good news!). Definately sweet enough esp. with chocolate chips. Baked in jelly roll pan, convected at 330 for 25 minutes. They came out moist and I will make them again.

Rating: 4
Excellent, had to make in 9x13 pan as larger pans don't fit into english ovens! Used bit less than 1C of each sugar, about 1/4 stick less butter. Added a dash of mixed spice (like allspice) and 3 medium bananas. Came out cakey and moist after only 20 minutes. I think will use another banana next time, increase the oats and experiment with adding a bit of sour cream, yogurt and dash of treacle (like molasses) next time. Also, I think key is to not overcook and almost have them slightly underdone as cooling time in pan will allow for extra cooking a bit.

Rating: 3
I made these last night and brought them to work this morning and they were gone in a flash! I too used only 1 stick of butter but also added 2 T peanut butter to give it a little extra hint of something (which I might try using a little more next time). I also tried 1C of both sugars and using 3 bananas as suggested before. I left out the pecans and used one 11.5 oz bag of ghirardelli double chocolate chunks instead. Would definately make these again!

Rating: 4
Great recipe! Cut the sugars both to 1 cup each, could do a bit more next time. Added 1 1/2 cups oatmeal, 3 large bananas, 1-12oz bag semi-sweet chocolate chips. Could cut back to 1 1/2 cups next time. Uesd toasted walnuts. Lined glass 9x13 with foil, buttered and floured. Once cooled, you can lift out peel off foil and cut into nice bars. Baked @ 325 for 40 minutes, increased temp tp 350, baked 10 more minutes. Excellent!

This recipe is an excellent way to get rid of very ripe bananas that no one wants to eat. Followed the advice of previous reviewers, used 3 large ripe bananas; cut sugar down A LOT to 1/2 c white and 3/4 brown; used 1 1/2 c semi sweet chips, altho' that may have been a tad too much. Baked them in the recommended pan (it's actually a jelly roll pan), lined with parchment and sprayed with Pam, for about 45 minutes. Drizzled the top with melted dark chocolate before cutting. Hint: let them cool completely before cutting with a pizza cutter, they cut more cleanly. The kids claimed not to like them, then proceeded to gobble them up!

Rating: 4
Okay, here are my two cents -- no one, NO ONE needs this much butter or sugar, even if this is a treat. But my son loves the combination of bananas and chocolate so I decided to give these a try. I cut the butter to one stick, cut both sugars down to 1 c. each, and added a third banana. I had great results, in fact, there was still plenty of room to cut back on sugar. Next time I would do 3/4 c. of each, they were PLENTY sweet, and soooo good with a glass of cold milk!

Rating: 3
I've been making a variation of these since I was a kid (some 20 years now) and have always been my favorite after-school-snack (or after-work, now.) My fiance forces me to make them for him once a month, and by substituting 1c. whole wheat flour & 2 bananas, I can tease him into believing they are "good for you!" then... This version is very sticky (cook 55+ minutes in a brand new oven) but line with parchment paper and a spritz of cooking spray, then cut with a pizza cutter and they'll slide right off the pan. Enjoy!

I actually like how these taste, but having made them twice now, following the recipe to the letter, they always turn out crumbly. They're just not the consistency (slightly chewy) I expect in a bar. And they're hard to serve for company when they're all falling apart.

Rating: 3
Yum! I used two bananas, half white flour and half whole wheat, egg replacer instead of eggs (as I do for cookies, regular oats, 1 1/4 cup milk chocolate chips. Since I used a 9 x 13 pan, they came out thick and moist like brownies. Needed ~1 hour to bake. Had problems with them sticking to the pan. Next time I think I'll try replacing half of the butter with apple sauce to lighten them up a bit.

I read the other reviews and made modifications to the recipe, and it turned out fantastic! I had a larger baking sheet than the one in the recipe, so I added 1/2 cup more of flour and 1/2 cup more oatmeal. I added 3 bags of chocolate chunks, and added 2 tablespoons of creamed coconut (in the Spanish foods section of the grocery store). The result was chewy and rich but not greasy. I cut the bars into 1 inch squares and they were a huge hit with guests! I will definitely make these again!

This recipe has 3 good things going for itself: bananas, chocolate and pecans. However, I thought the recipe was too sweet and too buttery (even after it cooled, it was oozing with butter). The oatmeal gives it body and helps soak up some of the sogginess from the bananas and all that butter. I'd definitely cut back on the butter and sugar when I make it again.

My son Alex and I made this together. We added the extra banana and cut the sugar to a cup of each. I also added a big spoonful of molasses, which added a nice tang and substituted walnuts. It was like a banana bread without the pound cake weight.

This recipe was good, but not great. I increased the bananas to three and reduced the sugars to one cup each. It was definitely sweet enough, but the banana tast was somewhat mild. The flavor was good, but the consistency was a little off. I used chocolate chips, but I recommend increasing the anount by at least half.

I did what the cood from Toronto did (reduce sugars to 1 cup each, added 3 soft bananas, cooked in a 9x13 pan for 40 min) I didn't add cinnamon, but I could see that also being good. I also used Ghiradelli Double Chocolate chips (the best) Over all a great little recipe for old bananas.

I made this recipe last night. Two large bananas measures a little over 1 cup (probably close to 1-1/4 cups). I reduce both sugars to 1 cup each and used 8 ounces of chopped belgium (chopped finer--about 1/4-inch chunks). Didn't have the pan requested so I baked the bars in a 9x13-inch baking pan for 1 hour. Came out perfect--color was a darker brown, but still very good and moist. My son who hates banana bread didn't want to eat it at first, but ask for seconds when he tried this. Great recipe with my adjustments.

I made this a little differently, but I was pleased with the results: 1. Used a 9x13 pan. and 2. Increased the amt. of bananas to 3-4 for a better banana flavor. Between these two factors alone, I had to bake this sucker (easily) an extra 20 minutes longer. I covered the top with foil while baking as to prevent extra browning on top. I would probably line the pan with waxed paper the next time around to avoid the sides getting to done as well. Other than that, rave reviews.

These are a definite keeper. 4 bananas, cut each sugar to 1 Cup, used chocolate chips. Kids and husband loved them. I think the extra bananas help keep them moist; we're on day 5 and just starting to get stale.

I actually got this recipe from Bon Appetit's 2001 cookbook "Every-Night Cooking," and it looks like they adjusted a few parts of the recipe, including fixing the typo in the amount of banana (2/3 cup) and removing the word "banana" from the recipe name ... which perhaps helps adjust people's expectations of how much banana they should be tasting. It's more like a subtle hint of banana. We think they're great & will make them again, but probably reducing the amount of sugar. I used 6 oz. semi-sweet chocolate chunks, so no chopping, and it was just right. I agree with a previous reviewer, this would be tasty served warm with vanilla ice cream.

These are really good. I also use chocolate chips (Ghirardelli Double Chocolate). I find they dry out within a day or so (my small family is slow to finish a whole batch), so I zap one in the microwave for 15-20 seconds to freshen it a little before serving.

Tasty and easy to make. I didn't have any ripe banana so I used a jar of baby food. I am sure they would be better with the real thing. Use chocolate chips instead of bars, easier and less expensive. Liked using the jellyroll pan because it made a lot of bars, but would bake it for less time next time. To dress the bars up a bit I melted good quality white and dark chocolate and used a fork to drizzle the melted chocolate on top.

These were fantastic! Rich and dense, with wonderful flavor. They're not heavily banana-flavored though, so those looking for a real banana-y cookie will be disappointed. I adapted the recipe as follows: used 2 large bananas, substituted chocolate chips for the bars, and baked it in a 9x13 pan.

A snap to make. I added about two tablespoons of cocoa powder to the dry ingredients. Only used the two bananas.......more of a banana smell than taste when they were finished. Great cake-like bars. Would add a few more chocolate chunks next time. Worth using good quality chocolate chunks over chips if you have them on hand. Cooked for close to 50 minutes.

I will never make banana bread again. This recipe is great. I too used more then 1/3 cup banana. I also used chocolate chips because that's what I had. I think I may have used too many, the chocolate over powered the banana flavor a bit. This makes very dense (heavy) bars, but my family is raving over them.

I have made this recipe 3 times in two weeks! My family loves it -- a great change from banana bread. I, too, ignored the 1/3 cup bananas and used two large, very ripe ones. I didn't have any problem with the baking time (I always bake in metal pans sice they conduct heat more evenly), and the bars turned out moist yet nicely browned. A great recipe!

Rating: 2
I baked them in a pyrex 9*13 pan and they certainly needed way more than the 25 minutes someone suggested. Infact, they needed more than 50 minutes. I should have stuck to a muffin or bread recipe. Not nearly as good as a blondie. Don't bother.

I am a cook at a small private school. I multiplied the recipe by eight, substituted chocolate chips for the chocolate chunks, and made these for lunch for the kids last week. This was one of the best-received desserts I have made, and a number of staff members requested the recipe. I will certainly put it on the menu again!

I haven't made this recipe yet, but I was struck by an obvious mistake in it at first reading. 2 large bananas definitely do not measure 1/3 cup! Maybe those who were disappointed added only 1/3 cup banana? I can see where that would impart very little banana flavor, and affect the texture as well!

I made this for snack at my daughters preschool. Trying to be a bit healthy I decreased each sugar by about half, used equal parts white and wheat flour and increased the banana by one.

I thought I'd love these (bananas & chocolate!), but although the flavor was OK, the bars completely fell apart on me -- great if you like eating crumbs. I accidentally used rolled oats, not quick-cooking and that could be it??, but I'll make banana bread or muffins next time.

After reading the reviews, I thought these would be really good, despite the presence of oatmeal. (I'm not a big fan of oatmeal in baked goods.) But, I was NOT impressed with these.

I have made these 3 times since early July - everyone loves them! I add three bananas and use mega choc chips and omit the nuts, margarine worked just as well as butter.

Absolutely the best way to use those last two bananas that nobody will eat. I used less sugar, three bananas, and chocolate chips. Baked in a 9X13 inch pan (who has 10X15?), they turned out moist and perfectly done after just 30 minutes.

I halved this recipe and made it in a pan that I later realized was too small when the bars turned out too tall. However, I used chocolate chips instead of chunks and absolutely loved these bars. I didn't think they were too sweet at all, and actually thought they were somewhat like a banana flavored blond brownie. I'll make a whole batch next time in the recommended size pan.

Wow, I must be the only person who bought bananas special for this dessert! I just moved into a new house and I'm not sure of my oven yet. I saved these bars from a disaster! They must have baked for 25-30 minutes and were done. Based on a few reviewers I skimmed the tops of the sugars and they weren't too sweet. I also used 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips. I'll definetly make these again and keep a watchful eye on them too.

Way too sweet, and I have a raging sweet tooth. I would make it again but adjust for more oatmeal, less white sugar, and a different pan. I made it in a insulated jelly roll pan and the bottom was a bit wet. I would also use chocolate chips next time as the chunks seemed too big.

Following the advice of a previous reviewer, I used Hershey's mini kisses- the whole bag. They were very delicious. I left out the nuts but would add them next time because I think would add to the texture. I pulled these from the oven a minute too soon because the top looked a little more than golden. They could have stood to cook an extra few minutes. But all in all very good, especially if you're a banana lover with a sweet tooth.

These are delicious! I used a cup+ bananas and left out the nuts. I will make these again.

Very tasty recipe! I didn't bother to measure the banana, I just used two medium ones. Turned out fine. These would be good with a giant scoop of vanilla ice-cream.

I made them for a bbq and my friend's family were hiding them from each other and fighting over them.

I am thrilled with this recipe. It was easy, the flavour is excellent and it came out exactly the way it was supposed to. I added 3 tablespoons of wheat germ to the batter and sprinkled granulated sugar on top after the bars were already cool. Lovely. I used chocolate chips(semi sweet), since I had them in the house. I would add 2 cups next time instead of one.

Simple and yummy! A nice way to use up extra ripe bananas rather than the typical banana bread.

I wasn't overwhelmed by these myself but my co-workers sure lapped them up & several people asked for the recipe. I agree that two bananas don't = 1/3 cup. I mashed up two medium to large ones & dumped it all in. The batter seemed just fine. Please note - when they say to use a 15 x 10 x 1" pan, they mean just that. I tried to get away with a 15 1/4 x 10 1/4 x 3/4" pan. Big mistake. Batter bubbled up & overflowed the too-shallow pan & I had a nice clean-up job on my oven. These keep well for several days.

These were a little too sweet for my taste, but I passed them out to friends at the end of a triathlon today and everyone gobbled them up! I don't think 1/3 cup of bananas = 2 large; I mashed both bananas and threw the whole thing into the batter. It came out OK!

have made these twice and they are lovely. i made them in 2 differant size pans - one time in a 9 by 13 inch pan and they were 2 inches high and had to cook a bit longer , and then just the other day in a 15 by 10 pan and they more resembled a bar cookie - but still deliciious.

My husband is not a banana fan but enjoyed these bars! I had a little trouble with the timing as the top went golden long before the centre was done. If there are any suggestions on how to remedy this I would appriciate the input.

These are delicious! But I think it is more like a cake than bar cookies...I used a combination of chocolate chips and cut up hershey bars, and they turned out great. I will definitely make these again when I have old bananas!

Never again will you wonder what to do with too-ripe bananas. Wow.

Delicious! I substituted almonds for the pecans and used dark chocolate morsels, and the bars turned out scrumptious!

These are delicious! I had some soft ripe bananas going to waste, no candy bars but I did have a ll.5 oz. bag of Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Chocolate Chips and used the whole bag! They are richer than regular chocolate chips and larger so I didn't have to chop anything! Also I mashed two regular sized bananas and it equaled l whole cup, threw it ALL in and it came out perfect! Don't forget to toast the nuts. My mother who doesn't usually like dark chocolate, just took a bunch home! Texture is like a moist buttery brownie/blondie. Yummy! They are dissappearing from kitchen fast! Can't wait to make these for next neighborhood pot luck party!

Delicious!! The chunks of chocolate were yummy. Another alternative for those overripe bananas; I think banana-nut bread is a distant second to these bars.

Absolutely terrific. Moist and luscious. I made them with Hershey's mini kisses, which I strongly recommend -- a nice milk chocolate flavor. I had to cook it a little longer than the recipe recommended -- the first test revealed a soggy interior maybe cause my bananas were so ripe. Yummy.
