I just made these with 1 cup of ground almonds mixed with a little almond extract, and raisins (soaked). I was a little wary about using the paddle, rather then the dough hook, but it worked really well! The dough is quite soft, but turned out beautifully.

just finished making these rolls. the dough was very sticky, so i was a bit worried, but it rose beautifully and was easy to shape into a rectangle. i used buttermilk instead of milk, dried cranberries (did not soak them) and substituted brown sugar in the filling. i aslo used a bit of orange juice in the glaze. the buns are very light and fluffy. would definitely make these again.

This are the the first cinnamon buns I ever tried. I used 2 tsp. of cinnamon and they turned out excellent. I sure put the recipe in my collection.

I made these buns in my bread machine- using standard common sense of putting in all wet ingredients first (using totally melted butter), then the dry ones, and the yeast on top in alittle well. The bread machine mixed it all, and it rose inside. Then I did the filling and baked in the oven. Worked like a charm.

This is an excellent recipe for soft cinnamon rolls. Too often recipes turn out tough, dry rolls that hurt the jaw when you try to eat them; not these! They are also excellent without the pecans or dried fruit, just the cinnamon and sugar (I made them for a group that disliked nuts and dried fruit and they were just as delectable as with).

Well worth the time, but you should double the amount of filling and butter for that "Cinabon" taste. If you really want to wow em, try topping these with the recipe for Pine nut-Orange Caramel Sauce. I gurantee your brains will fall out!
