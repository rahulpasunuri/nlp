The recipe works great for basic pies like pumpkin. I find that using a grater to get the butter more incorporated works better than just using chunks - similar to a puff pastry dough.

I'm trying to break away from using shortening in my pie crust and cookies. Often, the results aren't always as good using only butter. This recipe, however, produced excellent results. I'm sure using the technique of smearing the finished dough to blend the butter added to its success.
