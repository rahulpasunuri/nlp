Same as Aprilc... I needed to add another egg and quite a bit of water in order to knead the dough to the right consistency for rolling.

This recipe made noodles that were heavier and drier than I would have preferred. It was very difficult to roll out the dough to the recommended thickness.

I knew something was off from the start... I had to use a whole extra egg, and even a bit of water, to get the dough not to be crumbly. The cooking time was longer than stated in the recipe, and the cooked noodles were very heavy.
