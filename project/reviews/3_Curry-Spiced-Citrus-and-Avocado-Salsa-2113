this was enjoyable, but maybe a touch bland, even though i had fabulous avocado from the neighbor's tree. i ended up adding citrus juice and cilantro for extra flavor and color. if i had had it, i would have added some very finely diced jalapeno. i would probably not make it again, as there are too many other recipes out there.

A delicious alternative to the classic avocado- cilantro duo. I shortened up the prep time (which looks to be impossibly long if you manage to do all 3 pieces of fruit) by just doing half the recipe with 1 orange. I missed out on more curry, which would have added zing. In the end, it was thoroughly delicious. I served it as a salad over a bed of lettuce. Yum!

FABULOUS. . .a delicious salsa that we've served several times over grilled salmon. I used a spicy curry, added cilantro, and didn't use oil. I marinaded the salmon with a curry, ginger, oil, lime, garlic and scallion marinate, and it was a lovely compliment.

This is a great recipe and not really that hard to prepare (removing the pith from the oranges is probably the most time-consuming). It is a very tasty salsa to add over top of fish and rice. Makes a boring dinner exciting! Definately a keeper.

This inventive dish sounds great on paper but actually took longer to prepare than it was worth. I followed the recipe exactly and the salsa was way too sweet to be enjoyed as a dip. To make up for this sweetness, i added more salt and some tomatillo sauce (used in guacamole) to add complexity. This just toned down the sweetness and made the salsa bland. After playing around with different additional ingredients, I was forced to give it up and call it quits.

Flavor was great, but hard to remove mebrane from ripe juicy oranges (no problem with grapefruit). Make sure to use a hot curry. Unless you can find firm oranges the appearance is somewhat muddled. Would be geat with sea bass or swordfish
