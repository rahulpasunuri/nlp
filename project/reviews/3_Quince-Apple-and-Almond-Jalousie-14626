I read the other's reviews before making this and only quartered the quinces before cooking. I was a little concerned that they would be too sticky to slice after cooking but they weren't. They sliced easily with no mess. I otherwise followed the recipe as written and we were very pleased. It was lovely and tasted great. I will definitely make this again.

An unusual but still approachable dessert. The jalousie form was lovely; I also made it as a double-crust pie but the jalousie form really sealed the deal. The first time I made it, I neglected to cut the quince quarters into strips and I did not have a problem with them disintegrating; this was a bit of a problem (as it was with the previous reviewer) when I made it again, cutting as directed in recipe. I'd leave in quarters from now on, as cutting down on the cooking time to prevent disintegration doesn't allow for the full flavor of the quince to be released. I added a bit of cinnamon, cardamom, and vanilla extract, but think it would have been good without these items.

Looked gorgeous, tasted great! Pastry was buttery and flaky. I omitted the almonds and almond extract. The filling came out on the tart side but very delicious, and pretty, too, with the pink quince and white apple slices. Next time I'll make it with the nuts and extract and cook the quinces for less time. They started to disintegrate after two hours of simmering. Also, line your baking sheet with parchment. Some juices bubbled out along the seams and I had to hack away to pry it loose from the sheet.
