Very tasty, easy, and filling. I made it open-faced and used rosemary sourdough. I also used a slice each of red and yellow heirloom tomatoes which added some presentational interest.

This was definitely a success! All the different flavors combined was just excellent! I've always been looking for a quick and easy breakfast meal that is still delicious! I will definitely make this more often. Thanks!
