My family loved this flavorful pizza! I made a few changes by using regular bacon (trimming the fat)and slivered pepperoncinis. I omitted the balsamic vinegar as well and added a small amount of mozzarella and parmesan. I will definatly make this again

I really liked this recipe. I didn't find it too salty but I didn't add any over the pizza due to all of the flavorful ingredients. We tried it both hot and room-temp and I suggest serving it hot (or warm).

We've had this pizza for a main course, and have used it as an appetizer. It is excellent for both. We love the sweet/sour taste of the carmelized onion with the gorgonzola cheese. Very good!

I thought this pizza was overrated. We had to bring a pizza to a pizza party. There were 5 people there and 5 out of 5 people thought it was just ok. I am not sure why some people gave it such a great review. I would never make it again.

My husband and I had a "pizza party" with friends recently. We gave each person a small crust (bought at an Italian deli) and we laid out different prep stations with the ingredients for several kinds pizzas (including instructions) for each to make their own. This was one of the options available and it got good reviews overall, although some substituted the Gorgonzola for other kinds of cheeses. In the future, I would use more prosciutto than called for and would use a little less Gorgonzola (or another cheese). Overall, I liked the ingredients and would make this again.

This was a very hearty pizza. Very well suited to eat as an appetizer.

This was good, but not worth all the work for a pizza.

Made this for my in-laws for lunch. It was fantastic! Everyone loved it. I would definitely make it again and again. I used more gorgonzola and more prosciutto than it called for. It was still awesome!

I was very nervous about this dish as I was making it because it has a lot of very strong flavors but it was AMAZING! I suggest making your own crust (I bought the dough from a local pizza place)

This is one of my favorite dishes to bring to pot luck parties. It is always a hit and there is NEVER any left over at the end of the night. The flavors of the onions and the cheese are fab. I am not sure why there was a bad review. This recipe is outstanding.

Based on the previous reviews and the ingredients list I thought this "pizza" would be terrific. It wasn't. We thought it was horrible. If you are searching for a good pizza recipe, keep looking, this is definitely not it.

Outstanding flavor, and very easy. I added some sauteed portabello mushrooms, finely chopped for variety. Also, I made my own dough (from Bon Appetit - July '97) with fresh rosemary kneaded into the dough.

This recipe is awesome! I've already made it 3 times, and my husband and I just love it. We also use a homemade crust, made in the bread machine. I added It's delicious!

I have made this pizza two times within one month. With a backlog of 6 years of Bon Appetit and Gourmet mags, that's quite a testament as I rarely make the same thing twice. This is definately a keeper. Its delicious, easy and goes great with a nice zinfandel.

I've already made it twice. The store bought crust makes it easy and convenient. The combination of the sweet onions and the salty gorgonzola makes it taste fabulous.

I was disappointed to see that you used a pre-made crust for this dish. Pizza crust is so eazy to make and so much better when fresh that it's a shame not to make your own. Perhaps it would have been better to add a dough recipe and note that pre-made crusts could be substituted but not preferred.
