I was so excited to find a wonderful recipe for arugula. I found this to be extremely bland. It tasted like salad with only olive oil despite the fact that I let the dressing marinade for an hour. It might be better with the addition of more lemon juice and garlic, or garlic salt.

This was great exactly as written. A very unique salad. I'd make it again but this is definitely only for a special occasion as it's a lot of work just for a salad ;)

I would make this again but I am not sure about the dressing. I followed the recipe exactly, and when I first tasted the dressing I almost spat it into the sink. Piquant, puckery--and I like strong flavor. Sallying forth, I let it sit on the counter for an hour or so, and found it mellowed out a little. I served it alongside salmon with roasted fennel and thyme, which it was OK next to . . . but my guests loved it and had seconds (of salad!) so I guess that's what counts, right?

A nice salad, well rounded (even though I am a big fan of cheese in salad, and this had none). Was a wonderful dish to serve along a savory cheese and onion tart. My guests commented on the wonderful dressing!

This was a very elegant and tasty salad. My guest enjoyed it so much, some asked for seconds.

This was delicious. Very flavorful and refreshing. Used real French mesclun, which was great. Served as a starter. Will definitely make again.
