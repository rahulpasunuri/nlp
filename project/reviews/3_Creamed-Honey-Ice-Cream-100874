Made it as is and thought it was quite honeyish, it was good just not great. Next time I will cut down on the honey

My family loves honey. This ice cream is wonderful, just a hint of the main flavor. Even those who could not guess it was honey, still thought it was the best ice cream ever. Yea, a success!
