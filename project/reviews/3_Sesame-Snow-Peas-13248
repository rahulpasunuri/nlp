Used the tips from a Cook from Webster Groves, MO below & it turned out perfectly (thanks!)Oh, also added a pressed garlic clove with the snow peas. Will definitely make again.

Made a variation on the Webster Grove Snow Peas recipe - added garlic, red pepper flakes, an additional scallion and didnt bother blanching the snow peas, just sauteed them in the oil until they were tender. They were quite tasty and easy to make.

Very good after used suggestions of cook from Webster Grove.

Perhaps my sesame oil was less than fresh, this tasted burned and we didn't like it. Shredding the snow peas destroyed their great texture. I will say that blanching and chilling them preserved their bright green color and they looked great.

Cutting the snow peas thinly makes them quite different. I followed the suggestions of the cook from Webster Groves and have found the pre-prep on the peas to be especially helpful. Thanks! We'll be having them again tonight with a steak marinated in a sesame ginger marinade.

I followed one of the below suggestions (more garlic, 2 scallions, etc.) and this was the perfect complement to the Spicy Hoisin Chicken. It's on my summer veggies list!

Thanks to the cook from Webster Groves, whose advice I followed to a T, this was very tasty and went well with the pan-seared tuna with ginger-shitake cream sauce and wasabi mashed potatoes. All in all, this was a great Asian meal

I changed a few things in this recipe and had great results. I blanched the peas for 30 seconds before submerging them in an ice bath, then patted them dry with paper towels and stored them in the refrigerator in a ziploc bag until time to serve. At this time, I heated a couple of tablespoons of sesame oil (which has a high smoking point) with a little vegetable oil over moderately low heat; added 3 minced garlic cloves and sauteed until fragrant. Next, I added 2 scallions - sliced thinly on the diagonal as the recipe called for - stirring until soft , then I threw in the snow peas(I used 1 lb. for 6 people); kosher salt; cracked pepper; and a dash of red pepper flakes to taste. Toss until the snow peas are warmed through and serve.

I followed the tips from other cooks and added 2 large minced garlic cloves. Still found the dish needed more flavor. Will add more sesame oil and other spices next time. Took one shortcut with the peas, after cooking, put them in a colander and ran cold water over them, rather than using the ice bath technique. The peas were very crispy.

This was perfectly fine, but not very exciting. Doubtful that I'd make it again.

For something so simple, this presented itself quite well. I, too, added garlic and lots of salt and freshly cracked pepper. Wonderful!

quick and easy. Turned out to be very tastey. I did add some finely mince garlic to sesame oil along with the scallion
