I've been making these for the past 3 years with pecans instead of pine nuts, and people absolutely love them. This year I will try hazelnuts since they were on sale at the grocery store! A perennial favorite.

My family's been making tassies for years, usually with pecans and a cream-cheese based crust. I decided to try these this year after looking at them in the magazine for a couple of years. They are a nice change, the flavors are more subdued, but they are still delicious. I just had to be careful with the cooking time. I had no problems with them sticking to my pans.

So good you cannot stop eating them!

I agree, don't overfill these or it's a mess. Twisting these like little knobs to get them out of the pan seems to be the best removal method; otherwise, you could end up with broken cookies. BTW, if you are short on time, you can substitute Pilsbury refrigerated sugar cookie dough for the butter cookie dough crusts, and the cookies will still be tasty.

These are attractive and easy to make. One word of advice: Make sure not to overfill them. The sticky filling can make it hard to get them out of the pan. i also made them with almond paste and almonds which I preferred.

When I first saw this recipe, I was incredibly eager to make these cookies. Then I read these unenthusiastic reviews and reconsidered. But I went with my gut, and I'm so glad - these are incredibly rich and delicious. Be sure to use non-stick pans, it makes all the difference.

I made these for a holiday party and everyone loved them. They were very rich in taste and I didn't find them at all bland. You can also make them in normal sized muffin pans as well. (They do cook a bit faster though than the recipe states.)

I made the Pine Nut Tassies and agree with the concensus of opinion. They are bland. I did make the recipe again using pecans and Mexican Vanilla and the flavor was wonderful.

I agree that these were bland and seemingly missing something. I also cooked mine the minimum time and they were overdone.

Found these cookies to be attractive and easy to make. Made them for a party and they disappeared quickly. I personally found them a bit bland, although others told me they liked the buttery crust and not too sweet filling. The cookies reminded me of a pecan pie with pine nuts instead of pecans.
