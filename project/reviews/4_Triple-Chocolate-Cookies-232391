I made them a bit smaller (about half as large) and baked them for 10 minutes. They came out beautifully. I will definitely make these again.

Phenomenal! I made these for a group and got rave reviews.I made it just as the recipe calls for although I didn't have time to freeze them. But you can forget freezing them. Just bake, cool and enjoy! Delicious! Will be using this recipe as my go to for cookie requests.

Good quality chocolate is key to this cookie recipe. As per other reviewer's suggestions, I used the 1 tbsp measuring spoon to make cookies to "grab and go". The ones made from the 1/4 cup is the right size for an ice cream cookie. 12 minutes in a 350F oven was the perfect time for me too, but take care to watch the bottom layer of cookies especially on a gas oven. It needs to be removed in the 10 minute mark. I also dotted the tops of the cookies with extra chocolate chips to make them more presentable. I'd love to try it next time with some pecans for that added texture and maybe a teaspoon of coffee to make the chocolate really shine.

For those who asked why the recipe calls for freezing, this recipe was initially created for making ice cream sandwiches.

These cookies are insanely good!!! I baked for 12 minutes which was sufficient.

Yummmm! Absolutely delicious! I agree with many others here that 1/4 cup is way too big. just a question - why do they need to be frozen after baking?

i made a half recipe and used tablespoon-sized batter. cooked them for about 16 minutes which was too much (although they're still good). i should have listened and cooked them for just 12 minutes like others had said!

Excellent. Replaced vanilla with two tbs of bourbon but I think all that rich chocolate flavor hid the taste. I wanted just a little kick, as these were for a poker party.

Rating: 4
Very nice cookies, and the dough for mine was not too soft and the cookies turned out cookie-like (as opposed to brownie-like). I think the secret is to make sure you beat the egg/butter/sugar mixture long enough so that it becomes pale and moussey. I'll definitely make them again.

My new go-to cookie recipe. Used them with super-premium vanilla ice cream for ice cream sandwiches. Agree with others that dropping by the tablespoon is the way to go. They are so rich that 1/4-cup seems like overkill. The freezer aspect makes these so easy to make ahead. A huge hit!

I made these with a hint of cinnamon and bourbon soaked cherries, and they were killer. The chocolate is really intense and I thought the cherries broke up the flavor nicely. I bet these would be great with mint chips or, as others have suggested, as ice cream sandwiches.

Very, why do we have to freeze this.

These are absolutely amazing! I agree with the previous reviewers, 1/4 cup is ridiculous and 12 minutes is the perfect baking time. I used a little bit less than a tablespoon per cookie and they came out the perfect size (I got around 53 cookies total). They're chocolately and gooey and ridiculously decadent. Make them, you won't be sorry!

The best chocolate cookie ever! I used a 1 tablespoon scoop and made about 3 dozen cookies. Today I'm adding butterscotch chips and making Black and Gold Cookies for the Saints game.

Very good recipe. I grated some orange peel and mixed into the butter and sugar. The batter is really soft and it might be better to roll it into logs in plastic wrap, chill and then cut before baking. All around a great recipe.

Made these cookies today as dessert for a grilled pizza party. Filled them with low fat chocolate chip mint ice cream. They are sensational! I have made ice cream sandwiches before, with homemade cookies, and the cookies always seemed too hard when they were frozen. But these had just the perfect texture right out of the freezer. I used really good single origin chocolate from El Rey, and the flavor was amazing. These would make awesome cookies just by themselves, but they really are perfect for use in sandwiches. I did the recipe exactly as written. I didn't find the batter to be too thin. I used a smaller amount than 1/4 cup, and portioned them out with a smallish ice cream scoop. Baked up in 12 minutes in a convection oven set to 335. I will definitely make these again, perfect after a bbq. One of our guests loved them so they said "you could sell these!"

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe made as is. Batter is very goopy so put the bowl in the freezer for awhile before trying to scoop out the cookies. A MUST DO, in my opinion. Secondly, I used a one Tablespoon measure and the cookies came out exactly the right size. A 1/4 cup is insane for such a rich cookie unless you are a teenage girl without a date on prom night. My husband rated them 7.5 out of 5, so I guess they are a big hit with the choco-freaks.

Absolutely awesome cookies, strange way to get there. I followed the instructions exactly except that i made the cookies much smaller (they're intense). Everyone loved them.

made for christmas gifts, just great. used mini chips, added walnuts and used melon baller for smaller cookies. they are just like brownies. everyone loved them, will add them to regular cookie baking list for holidays.

I found these cookies to be absolutely delicious. They are very decadent with a strong chocolate presence. As other reviewers have mentioned, the cookie produced is a combination of a brownie and a cookie. I didn't think I would like that type of mixture, but it works. I added some extra chocolate chips and holiday M and M's to make them more festive. These are perfect to quench your chocolate cravings!! I will definitely make these again....probably this week!

Oh, and I baked them for 12 minutes like other reviewers suggested. Perfect.

These are very, very good. And rich. I added some additional chocolate chips and made the first batch without chilling the batter. The cookies, while hard to spoon onto the cookie sheet, turned out fine. However, for the next batch I chilled the batter for about 20 minutes. This resulted in much easier scooping and a nicer looking finished product.

This is not not not a "cookie"! It's a brownie shaped like a cookie. If you want an excellent chocolate COOKIE recipe, bake Dorie Greenspan's World Peace Cookies. The recipe is all over the internet.

I made these a second time along with our favorite similar recipe for a taste comparison. This recipe is even better than our favorite Caffe Museo's killer chocolate bar. It has more of a chew that is almost sinful. These are out of this world delicious and will now become part of our cookie repetoire. Thanks so much Epicurious!

I was making these at altitude (9000ft) so I added a half cup of ground oats and reduced the baking powder by half. I had nothing but turbinado sugar on hand and real sea salt, so they ended up with a bit of crunch in the bite, but delicious.

These are similar to San Francisco's Museum Caffe Museo cookies. This recipe seems easier though and has alot less eggs. I thought they were wonderful and am so excited to add a 4th cookie to my repetoire.

I agree that these cookies are wonderful. The "dough" resembled brownie batter, so I could understand why previous reviewers had trouble shaping the cookies. I chilled the "dough" overnight and it became much more maleable--it had the consistency of truffles--and I rolled it into small balls. I baked them at the 350 degrees called for and they spread out very nicely. I played with the cooking times--12 minutes seemed to work best. Enjoy!

I was skeptical when I read all the rave reviews. I thought, "jeez, how good can a cookie be?" I made them for an office party and I was definitely popular at the party because of this cookie. They are even better when you heat them for a minute. I also recommend using the best chocolate you can find.Definitely will make them again.

I took these to a party and heard several times "Who made these?" A big hit with everyone and everytime I make them. A simple go to chocolate cookie that never fails.

Great cookie. Holds up, holds together and supports the ice cream. I used the Dolche de Leche from this site. YUMMMM. However, a 1/4 cup of batter is WAY too much. I used a small disher which was probably 2 tablespoons (sorry, I don't remember the scoop number but it has a black handle). It was a little intensive as I also used a biscuit cutter as a template to spread the batter within for uniformity (it was a little messy at first but it got easier - spread and lift straight up). When I make again, as I most definately will, I'll probably make them even a little smaller as the cookie is very rich to say nothing of the Dolche de Leche ice cream.

"Got Milk"? Whew, one of my cookie-eaters actually commented "mm, good brownies". The texture and the level of richness is very brownie-like. Good, but not really to my liking when I am looking for a cookie, not a brownie. They have their place... probably fantastic as ice cream sandwich cookies.

Rating: 4
These cookies are awesome! I made them on a whim since I had the ingredients on hand. There is very little butter for what these cookies are (come on, triple chocolate cookies and only a little more than a half stick of butter!!). It turned out that we were having guests over two nights later, and since I froze them, I just unthawed them and the guests raved about them. One even suggested that I sell them when I'm out and about. Regardless, this recipe was one of the easiest and most straightforward to make. One note though, I used a large tablespoon when putting them on my baking sheet, and they only took around 10-12 minutes to bake. When I did it for 16 minutes, they were good, but slightly overdone. When they come out of the oven, they should be nicely cracked (not very cracked but just cracked across) and should have some give when you put your finger on them. Overall, very, very, good recipe that I'll be sure to make again. Oh, and definitely don't skimp out on good quality chocolate.

These are magnificent! I made them smaller as well and got about 36 good sized cookies from one batch. I can't even fathom how big they'd be making only 16. Yikes! Vanished in moments, and still soft and delish the next day. :)

These are incredibly delicious on their own but make excellent ice cream sandwiches - they soften up very quickly after coming out of the freezer making them very easy to eat. I made them about half the recommended size so came out with 36 cookies and thought they were the perfect size for ice cream sandwiches. They are very rich so a little goes a long way - even though they were smaller, my husband and I still shared one and felt completely happy and satisfied. We used Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream in some and Toasted Almond ice cream in others - but almost any flavor of ice cream would be delicious.

These are scrumtious cookies! I made them with Scharffenberger dark chocolate (66%) and Ghirardelli 60% chocolate chips - dropped them from rounded teaspoonfuls. The recipe made 3 1/2 dozen and they vanished super fast. Unbelievably good - like the reviewer said, a brownie-cookie!

These cookies were delicious, very chocolate-y! However, I have a question for everyone - I must be missing something because for the life of me I can't see why the cookies have to be frozen and why the very specific instructions (4 to a large bag, etc.) The cook from texas on 04/11/06 could see why freezing was necessary, but I am too stupid(?) and cannot. And why do they have to be kept frozen - will they be stale overnight?? thanks to who can answer.

These cookies are fabulous!!!! I've never made or tasted a cookie like this! It was delicate and cake-like.... YUM! I can't wait to make them again. (I used gourmet chocolate which I think made a difference)

These cookies are fantastic! I made them to go along with the ice cream sandwiches, and they were a HUGE hit. I made them regular size once, and then the second time made them about half as big (and reduced the cooking time) and made miniature ice cream sandwiches for a bigger party, and they went fast. Enjoy!

This is not a cookie for the faint of heart. The good thing about these is that if you need a chocolate fix it only takes about 2 bites to cure it. I've sent these off in school care packages and gotten rave reviews. As a chocoholic myself, I love them.

Rating: 4
These are the best cookies I've ever baked or eaten. I only used about 7 oz. of the semisweet choc. and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. I had to bake them about 20 minutes and they never did get a crackly surface. Next time I would not make them quite so big. (My yield was a dozen.)They are cakelike and I'd serve them to anyone.

Oh my. So rich, so yummy. So ... not a cookie! These are brownies! Okay, they're brownie cookies. Impossible to eat one without a big glass of milk. I used 6 oz bittersweet and 4 oz semi-sweet, because it's what I had on hand. Will try it all bittersweet next time, as they are really sweet. While in the oven, they didn't spread as much as I feared (2" space between the drops is more than adequate). And they did rise beautifully, even though I had to stir in the forgotten vanilla after folding in the chips.

Rating: 4
To tell the truth I yelled and fussed and complained while making these things! Before going into the oven I had more of a brownie batter than a cookie dough. I had intended on freezing and thought that I had really messed something up so I just baked the whole batch - I can now see why the note on freezing was necessary. Once they came out of the oven, fabulous! I used peanut butter and chocolate chips instead of chocolate alone... A-mazing!!

Rating: 4
If you're needing a fix of chocolate, and have milk near by this is the recipe for you! I too was a little nervous about the consistancy of the batter, but the results speak for itself. I only had 10oz of chocolate so I cut the recipe in half and put in 2 eggs--they turned out perfect.

This recipe makes a fabulous chocolate chocolate chip cookie. I have been searching for ages for the perfect recipe and this one hit the mark. The dough seemed thin to me for cookies, but they baked up perfectly. Also a note that freezing at the end is not necessary, I found that step a little confusing. Also I cooled them on a rack and not in the pan. After reading the recipe I was concerned about the cookie "durability" - not a problem at all.

Yum. I liked the dish but i wouldn't make it again because my little daughter has the ultimate sweet-tooth. When she saw the cookies, her mouth was watering and she had high expectations. But when she took one little bite, she started spitting it out. I knew then that they were utterly horrible. O_____o;;
