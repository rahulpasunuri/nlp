I used the suggestion of using individual Ramekins which worked well, it would have been difficult to get the eggs and tomatoes to match up exactly and not overbalance. I then removed the tomatoes from the ramekins for serving and kept the top third for presentation (with Green shoots, made a nice touch). I also had a problem with the cooking time, ideally you want the yolks runny but the whites take so long to cook that the yolks cook as well. The next time I'm going to try and bake the tomato shells first so that they are nice and hot and see if it makes a difference keeping the eggs at room temperature first (as with a traditional poached egg). I used sourdough toast soldiers and bit of tabasco and strong mature cheddar. The flavour was great (everyone knows what tomatoes and eggs taste like, you can spice it up if its too bland) and the meal was a success with my family.

I followed the cooking time exactly and my eggs weren't finished cooking. So I let them cook for another 3-4 minutes but my tomatoes fell apart. The eggs were runny and watery. Plus there was no seasoning besides S/P. Would not recommend recipe.

Delicious! Such a simple recipe and tastes great. I added some goat cheese and spinach to the recipe as well and loved it. Great for anyone who loves tomato dishes!

Eggs served with "soldiers" are meant to have a yolk you can dip into. Yumm!! The egg shouldn't be fully cooked in such a recipe. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I often forget the joys of tomatoes at breakfast.

I forgot to add that: - I used monterrey jack cheese instead of white cheddar. - the hot cheese helps increase the temperature for the egg to fully cook faster. - separately, I took the pulp that I took out of the tomatoes and put it on top of slices of french bread, together with some olive oil and basil, and made bruschetta.

I tried this recipe; The tomato egg cups were delicious. I added more time than says on this recipe because the egg wasn't cooked at all after the initial 10mins. Only after did I realize that the cheese helps cook the egg. :)

I too had trouble with my eggs not being fully cooked at the end of 10 minutes, but found that covering the baking dish with a bit of foil worked wonders. In the future, I'll cover the dish until it's time to add the cheese, then leave it uncovered as the cheese melts. I have no idea if this would impress guests or not but it made a lovely weekend breakfast for my husband and me.

i wasn´t expecting great results after reading all the reviews about this being bland, but i thought it was excelent! i forgot the cheese but i added a bit of fresh basil salt and pepper to the tomato before craking the egg and it really enhanced the tomato´s flavor, this and a slice of toast was a great breakfast!

I have made this twice - both times for my wife. We both loved it. I would advise against serving it to kids unless you know they LOVE tomatoes. I cooked the eggs before putting them into the tomatoes.

I do not know what all the negative comments were about with this. Eggs taste like eggs, tomatoes like tomatoes. Both are awesome. I scooped out the flesh, put salt inside, drained and then put in an egg. No problem. Due to the flavor comments, I did put a dash of hot sauce on the inside flesh before putting in the egg. Cooked it up just fine, cooled it, put some cheese on top, and nuked it for 1 min at work the next day. Quick, easy, healthy, one dish meal. Thank you for a great new staple dish!

This was very interesting. The skin on the tomato pulled away when you sliced into it and left a bit of a mess. The cooking times were way off and it was very bland, but I actually found it very enjoyable. I would add more to it next time to add some more flavor, but I would make it again. It looks gourmet and could impress your guests.

This was very good. The skin on the tomato, however, pulled away when you sliced into it and left a bit of a mess, but the rest was very enjoyable. I actually beat the egg first and mixed in some cheese. I don't think there would be much of a difference. This is a very easy recipe that can impress just as easily.

I wasn't crazy about this recipe at all. First the egg mixture wouldn't stay in the tomato no matter what I did and it took three times as long to cook than the recipe said. Definitely will not make again.

The other posters are correct that this dish does not have any overpowering distinct flavors - which is why I love the simplicity. I made it with fresh eggs and tomatos from my farmer's market and really enjoyed the dish. For variety, I might add some diced onion or bacon into the tomato next time before adding the egg. Also, I baked mine in mini ramekins, so that if the tomato falls apart you still have the disk in it's own individual cup. You can also play with the cheese if the current recipie is too bland for you; it would be great with a sharp cheddar or gruyerre.

This is nothing exceptional and somewhat bland. Furthermore, the eggs are not fully cooked if you follow the suggested times.

For some reason, I could not get the eggs to fully cook. I kept them in the oven for twice as long, but the egg whites were still completely clear. I eventually stuck these in the broiler to finish the eggs (at least to a soft consistency), but it became a hassle and I probably wouldn't make it again.

Disgustingly bland.

Funny, I wrote a blog post about this exact thing about a year ago! I made it a little healthier by putting part of a wedge of Laughing Cow cheese in it.

try seasoning the inside of the tomato with a good Greek seasoning blend, and adding some diced Kalamata olives before cracking in the eggs. Substitue feta for the white cheddar...yumm!

Try it with Feta cheese (the kind that comes in olive oil) instead of the cheddar. Much more interesting.

Quick and easy - could use more flavor so I doctored with basic dried Italian seasoning, a touch of cayene and fresh basil on top - used foccacia for toast and it was delicious. I used egg beaters and low fat cottage cheese in the tomato... awesome!

This is a great idea. Though it is not a tasty dish. One of my tomatoes fell apart. I do not plan to make it again.

I made this today, and it was good, hence my 2 fork rating. I can't say it was a feast for the senses, but its very easy and quick to make, so I(ll definitely make it again, as its good variation to my usual breakfasts. My girlfriend also enjoyed it.
