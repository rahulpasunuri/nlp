Great pared with grilled mild Italian sausage. I made a few adjustments: 1. Did not use prosciutto 2. Add 1t. salt and 1/4 t. white pepper halfway through cooking 3. Slice asparagus into thin discs, blanch for 2 min. 4. Top with lemon zest before serving SImple and light for spring. Very nice!

I think the prosciutto makes it quite salty so watch the additional salt. Uninspiring recipe otherwise. Good to eat but nothing exceptional.

In response to anastezia on 04/01/10: if rice does not cook in 20 to 30 minutes, it is likely the rice is stale. Try to buy a recent crop, store in airtight container and use within a few months. Carnaroli is my personal preference over arborio for creamiest risotto.

My new favorite base recipe for risotto. Texture ends up perfect every time!

This recipe is wonderful! The rice to liquid ratio is spot on so follow recipe exactly. I omitted prosciutto and substituted peas and artichoke hearts for asparaus because these were the vegetables I had on hand...Splendid!

This is the rare epicurious recipe that is perfect as is. My only alteration was actually by mistake: I used vegetable broth instead of chicken. It took about an hour of patient stirring (the 30 minute suggested in the recipe is laughable), but it turned out exactly as risotto should-- creamy but not mush. Yay spring!

We made this last night for company and it was hands down one of the best risotto's I've had. The flavors were delicious and it was relatively easy to make. I never bother heating up the stock to add to the pan and didn't do it this time either (like to minimize the number of pans I dirty) and it was still great. Excellent. Will definitely make it again.

I have been making this for years and it's one of my favorite all time recipes from this site. My friends beg me to make it! This is one that I follow the recipe...don't cook the prosciutto ahead or it will be too dry. The only thing I do, and it's just an option, is sometimes drizzle a little bit of truffle oil over the finished dish...yummy!

I followed the recipe almost exactly except that I used 3oz prosciutto since that's how much came in the package. Despite the higher prosciutto ratio, the asparagus still stole the show. Follow the directions exactly, and the asparagus cooks to perfection! Very crisp and flavorful. I used local, fresh asparagus from the farmers market which I think made a big difference. In my case, 30 minutes of cooking time was just about right.

Very good risotto. Made it without the prosciutto but probably would add it next time. Took longer than predicted in the recipe. Had to add extra water to get rice to appropriate tenderness.

This was just okay to me - I found it took longer to make than the 20 minutes indicated - but risotto is not something you just whip up.

This had a really great balance of flavors, particularly after I added a handful of rehydrated shiitake mushrooms. It added a savory note that I think really pulled things together. Just a touch of fresh ground black pepper on the plate and it was really exceptional.

This was a terrific recipe. I think the asparagus makes it so good. I did substitute bacon instead of prosciutto because i had some on-hand. I also took one other persons suggestions and saved the tips of the asparagus for presentation on the top of the dish before I served it. In all reality, risotto is such a simple dish to make, only thing is stirring it so often.

Yum, this came out delicious! I chose this as my first recipe for making risotto and it came out perfectly, although I did end up needing a little salt at the end. I highly recommend this recipe, and can't wait to try different ones.

Presentation tip: Reserve the asparagus tips to blanch just after you remove the remainder of the 1/2" pieces from the boiling water. Arrange them around the edges of the finished dish for an awesome presentation, or if serving individually, top each scoop of risotto with 2-3 tips. I felt the recommended amount of proscuitto achieved the right saltiniess, but fresh ground pepper at the last minute was a great addition. Buy end cuts of proscuitto for cost savings when a recipe calls for chopped or diced.

i served this recipe for a buffet luncheon and it was a hit! if i cook the dish again for myself, i will reduce the amount of butter - it was very rich! the suggestion of cooking the asparagus in the chicken stock is right on.

Rating: 4
This was delicious! I made it as written except that I threw in a clove of minced garlic with the leeks. Be sure that you don't overcook the asparagus- it was right on about cooking it to crisp-tender and then putting it in ice water. The asparagus tasted very fresh, and the prosciutto was a great complement to it. This was a perfect spring dish.

This was wonderful. We dropped the asparagus in a pot of boiling chicken broth instead of water, pulled it out with a slotted spoon, then used that same broth for the risotto. The asparagus gets a little extra chicken broth flavor, plus the broth gets a little asparagus flavor. We added some minced garlic to the leeks after they softend, just for 30 seconds before adding the wine. We didn't have the prosciutto on hand, so we added some diced greek olives, a nice salty alternative to the prosciutto. It was indeed creamy and good comfort food. We tend to add a pad of butter and a little extra broth at the end, take off the heat, stir and cover for five minutes, beautiful! Will make again definitely.

I made this recipie substituting the asparagus with zucchine because it was not available at the market, and it came out great. I added them to the pan with the leeks just after the leeks softned. My Italian husband loved this dish.

I love this dish--I love risotto and its hearty enough for a main meal. I recently made it using the suggestion of previous reviewers to put the prosciutto in when sauteing the leeks but found that made the prosciutto tough and cooked out much of its flavor. Leave the recipe as is and its a hit.

This didn't cook up creamy even though I upped the time to almost an hour! The rice still was solid in the middle and it lacked a bit of flavor. I would use a flavorful broth and add some thyme at the end of the cooking with the parmesan. The next day I used the leftovers to make risotto patties just flattened, dipped in bread crumbs and sauteed in butter. That was nice!

Fabulous! My children's favorite. Sometimes we add frozen peas instead of asparagus.

First rate! Followed the recipe almost exactly except I cut it down by about a third (only 2 to cook for). Risotto is very forgiving and measurments do not have to be exact just make sure the cheese is added at the very last minute.

Delicious! I steeped porcini mushrooms in broth, then used that broth for the risotto. I also added the mushrooms, prosciutto, garlic, and leeks to the skillet at the beginning -- the prosciutto was crispier and delicious. Served with grilled center cut pork loin chops, marinated in balsamic vinegar, olive oil, fresh rosemary and thyme, salt and pepper.

Fantastic! Instead of the prosciutto, I pan fried some pancetta and crumbled it on the top. My husband is allergic to gluten so this was one of his favorite dishes. Superb!

Delicious. I have made it several times. I use low sodium chicken broth & I agree with the review that says to saute the proscuitto with the leeks (shallots work well also). Makes it crisp. I have added mushrooms to the recipe.

This recipe is right on when it comes to risotto-the ony changes that I made is to add twice as much proscuitto and use the imported-you can definitely notice a taste difference and the cost difference is low since you only need a small amount-enjoy!!!

Great recipe. Takes a bit of time to add the broth and simmer it down, but the risotto turns out perfect. Watch the salt content of the broth (get low sodium) AND the salt content of the prosciutto or you'll notice the salt. Otherwise, I love this recipe.

This dish was fantastic -- I substituted the leeks with shallots, and the parsley with rosemary...which lended fantastic flavor. Also, I topped with a few shavings of pecorino romano cheese. I could have used a bit more broth than the recipe suggested, & will use an extra cup of broth next time. A winner, will certainly make it again.

I had people scraping the bottom of the bowl with this. The key is to follow directions, and not to add the asparagus/parsley/prosciutto until you're ready to serve it -- otherwise the asparagus gets soggy and the prosciutto gets tough.

I served this dish with bacon wrapped filet's with Merlot sauce and it was a hit. However, next time I will try either cutting the proscuitto into tinier bits or using bacon or ham. I found the proscuitto was a little chewy after it was heated through. With the leftovers I made fried risotto cakes which were quite good. Definately try it!

Very good, but simple in flavour. As a main course for four people, the recipe would likely leave some people hungry. If this dish is the only one being served for four people, then I would add two cups of risotto.
