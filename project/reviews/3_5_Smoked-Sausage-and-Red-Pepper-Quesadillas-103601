We really enjoyed this as a family kind of meal. I made it exactly as written, except that I just mixed all the cheese, peppers, etc. together as a filling rather than layers--seemed too labor-intensive for something that was all going to melt together anyhow. The salsa verde mixture was good--but I wonder if it can be improved upon? I may try a fresh salsa next time or some other variation.

I used a Hillshire Farms chipotle sausage which was perfect for the dish. I didn't have a gas burner and had trouble getting flour tortillas to crisp enough in the oven and not get to soggy. I didn't have feta cheese, but I'll try it next time for a twist. Try getting a homemade salsa from a restaurant for the topping for a fresher flavor.

This is a very easy and tasty weekday dinner. I roasted my own red peppers and used hot links. Love the avacado and salsa verde topping.

MAKE SURE you use a good quality andouille, and if you have the time - Roast your own peppers. I used flour tortillas in place of the corn (since I don't have gas burners), and cooked 2 batches: 1 in an un-oiled teflon pan, and the others in the stove. DON'T BOTHER with the stove, since the tortillas curl up at the edges. These were VERY yummy and I will make them again, especially since I had recipe requests!

I made a derivative of this dish for a dinner party last week. I used cooked, crumbled chorizo and sliced raw tomatillos, with monteray jack and sharp cheddar cheeses. Sprayed flour tortillas with pam, and baked at 400 degrees for 10-12 minutes. Came out great! Serve with a little home made guac and iced beer to cool things off.
