I normally do not "do" dessert; but, this one seemed like a soft closure to a robust meal and, as it could be prepared in advance it caught my eye as I searched my Best of Gourmet cookbook library to break with history and make a dessert. I served it to my partners family (a captive audience for my endeavours) and they loved it so much that it is now my job to make this as my contribution to her family Christmas réveillon. Definitely a "keeper" and a pleaser.

I made these to accompany the Hazelnut Paris-Brest, and they were a wonderful match. They were VERY labor intensive, and the sauce never thickened at all, but there were none of the other problems discussed here. All in all, I will make them again when I make that fantastic Paris-Brest again (too perfect), but as a stand-alone dessert, no.

Friend of mine that does not like desserts asked for seconds and then took one home for his lunch the next day.They are some work but worth the effort.I bought the firmest oranges I could find and they all held together fine during the cooking process.

I had high hopes for this recipe but found it WAY too sweet to be "refreshing" ... cloying, yes; refreshing, no. I followed the recipe to the letter, even popping for a bottle of Grand Marnier and now I'm wishing I hadn't wasted it on this dog. Half my oranges were falling apart after poaching. A much easier, quicker and better recipe is just slice the oranges, arrange on a plate or platter, splash with a little wine, sherry or Grand Marnier, and dust very lightly with a little cinnamon. Now that's refreshing!

This was quite good. Glad I read the reviews ahead of time since so few ingredients had made me think no fuss. I had navel oranges that had thick skins and I didn't worry about making long, wide strips because the paring knife removing the white pith wasn't going to happen and wasn't necessary. If white on it, threw that one out. Rest of it was painless and a very refreshing dessert.

Good but definately NOT work the hours of preparation time. The sauce was indeed the best part. The oranges were bitter in the middle and a couple of them turned mushy as other cooks stated. That said, my guests loved them. Served them for Christmas dessert with a scoop of lemon sorbet. My mother asked for a spoon to scoop up the rest of her sauce.

I also followed the recipe to the letter... Even getting the orange zest down to pure orange not a trace of zest in site. I found the sauce to be bitter, oranges bitter, pith abounding.... like the other reviewers, I found the candied orange/ginger sauce the best thing of the recipe. I used this as a sauce for my Grand Marnier cheesecakes... Not a great recipe to try if you're in a hurry.... took a lot longer that it stated... Not my favorite recipe.

This was labor intensive, and unfortuantely my end product was a bitter sauce. I don't know what I did wrong, but even standing overnight the sauce still taste bitter. Some of the oranges (3) became mush also. I also agree with one of the readers, the last sugar syrup sauce that the zest cooks in is a waste to throw away, which I did but wish I didn't. That sauce didn't taste bitter and it got thick. At the end,my sauce never got thick like it should had. To me this recipe is a disappointment. I would not recommend this one at all.

Well, it certainly took a lot longer than 45 minutes active time, and I was certainly naive in thinking that the overall 3 hours included the chilling time. Having said that, it was fun to make and delicious (although I will cut the sugar considerably the next time.) Which will be on Christmas Day. BUT, this baby will be made the day before! (It was just as delicious the day after, even though I didn't cover in the refrigerator with an inverted bowl.

We laughed till we wept that after hours of peeling, boiling down, scraping off pith, boiling down again,and again, and again, when, alas, we ended up with .. .well,.... an orange. And then we laughed some more until we almost lost our meal. Thank God we made a Buche de Noel to go with it. The sauce was delicious on that!

Besides being so labor-intensive, the finished product leaves a great deal to be desired. The inner pith of the oranges are a chewy, gooey mess and stick in the spaces between the teeth. Definitely not my cup of tea!

Really I'd give this two-and-a-half forks, but it WAS good--my guests loved it. But it is labor-intensive, and I'm not sure it's entirely worth the effort. It IS true that I snarfed down the leftovers the next day, so I wouldn't dissuade anyone from making it; I'm just not sure I will repeat it. One last thing: the recipe instructs you make and then discard a fair amount of orange-and-ginger-infused syrup--which feels wasteful to me. I'm going to try to use the syrup in some kind of cocktail!

wow! alright, it takes some real work to do this right... no skimping on scraping off that pith or peeling the ginger. i followed the recipe to last dotted "i" and it was just wonderful. We had brought back some big naval oranges from FL, and I'd use smaller ones next time, but these were wonderful anyway. Nobody left any on the plate! I served a tiny scoop of lemon sorbet with a little bit of the sugared zest on top, then brought out the oranges. What a perfect ending to a winter meal.
