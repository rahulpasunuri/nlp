I made this for my husband's birthday picnic using whole wheat flour and finely chopped verbena. Despite a moody oven, the cake was firm, moist and not too sweet. Instead of the glaze I macerated the strawberries in lemon and sugar ahead of time and poured a bit of the juice over each slice with strawberries on top, and of course - whipped cream! Everyone loved it -- YUMMY!

This recipe turned out fantastic! I doubled the recipe and made four loaves in smaller pans. What a great way to use lemon verbena from my garden. I can't wait to make this again!

This was delicious! Made it to the recipe but doubled it and baked it in a tube pan. Turned it into a strawberry zinfandel trifle and it was a hit. The cake wasn't too dense but it held up in the trifle without falling apart. The lemon verbena makes this recipe in my opinion because it's much more subtle than plain lemon zest and adds an interesting herbal note.

After trying some of the other Epicurious pound cakes, I return to this one exclusively. I have 3 lemon verbena plants, so I make many things with that herb. For the cooks who have not tried this recipe with lemon verbena, it is heavenly - do give it a try.

I threw this together as an addition to my dessert contribution (lemon ice box cake) for a book club due to one of the members being lactose intolerant, and wow! It's fabulous. I substituted coconut milk beverage for the regular milk and didn't have lemon verbena, but otherwise followed the recipe. The amount of batter was just enough to fill 12 silicon baking cups, and the baking time I used (22 minutes at 325) was perfect. The cakes were moist, delicious with a perfect texture. Will definitely make again!

Perfect! My dad requested a lemon pound cake for his birthday so based on high reviews, I tested this one. Moist, nice lemon flavor without being overpowering. I doubled the recipe and used a bunt pan. Cooking time was 55 min. It took me a little more confectioner's sugar to get the right thickness for the glaze but other than that, recipe was followed exactly.

Delicious! I baked it at 325' in a dark, non-stick 11" tart pan with removable bottom. It was done in about 30 minutes. I glazed it while still warm, as suggested. It turned out to be only ~3/4" high, but perfect for a fresh fruit topping and whipped cream.

This recipe provides enough batter to fill a 12" tart pan which I bake for 45 minutes at 325 degrees. After removing the tart from the pan I combine powered sugar and lemon juice and glaze the whole tart while warm. This is an attempt to keep the tart from becoming soggy when adding the fresh fruit to the center. Tonight it will be filled with strawberries which I leave whole and served with a side of whipped cream. Haven't looked for fresh lemon verbena but do use two generous tablespoons of zested lemon. This really makes for a special looking dessert and the best part: it's simple and quick!

I made this recipe all last summer using lemon balm instead of lemon verbena (oops). It was fabulous none- the-less. Family, friends, adults, and children all rave and praise. This spring I planted a small lemon verbena in my garden. Soon I'll harvest enough to try with the correct herb.

While making a trifle, I realized that I had left the pound cake at the store, so I needed a quick but tasty recipe. This was it. I had no lemon verbena on hand (don't even know what that is), so I used the extra zest, 3/4 sugar, and a few drops of lemon extract to the batter. It was dense enough to stand up to the custard, and fruit syrup without becoming a soggy mess. Will definitely make again.

Used 4 tbsp minced lemon rind (zest) couldn't find the zester. Used only 3/4 of sugar as some readers suggested. Good. Didn't use the sugar glaze. I will *definitely* make this again.I'll try it verbatim too.

I didn't have anything but a 9x5 loaf pan, so used that. Baking time 40-45 minutes, and didn't rise that much, but boy - luscious. A bit on the sweet side. Served with whipping cream and berries.

Absolutely wonderful cake. Everyone LOVED it. I cut the sugar to 3/4C used 3 extra large eggs and didn't have access to lemon verbena so I used two lemon verbena tea bags. I used vanilla soymilk instead of milk. I also grated a lime to use that along with the lemon zest.

What did I do wrong? Help please! Followed the directions exactly (I swear I did not miss up the ingredients), but thought it was kind of liquidy when I put it in the oven. After 60 minutes, took it out, looked golden on top. End product never rose , and the inside was very dense and eggy. Is there some special trick to the creaming process? Is it supposed to increase in volume anywhere? Thanks for your help!

I made this cake with lemon and lime zest. I tasted the cake while still warm from the oven. The cake was absolutely delicious, light and lemony. I did not put the glaze on the cake, as the glaze tasted slightly perfumey (not sure why) to me. Next time I intend to make a syrup to saturate the cake with lemon syrup and top it with candied julienne slices of lemon. In my opinion, definitely a keeper.

Great pound cake! Very lemony. I doubled the recipe to use in a 2-quart bundt pan, and it turned out fine. I did not have access to lemon verbena, so I used zest of one small lemon and the juice. Also, at high altitude (8200 ft), I added one more egg and about 2 Tbsp more flour. Served with sliced frozen (thawed) strawberries and choice of vanilla ice cream or strawberry sorbet. A friend is allergic to milk, so I substituted soy milk for the milk in this recipe.

this is a lovely, light summer cake. i had neither verbena nor lemons, and substituted lime juice and lime zest instead...delicious!-- the color was even beautiful. perfect with the berries, as indicated, and light dessert wine.

Great cake! Used for Mother's Day Brunch. It was delicious on its own. I didn't even use the strawberries or glaze. Only had 1 Tablespoon of verbena on my plant and substituted less than 1 Tablespoon of lemon zest for the remaining. It was perfect. I don't drink milk and substituted original Rice Dream instead. No problems. Didn't have kugelhopf pan, used loaf pan instead. I will try all verbena next time when my plant recovers. Rosemary would be dandy too. Makes great gifts!

This was a lovely, fresh recipe. I didn't have lemon verbena so I simply used the lemon zest as indicated. For those who want to reduce the calories, low-fat butter and milk work just as well, and I reduced the sugar to 3/4 c since I don't like cakes that are too sweet. For a decadent twist, you could omit the glaze and simply whip up a little cream with a TB of sugar, smooth over the cooled cake and then cover it with sliced strawberries. Fantastic!

I'm particularly partial to lemony things & grow verbena outside so this is just the cake for me! I have made it a couple of times now and it's become a standard. I recommend, for variety, substituting rosemary for the verbena and increasing the lemon zest and juice....delicious. Also, i either skip the glaze or make it out of reduced honey and lemon juice simmered with cardomon pods. mmmmm!

I believe this pound cake is beyond reproach. I think I used verbena the first time I made it, but since then I have just added some extra zest, and it's excellent. The topping really makes it especially good. Also it's just sooo easy and yet it always seems special. I have fond feelings for this cake because it's one of the first desserts I remember learning to make successfully after I got married. I was so proud of it!

This recipe is wonderful and one of our favorites. I like its flexibility. I use mini-loaf pans sometimes - they are the perfect size for my little girls' "tea parties" and for small gifts. The cake freezes well and I bake extras, during the summer when lemon verbena is abundant in the garden, for "rainy" days and the unexpected visitor. Loaf pans (reg or mini) are better for space-saving freezing than the kugel shape. We discovered it also tastes good sliced and lightly toasted - either plain or with strawberry preserves. Toasting is easier when it's a day old, or was frozen. I usually skip the glaze.

This was delicious! Didn't have lemon verbena, so I tossed in more lemon juice and zest. I don't believe you can ever have too much lemon in any recipe. Topped it off with Strawberry Vin Santo (also on Epicurious). Yum, yum, yum!

I made this with only lemon zest and it didn't have the zip I would've liked. Also, since I didn't have enough fresh strawberries, I added some thawed frozen blueberries and it worked out fine.

Something went terribly wrong when I made this. It was dense and not cakey at all. More like a brick. Must have been my technique, but I followed the recipe (didn't have the verbana) and used a loaf pan. I'm disappointed after all the great reviews, but will not attempt again. So many recipes, so little time!

The flavor of this cake is divine although the texture was quite dense. Not knowing what a kugle...? pan was, I used a standard loaf pan and got a short, but adequate pound cake loaf. Sliced and served with strawberry and ice cream, it was quite unique.

Fun to make, festive to serve. I bought lemon verbena from a nursery, used some of it for the cake and planted the rest. Now it's taking over my garden. Served 8 generously. Will definitely make again because I paid $25 for the pan!

Delicious however given the size of the Kugelhopf pan required, I was a bit surprised at how Lilliputian the actual cake came out. Would not recommend for more than 4 - 6 people MAX. Delicious though used only the zest and no verbena.

Dear Kentucky, What no Kugelhopf pan??? Well then, I suggest buying appropriately sized clay pots from your local florist and using that. (Size does matter). The clay imparts a gustatory tuscan headiness that counters the ascerbicness of the lemon. I treasure this recipe, as my dear departed Nana (who loved this recipe) was able to chew on it, sans dentition.

This recipe sounds lovely but I have not yet tried because when my house was burglerized,the only item the thief absconded with was my prize winning "kugelhopf" pan. Whatever can I use as an alternative?

I substituted concentrated lemon juice for the lemon verbena, doubled this recipe, and baked it in a bundt type cake pan. This recipe has consistently yielded high results....it really resembles those cakes served at high tea at the Empress in Victoria, BC, Canada. This cake is my "...I've had a bad day and I desperately need to rejuvenate myself" therapy. Too much of it is calorically risque however, and hence one is fore-warned.

Don't know if the baker in February ever got an answer to her wedding cake question, but...I make wedding cakes, and one of the best pound cake recipes I've found is the one for Old Fashioned Pound Cake in the Kitchenaid owner's manual. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

We loved this cake! It is easy to prepare... no lemon verbena available, but the extra lemon zest worked fine. -A nice, light dessert to follow a heavy meal. I followed previous reviewer's advice and did not add the lemon sauce, but I think I would try it next time. Great served still warm!

The cake was excellent. No need for the glaze or the strawberries. We did try with both and didn't care for the glaze. I'll probably try some other glaze or frosting next time.

Thought this was a great cake! I agree with the person that said they liked it better with a lemon syrup. I have lemon verbena in my yard and love the fragrance. It's a wonderful herb; unfortunately there doesn't seem to be too many recipes using it. I would love to find more recipes, perhaps jams or jellies, using this wonderful herb.

Excellent! I was a little hesitant to use lemon verbena in a cake, but it turned out wonderfully. I sprinkled the cake with powdered sugar rather than using the glaze. Everyone who tried it really raved about it. Will definitely make it again.

I have made this three times because I have lemon verbana in my herb garden. I increased the verbana a bit, used lemon-sugar for sugar and have made with both the suggested glaze and a lemon syrup. Prefer the lemon syrup. The texture is perfect and it is delicious. I also like the size--great for gift giving. I have served it with fruit and custard sauce.
