Four forks for ease and speed. I added ingredients which is why I gave it a three. (added sauteed onions and chopped carrots). Definitely recommend adding to that weeknight repetoire. For a bit more time check out the Pork and Hominy Stew from BA Feb 2002 also on this site. I make it for company and always get rave reviews.

I added onions, bell peppers, and garlic for extra flavor. This was my first time cooking with hominy. Instead of rice I made cornbread and it was good.

Easy and quick. My boyfriend didn't love it, but I thought it was pretty good...and we did finish all the left-overs.

This was great! I added minced onion and garlic to the chicken and it was great! Brown rice on the side made rounded out the easy one coarse meal.

Very easy and very tasty! I added garlic and jalapeno to the oil, and a bit of cumin with the chili powder. Served with pasta. Yum!

This was really delicious and really quick! I used a little less chili powder and added some minced garlic, and that seemed to work really well. My husband loved it!

Very quick and easy and delicious. I spiced it up with a bit of cumin and about 1 tbsp. of fresh oregano. The effect is somewhere between Mexican and Moroccan (so said my wife).

This is very good and very easy to prepare. I thickened the mixture with a little corn starch. This would be really good over some rice or egg noodles to better utilize the sauce.

I really enjoy the taste of Hominy. I left out the cilantro and added cumin seed, and served over rice. It was very tasty and easy.
