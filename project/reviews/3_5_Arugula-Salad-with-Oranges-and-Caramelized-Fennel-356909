We had some textural problems with the roasted fennel - some of the pieces were browned and crunchy and good, but most of them were kind of slimy and squishy, like onions. The flavor was good, though. The oranges and arugula with the vinaigrette were great. I used 2 navel and 2 blood to mix things up a bit and it looked great. Served some goat cheese along side as the family balks at a dairy-free meal, and toasted some baguette to clean up the plate.

This was ok. I made the salad as written with no additions or changes. The fennel was roasted not caramelized. I would make this one again adding sugar to the fennel before roasting and maybe using balsamic instead of sherry vinegar.

Yum!! If you aren't a fan of fennel, you should definitely try it roasted because it mellows out the anise flavor a lot and is absolutely delicious. I didn't have sherry wine vinegar so I just used sherry wine + champagne vinegar and it turned out fine. Squeezed fresh navel orange juice, and I think it made all the difference!

I'm a novice in the kitchen and have never cooked with fennel, but it turned out! I served this salad with the spicy fennel spagetti and the deep dish winter pie for dessert (both also from epicurious). The fenel is packed with flavor and not bitter after roaster. delicious.

I am not sure why this is called caramelized (there is no sugar). Isn't it just roasted?

I made this salad last evening for our monthly Bon Appetit dinner with friends. The salad was exceptional. It was easy to prepare and delicious. I would definitely make it again. I used one red blood orange for the color contrast along with the navel oranges. We all love bleu cheese so I added a sprinkle of cheese and toasted walnuts.

I love using raw fennel in salads, but the carmelized fennel was delicious -- I thought the flavor went perfectly with the arugula. I used blood oranges for extra color, and the salad was beautiful and delicious!

The roasted fennel (and it was roasted, not was I consider carmelized) was a bust. Completely not worth the added effort as the flavors and texture of crisp, raw fennel would have been much more appealing in this salad. The dressing was nice, but I would definitely use raw fennel and go for a traditional orange fennel salad over this recipe.
