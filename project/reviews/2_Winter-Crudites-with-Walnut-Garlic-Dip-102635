Not good at all. Definitely not worth the effort. I ended up just putting some Ranch dressing out for the guests. I should have checked the ratings first. I usually do but this time I just made it from the magazine.

I mean, like my roommate said, "it's a dip." It's alright. Probably not something I'd make again. There are better things to dip your vegetables in.

I tried this recipie witout reading the reviews first and i have to say,it was really good, i switched up the regular olive oil for a specialty olive oil, and it turned out perfect

One of the worst recipies I've ever made from Bon Appetit. The texture was horrible, the color awful and the taste bland. I served it at a party and no one touched it after the first taste.

I made this dip before a party and had to salvage it because I had no backup. I took half of it and added sour cream and grated cheese and that made it ok to serve. Otherwise it was so bland and I agree that it doesn't look appealing either.

I wasn't happy with the end result of this "dip" (actually more of a spread). It was an unappealing brownish-grayish color, although the flavor was decent. Is someone else were to attempt this recipe, I would suggest using whole, blanched almonds in stead of the walnuts, since it was the walnut skins that caused the wierd color. I served it at a party and most of it was left over at the end.

Great dip -- I'm glad I tried it despite the negative reviews. It's also very good served with crackers or bread & is always a huge hit with my friends.

Sometimes I wish I would LISTEN! I always double the garlic and I wasn't going to on this recipe after reading the reviews and then I forgot. So don't make that mistake. This is an interesting way to get a creamy dip without yogurt, mayo, or sour cream. I wouldn't serve it to company but my husband wolfed it down. It tasted especially good with red and yellow bell peppers. Walnuts and olive oil are touted as a preventitive for almost every ailment so I felt good eating dip for a change.

Almost skipped this after reading the unfavorable reviews.Glad I tried it though.A good way to sneak in a vegetable course too. Overprocessing will ruin it.And only the freshest,high-quality ingredients will make it worthwhile.

Boring and more trouble than it's worth. It was the only appetizer I made over the holidays that didn't get devoured.

Gross!

This recipe is way too garlicky. Could be better if you use half the garlic. Even with less garlic, I think that the recipe would be just so-so.

Very popular as an appetizer, great for lactose or dairy free crowds! I have made this dish several times by request.
