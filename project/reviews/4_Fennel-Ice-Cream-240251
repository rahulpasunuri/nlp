This ice cream is outstanding! Like the poster below, I had many guests give me dubious looks when I told them I was serving fennel ice cream. But everyone I've ever served this to loves it! The flavor is delicate, sweet and slightly herbaceous. A wonderful accompaniment to stone fruit--I'm serving this ice cream for a farm dinner fundraiser this weekend with grilled apricots and candied pistachios. P.S. This is super easy to make and you don't have to let the infused cream and custard cool separately. I strain them together and let them cool in the fridge overnight, then spin the ice cream the next day.

I've made this recipe twice, the first time exactly as described, then another time with anise seeds in lieu of fennel. Anise and fennel both have a fragrant licorice like flavor, however they come from different plants and in my opinion are not interchangeable (this could be an interesting debate). I believe that fennel is more appropriate in savory dishes or breads. I found that it reminded me too much of the vegetable and I did not enjoy it so much. I repeated the recipe using anise which is more typically used in deserts. Resulted in an exceptionally good ice cream, worthy of 4 forks. Either way, the texture is perfect but I would encourage readers to try it with anise.

Fantastic ice cream. I am not a fan of fennel, but the result is interesting, herbal, and just the right amount of sweetness.

Very nice; subtle licorice flavour, delicate and lovely colour too. Now part of my ice cream rotation; had something similar (perhaps anise?) in Paris and never forgot it. Sandra McNally

This has become one of my top recipes for ice cream. Many people turn up their noses at the thought of fennel ice cream but they all change their minds once they've tasted it, then they ask for the recipe and start making it themselves.

this is very tasty. i love fennel, and eat it every way i can. this is a great new way to get my fix. i was afraid of a bad aftertaste, but was glad to find there was none. i used cheesecloth over my strainer and then gathered it up to make it easier to squeeze all the extra goodness out into the cream.

after reading about this on www.smittenkitchen.com, i absolutely had to try it. this ice cream is absolutely wonderful, a really nice texture, very easily softened, and i'm sure it would make a fennel lover out of anyone! i only wish i had squeezed more fennel essence out of the seeds before i discarded them....
