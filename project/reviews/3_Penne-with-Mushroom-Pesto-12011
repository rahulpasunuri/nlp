I agree that the garlic and seasoning need to be bumped up. Also, I made it with half button and half Crimini mushrooms. I didn't have sherry, so I used a couple of dashes of a dry port I had on hand, which made for an interesting flavor mix.

Yes, I doubled all secondary ingredients too. Plus, for a more interesting texture, I toasted the pine nuts and kept them whole (mushrooms keep sauce thick enough on their own) Good health to all!

This was pretty good, my bf really liked it. I added more garlic, but it turned out to be too much, i would say to use no more than 3 cloves. Also, i made it with wheat spaghetti and i think that added to the flavor.

Liked it but didn't love it like some people. Made the recommended additions of salt and pepper and added some fresh chopped spinach as well after the mushrooms were cooked. Next time I will add some sundried tomatoes for color and flavor.

I used more of almost everything - more salt, more mushrooms, more olive oil and worchester sauce. I didn't have any sherry, but used sherry vinager instead, which seemed to work well. I also substituted basil for the parsley, and what a hit! Great recipe! Will definitely add it to my repertoire!!

This makes a good and easy mid-week supper. I added extra garlic and passed extra cheese at the table. I think the sherry is essential.

I agree that this dish needs liberal salt (and pepper). We tossed it with linguine and it was light and delicious. Plus it was so quick and easy, we'll definitely make it again for a mid-week dinner.

Liked - added a little fresh tarragon to the mushrooms when saute-ing. Brought some more flavor out, but otherwise I liked for the mild flavor.

I found this recipe to be excellent, but it is critical to sufficiently saute the mushrooms to insure that the flavor is concentrated. Also being a little more liberal with the salt can help.

I loved this! My children even liked it! Next time I make it I think I'll add some chopped porcini mushrooms to maximize the mushroom flavor.

I have made this dish SEVERAL times for dinner parties and everyone loves it. It is easy to make. To inhance the flavor I triple the garlic and add a little more of all ingredients to the 10-oz of mushrooms. This has been a keeper for me for the last 3 years!

I made this recipe for my husband and myself last night. It is quick and easy, but not very tasty. I wouldn't recommend it.

Sensing that the dish my be a little bland for my taste, I added about a half cup each of kalamata olives and sun-dried tomatoes (chopped, but not puree'd and added at the end,)which added a nice flavor. With these ingredients, I thought the dish was delicious. I would probably add a bit more olive oil as well.

This wasn't bad, but don't feel it was worth the effort.

This was very quick, easy and tasty - smells wonderful. I modified by doubling the garlic, adding 1/2 cup of grated romano, and omitting the parsley (I just didn't have any on hand).
