OH! BTW, forgot this part - I did seed the tomatoes and still had juice on the bottom. Again, no big deal use a slotted spoon.

From the ingredients, I expected better results from this recipe. The wateriness didn't bother me, just used a slotted spoon but I think it would be more flavorful if some of the cheese was mixed in with the tomatoes. Two cups of cheese just sat on top melted and crusty. One cup mixed in and the other for the topping. More chived too!

This was a yummy side, and a nice way to use summer's tomatoes. I have to say, though, that I cut the cheese in half, but still thought that it might be a little too fatty to serve as an everyday side. I can see why people had problems with the wateriness of the dish. I cored my tomatoes (which did seem like a shame, but I'm glad I did it), and it was still a little bit watery. I also felt that it would have been a lot better with the skins of the tomatoes removed, but then you get into the 'how much time do I want to spend in the kitchen in the summer?' territory. One reviewer mentioned that if you go easy on the salt, the wateriness won't be as much of a problem. This is not true, as the HEAT with which you are cooking is going to draw the moisture out regardless, and if you omit the salt you'll simply end up with a bland, watery dish. You could, however, use salt to your advantage by coating the cut-up tomato pieces with some salt and letting them drain in a colander for half an hour. Maybe I'll try that next time. Overall, this is a nice dish to try.

Who are they kidding? I made this after seeing the rave reviews, but what a mistake! It was a colossal waste of my delicious heirloom tomatoes, and the recipe would be better-named "Heirloom Tomato Cheese Soup." I am a very experienced cook and followed this recipe as written. Definitely NOT recommended.

This was simple and really allowed the fresh tomato flavor to come through. It turned out soupy for me s the presentation was not the best but a lotted spoon worked fine.

This was simple and really allowed the fresh tomatoes flavor to come through. It turned out a little soupy so the presentation is not the greatest but a slotted spoon worked just fine.

The flavor is just great, but seeding the tomatoes first really makes a difference and holding down on the salt also makes a difference, salt tends to draw out moisture..

Very good. Wonderful with fresh garden tomatoes, but it is very soupy. Next time I'll try seeding half the tomatoes or adding some tomato paste. I added mozzarella and basil and served it with It bread. Easy weeknight meal.

Delicious, however, quite soupy. Did I do something wrong? I used organic heirloom tomatoes -- yellow, orange, green, purple -- gorgeous presentation and so, so good -- but so, so soupy. I'll make it again, but maybe seed the tomatoes (although hate to do that to these beautiful things that only show up once a year). Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Glad to see a fellow Boxford resident in print! Can hardly wait to make this again when native tomatoes are ripe, if it's this good without them. Now, if the rain would only stop, maybe we'll see a crop by the end of August!

This was delicious! I added cubes of mozzerella and used red and yellow tomatoes. I will be making this again for sure.
