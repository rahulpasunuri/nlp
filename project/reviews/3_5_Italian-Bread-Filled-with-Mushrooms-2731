The mushroom sauce was wonderful. I added extra gorgonzola because I love it so much. I didn't care for the Italian bread with it, though. I threw the bread out and put the leftover sauce on pasta. That was wonderful.

This is really a great recipe, it tastes wonderful. However, I would advise NOT putting the mixture inside the bread. The first time I made this, I put it inside the bread and when I cut it into slices, it looked like someone threw up on the plate. The second time I made this, I just put the mixture in a serving dish with some cheese sprinkled on top and bread on the side. Much better!

I liked this recipe much better after I made a few substitions. I served this on grilled bruschetta, rather than stuffing the bread. Also, I used a mushroom combo: shiitake, cremini & white button, added shallot and thyme. And as an alternate cheese suggestion should you ever find yourself short on blue cheese: try it with goat cheese. It worked great with the earthiness of the mushrooms. I will be serving it this way as an appetizer for Thanksgiving dinner.

I was VERY pleased with my guests reaction to this dish, they devoured it. Even non-gorgonzola lovers were practically sopping up the juice with the remaing bread. I left the oil and butter as is, and added a splash of white wine. I will definitely make this again.

This was pretty good. I followed some of the other comments and cut the oil and butter to 1 tbs. each and I didn't find it too oily. I let the bread get pretty well done, but I think the crunch was a good offset to the mushroom filling. It's a pretty rich dish and I, personally, didn't have the desire to eat more than one wedge, although my guests did. I found that 4 oz. of gorgonzola added a richness to the taste but not an especially strong blue cheese flavor. I had more than enough filling - I think you could cut back on the mushrooms a bit.

Simple to make & everyone LOVED it, so it's a keeper. I had a problem, though, with it being runny, so I used a slotted spoon to scoop it into the bread bowl. Additionally, the bread bowl wasn't appreciated by my guests, so next time I'll just serve it with precut bread wedges. Even easier!

This was a favorite! Very tasty and the melted gorgonzola and mushrooms paired perfectly. I cut the butter and lessened the oil since other reviewers had problems with the oiliness. That helped. I think you could make this recipe without oil, since the oils from the cheese are enough. I also sprinkled fresh lemon juice over the mix before adding to the bread. Delicious! Will definitely make again.

After reading the reviews, I cut the butter didn't add oil and increased the cheese, tossed in a few spices, forgot to toast the bread and it was the HIT appetizer of Thanksgiving. This will definitely be made at Christmas or any other occassion.

I thought the recipe was a bit bland, but I served it at a party and every bit was eaten! Next time, I'd increase the amount of cheese. Also, I cooked the mushrooms longer than the recipe called for.

I feel that it is a little to oily for me. The bread seems to absorb to much of it. I would like to make it again but I would use less butter and oil. The onios and mushrooms are fine. Dan
