This recipe is just kind of "blah," even with the garlic as suggested by a few reviewers. No need to make this again.

Lettuces with different shapes and color work beautifully. I recommend dressing the salad by taste...first, the oil (to protect the leaves from the acidity of the lemon juice), next the salt, then the lemon juice (adding the right amount is the hardest part of this recipe), a twist of black pepper and, finally, the Parmigiano on top!

I usually don't give 4 forks but this deserved it because it is so simple, quick, and the flavor is great. I added pressed garlic to the lemon/olive oil mixture plus salt, pepper and croutons. Tastes like a 'lighter' restaurant Caesar salad.

Great salad. Add 1 crushed garlic clove for a bold flavor booster. Croutons were a nice touch too.

Yes, yes, yes! I will make it again and again and again! Why didn't I ever thought of that before?! Doh! It's like the basic Ceasar's. Yum. Don't over do it with the cheese because then the salad loses its healthy connotation! ;)

So easy and refreshing, romaine heatrs were sold in too big of a package, so I used hydroponic bibb lettuce instead! Yummy!
