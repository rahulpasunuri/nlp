This is our favorite horseradish mashed potatoes recipe. I'm sure it's still good with half and half as opposed to the cream, but for special occasions I would not change a thing except to throw in a tablespoon or so of butter at the end. The amount of freshly grated horseradish is perfect. This IS great with prime rib, with shavings of the horseradish for garnish, which was part of our Christmas dinner.

This is a yummy recipe. Top it with the caramelized onions included with a similar recipe on this same website.

Very good, I used no fat half and half and the taste was great and much lower in fat and calories. Great paired with prime rib or ham.

With the changes I would serve this dish to anyone. Just exchange the whipping cream with equal amount of lowfat sour cream. Cuts calories and adds a great zip with the horseradish. Great with BBQ steak.
