OK, you guys have never steered me wrong until now. The cakes were tender and delicious and had a nice almond taste. But the sauce, YUCK! It's a simple sauce yet it came out very thick and harsh tasting. What could I have done wrong?

I made this cake without the sauce and was very impressed by the rich almond flavor and moist consistency of the cake. Instead of individual ramekins I baked this in a single standard souffle dish and it came out very well.

the cakes were delicious - reminiscent of Italian pignoli cookies. The chocolate sauce was too bitter/strong for the delicate cake though. I used a 75% chocolate, maybe it needed a bit of sugar to balance it. I would make again, but might used Grand Marnier instead of the passion fruit juice - that should take care of the bitter balance.

This is a great almond cake! Very almondy. I made this cake in a 8" pan to use as a layer cake, which turned out great. You'd have to double the recipe to get to layers to make nice tall layer cake. I found the recipe a bit too sweet to my liking, even though I already cut the sugar to 1/3 cup, next time I'll probably do 1/4 cup only.

When I tasted it, the almond taste took me by surprise since I had not tasted almond anything before. I do not know why recipes have to contain exceptional ingredient- in this case Passion Fruit Juice; so we just ate up the delicious cakes by themselves.

The almond cakes were absolutely wonderful! As for the sauce, I felt that the chocolate overwhelmed the flavor of the almond - but that may be because we couldn't find the passionfruit juice and we used whole passionfruit instead. We will be making these again!

If you love almond, you will love this. You need such a small amount of the juice, I think it would be find with just the chocolate. I made them in much bigger ramekins so actually only made four, which could easily be split between at least 8 people.

Simple and delicious! My whole family enjoyed it. The almond taste is very subtle in the final little cakes. I didn't have passion fruit juice on hand, so I used an equal amount of black cherry juice instead, and it turned out fine. Since we have leftover almond paste, we will be making these again soon! Lovely presentation with the sauce underneath. Just keep it warm since it's basically a ganache and will harden if left to sit too long.
