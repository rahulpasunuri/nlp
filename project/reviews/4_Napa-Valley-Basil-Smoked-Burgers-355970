Great taste and variation on a burger! Whole family enjoyed it as a break from the same-old, same-old. Thought the Zin was a nice touch- added a bit of depth and the pesto mayo was key to set the burger off.

Great burger loaded with flavor. We substituted ground chicken for the protein and used chardonnay instead of zinfandel. We got rave reviews from everyone. Will definitely make this again.

These are fantastic! Tons of flavor! I cooked them under the broiler instead of on the grill and it worked just fine. Instead of making the pesto mayo, I made a mixed the jarred pesto with 4 oz. of goat cheese (and skipped the monterey jack), some lemon juice and salt/pepper and blended in food processer.

so good! i was actually looking around for a good recipe for venison burgers - something with lots of flavor to make up for the lesser amount of fat in venison - and went with this recipe. the basil and the wine really make for excellent taste. i used colby jack instead of monterey since that's what i had on hand. i didn't have any sun dried tomatoes so i left that out and added in some pesto and parmesan to the burger mixture. i didn't put basil sprigs into the fire as instructed, but we did mix in fresh basil to the lettuce atop the burgers. we froze half of the uncooked patties. a few days ago, i set them out to thaw and just cooked them on a grill pan that night. just as good as the first round!
