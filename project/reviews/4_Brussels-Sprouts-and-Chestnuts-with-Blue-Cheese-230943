Fabulous dish. I've converted a lot of Brussels Sprouts loathers with this. The broth mellows out the bitterness of the sprouts and the blue cheese seals the deal. I substitute whatever nut I have on hand.

I have made this recipe pretty much as written for several years now. Everyone loves it! I often don't put the chives on top as my family is not a chive fan. I don't feel as if it detracts at all. I have also often substituted pecans or pine nuts if I can't find chestnuts. The chestnuts are kind of a meaty addition...they definitely give it a particular texture that is unique to chestnuts. But all nuts have worked beautifully. Have also used plain ol' sweet onions in place of the shallots and it turned out fine.

This is the side dish that all my 20+ guests insist I always keep on the Thanksgiving menu! It will impress even the guests who don't care for brussels sprouts!

I made enough for half the dinner party, as I figured not everyone eats brussel sprouts. Everyone loved these! Not a bite of them left. I only used half the pkg of chestnuts, as it seemed like they would overwhelm the dish. I cooked about 5-8 mins. longer than the recipe calls for, as the brussel sprouts were not done enough for my liking. I used the chopped chives on top as directed, but I think it detracted from the dish and will skip those next time. This was a huge hit. "Gourmet" side dish that's so easy.

Fantastic and simple, subbed green onions for both shallots and chives, was a bit strong but still tremendous flavor.

I made this for my Thanksgiving vegetable dish - it was wonderful. I really like brussels sprouts, and the kind I got from the store were perfect, not bitter at all. I used gorgonzola cheese, which added a wonderful richness. The only thing I wasn't hot about was the chestnuts. I'd never had them before, and just didn't care for them, which bummed me out. Might try a different brand next time, as I only found them dried in a package in the asian food section. Oh well, I just picked them out, and I didn't hear anyone else say they didn't like them! --Janene from theweedpatch.typepad.co m

Who knew that guests would actually watch me making this and say "YUM, brussels sprouts!" And they lived up to the prediction - YUM!

Wow, this was great! It's similar to a green bean dish I make with walnuts, bacon and bleu cheese. Chestnuts were not available so I used pecans. I'll definitely make again!

Great option for Brussels sprouts. The chestnuts are superb! I did not try the blue cheese (don't care for it), but I'm sure it would be a nice addition for those who like it. This is easy and is a wonderful change to traditional vegetable side-dishes.

Terrific! Made a day ahead, reheated, then added chives and bleu cheese. A unique Thanksgiving or autumnal dinner side dish.

This was a delicious way to eat brussel sprouts. It was quite rich, and perhaps next time I might halve the amount of chestnuts and blue cheese. The shallots really added to this dish and the chicken stock was necessary for pulling it all together. I served this with 'My Favourite Simple Roast Chicken' from this site, which made a lovely winter dinner.

Fantastic! Made this for Solstice dinner with family/friends and everyone raved. If you like brussels sprouts to start with, you will love this. Try it with gorgonzola, also really good.

Great recipe. Made it as stated. Unbeleivable that brussel sprouts can be this good. Gave it only three forks because we are talking about brussel sprouts here.

I hate brussels sprouts, but this recipe is fantastic! I couldn't find chestnuts, so I substituted pecans. The flavor is great! I will definitely make this one again. This is a great holiday dish.

My goodness this was good. My six year old son asked for more, I almost choked. I followed the recipe with the exception of sauteing the Brussels sprouts in bacon dripping in place of olive oil.

Very nice. I substitued feta for blue cheese, because that's what I had. This dish was scarfed at my family's Thanksgiving dinner, and we have lots of good cooks in my family. Quite easy to make and very tasty. I'll definitely make again.

oh, sweet mother of God, this is delicious! My brussels-sprout-hating husband has been converted (after three helpings at dinner, and cleaning out the leftovers for lunch). And so easy! Was thinking of gilding the lily and sauteing the sprouts in bacon fat and serving with crisp bacon on top, but it was so good as is...Trader Joe's just started carrying vacuum-packed roasted chestnuts, 7 oz for $3.29--a lot cheaper than Williams-Sonoma!

Hated brussel sprouts until now, loved this. Here's some help with the chestnuts found on: http://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheets/HGIC3270.htm STEAMED CHESTNUTS Steaming the chestnuts is the best method for easy removal of the kernel. Cut the chestnuts in half and cook them in a vegetable steamer over boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Most kernels should fall out of the shells during cooking.

This recipe makes brussel sprouts likeable even for the brussel sprouts naysayers. It's also great as a leftover.

Excellent dish. I served it at christmas dinner. unfortunately i was unable to find steamed chestnuts and was forced to choose between pureed vanilla chestnuts and water chestnuts! I chose the water chestnuts, lol. At any rate, it was scrumptious and the blue cheese really made it special. Everyone loved it except for one 4-year-old.

I took this for T-giving dinner, tripling the recipe for 16 people. It was well received--and eaten-- not very many leftovers! My daughter-in-law is making it to bring to my house for Christmas!

Easy to make. Brussel sprouts are not my favorite but I really enjoyed these. The blue cheese added a wonderful taste. My whole family enjoyed and requested that I make it for Thanksgiving.
