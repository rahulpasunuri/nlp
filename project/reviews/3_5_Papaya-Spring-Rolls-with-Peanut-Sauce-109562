Funny range of comments (as in all over the place!). I found the rolls themselves light & refreshing...just what I want in a spring roll. Loved the papaya & cucumber, but I had perfectly ripe papayas that were full of flavor. The sauce, however, was a big disappointment. I had to add all sorts of tweaks before it turned into something good.

I made these a long time ago when I got the magazine subscription and still remember how good they are! I'm not a huge papaya fan so could just be happy with mango. The sauce is ok - unfortunately I'm spoiled by Thai Basil's peanut sauce which tastes amazing and thus, this sauce falls short. Otherwise, this is a wonderful recipe. Storing leftovers is a trick. I store them in tupperware with some wet paper towels but am open for suggestion as they still don't taste as fresh as when I first make them!

Delicious and healthy. The only issue is the tendency to overfill. If you put too much filling, they WILL fall apart when you eat them, so restrain yourself, even if it seems wasteful. The sauce especially is terrific.

Very delicious and easy to make if your patient with the rice paper rolling. I had a lot of left-over papaya, but that's never a bad thing. Got lots of compliments from friends, they all took some home. I used thai basil and it deepened the flavor.

I made this a few yrs back . . . one of my favorite recipes though. Thanks for the suggestion below for Almond butter - same problem. And I use mango instead of papaya; Papaya just isn't very flavorful to me but that might be due to living far away from where they grow it! Is a bit time consuming but I love them!

a group of frends and I made nearly 200 of these for a reception... simple,easy to make and delish. we made a different peanut sauce that did not call for fish sauce.

This dish was barely okay, and not worth the trouble. Working with rice paper isn't bad once you get the hang of it (I suggest wetting each circle individually as you need it) but the rolling is a pain. It might be more fun if you had the fillings on the table and showed your guests how to assemble their own rolls. At least you'll save time and maybe give them a fun experience. But back to the recipe... I followed the peanut sauce recipe exactly and it was easy. Unfortunately, my husband and I both thought it was gross. It tasted just like peaunut butter, only with some burn at the end. In the future, I'd use a different recipe, even if it is more work. Luckily, I had pulled sweet chile sauce from the fridge as a backup. When the rolls were doused in that, they tasted pretty good. I changed the fillings and used mango instead of papaya (personal preference). I made a couple of rolls exactly according to the directions, but they looked (and tasted) way too skinny. So for the rest, I experimented and added cooked shrimp and a little bit of lettuce. This made them look a lot more appetizing, but didn't really change the taste much. Overall, it was an intriguing combination of ingredients and I don't regret trying it--but I'll probably stick with more traditional fillings (and definitely a better dip) in the future.

Next time I would use smooth peanut butter and a bit less fish sauce. I don't think you need to soak the rice paper for 2 min, it will fall apart, 1 min. is more like it.

My husband is allergic to peanuts but not almonds, so we used Almond Butter and it worked great. I changed some of the other the ingredients to avoid the fish sauce and used Mirin (Japanese Rice Wine) in its place. I then substituted seasoned rice vinegar for the unseasoned vinegar.

Overall, it's what you would expect. A nice, fresh, healthy asian appetizer. I made a few changes. I added a dab of soy sauce in peanut sauce to give it a little more depth. I also sprinkled chopped peanuts in rolls to give them more crunch and make them a bit meatier. I also substitued mango for papay, that's just a personal preference. Lastly, I suggest usin Thai basil, it's less overpowering and nicer flavor for this dish.

Well I made a bunch of changes and still have the nerve to rate the recipe. Didn't have fresh basil so that got left out. Also no rice paper so I used spring roll wrappers and gave then about a 5 second pan fry. The sauce I made as stated and also added some fresh minced ginger. Delicious either way. This is a great light lunch or dinner or a starter to a larger meal.

I thought this was just so-so. It was easy to make, and it certainly packs a lot of flavor, but my poor family and guests politely choked it down as the first course of an equally forgetable asian-inspired meal. On the plus side, the peanut sauce was very good, and everyone used it to rescue the Martin Yan entrée from utter blandness. The sauce would definitely be a very good salad dressing, but I won't be making these spring rolls (or the Martin Yan recipe) again.

I made this recipe for a dinner party a few days ago and watched with amazement as our friends - including my boyfriend's Vietnamese ex-girlfriend - ravaged the mounds of slightly moist rolls. I used mango instead of cucumber,liberally dusted the outside and inside of the rolls with toasted sesame seeds, and used only one or two rice paper rolls (instead of three, which seemed excessively thick). I am allergic to peanuts and so I tried to make the peanut sauce with soy butter instead; it didn't work, but the Vietnamese sweet chili sauce worked perfectly. These are great summer appetizers.

Since we have lots of vegetarian friends, I used the peanut sauce recipe from the cook in Toronto (thank you!) (*Also, this made it much easier ingredient-wise, so I didn't have to buy an entire bottle of fish sauce!*). I used mangoes as well just because I'm more familiar with them. I made these rolls for a party a few days ago, and besides the 2 I nabbed before the party started, I didn't get a single one. So, I'm making them again today. And I highly recommend searching out the rice paper wrappers--crepes and tortillas (and others) really don't do this recipe justice. Mail order is a great thing! Enjoy!

Soooo good, the sauce was excellent with just enough peanut and spice. Wonderful!!!

I revamped this recipe to fit the ingredients I had available. I used mango, as did many other reviewers, added 1 large farm fresh green onion, and a minced jalapeno. I created a salad with freshly squeezed lime juice and then softened and cooked two five ounce packages of Thai rice noodles in a packaged garlic sauce. I rinsed the noodles with cold water, drained and added to the salad with one jar of Thai peanut sauce. It was out of this world and my guests thought so as well.

I made the rolls w/ a vegetarian peanut sauce from "This Can't be Tofu": 1/2 c peanut butter, 1 chopped garlic clove, 3 tbs soy sauce, 2 tbs balsamic or Chinese black vinegar, 1 tbs brown sugar, 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/2 c hot water. Combine all ingredients in food processor, except water until smooth. Gradually pour in water. Taste for salt and cayenne adding more if necessary.

Try black, sweet soy sauce - it's in most decent markets.

I did enjoy the spring rolls though I have to say I made the sauce the day before and it tasted so salty and had a horrible smell. I think this had to do with the fish sauce. I actually made another sauce because I didn't think I could eat it. They next day when I made the spring rolls and asked a friend to taste the original sauce it was delicious. It wasn't salty at all nor smelly. I'd make them again but I'd probably use other ingredients in the rolls.

This recipe was extremely easy to make and was an excellent summer recipe! I would definitely try this one again.

To the person allergic to Peanut butter, this recipe is a knock off of the vietnamese summer rolls. For their rolls they use hoisin sauce sprinkled with peanuts, but since my husband is allergic to peanuts also we just skip them!

All of my guests LOVED this recipe! Great little, refreshing summer appetizer that looks pretty too! Used mangos instead of papayas. Had lots of leftover peanut sauce (used regular, not chunky)which used for pasta sauce with veggies, which was also great.

If you are allergic to peanut butter try another type of nut butter such as almond or cashew.

This dish sounds delicious but I am allergic to peanut butter and would probably have to substitute another dipping sauce. Any ideas for those with peanut allergies?

I must have the same peanut butter as a previous reviewer- salty! It was "natural" with no sugar so I had to doctor it with lots of sugar and vinegar. It tasted great after all the tinkering. First, I made the rolls with mango, cucumber, basil, thai basil, mint and cilantro. They tasted wonderful but they seemed a bit skinny... so I added a few baby greens to my later rolls. The greens were a great addition and I'll be making more again soon!

I have always been nervous about making spring rolls, but this recipe showed me that it's not only easy, it's fun! As long as you are gentle with the rice paper, it's no problem. All my party guests loved these. I made the rolls exactly as the recipe stated and they were fantastic. I did use store-bought peanut sauce to save time--it tasted fine, but I found most people preferred them plain. Really fresh ingredients made for great flavors. I made a lot of extras so people happily took home the leftovers!

Being a fan of summer rolls, I'd say these were OK, but they need a lot of peanut sauce to be tasty. I guess I was not a big fan of the 'stuffing'. I prefer the traditional Vietnamese shrimp/watercress/rice vermicelli combination. I served them for appetizers at a function I hosted, and I am disappointed to say that guests were hesitant to try them.

Strange range of comments so far, but the spring rolls were tasty. I've found the ingredients easy to find all along the west coast (yes, even in small coastal communities in SE Alaska. I'll add these to the usual assortment of summer roll appetizers as a choice for vegetarian friends.

I enjoyed making these rolls- they are very easy and fun (fairly hot water worked better than just warm for softening the rice paper rounds). The idea of these rolls( aren't they really summer rolls?) did not initally sound good to one of my co-workers but when I made them for a recent BBQ/picnic she and others said they tasted great. Luckily in Hawaii we have access to all these ingredients year around:). I made mango and papaya versions. Very simple. Very Ono-licious!

Finally -- people with a sense of humor--I love it! I used mangoes (on sale 2 for a buck, so what the heck!) and they were delicious!

Yesterday I was reading the Constant Comment section and was pleased to notice this recipe, since I was planning on making it last night. One of my friends came over, and together we made two types of spring rolls with two different sauces. I had hoped to read about the recipe from others who had tried it. Alas, of the 6 comments, only a few had actually made the recipe. I did enjoy the jokes, though. Anyhow, my friend and made this recipe and also some shrimp rolls, along with the peanut sauce and a sweet and sour sauce. Then she and I, along with our husbands, ate more spring rolls than any of us ever had at one sitting! (Although, I should note that at some point, we had so many spring rolls on trays that we quit rolling them before we had made all 24 rolls.) Everyone was talking about how amazingly good these were, and so simple. This is really one of those recipes where the whole seems greater than the sum of its parts. They are incredibly addictive. We did enjoy them with both the peanut sauce and the sweet and sour sauce. One tiny quibble (which didn't keep me from rating it 4 stars) was that we found when made exactly according to the recipe, the peanut sauce was so salty that we couldn't really taste anything else. It was easily fixed by adding a bit of sugar and a little more rice vinegar. We tasted the peanut butter and it wasn't very salty, so we figured that maybe our fish sauce was a bit more salty than other brands. This morning, my husband told me that he wants this recipe again SOON!

To the cook from Dallas....Good one! Too bad it seems no one else realized you were poking fun at the first reviewer. If you can't find the ingredients with asterisks, and here there were three, it might be time to keep on searching. Makes me glad I live in a place with diverse markets...even if it means the Terminator is our Gov.

Having actually made this recipe for a recent party it came out quite good. We used mangos instead of papaya, but otherwise followed the recipe (e.g. no marshmellow cream). The peanut sauce needs at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator for the flavors to come together.

I have to admit I had some fun with this one. Since there was no hope of my finding any rice paper rounds, I decided to use hamburger buns instead. I started by removing all trace of sesame seeds from each bun before flattening each one with the flat end of a cast iron skillet, giving each bun-half a round rice paper quality (soft white buns work best). The only other minor change I made was to add Skippy peanut butter directly to the flattened buns, rather than going to the trouble of making a sauce. This worked exceptionally well and was a real time saver. I did, however, cheat a bit on the basil and mint leaves by sprinkling some dried version I had in my spice rack. Just as good as fresh, only crunchier. The cook from Dallas really tempted me with the idea of adding marshmallow cream. Next time!

I love these fresh spring rolls. Having travelled around Asia this seems very close to the authentic taste. I modify my own a little by adding bean sprouts and roasted chicken. I also make a second thai spicy/sweet dipping sauce!!

I haven't made this, but neither did the first reviewer. How little do you have to have done to follow the recipe to review it. I would say the first reviewer didn't make the dish.

I used crepes instead of rice paper. These were very good! I also made them with mango which were not quite as fab, but still very worthy of making. I put grilled shrimp in them too, with some hot pepper jelly, "Oh yeah baby", if you know what I mean... Also, didn't have fish sauce for the sauce, still very good but I can see where that would make it "Bam"-delicious.
