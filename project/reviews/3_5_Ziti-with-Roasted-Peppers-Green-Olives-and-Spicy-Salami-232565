Good, but the garlic and shallot didn't get warm enough to take the edge off. Next time I'll sautee them for a minute before tossing them in. I loved the roasted peppers. Next time I'd substitute pepperoni for the salami.

Very good to take on a picnic since it holds well. Flavorful.

Good, but not spectacular. Didn't really have anything special about it. Satisfying meal overall though. Would recommend it for a picnic or maybe as an appetizer. Good for a large gathering as part of a buffet perhaps.

Phenomenal! I luckily had leftover roasted peppers so it was quick too! Trader Joes carries the spicy salami and olives. Used Farfalini pasta, cilantro instead of parsley....lots of red pepper flakes! Recipe has been begged for! Only drawback is no leftovers! I will just have to double it next time!

I made as suggested. Great party dish and I'm sure I'll be making again. Roasting, peeling, and slicing the peppers were a bit of work but absolutely delicious. However, I think if I needed to make the dish in a hurry, I think using roasted peppers in the jar would be fine.

Mmmm, delicious! It usually drives me crazy to read all the variations, but in this instance, I did make a few myself. I couldn't find ziti at any of the specialty shops, so instead I used orzo which worked out fine. I also couldn't find any of the Caliente salami, so started out with some Abruzzo. However, I found the Abruzzo salami, while spicy had the same oiliness as prosciutto that I dislike so off to the market I went again and ended up with a nicely spiced mexican salami. It did the job and this salad is fabulous hot or cold. There's a nice saltiness provided by the olives and the salami that provides a nice bite. A word of caution, the garlic and shallots are great, but be sure you have a breath mint around later if you plan on being near anyone!

This is fantastic! The best pasta salad I've ever had. It would have been very good without the Caliente, but the Caliente put it over the top. If you can't find Caliente, I think some red pepper flakes, in addition to the salami, would be a good idea.
