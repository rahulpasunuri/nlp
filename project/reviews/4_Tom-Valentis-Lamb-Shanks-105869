This was really pretty easy, just a lot of steps. I maybe cooked it about 1/2 hour too long, because it fell off the bone, no chance to present it on the bone like in the picture. I thought it needed just a little something when I tasted it right after cooking, so I stirred in a dollop of dijon mustard and that seemed to do the trick. Finely chopped lemon zest and parsley added a nice freshness. Served with polenta.

I've made this recipe countless times. It never fails to wow people! I follow the recipe exactly, even adding more liquid so that the shanks are almost submerged when braising. The meat falls off the bone and is delicious. After I strain the liquid, I boil it, reduce it, and add a slurry (corn starch & water to thicken) it makes more of a gravy to top with (and dip bread in) and it's perfection! I've served with the bean puree, and also quinoa, rice, or couscous.

I have done this recipe many times and it's always a pleasure to serve and eat. These are my comments: - Do not substitute hind shanks for foreshanks unless it's all you can find - I brown my shanks first then use same pan for the carrots onion and celery and other braising ingreedients. I think it blends the flavors better doing it this way - Use one head af Garlic rough cut rather than whole head cut in half - Use course ground pepper instead of whole pepper corns - After cooking for 3 plus hours straining the solids is not really needed as they have mostly disolved, and if your lamb is trimmed well skiming fat also not needed. Serve the lamb shank with the sauce unstrained over the bean puree, polenta, or mashed potatoes. Beans are the best, but they do take more time and effort than the other two.

This wonderfully tasty dish has been my go to recipe for many years. I occasionally try others but always come back to this one. It has great depth of flavour and can be a homey dish on a winter night or party fare -- sprinkle with parsley and orange rind :) I prepare it in a large dutch oven and don't use as much liquid as he recommends, just enough to barely cover the meat. Too bad shanks are so expensive now but this is worth every penny. I also serve it with polenta, mashed potatoes, or pasta.

Used a fresh herb rub to season the shanks -- chopped rosemary and thyme mixed with kosher salt and pepper -- and used rosemary and thyme in the braising liquid, which was wine only. Did not reduce the volume. Not too much sauce at the end and did not have to reduce. Served sauce without straining out veggies -- thought it looked and tasted better that way. Found the chopping and pre-cooking the braising liquid a bit tedious, but all the guests told me it was worth it! Would turn the shanks every twenty minutes after the first hour. Great make ahead dish. The only person who did not finish the shank was me as I never have an appetite after cooking!

This was delicious, but not out of this world. I made it the day before, took out most of the visible fat, and served with white beans. Very good, but I still think there is a better recipe out there...I am still looking

Followed the recipe to a T, changed nothing and just didn't like the flavors at all. Disagree with the person who said if you don't like anchovies, don't skip them, I smelled anchovies as it was cooking and I think that put me off. I will go back to my standard marinade for lamb-so much tastier than this concoction.

This was amazing! I followed the recipe pretty much as written, except I followed another reviewer's advice and removed the veggies, pureed them and returned them to the sauce. I did braise them, cook them in a roasting pan as the recipe called for, but them moved the shanks to a Dutch oven to sit overnight. I removed the fat the next day and even strained the fat again before reducing the sauce. The flavors were amazing. Guests were really impressed, especially when served with potatoes gratin and roasted baby carrots. I don't care for lamb, but loved this!

I've made this half a dozen times now, with the following adjustments: -- I haven't paid any attention to what kind of shanks I buy. I just buy what's available, and I buy only 4, although I follow the quantities for all other ingredients (except the broth, see below). -- I usually use dried thyme (about 2 tsp), mainly because I forgot to buy fresh. -- I NEVER add the broths. I tried once, and it was too much liquid for the dish. My husband likes the sauce without the broths, and so do I... so feel free to skip them. There's still plenty of liquid. (Be sure good serve bread. The sauce really makes this dish.) NOTE: Even if you don't like anchovies, don't skip this ingredient. You won't know it was part of the dish, but it adds a lovely level of flavoring. -- I serve the lamb with white or butter beans (canned), which I mash, add minced garlic, dried thyme, and about 1/3 c. of the braising liquid (once it's been defatted... so by that time it's really gravy. Stir it up well.) Caramelized Flan makes for a true gourmet meal, start to finish. A Caesar Salad with homemade croutons and dressing rounds this menu out very nicely.

o.k. I'm always on the look out for restaurant quality dishes, this is more like english pub food. Not better than shanks i've braised in the past.

Every one loved this dish and ate every bite. They were even raving the next morning! The only thing I did different that wasn't called out in the recipe was straining the veggies prior to reducing the liquid at the end. After the reduction was complete, I re-added them to the sauce. This left the veggies with some substance.

Another rave review. Perfect for dinner parties as you can prepare everything in advance. I browned the shanks first then browned the vegetables in the same dish. Then I put the shanks in a slow cooker and poured the marinade over the top, cooked on low for 8 hours. Reduced the sauce and blended as other reviewers did. Served over a bed of the mashed beans which I thought were subtle but superb. Everyone finished every scrap except me as the dessert I chose was less straightforward and I kept having to race off and attend to it!

I have been looking for a good recipe for lamb shanks since a visit to a French country restaurant in northern California. This was it! I followed several reviewers suggestions and prepared it the day before. I skimmed the fat the following morning. After reheating the shanks I took yet another suggestion and removed the shanks and pureed the sauce. This was incredible. I served this with Gratin Dauphinois and a nice garden salad and opened a lovely Cabernet. Definately will make again.

Great make ahead meal for guests, be sure to prepare a day ahead so as to chill and remove the fat before making the sauce. Besides the lamb tastes better the next day. I used risotto rather than the white bean puree and it worked well.

Make sure you cook the lamb the day before and then skim off the fat prior to heating up again. What a great do ahead dinner party meal. Reduce the sauce down to get great taste for the lamb.

Delicious day 1, excellent 2. With leftover shanks, removed the meat from the bone (really just falls off) and refrigerated in the sauce. Created a fast meal for holiday guests by reheating meat in the sauce and serving over egg noodles, with a side of green peas and salad. Easy and very, very good.

I almost didn't bother to review this because of the number of other great reviews, but in the end, this was so good that I had to! I cut the recipe to 1/3 because I only had 2 shanks. I strained the sauce, mashing the veggies against the strainer, and it came out wonderfully thick and flavorful. Served with whole white beans and sauteed spinach.

I was fortunate to get 5 superb, huge, meaty lamb shanks for this recipe, and I took the time to trim them very well of excess fat and silverskin. I prepared the recipe almost exactly as written. Instead of halving the head of garlic, however, I peeled all the cloves and added them into the mix. I made this on one day, refrigerated it overnight, and skimmed the fat off the next day. When I reheated it just to the point where the sauce liquefied again, I removed the shanks; then I removed all the vegetables (at the suggestion of another recent reviewer), pureed them in a blender, and added them back to the sauce. This created incredible depth, richness, and texture--without adding more fat or flour. I had purchased a new Le Creuset pot for the specific purpose of making this dish, and it worked admirably: My total cooking time in the oven was an hour less than what was called for, and the meat was exceptionally tender. I can't speak highly enough about this recipe, and recommend it without reservation to anyone who craves lamb shanks. A textbook example of how excellent this cut can be! I served these with garlic mashed potatoes and roasted shallots, mushrooms, and carrots. Paired with an exquisite Pinot Noir, this was a memorable meal for my fellow lamb-lovers.

Instead of straining the vegetables, I put them through a food mill. It was still delicious and the sauce had more substance. I reduced the leftover meat and sauce to make lamb ragu for pasta. It was also tasty.

I rarely offer 4 forks but this is the ONLY shank recipe I use anymore and I've tried them all because my husband and I love lamb and we live in the north so we need this kind of food when it's cold! It's cold and raining this morning so I'm making shanks and since I've not rated this I thought I'd add my 2 cents. I brown the shanks first, then do the veggies, then put the shanks back in the pan and put the pan in the oven. I also never take off the lid. Serve with the white beans or soft polenta or mashed potatoes and a green veg.

This was a great recipe for lamb shanks. I made a few changes based on what I had on hand, homemade veggie broth for chicken, dried thyme, + fresh rosemary, skipped the anchovy, and was out of white wine, (!) so I used 1/3 cup of brandy, and the red wine. I baked it in the oven in a stone crock, and it was great! The sauce definitely needs to be reduced/pureed and don't skip the starch, this rich dish needs it for balance!

Thank you Florida!! I actually checked back to see if anyone had a solution to my problem. I, too, think the roasting pan I used was far too large, leaving too much surface area for the sauce to evaporate. My oven is new...and for what I paid for it, I hope the thermometer works! Thanks again.

Okanagan Valley: The lamb shanks should have fit snugly in your roasting pan. It is also possible that your pan was too close to the bottom of the oven, and/or your oven's thermometor is no longer accurate. Hope this is helpful for you.

I don't know quite what I did wrong...I would appreciate any suggestions from those that did not have this problem. I followed the recipe but found that I lost all liquid. It began to carmelize on the bottom of my roasting pan, so had to add a cup more broth to keep the lamb from drying. It was delicious, but would have been nice to have had some of that wonderful sauce to accompany. Did I use a roasting pan that was too big? I will try it again.

I made these lamb shanks for my college aged daughter and several of her friends who are interested in learning about fine dining. I thought I might have to scrape them off the floor, they'd never tasted anything quite so good. I braised the shanks in the oven and served with softly whipped garlic potatoes and roasted whole carrots. This is the first time I've cooked lamb without tons of rosemary and I like the change. This is perfect comfort food for a cold wintery night.

This was fabulous! I made the sauce and browned the lamb the day before, allowing the lamb to marinate in the frig. Then I only had to worry about getting it in the oven on time the next day. I strained the sauce after cooking was completed and added slurry to thicken it a bit, then served over a potato, root vegetable mash. Wow! Everyone loved them. The size of the shanks was a little overwhelming at 1.25 to 1.5 lbs. But a couple were looking for more. Would definitely make again.

Great dinner party recipe, it can be made a day ahead. I drained the fat off the final cooking liquid then blended the vegetables to make a wonderful thick sauce. Served the shanks on polenta with the sauce.

This is a classic rendition of osso buco with lamb instead of veal shanks. I prefer the lamb! The sauce is outrageously good. This recipe is a great reference, but you can substitute ingredients and make it with what you have. I have served this with risotto, polenta, and mashed potatoes -- all excellent. My tip: Throw in a extra shank and make this with a lot of mashed potatoes, reserve some of the vegetables, and make a shepherd's pie with the leftovers. Mmmm!

I tried this first as suggested in a roasting pan and found it alot of work. the second time I browned the shanks and then put it with the braising liquid in a crock pot. Using the crockpot method I think it gets 4 forks for added ease. It was soooo much easier and the flavor was the same. both times after straining the braising liquid I reduced it. It was otherwise a little thin to serve as a sauce. I don't like white beans so I skipped the bean puree but it was amazing atop horseradish smashed potatoes and a side of asparagus. Fabulous!

Delicious and easy recipe. A definite keeper as we enjoy eating lamb frequently and the flavour of the final results defy the simplicity and ease of preparation. It would also perfect for company, since it reheats very well. Followed the recipe precisely, except that I didn't strain the sauce and used only minimal oil for browning. This resulted in a beautiful non-fatty sauce loaded with flaour. Regarding the white bean accompaniment - I used navy beans, did not puree or add cream. The flavourings were very nice. The lamb shanks tasted even better 2 days later when reheated and served with potatoes and vegetables. I started with frozen lamb foreshanks from Australia (thawed before starting), so the cost of the dish was also quite reasonable as the shanks were very meaty and had minimal fat. I highly recommend you try this recipe.

Using a cast-iron stock pot I seared one large lamb shank (for two) in 1/4 cup olive oil then removed it and proceeded with the recipe substituting 3 tsp. dry thyme, 8 anchovy stuffed olives chopped, and red wine vinegar worked just fine. The large chunks of garlic are awesome and the olives made it special. I served it with red mashed potatoes but thought it would be excellent with polenta. Really a wonderful recipe

Rating: 4
The shank turned out delicious. I wanted to make this as healthy as possible and didn't use any oil when browning the shank though. Also, browning the shank and the veggies in the same pan worked out just fine. If you like more texture, the shank would be ready in 2 1/2 hours instead of the 4 mentioned. Yum!

This was an excellent dish and the beans a beautifully balanced accompaniment. Two extras that I added: 1. Strain the braising liquid and reduce(don't worry too much about getting rid of the fat)to make a truely lucious sauce and 2. Use White Truffle oil with the beans - a few drops in the mash and a small drizzle to serve.
