If it is too bitter, add some dried chinese red dates. Add some angelica root too to make the soup extremely fragant. I have basically had this soup my whole life, it is rejuvenating and healthy. Another myth is that it is better that you drink it on an empty stomach so that your stomach can 'soak' up all the nutrition from the ginseng and angelica root

I would just like to respond to the previous viewer's critique of this recipe. Obviously this recipe went way over your head! The purpose of this recipe is strictly for medicinal purposes and to promote good health. This recipe will never satisfy one's urning for a gourmet meal....so in other words, don't knock it if you do not know what it is used for. Anyways the taste of the soup fits its purpose, it taste awful but medicine always does!

Grill and slice the chicken. Mince the Ginseng Root. Saute FRESH Abalone, Ginseng Root, and sliced almonds in butter and garlic oil. Serve over, or with a side of, rice. Hey, drink a glass of water too, so you don't leave out any of the recipe.
