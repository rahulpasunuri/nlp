I'm also glad that I tried this recipe, but I did make some changes. To make this recipe even healthier I removed the sugar from the cake. I used about 2T of honey and instead of 1/2 cup of applesauce I used about 1/3 and added about 3T of apple butter. Also added cinnamon and nutmeg to the dry ingredients and 3/4 of a chopped up apple. For the topping I added some quick oats, unsweetened coconut, sliced almonds and the remaining 1/4 chopped apple to the mixture. The cake puffed up nicely and was definitely not dry. It was a hit at the office and home!

I am glad that I tried this recipe despite some of the reviews. I followed this recipe exact and it is amazing! A perfect light fluffy treat to enjoy with a cup of coffee. I don't find it dry or tasteless. I am not sure why anyone would give this a bad review, I have just finished my second piece and I still can't find anything wrong with it.

Just made this and I think it's yummy. I was worried based on some of the reviews but I was a little heavy handed with the butter and apple sauce, threw a little extra brown sugar on the top and added a tiny bit of nutmeg. I made a crumb cake a couple of weeks ago, traditional with the sour cream and everything, and it is too unhealthy to make regularly. This I can make and eat without the guilt about the health effects (or the calories!)

made this yesterday, added more apple sauce and it was yum!Served warm, dusted with icin/powdered sugar and creme fraiche. Definately making it again.Maybe some flaked almonds on top of the crumble would be nice. Yvonne

Okay, to those who complained of dryness, you must remember this is a HEALTHY coffee cake. It will not, I repeat not, taste like the decadent coffee cakes you typically find in bakeries, because those contain 1) more sugar 2) Lots more butter. When butter is left out of anything, it not only affects texture and moisture, but also flavor, as butter naturally enhances and melds flavors. That said, this is a healthy coffee cake. This has about 2,000 calories for the ENTIRE cake. So, if you cut it into 8 pcs, that is 250 cal per piece. A piece of regualr coffee cake of the saem size would run you about 500 cal. Considering the dif in calories, fat and cholestrol, this is a pretty good alternative. I am considering upping the sugar by 2 tbsp next time and adding some chopped apples sauteed in 1 tbsp butter.

Thanks to those who provided tips and tricks for this recipe. I increased the amount of the topping, added the 2nd egg yolk, some extra applesauce and vanilla. It was a bit complicated to make but it looked and tasted great.

I was very disappointed with this. It's not really all that healthy, and the taste is pretty bland. Nothing special at all.

Too dry. Not at all what I had hoped. I even used apple butter instead of applesauce and cream instead of buttermilk.

Even though I added ginger and nutmeg and some white sugar this recipe was blah. I mixed everything together rather than separately and it rose up beautifully - but taste was just not there

moist enough, and crumb topping was okay, but the cake tasted overwhelmingly of baking powder (and yes, i used the right amount!).

This cake was quite dry and bland. My friend said it was great, but I think he was just being polite.

Taking the advice of previous reviews, I reduced the sugar added extra applesuace, and lemon zest. I doubled the crumb topping and put half of it in the middle of the cake. It turned out very moist with plenty of flavor but not quite as healthy, next time I would add fruit in the middle instead.

Loved this dish a lot! It was a little dry for my taste, so added extra applesauce the second time around and it came out great! Would go great with a nice cup of hot coffee!

This was really good. After reading other reviews i decited to double the vanilla and add a dash of cinnamon to the batter and add walnuts (just a little bit) to topping. This came out of the oven and I thought it wastn't going to be good but it really turned out great. It was a little more work than I thougt it would be. I would make this again and would recommend making it to anyone....my husband loved it! It's hard to get him to eat anything low or lower fat.

This was a great low-fat recipe! Even my husband liked it, especially the crumb topping. The only thing i might change at his request is adding some mashed banana for a little more moisty goodness..let ya know how it goes.

I would consider this recipe to be a "work in progress". It did turn out v. moist and light, so I think it has potential. However, it was rather bland. An addition of a layer of fruit or preserves, and nuts or oats in the topping would probably make it a lot better. I think you could play around with the recipe and achieve good results.

I didn't put the lemon peel in, because I forgot. I used a dark glass pan. It turned out great. I served it for Mother's Day brunch and everyone loved it. My family is pretty picky. I am glad I did not read the reviews when looking for a low fat coffee cake.

I made this for our monthly birthday brunch at work and everyone enjoyed it very much. My 7 year old made it with ease with only some help from me. I also omitted the lemon and used the dark pan and it turned out moist.

I should have listened to the other reviews. This was all but tasteless. The only salvation was the chopped nuts I had added. I almost threw it out, but decided to warm it and add apple butter on one occasion, and eat it with vanilla frozen yogurt on another.

Rather rubbery with little flavor.

This is just about how you would expect a low fat recipe to taste -- pretty awful.

I was using a dark-coated cake pan, so I baked it at 325 F. for 28 minutes and it turned out PERFECT!! You will not believe how moist this coffee cake is, it'll blow your mind.:) I also omitted the grated lemon peel.

Great recipe and very tasty; however I do have a comment on the instructions in the recipe itself: How do you sift brown sugar? It made quite a mess when I tried to shake it through a sieve with the rest of the dry ingredients. Shereen Morris Alexandria, VA
