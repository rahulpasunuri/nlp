This was delicious. I cut back the curry to 1 teaspoon and put the pears in a 6 minutes instead of 12. I should have put them in at the same time as the potatoes. The were not quite ripe so they needed a little more cook time. I also used a large shallot instead of a onion and doubled the garlic (I always double the garlic in any recipe). I also left the almonds out. I will make this again.

Really, really nice way to cook potatoes. Forgot the lemon, would be interesting to see what it adds but, on the whole, it was just about perfect. We ate it with chicken glazed with the maple sauce recommended in the recipe. But, as good as the chicken was, we could have just eaten the potato salad and been fine. I would recommend more spinach, as others did. I used all the spinach I had in the fridge and it could have been good with a lot more.

Loved the flavor and how easy this dish was. Did some minor changes - used mixed of sweet potato, red, purple & yukon gold; only used 1 tsp curry powder and baby arugula. Did cut the potatoes into smaller cubes, still took longer than the stated time in recipe. My pears were soft so added them at the last minute. Make sure pears are ripe-firm for best taste texture. Will definitely make again.

Really fabulous. Like others have suggested, I added quite a bit more spinich than the recipe calls for. I also added some cilantro (from the tuna steak recipe this is paired with), and that put it over the top. Next time I'm going to cook the pears with the potatoes - the pears were still pretty crunchy, and it was a little disconcerting, b/c the pears and potatoes look the same. Still really wonderful.

I agree with previous posts: cube the potatoes smaller than recipe suggests, add more spinach, and 1.5 tsp is a bit much - 1 tsp should work just as well to pull the flavors together.

Used sweet potatoes, otherwise, just as printed. It is fabulous!! Served it with the spatchcock chicken with maple and pepper glaze. There is nothing left!! I will definitely make this again and again.

Would make it again, but I'll cut the potatoes and pears smaller. Might also try sweet potato.

Only alteration I made was to cut my potatoes and pears a little smaller - about 1-1.5 cm. The recipe was so simple and absolutely mouthwatering. Highly recommended.

I used sweet potatoes and it was really great!

So flavorful and savory! I didn't have red onions so I used shallots and they worked fine. I will definitely make this again!

I forgot to add, I didn't add nearly as much lemon juice as the recipe called for per the other reviews and I think that was a good call.

Pretty good. Next time I'll make a few changes: cut the potatoes smaller, about the same size as the pear chunks. Cook the potatoes longer. More greens. I loved the flavor though, the curry and pear was very good. Made it with the Maple Glazed Tuna and it was a VERY EASY and DELICIOUS dish. Will make it again.

Didn't turn out as I had hoped. I didn't use yukon gold potatoes so maybe that's why...I don't know it just was kinda blah overall. Probably won't make again.

Had a very strong citrus taste that seemed to overpower everything else, but I really enjoyed it. The curry didn't add too much kick, which I was afraid of.

I sliced my potatoes with the slicing blade on my food processor. Cooked them until they were browned. I added the pears - don't worry if they are not ripe, they cook better. I used whole baby spinach and added it to the hot potatoes so it would wilt. I also only added 1 tsp of curry instead of the full 1 and 1/2. The results were.... FABUOLOUS!!! I had people who "hate spinach and hate curry" who ate 2nds and then 3rsds. Very, very, delicious! Enjoy!!!

I really enjoyed this when I first made it (also left out some of the lemon juice - just drizzled a little over the top) but had lots of leftovers. I warmed it up the next day, and it was not nearly as good. I didn't want to waste the rest of the dish though, so I made a cold potato salad out of the dish and it is AWESOME. I took the cold leftovers and made a sauce of maple syrup, mustard, and red wine vinegar. About 2 1/2 tbsp of pure maple syrup and 2 tbsp of yellow mustard and just a small splash (about a teaspoon maybe?) of the red wine vinegar for a little bite. It has been an even BIGGER hit cold!

I made this to go with the Maple-Glazed Tuna. It worked pretty well except that it was too sour. Next time I think I might use just a teaspoon of lemon juice, if any at all. I just don't like too much acidity with potatoes, or most foods, for that matter. I had problems sauteeing the potatoes in a stainless steel pan. I ended up using a lot of oil, and still adding water so that they cooked. But next time I might roast the potatoes instead. I didn't bother chopping the almonds, since they were sliced already. And I didn't have curry powder, but made a substitute, also short of the real thing because I didn't have all the ingredients for that either, by using about 1-1/4 tspn ground cumin and 1-1/4 tsp ground black pepper. I forgot to shred the baby spinach, which made it hard to toss with the potatoes, so definitely shred them.

Yikes! Measure the curry powder correctly! I think this could have been a good dish, but I ruined it by (1.) Making it a day in advance (2.) Accidentally adding way too much curry. (3.) Not cooking the potato slices long enough REMEMBER: HASTE MAKES WASTE! (So, don't do what I did!).

It was really good. Just two comments: 1) I added a teaspoon of cinnomon and 2) I would cook the potatoes just a bit longer. Very easy though, other than peeling the potatos. ;-)
