I bought really fresh shrimp from our local fish market. A very easy, quick and tasty salad. It would be great for a luncheon or shower. I added all ingredients (except avocado) including the greens to the dressing. I divided it between plates, topped with avocado slices and put the shrimp on top.(I took the shrimp out of the salad/dressing.) Worked great because there is no way your going to get all the salad in a halved avocado. I may even cube the avocado next time and add it to the greens. I added halved cherry heirloom tomatoes to the salad.

So very easy. So very tasty. The lemon peel adds sparkle. I added chopped celery. Avocado is not totally necessary, but nice. Oh, yes. Shrimp Louis to me means iceberg lettuce, so that's what I used. I like to feel that I am in a bar-restaurant on upper lake Michigan!

Was looking for a good Louis sauce and this is it. I'm very picky about mayo (many of us are) and my favorite is Trader Joe's organic. But...I didn't have any regular chili sauce so I used a mix of good quality organic ketchup and vietnamese chili sauce. For the salad ingredients, I agree that a Louis must have hard-boiled egg and tomato.

Nice classic---definitely need the hard-boiled egg and tomatoes, though! We used the small shrimp, mixed it into the dressing, and it was great for summer dinner :)

Very good... our avo was bad when we cut into it (don't you hate that!) - but we had some grape tomatos and a baby cuke that substituted nicely. The dressing was exactly like my mom used to make for this salad! LOVE that!

I loved the dressing recipe, but I had no lemons so I substituted fresh lime juice and lime zest-- actually it was an improvement. I also used wedges of tomatoes, hardboiled eggs and chopped iceberg lettuce as in the classic version I remember from the 50's at Joe Muirs in Detroit. An "Epicure" from Sarasota, FL 7/20/08

Outstanding! Just like shrimp louis salad I used to get at the coffe shop at Resorts Int'l Hotel in Atlantic City. I made the salad more traditionally: salad greens, tomato, hard boiled egg (a must!), cucumbers, green onion, and carrots. For the dressing, I used bottled lemon juice and added some black pepper. Perfection for Shrimp Louis salad!

SO easy and yummy. I used bottled lemon juice for lemon and rind -- it still was awesome!

Delicious.

Delicious, quick and even easier with deveined shrimp. We used cocktail sauce (made w/chili sauce) and the horseradish/hot sauce combo kicked it up a bit. Put green onion IN sauce.

Nice and simple. Use the sauce portion of the recipe to make a quick tasty shrimp po-boy.

okay sorry, tried to edit my "chopped dill" comment b/c it didn't apply to this recipe but instead I posted twice! sorry again.

I probably won't make this again - nothing special here. I did want to mention though - this recipe's taste can change dramatically depending on what type of chili sauce they are referring to. Traditional American chili sauce has sugars in it and create a rather sweet flavor. There is also chili sauce such as Thai or other Asian types, Mexican, or even tabasco type chili sauces - I used a non-sweet type of Asian chili sauce as I don't usually care for sweet-based seafood salad dishes. In any event I just think there must be a better shrimp salad recipe than this. Perhaps its just personal preference.

this was an easy last-minute recipe that i will definately add to my collection. i cut the avocado into chunks.

Tasty, and takes about five minutes to put together.

This was so easy and so good and the presentation is very impressive! I didn't add the tomatoes this time but I agree with other cooks that they would definitely be a great addition. I couldn't find baby greens so I used "spring mix" and used a florida avocado instead of a Haas. I also found that cutting up the avocado in pieces worked better than leaving it halved. If you use tomato, chop it finely. I used 16 shrimp instead of 10(26-30count). I also used more green onion.

this is a great recipe if you want something light and fairly easy to prepare. i followed the recommendations from a previous review and i diced the avocados and placed the avocados and shrimp on top of the greens. i enjoyed the dressing as well. it was zesty and had a nice kick to it. i will make this again.

This salad was great-the dressing was very flavorful and very easy to make. I made a few changes to the recipe-i diced the avocado and mixed it along with the shrimp in the dressing and served that over a bed of romaine lettuce,cukes,and heart of palm.This meal was very light and refreshing.

I served this with a chilled summery white wine and asagio foccacia. it was a great light meal. Fresh tomatoes were a must, I agree with the other reviews. The sauce was a little overpowering for the avocado. Next time I will cut chili paste in half and add dried chilis to keep heat level w/out other flavors.

Be sure to include the tomatoes. Add the chili sauce to taste: some are spicier than others and a tablespoon may be too much. Altogether very easy and tasty!

This was elegant and so easy to prepare! I added a fresh diced tomato.

So delicious yet so simple to prepare. The flavor of the sauce was perfectly balanced. Assembled on a bed of baby asian greens that included tat soi, mizuna, red chard, and arugula. Topped with sliced avocado halve and cherry tomatoes from my garden, still warm from the sun. Added additional shrimp to make up nice dinner salads. Served with a crusty olive bread and Australian chardonnay.

The dressing was outstandig. I'll use it for other salads. This was one of the easiest recipes and it is ideal for a Summer dinner. I plan on trying scallops or chicken in place of the shrimp for something different.

This was a quick, easy and yummy lunch. I didn't have the avocado but it was still good on a bed of greens. I added diced cucumber too. The dressing is really good!

A very easy fast and tasty dish! Will add more green onions next time.

I made this recipe one evening when I was short on time but not short on taste buds. I found it very quick to make and pretty good as an alternative to plain salad. I would suggest to other healthy minded people though to use low-fat mayo instead of the real deal. You can cut back on alot of fat and calories without losing taste.

Made this recipe last night. Found it quite good considering how very easy it was to make. Garnished salad with grape tomatoes and kalamata olives. For the "Real" thing try Crab Salad with sundried Tomato Louis Dressing...on this website. It's wonderful!!!!
