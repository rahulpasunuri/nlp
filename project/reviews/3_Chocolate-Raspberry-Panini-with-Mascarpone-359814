I don't know if the French bread was too thin? Not enough Mascarpone? The fresh raspberries were lost in all the goo! The raspberry preserves were of a good quality. We made this because a member of our gourmet group wanted to have a summer menu that had everything done on the grill. Done it - will never do it again.

This was FANTASTIC! I used fresh raspberries that had *just* been picked, good quality chocolate, and a nice french bread from a local bakery. The bread came out beautifully crisp and caramelized, and the inside was rich, gooey, and delicious. My guests RAVED about it and wouldn't leave without the recipe.

Good flavors but what a mess. 10 minutes isn't enough to get the chocolate to a consistency that doesn't squeeze out from between the bread slices. Our French bread had holes in it so hard to contain the ingredients when cooking, and the brown sugar got stuck to the griddle. Also we could barely taste the mascarpone.
