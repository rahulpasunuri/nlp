This has become our "good to" for company. Like others, I serve this with thick-cut potato chips instead of the potatos. Quick and easy, what's not to love

Wow!! Everyone raved! I did play with a touch and added 2 tablespoons of chopped capers and the lemon zest. T true winner

Easy, Elegant and Everyone loves it. Too lazy to make the potatoes so we've used the fancy gourmet chips instead. I am keeping 1/4 pound packages of smoked salmon in the freezer so it is easy if unexpected guests appear to thaw and whip up a quick appetizer that everyone (so far) has loved

We really didn't care for the taste of the tartar with the potato, so we rolled the mixure up in blinis instead. It was amazing!

My guests really enjoyed this appetizer. I added capers atop the dollop of sour cream. Easy to make and impressive to serve.

The tartare gets 3 forks, but the new potatoes slices get 1/2. I would make this again, but serve on potato pancakes or crostini.

I would not change a thing in this recipe. We have made it twice and both times we should have doubled the recipe, it was such a hit.

This was amazingly good and soooo easy! My guests devoured it. I added some finely diced cucumber to the tartare and served it with potato chips. The chips were a little salty, so next time I would use low-salt chips or perhaps cucumber slices.

I served these on cucumber rounds for something lighter and while it was very easy and elegant, it just didn't do it for me. I might try making this again on the potato slices or perhaps the gourmet chips mentioned below if I could find them. But, something was missing from this dish. Not sure what it is but although it got praise from the party it was not a favorite.

Absolutely sublime! I used the best quality olive oil potato chips (gaufrettes) instead. The presentation was outstanding and they tasted SOOOOO good! My guests loved these! Be sure to chop the red onion very, very finely. An amazing, easy, and elegant recipe...can't wait to make it again!

My guests raved about this appetizer!

A great and very polished-looking appetizer. I usually don't bother with the potato slices, as the "tartare" works very well on water crackers. People ask for this, and are always astounded at how simple it is to throw together.

This has become my standard hors d'ouevre to serve with champagne before a meal. I place it on small, bite-size blinis, and top with a tiny dollop of prepared gravlax sauce, which adds a delicately sweet flavor. I have at times substituted prepared rouille for the gravlax (on hand, for example, if one of the courses is fish soup)and this adds a more intense, garlicky flavor (so just a soupcon of it; otherwise, it will overpower.) I agree with others that capers are a welcome addition to the tartare. I also prefer to use lime juice rather than lemon.

Easy and delicious. Served tartare with watercress on grilled bread seasoned with olive oil and herbs. Also added some chopped capers in the tartare mix.

Was a hit at our New Year's Eve party. I used Creme Fraiche instead of Sour Cream and the creamier look/texture was nice. A nice compliment to a shellfish appetizer at a cocktail party.

We have discovered a wonderful answer to all of the potato concerns in the other reviews. Make the tartare per the recipe, but serve it in a bowl with a large dollop of sour cream on top and a small spoon. Surround the bowl with the thick, olive oil potato chips available in upscale markets and specialty grocery stores (we love lemon flavor chips with this recipe). Our guests New Year's Eve parked themselves around the bowl (a double recipe!) and didn't leave until the bowl was clean! The salty, delicious olive oil chips topped with the salmon tartare are too good for words. Pairs wonderfully with Champagne and other dry, sparkling wines.

Made this for New Years Eve and nobody really liked it. The "tartare" was good, but the steamed potato did not make the grade. My husband was scraping his off and putting it on bread.

Served this as an appetizer before our Christmas dinner. Everyone loved it! Definitely a keeper. (I also baked the slices). Kept everyone guessing as to what it was. Also added 2 capers to the sour cream.

We served this three times over the Christmas holiday, to raves each time. It's easy and quick to make, and transports easily. We added asparagus wrapped in proscuitto to the platter, which made for a lovely presentation, all pink and green. (Be sure to cut the potatoes thick enough or they will break easily. A mandoline really helps.) Enjoy~

delish..try it on thin slices of cucumber for a change. also, i didn't have chives so used the tops of green onions and it was just as good.

Super duper! This so easy to make and a totally impressive hit at parties... I'll always include this in my dinner parties. I used a V-slicer (mandoline) for the potatoes - steaming was a snap. No need to put salt in the salmon mixture. Don't chop it too fine... I didn't brush potatoes with lemon - turned out just fine -

Impressive, delicious, easy to make appetizer. Our guests liked it so much they, I printed copies to take home. Have added this to my recipe box.

I used smoked trout and I, too, baked the potato slices. I don't think I'd make it in a food processor as it has an appealing texture using chopped ingredients.

Although I thought the dish was 3 forks, my office mates kept raving about it! Most people said it was the "fresh" taste that made them keep eating and eating and eating. I think they might have licked the bowl because it is so clean! Oh, I, too, baked the potatoes.

A little onion-y even though I cut the onion ingredient by half but it was still delicious. I don't have a food processor but I wish I did. I would also drain the "tartare" on a paper towel, it was a bit soggy but again, still delicious.

An easy gourmet hors d'oeuvre. I used baby bliss potatoes and roasted them the day before. I put it all into a mini food processor and was amazed at how fast and easy this was. I suggest draining the salmon mixure on a paper towel before placing on the potato slices to prevent them from becoming soggy. These were a hit at my party and my family was still enjoying them 2 days later.

When I made it the first time, I also baked the potato slices and it was delicious. In a hurry one time, I served the tartare on garlic melba rounds and it was surprisingly good.

I spinkled the potatoes with salt & pepper then roasted them in the oven for about 30 minutes. I put them in a zip lock for a day and they keep their crispyness. I also topped the sour cream with a couple of capers which made them look a little more elegant. Everyone loved them! It's an easy assembly that doesn't take too long.

We love the smoked salmon. I also roasted the potatoes in the oven, and it worked out great.

I make this every Thanksgiving, and tiny capers are a nice addition to the salad. They're also good topped with sour cream and chives. I'm going to try the "baking" method from the Epicure in Hawaii....I've been partially steaming, then grilling my potatoes and they aren't too good.

The advice from the first cook was excellant, I also baked my potato slices very good. A put a dash of Nature's Seasoning on each potato slice.OK I won't do that again.

Well, the smoked salmon salad was wonderful. I really enjoyed how the flavors complimented eachother. The one thing I would change, and did, is to bake the potato slices instead of steaming. The steaming made the potatoes to soft in my opinion. I would bake them until they are just crispy and then top with the salad. I would also put some spices on the potatoes, not sure what spice yet, because I also found the potato to be a bit bland without anything but lemon juice on it.
