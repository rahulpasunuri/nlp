I really like this dish. The only thing I do differently is to add 1 1/2 tbs of either aporcot jam or orange marmalade when you are cooking the chicken with the wine.

This was so simple, yet delicious and sophisticated...would serve it to guests anytime. I questioned the addition of the grapes, which I cut in half before adding, but they added a surprising great flavor to the sauce. The amount of sauce was just enough for 2 cutlets and would have been enough for 3. It was late in the day when I started this recipe for dinner, but it took just a little more than a half hour for a wonderful meal to be on the table. I served it with the buttered carrots and couscous suggestion. Will definitely be making this many more times!

I forgot to add that I didn't have any shallots so I used a bit of minced onion - it worked perfectly fine. And I also always deglaze the pan with the wine first, then add the cream. It definitely adds a little something special. Basil is the perfect substitute for those not in favor of tarragon.

I just experimented with this recipe tonight and added fresh basil from my garden in place of the tarragon. It was delicious!!!!! I also used a sweeter dry white wine ( a pinot gris) because I didn't have any grapes on hand. I served it with the Creamy Polenta and broccolini with garlic. We couldn't stop licking our forks and plates. This recipe is so versatile, and a great option for using up fresh summer herbs!

Delicious, easy and pretty! The only thing that I did differently was to deglaze the pan with the wine rather than adding it with the cream. I used the red grapes for color. I will definitely make this again!

awesome and easy. use more salt and pepper. dont over cook chicken. i served it with pinenut couscous and green beans with shallots, etc. the better the wine you use, the better the sauce is. i gave it 4 forks for simplicity and flavor

Great recipe with wonderful flavors. Grapes add a delicious sweetness and texture, and pairs perfectly with the crisp wine and silky cream. The tarragon gives it that much needed contrast. I wouldn't change anything except a tad less tarragon. Too much is the only complaint I've received from this recipe. This is definitely one to put in the recipe box.

Such an easy, delightful dish with smashing flavours that melt in your mouth. I am making this dish again tomorrow evening for a dinner party of 15 people - as per my husband's request! try it out! You can also used dried tarragon if you can't find the fresh herbs.

It was ok - the sauce wasn't very flavorful. Just felt like it needed something

I've always wanted to try a Chicken Veronique recipe, but I was still a little leery of making this -- I was concerned that the grapes would become mushy, or that the flavor combination would be strange at best. But this recipe was a happy surprise -- it was absolutely delicious. It's rare for me to have green grapes and tarragon in the fridge at the same time, but miraculously I did, so I made it (with minor alterations: I used one larger-sized shallot, a full cup of green grapes, cut in half, and close to 3 T chopped tarragon in total.) It was wonderful -- there's no overwhelming tarragon flavor, and the grapes add a burst of juicy sweetness and acidity that balances the richness of the cream sauce. Be sure to generously season your chicken with plenty of salt, pepper and tarragon -- you can be more daring than what the recipe suggests. We ate it with green beans on the side, plus buttered basmati rice to soak up the lovely sauce. It's going into our "keeper" file.

This recipe needs some perfecting. The sauce was okay, but needed more flavor. I did swirl in some port at the end and that helped. Like the idea of the recipe, so I am going to play with it. The couscous and buttered carrots were nice on the side.

was great....could do again for larger group. huge flavor

My husband raved about this dish although I am not convinced yet. I served this with couscous and roasted carrots and parnips. My husband said the sauce was very good on top of the couscous and he could eat it that way OR with the chicken. To me, there was something . .odd about the sauce. I cant really explain but it wasnt what I thought it was going to taste like. It's worth a try and I will make it again for my husband but it's not something I would make just for me.

Loved it! Very flavorful and easy!

Rating: 2
I was disappointed by this. I didn't feel that the flavors melded together to create as an expecially flavorful sauce -- it was a bit ho-hum even though I seasoned the chicken with garlic granules and used a whole package of fresh taragon. I liked the hot grapes, but they imparted nothing to the dish as a whole. Chicken Fricasse or Smothered Chicken would be more tasty, but I like the warmed grapes, so I'll continue to look for a recipe Veronique.

Outstanding. I was a little leary about eating "hot" grapes, but this dish truly was delicious. Served with the suggested steamed carrots and couscous. Good enough for company.

Delicious! And my husband thought so as well. I used a combination of champagne grapes and small red grapes from the farmers' market. Served with orzo and sugar snaps. Definitely a keeper.

this recipe is AMAZING! pile in the grapes and pile in the tarragon, it'll make your kitchen smell divine!

This was very popular; I doubled the recipe and it worked out well. The sauce is a bit bland and perhaps "thicken until it coats the back of the spoon" is open to some interpretation; eventually I decided it was sort of coating the spoon and called it a day. Very good for all that; definitely will make again.

I made this when having a couple of friends over for dinner. The chicken itself was fine, but we all found the sauce to be quite bland (although it was okay with the couscous). There needs to be more flavour in this recipe. Also, the sauce never thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon.

i made this for my boyfriend and our friend and they both loved it. i dont like rice and i had no couscous so i just served it with toast and it worked very well. the next day i had left over ingredients but no chicken so i used shrimp and it was still amazing. a very good recipe.

I've made this dish about four times over the past year, and never tire of it. It is easy and tasty. It goes well with a sav blanc or pinot gris (not a fan of chard so...). I serve it with the couscous as recommended but vary the veggie (I like sugar snap peas - but use red grapes then for more color). I have also increased the shallot to grape ratio and eased up on the whipping cream. It's yummy either way.

My fiance loved this sauce! I sliced the grapes in half and used dried tarragon leaves. I'll make it again, easy to prepare.

Rating: 3
This was quick and delicious and got two thumbs up from my husband. I prefer dark meat to chicken breasts, so I used skinless boneless chicken thighs and it turned out great. I put the cooked chicken in the oven at about 200 degrees F to keep it warm while I made the sauce and it was still moist when the sauce was ready. Make this one -- your family will love it.

Delicious! Added a bit more tarragon and used a combination of red and green grapes (halved for better presentation), but otherwise followed the recipe as written. Served with the couscous and buttered baby carrots, as suggested - even served strawberry/rhubarb tarts for dessert. Perfection! Company loved it - as did I, and very simple to make. Definitely a keeper!

This was very good - but why wouldn't it be with butter and cream! I used dry tarragon instead of the fresh and served it with rice and buttered green beans. It was fast and easy for a weeknight, but would also be a good company dish.

I loved this recipe. Gourmet taste and presentation but very easy to make. I modified recipe only slightly in that I used black seedless grapes (halved) and dried tarragon. I look forward to serving it to dinner guests and hearing raves.

Had some sweet yellow "cherry"-sized tomatoes I wanted to experiment with in place of the grapes. Made the following other changes: after briefly turning (unpounded) chickenn pieces -- sprinkled with about 1/2 tsp dried chopped tarragon, pulverized in hand just before adding -- in butter, added the wine and stirred in 1-1/2 tablespoon Ginger Preserve (marmalade-like) inspired by the Veronique recipe in Sunset Magazine's book "Cooking With Wine" which used orange marmalade to go with the grapes. Covered, simmered low. Separately saute'ed the shallot. Removed cooked chicken from pan, kept warm; Brought wine to boil & added 1/2 C non-fat "half & half" & while boiling added about 1/8 C water with 2 tsp. cornstarch dissolved in it. When thickened, stirred in the chicken, shallot, & tomatoes (which I had tumbled quickly in boiling water and peeled before starting the chicken. Not everyone is a tomato peeler, but I like them that way). This was a winner. Tomatoes and ginger go well together. Guess it wasn't really Veronique. Need a new name.

I made this recipe for my husband and myself and it was most definitely a hit. My husband even requested that I make this dish again. I did take the advice given by the cook from NJ, however I did leave out the canadian bacon. My husband did not eat the grapes, I am not sure why.. he is a bit picky... but I enjoyed them, I thought the grapes added a nice zing.

Rating: 3
I combined this recipe and my mother's old one, reduced the fat and came up with the best Chicken Veronica I've had. Make cream sauce - melt 2 t butter, add 1 T flour, slowly wisk in wine, then fat free 1/2 & 1/2. (You will be able to boil this "cream sauce" with out curdling.) Cook chicken as discribed but reduce butter to 2 t. Melt 2 t butter, lightly brown 3 oz Canadian Bacon. Add 1/3 c shallots, 5 oz sliced mushrooms and remaining tarragon, cook until mushrooms are done. Return chicken to pan, add grapes and cream sauce. Boil until heated through.

It was tasy but not what I was expecting based on the rave reviews so many people gave.

Rating: 3
Good flavor and very easy to prepare, but nothing to rave about. I doubled the recipe and also thought that 1 cup of wine left too strong of a wine flavor; next time, I will probably just use 3/4 c. Overall a good dish that I would make again, but I don't know that it is one I would serve for company.

Fabulous! Great! Oh, wow, I have so many recipes from Epicurious and this is one of my new favourites. Made it tonight with thighs, dried tarragon and half/half cream--all of which I had on hand. Houston Cook; I took Kristi's advice, removing pan from heat and slowly added cream which (only) just started to curdle. This is why this site is so great--getting the benefit of everyone's experience. Thank you! The sauce, the fragrance and the presentation were all beautiful. Best of all, sooo easy.

COOK FROM HOUSTON: I want your recipe for chicken breasts stuffed w/ goat cheese! Thanks, Susan

Rating: 3
Second time I've made this recipe and this time I added some shallots for enhanced flavor. Added a great sweetness and slightest bit of heat to the sauce. I also used only red grapes this time and liked it better than the combination red/green I had used previously. To Houston, take the pan off the heat and then add the cream. Also, it could have been that your cream was just starting to turn... I've had this happen to me a few times :)

Last night I made one of our favorites -- chicken breasts stuffed with goat cheese -- but substituted this sauce for what I usually use (some combination of capers, port, and lemon). The sauce tasted very good, but the cream curdled as soon as I poured it in the pan, and thus the texture wasn't what I'd hoped. Any suggestions? I served it with asparagus braised with lemon and parmesan, lemon-tarragon risotto, and a salad of endive, radish, avocado, and pecans, which worked very nicely together. I would like to make this dish again, but would welcome suggestions for preventing the cream from curdling (a particular wine perhaps?).

This recipe was awesome. Even my meat and potato loving husband had seconds. I doubled the recipe so with an entire cup of wine, it tasted a bit dry, next time I make it, I won't use an entire cup, maybe 3/4's. Over all, it was awesome, tasted great, amazing combination of flavors.

So, so yummy! My mother used to make this for me as a kid, and I was so excited to find a recipe for it (I always thought it was something she just made up!). At first my boyfriend turned his nose up at the idea of chicken and grapes, but he finally relented, and now it's one of his favorites!

What a wonderful aroma! My husband walked into the house and said, "Wow, does it smell good in here." I did follow my fellow cooks recommendations: more tarragon, and I added garlic. If anyone has any ideas how to make this more "heart healthy," I for one, would appreciate it. Btw, a nice pinot grigio goes wonderfully with this dish.

This was just OK at best. It starts out wonderful, but the sauce leaves something to desire. I added garlic as one cook suggested, but even so, it never met my expectations. Rather fattening for a so so dish. Perhaps a more expensive dry wine would help.

I have served this dish to guests on five occasions. Each time I was gratified at the response and the demand for copies of the recipe. When preparing this dish I double the tarragon and increase the sauce by fifty percent. I serve this dish with sliced carrots cooked in a small amount of water and flavored with brown sugar and nutmeg. Jasmine rice prepared with chicken stock and slivered almonds rounds out the meal. A really perfect desert is a medley of bite sized fruit pieces such as strawberries,cantaloupe, honeydew melon, red seedless grapes, seedless watermelon and bananas, all well chilled. Serve in chilled compotes together with a large bowl of whipped cream prepared with powdered sugar and powdered ginger but no vanilla.

This dish was just delicious! The grapes and the taragon just made the chicken so good! I used double the taragon called for and it was just sensational. I also used chicken thighs instead of breasts. My husband, who can be very picky, ate all his and stole some of mine! I took the recipe's advice and served couscous and steamed carrots. They complemented the chicken beautifully. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was a wonderful, unexpected twist on ordinary chicken. The tarragon was very aromatic and I used more than the recipe called for. A nice sauvignon blanc goes well in the sauce, as well as adding red and green grapes. This recipe impressed even the pickiest of eaters. Not to mention, it was simple to prepare. I will definitely make this again!
