I liked the PINEAPPLE as a base for a sundae, however I prepared it differently. I used canned pineapple chunks, boiled down the juice with the chunks and butter in the saucepan, then added a generous splash of dark rum, which I ignited. The CHOCOLATE sauce, however, was a waste of my time. While it did have a distinct coconut flavor when I tasted it straight from the saucepan, the effect was lost after pouring it over vanilla ice cream and the pineapple. Next time I make this recipe, which is good enough to do again (quite easy and make-ahead), I'll just use regular (jarred) hot fudge sauce. Then, I think, I'll top the sundae with toasted coconut.

Had a Jamaican themed dinner menu and these went wonderful with the menu. I would make them again if it fit with the rest of the menu.

Good flavor but I would recomend brushing the pineapple with a brown sugar and butter mixture. If grill is hot enough it will form a syrup that adds a nice flavor to the dessert.

I can't believe this has gotten such poor reviews! I allowed the sauce and pineapple topping to cool first so the ice cream didn't melt so quickly. I served it in colorful margarita glasses. I skipped the praline because I was too lazy to make it. My guests absolutely loved it and were asking for more. The pineapple was picked from my very own plant which made it extra special.

You must eat this immediately or it melts. Flavor was good, but didn't love it. Praline is very tough...like peanut brittle.
