these were great, the only thing i changed was i used All Purpose flour, i didnt pulse it i kept it all natural and just before they went in the oven to bake i put a little honey on each cake then baked them.

These are great with a bit of honey on top. They're not as sweet as store-bought Effie's Oatcakes, but they're still really tasty. Making them in the food processor is really easy too.

I needed these to accompany a Bon Appetit smoked salmon appetizer from the May '04 Scotland issue; it called for store-bought oatcakes. As noted by the prior reviewer, these indeed are a cake intended for flavorful and moist accompaniments. Would suggest forming a 'log' of dough in parchement and treating as if they were slice-and-bake cookie dough for a shortcut. Topped with home-smoked salmon, creme fraiche and caviar it will be a hit during this weekend's Highland Games and Celtic Festival party.

Scottish oatcakes are supposed to be dry and hardly sweet, you put honey on them and have them with tea. When you eat them the right way they grow on you.

These would make excellent coasters. I would also consider taking one along to balance a wobbly table in a restaurant but I wouldn't want to cause pain to any rodent or insect that might munch on it.

Zero stars. By far the worst thing on this site, the dog wouldn't even eat it! And it takes a while to make these. I guess that's just an hour of my life that I am never getting back.

Don't have a food processor so chopped oats with hand blender and a towel over the bowl. Then mixed ingredients with a pastry blender. The dough was absolutely yummy. Very simple and earthy. I halved the recipe and it made exactly 18 with the proper cutter. But then I overbaked each tray by maybe 3-5 minutes. I look forward to making them again. I used King Arthur White Whole Wheat flour, a lighter whole wheat flour. Nonetheless, they are dark enough that I'm not sure how exactly they are supposed to turn golden brown. Even being a trifle overbaked, mine really didn't turn golden. I'm topping mine with ginger spiced fig preserves and/or salty Smithfield ham.
