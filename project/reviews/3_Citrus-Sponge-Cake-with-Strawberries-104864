I agree-too dry. I was out of town and had to make a sponge cake and left more usual recipe at home. I won't make this one again either

I bake quite often and I will not be making this cake again. It looks nice and has a tasty subtle flavor but it is TOO DRY. It is a bit eggy but has a nice scent and springy feel. It most certainly needs the sauce which instantly gets sucked up by the cake. I really wanted to like this cake more, but there are better sponge cakes and better Passover cakes out there. 4 of us tested it (all very good cooks and bakers) and all agreed that the recipe was NOT a keeper.

This was the first sponge cake that I have made that didn't fall in the middle. The directions are very easy and the results great! I received alot of compliments.
