Will be making this weekend but one tip I can provide even though I haven't made it is: Every strong cheese (bleu, roquefort, gorgonzola) can be strong, salty, or mild and sweet. If you're concerned and don't want to spend the $$, go to a higher end market that will let you taste cheeses. Many average markets carry the same brands but don't let you taste. Know before you buy. Some cheeses are like wine, you have to grow a palate to enjoy them.

So easy and delicious! Made mainly as written, except the cheese part, and did not measure herbes de provence (I was probably more generous). Saved half the sauce before adding cheese for hubby and friend that do not like Roquefort and they said it was still great. I did not measure how much Roquefort I used, but don't think it was quite as much as called for and was plenty yummy. One note: I used a nonstick skillet and ended up feeling the need to pour off the oil from the sauce at the end before serving. Also left off chives garnish. Served with long grain and wild rice and corn on the cob.

I found the roquefort too strong. I used only about half the amount of cheese and I liked the sauce better without it. I'm keeping the recipe just to make the cream sauce minus the roquefort. The herb de provence sauce tasted awesome alone.

A very tasty, easy-but-elegant meal. The sauce was a perfect blend of the richness of the Roquefort and the tang of the garlic. A "week day" effort with a "special occasion" result!

The sauce was very flavorful, if a bit salty for my taste. It could have been the cheese though! The herbes de Provence make a nice statement.

I used pounded boneless chicken breasts and it worked well. SO quick!

Am I the only one that found 5 cloves of garlic to be too much? I pressed them through a garlic press and could still feel the presence of actual pieces of garlic, there was so much of it. Otherwise the recipe was delicious (and I used milk instead of cream).

I halved this recipie and my only deviation was not adding all the cheese (and had to use gorgonzola instead). It was delicious with roasted potatoes on the side. Next time I might cut down a bit more on the cheese as it is very strong! Easy, fast and tasty.

I LOVED this recipe. I followed it exactly and thought the flavor was delicious. I served it with steamed spinach. I made it for my husband and for my parents the following week. Everyone raved.

Made with Saga blue cheese, thought it was bland, and the chicken was gloppy. Probably better with the roquefort, and I would cook the chicken in the oven to keep it crisp.

Got raves using boneless breasts and gorgonzola. Easy and good ; a keeper.

This recipe is fantastic. My boyfriend and I have made it many times over, and it's just wonderful. Also, we've tried making the dish with less expensive rich blue cheeses, and they've worked just as well. Not a light dish, however. :)

This was an excellent chicken recipe. I used half and half instead of the cream and it was still very rich and flavorful. I also substitued boneless chicken breasts and a mild blue cheese. I didn't find it too salty, but I think it depends on the cheese used. The sauce was also wonderful on mashed potatoes. I would even serve this to company.

I used milk instead of cream, feta instead of roquefort, and thyme. It was easy and yummy and will enter our rep.

This was just fabulous! I made this for the first time last night. I used boneless chicken. I didn't have herbes de provence, so I used thyme. For the roquefort, I used a 4 ounce block of Treasure Cave Bleu Cheese and it was definitely enough. The sauce is rich like others said, but it is creamy and tastes heavenly! Served with mashed potatoes, though I think fettucine would work great, too. Will definitely serve this again and for company, too!

I guess I'm just not a fan of Roquefort.

I absolutely mutilated this recipe, and it was still fabulous! I used boneless breasts, red wine (all I had), 1% milk and Irish cashel cheese. However, my herbes de Provence were from Paris. Wonderful! Delicious!

Wow! this was delicious. I used organic whole milk instead of the whipping cream, and it was fantastic, with the perfect consistency. I also used skinless, boneless chicken breasts and browned them in butter, rather than oil. Served with Mashed potatoes. My husband and I both loved it. Next time, I will double the sauce.

This dish was absolutely fabulous and easy to make. I am making it two weekends in a row for guests. Last week I added a few chopped walnuts to the sauce at the end, and this week I am going to add some chopped pistacios. The nuts finish off the dish and make the sauce (for some reason) seem more complex and interesting.

This was a super recipe. I followed all the suggestions below, and served with a nice spring vegatable risotto. Definately a make again.

Fantastic. I can't speak to the problem of the cheese being too salty, as I ended up not having quiet as much cheese as asked for - but it was still divine. I baked chicken thighs and then just served the sauce on top.

This was delicious but way too rich. i used 2/3 whipping cream and 1/3 2% milk and still it was so rich. Next time i will also cut down on the Roquefort. It was overwhelming Roquefort-y. i served the chicken and sauce over pasta, but unfortunately a lot of the pasta went uneaten because it was too drenched with the sauce. The dish has great flavor, just need some tinkering in my opinion.

Very simple, very quick, very delicious! Will serve to guests, however it is extremely rich. We poured the sauce over the chicken AND mashed potatoes. Decadent.

This was very easy & quite good. Definitely drain the grease before adding the liquids. We used half-n-half to "cut down" on the fat. Taking advice from other reviewers, we served it "family style" over rotini AND steamed spinach (layered). Also, we let the chicken cool and deboned it. Great!

Really excellent, after making it the first time, I was inspired to throw a dinner party to share it with my friends - all of whom liked it. I made a much larger quantity of sauce (it all got eaten).

A really tasty recipe, delicious over pasta. My husband prepared it and found it very quick. Two substitutions: Canned chicken stock for the white wine, evaporated skip milk for the whipping cream. We'll definitely prepare this again.

This has become a favorite of mine!! Green beans are great served with it because the sauce is so delicious on them too... I always make sure to have a baguette for dipping in the left-over sauce.Yum!!

We didn't have roquefort so I used blue cheese & served it over linguini. We didn't have a problem with it being too salty.

One of my favorite easy recipes! Is great served over a bed of lightly steamed spinach!

Okay recipe. Quite salty. As a previous reviewer notes, less roquefort may be the trick.

I would make this again, except maybe use less cheese - it tends to be a little salty. Other than that - it was AMAZING!

Excellent dish. Used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and it turns out very well. Have made this several times and everybody adores it. We serve it over pasta.
