Added 1/2 tsp of wasabi powder to the mayo - awesome!

very tasty, but it needs a little more zip. The arctic char is a perfect foil and the scallions are spicy but i would like to add some dashi or other japanese flavors. It IS super easy and a good crowd pleaser but I'm going to play with it next time I make it.

This is the first time I felt strongly enough about a recipe to write a review. This dish was excellent! As a bonus, preparation couldn't have been easier and the cleanup was a breeze!

I made this using a single, large piece of char to serve 5-6 people. As a result, I had to cook it for more than twice as long as the recipe suggested for individual pieces, but it was wonderful! A very quick, delicious, weeknight dish.

I use this on char as well as salmon, grouper ... anything really. Also, I grill the fish. Simple, quick, tasty.

So easy and delicious! I also added 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese which added tremendously to the flavor. I bet this would be great on a heartier fish as well. Served with a Greek style orzo and broccoli.

Wow is right! This was totally delicious. I got the closest thing I could to Arctic Char at my fishmonger, which was a coldwater trout. I didn't have mayonnaise, because I don't like it (but give it a French name, and it's wonderful), so I made a quick aioli with olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and an egg yolk. A few scallions and the aioli, a mere 3 minutes under the broiler, and it was like fish Welsh Rarebit! I couldn't believe how good it was and seemingly very rich and satisfying! This is a new favorite for sure.

Wow was this good and so easy! I didn't have scallions in the house so I used some freeze-dried shallots from Penzeys and it was amazing! I will definitely make this again! I served with champagne, petite green beans and roasted fingerling potatoes with sea salt and pepper!
