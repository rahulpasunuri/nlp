As others have said, not too impressive. I made them without reading the reviews, because I was trying to find recipes that would use up a surfeit of rice flour. The taste was good with the chili pepper, it was the texture I found disappointing. I was hoping for that great chewiness you normally get with Chinese scallion pancakes.

I agree with the Cook from Aruba. I was really excited to make what are called "Chinese Pizzas" at my local Chinese place, but these were exactly like regular pancakes. Too doughy, even with the addition of rice flour.

Never again. I had hoped these would be the scallion pancakes I used to eat at a NYC Chinese restaurant. We used to call them Chinese pizzas because of the way it was served. These things were more like traditional pancakes w/o sugar.

Kind of blah. Good dipping sauce, though.

Fantastic! I made these for our Holiday food extravaganza this weekend. They were super easy. The rice flour can be found at an Asian market. I doubled the recipe b/c we had 37 people attending. They were a hit!

Less than exited with outcome--wasn't bad, but was fairly plain.
