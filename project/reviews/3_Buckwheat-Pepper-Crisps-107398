I made these today using a commercial convection oven. I like them crisp so I baked them about 18 min. I made a double batch. The first ones I spooned per directions the second batch I spread on a baking sheet and scored with a pizza cutterhalf way through baking I scored them again. You can make various sizes this way. I also let them cool right on the baking sheet. Just wanted to share

I was excited to try this recipe but was a bit disapointed with the results. They smelled really good coming out of the oven but I found that they were bland for my taste. I think if I make these again, next time I would add some dried herbs like rosemary and maybe garlic to add some flavor.

This recipe (verbatim, appropriate credit given to the source) was used in a cooking class I attended yesterday. I liked the crisps so much I made them again today at home. Since the date of the previous reviews was just after the recipe was published in Gourmet in late 2002, I assume that there is very little likelihood my review will see the light of day. Ah well. Here is what I learned from both yesterday's and today's efforts. First of all, the size of the crisp can vary quite a bit, as long as you keep all the crisps on one pan the same size due to the varying baking times. Put the same amount on for each crisp on the pan, but spread it out thicker or thinner depending on your personal preference. I liked them spread very thin (which makes a bigger crisp), and it baked to about the thickness of a potato chip. Crisp as could be, too! One of my cooking class colleagues preferred them a little thicker, so she spread hers out to be about the diameter of a Ritz cracker. It made for a thicker crisp, but still crisp enough to be very good. Either size would work well. One thing that made a big difference was making sure you allow the milk and egg to reach room temperature before mixing, plus allow the butter to soften for at least an hour. I made it in the blender, and the class teacher said that was essential, but for the life of me I can't see why a good hand mixer wouldn't work as well. I was a good girl and followed directions explicitly. Last note: Bake these on sheets of parchment paper. There is no need for cooking spray at all. They came off the paper nicely. On the baking sheets where we used cooking spray, there was more breakage. It isn't impossible with cooking spray, just requires a bit more finesse. This recipe could be used for company, but we will probably chow down on them with peppered boursin and a glass of nice vino tonight.

The fresh crisps are delicious. Mine too went soggy/leathery after a day. I put them back in the oven at 350F for 5 minutes on a pizza stone and they were revitalized. The crisps are great with cracked pepper Boursain cheese.

These were very good and went well as suggested with champagne. I stored them as recommended but they were soggy and stale the next day. Any suggestions?
