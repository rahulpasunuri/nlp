Added a bit of finely grated lemon peel to the crust, but other wise, followed the recipe. This capped off a nice summer evening with friends dininf al fresco, served with fresh blackberries on the plate. Deelish.

This recipe was a big hit. The lemon flavor really comes thrdinnerSince I had to travel i had bruleed the top about four hours before it was served but the topping had lost its crispiness by then. Next time I'll brulee the top during dinner.

Was just okay - I made it for a party and it just received a lukewarm response. The lemon creme brulee with berries is much better!!

Great recipe! I've entered it in a pie auction to raise money for the community center for three years running and each time it was a winner!!! I definitely agree that a torch is the way to finish the top. I did find recently that it must be served soon after torching or the brulee melts back into soft sugar. Also, a piece of parchment on the bottom will allow you to keep your tart pan bottom at home. The pie weights are very a helpful idea, and yes, I agree that it takes longer to bake the shell than what is recommended. I'm making another for a gathering this weekend. Love it!

Fabulous! Made this yesterday to great reviews. Found the broiler was great for browning the center of the cake but needed to use a butane lighter to brown the edges of the sugar well. Made the dough a couple weeks back and froze it. Having the dough on hand made this a very quick & impressive dessert to throw together!

I made this in mini-tartlet pans and used pie weights as suggested by other reviewers. I skipped the egg white step and didn't notice any difference. A nice elegant dessert. Raspberries and whip cream make a nice touch...

Fabulous spring/summer dessert and while I've struggled with traditional creme brulee in the past, I had no problem achieving a perfect layer of crunchy caramelized sugar on the surface, by just using the broiler. Now two words of advice on preparation. First, I would advise placing the crust on a baking sheet PRIOR to pouring the filling in. Makes it much easier to get into the oven without making a big sloppy mess. Secondly, I would suggest covering the crust with a ring of foil prior to broiling to prevent the crust from burning. Otherwise, this is a most impressive and easy dessert recipe. Fresh summer berries and maybe a spoon of whipped cream are a must alongside.

Crust needs to be weighted down and then baked a little longer than recipe specifies. Filling and topping are terrific.

I've made this several times now, and it is always a big success. I cut down the amount of lemon a bit to make it less tangy but still with character, and have shared the recipe many times.

This was okay. Not particularly outstanding, but truly lemony. Lack of enthusiasm may result from side by side comparison with the best coconut cream and banana cream pie served at Easter. this seemed dull in comparison.

Has anyone used small individual tart pans instead of the single large one for this recipe? If so, should the oven temp and baking time be adjusted?

This is my second year making this for Easter. My family LOVED it. I actually used ready made roll out crust because I had too many other things to prepare, but it worked fine. I served it with big fat curls of zest and edible flowers on top. I am making two this year so people can have seconds.

I don't understand the lukewarm reviews--I think this tart has everything going for it--it's easy to make and it is delicious. I've made it twice and both times people raved about it. Once I chilled the dough overnight, nce for a couple of hours--both were excellent and easy to work with. Using Meyers lemons really helps, I think, and I left out the grated peel, going for the true Creme feel. I'm making it--for the third time in as many weeks--for a dinner group this weekend. Of course, I also really like playing with my new toy--the kitchen torch I got for Christmas!

I enjoyed making this dish and everyone who tasted it thought it was wonderful. I chilled the dough overnight and it turned out wonderfully. The filling was a little runny in the middle. I think I'll have to adjust the baking time a little. And I will try the torch next time too, the broiler did an uneven job.

Just the right amount of tartness but I found that I had to cook it quite a bit longer than suggested.

Rating: 3
Overall, a good dessert. The crust was good, but not great. I also cooked the crust longer as I like a crunchier texture rather than a doughy one. The filling was perfect. I omitted the lemon zest and added an extra tablespoon of juice. Love that lemon flavor!

This recipe will please tart and brulee fans alike. I cut back on the lemon juice, only using about 1/3c., and found it to still be very tangy. The brulee formed perfectly in the shell, without the hassle of usual creme brulee making. Definitely a keeper!

Rating: 2
I agree with a couple of the other reviews- this is more of a tart than a brulee. I expected much more creaminess and overall a better outcome from a recipe with such great reviews. I have a lemon bar recipe that tastes the same if not better and is a lot less work. This is tasty, but I will stick to the lemon bars if I need a lemony dessert.

Fantastic tart! I made this for a BBQ and everyone loved it. Only thing I would do different is carmelize the sugar with a torch and maybe use only 1 tbsp. Broiler seemed to brown very unevenly.

I've made this tart for 2 casual dinner parties and it has been a great success both times. Light, refreshing and lemony - and not a single change or modification to the recipe is needed! Both times, I have begun the carmelizing under the broiler, but finished it off with the torch. Perfect!

Excellent! For those who have problems with lemon peel bits (like me), they can use what I consider the dangerous part of the cheese grater if they have it - the prickley, almost unusable side. Flavor perfection, savory smoothness.

Took this to a dessert night and received rave reviews. Very lemony and creamy and smooth, and refreshing and bright in late winter. You could get away with a key lime pie for less trouble and the same lip-smacking tartness, but in that case, you don't get to play with the kitchen torch...

This was a wonderfully light and summer-y dessert. I definitely recommend the blow torch. A previous reviewer was correct in stating that the broiler heats the entire tart. This is delicious!

I have not made this yet, but plan to this weekend. This is to a previous reviewer, you can use lemon oil instead of peel, about a 1/4 t per T lemon peel, or to taste. My son does not care for the peel bits and I do this often with baked goods. Williams-Sonoma carries it.

I've made this several times as a creme brulee. I highly recommend using Meyer lemons; their mild lemon flavor complements the creaminess of the filling without overwhelming it. This recipe is worth getting a kitchen blowtorch for -- using a broiler will heat up the whole tart instead of just carmelizing the topping. I think that the finely grated lemon peel detracts from the smooth texture you usually expect in a creme brulee, so here's what I did: peel the Meyer lemons in long strips, then add them to the cream, heat gently, and allow the peel to steep in the cream for a while. Strain them out when adding the cream to the recipe, and strain the entire mixture again when pouring in the pan -- this will keep out lumps of egg that may curdle while cooking. Also, I bake in a water bath at about 340 degrees so that egg doesn't cook too quickly. The last time I added raspberries. Beautiful and delicious!!!

Good for a lemon tart-but not a creme brulee. The filling was not nearly smooth enough. I have memories of a lemon creme brulee tart served at Spago long ago (before it moved)that was heavenly. Directions for the use of the egg white are also bit misleading. I misread and though it was to be done during the baking process-which seemed to make the puffing and shrinking worse. Even with all of this it is a very tasty dessert, just not the winner I was hoping for.

Well, I didn't actually make this...my Mom made it for my birthday. I must say it was one of the best, most refreshing desserts I've ever tasted! I love lemon ...but it was not overwhelming...it was PERFECT!! She broiled the top (no torch) and it looked beautiful!! I will MOST DEFINITELY make this one! Thanks MOM!!!!

I made this for a small casual get together and got great compliments. The lemon taste was fantastic. I would recommend a torch as opposed to the broiler as I found it too easy to burn the sugar under the broiler.

Extremely good recipe. While caramelizing the pie you really have to cover the edges, otherwise the edges will defenitely turn black! One tbsp of sugar is enough to caramelize it. No need to change anything about the recipe.

Rating: 4
Definately a keeper! Easy to follow recipe with flexibility in technique. I sifted the flour and powdered sugar before measuring. Needed 6 tsp. of whipping cream for the crust. Did not chill; rolled dough to fit an 11" tart pan. (there was not enough dough for overhand; single thickness sides). Baking produced minor bubbling which was handled with the back of a fork as directed in recipe. Did not use the carmelized topping. The end result was a light, refreshing, luncheon desert serving 12.

Rating: 4
Great both times I've made and served it. One time I used a small kitchen torch with good results on the sugar toasting. When I used the broiler, it heated up the whole tart more, and I wasn't as happy about that...I prefer the contrast of the warm crunchy topping and the cold lemon custard below. YUM! It may become one of my regular signature desserts because it is showy but real easy.

leaves out important steps. Not enough dough to hold the filling. Have to watch it like a hawk so it doesn't bubble up and over the sides of the pan. Baking time is wrong (or at least varies)

This was just so-so. I was expecting more of a creamy texture, like traditional crème brulée, but instead the cream curdled with all the lemon juice. Better off making a lemon meringue if you like tart and sweet desserts.

I saw this and HAD to make it. It's as if it was created just for me. My favorite cooking partner had the same reaction, and both of us loved it. Her husband was in charge of serving, and gave us each two slices because he knew how much we would love it after tasting it himself. We thought there wasn't enough cream in the crust at first, but it was fine.

Rating: 3
I made the dough the old-fashioned way using a pastry blender and needed alot more whipping cream than the 4 teaspoons in the recipe (it did say or more). Perhaps that is why the crust turned into a shapeless raised blob as soon as I put it into the oven. I was able to save it by putting a smaller pie plate over it and pressing it back into shape. I left the pan there until the crust was firm enough to hold its shape, but then had to increase the heat to get it to brown. Surprising, it turned out fine.

I made this recipe with Meyer Lemons, and without a crust, as a conventional Creme Brulee in Ramekins. The crust was a little too much for me so next time I'll use less sugar. But the taste was terrific! These lemons were wonderful in this dessert.

This was a wonderfully light dessert that will compliment many dinner parties to come. I found that using the broiler worked well, but a torch will help in keeping the crust from browning that extra little bit when making the brulee. Enjoy!

One of the best tarts I've made and I've made many of them! loved the lemon flavor. Used a 10 inch pan and it came out great. My guests ate it all up. I broiled the top and it was fine. I didn't think there was too much sugar but, maybe that's because of the larger pan. A keeper for sure!

This was incredibly easy to make... I agree about blind baking -- it was good advice. I also had extra filling but not a huge amount because of the blind baking. It was a nice and light tasting dessert.

I didn't make the crust, as I had one in the fridge, but I'll try it next time (and there definitely will be a next time!). This was incredibly easy, and really good! I too, used a torch for the top, and although I heeded the reviews, and only used 1 1/2 T. sugar, I'll up it to the full amount next time. I like the crunch of a solid top on my creme brulee. Thank you for a great recipe.

Rating: 3
A fine dessert. Very light, but I wouldn't want to know how many calories are in a serving.... Two tablespoons of sugar resulted in a rather thick coating. I, too, would blind-bake the crust (which was very tasty) next time as I had about 1/2 cup extra filling (which went into a ramekin and water bath and baked alongside the tart). Shameless product plug: King Arthur Flour sells a bag in which you can roll out pie crusts without the mess...worked very well with this crust.

Rating: 4
Thought this was very good. 3.75 forks. Next time would use pie weights- as the crust began to bake, the edges slid down a bit, and so I was unable to use the full amount of filling. It was still excellent. I agree with a prior review that a shortbread crust might be better. Used turbinado sugar and a torch.

This was great! We saw it on the cover and made it the same night. I didn't read the instructions prior, so we were on the fast track. Two hours in the fridge for the crust, put it together, baked. We put it in the freezer to cool for 20 minues and then brulee'd the top. Four adults and four kids ate it up! YUM! I have made it twice since...always the same way!

I thought this was great, I made it for Easter, chilled the dough overnight, had no problem rolling it out. Sprinkled on a Turbino sugar and used a blow torch, I didn't want to have to deal with putting foil on the crust. I loved it, so did everyone else. It was not to sweet, nice and lemony.

I guess I wasn't the only one who made this for Easter! Actually, I didn't have a problem rolling out the crust, probably because I kept the dough in the refrigerator overnight, instead of the two-hour minimum. Since I've had bad luck rolling out pastry crusts in the past, the overnight chill definitely helped. Regarding the topping, I, too, would recommend less sugar -- and probably less time under the broiler. I checked after 1 minute, and wound up pulling it out because parts were already getting overdone. The recipe's directions to cover the edges with foil are right on target. That having been said, the tart was absolutely delicious! As someone who's had bad luck with pastries in the past, I felt positively triumphant savoring this dish! And I didn't feel like I had to work overly hard for the results, either.
