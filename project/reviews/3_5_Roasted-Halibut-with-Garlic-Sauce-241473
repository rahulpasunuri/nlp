Delicious. We made our own mayonnaise. Next time we will sear the halibut quickly, and then spread with sauce and finish in the oven.

i made this in 15 minutes with an extra piece of halibut i had from the night before. superquick, supereasy, and decently tasty enough.

Rating: 3
Bottom line up front: very tasty and easy-to-make, pairs well with roasted asparagus and green salad, a recipe I'll make again. To the printed recipe, I added capers (but not too many, as they can be so salty), lemon juice, and a small squirt of sriracha sauce. The result was tasty without overpowering the fish.

Rating: 2
Not much to rave about but at the same time not a complete loss. The mayo sauce definitely needs something like the other reviewers have states. Capers, lemon, herbs maybe? Not really sure.

Rating: 3
A great, simple recipe! Benefits from broiling for the last minute or two.

Rating: 1
This was really bad. I added lemon, parley, a bit of capers, a bit of parm just like readers suggested. Used fresh tilapia, baked then broiled the last two minutes. Tasted super funky. I usually agree with the reviewers, but I have to disagree with this one. Will definitely NOT make again.

I enjoyed this a lot. Added some fresh lemon juice to freshen it up. In general, a very quick, simple, and flavorful recipe.

Very easy and versatile. I have made this many times, adding whatever I had on hand to the mayo.....green olives, capers, black olives, sundried tomatoes, roasted red peppers, diced canned artichoke. The fish is always moist and flavorful.

I also added the cilantro and one tbls. of rinsed capers. I didn't have lemon juice, so I added the juice of 1/2 lime to one lb. of fish. My husband was raving about it!

I found this recipe very underwhelming, there is a spice or two missing, adding parmesean, lemon and parsley might help it - but very bland.

Excellent and beyond easy, my whole family loved it! I did add about a tablespoon of lemon juice to the mixture, like others suggested.

The strong point of this recipe is in the simplicity of ingredients - usually readily available at home. I added some lemon juice to the garlic and some parmesan sprinkled on top. I finished the cooking by broiling the fish for 2-3 min. Very nice and easy :-)

I like the simplicity of the recipe. Adding something to the recipe as the other reviewers say is necessary. I added a 1/3 cup of finely chopped cilantro which was great. I kept the 3 cloves of garlic for 1lb. of Halibut and it was overpowering. Next time: lightly salt the bottom of the steaks, and perhaps roast the garlic previous to making the aioli.

Rating: 2
This wasn't my favorite dish. This could be in part because I typically buy salmon and halibut (or at least the portion I bought) seems so much milder in flavor. The piece of fish I bought was about 1/2 pound, I cut the mayo and olive oil in half, but kept the garlic at 3 cloves (I am a fan of garlic). Overall I just felt like everything was kind of blah...Even my garlic seemed less potent than normal. The fish was perfectly cooked and moist, but just lacking something and, in my opinion, wasn't worth the expense of the halibut. I might try this again and make some changes, but I don't see myself doing that any time in the near future.

Rating: 4
Supper easy and pretty much fail proof. Other items can be added to the mayo....olives, marinated artichokes, grilled red peppers....just about anything that is drained and diced.

Rating: 3
We enjoyed this. I added the kalamata olives as well and found that it really enhanced the dish. I recommend making extra sauce to serve over your vegetable. Served with spinach salad and asparagus.

Rating: 4
I'm always looking for ways to add a little flavor to fresh fish, and this was just my speed. Add some lemon juice to the aioli and it doubles as a killer sauce for asparagus, which can be roast alongside the halibut. Yum!

Rating: 2
I can't blame the result solely on the recipe but my halibut was FISHY. Bought at Costco, froze what we didn't use - have done this before. I ALWAYS soak fish in salt water for 15 minutes and that usually takes care of the fishiness - didn't this time. Anyway, the result this time was not saved by the recipe so but FRESH fish.

I added black olives and a little hot pepper sauce. Very nice. I will make again.

I plan on making this tonight and after reading reviews and saw many who were questioning the mayo, just want to comment that I use another SIMPLE recipe on this site where all I do is cover fish in mayo before BBQ and always turns out great,(juicy and tender)so I'm looking forward to trying this simular oven version.

Rating: 4
After reading the reviews, I made the recipe following some of the suggestions. I sauted the garlic in 1TB of oil, minced some kalamatas and capers and mixed it with the mayo. As a final touch I gave a light sprinkle of parmasan to the top and a short time under the broiler at the end of the cooking cycle. It was wonderful.

This is a good recipe although next time I will prepare this with roasted garlic and apply sauce a little less liberally. I usually always enjoy garlic but felt it over powered the dish.

Tasty and easy to make. I make pork chops with a similar topping. Like other reviewers, I added some lemon zest to the mayo mix and sprinkled some freshly grated parmesan on top.

Fantastic! Perfectly flakey and moist! Took advice from others and roasted garlic, added lemon zest and juice, lowfat mayo. also roasted tomatos halves as a side with garlic, basil, oregano, olive oil, topped with parmesan. roasted all for about 10 min then broiled for 2. yum

This was yummy!! I did not skin the fish and used reduced fat mayo. I also browned the top a little using the broiler. Will definitely make again.

Rating: 4
It seems that the easiest recipes and simplest preparation yield some of the best meals - this recipe is a classic example of that. Just by itself though, it is a bit simple in presentation. An easy presentation improvement is the diced tomatoes from the other reviewer, but I also sprinkled some fresh basil that had been julienned.

Rating: 3
This was pretty good - I did not feel it got golden enough in the oven - so after about 12 minutes I put it in a non-stick frying pan and browned it up on both sides - after that it was very good. Still moist in the middle with a nice crisp outer coat.

Awesome!! I took another reviewer's recommendation and used roasted garlic and added cilantro. So easy and guests loved it.

I made this pretty much as directed but added lemon zest to the mayo mixture and put it under the broiler for a couple of minutes towards the end to give it a bit of color. Very moist and tasty. I will make this again.

This was very quick and easy to make. I used less aioli than called for and I am glad that I did because I was afriad that it would be too oily. I also hit the aioli with a little hot sauce and lemon. Very tasty!

This is an excellent weeknight recipe, for those weeknights you want to feel pampered with minimal effort. Very easy, very quick, and the aioli mixture keeps the halibut moist and tasty.

We love garlic. So, I roast a garlic head on the oven and I mix it with the mayo, it was very, very good!

Tried to make this recipe with homemade mayonnaise. Do not try to make mayonnaise unless you are very patient.

Rating: 4
I am not a fan of mayonnaise, but after reading the glowing reviews for this unusual recipe, I decided to try it. I only painted about half the sauce on the fish--it just seems like too much--and it was tender and absolutely delicious. Of course, very fresh fish is a must!

Rating: 2
I too, would have skipped over this one, but dared try it due to the forks. My family liked it, but, my 12 year old hit it on the head when she said, "...but it tastes fatty, or greasy or something." So, yes, it was good, but it was kind of a waste of a healthy meal.

Rating: 4
I very rarely make or eat fish, but wanted to try preparing halibut. This recipe ROCKS! So easy and the fish was moist and tender. I added diced jalapenos and chopped cilantro to the mayo sauce and it was great! I tend to like my food on the spicy side. Will definintely make again and serve for a dinner party!

Rating: 4
Frankly, this sounded pretty funky, but after reading the reviews and not having much time to make dinner, I decided to give it a try. The fish was moist and absolutely delicious. I think this sauce would also be great on chicken tenderloins. I added extra garlic (because that's how we roll) and made closer to 2 lbs. of fish. Next time I'd make a bit more sauce. Some of the fillets were thin, so the sauce was spread out further...but it was surprisingly good overall...and EASY! Will definitely make again.

I have a friend who's husband is a fisherman in Alaska; we used FRESH halibut and it was the BEST I have ever tasted! Even the 2 eleven year old girls at the table had seconds! Excellent!! Thank you Danny & Tammy!

I hate to say it, but unlike most of the other reviewers, I found this recipe to be very average. The fish tasted like garlicky mayonaisse - YUCK! It also looked very "white" and bland. Definitely would not waste expensive halibut on this recipe again.

Rating: 4
Awesome! I've made this twice now. The first time exactly as written. Yum. Tonight, I made it as written, but after baking (roasting?) it and tranferring it to a platter, I topped the halibut with 2 chopped tomatoes that had been lightly sauteed in butter with scallions and fresh basil and parsley. (I had to use up those tomatoes.) Wow. If you could give it 5 forks...!

Rating: 4
As previous viewers stated they would have passed this if it weren't for the fork rating. I too am guilty. Made this last night and it was AWESOME!!!! Hubby loved it too and said it was the best Halibut he had ever have. Moist, flavorful, not greasy. Really amazing and EASY.

Rating: 4
Like someone else said, at first glance, I would have left this recipe alone if it hadn't been for the fork rating. It was really, really good. My husband loved it. Definitely a terrific under 20 minute preparation, and I'll be doing this on weeknights until we can't stand it anymore.

Rating: 4
I use halibut cheeks for this recipe. I can buy them flash-frozen from my market, so this becomes an easy-breezy weeknight dinner. Two cheeks per person (or three for my darling husband when he's extra hungry), and the ingredients for the sauce are in the pantry/fridge.

I have done this one before, but what makes it even better is mixing parmesean or romano cheese with bread crumbs all over the top of the mayo. Yum! I also think you should use a less flavorful fish rather than the halibut. I use cod or orange roughy to cover with mayo or dijon mustard, the halibut and sea bass and mahi mahi get lemon and a grill!

If you have fresh halibut do not spoil it with this recipe. Just staem the halibut and serve with a little melted butter. Use a cheaoer fish for this recipe. Cod, haddock or farmed salmon would work well.

Rating: 0
I make a variation of this. I use the same amount of mayo, add about same amount of Thai sweet chili sauce, a bit of lemon juice, around 1/3 cup of chopped cilantro and some finely sliced green onions. I mix it together well, then spread over the fish and bake as this recipe calls for. Fish is done in same time period, always is very tasty and very moist, never dries out this way.

Rating: 4
Loved this dish - easy to make, full of flavor, great eye appeal. Paired it with broccoli sauteed in olive oil, garlic and red pepper flakes as well as a simple green salad with craisins and non-fat feta cheese. Excellent for an elegant dinner party or a family mid-week meal.

I used to make this recipe in a tiny cafe in New Haven, Ct about 35 years ago. The only difference was that I used yoghurt instead of the mayo. It kept it moist, added less fat, and kept to the theme of the Israeli restaurant I was working in.

Don't waste your expensive halibut on this one! We catch our own, but I still feel bad that I wasted a perfectly good halibut filet. This was horrible. Maybe if the garlic had been roasted off before adding to the sauce. Please people don't ruin your halibut by putting mayonaise on it! This was just gross!

Our power was out yesterday so I had to quickly figure out what I was going to do with the haddock in the fridge. I remembered that this recipe had caught my eye, so I put together the sauce (so great - the kind of stuff you'll always have in the house) and cooked it on the grill instead of roasting it. It was an absolutely wonderful meal, against all odds.

I wasn't crazy about this one. Although the mayo sauce helped keep the fish moist, it coagulated on top...not very asthetically pleasing.

Awesome... I always get kudos for making halibut this way! On occasion, I will add parmesan cheese, freshly graded, fully covering the top before baking. (A little something my parents taught me) Always Amazing& And very easy on time and prep. Enjoy...

Easy and delicious. I made the double chocolate parfaits on p.47 in under an hour, then turned the page and made this recipe. The sweet potatoes went in first, the fish next, and while the fish cooked I made sauteed spinach. An excellent dinner all around.

Terrific. This is a very fast gourmet meal, and I think you can use almost any fish. I made it once with orange roughy filets (cook for less time with filets)and once with sea bass steaks. So moist and flavorful!

Fantastic! Very easy to fix. I couldn't find halibut, so I substituted haddock. It came out beautifully - light and delicious. I made it for my mother, and she has already asked me to make it again.
