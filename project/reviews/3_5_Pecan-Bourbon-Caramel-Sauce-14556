Served over vanilla bean ice cream. Pistachios/brandy instead of bourbon/pecans...Decadent.

Blech! Maybe it was the cheap bourbon, but this was so bitter and the combination of bouron and lemon just turned my stomach. Would be much better to substitute some cinnamon and sour cream for the bourbon and lemon.

Lemon juice is used to keep the sugar from crystalizing. You can omit it if you want but for "first-timers" it would be better to leave it in.

Caramelising sugar is fine for novices - it is not for the impatient. This is an easy and delicious recipe. I love it over ice cream and peaches.

Easy to do! Substituted walnuts for pecans with good result. Terrific served warm over ice cream; can imagine it would be great on baked apples too!

Carmelizing sugar is not for novices - I burned the first batch. I don't like pecans, so I subsituted vanilla for the lemon juice and omitted the nuts. Outstanding!!

This was a great recipe. I made this as part of Christmas gift baskets and it turned out wonderfully. Definitly will make again!

Made this sauce as a hostess gift and promptly made some more for myself. It makes a very rich, and very grown-up, sundae, atop some vanilla ice cream.
