This delicious cake is my husband's favorite -- I bake it in loaf pans and serve it without the frosting.

This cake is wonderful! The frosting is divine! I am not sure why previous reviewers said this cake was dense. It is exceptionally light. I would imagine they either didn't sift the cake flour or used a different flour instead of cake flour. Do try this cake. You won't regret it.

The cake itself is very good, has a light spice flavor,but not much of a lemon "punch". The frosting, however is to die for! It would probably make dog food tasty!

This recipe is a total gem, with one exception: the 4 3/4 cups powdered sugar in the frosting. I'd advise to start with less than a cup and add small amounts until you get the desired sweetness. If you make this adjustment (and possibly increase the lemon zest and add in some fresh grated ginger), it will be a baffling achievement. Tears will be shed over the delicacy of the crumb (be sure to use cake flour), the perfect pairing of lemon and spice. You will be the star of whatever party you grace with the presence of this cake.

The cake had a great flavor but it was also incredibly dense. So, depending on your desire, this could be a great cake or a disappointment. I used a different frosting because I needed to, not because I wanted to. So, next time I will try this frosting.

I followed the advice of the baker who suggested less sugar, fresh ginger, etc. The cake and frosting were both delicious in taste, but the frosting--with 1 1/4C less sugar than recommended was a disaster. It "curdled" and separated and while the taste was terrific, it looked awful. Do you suppose it was due to less sugar? Any ideas on how to avoid this? Thanks.

I made this recipe as 2 dozen cupcakes, doubling the lemon juice and zest. I found the cupcakes to be extremely dry, so I injected with lemon curd - delicious and moist!! Next time, I'll brush with lemon juice after baking as suggested by others. The frosting was fantastic - I adjusted as follows: 8 oz cream cheese, 3/4 cup butter, 3T lemon juice, 3 t zest, 1 t vanilla and 3-1/2 cups 10X sugar. They freeze beautifully even when frosted.

I made this cake for a bridal shower and it was a hit. per other suggestions, i cut the sugar (used 1.25 cups) and increased the peel (x3) and lemon juice (x2). also omitted the cinnamon. the recipe also states that the cake batter looks curdled during preparation and that is truly the case - dont be scared. i also brushed fresh lemon juice on the cakes immediately after oven removal to avoid dryness. dotn know if that helped but it added a nice flavor. the cakes were dense yet tender with a nice color and crumb. reducing the sugar was a good call as the frosting and curd were sweet enough (ps, i used the curd recipe from the lemon layer cake with mascarpone cream cheese frosting found on this site) and that was fantastic. i baked them in my breville toaster/convection oven so i removed them at the 30 min mark. next time i might remove them a smidge sooner. i also prepared this cake the day before then let it sit in the fridge over night. i would make this cake again for sure.

Also, the cake only took 35 minutes to bake, it would've burned otherwise.

Too sweet! I reduced the sugar in the frosting by a cup and a 1/4 and it was still too sweet. The cake also has too much sugar. I doubled the zest and lemon juice and the flavor was quite good. Too much frosting, I'm going to use it to frost a whole other cake next week. I added sliced strawberries on the outside, looked beautiful. I also increased the buttermilk by a 1/4 c. and brushed a little lemon juice on the cake straight from the oven, as others suggested-- I was afraid of the dryness others complained about. This cake was very moist with those tweaks. I also used fresh ginger in both the cake and frosting (instead of ground) and omitted the cinnamon. Overall, very good but next time I'll reduce the sugar.

Rating: 3
I added extra lemon, as suggested by several other reviewers, and sprinkled lemon zest on top of the cake for decoration. It looked very pretty, and I would definitely make it again, but it was certainly a much denser cake than the cakes I normally make. I think next time I would try slicing it into four layers and really going all out on the frosting between the layers. Despite frosting the middle layer quite heavily, most of the frosting had soaked into the cake by the time it was eaten. Perhaps it needs slightly more buttermilk than the amount suggested in the recipe?

I liked the frosting with extra lemon zest and juice but found the cake to have an odd, dry texture. I used cake pans with removeable bottoms and that may have contributed to the problem.

Yum! This cake was great! I did add a little more buttermilk than called for and it was nice and moist. I ended up using reduced fat buttermilk by accident, but it was still fine. I also doubled the amount of lemon juice and lemon rind in both the cake and the frosting and I thought it was just right. I also put lemon curd(store bought) in the middle along with the frosting. My husband, who is not a lemon fan, even loved it. he commented that it was not too lemony or two sweet.

We absolutely love this recipe. I cut the two rounds in half to make 4 layers. Then I spread jarred lemon curd in between the layers. Ice the whole thing w/ the lemon cream cheese icing. I also add more ginger as the ginger flavor is very subtle. A HUGE HIT!

I made this cake for my celebration/party at a Chinese restaurant. I did make a few minor substitutions: I added two small pinches of lemon zest but could have used some more; I made it as a bundt cake (was a lovely pale gold color) and made a fresh ginger glaze with a hint of lemon. It was a big hit, even with all the other outstanding desserts present. I will definitely make it again, but I think I will add in some freshly grated ginger as we love it (the ginger flavor was subtle if you follow it as is) and will add more lemon. All in all a big hit.

This is not a cake for those who have been raised on Duncan Hines super moist cakes. It is a bit drier and denser than most fluffy cakes but it has a great texture and goes well with coffee.

I have made hundreds of cakes and this is absolutely one of the best! I've made it twice in two days, if that tells you anything--and both times people went crazy over it. My only suggestion would be to omit the ginger and cinnamon..and add 2-3 times more lemon rind and juice...Also, when I read other reviews that said the cake was dry, I drizzled the juice from 1/2 lemon over each cake after it came out of the oven..and it was incredibly moist. It's beautiful and delicious.

I used the frosting recipe on a dutch apple cake (my moms) and loved it. It needs a lot more lemon juice and zest than called for to make it lemony. Go with your taste.

I incorporated a few previous suggestions and served this as 2 single layer cakes without frosting. I increased the lemon to 1tbsp rind & 1/3c juice. To compensate for the extra liquid, I decreased the amount of buttermilk to 1c. I wanted clean lemon & ginger flavours, so I omitted the cinnamon, used 1/2tbsp ginger powder & 1tbsp grated fresh ginger. The flavours shone without being overpowering and 2c of sugar gave it just the right amount of sweetness.

This is my favorite summer cake I have made it many times and it is always a winner. Lemon and raspberry curd have rotated as the filling and I have tried cream cheese and buttercream frostings. I am a bit heavy handed on the ginger and the final presentation is lovely. I use sugared organic edible flowers(pansies, shooting stars, voilets, rose petals etc) for decoration. Give it a try. Support local farmers!

I thought that by incorporating everyone's suggestions that this cake would be divine. I added more lemon (meyer) to everything and layered the cake with lemon curd but I have to say I was a bit disappointed. The best part of the cake was the curd and that wasn't even part of the recipe. The cake tasted good but it was way too dense for the style of cake. Everyone agreed that it should have been lighter/fluffier. Also, the frosting calls for too much sugar. I'll probably make this type of cake again but not with this recipe. If you do decide to make it- you have to add the curd, it makes the whole cake.

I made some changes to this recipe that I feel took it from 3.5 forks to 4 for me. For starters, I didn't have lemons, but I did have one lime and Key lime juice so I made Key Lime Ginger mini-cupcakes. I tried the original for one batch and decided to double the lime juice and one and a half times the ginger to really bring out the spice and umph (still a subtle taste that lingers with you for minutes after finishing one, and nowhere close to a really gingery or limey cake). The contrast is just wonderful. Bake time for the minis...17 minutes. Beautiful color and texture. I also reduced the sugar to 1 2/3 cup. Might go to 1.5 cups next time. The lime (plus 2 drops green food coloring) iceing and a few sprinkles of crystallized ginger on top made for a beautiful and complete presentation. Not one left at the party!

The lemon icing was outstanding, as so many of the reviewers have remarked. But I especially love this recipe because of the moistness and tenderness of the cake. The lemon ginger flavour is faily subtle, but tasty.

I'm rating the frosting, because I didn't make the cake. I used the frosting with the blueberry lemon cake from Bon Appetit Aug. '01, since all the reviews for that frosting said it was "slippery" (I had to transport the cake to a restaurant for a birthday party). Great combination! I will definately use the icing recipe again. Everyone loved the it!!

This is perfection and easy to make. You must follow directions exactly with no substitutions. Only confusing element which could lead to dampness is measuring cake flour and they don't give you much help here. I usually shake it out of the box into a large mixing bowl and then sift it onto a large paper towel and them soon it into a meansuring cup and level it off. You should have about 4 oz. of flour for each cup. I had no need to use knife to loosen sides as the cake pulled away as it baked. Good luck. This is a beautiful cake and well worth the minimal effort to make it. I found the amount of frosting to be just right.

this cake was sooooo dry. AND, I cooked it only 35 mins - 10 less than recommended. I omitted the ginger and cinnamon and it was flavorful still but SO dry. COuld choke a horse, really. I will make it again but with my own variation which will be to cook it 30 mins and substitute a cup of the flour (i used cake flour) for almond meal. And, I'd probably pour an almond liqueur over it as well. I frosted with cream cheese mixed with a jar of lemon curd, some powdered sugar (1/2 c?) lemon juice and lemon rind. The frosting was SCRUMPTIOUS!!

This is the perfect summer birthday (or any occassion) cake. I accidently put 1 1/2 cups of buttermilk and it was delicious so I think I will do the same the next time I make it. Also, I did add a couple of extra squirts of lemon to the cake and the icing and it was excellent.

This is my 2nd time making the cake as it turns out delicious and moist every time. Will make it again but help, when I put the icing over the curd, it seems to get all mushed together, with curd rolling down the side of the cake. Any tips?

This is pure lemon bliss! The cake is moist and full of flavor. A lot like a buttermilk pound cake. The icing is amazing. I did add a little extra lemon juice, just because I squeezed a bit too much. I had to refrig. frosting to firm up a bit. I also added a layer of raspberry jam along with the icing between layers. And, topped with fresh strawberries, kiwi and chopped crystalized ginger. Very complex flavors, but not too "busy". All flavors complimented one another well, but each was tasted and savored. Beautiful too! Will surely do again.

I made this cake for my brother's birthday - he is a true lemon lover. I took the previous reviewer's advice and made a quick lemon curd which I spread between the layers - a great addition. I should have taken their advice to cut the recipe in half, but didn't and I ended up throwing a lot of it away. I needed to refridgerate the frosting for about half an hour so it was spreadable without being too soft. Overall, a great cake for not a lot of work and can be made ahead.

I've made this recipe twice. The first time I had meyer lemons -- WOW. The second time generic lemons from the local prodcue store -- cake wasn't nearly as good. Next time I have meyer lemons I'll make the recipe again. I also cut the icing in half and used lemon curd between layers, a very nice touch.

I love this recipe, I make if for special occcasions. My sister and I choose a cake each year for our birthday, and she has asked for this one. I am sad to read a bad review about this. It truley is something to bring over to a friends house. In reading other reviews, my suggestion is to taste the batter and if you are a real lemon lover add a bit more, same with the ginger or the cinnamon. One of my families favorites!

Based on all the great reviews, I made this cake for a family birthday celebration. I was disappointed, to say the least. While edible, it was not the stunning lemon spice cake I expected. The texture was coarse and dry, and the lemon flavor was nearly non-existent. I am a culinary student and personal chef, not an "out-of-a-box" baker...not my first attempt at making a cake. The icing had good flavor but was more the consistency of a thick glaze. The cake did look pretty, however, decorated with blueberries, the remaining lemon peel, and some crystalized ginger.

I made this as a birthday/Christmas cake and decorated it with simple, edible flowers. It looked and tasted amazing. I did end up with some leftover frosting, there seemed to be plenty everywhere but maybe I was skimping on the middle layer.

This is a more texturally sophisticated cake than most, so it may not be for the person who likes their cakes from a box and their frosting with sprinkles. I omitted both the cinnamon and ginger, for a simpler lemon cake taste. After baking I brushed the top and sides of each layer with hot strained raspberry preserves. After it cooled I used a great lemon curd for the filling between layers and a a first frosting around the outside and top. I let it chill for a few hours and finally frosted the top and sides with the FANTASTIC frosting recipe. I topped it with fresh strawberries and kiwis, and a lemon cup filled with chopped fruit. This sophisticated "grown up" cake was a hit. Literally. I brought it in for my bosses' birthday and two women were fighting over the CRUMBS left on the plate and one of them slapped the other's hand to keep her away from the crumbs.

Excellent Cake! I made this for Christmas and everyone loved it. I used the lemon curd recipe from the lemon curd layer cake between the layers. The frosting was very good but the curd made the cake superb. I did add a little cinnamon because it said to in the recipe, even though it wasn't in the ingredient lists. I'm sure it would have been fine without it. Definitely a keeper.

I love this recipe! Usually my cakes don't turn out well, but this was fabulous. Everything about it is good, from the texture, taste, even the lemon peel on top. I just made it for my husband's birthday, and will make it again in 2 weeks for my son's.

It amazes me really that some people will give bad reviews for something like, "it didn't cook well" like the reviewer in Pasedena. Did you ever stop to consider that maybe there is something wrong with your oven? Something like that has nothing to do with the recipe and doesn't belong here.

I had planned to take this cake to a party and I'm very glad I tried making it a day early. The first time I tried, I used the suggested cooking time as a guidline. I took it out over 5 minutes before the suggested time and it was burnt. I tried it again the day of the party. I looked at it every few minutes and checked the middle, which was very runny. I ended up taking it out because it was begining to burn on the outside, over 15 minutes before the suggested time. The inside was barely cooked. It was extremely frustrating. The inside of the cake tasted okay, but it isn't worth the effort. I had to bake a third cake, and I didn't use this recipe.

The cake was very dense. Almost to the point of being very heavy. It did not rise in the oven even though the outside of the layers were browning. It sort of turned into a big giant soggy, dense mass once it sat on the table during coffe and desserts.

For Thanksgiving, I made all the standard desserts with the addition of this cake. It was the hit of the dinner. I reduced the ginger to 1.5 teaspoons, added Meyer lemon curd between layers then followed the other ingredients and instructions to the letter. It was delicious. My family wants me to make another for Christmas.

The cake was good but a bit too dense for my taste. If I make it again, I would try it with a little more flour. Instead of the frosting, I used lemon curd between the layers and it was really good. The frosting is, as always way too sweet, I only used aboud 1 1/2 cup of suger and that was plenty!

This cake TASTES delicious, but it's very dense for a layer cake. That said, it was perfect for my purpose, which was to use it as a decorating base for a four-tier 90th birthday cake for my mother. The cake came out beautifully cleanly and provided an ideal surface without crumbs. I used only the lemon, filled it will lemon curd, glazed it with apricot and decorated it with vines and flowers and used real ferns and pansies on the cake plate.

I'll preface my comments by saying that I am a cake baking novice. After buying special 9"x2" high cake pans, omitting the cinnamon (I couldn't figure out what else to do) and, on the second try, added brand new baking soda and baking powder the cake still fell flat and was really gooey. The flavor of this Mother's Day treat was great, but I wish I knew what happened to it. We aren't at high altitude. I followed the directions very carefully...especially on the second try. I would love to hear any ideas about what you think occurred.

I like this recipe and it is easy to make. I only had to go to the market for buttermilk, which I don't usually have at hand. Wish I had read the reviews prior to baking so I could have felt confidently about the icing (I didn't have the required amount of cream cheese and planned to cut the proportions accordingly). It was almost just right at 1/4 less than the recipe. What I want to know is, where is the measurement for cinnamon? It's listed in the directions, but not on the ingredient list. I added a few dashes but didn't want to be too heavyhanded with it. I also tossed in about 3T poppyseeds.

I made this cake for a friend's birthday, and it won rave reviews with my friends and the waitstaff at the restaurant we were dining at! I substituted lemon extract for the lemon zest to increase the lemon flavor. I also substituted cinammon for the ginger.

This cake tasted delicious, and I would certainly make it again; however, readers should note that there's a "glitch" in the recipe: Cinnamon is not listed in the ingredients, yet it is mentioned in the text regarding cake instructions. I added 1/2 tsp. and the cake tasted fine. I didn't add more because I was afraid the cinnamon might overpower the ginger. Also, 45 minutes for baking time was too long for my oven. You might want to check the cake earlier. Finally, the icing recipe makes way too much!
