Great dish - I have made it twice, with just minor tweaks (add whole head of garlic, plus 3 TB raz al hanout Moroccan spice mix). The second time, after browning the meat on the stove, I put all the ingredients into a slow cooker (kale added towards the end). I found this much more convenient, with no change in the quality of the resulting dish.

Made with pumpkin, kale, and watermelon radish (instead of turnips) from the farm box. Also pork shanks instead of boneless. It was yummy and not odd-tasting at all! It could go many ways in terms of spices: Moroccan, Ethiopian, Italian, Mexican...

My go-to recipe for maximizing our CSA Farm Share. Delicious and makes awesome leftovers. Try adding a cup of hard cider or beer to the recipe to really meld the flavors.... MMMMM

Made as directed, with the addition of a bit of curry powder. Delicious!!!

This stew is delicious. I made it a little different: first of all I cooked it on top of the stove, I added stock rather than water, and I used left-over pumpkin (its was already cooked), and left-over greens (they were right out of the freezer). Yummm -- what a flavorful and delicious stew.

I really enjoyed this - made with pasture raised North Carolina pork (to die for!). It definitely was good for several days. I froze about half of the recipe and it defrosted a little watery and a little mushy - but still edible. I cooked as instructed (i.e. put the pumpkin in when instructed) and it turned out great. I did use potatoes instead of turnips and 1/2 farmers-market spinach and 1/2 turnip greens.

What a great and easy recipe. I was surprised on how good it tasted. Tried it with chicken and turkey as well. Also stood up very well for next day or two eating! Try this if you want to try something new. I paired it with a nice Pinot grigio or Red Zinfandel.

I love this recipe. I make it exactly as stated and it's a wonderful winter stew. My only issue: the pumpkin should go in at the same time as the turnips. I use sugar pie pumpkin and it takes much longer to cook the the recipe implies. I also add the kale a little later because I like it a little undercooked. You really have to brown the meat to get a strong base for this stew. So comforting and very flavorful.

Totally changed up this recipe based on what I had on hand. Used canned pumpkin instead of chunks of fresh pumpkin and potatoes instead of turnips. Threw in some leftover fresh basil leaves, a few baby carrots, and a handful of frozen peas, along with a slice of bacon. Overall, this recipe makes a good base for an African-inspired stew, and can be doctored up in a bunch of ways. Be sure to toss in a cinnamon stick and a sprinkle of cumin too.

Tasty, in spite of few seasonings. Reduce cooking times by half, and omit or diminish water.

I added 1T cumin 2T curry powder and a whole head of garlic and this is one of my faves because it's completely within my nutritional plan. A big thanks to the other cooks for the suggestion.

I'll make it again, but I'll make the same changes I did originally. I switched russet potatoes for the turnips, added 2 tbs. of good curry powder, and 1 tbs. of red pepper. I also added a whole head of chopped garlic, which I sauteed in the dutch oven before I added the onion. My additions made it a 3 1/2 forker.

I have made this dish twice now. It is a perfect fall dish- I made a few changes- double the garlic, added some cumin and used spinach instead of kale. Also, butternut squash was a good substitute for the pumpkin. We put the stew in a hollowed out pumpkin on halloween....lots of fun.

As the other reviewers have suggested, this dish was much too bland. I added about 2/3 of a cup of Madeira at the very end, which picked it up some, but the improvement wasn't great enough to warrant making this again.

do you think the guy from san francisco was kidding about the teriyaki sauce?? YIKES!!

I followed the recipe with the exception of doubling the amount of garlic. I trimmed all of the fat off of the pork and we liked the dish very much. I did add some salt and pepper each time I added ingredients. Next time I will include a bouquet garni and add about a 1/4 cup of minced fresh rosemary. This will add a nice herb flavor and keep the recipe healthy.

I changed it quite a bit so I may have a totally different dish, but everyone LOVED what I came up with so here you go. Not crazy about turnips so I added more pumpkin - only had a little kale so I added some spinach (the thicker kind - not salad kind). Was a bit bland so I added some cumin and curry. THAT made the dish.

My husband and I made this last night and it is quite good. The only adjustment I would make is to add a little salt to enhance the flavors. The pumkin and turnips are great. The pork is good too, but you might leave it out for a good vegetarian dish. We will make this one again.

If you don't follow the recipe, is it honest to rate it? This is not only utterly delicious--the flavours were made for each other--it is very light in fat and calories (as long as the meat is well trimmed), exceptionally nutritious, and very pretty on the plate. Use a little Sugar Pie pumpkin or a bright orange squash such as the butternut, buttercup, and the Jamaican "pumpkin" or calabaza, not the big, watery, coarse Jack-O-Lantern type. The kale keeps its colour nicely. I used a rutabaga or Swede turnip--the recipe didn't specify. I will make this again and again, (and again) but it deserves something fancier than rice. Maybe I'll try making homemade buckwheat noodles.

I used one turnip, a few parsnips, and a rutabaga instead of the lb of turnips because I'm not that wild about turnips. I also cooked it in a crockpot and did not add the oil. So if you follow the directions more closely, you may have a different result. Mine was light and rather bland. We ended up adding a bit of teriyaki sauce to it and it was pretty tasty. But not worth the hassle to make again.
