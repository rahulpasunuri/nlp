In order to make the batter stick to the onion rings, place the onions into flour before dipping into the batter. Also, to make the onion rings more crispy, after dipping the onion rings into the batter, coat them with a dry mixture of 30 saltine crackers and 4 cups of kettle potato chips (finely grind the crackers and chips in food processor). These two tips will greatly improve the receipe.

I followed this recipe with one change - I substituted creme fraiche for buttermilk. It resolved ALL of other reviewers' troubles with consistency, etc. These are not only the best onions rings I've ever made, they're the best I've ever eaten anywhere! I highly, highly recommend them, using creme fraiche instead of buttermilk.

After I mixed the batter and tried to make these the original way, I dumped everything out and followed the suggestions of the last reviewer. The onion rings were ok, but nothing to write home about. Too messy to prepare, with a so-so result -- certainly nothing I'll bother with again! The reality is that there are just some foods that aren't suited to be "low fat". I'd rather splurge occasionally on good crispy deep fried onion rings!

The first time I made these, I had the same problem as other reviewers.. the batter dripped off of the onions, onto the pan. I figured out how to make the batter stick. Put the dry ingredients into one bowl, the buttermilk into another bowl, and put 1 cup of seasoned bread crumbs into another bowl. Dip the onions into the dry ingredients, then the buttermilk, then the breadcrumbs. Put on a baking sheet, and spray with olive oil Pam. This makes them crispier than the original recipe, but the batter stuck, and they were really good for a low fat recipe.

OK..so I give this 3 forks in the low fat world of food..I increased the 1/4 cup of flour to heaping..to that I added about 1 1/2 T corn starch to the consistancy where the batter was thick enough to adhere to the onions fairly well..I used my well seasoned cast iorn skillet and sprayed it with"Spectrum Naturals Skillet Spray ...Super Canola" 0 cal..0 fat..(totally omit olive oil)..you have to get the skillet hot but just before smoking..after each batch I resprayed extra canola oil...after about 13 min. in a 450 oven I had some pretty darn good onion rings..

Made this for dinner with friends and turned out to be a hit. However I would use more flour next time to creat a slightly thicker batter. Also, pam worked better than the olive oil for browning the rings.

It was easy to make and tasted almost as good as something that you would find in a low-fat resturant.

This is the worst recipe from Gourmet I have ever tried. Their recipes usually work, but this one was a complete failure. I was so disappointed.

I had the same problem as the other reviewer...the batter stuck to the pan, not to the onion. I tried a second batch using more oil, but still couldn't get the batter to stick to the onion. I wouldn't make these again.

I have to second the previous review. Loving onion rings and hating the fat involved in deep fat frying, I too was intrigued by the recipe. It just didn't cut it though.

I have to say that I LOVE onion rings, but am pretty health-conscious so I was eager to try this recipe. However, it just didn't work. The batter was so thin that it didn't stick to the onions, but it did stick to the pan (even a non-stick one) so I basically had near-naked onions. Also, the baking time given is too long, as I checked them well before time was up and they were already burning. If someone gets better results, I'd love to hear how!
