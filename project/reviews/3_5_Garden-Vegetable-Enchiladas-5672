The reason I gave this 4 forks is that it is an exceptionally well recieved easy weeknight recipe. I always get requests for seconds. (Read: fabulous comfort meal). I've had it in the mix for a few years now, and the family and guests always ask for it when they come. I also like that it is a great base for those harvest days when you may need to use something from the garden or market and vary your veggies a bit. I agree that the sauce is too heavy on the chili powder for most, and that this gives the sauce a different appearance which may not be as well received by some, (although I swear it tastes exactly like a sauce I've had in great authentic places, but....for our purposes, I reduce chili powder to only 1T tops, and add depth of flavor by adding whatever strikes me at the time: a little cinnamon, even cocoa, tomato paste, garlic, etc., and then throwing heat (jalepenos, other chilis, or even a smoked or roasted sweet chili) to the veggie mix,, or with a little good pepper jack cheese (we like Tillamook). I have also added roasted chicken, and kept the ratio of filling similar, and, for color, I hardly ever go without throwing a few bell peppers in. I find the tortillas that work best for us are the ones you must make from scratch, or, the tortillaland raw ones, freshly toasted & ready to go. Don't be afraid to vary this one to your liking, or, to make it exactly as written! It's a winner.

Always trying to find new vegetarian recipes, I tried this tonight and my whole family (which includes a 10 and 11 year old) LOVED it!! Also, I used Almond Milk (original, unsweetened) rather than whole milk, and it worked beautifully! An easy way to cut the fat and make this healthier! Also found that 2 cups milk is sufficient. Too much sauce otherwise, in my opinion. This is being added to my regular recipes! Delicious! (Just a portion note: it makes 8 nicely filled enchiladas.)

2 forks means the recipe was "good"...that is how I would classify this dish. Nothing amazing, but solid normal dish. The big problem for us was the amount of chili powder. I doubled the sauce, but kept the chili powder at 3T and it was SPICY. I love spicy, but it made it difficult for my kids to enjoy. So, my recommendation is to reduce chili powder. Also, I added black beans...nice addition.

Excellent taste!! I added 3 cloves of garlic to the filling--yum. I used corn tortillas and it was wonderful but didn't hold it's shape...it was quite messy on the plate. Any suggestions on keeping these together?

This is a delicious dish and one I often serve to company to rave reviews. I usually add a can of drained and rinsed black beans to the mixture. Like others, I also make extra sauce (1 1/2 times what the recipe calls for). Love it!

This a dinner regular in our house and we always love it. I tend to use just 6 tortillas so there is a higher filling to tortilla ratio but the recipe is excellent as written.

We doubled the sauce and aded about two tablespoons of red mole paste. Added fire roasted red pepper and poblano to the veggies. It was wonderful. Will make again for sure!

This is my go-to enchilada recipe. It is a delicious vegetarian dish as is, but I've also added shredded chicken to it and may try shredded pork sometime soon. To really send it over the top, add a thin strip of 1/3-less cream cheese to the filling of each enchilada. The resulting creamy texture will make you swoon!

Double the sauce. YUM!!!!

Very tasty and easy. Sauce is delicious. I made 6 well stuffed enchiladas instead of 8. I also used 2c zucchini and the 3rd was carrot, spinach and mushroom combo. There wasn't enough sauce for my taste, so drizzled some ranchero over the top.Definitely a keeper.

I made this as written except that I added about six cloves of garlic to the zucchini filling. I thought it was fantastic. I think it would be really good with some diced roasted potatoes added to the filling.

Rating: 3
I thought this dish was very good. It's also a great dish for company because you can put it in the oven just before they arrive and then relax. After reading all the reviews, I made the following changes based on what other people did or felt was lacking. 1. For the filling, I used red onion, added 2 cups of chopped baby spinach, and instead of sauteing the zucchini, I roasted it in the oven sprayed with olive oil and added it to the filling. I also used 2 tbsp canned diced jalapeno instead of mild chilies. 2. For the sauce, I used 1/2 cup canned tomato sauce and 2 cups milk 3. I used corn tortillas and microwaved them 15 s per two to make them easier to roll. They were small so I used 14 instead of 8. It came out great! Do not leave it in a warm oven when it is done, though, as this dries out the sauce and cheese. It would have been best served immediately. Next time, I might double the sauce as we all like our enchiladas runny, or maybe I won't add the sauce to the filling which was quite flavorful on its own.

Rating: 1
I am a vegetarian. My son and wife cooked this. The only change they made was putting in some refried beans in the filling, which I suggested when they made the recipe. They did not have any green chilies so I suggested sauteed yellow peppers. This recipe definitely needed tomato paste in the sauce along with garlic. The filling needed cheese, garlic and oregano and avocado or guacamole. I would give this no stars if it were possible. I have made enchiladas before and these were the worst I have ever had.

Rating: 4
For a quick meal on a Friday night, instead of making the sauce I purchased the new Salsa Verde by Pace and pretty much followed the rest of the recipie. I prefer corn tortillas but found them difficult to roll, so next time I'd probably make this as a casserole and leave the tortillas flat. Otherwise, taste was yummy!!

This tasted much better when I made it with corn tortillas instead of flour. It's too doughy with flour tortillas.

I made this with Trader Joe's frozen fire-roasted corn, added a jalapeno, used non-fat milk, low fat cheese, and substituted olive oil for the butter. I also added shredded chicken to half the batch. It also needed a pinch of salt. Delicious! It was a big hit!

Rating: 3
Made some substitutions to make it slightly lower in fat and more nutritious that still resulted in a meal that pleased the adults and under 12 crowd in the house. For the filling: Swapped the butter for olive oil. Then instead of the zucchini/squash... used a cup of chopped frozen (thawed) spinach and two cups of chopped broccoli. Also added a can of drained pinto beans. Because I have a picky eater who turns her nose up at beans, I snuck 'em in by chopping them up. (Love my mini- food processor). For the sauce, used low fat cheese and low fat milk. And also went with the whole wheat tortillas instead of the white ones.

Actually, I would give this 2 1/2 forks. Can't quite get to 'delicious' for an everyday dinner kind of thing. Anyway, my family liked this.

Rating: 4
Added fresh spinach, mushrooms and garlic and subbed fresh pasilla peppers for the canned. Also, omitted one tbl. of chili powder in the sauce and added a small, minced chipotle pepper instead. Even used the corn which added a nice crunchiness. Addition of all of the fresh vegetables, however, increased the prep time substantially, but the result really was delicious.

Rating: 3
An astonishing, even devastating dish. That is to say, if one were to use fresh green chilies to add a particular gut-punch to the already sublime sauce. "Goodness! Such superlatives! Why only 3 forks, darling?" you may quibble? I don't know. Snobbery, perhaps. Dishes that overwhelm subtlety with heavy gustative brio receive acclaim but not awards; make something opaque, elliptical but sparklingly intelligent -- like the films of Jean Renoir -- and you get the special jury prize. Go with God and frozen corn, my moderns! You will not be disappointed.

Rating: 4
Made the recipe exactly as written with farmer's market and homegrown yellow squash, zucchini, and corn, and LOVED it. The sauce is oh so indulgent and tasty. Craving it again later in the week, made a slightly healthier version using 2% milk, reduced fat cheese, and whole wheat tortillas (also, sauteed fresh jalapeno instead of canned greed chiles) and it came out just as good!! I also like a pinch of cayenne in the sauce to give it an extra kick.

Even with adding a can of black beans, my husband and I thought this was bland and boring. Not worth the calories or effort. The recipe on this site for chicken enchiladas is far superior.

I didn't expect to like this, but I needed an easy enchilada casserole. This was just fantastic! Home cooking at its most satisfying best. Non fat milk is fine to use. Fresh corn made it even better.

This is a really good recipe. I made it for some family members, none of which are vegetarian (I am). I think a couple of them were skeptical at first, but they all enjoyed the end result and kept raving about it! The only thing I changed about this recipe was the tortillas. I used 12 small corn tortillas (gorditas; the thicker ones) instead of flour. I also fried them for a second or two in hot oil. I think that step makes the enchiladas more "authentic", though it may not make them healthier . . . I did not double the sauce. There was enough, but no extra. Maybe 1 1/2 recipes of the sauce would be the way to go. To be honest, when I first tasted the sauce while I was making it. I thought it was kind of odd. It is not like any enchilada sauce that I have had, and I am a native Arizonan. However, once the dish was put together and baked, it was pretty tasty. One last thing I would like to mention - I thought this recipe was very messy and not as easy as some other reviews have described. It ended up being worth it, but it took some work! I wouldn't call this a regular "weeknight" dinner. Overall, a great recipe. I only gave it three forks because I like to save four forks for dishes that truly blow me away. I'll make these again.

Rating: 4
Love this recipe! It never fails! Dish should be covered with foil for first 30 minutes of cooking & then check to see if it's done or not. Can remove foil for last 10 minutes if more time is needed. Otherwise, you're right, it dries out the sauce. The spiciness of the sauce mellows with cooking, so don't worry if sauce tastes too spicy after you cook it on the stove.

We served this at a recent dinner party and everyone cleaned their plates. We added black beans and used both zuccini and yellow squash.

Rating: 3
This is a very good recipe that inspires creativity to make it truly great. I needed to increase the amount of filling so I used a bit of extra zuccini, lots of onion and garlic, added some black beans and stirred in a bit more of the sauce than the recipe instructed. Doubling the sauce is essential. I also felt the sauce needed more of a punch so I added a second can of green chiles. I used a corn/flour blend tortilla which added just enough of the nutty texture corn sweetness needed. I also feel that the cilantro is a must in this recipe, it helps add an extra layer of flavor and authenticity. My family and dinner party guests absolutely raved! I served this with spanish rice and a salad made of baby greens, scallions, mandarin oranges and avocado tossed in an orange garlic vinaigrette.

Rating: 2
I'd really like to give it 2 and a half forks. I used slightly less chili powder, and no cilantro as I forgot to buy some! Added chicken as well, although I'm sure it would have been good without it. Next time I plan to add some spinach and red pepper.... Just wondering though - it doesn't say to cover the dish before baking, but I can't imagine NOT covering it (I did with foil for most of the baking time.) Wouldn't it get rather dry and the sauce disappear???

We made this as written the first time, and enjoyed it, but thought it could be better. The second time we left the chilli powder out of the sauce and the mild green chillis out of the filling. Instead we put in three tablespoons a chipotles in adobo sauce into the filling. This really lifted up the flavour and made it something that would deserve four forks.

This was easy and very tasty. I made half of the enchiladas as the recipe was written, and I added some pre-cooked chicken in the other half for my husband. We loved both options and will be making these again very soon. I did start to run out of the sauce though )and it thickened more than expected), so I may make more of the sauce next time.

Made this and Mexican black beans for a vegetarian crowd. Doubled the recipe, and as I was pressed for time, made it as a casserole, as another reviewer suggested. It was great!! Used corn tortillas to make it healthier, and cut back a bit on the chili powder--everyone loved it. This is a definite keeper.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe several times and it has been enjoyable every time. Perfect for a vegetarian mexican meal. A couple of comments: First, make sure to get good chile powder - fresh powder makes tastier sauce. Also, add a couple of tablespoons more powder than what is called for in the recipe. Using 2% milk is fine. This recipe would be more authentic with corn tortillas - they add a nice texture and flavor. For the cook who had difficulty rolling the corn tortillas: Place a damp paper towel in a bag with the corn tortillas and microwave for one minute. Keep the warm tortillas that you are not currently working with covered while you roll your enchiladas.

I've made this dish twice now and it turned out very good both times. I did try to make the recipe a bit healthier. I increased the zucchini by about a cup. I substituted 1 Tbsp canola oil for the butter used to saute the veggies and used only 2 Tbsp of butter in the sauce. I also used 2% milk instead of whole milk and corn tortillas. I made this casserole style (a lot simpler and a time saver) in a 9x13 glass dish, layering sauce, tortilla, veggie mix, and repeat once. For flavor I added half a small can of peppers in adobe sauce chopped to the veggies and used roasted corn. My boyfriend loves this dish and he is the ultimate carnivore. This is a very solid recipe.

Amazing sauce! I used a random hodge-podge of veggies out of the fridge to stuff my enchiladas and they turned out great!

We liked this recipe a lot. I also used skim milk, which was fine, and I saved off some of the sauce to serve over it at the table. I tried using both flour and corn tortillas and I couldn't get the corn tortillas to roll -- they kept breaking. If I did it again using only corn tortillas, I would layer it lasagna style instead. Adding a little finely chopped red bell pepper over the top at the end added a nice bit of color.

My family loved this. My parents keep raving about my newfound cooking skill, they won't listen when I tell him that I owe it all to epicurious's recipes like this one. As I was making it, the dish looked a bit bland, however (too much dairy and yellow vegetables), so I halved a very generous amount of cherry tomatoes ontop of the enchiladas before I put them into the oven. It added a sweet punch, which greatly improved the taste. I would also recommend a little bit of red bell pepper, fresh green chilies as opposed to canned, and some jalapeno.

WOW! This was great! We made it just as in the recipe, but substituted 1 fresh jalapeno for the canned chilis and used 2 fresh ears of corn for the frozen corn.

Will definitely make again.

Really deserves 2 1/2 stars - I took the advice of others and added 1 red bell pepper (for the last minute or two of sauteeing) and 1 can of red pinto beans (didn't have any black beans but will try them next time.) Also, all I had to substitute ground Chipotle Pepper for Chili Powder, which was yummy in the sauce. Nice dish because you can use whatever fresh veggies you have on hand - my husband is already asking for a second round!

This was good but not great. The sauce was quite good, but overpowered the flavor of the veggies & tortilla (in all fairness, I didn't have chilies which would have helped, and I used 1/2 chili powder and 1/2 chipotle chili powder, which may have made it overpoweringly spicy). Adding black beans seems a good idea & would maybe balance it out. Mine reheated well and actually had better flavor the next day. 1% milk worked fine in the sauce.

This recipe was easy and very good. I ended up making it twice over the course of a weekend, and just doubled everything up front, with the only time spent each day assembling the enchiladas.

I made this recipe at the last minute for a dinner party we hosted and it was hit!! I made just a couple of changes. I didn't do the recommended sauce because I was short on time (used canned Ortega Enchilada Sauce instead which worked out just fine). I also added black beans to the enchilada filling. I used jalapeno/pepperjack cheese in the filling and also on top of the enchilada sauce at the end. Yum, yum, yum...can't wait to make this recipe again and it was soooooooo easy!

The sauce is delicious. I added a pound of shrimp to the filling and, instead of rolling the tortillas, I made the casserole in layers like a lasagna. Other than those changes, I followed the recipe exactly. I had meant to make a side dish of Mexican rice but didn't get around to it, and I found that this dish was great on its own.

It was delicious, and I felt very healthy afterwards (I love veggies). I guess my oven is a bit hot but they came out a bit overcooked on the top the first time, so now I check them early to make sure they don't get overdone. I also find they stick to the pan, so use some pam or oil on it.

Rating: 3
SUPERB! The rare recipe that's easy, delicious and relatively healthy. A very forgiving recipe, too, since the only thing you really have to measure is the sauce. The rest can be eyeballed. AND a great way to use up odds and end from the garden at the end of the season. I used everything fresh--corn, hot peppers, baby squash and a nice red onion. Used skim milk in the sauce because that's what I had --it was excellent and contributed to the overall lightness of the dish. Next time may try layering because rolling was hard (though it came out fine. DO use Pam on your dish). Absolutely outstanding with a tomato salad! Will make again!

This was a really good recipe. Next time I'll use corn tortillas and add some hot pepper to may it spicier. Also, I bet black beans would be a fabulous addition as well. I'm sure many different types of veggies would work here. Eat it all up the day you make it, cuz' it's not as good the next day.

Made this twice already. I really love the enchilada sauce. I used flavored flour tortillas because all the corn tortillas I found were really small.

Oh my gosh is this every good! I have made this 3 times this month alone. I served this to a few vegitarian friends of mind and they all had 3rds!! I always use a combination of zuchinni and yellow squash for their great colors, and about 3/4 cup cilantro. Instead of flour tortillas, use corn tortillas, they have more flavor and mix well with the sauce. I also used more cheese on top of the enchiladas. If you are pressed for time I have also made this as a casserole, layers all the ingredients instead of rolling up the tortillas with great results. Definitely right this recipe!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! The corn add SO much sweetness to it (I personally can't imagine it without that) & flour tortillas work GREAT but especially if you use ones that aren't "gorditas" (use the thinner ones). Also, I cut back on the chili powder to 3 "teaspoons" instead of "tablespoons" as it seemed to be too much for my tastes, but everything else I kept the same. I HIGHLY recommend this -- especially if you're feeding vegetarians (as I am) !

Do not use flour tortillas, corn tortillas are a definite must. Be generous with the sauce on the bottom and warm any extra and bring to the table otherwise tortillas could be dry. Sauce is tasty, make extra for vegies the following night.Serve with a romaine, pepita salad with cilantro dressing and excellent cruelty free meal.

This is a wonderful vegetarian mexican dish! My roommate and I loved it! We wish it had a little less fat content. Next time, I will try it with skim milk or 1%.
