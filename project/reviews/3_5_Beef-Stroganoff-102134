I have made this dish with this recipe over and over since 2007. Everytime it comes out delicious!! I have found that the only time the bottom of my pan burns while cooking the meat, is when I dont add enough oil....you can always add more if you start with what the recipe calls for. I have also tried with different meat cuts, I recommend sticking with the filet...it melts in your mouth! I pretty much follow the recipe except I mix button mushrooms and baby bellas. YUM!!! Enjoy!!!

I basically followed this as written and oh man was it yummy!! Instead of cream I used a mix of greek yogurt and half and half mixed to the consistency of cream. It was really just a lovely and slightly hungarian taste...also put chopped scallions on top, made for nice presentation, and skipped the butter on the noodles completely though I did put about 1 T in the sauce. OH YUM we licked our plates :)

Yes! Definitely making again. Had no cognac. Added frangelica..you work with what you got, right? This was fabulous. Dijon a must, also added Worcester , and my creme fraiche wasn't thick enough so took tip from another review and did 1T cornstarch to 1/4 c water to thicken before adding back in sirloin (1#). Loved the results

I had some top round steak I didn't know what to do with, when I found this recipe here for beef Stroganoff. I had homemade beef broth so that made it the perfect mid week recipe to try. No shopping required:) Followed the recipe with 2 exceptions. I put the cognac over the mushrooms before I added the beef broth and flamed it. That was fun and burned up the alcohol leaving great flavor in the sauce. I also left off the dill garnish in favor of parsley. Otherwise it was a great dinner. Will do again.

Excellent. Saved this to my box and will definately make it again. Agree with other posters though - I think next time I will double the sauce.

Am glad I chose steak tip strips instead of fillet. First problem - searing at a high temperature is necessary but leaves a nasty burnt layer on the surface of the pan and because everything is added in later, it imparts that flavor into the sauce. Probably better to sear it in one pan and then transfer it to another. Second, I used a store bought broth and maybe it does not contain the same amount of collagen that a homemade broth would have but my sauce never ever thickened. runny runny runny with a hint of char. quite a disappointment.

Used ground venison and Worcestershire sauce (instead of cognac), and this turned out great. Easy and delicious. Omitted dill, otherwise stayed with the recipe

Oh My God! This is a fabulous dish. I didn't care for my Grandmothers beef stroganoff growing up, but my sister loved it. Since Grandma passed on my sister has not had beef stroganoff that she has liked; so I set out to find a recipe that would compare to our Grandmothers....and I found this recipe. It is was my first choice of recipes & my last to try. When i prepared it I had 3 changes (1lb. of beef -only because thats all I had on hand was 2 sirloin steaks, I also added 2tbsp of corn starch to .5 cup of cold water, and 6oz. of noodles vs. 12 . . . .I like my food very saucy). This is sooooo good, all my family & my picky sister said this is just as good as grandmas if not better. Plus I LOVED IT.

This is a regular meal in our house and, as stated, great for entertaining. Tenderloin is not necessary and I always use 1.5-2x the dijon to balance the cream. I also avoid buttering the noodles so that they are not too rich and so the sauce sticks to them better.

A regular dish in our house and, as stated, impressive for entertaining. Tenderloin is not necessary and I always use 1.5-2x the dijon to balance the cream. Also, I avoid buttering the noodles as it makes them too rich and the sauce does not stick as well to the noodle.

Love this recipe! I make it all the time with a few minor modifications: 1. I leave out the Cognac 2. I add worchestershire sauce For both the dijon and worchestershire I don't really measure, I do it by taste. I'd say approx. 1.5 T dijon and 2+ T. of worchestershire. 3. I sub ground beef for the tenderloin. Less expensive and very easy to work with.

Rating: 4
Found myself with a smallish piece of tenderloin tip and thought this would be wonderful! It was. Because I only had about the half the beef, I kept the rest as is so that there would be sufficient sauce. My only changes were to use a bouillon cube with Worcestershire sauce, as recommended, sour cream and some Sherry, as I was out of cognac/brandy. I should have thinned it down a little with whipping cream, but otherwise, I think this was marvelous. I also checked my old cookbooks to see how they differed. The 1961 NYT Cookbook by Craig Claiborne called for a small amount of prepared mustard but no mushrooms and the 1975 Joy of Cooking had mushrooms but no mustard! A retro classic.

Very disappointing - not enough sauce, and a rather strange one at that (I should have reconsidered the Dijon). Honestly, probably one of biggest let downs as far as recipes go - pass this one by, do yourself a favor.

This recipe is dynamite. I'm giving it 4 stars not because it's perfect, but because it is fast and easy to prepare and is an excellent basic recipe that takes well to substitutions if necessary. I currently live in Sao Paulo where cognac is too expensive to use for cooking. I used a cup of white wine, deglazed and reduced , then added 3 cups of water and reduced again. Doubling the sauce is a must! And don't leave out the dill, paprika and dijon-- they added complexity and elevated the whole dish. Will definitely make this again and wouldn't hesitate to put on the buffet for a large crowd. I think it will do well if made ahead, just don't add the cream until re-heating.

Rating: 4
I doubled the sauce as recommended and was glad I did! Everyone loved this. The only change I made was to add 1 tsp. of Worcestershire to the beef broth to give a better depth of flavor. I did reduce the amount of butter on the noodles since I had so much yummy sauce. It's a classic recipe and will be my "go to recipe" from now on.

This is wonderful and has become a staple in our house. I do adjust the recipe to provide for more sauce. I use an entire can of beef broth and then increase the whipping cream, cognac and dijon and salt to taste. It has such a rick taste. Excellent!

I thought this was very good. Beef Stroganoff, for me, must have sour cream so I used about 1/2 cup sc and 1/4 cup whipping cream. I omitted the Dijon, as we are not big fans of mustard but the dill was wonderful. Would definitely make again...with more sauce!

The best dish I have ever made with leftover roast beef. I'll be making this again and again. I didn't brown the meat, just sliced it and added at the end - and served over rice. Fabulous.

Rating: 3
I doubled the sauce, and next time I will treble, even with a 2-lb roast. I'm not sure it's worth throwing in a half bottle of Cognac when increasing the sauce, but it could stand some more pizazz. The dill is essential; increase the Dijon. Perhaps a wholes chopped onion, rather than the shallots? And don't forget the paprika (as I did) -- now there's some pizazz. The cut of meat is essential for tenderness and flavour, and can be costly.

Rating: 4
This was fab -- but I made a lot of changes -- I am allergic to mushrooms and I only had seitan (vegetarian beef - ha!) in the fridge. I took the suggestion to add greek yogurt and used ice wine instead of cognac. Turned out great over mashed potatoes.

Rating: 4
Since it was first published in Bon Appetit, this has been our go-to stroganoff recipe. The cognac, dill, paprika each add oomph to what can otherwise be a fairly one-dimensional dish. That said, the sauce definitely needs to be doubled, and the noodles sure don't need 4 T of butter. Egg noodles are already rich and flavorful. Spend those fat calories on additional creamy sauce instead!

Rating: 4
This was excellent and got great reviews from 2 big meat-eating guests (I'm not much of a meat eater, but also loved it). My rating is based on a slightly modified version using other reviewers' recommendations (and adaptations to make it a bit healthier/lighter). I doubled the sauce and I used about 1 3/4 cups 2% Fage greek yogurt. I used 2 lbs (I don't think the extra 1/2 lb was necessary) of choice tenderloin (my guests could tell the meat was high quality and I think its tenderness is really important to making the dish great). The dill really makes a difference and I used it as a garnish when serving the dish, which added nice color. If you have a Trader Joe's near you, it is a great time saver to use their pre-sliced, packaged crimini and white mushrooms. The dish was suprisingly quick and easy to make.

Rating: 0
I cook onions until golden brown in butter or olive oil, take them out and cook sliced sirloin salted and peppered with the onion flavored oil. Then I remove them and add most of a can of beef consomee to the pan and add a couple tbsps of yellow mustard and simmer it having added a little cornstarch to the remaining consomee and stirring it in as a thickener. I then add maybe a 1/3 cup of sour cream, more or less, and the onions and meat back into the mixture and heat. I try to cook the meat so that it is only medium rare and only warm it when it is added back into the mixture. I think I am going to try the mushrooms added next time as I really love them. I do like the lightly caramelized in it also. [url=http://www.dogs-info.net/html/Breeds/2010/1105/Bullmastiff-Breed.html][b]bullmastiff[/b][/url]

Yum! This is so good. We doubled the sauce and I highly recommend doing so. The only ingredient changes we made were to use half sour cream and half heavy cream, as we were out of creme fraiche and we also added 2 tablespoons of worcestershire. The fresh dill at the end is perfection. This is so not the campbell's cream-of-whatever soup variety of stroganov that you had as a kid and thank God for that. This is delicious!

Rating: 4
PERFECT! I have made this several times, and although I would love to be able to serve my family beef tenderloin any given Tuesday night, I more often opt for a less expensive cut. The sauce has such a great flavor that I really don't think it makes that big of a difference. I do think the heavy whipping cream is key. I did as others have suggested & used sour cream the last time I made it & I do not think it was as good. Fresh Dill is key as well.

This is the best beef stroganoff recipe I have tried to date. The family raved over it and my picky 2 yr old loved it!! The sauce was nice and light rather than thick and heavy but had SO much flavor. I followed the directions exactly and didnt change a thing. Excellent recipe!

It's very good. The first time, I used the beef tenderloin. Have made it several times since with 3 lbs. ground chuck instead, and it's still very good (and much less expensive). I double the dill. I'm making it again tonight, and I think I will add a little extra Dijon, too. Aside from that, the only change I've made is to use sour cream instead of the creme fraiche or heavy cream. This is on my short list of dishes I never get tired of. Pure comfort food. When it's gone, I miss it, even after I've eaten it for five or six days in a row. The man agrees. :) It claims to be four servings, but for us it's been ten to twelve servings every time.

This is a wonderful recipe for Stroganoff. I used a Flat Iron Steak from Ralphs partially frozen to make slicing paper thin pieces easier. Flat Iron Steaks are less expensive than Filet and just as tender. The dill makes this dish and the CF does not curdle as sour cream can. I make this dish at least once a month and it's awesome for a cold rainy night.

This recipe is great, I used sour cream instead of either the CF or the WC, I almost tripled the sauce, and used garlic, worch. sauce, lots of dijon, shallots, cognac and beef broth. Living in FL I always have fresh herbs growing outdoors, so I did use the dill. I will make this many more times, everyone really enjoyed this meal. I did used the beef tenderloin per the recipe, it just melts in your mouth.

Easy to make, use a little extra cognac, a bit of Worcestershire and over indulge on the mustard on the first go around until the beef broth boils off. Then add more, a dash more of the cognac and do a second round of braising. Last, do not feel shy about the butter on the noodles. You can live long and be healthy with a treat like this every once in a while. And then take a nice long run in the morning!

This is the best beef stroganoff I've ever had. Don't tell my mother... I have made this a few times, and it is great as-is. The only change I like to make is to use sour cream instead of whipping cream. The beef tenderloin is worth it because you don't have to cook it for hours and it still melts in your mouth. The dijon and dill take this to the extreme limits of in-your-mouth pleasure.

This recipe is great! I've made it multiple times and every time it gets rave reviews. I made a couple of adjustments using other people's suggestions: I use olive oil instead of vegetable; up the shallots a bit to two small shallots; substitute Worcestershire sauce for the Cognac since I never have that around the house; take out the dill since it's not a taste I'm particularly fond of; I've tried it both with and without the paprika and it's great either way. Recipes like this are why epicurious.com is my first stop!

This was really tasty but with some tweaks based on other user reviews (I read through the first 30 or so reviews this time and found it very helpful before starting) and a couple of my own to cut down on some calories/richness (yes, I know this isn't cookinglight.com!): I doubled the sauce, added extra mustard, used brandy instead of cognac (was all that i had on hand), added 3 cloves of garlic, only used 1/2 c. cream (instead of 1.5 c for doubling sauce), only lightly buttered top of noodles after dished up (instead of the 4 tbsp called for), seared beef for just over 2 min. (instead of 4 min) and still ended up being med/medium-well, instead of the medium-rare i'd have preferred, mushroom absorbing liquid time was much less than called for. Did this end up being "classic BS", probably not, but I would definitely make my own version again!

This is so good! The dill was like a revelation. Seriously, don't leave it out. I made it first when I bought a whole tenderloin. I used the little bits that I trimmed off the loin. I have since made it successfully with less noble cuts.

I used this with leftover flank steak, and beef boullion, and omitted the mushrooms. My 10-year-old loved it despite haveing "beef stroganoff" at a friends and hating it. I briefly sauteed my already cooked steak to get the brown bits. I didn't have shallots, so I used sweet onion and garlic. Oh, and I used sherry rather than cognac, and my cream had turned so I used sour cream. Still, a great weekday meal - very quickly!

I bought beef tenderloin that was on sale last week, sliced some of it up for this and saved the rest for steaks. I took the advise of other reviewers and made extra sauce. Excellent idea. Only a few small modifications to the recipe. I used low fat sour cream and I used Sherry instead of Cognac. I had to thicken up the sauce a bit with some cornstarch because of the low fat sour cream. All worked beautifully though and my family loved it.

Rating: 4
Great recipe! Everyone loved it. I made it EXACTLY as written, except (don't the "excepts" make you laugh?) - I too use bourbon instead of cognac because we don't keep cognac - I used fresh mushrooms, quartered and sauteed in butter - I used very inexpensive (tough) beef, so it needs to stew, so I browned it, did the onions, added all of the liquids and simmered it for a couple of hours. Then re-added the mushrooms, sour cream and so on, warmed and served

Rating: 4
This is fantastic stuff! I didn't have cognac so used some quality sherry that I have in the liquor cabinet. And I had to add a couple tablespoons of sour cream since I didn't have quite enough creme fraiche. Skipped the dill since my herbs are dead and gone and I totally spaced buying any at the store this morning. Which just goes to show that it is a great basic recipe and easily changed up a bit to accommodate tastes and available ingredients. It is too rich for us to eat on a regular basis but it will definitely be made again.

Rating: 4
Yum, yum, yum. This was great, although some of the time measurements were a little off (less time for the step where mushrooms absorb liquid, more time for the cognac and beef broth to reduce). However, the taste was worth it. Also, I felt this easily made six or more servings, rather than the stated four.

Rating: 3
I made this a few years back with the whipping cream as opposed to the cf and was surprised my picky husband really liked it (he does not like mustard or saucy dishes). Yesterday I found myself with too much left over pot roast (Basic Pot Roast - this site), some fresh dill in the frig and remembered this dish. My changes this go round were few: low fat sour cream instead of whipping cream, brandy instead of cognac because that's what I had, some cornstarch mixed with beef broth to thicken it up. The mustard and dill are a must and if you're concerned about the former, don't put in as much. Maybe not a true stroganoff, but it was better than yesterday's pot roast.

Rating: 3
Good recipe, but I also increased the amount of sauce significantly and substituted white wine for cognac, and shiitake mushrooms for white mushrooms as that's all I had on-hand. I increased the amount of dill and the amount of dijon mustard as well, and added a bit of flour to the sauce to thicken it up. Very good!

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe numerous times and while this recipe has pretty much all the components of being delicious. I have changed this recipe a bit over time to suit my familys taste. Most all reviews say to double the sauce, I couldn't agree more. In fact, I have that written down on my recipe and then crossed out with triple or quadruple the sauce for 4 people, but we love the sauce so that may be excessive for most. I now use onions instead of shallots, mainly because I never have them on hand. While I use the whipping cream we also add in almost an equal amount of sour cream. Also, we use about 3 times the dijon and we don't add the dill at all. I do use the cognac, but if I don't have it on hand also use bourbon. This is one of our all time favorite meals now. It is funny how people make the comment that if you change a recipe, you can't really rate it...well that is true to a point. While the first time I made this dish exactly by the directions it was just ok, but now that I have the "base" recipe and have tweaked it to our liking it is a family favorite. Also, I agree with other posters, next time I am adding in some worcestershire sauce too.

I make this all the time, usually substituting sherry, red wine or worcestershire sauce for the cognac and 3/4 cup of sour cream for the creme fraiche. I use crimini mushrooms also. Everyone I make it for says it's the best beef stroganoff they've ever had.

Rating: 3
I offer this review cautiously because I also made changes in-line with other comments: 1 1/2 lb sirloin, substituted onion & garlic for shallots, sour cream for creme fraiche, used 1/3 cup brandy, added 3 T Worcestershire, xtra Dijon, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. My comment is mostly about the dill: I found that dill is called for in other Stroganoff recipes. Instead of eliminating it, I cut the amount by 2/3. It added a very nice, subtle background flavor. The end result was excellent. Next time, I'll bump the dill up to 1/2 that called for; and, I am not a huge fan of dill because (IMO) it can easily over- power. I've rated the basic recipe a 3 and will make it again; but, adding the flavors noted pushes it to 3.5. Will also try Cremini next time. The biggest change I made was adding Worcestershire; and, I think the dish needed it. But, this substantially alters the flavor and makes my review of this recipe unfair.

Rating: 3
This is definitely going to become my go-to recipe for Beef Stroganoff. I left out the dill and used sour cream in place of the creme fraiche, and it came out excellent. Based on the reviews here, I made 50% more sauce than the recipe calls for, and that turned out to be a good call.

Rating: 0
I made a few substitutions and additions, so I won't rate the recipe, but I thought it was very good. First, I used just under half the amount of beef, and I bought a package that had already been cut into strips and labelled "stroganoff" at whole foods. It was likely a cheap cut, but it was high quality because it was organic and 100% grass fed. I thought it was plenty of meat. I also reduced the butter just a bit to 4.5 Tbs total, but otherwise I made the full recipe. Substitutions were: crimini instead of button mushrooms, old red wine instead of cognac, whole sheep's milk yogurt instead of creme fraiche, and a mix of homemade beef and veggie broth instead of canned. The beef broth had been made from a corned brisket, so it had a bit of briney/pickly eastern european flavor to it that went well with the dish. Finally, I added 2 cloves of garlic in with the shallot. Yum! I'm sure it would still be great with the canned beef broth, but I'd definitely use a more flavorful mushroom, and probably add some garlic.

Rating: 3
Used this recipe in combo with the Joy of Cooking recipe. Their recipe calls for sirloin tip which was tender, flavorful and cheap (on sale for $1.99/lb.). Used a 1 large onion, more cognac, sour cream, crimini mushrooms, beef stock,tons of pepper, a little cornstarch to thicken the thin sauce and no dill. Used only a tbsp. of dijon but should have used more. Overall it was good but not fantastic. Kinda bland and lacked ummph. Next time will add more mustard, a dash of worchestershire sauce, garlic, fuller flavored mushrooms and maybe some mild herbs.

Delicious! Bought the filet at Cosco for $9/lb (excellent quality meats), then splurged on wild mushrooms (clamshells, trumpets, forest) at Whole Foods (where the filet sold for $27/lb!). I've made it once with wild and once with button mushrooms, and liked the wild better for the texture and earthiness. The cognac is essential to the flavor, I wouldn't substitute. I cut down the mustard just a smidge. Wow! It was so good, we had the leftovers for breakfast the next day.

Fantastic! But expensive! If you use a good tenderloin this can be a $100 dish to make... but man is the meat so, so tender and delicious. For everyday use ribeye on sale as has been mentioned, but for special occasions, spring for the tenderloin!

It was my husbands birthday and he wanted Beef Stroganoff. While it killed me to use rib eye steak, creme fraiche, heavy cream, butter etc., it was to die for. I took some of the reviewers suggestions; thank you very much. My market carries these fabulous mushrooms "wood" something, they feel like fluffy felt with an incredible woodsy, earthy aroma. A recent house guest from Austria brought me some Hungarian Paprika to use over the top at serving time which I think really put it over the edge! I will definitely make this again when I want to impress someone.

Rating: 3
This was FAB - but I had to contend with what I had on hand. There was some beef of dubious origin (hubby bought meat REALLY on sale and there was lots of "stuff" to trim) so I thought that a long simmer might be the best way to go. I put the broth and mustard in my crock-pot and cranked it up to high. I ended up adding more mustard so I probably had about 1/3 cup in there. Needed some tartness. The meat got seared with olive oil over pretty high heat, then set to the side to rest in a bowl (not sure why they specify a baking sheet??? Let the pan cool off for a couple of minutes to medium and then added about 1 Tbs olive oil to gently saute an onion and garlic mix (no shallots). After a couple of minutes (soft, but not browning) I tossed in mushrooms that I had cut into quarters (anticipating the long crock-pot time). Cooked this at medium to med-hi for a couple of minutes to get the mushrooms glossy. Added at least 1/4 cup of sherry (no cognac in the house) and tossed that around for only a minute or so until it was frisky. Put the meat back in to get the juices all chummy with each other and warm the meat back up. I waited for the liquid to cook down just a bit, then tossed it all into the crock-pot and left it on hi for 2-3 hours. Taste intermittently to make sure seasoning is ok. Right before serving, I added my sour cream (no creme fraiche - remember this is peasant food) and blended it gently over medium heat before serving over Kasha. WOW!!!

A HIT!! We will definately have this one agian. Even our 19 month old daughter devoured it. I did make some changes only because I was working with what was in my house. They are as followed: No butter, I used only a total of 6 Tbls of Olive Oil, I added 1 Tbls of minced Garlic to the onions, I used baby bellas (great flavor) I did not have Cognac so I used 2Tbls of semi-sweet red wine and 1Tbls Whiskey, 1/2 cup of sour cream instead of creme fraiche and spicey brown mustard instead of dijon. I used Wacky Mac, because we did not have egg noodles and added parsley to the noodles with the olive oil. YUMMY and PERFECT!!

After reading all the rave reviews, I decided to make this and it was a let down. My mom always made a delicious stroganoff and this just couldn't hold a candle - it was soupy, the meat did not have time to tenderize bc of the short cook time, and all in all, the flavor was not that great. I am usually fairly adventurous with spices, but I thought the dill contributed nothing and left an odd aftertaste. If I make it again, I will use 1/4 whipping cream, 1/2 cup sour cream, no dill, more onion/shallot, more cognac, reserve the mushrooms until the last 15 minutes so they dont get too mushy, and cook on low for enough time to make the beef tender and melt-in-your-mouth. Also, my mom always used a dash of nutmeg and it gives a good flavor - much more so than the dill.

Rich and delicious. Used ribeye instead of tenderloin; added a *tiny* squeeze of lemon at the end to brighten the flavor and bring out the mustard.

I love this recipe. I have made it several times, mostly with meat balls because of my kids, and it always turns out good. The sauce is excellent. On one occasion I made it with sour cream and sherry, as I didn't have creme fraiche and cognac handy, it turned out great too.

This is an awesome recipe. I usually use Flat Iron Steaks which work out very well if you can find them. Ralphs always carries them and they are just as tender as a tenderloin. The Dijon and the Cognac give it a nice subtle background taste which my family loves. Don't be taken back by the Dill, it's a must as far as I'm concerned.

Made as written, this recipe is perfection. But, may I suggest a slightly different version? Subistitute a good quality bourbon for the cognac and omit the mustard and dill. My mother use to make it this way when I was little and the neighbors from a block over would stop by to see what smelled so delish!

This recipe is a crowd pleaser. I have cooked this several times and it never fails to earn the yummy reviews. I use sour cream when creme fraiche is not available. Substituted one cup of wine and reduced it to half and Knorr demi-glace for beef stock. I prefer using thin strips of fresh portbello mushrooms. It gives this dish a different twist.

An excellent, cozy recipe that I've made several times. I've also made some adjustments, depending on what I had on hand: You don't need this much meat, for four servings you could use half that much. Doubling, or even tripling the sauce is also good--depends on how "saucy" you like your dish. I used sherry instead of cognac, and sour cream instead of creme fraiche. Very good!

I tend to add a little red wine to stroganoff which seems to perk it up a bit (or maybe that's just me I'm perking up with it?!). Also, to update this dish, I like to use portabella mushrooms, which I cut into long stips. The texture and size seems to work better than button mushrooms, too. This is also good to do when making chicken marsala, another all time favorite dish of mine.

We routinely have grilled sirloin once every couple weeks, and always cook one extra, leaving it rare. Cool it in the fridge, slice it thin, and use it in place of the tenderloin. It makes an awesome substitute at a fraction of the price. Plus, the grilling adds a subtle dimension to the flavor of the dish.

i have had bad luck in the past with trying to make a healthy version of Beef Stroganoff so I gave up. This mean a$$ version is fabulous but by no means healthy but that is why it tastes so good. I decided not to mess with the recipe and made it as is. The only thing I did add was another Tbls of dijon and a dash of worstershire sauce. I will make this for dinner guests for sure. The creme fraiche gives it a kick over regular old sour cream. Goes wonderful with Shiraz too! thank you for this recipe!

To Venezuelan in Germany: I usually triple the recipe, so it would make 12 servings (I have a big family). If tenderloin is too expensive, I sometimes use skirt steak and just cook it a little longer. Take it easy on the liquids, too, until you see if the sauce is as thick as you like it. I also sometimes add a little rosemary. I think it gives it a nice flavor.

My 3 fussy teens really liked this recipe, however, they all asked if I would go back to slow cooking the tenderloin next time. I have always slow-cooked tenderloin on low all day and the beef gets so tender that way. Otherwise, I'd follow the recipe exactly as is. It had such great flavor!

Just tried this recipe and it was delicious. My girlfriend is Russian and makes it the 'traditional' way with sour cream but I think this was tastier. In regards to hamptonguy, people are reviewing and critiquing but also including different ways to take this dish to a whole other level in terms of taste and preparation. I find these extra little bits to be very helpful especially if I don't have the palate for a certain ingredient or just want to see other ways of preparing a dish. That's the beauty of cooking, you can take a simple stated recipe and change it to be anything and everything you want it to be and more. To those of you who are including your versions and/ or modifications, keep them coming because there are endless ways to prepare food, some good, some bad, and just like beauty, it's all in the eye (or in this case, tongue) of the beholder.

The variations stated in this recipe from the more classic version of the dish are very satisfying. I would make it again with no changes. I must also state though that there have been some very questionable substitutions to this recipe. To be blunt-if you are reviewing a recipe-please review THE recipe. It's one thing if you believe that a particular ingredient is not to your liking or the cooking time didn't work for you. It's entirely different when you review a recipe and state that you substituted 4 ingredients, several of which are an integral part and then proceed to review/critique. One example would be to state that you substituted lamb for beef. Sorry, but it's called beef stroganoff. Its only a matter of fairness to the person/editor/writer who submitted the recipe.

This was insanely rich!

(I ate the left overs for lunch of course. How many calories does guilt burn?) I think next time (in 20pds) I'll use sour cream or cut the dairy down a bit.

This is also one of my favorite recipes. I feel that the Cognac and Dill is what makes this recipe better than the rest. I to had trouble with it being runny,so I think I will do what SteveM advised and reduce the liquid down more. I also have used Rib Eye as a good substitue for the costly Tenderloin and than used shitakie mushrooms as a extra bonus. Anyway, great recipe, its a keeper.

Personally, I see no need for the beef broth. I use heavy cream, I also add one whole red bell pepper (sliced in thin wedges). It not only adds color, but also compliments the Paprika well. As a side, I prefer Potatoes Boulangere (as found on epicurious.com).

This is a really tasty recipe that is easy to prep and easy to execute. I substituted the creme fraiche with sour cream and added a sliced vidalia onion in addition to about 2T of worcestershire sauce. I might dredge the beef next time....the sauce towards the end was still a tad on the thin side. It's even better the next day.

Absolutely delicious every time! I'm been making this recipe for several years. It's turned into a family favorite. One hint - The comment from StevenM on 2/15 needs to be read by anyone having problems getting the sauce to thicken. I had given up on a thick sauce (I didn't care since it tasted just fine regardless). After reading his comments, I realized I was not letting the broth reduce enough. Now it's even more perfect than before!!

Rating: 1
This dish turned out okay, but I don't think you could really call it Beef Stroganoff. The Russian derived dish, I think, always includes sour cream. I used leftover chateaubriand, so I added the meat at the very end to warm it through. For leftovers, it was fine, but I don't think I'd make it again. I don't like using really good cuts of meat and then swim it in sauce...just my opinion.

Rating: 2
I made this dish exactly as the recipe said, only I halved the dill because I really do not like dill. Without the fresh dill, it literally tasted like nothing. Very very bland. I'm sure that if you like dill and add the full amount, this will be delicious. But for those who are thinking of making the recipe sans dill, find another recipe that suits you.

Rating: 3
I made it exactly per the recipe except I used game. I simmered the game for 4 hours at the point where you add the beef broth and cognac. After it was tender, I stirred in the whipping cream and mustard. I did thicken it a bit with some cornstarch--- as I was reading from users that the consistency was thin. The taste was pretty good. Good change from using the standard sour cream element. I assume using this is more to the original recipe. I would like to try it with the tenderloin. The cognac is a must.

Rating: 2
A recipe should be made exactly as written for the first time in order to write a review but I would like to share a couple of comments on a slightly modified rendition that we made. We used turkey and organic sour cream rather than the beef and creme fraiche. As another reviewer had indicated, the sauce was thin (even though we tried to reduce it). We wanted a full flavour, so a couple of fresh shiitake mushrooms were added as well. Enjoyed the meal but will make adjustments next time. Worchestire sauce and dried chantrelles, perhaps.

Rating: 2
This recipe was good on the verge of great. I think I must have done something wrong because by sauce was very thin. Other than that it was very tasty. DON'T SKIP THE COGNAC as some reviewers have done. It really adds a fabulous something and you can buy a mini-bottle for $2.50 at any liquor store. Also, have some sour cream on hand for garnishment.

Made a few changes- used both white mushrooms and cremini, used brandy for Cognac and had to sub sour cream for creme fraiche. It was very good although next time I will use a homemade beef stock versus canned. It can really use the back end strength of high quality beef stock. The dill was really nice. Served it with Cabernet Sauvignon which worked well. Very easy and worth making again and again.

I have never been a fan of stroganoff, actually have never liked any I tried. After running out of quick meal ideas for my family I decided to give it a try. Made the recipe with one change, I used 3 large filets a little less than 2lbs. total. It was plenty meat for my family and all loved the meal. I would definitely make again as it was quick and easy for a weekday meal and was well recieved by my children.

This is wonderful. Almost 4 stars. ade this for 2 people (with leftovers) so halved the meat, but, based upon previous comments, doubled the sauce (we generally prefer a generous amount of sauce) and thought the meat to sauce ratio was perfect. Used 3/4 cup sour cream and 3/4 cup heavy cream combined instead of doubling the creme frache. Sauce did not thicken as well as would have liked so I made a roux and added a bit to the simmering mushroooms. Served with buttered parsley noodles and asparagus salad from fried chicken and spring salad recipe on this site. Fabulous.

I made this recipe exactly as written except I cut the beef amount in half (it was for two people). It is SOOOO good. Just make it, you will love it. The sauce is amazing, the beef is worth the $$$, the noodles are the perfect match. I have no complaints. And I really hate dill but added it just to be true to the recipe and it's great. Used sour cream, it was great. It looked thin at first but thickened up upon cooling slightly. Overall really excellent and comes together so fast requiring no skill or extra time. Don't skip the cognac as it's an integral flavor component!

This is a keeper, and it was quick and easy but company worthy!!!!

I made this recipe exactly as written. My only challenge was that I let the beef sit too long while I entertained guests and then was afraid of letting it get too well-done, so it cooled off too fast. Other than that, I've been looking for a GREAT Stroganoff recipe for years and this definitely qualifies!

I made this dish last night and it's as good as everyone says it is. Upon further review (tasting the next day), I would eliminate the dijon all together as I didn't think it added much to the overall flavor. The dill is absolutely a must that truly brings out the flavors of the sour cream, cognac and shallots. I took everyone else's advice and used a full can of College Inn beef broth for the sauce and it turned out to provide the perfect amount of extra sauce. Since this was a weekday meal, I used standard button mushrooms. Finally, I used chuck stewing beef and the recipe turned a lowly cut of beef into the star of the show!! I will definitely be adding this recipe to my collection!!

I would absolutely make this recipe again, my kids loved it, and I plan to make it for my husband tonight! Definitely at least double the amount of sauce. I used the creme fraiche (from Trader Joe's) and found it to be wonderful.

Yep, this was fabulous. After reading all other reviews and looking at what I had in the cupboard: added a clove of minced garlic, used 1/2 button mushrooms, 1/2 baby portabellos and--I think this is at the root of other cooks' variants--used a mixture of sour cream, marscapone (!) and skim milk instead of whipping cream. This is the step that determines the amount/thickness of sauce (along with the amount of stock you use). Marscapone was an odd choice, but I had it in the fridge. Next time, I'll use something looser for this step and add milk to reach the consistency of sauce desired. (Made it with tenderloin; will try other meats when not feeling so flush!)

Rating: 4
Wow! This was a fabulous rendition of an old favorite. The flavors in this dish just meld together amazingly well. I was sceptical about the dill, but it was a must. I used a cheaper cut of meat, but I cooked it in my pressure cooker with garlic and pepper until tender. The sauce I doubled. I agree with others that there was too much meat. I would either decrease the meat or quadruple the sauce. That would also be enough for 2 meals (we like leftovers).

Linda in Los Angeles 12/17/06: Quadrupled recipe for 18 servings and followed recipe exactly, except with addition of 2 chopped garlic cloves (not enough). Used flat iron steak for meat which was fine. Way too much liquid from meat/mushroom combination which occurred after browning. Used 1/2 button mushrooms, 1/4 shitake, and 1/4 portabella. Had to pour off 2 cups meat/mushroom juices and there still was more than enough liquid. I would have liked a slightly thicker sauce. Would have helped a lot if recipe had suggested "x" teaspoons of salt "or to taste". I had to salt the dish at the table to bring out more flavor (which I don't like to do). Sorry but I can't go along with so many rave reviews. Am going to revert to my prior recipe that uses some tomato paste in this dish.

Except for substituting sirloin, I followed the recipe exactly. The sauce was amazingly delicious (loved the dijon and cognac), but there was just too much beef. Next time, I'll make it with only 1 to 1.25 pounds of meat. Also, I cut the steak as directed, but I'd like more delicate slices. Will definitely spring for filet next time.

The day before I did everything but add the creme fraiche (which I think makes this dish) dijon and dill. I mixed the mushrooms and beef together and let them sit overnight. Perfection!

Rating: 4
This is pretty much the stroganoff recipe for which I've been searching, with just the right flavors and richness. I did make a few modifications: only used half the amount of beef called for, used equal parts white, baby bella, and shiitake mushrooms, used about half of a small yellow onion in addition to the shallots, used sour cream plus a little bit of heavy cream in place of creme fraiche, and used regular brandy in place of cognac. I served the dish over extra broad egg noodles tossed with butter and fresh parsley (the noodles are a must for me), and thought it was excellent. I will say that the amount of sauce the recipe made was barely enough for the 1.25 lbs. of beef that I used, and certainly wouldn't have been enough had I used the full 2.5 lbs. called for. I'll probably increase the sauce ingredients by 50% next time, still using only 1.25 lbs. of beef. Finally, I echo the others who have stressed *not* skimping on the quality of the meat; the extreme tenderness of the beef tenderloin is crucial to the finished product.

Perhaps the best stroganoff I've had. As a man I had to increase the meat (used 1 filet per person but had leftovers). Added minced garlic (2 cloves). Substituted a fine old Madeira for the cognac and used sour cream as a substitute for whipped cream and doubled the amount to make more sauce for the extra meat. The mustard and dill are inspired additions. My daughter who is rather finicky about steak dishes cleaned her plate.

I thought this dish was excellent. In addition to the shallots, I also sauteed with it 2 finely chopped garlic cloves (which i believe makes any dish taste better) and 1 finely chopped small white onion. Creme fraiche/sour cream is perfect to make the sauce nice and thick (I agree that whipping cream is not nearly think enough). Lastly, I didn't have any Cognac at hand, but as "Accucook" says, it is perfectly fine without it too!

For the cook who would like a different meat option, I suggest using a roundsteak or 'London Broil' if you'd like something more economical. Personally, if you're covering it with a sauce you certainly don't have to use the most expensive cut here. But this is my opinion only. I hope it helps. :-)

I've made a beef stroganoff recipe occasionally for years, but I was never completely thrilled with it, so I finally took a look for a new one here. I will tell you without hesitation that this is the only one I will make from now on. I followed the resume as written, except used sour cream and some heavy cream. I find it hard to imagine beef stroganoff without sour cream, but I may time the creme fraiche next time since everything else about this resume was so good. A bunch of little things elevates this dish to a whole new level. The beef stock, especially, made it much more savory. The better cut of meat, the cognac, and the dill all work to make this recipe much more delicious than my old one.

My husband said this was the best beef stroganoff he has ever had -- mainly because of the addition of the fresh dill. I made a couple of changes: sour cream instead of the creme fresh, half red wine/half chicken stock instead of the beef stock/cognac, and extra mushrooms. Definitely comfort food!

Oh, this recipe takes me back more years than I wish to confess. Then, it was the height of sophistication for the home cook. Much has changed in the cooking world since then but this is still a stellar dish. Any good cut of beef will do. I subsitute equal parts of garlic and onion for the shallots and omit the beef broth -- mostly because I dislike the flavour. I also use sour cream as this what I remember from the old days!

This recipe was okay. It wasn't the most flavorful that I've made. I made this recipe twice--once strictly according to the recipe and once with a crock pot cooked chuck roast. They were very different but the chuck roast was more flavorful (more rustic finished dish). I personally like dill but I would cut back some in this recipe. It was just as good the next day. I like the recipe, but don't love it.

I did not love this recipe, because the sauce did not have as much flavor as the dish my mom makes from when I was a child. Her recipe calls for a half cup of white wine instead of cognac or brandy and hers has 2 Tblsp. of tomato paste instead of mustard. Next time I will modify this recipe to get more tangy flavor from the sauce. I also used ribeye steaks (no bone) instead of tenderloin ($24 a pound, no way, Jose!) and it came out tender and flavorful.

I made this for my mother in law's birthday party dinner and everyone loved it! The sauce was so delicious and I was stuffed, but I just couldn't stop eating it! I used boneless sirloin steak, brandy and a mixture of 3/4 sour cream to 1/4 whipping cream. I wanted 6 generous servings with one serving left over, so I used 3lbs steak, then doubled the recipe and then doubled the sauce again. Loved the dill and the mustard was a nice unexpected addition. Make this one!

This was a unique, tasty dish. I'm not sure it is for everyone, but I enjoyed it. Definitely use the best cut of meat and you can't go wrong. Also, make sure to use only a pound or so of beef, or it will be way too much.

Finally, a REALLY GOOD beef stroganoff recipe! I've made so many versions of this dish and this one is the best. I think the cognac makes the difference as far as flavor is concerned, but in a pinch any other good brandy would work. I also used sour cream and it worked out fine.

This is a fabulous recipe -- rich and succulent. I was able to find precut beef tenderloin labeled as "stroganoff strips" (presumably cut from tenderloin end pieces too small to sell as whole roasts) for much less than a tenderloin roast would have been, and I'm very glad I did. The tenderness of the beef is a huge part of this dish's appeal. I made a few changes based on what I already had in the pantry -- onions (cut into half-rings) for the shallots, sour cream for the creme fraiche, and dry sherry for the Cognac. The flavors of the dill and the mustard make this recipe stand out as something special. It's important to let the beef broth and sherry/Cognac cook down to almost nothing before adding the pan juices and sour cream, or the final sauce will be watery. When the sour cream forms the body of the sauce, it develops a wonderfully silky texture that clings to the beef, mushrooms, and noodles.

Rating: 4
This is wonderful! So few ingredients and so little time. I'll get a lot of use out of this recipe in the future.

Rating: 4
the scent of the mushrooms cooking in the cognac & broth blend is enough to make you swoon! I used about 1 1/2 lbs of filet and followed the other ingredients as directed. I did however add the crème fraîche and let the sauce thicken about 5 minutes prior to adding the filet strips. I also recommend al dente brand of dried pasta - the spinach noodles add a lovely contrasting color and they cook very quickly. This recipe is decadant and scrumptous, perfect to serve for company or a special occassion. The reviews are a riot - I've always maintained the epicurious users are a bit more sophisticated than other sites but the lady with the costco frozen meatballs takes the cake.

I made this for my husband's Christmas holiday party. It was delicious, and I received many complements. I made a few substitutions: sirloin steak instead of the tenderloin, sherry intead of the cognac,and since I couldn't find button mushrooms, I used large mushrooms cut into 6-8 pieces.

Rating: 4
This dish was delicious and a huge hit with dinner guests. It's expensive, but worth it. Following the advice of several cooks, I used a little less tenderloin (2-1/4 pounds) and made 1-1/2 times the sauce called for, and the proportions were perfect. I followed the directions exactly and got the predicted results. It's a dish that's somewhat labor-intensive, but I had cut everything up beforehand, and my guests sat in the kitchen and we chatted while I cooked. Then we enjoyed this wonderful dish with a great Cabernet. This is definitely on my list of favorite recipes.

Rating: 4
Very nice flavor! I made it for company and it was inhaled. I couldn't find creme fraiche in my local grocery so I used one of the recipes on the epicurious site--if you do this just make sure to plan well in advance! Anyway, the stroganoff came out great--too many egg noodles so cut the recipe down. Also, not enough sauce so either make extra or cut the meat down!

Rating: 3
Classic and basic. There is a big diference between using creme fraiche or cream. the creme fraiche is closer to the sour cream used in the original and gives a better consistency. Also, if you sear the beef in duck fat instead of oil (available for not too much money from d'Artagnan) you will get much better flavor and texture.

This recipe was fabulous and I will definately make it again. I would not cook the beef sauce down as much as the recipe indicated and I used the whole 7 oz container of the cream. Hopefully Patricianm tries the recipe agian - it is well worth it.

Not an impressive recipe. Granted, I used top round steak instead of tenderloin, and sour cream instead of creme fraiche or cream, but sour cream is classic for stroganoff! I had high hopes, but was not impressed.

We loved this recipe too.Yum! My husband said it is the best Stroganoff he has ever eaten! A definite keeper. Followed it except I wanted to use up leftover Roast Prime Rib so I am sure the flavour would be even better with the filet done in the pan. The Cognac step is a must as is the fresh dill.I too added the touch of horseradish. We are taking this recipe with us to the ski condo at Mont Tremblant,QC to do for friends. It is so easy once the prep is done.Thank you all of you who take the time to send in your take on the recipe. The extra ideas add so much to the original and it is interesting to know where all these Epicurious cooks come from!

Great recipe that strays from the usual stroganoff recipes. I used whiskey instead cognac, dried dill instead of fresh, and sour cream. I took note of everyone else's suggestion to half the meat, but kept the sauce the same. It was great but I wish the sauce was a little more diluted as it tasted a little concentrated.

I made this for dinner tonight and not only was it delicious and easy to make, even my picky 11-year-old liked it. Afterwards I realized that I had totally forgotten to add the paprika and I can only imagine how much better this dish would have tasted with it.

A very fine meal by all respects, it pleased both myself a self professed gourmet eater, and my boyfriend a self professed "meat and potatoes and keep it simple" eater. Based on review comments and past experience, I used only 1 lb of beef, and about 9oz of egg noodles. Otherwise I followed all ingredient quantities and cooking time instructions to a tee, and it came out a very well balanced dish serving about 3-4 adults. 2-1/2 lbs of meat would be way too much, and I always find epicurious recipies are too heavy on pasta or noodle quantities. I also used rib eye sliced very thin, because tenderloin was a bit pricey for a weeknight dinner, and sherry in place of cognac since I didn't have any on hand. Although I'm sure the tenderloin would be more tender than rib eye, I do no think the dish dramatically suffered from my substitutions. The dill is a very key flavor to the dish, and is delicious, so it should not be left out, unless you absolutely cannot stand the taste of dill. Fresh parsley is also a nice addition.

This recipe is absolutely flawless and very easy to make once everything is sliced and diced. I made it with the tenderloin and now I don't think I could substitute anything else in its place. I did double the sauce and used baby portabella mushrooms. Using 2 and a half pounds of meat, I got about six servings. I served the stroganoff on top of buckwheat or kasha as we call it in Russia. Entire family pronounced the stroganoff not only to be authentic but the very best they have ever had. In fact, I already have a request to make it again for the weekend.

the sauce part of this recipe is amazing! my household cannot afford tenderloin and my husband does not like mushrooms, so I have made many variations on this, including plain mushroom (when he was away). last night I made it with beef from a leftover crockpot roast and it was amazing. i'm sure its even better with tenderloin, but alas, I may not taste it that way for a few years. this is going in our regular rotation. even if you don't make the beef part of this, the sauce is a must-try. its even good on chicken.

This is so so so easy, and honestly the sauce alone would warrant four forks. I made it as directed except parsley instead of dill. Wow.

Delicious. I made some changes though. Did not use butter, cognac, dill. Instead marinated 1.5 lb tenderloin in a cup of red whine, salt and pepper for a day to tenderize and flavor meat. Used leftover marinade in place of cognac. Added paprika to sauteed shallots and cooked in sauce rather than sprinkling it at the end. Also, used light sour cream and thickened sauce with small amount of red whine and cornstarch.

Very good! Best stroganoff recipe that I have ever tasted! I have no other use for Cognac, so I did not purchase it for this recipe. Nevertheless, it came out great! My wife and I couldn't wait to have it again! The french style sour cream (creme fraiche) is much smoother than normal sour cream...a nice touch. I used an entire 8oz. container rather than the 3/4 cup that the recipe calls for. I do not believe that 4 servings is correct. As-is, but with the amount of beef called for reduced to a half pound, the recipe produces 2 moderate servings; perfect for two people. Two and a half pounds of beef is way too much unless the remainder of the recipe is scaled accordingly. Three and a half forks would have been more appropriate.

Rating: 3
This is a good recipe. My only complaint is that the meat tastes dry and dull, but the sauce was great. The only substitutions I made was to use brandy (I didn't have cognac) and I used dried dill instead of fresh. If I can find a way to give the meat some juicy flavor, it would be a 4 fork recipe.

Fabulous. I followed the recipe to a T, other using less meat (still had piles of leftovers). The sauce is delicious enough to double. If your sauce is runny, you're simply not following directions. The beef broth must reduce to nothing, just glazing the mushrooms. (Watch that it doesn't burn.) Then the creme fraiche and mustard will thicken up considerably. Meatballs? Mushroom soup? Mangos? Cooking the meat for an hour? I can only imagine the conversation in your guests' cars after dinner.

Beef stroganoff is my hubby's favorite dish.....and this didn't disappoint. It is the best recipe I've come across. I did double the sauce, but next time, I'd use half the meat as well....one pound would be more than sufficient. (The tenderloin was worth it....husband mentioned 3 times how great the meat was. Maybe reducing meat to 1 lb. would help folks spring for the tenderloin). I used 8 oz. of fresh small mushrooms halved, and deglazed the pan with wine. I used 1/2 of the whipping cream and a full 8oz container of sour cream. Sauce was a bit thinner than we like, so I mixed a small spoonful of cornstarch with a bit of wine and got precisely the desired consistency. Will DEFINITELY make it again.

This was a decadant and yummy dish. I used crème fraîche and since it was only for 2 people - I used about 1.25 lbs of filet and kept the sauce ingredients as indicated. I used half button mushrooms and half criminis. I added about 1/4 tsp of creamed horseradish as the sauce was reducing. This is a wonderful date or company dish!

I made this as part of a Russian fest for my bookgroup, which read Anna Karenina. It was a big hit. I used 2 lbs of sirloin, agreeing with others that tenderlion (filet mignon) is too expensive and in this era of diet-consciousness, people don't eat big quantities of meat. I used creme fraiche (easy to make, but inexpensive at TJ's). and a lot of people make it with sour cream. For the book complaining about the thin sauce, I think whipping cream is too light. Do double the sauce, perhaps even the shrooms. For a fun menu option, make the jellied borscht (i.e. borscht jello), a quick item in the new Gourmet cookbook.

Rating: 2
I was very disappointed in this recipe, given the rave reviews. I used sirloin because tenderloin was $18/lb (!), and used light whipping cream because that's what I could find. The resulting sauce was very thin. It tasted fine, but nothing special for all the calories in whipping cream (and expense of buying cognac!) Any advice on where I went wrong?

Rating: 3
A very delicious dish but with one question: 2-1/2 pounds of meat plus all the other ingredients for only 4 people?! Too much for us. I used 1-1/2 pounds tenderloin for 4 people and had a dab left over. The creme fraiche was a wonderful addition and I did 1-1/2 recipes of the sauce (but double the shallots). We found that the paprika was an absolute must, and added so much to the flavor of the whole dish (something I wouldn't have thought before). It was a hit. And because I can't afford tenderloin often, I'll use a good sirloin or rib-eye next time. But oh was that tenderloin good! I also cut it in narrower strips than called for.

Rating: 3
Excellent!!! This was terrific. My husband and daughter loved it.I would slice the meat a bit tinner and make smaller chunks next time. The dill is a perfect touch. I substituted with 1/2 sour cream/ 1/2 whipping cream vs. cf and it was PERFECT! I think this would also be great on buttered biscuits vs noodles. We will make this again.

This recipe is absolutely perfect as written. I've made beef stroganoff before using a different recipe (and it was good), but this was great! My family (kids included) really loved it!

I wish there was an option FOR FIVE FORKS (10 forks?)!!! Stellar recipe. Made it for a few people, who were already full and had zero interest in eating (until I plopped it in front of them). They ended up licking their plates and begging for the leftovers. I followed the recipe, but in addition threw in a bit of red wine (in addition to the cognac/brandy), more FRESH dill, and also a little bit of sour cream (again, in addition to..). I used the best grade/cut of beef I could find. I also didn't use button mushrooms, but cut up some other variety (didn't matter). I also used vegetable broth, instead of beef broth (because I didn't think it would matter, and I was correct). I can't wait to make this again! MMMMMMMMM Served with an excellent red wine -- we were in heaven!

As I didn't have shallots that evening I used onions. Actually, I used 3 big ones :) And, of course, I used more cream (a small cup of soure cream). And I chopped in a tomato. Used more fresh dill. And I substituted the cognac with dry white wine. The result was delicious! And as I don't like noodles with meat, I made mashed potatoes with garlic!

I made this recipe on a very snowy cold night when I did not want to go to the store using ingredients I had on hand. Doubling the sauce was a good tip. I used rib eye steaks that needed to be cooked, sliced into thin strips. I did not have enough cream (or creme fraiche) so I mixed 1 cup heavy cream with 1 cup sour cream. The result was a delicious, thicker sauce with a slight tang to it. It was a great success and enjoyed by all.A good way to feed four on two rather small steaks.

Wonderful stroganoff, definitely needs double the sauce and thickening. The creme fraiche makes a difference in my opinion.

The dill definitely added a nice dimension to the sauce. I did wish I had more sauce though, so doubling it is a good idea. Doesn't reheat that well because the noodles absorb all the sauce, so it should be eaten right after cooking.

Thanks to prior reviewers' advice, I halved the amount of meat and doubled the sauce ingredients; it came out in perfect proportions. Used sirloin instead of tenderloin, which I cut into very thin strips. Used light sour cream instead of creme fraiche or whipping cream.

Sauteed mushrooms and onions, added liquids and was ready to brown meat when I realized my filet was GONE!!! My dog snarfed it! Well, I had all this great sauce and stuff so I browned some buffalo hamburger and added it. My family thought it was wonderful on home-made noodles and were none the wiser. I'm sure it would be fab with the right meat, but it was good even though it was buffalo!

I made this last night and my husband LOVED it. I wish I had served bread to mop up the sauce, which was excellent. I added a batch of duxelles I had in the freezer to the mix and red wine in place of cognac (certainly more than the 2 tbsp called for) to add to the sauce. I also followed the suggestion to marinate the meat first, and dredged the piece in flour to add to the thickness of the sauce. All told, a great dinner.

For a chilly fall night, this is a great recipe. I marinated the beef first with vinegar/Worcestershire/soy sauce/garlic. Added a bit of zip. I had a few other omissions and additions. I increased the mushrooms & onions substantially for more flavor. I also had to use red wine versus the Cognac. However, the biggest test came when I ran out of sour cream; in a pinch, I grabbed light cream and plain yogurt--turned out fine. I also added both horseradish and mustard at the end. Good hearty dish!

I serve this with farfalle. FABULOUS!!

I served this dish to a large group this weekend with a recomended Meritage(turnbull), and it was a huge success.

OK, this is slightly obnoxious, because I didn't actually make this recipe, but it sounds great -- however, I just wanted to share something I have always done with strognoff for 30 years, and that is to add at least a tablespoon of horseradish. It does wonderful things to the flavor.

Made this last night. Easy and good. I used fat free sour cream and vegetable oil instead of butter, and it still tasted yummy.

I have made this delicious dish twice now. It's great! My boyfriend loved it and ate seconds. It's definetely a keeper. One change I made is to serve the meat over rice. It's so good. I think it's actually better than pasta since the dish has so much sauce and the rice absorbs it better than pasta - so you don't miss any of it. I use jazmine rice, but also any other rice would be great. I also marinate the beef for a few minutes with a little vinager, worchester sauce, salt, pepper and garlic. It gives it more flavor even before getting in the pan. Great dish!!

Rating: 4
The best stroganoff recipe ever. I also add one or two T of soy sauce to add a bit more flavor. If you want to thicken the sauce, add a bit of a roux. In a small pan, add two or three tablespoons of butter. When it begins to get hot, add a couple of tablespoons of flour, and whisk until it follows the whisk around the pan. Add stock to thin out roux until it thickens. Add by dropfulls to stroganoff until you reach desired consistency.

FABULOUS! So yummy! What a special birthday dinner! I would cut tenderloin "medallions" next time (you have to cut the strips to eat anyway) and it leaves less of a margin of error - you certainly DON'T want to overcook the beef and much easier to cook. Would probably make more sauce and add more mushrooms, too. I took the advice of other reviewers and substituted sour cream for cream fraise and parsley for dill....and I wouldn't have it any other way. I recommend the crimini mushrooms vs. plain old button mushrooms. We will definitely make this again and again and again! Our guests will be very impressed!

My 18 year old son wanted to know why I hadn't made this for him before! My husband and my friend were almost as enthusiastic.

I used this recipe as a base and then counter-checked it with one of same name in my "Hungarian Ladies of the Lutheran Church" cookbook (circa 1959!) Basically revised as follows: melted one stick butter, added 3-4 large portobellos chopped into large chunks and one large chopped onion. Cook for about 15 minutes. Add beef broth (I also had some duck broth which was VERY good and rich) and the cognac or burgundy. Leave out the mustard, use sour cream and parsley instead of whipping cream and dill. Came out EXCELLENT!

Made 3 times before it turned out to my taste. 1st, followed exactly and didn't like it. End adjustments: Used end-cut tenderloin (much cheaper, same cut!), saute 3 cloves garlic with shallots, add 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper and 1/2 tsp Hot Hungarian paprika w/beef broth, add cornstarch to thicken before creme fraiche, Dijon overwhelmed flavors, omitted it, was the very ingredient throwing everything else off. Great served with homemade spaetzel and sweet-sour red cabbage, or just over rice. Creme fraiche is a fun idea, but sour cream just as good and easier. Add beef very last minute for tenderness and not to overcook. Query: Since when is rating a recipe you use as a base, but find you need to change it "rating your own recipe"? Lighten up!

LUDICROUS! Beef Stroganoff should be made with FRESH STROGANOFF! I didn't see it on the list of ingredients, so this is obviously a scam. Don't be fooled.

Excellent flavours. We used light cream instead of whipping cream and used a bit of corn starch to thicken it up. We simmered the beef in the broth for quite a while before adding the cream.

A dish that is very simple to prepare, although in lieu of creme fraiche I would use sour cream (which has more body) rather than whipping cream. Also, as I was making the dish only for 2 I halved the recipe, and that worked, but the meat was still $28, which surprised me. I'm wondering what lesser cut I could use in the future to prevent sticker shock.

This is the 2nd time I've made this recipe and again it did not disappoint. I used white wine instead of cognac (didn't have any) and also used dried dill instead of the fresh (didn't have any of that either). And I used a mixture of whipping cream and 1/2 and 1/2 and mixed a couple of tablespoons (approx) of flour in (so no problems with it being runny)....sorry I can't give measurements, I have a tendency to "wing it" most of the time. To the cook from Warsaw, Poland, what the H*** is FRESH STROGANOFF? Please explain, since the dictionary on this site explains stroganoff as a dish being named after a 19th century Russian diplomat, Count Paul Stroganov. Perhaps you're missing something in the translation from English to Polish....otherwise, perhaps COOKING LESSONS would be in order. I agree with "most" of the reviews, I would definately make this dish again!

Wonderful flavors! I cater and made this for a dinner buffet. Used cremini and button mushrooms. The sauce is a little runny so added a slurry of water and flour which fixed the problem. Also added some fresh grated nutmeg. Used brandy instead of cognac. Also had to make one serving vegetarian for a client, so used sliced portabellos instead of the meat and didn't add any beef broth. I think it was even better than the meat dish! This freezes beautifully. Just reheat in a 350 degree oven.

Very good. I make some minor changes ; sirloin instead of filet (meat slightly tough); added some celery and garlic salt; add 2 tblspns of flour at end of cooking down mushrooms and only slightly thicken sauce (otherwise there is not enough sauce). Fairly easy to prepare and can be done ahead which I did. Oh yes, and used 1/2 whipping cream and 1/2 sour cream. A potential company dish but will have to work on it a bit.

I read a lot of the reviews before deciding on this recipe, and they were right. It was fabulous. I was looking for this dish because I now have a lot of venison to use, so I marinated it for 24 hours, which made it quite nice. I also used some expensive brandy, which was half the price of cognac in the local LQ, and it had a wonderful flavor and aroma. Our guests liked it too! I'll be eating this dish all winter.

This recipe was along the lines of what I was looking for. The dill gave it a pleasant, mellow flavor at the end. I regret I didn't have cognac, because I'm sure its addition would have been wonderful. Even though we used good meat, the pieces still came out a little tough because I'm paranoid about undercooking meat. If you want more sauce, I wouldn't boil away the broth. I added cornstarch to thicken and keep the sauce. Overall, this still didn't have the traditional stroganoff taste I was looking for (I think I like the sour cream version), but it still was a nice surprise.

Excellent! I used fresh brown mushrooms and brown deli mustard instead, and boiled down the beef stock until it was almost nothing. This left a skimpy amount of sauce, just enough to coat the noodles, but the meat and mushrooms were so full of flavor, it was OK by us.

I have had great success with this recipe. It has plenty of flavor and a is a wonderful warm meal on a cold night.

Try adding a dash of red pepper for a gentle kick of flavor.

I cheated!! I used ready-made meatballs from Costco, quadrupled the sauce, served it in a large bowl alongside a bowl of buttered noodles, a citrus salad (www.lhj.com),to a group of 18.

This can be delicious even when using a cut of beef intended for braising, i.e.round, chuck or shoulder. (Husband brought home a mystery cut). Dredge in flour, braise (brown) in dutch oven, in 1 tab. olive oil & 1 tab. butter, both sides on high heat, e careful not to burn. Season with seasoned salt, garlic powder, onion powder & fresh ground black pepper. Remove beef to cutting board, cut in 1" x 3/8" pieces. Return to pan. Add 1 can (14.5 oz.) beef broth, 1/4 cup red wine, 1 tab. tomato sauce, cover & simmer 1 hour. In a separate pan, saute 1 small chopped onion. Add to beef. After 1 hour, to 3 Tab. flour, add pan juices and stir to form paste. Add back to pan, stir until thick, cook about 5 min. on moderate heat. Turn off heat and set aside. Saute in separate pan, 8 oz. sliced mushrooms in 2 tab. butter (mod. high heat) until brown, add 1 tab. cognac. Before serving, stir in 3/4 cup sour cream, add mushrooms. Serve over narrow curly noodles. Sprinkle with Paprika

Superb! I followed the recipe exactly so that I could give it a fair review. The tenderloin though seemingly extravagant to be layered in sauce was definitely a must. It's tenderness allows the flavors to roll through each taste bud in your mouth, without the distraction of a heavy chew. The creme' fraiche too is a necessary indulgence, it gives the dish a unique but subtle tartness not often found in american dishes. For the non-experimental types, the addition of dill may seem scary, but go for it. Please don't leave out the cognac. It imparts a richness to the dish without a trace of an alcohol flavor. Follow the timing as stated and this will be an excellent dish for you and your guests. Enjoy!

Easy and delicious. Portions aren't very big, so we did a 1 1/2 times recipe. Also, I never follow recipes exactly - I took liberties with several ingredients. It came out fine the way I did it. This will be a staple for our family and for entertaining for a long time!

Yum! The quality of the beef makes this recipe work, so don't skimp. The mustard and dill are a delicious change from the classic sour cream. I made the sauce in the morning and stopped just before adding the cream. At serving time, I seared the beef, reheated the mushrooms, added the cream and continued from there. Quick Christmas dinner!

I just made this last night for a holiday dinner party and it was a terrific success. Don't waste your time trying to use anything but tenderloin - it's worth every penny. I did cut the sauce down by using 3/4 Cup of Low Sodium Beef Broth. Decadent and excellent!

This is a great dish. I have made it several times and alter a little here and there. Different mushrooms, onions, more cream...depends on my mood.

My variation, which I found to be much more savory, was to blend tomato paste and paprika with sourcream and dill -- whipped to a light orange color. That mixture is blended with the onions, mushrooms, the browned meat and a dollop or white wine. Simmering for 10-15 minutes allows the flavors to mingle and the beef to tenderize. Fabulours.

I did like this dish, although it wasn't anything spectacular. My husband liked it much better than the usual variety (from a mix). I didn't have any cognac, so I substituted sherry... I don't know if that made any big difference. I would make this again, but next time maybe I'll invest in a bottle of cognac.

Excellent dish! I own a catering company and have used this for my own dinner parties. Much different (and better) than the one mom used to make. If you cannot budget for tenderloin, sirloin will certainly work, and if that is too expensive...get some stew meat and boil it in beef broth until it's tender. Then, drain and finish off with the sauce that the recipe uses. I've done all of the above...all were wonderful. Brandy works for the Cognac...but adds a bit of a sweet flavor. Also, the previous reviews regarding thinkness are correct. It needs thickening. I'd suggest arrowroot and if you don't have that, a little cornstarch will do.

Rating: 4
I so totally depend on the reviews of the previous cooks and their insightful suggestions. I sauteed 1 1/2 lbs of beef filet tenderloin, 2 large sweet onions, plus the shallots, garlic and mushrooms. I used 3 cans of beef broth and added 1/2 cup sour cream. Definitely increase the amount of cognac and dill. As mentioned by other reviewers, I needed to thicken the sauce with cornstarch. This recipe is absolutely wonderful and not difficult to make.

Rating: 2
Just a tad on the bland side. As this recipe is written the sauce is way to watery. Used a mixture of cold water with a little corn starch to thicken. The consistency was much better. Used a couple of types of mushrooms--shitakes, and button to spruce it up a little. Will have to try with Sour cream.

Really enjoyed making this and everyone raved about it!! Agreed with previous comments about cutting down on the meat - doubled the recipe for 8 people(to get more sauce), but kept the meat at about 1 kilo (2 pounds) and found this was more than enough - also I used rib steak as I felt the tenderloin was just tooooo! expensive. I also added a tiny bit of fresh garlic, and did add a touch of basil, sage and marjorum - from a previous favourite stroganoff recipe. Would definately make again!!

Ok, I must admit I was a little shocked (ok, a LOT) at the price of the tenderloin, but too embarrassed to give it back to the butcher who spent 10 minutes trimming it for me. However, it was worth it!! I finnagled as I always do, added a little more mustard, two chopped garlic cloves, and near the end, 3 Tbs of Sour Cream . I also refused to drop another $20 on cognac, and so used Marsala I had on hand. This dish is SUPERB!

This is *THE* recipe you're looking for. I've made this dish about 7 times now (upon request) with a few slight modifications to help make up for two qualities: as is, the sauce tends to be a bit thin in flavor and consistancy. Don't get me wrong, the flavor is fantastic...just a bit too subtle for my tastes. Try adding more cognac, mustard, garlic, and onions. Try thickening up the sauce with sour cream or, as a last ditch effort, a corn starch slurry. This dish is an absolute winner. Make this recipe!

Made this for my husband's birthday - he - and my teens and in-laws loved it! Used 14% sour cream instead of creme fraiche and extended the sauce with some extra broth (veal) and whipping cream, because of other reviewers' comments about lack of sauce. I also used cremini (brown) mushrooms. I prepared everything the day before, undercooking the meat, and leaving it separate from the sauce. Brought the meat to room temperature the next day, heated the sauce, and then heated both together to ensure meat would not be overdone. Added the dill at the last minute. Will make it again, some day, as it is incredibly fat-laden, but so delicious!

Regardless of the etymology of Stroganoff/ov, this was a tasty dish. I doubled it to serve 7 people, and used a good roast, cooked rare, to accomodate my budget. Everyone loved it.

I read the reviews before I made it and added more mustard and shallots to offset potential bland. Also used creme fraiche instead of sour cream. No problems with the sauce being thin, but it really DOES take about 14 minutes of simmering to get it to thicken. Not a huge fan of beef myself, but really enjoyed this dish and so have my fussiest guests.

The sauce was absolutely delicious but I'll add cornflour next time as it was a little thin. Only used 1 1/2 pounds of beef and it was more than enough for 4. Strongly recommend using fillet. I thought I'd skimp on costs and used popseye. Mistake! Just a bit too tough, but the delicious sauce saved the day. Served with roasted vegetables and plain risotto.

"Stroganoff," in whatever spelling, like "gulyash," has come to be a generic word describing almost any dish (or cafeteria slop) with beef and cream, and which, like this recipe, bears little resemblance to the original. A couple of corrections. The dish has not been around for "hundreds of years." It is a 19th cent. dish concoted by a French chef for one Pierre Stroganov. The earliest identifiable references to the dish contain either sour cream (Russian preference) or creme fraische (French twist). No mention of cognac, though it does add a touch as does the dill. PLEASE,PLEASE: Straw potatoes only, not "noodles," yuck!

Rating: 4
This was the best stroganoff I've made! I don't quite know how it could be considered bland. I did adjust a few things-I only used 1T butter, garlic clove, whole grain dijon style mustard,sour cream (though the creme fraiche would be great) and a little cornstarch to thicken it at the end. I think the quality of the meat and the cognac/mustard combination give this dish its punch. It's in my recipe box.

My husband loved this! I made the following modifications for 2 people. I used one pound of filet mignon, sliced; 1/2 cup extra-strength beef broth; 1/2 cup Cognac; 1/2 cup sour cream; grainy Dijon mustard. I used plenty of paprika on the mushrooms as they were sauteed. I then reduced the liquid before adding the meat to be heated through. Plenty of fresh dill added the final touch.

Rating: 4
I didn't expect the sauce to cover the pasta as if it was fettuccine alfredo or something, so we weren't disappointed by that. Everything else (flavor, tenderness of meat, that little hit of mustard) was beyond expectation, better than one we used to order at a favorite local restaurant.

Rating: 4
My butcher was concerned over my use of filet in a stroganoff, but this was FABULOUS and worth the expense. I agree, however, that there was not nearly enough sauce to cover my egg pappardelle. I will reduce the amount of meat next time. The cognac and dill are important to the final flavor and make this version "the one;" don't skip 'em. Sour cream is the way to go. I also snuck some portobello in with the buttons: Yum!

This is not a bad stroganoff recipe, however, it was VERY rich, and could've done with less meat. Had leftovers - unusual in our house - and, like another reviewer, I don't think they'll get eaten (the dog, however, is circling the refrigerator, so it won't go to waste!)

I have made this several times. My husband and everyone else who has had it loves it. I at least double the whipping cream and use 1/2 cup or more white wine instead of Cognac.

Use 2 cans if you have more people. I don't use the cream, but I do add in sour cream right before I am ready to serve it. Lots of pepper to season and you are ready to go!It is so good, and we eat every bit of it.

I have not made this recipe, yet. However reading the reviews I can not believe anyone would use yogurt instead of creme-fraiche. At least use sour cream. This is not the type of food to make if you are worried about fat. I also grew up using sour cream but try the creme-friache if you haven't already. It is easy to make and very tasty. Use extra mushrooms to make it go farther. Mushrooms and sour cream are what its all about, not yogurt.

This dish is always a family favourite, by far the best stroganoff recipe I've ever tried. The Cognac (brandy is okay, but Cognac is better) and dill make the dish. I use a mixture of mushrooms (white, crimini, etc.), and make my own egg noodles and beef broth. Reheats well for work lunches.

A very pleasing Sunday. For what it's worth: I think it's very important to use beef tenderloin, cut across the grain. A cheaper cut would not work as well. I used three large shallots and thought the recipe needed every bit of them. I used a whole can of beef broth and a whole cup of sour cream, then reduced about ten to fifteen minutes. That ended up with the right amount of sauce, but needed a teaspoon of corn starch in a teaspoon of water to thicken it up...with no negative consequences. Finally, I cooked my moodles in salted water and added a big handfull of fresh chopped parsley with the butter before serving. Served with a simple salad of bibb lettuce and sliced tomatoes with a light vinegrette on the side.

Loved this! After reading the reviews, I used a whole can of broth and used red wine instead of cognac. I will make this again, but will make more sauce. I used just over a pound of beef and it was enough for 2 with leftovers for the next day. Next time I may skip the mustard, or use very little, didn't like the way it tasted. The dill makes this dish! Also, I agree with the cook from Tahoe Pines, so I did add a little tabasco to the sauce before I put it over the noodles! YUM

I added some sour cream and a little milk and found there still wasnt enough, next time I will make more sauce and add the meat at the end so it doesnt overcook. IGNORE the cook from York, Pa :)

The past couple years my Beef Stroganoff recipe seemed to be lacking something...bland, so I tried this recipe. The dijon helped, but I ended up adding some cayenne pepper as well. I think the spicier we go, the more bland the old favorites begin to taste. We were recently wondering what happened to the 'hot' in hot Chinese mustard? We were also wondering what happened to the heat in jalepeno peppers? I don't think the 'hot' in the mustard or jalepeno peppers has decreased insomuch as our tolerance for heat has increased. I don't know if that makes any sense? If it makes sense to you then you will understand why the cayenne pepper helped the dish.

I have made many recipes from Bon Apetit and epicurious and this is definitely one of the best. I got a 2 lb filet mignon cut of meat from the butcher, and cut it thinly. Don't overcook the meat. The cook times in the recipe are all pretty much right on. This is truly a knock out.

Have now made this 3 times, even in summer. My husband loves it. I've made a slight variation to make the sauce thicker, but it's wonderful. The dill sets it apart from other recipes.

The dijon mustard and the dill was overpowering in taste. I'd suggest using less of both.

Glad I read the other user reviews before I started. 1-1/4 lbs of beef was more than enough and I will double the sauce measurements when I make it again. Everybody loved the flavor but I lost points with the family when I added sour cream to the sauce to increase the volume. Instead of waiting for the sauce to coat the mushrooms,which I found hard to visualize, next time I will stop the cooking process when the pan liquid reaches the consistency of glaze.

My husband and I loved this dish. I added a thinly sliced onion before adding the shallots. I followed others' advice and only used about 1 and 1/2 lbs. of meat. We have plenty of leftovers for tomorrow.

This recipe was pretty good. I thought the cognac and dijon mustard made all the difference - a good touch. I hadn't come across those ingredients in other stroganoff recipes. I added more sour cream, doubled the dijon and instead of putting the paprika (3 table spoons) on top, I stirred it into the mix to add colour and flavour.

The dijon mustard gave it a unique flaree....it was much more flavorful than the usual mushroom soup/sour cream base.

I modified this recipe with memories of my Mama's stroganoff (she was a first-generation Russian), so I used sherry instead of cognac and--very important!--did not add the sour cream into the mix: traditional stroganoff has the sour cream put on top by the individual, according to taste. Otherwise, a great recipe.

I have had this dish using top sirloin and filet mignon. The filet mignon makes a huge difference. The meat is much more tender and makes this dish more enjoyable. It is a great recipe, I highly recommend it.

Try using a variety of, and more, mushrooms. I used oyster, hedgehog, portobello and button, a little less meat, some cream for a minute or two after cooking down the broth, a little more sour cream. Nice and creamy. I think mixing mushrooms very much improved the basic recipe, which I tried as well, and the cream helped it coat the noodles.

Great recipe. However, I didn't take the advice of the other reviewers which I should have. Definately reduce the meat (I used 2 lbs) and increase the mushrooms. Also, I would make more sauce.

We thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. I did a little alteration in the recipe. I cut it in half for two people. In adjusting the ingredients, I used less butter for saute, lite sour cream and added a little worstershire sauce to color the dish. Instead of cognac, I used Marsala wine. I added a little wonder flour for thickening and chopped parsley for color when serving. I served the dish on brown long grain rice instead of noodles and it was fantastic. The mustard and dill add a special zip to an ordinary stroganoff.

This was a wonerful version for sroganoff, the dill added a great flavor. The recipe could definataly be cut down as far as the meat goes,it made enough for 8. I will make this one a keeper.

This is the ultimate if you are truly in the mood for stroganoff. Just like when you were a kid. Quick and easy to make. My young children went wild for it.

Absolutely delicious! I skipped the dill, cut the amount of butter in two, and used spinach linguine instead of egg-noodles, and it turned out fabulous!

When I make this recipe again, I'll reduce the amount of beef to 1-1/2 lbs., increase the amount of mushrooms, and add more beef broth and sour cream. I didn't have any problems with the sauce thickening. There just wasn't enough sauce for the amount of beef. The cognac, dijon mustard, and dill add wonderful flavor.

Making it again tonight! Lost the first recipe I printed out and searched again---found the same exact one again. As the dish was so good, I had to make it again quickly.

Best ever stroganoff--decadent repast from the 60's that our mothers could only have hoped to achieve.

Good recipe. I took the other reviewer's advice and substituted soy sauce for the cognac. My dill plant is no longer so I substituted dried dill. And the next time I make this recipe, I will use a lower fat sour cream instead of whipping cream.

2 1/2 lbs of meat for 4 people? Wow! I cut it back to 1 1/2 lbs of meat and increased the mushrooms (mixing button and wild) to 2 pounds, which seemed perfect to me. I took the suggestions to make a little more sauce - 1 can of broth and I used 1 cup of sour cream. I used the dill - which did make for a new stroganoff experience for me. It was a great dish, a hit at a birthday party.

This finished product was actually quite good. I did 1 1/2 times the ingredients for the sauce after reading the reviews. I found the cooking times indicated to be correct. For the beef, make sure to slice it as thinly as possible, then DO NOT salt it before cooking. It will draw the moisture out and make it tougher. Season afterwords while it's resting. Also start with a very hot pan so that the meat can sear, rather then saute. I didn't have creme fraiche handy so I did use sour cream with good results. If your sauce was runny, make sure to cook the mushrooms au sec, then REDUCE the stock and cognac by applying higher heat for the 14 mins. You shouldn't have to dredge the meat in order to thicken the sauce! The dill is essential for the recipe as well as chopped parsley.

I loved this recipe! It was very easy to make...I was looking for a beef recipe...bec my boyfriend loves meat dishes...and stroganoff came to mind. He doesn't like mushrooms, so I substituted red pepper, which made a beautiful and colorful combination! and...I didn't have Cognac, so i used a dash of soy sauce! Definitely use the dill at the very end as garnish...wonderful for lunch leftovers the next day! bravo!

I made this for my boyfriend and I and it turned out great!! I substituted the creme fraiche for half whipping cream and half light sour cream. I decreased the beef tenderloin to 3/4 lb. and it was still plenty enough for both of us. Great basic recipe.

Have made this dish many times - excellent! Note to readers - do not leave out dill!! It brightens the flavor and wakes up an old-school dish!!

I cut down on the butter for the egg noodles to keep the saturated fat down; also substituted light sour cream for the whipping cream/cream freche. Delicious

This was tasty but could be better with some adjustments. The sauce did need more creme fraiche and a bit of cornstarch at the end to set up correctly. I did dredge the meat first which helped and also left out the dill. It was a hit with my boyfriend!

Best stroganoff ever. 1-1 1/2 lbs of tenderloin enough for this amt of sauce. Added 1/2 c. finely chopped onions with the shallots. Used creme fraiche. The only stroganoff recipe I will use from now on.

Rating: 4
This was fantastic! Made a few adjustments, though. Left out the dill as suggested by another reader. I also dredged the meat with flour and then browned...this helped to thicken the sauce. I also used fat free evaporated milk to cut some calories. My wife thought more mushrooms were needed. Next time! The Bumpkin Gourmet

Meat too tough, prefer traditional stroganoff sauce...flavor good though. Probably would be better with longer cooking of meat and more cream.

Bon Appétit has much better recipes than this one. It took over 1/2 hr to cook down the sauce (not 14 min) and then I did add 1/2 TBLspoon of flour to thicken it. I don't mind preparing elavorate dishes; but this one took too long for what it was worth.

I'm in the camp that thought this recipe was okay. Surprisingly, the leftovers were better than the first night. Not really consistent with a traditional beef stroganoff.

Loved this recipe. I used very thinly cut strip loin and the meat was so tender it was fabulous. I didn't make any creme fraiche (which we love) but mixed sour cream and whipping cream and increased the amount to 1 1/2 cups. It was wonderful and the sauce on the noodles was excellent. Everyone raved. I have thrown out my other stroganoff recipe and will only make this one in the future. But, then again I have never made a recipe from Bon Appetit that wasn't excellent.

Great recipe. Flavor reminded me a of Steak Diane. To serve 2, I used just under a pound of meat, which was plenty. I substituted evaporated skim milk for the creme fraiche and it didn't seem to compromise the flavor. I would be interested in more information on the fromage fraiche that the Belgium reviewer noted. Does anyone know if it is available in the US?

Excellent concept but too much meat for us. When we make it again we will use 1 1/2 lbs of tenderloin, 2 lbs of mushrooms, 1 can (not cup) beef stock and one full cup of creme fraiche for a little more sauce.

This was a very good beef dish that everyone in my family loved. I substitued fromage fraiche, extra-maigre, which is practically fat-free for the creme fraiche, and it worked perfectly. The quality and taste of the beef is featured more than in other beef stroganoff recipes that I have tried, so it is important to buy a high quality piece of meat.

I definitely would prepare this again and again. It was an easy and delicious meal. I didn't think that one could replace the traditional sour cream with the creme fraiche. The creme fraiche gave the dish a delicate and slighty tangy flavor that we all enjoyed.

This is stroganoff with a kick! Definitely I will make it again, and for sure the addition of fresh chopped parsley made it even more delicious.
