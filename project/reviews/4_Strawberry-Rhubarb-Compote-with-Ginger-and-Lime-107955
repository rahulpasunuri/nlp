This is so simple and delicious. My only comment would be to throw it in a blender when you're finished cooking it to break up the ginger. Even minced, it can get a little chewy.

My husband loves strawberry and rhubarb. I wanted to make something for him with those ingredients for Father's Day, but I didn't want a gigantic vat of pie or crisp laying around since we are watching what we eat. Instead, I made this and served it over vanilla ice cream. Easy and delicious! I will definitely make it again.

Absolutely delicious! I just made it with lime juice and the fruit and sugar and it was incredible.

Sublime! I would give this recipe 5 stars if I could. This was my first time cooking rhubarb and it was fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly and it was heavenly. I have been eating it for breakfast over plain yogurt. Simply amazing!

I thought this was really great, especially with plain yogurt. It is also a beautiful color! I used lemon the first time with good results, but like the lime, too. I would decrease the ginger to 2 T and I only used 1/2 cup sugar. Very tasty!

Fabulous summer recipe. I don't like crystallized ginger so I substituted 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger. I cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup and it was sweet enough. Excellent over yogurt for breakfast or use for a strawberry rhubarb shortcake. My guests LOVED it.

Simple, fresh, delicious compote--added more lime as we like it more tart and the ginger is a nice touch.
