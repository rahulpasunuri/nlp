Good base on which to experiment with additional ingredients: the addition of cheese and mango were both excellent suggestions. These definitely do not travel or keep well, best served in close proximity to cooking time.

These were great! I add other ingredient like minced garlic, minced ginger, 1/2 tsp amchoor powder(dried mango powder), 1 tbsp indian chilli powder, pinch of sugar and more curry powder. They were a hit when I brought to a dinner party. A keeper.

This is such a tasty appetizer! I added shredded extra sharp cheddar to the beef mixture before placing in the pastry...definitely on my favorites list!

These were outstanding! I definitely agree with other reviewers: you must add additional ingredients to the mixture. I tripled the amount of curry powder, added sauteed garlic and spicy mango chutney. They were a huge hit!

These were good, but not fabulous. I added mango chutney to the meat mixture... which I think is a must. I then served with a mango chutney/yogurt dipping sauce. I received raved reviews, but I really thought they were a bit laborous for the end result.

agree with other reviewers to add a little to the meat mixture--chutney, currants, more curry. It took me a few tries to get the shape right but these were a big hit and did not take long to make. Good idea for a party and see no reason why you can't assemble an hour or so before putting in oven.

These were easy and very tasty. I added a half box of frozen peas to meat just before filling pastry. Also added about a 1/4 tsp of both cardamon and nutmet go meat. Served with ginger and mango chutney.

This dish tastes good, but it's more trouble than it's worth, at least for a weeknight. I'd make it again for a party, but I got frustrated at how long they took. I ended up scooping the filling into won ton wrappers and frying them in vegetable to speed up the process.

A great recipe. Used the pastry puffs, but also used wonton skins, canned bisuits rolled out and folded over, refrigerated pie crusts.

Delicious, I made them for a Christmas Cocktail Party and loved them. Be sure to drain the ground Beef well before filling the puff pastry.

Very good recipe. I am not into complex recipes and this one was very simple. The only time consuming part is assembling the puffs, which took me about 1.5 hours to make 36 puffs. Otherwise, it was a great hit at a potluck I brought it to.

Great taste and quick prep. I split the recipe (before wrapping)as follows: 1/2 was exactly as the recipe instructed...o.k. I did add a bit more curry, but otherwise exactly the same :) and 1/2 was spiced-up with Jalapeno Jelly. My husband liked the spicy version, however I preferred the original recipe. The soy, when added at the end somehow brings all the flavors together.

I added one egg to the meat and some parmesan cheese (1/4 cup) and red onion to be sweeter. I mixed the raw meat with 1/4 the onions by hand really well before cooking with the remaining sauteed onions. I think its hard to go wrong with this recipe! I didn't realize how the curry flavor mellows out with the puffs - lucky for me I had put in 3 tbsp!

This is a wonderful recipe as is but I did agree to double the curry powder. I also added garlic, a touch of cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg - very yummy! A little sweet to counterbalance the spice!

Rating: 2
I would have liked to rate this a 2.5. The filling recipe was a good base but needs a few tweaks. I did add minced garlic and 1T. of red currant jelly that added the right amount of sweetness to compliment the savoury. I believe that the type of curry powder make a big difference. I used Madras curry and 2T. was sufficient. Another change that I'd make for next time is to add a nice chutney to moisten the meat filling. It was too dry for my taste. I also used a empanada dough in place of the puff pastry. Try this recipe, but expand on it.

If you can get all the beef into the triangles, you are a stuffing master; I had SO much left over! Maybe I'll try thawing out the pastry sheets longer so they stretch a little more easily. Anyhow, these little delights are very tasty and puff beautifully, just don't forget that egg!

Rating: 3
I added a little garlic and considerably more curry powder (probably double the amount). Everyone, especially my teenage son, loved them. I took the advice of previous cooks, making sure to use plenty of filling in the puffs, and I was pleased with the results. I got exactly 18 puffs. Definitely a keeper!

This recipe is so easy to make. I had a Monday Night Football party last night, and while people were milling in and out of the kitchen area, I was assembling the puffs. the recipe was a big hit, and I did have a lot of beef left over. I may add a tablespoon of yogurt the next time to bind it up a bit better.

This is a great recipe for a large party since it is so tasty and easy. I did however think it needed a little sweetness to bring out the curry flavor so I added a tablespoon of red pepper jelly. I guess you could also do this with raisins, but some people are a little if-y with mixing savory and sweet. I see other reviewers had a lot of filling left over, but you can pack at least 1.5 to 2 Tbs into a square of puff pastry and stretch out the edges to cover. This dough is very pliable.

i found that 30 minutes was a little too long...mine came out almost burned. i also used much more curry powder than the recipe called for and wished i had used a little more. Once it was all in the pastry it was not as curry-y as i wanted.

Very good and easy hors'dorve. Added jarred minced ginger and garlic for an easy "kick". These look great too. Very impressive!

Delicious! I added currants to this recipe (golden raisins would probably be really good, too), which gave them a hint of sweetness that enhanced the spiciness and piquancy of the curry. Will definitely make again!

Really good! Does make enough for both sheets of puff pastry - and I did roll mine out with no ill effects. Will make these again.

Great and easy recipe! If you add ginger (either fresh chopped or ground) it will add more zest to the recipe. Adding frozen peas to the mix will give it an Indian (Samosa) flavour. For the lovers of spicy food: serve it with Chili Sauce you can buy at the Chinese specialty shops, it tastes great!

Tasted just like the curried beef puffs we get at dim sum or Chinese bakeries. Very authentic; even my parents were impressed (we're Chinese). Couldn't find Pepperidge Farms puff pastry, so I used Tenderflake instead, which I ended up having to roll out. I was worried that they wouldn't puff up nicely because of the rolling (as the recipe warns against), but they came out nicely.

I made these for a party, and they were a big hit. The recipe isn't clear about this, but this actually makes enough beef for 2 BOXES (not sheets) of puff pastry. Anyway, they were very tasty, and they're really pretty. (the egg gloss is great!) I added some diced red pepper to the beef mixture, which was a nice touch....

Easy & delicious! I must echo the advice about heaping the filling on because mine were rather thin inside. Try to add more than you possibly think will fit. Also, preparing the filling the night before worked well for me. Great!

I made these for Thanksgiving. I wanted to try them out on my family to see if I wanted to make them for a party. They are very tasty, however me and my family felt they were a bit large for an appetizer. And I should've stuffed them with more filling. The puff pastry to filling ratio wasn't right. I had used an extra box of pastry on others suggestions. Next time I'll just use the one box and try to get more filling in each one.

These were yummy, but I must admit to really elaborating on the filling. I added a small finely chopped raw potato to the onion and beef in the saute pan. After it was pretty much all cooked through, I drained the beef mixture, then I put it back in the pan and added a seeded chopped tomato, a 1/2 tsp. thyme, salt, and 2 1/2 TBSP. curry powder. I covered and cooked it for about 5 - 10 min. on a low simmer. It still needed something, so I added a couple of tablespoons of sweetened coconut, and it made it taste great! It reminded me of a samosa, and I think a little mango chutney on the side would be a nice dipping sauce for these. Everyone that tried them loved them. Frozen puff pastry rules!

This dish was fantastic and easy to make. I served it with other hor d'oeuvres at a small gathering -- Chicken Wings with Honey-Soy Glaze (Epicurious) and Turkey Croquette (Foodtv.com). Huge hit!!!

I made these for a cocktail party and they were a huge hit! I actually prepared the beef mixture the night before, then popped them in the pastry crust just before the party, served hot out of the oven they are as attractive as they are delicious!

These curry puffs are a hit every time I bring them to a party. I usually add some mashed potato flakes to the filling mixture to bind it together better. Also, I use Pillsbury pie crust and cut out circles to make the pastry part instead of using the puff pastry.

For some reason, this seemed as though it would be daunting. It wasn't! It was sinfully easy. I agree with most -- you have enough beef mixture for two boxes of puff pastry. And if you have a leftover pastry square or two, just fill it with a jam or apples, sugar and cinnamon and make yourself a couple turnovers. Much more fun than a container of mystery meat in your fridge. Definitely must be served immediately for ultimate taste -- which makes for difficult timing at a party with just one oven.

It was fun and very easy. I was surprised by how many people liked the curry taste. Thought it could use some sort of sauce to go with it, maybe next time I serve them I will put a little salsa on the side.

Very nice. But as the recipe says - better very fresh. I have also tried a variation using ground beef, barbeque sauce, garlic and pepper. I served it with canned gravy. A nice entree.

Way too much beef mixture for one package of puff pastry. I also found that dividing the dough into 9 parts was not enough. Since the dough is folded twice in the package, these score lines are a good place to cut. Then divide the rectangles into 4 smaller pieces. (Total of 12 per sheet.) This makes the puff easier to handle. I was alsoable to make these ahead of time, and rewarm them in the microwave oven.

These looked and tasted like I'd spent a lot of time on them. They were a huge hit and VERY quick and easy to make. NOTE: buy one more box than the recipe indicates. I had filling left over. Also, let the sheets thaw a bit before using them to avoid ripping them when folding.

If your family is as picky as mine, don't describe the dish--or even tell them what the name is. Just serve it and watch them gobble it up. The more you eat, the more you want.

These were easy and wonderful. I've also made (from this site) Deviled Cocktail Sausages with Chutney & Lime Sauce. I did not like the Sausages, but the sauce was good and goes very very well with this recipe. When making the sauce omit the lime peel and use one cup of mayo. The tastes go great together.

Very good, and relatively easy to make. I had leftover beef mixture and could have made more had I had more puff pastry.

This recipe is outstanding! I've made it for parties several times and it's always a huge hit. It's very easy, too.
