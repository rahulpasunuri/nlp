Made this for Christmas dinner. Husband said it was the best chocolate sauce he ever tasted. Made it early in the day and reheated it at serving time. Very easy to make. Sprinkled the peppermint on top after I put it on ice cream. Doubled the recipe. Used Ghiradelli chocolate and added a bit of vanilla. It had an intense chocolate flavor. Will definitely do again because it was so easy and husband thought it was so good.

This is my favorite hot fudge recipe although I've never used the peppermint. I was looking for a hot fudge recipe w/o corn syrup and fell in love with this one. It's not fancy but easy to make and tastes fabulous even with inexpensive bakers chocolate. It reminds me of the Ghiradelli sundaes I eat whenever I visit San Francisco.

Extremely quick and easy way to satisfy the craving for hot fudge that can strike at any time. I leave out the peppermint candies -- the result is a nice thick, not very sweet, chocolate sauce that is wonderful on vanilla ice cream. Not exactly "fudge" but very good and can be made in about 5 minutes.
