Wonderful. definitely one of my favorites. although it's not traditional in taste and color(it turned out green because of the olive oil), it is perfect if you enjoy different foods.

Wonderful. It's addicting, but it turned out green from the olive oil! Definitely one of my favorites.

Really a lot of effort and oil for a dull dressing.

Made it for a party this weekend as a side for some hot wings, and a veggies. Seemed a waste of good blue cheese. Taste was only so-so.

I added a minced shallot to the dressing and served it over a spinach/arugula salad with green grapes and pine nuts. Yummmm. (No need for more salt!)

Mmmmmmm. I was cooking last minute, so I had to use gorgonzola and red onion. I also never tasted a need for any salt. This turned out really well! I'm going to use the leftovers tomorrow on a turkey cobb. This will definitely go in my regular repertoire.

This is by no means a traditional bleu cheese dressing, but it is yummy as a dip or a spread ... just a hint--if you want to eliminate all of that oil, process one cup of cottage cheese (not low fat) in lieu of the olive oil and if you still want the olive oil flavor, drizzle some on top before serving.

excellent for chicken and can stand up to a steak salade as well. Good dip dressing for just about any veggie you can imagine. I omitted any additional salt and fired it up with a little more tabasco as we like it spicy!

The recipe is excellent. Doesn't need all of that salt though.

Absolutely delicious with a real Continental flavor. So superior to what passes for blue cheese dressing in bottles, at restaurants, etc. Thank you.

If you like mustard and mediterranean flavors, this would be fine. However, its not a traditional blue-cheese color or texture. Takes on the color of the vinegar. It is healthier with the olive oil than most blue cheese sauces. Maybe we'll try it again.
