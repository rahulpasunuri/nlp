I followed Satchi's review advice and I don't think I simmered it long enough in the end. It was good but would have been better had I cooked it longer at the end. Adding fresh grated ginger is a must. I halved the recipe but still added 2 tsp of fresh ginger. See Sachi's review 11/19/2012 for reference.

Based on reviews i made adjustments and was really happy with the results: 2 tsp turmeric, 2 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp coriander, 2 tsp fresh grated ginger, 2 pinches chili powder, 5 split cardamom pods. Added a bay leaf to the water/beans. I added the spices to the sauteed onions and cooked 1 minute more. I increased the simmer time at the end to 15 minutes. No need to puree. Didn't bother with the tomatoes or jalapeno.

Epicurious has so many great recipes. This is not among them. It's criminal for dal not to include turmeric, coriander and lots of fresh ginger. This Saveur recipe is much much better. http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Tadka-Dal-

This was good, but can be improved next time. I took the advice of others and added extra spices- I think that's excellent advice. I ended up adding some garam masala, too, which I would caution against. It's not the right spice mix for this. Still, I'm enjoying having a late lunch of it, with brown basmati rice and chopped tomatoes on top. Amp up the spices, but only those listed (well... a little cayenne is a fine addition) and you'll have something quite nice.

This recipe is good in terms of telling you what ingredients you're going to need, but not how much of them and not how to use them. I definitely agree with adding the spices to the garlic/onion saute. Also, I'm pretty sure that I used at least 10 times the amount of turmeric, cumin and ginger that was specified. In addition to that, it would be best to saute the lentils together with the garlic/onion/spice combination for at least 20 minutes more after boiling them, AND add more spices to that. (obviously you should keep tasting as you go along)...only THEN can this be rated "Delicious"

This wasn't the best dal we've made. It lacked punch and just wasn't all that flavorful. A much better recipe can be found here: http://www.theppk.com/recipes/dbrecipes/index.php?RecipeID=127

I am rating this recipe based on my modifications. First, I also used the traditional method of boiling the lentils on their own, although I did add a bay leaf. In a skillet, I then sauteed onions, garlic and fresh ginger and then added my dried spices. This time I decided to use garam masala, ground cardamom, turmeric, cayenne and mustard seed. I then stirred the onion, spice mixture into the cooked lentils. It was very tasty and flavorful! By the way it is totally unnecessary to puree the lentils. They pretty much cook down to a coarse puree on their own anyway.

Rating: 3
Excellent! Just what I was looking for. I followed the advice of others and sauteed the onions and garlic with the spices before adding in the lentils and water. Certainly helped to carry the flavor. Will certainly make this again!

Rating: 4
Oh, this dal is very nicely spiced. I used the traditional Indian method of adding the spices to the onions and garlic for the last 15 seconds of frying, or until the spices release a strong delicious aroma. This method activates the spices and creates a better flavor harmony. Try adding 2 cups chopped tomatoes to the dish, it is a nice addition.

The one fork is only there because epicurious made me rate this recipe with something. It is horrible! Doesn't even deserve the one fork. Why so bad? Because, as others have said, it tastes like nothing. I followed the recipe exactly and wound up with a yellow mush that had no flavor. I added salt and that didnt help. I would never try this recipe again.

I found this recipe incredibly bland. I know dal is not supposed to be totally exciting, but honestly, this tasted like nothing. i was desperately adding lemon juice, toasted mustard seeds, grated ginger, etc. to rescue it. maybe it would be better if you sauteed the onions w/the spices first, like most Indian recipes call for

I made this with brown lentils and served it with Chicken Tikka Masala and Curried Okra from this site. My husband, who objects to cumin and curry powder quite frequently, loved all three dishes. With little oil and salt, this Indian meal was not only delicious but good for us. I'm glad I found Indian cuisine recipes on this site that will become a part of my recipe repertoire.

Hi, I'm indian and have been cooking and eating dal all my life. It is not supposed to be particularly spiced...it is supposed to be somewhat mild compared to curry and stereotypical Indian food. It is meant to be mixed thoroughly into rice (not Basmati but regular thick sticky rice) and eaten as comfort food with a drizzling of butter. It is not meant to be elegant, flashy, or particularly "spicy." The most traditional way to eat dal is simply to steam the lentils with rice and salt and pepper. So that is probably why some people were disappointed in the simplicity of this recipe. If you're looking to be comforted, look no further, but if you're easily bored, make something else. This recipe is good, just be generous with the bay leaves (saute in hot oil with poppy seeds before adding garlic and onion).

I had never made dal before and I think this was a good one to start with. The spices were not overwhelming and contributed to a dish that would appeal to a wider range of people. I did not puree the lentils because they had pretty much turned to puree in the saucepan.

I just made this recipe, and wanted to weigh in with my thoughts. I went to India for the first time a couple of months ago. While that doesn't make me an authority on what tastes good, or on Indian food for that matter, I will say this: I had many different dals in India. Some don't have coconut; some do. Some have heavy cream. Some are spicy; some are not. Some are watery, and some are not. I would have to say that there is no single "right" way to make dal. This particular recipe is on the less-spicy, more-watery end of the spectrum. It is well within the bounds of what I experienced in India. Think of it as a side dish--something to make your rice more exciting. It would not be my ideal stand-alone dal, because of its austerity. But it would go nicely with a complex, spicy meat dish, for example. When I made it, I used clarified butter instead of vegetable oil. This is a good modification. I also recommend using white pepper instead of black pepper, for asthetic reasons.

A couple of the other dal recipes I have call for coconut milk..is this right or wrong to use? I am not an experienced enough Indian cook to know, but it does taste delicious..otherwise the recipes are all very similar.

I just wanted to post the recipe i use for dal my friend taught me. boil lentils in 1 teas salt and 1-2 t tumeric. cook until soft and tender in a pan, heat a few T of oil with mustard seeds and whole dried chilis. wait until seeds have popped (cover the pan by the way). add some chopped onion, garlic and ginger. as onions become cooked, add 1-2 teaspoons of garam masala, curry powder and 1/2-1 t of crushed dried chili. heat until aromatic. add to cooked lentils and heat for 2-5 minutes. can add tomatoes, a teaspoon of butter to finish, a touch of cream. it is a very flexible recipe.

Rating: 1
Rated this one fork because it needs serious modification before it tastes good. I diced the tomatoes and cooked them with the lentils, didn't puree, added some of the chili and some cayenne pepper, cardamom, and a liberal amount of Patak's curry paste. Then it finally had the depth that it needed - was quite flat and bland before.

The well educated reviewer who wrote about the key to the dish being luxuriating in the caramelized onions & not smothering the dish in spices was on the money. I tasted it as i went along & as soon as the sauteed onions were added the dish comes alive. therefore I council patience & subtlety when spicing! curry powder would be the death kiss. The garnishes are essential too. A very simple but pleasing dish, but if you're expecting 'fireworks' as some readers seem to be, you need only to look at the ingredients list to know that this not the recipe for you.

To the "Cook from Rio del Mar", I know for sure that you used the wrong dal. Lentils are a Dark Brown colored variety. In the supermarkets you will find them in the International Section with the Goya products. And they basically take a half hour to cook really well. Try it again, you will like it.

Rating: 3
Reading the other reviews i took some suggestions. I used chicken broth instead of water (only 2C) and just added as much spice as i wanted. Really just used this recipe as a guideline. I ended up using a whole can of lentils (not dried) and purreed about 75% of the mixture. It was delicious, i almost couldn't stop "tasting" it out of the pot. Also, i let it simmer for almost an hour to let the flavours really blend together. Try it, it's really nice, and don't be afraid to change things up a bit.

Something went very wrong for me with this recipe. Didn't think that it was fair to post a rating because the overall flavor was great. My problem was with the dal itself. I purchased a package of yellow dhana dal from an Indian market and proceeded to prepare this recipe. I followed the directions to simmer for 15 minutes or until it reached the correct consistency. After simmering for an additional 45 minutes the dal was still hard and crunchy. I didn't give up at that time but simmered for an hour the following day to no avail. Does anyone know what went wrong? I suspect that it was the type of dal I used. The product didn't resemble the lentils that I've used in making a barley and lentil soup. Besides from the yellow color they were smallish and flat, similiar to seeds. Suggestions? Might it have helped if I pre-soaked the dal?

I agree with the reviewer from Florida. I go to culinary school and I just actually took my international class. We studied Indian food very closely. Curry is basically a dish with sauce in India. They don't really have a curry powder. As the reviewer said, they add different spice mixes to different dishes. For the people that think Indian food all tastes the same, then you haven't had real Indian food. Ignore the curry!

Rating: 0
This dish is actually what is know in the Indo-Pak subconinent as a Tarka dal. The frying of the browned onions and garlic should be done after the lentils are made and immediatediately pour on top of lentils hot when done frying and mix. The lentils are definitely not pureed. As a purist, curry powder is not something that one just dumps in everything, when you see "indian" in the title of the recipe. "Curry" is overused and misunderstood, and you are leaving all your food to have that same "curry" flavor. Subcontinent cooking is a subtle blend of different spices for different dishes, and about enjoying that difference. Everything indian does not have 5 million spices in it. This dish is more about enjoying the taste of the carmelized onions and garlic, and it often tastes better the next day.

Excellent ! I was a bit apprehensive, as I was making it for the first time with two friends over, and am not a huge curry fan myself. I used the suggested recipe modifications - veg broth instead of water, 2 or 3 tbsp of curry instead of dried spices, 5 cloves garlic, a large chunk of fresh ginger, and a can of tomatoes in the dahl. I served it with basmati rice, fresh chopped tomatoes with fresh chopped thai basil, and sour cream. I'll definitely be keeping this one on regular rotation.

I made this last night and it was not only delicious, but simple. Didn't have some of the ground spices so I used Garam Masala - I think this is a good substitute if you have it. Served the Dal over basmati rice, a good combo. Overall, a very tasty dish and easy to do, so I highly recommend it.

Delish. I followed everyone's advice on the fresh ginger (I used a full T), chili pepper + tomato added during cooking, extra spices, broth, etc. I also made this in one pan. Why bother keeping half the onions and garlic separate? For something that only cooks for 15 minutes, the 2-step, 2-pan process was overkill. I just sauteed everything in one pan, then added the lentils and broth, and presto, you're done.

This was the only available dal recipe at the time, I have rated this dish on the basis that it needs adjustment according to your individual taste, I added a stock cube to the water, increased the garlic and spices. I cooked chopped tomatoes with the onion mixture and added a few more spices and a teaspoon of sugar just to take the edge of the tomatoes and then combibed the two, I still found this recipe bland so had to adjust with salt,pepper and I added 1 fresh red chilli for colour and spice. The finished dish turned out amazing.I also squeezed the juice of 1 lemon over the basmati rice just before it was finished steaming to enhance the aroma and flavour.mmmmmmm

After seeing "100% would make it again," I was really surprised at how bland this dish was. Then I came back and read all the reviews which said "Use chicken broth instead of water" and "Add a ton more spices." IMO, there's a subtle but important difference between "This is a great dish" and "this is an OK dish that can be used as a starting point for something better." Anyway, as written this was blah and NEEDED the condiments and then some.

One of my favorite recipes on this site. Have made it several times now for friends and family.

Try sauted red onions and tomatoes in the dal while cooking it. Also add ginger along with the garlic during cooking and let it simmer until the lentil gets tender and sort of melts inside.After it is done top it with hot oil(remove from heat) seasoned with whole cumin seeds, red chilly powder and dried fenugreek powder. Serve with rice.

I made this in Italy for my fiance's family (party of 6) as a side dish with Chicken Curry w/ Green Apple and Coconut Chutney, Basmati Rice, and Samosas for an appetizer. Dal is supposed to be fairly plain, so i liked it. But the suggestions below about skipping the blender are right on. Not necessary. Also, there is no cilantro in Italy, so i skipped it and it was fine. P.S. For first-timers, the red lentils turn green in the pot. Don't be alarmed.

This was another one of those recipes that you have to alter significantly to actually taste like anything. It was a great basic recipe to work from, however. I added 1 T fresh minced ginger, 1 t ground superhot cayenne, Tabasco sauce, salt, pepper, and chicken broth (instead of water).

This is great and very easy basic recipe. Like many other reviewers have stated, it needs a little extra kick - certainly salt to taste, but also whatever else strikes your fancy - garlic, hot pepper, spices, etc. I continued adding a dash of this and that and got it a very flavorful combination.

well, to be perfectly honest, I've never made this specific recipe. but having found my favorite-ever comfort food at epicurious, i can't help but comment. serve this with basmati rice and sauteed, lightly spiced potatoes -- mmmmm!!!!! it's my favorite meal ever, one my mom makes for my last meal whenever i'm back home. my mom's is different in a few ways. she uses fresh ginger, added directly to the lentils. and a more traditional way of doing the spices is to fry them separately. my mom uses whole cumin, turmeric, garlic (no onion, black mustard seed, dried red chiles. fry these until the cumin seeds start turning pink, and the mustard seeds start popping. add that lentils as they're boiling (no need to wait till the end). i would also bump up the spice amounts. and a squeeze of lemon or lime juice at the end also adds a delicious dimension of flavor. finally, it's totally unnecessary to use the blender. all that gives you is more cleaning up to do. just cook it a little longer for a mushier texture.

I amended this recipe a bit: wanted to use what I had in the cabinets. Substituted regular lentils for red, added squash to the onion saute because I have so many (it's summer!), and used curry powder instead of the spice mix (easier). Topped with plain yogurt and tomatoes. Wonderful, easy, economical--will definitely make again! (Oh, I pureed half the cooked lentil mixture as suggested. Next time, I will not--I will simply squish (!) half the mixture with the back of a spoon--the puree didn't really add much to the body of the dish but did add extra prep and cleaning time/steps.)
