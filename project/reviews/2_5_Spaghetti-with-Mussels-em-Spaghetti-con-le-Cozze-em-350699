Bland. 1/2 olive oil? Hmmm. I also think you should be starting your pasta water well in advance of putting your mussels in. Not a very good recipe at all.

Good, simple, strong flavors. Don't mess with the recipe except to increase some of the ingredients -- I used 2/1/2 lbs mussels, doubled the garlic and parsley but otherwise followed the recipe mostly as directed ("1/2 extra virgin olive oil" = 1/2 cup, btw). I shelled all but 12 of the mussels when they were cooked (threw out those that didn't open) and returned them to the pan, making it easier to coat the pasta. I added the red pepper flakes to the mussels and broth before I added the pasta. Don't be shy with salt and pepper

An average. 4 forks if you know what you're doing. 0 if you're just starting to cook. Please explain what 1/2 extra virgin olive oil is. An ingredient? A quantity? If so how much? Great recipe. horrible ingredient list directive. Learn to edit please

I make this often...but what is missing is Salt...a bit of ground pepper, and use butter...so much richer with the butter.

I added aioli and ground fennel seed to the steaming mussels, which had to help, but something is still missing.....
