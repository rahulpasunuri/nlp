Very good, tasty. Made it for a potluck, and it was consumed quickly!

This guacamole recipe was excellent! I made guacamole for the first time ever with this recipe and everyone who ate it raved about it! People even asked me for the recipe and to take some home with them since I made so much... now that's a compliment when people are asking for more!!

This one is OK, but the "CHARRED TOMATILLO GUACAMOLE" also on this site is better.

i found that this was a good recipe for guacamole. the tomatillos added a little bit of extra flavour that was very different and good.

This is a really good basic guacamole recipe, but being from the southwest I found it a bit "Gringo". I kicked it up by adding 1 hot dry roasted chili pepper (seeds removed, a teaspoon of salt and and 1-2 cloves of minced garlic.

Loved it, but would recommend removing the tough stem ends and core from the tomatillos once they are roasted.

Don't waste good avacados on this. Guacamole should be left as is with the avacado's rich flavor standing alone. Tomatillos are great in their own right, but cover the true guacamole flavor.

I was broiling tomatillos for salsa and making guacamole too so I mixed up a mini amount of this to sample. Not sure why you would mask the rich mellow flavor of Haas avocados with tart tomatillos? And a dozen of them to three avocados? I use tomatillos regularly and they will overpower many ingredients. Avocado is certainly one of those.

YUM! Even better when left to chill, and great with pico de gallo.
