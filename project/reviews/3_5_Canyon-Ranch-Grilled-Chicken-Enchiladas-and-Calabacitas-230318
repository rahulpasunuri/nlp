a little tedious BUT worth while....I added a little sour cream to the sauce...and the calabaitas were the perfect side...

Be advised, this dish requires a baking pan, baking sheet, blender, food processor, saute pan, and patience. You'll be switching the oven from 400 degrees (sauce) to 350 (enchiladas) to 425 (calabacitas). That's a lot for a small kitchen in a 1br apartment! This was my first attempt at enchiladas -- it's a lot of effort (prep, grill, bake, saute) vs going out for dinner (which I do quite often when I think the work supersedes the ease of a $15 night out on a weekday night). For a dinner for 2, these ingredients are actually more than enough for 4! Tastes great, but it was more prep, coordination, baking/saute, washing dishes than the 2 of us anticipated for a Tuesday night! Maybe that's why people would rather get this dish at Canyon Ranch. :)

This was excellent. I made a few changes: added 2 chipotle peppers and 2 tbl of the adobo sauce. I really liked the smoky, hot addition. Also used a little more cheese and fresh Anaheim chili that I sautéed in the pan after the chicken was done. The Calabacitas were a delicious side. I will be making this again!

Really wish I'd read the other reviews before I embarked upon this voyage, especially the Cook from Houston, whose suggestion to layer and use more cheese is spot on (although probably defeats the whole "Canyon Ranch" ethos of low fat, low cal). I did use corn tortillas rather than the flour ones called for (because the idea of enchiladas with flour tortillas made this California native balk). Four chicken breasts was WAAAAY more than four enchiladas worth! I grilled the chicken over smoke, which made for nice flavor, and then set up the assembly line of tortillas, chicken, cheese, and a small mountain of chopped fresh jalapenos, and started rolling and tucking into a Pyrex baking dish. When I ran out of one of the ingredients (the chilis gave out first), I was finished. I use the old trick of heating the tortillas on a griddle before rolling them (otherwise, the lame East Coast tortillas we get here would simply break in half). Veggies had enough liquid to puree them satisfactorily, although I had to do it in two batches), and I did use it all, even though it looked like an awful lot of sauce (it wasn't). My complaint is just that this was all just a bit too bland (even with my liberal use of chilis) to justify the amount of labor that went into it (although the males in the family each had two BIG helpings). I've got a small stack of broken tortillas; think I'll just make a tortilla pie with them, which is what I should have done in the first place with this recipe!

I have made my version of this dish twice now and it is absolutely delicious. I roasted the tomatoes and onions longer than called for... 20 -25 minutes and added smoked jalepenos (found them at Whole Foods)--used an immersion blender so the sauce was still a bit chunky. Added a little vegetable broth to sauce to improve consistency. Instead of rolling up in indiv tortillas, I just layered like a casserole, and used more cheese than called for (1 1/2 cups) and corn tortillas that had been toasted in the oven for a few minutes. The combination of flavors was divine!

Using the adobo sauce and maybe must be crucial to the enchilada sauce because I couldn't get the jar open and there for didn't use it and the sauce was good but not great. Did everything else the way the recipe said, probably used more garlic. Besides that, what a healthy and enticing smell! Still working on getting that jar open.

We enjoyed this dish, but like the previous reviewer my sauce came out a little thick. Next time I would add some type of liquid (water, chicken broth?) to thin it out a little. I added a teaspoon of adobo sauce for some heat. Very healthy and tasty enough!

I have never made anything like this before. I am so proud of myself for giving it a try. The sauce is SO, SO easy. I did make the sauce the night before and I think I left the veggies in the oven a bit too long because the sauce was very thick. So the next day I bought some more tomatoes and cooked them while the veggies for the calabacitas were cooking. I blended and added to the already finished sauce form the night before. I had grilled the chicken a bit early and placed them in a dish to rest while I got everything else together. About a cook of juice accumulated in the dish so I decided to also add that to the sauces. WOW it was so amazingly good. Everyone loved it and said it tasted better than any restaurant food. I was so happy. I can't wait to make it again.

Great, easy dinner. I only made the enchiladas, but they were very good. I added extra spices to the sauce, plus a bit of good quality unsweetened cocoa and some adobo sauce to add a bit more depth. I used about 10 tomatoes, as 16 seemed like a lot, and i still had sauce left over. Good lowfat weeknight recipe.

This recipe is great, it is my boyfriend's new favorite! I would definitely NOT substitute canned enchilada sauce, as the sauce is the best part and it is not hard if you have a food processor or blender. I agree with a previous reviewer about roasting the veggies all in once step to save time.

the calabacitas were awesome! a new, healthy side dish! i used dried oregano, which worked very well. approximately a cup of fresh white corn added a bit of sweetness to it - fantastic. the roasting took a bit longer than described in the recipe, but it was well worth it. we are in the midst of a low sugar/carb diet, so i removed the tortillas and cheese from the enchilada recipe. for the enchilada sauce, i doubled the spices and added more roasted onions and garlic. perhaps the romas we buy in southern california are larger than normal - i found that i was left with four extra roasted tomatoes after i seasoned my sauce to taste (never mind the fact they would not fit in the blender). will definitely make again.

This was a great, tasty yet healthy dinner! Everyone liked it! I substituted two cans of enchilada sauce for the sauce recipe. I found that I had to use eight of the tortillas - not four. They fit perfectly in the 9x13 pan to bake. I topped it with lowfat sour cream.

I only made the enchiladas, and they were delicious! I couldn't believe how wonderful this dish turned out. The sauce was divine, full of flavor. My husband just loved it! I also used fat free cheddar, to decrease the calories a little. I am sometimes hesitant to use fat free ingredients, but in this case you couldn't tell the difference. I highly recommend this dish!

This was extremely flavorful. My husband ate leftovers for breakfast. Next time I would roast the zucchini & summer squash with the onions etc in the first step. Definitely will make again.
