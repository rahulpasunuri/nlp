This fish was delicious and extremely moist. Like other reviewers, my zucchini didn't wrap the whole way around the fillets but it worked anyway. Love this recipe.

This is a very simple, but elegant way to prepare salmon. It has become a regular in this household.

Wonderful, especially given the shear simplicity of the ingredients! I used cod and it was fine and added a little lemon zest to the roll-up. Fish was moist, perfectly cooked and flavorful! Can't wait to make it again for company.

This is fast, easy and healthy. It tastes good, but it doesn't pack a punch. A weekday meal that I would make again but not something I would serve to company. For a quick and easy salmon recipe, I prefer the Rosemary Roasted Salmon, also on this site.

I made this dish last night and it was really delicious, interesting combination of flavors, esp. the basil with the zucchini. A couple of things that will make your life easier: a. make sure you buy a long and firm zucchini. I bought two and one of them was too soft inside and had too many seeds and the slices were not good enough to wrap the fish in. b. it is better to use a cheese slicer than a peeler. Maybe my peeler is too efficient cause it was literally peeling the zucchini and not coming out with .25 inch slices.

This was so good for a dinner party for 6 people. I also made the Skillet potatoes with Olives and Lemon and people were not talking because they were stuffing the food in their mouths. I followed the recipe exactly - very easy - very tasty. Cut the salmon or halibut down to size to fit the zucchini - it's just not that hard!

This was excellent and to the cook from MD, what could be easier? Naturally, get long zucchinies or narrow the sliced fish. I jazzed it up by making a compund butter from 2 sticks of butter, 3 shallots minced, 1 tube of Anchovy paste and 1 bunch of basil, chopped. Spread 1 tsp. of it on each fish and then proceeded as directed. Will make it again when I want something effortless. Michael Weber

I thought this was a pian to make. I purchased the longet zucchini I could find and it still didn't wrap around the fish. I ended up securing the top with toothpicks, thus cooking the fish seam side up. And if you are even thinking about cutting back on the salt, forget it. I thought I added too much and it still wasn't enough. I would only make this again as an appetizer or perhpas as part of a surf and turf. It was light, yes, but overall, not as easy to make as they bill it to be.

This was great. A coworker was eating leftovers at lunch and I was intrigued by what she described. I was going to attempt to recreate it but then I ran across this recipe. She used pesto instead of just basil which was great. The fish cooked quickly and preparation was fast. I think the entire meal was made in under20 minutes. We served with some peso pasta on the side. Definately a winner. Our almost 2 yo could not get ENOUGH of this fish.

MMMM!!! One of the most moist salmon dishes I've ever had! Due to time constraints i didn't even bother making the lemon sauce. Instead I quartered the lemon and let my diners squeeze it over their salmon. That way they got to choose how much they wanted. Next time i make it i'll try the sauce.

Made this for the first time last night, using wild Alaskan Salmon. My wife and I loved it. Be sure to get long-ish zucchini , because wrapping the slices around the salmon can be tricky, otherwise.

I loved this recipe. The slight change I made was to pan sear fish on both sides then finish in the oven. This gave the zucchini a crispy crust. The lemon sauce at the end really boosts the flavor of the whole dish.

A delicious recipe ,easy to prepare and beautiful to look at.An additional plus is that is very light and healthful. I made it the day after my August issue of Bon Appetit came and it was a hit.

I loved this dish as it was beautiful, flavorful and moist. I cut the oil by 1/2 and sauteed some fresh garlic in the oil before placing fish in pan. Can't wait to eat it again.

really moist and delicious. not terribly flavorful but could easily be with a nice sauce, possibly a horseradish creamy sauce on the side. very easy to make and cannot emphasize enough how moist my salmon was.
