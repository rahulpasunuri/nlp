I made ths recipe many years ago and lost track of it until today. I found it to be one of the best chicken recipes I'd ever tasted II am surprised by seeing the polar opposite remarks on here but it just goes to show how different our tastes all are). I love the marinade because the buttermilk breaks down the texture into a silky product. I love the cornmeal crust idea and the moistness of the chicken was delicious. I am making this again tonight!

A friend of mine told me this was a favorite recipe of hers from long ago. I recently made it for my family and it was outstanding. The layers of flavor and texture couldn't be better. It didn't get soggy on the bottom, crispy all the way around. It was a little time consuming, but could be prepared ahead. My husband and "picky" teenage children loved it. I can't wait to make it again. Well worth the effort!

This has been a staple in my house for years. I think the important flavorings are the cayenne, the lemon zest and the shallots in the marinade. I never have buttermilk, so I use milk soured with vinegar. This is very good as a hot dish, but doesn't travel well to a picnic in my opinion.

Don't waste your time--followed the recipe with the exception of using panko (japanese bread crumbs) versus traditional breadcrumbs--and I can't remember a recipe that I like less.

At the advice of previous reviewers I jazzed this up alot. Added garlic & salt to the buttermilk & let it marinate for 2 hours. Also added extra spices to the crust. It still was pretty boring. Not bad, just ho-hum. Plenty of better low fat ways to prepare chicken. Oh-the lemon zest was nice.

I have made this many times--it's a great alternative to fried chicken and the cornmeal adds a nice crunch. Leftovers are very portable.

I have made this recipe several times and always received rave reviews. I love the texture and flavor of the crust; if you don't like cornmeal, you won't like this recipe.

Overall, it got good reviews from the family and tasted pretty good, but seemed like a lot of work. I might leave off the marinade altogether next time, as it didn't seem to add much.

This recipe was excellent with a small variation. I used 3 pounds of boneless, skinless chicken breasts and cut them into thirds. I also marinated the chicken overnight. I found it extremely flavorful and tender, and the coating was thick, crisp and delicious. This was the second time I made it; I was also impressed the first time, however when eaten cold later the skin was rubbery and unappealing, which was why I decided to try it skinless. I definitely recommend this. It would be a wonderful picnic dish.

With all the preparation and spices, I would have expected this to be much more flavorful. I am not a fried chicken fan anyway, so perhaps I'm prejudiced. There are better chicken dishes in these pages, that's for sure.
