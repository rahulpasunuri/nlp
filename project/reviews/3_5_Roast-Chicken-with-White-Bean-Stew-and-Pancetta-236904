I'm so bugged right now I could spit. I should have known better -- I've cooked with dried beans before, so it's not my first trip to the rodeo. 45 minutes of cooking time?? As if. I soaked the beans for almost 24 hours before cooking and then they were in the oven for 90 minutes, on the stove for another 30. Still not done. My husband right now is salvaging dinner by making some sort of chicken tacos with refried beans whilst I continue to cook down the beans and retry dinner tomorrow night. Grrrrrr....

I made the recipe exactly as written and found it excellent. I finished it in the oven and the chicken fell off the bones - wonderful. On second serving, I added kale that I had and that gave it a different look and taste. Very nice. It also froze very well.

I cook a simpler version of this recipe that I developed myself, but tried this one recently. I was guided by some of the comments in the reviews. I used Goya canned white beans because I couldn't get Progresso, which I feel are better--two large cans. I used more chicken. I cooked it on top of the stove. I dropped lemon peel, garlic, parsley and rosemary into a running food processor to make the gremolata, and I served it over pearlized Israeli couscous that I prepared with chicken stock. It was really great!

Update to my prior review....Add more chicken (I used breasts) and realize a pound of beans is a ton. We had bean 'soup' leftover for days....after we'd eaten our fill and the chicken was gone....This makes way more servings than the recipe indicates. But still a fantastic recipe! Will definitely make again with different proportions!

Thanks to the other reviewers, I refrained from adding the acidic tomato paste and my beans cooked nicely in 1 hour.... I had intended to add tomatoes at the end (instead) and forgot... The parsley / lemon at the end was good. Also used boneless, skinless chicken which worked as well. As I didn't have a fresh sprig of rosemary I put about 1.5 tbl crushed rosemary into the pot when I put it into the oven. I liked this a lot, but DH said too much rosemary - so be cautious.

Made this with canned white beans, chicken breasts, turkey bacon instead of pancetta, and no fennel (extra carrots and celery instead). It's perfect for the kid who doesn't like tomatoes, which seem to be in every other chicken/bean recipe. A repeat recipe for sure.

Also forgot to add that the garnish of lemon, rosemary and parsley is a must! It makes the whole dish!!

I loved this recipe! I used skinless chicken thighs and skinless drumsticks, and used canned beans based on the recommendations. I used one can of northern and one can chick peas. I liked that combination because the chick peas stay firmer when cooking in the broth. Definitely a keeper. Might use more carrots the next time because my kids are carrot eaters.

This was a great dish for a weekend supper. It was very savory. Both kids and both adults enjoyed it, including the extremely picky 3-year old. My daughter even called dibs on the leftovers for her lunch. Prep was easy; most of the time was the oven roasting. We did cut out the oil, used chicken breast instead of leg meat, and reduced the pancetta to just 1.5 oz. Even this much leaner version was still very flavorful. This will be a regular weekend supper at our house.

I, too, used canned cannellini beans and bacon instead of pancetta with good results. Browned the chicken it a bit of added bacon grease. I thought it was yummy and my kids ate it which is always a plus. Very similar to Chicken Stew with Tomatoes and White Beans, a winter staple at our house.

This turned out really well, with some adjustments. I substituted Great Northern beans and bacon, and used leftover roast chicken (and the broth I made from the carcass), which I added in the final 30 minutes of braising. The cooking time was indeed longer--about 2 1/2 hours in the oven. I turned the oven down to 325 for the last hour. The results were perfect, thick and creamy, with a great complex flavor from the fennel and rosemary.

Love this recipe,because you can make it ahead of time and enjoy your company while NOT in the kitchen. Reduced the liquid by 2 cups, used dry beans instead of canned. Always better the 2nd day. Always gets rave reviews.

Very similar to a chicken-version of cassoulet that I've tried. Since this is a slow food style of recipe, the dish is very flavourful -- if you don't take short cuts with the browning of chicken and sauteing of veggies. Some changes I made: I substituted canned navy beans for the dried beans and used 3-1/2 cups of stock instead of 6 (way too much). I placed covered casserole in oven for 1/2-hour, and uncovered it for 1 hour thereafter. It turned out perfect.

This is one of our fall and winter staples now! I make this dish with 4 chicken legs, not 6, as they don't all fit in the pot, and I use 2-3 cans of beans instead of dry. Don't skip the step of browning the chicken- it changes the flavors and renders some chicken fat- you can drain a lot of that off if you like, and sometimes I then remove the skin before continuing to remove more fat. I usually use regular bacon instead of pancetta to save cash. Don't skip on the other ingredients- they are all important! Adding the lemon peel, rosemary, and parsley at the end TOTALLY brightens up this dish- without it it tastes much more bland. Be careful with the salt if you are using canned beans and canned chicken broth- you can always add more at the end. We usually have this meal with crusty bread and brussels sprouts- their nutty flavor goes great with this dish.

I thought this was a very good recipe, I added the fresh rosemary, chopped, into the stew. The problem with the hard beans is the tomato paste. The acid will stop the cooking process, I would either use canned beans or boil the soaked beans just until tender.

Rating: 2
As per the other reviews the beans took much longer than an hour in the oven. More like 3 hours and it remained soupy. I love one pot oven cooked meals and am always on the look out for recipes that fit the bill - this one didn't. Try something else.

I thought that this recipe was mediocre. I was a bit dissapointed.

This dish was ok with potential; next time I'll adjust 3 things: I made 1-1/2 times the recipe for a dinner party last night & found that browning the chicken in 3 batches took 45 min--too long with everything else going on. So next time I'll follow Bon Appetit's Moroccan Chicken (Feb 04) & add the raw chicken after the broth goes in. Per the same recipe, I'll use skinless thighs & drumsticks, because the stew left a greasy feel in my mouth (although the lemon peel added to the bowls helped), and I didn't like having chicken skin in my stew bowl. Also, per same recipe, I might add some lemon juice at the end, as the lemon did add a nice balance. I found dried cannellini beans at an Italian deli & didn't have any trouble with them being hard after braising for 1 hr. Contrary to the cook who used bacon & thought it overpowered the stew, I didn't taste the pancetta at all, which surprised me because it's in the recipe title so I expected to be able to taste it.

I too used a quick soak method for dried beans and they were hard despite a longer cooking time than recommended. I believe it is due to the tomato paste. I have experienced this same probem in other recipes when there are tomato products added before the dried beans are cooked and tender. I will make this again tonight with canned beans, but I suspect that adding the tomato paste after the beans are cooked rather than before would solve the problem. Don't leave out the gremolata.

This was AMAZINGLY flavorful and rich, definitely a keeper and repeater. I used canned Cannellini beans as I never have any luck with the dried varieties ... and it was just fabulous. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly as described. My guests were mostly speechless throughout dinner, with a lot of "yumm, this is really good!" comments. Served with crusty french bread and a salad, finished with chocolate bread pudding from this site that was also to die for delicious.

This recipe left a lot to be desired - I was thinking it would be homey and comforting, but all we got were semi-crunchy beans and a rather bland taste - oh and gas, lots of painful gas. Maybe using canned beans would make it better, but there needs to be something else to up the ante of the flavor. Needs richness of somesort.

I've made this twice and as many have I used canned beans to cut down on prep time. The first time I made it used chicken with skin on and I found the whole stew too fatty and rich (given the pancetta as well). I also found for all the work involved not as flavorful as I would have liked. The second time I marinated skinless chicken theighs in rosemary, garlic and olive oil prior to browning. I used less pancetta and cooked it longer before adding the vegs and garlic. I also added cooked cous-cous at the end, which thickened it and added an interesting texture. My guests absolutely loved it. It smelled wonderful.

We loved this recipe, but like everyone else had to cook the beans much longer than the recipe stated. Next time we might precook the beans. If you like slowcooked braised dishes in winter, this is great.

I wish I'd used canned beans. Like an earlier reviewer, soaked the beans per recipe and then some, and they're still not soft enough. I think they need to be boiled before use but really, canned beans would save a lot of headache. The flavors are nice, the gremolata does what a gremolata should do, but disappointing given the lovely ingredients and time involved.

Despite laziness and forgetfulness, my stew turned out very well. I didn't feel like waiting for beans to soak, so I used canned beans. And I thought I had chicken thighs but I didn't, so I substituted chicken breast and shredded the chicken before serving. The flavor was intense and delicious. This recipe was great excuse to use my Le Creuset French Oven.

This sucked! I followed the directions completely, except I had to use Great Northern Beans, which I soaked over 24 hours. I thought that the recipe called for alot of liquid and after 1 hour in the oven and 2 hours on the stovetop without a cover, it finally became stew-like and the beans soft enough to eat. Luckily I read the previous review and started early. But for all the time and prep I would expect a more complex flavor. Maybe with alot more rosemary or perhaps some sage it would have more flavor, but as written it's not worth the time or effort. Try something else!

This dish was awful. There was way too much stock, the wine didn't add any flavour and it tastes awful. I had to take the chicken out and make another sauce for it. Then I turned what was left over into a vegetable and bean "soup" with some herbs to taste. I would never make this dish again.

This recipe was o.k., I don't plan on making this again but if I did I would do a few things different. First, I soaked the beans over night and when cooking, they never got soft. I had them in there for 3 hours! I don't know if it was because they were organic or what but I finished it on the stove and that helped some. I used bacon instead of pancetta, I think bacon has a stronger flavor than pancetta so my using 6oz was an over kill for me, I would definitly use less bacon or pancetta next time. The heavy bacon flavor is what turned me off. I would just get canned white beans and use those, no reason for the dried beans and extra work, my extra efforts resulted in hard beans. maybe you'll have better luck.

Fabulous - no reservations for the highest recommendation. I used skinless thighs to cut the fat but otherwise followed the recipe exactly (including soaking the beans overnight), The consistency was stew-like, not soupy (see prior review). Agree that the lemon/rosemary/parsley mixture added even more depth, but it was fabulous before the mixture was added.

This was delicious. I was unable to find dried cannellini beans and as 1 cup dried = 3 cups cooked, I used two 28 ounce cans of Cannellini Beans, drained. I also coudn't find pancetta so used 6 slices of thick sliced bacon. Very easy to cook up and delicious. I served with a crusty bread to soak up the sauce and a simple salad. I agree with the earlier review that the herb and lemon mix really added a wonderful taste dimension to kick this up. Great cold weather dish and it smelled wonderful while it was braising.

I had used great northern beans as I was unable to locate dried cannellini and I used the quick soak method. No time for the overnight soak. I found there was too much broth after removed from oven ..sooooo...after 1 hr in oven I also simmered 1 hr on the stove top uncovered which made it thicken nicely. I am not sure if the quick soak method used on the beans is what caused the recipe to be soupy instead of stew"y" but still absolutley delicious. Simmering on the stove top to finish was the key. Also when serving, the parlsey and lemon peel sprinkled over the stew was like WOW really great, dont skip. It gave this hearty stew a nice light - bright taste. My husband couldnt believe how good this was and he isn't a fan of beans. I would make this again for company. Great on a cold day after ice skating or sleigh riding. Enjoy.
