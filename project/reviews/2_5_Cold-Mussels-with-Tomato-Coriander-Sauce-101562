I served this at a party for 50 people - everyone loved it. It won't convert mussel-haters, but who cares about them. Make sure you use a big whack of coriander and garlic. This is a great make-ahead dish. A definite keeper.

the mexican twist was interesting, but I think the more garlicky spicy red sauces are more palatable--if you eat a lot of mussels, then this would be a welcome change. My mother in law loved them!
