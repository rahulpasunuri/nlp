I make this recipe every fall. It is one of our favorite soup recipes. My 5-year old is not so sure about it, but will eat a little of it. It is always better the second day.

I read most of the reviews and followed the advice to use more apples and garlic, less water. Because of the ingredients on-hand, I ended up using 2 large Fuji apples, 2 large cloves of garlic, 2 stalks celery, 1 and a half or 2 tsp of hot curry powder (Penzey's), 1.5 C of chicken stock (homemade), 1/2 C of apple cider instead of water, 1 C raw milk instead of cream. Other ingredients I followed more or less the same. I thought the soup had excellent flavor, but might leave some of it unprocessed the next time. It did not get really smooth, but stayed somewhat gritty no matter how much I tried to process it. I also will probably leave out the milk next time. I thought it was tasty enough not to need it.

As suggested, I made this soup without the milk, doubled the curry and added some celery, 2 apples and 2 cloves of garlic. I used hot curry and found it to be a bit strong, but my husband and I liked it. The curry a good quality, so maybe I'm just used to the mild stuff. I used 3 14 oz. cans of low salt chicken broth. I thought the flavor was excellent, with the hint of apple flavor. It was nice and thick, and with some good country bread it made a good lunch.

I doubled, tweeked, added, etc. to no avail. Former reviewers are correct: This soup is bland. I am not even sure that apples and cauliflower compliment each other in this soup.

I made several of the changes recommended by other reviewers when I first made this and I STILL had to make changes to make this soup work. My review is of the original recipe cause I cannot even imagine how bland this would have been had I stuck to the recipe as written. With my changes it was ok. I used 1 jumbo sweet onion and added 3 shallots. I used 5 cloves of ROASTED garlic and all chicken stock (home made) I also added 1 celery stalk (diced) to the onions and 1 carrot as well. I increased the apples to 2 large pacific rose apples. I increased the curry powder (madras curry) to 1 tsp (heaping) added 1 tsp of garam masala and ALSO added 1 tsp red curry paste. Even with all those additions this soup was very bland and tasteless when done. To help fix it I added another 1/4c of cream and 2 Tbsp of grated parmesan (could maybe use more cheese, maybe stilton or blue) as well as 2-3 tsp of better than chicken bouillon and even more curry powder maybe another tsp or so and after all THESE changes I decided the soup was pretty good.

took heed and increased curry powder (2 teaspoons curry powder, 1 teaspoon garam masala), 2 small onions, 5 garlic cloves, 3 apples. The cauliflower I purchased weighed in at about 2 1/4 pounds (don't know how many cups) and I omitted the water but used up one 32 oz. package of veggie broth. It definitely needs salt at the end. But really delicious. I can't wait to try it reheated for lunch on Monday.

Awesome soup. I used a Fuji instead of the Granny Smith, omitted the cream and added a little extra broth instead. Didn't realize until the end that I failed to add the water but I'm glad I didn't! Perfect as is.

I took the advice of other reviewers & increased curry power, apple & garlic. I used 2 heaped teaspoons curry powder, added 1 teaspoon garam masala & 1/2 teaspoon tumeric. 2 large granny smith apples; 3 cloves garlic, 2 small onions. I also used 2 cups of my own homemade vegetable stock & replaced the cream with milk. I had to cook longer than specified to get the cauliflower & apple soft. the Soup was AMAZING!

Nice easy soup. Followed advice from others and used 2 apples, 2 garlic cloves. did not add water and replaced with more chicken stock. I didn't have cream on hand and found the soup good without it, but I am sure it would be great with a dash of cream.

Rating: 4
My husband said this was the BEST soup he's ever had. Based on previous reviews, I doubled the apples (used 2), and doubled the curry (Peet's curry is great). We served it with a spinach and feta sald, and petrale sole with lemon and capers, but it's so good it would stand on it's own. When I make it next, I'll add some fresh ginger.

Amazing! I subbed a 1/4 cup milk for heavy cream, but you didnt even need it--the soup is thick enough. I also added carrots in the beginning and doubled the amount of apple and added some ginger. Delicious. Everyone loved it and it's great for a cold day.

I really liked this soup. I didn't add any milk or cream and it was delicious. I used Garam Marsala and curry and garlic powder since I didn't have any garlic. And regular apples. I used an immersion blender. Even with all these changes it was great!!

I made most of the changes other reviewers suggested ie double apples, curry powder, garlic etc. It was still bland and just OK. Not worth it...

Rating: 4
I loved this soup! I used double the apples (just because I had some I needed to use), I doubled the garlic and I used about 3 times the amount of curry powder, also added about half a teaspoon of garam masala as suggested by another reviewer. I used about half vegetable stock and half chicken stock as I ran out of chicken stock, and just added a little cream at the end when serving. I cooked the cauliflower and apple for a little over 30 minutes as it didn't seem soft enough before then. All up, it was a beautiful tasting soup with a great texture and is also excellent after being frozen as I froze some and had it the other day. This one is so simple but so good!

I started with good organic cauliflower, and like other reviewers, I increased the apple and curry powder. I also added butter and a good amount of salt at the end. I served it with a garnish of chopped apple and golden raisins, and a drizzle of cream for a nice decorative bowl. Very easy and very good. I highly recommend.

Rating: 3
After reading the other reviews, I thought that the reason why some complained about the low curry profile was their curry powder was not fresh. To make sure, I bought a new jar and they are right, 1/2 tsp is not sufficient to take this simple soup to another level. Not only did I triple the curry, but I added celery and carrots to increase the flavor. After these changes, the soup is very nice and rather sophisticated. A good appetizer soup for a roast chicken dinner.

Rating: 4
I give this 4 forks based on how easy it is to prepare for the excellent taste payoff. I followed advise re all chicken broth and 3x the curry. I also added another apple and 4 cloves garlic. Just boosted the flavors. I definately recommend the addition of the cream. Tasting before and after adding it convinced me of the HUGE taste benefit for a small amount of fat. This is an easy weeknight dinner with eclat!

I like the base recipe, but it needs some tweaking. Could use another apple. Doubled the curry & garlic, added tsp of garam masala & it still needed more. I probably added 1/2 tsp of each at the end. Lots of black pepper. At the end, Tbls of butter to swirl in. Not a very pretty soup at all, but a good base to start with.

Rating: 3
Delicious. Better the next day! Like many others I used more curry, all broth and skim milk instead of cream.

Rating: 4
Really easy and yummy. Second time I made it, someone ate the last apples (doubled the recipe), so I added about a cup of applesauce instead. Worked like a dream so I do that instead now. Have made it and not added the cream, and its just as good. Adjust the curry and other ingredients to your taste, its a very adaptable soup. Freezes great too.

I make this soup several times each winter. We love it as modified by others- all broth, more garlic and curry, any type of apple, any type of milk/cream, and some salt and pepper. My college bound son asked for this tonight for his "last dinner". That says a lot!

Wow, I'm disappointed. Nothing very special... and I'm not terribly enthusiastic about having to eat it all up, now. Just sort of a white-grayish slop.

Very good, and very easy to make! I would certainly reccommend this recipe.

Delcious soup. I used frozen cauliflower and omitted the water, using all chicken stock (2.5 cups). I also added a healthy pinch of kosher salt at the end and it really brought out the apple taste.

I took the advice of previous reviewers: I used 2 1/2 C of chicken broth, omitted the water, and added 2 generous teaspoons of curry powder. Even my husband enjoyed the soup, and he doesn't like cauliflower! Fooled him - he laughed and finished up his bowl!

Cauliflower is by far one of the most boring vegetables out there, but this soup changed my entire perception of what this veg is capable of. THis soup is unbelievable!!! My boyfriend clamors for it. Which is saying a lot.

I was initially skeptical of this recipe b/c there are so many curried soups using fall veggies. I really wanted a different flavor, but I settled on this one anyway, b/c so many reviewers said it was good tasting w/o the cream. (Low in fat was my second criteria.) My husband and I made this last night and served it with roasted green beans and homemade bread. Like others, we doubled the amount of curry, used all chicken broth instead of part broth part water and sub'ed milk for the cream. The results were delicous! The apple, in particular, is what sets this soup apart from other cauliflower soups. We've also made the cauliflower-stilton soup on this site and really enjoyed it.

Rating: 3
I am making this soup again tonight. It is delicious using the suggested modifications-all broth, more spices. Any type of apple works. I use skim milk or fat free half and half and it's great. Even those who thought they "hated" curry love this soup. A stick blender makes it even easier.

I substituted the heavy cream for 2%milk, and used 1/2 cup of water instead of 1 cup. The soup is so creamy, delicious, and healthy. My 7-year-old wants me to make this every week.

Followed previous advice... 4-5 cloves of garlic, 1 1/2tsp curry, fuji apple, (vegetarian, so 2-1/2 H2O with mock chicken broth powder and 1/2 veg. bouillon), didn't have cream. Took half recipe and slightly pureed it for thicker consistency. Pureed other half until really smooth, adding extras (salt, butter, curry, garam masala). Liked them both... so took ramekins and poured smooth mixture in first and then thicker, less flavored mixture in middle. Topped with a little square of salted butter, ground pepper (most important) and baked in oven. Served with toasted bread and brie cheese for dipping-- This was key to balance the flavors! So Good!!!

Delicious and SO easy to make! Based on the recommendations here, I skipped the water and used all broth. Definitely the right move. I skipped the cream since it really did not need it. I added a bunch of cracked black pepper - otherwise, it is a bit too mild.

Great recipe with some changes. I used 5 cloves of garlic, no water (all chx broth), and a bit of chicken bouillion. Pressure cooked it for 10 minutes, then pureed it. Instead of cream, I used EVAPORATED milk. Didn't use butter. Turned out creamy, and spicy with the Madras Curry Powder I used.

Rich, creamy, delicious! Used all stock, no water and opted for half-n-half instead of heavy cream. Also sprinked a bit of cinnamon on top before serving, which went well with the apple flavor. Yum!

This soup was amazing. I didn't think that you could get cauliflower to taste this good. It was extremely easy to make, but the cauliflower took longer than 15-20 min to cook. Next time I would use more curry, garlic, and chicken stock to increase flavour.

I loved this soup -- quite easy for the result...I, too, used more garlic, at least 50% more curry, and mostly chicken stock. It is fabulous -- I did use a bit of whole milk in place of the cream...and it was still very tasty.

Rating: 3
I followed the advice of the cook who used all chicken broth instead of part water, twice the curry powder, and skipped the cream. It was good, although I think the cream would add a wonderful richness. But I rarely use cream, and wanted to see how this would turn out. Definitely worth it when cauliflower is plentiful and cheap.

Rating: 4
Oh, this is a really good one! I used more garlic, double the curry it called for, 100% chicken broth (in lieu of water), and it was so good that I didn't add the cream (and I looove cream -- it simply didn't need it). Our freezer will be well stocked with this soup to enjoy all winter long.

This is a DELICIOUS and simple to make soup! I substituted whole milk for the cream(calories) and it worked great! Everyone thought it was exotic and raved! I froze a small quantity for a future meal! Yummy!

This is in my top ten of comforting soups. Not only is it tasty, you can make it when you think you have nothing for dinner - Even when made with a couple macintosh apples temporarily lost in the fruit drawer, but no worse for their seclusion, and cauliflower from the freezer, it is still delicious. Always having a good stock/broth on hand does make a difference however.

I thought it was good but it needed a little extra something. I added a little Garam Masala and I used a little more curry than what was recommended.

Rating: 3
I followed some of the previous suggestions and doubled the curry, and next time I'll add even more! Do consider following the suggestions of others (who have tried and succeded with some changes!) and, for this soup, add only broth and NO water, or else it will be bland. I used vegetable broth and made this a vegetarian dish... a very yummy soup on a cold winter night!

I'll have to disagree on this one as well. There's nothing technically wrong with this recipe.. I just didn't enjoy the taste.

A lovely soup, with good heat (if you up the curry x2 or x3) and a nice combination of flavors. I used four cloves of garlic and two apples, and only broth (no water). The cream rounds it out perfectly.

Very delicate flavors: this soup is easy and elegant. Next time I will also add more apple and a bit more curry, just because I like those particular ingredients. I would be proud to serve it to guests as a first course.

What a great and easy soup. I agree you can add more apple, garlic, etc. I also cut the amount of cream in half. Can't see any reason for the extra calories and fat.

I would recommend adding extras to taste. This is the most delicious soup and so easy to make. I have served it both hot and cold to rave reviews. I actually had something similar in an upscale restaurant in LA and was determined to find a recipe. This one is just as good - if not better...depending upon the cook. ;)

I have made this soup a few times and on the advice of some of the reviewers I upped the curry (1 1/2 tsp.) and doubled the apple. I always add more garlic than the recipe calls for so that was naturally increased too. I also added very old grated cheddar - not a lot - about 1/2 cup, but I put some more out to add to the soup when it is served. I have not served this to guests as yet so I don't bother with garnish. After pureeing, I strain it using a fine seive. This is a personal preference as I don't like my soups grainy. This is a delicious soup - a really terrific way to use old (or new) cauliflower. Another keeper!

Very tasty! I would recomend 1 1/2 times the apple, and a little more curry as well. A fabulous soup that is also very inexpensive to create.

This was surprisingly good! I added two apples per the recommendation of other reviews. I did not add the cream because I forgot and it tasted great anyway. Before serving, I sprinkled some white cheddar cheese on top of each bowl and broiled them in the oven and then added some chopped apples on top. Delicious!

Simple and delicious solution to the cauliflower problem. I also doubled the curry. And I drizzled the cream in at serving time, which made a nice presentation for an unpretentious soup. Also excellent cold!

Good soup, very easy to make. I've made it twice now and the second time I cooked the Califlower a bit longer to soften. Also, I used 1 1/2 apples to add some additional flavor. Sourdough bread or croutons are strongly recommended as they compliment the flavor of the soup.

I had aging cauliflower and was short on time, so I decided to try this recipe. Although skeptical from the first, it was really quite good. Like other reviewers, I upped the curry content (accidentally, in my case!), and I greatly enjoyed the results.

I made this last evening for company. It was a hit. I left out the cream and added another tablespoon of butter at the end. I also used another cup of cauliflower because I had extra. The curry flavor is very subtle. For color, I added some diced red bell pepper on top for contrast just before serving. It seemed very health and I will make it again.

Rating: 3
This was delicious. Very subtle flavor, even with additional curry added. It also took a bit longer for the cauliflower to be tender enough to puree. I made croutons by toasting large pieces of sourdough baguette, the first time. I'm just about to make it again tonight(!)

I added about 3 times the amount of curry and no cream, also I mashed it instead of puree-ing. (Why wash another gadget? :)) My clients liked this one very much too!

I used a veggie stock. Next time I'll try chicken stock and not puree the soup. Also some grated cheese would help.

I had this soup for the first time on Thanksgiving. It was absolutely fabulous. The soup is very fresh tasting. You can cut down on the cream in the recipe without altering the flavor. If you do make this soup, please try and use a fresh stock. It really makes a difference.
