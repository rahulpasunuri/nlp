Great idea for a light and refreshing adult dessert. I used Rose Moscato and 2 oz of passionfruit liqueur. I would describe these as epicurean jello shots.

I thought this was a nice light adult dessert for a hot humid summer evening. I would make this again and maybe experiment with the flavours a bit. Perhaps by adding cassis syrup in place of the Peach Schnapps next time.
