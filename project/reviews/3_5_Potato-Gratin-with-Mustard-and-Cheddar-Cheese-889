Absolutely incredible! I reduced the recipe to only use 3lbs of potatoes for a 6-person dinner party, and it totally stole the show (it almost outshone the roast lamb loin persillade, http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Roast-Lamb-Loin-Persillade-14269, which came out beautifully). Perhaps since I reduced the recipe, I had no issue with it taking too long. Because I had other stuff that needed to be in the oven at 350, I followed the baking directions for the Potato Gratin recipe, and put it in at 350 for an hour, and then turned it up to 425 with no cover to brown the cheese for 10, and then 10-15 to rest before serving. The potatoes came out perfect all the way through. Also, I personally do not like mustard, so I cut the mustard down to 1T; I assume if you like mustard that the full 6T for the full recipe would be good (1 gave the 3/5 size recipe a nice subtle flavor). I didn't measure the thyme, salt and pepper -- I just sprinkled a little on each layer before adding the cheese. Everyone was amazed that I only used a little over 1/2 c cream - the flour mixed with the cheese makes the dish incredibly creamy without requiring a lot of heavy cream. I can't wait to eat it again (there weren't any leftovers!)

On of my all time favorite go to sides. Use Maille dijon! Careful, it does take a long time to cook. Cover with foil for the first half of the cook time to speed up the process a bit.

Made many adjustments using what I had on hand: smoked cheddar, veggie broth, crushed Stacey's pita chips in place of bread crumbs. Omitted mustard. Technique was the same. Turned our creamy with a crisp topping. Excellent flavor. Will make again and again.

Following previous advice, I used less thyme, only 2 teas., and it was still WAY overpowering. I wonder if the recipe should read "fresh", not "dried". If I try again, I would try maybe 1/2 a teas.

Mad at these potaotes. Made them a day ahead, baked for 1 hour. Then brought them to room temp, and baked for seriously another 1.5 hours and still slightly crunchy potatoes in the middle. I would have left them in longer but my MIL was rushing me..... Annoyed.

This is such a great comfort dish. The potato with dijon is a perfect compliment to ham. Wonderful holiday dish!

This is one of my favorite recipes.. Very hearty and a nice alternative to regular mashed potatoes. I used monterey cheese which worked out fine. The dijon mustard cream sauce is amazing! I highy recommend this dish...

Gave this 4 forks because it was so easy, yet so flavorful! I forgot to buy white bread at the store, so I used some panko I had on hand. I would definitely use the panko again, as it added a nice light crunch to an otherwise heavy dish.

I've been making this recipe since it was first printed in Bon Appetit in 1995 and I've never served it to anyone who didn't rave about it. I make it all year round and, if you are making it for a dinner party, it works well to make ahead of time but finish the last 30 minutes just before dinner.

We make this at least twice a year. A half-recipe fits perfectly in a 13x9 pan and easily serves 8 with leftovers. If you use home-made stock or broth, DO NOT skip the salt.

If you are trying to decide what potato recipe to serve with an Easter ham, this is definitely the one! Rich, zingy, and delicious. I've been making it since it first appeared in the 90's, and no matter what other "au gratin potatoes" we try, I always come back to this dish. Do skip the salt; do use the best, sharpest cheddar you can find; and do add a little garlic to the butter before toasting the breadcrumbs. You won't regret it.

This is one dish I make over and over again. Very delicious.

Rating: 4
Very easy, very good. My picky kid loved it and so did I. A previous review mentioned that the dish gets too brown if cooked completely in the oven. I took care of this by covering with foil until the last 20 minutes. Potatoes were cooked thoroughly but the dish was just a beautiful golden brown. This is a keeper!

This is our family favorite potato dish! We slice the russet potatoes very thin, and wash and DRY them with paper towels. We add steamed kale, chopped and squeezed dry, and we add a white onion carmelized on the stove in olive oil and butter (1 tbsp each). After we assemble the dish we MICROWAVE, yes microwave, it for 20-30 min until the potatoes are softened. Then we bake it at 350-400 until the whole thing is bubbly and brown and so delicious! If we bake without microwaving it browns before the potatoes are soft enough. We also prefer cheese on top instead of bread crumbs. THE BEST GRATIN!

Easily the best potato gratin recipe I've ever made - absolutely spectacular flavor, certain to become a mainstay -

What a great dish! Used half cheddar and gruyere. Also, turned flour into a dark blond roux then whisked with chicken stock. Use good mustard, Just Awesome.

Rating: 3
Very rich and tasty. Most potato gratins are bland despite being quite bad for you; this one is very flavorful with the cheddar (do use good-quality cheddar) and mustard (ditto). It went great with a peppery beef tenderloin; I was thinking of doing it for Thanksgiving but it might overwhelm the mild turkey. Is it huge -- I halved it and it still made 6 hefty servings.

Rating: 4
This serves a lot of people. I made for 9 and had enough left over for two more meals. Based on some of the previous comments about saltiness, I purchased a white cheddar that was less salty than some of the choices. I also used a chicken broth with the lowest amount of sodium I could find and mixed only a pinch of salt with the thyme. Came out perfect.

Very good dish with beef. Forgot the crumbs on top, but wasn't missed.

I have made many gratin potato dishes and this recipe is by far the best ever. I've made this many times and always use vegetable broth in place of the chicken and don't skimp on the mustard. This goes great with all kinds of grilled or roasted meat. A definite keeper.

Rating: 4
This is an unbelievably good, decadant gratin that you can't go wrong with. I added the breadcrumbs in the last thirty minutes, since they were already toasted, and used slightly less dijon mustard; it's salty but not too much for me. A crowd pleaser.

This has become a tradition at Christmas for my family. I get compliments from everyone who tries it. I use Half & Half instead of whipping cream; cut the mustard in half (still tastes great, but not as strong), and use Yukon gold potatoes. I've made w/ yellow Cheddar once, but I think the sharper white cheddar is better (I buy Cabot's for this). Definitely use low salt broth and maybe use a bit less added salt. Yum!

Rating: 3
Whoa!! Was this salty! I halved the recipe and actually quartered the amount of salt and it was still too much. I used chicken broth with 1/3 as much sodium as regular and I think this was my mistake. You really do need the lowest salt broth you can find. That being said, this dish was still delicious and I'll cetainly make it again with the above changes. I guess mustard and cheese are both fairly salty in themselves, so you really do have to watch the added salt. We had this with our Easter ham and a mixed green salad to balance the richness and it was a huge hit with our guests. I reduced the thyme too and still found it was quite strong enough.

This was a hit at Thanksgiving. I had alot of guests so the original amount was good. For fewer people I will cut it in half. I also used yellow cheddar (couldn't find white) and it had a beautiful golden yellow color when baked up.

Rating: 3
great dish, but a few instruction modifications --first, use a higher pan, the sauce will boil over and make a mess of the oven. Second, adding some fresh herbs with the dijon sauce will help to make the dish absolutely memorable. As it stands now, this is a serviceable staple for most menus.

This was a great recipe and received rave reviews. Peeling the potatoes is never fun - next time I'll just buy the largest ones I can find.

I cut this recipe in half and turned it into a casserole. I added about a pound of grilled chicken breast and two packages of frozen spinach (defrosted and water squeezed out) that I layered along with the other ingredients. Only could fit in two layers this way, but still turned out tasty.

Rating: 4
Loved it. Must go out and buy a bigger pan. Cooked it in a 9x13 and it dripped all over the oven and also had to cook it longer. I don't know if the mustand made the difference or not but what great flavor. Works well by cutting the receipe in half.

This is a great potato recipe; but there are quite a few killer potato recipes on this website and when compared to them, I decided this one was a three-forker instead of four. I took another reviewer's advice of baking half the recipe in a 13x9 pan. It worked fine, but I thought it was a little flat for presentation. I might try putting it in a smaller pan next time so it looks a little thicker. Using a mandoline to slice the potatos makes this recipe a snap.

Best Potatoes Ever. This is a recipe I keep coming back to, and I like it more each time. The mustard-white cheddar combination is unique and flavorful and really makes this dish stand out without overpowering its plate mates. It's become an Easter -and- Thanksgiving tradition for me.

The blend of the flavors was sooo good! Three forks for taste! Easy to do! Instead of measuring, I sprinkled each layer with what I thought an appropriate amount of the ingredients. 1 fork for ease of recipe. A 4 fork keeper!

Truly some of the most delicious potatoes I've ever eaten. The combination of the thyme, mustard, and sharp cheddar has a bit of a bite to it, but is so good! Read the recipe twice before you start, as I was surprised by the extra hour and my 9x13x2 pan was not big enough.

Rating: 4
Outstanding accompaniment. A giant hit with friends who love great food and are great cooks themselves. Cannot be beaten by any fine restaurant! Be sure to use a food processor with slicer blade - no more than 2mm thick, or you will be forever in "prep" mode.

I usually make this without the bread crumbs, though I do sprinkle shredded parmesan over the top toward the edn to give it some visual appeal. (I've made it with both yellow and white cheddar, too, with success.) For company I make half the recipe in a 13x9 for a generous 8 servings, or a quarter recipe in a 9x9 for 4 nice-sized helpings with no leftovers. Coating the cheese with flour is a great trick to keep the sauce uniform and creamy.

Magnificent blend of flavors. Additionally, the texture of the potatoes was wonderful. Golden and crunchy on top, tender and cheesy inside. I would be proud to serve these potatoes at any dinner.

I made this as a wonderful substitute for the usual roast potatoes on Thanksgiving. I added sauteed leeks and shallots, which made it very rich amd flavorful.

Great recipe--try adding bacon and fried white onins--layered, first mix the cream with the mustard and place on bottom of pan--follow with a thin layer of potatoe, cream & mustard, then the fried bacon, fried onion and grated cheese--and so on and so on(keep layering)!!! Don't forget the fresh herbs!!!!! Cheers from Canada!

I really enjoyed this recipe, although I ended up doing some substituting for some ingredients. I didn't have them all and didn't have time to go out and buy them. I used cheddar cheese instead of white, whole milk for the cream, and no Dijon. I had to cut the recipe in half too because I didn't need 5lbs of potatoes. However, it still turned out just fine.

A great dish! Easy to make, wonderful flavors. Just prepare and put in the oven. Perfect!

Perhaps substituting rosemary for the thyme (or omitting any herb) would be an improvement. There are so many more delicious (and healthier) potato recipes from which to choose.

This was such a hit at our New Year's Eve party this year! It was very easy to make (Threw it together that afternoon)! The combination of the white cheddar cheese and mustard and thyme was just great. I didn't stray from the recipe at all. Since the party I have sent this recipe to five of my friends because their husbands loved it! Thanks for sharing!

I made these potatoes for Christmas Eve dinner they were a terrific side dish for our honey baked ham, beef tenderloin, green salad with manderin oranges, etc. I used half & half instead of heavy cream and didn't use all the bread crumbs. I also felt that there was way too much liquid. I felt you only needed half the chicken broth. I'm surprised that no one else mentioned this. I was removing it at the end of the baking time.

I served this for dinner last night and my husband and I thought it was great. If you're looking for standard au gratin potatoes - this isn't it. Unlike other reviewers we found the combination of flavors to be interesting. I will probably make this for Easter Dinner. When reviewing the recipe I missed the 1 hour part of the cooking time! so I ended up having to cut it back. The potatoes were cooked but I think next time I will cover them for the first 30 minutes. I substituted evaporated non-fat milk for the cream and it did not compromise the flavor. I usually omit salt or reduce it in any recipe so saltiness was not an issue.

Rating: 3
The first time I made this, I made it exactly according to the recipe(except for the low-salt broth which I can't find in Greece). It was so salty that it was nearly inedible, and I thought the flavor was strange too which I attributed to too much mustard. I only made it again because they were the creamiest potatoes gratin I've ever made. The next time, I cut the salt down to 1 tsp and cut the mustard in half and have found the perfect recipe! It is delicious, with no strange taste from the thyme (at the full amount called for).

utterly fantastic. Served it with ham for Christmas Eve dinner and raves all around. This is a keeper.

I have mixed feelings about this dish. It was indeed easy, but the taste had to be acquired to be enjoyed. It had a strange tang, perhaps because of the brand of cheddar used. Also, if I made this again, I would not toast the breadcrumbs before assembling the dish. Since it had to bake for such a long time, the breadcrumbs came out too toasted and dark brown.

I made this dish for the first time for Thanksgiving in 1995. It is now a favorite fall and winter dish. Very easy to make. I do use more bread crumbs than called for. This is one of those dishes that keeps the chill of winter at bay. Always receives rave reviews from friends and family.

Over the last 4 years, this has become a favorite at holiday time, as well as for potlucks and buffets. I also cut down on the salt,but aside from that, keep pretty close to the recipe. I love using Tillamook's aged sharp white cheddar, which is carried at Costco.

I made this for a big family lunch with grilled steak sandwiches. It was very good. I doubled the breadcrumbs, and just sprinkled the salt, pepper, and thyme between layers. I ended up using much less salt than the recipe calls for, but used the called-for amount of thyme and pepper. All of my guests loved this dish. I have also found that it divides well - I made a third of a batch for just my husband and I to try it before I served it to guests.

I make this casserole every year for our Christmas Open House buffet. So many people have asked for this recipe! I use packaged flavored bread crumbs and Country Dijon mustard (a bit grainier and more robust).

Wonderful recipe! I made half in a 7"x12" glass dish, but used the full recipe of buttered bread crumbs on top. Instead of measuring the salt, pepper, and thyme, I lightly sprinkled each layer to taste, using much less thyme than called for in the recipe. It was delicious with my Easter ham, and I will definitely make it again!

I thought it was a tremendous dish, and I followed the suggestions made by Lisa on 2-11-99; however, I used a 13 by 9 dish and thought the thyme was a little bit strong -- I would suggest cutting back to about 1/2 to 3/4 of a Tablespoon of thyme.. Otherwise, enjoy!!!

Ok, it's not low-cal, but it is delicious. I added a dash of cayenne to the flour/cheese mixture and it gave it a zip, but it wasn't too hot. Also, I used only half the amount of whipping cream called for and used regular milk for the other half. It didn't seem to change the dish, the potatoes are still in a delictable creamy cheese sauce! Worth the calories.
