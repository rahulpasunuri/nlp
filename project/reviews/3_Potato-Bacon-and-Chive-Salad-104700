In my opinion this was lacking in flavor. I could taste a hint of vinegar but not much bacon or onion flavor. I cooked my bacon until crispy but after sitting in the liquid it became soft and soggy. Not what I was expecting.

This is a very good potato salad...and I live in Germany where this recipe probably originated. Take the advice of other reviewers, however: decrease the beef broth by half (at least) -- keep the vinegar. I'd bet that Yukon gold or Idaho white potatoes, however, soak up more liquid, so pay attention to the starch content. Very tasty, though.

My husband really loved this salad! I read that some had trouble getting the liquid to absorb, but mine was absorbed within a couple of minutes. My potatoes were fully cooked and were able to take on the liquid. I used red potatoes and did not skin them. That added some color as well. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and was very happy with it.

If I made this again, I'd make sure I got the bacon really crispy and reserved some to throw on top when serving. My bacon did indeed get soggy and the whole mess looked like the interior of a pot pie rather than a savory and attractive side dish. I think I'd definitely use less liquid than called for--maybe one-third cup of each. I suspect, however, that the quality of the potatoes may make or break this dish and mine were a little old. Hmm... I'm talking myself into trying it again, so I clearly have mixed feelings about this recipe.

I MADE THIS TODAY AND IT WAS A BIG HIT WITH MY HUSBAND AND KIDS,I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT TOO. THIS IS A CHANGE FROM THE TRADITIONAL POTATO SALAD,I TOO USED RED WINE VINEGAR. A KEEPER.

Since all I had on hand was balsamic vinegar and no white wine vinegar, I just used the balsamic. With the balsamic, the salad came out nicely sweet and only slightly tangy. It's got a very good flavour. The onions became a nice brown colour, next time I'll try it with some red or purple potatoes and the balsamic.

This dish tasted good if you like tang. My problem was how it looks. The only color came from the chives. The bacon was soggy looking and the dressing didn't absorb, puddling at the bottom of the bowl. Will try a different recipe next time.

This is great if you like a tangy salad. We loved it with barbequed chicken! I added a finely chopped stalk of celery and some fresh sweet red pepper to the cooking onion to add more flavor and color. I have an abundance of fresh chives which you need for this recipe. I think I might try thickening the liquid a little with some cornstach. It was a hit!

This was wonderful--tangy and flavorful! A huge hit.
