I can't imagine a scalloped potato dish more delicious than this one! I made it this past Sunday for Easter dinner, and everyone raved (kids and adults alike!) I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out as I was preparing it. It seemed like too little cheese, and the cream mixture didn't even come half way up the pan. But I crossed my fingers, and the results were outstanding. As other reviewers have said, look no further for the perfect scalloped potato dish. Awesome!

This was very good. I added more cheese than the recipe called for but I will add even more the next time I make this and cook it about 10 minutes longer. The potatoes were slightly al dente. My guests thought it was great but I thought it should have been more tender and the cheese taste could have been stronger.

It tasted great but way too rich. Fresh herbs and the 2 kinds of potatoes were wonderful, just not too sure how to make it a little more healthy. I'm not a fanatic, just careful.

this is delicious! I have a very picky husband who does not like mushy food, sweet potatoes or scalloped potates and he loved it. unbelievable - I finally found a recipe he likes. I halved the recipe, but still used about 3/4 T of herbs and the 2 closes of garlic.

I have made this twice now and find the sweet potatoes add an odd flavor to the gratin. I think the strength of the Gruyere almost competes with the sweetness - and not in a good way. I would leave out either the sweet potatoes or the cheese.

Made with sweet potatoes only. Excellent. Will try with dried herbs next time to save time.

This recipe is fantastic. I have made it for four consecutive Thanksgivings and always to rave reviews. (The first time I made it I went to a Thanksgiving celebration with a recent winner of Top Chef who asked who made it and said it was a "perfect blend of sweet and savory.") It was so good on Thursday that I am making it for another dinner tomorrow. The only thing I do is add more of all the herbs, except the rosemary and I double the garlic. Try this recipe. You won't be disappointed.

This was amazingly good. I didn't have any fresh herbs but the dried ones work well. I just had to cut down on the amount. It also took longer than the times they suggested. I guess I like my scalloped potatoes a bit more tender. All-in-all an absolutely delicious recipe.

This foolproof recipe always receives universally rave reviews! Sounds more complicated than it is perhaps but its worth all the chopping and slicing, hands down. I have made this at least 5-6 times and finally am adding to my thanksgiving roster as its that fantastic! I'm a garlic fan so always add a couple more cloves to the mix, definitely more cheese (by half), as well as a bit (but not too much or overpowering, probably by half as well) more herbs. It does come out of the oven with liquid but never fear... it sets beautifully and quickly. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
Delicious recipe! People who were not fans of traditional sweet potatoes were pleasantly surprised by this savory variation. The amount of cream the recipe calls for is not enough to "submerge" the potatoes, but submerging isn't necessary. Ours baked up very nicely without being covered in cream. Will definitely be coming back to this dish again and again!

Brought this to a potluck and it was a huge crowd pleaser. None left for seconds! Would definitely suggest using fresh herbs, and I kept mine in the oven for 5 extra minutes because there was a lot of liquid but it did set really well during the car ride over so I don't even think that was necessary. Absolutely will add this to my favorites!

So simple and so good. I made as directed except with equal parts Swiss and Fontina cheese. It looked a little dry after assembly but before putting in the oven so I drizzled on a little extra cream, but then it took longer to cook and was a bit runny. Would have been perfect if I had held back that extra cream, so I suggest making as directed. Served with slow-cooker boneless short ribs for a Sunday dinner.

I followed the recipe exactly and it separated for me too -- watery, grease slick and cheese goo. Maybe too much for the starch from the potatoes was lost from standing the water before assembling? Not inclined to try this one again.

Absolutely delicious. The combo of the potatoes were terrific. The fresh herbs really elevated this gratin. Made for Christmas Eve dinner, was a HIT..... I did add minced shallots to the recipe for the mild flavor. Will make this recipe again and again.

I gotta say -- compared to the effort I put into everything else for Thanksgiving dinner, I sorta used this recipe as my 'phone in' for another starch dish -- it seemed too easy and too simple to really be all that good. So I was wrong. Got more compliments on this than anything else -- the fresh herbs make the deal (don't cop out and go with dried). I may have used a little more cheese than called for -- but what's wrong with that? Making it again (by request) for Christmas dinner. WOW.

This is a fabulous side dish that will inspire all to give lots of compliments to the chef! I had to use some russet potatoes with the Yukon Gold after discovering I'd purchased a few spoiled ones. However,that and using low-fat milk were the only alterations I made to this recipe. The key to success is towel drying the potatoes so excess moisture doesn't cause curdling when in the oven.

This took a little while to make, but it was enjoyable...The aromas that filled the house were incredible! The dish did not disappoint at all!

I made this recipe, to the letter, for Thanksgiving last year and the only negative is that I didn't double it. It was scraped clean by every guest and was simply outstanding.

Just made this with some changes & love it. I needed to use up 1 yam & 1 russet, which together weighed half the total amount called for -- so I made half the recipe in an 8"x8" pan. No fresh herbs on hand, so used dried herbes de Provence -- no cream, so used undiluted evaporated milk -- halved the butter to avoid greasiness -- no Gruyere or Gouda on hand & I didn't think that Cheddar or Parmesan sounded good with yams, so used bleu -- halved the salt due to the strong cheese. It baked fine in the time given by the recipe (that may be because I used a mandolin to be sure the yam & potato were sliced thin enough). I didn't soak the potatoes, just kept the slices wrapped in damp towels until they were used (that may be why it didn't come out watery -- I did let it stand 10 minutes per directions). The bleu cheese taste is strong, as are the dried herbs, but I like that -- if I were serving others, I'd probably tone both of those down a little. Excellent recipe, especially good for a crowd. Thanks!

Mmm, the Scalloped Yukon and Sweet Potato Gratin with Fresh Herbs still remains one of my favorite epi recipes. It's a somewhat lengthy recipe by the time you peel potatoes, mince the herbs, grate the cheese and bake for an hour, but the results are well worth it. I wouldn't substitute fresh herbs for dry herbs in this recipe. Very rich, very delicious.

I made this dish for Christmas day dinner, and it accompanied lamb. Delicious! I used half and half instead of heavy whipping cream, and added another 4-5 cloves of garlic. I baked it early morning and just had to reheat it for dinner. In between the two bakes, I skimmed off about a 1/2 cup of fat - it wasn't incorporating and it didn't need to be there. This will definitely be made again - it's very flexible!

Made this for Christmas Eve dinner with ham and broccoli. Wonderful tastes! I have to admit I forgot to get gruyere and instead used a four cheese mix I had on hand. Also used half chicken broth and half cream. If I do that next time, I'll cut down on the salt. Still sooo good and people loved it.

I made this dish for my first Thanksgiving dinner and it was to die for, literally. It was worth all the cutting and the calories. I would recommend a mandolin to save on time.

I have made this numerous times - I always add a container of creme fraiche and add a couple of shallots. This year I had a lot left over so I decided to puree the gratin and added some organic chicken broth to make a wonderful thick soup. The whole family loved it!

For those of you who need a lighter version, I switched the whipping cream for non-fat milk and flour ( I made a roux first, mixing flour into the melted butter w/garlic and then slowing adding the milk as it incorporated) Probably added too much flour (3/4 c)--probably would only use 1/3 cup next time. I also substituted parmesan for the gruyare and used less. The recipe was still delicious!

after reading some of the other reviews it dawned on me that i should probably post that i always do this recipe the day before all the way through. i leave it in the fridge, covered, and leave the tinfoil on it when i pop it in the oven the next day. i cook it at about 350-400 (depending on what else i happen to have in the oven) for about 20-30 mins just until it is heated through. i have never had an issue with it being to watery but that's probably because it has so much time to sit after it's taken out of the oven the first time. i also switch the whipping cream for half and half and reduce the amount of butter just to lighten it up a little. works out perfectly every time and i love that it can be done ahead so i have one less thing to worry about when doing a big feast! love it!!

this recipe is EXCELLENT!! I have made it a couple times now, the last being for a pot-luck and I have to say it was one of the only dishes that got eaten completely! one guy even went for thirds lol I like the fact that allot of it can be made ahead of time.

I made this recipe again, and this time it was a winner! Instead of using all the whip cream, made a lighter version with chicken stock and sprinkled a bit of flour over layers---was SO delicious, all fresh herb flavours were no longer overpowered by all the fat. Seriously, you must try this way! I think it's better than the original!

This is an odd dish. I read the comments regarding the grease and thought it was due to the cheese/ butter. I followed the suggestions and backed off the butter and paid for the very nice expensive cheese and it still seperated badly! It looked discusting... but people raved about it and went back for more. I might try it with a different cheese, but I am not sure as it was just nasty looking.

This is so delicious and I make it often but use 2% milk instead of the whipping cream and add a bit of cream cheese to thicken it. I also cut back a bit on the butter but am very generous with the herbs and garlic. Definitely not the same creamy texture as with the whipping cream but I think the flavor is just as good and I'm not feeling so terribly guilty about the fat content.

Whole family loved it!Husband made this for Easter dinner. Had to convince him to pick this recipe as he is not a huge fan of sweet potatoes. Fairly easy and absolutely delicious. Will most likely become the staple potato dish for family dinners. Did leave dish in oven (turned off)for approx 20 mins prior to our 30 minute drive so no issue with extra liquid.

Rating: 4
Really delicious, fairly easy to make. I used 2lbs of each potato and cut them 1/4 inch instead, cooked it an extra 10-15 mins by accident and I think that helped the thickening. It sat for an hour before it was served and I had no problems with the amount of liquid. An excellent dish!!

Rating: 4
Absolutely terrific. Easily the best scalloped potatoes I have ever had. I used our mandolin and it took less time than I thought (though chopping the herbs was time consuming). The recipe calls for putting the sliced potatoes in water, but I recently saw a tip on the Food Network that suggests NOT doing that in order to preserve the natural starches. These starches help thicken the liquid once it comes out of the oven, which was my experience. I didn't have any issues with too much liquid at all.

I made this recipe as written except for the advice from earlier cooks and upped both kinds of potatoes to 2 lbs. and the gruyere cheese to 2 cups for Christmas dinner at my brother's house. After baking it, I placed it in a box on top of several layers of towels and put more towels on top of the foil for the 45 min. drive. Then it had to sit in its box for another 20-30 min before dinner. But even though they looked a little too liquid when they came out of the oven, by the time they had set, covered, for more than an hour, they were perfect! And the temperature was the perfect serving temperature as well. Everyone loved them and I brought home a clean, empty dish. This one makes my permanent list of easy, elegant holiday dishes and one that travels well to boot.

great recipe. my husband is not a fan of sweet potato - so I used two kinds of white/yellow potatoes - also substituted 1/4 cup of cheese with Smoked Gruyere which added a great flavor. Definitely agree on the 'liquid' comment, but if you put under Broiler for a few minutes and the really let it rest for 10 min - it set up nicely! Also, not that it saved calories - but I did 1 cup Heavy cream and 1 cup 1/2 1/2 to make myself feel better :) - and it did not affect the taste - and made me feel better ?? YUMMIEEEEEE!

This was one of the worst recipes I have ever tried on epicurious. Given the rest of the reviews, maybe it was my brand of gruyere. It ended up with all the oil coming out of the cheese and rising to the top, with the milk solids all left behind. Then the green leached out of the herbs, leaving a weird green tint to the very soupy sauce. Wow-what a disappointment.

This recipe was great I really liked the addition of the herbs. I did however make a few changes; I used soy milk instead of whipping cream and I only used 1 1/4 cup and I reduced the butter to 1/8 cup. I also didn't have any Gruyere Cheese so I used Gouda.

Rating: 4
Wonderful recipe. I increased to 2 lb. of each kind of potato, and cheese to 8 oz. grated. I brought cream with butter and garlic very slowly to a simmer. As it baked it was "milky" as another review stated, but it all soaked in as I let the dish set after baking. No problem with "greasiness" as other stated. Fresh herbs a must. I took it to a Christmas potluck and received raves! Highly recommend... it's a new favorite.

SOOOO GOOD!! I loved it and will keep this recipe forever. The one thing i would like to work on is the slices of potato b/c it appeared that the yam cooks a little bit faster than the yukon gold... so maybe next time i will try to make the yam slices a bit slimmer.

This recipe was WONDERFULLY DELICIOUS! I added 1 whole onion sliced thin as a layer (mandolin thin). I also processed the spices in a food processor with just a little bit of the liquid before adding them to the rest of the liquid and pouring over the potatoes. My husband and 13 year old son LOVED this dish and it is now a favorite. I think it would go excellent with a baked ham, chicken or turkey.

Very good dish. The slight sweetness from the yams is a welcome addition. This is a can't miss for any entertaining. I never have yams outside of the holidays and this recipe guarantees that yams will be part of my cooking year round. There are several reviews stating that the amount of liquid is too much and that the cooking time is not accurate. Neither were true for me. With gratins it is very important not to have too many layers and to allow the dish to rest for a MINIMUM of ten minutes.

I followed the recipe carefully (no substitutions or additions). I found the flavors to be excellent particularly using the fresh herbs. However, there was far too much liquid and even with additional baking time, I was required to use a strainer at the end. Either reduce the liquid to 1-1.5 cups during the simmer or reduce the liquid used altogether. "Two cups of heavy whipping cream" could probably be reduced to 1-1.5 cups.

This dish is outstanding!! This might be my new favorite recipe. I make it with less potatoes (probably 1/2 that amount) and a little less cheese (maybe 3oz), but the whole amount of liquid (I use half and half). I also doubled the amount of herbs (minus parsley, I didn't have so I didn't use) and garlic and then baked it in a 8"x8" pan (3 layers). It's perfect for company because you can do it ahead and then just bake.

Just right...Made these to accompany a tenderloin roast for a special dinner party for my brothers and their wives. It was a perfect side for the simple roast....I used 1/3 sweet and 2/3 yukon and liked that ratio better than the 1/2 and 1/2 suggested. The falvors were perfect. Make it ahead....sooooo nice....a keeper.

Despite the fact that I had a mini-panic and poured out half the cream, this dish turned out wonderfully. I hadnt made potatoes au gratin in a while and the ratio of liquid to potato just seemed wrong when the baking time was up, so i poured some excess out, before letting it stand to come together. Had i not, it probably wouuld have been super creamy but instead, it was tight but not dry with the flavors all absorbed into the potato.... My guess still raved and polished the pan clean, but my advice is to not second guess yourself if the liquid looks overpowering.

Fabulous recipe! I made it twice over the holidays -- both times using all Yuxon Gold potatoes instead of the sweet potatoes -- and everyone raved about it.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was the highlight of the meal. I had to cook it longer as others did - about an hour and a half. I agree it could use more salt as well - probably about a teaspoon more. I also reduced the butter by about half as it didn't seem necessary with all the cream. What a fantastic dish - the gruyere with the mix of the potatoes was so delicious and got rave reviews from my guests.

This recipe has tons of potential, and I have to say, my leftovers are fantastic. (I served it Christmas Day). But as written, this recipe is very frustrating because it takes so much longer to cook than the instructions say. Even though from the reviews I knew to cook it longer, and budgeted 30+ extra minutes of cooking time, the potatoes were still too hard and had not absorbed the sauce. I needed about 2 hours cooking time for the potatoes (primarily the Yukon Golds) to be tender. I'm going to either try par boiling the potatoes a bit first to get them started cooking, or review some other gratin recipes using these ingredients. The flavors are great, but it is not a reliable recipe for serving company due to the uncertain cooking time. It seems quite a few other cooks had the same problem.

I followed the recipe to a T. I discovered, like few others, that the cooking time is not correct. It requires 1hr in the oven wrapped in foil and another 40 minutes without the foil, to allow the liquid to be fully absorbed. This recipe requires more salt than called for, double the quantity required for sure, same with the black pepper. The quantity of the butter, on the other hand, should be cut by half at the very least otherwise the recipe is too greasy. Next time (because there will definitely be a next time), I will use half milk and half whipping cream, and I am sure with these alterations, my gratin will be perfect. Very tasty crowd pleaser indeed.

I made this recipe for a holiday brunch and it was awesome. Everyone was asking for the recipe. I did make a few minor changes to the recipe and cooking time. I sliced all of the potatoes with my mandolin. I layered the casserole with one layer of yukon and then one layer of sweet potato and then so on&. I substituted swiss cheese for the gruyere and added more herbs (I did use dried instead of fresh and herbs de provence instead of rosemary). I made the dish the night before and then let it sit out for about 45 minutes before I baked it. I did end up baking it for about 90 minutes; I kept it covered for an hour and then took the foil off. The only suggestion that I would have would be to lessen the amount of butter. It did seem a little greasy. I am going to make this again for Christmas.

I made this as a test to see if I wanted to make it for Christmas Eve. It is delicious, but very rich, so I'll only make it for special occasions. The liquid didn't absorb fully, so next time I'll use at least 2 cups of cheese, and cook for about 20 minutes longer. I ended up transferring it to a casserole dish and adding a bit of flour. It didn't look as pretty, but the consistency was much better, and taste wasn't compromised. I'll probably add about 1-2 tbsp of flour to the cream next time. Also next time I'll slice the sweet potatoes slightly thicker, as they were quite soft while the yukons were firm. I'll definitely make again.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a major hit. Followed the directions except I partially cooked it earlier in the day because oven times and temperatures. It turned out beautifully. Will definetly make this again

Made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was a big hit. Followed recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. I would double for next year as everyone wanted seconds!

This was fantastic. I made it for the first time for a dinner party this weekend. I followed the recipe exactly except I added some celery root and the grocery store was out of Italian parsley so I didn't put any in. It was a little time consuming to cut all the potatoes by hand. I made sure to make the slices pretty thin, which I think is necessary to make sure everything comes out soft. I cooked an extra 15 or 20 minutes longer than the recipe called for so that the liquid would be absorbed. Everyone at the dinner party loved it and asked for the recipe. Even my husband said a couple of times that it was really good and he rarely is effusive about food. I'm making it again for another party this weekend for sure.

When I saw this recipe in this months Bon Appetit I thought it would be a perfect side dish for Thanksgiviving. I am an experienced cook and I followed the recipe to a "T" and it was a mess. None of the creme was absorbed and the potatoes were still hard even after cooking an extra 20 minutes it still did not work. Don't know what went wrong but I would not try this time consuming recipe again.

I forgot to mention that we also replace the half 'n half with cream and condensed milk. This held the dish together well and lent the dish a lot of depth.

I made this along with an herbed beef tenderloin for a birthday dinner for a dear friend and it was a huge hit. I usually make the Scalloped potatoes with three cheeses from this site but found this to be a great variation. Everyone seemed to really like the combination of sweet potato and the Yukon gold. I did use half lowfat milk and half cream and it was fine-- -I did let it cook a little longer til all the liquid was absorbed. As many have said, this is not a low fat dish-----but it is a fabulous treat and I think we all need that once in a while!! A true winner and will definitely make again.

Gruyere is really expensive at the moment, we substituted grated Swiss Cheese and it turned out fabulous!

Using half and half is definitely a bad idea...it separated out for me as well. However, we did get a good idea of the taste and hate to say it, but everyone said they would have preferred mashed potatoes instead :-P It came out really nice looking if you alternate potato and yam slices. I just wish the herbs added more to it...

Absolutely delicious, even more so the next day, reheated. I followed advice and did 1/2 cream 1/2 milk and mine too was too watery. Next time I'd follow the recipe to a T, if anything I'd just add more gruyere.

My more delicate variation was a big hit at Thanksgiving: I substituted all yams for the Yukon Golds, sliced very thin on the mandoline; used only rosemary and thyme; and swapped in 1 cup chopped marcona almonds with rosemary instead of the cheese. The nuts go on midway through the baking when you remove the foil. I also steeped the herbs in the cream along with the garlic -- by mistake from bad recipe reading, but it came out great. It needed a bit more cream without the cheese.

I made this for Thanksgiving and somehow I messed it up. The flavor was excellent, but the half and half I subbed for cream separated out and it got watery. The cheese disappeared (and I used about 7 oz). It was still yummy, but not the cheesy creamy thing I was imagining. I think I might give it one more go with cream!

Outstanding gratin. A big hit at Thanksgiving dinner. Next time I will try 8 oz, Gruyere and 1 3/4 cups cream. Also might up the salt to 1 3/4 tsp. Definitely a new frequent flyer in our kitchen.

I made this delicious potato gratin for our annual pre-Thanksgiving dinner party and it was a big hit. Many guests went back for seconds and several friends asked for the recipe.

Great side dish. Made with the meatloaf (w. bacon and prunes) from this site. Go ahead a just substitute whole milk for the cream - it still was delicious and, frankly, allowed me to sleep at night not worrying about just how bad-for-you this could be.

I made this for a side at our monthly supper club. It was great.

An intriguing twist on classic scalloped potatoes but with every bite we felt our arteries clogging which diminished our enjoyment. The cheese and butter add more than enough oil - next time we'll try it with low fat, maybe fat free milk.

This was a wonderful gratin (I also like the blue cheese and mushroom one on this site as well). It was creamy and comforting, and I really liked the mix of potatoes. Very unique. My only complaint was that the prep was a little time consuming without a mandoline.

This dish was a so warm and delicious. I've added it to my comfort food list. I also substituted Gouda for the Gruyére because the Gouda was cheaper and had a similar flavor. Everyone raved about it, so I will definitely be serving at Thanksgiving!

Absolutely fantastic! I cooked this for 12 guests and everyone raved. Extremely rich, so watch the servings...

Highly recommended! I left the foil on the entire time and it still browned nicely. This will be perfect for Thanksgiving.

Delish! Half a recipe was enough for 4 somewhat generous servings. Will make again for sure!

fantastic. You could easily cut back on the cream ( sub half for milk,perhaps) and it would still be rich, herby, and delicious.

This is an excellent recipe. Guests loved it and asked for recipe. The gruyere adds wonderful flavor.

my sister made this for us - it is excellent. substituted gouda for the gruyere. awesome.

This was terrific. The only change I made was using shredded Parmesan cheese that I had on hand (my family doesn't like gruyere). I also halved it, as there were only three of us. It was absolutely delicious. I would use a different cheese next time, as there was a fair amount of "oil" in the final result. Also, the preparation was a little time consuming, even halving the recipe and using a mandolin to slice the potatoes. But it goes in my permanent repertoire nonetheless.

Fabulous,but I substituted milk for 1/2 of the cream, and it was still a bit too rich for my taste. Next time I will cut the butter in half too.

We made this to go with a beef tenderloin Saturday, and it was delicious. Make extra because it will be gone. We doubled the recipe with no problem. There's no way this recipe would feed 12 people as written.

Made this last night with pork tenderloin and it was incredible. It was a great way to use up the herbs in my garden. Highly recommend this one!

This was a delicious recipe, everyone gobbled it up and didn't leave a single morsel behind. I'm not a fan of Gruyere or Swiss so I used aged white cheddar. Definitely will be making again!

This was fabulously rich and satisfying. I made it with a turkey meatloaf which baked along side. This was a bit tedious to prepare. Use a sharp knife to get a consistent cut. I didn't use the Cuisinart because I didn't trust it to make the circles that I wanted. It was a nice challenge to cut the potatoes evenly. I was not true to the Scarborough Fair theme of parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme as I substitute chives which I had on hand. I liked the onion flavor. The fresh herbs stood out and made the taste superbly complex. The finished product was beautiful, browned, soft and crunchy.
