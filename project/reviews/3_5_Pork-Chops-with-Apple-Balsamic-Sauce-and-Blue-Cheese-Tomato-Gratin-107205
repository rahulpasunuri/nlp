This dish would stand up to any fine restaurant's offering. Used demi glacé,too, as veal stock was not available. Only had two chops but did the whole sauce recipe, so I would probably double the sauce for more chops.

This was fabulous, one of the best meals I've ever made, compared to a fine restaurant. I used the whole apple and was glad I did. I substituted 1/4 c. veal demiglace base for the veal stock since I couldn't find any, and as a result I did not have to spend as much time reducing. Rather than make the blue cheese gratin I used four 1 inch thick chops and cut a slit in them to stuff them each with 1 T blue cheese. I served the whole thing over sweet potato chunks roasted with olive oil, balsamic, salt & pepper. I also just roasted the chops in the same pan I seared them in, only using enough oil to coat the pan, and when they were done I just removed them & poured the sauce in the same pan, it only took a few more minutes after that so my chops were still warm. I only lightly salted the chops & my sauce tasted salty until I added the fruit, then it was perfect. Except for the large portions of meat it ended up pretty light and healthy this way, with the reduction of the oil.

I really liked the sauce, but it turned out really salty, probably from the reduction part. If I made it again, I definitely wouldn't season the chops with salt before searing them.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was a big hit. The Apple Balsamic Sauce was wonderful. I used craisins instead of golden raisins simply because I had them in the cupboard. The sauce would be excellent with chicken or even fish. We will definitely make this again.

A big hit with the guests this evening. I took the suggestion of the previous reviewer and substituted cranberries for the raisins - the flavors were complex and delicious. Served with roasted root vegetables (also Epicurious) this recipie made for a perfect late fall dinners.

The sauce for this pork dish is fantastic. I will not be making it again with pork chops because my husband HATES the bone/fat thing on chops but I will make it again with a pork tenderloin or even chicken breast. It smells wonderful while cooking and tastes great too. I did substitute dried cranberries for the golden raisins but that's just my preference.
