I should of added more cumin and garlic. I found this to be bland..even with 2 ham hocks. I used fresh hocks and I think smoked would be better. I really like black beans and love cumin..but this was a disappointment.

I agree with the comment below about the ham. But I managed to make a really good vegetarian version. Use only 1/3 of the onions and peppers in the initial cooking. When the beans are tender (and before they start to burst if possible), saute the remaining onion and pepper in a pan with a lot of garlic (I used 10 cloves) until soft. Add about 1 T of cumin. Add most of the water from the pan with the beans and 1 cup of cooked beans. Mash the mixture in the skillet and cook over high heat until its pretty thick. Then add that mixture back to the cooked beans. Add some fresh lime juice just before serving.

Thanks to the previous reviews, I made a few modifications since I like things a little spicier...Used 4 cups of chicken broth to replace 4 of the cups of water, doubled the chili powder and hot pepper flakes and left out the tomatoes as I bought the wrong kind. And added three cut up chipolte peppers. Pretty tasty and better the next day.

My whole family loved this one, everyone ranted and raved all meal. Even the three year old asked for seconds. The vinegar is a must.

Not a recipe you should use if you have to leave out the hamhock. Food allergies prevent me from using pork, and it is possible that the hamhock makes this meal, because this dish was bland and tasteless even after I added extra salt, pepper, tabasco, chili powder, and even cinnamon. Normally I don't review a recipe if I'd omitted a major ingredient, but quite a few folks need to omit pork from their cooking, so I think it benefits some cooks to know in advance whether it'll work. For this one, it doesn't.

I was pleasantly surpised at how delicious it was. I t was not what I expected which was Cuban or Brazilian style black beans and rice. Instead it was more like chili. It's not spicy hot, but it has a wonderful delicate flavor that would be a good base for more spice.

I loved this recipe -- it was very good and very hearty. Topped it with sour cream and it was great. It was the best black beans and rice that I've had.

These beans were really quite good. They were not as spicey as I had hoped. I also used hot Mexican chili powder rather then plain chili powder but they still seemed quite bland. I mixed some hot salsa in them and that helped. I would make them again since I felt they had wonderful flavor and would spice them up on an individual basis.

This recipe gets an A+ from Texas. My husband loved it and we had plenty left over for later.

This is one of those framework recipes that really adapts well to whatever you want and whatever you have on hand. I really liked it, served it for my more vegetarian guests and everyone is happy. I love this recipe with Buffalo brand jalapeno hot sauce.

I love this recipe and everytime I introduce it to more people, they love it, too. It's filling and good for you. I like to add a lot of tabasco.

Great flavor; it is a great complement to fish or pork. Leftovers freeze well.

I was disappointed because i was expecting them to be spicy. The overall flavor was bland, and I'm having trouble finishing the leftoevers. I suspect that doubling the red pepper flakes, and using lots of onions and garlic might improve this recipe immensely.

Thank you! Finally a black bean recipe my husband, a southern boy who married a yankee, likes! Easy and full of flavor.
