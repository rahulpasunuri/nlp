So delicious! I made these and froze them for a month for a party and they were still tender and flavorful. I used asiago cheese and it went well with the sage. It's a small amount but get the fresh sage for the distinct flavor.

People raved over these at Easter brunch. I'm only docking a fork because they're just really bad for you, what with the pork and cheese in the bread. I made these the night before and baked them in the morning.

These are amazing! I've made them 4 times now and they always receive rave reviews. My husband is always a picky eater begs me to make them for him on a regular basis. A definite keeper that will become a time-honored recipe.

As soon as I saw this recipe, I had to try it. It was so good, I served it for Thanksgiving, and it's become a Thanksgiving tradition. It's also easy enough to make at other times, including weeknight dinners.

Too heavy and solid. There are other ways I'd like to taste these flavors together, but these biscuits are out (followed recipe exactly). 6 out of 6 breakfast guests agreed.. they don't 'need' to have them again.

I had no idea biscuits were so simple to make! I used plain yogurt instead of buttermilk and cheddar instead of fontina, and the result was delicious (and perhaps marginally healthier on account of the yogurt)

I love this biscuit recipe. Its my boyfriends favorite and everyone I've made them for raves. I always just use ingrediants I have on hand but follow the basic recipe. Usually bacon, any cheese I have around tonight it was mozzerella and asiago, any fresh hardy herb-thyme tonight. And tonight I had no dairy to add as liquid so I used water. They still turned out great, although if I had my choice I'd always use milk, half & half, buttermilk-whatever I happen to have. I love these biscuits!

Brilliant! I made them 1" to serve with salad and cooked for about 9 minutes: thy were perfect, and I got 40 out of a double batch. I also froze them after I cooked them: thawed in fridge and baked at 350 for 5 minutes to warm through. A definite keeper!

I've now made these biscuits 3 times, and my dinner guests just rave about them.

These were a hit at Thanksgiving! I used a bit more sage than indicated with great results. Will definitely make again- simple, delicious recipe.

YUMMY! I used proscuitto instead of pancetta. It was really tasty.

Excellent. We left the sugar out and they were fantastic. I served them with a chicken roasted on the grill. We will make these again and again. Comfort food!

These are dangerous -- in a good way. I made these as part of a pretty elaborate dinner. We pretty much shoved everything else aside and gorged on these. Then we had them the next morning for breakfast. I added twice the sage than the recipe calls for... and we liked them that way. I will definitely keep this in my recipe box and make them again and again.

I didn't think anything could be done to take biscuits over the top...this recipe does it. Just the right amount of savory with a touch of sweet! These just melt in your mouth. I used dried sage and it worked great. I also used my food processor to make these just up to the point were the dough starts to come together. I'll be finding an excuse to make these again soon!

Homemade biscuits are always a treat. I'm not a fan of sage so I used fresh chives - very yummy.
