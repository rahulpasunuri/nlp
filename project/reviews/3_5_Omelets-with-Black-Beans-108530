This was a very interesting dish, both to make and to eat and it wasn't difficult at all. Instead of the sauce, I used Newman's Own Pineapple Salsa which I've found is very good with eggs. I used 2 cans of black beans and they would be better with some added flavoring, perhaps sauteed with onion and garlic or at least some salt and pepper. I needed more like 1/2 cup mashed beans per omelet. I also sprinkled grated cheddar cheese on the top of the finished omelet but I think it would be good to fold cheese in and melt it, too. Definitely use a nonstick omelet pan and you might add a little more butter to the pan before you cook the omelet bean side down.
