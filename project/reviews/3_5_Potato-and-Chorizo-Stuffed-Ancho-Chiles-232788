3 forks because this was a pain to make. Everyone loved it. I doubled the chorizo. They said it wasn't too spicy. Definitely good, just a lot of work I thought. Not sure if I would make it again only for the work part, flavor was great.

This is delicious, but not as easy to make. It's kind of a pain to handle the peppers. Other than that, it's straight forward.The skin flavor was too strong, but gave the potatos spiciness I loved.

Fabulous! Worth every second of time invested in toasting chile seeds and making sauce. I'd save my carb counting for another time, as the potatoe-chorizo-cheese combo tastes terrific.

Amazing! Not too labor intensive considering the results, and that it can be made ahead. Cooked the potatoes in the microwave, and toasted seeds in the same pan that the sauce cooked in to speed things up. Topped with cilantro and served with tortillas and poached eggs for a great brunch dish.

I can't believe these "I was busy, so I used tuna fish instead of ancho chiles" comments. If you're going to make seomthing, make it right. This was a lot of work, but turned out excellent. Definitely soak the chiles the previous day, and don't try to assemble at the last minute.

my guests at a dinner party really loved this dish. I was able to get fresh ancho chilies (dried were not available) and it was delicious that way. I didn't make the sauce because it was so labor intensive but well doctored chili sauce in a can (El Pato brand)worked great.

My family liked these stuffed peppers quite a bit. Soaking the peppers really takes on time at all. Throw them in water in the morning and they're ready when you get home from work. I used the Mexican style Chorizo and browned it because that's what was on hand. I was short on time so I cheated and skipped the sauce! I used a can of enchilada sauce instead. I think it needs a little moisture for baking but it's plenty flavorful without a sauce.

A little bit of a hassle but definitely worth doing. I used pepper jack/habanero jack and we loved it.

My husbands first words after tasting this were: "This is like eating at Topolobampo".{4 star Mexican restaurant in Chicago} Easy to make! Instead of potatoes I used Cauliflower. {low carb} Next time I make this I would not stir together the cauliflower charizo and cheese. I would layer the ingredients in each pepper so that they are equaly distributed. Perfect blend of flavours.Makes your mouth dance!

I have yet to make this recipe but it sounds interesting. To the cook from Portland, the recipe calls for Spanish Chorizo which is a cured sausage unlike the raw Mexican kind.

That filling sounds so good that I think it would go into almost anything. I think I'll fill some canneloni with it. Ridiculous to spend all that time reconstituting a dried pepper.

Way to much work and the results were dissappointing. A smilar recipe using fresh Poblano chilis with the meat and potatoe is very tasty and so much easier to prepare, and I am a Gringa.

Sounds good, I haven't made it yet. So it looks like the sausage goes into the chiles uncooked, is that right? We're not talking about pre-cooked chorizo here, are we?
