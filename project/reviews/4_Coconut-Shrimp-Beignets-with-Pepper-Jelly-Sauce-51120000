I made these tonight for a Halloween party-a big hit! I hardly ever make anything deep fried, but these were surprisingly easy to do. I did wind up using a total of 3/4 cup of water to get the batter to a thick pancake consistency, but the results were exceptional. I used the 26-30 ct per pound shrimp, and they worked out great-I did find that the first few batches of four were the best-the last ones i fried had a slightly "burnt" taste-not sure if it was the oil getting too hot or the cayenne in the batter, or maybe I just cooked them too long. Regardless, they were rich and decadent. The sauce was simple and complemented the beignets nicely.
