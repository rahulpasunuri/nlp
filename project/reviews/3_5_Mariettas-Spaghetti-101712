This is so good and very easy & I made it with just ok tomatoes from the store. Today I'm going to go to the farmers market for fresh Romas and basil. Will use it as a sauce for grilled salmon. Yummmm

This is delicious -- I have made this many times as printed in Learning to Cook. I've also found that this recipe works nicely if you substitute prepared pesto to drizzle on the tomatoes before roasting. I also add calamata olives and toasted pine nuts for a little more flavor.

This was absolutely delicious! Very easy too. I used primo tomatoes from the farmer's market, and topped with parmesean, and thought the dish was easily as good as what they serve at the Italian bistro down the street.

This is a simple pasta recipe yet it's big in taste. The roasted tomatoes with fresh herbs makes this a great summer dish.

I left my tomato skins on, and they peeled right of after I took them out of the oven

i added about half a tin of FINELY chopped anchovies to the garlic and parsley mixture before patting it on the tomatoes. this really gave them a wonderful smoky flavor. i also left the skin on the tomatoes- i just made sure i roasted them completely and it wasn't a problem. i sort of mashed them up while mixing them with the pasta which i think gave the pasta a more uniform coating of tomatoey goodness. i enjoyed this a lot; my boyfriend did think it was a bit dry, but when i told him to mash the tomatoes with his fork, he liked it a lot better.

this recipe is not bad actually! the roasting really brings out the flavour of the tomatoes... however, i would *definitely* peel the tomatoes first before roasting them, cuz if you don't you get pieces of tomato skin in your pasta, which personally i don't really enjoy...

I used fresh herbs and tomatoes from my garden and this was delicious! A wonderful way to use romas (I took other's advice and peeled them). It was even tasty the next day, as a cold pasta dish.

Wonderful, simple recipe. Must disagree with other reviewers. The beauty of the dish is in the simplicity and the pure flavors of the ingredients. Tomato sauce need not be complex to be good. Make sure you use flavorful tomatoes, though. If you want complexity of flavor, go eat a curry. P

I did not find this to be a special meal. I did not think it had enough flavor. If you do prepare it make sure you peal the tomatoes.

Boring and bland... there is nothing special or unique about this recipe. It lacks a complexity of flavor. Plus, the tomatoes didn't seem to taste quite right being roasted. I have another recipe that stews tomatoes for about an hour, which is far superior. If you really want to try this, you need to add more ingredients to add taste (ie. cyanne pepper and brown sugar). Good luck!

I thought this dish was excellent, but I changed/added a few things. I sauteed some mushrooms and used only the first four tablespoons of olive oil, which was plenty. The only thing I would do differently is to peel the tomatoes.

Absolutely spectacular, especially when you consider the work behind it. You just chop a little, drizzle a little, and roast a little, and everyone is happy. Every time we make this there's not a strand of pasta left for anyone to take home.
