I lived in Oaxaca for several years, and missed chileajo dearly when I left. I have tried several recipes, and this one is closest to what I was served on the corners of Oaxaca (though I was never given chileajo with cauliflower). I found it delicious, and can't imagine what happened to the previous reviewer's batch.

I remember living with an anorexic girl in college - every night she'd throw 1/2 a bag of green giant vegetable medley in the steamer and eat it plain for dinner. I always thought it looked so blah, so 50's, so TV dinner side dish. So you can imagine my dismay when I looked down 2.5 hours into making this dish and realized I had unwittingly just made that exact medley for GUESTS, no less. I have a feeling the women of Oaxaca get their medley from the freezer aisle as well, so if you want a truly authentic experience, you might start there. Flavor also not great - VERY spicy and way too heavy on the oregano. I would never make this again and would avoid all street vendors selling same - and this from a person that generally loves street food.
