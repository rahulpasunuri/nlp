Careful not to overcook the glaze. It will burn and solidify. Ten minutes or less will be more than enough.

Flavor was fantastic. Was just cooknig for myself and thought it would be enough for 2 dinners. Wrong. All gone. The glazing was easy in round 1 - but after sitting for 23+ minutes, indeed turned to toffee. Will try to find a way to keep it in the liquid state and let you know how it went.

Followed recipe as listed, had no problem with tar, but it was a bit sweet for me. Will make adjustments to kick up the heat in the future.

Everyone at the dinner table said it was the best salmon they'd ever had. I added a minced jalapeno to the glaze for a little more kick, and I'd do that again. Wonderful!

this recipe is awesome. my friends were licking their fingers after eating the salmon. we had one extra piece that never got cooked on the first night. so i left it marinating and grilled it the next day. this was definitely the better piece of salmon, so i recommend letting the fish marinate in the sauce at least over night

The first time I made this recipe the glaze was like toffee, but the flavors were so good I decided to try again. I only cooked it for about 7-10 minutes and had better results. This is now a family favorite!

This was great. I made it without the pepper because of little ones, and it was a success. Grilled it per the instructions of another reviewer and that worked really well. My one year old was eating handfuls of the salmon!

This was great sauce but it burned completely - broiler + sugar for me usually = burnt. what's the secret?

This was an outstanding recipe. The flavors really worked together, and it did not last long after I served it.

This is really an excellent recipe. This sauce is fantastic and is wonderful with the salmon, but it's equally delicious on baked tofu. The recipe makes a ton of sauce and I might cut the recipe in half next time. I think the sugar in this recipe could be reduced a bit and still taste good. Will reduce by two tablespoons next time.

Excellent recipe for Salmon. I have made it twice and am going to make it again tomorrow. Yes the baste can be thick but that's OK, the flavor is wonderful.

Tasted very nice - but did anyone else find they were trying to baste toffee onto the salmon?!

I made this tonight on a gas grill and it was terrific. I followed the directions through "Broil them . . " when I put the fillets on the grill. I suggest cooking skin side up on a hot grill sprayed with non-stick spray (carefully, since the spray is flammable) for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn carefully to skin side down and cook for an additional 4 minutes. The flesh part of the fillet will slide easily onto a spatula, leaving the skin behind (which can very easily be removed once the grill cools).

I have made this 3 times already and am about to make it again tonight. Wonderful flavor!

This was fantastic! It was sweet, so only make this dish if you life sweet asias sauces like teriyaki. Serve right after you are done cooking. Make this dish for sure! Possibly pair with uncomplicated vegetables. Too many flavours would complicate the palate.
