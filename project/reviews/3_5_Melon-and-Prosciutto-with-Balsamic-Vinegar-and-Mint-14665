I really enjoyed the flavor combination as did both adults and children at my party. The mint is perfect with the balsamic vinegar!!

Flavor profile is just great! I actually made this into a cold soup. I used white balsamic and added just a small amt of break like with gazpacho. Really delicious!

I did use a high-quality balsamic vinegar, but I didn't much care for this dish. The vinegar was still too overpowering. I liked it much better when I left the vinegar mixture out and simply ate the proscuitto with the melon. Yum!

If you think the bv is too pungent, then you are not using top quality balsamic vinegar which gets sweeter and more refined with age. This recipe is absolutely fantastic and my foodie pessimist boyfriend begs me to make it every time I come back from the cheese shop with authentic prosciutto di parma. Serrano ham works great. Bring the meat up to room temp before serving to bring out the smoked flavors with pecorino toscano and sparkling reserva wine.

I would use this mint/balsamic/sugar marinade again for something like SALMON, or with strawberry halves. We found it to be too dominant to use with a fine prosciutto ($22/lb) and melon; the flavors competed and cancelled each other. -Wasn't bad, but it was wasted. Also, since I tore the mint leaves into tiny pieces, I wouldn't bother straining next time. Delicious as a marinade!

I was a bit leary of the mint, as I'm not a big fan, but it was really a nice addition to this standard dish. Very summery & light.

I was a little hesitant of this combination of flavors - but no more. I was surprised how well everything went together. And every dinner guest, some of whom have been picky abut appetizers I served in the past, cleaned their plates. This one definitely goes in my book as elegant and easy.

A wonderful,light, delicious starter. We have always served cantaloupe and prosciutto, but the addition of the dressing really brings out their flavours. It's even simplier to make than it is yummy!
