I live in Europe now, so peanut oil is incredibly expensive (I used olive) and fresh poblanos are non-existent. Fortunately, I leave near a mexican specialty shop, so I can get canned. Add them with the grapes, since they just need to be warmed through. I also double the grapes -- I found the first time I made it that I was hunting through the dish for those lovely sweet morsels. My husband LOVES this dish, it's light (provided you really drain the oil from the pork and the pan), simple and delicious.

We were really disappointed in this one. Odd, as we like almost any stir-fry, but this one had an odd flavor and the pork seemed undercooked (it wasn't, based on temp, but just didn't get brown and crispy). Had some extra pork tenderloin looking for a recipe, but wish I had used an old standby instead.

This is delicious and easy to make. I like to substitute chicken for the pork.

Excellent intro to using Ancho/Poblano for flavor and adjustable heat.

I love this. I mix the whole thing with pasta - usually fettucine. It's a delicious combination.

An easy, pretty and tasty meal. I didn't have peanut oil so I just used olive oil. It was good, but I'll bet it's even better with the peanut. I will definitely make this again. Guests loved it.

This is a delicious way to use pork tenderloin. For an extra taste shot, substitute a dried chipotle for rgw poblano. Adds that wonderful smoky flavour. Easy popular meal at mu house

Except for the "matchstick" cutting, a fairly easy and quick dish to make. More peppery than I expected, but I liked it!

Nothing spectacular -- not sure I'd serve it to company. But, quick and easy and healthy. Will definitely make again for a family meal.

Didn't have any grapes but worked just as well.

This dish was really easy to make, healthy, colorful, and delicious. I added about 2 T. extra oyster sauce, just because I like it a lot! My boyfriend said he would like to see shitake's in it, but I think it's perfect as-is.
