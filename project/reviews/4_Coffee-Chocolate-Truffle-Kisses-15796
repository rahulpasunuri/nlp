I followed the advice of others and make this in a rectangle loaf pan and they came out very well. The flavor was too coffee-intense for my husband but I personally like it. Of all the truffles that I made for Christmas this year, these were the easiest. I will say that patience pays off when making truffles. Letting them sit for a couple days before serving them made a difference for me.

These are great, I'll try the cellophane pan trick to save time, one of my favorite truffle recipes

These were excellent. I used them as a filling for molded chocolates.

SO good. Definitely don't bother with the pastry bag, and if you don't have a food processor don't worry. This worked great just chopping with a knife and mixing softened butter into the pieces. ALSO-- I coated these with plain semi-sweet chocolate and the difference in texture was great--it also sweetened them up a bit. Just melt semi-sweet chocolate in a double boiler, remove from heat and let it cool some (if it's too hot it will not stick to the chilled truffles) roll the trufles in the chocolate with your hand and then coat in nuts or just leave plain (this gets messy but it's fun :) Chill until the coating hardens and pair them with a good cup of coffee.

I agree with rox of SFO, the pastry bag is more trouble than it's worth. After trying that with half the batch, I moved to the cellophane lined pan and cut everything into squares, then dusted with cocoa. Ultimately I wanted a bit more sweetness, so I sprinkled some powdered sugar on some as well as cocoa.

Hint: Don't bother with the piping part at all. Pour the ganache into a celophane-lined bread pan and chill it. Then cut it into small squares and dip the squares in cocoa. so much easier and they look rustic yet elegant... oh and they taste delicious!

Very rich, very creamy...I'll be making these again. Looks a little runny, but they turn out good.

I made these kisses for a party last Christmas and got a stellar response! They are a little difficult to make, but once it reaches the proper temperature, piping them into kisses is much easier. I used Pernogotti cocoa that I purchased at Williams-Sonoma, along with Callebaut chocolate. Investing in the best ingredients really makes a difference!!
