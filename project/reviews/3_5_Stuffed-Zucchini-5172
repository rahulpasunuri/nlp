Whole family enjoyed this recipe. I used what I had on hand - 10 oz. lean ground turkey instead of veal,provolone instead of parm, and only used 1/2 T. butter. GREAT!

Rating: 3
Really much better than 3 forks, a tasty dinner that can vary depending on what ingredients are on hand. Even though I discarded the seeds in the zucchini, 1/4 c.bread crumbs seemed to be necessary in order to soak up some of the moisture in the mixture. A good summer alternative to grilling...

Great starter recipe where you can add whatever you have leftover in fridge. I used ground beef (family won't eat veal) and added leftover cooked brown rice, last of a jar of good quality pesto in place of basil, diced tomato and proscuitto which in my opinion elevated this to 4 forks. Will try and freeze leftovers and let you know how it comes out!

This also works well with a large yellow squash. I also used Italian sausage,the hot variety and some sundried tomatoes, chopped, and half the salt. Quite a nice recipe!

My Italian husband and 2 teenage sons inhaled this! I subbed ground turkey for the veal and was in a hurry so I raised the heat to 425 for 20 minutes for one son, microwaved for 5 minutes and then broiled for the last 3 or 4 minutes for the other son, topped with seasoned bread crumbs. I used huge zucchini's so I used 2 eggs. Amazing!!

I'm not giving this a fork rating since I made changes, but wanted to say this is a great base recipe for improvising with what you have. I used a huge zucchini from the garden, and made the stuffing with lamb (only 1/3 lb.) instead of veal, peppers instead of mushrooms, and added some leftover rice to make up for the scant meat. For a single large zucchini cooking time of an hour or 1:15 would be ideal, but we were hungry so I took it out after only 50 minutes.

Rating: 3
I would rate it 4forks, but didn't follow it exactly, so feel that's not quite fair... It is 4fork worthy in my book, however, based on its versatility. Here's what I did with what I had on hand: 4 Aidell's andouille chicken sausages (costco) subbed for the veal; 2 mozzarella stix finely chopped in addition to the parm; 1 whole vidalia onion - no mushrooms or celery; about 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper sauteed with the onion; 1/2 cup or so of panko bread crumbs; no wine; added leftover fresh corn cut off the cob. I also salted the zucchini while prepping and rinsed it before stuffing. It was fabulous! Great way to use up a humongo zucchini from the garden! Without a doubt, we'll be making this again this summer!

Oh, my goodness, this is delicious, but I am glad I read the reviews before making it, because 1 t. of salt is plenty. I lightly browned the mushrooms and onions and used only the seedless pulp from the zucchini, so the moistness was perfect. I reduced the veal to 12 oz. but used the full amounts of garlic, basil, and rosemary. Having non-gluten requirements iin our family, I am very pleased to add this recipe to my collection.

Made this with one big zucchini (which I salted for 15 minutes and rinsed) and ground beef. Used 1 teas salt and 1/4 t. pepper. Also put crushed tomatoes with a bit of seasoning in the pan. Omitted butter. It was very good, although a fair amount of work. But the recipe is a keeper - if for nothing more than to have something to do with a huge zucchini that gets away from us in the garden.

Rating: 3
This was really good, but I did change it a bit. I left out the veal, almost doubled the mushrooms and cheese, used 4 tablespoons of wine, and added some panko to the mix. I almost left the butter out, but decided to splurge. The butter gives it a very rich flavor. My only concern is that my stuffing was a little too moist on the inside, my guess is from all of the water that comes with onions and mushrooms. Any ideas on how to make a stuffing that is not too moist?

Rating: 4
Outstanding flavor. I used globe zucchini and presentation looked great. To reduce the liquid I combined the mushrooms, celery, and 'zucchini insides' together in a bowl and let sit for 15 minutes to release the liquid, then dumped it out before cooking. Also, I cooked the veggies and meat in separate batches and combined them in the end with the cheese, egg, and butter.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe for those extra-large zucchinis that get away from us in our garden. I've made two slight modifications: instead of several smaller zucchini, I use one huge one; and I've never used veal. I've made it with ground lamb, ground turkey, and lean grass-fed hamburger. ALL are delicious! This will be in our dinner rotation for a long time!

I made my own adaptions to make it completely vegetarian. I also added some breadcrumbs to make it a little more solid. The reason why I liked this recipe so much is because you can easily adapt it to your own personal tastes. I do agree that the pepper the recipe calls for is a tad too much, at least for my liking, but overall it was great and I would make it again.

This was Yummy! We have a ton of zucchini growing in our garden. I substituted spicy italian sausage for the veal and omitted the butter. My husband is not a huge fan of zucchini but loves this!

I make a vegetarian version of this that's fantastic. Just use more of every veggie, especially mushrooms, and whatever others you have in the fridge. Today it's red and green bell peppers and spinach. I've tried a vegan version, but ir really needed the egg and cheese.

The perfect recipe to use up the gigantic zucchini my garden has put forth this year! This is a great recipe--and will be a staple throughout the year. I have used ground turkey the few times I've made it (in just the last month!) and it's perfect.

Made this for Easter with only slight changes - used ground lamb, doubled the whole recipe, and added 8 oz tomato sauce. Browned the meat first so I could sautee in the drippings instead of in oil. Reduced butter by half, and next time I will leave out entirely. It wasn't greasy tasting, but I could tell most the fat bubbled out during baking into the pan anyway, so I think it's unncessary. This was loved by my family, looked lovely and spring-y on the plate. Served as the main dish in large zuchs with a side of orzo salad. Great make ahead!

I used mild italian sausage instead of veal like others and a HUGE zucchini. There was a lot of water and I was unsure how long to reduce the mixture so I sauteed for a bit longer until I had what I thought was a good moisture ratio. That said, it came out delicious despite adding the garlic and onion later when I realized that it was missing from the initial instructions. For larger zucchinis, I would cook 5-10 minutes longer.

Rating: 4
I made this recipe last night. It was wonderful. I cut the salt and pepper in half and it still had plenty of flavor. We love spicy food, but 2 tsp of pepper would have been too much. It might be a good idea to sprinkle some of the salt on the cored zucchini halves before stuffing them. Also, browned the veal separately.

Rating: 4
Following the advice of earlier cooks, I browned the ground meat (beef) in a seperate pan with 1/2 the salt and pepper. I finally used my Pampered Chef chopper to mince all the veggies adding 1/4 c. carrot to the mix. I used red wine and changed the spices to 1 t. dried basil and 1/2 t. of tarragon. I overstuffed the zucchini and then crammed them all into a 9" ceramic baker. A hit with the whole family.

Rating: 4
A great recipe - except for the 4 zucchini - how about 10?? With the left over mixture, I cut a long neck organic squash in half and hollowed out enough to mound the stuffing. The squash was slightly better than the zucchini and the leftovers were even better the next day.

Rating: 4
I make this recipe (or something similar) pretty frequently. I like it because it is easy to reduce the fat and still get a good dish, and just as easy to make the "full fat" version when spending calories. Like other reviewers, I use italian sausage, but only one link for the leaner version -- enough to give flavor -- then bump up the mushrooms for volume. Also use less cheese and substitute olive oil for all but a teaspoon or so of butter. Still tastes great and makes an almost meatless main dish. I use whatever is in the fridge at different times -- finely diced carrot, red bell pepper, etc. I put white wine in the bottom of the pan to bake. Others mentioned moisture -- I fry off the sausage first and then add a little dot of butter and oil to saute off the veggies in the same pan. Wish I had some of your homegrown squashes!

This is quite good and I would make it again but I would make a couple of changes. I also used Italian sausage instead of veal and it was delicious. I would brown the meat separately and add it to the vegetables because it took a long time to brown in all the watery vegetables and by that time the vegetables were cooked to mush. Also, read the recipe carefully...I'm sure others have noticed that the recipe never tells you what to do with the onion and garlic and by the time I realized that, I had to add them late! All in all, however, this is worth a second try.

Loved it.... with a couple of changes. Substituted andouille sausage for the veal. Substituted crushed tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil for the water in which it all cooked. And finally - did the final cooking indirect on the grill instead of in the oven. Yum.

I loved this dish.I made a few changes to spice it up a little and make a meal out of it. I used sausage that I cooked before adding to the other ingrediants well drained of all fat. I also added just a little wild rice blend that really helped soak up any liquid that would make it too watery and gave it a great texture. I used chicken broth to cook the squash in. I also used quite large squash that had grown very fast in the garden. Not many seeds. It was the best way I have found to cook squash other that on the grill. A keeper!!!!!!!!!!

I made this recipe using ground turkey and no other changes. It was so good. I can't believe we loved a stuffed zucchini recipe and are raving about it!! I served it with baked garden fresh tomatoes topped with a mixture of panko, garlic, parsley, basil and olive oil. Delicious! Can't wait for more zucchini from the garden to make it again. I also froze some after cooking.

I liked this recipe, but felt the veal was a little bland. Next time I think I would follow the other reviewers and use sausage instead, and I would consider throwing in some breadcrumbs to dry out the filling a little. But it's an interesting twist on a basic staple.

I used a GIANT (2"in diameter, 11" in length, at least)zucchini. I blind baked the zucchini for 15 minutes at 375F, then added the meat filling and baked for 15 minutes more. Then I took it to the pre-heated grill and let it grill for 10 to 15 minutes on foil over indirect and a little direct heat. My husband and I loved it! The grilled flavor was a nice change and I still used the pan juice since it started in the oven.

This was great! I used lean ground beef instead of veal. Also, make sure to really cook the veggies down before adding the meat to eliminate as much water as possible. Instead of using water in the pan, I put a mixture of 3 chopped tomatoes, about 4 T. chopped basil, 3 T. chopped onion, salt and pepper (no water). I put the stuffed zucchini atop and then cooked for 30-40 minutes. It was perfect- made a beautifully chunky tomato sauce, rich in flavor. This was soooooo easy! I can't wait to make it for my next dinner party!

Yes, sliced cherry tomatoes in the pan add color and nice acidity, don't need the meat, use more mushrooms as suggested (better roughly chopped for texture), and next time I'll leave out the salt altogether! We couldn't taste the wonderful subtle flavor of the zucchini. And the cheese adds enough salt already! Great dish though. Guests wanted the recipe.

This is the 4th time I've made this recipie in a month. I bring it to every party and it gets rave reviews.

My modifications: I steamed the zucchini halves in a bit of water in the microwave for about 5 minutes before scraping out the insides, and I also used a grapefruit spoon, which made the job quick and easy. I sauteed the other veggies first while the zucchini "meat" drained in a colander. I omitted any meat at all, since I was taking this to our supper club and my assignment was a vegetable. I used the seasonings and other ingredients as called for, and completed the dish as directed. The dish was met with rave reviews from all present.

My husband and I loved this recipe, and I didn't even use the sausage (had to improvise, used a combo of steel cut oatmeal, tabasco and liquid smoke). Unlike some of the other reviewers, I had no problems with wateriness. I think having enough oil in the pan so the stuff sautes instead of boils helps with this. I'm sure the size of your zucchini impacts the water content as well, I used small ones. Other mods: Add a can of diced tomatoes to bottom of pan instead of water, the tomatoes complement the dish well. Definitely reduce salt, we used less than a tsp. I increased the parmesan cheese to 1 c. parm and skipped the butter.

I made this recipe with italian chicken/turkey sausage instead of veal. Although delicious, this is a very heavy and filling recipe -definitely not hot weather food! A vegan version (instead of eggs and butter I added a small amount of bread crumbs, extra olive oil and basil, some chopped tomato, and seasoned with lemon juice) was lighter summer fare.

I also chopped the insides of the zucchini pretty small so that the stuffing would not be chunky. I highly recommend this dish and will make it many times over!

I agree this is a terrific recipe. I've made several stuffed zucchini recipes in my time, and this is definitely the best. I substituted ground turkey for the veal, thyme for the rosemary and pre-cooked the zucchini in the microwave just a little bit before stuffing it.

We have made this dish about 5 times now. We sub ground pork for the veal and never measure the mushrooms or celery...the more veggies the better. One thing we have done is add a bit more wine, which doesn't reduce all the way and creates a "sauce". We reserve the "sauce" and baste the zuc's with it before serving.
