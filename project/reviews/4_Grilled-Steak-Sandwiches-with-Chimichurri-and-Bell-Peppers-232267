This was fantastic! Had it with both baguette and ciabatta and preferred the baguette. Used the leftover chimichurri on a pork roast the next day and it was delicious as well.

Outstanding sandwiches, I served with a fresh corn and avocado salad. Can't wait to have again!

This sandwich is amazing - so flavourful and filling. Only thing I added to the sandwich was some grilled Vidalia onions, which I think really worked with this recipe. I served it with a simple salad and grilled potatoes. I will definitely make this recipe again.

I have made this several times and it is universally appreciated. You must not substitute another type of steak, as you must have a very tender cut. I have always used ciabatta bread for the sandwiches with great results. IME, it is important NOT to brush oil on the steaks. The time I did, I had major flare-ups and charrred meat. The potatoes are quite delicious as well.

I made the chimichurri in a blender, which was not a good idea...had to add extra liquid to get it to emulsify. Still very delicious, but recommend using food processor as recipe states.

Very good. Its also very simple to make. The chimichurri sauce is what makes this dish. I made a couple of small changes. I had fresh thyme & garlic chives so i added a little bit of both to the sauce. When i was grilling the steak i also grilled thick sliced onions and put them on top of the sandwich. I used some thin cut tbone steaks that were perfect for this recipe and cut the meat off the bone after grilling. Some changes i might make in the future would be to add a chipotle and maybe a little cumin to the sauce. Hey its not traditional but either is cilantro. Just cause its not traditional though does not mean its not good.

This is a huge hit at our summer parties. Only tip is to double the amount of sauce; it always goes!

Made this just as recipe instructs and it is delicious. The Chimichurri sauce is exceptional and the roasted peppers compliment the meat nicely. You must try it.

Not the chimichurri that my Argentine mother taught me but it is very good in any case

Awesome! Fast and easy! I grilled the peppers in a BBQ wok at the same time as the meat. While cutting the meat my husband toasted the bread. Great meal for a group too! We used small ciabatta buns. We'll make this one a lot! Also, you can buy bottled chimichurri sauce for really quick meals. ENJOY!!

I loved this recipe. I had a green pepper so I add it to the red and the yellow ones, very colorful and just great!
