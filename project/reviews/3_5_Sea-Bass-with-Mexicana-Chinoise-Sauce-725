Made this with halibut as ch. sea bass was not available. Light and tasty, this recipe let the taste of the fish come through. Made it exactly as written, but used a very large poblano pepper.

Baby, can you say "TITILLATING" the Sea Bass just melts in your mouth. Served with asian brown rice and grilll asparagus.... Only suggestion is to use a gluten free, low sodium soy sauce... Did I say "TITILLAING"

The recipe was easy, but my husband and I agreed that it was too soy-saucy. Maybe it was because I used naturally brewed Tamari Sauce instead of the regular Soy Sauce. Next time I would cut back just a little on the soy sauce and just a little on the black bean garlic sauce. And serve this with rice to saok up some of the sauce.

Yes, healthy and very tasty. I used shallot instead of scallion, and doubled the sauce to sop up with bread. I used salmon instead of sea bass. Don't pass this recipe by.

This is an easy-to-fix, quick, delicious recipe. We used Chilean sea bass and the results were fantastic. We could not believe how highly flavorful yet healthy this recipe is. A wonderful addition for a healthy lifestyle.

Excellent! I served this to company and we all loved it. A great blend of flavors. I served it with a Coucous & Black Bean Salad recipe from Cooking Light which was a good combination/menu. I used Chilean Sea Bass, that's all they had at the market and it happens to be my favorite.

While my guests said they really liked the dish, I was a little bit disappointed after all the great reviews I had read. It tasted a little too sweet to me, so if I made it again I would adjust the measurements a bit.

This dish is the perfect combination of Mexican and Asian cuisine. All of the chopping, dicing and prep work is well worth it. I used a few more peppers, because my husband and I like it spicy!

This is a great recipe. We love it! Serve with jasmine rice, sushi appetizer and Asian cole slaw or green salad. You can also substitute monkfish for the sea bass. We usually enjoy this with a crisp Sauvignon Blanc. DO NOT overcook the fish, whatever you do.
