Too much salt! And I did not want to purchase 6 ducks. Ducks were on sale at SPROUTS market, so I bought two. Took my time with a glass of wine to completely butcher the birds down. All bones and wings were browned in the oven then made into duck stock. All the excess fat was rendered slowly in the oven to produce some delicious cracklings and enough fat to make the 4 confit duck legs. While they were marinating overnight, I made roasted duck breast with port wine and cherry sauce for dinner. VERY SATISFYING!!

a GREAT place to buy the duck fat is "Central Market" (I live in Dallas, they are all over Texas) $4 per pound! I got that yesterday, awesome deal...

I should say from the start that I have not tried this recipe yet, but I wanted to addresses some of the issues that other reviewers have brought up. If you want to buy duck legs/fat here is the best place to get it: www.perkinparadise.com. This is a duck farm in Pennsylvania. You can by a gallon of duck fat for $26. You are not going to find a better deal on the planet. I live in Boston and I received it in 2 days ($16 shipping). Yes, thats a lot of fat. I am confiting 19lbs of duck legs (about 35 legs). You have to remember that this is a preservation process. It will last up to 6 months in the fridge. I suggest you make a party out of the process. Get some friends to pitch in, and be sure to have them bring over lots of wine (to drink) and make confit together. Then you divide it when its done. Its also a very good gift. I give out confit every year. If you do one big batch in the fall, you can have it all winter to make soups, salads, cassolettes, etc. This is my second 19 lb batch this year. I gave the entire first batch away because people like it so much.

Use half the amount of salt, and (optionally) you can rinse the legs after marinating them. Also, for those of you who can find the duck legs but not the fat, I find that near the packaged sausage refrigerated section of the market you can by Morrell snow cap lard, which melts quickly and does not adversely alter the flavor of the duck. I actually added a little salt-pork to my fryer to add some subtle flavor back to the lard.

The amount of salt required in this recipe is obviously in error. Way too salty. I made this recipe again, after consulting with the recipe I had used for years, with about half the amount of salt (approx. 1.8 Tbsp) and it was perfect. This is now my "go to" recipe for duck confit

made it for the first time. but tasted too salty. I followed the directions and didn't add any additional salt. I used a whole duck that weighed 5 lbs. and cut it up as suggested. should I have rinsed the marinate instead of wiping pieces?

To porkslap: You can avoid having to buy extra duck fat by starting with whole ducks. Trim, chop and render all of the extra fat on the birds. The extra time it takes is totally worth it - and you get wings and breasts in the deal! With two ducklings, you can make enough confit and magret for dinner for 6, plus crispy wings and stock from the other bits.

Every time I see a confit recipe I get excited,,, until I get to the part saying five 7oz containers of duck fat. I don't know about where you live but here in New York that costs between $25 and $30, for the fat only. To me that's a bit steep for 6 duck legs. Plus I doubt it's enough to actually cover 6 big legs. Now I know that theoretically you can reuse this fat but who actually has room in the fridge to save something you'll use once or twice more, maybe.

I have been making duck confit for a long time now. I use a recipe from Rob Feenie's cookbook for the marinade which adds an exotic touch. Most receipes instruct you to cook the confit legs upside down in a pan to crisp them. This does not work at all for me since the skin always sticks to the pan. I saute the legs skin side up for a few minutes in a pan and then just finish them in a 375 oven skin side up; perfect everytime. Also try the Farro ristto with confit sauce recipe from this site. Out of this world. Heike Montreal, Canada

I can't wait to try this! For the other Chicagoan, try Paulina Meat Market. If they don't have it, they'll point you in the right direction.

This is something I would just love to try. Living in the Chicago area I need to find out where I can buy duck fat and 5# of duck legs. Any suggestions?
