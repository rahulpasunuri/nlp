Simple yet sophisticated flavors. I used both roe and smoked salmon.

I wont give any forks for this recipe because I didn't make it as written. I substituted the roe for smoked salmon and it was WONDERFUL! I made no other changes and added the salmon to taste (translation: a little for the pot, a little for the cook, a little for the pot, a little more for the cook...) Who has time for measurements! lol

A straight forward recipie with stunning results. They look fantastic, add a lot of colour to a platter and taste wonderful. Cream Cheese is not readily available here so I substituted Fresh Chevre - light, crunchy and wonderful.
