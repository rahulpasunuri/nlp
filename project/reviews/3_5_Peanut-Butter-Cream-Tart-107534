I made this as one of the desserts for Christmas dinner and EVERYONE loved it! I will remember next time not to set it out before dinner (to show off) because it got a little too soft. Easy to make!

This is a dessert I have made numerous times and it is always a winner. Last week I made three for a Christmas dinner and it was the star of the evening. The only thing I add is a little raspberry sauce to dress the plate.

I was excited about making this recipe because it looked so delicious. Alas, I was disappointed. It was easy enough to make, as many other reviewers have said, but I thought it was pretty average-tasting & not all that special.

this is not a review just a plea to epicurious. i don't know if anyone else is having this problem but when i print a recipe i print the version with the reviews, i find them incredibly helpful but for some reason i can't anymore and am stuck with having to print up the printer ready version. is anyone else having this problem? not sure if it's my computer or the new advertisement on this web-site?

Thi panut butter filling in this tart was not near as good as the one in the peanut butter tart with caramel glaze also published on this website.

I made this tart for a pool party yesterday. It's a very easy recipe and very delicious. Everybody loved it! This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I am not one to skimp on sugar or butter in a dessert but was making this for people who will not eat full fat desserts and came up with wonderful results by reducing a few ingredients. Reduce butter to 3T in crust (I also add a pinch of salt), cream cheese to 5oz, peanut butter to 1/2 cup and sugar to 1/3 cup. I've made this before following the exact recipe and the lower fat version is even better than the original.

Yes!!!I have found the perfect Peanut Butter Tart. This recipe is as simple to make as it is delicious! I have made it three times and it has been a hit every time!!!

I made this for Thanksgiving, and my relatives thought that I was a culinary prodigy. It was delicious, and so easy to make! I didn't have a tart pan (although after making this, my mom decided I needed one), so I used a springform pan, which worked just fine. I made the cut out chocolate stars from another cake in this Bon Appetit, and I stuck them to the sides of the cake and put them on top. Everyone was very impressed with this simple, fun detail. In the future, I might alter this recipe to become a specialty dessert for the restaurant where I work. Marvelous!

This tart was very good. Easy to make too.

I've made this a number of times and have cut out the sugar all-together. I don't like sweet things. But, the cookie crust is sweet enough that the filling doesn't seem to need the extra sugar. If skeptical after tasting the filling...it is much better with the crust.

I made this for a dinner party. Both adults and children loved it. It was incredibly easy to make.

I thought this was great. So did my husband. Two not very big people ate the whole pie in two days. I cheated and used a store bought Oreo crust. The dessert took about 20 minutes from start to finish.

I almost did not take this to a potluck I was attending because I had tasted the filling and didn't think it was very good...However, it was eaten quickly and several people had seconds. Was a very pretty dessert, I may make again just due to the good response and ease.

I've made this pie twice to rave reviews. Even my sister-in-law who "doesn't like cream cheese" thought it was good. Super easy, too, especially using a store-bought chocolate crust. I also used light cream cheese and it turned out fine. Definitely will make again and again!

This was a hit with all the adults who tried it. The best part about this recipe is that it is so simple and fast - I made it in under half an hour! Will definitely make it again.

Very good flavor especially if you like peanut butter. I cheated and used Orea cookie crumbs from the store and everyone liked the crust a lot.

Very easy to make, and looks pretty too. Got rave reviews at Christmas Eve dinner!

Extremely easy to make. I was worried about it being bland so I added a little more peanut butter. I served it, along with other desserts, at a Christmas eve buffet and it was the most popular dessert. Not a single peson (of 30) said it was only so-so. I would definitely make this one again!

grandkids liked it, but adults voted "just so-so"; not crazy about either the crust OR the filling.
