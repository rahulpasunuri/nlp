I didn't look at these tips before I made mine, but I was happy with how it turned out. I used pistachios instead of walnuts because I find walnuts to be bitter when cooked. It's a nice substitute. I also processed mine so there was a bit of powder with the chunky nuts, which added some flavor with the texture.

After reading the reviews of this recipe and working in some of the modifications, I found this cake to be delightful. It was light, flavorful, and almost everyone who tried it asked for the recipe. Here's what I suggest: Lessen sugar to a scant 1 cup; lessen cinnamon to 2.5t; add 3/4t ginger powder; cut evoo to .5c and add .25c butter; cream sugar and butter, first, then add evoo and eggs; grate fresh ginger in with the carrots (maybe 1T). Bake times: 40 minutes for a bundt pan and 50 minutes for a loaf pan. Everyone enjoys this cake - young and old alike. It's now my go-to easy cake. Enjoy!!

Changes: 2.5 tsp cinnamon, 2 cups carrots, 1 cup walnuts, more lemon zest and used lemon oil. Didn't rise very high, but looked okay in a tube pan. Was done 10 minutes early! Could taste the olive oil, but only when eaten without icing. Will use canola oil next time and will make a double batch of icing... which is amazing!

This cake was too light in texture and the cinamon was overpowering. I used 1 cup of nuts and could have added even more as that flavor was barely detectable. 3/4 cup of suggar was more than sufficient. I am glad I took the tip and checked for doneness at 45 min.

Have been making this delicious carrot cake since the recipe came out 11 years ago! Its always a hit! The only complaint I have is that I can never seem to get the icing to "pouring" consistency.

Considering how easy this cake is to make it is the best Carrot Cake I have ever made. This is wonderful.

This has to be the most boring carrot cake recipe ever written. A look at the ingredients should have been a clue that it was plain. Much better recipes for carrot cake on this site, use them!

This is the best Carrot Cake I have ever had. It does not raise very high, but the texture and flavor are the best. Tghe Lemon Cream Cheese Icing was perfect. My guests raved and it was gone that evening.

I loved this cake. Both my husband and I are now diabetic, so cake is seldom on our menu. But I was looking for a bundt cake I could take to a family gathering. I have several carrot cake recipes already, but I liked what I saw in this ingredients list. I pretty much followed the recipe as written, making sure I put in enough carrots, and I did use the light olive oil. If you don't know it's there, you won't detect it.

I made this cake maybe a dozen times. Looks great and everbody loves it. The olive oil tastes and smells very good in it. It's one those cakes, one has the ingridients at home at all times so it's easy to just do it. Works every time. I gave this recipe to many people so far...

Made this for new in- laws, without a test run. I was disappointed how dry, overpowered in cinnamon, and really uninspired this cake was. FYI, 50 minutes was WAY too long for my bundt pan; cake was overdone at 45.

This was a great cake. Lots of healthy ingredients. I used half sugar half splenda, to cut some calories. Also I did a royal icing glaze.Would be good even without any icing. Very tasty.

This a delicious cake and absolutely worth making every week, only to discover that after an hour or so after serving it is gone! I did add a few more carrots and was also generous with the nuts and the lemon ingredients for the icing. Really lovely, thank you!

This is a fantastic cake. I didn't alter the recipe in anyway. The cake is very moist and the flavor is wonderful.

This cake is a healthier version of a fat ladened carrot cake. It is perfect just the way the recipe is written. Cinnamon is so good for us and it is not overpowering in this recipe. I never understand why anyone would change a baking recipe. The science has already been done for us.

I took the advice of others with respect to the recipe and it is wonderful I just had my first piece...umm I am sure I will be back for seconds. I added 2 cups of carrots and I decreased the cinnamon by 50%, I also heated the walnuts in a dry pan to toast them. The cake is moist, has a nice texture and a golden color - it would be fine without any glaze at all. I also took some liberties with the glaze, I increased the lemon juice to 2 tablespoons and the lemon zest to 2 teaspoons, I also used heavy cream because that is what I had on hand. I made the glaze which turned into more of a frosting (yes I know it was the heavy cream and the bit too much beating) then I thined it down with 2% milk to make it back into a glaze...I will probally try to work further with the glaze to get something better out of it but the cake is a repeat recipe for us.

Easiest cake recipe ever, even for a nonbaker like me. Light, delicious. The extra carrot must have done it. Next time I would use a little less sugar.

I really enjoyed making both the carrot cake and the lemon cream cheese icing. I added more then the called for carrots as many of you had suggested. I'm not a big walnut fan, but added them anyway and have to admit that the added difference in texture was appreciated. The cake was very moist. I like lemon so the lemon icing really complemented the cake and I wished I had more for dipping! I thought the consistancy of the icing was not at all like glaze as someone else had suggested, and flowed down the sides of the cake nicely without dripping onto the platter. Again I added double the lemon as I'm a lemon lover and many had suggested more lemon would be nice. I know I'll make it again and next time may add more grated lemon zest. I served this as an Easter dinner dessert and it was a big hit. I would like to find other cakes to use the lemon cream cheese icing on also. It was very easy to make and was delicious!

Although this wasn't bad I too felt that there are much better carrot cake recipes out there.

I have been making this cake for three years and am finally reviewing the recipe. Moist, unique, not overly sweet. I add more carrots than the recipe calls for, and sometimes I serve without frosting. I use extra light (NOT extra virgin) olive oil and black walnuts. Someone always asks for the recipe!

I make this cake once in awhile for gatherings, and it is usually the first dessert gone. It is deliciously moist and the lemon in the frosting brings a great complement to the cake.

This is one of my most requested cakes. I always add more walnuts and carrots then the recipe calls for in order to give more texture. Also, I use more cream in the icing to thin it a bit. I drizzle the icing on the cake with a pastry bag to make it more pleasing to the eye.

I cannot rate this recipe, but the bundt/icing idea came from here. I love the carrot bread recipe from mimiscafe.com, which I've baked into a bundt pan and drizzled w/ the 'lemon icing' recipe from this site. My 1st cake from scratch, and my co-wkrs polished it up!

I did not care for this recipe. There are many much better ones out there.

Do yourself a favor -- keep not only the Olive Oil a secret, keep this recipe a secret from your family and friends. I made this for an Easter dinner and it was roundly booed. It was agreed that the cake was not nearly as moist as other carrot cakes and not sweet enough. One suggestion was to add crushed pineapple for more flavor. A definite recipe for the trash can.

This cake came out unbelievably moist, and was a big hit. I did have the same problem other reviewers had, though, with the cake only rising halfway. My icing was more like frosting, but it was delicious all the same. I absolutely recommend using a full two cups of grated carrot, packed semi-tight in the measuring cup. The taste and texture are quite good.

Did I follow a different recipe? I thought this was a pretty blah carrot cake; not nearly as moist and flavorful as many others I've made. I made it for Easter and I thought it was okay but not great at all. Not on my make-again list.

From a carrot cake lover, this one was great! Both the cake & frosting were very easy to make, however I added more carrots than called for. Will definately make again.

I made this out of necessity: it was the night before my office birthday duty, and I had no butter in the house. The result was very tasty and got great reviews. I'd definitely make this again.

Very, very moist - and I personally don't agree about the cinnamon. Everything was just right! One comment, though: I added more carrots than called for, and couldn't really taste that it was a carrot cake, per se. However, since I was going for the cake part more than for the carrot, it wasn't a problem. The icing truly is heavenly - if nothing else, try at least this!

I have made much better carrot cakes. Too much cinnamon for my taste. The lemon cream cheese icing was nice, I would make that again.

Excellant cake with wonderful icing! Make the icing a little thick - it really is an enhancment to the cake.
