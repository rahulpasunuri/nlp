I've made this dish three times now, the first time it came out great but the subsequent times came out too greasy. That seems to be the trick with this recipe, getting the right amount of duck fat on the potatoes, if I remember correctly you want to coat the potatoes lightly, add more potatoes to use up the fat, but I would not recommend pouring the leftover fat back onto the cake. The flavor is delicious but the eating experience can be compromised by an overload of grease. Also I've learned to use more than the called for amount of potatoes. It calls for 3 layers of 1/16 inch slices, the cake ends up being very thin. It does no harm to the recipe to add more layers. You just may want to adjust the baking time, a toothpick prick should be enough to determine doneness. Also when frying the potatoes in the skillet, fry them for longer than you think you should. The longer you fry it for the better the crispy crust is on top when you serve. Great french recipe!

I wanted to love this recipe - great reviews plus butter and duck fat, what's not to love? However, I prepared it just as written, including the duck fat, but found all the fat overwhelming. The potatoes were too soft and fatty, even though the bottom and sides browned. Could very well have been cook's error but I'm not sure what I did wrong. We typically make the scalloped potatoes and goat cheese for Christmas dinner and this recipe was not nearly as good as that one.

I've made this dish twice now. I double the recipe and make the galette 6 layers instead of 3 (cook 50 minutes instead of 40). This dish looks beautiful when served. The second time I made it I added a pinch (about 1/8 teaspoon) of rubbed sage to the salt mixture which gives a little more flavor without overpowering. I also toasted the garlic in a broiler before sprinkling on top. Also, both times I made a few hours ahead, left in the cast iron skillet tented with aluminum, and reheated for 15 minutes at 300, then flipped and plated without any problem. Excellent recipe.

Excellent and so easy. We will use this one a lot. Great as a side dish for steak.

Boy is this good!! I wished I had made double this recipe. USE DUCK FAT. I was afraid to use duck fat, not knowing what kind of flavor it would add. Well it is an amazing addition and makes the dish top notch. I made this in the morning of my dinner party and reheated just befor serving. There is just a little too much salt in the recipe. I will make this again and again.

The flavor was fantastic. However, I used a reusable parchment paper product that seemed to steam the potatoes so I did not get the crusty result I had anticipated. I would do again with actual parchment paper.

so dirty... and I mean that in a good way.

This was delicious! I actually had goose fat in my freezer (rendered from our Christmas goose months ago) and wow, did it give a great result. The flavor of the goose fat was really delicious with the potatoes. Mmmm...

A hit! I was not able to get duck fat but potatoes, salt, pepper, butter and garlic...how can you go wrong? Super easy so I'll be making this often!

Crusty potato cake, potato galette, and "Pommes Anna" are different terms for the exact same thing... and this recipe is terrific! DO use the duck fat if at all possible, but if you don't have it, use clarified butter so as not to burn it.

This seems like a gallette to me.
