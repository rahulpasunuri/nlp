Other than halving the recipe (fits beautifully in a 9" pyrex pie plate), I made it exactly as printed. Thought it was mah-velous! Tart and sweet and bursting with flavor. Used fresh rhubarb and strawberries. While it would be even better with premium vanilla ice cream, at Passover, beggers can't be choosers. Might try a creme anglais next year. A keeper.

delicious and easy.

The first time I made this I went to four grocery stores before I gave up trying to find rhubarb (including the frozen stuff). I substituted peaches, thinking they might add a bit of tang without getting too sweet. It was AWESOME. This year, I didn't even look for rhubarb.

An enormous hit, two years in a row for Pesach. I used frozen rhubarb, which was easier and worked great.

I made this to rave reviews, amongst those celebrating Passover and those not. I did reduce cooking time to 30 minutes and it was not runny and the crisp was pretty brown. In response to those that thought it too sweet, it's probably due to reducing the rhubarb - with all the sour in the rhubarb it needs the berries and the sugar to cut it. Tastes EXCELLENT cold!

This was a big hit at our Seders this year. I made it with just strawberries, as I am not a big rhubarb fan. The mixture was a bit too sweet for me, but everyone else thought it was perfect. Next time I may try using less sugar. Either way, I will definitely make it again. For me, cooking 40 minutes was perfect. Two bonuses -- very easy to make and did not taste like a Passover dish.

The recipe is easy and delicious but the temperature was way too high for baking the crisp - within 1/2 hour, the crumbs were beginning to singe. I would lower the temperature to 375 and bake until the crumbs are golden.

The compote was fantastic, but if you cannot find or do not want to purchase Matzo or potato starch for just this dish, Martha Stewart's streusel topping works great.

This was great - I made two during Passover. One for the seder, and one to have during the week. It was very easy, and a big hit. Plus, it doesn't taste like a passover dish.

This was the hit of my Passover meal -- absolutely perfect, not too sweet or too tart -- a hit, and easy to make!

This was a fabulous dessert - made even better by pretty simple preparation. I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and cooked it for only about 30-35 mins. which was adequate. I didn't have 1-1/2 lbs. of rhubarb, only had 2 c.(3 stalks) instead of the called-for 4 c. but I compensated w/ another cup or so of strawberries and it still turned out great. We had it with Haagen-Dazs Vanilla - YUM!

Absolutely delicious. However, for the topping, I also added 1 cup of granulated white sugar and mixed it with an electric mixer. I also used 1/2 ground almonds (instead of matzah cake meal) for some of the topping and it was FABULOUS! It also needs to cook for less time - otherwise, it comes out too soupy. But every one loves it! It is VERY delicious!

The kind of recipe that makes me feel like renewing my subscription to Gourmet. I would definitely do this all year-round (and I am planning on it). The texture of the whole dish is great, both crunchy and liquid and the compote has some kick (thanks to the lemon juice). I used frozen strwaberries and may have ended up with more juice than with fresh ones, but I liked it. Enjoy it!
