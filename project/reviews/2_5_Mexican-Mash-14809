Other versions of this are called "Aztec Calendar" and "7-Layer Dip". Its good for Superbowl-type events. In the "recipe" I have you mix the taco seasoning with the sour cream. And yes, add refried beans. Also black olives are good. Some people put chopped onion or green chile. It's very flexible at least.

It was a quick and easy fixing for a Friday night, but there is really nothing special about the recipe itself, it is a layered dish. The taco seasoning mix is used for 1-lb of ground beef, browned - it wasn't listed at all in this recipe. As we didn't have taco seasoning, I found a "copycat" recipe for Taco Bell's Taco Seasoning online. Worked like a charm. Plus we followed a suggestion to use refried beans. Next time, I will use my own red salsa and fresh cilantro.

Are you supposed to layer the taco seasoning or mix it with something?? How much taco sauce (no size)?? This recipe isn't as clear as it could be!!

This is good, but it can be even better if you add a layer of refried beans or refried black beans.

I disagree with the dismissal by the other reviewer. As Superbowl foods go, this fits the bill-- easy, simple, and tasty. Probably wouldn't make it for anything else, but perfect Superbowl fare.

It was OK for some one who does not have any time to put things together.
