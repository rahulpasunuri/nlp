This is a good, basic swiss chard recipe. I also added diced tomatoes. I added them when I added the swiss chard to the skillet so as not to overcook them.

Swiss Chard makes a bold, red statement in your spring vegetable garden and it looks just as good on your table. This recipe is full of the flavors of northern Italy. Try it with a herb crusted roast rack of lamb and wash it all down with rich Italian wine like a 1988 Consanti Brunello di Montelpulciano.
