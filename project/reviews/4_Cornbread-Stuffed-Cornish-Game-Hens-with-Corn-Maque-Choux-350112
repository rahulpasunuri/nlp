Made this for 3 of us at Thanksgiving this year. My first time making and eating Cornish Game Hens. DELICIOUS! and I agree with a previous reviewer - - do not skip with Maque Choux. It's a fancy name for a simple and yummy dish.

Best. Dinner. Ever. In all seriousness, this was INCROYABLE, as our French brethren would say. The only change I made was that I used a single 3.5 pound chicken instead of the 4 game hens. My husband, who in general is not one to enthuse overmuch, walked in the kitchen and announced that it "smells like a holiday!" I had to agree with him...and the end result was as delicious as it smelled. What's not to like about juicy roasted chicken draped in crispy bacon alongside a mound of fragrant, sagey/appley cornbread stuffing and maybe the most delicious variation on creamed corn I've ever had? I'll say it again: the maque choux is DELICIOUS. Do not skip it. A tip: After the bird(s) comes out and is resting, take the foil off your extra stuffing and pop it back in the oven so the top can get golden and a little crispy. (If that's what you like, of course. If you prefer moist, almost steamed stuffing then ignore me.) I'd give this five forks if I could.

This stuffing has become my all-time favorite for any poultry, but also for pork chops. Adding the right amount of apple juice is important to make this stuffing just moist enough without making it mushy. The amount may depend on the type of cornbread you use. I also added dried craisins, for a punch of color and taste.

WOW! This recipe is divine. I made it for my Mom and mother-in-law for their joint birthday party and it was a HUGE hit. Can't wait to make it again. I used all fresh ingredients/herbs and it paid off. I used both kinds of apples and made my own cornbread the night before instead of store bought. YUM!

This recipe is time consuming, but SO well worth it. (One of my favorite fall recipes, I like to use fresh apples picked from the orchard and their organic cider as well.) The maque choux is fantastic, complements the hens perfectly.

I thought this was good, but not excellent.The stuffing wasn't moist enough for me and I used well over 6T of apple cider. If I made it again I think I might add more egg...not sure.

Excellent and easy recipe. I didn't think roasting game hens could be improved, but the stuffing really enhances the dish. This makes for a more elegant presentation, we did six hens for Christmas dinner and it was fabulous. I did omit the cheese for the stuffing, and used grape juice instead of apple.

I made this for a small Thanksgiving gathering last night and it was a huge hit. The stuffing is wonderful, so tasty and moist--feel free to make extra! Browning on a skillet is not entirely necessary, and common sense would tell you to coat the birds with oil or butter before adding the spices, but otherwise this recipe is pretty dead on.I brined the birds for three hours (salt, sugar and shallots)--not a bad idea anytime you're baking birds.

so good, i'm writing my first review! after chopping the apples, i decided to take a handful out and replace with a handful of dried cranberries. it made the stuffing FANTASTIC! anybody that had complaints about the apples either failed to chop them finely enough or did not saute them long enough... i used a chopper with a very small guard for my onions/celery/apples and cooked each for about 2 minutes longer than the recipe called for, and the texture of the finished product was perfect. the only noticeable chunks were the cranberries, which made the dish scream holiday dinner. i cooked the extra stuffing in a cupcake pan and the cakes slid right out and looked great on the plate... it will be made many times! thank you for the outstanding recipe!!!

This meal is out of this world. So good, in fact, that I've cooked hundreds of recipes from Epicurious and I've never reviewed one . . . until now. Appalled that this has 3 1/2 forks instead of 4, I had to review it. It's the PERFECT fall meal.

Wonderful meal! I used Trader Joe's cornbread mix (made it the night before). I didn't bother browning the hens, Just rubbed softened butter on them, liberally sprinkled Kosher salt and fresh ground pepper on top and then stuck a sprig of fresh sage on each hen (I tucked the stem under the kitchen twine holding their legs together). The birds were beautifully browned and moist. My butcher had somewhat larger hens (1.5-2.5lbs ea), so I ended up having to cook them substantially longer, but they were just perfect. The stuffing will be a new regular in our house - even if it's just for a 'basic' chicken.

I made this recipe once before and the stuffing was too moist and lacked flavor. This time I spatchcocked the birds and cooked them on mounds of stuffing. Roasted oiled hens without skillet browning for 25 minutes, added salt, pepper, sage, and bacon strips then baked for remaining 20 minutes. Doubled the amounts of sage in both the stuffing and on the birds. Result was great stuffing, beautiful browned birds and rave comments from my guests on the birds and the fantastic Corn Maque Choux.

I doubled this recipe to serve eight people. Made it exactly as written, except that I used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon. I don't know how much the bacon added to the taste, but the hens were delicious...tender and moist. When I cleared the plates, I was pleased to see that all the bones had been picked clean by my guests. Surely, the sign of a successful recipe. I had loads of stuffing left over. I made it with the Corn Maque Choux, and the two were delicious together. I also served cucumber salad from Gourmet, December 2008, and the sweet/sour taste of the salad was a perfect compliment to the sweetness of the stuffing. Wonderful meal. I would make it all again.

The hen was delicious, but I was not impressed with the stuffing, Next time I would make a regular bread stuffing (no apples). The maque choux, however, was fantastic.

Very yummy!! Best cornish hen I've ever tasted! Made the mistake of adding 2 extra tsp of salt in the stuffing, but still came out great!! Very juicy and tender

Loved this and so did everyone else - I left off the bacon for dietary reasons, and it was still fantastic. Made it as is and for sure it's a keeper.

It was time consuming, but was prepared since had read these reviews. It was such a success, the two other couples wanted the recipe. Next time I would make more corn stuffing and Maque Choux since wasn't enough for seconds or leftovers...at least at our house. To save time, I used two pans for browning, three each (since dinner party of 6) and 10 mins was about right. Wish we had chicken leftovers too.

Fabulous! Stuffing kept birds moist. I used a packaged cornbread stuffing because I didn't have time to make corn bread but it worked. I added some dried cranberries and used a sharp cheddar with wine. Great taste--I could have eaten just the stuffing! Corn Maque Choux was also great with it.

This was truly great. I used organic and local farm vegetables and the combination of flavors was outstanding. I would recommend using corn muffins instead of corn bread - more flavor and texture that way. And making sure that the skin on hens didn't tear was quite a task, that would be a trick to make them look perfect if you are not a pro. The meat was definitely the moistest of any game hen meat I have ever had.

I have been a devoted subscriber to Bon Appetit for over 25 years. I regularly cook from the magazine. This is by far the least impressive recipe that I have found in Bon Appetit. I do agree with others that the Maque Choux was very good.

I agree with the Cook from Boston that it was labor intensive but it was defintiely worth the effort. I could only find 1- 3/4 lb hens leaving only a little stuffing left if I used the full cup of stuffing as the recipe called for. The Corn Maque Choux was wonderful and I would make it again to serve as a side dish with a number of other main dishes.

Served this dish at a dinner party and everyone enjoyed it. The stuffing was not as flavorful as I would have liked but overall a good dinner. The Corn Maque Choux received rave reviews!

I almost never give recipes 4 forks, but this was surprisingly yummy and different. It was labor intensive with making the stuffing, searing the hens, then cooking. All told it took about 2 hours (including the Maque Choux), but the hens were so moist and the stuffing is some of the best I've ever made. Only change I did was to use carrots instead of celery (since I don't like cooked celery). Very, very good.
