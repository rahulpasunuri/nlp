I thought this was a very nice light salad and the dressing lets the flavors from the radishes and cucumber standout. My boyfriend didn't like it but he's picky and hates vinegar.

This was, despite some very tasty components, one of the most bland salads we've ever encountered!!

Very light and fresh-tasting salad. I used seasoned rice vinegar and thought it was great. Also, used a combination of baby spinach and baby romaine, worked fine.
