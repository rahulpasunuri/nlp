I served this dip with vegetable crudites, and crostini. It was very poplular. I added toasted pine nuts on top. Next time I will add chopped roasted red bell peppers as well!

I consider myself one of those people who can eat anything and appreciate it, but I did not like this recipe. I made it for a party and served it with boiled potatoes. It was way too salty and fishy. I guess it could be ok without the anchovies (I did put only half of the anchovies as another person recommended, but it was still way too much!). Definately would not make this again.

This is a dish beyond compare in that the results are so tasty for the amount of time preparing it requires. Fresh basil is a must, of course. Thanks to the other reviewers who advised cutting the mayonnaise and anchovies in half. Using nonfat or lowfat mayonnaise should not impair the taste, and if used, this would be not only low-carb but low-fat. I'll add this to party menus. It's a nice break from cream cheese dips.

This recipe had all the ingredients for a great dip, but in the end just did not do it for me. Especially the Mayonaise. There is no need for it.It was also way too salty, without adding a drop of salt and using less anchovies. In the end the final product was just ok and no one really raved about it. There are so many great tapenades out there that I would go back to before ever doing this one again.

Awesome dip!!! I cut the amount of anchovies in half and the mayo in half. Always a hit. Serve with toasted baquette slices or veggies. The purple color may look weird, but get past it - it's too good.

This dip has been a big winner at my parties. It is easy to make and goes over well. I agree about limiting the anchovies and will put in just enough mayo to smooth the texture.

In my opinion the proportions in the recipe are in error. As one of the reviewers mentioned the recipe turns out way too fishy and too heavy with the mayonaise. I double the olives and this produces a product that is hard to stop eating. Always a favourite as modified.

I made this for a catering job. It was barely touched. I think the purple color was a bit scary for people. I thought it had too much mayo and was too fishy. I'll stick to other dips.

I made this for a supper my yoga class was having. Everyone enjoyed it and what leftovers there were went home to the partners of the yoga teacher and one of the other students, both of whom are tapenade fans. They sent back requests for the recipe so I guess it's really good.

Great recipe. I would recommend making it 2-3 days in advance, since the flavor really improves with time. I served this with chunks of good bread. Yummy!

This recipe was excellent. I made it for a party, and have made it for friends- everyone loves it. It's perfect on pita bread or crackers, and also great with sliced veggies.

I've made this dip twice and both times have been begged for the recipe. It's a keeper!

This was so good that when I put it out with the rest of the dips, it was gone in 30 minutes!!
