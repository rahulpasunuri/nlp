This was incredible! I made it for my mom's 69th birthday dinner and it was perfectly tender and full of flavor. It cooked in exactly the amount of time the recipe called for. Like others, I used red wine instead of port but managed to find red currant jelly and it was delicious. This will be a special occasion dish in our house!

I served this for Christmas dinner to rave reviews. The sauce could be doubled...it's that good! The pork was very tender and flavorful from the marination. Will definitely make again and I'm looking forward to the leftovers.

very good even the kids liked it. As i did not have on hand all ingredients I used raspberry jam instead of currant; red wine instead of port and red pepper mustard. I thought the sauce would have been an iffy but the kids liked it enough to put on their rice. Definetly make again. Thanks for the recipe.

Heart it!!!!! Though 12 hours for marinating is a drawback, well worth the time. I did take note of another reviewer & cut back on the salt. Used a French Press to strain the sauce, which was scrumtrulescent.

The meat was succulant and flavorful. I would suggest a tad kess salt. The sauce was perhaps more labor-intensive than it needed to be; on the plus side it holds up well to reasonable substitutions.

Hubby, not a lover of sweet sauce was wild about this. Cooked pork to 140, done to perfection. Sauce outstanding. No red current jelly, used red raspberry. Easy to make, totally yummy. Will make again and again.

Fanastic! Made it for two - took considerably less time in the oven (smaller cut of meat). Forgot the ground ginger, so had to substitute with fresh, and couldn't find currant jelly, so used dried from the store. Also used blood oranges. Deeeelicious! Will make again and again.

I made this for a casual Sunday meal because I happened to have an organic pork loin from the farmer's market and all the other ingredients on hand. Wow, the complex flavors far exceeded my family's and my expectations, considering it was so easy to prepare. I decreased the amount of salt to one tbl. and used chicken stock (as recommended by other reviewers, for the sauce. Also added a fair amount of pepper to both loin and sauce, but other than that, stayed true to the recipe. Served it with roasted baby carrots and mashed potatoes, we'll be having the leftovers tomorrow. Great recipe!

This is an amazing pork recipe. I actually revised it and made it in my slow cooker. It came out devine and I have to admit I'm not a big pork eater. Instead of red-currant jelly I used dried currants from the health food store, I also purchased fresh dried fennel seeds which really made it pop.

I view of the rave reviews this recipe has gotten, I was a little disappointed. I found the sauce to be cloyingly sweet. There are better pork recipes on Epicurious in my opinion. I highly recommend Pork Tenderloin with Sauteed Onion and Fennel and Fennel Cream.

This dish was fabulous and very easy to make. I marinated the pork overnight and substituted chicken stock for the water in the sauce. The sauce has many layers of flavours and is simply divine. I served this for Easter to guests with the roasted yams with maple allspice butter, also off of this site. It was a huge hit. Thanks again, Epicurious!

The sauce is really delicious. Worth the effort.

I made this for Easter dinner - I wish I had more friends that I could serve pork to, it was an easy dish to make but looked and tasted impressive.

Wow, this was great. I made a couple of changes...used blood orange juice and chicken stock (instead of water) to deglaze the tiny bit of drippings that meat produced. Served with white rice mixed with brown and wild rices (all separately cooked and blended together with a bit of butter and parsley) and then accompanied with 4-fork "apple, dried cherry, and walnut salad with maple dressing" from this site. YUM!

I made this for Easter dinner as a departure from the usual...it was extraordinary! My family raved for days and even ate the leftovers (something not normally done in my family!) I will definitely make this again.

I, too, served this for Easter dinner. It was simple and very tasty.

Just made it for Easter dinner and it was really delicious. The pan sauce also was very interesting and added a nice dimension. I would use the Seasoned salt as a rub for weeknight cooking.

Made this for Easter and it was great. The Cumberland Pan sauce was also delicious. I agree with a previous reviewer - just making this dish with the seasoned rub would be good for a weeknight dinner.

There were only two of us for dinner, so I used a 2 inch thick boneless pork chop butterflied, and rubbed it inside and out with the bay/fennel/salt mixture. Folded the chop back in half, and coated the outside with dijon mustar (out of whole grain). Browned the chop well on all sides with a bit of olive oil in my skillet, and finished it off in the oven. Used the same skillet with the drippings to make the sauce as written, but added a splash of champagne citrus vinegar. Hubbie said it was delicious. Didn't have time to marinate the chop, but flavors really did come through. Great for a weeknight supper, and I'll try it again with pork tenderloins for company.
