Scrumptious cake - moist, rich, and interesting combination of flavors. However, gets only 3 stars out of 4 from me because of some assembly issues - cake was so fragile and sticky that it fell apart during the removal from the pan, even with parchment paper. Not a huge problem though, as I successful glued it back together with the delicious frosting =). Also, I'd be interested to try this cake with a less intense frosting - maybe a white chocolate frosting - which would allow the subtle flavors of the cake to stand out more.

This is norhing like Christmas cake or pudding. I grew up in Ireland on both. Nevertheless it is one of the most scrumptious cakes I have ever eaten. Fun to make, spicy, nutty, chocky, fudgy and moist all in one. A hit with the guests (a fussy crowd).

This cake was really fun to make and beautiful! However, I sadly watched as everyone took one bite and put their forks down. It it REALLY rich. Not one person made it past the second or third bite. But it is easy and impressive.

I made this for Christmas, and it was a hit. Everyone loved it, and most of my guests took some home with them. I had forgotten to review it until now, when the subject came up. Quite delicious, and I'm definately going to make it again. Yummy!

I served this cake on Christmas Eve and everyone loved it! An elegant, delicious, easy to make holiday cake. I will definitely make it again. Thank you.

This is a special and wonderful holiday treat! Everyone at our holiday dinner loved this--someone thought it came from "one of those fancy food catalogs!" I used half cup apricots and half cup dates and it worked. This is moderately easy considering the stacking, but there was too much batter for the pan and it dripped over. The frosting is outrageuosly smooth and rich. The flavors mellow over time. A successful marriage of spice and chocolate and a new tradition in my family.

I would make this again, not too difficult. Delicious, not comparable to plum pudding, but very good. I had a guest from England and he enjoyed it very much!

I am English and find this recipe so far different from our traditional Christmas Plum Pudding, I simply couldn't get past it. If you like chocolate, you will like this, but please know this is NOT an English Christmas Pudding. Perhaps a less misleading name could be chosen?

Excellent. Easy to make. Absolutely delicious but only to chocolate lover and someone who enjoys the flavor of alcohol in their dessert. Can be made afew days ahead. It remains moist. I froze the what was left and have served it directly from the freezer (it still slices nicely)allowing the slices to sit one-two minutes. This pudding is like the plum puddings of old.
