This is the perfect dessert. The first time I made this cake, I used my old tried and true crepe recipe. All my guests loved it and there wasn't a spot left on the serving plate. After reading the reviews, some saying the crepe receipe itself was off, needed extra eggs, extra milk, too much flour, I decided to follow the exact recipe. Something I ususally do, at least the very first time I try a new recipe. I must say, this crepe is extraordinary. I am amazed at the dirrerence it makes. It is light, complicated yet simple, just a hint of sweetness, and completes the dish, making it absolutely perfect. You will certainly not be disappointed.

The cake has great flavor profile. I've made it twice now, and had a few of my modification to the recipe. One of my complaints for this recipe is that the crepe can be doughy, due to the amount of flour and egg called for. I guess, the ratio will make the crepe success rate much higher, though you sacrifice the actual crepe texture as this also make it tough. The second time when I made it, I doubled the milk and the crepe is much better already. (I used an 9" skillet instead of the 10-inch one, and I also very good at making thin crepes from my years of practice) For the next time, I'll probably cut the number of eggs used, so that the orange flavor can shine through better.

I loved this recipe. I made it "as is" for my first attempt and my guests liked it. One of my guest suggested putting cinnamon on it because the flavor was so delicate. I didn't have any so we sprinkled pumpkin pie spice on it and then it tasted awesome! Next time I make it I'm going to try the lemon curd and or some chocolate.

I made this with my husband who loves crepes and we enjoyed it tremendously!! The grand Marnier is definitely the key to this delicious dessert!

Made this for a small dinner party last night. It was not only delicious but the presentation is stunning. I read all the reviews and assembled the cake in an 8" springform. The only alteration I made was adding about 1 1/2 cups lemon curd to the whipped cream.My guests and my husband thought this cake was world-class, straight out of a french bakery. Pretty good for a stack of pancakes!

I love the consistency of this crepe batter for stacking them. I use this recipe with all different fillings and toppings and always with rave reviews.

So even though I have already reviewed this recipe, I have made it many times since and thought I should note that my prior review note was successful if you want a variation: half orange zest, half lemon zest, AND half Grand Marnier, half Limoncello for a rounded out citrus flavor. Happy eating!

Absolutely delightful. Always a crowd pleaser. Notes: add a few spoons additional flour to slightly thicken the consistency of the batter (more honey-like). Also, the flavor of the Grand-Marnier is very delicate and light, if you wish to add more it won't harm the cream, or you may choose to add a few drops of orange essence to the cream. The best whip cream is by a hand-held mixer, not a standing mixer. Do not over-beat or it will separate. Some of the whip-cream will be absorbed into the crepes overnight creating a more stiff, and perfect cake. I used thinly round orange slices to decorate part of the top, and sometimes raspberries. The ultimate dessert.

Beautiful and impressive dessert... My number one tip? Get a crepe pan. I commandeered my mother's and all my crepes came out just the same size and beautiful. I was worried about it holding up over night, so I did half whipped cream have pastry cream, as per someone's suggestion on here. Probably wasn't necessary, but was delicious. I also love how versatile this recipe is! I'm not huge on Grand Marnier, so I did rosemary (infused in the pastry cream) and lemon zest. I finished it with granulated sugar mixed with more lemon zest sprinkled liberally on top. Added a nice zing and wonderful texture. It really wowed my fellow super club attendees. Yay!

Delicious, but the filling turned out rather runny for me and when I decided not to add more confectioner's sugar (hate the sickly sweet overpowering taste) it turned into more of a glaze. Still delicious, but something to be aware of.

Okay, Im sold. I had to throw together dessert for a last minute pot luck and needed to make something one evening for the next day after work. I took 9hennings advice and doubled the batter recipe. Then because I had the ingredients on hand, I used lemon zest instead of orange and jarred lemon curd lightened with whipped cream. Then I took Bethesda Cooks advice and layered the crepes with the curd-whipped cream mixture in a 10 springform pan. The cake was refrigerated for just under 24 hours, and to my delight the crepes did not get soggy as I feared they might. Just before hauling it to the picnic area, I garnished it with a big dollop of whipped cream in the center with several long strands of lemon zest. This orange/Grand Marnier version as well as chocolate crepes drizzled with still warm chocolate ganache (thanks emsgrrl from Boston) are on the definitely-make-real-soon list. Beautiful AND yummy!

Fabulous when made to the recipe...even better when you add a 1/4 cup of flaked bittersweet chocolate to the filling. I made this in a springform pan, which made it look much neater and was very easy to slice.

Everyone agrees on the flavor of this-perfect. But I want to comment on the size. I personally liked the size of this cake. Doing it per the recipe yielded a cake that was approx. 3" high when I made 6.5" diameter crepes. If you chill the cake throroughly and use a sharp serrated knife to cut it, there are no issues with messiness. I think that any higher and it would tend to topple. The presentation could be enhanced by a pretty topper like glazed fresh fruit AND by making sure each crepe is fairly uniform in shape/size. (I was a little sloppy in crepe-making). I will DEFINITELY make again and possible try half orange zest, half lemon zest, AND half Grand Marnier, half Limoncello for a rounded out citrus flavor. Great make-ahead dish for a party if you can find fridge room for it!

I think as far as taste, this recipe is outstanding, the strong hint of orange flavor is such a bright contrast for crepes and whipped cream. The only real reason i give it three forks instead of four is that the batter recipe, like one other reviewer said, only gets about 18 crepes at the scant 1/4-cup measurement, and part of the point of a mille crepes is that it's impressive because it's tall. I think next time I'll just make a double batch of batter and 1.5-batch of cream, which by my calculations should end up with about 36 crepes. I'm also a little concerned with how messy it is cutting, but one could probably combine the whipped cream with a thicker pastry cream and get something with more structure.

Wonderful recipe. Enjoy changing it up by alternating thin layers of Mexican chocolate and dulce de leche on the crepes.

I have made this three times, always to excellent reviews. I increased the amount of Grand Marnier and topped it with raspberries soaked in Grand Marnier.

Another suggestion to this cake...I put a large dollop of the same whipping cream on each slice and drizzled melted Nutella...Heaven!! Really loved this recipe. Next time I will put Nutella on every few layers just to add some depth in flavors. You should try it.

I just made this today, I thought it look so unique in the photo so I tried it out. It was simple and tasted great. This is definitely a keeper and a good base for making different types of cakes next time with this recipe. The batter didn't quite make 24 crepes. It made about 18 or so...still didn't change it too much. I'd probably serve it with some nice berries next time.

I have made this cake four times. The first, I made as is. Delish. The second time, I used lemon zest and spread a thin layer of lemon curd on each crepe. I then added limoncello to the whipped cream. Delish also. I also have put cocoa powder and Bailey's in the whipped cream and spread Nutella (after softening in the microwave first). This dessert always brings down the house!

Made this for a birthday, and it turned out beautifully. The guest of honor has quite the sweet tooth, so I covered the cake in its entirety with a simple ganache (3/4c heavy cream, 12oz bittersweet chocolate, 3tbsp Grand Marnier). Once it set, topped with raspberries and some extra orange zest. Definitely an impressive result.

I was nervous about making this the night before but it was fine. The directions don't say to, but I put waxed paper between the crepes as I made them. Otherwise I'd be afraid they'd stick together. You don't need a special crepe pan; I used a le creucet cast iron pan. Got great compliments from my guests. This is VERY French, so not for diners who would rather have ice cream and hot fudge, if you know what I mean.

i would add an extra tablespoon grand marnier next time. also... next time i will fold the orange zest into the whipcream AFTER whipping the cream. otherwise the zest clings to the whisk and doesn't want to fall off.

Delicious dessert crepe served in an interesting way. I made 1/2 the recipe to make a crepe "pie." Great with chocolate sauce drizzled over it.

The best crepe mix I've ever had. Made the crepe cake and everyone loves it! Tastes like I've been in Paris over and over again!

Simple, delicious and very elegant. I made one minor change by adding more orange zest to both crepe batter and whipped cream. Friends and family loved it and I was thrilled that I could make it a day in advance of the party!

Took the advice from another cook to add blood oranges to the filling. Glad I did! Beautiful colour and wonderful tart-sweet flavour. Would make a great summer dessert.

I tried this at home for my family and it was a huge hit. The only problem was I didn't have an orange for the zest so I subbed it with a teaspoon of Grand Manier. I thought it worked out great.

I too thought it needed a little extra orange boost. Perhaps additional orange zest? Also, I think it needed some fruit either served on the side or carefully layered in between the crepes. All in all, it was quite good and definiately different.

This was easy and good. I used blood oranges and it added a great deal of color and flavor.

This was actually my first time making crepes - they turned out really well, if a bit unattractive. I added extra Grand Marnier, but I think it still could have used more orange flavoring - maybe a bit more zest.

mmm. make sure you let it warm a tab before serving.
