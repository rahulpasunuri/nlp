I am sort of an intermediate greens eater and probably do it more to placate my partner. I doctored the recipe out of necessity with what I had on hand. (Sweet onion, raspberry vinegar, smoked bacon end.) Dont over boil or over braise the kale, keep it crisp. I found this recipe simple and delicious however Kale is slightly bitter so add some sugar or honey to the vinegar (to make the medicine go down) if you are trying to indoctrinate a carnivore.

use extra bacon, less kale, then deposit into trash.

The vinegar didn't go well with the bacon.

Delicious; but use a little less bacon to make it healthier.

I love this recipe. It's a great way to cook kale. It's a delicious side dish with almost anything.

This recipe is easy and delicious. I've made it several times. I also took the bacon out and drained it on a paper towl after it had browned, otherwise it would be too soggy. I used balsamic vinegar and cut it to 2 table spoons. This recipe goes great with teriyaki chicken or steak.

surprisingly delicious, my husband loved it ( he's not much of a greens guy). A nice side dish for fish or poultry I think.

I make this frequently, using the following variations from time to time: balsamic instead of red wine vinegar, adding the vinegar as soon the pan is covered; shallots instead of onions; a 50/50 mix of mustard greens and kale instead of all kale, blanching the mustard greens and adding when ready to cover the kale. It's a great accompaniment to strong meats, sausages, or hearty fowl dishes. A good basic technique.

This was a very good side dish for our Southern Dinner of Fried Chicken. I did change one thing. When the bacon browns I took it out and put it on paper towels. I cooked like normal and then added the crisp bacon on top at the end. I used some roasted red peppers to add some color. It was good.
