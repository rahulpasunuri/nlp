Was a bit short on time so did not grill the peppers/onions - and the slaw was delicious. Agree with previous comments that grilling the peppers would change texture - this was a nice, crispy slaw. Added some chopped pickled jalapeños, reduced peppers from 3 to 2, and onions to 2-3, chopped, including some of the green part.

Wow, I can't believe the other reviews for this are so lukewarm. My whole family, including 2 picky boys, loved it! I changed it a bit, but not much - roasted the pepper and green onions in the oven to save time (and sprayed with cooking spray instead of using the oil, which kept the calories low, too), and added smoked paprika and a bunch of salt to the dressing. Perfect side to a quick quesadilla dinner.

Made this for my husband and I. I didn't like this at all. The dressing is weak and 'smoking' the onions and red peppers is a joke and waste of time. To get the pepper charred it became limp and not 'slaw-like' or like the picture. You sure don't pick up the smokey flavor.

Have not rated this recipe because I did not make it according to the recipe, rather, as I was in a hurry, I followed the suggestions not to grill the peppers. This is a mistake and the recipe came out very bland and not appealing. Nobody in my family liked it or ate it, which is very unusual. I will try it again sometime soon and follow it to the letter. The suggestion to add salt made it at least pallatable on the second day!

Very fresh tasting and different from the usual mayonnnaisy slaw. About a teaspoon of salt adds depth to the flavors. Also, I didn't bother smoking the onions or red peppers, just sliced the peppers razor thin in the processor. Very colorful.
