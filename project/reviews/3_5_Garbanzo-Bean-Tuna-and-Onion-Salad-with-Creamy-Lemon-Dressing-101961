I have made this recipe many times over the years and all of my friends go crazy for its light flavor. I can't count the number of times I've passed this recipe along since I first saw it published. Don't skip the lemon zest!

I like the veggies and beans in this tuna salad. I was a bit short on mayo, so i used some olive oil, which gave more depth of flavor and added to the creamy texture. Definitely in need of salt and pepper. Next time I will use less mustard.

I've made this salad several times--usually when I'm dieting, because it's a healthy light lunch with only a couple hundred calories. Tastes better than most low calorie lunches! I agree that it lends itself to many variations. I didn't have any cherry tomatoes today, so I substituted some roasted red pepper and it worked very well. I use Greek yogurt just because it's so much better in texture for almost anything you make.

Very nice combo of flavors and good on lettuce leaves for a cool summer lunch. Will remember to make again!!

As I am not a fan of tuna in can I wouldn't love this recipe anyway, but it is much better than what I thought would be. Very good recipe for when you are out of a variety of fresh food and running out of time. The zest made the difference! I was out of parsley and lemon so used cilantro and lime instead. I used more lime zest than what is required, substituted light mayo for Nasoya fat free vegi-based spread (a really better choice that I finally found in the market and made this recipe even healthier). At the end I also added fresh grounded black pepper.

Delicious! Simple, exceptional blend of flavor and textures. I ate this and leftovers for lunch a few days straight. Kept very well. I used greek style yogurt.

Don't fear the yogurt and tuna combo! At least, not if it's Greek yogurt. I use full-fat Greek yogurt & regular mayonnaise and the taste is wonderful. It's also great with just mayo, or just olive oil (and then you can leave out the tuna for an easy vegan dish). This recipe lends itself infinitely to substitutions and additions, but the lemon zest is the one thing I never omit. I often add some farfalle for a quick and tasty pasta salad, or add some fresh basil. Finally, as others have said, the beans-to-tuna ratio is too high. I use half the beans, and navy beans work nicely too. All in all, a great dish and a warm-weather staple for me.

I really liked this. It was fresh and crunchy. I added 1/2 cup of radishes for a little extra zip. yum.

the basis of this salad - a creamy, lemony, herby/oniony tuna + bean salad - is great. i'm definitely going to make it again. the idea of nonfat yogurt, mustard and tuna together kind of grossed me out too, so i left out the mustard and used a combo of olive oil and full-fat mayo. i used canellinis instead of garbanzos but next time i won't - garbanzos probably work better since they're firmer and have a richer flavor. other than that, great - i used the full amt and possibly more of the lemon juice and zest, parsley, and onion, and i think they really make it. i also enjoyed the tomato and plan to add more the next time i make it.

Great salad idea but the thought of tuna and yogurt together made me swallow hard. I used veganaise and a dash of rice wine vinegar instead. I left out the dijon but used dill & fresh parsley. I opted to use a red onion instead of the white and added cucumber...carrot would be a great addition. A tiny drizzle of siracha (addict) made this great. For more protein, spelt berries could be used instead of tuna...yum!!!

After reading all the reviews, I think it would be great to have a "I've been meaning to make this for 5+ years" blog. This is really a great Sunday night supper/hot summer night supper. I took other readers' advice & used cannelli beans, rather than garbanzos, and also used canned Italian tuna in olive oil, a generous crack of pepper & some salt. I will try using Greek yogurt next time, just to taste the difference. Thanks, also, to those who suggested one can of beans & 2 cans of tuna.

My reaction to this: meh. It was bland; the tuna disappeared among the other ingredients. Contrary to other reviewers I thought the fresh tomatoes sort of saved the dish. It was okay but there are tons of better recipes on the site.

Delicious, and REALLY easy, but be careful with the sauce, you won't need to use all of it. I used light sour cream instead of yogurt, left out the tomatoes, and added a grated carrot.

This was great! I used real mayo, whole milk Greek yogurt and tuna packed in olive oil. I have made this several times now and have also added some fresh dill for a change of pace. Great with crunchy snap peas added in as well.

Glad I looked past the "ghastly" review and decided to make this, because I thought it was really tasty. I plan to make it again. I found this recipe because I had half a can of leftover chickpeas, so I was glad to see the suggestion to use only half! The proportion of beans to tuna was perfect for me, but depending on which texture you prefer, add more of that one. I had a huge bunch of parsley so I doubled that and it enhanced the freshness. Dried parsley definitely would not yield the same result. I threw the tomatoes on top and decided they are optional. It is good without them, but if you have really amazing and worthy tomatoes go ahead and add them. This salad is good stand-alone, but if I were to serve it in a pita I would throw in another can of tuna.

This was ghastly. Just ghastly. Made it for its low fat content, but ended up throwing the whole thing out. Some tastes should never be put together---tuna and yogurt are two of them.

I made this for a summer luncheon and got rave reviews. I only used about 2/3 of the 16oz garbonzo beans, and I also added some fresh ground pepper for a little zing. Excellent creamy lemon flavor - a keeper.

After hanging on to this recipe for years I finally got around to trying it and only wish I had done so sooner! I did substitute cannellini for garbanzo beans and added chopped red pepper in place of tomato. The result was a very light fresh tasting salad. Delicious!

my new standard tuna salad recipe. the lemon makes it. I use cilantro instead of parsley. It tastes great!

A great tuna salad for a tasty summer lunch. I used italian tuna (packed in oil) and drained the oil. Nice texture, lemony taste--a different, tasty switch from the typical tuna salad. I think I'll try again with cannellini, as one reviewer suggested. I would also had some freshly ground pepper to give it a little more zing.

Wonderful way to dress up tuna. I used 'regular' tuna, left out the tomatoes (not in season)- and the salad was perfect anyway. The lemon gives just the right taste.

I made this as written, except I made a mistake and put in twice the parsley. We loved the taste. I also used 2% yogurt- creamier. This one is a keeper.

As mentioned by an earlier reviewer, the ratio of beans to tuna is not great - I would reduce the beans by half. Also, this tastes MUCH better with cannellini beans - not as starchy.

This is a really fresh-tasting, zippy salad (especially if you up the lemon zest & juice). And it keeps well if you add the tomatoes on the side. Despite being virtuous, it's far from bland, & is filling too.

This is good. There are better tuna salads out there, but will keep this one for variety.

Very good and a nice alternative to the regular tuna salad I make with mucho mayo. I used orange juice instead of lemon juice and a can of albacore in water instead of the standard tuna in water. Decided to hold the tomatoes and add just prior to serving because I was concerned the tomatoes would make the salad to watery while being held in the refrigerator to chill. A good low fat salad that I will definetly make again

This is a great flavorful protein rich alternative to plain tuna salad. I used all the zest and juice from one lemon and liked the extra lemon flavor. It was light yet hearty for a great hot weather meal.

Rating: 2
I found this to be too heavy and starchy, especially if put in a pita. The ratio of beans to tuna was very high. Using a lot of cherry tomatoes and lettuce helped to balance it out, but next time I would use 1/2 the beans, or put it on lettuce as a salad. The dressing had a nice flavor.

A delicious, quick, easy, cheap salad that went down fine with the meat-and-potatoes-man. This is kind of an 'interim review' as I was feeling too lazy to grate lemon peel, and promptly had a brain-leak and forgot both the parsley and the tomatoes. I used regular mayo as I don't approve of the synthetic nature of fat-free stuff. I would consider using all Greek yoghurt (with its own unctuous fat content) another time; the added acidity might avoid the need for more lemon juice mentioned by another reviewer. Definitely a do-again, and I'll re-review when I've done it 'properly'! Was also thinking that orange juice might add an alternative taste dimension as a variation...

No mayo, so used all yogurt. No Dijon either, so used hot mustard instead. I don't like mayo and mustard anyway, but this recipe got such good reviews, and I had a craving for tuna, so I decided to make it. I was surprised that I really liked it. Just wondering though...did using all yogurt and hot mustard change the flavour REALLY change the flavour of the original recipe? Would it be much different if I used the mayo and Dijon?

This recipe was OK, but nothing extraordinary for me. I will try it again, using more lemon, more tuna, and I think cannellini beans. A nice change of pace, though...the lemon adds a fresh touch.

Oh, YUMMMMM! ...and the lemony flavor is nice and zippy. Made this last nite. Used 2 cans of tuna and only 1/4 c. chopped parsley. Also, in the dressing, increased the lemon zest to 2 tsp. Will DEFINITELY make this again.

This salad was a nice change for my family. It is an excellent dish to prepare on a hot day when you don't want to heat up the house by use of the oven. I used pita haves with this and it turned out a great. A tip for the pitas are to open it up and form a pouch and fill it with the salad. Prepared according to this recipe the amount was more than what my family ate. Next time I prepare this I will use **less chick peas and more tuna.**

I like this, it is very refreshing, not fattening and healthy. I thought the lemon and parsley were a bit overpowering, my husband didn't think so. He kept saying that I should add more tuna, not in my opinion. I served it in whole wheat pita with green leaf lettuce. I do plan on making this again, but may cut back on the lemon and parsley.

This was delicious and light! I will never bother with 'normal' tuna salad again. This is wonderful as written; I have also successfully substituted about 1/4 of a preserved lemon, diced very fine, for the lemon zest and juice. Kidney beans also are yummy in place of the chickpeas.

This was just plain god-awful and it's no better the next day. As for it making 4 servings, maybe if you're wild about it. Otherwise, 12 would be more like it. Both the lemon and the parsley are overwhelming. Save your time and your money. Never again.

Super recipe...dressing was refreshingly lemony and light. To experiment with a southwestern flavor, made another batch of dressing but also adding dash of hot sauce and chopped up chipolte peppers (chipoltes in adobo sauce would do as well, with bit of crushed garlic, and tossed that with a sliced grilled tenderloin salad with roasted corn and that was really good as well. For version 3, added a dash of curry powder for a light curry dressing and again, quite good.

I was skeptical after glancing at the dressing ingredients, but wow! I used lime zest and juice instead, since I didn't have lemon on hand. Plus, I added some sliced avocado. My husband really liked it, and I loved it...a definite keeper!

Very tangy tuna salad with lemon dressing - the chick peas (garbanzo beans) to give it substance and the celery etc. give a good crunch. Maybe a bit more tuna would be a good addition with all that yummy dressing. Particularly good for a summer lunch buffet - next time I'd probably double it, as it actually does only give about 4 decent servings.

I made this as a main course served with cantelope slices. For our taste we would decrease the parsley to 1/4 c. because it seemed overpowering.It made 5 main servings with 1/2 slice of pita. Nice low fat. Also, next time I may try it with more tuna and add 1 cup pasta in place of the pita.

I really could not believe all the great reviews because, after all, it is just tuna salad. Right? Then one day (in the long hot summer months of Florida)I just could not bring myself to cook, and I found this recipe. Fabulous, to say the least! My husband kept asking where the rest of the tuna was, but I just followed the recipe, threw it in a toasted pita with some romaine, and it was great! Try it!
