I absolutely love this cake! I have been making it since it was published in Bon Apetit back in 1998! We recently moved and I had lost the recipe. My mom's 70th birthday is coming and she requested THIS cake. I am so grateful to have found it here. Thank you epicurious! It's definitely a lot of work, but if you follow the instructions it comes out perfect every time. Make sure you use super high quality fresh squeezed orange juice for the best results. Gorgeous and delicious!

I thought this was just okay- and extremely labor intensive. The filling is good (cut out one package of the cream cheese) and frosting also good (reduced the sugar). The cake itself was heavy and too sweet. This same recipe with a fluffy, subtly flavored cake would be 100% better.

This cake is amazing; however, it is very time consuming. I started making this at 1pm and was still working on it at midnight. If you have the time, it's worth it. If possible spread it out over a couple of days since certain things must be chilled. I found that I had too much filling and frosting. You could get by with one less stick of cream cheese on the frosting and one less on the filling. Good luck, it's a big hit with company.

My father gave me some oranges from his citrus tree and I made this recipe for him. I only made two of the cake recipes by using 9"round cake pans instead and split one batter into two cake pans. So it turned out to be a four layered cake. I did have a lot of the filling left over, but that was okay because it was so good to eat on its own that we just ate the orange filling with berries. It was delicious! Everyone loved it and asked for me to make it for them again. Very labor intensive, but worth it.

Awesome. I didn't even expect to like it that much cuz I'm not really an orange person. My cakes sunk a little, but that was probably my fault, and that didn't stop this from tasting AMAZING. i'm totally making this one again.

This cake was our wedding cake. It was superb. My fiance and his sister made the cake over three days, and my sister-in law decorated it. Its labour intensive, but worth it.

Amazing cake! I served this last night at a dinner party and every single guests had seconds. That's a first. I made a few changes which I think might to helpful to share. First I made 1 recipe of the cake but baked it in a 9 inch springform pan and baked it for 35 minutes. I skipped the filling but made the syrup as directed. After the cake and syrup cooled I split the cake(horizonally) with a serrated knife and brushed both cut sides with 1/3 of the orange carmel syrup. Next I decided that there was too much cream cheese in the frosting so I made it with 1 stick of butter, 8 ounces cream cheese,2 cups powdered sugar,4 tablespoons of the reserved carmel surup,1 teaspoon vanilla and 1 teaspoon grated orange rind. This cake served 8 and I still have the syrup leftover to make 2 more cakes!

This cake was absolutely divine, rich, and oh so good. It was made for an office birthday party and all but 1 of the 20 people finished their plate clean (the one doesn't eat cake or sweets, but had 2 bites). Just a warning, it is a very time intensive recipe that I spent about 12 hours on it over 3 nights. Don't be put off by this, I have a smaller kitchen and had to be creative with space. Very worth it!!! Also when I was done, the cake itself weighed about 10 lbs and i took a large hatbox to transport it. Before I moved it, i froze it for the last 1 hour to allow the frosting to get good and hard before taking it outside. ENJOY!!!!

Haven't tried this cake, but a few tips to the cook who had some problems with it. 1) RE: the syrup. It sounds like you had some crystallization. Though brushing down the sides of the pan with water will prohibit crystallization, the brush has to be perfectly clean and there is room for error. There is a better way - cover the pan tightly and briefly to steam down the sides. This can be dangerous if you cover for too long, so just a minute or less. Also, starting with more water can help - the water cooks away anyway, but the sugar dissolves faster, making crystallization less likely. This adds considerable time to the process, however. 2) As for the top of the cake being rounded, that's really not a problem. Lots of caked round on the top, because the pan sides cook the edges faster than the middle. You can buy strips that you soak in water, then wrap around the outside of the pans to decrease this effect, but most professional bakers just trim the top of the cake. Freeze the excess to make crumbs for use making rum balls or other items.

I maade this cake last week and it was a disappointment. The cake came out very heavy and dry. The rest of the componenets turned out fine, except that there was way too much filling and syrup. The frosting was too soft and did not pipe well. Would not make it again.

I loved this cake and the blend of flavors and textures. I also like that it is different from the standard chocolate or vanilla or berry cake that typically makes up a special cake like this. I have made this a couple of times, and it turned out fine for me each time. The only problem I had was not making far enough ahead to let the filling set, so it squished out the sides when I first cut it. (my own fault--not the recipe).

I made some adjustments that helped with the other reviewers problems. I added an extra tablespoon of corn starch to my pastry cream and the filling turned out fine- not too soft. Next time I will leave out one pkg. of cream cheese from the frosting as you only need a thin layer of frosting on this rich and heavy cake. Lastly, try magi-cake strips on your pans to get even cake layers. A delicious cake that easily feeds 35 people- you only need a small piece!

This cake was incredibly delicious. I am an exceptionally good cook, but am only starting my foray into cakes. This being the third cake I have attempted, I struggled a bit: 1) My cakes were too rounded on top after baking - maybe I'm missing a technique here. 2) Making the syrup according to these directions failed completely for me. Everything was going well, then suddenly small pellets of hardened sugar formed in my syrup. This affected the consistency and most likely led to my third problem - the filling. 3) I found the filling to be too difficult to work with. Even after chilling the cake between layers, the filling made it nearly impossible for me to frost it without shifting the layers - the cake was slightly lopsided. Delicious, but too much of a pain to make.

Absolutely fabulous. I made this for Mother's day and again for a June birthday. For the second time around I cut the filling, syrup and frosting in half (with exceptions, see below) and made 2/3 of the cake for 4 9" layers. The frosting is too soft, so I cut the cream cheese from 2 packages to just one and kept the entire stick of butter to give it body, plus added about another cup of powdered sugar. It was just a great tasting frosting, but still difficult to pipe, so I just sprinkled orange cake glitter on it! I also added a teaspoon of orange flavor. I didn't strain out the orange peel for the caramel the second time around and the extra "fiber" was not a bother and gave it more flavor. I didn't have any trouble with the pastry cream, perhaps the other baker measured teaspoons instead of tablespoons. Mine set right up! Enjoy, it's a fabulous cake.

I made this recipe last weekend for no reason at all. I made 2/3 the recipe = 4 layers of 9 inch round pan, half the recipe for the syrup, filling and frosting. The taste is incredible! A total winner. I grated the orange zest rather too deep but it gives a plesant slight bitter taste, just like adding a liquor. The cake layer stay airy and moist for days and we can't get enough of the frosting, too delicious. All I have to complain are: 1. the orange curd filling is way too liquid, I made the curd twice just to make sure that I follow the direction correctly. This made the assembly a bit difficult since the cake layers keep sliding between each other regardless how long I chill the cake. 2. the frosting is too soft, almost impossible to pipe. 3. would definitely cut the amount of sugar in the cake since the syrup, filling and frosting are already sweet.
