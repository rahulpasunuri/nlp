These were really good! My ribs were somewhat fatty, so I didn't have any problems with them drying out. I marinated overnight, but doctored a bottle of Famous Dave's rich & sassy bbq sauce with the bourbon (3/4c), fresh thyme and white pepper instead of making my own. I grilled them for 3 hrs at 250-350F, and basted twice with bbq sauce during the last 30 min of cooking. I will definitely make these again!

These are the best short ribs ever. The sauce is terrific. I did not marinade the ribs as I did not plan far enough in advance. I only used 1-1/2 c of ketchup as other suggested. I browned the ribs on the grill. Then I put them into a covered roasted pan and spooned the sauce on top. I baked them covered at 250 for 1-1/2 hours. Then, I removed the cover and baked for another 1-1/2 hours. Absolutely tender and delicious. Definitely a keeper. Also, we had the leftovers the following day. I removed the solidified fat from the sauce and reheated them. Since they reheat so well this would also be a great do- ahead recipe.

My very first time cooking beef ribs. I followed other recommendations and cooked the ribs in the oven before finishing on the Weber kettle (next time I'll be bold and do the whole time in the kettle). Couldn't find "light" molasses so I used regular. Also used Bud (that's what we had...I know, I know...believe me, I don't drink the stuff). Both the marinade and sauce were very nice. Next time I'll make the sauce with cider vinegar instead of red wine. Used fresh thyme, which I think makes a big difference. Really tasty ribs.

Best ribs flavor ever. But I don't have a bbq, so I tried to cook it in the oven. Took forever and they were kind of tough. I would recommend short ribs instead of the big guys. Seem more tender.

I never made bbq sauce until this recipe and I'm not usually a big fan of that type of taste. BUT....I gotta say it was delicious.....I followed the recipe and used Jim Beam as the bourbon....and used the left over sauce on baked pork chops. Fabulous!

I have made this recipe a few times. I follow the guidelines for less vinegar and more bourbon. I use baby back pork ribs. I have used four racks of ribs, with 2 times the marinade and three times the BBQ sauce. I take the easy way out. I marinate the ribs overnight, and then use my slow cooker for about four hours, in some of the BBQ sauce, three on high, one on low (keep checking) until the ribs are tender and done but not falling completely off the bone and ungrillable. Then I grill bone side down, and baste with BBQ sauce on the meatside, then flip and baste on the bone side so grill marks and caramelization can happen, but not long enough to burn the sauce. I serve with the extra sauce on the side. Huge hit!! And easy!

I like pork ribs best and my husband prefers beef ribs. This recipe is so good I may switch. We had sauce left over and it is equally good on meatloaf.

I made this for my grandson's 3rd birthday with a "dinosaur" theme - these were 'dinosaur bones'!! I used whole beef back ribs (cut into individual ribs), marinated as directed, made the sauce per the recipe then I slathered the sauce on the ribs and baked them in a 450ºF oven for 45 minutes. They turned out fabo! Next time I may just bake them 30 minutes. Everyone seemed to love them and some raved about the sauce and even used the sauce on the chicken legs that I made.

I want more pictures of what this is supposed to look like. Something went terribly wrong. I won't even comment on how it tasted; actually, I was afraid to try it. Visually repugnant. Please send JPG or TIFF files of your best efforts to my email at home. Don't expect any thanks, though.

Man, was the sauce ever good! I used the gas grill and cooked slowly over indirect heat in middle of grill and the meat fell off the bone. I used less ketchup but otherwise did recipe as written. Yum.

I just made the sauce and used it on chopped pork loin roast for sandwiches. It was excellent. I made it exactly as recipe states and I didn't think it tasted too katsupy as someone stated. It had a nice tangy, vinegary sweetnes.

Love it! Made this recipe twice with pork back ribs. Excellent!My husband actually helps out, just so he can drink the sauce.

Terrific! This was the first homemade BBQ sauce I've made, and although (ironically)my favorite was Jack Daniel's original BBQ sauce, I'm never using store bought again. I used 3/4 cup vinegar based on a previous review, and luckily, I read another review mentioned it was too "ketchupy" because I had just enough ketchup for only 1 cup rather than the 2 cups it called for. Blessing in disguise? I too used 3/4 cup JD instead of the water/bourbon ratio.

I made these a few weeks ago, and it was the first time I made ribs where the meat actually fell off the bone! I've made them twice since. Awesome marinade! More often than not, I end up doctoring these recipes (not deserts though) because I don't have all the ingredients on hand. I use the beer, 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of molasses, 1/8 cup honey, 1 TBL maple syrup, 1/2 tsp dried thyme, the salt, some dried bay leaf, black pepper, and a splash of bourbon. I only use 3/4 cup water (why dilute the beer?). I marinade for 1- 2 hours (depending time to dinner), then bake with only half the marinade, covered, on 190 degrees for 1 1/2 - 2 hours. I then BBQ for about 20 minutes. First a minute on high to sear each side, then reduce the flame to low and dip both sides in BBQ sauce. I start with bone side down, then, each time I turn, I dip a side again in the sauce and put on grill, sauce side up. Each side is dipped and put on grill twice, for about 5 minutes. I like the BBQ sauce I buy in the bottle (Mississippi BBQ Sauce - Sweet 'n Mild) so I use that instead of making my own. I'm sure the homemade is better, but I don't have the time. Be careful turning the ribs on the grill, because the meat will really fall of the bone! Soooo good!

These ribs were amazing!! Don't listen to any comments otherwise. I marinated them as per the recipe, broiled them in the oven, 5 minutes per side, then I put all the ingredients together for the sauce, put the sauce and the ribs in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours (high would be 4 hours). They were falling-off-the-bone tender and we ate every single one. My husband and 3 kids enjoyed it so much that I am making a triple batch for a family get together this weekend. If they pleased a 13 month old, a 3 year old, a six year old they are sure to please your family!! Note, though I love fresh herbs, I didn't have any on hand so I had to use dried, it still was very flavourful.

Loved this recipe! I was out of red wine vinegar and had to use apple cider vinegar, did not seem to affect the recipe. Followed previous reviewers suggestion of no water 3/4 c JD. Made extra with some pepper sauce for the spicy lovers in the group!

This has proven to be the end of the quest for the ultimate venison rib preparation. Even my previously squeamish wife loved them. For the adventurous, venison ribs need to be parboiled about 45 minutes in water, worcestershire sauce, onions, and garlic powder or whatever concoction you prefer.

Out of this world. Served this recipe to guests, they all raved & begged for it! It's sweet yet with a little kick. We don't like anything too hot, so this recipe was perfect for us.

This is the third time my husband,Wayne, makes and serves this recipe. What a delicious meal! Everyone loves it. We first tasted these ribs made for us at a cottage in Ontario by a friend who is a very good chef. He has a smoker BBQ (Egg Shape) and slow roasted them all PM. The ribs were fabulous. BUT we decided to do the suggested oven method followed by 15 min on the grill and are very pleased with the results. Many thanks to all of you who made such good suggestions. Wayne uses 3/4 cup of bourbon(JD) instead of adding the 1/4 cup of water. And he also uses only 3/4 cup of vinegar.Have wet cloths beside each plate to wipe those sticky hands on!

I'm in the minority on this one. I made this as written (but did cooked beef short ribs and baby back pork ribs to compare - baked them at 275 for 2 1/2 hours before 10 minutes on the grill) and I thought they were fine. Nothing great. Yes- meat fell off of the bone and was very tender (the pork ribs were the favorite) but the sauce was just okay. I much prefer the cherry cola ribs (recipe on this website) for something truly wonderful.

Made this recipe yesterday because I'm trying to clean out my freezer and had two packages of ribs to cook. I've never, EVER made ribs before so I warned my daughter and fiance that they were going to be my guinea pigs for this recipe. WOW. And WOW again. I marinated them overnight, then put them in the oven on 250 for 2.5 hours, then on the bbq grill (gas) for about 10 more minutes, and they were DIVINE. Fork tender, and the sauce was fabulous. My fiance is still bragging to his co-workers about the meal (ending with Lemon Bars from this site). I was very pleased. I sent all the leftover ribs home with him (there were several), and he ate half for a late-night snack, and the other half for breakfast this morning! He said he couldn't wait for lunch, they were that good. I followed the marinade and sauce recipes to the letter and was so pleased. Thanks to all the reviewers who showed me that I could use my oven, since I don't have a charcoal bbq, just gas.

Followed Lake Forest Park's method of slow cooking in the oven using boneless western style beef ribs. The meat was incredible tender, to the point where it was almost difficult to get it off the grill. The sauce was delicious, although I would cut back on the vinegar next time. I used Wild Turkey bourbon, and the flavor really came through.

Made this recipe with one batch of beef spare ribs and one batch of beef back ribs. The sauce is great. The ribs came out very delicious as well, but the spare ribs were better mainly because I trimmed the fat off of them. I followed the recipe, and I would highly recommend it -- the flavor and taste is definitely there, its just a matter of how fatty your ribs are.

I made only the BBQ sauce from this recipe, as I was looking for a new sauce to make. It was good; I liked the bourbon and molasses combo, but I felt that there was too much ketchup. It really just tasted too ketchup-y for my taste. I have a ton left over, and plan to add some mustard powder and maybe some soy sauce and see what that does to it. It is good, though, but next time, less ketchup.

I made this recipe for a Super Bowl party and it's the only way I'll make ribs from now on. I used beef and pork ribs (which were the favorites) and marinated them overnight and cooked them for 3 hrs. at 250. I then put the sauce on and reheated them on the grill for about 15-20 minutes. So moist, flavorful and delicious!

Great sauce however, cooked the ribs in the oven, although tender, not that great.

This was deeeeelicious!! Instead of marinating and then following the grilling process, I marinated for 3 hours and then slow-cooked the ribs in a the oven at 275 degrees for 2 1/2 hours. Then I put the ribs on a sheet pan and put the barbecue sauce on top and broiled them for about 5-8 minutes. My guests could not stop complimenting how succulent, tender, and flavorful they were. Definitely a keeper!

WOW! I really can not say enough good things about this recipe. It is fantastic. Because of our busy schedules, my husband I only marinade for about 30 min. and then cook the ribs on the grill with the sauce. I can not imagine the ribs being any more tasty.

Great recipe. I use a gas grill so roast it with rub in foil at 250 degrees for two hours then grill with sauce. Can adjust hot sauce--I make two batches, one with 1 Tbsp regular hot sauce; for the other half I substitute habanero pepper sauce.

I haven't rated a recipe a 4 yet, but this is the closest I have come. Great flavor. I used whisky (JD) instead of true bourbon. I cooked the ribs covered in a roasting pan for 2 1/2 hours at 275, then finished them on the grill with the sauce. Serve with risotto con parmigiano-reggiano from this site.

While courting my girlfriend, I made this dish and invited her over..We both loved this dish the sauce makes it..I have also made pork ribs with this recipe and it was great as well

This dish is a solid hit with everyone who has tasted it! It works just as well (and is much easier) to bake the ribs in the marinade or sauce for a few hours in the oven on low, in a baking bag or covered roasting pan, and then barbeque with sauce after. The ribs come out super tender. Flavor from charcoal grilling unanimously voted superior to gas grilling.

Oh sauce divine! Oh ribs divine! Recipe is good as is.

The sauce and marinade were wonderful - in fact, I reduced the marinade after the meat went on the grill, added it to the sauce, and basted the meat with the new combined sauce. I found that grilling, even with indirect, low heat, dried the meat. The flavor was wonderful, but the texture was not. I'll definitely make it again, but in the oven, where I can control the temperature and moisture.

This is an outstanding recipe. Don't be scared away by the laborious grilling process. I did the marinade and the bbq sauce, and then grilled as usual on my gas grill (i.e., throw it on a searing hot grill, flip, remove when done). The marinade is key, and do it overnight. I've done it a few times this summer - with both steaks and ribs - and it is outstanding. Enjoy!
