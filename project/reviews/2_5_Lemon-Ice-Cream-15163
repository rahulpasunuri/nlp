I added 4 egg yolks,2 tsp of cornstarch, 1 tsp of lemon extract, 1/2 cup of evaporated milk, reduced the heavy cream by 1/2 cup and made a custard first. Obviously, it's no longer the same recipe, but it was to die for. I mixed the cornstarch with the sugar, added the zest and lemon juice then whisked in the milk over medium heat. Let that scald, then tempered the egg yolks, whisked them into the milk mixture and let it thicken over medium low heat (don't boil! only heat to about 180). Stirred in the lemon extract, evaporated milk and cream. (I was afraid that all that lemon juice would break the custard, which is why I added cornstarch. Besides, cornstarch and evaporated milk vastly improve the texture of ice cream.) I then chilled in an ice bath, then refrigerated until quite cold. The way this recipe is written, unless you have an ice cream maker that doesn't require a frozen bowl, it's not going to freeze well. I'm betting the positive review came from someone with a White Mountain freezer. The way my ice cream came out, it deserved 4 forks, but again, it's no longer the same recipe.

Yum, Yum, Yum! We made this for the 4th of July and it was delicious. We made 1 1/2 recipes but did not increase the sugar. I would definitely do the same again. Rave reviews from all in attendance.

The ice cream mixture wouldn't freeze or even thicken, and I am wondering if it needs eggs.
