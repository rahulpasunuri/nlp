Well didn't quite know how to rate this recipe. My guests and family loved it and ate it all up. I could not get past 2 spoonfuls, it was just too sweet and rich for me. So I would have put 1 fork, but guest and family voted me down, ergo the 3 forks.

Made my first ever creme caramel using this recipe. It was a huge hit and absolutely delicious and gorgeous. My family and friends raved about it. I added a little lemon juice to the caramel, used 18% cream and whole milk instead of whipping cream, and it turned out extremely beautiful and simply fell out of the ramekin on to a plate. A wonderful recipe and a definite keeper for years to come.

Very nice dessert however much creamier than the traditional creme caramel texture, closer to a creme brulee. Everyone enjoyed it and requested the recipe. Will make it again but will substitute some of the whipping cream for whole milk next time.

Very good creme caramel. I lessened maple syrup by half, and added a little lemon to the caramel (great tip, thanks!). I had very good results. My guests all loved it and wanted seconds. This is a keeper. Thanks.

This was very tasty though I found it cloyingly sweet. I couldn't get the caramel to swirl around after buttering the dishes - not sure if I did something wrong. I also had enough to do 6 custards and had extra caramel that I turned into candy for the kids.

This recipe has consistently been a big hit with guests. It is very easy, can be made a day ahead and everyone always gushes. Highly recommend it.

Fantastic by all means ... the tip of using a bit of lemon juice while making the caramel is excellent .. also you can just leave the caramel alone while it's doing its thing .. try to resist the tempation of stirring it because stirring promotes crystalization of sugar.

Flawless. Taking the reviewer from Canada's advice I did add some lemon juice to the caramel and it did help enormously. The caramel is always the hard part for me - no matter how many minutes any recipe specifies I find that the only way to do it is to watch it like a hawk once it starts getting a little color, and take it off before it hits "deep amber" to prevent from too hard a caramel forming/burning. The flavouring is perfect, though I used about 2/3 of the maple syrup due to my family's distaste for overly sweet desserts. I also used half-and half(15% fat cream) instead of the milk/cream mixture.

There's a restaurant in the vicinity that makes the most divine Creme Caramel and I never thought I could come close to it until now. So lucious and creamy, the maple flavoring is delicate and even with the caramel, it does not veer into the too sweet category. This is now my all- time favorite dessert.

This is a great recipe that doesn't take a lot of ingredients. I always add a very small amount of lemon juice when making my caramel. This doesn't change the flavour and keeps the sugar from crystalizing.

This is a delicious easy way to wow your dinner guests. Maple is just the right flavor to complement the creme caramel.

Here are the little things I do to make creme caramel (or any custard) go easier. I don't butter the ramekins because you can't get the caramel to stick to the sides if you do, esp. once it starts to cool even a little. I also use a ladle to fill the ramekins with custard mixture. I pull the rack out of the oven and then I transfer the filled ramekins in the baking dish to the oven w/o the water in the baking dish. Then I use a tea kettle to fill the dish with water, so I don't slop water into the custards while putting them into the oven. Then I cover the dishes with foil and carefully slide the rack back into the oven. When finished baking I don't remove the baking dish from the oven when custards are done; I only take out the ramekins. I Wait until the water is cooled and then remove the baking dish. This eliminates the risk of splashing boiling water into the custards or onto my toes. To get the last of the caramel out of the ramekins after the custards have been served I soak them in water for a few hours. The sugar simply dissolves away.

This dessert is spectacular and easy. The maple flavor doesn't overpower the dish, but it works beautifully with the caramel sauce. The texture and mouth-feel are fabulous. Rich, but worth it.

Easy to make and a real crowd-pleaser. It is such an elegant dessert to serve after a big dinner and wonderful because you can make it the day before. The first time I made it I worried that the center was not "set" after 55 minutes so I left some of the ramekins in 15 min longer. Too long! They tasted eggy. The ramekins I took out after 55 minutes eventually "set" as they cooled and they tasted great. An overnight soak made clean-up very easy in the dishwasher.

It is impossible not to succeed with this dessert. So easy to be made and such a delicious result.

Simply delicious and so easy. Maple syrup adds a great dimension to the original version. My only problem: some caramel got stuck to the bottom of the custard cups and was fairly difficult to remove.

Fabulous! So decadent, rich, flavorful, and creamy! I add a teaspoon vanilla extract in the custard, and that really seals the deal for us. The only thing I change is to use 2/3 cup sugar instead of 1 full cup on the caramel. It's a little too sweet otherwise.

Creamy and absolutely delicious. Easy to make,too. My friend gave me a good tip to help cool these off faster - fill the water bath dish with ice cubes after steaming.

This was my first time making creme caramel... made it for a family b-day party and it was devoured... even by the kids! Didn't have ramekins so I just used coffee mugs and it worked great! Looked wonderful and the taste was to die!

Ever since I got this recipe, I've made it three times in just three weeks. My mother loves creme caramel, and this is the best she's had so far. She has requested that I make this for Christmas. It's easy to make. The only thing that takes long is the caramel, but it's worth it.

Hello from Australia. This recipe is beautiful, though part of the toffee stuck to the base of the cup, so it was a little crunchy, but lovely!!

I made this dessert when it first came out in the Bon Appetite. It caught my eye because I had just moved to Vermont and was interested in different ways to use Maple Syrup in recipes. Even though I no longer live in Vermont I have made it 5 or 6 times since and it has come out delicious every time!

I have been making creme caramel for many years. This one turns out perfectly each time. One suggestion, instead of the sugar syrup, try reducing 1 cup of maple syrup for about 10 minutes. If you love the flavor of maple as we do, it will be great!

This is a really nice light dessert. My only complaint was that I did not cook the caramel long enough (maybe 3-5 minutes more). Otherwise, I got rave reviews. Definately a keeper!
