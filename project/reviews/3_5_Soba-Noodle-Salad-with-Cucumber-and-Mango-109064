My husband and I LOVED this dish. I didn't have any jalapeno or serrano peppers in house so I used about a teaspoon of siracha instead. It turned out awesome! I also used only about 6 ounces soba noodles and less than half of the prepared sauce. My own special addition was some sauteed pineapple chicken sausage I had. It was amazingly delicious.

This recipe was a good starting point, but a few things would make it MUCH better. First, it does state that it makes 12 servings - something I failed to notice until I saw the huge mound of noodles I cooked! Second, the dressing is delicious, but double it (or use half the amount of noodles) as it soaks in rather quickly. 1 cuke and 1 mango are not nearly enough for 12 oz. of noodles. Mint and cilantro are a better combination of herbs for this dish. If you want more heat, use 2 chiles and do not seed them. I added shrimp sauteed with garlic and ginger to make it into a main course salad. Sprinkle with black sesame seeds for an elegant presentation.

I made this dish for a potluck dinner and it was a real success. The sauce was absolutely delicious: sweet and sour, mildly spicy, subtle, yet tangy and unusual. I used basil and cilantro, but no mint. The cucumber and mango added a lovely, light and cooling taste, and the peanuts were a crunchy counterpart. This recipe is a real keeper.

This is a great cold noodle dish! The only substitution I made was to use cilantro in place of basil and left out the chile because I was feeding it to my toddler. I also cut the soba noodles in half so they would not be too long and difficult to maneuver with a fork. The sugar makes it pretty sweet, but I loved it, and so did my toddler!

Great recipe! It was delicious freshly made and even better the next day. I made it with cilantro and parsley as those flavors are preferred in my house over basil and mint. Do make sure to add the chopped peanuts--it makes this even better.

I thought this was excellent, and a great side dish for Asian fare. I used cilantro and basil for the herbs, doubled the mango, and added a little soy and some extra sugar after I tasted it as written. The chopped peanuts are a must. It was a great alongside sushi and teriyaki beef tenderloin. It is fresh and light, and really tasty.

My sister made this for a large family dinner and I loved it. I made it myself for a lunch gathering to rave reviews. I found no issue with the amount of vinegar and I did add some red bell pepper. A great hot summer dish.

Meh...nothing special. I made the recipe as stated, except I didn't have an peanuts so I added a little salt. Flavors were nice together, but if I ever make it again I will replace the basil with cilantro, add more garlic, maybe some black sesame seed , cut back on the rice vinegar and add some mirin.

This was so easy and fast and everyone loved it. I also did not find the portions 'huge' as one or two others have suggested. If you're willing to vary: I reduced the vinegar, added red pepper, substituted cilantro for basil, and skipped the garlic.

I had no problem with the vinegar level in this recipe - despite the many complaints by others. However, three comments: 1. This is a LARGE quantity recipe. Unless you're having company cut the entire thing in half. 2. Not enough mango. 3. Better with add'l spice. (I added some red pepper flakes.) Finally, my recommendation is to simply cut the noodles and vinegar in half and then you'll have sufficent mango and cukes and a more manageable quantity. Delicious and simple to make.

I made the recipe and didn't change anything. It was a big hit with my friends. I love the southeast asian flavors.

At first I thought this recipe was missing something savory. I added both soy sauce and chili sauce before realizing that the recipe has too much in it to begin with. Too much tangy lime, too much tangy vinegar, and then a strange blend of herbs. You can't concentrate on anything but the acids, which makes it almost sweet and weakens the heft of the soba. I was pretty disappointed as I was really looking forward to a nice light cold noodle salad that might keep for lunch for a few days. I'll try again with a different sauce.

Excellent recipe. I have made this without any adjustments for guests young and old several times and it has been a hit with everyone.

I didn't care for this recipe and would not make it again. I even took advice from an earlier review and put in less vinegar. Not one of my faves -

This dish offers a great combination of flavors. Following previous comments, I added a red bell pepper cut to strips, and a second mango, which together I think add a lot. A minor complaint was that it was a bit hard to maneuver the noodles and some of the fruit into my mouth on the same forkful; the noodles keep crowding out the fruit. For that reason I will reduce the fraction of noodles next time and break them into shorter pieces before cooking.

I wish I had read the other reviews about the vinegar. There was too much of something in this recipe. I will try it again w/less vinegar.

This was a delicious dish. Full of flavor and very fresh tasting. I followed the recipe with the exception of cutting the vinegar in half, as recommended in the other reviews.

I thought this dish was easy and it tasted pretty good, but I'm not going to rush to make it again. I made it for an Asian-themed dinner party, and all my guests thought it was good - they especially enjoyed the combination of flavors and textures that the cukes and mangoes created. It was even good as leftovers the next day. I'm glad I tried it, I'm happy with the results but I'm not waking up in the middle of the night raving about it.

Delish! Nice combination of flavors, a big hit at our bbq w. Asian flair. Only downside is it's a bit time consuming to make.

I liked the combination of the mango in the noodles with the cucumbers and nuts. It was light and delicious. I added chicken to make it a main meal. Make a double batch as it is wonderful the next day right out of the frig. It was a little time consuming to prepare.

I served this with Teriyaki chicken for Memorial Day and everyone liked it. As previously suggested, I used 1/2 cup of rice vinegar and 1/4 cup of Mirin to cut down the acidity. I substituted green onions for the mint and added red bell pepper strips for color. Next time I make it, I will chop the basil more finely. Other than that, loved it!

Made this for a meeting and everyone loved it. Left out the mint and used 2 mangos, but otherwise made it exactly as called for. This one's a keeper!

This was really tasty--I used half a cup of rice vinegar and 1/4 cup mirin instead of the full vinegar and it was just perfect.

This reciepe rocks, however, I omitted the basil and mint. I added soba sauce and cilantro. Next time I will add more fresh chopped lime zest. Moreover, it is an awesome main coarse, just add some seared tuna as a source of protein.

Good light receipe. Perfect for a summer meal. The missing ingrediant here is soy sauce. I omitted the salt and replaced with soy sauce. Also increased the sesame oil. Tasted fabulous. Great for a side dish but when I want to serve as a main course, I add sesame crusted pan seared Ahi Tuna. Perfect main course. My food and wine dinner group loved it.

This was a nice lunch salad-- I added some thinly sliced red bell pepper and simmered tofu to make it a bit more filling. Having read another reviewer's complaint that the vinegar was too strong, I reduced it to 1/2 cup, but actually didn't taste it at all. Maybe some brands of rice vinegar are stronger than others? I might make this again in summer-- it seems like more of a warm weather dish.

This is a delicious, refreshing noodle salad. My guests loved it! I do wish that I had doubled the mango; my one large mango was not enoughto balance out the cucumber. My changes: I added more sesame oil and salt, I used about 2/3 the mint called for, and I only used 1/2 cup of crushed peanuts. It was a lovely salad, and I will make it again.

The mix of flavors was good, but everything was overpowered by the vinegar, even when I added a little more sugar. I couldn't eat the leftovers the next day because of the acidity.
