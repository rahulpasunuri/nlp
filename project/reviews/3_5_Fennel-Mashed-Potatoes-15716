Served this recently at party and even friends who claimed they hate fennel, raved about these. Very easy to make too!

I have made this recipe many times and it is absolutely delicious as well as being easy. This year it will be part of my Christmas dinner.

This was quite delicious and pretty quick to prepare. Roast garlic is a nice addition, I added 4 cloves - just about enough as you don't want to overpower the fennel flavour. I also added about 2 tbsp. of butter because it didn't seem quite creamy enough.
