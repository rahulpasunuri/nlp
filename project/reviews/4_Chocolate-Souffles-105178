Absoluetly the best. I have made it many many times and never had it not turn out excellent. Get requests to make this over and over again. Beware that this is a very rich dessert. I rarely order souffle while dining out because they usually do not compare to this one.

This was terrible! Where is the milk, the egg whites, the cream? Souffle's are supposed to be light and airy. This recipe made hockey pucks. Never again!

Good. Mine started to crack within minutes in the oven, and the top was quite dry and crumbly, even after only 15 minutes cooking time. Inside was deliciously moist, though. Overall ok - will try other recipes before deciding which to keep

A winner. I've tried a few souffle recipes on this site and this is the best and easiest. Making it ahead works fine.

Rave reviews from everyone on this recipe - from my 3 year old to all of the adults! I combined several of the recommendations from other reviewers and it turned out great. I used butter and sugar (not flour) to coat the 6-oz custard cups. I used a 3.5 oz chopped Bittersweet Toblerone bar and then semisweet for the remaining chocolate. I beat all of the egg whites first by themselves at medium speed until soft peaks formed, then added the sugar gradually and beat at high speed until stiffer peaks formed. I also added 1 tsp vanilla extract at the end. I refrigerated for several hours before baking. They didn't start to puff up until the very end of baking, so be patient. I cooked them about 17-18 minutes, and although they didn't puff quite as much as I thought they would, it didn't matter - they tasted wonderful! I inverted them onto plates and topped with Creme Anglais sauce. The inside was still perfectly molten. It was a hit!!!

This was sinfully delicious. Made the soufflés ahead of time and when ready for coffee just popped them in the oven and voila. Guests raved. Definitely a keeper for those days when you need spoiling.

This is an excellent recipe and got rave reviews when I made it for guests. The molten centre and cracked crust is perfect. I unfortunately used larger individual ramekins than specified, which I wouldn't reccommend to other cooks. My guests and I loved it but we couldn't finish it all after a large meal because it is such a rich dessert.

I made this for my family to test it out, and they loved it. I was very pleased with the results, and saved some to bake a few hours later. The only complaint that I have is that when prepared ahead, it did not work as well. Wonderful if made right before serving.

good recipe--but i made it great. i cut the sugar and flour in half and used callebaut belgian bittersweet chocolate. you can get it at PCC in in seattle. i also made a nice sauce with melted ben & jerry's vanilla ice cream and a little grand marnier mixed in--kinda creme anglais (shut up i'm not french and their words don't make sence to spell anyway).

This was my first time making chocolate souffles and I received rave reviews! One of my friends said that the souffle tasted as good as at a restaurant... The recipe was really easy and I will definitely make again! I didn't have enough of one kind of chocolate, so I used half semi-sweet chocolate chips and half semi-sweet Baker's chocolate.

I made this twice. The first time I baked them right after I got them out of the mixer for 18 minutes and the top cracked and the side was a bit burnt. It was rich and dense, but the taste was great, especially eaten hot with ice cream. The second time I put them in the fridge overnight, then put them into the oven right away for 16 minutes. The center was molten, and it was the best molten chocolate cake I've ever had. I served them with vanilla bean creme anglaise instead of ice cream this time, and I got rave reviews. =D Great recipe, but definitely not the airy souffle I had expected.

Rating: 3
Very tasty souffle. I liked the consistency in the center of the souffle - it was super moist and velvety. The top was subperb as well - ridden with deep cracks, but underneath was the smoothest souffle ever. I would recommend serving with a simple raspberry coulis and some Taittinger champagne. Very nice!

My first time trying to make souffles - truly, it's wonderfully easy! A perfect, basic recipe that easily allows for additions you may want to try. I made fresh whipped cream, and placed it on top with a dusting of cocoa - wonderful presentation! Raspberries would make a great compliment as well.

Despite my timer stopping in the middle of baking making the souffles a tad burnt, they were delicious. My souffles did not rise nicely though. Worth trying again.

35 year old Dad of 4 just made for wifes birthday, and all loved it! Just a lot of dirty dishes after, but definately worth it. dont have to crush chocalates so much. They melted just fine with the chunks I had.

This was restaurant quality dessert at it's best. I didn't have enough ramekins and used a casserole dish that worked fine.

This is an excellent souffle! The only thing that I did differently was to increase the chocolate and next time I will actually line the cups so that the dish can be removed before serving. Chocolate souffle has been one of my son's favorite dishes in the past, and he said this is better than any other recipe that I have made! Enjoy!

A wonderfully easy, excellent desert. I've been a fan of the molten chocolate cake on Epicurous as a wonderful desert. These on is just as good if not better with a fraction of the butter used in that recipe.

My first attempt at souffles. I picked this recipe for it's do-ahead ability. I cut the recipe in half as there is just two of us, and it worked. I didn't check the souffles until the timer went off, and I think I overbaked just a bit, as the center wasn't as soft as I like it. So check a few minutes before the end, as ovens do vary. I had a bar of very dark chocolate & a bar of milk chocolate and used some of each. I served it with Creme Anglaise from this website, yum! This recipe is a keeper.

Bring egg whites to soft peaks separately. Then fold in with egg yokes according to the recipe. Creates a much more creamy center. Friends and family LOVED it. My son said that we should have this for dessert every Sunday.

I really like this recipe. I have made chocolate soufles in a cooking class and the technique was a little different (beating the egg yolks and whites separately.) I love both results, as this recipe yields a "richer" dessert and the other a "lighter" one.

Want to make this, but(if you freeze them) are you supposed to thaw them before toy bake them? I can't wait to try

Delicious and easy to make. Being able to freeze them for a week, makes them a tasty essential for dinner parties.

Absolutely to die for!!! I am famous for this dish. I have people asking me to make it for dessert all the time! The trick to getting them fluffy and rise high when you bakethem is when you are beating the egg whites with sugar mixture for a long time until they are very ribbony.

It's amazingly easy. Everyone loved it. Almost perfect. I suggest reducing the ammount of flour to 1/2cup. Great recipe!!!

RuthinNY got me hooked on these, now they're the life of every gathering and I get requests to make them for birthdays and holidays... so much so to the point that I got ramekins for Xmas this year. If you aren't getting the right amount out of the recipe, you aren't beating the pre-choklit mixture enough. Otherwise, they're perfect.

I made this for the first time 12-31-02, My guest were totally impressed. I followed the recipe and was happy with the ease of the preperation. I cooked it in a convection oven and only cooked it for 14 mins it was perfect in the middle.

This dessert has been dubbed the choco-gasm by friends and family alike. It's so easy and unbelievably delicious. I make a warm vanilla custard sauce to go with it. If you don't have ramekins 4oz or 6oz Pyrex cups work just as well (they just don't look as lovely). Make sure you thoroughly butter and flour whatever you use.

Rating: 4
This recipe is very easy. For a twist after filling the ramekins half way with souffle mix, take raspberry puree and chocolate 1/4 cup each (heat over water the same way as the recipe)add a teaspoon to center then fill rest with souffle mix. It is a great moist center that will bring smiles to the table.

The best dessert!!! Great when you need to make things ahead of time. They bake fast so be careful not to overbake--the best is when they are still gooey on the inside. Definitely serve with vanilla ice cream. Must try!!!!!

Very rich and brownie-like. I paired them with a small scoop of Starbucks' "Cafe Latte" ice cream, and that was a great combination. I'll make these again!

We couldn't believe how good this was! and not tough at all. I mixed bittersweet and semi-sweet Ghiradelli and it was incredibly good.

Oh my! These were heavenly and so easy! My guests inhaled them. I cooked them for 18 minutes, and they still had a very soft center...perfection. I used 4 oz. of semisweet and 1oz. of unsweetened b/c that's all I had on hand and it was fine. I served with 3 mini scoops of ice cream and garnished with mint. My new company dessert...

Rating: 4
This was delicious, impressive, easy to make and a make ahead dessert - a pretty unbeatable combination. I only let the souffles bake for 15 minutes, not 19 and perhaps would check a minute or two earlier next time. Vanilla ice cream or whipped cream is really a must, as the souffles themselves are quite rich. Besides, I really enjoy the hot/cold combination. A definite keeper.

This was a delicious chocolate truffle cake recipie...was well enjoyed however if you are looking for a light, fluffy souffle recipie this is not the one for you. Was more brownie/cakelike. Delicious!!!

A simple recipe that turns out perfectly and tastes great! Stick with the 3/4 cup (6 oz.) ramekins - I used 9 oz., and it was too much. Would also be great served with raspberry coulis or real whipped cream. Highly recommend - your guests will be impressed.

I used Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate, and this was outstanding. This is deceptively easy, and the presentation is impressive. I halved the recipe with no problems. The only comment is that the souffle only puffs up an inch or so. I've seen others with bigger 'puff' that make an even better presentation.

Fabulous recipe. Some suggestions - add a teaspoon of vanilla and/or a little of your favorite liqueur. In my oven, they are finished in about 15 minutes, not 18 minutes.

I served these souffles with vanilla ice-cream on the side at a recent dinner party. Everyone loved them - but the ice-cream was a critical component to the success of the souffles. Everyone liked the hot/cold combination, and the ice-cream tempered the very rich, very chocolaty souffles. This recipe will go into my permanent repertoire of favorite desserts for company.

Many raves...Very sophistated diners told me "the best dessert they hv ever had"...I did not have the 3/4 cup and used the l l/2 cup dish...Was too much for one person. I used a cherry brandy sauce over the top...however, i believe this dish stands on its own. Will purchase smaller dishes and try again...Wonderful....I prepared this dish l week ahead of time and placed in freezer. Was still wonderful...I was hesitant...don t be...

The first time I tasted this recipie was at a dinner party. My friend had made them beforehand and took them out about 1/2 before ready to bake. They were incredible! I had always been hesitant to make souffles due to all the prep. To know that you can prepare ahead and freeze and they still taste wonderful has made me a believer that I CAN be successful with this dessert. The presentation alone will impress your guests.

The flavor was wonderful. I made the mistake of removing them from the oven too soon (I only had 1/2 cup ramekins) so I am anxious to try it again. The recipe was so simple and I love the fact that they can be made ahead and "popped" in the oven a few minutes before you're ready for dessert.
