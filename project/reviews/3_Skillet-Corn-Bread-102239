Thank you mrbillo5 for all of your calculations and "buttermilk" info, because I used them both. I really enjoyed this cornbread! I must have checked the recipe 20 times because I kept wanting to add sugar or honey to the recipe, but it isn't a super-sweet cornbread. But you know what? It was great without it! Mine turned out a little eggy. Not sure if I did something to cause that, but it was a little custardy, but I kinda liked it :) So I docked a fork for that and because it didn't come out of the pan all the way together :( But it went great with chili, will probably give it another shot in the future.

Made this cornbread to go with chili and it was very tasty! Easy recipe ... honey tasted good with it too.

10 year old fantastic simple corn bread recipe. A note - a good heavy aluminum anodized skillet (but *NOT* non-stick) will also work ok. And a passable substitute for the buttermilk is 1 3/4 cup tepid milk, add 5 tsp lemon juice, let stand for 5 minutes to curdle. This has the right texture and acid for the recipe. AND.... A couple of years ago somebody asked about adapting this recipe to a 12" skillet. Reminds me of the old math pun. Pie are round. Cornbread are square. So, the volume taken up by the 9" diameter (4.5" radius) skillet is : pi*(4.5*4.5)*h. And the volume taken up by the 12" diameter (6" radius) skillet is pi*(6*6)*h. The ratio of the two is just (6*6)/(4.5*4.5) = 36/20 which is just under two. So, double the recipe for a 12" skillet, and you won't end up with a cornbread cracker.

This is the perfect traditional simple corn bread. I love it with a large drizzle of honey. The trick of melting the butter in the skillet makes it perfectly crunchy on the outside and savory. (Definitely make sure you're using unsalted butter, otherwise it will be a little too salty.)

This is a definate staple in our home.

I've been making this recipe for around a year now and my family loves it. It's crisp enough on the outside and crumbly, as well. My children love it with a thin layer of local honey.

OK, not great buy any means. Very salty, even with only 1/2 tsp

I prefer a sweeter corn bread. Though, I might get used to this, more authentic, corn bread. I will try it again, but with a bit of maple syrup, sugar or honey.

How would I adapt this recipe for a 12 inch cast iron skillet? I'm afraid it'll be way too dry and thin if I make it as is.

Sorry, not for us. Very dense and (in my opinion anyway) lacking flavor (which was surprising).

This was just the recipe I was looking for. An authentic southern (not yankee) corn bread. Perfect with our chile beans. The skillet is good for the corn bread and the corn bread is good for the skillet. I happened to have a stick of unsalted butter (which I usually don't have) and it's just perfect. I didn't have any buttermilk on hand so mixed a cup of milk with 3/4 cup plain yogurt. This is now a big part of one of our favorite dinners!

This is AUTHENTIC cornbread. I am from Nashville, Tn. and learned from my mother over 50yrs. ago to make corn bread this way with one exception... bacon drippings. In those days when you bought your large salt and pepper shakers to set on the stove, the set came with a "pot" which had a strainer in the top and a lid, marked GREASE. This was to save your bacon drippings in, and after you fried any meat you poured the drippings into the pot. Useing bacon drippings instead of butter in this recipe will make it perfect. Heat the drippings in the skillet then add it to your batter. Yummm! Joy

This recipe is great--I've made the recipe as is, and it is my favorite cornbread. Today, however, I made the following changes: 1) Used 1/2 cup olive oil in place of butter 2) Used the buttermilk powder/water in place of regular buttermilk 3) Egg beaters in place of eggs 4) Added 1/2 to 1 cup cheddar cheese to batter 5) Added 3 large red jalapenos to batter These 5 changes yielded the best corn bread I've ever made.

If you like a sweet rather than savory corn bread, this isn't the recipe for you. We made it to go with chili and it was absolutely perfect. I used salted butter, because that is what I had, but I think I would get some unsalted for the next go-round.

I think the previous reviewers hit the nail on the head - this is not a sweet cornbread. It is however, an excellent adjunct to spicy or rich food. I also eat it as a breakfast food with a little jam! Yum.

I don't know what I did wrong, but even after 25 minutes, it was getting very brown on top, and was still semi-solid cornmeal mush inside after cooling. I'm a big fan of corn bread made of mostly or all cornmeal, so I had high hopes. What I ate of it didn't taste bad, but it wasn't great, either.

Was a littlr too dry also needs a little more flavor.

Pretty standard, but very good. I use this as an accompaniment to chili. It's also good on its own.

If you like a sweet corn bread, this isn't your recipe. I loved it; so did my husband. The honey butter is great, but the bread is good even without it. Try it.

This is absolutely delicious. All my dinner guests called raving about it. Do make the butter to go with it

Great recipe. Has a wonderful corn flavor. If you like sweet corn bread - try a different recipe. The honey butter is a terrific additive.

This is my absolute favorite corn bread on the planet. As a former employee of Zinfandel restaurant where this recipe originated, I think I ate the cornbread everyday--seriously addictive stuff. The icing on the cake, so to speak, is the buckwheat honey butter which is an excellent spread for most kinds of bread. I like to add a little maple to the butter when I make it at home. This success of this recipe hinges on using a cast iron skillet, so if you don't have one this is an excellent excuse to get one. Enjoy!

I am not allowed to make any other corn bread recipe other than this one in my house (nor can I add anything to it). The kids request it often and the neighbors come over when they know I am making it. Husband eats it covered in butter and honey right out of the oven and it never lasts more than 15 minutes. I dont dare change a thing

I like a little sweetness in cornbread, so I think I'll add some sugar next time I make it. A little dry, but I like it that way. The skillet browns the bottom and sides of the bread nicely.

Didnt find it too salty, but a little bland. Maybe next time I will mix in corn or hot peppers.

Rating: 0
Everyone who rated this recipe complained about it being too salty. What I don't understand is why you would want to counter balance the salt by adding sugar? Why not just simply cut back on the salt?

Terrific method for making tender corn bread with a crisp crust. I like sweet cornbread - a quarter cup of sugar did the trick. I also included a small can of diced green chiles which were great (fresh roasted poblanos would be even better!).

The cornbread has a nice mellow flavor but a bit to salty for my liking. I will definitly next time add some sugar to balance the saltiness. Still a great accomp. for bbq's and chili.

This is a very cool recipe! And great for folks on a wheat free diet. But I found it a bit bland. To appease my sweet tooth, I made it again. But this time I added 1/3 cup sugar and a cup of blueberries. Fantastic!

i just got a new sectioned corn bread pan, so I've been experimenting with different recipes. This one is the best by far! The elimination of flour and sugar makes for a dense and somewhat crunchy texture. It's great with the honey butter or split and topped with a ragout or a creamy mushroom sauce.

This recipie is very good. It was fun baking in a cast iron skillet just like my grandmother does! The recipie says to use unsalted butter, definitely heed this advice. I only had salted on hand and it came out way to salty. If using salted butter decrease the amount of salt used.

Made it in my calphalon everyday pan in a convection oven - delicious, with a golden crust and moist interior.

Good cornbread. Better than any other recipe I've tried, probably because of the cast iron skillet cooking method. Best served warm.
