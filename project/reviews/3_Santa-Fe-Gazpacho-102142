A very good Gazpacho recipe. I've tried some others before and this is definitely one I'll make again. I made this on a hot summer day for people who hadn't every tried gazpacho before and it was a hit.

Very good gazpacho - my first try at it and this one is excellant. I cut the chiles in half and the bite is just right for my taste. The 'web' version is a bit different from the print version - the web version leaves out the bell pepper ingredient and towards the end, mentions to add a cup of broth when all you have left is 3/4 of a cup. All in all a very good recipe.

I tried this Gazpacho recipe and refuse to try others. It is really very good and very easy. Take heed from the other reviewer though, and be cautious when you add the chipotle peppers. I love spicy foods and usually increase the amount of kick to a recipe, but follow this one to the letter or even decrease the peppers a bit.

Though I am a fan of spicy foods, I was unpleasantly surprised at how hot this recipe is. Otherwise, it is a decent dish
