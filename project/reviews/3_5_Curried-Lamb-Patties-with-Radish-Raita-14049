Lamb was good and I will definitely make again. Made recipe exactly as written, thought it needed some spicing up though. Did not enjoy the raita - tasted too bland. Needs mint and a little garlic,

Loved it-- didn't have mango chutney but used peach preserves and a bit of vinegar. Used fresh mint in the burgers as well as the other ingredients called for. Caramelized the rest of the red onion and some fennel I had as a side dish. Kids and adults were both happy!

What a tasty recipe! I always read the reviews and take some of the advice if I don't have all the ingedients on hand, but did need to use up a 1/2 pound of ground lamb. Used garam masala, ground coriander and madras curry powder; shallot instead of the red onion (I know. I shouldn't even be reviewing THIS recipe).....but it was really great with the lamb! Made a variation on the riata too. Will definitely fix this for company soon!

This was a fast, easy Indian recipe for lamb that I would definitely use again. (Although the spices are tamer than a typical Indian dish. I might try it next time with some Garam Masala.) However, if you are not a fan of sweet meat dishes, (like my spouse) you could opt to leave out the mango chutney.

I had a surplus of watermelon radishes and this was the perfect way to use them. I didn't make the lamb patties but I will next time - sounds delicious.

Made this several times - tasty and forgiving. Use curry powder if you don't have the separate spices -- I bump up the chutney (be careful not to scorch the burgers, though), add some minced jalapeno (or even the hotter Serranos, if you have nerves of steel) -- and any old Raita formula will do if you don't fancy radishes. Cheap, fast, tasty.

I did not enjoy this recipe. I served it with the "crispy okra salad" found on this website. Too much effort for not a great meal.

I have prepared this recipe many, many times - it's super simple and people always rave. The patties are equally good with just plain yogurt or yogurt, cucumber and onion. I will sometimes make "burgers" with nan. Also, if out of chutney, apricot jam will substitute.

This was absolutely wonderful, easy and healthy. I used about one pound of ground lamb, doubled the rest of the ingredients. One suggestion - don't fry these because the chutney has a high sugar content and they became sticky AND fried. Next time I'll broil the patties. The raita was delicious. I did take the advise of another cook and added grated cucumber (wrung out to remove excess moisture) and garlic. YUM. Made this last night and my fiance already requested it again.

I radically revised this based on what I had: used 1 tbsp garlic and 4 tbsp apricot fig chutney instead of red onion and mango chutney, added seeded minced jalapeno and salt, and omitted the ground coriander seed. It was very good and will definitely get made many times.

I made this recipe with saffron rice and my husband and son loved it. I made the lamb patties as written except without the fresh coriander as i did not have any. I changed the raita quite a bit though and really liked it. To make it more like a salad to accompny the meal I finely chopped radish and cucumber about 2-3 cups, added the red onion and lime juice and enough yogurt to make a dressing. I finished it wth a little chopped mint. Delicious.

We prefer Minted Lamb Patties, also on this site, to this recipe.

I have made these many times and would not change a thing. Even the children love them!

Excellent! Used freshly ground lamb and fat free yogurt. Wonderful flavors.

Absolutely delicious. Add extra chutney for really moist "burgers". I grilled them and added the raita to the bun as you would with ketchup, etc. I didn't have coriander seeds so added a bit extra fresh coriander. Will be making again and again and again!

This was very tasty. I did add a little extra chutney, and spread one side before turning to finish frying, plus 1/2 of a jalapeno pepper(canned). I also doubled the raita(which used the whole small container of yogurt), and increased the amount of radish and onion. I was glad to have the extra raita

Easy and delicious! Basting on more mango chutney only enhanced the flavor. I substituted fresh cilantro for the fresh coriander and it came out beautifully.

I'm not much for fusion cuisine or messing around with classic dishes, but this recipe is truly scrumptious. The curry flavor comes from the ground coriander and cumin seeds, which are the key ingredients in curry powder. Putting mango chutney in the patties sounds a little bit gimmicky, but it really does highlight the lamb flavor. The raita is the perfect complement. The recipe made four patties, which could serve as many as four depending how many sides you have. You could also use the recipe as a rich appetizer by making small meatballs, with or without the raita. Pita bread also goes well with this.

Very tasty, but where's the curry? I modified the dish slightly by broiling the patties with a spoonful of mango chutney on the surface for the last minute. I also did not make the radish raita as I already had some greek style cucumber and yogurt dip with dill (Epicurious) which was great.

I like to add one minced serrano pepper to the lamb mixture for more heat.

Very very tasty and only took 45 minutes to prepare. The raita is a breeze to make. I would add a bit more mango chutney than the recipe says because I think the lamb mixture needed more binder.
