I doubled the recipe. Used the fruit I had: nectarines, one peach and a couple cups of blueberries. Didn't have cardamon - so don't know what it would have been like with it. Everyone at the potluck LOVED it. This is a keeper!

This is a great recipe. I've made it twice for large parties, and it's always a hit. The cardamom really makes it unique--don't skip it!

Delicious! This is a keeper - serving warm with ice cream is a must! We all loved it.

This was good. I've made the Peach+blackberry crisp recipe from Gourmet July, 1991 for a few years now. We tried this one, and the Gourmet 1991 recipe is still the best (can be used w/ peaches, nectarines, raspberries, etc).

This was scrumptious, great way to add raspberries, sweet, very low fat to your dessert menu. The Haagen Dazs was sort of a deal breaker, but really, really good!

This recipe was fabulous. I doubled the recipe for a large crowd and it worked just fine. The cardamon and cinammon combination provides a unique flavor. The crisp takes just as good cold. I will definely make this again.

I made this crisp for a small family gathering and it was delicious! It was a wonderful summer dessert. The raspberries didn't look good that day so I switched to blackberries which turned out well. I'm even making it again for a 4th of July BBQ.

The recipe for the topping for this crisp is excellent and it can be made ahead of time. As another review said you can use other fruits, which I did--a mixture of nectarines, peaches and frozen blueberries. The amount of cornstarch was fine for the fruit types I used. The crisp held up for several days--which was great because I made it to bring to another city for a special family event.

This is an excellent, basic crisp recipe. The combination of the two fruits was lovely, though you could really substitute any stone fruit or berry. I would decrease the corn starch next time since, after reheating leftovers, the filling became gelatinous. I did not have cardamom, and it was just fine without.
