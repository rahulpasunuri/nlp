I didn't even to make this to know it's awful. Tom Yum is a clear broth soup, Tom Ka is coconut based. And the flavor profile is all wrong! IF you're going to attempt making coconut stock use young Thai coconuts available at health food stores.

This recipe was horrible. It may be that you need to use a green or young coconut. I used a regular old coconut and there wasn't enough juice to make the blender happy. Also I ended up with so much fiber from the coconut once I finished making this that I was left with a green, unappealing-looking paste and not a soup! Something was clearly wrong even though I followed directions to the letter.
