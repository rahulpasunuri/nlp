I am totally against corn syrup (nowhere else in the world even makes it except the US and I live abroad, anyway) so I use honey or agave syrup. Tastes infinitely better! More complex. This is the ULTIMATE chocolate frosting. It tastes like the frosting on Betty Crocker cake mix boxes should taste (but doesn't). My 30 year search for the best chocolate frosting is finally over. You can adjust the chocolate intensity by playing with the purity of the chocolate you use. I used all 60% with honey and it tastes almost caramelly.

Delicious frosting recipe. I used all bittersweet chocolate as it was for my daughters birthday and she doesn't like frosting too rich. It ended up tasting like a "rich" milk chocolate frosting. I also used a double boiler, it took about 20 minutes to reach 165, but it was smooth and creamy. I put the bowl over an ice bath while I mixed it with my hand mixer to cool to room temp. Then put it in the fridge for an hour. I could have used it as is for a creamy shiny frosting, but wanted it fluffier so I whipped it for a few minutes with the hand mixer again. Awesome. My new go to chocolate frosting recipe.

This is hands down the best chocolate frosting you will ever taste!!! I have tried a number of recipes over the years--this one caught my eye because of the egg yolks and the other reviews. I must say, that mid-way through the preparation I was a bit worried that it wouldn't come out (things seemed to separate a bit!). But have faith... this is a marvelous chocolate frosting--deep flavor, wonderful texture (yes, you must let it cool--so be patient)... The frosting doesn't get too stiff (like many ganache frostings, or cloyingly sweet and grainy (like those based on confectioners sugar)... absolutely the best!!! This will become my 'signature' chocolate frosting in the future--well worth the time/trouble.

Made this frosting this weekend - AMAZING. Will make for my sons b-day this weekend. Does anyone know if this frosting should be refrigerated or can it be left on the counter for 2 days? I just wondering because it contains eggs and I would like to make at least a day ahead of when I need it. Normally, I like to leave my cakes out on the counter so they don't dry out. Thanks.

I really didn't care for this frosting at all! Can't see why all the rave reviews. It was too runny, too sweet and just not all that!

This is my new favorite chocolate frosting recipe. I have made cakes for a living for several years and this recipe is better than any I have. For a darker, richer look, I didn't bother whipping it at all. I've gotten so many comments on the last few cakes I've made with this frosting.

Definitely one of the best chocolate frosting's I've ever encountered. It truly has the consistency of mousse and honestly could be served as such. Both times I've made this I've gotten specific compliments on how amazing the frosting is. I can not recommend it enough.

The recipe produced enough icing to liberally cover three two-layer 9" cakes. Very creamy and smooth, with a rich chocolate flavor. This will become my chocolate icing standard, as traditional chocolate buttercream can be overpoweringly rich. Beat the icing as directed using a standing mixer, not a hand- held. It may still need to be refrigerated for 30 - 45 minutes.

After I put the frosting in the fridge, it magically turned soft and spreadable, just like the other reviewers had mentioned. I left it overnight and microwaved it to spread on the cake (classic white layers, also from epicurious) the next day and the folks from lab thought it was great.

I made this frosting and it seems the oil from the butter separated from the rest of the frosting. Has anyone else seen that happen? I'm going to put it in the fridge for a few hours, but not sure if the problem will go away.

This frosting is like a dense chocolate mousse. And like mousse, you could eat it all on its own- fantastic flavor. I had to chill it much longer that the recipe said, including an hour of fridge time. If you want to pipe decorations with it, be sure to get it well chilled. Then lick the spatula, the beaters,the bowl ...

This is the absolute best chocolate frosting I've ever had in my life. I was a little worried the first time I made it because it very runny, but I put it in the fridge for a few hours, which thickened it up. After that, I used the whisk on my mixer and mixed it. The icing became so light and fluffy and so easy to work with. It was amazing!! You do need to allow some time when you are making this. It is worth the wait!

This frosting was both easy to make (I used a double-boiler to keep it creamy) and delicious! I left it in the refrigerator overnight before adding the vanilla and using a hand mixer. This was simply because I started it late at night and wanted to get to bed, not because of any thickening issues. At any rate, the texture, thickness, and flavor were all perfect when I applied it to the cake the next day.

Best frosting I ever made. It's got the intense taste of really good dark chocolate (I used Callebaut) and the magical consistency of canned frosting. It seemed all wrong when I first took it off the stove (weird little lumps, not thick enough), but if you put it in the refrigerator for a few hours it becomes perfect.

I left the icing in the bowl for 2 1/2 hours and I didn't think it was the correct spreadable consistency for icing , so I added 1 cup of sifted powdered sugar into the icing -- it was perfect!

This was by far the most delicious chocolate frosting I have ever had. It was fairly easy to make and absolutely fabulous. If using this on a cake make sure to allow enough time for it to cool since it is not very thick when it is finished. I was in a bit of a hurry so I put it in the freezer and it thickened up real quick. I was also decorating so I put a little bit of the frosting in a bowl and put it in the fridge so it would thicken faster. All in all an amazing recipe I will definitely use again.

I was slightly concerned about this frosting as I was taking my cupcakes to an outdoor event. I froze them for about an hour and I was delighted at how well it held up on a humid 80 degree night! Probably the best chocolate frosting I have ever made.

I followed the directions as best I could, but the chocolates never got quite "smooth," and there was no indication of approximately how long to stir until smoothness -- it seemed like the frosting was getting lumpier so I stopped after about 5 minutes. Anyhow, the frosting at room temperature never thickened enough to be really a frosting -- more of a glaze. I put it in the fridge and it thickened, but I expect it will sort of soften if/when the cupcakes it's for are left out at room temperature... That said, the flavor was awesome -- maybe I need to try again...

I made this frosting to frost the Double Chocolate Layer Cake (also on this site) and it was wonderful. I didn't have any unsweetened chocolate so I used 9 ounces of semisweet and reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup. I placed the frosting in the refrigerater until it thickened and frosted the cake. Amazing chocolate cake that I will definitely make in the future.

This is the best chocolate frosting recipe I have ever used. The frosting is perfect in consistency and choco-licous in taste - it's great on tall tower cakes and even cupcakes. I cooled it briefly in the fridge, and it seemed to quicken the "set-up" time a little bit. This frosting is superb. I will only use this recipe from now on.
