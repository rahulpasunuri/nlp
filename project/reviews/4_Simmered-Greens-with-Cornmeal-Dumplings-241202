I just made it, and although not exactly, its a downhome traditional method of preparing many vegetables in Southern Cuisine. I grew up with many such dishes - try yellow crookneck squash and onion, both sliced & prepared the same way, omitting the dumplings. They are awesome. I remember everything having either pig fat or butter in it almost when I was child, lol. Im glad the recipe was here! I miss those dumplings! I made mine with an onion too, and I left the meat in just as my Grandmothers would have. Mine was just turnip greens with black eyed peas and those dumplings! Thanks!

In case anyone else is vegetarian but still wants all the comfort food: I sauteed an onion, added 1 lb of collards, 1 can (14 oz maybe) of diced tomatoes in herbs, and some broth, and then simmered for twenty minutes or so before before doing the dumpling thing (which I halved). Kind of awesome.

I made all the suggestions by the most recent reviewer, adding sausage instead of bacon and it turned out great!

I gave it only 3 forks because of the way I make the variations to it. This is a regular meal at my house, and definitely comfort food in the cold months! I make the dumplings first, set aside, take a pound of ham, kielbasa, or hot italian sausage and brown them in a big pot with some olive oil. Add water and greens (kale works good too. I never measure anymore, maybe 2 qts water and about 5 big handfuls of greens, more depending on the size of the pot. Bring to a boil, add the dumplings, cover and simmer 25 minutes. Sometimes I'll add some onion, red pepper flakes, or hot sauce as the mood strikes. But I love this recipe, and I vary it this way out of cost and convenience.

Exceptionally good greens and the dumplings rock. I'd never cooked greens before and had moderate hopes but these rival the greens my Texas my mother in law makes.

I am only commenting on this recipe because the way Ms. Lewis makes greens is the only way that I know how to cook greens thank to mom and dad. I have over the years changed the pot liquor (that is the part where you score the bacon and boil it for 1hour) or what my mom and dad called it. I have added garlic and have traded off the bacon for a smoked meat (turkey works great here) you could make a veggie version of this by sautéing onions garlic and fennel if you can find it real smoked salt (Real smoked salt is what is burnt in the drying process to make salt), of course you dont need to do the long boiling. The next time I make greens I just have to try the corn dumplings they sound just perfect.

I might make this recipe again, but I would use less water and more greens. When I made it, it turned out very salty and oily -- maybe I didn't use the best cut of bacon.

this sounds SO good. I am planning on making this in the coming week. I was able to find slab bacon at my local european style market for $5.99/lb -- if you're having a hard time finding it, I'd suggest checking at 1) an eastern european, 2) a latino 3) a thai/south east asian markets -- i.e. anywhere but Safeway....

This is now one of my new favorite comfort foods! So easy and so tasty. I doubled the dumpling ingredients and used only 2 quarts of water. It was perfect with a roast chicken. On days when it's -50F we need all the comfort we can get!

I made this with the fried chicken from the same issue, and both turned out great. Finding slab bacon can be tough (try Whole Foods) and I could only find pre- sliced. Doesn't make any difference for the recipe, it just makes it easier to remove the bacon afterwards. The dumplings turn out really well, and the "pot likker" is fantastic; probably has something to do with the bacon fat. And really; is it ever a bad time to eat greens?
