It does not say when you add the bacon I suppose you just mix it in

Should have read the reviews first. Next time I will leave out the caraway. As the earlier review said, it adds a strange competing flavor that's not needed.

P.S. Have never made with caraway seeds and doubt I will.

I really like this recipe - well enough to serve it to guests and they really 'wolf' it down.

I've made this bread twice now, the second time I made it I keft out the carroway seeds. I really think it was much better this way, the tang of the carroway does alot to overpower the tastes of the ingredients that the bread was named for.
