A great seasonal hors d'oeuvre for fresh, Niagara peaches. I used pepper Boursin cheese instead of the ricotta, imported Italian honey and prosciutto, and finished with chopped chives. I also used french baguette for the crostini, sliced on the bias. Everybody loved them.

Made this with nectarine instead of peach and thought it was delicious, though my husband was a bit disconcerted by the flavor/texture combo.

Fabulous. My favorite app to bring to any party!

I substituted fresh goat cheese because I could not find fresh ricotta cheese. I also substituted apple and balsamic vinegar for the honey. Then I sprinkled freshly chopped herbs, basil and thyme. All loved it! Great addition to any meal.

We couldn't stop eating these! Made a double batch for a large group, used homemade ricotta recipe from Smittenkitchen.com It was heaven, made it the next two days for lunch. Perfect!

These were a great starter to a small plates dinner party I hosted. Very nice balance of flavors. Like other reviewers, I drizzled balsamic over them as well as honey. So quick and delicious - perfect when you are making numerous dishes.

This has been a hit each time I've made it. I sprinkled a little balsamic vinegar over the top for an extra layer of flavor.

If you get good quality ingredients I can see how this would work. You need really good prosciutto, a fresh, sweet peach, decent bread toasted just right, and honey that packs a punch. Timing is also critical. Need to serve it right away. Otherwise this could be a dull mess. Mine was somewhere between good and alright. Needed a kick. Herb? Oregano? Marjoram?

Delicious! I made this as an appetizer for a dinner party, and it was a hit! Very tasty! Perfect blend of sweetness and saltiness. Would definitely make it again!

These were delicious and so pretty! I made them an hour or so ahead of time and brushed the peaches with lemon juice so they wouldn't brown. My guests raved about them.

These were absolutely to die for!! Perfect combination of sweet and savory. I drizzled the bread slices with olive oil and baked rather than grilling. Next time, I would make these closer to serving -- I assembled about an hour before my guests arrived so that I could do the hot apps closer to party time and the peaches had started to bruise by the time that I served them.

Loved it! Don't forget the honey though! You should also try the Grilled Corn Crostini here: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Grilled-Corn-Crema-Mexicana-Cilantro-Crostini-365810 SO EXCELLENT. I don't have a grill, so I just brushed on some olive oil and fried the bread, letting it get a little black around the edges. It worked great!

Sounds good to me! Just might have to try it when peaches come in locally.

Just a correction, you can bake or grill crostini, but it usually is drizzled with olive oil first. If it's grilled dry I think it's just toast with a fancy name...
