The only reason I gave this recipe one fork is the flavor of the icing. I am at 8000ft and these turned out to be coarse, greasy, gut bombs. I will experiment further with the dried coconut milk as I loved the flavor of the batter. I was making them for a birthday but they are so bad that they are in the trash. Oh well.

I am not giving this a true rating yet but I feel a bit confused by this recipe. I am fairly experienced as a baker and I was a bit shocked by the number of eggs as well the mixing the eggs in at the end? I am waiting for my cupcakes in the oven now, hopeful! will update

I haven't made these yet, but I have 2 questions. I bought whole wheat flour instead of whole wheat "pastry" flour. I did not realize there was a difference. Do I need to adjust the amount? or should i just use all regular flour. To those of you who have made this - what is the point of using the WW pastry flour? Also, I am considering not using the Choc chips...Any advice? Thanks so much in advance!!

These were amazing! Great coconut flavor, much better than the other coconut cupcake recipe. I replaced the milk in both the cake and frosting with unsweetened coconut milk to give it an extra coconut kick - perfect! The coconut milk powder is definitely what gives it most of the flavor, so it's worth the trip to your local Asian grocery store. The chocolate gives the cupcake a nice contrast but may be a little overpowering, next time I would cut the chocolate chips by half a cup. These cupcakes would be great without the chocolate if you were going for a lighter, more tropical flavor. Delicious!!!

I'm in the midst of making these the second time. I love them. I didn't find whole wheat pastry flour so I used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of cake flour. Works for me. My only problem is not eating too many!!!

This is a great recipe! These cupcakes were delicious. It did take a while to make, but it was worth. Great coconut taste.. I didn't have coconut flavoring or whole milk.. so i used coconut milk instead and skim milk. I made it this weekend, and i am making it again 2 days later!

Excellent, excellent, excellent. A big hit. Didn"t use chocolate chips bc i was making them for easter and chips didn't seem "easter-ish." Also didn't use coconut flavoring bc I didn't have any. Replaced whole milk with coconut milk (not lite, regular) in both cupcakes and frosting.

I made these for my son's birthday and everyone LOVED them. I will make these over and over again. I would like to try and make a cake with the recipe.

These were really moist and delicious. I always use mascarpone cheese instead of cream cheese, and it always makes everything extra delicious without that strong i'm-eating-a-bagel-and-cream-cheese cream cheese flavor. i couldn't find coconut milk powder (or anybody whose heard of it) so i replaced it with some powdered milk and some dry coconut butter.

Well worth the effort! Warm cupcakes slightly before serving to enhance the flavors and create melty goodness!

Very good cupcakes. I don't usually care for the flavour of coconut in sweets, but the coconut flavour was subtle and complemented the dark chocolate very well. The cake had an excellent crumb.I may try using coconut milk instead of regular milk next time as the cook from Denver did.

these are moist and buttery not a strong coconut flavor in the cake part, they aren't outstanding but probably worth making again

These were amazing. I'm going to make them again but this time add ground almonds to the frosting so that it has an "almond joy" essence to it.

loved these! wonderful combination. getting the coconut powder was worth finding it. i made mini cupcakes, so cooked for 16 minutes, and did not line. when i make a again, IF i don't line the cupcakes again, i will put aside 20% of the batter (without chips) to fill the bottom part of the cupcake. if you don't, the chips fall to the bottom and stick to the pan.

These were delicious! I made them for guests and they devoured them. I didn't have time to go to an Asian market to get the powdered coconut milk so I substituted regular coconut milk for the whole milk portion of the recipe. I only used about 4T and they turned out beautifully.

Incredible cupcake-moist with a unique balance of flavors. Be sure not to leave out the coconut milk powder, and try using high quality, dark large chocolate chips to balance out the sweetness.

Accidentally forgot to add chocolate chips but didn't matter! Made these for my birthday and everybody loved them! When I realized my mistake, I briefly considered altering the frosting by making it chocolate- y, but didn't. Will remember chocolate chips next time!

texture is like velvet... not overly sweet - coconut flavor doesn't taste at all imitation... good upscale cupcake
