Delicious. My In-laws sent crab meat from Baltimore, and this recipe was perfect for it. My husband is in heaven!

This recipe is a waste of good crab meat! Made it as written, but added a third egg yolk, and could not taste the crab. Even with the third yolk the cakes did not stay together. Definitely a bummer of a dinner.

Easy to make, tasty and a hit at parties -- I had people asking for seconds not long after the first batch was put out! Broiling is a bit tricky, but worked out better than pan frying. Spray the broiler pan and the crab cakes with nonstick cooking spray (either canola or olive oil type). I also froze the crab cakes an hour, then put them in the fridge; they kept their shape better that way. Also recommend the panko crumbs -- gives a nice texture along with the crab meat. I'll try the suggestion to add extra egg yolk to better bind things together next time around (that is my only reason for not giving this recipe 4 forks). One suggestion on affordable, tasty crab meat: Trader Joe's has canned crab claw meat for $8.99/lb. -- worked nicely both times, and no waste stuff. (The regular canned crab was $10.99, still a better deal than most stores.)

This is my 'signature dish'! I get asked to bring it to lots of family events... I do not broil the cakes though. I pan fry them. I thought that broiling gave them a bit if a 'burnt toast' flavor that we didn't care for.

Made these last night and they were wonderful. Very easy to assemble ahead of time and then just pop in the oven. I will definitely make these again.

To the cook who's had sudden trouble with these cakes' falling apart: Could have to do with the moisture in your crabmeat. When my nephew and I made these we thought the mixture might be too loose to work with, and realized our crab might have been a little wet. He added a third egg yolk for more binding, and the results were outstanding.

This was a hit at our holiday party last weekend. Very easy to make and tasty too! I did follow other reviewers' advice and pan fried the crabcakes, although (IMO) I think that broiling seems a bit less time-consuming. I also seemed to wind up with a bit of breadcrumb leftovers -- and I followed directions to a T. A keeper, for sure!

I liked the basil - gave a different flavor to the crabcakes. But I thought 1 cup of breadcrumbs, plus more for the outside, was too much filler. I prefer to see/taste more lump crab.

Very easy recipe. We didn't mind the basil added and felt it gave them a unique flavor. It was perfect for a "make ahead" item for a large crowd.

Such a wonderful recipe! I use fat-free mayo and no one can tell the difference. Fabulous for parties or make them larger and serve with a salad. I've made this recipe so many times(for different friends) and everyone loves them! You won't be disappointed!

Like Toronto, I left out the Bay Spice & subbed panko for bread crumbs. Then I brushed both sides with olive oil & broiled each side for 3-4 minutes. I've made them twice now and actually prefer them broiled (not fried). The lemon zest/ juice really it a nice zing. Great texture & taste; even with the other ingredients, the crab flavor really comes through (I used canned lump meat). And the sauce is a lovely complement, creamy & mild yet interesting.The best crab cakes I've made yet.

Made this last night and loved it! I did omit the basil, only because I thought it would overpower the flavor of the crab. By the way, I also used a very good canned crab called Phillips Black Fin. Costco carries it for about $14.00 depending on where you live I guess. Anyway, I made entree size cakes and fried them in a little oil. I also served the capers seperately as some people do not like them so I left it up to my guests whether or not to include them. Got great reviews and definately will make again!!

Fantastic! EAsy to make and the best crab cakes I have ever had. I made this recipe gluten free by using Sylvan Border Farm white bread made from a mix. I will never have crab cakes in a restaurant again.

This has become a favorite and much reveared recipe. I personally leave out the Old Bay Seasoning and pan fry them instead of broiling as it seems to add flavour and help keep them together. I also have been known to use imitation crab to cut costs and it has still gone over tremendously. Of all the recipes I have tried on this site - this is the one that is consistantly asked for time and again. Try it.

My friends and family love these so much, they have become a staple for me to bring to parties. I usually make an extra batch and make entree size cakes out of the second batch for dinners. Very easy and low in fat!

I made these twice this holiday season and they were a hit both times. The second time I actually used canned crab. I know, heresy, but fresh crab was $28 a pound and Santa was pretty generous this year. I prefer fresh but the canned wasn't bad in a pinch. I had no problems with these falling apart and definitely will make them again.

Well worth the effort. Even finicky diners loved this one! Prepared well in advance and popped 'em in the oven when company arrived. Great as an entree' portion, as well.

Broiling them is a mistake. I know that everyone is concerned about the fat in frying, but if you broil them (as I did the first time)you will not get the consistency you are looking for. Pan fry them in a bit of olive oil. Also, add an extra dash of mayo. It keeps them from falling apart without compromising the "crabbyness" of the cakes.

I make this recipe all the time! I've also shared it with both of my sisters and my father. I suggest that you use a little more mayo than the recipe calls for. Also don't take shortcuts with the bread crumbs. It's not worth it!

I have made these crab cakes about a dozen times but recently they fall apart any suggestions

I made this for a party of 30. Everyone loved them. Said they were the best crab cakes they have ever had. The sauce was perfect-so easy to do-make them the day before-and cooked several batches during the party-only took a few minutes.

Have made this as both appetizer and entree to rave reviews. I also cut back on the filler and upped the amount of crab. This is a keeper for us.

I really liked the flavor of this recipe and the fact that they weren't fried. I used a little more mayonaise than called for to keep them from falling apart. I also used 4 cups of crab.

I too believe that with great "crabcakes" too much "filler" hides the true taste of quality backfin crabmeat. I made the usual sized cakes.....never would have had the time to make 1" crabcakes. Don't really know if I'm ready to use basil in crabcakes again, seeing I married a woman from Baltimore!

We spend the summers on the Wye River and make crab cakes often. You don't need anywhere near that much filler, nor do you need the added salt from the Old Bay.
