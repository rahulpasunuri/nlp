I was really looking forward to eating this chicken. I love Indian flavors. I was sooooooo disappointed. It was bland and it got very dried out on the grill. Will not make again.

I honestly don't know why there are so many complaints about this recipe. It can be easily altered to make it spicier than it is. When I make this again I will use 4 Serranos. My mom loved it and couldn't get enough. This recipe was simple clear and easy to follow. Instead of grilling the chicken I broiled it, taking it out every so often to drizzle with the Ghee.

this was a huge let down, it smelled so awesome, I even added more spices to it (like garlic, ginger, pepper) and it was lackluster, maybe coconut milk instead of the yogurt would help? it was a lot of work for what I ended up with, I can't figure out what went wrong here

Absolutely awesome! The flavors were fresh and refreshing. The aroma was wonderful and the taste was perfect. My husband grew up in Kenya and had lots of Indian food--he thought this was totally great!

I have made this recipe at least 3 times, and have always enjoyed it. The flavors are subtle, which is actually a good thing. The chicken cooks quite well, and it is served nicely with basmati rice.

The chicken is ok, I didn't have a great 'kick' to it that I was expecting. My dinner guests felt the same - ok, but a little bland. I probably wouldn't make this recipe again.

the chicken was very tender but we didn't get any of the flavors we were so excited about.

This was delicious. We broiled it instead of grilling, and the marinade was so crispy and flavorful! The blend of spices was perfect, and it was very simple to make as well.

Looked good, but was disappointed with the mildness of the flavor. We even added more spices than the recipe required for the marinade - we don't really measure when we cook - and the chicken was still very bland. If we make this again, I'd probably leave the skin on and skip the basting with ghee for better flavor. The leftovers, when mixed with a yogurt-cucumber salad, made decent chicken-salad sandwiches - but it's a lot of work for a sandwich!

Everyone loved this chicken, even my boyfriend who doesn't like Indian flavors. The ghee is what did it for him. I made the recipe as is but broiled it instead of grilling. I think the gas flame being very close burnt some of the delicious coating a little too much. I think the grilling method might be better. Anyhow, the chicken came out great and the flavors are delicious. The combination of the spicy coating and rich butter was so yummy.

This chicken is great! I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I didn't want it too spicy, so I used a jalepeno, but next time I think I'll try a serrano. I cooked it right over the flame because my gas grill only has one burner, and it came out with some nice grill marks in 20 minutes. Fabulous recipe.

I made this recipe because I love Indian style recipes, and cooking on the grill reduces cleanup. The flavors were excellent and the chicken very tender. I used chicken parts I had in the freezer (several small legs and thighs, 2 large breasts), and because I had no Thai peppers I used a Jalepeno instead. I make my own Ghee because it's easy and it's good. I used regular yogurt and drained it for 10 minutes at the most, squeezing it in the cheese cloth just a little, too much and some solids come through. I thought it was just the right consistency. The cooking time was a lot longer for me than suggested by the recipe. I thought I used a lot of charcoal, but perhaps it wasn't enough. Indirect heat does cook more slowly though. I left the skin on with the idea of keeping it from drying out, but will not do that next time because of the added fat in the sauce. I turned the chicken several times while basting and put it directly over the coals at the end to brown it.

I made this substituting pacific red snapper for the chicken. I also reduced the amount of ghee a bit. Ghee is available in middle eastern grocery stores, saving the trouble of having to make it yourself. We really liked it, and it was beautiful to look at. I don't like things very spicy, so I kind or chickened out and reduced the chile amount. It would have been better if it had more heat.

To erosenk from Singapore: before leaving a rude, unrated response, PLEASE read the recipe. If you had bothered to do so, you would have seen that the draining of the yogurt is a step given as an alternative to Greek yogurt, which is not available to everyone. To those who read this because they enjoy cooking, the flavors were wonderful, although the yogurt does tend to make a bit of a mess on the grill....

You'd think that by now they would have figured out that if you buy Greek-style yogurt, you don't have to let it drain.
