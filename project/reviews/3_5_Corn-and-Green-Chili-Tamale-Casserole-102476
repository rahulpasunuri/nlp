Just served this to my meeting of Spanish speakers and it was agreed "I'd raised the bar." Excellent. I used half & half and pork tamales from Costco. Otherwise, just followed the recipe. You can't go wrong with this one. What a way to dress up a tamal(e).

I add olives, sun dried tomatoes and use Mexican 3 cheese mix

This is also yummy for breakfast or as a great brunch item. Just use a 9X13 pan and whisk 8 - 12 eggs into the cream, salsa and spice mixture. You may need an extra couple tamales to completely cover the bottom depending on how big they are. I usually buy a dozen at the Mexican market or local eatery for a meal and use the leftovers for breakfast. And I prefer to double the chilies, onions, chili powder and cumin when adding the eggs and the volume. With a cup of cream, it will puff up and set up best with 10-12 eggs in this size pan and easily feed 8. Leftovers heat beautifully. Muy Bueno!

This is a great recipe and I will certainly make it again. There are many variables that will contribute to heat and soupiness that you might wish to keep in mind. Tamales vary greatly from fresh, frozen to canned. Salsa Verdes can be thick to quite watery as well as varying greatly in heat. Green chilis also vary in heat. I am a tender mouth...so used half salsa verde and half green enchilada sauce...also used Trader Joe's green corn tamales (tamal's). Substituted fat free half and half for the cream. Mine had a nice punch of heat and was ever so tasty. Oh...did use a bit less cumin and cilantro. Avocado added nice creaminess. Also served salsa and sour cream. Try it...I think you will love it!!!

Thank you for this recipe!! My 6 year old has a gluten sensitivity (if she eats it she gets itchy rashes all over!) I made this for her and made sure the tamales we used didn't have wheat (thanks for the tip on the Trader Joe tamales). She loved it! I loved the fact that it's a casserole and I can make it ahead. Hooray!

Tasty and very easy to make! Used the Trader Joe's tamales as other reviewers had suggested.

This is a great weeknight meal. It is also easy to bring to a potluck or party as it can easily be heated in the microwave. I use the salsa that is found in the refrigerated section of the grocery store and I also add some of the bottled mild green sauce. I only use a 1/2 teaspoon of cumin and 1 teaspoon of chili powder. I decorate the top with extra cilantro and green onions and avocado. I serve sour cream on the side!

Made this with fresh pork tamales from Costco. Had to cut the tamales up in larges pieces in order for them to fit in the pie dish. Used the exact ingrediants it called for and did not come out too spicy or mushy as others described. Was a HIT with the family and will be making again....SOON.

I thought this was very good, as did my family ,and VERY easy! I had to substitute cilantro for the green onions, otherwise made it exactly to the recipe. I also used trader joes tamales

The flavor of this dish was good, but it came out realy soupy and all of the tamales fell apart and turned to mush. I would make this again with half of the liquids and maybe thicken it up with cornmeal.

I made this for a party this weekend and it was really easy. I made one with chicken tamales and one with vegetarian green chili and cheese tamales, both from Trader Joe's. They were delicious. Everyone loved them and several people asked for the recipe. It's a little spicy but I have a low tolerance and I was able to eat it (too much of it!). The leftovers are even better than it was fresh. My only problem was with the chicken one, which I made in the pie dish as instructed. It was too full and the cheese overflowed. This actually made it look fabulous and decadent as the cheese was hanging over the side, but I had to make sure to put a pan under the dish while it cooked. I used a small, rectangular glass pan for the vegetarian one and that worked perfectly.

This is really good. And really easy. I used trader joe tamales and sub'd light sour cream and 50% cheddar. was still awesome. will make this again and again. (note: get mild chilli verde if you don't like spice)

Great weeknight meal. If tamales are difficult to find, you can use empandas or even toquitos if necessary. It is good with those too.

I used Trader Joes tamales and found that I only needed 4. I also used half 'n half, because that is what I had on hand. I also forgot the chilies (whoops). We very much liked this dish, but next time I will use less corn. Even my 2- year old ate this up!

Very good recipe. Thank you! To A Cook.....what I can't STAND is ppl that "rate" a recipe with only complaints about the authenticity or spelling of a dish. When I order a tamal from a Mexican resaurant, I pronounce it TAMALE! They have NEVER corrected me and we have become friends of the waitresses. So, WHO CARES as long as it is GOOD!!!!!

I double this recipe, made "as is", for our Christmas brunch, it's always a big hit and one of two dishes to disappear first (French toast soufflé the other). to A Cook: Even though "incorrect", my Latino friends refer to one as a "tamale" because they and the food have been Americanized.

You know, I really hate it when people write recipes for ethnic recipes without knowing the language. Singular for "tamales" is "tamal." "Tamale" is an American error.

This was such a delicious casserole with a lot of heat that won rave reviews from my hungry husband. I even caught him last night eating the cold leftovers from the dish with a spoon! Make sure when you thaw the tamales that you remove any excess moisture so the dish doesn't get sloppy.

This is a great recipe. The whole family loved it. I gave only 3 forks because it is not a "wow", but very good. Make sure the tamale's and the corn are thawed. If not, it becomes a bit watery.

I thought this was good but it was too spicy, rich and filling. I would rather have the tamales by themselves with just some sour cream on the side. You can purchase delicious tamales from Schwans.

I first tried this dish at a friend's house. I loved it. My friend said she used fresh, not frozen, tamales. When I prepare this dish, I use frozen tamales but substitute fatfree half and half for the cream and use low fat jack cheese. My results are as good as my friend's. I highly recommend this dish and think it is a very good weeknight dinner. In fact, I plan to make it for my boyfriend for his birthday dinner next Wednesday.

This was delicious! I was surprised how good it was. My husband absolutely loved it.

This went great after a long day of holiday preparations. I agree that it was better the 2nd day...not so runny. Those in earlier reviews who said they would cut back on the chiles because it was too hot don't know their chiles...any heat would have come from the salsa verde. I actually doubled up on the chiles, the flavor is so good. Next time I will use milk and low fat cheese to make this a little more heart healthy. Anyone who likes this dish should also try Chile Relleno Cassarole, also on this website. Just as easy and just as delicious.

This is a keeper! It's incredibly easy to make and ridiculously yummy. It's a great weeknight meal. I had some trouble finding the tamale's but eventually found them at Trader Joes. It's now a regular in our house.

I made this as a drop-off recipe for new parents and it was a hit. I do think that I will experiment with making this recipe a little more heart healthy, by making the sauce with low-fat sour cream and milk instead of the cream. Even half-and-half would taste okay and would cut down on the fat. I only used half a can of chiles and it still had enough punch. I recommend garnishing with some lime as well as the avocado.

This was a hit with my family. I used pepper jack cheese and regular chopped onion rather than green onions. Also,I couldn't find frozen or fresh tamales, so I used canned. It was still good. Lots of left over sauce--could be an ingredient for a killer dip!

This was incredibly easy to make and I agreed with the previous reviewers...I decreased the green chilies in half and did not cut the tamales in half. My children enjoyed it and I especially appreciated the simplicity of it. I think this would be a great casserole to make ahead of time and freeze.

Tried this last night and my tamale loving husband thought it was great. Easy to make and very tasty. I did leave out the cilantro since he doesn't like it, but it still had a great flavor. I think I would like it a bit "saucier" so next time I will up the cream and salsa verde. Thanks for a great, quick recipe.

I love this recipe and it has become a mainstay in our house. I do make a few alterations. My husband found it to be too sweet with the corn; I susbtituted two 14 oz cans of drained pinto beans and not only did it solve the "too sweet problem", but really added a lot of heartiness to it. It is runny the first day. It stiffens up nicely by the second day, and the flavors are actually is better the second day too. Great dish.

Rating: 3
My family loved this! I held off on some of the cream and cheese though. I added probably only half the cheese and cream and it was still tasty. I will double the recipe next time for a family of four.

I agree that I would also cut back to maybe 1/2 a can of the green chilis when serving, since it is a bit spicy. Wonder if rotelle tomatoes drained would perhaps add a bit more flavor. Turns out lovely and brown, mine wasn't at all runny. Good family dinner, but probably not for company. Served with sour cream and avacado slices on the side. Easy and good.

There is a fresh tamale cart a few blocks from my house, I used those in this recipe. After his first bite my husband looked and gave me a big kiss. I will make this again for sure.

I prepared this for dinner last night after just finding the recipe yesterday. I was pleased with the ease of this dish and the combination of flavors. My family enjoyed it and were even discussing left overs during dinner. I did, however, cut back on the cilanto and cumin as those flavors tend to overpower if used to heavily. Overall, this is a keeper and I will probably make it again.

Rating: 3
Great, easy weekday dish! A fun recipe to experiment with different tamales and salsas. I don't bother cutting the tamales in half since the ones I get are rather small. I like combining different tamales using a rectangular baking dish (beef on one end, black bean in the middle, and chicken on the other end). I also prefer cheddar/Jack to top it and a good quality salsa verde is a must.

Rating: 2
Well, this just didnt' do much for us. We love tamales so much, that we sort of just wish we had them without all the runny sauce. We used fresh, homemade tamales from the local Mexcian market. To make it more 'casserole-like', I would use cream of chicken or cream of mushroom soup in place of the heavy cream, or in addition to. Flavors did develop more over night. Again, this was not bad, just not great.

Rating: 3
This recipe improved overnight. I would make it a day ahead and let it absorb flavors. My guests really enjoyed it. It is good for a "come over and have dinner", but not "we are having a dinner party" dish. I think it makes more than just four servings. I served it with a big green salad and heated, buttered flour tortillas. The dish has just enough heat to it to make it quite tasty. Next time I am going to try and substitute evaporated milk for the cream and see how I like it. Wing

This is a great work night dinner. It couldn't be easier to make. I didn't have mild green chilies so I used hot jalepenos instead. This gave the dish just the right kick.

This dish is probably the most popular one I serve (I am a caterer). I do increase the liquid, but use wonderful tamales from a local tortillaria, which are quite large. I end up cutting them in half lengthwise, then in half widthwise....making 4 pieces of each tamale. For some reason, it is easier to scoop out. I use half and half for the liquid.... Even served this to a group of German visitors who LOVED it.

The flavor of this dish was wonderful! Unfortunately, it got a little runny on me, so I would probably lessen the amount of liquid next time & throw in a few extra tamales. I used 1/2 c. cilantro (rather than 1 c.), and it was perfect - flavorful, but not too strong. I also put a light layer of sour cream on top after baking....DELICIOUS! I will definitely make this again.

This was easy and excellent. I doubled the recipe so that I could bring one into work for a pot luck and have one for dinner. Every bite was eaten at work and my husband had third helpings at home. (I used casserole dishes instead of pie plates.) It is very fattening, but that's what probably makes it so good. I couldn't find frozen 4-oz tamales, so I used frozen 11-oz turkey tamales. I may go to the local Mexican market and buy some better-made ones for the next time.

This is a great tasting recipe and is very easy to make for an added bonus. I did add some sliced olives on top of the cheese before placing it in the oven. This recipe is a real keeper.

I did not give a fork rating because, technically, I did not make this recipe. I could not find frozen tamales so I had to substitute. I made some tamale cornmeal dough and added browned ground beef. The result was fabulous. I think that the cream and fresh cilantro make it. Next time I will try to lighten up the recipe by decreasing and cream and/or using half and half.

This is a fantastic recipe. As I live near the Mexican border, I use homemade tamales, which make this recipe so much better like you wouldn't believe! It isn't hot-spicy at all. I use more cheese than it calls for, and yes, this recipe is very rich, but the price in calories is worth it. Do give this a try.
