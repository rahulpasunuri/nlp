I reduced the chocolate to 1.5 oz and it was phenomenal! I agree with other reviewers that this sauce is too sweet for ice cream. It was perfect with strawberries and slices of green apple. Heavenly.

I make this fairly often, it's easy and perfect for chocolate and caramel lovers! To me, it's a little too sweet to put on ice cream, but great on fruit. Making the caramel as dark as you dare before it burns also helps cut down on the sweetness.

This was good but I think it would have been better with half the amount of chocolate, allowing the taste of the caramel to shine through. I will definitely try reducing the chocolate as it is a step above other chocolate sauce recipes.

Absolutely delicious!

Very good sauce. For the people that are having problems with the caramel seizing when you pour in the cream - that problem can be easily solved by heating the cream before adding it to the caramel. It is the difference in temperature that makes the sugar seize.

Everyone absolutely loved this sauce. I had the same issue with having to dig out some caramel chunks that never dissolved, but WOW! I served it on top of vanilla ice cream with fresh strawberies. My mother kept saying 'wow this sauce is good' over and over again!

We put crumbled shortcake under the strawberries, which added a wonderful base to the dessert. My group LOVED it, and finished the whole thing off. The only issue is when adding the cream, the caramel siezed up, and never fully dissolved in the finished sauce. I ended up having to fish out a small piece of caramel from the sauce before serving. But the taste was delicious. I'd also cut down the salt just a tad.

Briliant, easy, delicious.

Absolutely delicious. I made it for a dozen people and the reaction was tremendous. After they polished off the strawberries with the sauce, someone went out and bought vanilla ice cream for the rest of the sauce. (The strawberries were a far better accompaniment.) What I love about this sauce is that it's not cloying. The flavour is beautifully complex, thanks to the caramel and the salt.

dish was extremely heavy and very high on calories. very filling all I could taste was sugar. I would skip the sugar all together.

This was so simple and absolutely delicious. We were licking the bowl! Perfect over strawberries, but it'd be delicious on top of just about any dessert. Next I'll drizzle it over vanilla ice cream.

Wonderful! I made as directed except cut salt down a bit. Very good with softly beaten cream!

Delicious. The sauce was a tiny bit too salty, but overall, a quick, easy and tasty dessert. Used Splenda to make a bit of whipped cream to put on top, and there was no way to tell it wasn't real sugar when all the flavors combined.

Delicious sauce. I used double cream, not heavy cream, and added two tablespoons of water. Had a wonderful consistency and a fantastic, rich flavor. I want to try the sauce on poached pears.
