I am not here to review but found the recipe during another search. I have this cookbook, The Complete Robuchon, and it calls for 1/4 cup (30 g.). Shame it wasn't proofed before posting.

I have never written a review despite having tried and enjoyed over a hundred recipes on this site, but i felt it was important to mention how poorly crafted this recipe was and warn anyone against trying it without serious modifications. As the person before me suspected, they are NOT looking for 5cups of conrstarch. however, i went with the 30g. measurement which i felt may be approximately .5 cups. this too however was COMPLETELY OFF. I think the correct ratio would be to mix one tablespoon of cornstarch with half a cup of water rather than the other way around as written. Gross oversight here. Most frustrating was the homemade stock i wasted on this, along with perfectly nice white asparagus, and the hour plus i spent working on the recipe before adding this second-to-last step and thereby ruining the dish completely.

Clearly there is a typo here, since I doubt he intended to add _five cups_ of cornstarch :(
