Why even try this? You know cornbread turns to mush when it's wet.

I made this salad for a cookout this weekend, and it was a huge hit! The leftovers the next day, however, were soggy and mushy. Next time I would add the cornbread croutons to each serving (or pass in a bowl separately) because the croutons left in the salad turn to mush by the following day. I had a lot of extra croutons, so next time I would probably cut only half of the cornbread into croutons and use the leftover cornbread for something else. I left out the cucumbers in this recipe and added fresh mozzerella. The flavors melded together very well, and the fresh mint, parsely, and basil, mixed with the roasted peppers (I used three - yellow, red, and orange) were really a great flavor combination. Will definitely make again with the changes mentioned.
