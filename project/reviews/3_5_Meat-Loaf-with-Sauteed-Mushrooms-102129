I have made this recipe several times now and each time my family goes crazy. It is absolutely wonderful. It is a little time consuming but it is worth it.

I am sorry that there are some that didnt like this recipe. We loved it. My daughter even had second helping. It was a little scary putting in the cider but the outcome was great. Will make this part of a regular menu.

Just awful! A lot of steps.. I followed the recipe to a T. It tasted like dirty sweat socks. No one liked it..don't waste your time.

This is a great meatloaf recipe. We've made it many times and it's always loved- even by picky eaters. It is one of our staple recipes.

I hate to rain on everybody's parade but this is TERRIBLE! It has one taste -- vinegar -- and it has a texture that can only be described as toejam. Yuckaroo. I have many more reliable meat loaf recipes that are healthier to boot, and actually taste like, you know . . . meat. In loaf form.

This has to be the best meatloaf I have ever made. In my opinion, meatloaf has to have some type of tomato product so if that is not you thing look elsewhere. Made as per instructions and it was wonderful!

My wife and I love this recipe with the following substitutions: Use crumbs of Parmesan Garlic Croutons in place of the Saltine crumbs. Omit the white wine to avoid excessive moisture. Use Italian stewed tomatoes with excess juice removed then mashed. Add 2 tbsp of Amore tomato paste. Use finely grated celery root, 1/2 cup, in place of the celery leaves. Use a pinch of herbes de Provence in place of oregano. Cover the loaf with Ferrari's Tomato Basil Sauce before baking.

I was intriqued by the onions. This dish was a lot of work for the final product. I think there are too many liquids in the recipe. The meat loaf was not dense and had almost a "pudding-like" texture. The flavor was respectable. Prefer my own recipe.

Although I wasn't amazed by this recipe I would try it again. Next time I would use lean pork as well as lean beef, and I would dice the onions reather than have them chunky. It was a little on the soggy side.

Very tasty, gourmet-ish variation of meat loaf, if you don't mind a less dense loaf. The pork/beef combo is a must. It was excellent, savory and great with a cabernet wine.

I loved this meatloaf! I haven't been a fan of meatloaf until now. The onions made the dish I think; I used 1 purple and 2 vidalias. It was a bit on the soggy side though-- not sure how to curb this problem...

I made this dish for a large group. Doubled the recipe. Got rave reviews.

JUst O. K. a little soggy didn't hold together too well. I thought the onions were good.....I've made worse.

My husband usually makes meat loaf when it is eaten at our house, but now it will be my job. The only thing I changed, was the wine, I didn't have an open bottle of white, so I used red wine. I would even make this meat loaf for guests.

Loved this, although I used crushed rosemary instead of oregano; red wine instead of white; and omitted the celery leaves (didn't have any!)

Pretty good meatloaf. Loved the carmelized onions in it.I used my own canned Roma tomatoes and ritz crackers. Increased oven temp to 400 last ten minutes to brown top and got plenty of pan juices.

Used red wine instead of white. Turned out great! Must make this again! Served it with a spinach salad and mashed potatoes. Very nice meal!

My family loves this meatloaf! They ask for it all the time and say they've never tasted a meatloaf like it before! I actually lost the recipe that i had ripped out of my Bon Appetit..thank goodness for the website!

I loved this meatloaf, as did the picky eaters in my family, and even I'm not typically a meatloaf fan. I forgot to purchase apple cider vinegar, so used a combo of pear and white wine vinegar instead. I also substituted crushed TGI Friday's Potato Skins for the saltine cracker crumbs, since we didn't find them edible as snacks, yet wanted to put our investment to good use. I also forgot to put in the celery leaves, but will the next time. This is definitely on our list of favorite family-style dinners -- and yes, it does feed a crowd.

It was a waste of good ingredients. I'll never make it again.

I was thrilled to find this recipe on the net. I made it a year ago while on family vacation and then lost it. My entire family raved about it. I don't "do" meatloaf but thought I'd try as it serves alot. I did alter it though, per my own tastes and past experiences with cooking. I used an expensive boutique apple cider vinegar, tripled the sugar, used air crisps instead of saltines, and used a mixture of tasty mushrooms. ( Brown, button, woodears and chanterelles). The brand of tomatoes also makes a big difference. I bought Italian imported ones. I know this changes things a bit, but all recipes deserve the best ingredients. I'll be making it once a month from now on!

My husband who does not normally like meat loaf really enjoyed this but I found the texture not to my liking.

Bland, bland, bland. Despite my high hopes for the carmelized onions and the sauteed mushrooms, this ho-hum meatloaf had little to offer in the way of taste.

I happened not to have any crushed tomatoes or white wine when I made this the first time; it was STILL delicious!

I don't like meatloaf, but I did enjoy this one. I made it for a dinner party and my guests all loved it! They would tell me if they didn't. I agree that there were no pan juices to make a gravy with as shown in the picture. I used the sauteed mushrooms over garlic mashed potatoes instead of over the meatloaf. I also used extra tomato sauce while baking. I'll probabl make it again for company since it makes alot.

Didnt like this recipe at all. Everyone ate it but I didnt care for it.

My husband loved this...I was so so, found the onions a little vinegary, next time will try seasoned rice vinegar, not quite as pungent as the cider vinegar, will cut down a little on the sugar. Well worth a try, however.

This recipe was very good...it was the first time I've made meatloaf and it came out perfectly. The carmelized onions added a very interesting, different taste.

The flavor was good and the preparation was easy. It doesn't have a gravy recipe even though it is shown in the picture. And, there weren't any pan juices as it states. What's meatloaf without gravy?
