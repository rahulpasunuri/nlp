I first made this about five years ago for an Easter brunch and since then it is my standard for any holiday breakfast. I've made it following the recipe exactly and I've improvised and it is always enjoyed. I do tend to use a bit more bread than called for, a whole loaf of french crusty bread, preferably stale. And I use the zest from an entire lemon as well, for convenience. It's super easy to prepare the night before, keep it in the fridge, then pop it in the oven when I wake up, for a fast, delicious breakfast.

I won't give forks since I altered. Mine turned out tasty and enjoyable. Subs: made 1/2 portion with leftover whole wheat table rolls, cut and dried in oven, 4 eggs and 2 cups 2% milk, zest of a lemon (prob 2 tsp.), added cinnamon, and entire bag of (frozen) mixed berries, topped with cinnamon sugar. I soaked my strata overnight and cooked it for well over an hour. Without all those berries, this would have tasted like nothing since the custard has no seasoning. Even still, while my family enjoyed it, they weren't scrambling for extras but the husband didn't just toss the one piece left - says he'll eat it for breakfast today - we'll see.

I can only give this recipe 2 forks because as written this is all it can be at best. I followed the advice of the previous reviewer and used oven toasted challah bread, which is definitely the way to go. I also zested 2 whole lemons into the batter, which smelled awesome and made me anticipate something much better than what it was. I even let it sit overnight in the fridge before baking. I think one of the problems is that maple syrup is the wrong flavor. The changes brought it to a 3 fork status, but I am going to have to keep playing with it to get any higher.

I made this recipe for the most part as written but taking into consideration other reviews I made slight alterations as follow; I used fresh challah bread, sliced and toasted in the oven at 225 F for 40 minutes turning once at halfway then cut into cubes. The cubes filled the four cup liquid measure pyrex twice--to the measure line, not the edge. I reduced the liquid in the recipe by one cup which covered the bread and raspberries just barely in a 14 inch round casserole. I increased the lemon zest to approximately two teaspoons and added the maple syrup directly to the batter. The dish was well received with some preferring an extra dash of syrup at serving. Great recipe...many thanks!

Since one of the top complaints is about how soggy this is, think about what you would do to make any other strata, bread pudding or stuffing. The bread needs to have some substance, I'm sorry but regular white bread won't cut it--It needs to be stale or toasted and it needs to sit to absorb all the liquid BEFORE you put it in the oven.

I haven't made this particular strata recipe (yet) but I'd like to pass along a tip which I find works very well. Rather than using fresh bread cubes, toast the bread lightly before you cut it into cubes. It gives the strata a nicer, somewhat crunchy texture.

I served this for Easter Brunch with honey baked ham, a radish and goat cheese crouton green salad and scrambled eggs with kielbasa and thyme. Everyone loved everything, but this was clearly the hit of the brunch. I doubled the recipe, used frozen raspberries (the price difference for fresh isn't worth it) and fresh blueberries (I would use frozen in the future). I also zested two lemons and added about 1/4 cup of heavy cream (so 7.5 cups of mile and 1/2 cup of cream) for each batch. It was really, really good. Surprisingly flavorful for the small amount of ingredients used. It will be an Easter staple at our house. I wonder if anyone has tried adding some Grand Marnier or Cointreau? It seems like that might add some good flavor...however, it was so delicious as it was that I hate to mess with it. Also, I baked it longer than specified because the milk/egg mixture did not appear to be "set" when I checked it after 45 minutes. Probably baked it for an hour. You can't go wrong with this recipe.

I made this strata for Easter Brunch today. At the 45-minute mark, I checked the strata, and it hadn't set up in the center yet and still had a little of the liquid sitting on top. I waited about 15 more minutes while I came online to read the reviews. After reading them, I saw that many other people mentioned the baking time as well. Even after 15 minutes, it was still soggy and jiggly. After taking it out, resting 5 minutes, and cutting, I gave it 30 seconds in the microwave. This did help the egg to cook a bit more, but did not improve the texture at all. Perhaps this needs less milk? I'm not sure, but I AM sure that I won't be making this recipe again. It was disappointing.

An easy favorite. I've made this exactly as written and adapted it several different ways based on what I had on hand, and it always turns out to be a big hit with guests. Experiment with different fruit (frozen works fine), types of bread (I like chewy, rustic versions), and zests (orange or lemon work). It all works.

Cut recipe in half and used sour dough bread crust and all. Didn't measure the lemon zest, just used a grater and eyeballed it. I thought it had just the right amount of lemon. Served with maple syrup on top. Baked an 8X8 pan 50 minutes. Can't wait to try with blueberries.

I must agree with other reviews - this recipe was missing something. I took the advice of other cooks and increased the zest dramatically and I still couldn't taste the lemon. I also added an extra egg. I used blueberries instead of raspberries. The recipe was eggy and like bread pudding. I added vanilla. I got raves on the texture. Dose it well with maple syrup when you plate it and it is great.

Surprisingly, I just did not care for this at all. I agree with Cook from Michigan, it was eggy and bland. I even added cinnamon and vanilla. Still just blah. Waste of good ingredients!

Surprisingly boring. I also extended the baking time way past the 45 minutes, and it still never set up quite right.

This was fantastic--as others noted, it's very easy to throw together--easier than the other similar French toast recipes on Epicurious--and it tastes great--I liked the subtle lemon and thought it wasn't TOO sweet. I followed the recipe instructions and found that I did have to bake longer than 45 minutes--it took closer to an hour when I made it. Raspberries are a little out of season right now, so will be trying with frozen berries next time.

Absolutely delicious! A huge hit everytime I make it and everyone requests it when they know they'll be here for brunch. Super easy to make too. So much so that a 3 year old was able to help me prepare for the entire family. To lessen the guilt a bit I use whole wheat bread instead of white bread. Works great too!

Wow, made this for Easter Brunch along with some fancy scramble eggs and fruit salad. Everyone went for seconds and I was left with an empty dish even though there was only 5 of us! Super easy to put together and delicious, definitively a keeper, just as is!

We have weekend guests often and I tried this to add to my breakfast recipe repertoire. It was not a winner. Out of 16 people, only a few said they liked it and the rest of us were underwhelmed or just plain hated it. As proof, there were tons of leftovers (which I pitched), compared with clean plates when I serve my other breakfast standards (which include much better stratas). I love French toast but this had none of the buttery crispness that is half of its appeal; it was eggy and bland.

Made this for brunch, along with the smoked ham, goat cheese and artichoke heart strata. This was a nice, not-overly sweet accompaniment. I added cinnamon and extra lemon zest.

It drives me crazy when people change a recipe seven different ways and then review it, but please forgive me - this was so good I must share: I substituted blueberries for raspberries, increased lemon zest to zest of whole lemon, put the maple directly into the batter (why not?) and added a tsp of cinnamon to the batter. Also sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top b/f baking. Huge raves!

I really enjoyed this strata, and almost all of it was eaten at the baby shower I hosted so I guess that's a good sign. I added a bit of almond extract, used seven eggs, used a combo of whole and skim milk and regular French bread from the grocery store. Definitely add some almond extract, as I thought it complemented the strata quite well.

I've made this several times for guests and everyone loves it. I added cinnamon to the egg/milk and cinnamon sugar on the top.

I made this for a group of moms and children at my playgroup. Instead of the fresh fruit, I added a bag of frozen raspberries, blueberries, & blackberries. Everyone absolutely loved it and wanted the recipe.

I went with the other suggestions to add an extra egg and dash of vanilla. I also used the grated zest of a whole lemon for an extra- lemony flavor. Be sure to generously drizzle with maple syrup and coat with a good dusting of powdered sugar. Awesome dish for potluck/crowds and above all, so simple to prepare!

Loved it. I followed the advice of others and added an extra egg. It was pretty moist so I am not sure I would do that again, but still very good.

What a waste of a pint of fresh raspberries. This was a pretty boring dish.

I was looking for something just a bit sweeter so I substituted Chocolate chips in and took out the lemon peel. It was a declicious Easter brunch addition! We had leftover so I reheated it the next morning and it was even better the next day!

This was an excellent recipe. I couldn't find fresh raspberries so I used frozen mixed berries and it was great. I added a little vanilla. After discussing it with friends we decided it would be a fun treat to omit the lemon zest and use chocolate chips instead. It would be like dessert! :)

Very quick and easy. I used French Brench and cut into 1 inch cubes, and followed the recipe using fresh raspberries and it was a hit! Will make again and again!

Tasy with sliced Italian bread and lots of lemon zest. I used blackberries but anything would be good. Still not as good as the Eggnog French Toast from BA...our traditional Christmas breakfast for years now!

I made for friends for breakfast and it was wonderful. I used fresh raspberries and blueberries - made sure they were dry after washing. I baked for a good hour - 45 minutes was not enough. It was even good cold later in the day. Used French bread.

I used this recipe as a base and substituted/added tastes that I like...used a lot of frozen mixed berries (blackberries, boysenberries, raspberries and blueberries), left out the lemon zest, and added a dash of cinnamon. Absolutely wonderful...everyone gobbled it up!

I thought this was good. I did make a few changes. I used challah. I sliced it but did not cube it. I added 1 tsp of chambord and used frozen raspberries. I chilled everthing overnight.

This is not really strata but much more like a bread pudding, everyone I had it with agreed. It is tasty, but we added an extra egg and cooked it for an hour, and it was still very moist.

YUM! i just made this dish for brunch with my boyfriend's grandparents. i thought they were just being polite when they made big mmm sounds but after the first bite i did the same thing! i used whipping cream and 2% (i didn't have whole) milk, and added the zest of an entire lemon. i also used 2 day old french bread which was just perfect. i don't think this recipe needs any other spices if you use plenty of lemon and maybe a touch more maple syrup. also don't over cook- mine was still quite moist on the bottom, but it was so sweet and pudding like no one minded. it was also so easy i managed to make it while the guests arrived, and it was ready in only 40 minutes. i think next time i might try adding ricotta just for fun, but this recipe was GREAT!

this recipe had a lot of potential, but didn't turn out as well as i expected. it was a bland and needed some sugar or spices, although the texture was pretty good. if i make it again, it will only be to try to find a way to salvage the recipe.

I've made this dish a couple of times and it was a hit. Very easy, very tasty. Make sure not to overcook, its better if it is creamy and fluffy, not dry. It is on the sweet side so I served it with bacon and a salad.

I served this dish at my Bunco party, and everyone raved!! I added an extra egg, because I did not want it to be dry and it was light and fluffy. I used frozen berry mix (raspberries,boysenberries, strawberries) from BJ's wholesale store and it was fine. Next time, I might use one berry type and apples. I also added vanilla extract, cinnamon, and sprinkled chocolate chips. Bake for 60 mins. This is a great recipe for a buffet crowd.

We made this receipe because I happened to want to use up some day old bread. My 18 year old daughter put it together for me to help out getting supper going and she is not an experienced cook. We used blueberries rather than raspberries and skim milk because thats all that I usually have in the house. Just after she put it in the oven I got home and drizzled a little 1/2 & 1/2 over the top. We left it in the oven for about an hour. I was so happy to complement my daughter on the fantastic dinner that she made. The texture was like a custard and the lemon with the blueberries delicious. This really did not need maple syrup on top afterwords, either. The way we made it was not terribly fattening, but healthy and soooooooo good! Will definately make again.

I tried this recipe for Easter Brunch. It was a hit! I thought that there was not enough lemon in the recipe though and added quite a bit more. I also added a little cinnamon . I think this would taste great with a variety of different fruits especially apples. This was very easy to make!

Wow, this was super-easy and tasty! I used frozen raspberries and they tasted just fine. Next time I would probably finish off the whole bag which was more than the recipe called for. Next time I would probably try a little vanilla to the egg and milk mixture. And it definitely required more baking than the recipe suggests - I'd plan on at least an hour to bake. But all in all, a keeper!!

This was easy and delicious. I used challah, which worked perfectly. It may have been my oven, but it needed a good hour to cook through. I'll definitely make it again, and often.
