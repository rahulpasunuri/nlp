Jean, the very end of the recipe was cut off. You whisk the butter into the sauce 1 piece at a time and then whisk in 1 teaspoon of honey, season with salt and pepper. Add more honey if desired.

One question - what is the butter and honey for??? It's listed in the ingredients, but then never again referenced in the recipe. The lamb turned out great

This is great! I had to make a few changes (no propane for the grill)...cooked for 1 hr at 350, after the first 1/2 hr, I spooned on the balsamic mixed with 2 cloves garlic and sprinkled the lemon pepper. The black and tan gravy reduction was amazing (I substituted the harp and guiness with a Ying Ling Black and Tan), just remember to keep at least 2 tsp of honey on hand, you'll need it.

My aunt gives us fresh lamb from her farm, so the lamb alone is already suberb. The addition of this gravy is fantastic. Have made the recipe twice and served to quests, people love the flavor.

I am so glad I ignored the first negative reviewer. This was outstanding, and actually traveled well: Sliced and arranged in a tower it served 18 for a picnic to the NY phiharmonic in central park! Served at room temp with a few roasted cherry tomatoes for decoration, it was appropriately sophisticated and delicious.

We fixed this for old friends and everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe. The sauce is fantastic and we have made it again for venison. We followed the recipe exactly (unusual) and found it simple and quite flavorful. Of course, we did use Nevada lamb!

This was marvelous....the lamb grilled beautifully, definitely use the tip about grilling above a pan of water to keep the fat from flaming. I added garlic and a little rosemary into the roast before popping on the grill. The sauce wasn't overly rich but still luscious. A keeper.

This was really disappointing. I followed the recipe exactly (something I rarely do) and it betrayed my best instincts by not marinating the lamb. The sauce was very bitter-tasting, although once on the lamb, it did provide some much-needed flavor. I would not make again. There are other recipes using beer that are much better. Sorry, Bon Appetit, you get an F-minus on this one.
