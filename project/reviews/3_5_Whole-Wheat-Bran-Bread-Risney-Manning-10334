I've made this recipe for several years now and it can't be beat. To save time I make a couple of loaves at a time and freeze one (it freezes just fine). I eat slices of it deeply toasted and smeared with neufchatel cheese. It's soooooooooo good! Also, it just makes me feel good when I eat it. It has all the nutrients and benefits of a whole grain bread but with so much more depth of flavor. An absolute winner.

I make this almost weekly and vary a little every time, playing with bran substitutions by using a mix of cornmeal, oatmeal and linseed. YUM, it always turns out delicious. Yesterday I added sunflower seeds and soaked the oatmeal in the buttermilk for 15 minutes for a little moistness. Delicious!

A muffin in a loaf pan, indeed. It has the same delicious salty/sweet umami flavor of a bran muffin you'd find in a cafeteria or hotel buffet. But not that shockingly high-fat muffin's tenderness. It's a bit tough, and kind of harsh with the molasses flavor. It reminds me of the "healthy" baking my hippe mother did through the 1970s. You don't want to notice molasses first or wonder about how much baking soda was used when you're having a snack. It might help to cut the molasses with honey (50-50).

MMmmm...sooo delicious! Definitely a keeper! This bread is everything a good quick bread should be, moist, dense, just sweet enough, soft, and chewy. I made these into mini loaves and mini muffins. The mini muffins were definitely the best muffins I have ever made. It so beats the muffins from nearby coffee shops. Plus, there so much fiber in these, most definitely a must make!

This makes an awesome, super hearty breakfast bread something that will really stick to your ribs. I used the raisins and added a bunch of nuts and 2 heaping teaspoons of cinnamon. I think I'll experiment with some different dried fruit , nut, and spice combos in the future. But toasted up with some cottage cheese, tofu cream cheese, or just plain ol' buttermmmmmmmm!

This is a definite favorite. I make it at least once a month. I always add chopped walnuts and never drop the raisins. Although, the suggestion for cranberries sounds like a good one - next time!

YUM!! Used non-fat buttermilk, cranberries, and splenda brown sugar blend, with a combination of whole-wheat and white whole-wheat flour. Threw in a bit of vanilla on a whim, again, yum!

A suggestion for Magnamosa: rather than cutting out the butterfat, I would suggest trying a bread without the 3/4 c. of sugar that this loaf has.

wow 5 points on weight watchers if you could squeeze 10 servings from this loaf. i know it would be a tad less with lowfat buttermilk and no raisens but looking for a very high fiber but low cal bread. any suggestions?

This is one of my favorite Epicurious recipes. I love it topped with almond butter and honey, or just simply warmed in the toaster oven. It's so easy, and keeps for several days.

this was delicious and moist and just sweet enough. i only put in half the amount of brown sugar because i didn't want it to be too sweet with dinner. it's very dense though, much more loaf-like than bread-like.

Wonderful dense fluffy bread. Mine cooked an hour even, but i think I could loose five minutes...no burning though. Just a hint of sweetness and a distinct molasses undertone, perfect for those who love alternatives to sugar sweetness. I would increase the raisens to a cup, or try what the previous review suggested by adding dried apricots and craisens and nuts. The wholesome well-rounded flavor of the bread would be perfect for supporting sweeter bits of fruits or the texture of crunchy nuts.

A great bread recipe. Mine was ready in about 50 minutes. I made it using wheat germ not bran and made the following changes: instead of buttermilk I used 2 teaspoons lemon juice and enough Eden Original soy milk to equal 2 cups. Also I added a drop of vanilla extract (maybe 1 teaspoon) and some canola oil (2 teaspoons?) to the wet ingredients. Also instead of all raisins I did a mix of raisins, craisins, and chopped dried apricots and I added about 1/4 cup chopped walnuts. It came out delicious (some thought it was a cake!).

A very dense bread, slices nicely. Tomorrow I will try it toasted and spread with cream cheese! I baked it in a ceramic loaf pan which may have speeded up the cooking - it scorched a tiny bit on the bottom and was very crispy on the outside after 60 minutes. I suggest checking it at 50 minutes. I'm sure it would be nice with the optional raisins (I left them out).
