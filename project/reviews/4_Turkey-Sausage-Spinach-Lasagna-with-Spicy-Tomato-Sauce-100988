I used spicy pork sausage instead and added sauted mushrooms. It was delicious! I also used fresh basil and fresh rosemary instead of dried. The prep is a little time consuming but the outcome is worth it and lasts for days. The lasagna gets better the next day as it solidifies.

Absolutely delicious!! Just made it tonight and doubled the recipe. Perfect amount of heat and the only change I made was to use 1/2 spicy pork sausage and 1/2 ground turkey breast. Made for a surprisingly tasty lasagna.

I've made this twice now and it was fantastic. I omitted the whipping cream and red wine the 2nd time without any material change in flavor. Make extra sauce in case you have any leftovers (but that's unlikely).

So tasty with the hot sausage, spicy tomato sauce, provolone and spinach. I add 12 oz. chopped mushrooms when I have them on hand. Have also made with fresh spinach but it's not really noticeable in the end so I don't bother anymore.

A really delicious addition to my list of "make again" recipes! Although it was time consuming, it was definitley worth while. I may consider skipping the home made sauce next time in order to save time. I also added some sauted mushrooms for extra flavor and found it to be really delicious. Husband had seconds and raved the entire time! I was skeptical about not pre-boiling the noodles, but as others have said, it all worked out fine. Will definitley make again and again!!!!

I have several lasagna recipes in my coffers, and this one is one of the best! I used the no-bake lasagna noodles and it worked very well and made it easier. I did add some ground pork to the meat as the Italian Sausages came in a one pound package. The combination of the spicy sausage and the spicy tomato sauce made this somewhat spicier than any of my other lasagna recipes, but not overly spicy. Oh, and I used mozzarella instead of provolone as that's what I had on hand. I thought this lasagna was noteworthy and delicious! You can make the tomato sauce ahead of time and then assemble the day (or day before) for ease of serving. Frankly, I think making the sauce ahead helps to meld the flavors anyway. Try this one - you'll like it!

Delicious. I made the sauce the first time - well worth it, the second time I'm using half jarred sauce and half canned tomatoes, it still turned out fantastic. I added the fresh basil & wine and, because the packages of turkey sausage are usually only 16 oz, I add 4 ounces of chopped turkey pepperoni or regular pepperoni, SO GOOD! I don't keep whipping cream on hand so both times I've left that out.

It is a lot of work, but worth every bit of effort. The lasagna is the best I have ever had. I did double the herbs and increased the spice by about 25%, but I like a bit of fire.

This is the only lasagna recipe I use and it gets rave reviews every time. I have made it exactly as written and I have changed it up for what I had on hand or to save time (i.e.;pork sausage, mozzarella cheese, jarred marinara, sliced provolone, fresh basil) and it still turns out delicious no matter what. Everyone asks for the recipe and gets excited when they hear it is what is for dinner. It also freezes well, so I give it out when friends have a new baby.

Just back from a potluck where this was a hit. I made it last night, the sauce the night before. Both were improved by overnight "aging". When reheated tonight (well over an hour @ 350)it cut perfectly and really didn't require the extra sauce I brought along. The sauce is a treat in itself, though, so why not? Minimal changes I made: Doubled all the herbs, as others have suggested; more than doubled the hot pepper, almost, but not quite overdoing it(careful with this); used TJ's grated Romano/Parmesan blend because I prefer it to straight Parmesan; used half real Italian and half unsalted TJ's tomatoes to control the saltiness perfectly. Foil under the pan caught the overflow and all that juicy sauce did the magic and cooked the pasta perfectly.The dish looked great and tasted better. The leftovers are now lurking in the refrigerator softly calling my name...

I've made this twice and both times it was well liked. It has a nice amount of spice and the filling is good. I think next time though I will reduce the tomato sauce for less time or make more of it - I felt the lasagna is a bit dry, even after adding extra cream to the ricotta mixture, and I like a more "saucy" lasagna where you can wipe up your plate with a piece of crusty bread!

I have now made this two or three times, and have come to the conclusion that it is the best lasgane recipe on epicurious, hands down. Went a bit heavier on the cheese, maybe by a 1/2c or so of provlone, but beyond that, made as written. I simply cannot propose any mods to make it better.

Excellent! this is my second time making it and it has been a huge hit. My husband rarely eats leftovers and this is the exception for several days in a row.

Used Vegetarian Italian "Sausage" in place of real sausage and it was still excellent. I used two packages of LightLife Italian Style Sausages, cut each sausage in half lengthwise and then cut each halve into half inch slices. I also came up about 1.5 to 2 cups shy on the sauce and had to improvise. I may have cooked the sauce too long but it tasted great so I would increase the amount of sauce for preparation by 25% - 50%. Overall this was really good and I am definitely going to make it again.

Rating: 4
Great lasagna. I would definitely make again just change up my pans. I usually make one for the day, and one to freeze and I overfilled them. You definitely need depth in the pan as the lasagna noodles cook and expand. I just used sauce from the jar adding red pepper flakes as someone suggested and it work just fine and saved time. I used two jars.

Rating: 4
Overall a great receipe. I used my own homemade tomato sauce, rather than the recipe included. I also substituted fresh basil (1.5 c, firmly packed) for the spinach and I used both mozzarella and provoline. No need to shred... just lay deli slices of boarshead cheese across the lasagna. I also made it three layers of noodles, rather than two!

this really is an excellent lasagna - you can feel free to add another layer to it, and I personally think mozz works better than provolone here.

This is a great lasagna to make if you're tired of making the same old lasagna (in my case vegetable lasagna). The spicy sauce really makes it a whole new dish. We use chicken sausage instead of turkey.

I frequently make this lasagna for dinner parties and it is a huge hit. To save time I use two jars of organic supermarket pasta sauce and add 1+ tbsp of crushed red pepper flakes to replace the "spicy tomato sauce" recipe. I also use a bit less of the parmesan sprinkled onto the lasagna layers as the full amount makes the dish quite salty to taste. It's a crowd favorite, and I usually need to make two pans to satisfy six greedy diners.

I've made this dish many times and it always gets rave reviews. We enjoy it with pork sausage a bit more than turkey, and using Classico spicy tomato sauce is a handy time saver. Wonderful comfort food!

This lasagna is to die for. I doubled the recipe as I was making it for a party and everyone LOVED it. I didn't use spicy sausage in the sauce because I was making it for a large group and didn't want it to be too spicy. My husband, who adores spicy food, commented that it had plenty of spicy flavor. I also used some mozzarella in addition to the provolone. The provolone from Costo works great because it comes in nice thin slices that make layering very easy. Can't wait to make it again!

I made this lasagna the night before my 10 year old daughter was born (in April 1999), and it has become an integral part of the story that I tell her every birthday about her birth. I haven't made this in years (two more kids, crazy times), but I am planning to make it this weekend as a surprise for her. I threw away all my old Bon Appetit copies, and thanks to Epicurious, the recipe is now at my fingertips. This will become a recipe that I will pass down to her when she is on her own.

This was very tasty and I will definitely make again. My husband helped with the whole process and we ate the lasagna with a glass of the wine we used in the sauce. We had fun making it and really enjoyed our "date night" eating it! We increased the sauce by half and had plenty to make the lasagna (I don't like to be scimpy with the sauce). We made the spicy sauce the day before and used 3 28oz cans of diced Italian tomatoes only, used fresh herbs and doubled the amount. Also doubled the red wine and added sauteed mushrooms. For the lasagne part of the recipe we used spicy chicken sausage (which I was initially dubious about, but now I'm convinced it makes this great!), used fresh herbs (doubled the amount here too), used reggiano cheese in lieu of the parmesan to decrease the salt, used fresh lasagna noodles and added two layers of fresh baby spinach instead of adding the frozen to the ricotta. I found we didn't use all the ricotta (didn't want to overdo it!) so next time will probably make a smaller amount of that. We are not experienced cooks but I found it so helpful to read everyones comments and knowing what we like make the appropriate changes. I did not find this difficult to make either. A big yummy four forks from us!

This recipe is phenomenal and was a total hit at my party. Don't be worried by the "spicy" in the title . It isn't very spicy at all. And my only advice would be to use more than just one normal sized jar of tomato sauce. It wasn't enough so I added some canned crushed tomatoes.

I was a little skeptical of using raw noodles in this, but it turned out great and saved a step. It did take a while to prepare and put together, but well worth the effort. Rave reviews from all. I added some extra fresh spinach to up the vegetable quotient. The only change I may make is to add minced fresh garlic to the ricotta mixture. By the way, it makes a lot more than 6 to 8 servings. To me, it was more like 12 to 15.

Exceptional lasagna and you really don't have to pre-cook the noodles! I used gluten free brown rice lasagna noodles and the lasagna was fabulous. Followed the recipe exactly, and since I was using gluten free noodles I cooked the lasagna for the time stated. You may want to place your lasagna dish over foil to catch the boil-overs.

Best lasagna I've ever tasted. I'm vegetarian so I used 1 1/2 packages of Field Roast's spicy chipotle sausage. Per some other reviewers, I doubled the spinach and added sauteed mushrooms. Rather than using the Classico Spicy Red Pepper sauce (which is kind of pricey), I just used canned crushed tomatoes with basil and added some red pepper flakes. It came out beautifully. Our dinner guests asked if they could move in.

DELICIOUS and foolproof!!! Added 2 cans of spicy tomato sauce like other suggested, and also agreed with a previous reviewer that time is off - I only used 2 layers of noodles (6 total) and a 12 x 8 glass baking pan, but 45 minutes covered was enough time for it to be completely done. Would definitely make again - best lasagna recipe I've ever made and I really like that you don't have to pre-boil the noodles.

I've tried this recipe twice now w/ fantastic results. Both times I made a few minor substitutions and used some generic items in an effort to save money. For example, a block of provolone for grating is very expensive so the second time I made it I purchased 2 6oz bags of "italian blend" store brand grated cheese. I couldn't even tell the difference in cheese quality. The second time I made it I had some folks over for dinner and they were very impressed! I would definitely recommend this easy recipe to anyone who wants to make a GREAT lasagna.

I haven't served lasagna at a dinner party since I first started entertaining many years ago. As my culinary skills improved I found it to be uninteresting and common. This past weekend I cooked for my extended family and because there were vegetarians among us, I decided to to have an Italian theme. I chose this recipe for the meat- eaters and I must say it was fabulous and received rave reviews. I even messed up the recipe by using all of the filling between layers and spreading all the remaining sauce over the top. It still came out superb. This definitely wasn't just any old lasagna!

This is one of my favorite recipes for a cozy 6-10 person dinner party. Make sure to get high quality fresh ingredients and make the fresh spicy tomato sauce recipe included. I often substitute ingredients, but this recipe is phenomenal as it is. It is rich and a little different than typical lasagna with the provolone and spicy sauce. It is a bit of a splurge in terms of cooking time, money, and calories. But it is so worth the effort! My friends love it, it's delicious and it makes the house smell wonderful. Seriously, my friends *know* this lasagna and get excited when I announce that I'm making it!

This is an old standby in my house. I make it maybe 4 times a year and we always love it. I cook the sausage in the sauce, use pork sausage most of the time and don't always make it spicy. I use fresh spinach or whatever greens I have on hand. I make it a day or two in advance and refridgerate it uncooked and then cook straight from the fridge-- always with great results. It's foolproof!

My husband decided to make dinner for us and wanted to make lasagna. I told him to look on epicurious and he picked this one. The only thing he did differently was to use cottage cheese instead of ricotta (because he doesn't like it). It was delicious! Even my picky son who didn't want to try it ended up liking it! Saved it in my recipe box... I (hopefully my husband) will definitely make again!

Outstanding. Used spicy italian chicken saugage (closer to 2 lbs). Made my own sauce (not spicy) and added the cooked sausage to it the night before. Assembled the next day. Had extra ricotta mix left so added one more layer of pasta. After uncovering the dish, added extra parm, and baked for 15 minutes. Finished under the broiler for about 5 mins to brown the cheese. Smelled and looked great, and best of all, tasted great. Everyone had seconds. Delish!!!

Excellent lasagna, however the cooking time for me was off. 45 min cooked covered and it was done. I started to cook it uncovered for 10 min attempting to follow the recipe, but had to take it out after 5 as the bubbling sauce was bursting out of the dish and onto the oven walls! Def ready. I could hardly wait for the cool down... was delish. Might try regular turkey next time.

My boyfriend and parents absolutely loved this recipe. I have never made lasagna before, and this was a very easy recipe to follow. I used two jars of Classico spicy red pepper sauce as others reccommended, and that was great.

But it was worth it!

This is my new favorite lasagna recipe. The no cook noodles is brilliant. Saves a nice chunk of time. I also used the Classico Red Pepper sauce (2 jars). To cut down on calories and fat, I substituted low fat ricotta and reduced the amount of parmesian. I didn't bother with the heavy cream and instead, used the smallest can of evaporated milk that I could find. I added sauteed mushrooms as others recommended. Next time I will cut the amount of turkey, up the amount of mushrooms and spinach. I willl also reduce the amount of provolone.

This is one of the best lasagnas I have ever had. Not difficult to make, though does take a little time. Prepare sauce one day ahead to cut down on prep time for one night. Sauce was not as spicy as I expected, so I would add more red pepper if you want a bigger kick. I would also suggest putting lasagna pan on top of a baking pan to catch any overflow while baking.

I have made this once before and rated it four forks, but that was when I used simply ground turkey. Having now tried the recipe as written, with turkey sausages, I think it's way better with plain ground turkey. It may have been the kind of turkey sausages I was using, but it seemed noticeably different to me. Still good, but texture-wise I think ground turkey is the way to go.

I have made this Lasagna for guests about 6 times, and it is now *requested* when i have dinner parties. Always raves. I use 2 jars organic supermarket sauce, and aged provolone.

And, a warning - when cooking four for a party, i used disposable aluminum lasagna pans, and the taste was off. the Glass dish is a must.

My daughter, who asked for spinach lasagne for her 39th birthday dinner said this was the best lasagne she'd ever had. I made a double recipe - put 3/4 into a 11 x 14 dish and the other 1/4 into a smaller 5 x 7 dish. I doubled the amount of ricotta (used 4 15oz. tubs fresh from TJ's. Bagged frozen spinach, Quattro Fromaggio and three packages (4 sausages in ea) of turkey/chicken sausage w/jalapeno peppers - all from TJ. Used 4 jars of Classico Spicy Red Pepper sauce - used three for assembling the lasagne and then heated the remaining one to spoon on top of the lasagne at serving time. I didn't do the dollop of spinach/ricotta on top because of using less sauce in the lasagne. I liked the firm lasagne and the look of the spooned red sauce on top. It was fabulous!

If there were such a thing as six forks, this recipe would get it. The lasagna was excellent and the dollops of ricotta mixture on the top made it different. Could not locate Italian tomatoes for the spicy tomato sauce and instead used an equal amount of fire-roasted tomatoes. Also, the wine (I used merlot) in the sauce made it all the more special and yummy. The hot Italian turkey sausage makes this dish!

So much wonderful flavor abounds in this lasagna--to the point where every other lasagna I've tried since pales in comparison. A few notes: Newman's Own jarred marinara works fine here. Add a little basil, and you're good to go. Barilla flat no-cook noddles are as good as it gets, but I always cook them a little (four minutes). Otherwise, it's a bit too crunchy, which is a texture that doesn't quite work with the recipe. I have yet to include the whipping cream during prep. A little milk does just fine.

This is a fantastic lasagna recipe that was a hit with the entire family. Being vegetarian, I replaced the turkey sausages with broken up soy/seitan hamburger patties, which worked wonderfully.

This is a keeper. I made it along with the Roasted Vegetable Lasagna for a BDay party and it was a hit. I couldn't find the turkey sausage so used spicy chicken sausage. Instead of the sauce recipe here, I used Classico's Spicy Tomato and Basil sauce. I also used TJ's Quattro Cheese mix (provolone, mozzarella, fontina, parmesan). The no cook lasagna noodles turned out great, no problem with cooking them. It was my first time using them and I was pleasantly surprised. I did add enough sauce to cover and followed a previous reviewer's suggestion to not bring the noodles to the edge of the pan. I left about an inch on all sides. Great recipe and just spicy enough!

This recipe is superb, and my family and friends loved it. I used the spicy tomato sauce recipe but substituted fresh garden ripened heirloom tomatoes for the canned tomatoes.

Other than that the recipe stands very well on its own. I highly recommend it!

I made it as part of my birthday party menu. It was the 1st time I've ever made lasagna. I used the spicy tomato sauce recipe and cooked it about 8 hours in the crockpot on low. I doubled the "ricotta mixture" and left out the spinach. Instead of just provolone, I used the Trader Joe's "quatro" blend of shredded cheese, which includes provolone. It was a wonderfully cheesy lasagna. We all talked about it for weeks. My boyfriend saved the last piece for me to enjoy for breakfast the next day. Delicious!!!

This was so good and so easy! The noodles cook perfectly in the sauce. I didn't use any cream and used lowfat ricotta - I didn't feel like any richness was missing. Instead of frozen spinach I partially sauteed fresh spinach to add more nutritional value - turned out very well, though it made the ricotta mixture a little harder to spread. Worth it.

Love this recipe, but (especially if you make the recommended sauce) it takes at least 2 hours to prepare (at least for me :).

Per my friends request I'm making this recipe again this weekend. This Recipe is so easy and easy to adjust. I omitted the spinach and doubled the ricotta mixture. Don't sikimp on the ingredients, it doesn't hurt to through in extra cheese and turkey sausage. I also cheated and use a really good gar sauce. After reading some of the other reviews, I think I will follow one suggestion and make two for leftovers for next week. IT'S REALLY GOOD!!!!!

I'm surprised by all these reviews. Served at a dinner party because of all the raves. Everyone thought it was good, not great. Followed recipe exactly. Sauce was yummy, but the rest seemed just average.

Very easy to make! Perfect comfort food that can be made quickly if you make the sauce ahead of time. The recommended spicy tomato sauce in my opinion was very good. I also ommitted the canned tomatoes with puree and instead used two large fresh tomatoes and sauteed them with the onions.

This is ONE of THE BEST recipes on this site! I usually always made two. I use Chef Paul Prudhommes's "ARBOL" spice to give kick and flavor! (not ment to be a plug.. I really use it!) The other lasagna is made closer to the recipe. EVERYONE loves it!

I have made this recipe twice. The first was for Thanksgiving dinner and then again recently. Everyone loved it. It was delicious. I made some revisions. I used sweet sausage and put it into the lasagna instead of the sauce. I also cut the amount of red pepper I put into the sauce. I wa sconfused as to wherther I needed to use the "no bake" noodles or use regular noodles and just not cook them. No one really stated that in any of the reviews. So I made it once with the no bake noodles and once with the regular noodles. I liked it better with the traditional lasagna noodle....and no, you do not have top cook them first. They cook up great. Great lasagna recipe. I will keep it as a great alternative to the traditional lasagna.

I have made this dish for years, and it is always excellent. I usually make double the sauce as it freezes well and can be used for other dishes. I usually add mushrooms and the type of sausage I use varies. Have used chicken, spicy Italian, turkey, etc. Fresh spinach is nice in the lasagana, and I sometimes add a litle extra cheese. A great, classic lasagna recipe.

Excellent lasagne recipe! Great sauce and I made it without the turkey too, also I substituted mozzarella instead of the provolone and it turned out great! My kids loved it too!

This is a great flexible dish, and a family favorite. You can make it the day before and leave it in the fridge. You can flex the amount of ricotta, cheese and sausage to your taste. If you use spicy sausage be sure to cut down on the amount of red pepper. We usually make a half lasagna and it cooks about the same time when taken from the fridge.

I make this lasagna all the time for my boyfriend and he loves it. Don't skimp on getting the good ingredients. I've tried to do it on the cheap a couple of times and it never turns out as good. I use spicy italian sausage instead of turkey sausage, and will occasionally use premade gourmet sauce to save on prep time. Great recipe!

Very good and quite easy. I would make and add more sauce next time, at least another four cups, and extra spinach. Nice flavor.

I can't believe I'm doing this, but I'm going to share all the things I did to change this recipe because of what I had on hand, and after reading some of the reviews below. This version is 4 forks worthy. The first thing I did was chop up 1 onion and a container of cremini mushrooms, 2 tsp red pepper flakes, 1 tsp fennel seed then sauteed til soft. I used a jar of marinara and added to onion/mush mixture - didn't have sausage, so this was omitted. Didn't have dried basil, so I added about a 1/4 cup pesto to ricotta. Wilted/drained/chopped fresh spinach and used the same water to soften the noodles. Used the Trader Joe's Quattro Formaggio for cheese. Was able to put the dish together in about 20-25 before baking. This was seriously good.

Rating: 2
I followed the recipe exactly - I was expecting much too much from the sauce, which we thought was just average. The provolone and spinach additions make this recipe. I'd suggest using a couple of jars of Paul Newman's brand sauce and save a lot of time and mess.

Bit time consuming (so not 4 forks), made the sauce one day, next day prepared the lasagne. Didn't follow the recipe completely added dried chilli rather than pepper flakes, used more than the recommended amount of herbs. It was very tasty and full of flavour - the smell alone had everyone at work raving the next day so definitely going to make again.

A good basic meat & spinach lasagna recipe. To save on time, I used Trader Joe's quatro formaggio shredded cheeses instead of just provolone. I found absolutely no problem with the tomato sauce; the quality of the canned tomatoes you use makes a big difference in the end result. Enjoyed this very much.

Hands down the best lasagna I've made! I've made it several times and it always comes out great. A perfect go-to meal since you can make the sauce any time, refrigerate or freeze, and then assemble the lasagna before dinner. It's great not to have to cook the noodles!

OH YUM!! This was fantastic. No soggy noodles (because they weren't cooked beforehand), and what flavor! The best lasagna I've ever had! It freezes well, too. Watch for boiling-over tomato sauce (you may want to line part of the rack below your pan).

I made this for a Superbowl party and it was outstanding. One of the best I have had. Not too heavy compared to other lasagnas.

I must admit that I did not use Italian suasge as we are not big fans of fennel often found in that sausage. Ground beef is my Mother's favorite in lasgana so I used that but apparently didn't season it highly enough for my family's taste. The tomato sauce was good but did not make nearly enough to completely assemble the lasgana. Luckily I has a jar of pasta sauce in the pantry so that I could finish the dish. The spinach ricotta layer was good. The method of cooking is what is best about this recipe. Layering uncooked noodles with the other ingredients works wonderfully. (Everyone else thought we would be eating crunchy lasgana for Christmas dinner). I wouldn't spend the time making this suace next time but will continue to use this method to make lasgana in the future.

This has become a family favorite - great combination of sausage, cheese and spinach. We use turkey chorizo and spike it up with extra crushed red pepper. I use a store bought sauce - Classico with spinach I think it is, and add my own personal touch. Freezes well. This will always be on our menu.

I definitely added some sugar for the spicy-sweet combination, which was very well received by my guests. I also used normal sausage the second time as the turkey sausage I used the first time didn't have enough oomph, we couldn't really taste its flavor.

Rating: 3
Yum. Perfect comfort food. I personally found the sausage to be superfluous, and probably won't make use it next time. I used 2 big jars of Newman's mushroom marinara sauce instead of making the sauce that goes with the recipe and shredded mozzarella instead of the provolone. We liked this very much on a cold night, and there is so much left over that I'll get a night off from cooking later this week.

Very tasty, my whole family enjoyed it. A few variations: I used a jar and 1/2 of pasta sauce from Trader Joe's instead of making the sauce. Layered fresh spinach on top of the ricotta mixture and used spicy turkey Italian sausage from Whole Foods and imported Italian provelone, also from WF. I was worried that the spinach wouldn't cook enough, but it was a fine addition. Will make again.

I normally don't like lasagna at all, but I needed something that could be made ahead and would feed a large crowd...so I tried this. Wow! I was so impressed! I had at least three people comment that this was the best lasagna they'd ever had. It's full of flavor, has tons of cheese, and is not at all dry. It is also not too spicy (though I LOVE spicy food), so even the less adventerous will appreciate it. I'll definitely make this again, and wouldn't change a thing!

This is a knock-out dish. I substitued sliced provolone from the deli instead of shredded. If you are making this for the first time, don't be alarmed with how liquid-y it looks when you remove it from the oven. Just let it stand for 15 minutes and it will be perfect. This is one of those dishes you will become famous for, after you make it your family and friends will forevermore request it!

I'm always hesitant to make a dish for the first time for guests, but based on the great reviews decided to take a chance. The recipe lived up to my expectations, even though I substituted a few ingredients. I used ground turkey instead of turkey sausage (added some crushed red pepper for spice), used mozzarella in place of provolone, and my favorite Fresh Market marinara (which is a bit spicy), and the results were fantastic.

I have made this recipe a couple of times, in a couple of different ways and it has been out of this world good. I use real Italian Sausage (pork, etc) and I do not make the suace recipe. Instead, I use two jars of premium sauce. I have experimented with one jar of a good straight-up marinara and the other jar being some sort of creamy vodka sauce or something like that. It comes out great. Once, I even accidently confused the provolone with the parmesan when it came time to make the ricotta mixture and it still turned out great. Oh, also, I shred premium cheese, never use packaged stuff. A finely chopped hot pepper relish or giardinara when served is so good. Crack open a bottle of Chianti and get ready for a truly great meal.

This is my new favorite lasagna. I always made it with roasted vegetables in the past because I found traditional ground beef or pork lasagnas to be far too greasy for my taste. This one was so delicious and no orange oily stuff! I love the spinach to give it another dimension of flavor texture and nutrition. I will definitely make this again!

This is by far, the best lasagna I have ever had and one of the easiest to make. I was cooking for vegetarians and cut out the sausage completely, but added 2 layers of roasted veggies, zucchini, squash, and peppers. The sauce is what makes the dish memorable, so do not skimp and use canned. I also doubled the amount of basil and used fresh herbs. I too was nervous about the noodles not cooking enough, but they were perfect. Great amount of heat, unique flavors, and easy to put together. One guest went for thirds. A must!

This is truly a great lasagna, and definitely the best I've made. It keeps very well and tastes just as good if not better for the inevitable leftovers. I used mild turkey sausages which was fine (although I looked for spicy, being a spicy kind of guy). It's truly the provolone that makes the dish - I don't know why all lasagnas don't use provolone.

Hands down the best I've ever tasted! The sharp provolone accents the flavor of the sausage beautifully. I recently made this for a dinner party and was such a hit!!! It was especially easy because I made it the night before and kept it in the fridge.

Folks, this is truly an amazing recipe for lasagna. I serve this for close friends all the time and everyone can't help but take huge second helpings. I made a few changes that I thought I would share: Don't worry about boiling the noodles. They'll cook in the oven--there's enough moisture in the dish. I have two many vegetarian friends so I usually omit the sausage from the sauce. It's still excellent. Before you put the final dollup of cheese on the dish, try adding a layer of fresh basil leaves and then cover in the remaining cheese. It's a trick I learned from The Soprano's. Works like a charm.

Best lasagna I ever made. Several friends I served it too said the same thing. I made a larger batch of sauce. I would recommend this since it's SOOO good. Just like a real Italian restaurant in North Jersey would make! The only thing I would change is the type of cheese I used - - I didn't use the best quality parm cheese and the cheese acid notes were too strong. Note: this recipe uses more sharp cheese than most so make sure you like what you put in.

This is the first time that I've ever attempted to make lasagna (being new to cooking and all!) and I thought it was a really easy recipe! I ended up putting the more provolone and parmesan cheese on top of the last layer of sauce, so it was really cheesy.

This is definately "oh-my-god" good!!! I've hated lasagne my whole life with the exception of a family recipe that I've made for years. But I was looking to use up turkey sausage and stumbled on this. Figuring that at the very least it'll feed the rest of the family (I can always have popcorn later), I decided to give it a try. I didn't have the sauce fixin's so I just used canned spaghetti sauce and added some red wine to that to "thin" it a bit because I wasn't sure there was enough moisture to cook the noodles. I also didn't have provolone so I just omitted it. But even with all that missing, it was still ass-kickin!!! I, a confessed lasagne-hater, ended up eating two full servings and even my fussy 4 year old (who initially sat down and refused to even try it), took one bite and couldn't stop until he was stuffed. Tear up the family recipe and slip this one in it's place - you won't regret it!

This lasagna was such a hit that I made it about 5 times in 3 months - once was upon request of a friend for his birthday dinner. I agree with other reviews - you must add additional sauce, maybe even double what is listed in the recipe. I use pre-made sauce and it still tastes wonderful.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe. The spinach really adds to the final product. Noting other reviews, I doubled the sauce so that I'd have plenty to serve with the lasagna (had some left over to freeze this way, too). I did cut the red pepper to 1/2 tsp, because there were some younger & older folks at dinner that I had to consider, but I thought that the spiciness was just right with this amount. Made the sauce the night before to make things easier, which worked out well, since it's very easy to throw together & then you just have to let it simmer. I did also add about 1/2 cup more sauce between the layers, because my tomato chunks were quite large, so the 1 cup of sauce didn't seem to go far enough. Had no problem not boiling the noodles first, which was a great timesaver! Also, this was even better reheated the next day (something I've always found true of lasagna). The one caveat I have to offer: those younger & older folks at my table weren't crazy about the "smelly" (quoting the younger) cheese, i.e., the provolone (though they still thought the lasagna tasted great), so I might stay with mozzarella next time I make this.

I've made this 4 times, and people always ask for the recipe. If you think it is too spicy, reduce the red pepper flakes in the sauce - DO NOT choose sweet sausage instead of the hot/spicy version to try to reduce the "bite". It wasn't nearly as good with the sweet sausage.

Rating: 3
Wow. Very good and easy because you don't have to boil the noodles first. I used regular italian sausage but I think it would be good without any at all and little extra spinach. I also used a combination of provolone and mozzarella.

Rating: 4
This was a big hit with my guests. I substituted regular ground turkey for the spicy turkey sausage and added a little more crushed red pepper. The Spicy Tomato Sauce is key. I also substituted mozarella for the provolone. I made a mini vegetarian version using mushrooms instead of turkey. You will definitely make a mess in your oven as the sauce bubbles up and over the side of a 13x9x2.

The lasagna was a HUGE hit in our house. The flavors blended well and it wasn't too greasy (my usual issue w/ sausage). My only suggestion is to use a deep lasanga pan vs. a 9x13-inch pan. I ended up with quite a mess in my oven.

Everyone I served this to said it was the best lasagna they had ever had. However, I substituted Hot Italian sausage (pork) for turkey sausage.

It is a Christmas Eve tradition from my childhood to have lasagna for dinner on this night, so had to continue the tradition with my husband. Found this recipe after a quick search, gave it a shot and was delighted with the results! A spicy green chile turkey sausage from the deli case added a wonderful kick to the already slightly spicy Tomato Sauce. Decadent and delicious!

I've always bombed out with lasagne recipes before, but this one was fantastic! It's not nearly as time consuming/labor intensive as it looked at first (making the spicy sauce, etc.). I substituted lowfat ricotta and reduced fat cheese and it still came out great. Freezes well, too. :)

Very good lasagna...substituted turkey with chicken sausages and used a mixture of asiago and aged provalone. Delicious

Rating: 4
I loved this recipe. First of all, not having to pre-cook the lasagna noodles was a relief! Secondly, I substituted simple turkey burger meat, for the turkey sausages. It turned out very well. I like this particular recipe because the lasagna tasted so light, and much less greasy than other lasagna recipes I've tried.

Outstanding -- tripled it for a large group, everyone loved it, and fights almost broke out to determine who took leftovers home -- easy and delicious

Rating: 4
This is by far the best lasagna I have ever made, and quite possibly the best lasagna I have ever had!! My only substitution was to use mild beef/pork Italian sausage rather than spicy turkey Italian sausage, and I skipped the red wine(just a personal preference thing). It was zesty (but not too hot), and absolutely delicious. Certainly a bit time-consuming but totally worth it. I think it would work equally well as a vegetarian version if you skipped the sausage altogether and added more spinach instead. I look forward to trying that next time!

Greatest lasagna ever. Since its alot of work, it's worth making several batches at once and freezing some of them in oven ready pans. I've made it with reduced fat and no fat ricotta on some occaisions, and it didn't suffer at all.

I was surprised at how delicious this recipe turned out. The red and black peppers are a must -- they add a nice "bite" to the dish. I didn't have all the ingredients at home when I made this recipe, so I used the following ingredients, instead: 1 LB smoked, fully cooked Hillshire sausage, casing removed, finally chopped and added to the spicy tomato sauce (omit sauteing sausage in olive oil and omit the olive oil used to cook it). I used 18 slices of provolone cheese (6 per layer, about 14 ounces total) instead of grating it (thickness should be the same as the lasagna noodles). Now, as for the Spicy Tomato Sauce, I substituted the 3 cans of tomatoes for 2 26.5-ounce Delmonte Traditional Spaghetti sauce and 1 8-ounce plain tomato sauce (the kind that has no sugar or seasonings added to it). I used a medium sweet onion and large garlic cloves. Once you add the spaghetti sauce and tomato sauce to the onion mixture, you will only need to cook the sauce for about 30 minutes, instead of 1 hour and 15 minutes. The sauce turned out very tasty and there was no need to season it to taste with salt and pepper. Hope you enjoy this recipe as much as my friends and I did!

Delicious! I served it at a dinner party to a couple of self-proclaimed "lasagna snobs" and they asked for the recipe. My husband has eaten the leftovers for three days in a row and still loves it. I used regular spicy sausage (not turkey). Also, if you cook it the day before and then reheat, be sure to bring it to rrom temperature first because it took forever to warm up.

Boy, what a project making a good worthy Lasagna can be! Instead of making the sauce I used 2 jars of the Classico Basil Tomato sauce and added the dry ingredients with the wine as stated simmering in a small pot.For the ricotta stuffing I used 1/2 Tablespoons of the herbs.The sausage used was Cantella's chicken and turkey sausage with dried tomatoes, olives and feta cheese which I crumbled up in my food processor. Instead of provolone I used extra sharp cheddar with fabulous results!I put all of the fixings in a big 9"x 15" pan so this was a large lasagna for two people.I froze half of it and refrigerated 5 servings for the rest of the week!I will definitely make this one again!

Rating: 4
changes I made...used reg pork sausage-mild. had the wrong size pan, so I had to use more noodles, but that was okay because I doubled the sauce recipe based on other reviews so I had plenty to use for the recipe and for serving. Husband was a little concerned about not pre-boiling the noodles, but even he had to admit that they turned out just perfect. Not mushy and not to firm. Do use a pan underneath your baking dish, it will "bubble" over. First attempt at lasagna, did take some time but well worth the effort, received many compliments and requests for the recipe. Thumbs up, way up for this recipe and it's sauce!

I've been making this recipe regularly since it was published. A major hit, every time. I use twice the amount of tomato sauce, and use hot italian sausage, for our tastes. Full flavor, a very satisfying meal. Freezes perfectly, too. My husband calls the foil wrapped bars in the freezer "bars of gold".

i followed this recipe pretty much to the tee it is baking in the oven and i am very excited about the results. the sauce tastes fabulous and i agree with other reviewers there is not enough sauce. i don't eat meat so i substituted boca italian sausage which worked better than great. i also used cottage cheese instead of ricotta. definitely will make this time and again.

EASY CLEAN-UP TIP: Brush the pan with a mixture of 2 parts liquid lecithin and 1 part oil. Liquid lecithin is available at health food stores. Use this mixture for baking bread, casseroles etc. and the food won't stick at all!

I agree there's not enough sauce for serving with the lasagne (recipe seems to imply there once was, so maybe it's been altered and now it all goes in to help with the no-boil pasta, which is why some peoples' boiled over?). I make double sauce (why not, it freezes), use about 5 cups of sauce (or more if it looks dry, or less if I'm using watery veggies like zucchini or mushrooms) and then I have plenty for passing at the table and even some for another quick supper some other day. That is the best tomato sauce, I could never open a jar in place of it.

Rating: 4
This is one of the best lasagnas I have ever made. Really yummy! I also used a combination of mozzerella/provolone and sweet turkey sausage instead of hot for the kids sake. One question I have is it says in the recipe to serve some of the leftover sauce with the lasagna, but should you remove some sauce from the pan before adding the sausage of just serve it as is. Also, I ended up using all the sauce in the recipe with no leftover. Definetley put foil or something under the dish in the oven for the sauce that boils over. That way, no mess in the oven.

This was a great receipe! I couldn't find Hot Turkey Italian Sausage, so I used a Mild version (and 2 lbs instead of 1 1/4). I also added in about 1 tsp of Cayenne to spice it up and 8 oz of mushrooms (sauteed in the oil before adding in the turkey). It came out WONDERFUL! I'd definitely make this again.

Made this twice already. Used hot italian sausage instead of turkey sausage. As one rater suggested I put the tomatoes in the blender for a few seconds. Used grated italian cheeses instead of provolone. The dry pasta worked out great. Got rave reviews both times, and even the kids would eat it. Froze the leftovers and they were good too.

This was not as hard or time consuming as other reviews led me to believe. Everyone in the family loved it. It did have some spice but certainly was not to hot. I did use 4 1/2 lasagna noodles in each layer and there was still enough liquid to make the noodle al dente.

This has become a hit at my house on several occassions now. As one person commented, it's worth making extra sauce simply to have on hand for spaghetti or whatever pasta dish...if you like spicy, that is, and we do! FYI, I haven't used no-boil noodles, but rather just the regular kind. And they cook just fine, given the high liquidity of the dish.

This has been our "house" lasagne for 2+ years and I have yet to have a guest who doesn't beg for the leftovers. It is simply outstanding.

This is the best lasagna dish that I have ever made! Please don't rely on the comments from people who said this was time-intensive. To make truly good lasagna - I expect it to take some time; that's what cooking is all about! I made a few changes to this recipe: I cooked the spicy tomato sauce pretty much exactly the same, except added completely fresh herbs (especially the marjoram), then I pureed about 3/4 of the sauce in a food processor. Plus, even though it says no need to pre-boil the noodles, I did any to acheive a more consistent layering and cooking effect. The sauce/cheese portions were perfect though I did mix half/half provolone and mozzarella. I was actually able to fit about 4 layers of noodles in the lasagna pan. Who cares if it boils over - just make sure to place it on a baking sheet. One minor change - 10 minutes before it was done remove the tinfoil, pile some leftover cheese mixture on top, and broil until brown & crispy. And Enjoy!!!

Although I received favorable reviews for this time-intensive recipe I think I will go back to my basic (no-boil) recipe. This dish did look nice though.

My husband says it's the best lasagna he's ever had. I followed the advice of previous reviewers and substitued fresh herbs for dried and added other vegetables (zucchini and mushrooms). I also used high quality aged parmesan, freshly shredded and substituted low fat mozzarella for half of the provolone.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious. Made a few substitutions/additions: - fresh spinach, basil, and mushrooms - 1/2 ground beef & 1/2 turkey sausage On one hand, it made the lasagna brim over, so now I have to clean the oven :( Next time I will definitely put it on a cookie sheet. On the other hand, it was delicious!

.I loved this recipe! It was so easy and quick to make. I tweaked the ingredients slightly: I put 6 ounces each of pancetta and prociutto diced finely and sauteed them with the onions in the sauce, added ground round as well as the hot sausage, then added a pound of crushed tofu and lemon zest and lemon juice, a grating of fresh nutmeg and dollop of honey in the ricotta mixture. In about an hour I had it in the oven and got two dinners and a lunch for two people.

Rating: 3
Great flavor out of an easy recipe - what a deal! Having lived in a part of the world where ricotta cheese did not exist, I found a great low-fat substitute - silken tofu. The texture is about the same and the tofu absorbs the flavors of everything around it. So I tried it again since returning to the US, and my guests had no clue! The only thing to remember is to not overbeat it, otherwise you will lose the ricotta like consistency.

My Italian husband loved this recipe - although I had to provide him with limited information on the exact ingredients - as it would not have been authentic enough for him. A great recipe - and I would definitely make it again and again. My husband loved it!!!

This is one of the best lasagna recipes I've ever tasted. It was so much more flavorful than other varieties. A few changes -- I ran out of provolone cheese, so I used half mozzarella, half provolone. Also, since the sauce is pretty spicy, I used sweet Italian turkey sausage.

I found this dish very easy to make once I had all the ingredients prepped.It was well worth the effort. I added a pound of very lean organic beef to the Italian sausage and it worked wonderfully. I also used low-fat ricotta and it still was very rich. I will definitely make this again and again.

Great lasagna, very flavorful--I made it exactly as the recipe indicated. Just enough kick to be interesting for my in-laws from India, but not so much that my sister-in-law who's nursing her baby had to skip it. I found the sauce made just enough for the lasagna & extra to serve on the first round, but not enough for the leftovers--but that was ok as the lasagna on its own is great. I'll be making this again, and freezing it for easy weeknight dinners.

Rating: 3
Not the quickest recipe, but very tasty. I used fresh spinach and it worked fine. I made the sauce a little too quick; could have used a little more juice. I might have used a larger than specified container, but the layering was different for me. But again, it was great.

My husband is a culinary nightmare. He suprised me on his day off and made this for me. It was wonderful! The best part of it was the tomato sauce. He would have made it exactly as the recipe called for because he would not know any substitutions. We are going to make a big batch of the tomato sauce alone and make if for other things. I would actually double the tomato sauce if I made it to make it nice and juicy. Way to go honey! I am so proud of you!

Rating: 3
This was my Saturday cooking project...Good thing. Between the sauce and assembling this thing, it took a while to get this whole thing together. But it was definitely worth it! I think this is just yummy and look forward to making it again. A nice switch from traditional lasagne. Substitutions: I had fresh spinach on hand and used it, but it made mixing the ricotta cheese filling difficult. Also realized at the last minute I didn't by cream, so I used skim milk instead. Didn't seem to make a difference. I think you could easily skip the sausage if you wanted to make this meatless, it would still turn out great.

Rating: 4
I've made this dish a few times. I substituted Half and Half for the whipping cream and I used a low-fat ricotta without any loss in flavor -- the dish is plenty rich without the full-fat versions. It is the best lasagna I've ever had (and the best some of my friends and family have ever had).

Rating: 4
My husband and I loved this recipe. It was moist, it fit in a normal size 9X13 and I didn't need extra sauce. I only used 1# of hot Italian turkey Sausage, I used low fat ricotta, fresh parmesan, a little fresh basil in the filling, 6 regular & 3 no boil noodles (had on hand). I simmered the sauce for 1 hour adding the cooked sausage the last 10 minutes. I also reduced the lasagna cooking time to 45/15. This is a keeper recipe. Next I want to try the Sausage & Basil Lsagna recipe from 2/2000.

This was delicious. I used spicy italian chicken sausage and would like to try with other flavored sausages. The dish was quite salty, with the salt in the sausage and the parmesean. Next time, I will only use 1/2 the parmesean. By the time the dish had finished cooking, the meat had given the sauce an extremely salty flavor, so watch out when seasoning the spicy tomato sauce. Serves 10 people. I used a disposable aluminum pan, and no there was no mess, an it fit perfectly! I followed an earlier tip of adding 1 1/2 cups water to the sauce when cooking it (and an extra 1/2 cup of crushed tomatoes), and somehow, still ended up with 6 1/2 cups of sauce! Which was JUST enough to follow the recipe, but not enough to serve with leftovers, but my dish didn't really need it, thank goodness. With some minor tweaking, this is a star!!

The fact that the noodles are self-cooking is fabulous! Abbondanza!

The first time I made this recipe, I placed the dish on the table and left the room to answer the door. As I returned to the dining room, I heard my husband..."mmmm...mmmm." He was incoherant for a while, and finally was able to announce that this is the best lasagna dish he has ever eaten! One tip...I think that it needs a little more oregano...and I added just a touch of fennel. Yum.

Fantastic! I was also a little unsure about using uncooked noodles, but the result was perfect. I made this for Valentine's Day and my husband and 10 month old daughter loved it.

In a word--DELICIOUS! I was very skeptical of putting the noodles in uncooked, but the resulting perfectly cooked lasagna was such a treat. I added 1/12 cups water to the sauce as it simmered, which cooked down to a little under 10 cups of total sauce. I USED EVERY DELICIOUS ounce of this perfect sauce. I also used 3 cups of mozzerella and 1 cup of provolone. I would reccommend using an aluminum pan as my standard glass 13x9 inch pan would not have been large enough to comfortably accommodate this monstrous delicacy. I will definitely make this again using even more provolone next go round!

Great recipe. I couldn't find hot turkey sausage so I used hot Italian instead. Also, I have a hard time getting sausage to crumble nicely when cooking it, so after it is browned, I put it in the food processor for a quick turn or two to get it into samller bits. Also, I followed suggestions and made 1 1/2 times the sauce and when the recipe said 1 cup, I would maybe add 2. Came out great--pan was a mess--next time I'll use foil pans!

Recipe worked well. Liked the sauce. Did not use cream and I don't think that makes a difference. The lasagna was a little dry, so I made a quick sauce and served it with the meal.

I didn't follow the recipe verbatim, however the ricotta cheese mixture was very flavorful. I also used spiced gourmet sausages which added an interesting layer of flavor to it. The family loved it! If you have no time to make the spicy tomato sauce, sweat some onions, garlic (be careful not to burn them) canned chopped tomatoes, a few TBS of tomato paste or pesto, a little vegetable or chicken stock for a little body and red pepper flakes will do the job in 15 minutes.

This is so worth the time to prepare. I am not know for my skills in the kitchen but this recipe helped me fool everyone! A huge hit.

A keeper. The sauce is the best! I used chicken sausage ( not spicy) and mozzarella and asiago cheese in place of provolone.You may want to make extra sauce for the side. There is just enough to assemble the lasagna. Time consuming but easy compared to many lasagna recipes.

This lasagna was absolutely incredible- and I don't even like lasagna that much. I made it twice in one week. It is time-consuming, but you can make most of it ahead. I made the sauce one night, assembled the lasagna & baked it the next night, and reheated/served it the next. Everyone loved it.

Wow! I grew up on italian food and this lasagna was delicious. Not only was it easy to make but it did not fall apart when I served it. I followed the recipe to the "T" with the turkey sausage. I will definitey make it again.

Best lasagna I've made! I substituted fresh tomatoes and herbs from my garden (doubled the amount of herbs). I also doubled the spice and used hot Italian sausage - it was perfect! The dollops of ricotta on the top get nicely browned and the lasagna just looks really interesting. Next time I will make more sauce so I have enough to serve on the side.

It makes a great lasagna, but this is extremely rich with all that cheese. Next time, I might add more crushed red pepper to the sauce itself (my husband and I like SPICY) and perhaps try to cut down on the amount of cheese. Also, make sure to add _plenty_ of sauce inbetween layers or it gets dry.

We used no fat ricotta and left out the cream, forgot to get the onion for the sauce, and substituted mozzarella for the provolone, and this was still outstanding. Would easily feed 8 people.

EXCELLENT! MY HUSBAND COULDN'T GET ENOUGH. RESTAURANT QUALITY. WILL MAKE IT FOR COMPANY. BE SURE TO USE EXTRA LARGE PAN AND SERVE EXTRA SAUCE ON THE SIDE.

I used the egg roll/lasagna "wraps" from the produce dept to get the no-boil lasagna and they worked well and tasted good. I also used fresh oregano and basil. I could get hot Italian sausage, so I used turkey breakfast sausage. it worked OK. I used one 1/2 t hot peppers in the spicy tomato sauce and it was still very spicy. Also a little too salty for me - probably because I used mmore provolone. My husband loved it!

Great recipe, not watery like some I have tried.
