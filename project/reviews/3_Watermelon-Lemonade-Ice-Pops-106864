Simply fabulous. I actually served this as a drink (of course thinned with a little water and it was awesome. I also froze the juice as ice cubes and added them to a watermelon mixed drink and it turned out great.

We have made these the past 2 years for our annual 4th of July party. It has been a hit! Very refreshing.

I am fortunate to live where really great watermelons are plentiful in summer. I used this recipe, without the extra sugar, and froze it in my ice cream freezer to make a sorbet rather than popsicles. It was delicious! Very refreshing. I also will use less lemonade next time, as it was a bit too sweet. Looking forward to watermelon season now!

These were awful. My kids and I liked other popsicle recipes on the same page. But this one was both too sweet and too sour, too much like eating pure lemonade concentrate.

These are excellent when you are really hot. The texture is wonderful -- not too icy, like some homemade popsicles. In fact, I had a problem with some of them falling apart before I pulled them out. They can be too strong-tasting at times, but when you really need something cold and refreshing, this is the ticket. I'm going to make them again!

This was good, but like the last reviewer said, it was more lemony than watermelony. I think I would use less lemonaid concentrate or more watermelon next time.

These were good. I think the lemon flavor predominated, but even the kids liked them. Maybe my watermelon wasn't all it should have been. I'd make them again.
