I made this for Valentine's Day dinner and it was a huge success. I used 4 lobster tails instead of whole lobsters and cut the breading in half. Lobster stood up perfectly to the spice. Lemon rice was super tangy and the perfect foil for the lobster. (I used 1/2 stock & 1/2 water). Fried basil was just slightly too oily, but I think drying the leaves would help. Went perfectly with a lemongrass martini,

I made this specifically for the rice (which I paired with mahi mahi). If I hadn't added lemon zest, I would have pronounced it insipid and called it a day. I won't be making it again with these measurements and ratios of lemon and garlic to chicken stock and rice.

Didn't make the lobster but only the rice, as a side for mahi mahi. -Meh. If I hadn't added some lemon zest, I'm not sure I would have identified the rice as "lemon", as opposed to just savory. It was okay, but not an outstanding rice.

I made this recipe with shrimp because I can't even bring myself to boil live lobsters, much less cut them up. It was very tasty and if you skip frying the basil (as I did), quite easy to make despite the long list of ingredients. I also dialed the heat back to half strength. We were aware of the spice but, not focused on it so, it was perfect for us.

I'll be the first. This was delicious, although I would elect to use shrimp or even chicken next time. The spice simply overpowered the lobster. Without a doubt, the lemon rice was the perfect foil to the spicy sauce and protein. My husband and I both wanted seconds.
