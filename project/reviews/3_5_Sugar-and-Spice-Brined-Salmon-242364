Excellent brine. We don't have a smoker so we grilled our salmon on a cedar plank -- wonderful! I could see where the fish would work really well in a dip too.

Tried this on the weekend. My tasters loved it. I could have marinated it a bit more than the 1.5 hours - salmon was about 25 mm thick. Will definitely do this again. Moose Morin

I have used this recipe many times before I smoke bluefish, bass or whatever fish I can cook on the grill. If I am grilling half the fish, I will leave the scales on and put that side down above the smoker box. At times I have substituted rum or gin for the vodka, all with delicious success with a slight variation in taste. Everyone loves it, even those who do not normally like fish. I serve it with crackers.
