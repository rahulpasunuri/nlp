This is a very delicious sauce and a great acccomapniment to a dish of vegetables. My suggestion is as everyone else, don't add the water. I had a bag of mixed frozen vegetables from Costco which I used. I always steam in a skillet (no oil) the vegetables cooking them in the frozen moisture in the vegetables. When the were crisp tender I added this sauce. It was wonderful. It is more than enought sauce for four servings. I would make this recipe for a serving for eight and it would be very ample.

This is a great base sause to be creative with. I have used different vegi's and more spices. I have even used it in a soup. All my friends love it.

Doubled the recipe and omitted the water; otherwise, followed as written. Tasty but not pretty. I took to a large gathering and one guest commented that while to not attractive it was very tasty. I guess I should work on presentation. Family loved it - a great meatless dish.

I loved it -- I followed other's suggestions and didn't use the water. I also used fat free half and half and had no problems. Yum.

I've served this several times to different people and it is always well received, even though I change the vegetables each time and omit the cinnamon. It is the sauce that makes this a good recipe. Follow everyone's recommendations - no water, heavier seasoning, vegetables of your choice - and it should turn out very tasty.

A great Indian dish. I've made it several times. I don't measure much, but I'm sure I use a lot more cauliflower. I use fat-free half-n-half for health reasons (enough to give the right consistency), no water, more cashews, and at least double the spices, especially more cayenne. Also use cilantro for flavoring (~1/4 cup), not just as a garnish. Good with Indian Baked Rice.

I liked this recipe very much. I'm a vegetable nut, and this really fit the bill for me. A bit time-consuming, but worth it!

This was an easy and flavorful light meal. You can change the vegetables to suit your taste, but the sauce, raisins, and cashews are what make this so yummy.

I have Laxmi Hiremath's book Laxmi's Vegetarian Kitchen, and we've enjoyed many recipes from it. This recipe, unfortunately, didn't live up. I will make it again; however, I will NOT add water to the cream sauce which diluted the flavors. and I will use different vegetables.
