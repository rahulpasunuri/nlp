This dish was well worth the work. I admit that I did cheat though. I used King Crab instead of the lobster. It really simplified the recipe and tasted as sweet and terrific. I did have to chase around a bit to locate the mushroom types but I have never served a dish that got such high raves. I definitely will make this again for my next dinner party......
