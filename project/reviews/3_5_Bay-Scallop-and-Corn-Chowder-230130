This recipe is a challenge but when the kinks are worked out it will be great. I followed the order of the recipe except I added 1/4 cup of sherry to 1/2 cup of clam juice for the cobs, Before the leeks or vidalia onion I cooked .25 pound of pancetta and left it in with the onions.I would cut back on the flour in the slurry by 1/4 cup. I added 2 more garlic cloves thyme, bay and nutmeg. Also added black pepper and salt (about 1 1/2 teaspoons) Make sure to double cut the corn (a thin cut down the cob and then another cut to the cob). Because much fresh corn in now sweet I had to add juice from 2 1/2 lemons.

This was really boring even with all the additional spicing up. I added extra garlic, thyme, extra cayenne, nutmeg, vermouth, fresh ground pepper, and sherry. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.

My family declared this "deliciously yummy." I wonder if the "bland" comments were due to insufficient seasoning/salt? It took several large pinches of salt before I felt it had enough. I'm just sayin'.... Anyway, I made some changes but kept it pretty low fat -- 8 oz of clam juice and approx 1 tsp of Better than Bullion seafood base & 3/4 C sherry/vermouth blend. Increased garlic to 5 cloves, subbed a large shallot and a medium vidalia onion for the leek. I crisped a few pieces of bacon (cut up) then poured off most of the drippings -- left enough to cover the bottom in the pot - and used that to sautee the garlic/shallot/onion mixture, then added the liquid to the pot along with the corn cobs (used 4 small) and simmered them in the liquid. Also added a bay leaf, grated nutmeg, thyme, herbs de provence and shallot pepper. After removing the corn cobs and adding the corn & scallops, I used a slurry of cornstarch & sherry to thicken. (I also used on good sized potato and did not peel.) Sprinkled a little of the bacon pieces and some ancho chili powder (we were out of cayenne?! - don't know how that happened!) in bowls before serving. I will definitely be making this again.

I was concerned about whether this recipe would be too bland, because, frankly, as drafted IT IS BLAND. It never ceases to amaze me to see people complain about a bland recipe such as this which involves 1/8 tsp cayenne in SIX CUPS OF LIQUID, mixed with flour and potatoes no less!! So, like other reviewers, I jazzed up the taste somewhat. I added a bay leaf, thyme (a seafood chowder without thyme? whoever heard of such a thing), basil, oregano, salt, pepper and to top it all off, I stole an idea from another recipe and added two Anise stars for some crazy complexity. Result: awesome. Four forks awesome. But I couldn't give this recipe four forks because, as I might have mentioned above, it is bland as written. I also worried about whether five minutes would be enough time for the raw scallops to get to know the rest of their friends in the pot, particularly when the mixture wasn't boiling or close to boiling. I went closer to 15 minutes. Finally: if you can, use the prosciutto. If you aren't willing to experiment with other spices, at least a spicy bacon will do something to give some life to this dish. Enjoy!

My whole family loves this yummy chowder! This is the second time I've made it and it seems to be fool proof :)

Instead of adding bay scallops, I bought sea scallops and seared them in olive oil. I then placed one scallop in the center of each bowl and garnished with a chive.

My husband and I prefer a richer soup, so I made a few changes to the recipe. I eliminated the flour, because the potatoes and corn cobs do a nice job of thickening the soup. I also used full-cream half-and-half (rather than non-fat version called for) and salt-free butter, rather than canola oil. I served the soup with a crusty French bread. This makes a tasty and comforting chowder thats perfect for a cool autumn evening. Ingredients I used: 3 ears of corn, kernels cut from the cob; 1 cup frozen yellow corn kernels; 28 oz clam juice, reduced to approx 2-1/2 cups; 2 tsp salt-free butter; 2 leeks, sliced, white and pale green parts only; 1 rib celery, diced; 2 cloves of garlic; 2 cups 2-percent milk; 3 potatoes, peeled and diced; 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper; 1 lb bay scallops; 12 oz uncooked shrimp, shells and tails removed; 2 cups half-and-half; 4 slices prosciutto; 3 oz basil, chopped; fresh chives; freshly ground pepper and salt to taste.

I made this soup for the first time tonight, and although it certainly wasn't bad, I did think that it tasted quite bland. In fact, it tasted a lot like flour. I think if I try this again I will make far less of the half n half/flour mixture. It was just too thick and tasted like flour.

YUM!!! Used the slurry as called for - and was JUST great. My only change was that I used pancetta instead of prosciutto (it's what I had) and quartered sea scallops instead of bay scallops. A keeper.

A really good recipie that my wife and I loved. I too used heavy cream. I also used sea scallops and quartered them instead of using bay scallops.

I used heavy cream instead of the slurry. My wife said it was the best chowder she ever had. Will definitely make again.
