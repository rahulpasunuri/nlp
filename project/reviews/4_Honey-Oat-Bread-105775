I just finished making this and it is fantastic. It is chewy and a bit sweet -- just right for eating plain, or as toast with homemade berry jam, or for a sandwich. I added a Tablespoon of flaxseed (ground) when I added the oats. I will make this again and again. It is easy and delish!!

This is fantastic, really delicious. And fairly easy, though I've found some bread mixes that are even easier: www.bakedbetter.com. The Park Slope Staple is hardy and I added honey to it to be a bit more like this recipe.

I made this recipe with rapid yeast. If using rapid yeast, do not dissolve the yeast in warm water. Put in all the ingredients, excluding the water, (i used about 4 cups of flour) with the yeast on top. Then add the water (making it a tad warmer than the recipe calls for, about 120 degrees) and massage to make the dough. I kneaded the dough by hand for about 5 minutes. Skip the first rise and go right to forming rolls or loaves. Put in a warm oven covered with a towel and let rise for one hour. This significantly decreases the amount of time spent making this and it turns out perfect. This bread is delicious! I made dinner rolls and got 15 out of the recipe.

i have had good results with this recipe but i was wondering if some one could tell my why you add the flour to the water in this case, when my bread book says that you should always add the water into the flour? this method seems to make more sense because what if you dont need all the flour??

I was a little confused whether or not to knead this dough after reading the reviews. (The recipe doesn't say to.)So what I did is kneaded it a little bit, but just to form the soft dough ball. The rising time for me was perfect. I didn't have to use the extra time suggested. But what I can suggest for those who needed a longer time, is to boil a kettle and put the hot kettle beside the dish, under the dish towel, to create a warmer environment. The recipe didn't take the 5 cups of flour; it was more like 4 cups. Overall, a beautiful bread. Very rustic, great for breakfast!

I just ate the first slice! its incredible!!! I too let it rise for longer then the suggested hour. I was still unsure about the recipe while putting the loaves in the oven. But... when i opened the oven door to check on the loaves...I was very impressed. Its a wonderful looking bread with great taste!

I made this bread this afternoon and it tastes fabulous! It didn't, however, rise very well. In fact, the loaves are flat on top. I have made bread many times before and this hasn't happened until recently when I moved to the coast. Could living at sea level cause this? I didn't knead the bread as the instructions indicated not to. Should I next time? Add more yeast? More flour? Not sure how to fix a flat loaf...

This bread was easy..although I did knead it and rose nicely, but we all found it too sweet, I think as another reviewer mentioned if fruit and cinnamon were added it would suit the bread but like this it seems too sweet for a savoury bread but not sweet enough for a sweet bread.

I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and old fashioned oats instead of quick oats. Added 1 tbsp of vital wheat gluten. Great bread!

I have been making this bread for quite some time. I do follow the recipe, except that I knead the bread using my dough hook on my Kitchen Aid mixer. Just out of curiousity, I will try it some time without kneading. It is a good bread, freezes well, but usually gets eaten quickly, before it can get ot the freezer.

I can't believe its so easy! Tastes, looks, and has a better consistency than breads I have made that take literally all day to prepare. My husband and 4yr old found it especially yummy. Definitely a keeper!

It's a great recipe, turned out light and filling at the same time. But I agree with everyone else that it took a while to rise. No big deal, though. I'll definitely be making it again.

I used the ingredients as is (with the exception of reducing the salt to one teaspoon) but simplified the process by using a bread machine to mix and proof the dough. My family was very happy with the soft interior texture and the thin, slightly crisp crust. Both loaves were gone within the hour.

It took forever to rise, but turned out alright. I am at 7000 ft in elevation, and I don't think the bread turned out quite right. This was my first time making "rising" bread. Any tips for high altitude bread baking?

Made this recipe in my breadmaker. Put in all ingredients at once on "bread" cycle. It turned out great. A tiny bit too much volume for my machine. Will reduce amounts slightly next time.

You don't have to knead this bread. I stirred the ingredients together with about 4 1/2 cups of flour, squished it around a little in the bowl, and then let it rise. It was a horrible looking, sticky, mangled looking hunk of dough. But I let it rise (for about 2 hours instead of one), then patted it with some flour and separated it in half, it still being very loose, soft and sticky, and put it into a couple of pans. Once again, I doubled the rising time, and then finally baked it, and it turned out perfectly. I took one loaf to work and people thought I had bought it at a bakery. It's really tasty, easy and has a great texture. I'm a horrible baker, and I was able to pull this off, so you certainly can too.

This was fine, but there are so many other bread recipes out there that just have more flavor. I make my own bread because I love the intensity of the flavor; this bread REQUIRES the honey and butter on the side, whereas some other homebaked breads are good enough to eat plain - without extra calories. If I were to make it again, I would try adding cinnamon and golden raisins to the dough. I did like the oats on top, but I might just use that technique with other breads. To make this bread more interesting, I made a spread of softened butter mixed with honey, cinnamon and vanilla extract. I mashed it all together in a bowl until unified, then put it back in the fridge. Now, when I want to spread it on the bread, it's all together. The addition of vanilla and cinnamon makes it more intense, so you can use less - that means fewer calories!

I was delighted to find this recipe. I am from England and I stayed at the Green Mountain Inn in November 1998. There is no food in the world to compare with New England food as far as I am concerned and I am always searching this website for new American recipes to try. This bread is wonderful! So easy to make and so reminiscent of the honey oatmeal bread I enjoyed at the Green Mountain Inn, Stowe, Vermont. Thank you so much for this recipe - my husband also loves it and I aim to make this bread time and time again!

This is such delicious bread! First time I made it to go with my friend's excellent greek chicken soup, and the response was 'Oh my god this is sooooooooooooooo good'. I made it in roll form to make it easier to serve. Since then I make it regularly.

Easy, easy, easy. Yummy, yummy, yummy. My one change to this recipe is to make 1 1/2 times the recipe amount so that the two resulting loaves are larger, i.e the same size as a typical sandwich loaf.

This bread is so delicious! Also a very easy recipe for first time bread bakers. Light and fluffy, slighty sweet, wonderful with a bit a honey butter on top. Serve toasted or fresh from the oven - great! The time did vary, it took 2 hrs for the first rise and about 45 min for the second, but well worth it.

I have been looking for a simple but good tasting bread recipe. This is it! I allowed the bread to rise for double the amount of time as stated in the recipe. I think that was the key for it to feel so light but flavorful. The bread tasted great with butter and all week I toasted it (with peanut butter and jam) for breakfast. Love this bread!

I've made this bread several times with so-so results, but finally got it right by accident. A forgotten appointment enforced a doubled rising time and the bread's texture improved greatly as a result. I guess to a more experienced baker, it would only make sense that a recipe from a Vermont Inn would need to rise longer when baked only 25 feet above sea level. Serving suggestion: use a dark, rich honey such as bamboo flower for a deeper flavor than the standard honey bear imparts.

I've made this twice in one week, once with honey and once with molasses. Both versions are delicious! To each loaf (I made one large loaf each time, instead of 2) I added some wheat bran. The second time, I used regular rolled oats (not quick-cooking) and the bread turned out fine, so if you like a heartier texture, try that. I'll keep making it, and keep experimenting with fun add-ins. A note for high-altitude cooks--1/3 cup of sweetener is plenty, and you'll need to bake the bread a little longer than the recipe states.

This recipe is great but, if your making it and it looks like it is really not riseing continue and don't loose hope. When I made mine a piece of paper looked thicker when the bread was suppose to be rising, but my whole family ate the first loave in 5 minutes! Have fun cooking:)

Fantastic. Easy. Great for winter mornings or afternoons. Everyone loves it.

I halved the recipe (only because I didn't have enough flour) and made only one loaf. It needed longer rising time and shorter baking time (30 minutes). It is delicious and beautiful.

This makes a very light, delicious loaf with almost no effort. I substituted whole wheat flour, and it still rose quickly and baked up light and delicious. I had no trouble with the rising time, the second rise was indeed only 20 minutes. Excellent for toast.

to answer the baker's question below: yes, you do have to knead after addition of flour. just mix all ingredients as explained in the recipe and when you have them all in a soupy bowl, add in the flour. i start with about 4-4.5 cups of flour and add more as needed. the full 5 cups is rarely needed. after flour is added, knead for 10+ minutes before letting rise.

WOW! This is sooo good and foolproof. I love to bake, but have had little luck with yeast breads. Decided to try this one today. My 5 and 3 year olds did most of the mixing and measuring, so I was sure that someting would be over worked or "off". But, it came out perfect! Great taste and texture. Will be our regular bread from now on!

Just took the loaves out of the oven about ten minutes ago...WOW! Yummy warm. Remarkably light which I didn't really expect. No problem with the dough rising. I used half honey/half molasses and wanted to use 1 cup whole wheat flour but due to atmospheric conditions here in DC, I ended up only needing a total of 4 1/2 cups flour so used only 1/2 cup whole wheat. Very nice -- pleasant taste and texture.

Easy, made a large baguette-style loaf. Just prep the dough and let rise until you have time for it...

Excellent Bread. Very easy. Bread is light and has excellent flavor. I added a little pinenuts, sunflower seeds, flax and sesame seeds,bulgar wheat and added 2 cups whole wheat flour with 3 cups plain flour (instead of 5 cups plain flour) to make a loaf with some texture. I also added 1/2 cup honey and it was perfect. I think it needed more honey as well. Great bread to use for sandwiches as well as by itself.

Are you supposed to knead the dough after you add the flour? Or just proceed as the recipe states....stirring in flour to make a soft dough. Something didn't work for me. Help!

I made this recipe the first time and the bread never rose - it came out heavy and just disgusting. Thank goodness I tried it again because every time since then it's come out just great - very light and just a tiny bit sweet...yum! I use Quaker old-fashioned oatmeal and blend it with the flour in my food processor to grind up the oats a little bit. Using a little more honey is good too. I've made it as free-form baguette loaves as well as pan rolls and and rounds. One tip though - definitely be patient with the rising time. I usually let it rise 1 1/2 hours the first time and an hour the second time. Also, baking it at a higher temp (450) makes the crust crisper and darker. Be sure to bake to and internal temp of at least 200 or else it will be doughy inside. Definitely try this bread!

Excellent bread but the directions are off a bit. The rising time is much longer than noted. It took at least 2 hours for the first rise and another 2 hours for the second rise. I used molasses in place of honey and also whole wheat flour in place of AP. It was worth the wait but I missed the timing on this so we were unable to have it with dinner but it made excellent toast in the morning.

This bread is the first I've ever made and it turned out delicious. I served it to my boyfriend and neighbor and they both loved it. I didn't have any loaf pans, however, so I simply formed the dough into two neat spheres and placed each on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. They baked beautifully and looked like the kind of bread you'd buy in gourmet grocery store.

This bread was pretty tasty, but nothing extraordinary. I might make it again, as it was easy and not too bad. I was a bit confused on how much flour to add, especially since there in no kneading, and the recipe is unclear on a few points. Also, the bread did not rise very well at all, and the loaves are a bit smaller than I expected, but the texture is about what bread is usually like.

I haven't made many yeast breads before, and was worried that this bread would not turn out b/c it did not rise as much as I expected. The dough was very sticky. But it turned out great, and smelled wonderful while it was baking.

doubled this recipe to make 4 good-sized loaves. it is an excellent, delicious bread. Easy recipe. I used instant yeast with perfect results. instead of egg wash, i melted butter with honey and brushed loaves before going into the oven and once they came out. used leftover butter/honey mixture for dipping. amazing!!

Yummy, yummy, yummy! This bread is very good and does not make a mess on either your counter or your hands! I've made it twice and will make it again many more times. It's slightly sweet which is perfect. I used melted butter instead of the oil and substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour for 1 cup of the all-purpose flour the second time I made it and it was just as delicious as the first time. I definately recommend this bread!

Is this absolutely the best oatmeal bread recipe I have ever found. The bread came out moist yet slightly heavy (not too airy) like good homemade bread should. A breeze to make. My husband ate a whole loaf by himself before it even cooled. Only adjustment: added 1/4 tsp sugar to the yeast and water during the 10 minute dissolving period.

I have never made bread, but when I realized I had all the ingredients for this, I thought "why not". It is really good and my family loved it!
