While the pie was good, it wasn't as tasty as a good old-fashioned double crust apple pie, so I wouldn't make it again.

This pie is great, I used the caramel sauce like the reviewer said, and it worked really well, no idea what the pie soup comment is about but this is a really delicious pie. This may be the only apple pie I make from now on.

I have been making this pie for 7+ years. I love everything about it! It's not one to serve right out of the oven or you will have "pie soup" as some have said. Let it stand and cool and it holds up just fine. I'm making another one this weekend because it got gobbled up by guests. Love, love, love it.

OMG: Don't agree with the reviewer who said this was apple soup and not worth making again. Also thanks to the reviewer who said be patient with the caramel. Almost gave up when I saw it congeal into hard candy when mixed with the apples. But I relaxed and went with it (as noted before me). Almost had to have a piece right out of the oven, but held back. The aroma will drive your family crazy. The pie has a great combination of flavors. I had no pumpkin spice so I used liberal 1/4 tsp ground cloves & ginger and 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon. Fantastic.

I have been making this pie every year since it was published in 1998. My family requests it every year and it has gone with my adult children to their friends' Thanksgiving celebrations to rave reviews. I thought I would include some of my tips and modifications to help first-time pie makers. My family likes a flavorful pie so I add one teaspoon each of cinnamon and ginger to the pie crust before I add the butter and I add one teaspoon of cinnamon and a quarter teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg to the apples. After I have poured the apples into the pie crust, if there is any hardened caramel left on the bottom of the bowl I either heat the bowl over the stove (metal) or put the bowl in the microwave (glass) until the caramel melts then pour it on top of the pie. I hope this helps.

One of my Thanksgiving Traditions!! I have made this several times and it is one of my all time favorites! You need to follow the directions carefully and dont be afraid if and when the caramel sticks to the bowl. Let it sit just like it says to release the juices then it will be easier to remove from the bowl. It is an amazing twist on a regular apple pie! Trust me, you will love it.

Terrible who wants pie soup? The serve over ice cream warning is just basically telling you they don't know how to make a pie.

This recipe is delicious. I followed the caramel instructions from the reviewer randomroyalty and that worked just fine, though you do need to be patient and stir alot. I planned on serving it with ice cream and so when it didn't come out in perfectly cut pieces, I was ok with that, somewhat expecting it.

This is a delicious pie. Be carefull however to choose a Deep-Dish. Mine was not deep enough and I had some caramel spill in the oven...

This was one of the most delicious pies I have ever made. It was pretty simple and enjoyed by all. The carmel hardened once it hit the apples, so I was worried, but once in the oven it all combined perfectly. I used Granny Smith Apples instead, which I think were better. I also made extra streusel. I have been asked numerous times to bring this dessert.

The problem with the caramel (making it, and the hardening effect when it hits the apples) can be overcome with a simple caramel sauce recipe. Heat 1 cup of white sugar gently over medium heat for about 15 minutes (important! NO WATER). It will turn into a dark amber liquid. Add 3/4 cup of water. The melted sugar will almost instantly harden into a clump of candy. Allow the water to boil gently. The hardened sugar will eventually dissolve, and the liquid will reduce. This takes another 5-10 minutes. Remove from heat and add the butter (3 tbsp) and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract (or to taste). Pour this sauce over the apples. Also I used spartan apples in this pie...goes much better with the caramel sauce!

This is the only apple pie I make. I'm not sure why others are saying it's not that great because I've never had any problems with the filling (and topping) being anything but delicious. Sometimes the caramel is tricky to make but totally worth it. I love this pie and am making it for my co-workers tomorrow!

Rating: 2
I've been making apple pies for years, and I decided to try out this one because the caramel intrigued me. Didn't have much trouble with the caramel hardening when I poured it over the apples, but the finished product was way too wet for me -- too many juices upon removing pieces of pie. Sure, the juices would be great over ice cream, but I'd rather have a thicker pie. I did like the streusel topping. I'll stick with other pie recipes in the future.

this pie is exceptionally good! i made it one year for my husband and dad, and they still say it was the best pie they've ever had. my dad grew up in the country, and they had apple trees, so my grandma was always making apple dishes and she was a wonderful cook, but my dad thought the pie was better! also, my husband's mother was a stay-at-home mom who cooked all the time and he liked the pie better, too!

Rating: 1
A waste of time. No problems making the caramel, but as others have stated, it basically dissipates in the pie and melds with the apple juices to make the pie wet and gloppy, with no discernible caramel flavor. There are plenty of other, better pie recipes out there.

I got this recipe last year in October since then any time I have a craving for apple pie I make this and every time I do it gets thats much easier to make.. Its wonderful! I've even made it for my family members as a holiday gift. We love it.. I will be making this one for years to come..

Rating: 1
i imagine that this tastes pretty good but I tried to make it this evening and the caramel went from a gorgeous amber to a burnt ocher in the time it took me to stir in the butter and reach over the apples. I think the gorgeous amber color is giving the average cook at home a little grace period.

I've made this pie every year for the past five years and my family loves it. The caramel is hard to manage but I layer it in a bowl with the apples so there is no need for a lot of mixing. It turns out great.

I'm not a big fruit pie fan, but I love carmel, apples and strudel, and this was a great way to combine them into a warm, traditional dessert. The carmel sauce must be closely attended to while boiling, but the rest was very easy to put together and turned out beautifully. I would definitely recommend using a deep dish pie pan.

Made this apple pie after reading some reviews...took in considerations and adjusted. I used Ida red and Macintosh apples, will try mixing in some Granny Smith next time. Because of the sweetness of this pie, you are better off using a tart apple. Made the caramel...very yummy..not too thrilled about the strusel topping.I think I will use my own recipe next time for the topping. However everyone else liked it..just my taste I guess. Also wasn't too thrilled with the crust.I'll use my own next time. Overall this is a delicious pie and with a few minor personal adjustments this will be an awsome pie.

Rating: 3
When I poured the caramel over the apples, it just hardened in the bowl. Next time I would put the apples in the pie shell and pour the caramel directly over them. Once baked, the caramel liquified again in the pie and was fine. The 1 hr and 10 mins was a bit long for baking time and the crust was slightly over done. I would take it out sooner next time.

Rating: 2
Used Granny Smith and made in individual pie dishes. Followed recipe and poured caramel over apples in bowl. Caramel didn't exactly coat apples, instead stuck to bowl. I wish I had first put the apples in shell and then poured caramel over them. Recipe was good, not my favorite - I'll keep looking.

Rating: 2
This is good but I didn't get the ooey, gooey-ness of caramel I was hoping for. Instead the caramel kind of glopped on the apples and then disapated during cooking. The caramel acted as more of sweetener than actually enveloping the apples to add depth to the pie. The crumb topping was yummy! Next time I'd skip the caramel and just add brown sugar and butter to the apples directly.

Rating: 3
Looked great, tasted good. I didn't have a lot of juices, and wished I had a little more. Used Granny Smith. Streusel topping was plenty, cannot understand how one reviewer could have used twice as much. Had trouble getting caramel out of bowl with apples, next time will try one reviewer's suggestion to put into foil-lined pie plate and invert. May also try non-stick foil as imagine caramel would stick to foil just as stubbornly as it sticked to aluminum mixing bowl. Did wish for a little more caramel flavor. Had no trouble making caramel, but did watch like a hawk. Used a little cream and some brandy instead of water at end of caramel making. Served plain, no ice cream, next time will definitely get ice cream.

Every year for the past 8 years I have taken my son to the apple orchard and picked apples and used them in this pie. After the first year I received rave reviews and have been requested to make it each year since! I, too, Have had difficulty with the caramel part at times (I usually make 2 or 3 pies a year and make each batch separately), but I've also just thrown it in with the apples anyway (as another cook mentions below) and it still turned out great! You may want to make a foil tent so the streusel doens't burnand remove it towards the end to get it crispier...

I used this recipe for a pie which I took to work as an entry in an apple pie bake-off contest. It won first prize! I made only one slight variation - add some oatmeal to the streusel to give the topping a crunchy texture. It's fantastic!

In response to the last poster, I've made this pie a couple of times. In an attempt to get my carmel to turn amber I cooked it too long or let it get too hot. My carmel also "seized". I was lazy and through it on the apples any way. Once baked it was great. i saw a candy making show that explained why the sugar mixure "seizes" it was either cooked too long or allowed toget too hot I recall. Try it again. It's always a family favorite. J.

i dont know what has happened. the first time i made this pie the caramel came out perfect. since then, each effort in making caramel has produced a dried out white mess in the bottom of the pan. it bubbles, hardens and becomes encrusted at the bottom of the pan. anyone have this problem? what am i doing wrong?

I thought this pie was so-so, but my relatives loved it. I think I prefer either plain apple or apple cranberry pie. It was the first time I made caramel, which was a bit scary, but it came out ok. It took more than double the suggested time for the sugar to turn amber. The caramel did congeal a little when it hit the apples, but after waiting the 10 minutes I was able to dissolve it a little with the juices from the apples. Although the caramel didn't dissolve totally and I ended up pulling it into smaller pieces and spreading it throughout the pie. It did dissolve when baked however and there were no caramel "clumps" in the finished pie. The only way I would make this again is if I get requests from the relatives, I didn't like it enough to make it worth the effort.

I thought this was just so-so; messy to make & clean up, I did not think it lived up to its name, as the caramel was hard to taste - it does not permiate the pie, but just lands up wherever you glop it. The crust was also just so-so, I've had, and have made, much better. To me, this was an ordinary diner-style apple pie, with globs of caramel on top. I did like the strusel topping, and will use that again for another recipe, maybe to top a fresh peach or rhubarb-strawberry pie. I think my poor review of this pie is in part due to my comparison of this recipe to another: A restaurant in our area makes the most WONDERFUL caramel apple pie and the restaurant version is just to die for: it is more of a true deep-dish pie, baked in a queche type pan, with a savory, buttery crust, and quite dense filling that I believe contains some amount of cream cheese and just a little bit of pumpkin or pumpkin pie spice - now that, is a caramel apple pie!

This was absolutely fabulous and my first time at making an apple pie of any sort! I was almost intimidated by the carmel process (from reading the reviews), but I took the advice of others, such as using ready-made carmel (Mazretti's) and I did add cinnamon to the apples. I also used cake flour for both the crust and strudel. Everyone raved about this pie and I felt so proud! Oh, I did use golden delicious apples with lemon to keep from getting dark.

This pie is wonderful. I make it every year for Thanksgiving and it's always the first to go. I sometimes make it in a regular pie pan too and it's great. It never hurts to add a little cinnamon too.

This is a great twist to a tradition. I used granny smith apples. Added 2 TBL spoons lemon juice to the sugar and 1/4 cup water for caramel. Cream instead of the last 2 TBL spoons of water. 2 TBL spoons vanilla before adding to apples nice touch. My sister isn't so comfortable in the kitchen so I had her melt a bag of store bought caramels, 1/4 cup milk, and vanilla for caramel sauce. Turned out great and a little easier.

I made 2. 1 using Johnagold and 1 using golden delicious. I didn't taste the delicious apple one. The apples were fresh, being Oct. in Ohio, and I am sure that improved the quality, but overall, I would even use store-bought apples & make this pie again and again. DELICIOUS

This is quite good. My husband didn't like it as well as my regular apple pie, but he is a purist...The caramel will turn hard when it hits the apples, but it softens again when you bake the pie. My only caution is that the caramel makes this quite sweet unless you use Granny Smith or other tart apples. I also put Calvados in the caramel.

I was in a hurry, so I cheated and used a frozen pie crust. I also used a variety of apples - Granny Smith, Braeburn, and Fuji - and added a bit of cinnamon to them. Other than that, I followed the recipe completely and the pie was delicious! And, I had no trouble at all with the caramel becoming too hard when I poured it over the apples...

This recipe made us swallow our tongues! It was nice to have the traditional apple pie but with a twist. The caramel added to the apples makes this dish along with the struesel topping. YUMMY! It's now on our holiday "must-haves".

I have been making this pie for a couple years now and love it. It's a great variation from a traditional apple pie but doesn't stray very far- because why would you want to? The caramel can present trouble (definitely the 1st time) but if you practice and get it right, it's great. I don't use golden delicious, though, usually half Granny Smith and half Figi or Gala. Use your favorite crust recipe if you don't like this one. The crumb topping is one of the great elements of this pie as well. Delicious!

I have made his many times with great reviews from guests. One thing I do differently is after tossing the apples with the caramel, I place it in the prepared pie crust, this avoids the caramel turning hard and having to use a chisel to remove them! Also, a 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice in the crust is a nice touch. My kids think this is the best pie I make all year!

I substituted granny smith apples in my pie because of their tartness and because I really like them. Unfortunately it may have been the reason that this pie ended up too watery. Next time, and there will be a next time, I will cook my pie a little longer. Overall a hit.

This recipe turned out an acceptable apple pie, but it was not what I expected. I ate a whole slice and only a couple of mouthfuls had any caramel flavor. This recipe has less than half the caramel it should have, and the caramel should contain lots of cream to keep it from turning into concrete when it hits the apples, as everyone else noted. It just doesn't work.

Davey- Caramel is really just cooked sugar. You can make your own, you don't need Kraft! This part here is where they tell you how to make the caramel: Stir sugar and 1/4 cup water in heavy large saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil until syrup turns deep amber color, brushing pan sides with wet pastry brush and swirling pan occasionally, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Add butter and remaining 2 tablespoons water (mixture will bubble vigorously). Return to heat and stir until smooth.

Maybe I am missing something, but I could find no place in the recipe that specified how much carmel or what kind (Kraft carmel candy or carmel ice cream topping) to use.

I can't believe I am about to type these words, but I thought this pie was way too sweet. The caramel was a bit problematic, in that it stuck to the bowl that I mixed the apples in and I practically had to chisel it off. I like the idea that another reviewer had to simply pour the hot caramel over the apples in the pie dish - everything melts together anyway to the extra mixing step seemed extraneous. I think that a top crust might be better than the topping called for in the recipe. My husband and I much prefer the Sour Cream Apple pie on this site (Gourmet November 1992), though I use the topping from this recipe instead of the one called for. It is fabulous.

Rating: 3
Delicious, but a little scary...what is going to happen when hot caramel hits cool apples? What is going to happen in the pie pan? No worries, though. It turned out lovely, but do mind the instruction to let it cool for an hour -- it really needs to be about room temp to cut well.

Rating: 3
I have made this pie a few times; it is delicious, but definitely needs care in the making. The crust is not firm enough, I use the incomparable recipe in "Joy" for the crust. The caramel should be removed from the heat the minute it turns light brown - if you wait till it's deep amber, it will be rock hard as soon as it cools down. That said, it is time consuming but absolutely wonderful.

Not so good- very strange texture to this pie- I followed Chicago/Pittsburg's suggestion and used Marzetti's fat free caramel dip instead of struggling with the caramel and was very disappointed. My pregnant friend was the only one who liked this pie. I used a pate brisee for the crust (as always) and thought the topping (while not at all crumbly) was decent. I wont waste my time or Gala apples on this recipe again.

"The best pie I've ever had" said my mother. I did it! I made the pie with some changes. No topping except a regular pie crust. I did not cook the caramel long enough and ended up draining most of it out with the excess apple juices. Threw the somewhat caramel coated apples in the pie shell, added some sugar and butter just in case and voila, a superb pie! Excellent pie, wonderful flavor and a great recipe that can handle variations.

As someone who constantly strives to make the best, this apple pie recipe may make it unnecessary to look further! It is absolutely delicious! When pouring the caramel over the apples, I thought it wouldn't work, as the caramel hardened up. But it did. And the pile of apples cook down to a lovely, full pie.

Rating: 3
The pie was delicious, but the carmel was a pain in the tush.My first attempt turned into a white hard mass (my fault-I did not desolve the sugar enough). The second attempt was better, but when I put it into the apples it turned into a brown hard mass that did not desolve. Short of it- I used 3/4 of a bag of Kraft Caramel (melted)and it turned out great. I am not sure I will attempt caramel any more. P.S. Be careful for burns!!!

Rating: 4
Delicious pie with fresh picked apples. I used half macintosh and half gala apples and since they were so tart, they cut the sweetness of the caramel. I also used a jar of butterscotch caramel sauce (they sell it in the ice cream topping section) rather than making my own caramel and added pumpkin spice and 2 tsp of cornstarch to the apples so there would be less juice. I also found that using cake flour rather than all-purpose makes the crust more flakey.

I was looking for an apple pie to bake for a family birthday - we always have apple pie for dessert ! I enjoy baking and this was a real treat. I added in a few ingrediants, eg cinnamon, brown sugar - just to give it that extra boost with the apples. This pie did not last 24hrs - the carmel does harden but you need to leave it sitting in the apples for a little bit longer than the time allowed, as the juices from the apple do extract and mix well with the carmel, before you add the mixture into the dish. I would most definately make this dish again !!

Rating: 3
I love the filling to this pie, but the streusel topping isn't my taste. I make it with a double crust--a tratitional looking apple pie. The filling is tricky. I use granny smith apples because they have a better texture and a nicer taste. When you pour the caramel over them it usually hardens, but don't worry. Just break it into pieces and distribute it throughout the pie. It will melt and spread as you bake. My husband loves this pie, so it is worth bearing with it.

I made this last night. Finished, it didn't really seem to be a "deep-dish" type of pie, but more like a regular pie with lots of apples. The strusel was great and I will make that again, the crust was just so-so. This pie did NOT compare to other deep dish caramel apple pies that I have had in restaurants; I thought it would be a lot better, but it is missing something in the filling and crust, maybe more of a cake-ish texture for the filling instead of plain ole apples with caramel poured on top. I probably will not make it again but continue my search for the perfect deep dish caramel apple pie! Homemade "regular" apple pie is a lot better than this recipe, in my opinion. The caramel melted into the pie fine, but I thought the finished product left a lot to be desired. Oh well!

This is the Apple Pie I have been looking for all my life ... simply superb ...

I have made this pie for 3 Thanksgivings in a row: Each time the audience enjoyed it thoroughly. I have had all the "bad" caramel experiences, and reccomend two things: 1) don't stir the caramel while it is cooking too often, just stick to the occasional swirl...when I stirred it too often, I burned it; 2) it's better to remove it too early than too late..you can't recover from burned caramel. I also suggest dividing the apples up between 2-3 bowls before pouring the caramel over them. This makes it easier to coat the apples before the caramel hardens. I have also doubled the amount of caramel with great taste results, however, this creates a more liquid consistency in the final product. Let the apples release as much liquid as possible.

We enjoyed this pie a lot. It's very sweet, which I think is a plus. The big problem we had was also with the caramel. We tried it a second time by just melting store bought caramels and that seemed to work.

This is THE BEST apple pie i have ever tasted. it is super sweet(i love sweet) so be warned. i followed the recipe exactly although next time i might double the caramel and add a little spice to the apples. the only downside i can think of is that it turned out really juicy. i had to scoop out about a half a cup of juices but that was probably due to my error. my roomates all loved it. they are all asking me about this website now. try this you will not be disappointed

I really liked this recipe. The crust was delicious too. I used a mixture of Melrose, Empire and Johnagold apples since an orchard was near by. For the crust I used salted butter and only 1/8t of salt. As for the caramel, I used one cup of sugar and 1/4C of packed light brown. It seemed like the caramel was no as easy to overcook that way. I also added extra pumkin pie spice to the topping for some extra kick. As for the filling, I used one of those apple corer peeler machines even though the slices came out thinner. Plus I sprinkled some cornstarch throughout the filling (2tsp.) to thicken in case it was too juicy. Adding 5 or so more minutes helped too. It was definitely interesting and already made it a second time. YUMMY!

This was the BEST apple pie ever! I did make a few adjustments: I used Winesap apples which gave it a nice tart flavor to match the sweetness of the caramel and the streusel topping; I could not get the sugar + water to carmelize after they were mixed together -- instead it remained a white syrupy mess. I carmelized the sugar by itself and then added 1/4 cup of water and butter - worked perfectly

Rating: 4
I entered this pie in a bake off contest and it won!! I added 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice to the flour for the apples. The caramel does lump up but I broke it up into small pieces and distributed it evenly over the apples prior to putting on the struesel topping. Maybe next time I will try the pre-made caramel coating for apples in the produce aisle.

Rating: 4
This is the absolute best apple pie. Just enough slightly sticky caramel coats the floured apples making a creamy type filling. It's not at all "pasty" or soggy with juice like some apple pies can be. Procedure needs some work. I agree with another reviewer, the caramel ends up being one hard mass. One person is apt to get all the caramel. Next time I would put 1/2 of apples in the dish, pour 1/2 the warm caramel over and then repeat with the rest of the apples and caramel without stirring or distrubing. Also, I added 1 tsp vanilla to the caramel at the end of cooking and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and pinch of salt to the apples. I made this with the traditional top crust versus the struesel and use tart Ontario spy apples. It was almost not sweet enough. Make this. You won't be sorry. It's heavenly with cheddar and icecream. Just don't forget to "roter router" your arteries afterward!

Pie was very good but recipe needs some work. Carmel creation went perfect but when you throw hot carmel on cold (room temp) apples it becomes a rock hard mess. Almost had to throw the bowl away. Next time I line a pie pan with foil add apples then carmel so I can just flip it over and put in the pie shell.

Positively the best apple pie I have ever made or eaten! Used 1/2 granny smith & 1/2 golden as I do not like pies too sweet. Also used 2/3 brown sugar in the caramel. (Don't know if thats kosher, but it sure tasted amazing!). Also added some cinnamon to the caramel with the butter at the end. I can not tell you how good this pie tastes. It did not last a day in my house.

This pie was fabulous. Even my first attempt worked out. If your caramel gets a little hard, don't worry--it will melt when the pie is baking for a great tasting apple pie. Definitely make this one again. Oh, and I used a ready-made crust and it worked out fine. Happy Baking!

I had a hard time making the caramel(after i coated the apples it got hard like candy)It did melt again in the pie.I also made the mistake of using apples that I had picked with my kids the day before...BLAH!They were way to tart & completely ruined the pie!I ended up throwing it in the garbage.Everything else about it was good...as long as you took out the apples.My mistake But I don't think I'll be making this one again.I had a hard time with the caramel & it was alot of work & time consuming.

Just use a deep-dish pie crust. I also used half golden delicious, half granny smith for a bit of tartness. Absolutely delicious!

Great recipe - I received compliments from all who tried it. One taster proclaimed that it was even better the next day! (hint: careful with the caramel - don't let it get too dark!)

Wow, even my brother who is not a cook in any sense of the word, wants to learn to make this pie. The person who invented this recipe deserves some devotion from all of us! Try it.

This recipe was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. Don't fool yourself - this was completely worth it. I made this a day ahead of time. It was wonderful. I could not get enough of it. Next time I will probably double the caramel. I really did not taste it but nonetheless - it was GREAT. My special guest was impressed also. Thanks!

This turned out marvelously, even though I made a mistake with the sugar-water ratio and ended up with pieces of hardened caramel stuck between apple pieces at baking. Miraculously, it still turned out rich and delicious. My father in-law absolutely loved it.

Everyone I have ever made this pie for absolutely loves it and begs for the recipe. It is true, as noted in other reviews that it gets easier as time goes on. I have made it a number of times, and it seems quick and easy now. One note to add: When making this pie at high altitude, do not worry if the caramel never turns that amber color, it usually doesnt and it ends up evaporating first. Dont wait for it to turn colors, just make sure that the sugar is melted well....

Pie Valhalla! Tricky at first, it gets easier to make each time. I add a little allspice and ginger for a bit more kick.

I made this pie to raves all around, just don't forget that it really needs a deep dish! I only had a regular sized dish and had to make a second pie in a skillet! I also added raisins, and used raw turbinado sugar instead of white.

I find the sugariness of the pie a little cloying - although I usually love caramel. Also, I think if I were going to make it again, I'd use a firmer apple. The Golden Delicious apples are too mushy for my taste after the baking.

To British Columbia, I use the combination of Macintosh and Jonathon apples and no longer use lemon juice for added tartness because my combination of apples is perfectly tart. After 25 years, I've come up with the absolutely perfect pie that everyone raves about. I'm content but also like to make a caramel apple pie and thought I'd try this posted recipe. Doesn't even come close to mine.

Everyone loved it! That's the best part, but be careful with the caramel...there's about a 30 second difference between perfect and burned! Don't wait until you have dark amber, stop at amber. I think it needed more, so I will double the caramel next time. Also...trust me...double the streusel so you can cover the entire pie. It was REALLY delish! (I added pecans too!)

This tasted like a pretty basic apple pie. Good, but not special in any way. Not worth the extra effort of making the carmel sauce.

Never got past the part where you make the caramel--had to run to the grocery store to buy the store bought stuff to finish it.

The pie was just ok. I could live without the caramel. Definitely overpowered the apples. For firm, yet tender apples in your pie, try Northern Spies mixed with either Macintosh or Galas. Let your pie stand a long time out of the oven. The juices will thicken on their own (without flour or butter or any other "thickener") and bring the pie together. If you want warm pie, just put in in a warm oven. Any fruit pie should cool thoroughly before serving.

I received many thumbs up for this pie! Although, I quickly overcooked the caramel, the pie as a whole was scrumptious! With many requests, I will bake this pie again and again! :o)

I haven't yet tried this recipe, because I've been busy perfecting my own apple pie recipe (which, by the way, after learning an excellent pastry recipe at school, and tinkering with it, I am now making pie better than my aunt's, who is THE pie queen) I have been working with spartans and galas. they seem to be working nicely. a couple tips: if the apple leave a lake of juice at the bottom after baking, try baking the apple pieces on a cookie sheet until somewhat dry on the exterior. once you put them in the pie and bake it, however, the pieces will be evenly moist. for better flavour, use a bit of lemon juice and do half and half white sugar and yellow (light brown)sugar, and of course, cinnamon oh, and if anyone thinks there is a better apple to use in pie, please say so? I'm still experimental=)

I made this recipe for my boyfriend and he loved it! It had great texture and excellent flavor. I read the tips and placed a cookie sheet under it while it baked. Some of the caramel stuck to the bowl when I mixed it with the apples.

I used Granny Smith Apples instead of Yellow Delicious. The apples were kind of mushy after the specified baking time. I will try it again but use different apples.

I've never made a pie before, my family loved this one. Next time I might try different apples, they were too soft. My carmel clumped when it hit the apples, but melted evenly in the oven.

i've made this one twice with rave reviews! try making caramel by boiling a small can of sweetened condensed milk for 4 hours on top of the stove. i used pillsbury refrigerated crusts and mixed granny smith and macintosh apples. it's a keeper!

It was very good and everyone at Thanksgiving liked it. BUT, the caramel was a lot of work and makes for messy cleanup. (I'm glad I put a cookie sheet under the pie in my oven. The juices bubbled over badly.) Also, the pie was hard to serve with the juices and caramel. It kind of fell apart, though folks didn't seem to mind. I'd probably make it again but might try to improve it somehow.

Best apple pie recipe ever. The caramel turned to rock when poured over apples, but came out fine in the baking. Next time I will not use cold apples (kept them in the fridge before using) but the end result was heavenly!

I used my normal crust recipe, but followed the rest of the recipe (except that I used Crispin apples), and the pie was wonderful. I really don't know how anyone could have been disappointed.

I thought this recipe was absolutely delicious. The caramel was a bit tricky (it gets hard and clumpy very quickly), but upon cooking in the oven I found it melted just perfectly. The crust was wonderful, but next time I might make it with a crust that is composed of half vegetable shortening and half butter so it's flakier. All in all, the best apple pie I have ever made!

Rating: 1
This pie involved way too much effort for the result -- a very juicy (read soupy) pie that didn't taste any better than a regular apple pie. I found that the caramel did not "coat" the apples, but just hardened around them. Definitely not worth the effort in my opinion.

Rating: 2
I'm known for baking pies and I wasn't impressed with this recipe. I didn't like the crust (I prefer shortening for flakier texture) but I liked the streusel. Making the caramel was extra work when it didn't taste any different than the typical apple pie. Final comment: not as good as grandma's!

Rating: 4
OK I have to tell you I cheated on this, I used store-bought pie crust and I doubled the recipe for caramel. and I baked it in a 9x13 pan.It is still wonderful and easy. I did not have any trouble with the caramel although next time I make it I may use 2T of cream and 1 tsp vanilla for the water.

This is the best pie I've made. My friend, who claimed she didn't like apple pie, took two large slices. I let the apples sit overnight, causing the juices to release more and the caramel flavor to soften.

DOUBLE WOW! I have made this pie three times, and am always happy with the results. If you handle the caramel-making meticulously, it should present no problems. Instant familial popularity!

It is a good pie but I don't think it's a four-forker. If one of your guests doesn't care for caramel, he's out of luck because it has, I think, too strong of a caramel flavor. It should taste more of apple.

This is, by far, one of the best pies I've ever had or made. The caramel can be tricky - follow the recipe directions closely. Expect rave reviews from your guests!

Wow!! This is by far the best apple pie I have ever made. The two tablespoons of water I substituted Calvados liqeur - delicious. The caramel is tricky, but swirl the pan and only let the butter and (water or Calvados) mix in well for about 15 seconds and then pour over apples. Otherwise, it will harden if you cook it too long.

Topped with french vanilla ice cream, this pie was delicious! I am wondering, however, why I didn't have lots of caramel at the bottom to spoon over ice cream. My caramel seemed to disappear. I could taste it, but I could not see it!

A nice change from the usual apple pie recipes. It was even great cold the next day.
