Simple yet delicious. I use baby spinach.

I am an avid cook; I prepare a lot of fairly complex recipes and menus. This is so beautifully simple and simply delicious. The true flavors of the baby greens (any combination or just baby spinach or baby arugula) shine through the light glistening of the extra virgin olive oil with just the right amount of flavor-enhancing salt. I have to laugh at the note that this recipe takes under 45 minutes to prepare; I would say it is more like 45 seconds!

This was almost too easy. I was tempted to add something, but I didn't. The salad was wonderful!

This is a great recipe for a hot summer's night.

Nutty, sweet, bitter, salty, and smooth. All of that from just a few drops of extra virgin olive oil and a dash of sea salt!!! Hoodathunkit? It's not just a regular, it's practically an every-nighter!! So simple, and so yummy.

Too simple! Next time I will add grated fresh parmesan cheese. Using a high quality of olive oil is a must...but make sure that the oil has not gone rancid, which it can do over a period of time.

Fantastic! I used baby spinach, kosher salt and top notch ev olive oil, and we all loved it. The one alteration for next time would be to use a little less olive oil.

Maybe I did something wrong, but I found the taste to be bitter (I used mixed baby greens). Had to fix it by adding balsamic vinegar, but that makes it into an ordinary dressing.

Scrumptious. A must-try. I used Lolla Rosa and arugula - kosher salt and the best evo. Dish was simply out-of-this-world.

So simple, and yet I'm not sure I'd have ever thought of it! I had just bought a bag of baby spinach when I found this "recipe." I used some kosher salt and great olive oil and a grinding of black pepper and was in heaven! You've got to have good-quality ingredients to begin with here, I think, but this is utter simplicity and fantastic.
