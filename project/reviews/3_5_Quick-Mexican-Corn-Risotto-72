I agree that this was tasty but I also have to admit I used the suggestions of others - added the broth 1/2 cup at a time (risotto method), added onion to the garlic, used fresh jalapenos and corn. Came out great.

The recipe is something to start from and has potential, but, much like AKUMATENDO, I felt there was something missing just from the ingredients. So, I sauteed some onions with the garlic and some fire roasted jalapenos from my garden and Fresh Cilantro. I then added a bit more butter for the fat coating of the rice and sauteed the rice til the eyes of the rice were apparent. I added the corn (which I fire roasted as well, you can also buy fire roasted frozen corn at Trader Joes) Then I added the chicken broth, half a cup at a time and it was already warming (this is proper Risotto technique by the way). I had some Salvadorian style Chorizo that I had already cooked and crumbled and had drained of any excess fat (appx 3/4 cup) that I added along with the cheese (yes, use a bit less and then top with Cotija or Queso Fresco when you serve along with more fresh cilantro) and the cream (already warmed). I served this with a beautiful chicken breast that was topped with a Poblano Cream Sauce...An amazing meal!

This was a delicious alternative to standard mexican rice. I served it with the Tequila marinated Tri Tip and my whole family loved it. However, the dish does need some tweaking. I added 1/2 c finely chopped onion and 1/2 a chopped red jalapeno to the garlic and cumin (I used 1/2 tsp) saute. Let the onion get very soft before adding the rice. Let the rice cook a minute before adding 1 cup chicken broth. I added the corn and then proceeded to make the risotto the right way--1/2 cup of broth at a time, 1 qt broth in total. After all the broth was absorbed, I added 3/4 c cheese, which I thought was just right, cilantro and some chopped fresh oregano that I happened to have on hand.

I felt as if this dish was missing something. If I do make this again, I will saute some onion with the garlic and possible add some type of meat... ham or chorizo.

This was good, but needed some help... added chopped onions and fresh jalapenos, as well as mixed the cilantro in instead of just using as a garnish. Very good!

very good. Ive made it many times and everyone ive made it for loves it. I suggest using 1 and 1/2 cups of cheese.

I wasn't all that impressed with this recipe. The flavor is OK after doubling up on the cumin and adding a hefty amount of salt, but it was missing some zing, even without adding the cream. I sprinkled some lime juice on it to wake it up. I would say the texture is the biggest downfall -- kinda smooshy and pasty. Maybe I needed to use a different kind of rice -- since this was titled "risotto", i used arborio rice.

Rating: 4
Everyone I make this for loves it! I use arborio rice, double the cumin, add about 1/4 cup finely chopped onion, use 1 quart chicken or vegetable broth, and omit the cream entirely. I am a cheese hound and am generous with the cheese - 1 1/2 cups UNpacked.

Richer than I expected, though should have expected it with a cup of cheese. A bit one-note flavor for my taste, boyfriend said 'it was good'. Would make again in a smaller batch.

We loved it. My husband claimed he liked it better than any other risotto I've made to date. I added jalapenos, and next time I'll even add more. Served it with (a) Pan-Fried Steaks with Salsa Verde and Ancho Chili Sauce and (b) a Green Salad with a Mexican inspired dressing. More gooey cheesy than most risottos.

Preparation of this recipe was very easy and the risotto was perfect..but I was disappointed in the flavor ..overall too bland. I found adding light sour cream and minced jalapenos added just the right punch. Any other suggestions??

This with chipotle chili chicken is the favorite meal of my college-aged son. We love the cheese. I always cook it the traditional way to make risotto by adding the broth about half cup at a time and adding the corn, half and half and cheese at the end. The only time that it was more gooey than I liked was the one time I tried to make a double batch. If I ever make a double batch again, I will use two pans.

tasty recipe... I decided to try it without the cheese, as I was making a big meal and thought it would be too much... the rice was a hit with my dinner party.

I've been making this dish for a few years at least! It's incredibly simple, tasty, & rich! What comes out most is the cheese, so be sure to use a good pepper jack, not regular jack. I would suggest Tillamook or other high quality brand. Of course, fresh corn is always best, but frozen is OK...just don't skimp on the cheese! OK to add half-&-half instead of cream or even skip the cream altogether!

This is a great side dish for a party. I made it ahead of time and then reheated it, adding a little more cream to keep it from getting too thick. I also used a bag of mixed pepper strips to add some color.

Yummy. I too added broth in btaches, not all at once. I guess that makes it not too quick but with two making dinner, it's still pretty fast. Used arrborio rice and was fantastic. Had to use some extra broth too. I didn't use extra cream or 1/2 & 1/2 and I think there was too much cheese. I too might add some chopped seasoned tomatoes next time for color though only 1/2 can and just warm it through.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong with this now that I'm reading these reviews, but I didn't like this dish at all. It came out somwhat sweet(?)and was heavy on the garlic. I used long grain rice and followed the advice on adding a tblsp of tomato paste, but I didn't enjoy this one at all.

Excellent and easy to make. I added about a tablespoon of tomato paste to make the dish more colorful.

We really enjoyed this. I couldn't find medium-grain rice so used 3/4 cup Uncle Ben's long grain (all I had left) and 1/4 cup arborio. I added the second can of broth in stages, as it was absorbed. It worked fine.

Couldn't be easier and tasted great! I made it with some salsa flavored chicken as the main entree. All I had was basmati rice and that seemed to work just fine. All the ingredients were in my already cabinet (except for the jack cheese) which was a plus. Next time..I may add some bottled salsa or red or yellow peppers to the mixture as one other person recommended to spice it up. A bit more cumin too...

Delicious, I know the recipe by heart. Except I use spinach instead of corn and fat free half and half. It's a favorite at my house especially with grilled fish or chicken.

I made one small change and my guests raved: I used a habenero jack cheese and it made the risotto refreshingly zippy. Everyone had seconds.

After reading the glowing reviews, perhaps we expected too much. This certainly was easy to prepare -- it just wasn't that tasty. We could understand why children would enjoy the cheesiness of the dish.

I hate to cast aspersions, but this recipe is just so-so. If you want a simpler, better recipe, put a little butter in the saucepan, pour in 1/4 cup of white wine, then 1/2 cup of arborio rice and 2 cups chicken stock in small intervals. Take the rice off the burner and pour in 1/2 a can of black beans(the ones already in spices taste best as opposed to the plain beans). Finally, put in about 1/2 cup of colby jack cheese and prepare yourself for the eternal adoration of your table. I make this for non-risotto lovers who now request this dish. You can also substitute other things for the beans- like mushrooms or shellfish. So much easier and tastier than this interpretation.

I made this for a Cinco de Mayo triple birthday party. I doubled it and it came out great. I followed it exactly and was very happy with the results - everyone really did enjoy it. I think next time, I'll make it with 1/2 corn and 1/2 peas. My sister has a 3 year old, and she says she'll make it with plain Monterey Jack cheese and add diced steamed bell peppers (the 3 year old's favorite!). I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe and so easy. It's extremely creamy and the corn adds some nice texture. The pepper jack cheese was a little too hot for me, so I'll use something milder in the future. I tried it with broccoli instead of corn and it just wasn't the same. The corn adds just the right texture

Rating: 4
This dish is perfect as it is though I add a bit more cumin. I have doubled it before and added a 10 oz. package of frozen peas. If you have plain jack cheese you can add 1 Tbls. of crushed red pepper flakes. I've also used part cheddar and thrown in some leftover grilled green pepper -diced. I go to a monthly pot luck dinner and got several requests for this recipe.

This dish was very yummy! I brought this to a dinner party and it was almost wiped out. The only thing I didn't doe was use butter. I used low-fat marg. and a mexican blend cheese. Even my fiance who claims to not like risotto liked this one. I'll definitely make this again!

I am a novice cook and wanted something easy and filling and creamy -- this hit the spot! I added 1/2 a french onion (long and skinny) and 1/2 a red pepper, diced very tiny and sauteed with the garlic ( I used 3 medium cloves) and the butter..it was a piece of cake from there..I allowed the rice to sautee a bit before I added the liquid, so it would have a nuttier flavor...added in the cheese and cream...and VOILA! yummy comfort food right up there w/ butter mashed potatoes!

This recipe is fantastic. I've made it as written, but it is also a great basic recipe for experimentation and creativity. My most recent experiment was to use hot chili beans instead of corn. I also added an onion and used LOTS of habanero sauce. I disagree that it is bland. I think the cooks who don't like it simply aren't bold enough to experiment.

Absolutely great. I upped the garlic to 4 cloves, was liberal with the cumin, and added a hefty shake of chilli powder and a dash of cayenne. I made it with short-grain Japanese sushi rice because that was all I had, and I mixed in 1 can of vacuum-packed white baby kernal corn and just 2 cups of chicken broth. Ditched the whipping cream as the recipe seemed rich enough and used exactly 2 c of cheese (actually just regular sharp cheddar). At the end I mixed in 1 T butter and dried cilantro, though it would be better with fresh. Truly a stand-out blend of flavors and a great addition to a meal.

It would seem that the brand of cheese people use has a big impact on the recipe result. I use Tillamook's and have many people ask for the recipe. The interplay of the garlic, cumin, and cheese work well and added richness from the chicken stock make this a tasty dish. I also did not find this to be very spicy probably due to the choice of cheese.

I, too, found this recipe rather bland. Adding a lot of cilantro helped, but it still needed more. Then I added salsa, and it made all the difference. It added the flavor and heat that the dish really needed!

I thought this was a great recipe--very creamy, with the contrasting crunch of the corn. I didn't have jalapeno jack, just regular jack, so I added a can of diced ortega chiles at the end. It turned out super. It also made great leftovers the next day.

Rating: 1
Like other reviewers, I suspected that the amount of cheese would be overpowering, so I reduced the amount and added a little cheddar. Still I found that besides the (still overpowering) jalapeno cheese, it had no flavor. I guess this recipe would be good for those who love jalapenos - in which case you could eliminate everything but the cheese, rice, and corn, since that's all you can taste.
