Did not care for this recipe at all! The flavor balance was off. In completed sauce, the shallots and thyme were barely detectable. The prescribed quantity of horseradish made for a bizarre flavor. Needs help.

I've made this to rave reviews many times. For the people who thought it turned out bitter, try using a less "oakey" wine. Merlot rather than Cab for example. The oak gets bitter when concentrated in a sauce. Same with white wine sauces. Use Sauvignon Blanc instead of Chardonnay. Hope this helps.

I have to agree with others who were highly disappointed in the sauce. I used a good Cabernet and it didn't make a difference. There was a strange bitter taste after it reduced and was definitely not worth the effort. It ruined our New Year's Eve steak - yuck!

I've been looking at this for years, but have been put off by the poor reviews. I took other's suggestions and used a combination of half beef stock and red wine, shallots and garlic. I added some dijon mustard along with only two tbls of cream. I might leave the cream out next time. I finished it off with some red wine vinegar to taste. The result was given high praise by folks. I used horseradish I bought at a local farmers marked that has some much better flavor than the week grocery store stuff so I used less than a tbl but it had a nice horsedradish flavor with out being over powering. If you have been looking at this for a while like I have, I recommend that you try it.

I'm puzzled by the negative reviews. We made this for the first time tonight. We halved the recipe b/c it was just the two of us, and made a couple of substitutions b/c we were going with what we had on hand (so ... onions and garlic for the shallots, and wasabi horseradish for the white horseradish). It was absolutely delicious. Such a nice way to dress up a delicious filet.

this is the worst recipe I have ever tried from Epidurious - sauce tasted awful, even with Mark's adjustments. Don't waste your filets mignons on this recipe.

This recipe is one of my absolute favorites. I serve it on a separate small plate with the sauce poured to the rim of the plate. I have served this at many dinner parties and continually get asked for the recipe. A HUGE hit and so delicious and easy.

I don't know - the sauce reduced and looked great and then I added the horseradish which killed it! Somehow it took over the sauce and made it awfully bitter and I like horseradish. I had to add a lot more cream to sweeten the flavor of the sauc e. It was a weird color as people said too - my husband was afraid to try it! I may try this again, but without the horseradish.

Gosh, was I nervous about trying this recipe after spending way too much money on these beautiful filet mignons and then reading someone's comment that the sauce had ruined an expensive cut of meat. However, unless I wanted to go back out to the store to get dried porcini mushrooms and tarragon to make the other recipe that sounded good, I didn't have much choice. I consoled myself knowing that I could taste the sauce before I drenched the filet in it. I say, "Drench the filet in it!" It's delicious! It is the perfect sauce for a rich meat. The color is not distracting or unappealing, by the way. One wise woman suggested shaking the filets in a ziploc with cracked pepper and sea salt: this is essential! Served with a baked ricotta and green salad.

Fairly simple and absolutely delicious! For added flavor, shake each filet in a baggie with good sea salt and pepper before grilling.

Even though the recipe tells you to grill the filet, it was cold outside - so I cooked it on the stove - and still, the recipe was great. Even my kids, who are the pickiest eaters, thought dinner was great (they do love steak, but they hate trying something new). It was the best, including at a restaurant, that I have had. Highly recommend

Instead of fresh thyme, I used an herb paste (thyme, rosemary, marjoram) available at a local supplier here in Vancouver. The sauce was awesome, very delicate and totally delicious. We had our filet "blue," with fresh jumbo prawns and Caesar salad (fresh made with just the hearts of romaine and real whole anchovies finely chopped). It was a totally wonderful meal! We're still smiling!

An excellent recipe. Mark's modifications seemed like the trick, with those it tasted very good. I was hesitant to make it based on some of the negative reviews, but I'm glad I did, it came out excellent. I didn't rate it 4 forks because I have tested better steak sauces, all in restuarants that I'm sure had 100 steps to make them, but for such a simple sauce, this we very good.

This sauce is the pits, and a waste of good wine. Ruined two filets as well. I even made the substitutions that the others suggested and the sauce still tasted like @$$.

I followed Mark's lead as well. Clever alterations... and easy... you just have to make time for the sauce to simmer, but that can be done one day ahead... just right!

Mark's review was spot on - once the recipe is tweaked up (less cream and some dijon!) it's worth the repeating.

My boyfriend and I were not crazy about the sauce. It didn't add much additional flavor to the steak and it was a strange dark purple color. I'll look for another recipe.

I don't understand some of the low reviews on this recipe. I didn't find making the sauce to be a long-drawn-out process - in fact I thought it was rather simple. I pan-seared my filets, and I must say with every bite, I and my boyfriend could not stop commenting to each other about the sumptuous taste. I am going to try this again and again with various cuts of beef. By the way, I thought the color was COOL!

A good infused red wine sauce that just needs a little tweaking. Instead of all those shallots I just used 2 bulbs shallots and a lg clove of garlic, half wine / beef stock. Half the cream and a half teaspoon of good dijon mustard. Reduce the sauce a bit more to concenrate the flavors. A good chewy red wine and your set.

The cream to wine ratio seemed off in this recipe - it was far too creamy for my taste. I ended up increasing the horseradish to try to offset it, but in the end it was still nothing great. Won't bother to make it again.

This was hugely disappointing! I made it for my husband's birthday dinner, and it ruined prime filet mignon. I would NOT make it again.

i made this last week and i'm not enitrely impressed. for as long as the sauce took to make and for all of the 4-fork rave reviews, i expected more. everyone else thought it was great (probably because they didn't spend 40 minutes in the kitchen preparing it).

I made this recipe for my husband and son. I used Angus Filets cut a little bit thicker than called for, however they were very tender and the sauce was wonderful. The sauce looked very pretty drizzeled on the plate. I will make this again.

As a new cook I found the sauce quite easy to make. I will make it again, I agree with the review that it needed additional horseradish. I added 1 and a half teaspoons and found the taste to be quite good. My dinner guest was quite impressed. Served with Baked Potatoes, brocoli and fresh bread.

I found this to be quite easy to make and a very nice compliment to the filet. What we found to be even better with it though was to grill whole portabello mushroom caps marinated with olive oil, Lysander's meat rub, and a little salt and pepper and then to top off the mushroom caps with this sauce. It was extremely delicious.

I would alter this recipe a little. I would increase the horseradish by one tablespoon and the shallots I would add another 1/2 cup for added flavor. Additionally we increased the pepper for taste. This sauce added elegance to our dinner. It was great!

I was very impressed with this fast and ingredient-simple recipe. We used extra horseradish and wine to add some kick and it turned out fabulously. Went well with buttered parmesean egg noodles and a salad with balsamic vinagrette dressing. A thoroughly pleasurable dining experience. I'd definitely do it again.

I thought that a little more horseradish could have been added to make the sauce a little stronger. Also, I cooked down to about half of the original mixtire then strained the shallots. This left me with too little wine but was no big deal. I just had to add a little more wine. The wine did have a wonderful flavor and I would like to find more to do with this base.
