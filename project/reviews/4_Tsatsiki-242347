I added some lemon (about a tablespoon) and some mint! Perfect proportions in this recipe, though!

WAY too much garlic, even with one clove! The rest of the recipe was great, but if I redid it, I wouldn't use any garlic, or, a 1/4 of a strong clove. It totally overpowered the sauce, and I ended up adding more yogurt to temper it, which then cause the cucumber undertone to disappear entirely. My recommendation? Make this without the garlic to start, and taste. You can always add it later.

This is our go to recipe for Tzatziki! We have made it following the recipe. It was great. We are now doubling the recipe as we use it for sandwiches, dipping for veggies and baked or boiled potatoes. Sour creme has disappeared from our fridge. We use fat free Greek strained yogurt, mediterranean cucumbers and baby dill. The use of the garlic is spot on as the flavors intensify over night. We are using white pepper this time.

This recipe is concise and well-written. I didn't have a strainer on hand, so I salted the cucumber and squeezed the excess liquid by hand and then later mixed it in. I also found that cow's milk yogurt worked well, in particular, the full-fat variety. Yum!

Great dish. Loved it as a cool side to kebobs on a summer night.

Used Trader Joe's Greek yogurt. On a Cracked Pepper & Olive Oil Triscuit it is FABO!

This is a good recipe for tsatzski. The greek yogurt is thicker/creamier than regular plain yogurt, and I think makes this recipe. I used 2 cloves of garlic which was too much. I would recommend only one! Dont forget that the garlic flavor will intensify/permeate the dip by the next day.

YUM. And easy! I used nonfat greek yogurt, and other than that I followed the recipe as written. Fantastic with grilled chicken and pita bread.

Having lived in Greece for six years, I've adapted this most wonderful recipe. The Greeks use strained yogurt which is almost the consistency of cream cheese - with all of the fat. I use no-fat yogurt and strain it overnight with cheesecloth. Then I add back in olive oil to make it healthy. Plus in many parts of Greece, they add in two teaspoons of dill, a very tasty addition. It also needs at least two teaspoons of salt to give it the kick that makes it such a fine compliment to a meal.

Looking forward to making this recipe soon. Does anyone know if Tsatsiki can be made in advance without compromising flavor? Thanks!

So delicious and so easy. Used regular plain yogurt because that's what I had on hand and it was fine. Teenage boys said it was "authentic". It was also tasty on my tuna salad pita!

It's hard to argue with something this simple and delicious. I probably make this twice a month. One caveat: don't get ahead of yourself and start giddily adding more garlic. It doesn't need it and you'll just end up hurting yourself and those around you.

This is the perfect Tsatsiki recipe -- just like my YiaYia used to make. For an interesting twist, add some crumbled feta and grated jalapeno -- just amazing!

This was absolutely delicious. I used two cartons of Greek yogurt (each was just over 5 oz.) and about half of a hot house cuke. I grated the cuke on a box grater then a quick pulse in my mini food processor, then rung out in a clean dish towel. Mixed all together and adjusted with a little Kosher salt. I served this with veggie crackers. My guest devoured this. Of course I did add a bit more garlic ;o)

I always add lots and lots of chopped mint and some fresh dill

Delicious and simple. The seeding, salting and squeezing kept the consistancy from being runny like other recipes I tried. 2% greek yogurt worked really well.

This is a terrific utility recipe. In fact it is useful to cool down several of the spicier dishes in this issue. VERY easy.
