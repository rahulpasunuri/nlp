it seems a shame to use plain water in a flavored item. i substituted a mixture of strong black coffee and little 20 year old port. much richer. additionally, i added fresh cherries and a handful of chocolate chips. for a family that likes heavily frosted cakes - this was perfect simply with powdered sugar!

I used homemade greek-style yogurt from 2% milk, thinned with a little leftover whey and milk instead of water. Instead of the one loaf, I made several mini-loafs and cupcakes, and you should definitely not fill anything more than a 1/2 to 2/3 full. This batter gets really fluffy as it bakes. I'm going to try freezing some of the mini loaves and see how they hold up...

Followed one cook's advice and replaced water with yogurt. All other instructions followed to a "T" save for using a larger loaf pan (9x5"). Maybe my oven is off, but this took 20 minutes more to bake and it oozed out of the pan and wound up on the pizza stone at the bottom of my oven. Water would have made the batter even more liquidy so I can't blame the yogurt. Great chocolate flavor, very moist on inside. Think I'll try as muffins next time around.

I have made this cake many times since this recipe was first published and expect to make it many times in the futere. Each time it turns out perfectly. The recipe tin size is a misprint I think. The loaf pan that I used holds 7 cups (I measured it) you will need one at least 6 cups in volume.

This cake was amazing, the favorite of our party. Taste and texture were excellent. The cake did overflow the tin though, so I need to check my tin size. It was very easy to make too, definitely to be repeated.

Will make this again. Baked in a 12 cup cupcake pan made by Nornic Ware at 325 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes. Added 1/2 teaspoon 5-spice Chinese powder and about 1 ounce chopped semi-sweet chocolate to enhance the chocolate flavor.

Did I make "the" recipe or not? You decide. Used 1-1/3c buttermilk (out of yogurt), 8T butter (to compensate for low fat in buttermilk vs yogurt), 3/4c sugar (to make more chocolatey), added 2t Penzeys cake spice, a great blend. The result was a simple cake, like a moist (and lower calorie) chocolate pound cake, good enough in its simplicity. Would be great w strawberries, whipped cream.

I thought this was a great cake. I used a 175g (6 oz) container of full fat Astro yogurt that made for a very moist cake. I used Ghirardelli cocoa, and the cake turned out rich an chocolately. It definitely tasted sinful, which I didn't expect. I baked it in three mini loaf pans, with no overflow, for about 45 mins.

I did not experience the trouble with overflowing like other reviewers did. The cake was fine - not enough flavor to call it delicious. It tasted more like a chocolate bread.

My fmaily dove into this cake and it was gone in minutes...we liked it very well. It was moist and rich tasting but not filling. We served it with strawberries and whipped cream...Yummy!

I made this cake the day before yesterday for a friend's birthday. One thing puzzled me and that was the size of the pan (8 1/2 by 4 1/2 by 2/12). I have an 8 1/2 inch loaf pan which is 4 1/2 inches high and 4 1/2 inches wide, which I used, but was aghast when I realized that the batter filled the entire pan almost to the rim. It still turned out great (I received a lot of compliments) but while it was baking I was constantly afraid the batter would flow over the edge of the pan. I have yet to find a loaf pan with higher sides. Would it make sense to divide the batter in half and use two loaf pans? P.S. I made a Philadelphia Cream Cheese frosting which was really yummy - everyone loved it)

Lots of ingredients for a very simple chocolate cake. Used it as a base for vanilla ice cream and hot fudge sauce. A brownie would have been just as good!

Wonderful dark chocolate flavor. The only change I made was the to substitute the one third cup water with yogurt.Very moist. Maybe will sub w/espresso next time.

I made three of these yesterday for a church group work crew and received rave reviews. They all commented on how tasty they were. I will use a 5-inch by 9-inch pan the next time because one of my loaves overflowed and the others almost did.

This was okay, but wouldn't make it again. It was moist but think it needed a flavor boost. To the person who asked about a moist chocolate pound cake, I have Nick Malgieri's new cake book and it has wonderful poundcakes in there. I highly recommend it.

I haven't finished baking this cake at the time of this email. Just to let you know there is a mistake in the "special equipment": It should read 2pans each 8 1/2 by 4 1/2 by 2 1/2 inch loaf pan. The cake is running over in the oven and smelling up the house. Please edit your recipes befor putting on the net. I'm not sure I can trust your accuracy in the future.

This is a nice recipe. It's very simple, but it's probably not something you would want to make if you're trying to impress. It's great as a bed for ice cream!

This is a note to "Inge" from Denmark. I too am from Denmark. I can see you were thinking of the Danish LageKage med det gode syletoj. Hilsen fra Birte fra Denmark.

Not good by itself. Had to layer it with jam and a cream cheese frosting. Does anyone have a moist chocolate pound cake?

Wonderful! The only change I made was that I divided the batter equally between 2 smaller loaf pans. Baked for 55 minutes. Just the right amount of moisture. Delicious when a lighter chocolate flavored dessert is desired. Will make this one again and again when brownies are not on the dessert menu.

it was good flavor and all, but i couldnt eat it alone-- needed ice cream or something with it. would make it again; maybe my oven dried it out a tad too much.

Great dark chocolate flavour. Unusual texture; very moist interior, chewy outside. Not too sweet. Good standbye for a not-too-rich dessert or snack.

A good recipe for a quick, plain, delicious cake. Moist and very chocolate-y.

this was a great recipe to make with my daughter who is 7 , easy recipe with basic ingredients that are always in the house. Loaf came out to be quite moist and was "yummy" as my daughter described it. Would certainly make it again . Good recipe to keep the recipe box and to share !
