With the roasting of the chiles, the skinning of the tomatoes and the braising of the goat, this is an elaborate recipe. While everything tasted okay, there was really no "wow" factor with the final product. The tacos taste especially fresh with the lettuce, cilantro, lime, radish and queso fresco finish. While I was soaking the chiles, some of the liquid which I drained got on my fingers and was really very hot, so I was expecting a nice roasted heat to the finished meat, which never materialized. This was quite a good recipe, just not spectacular for the hours of prep in my opinion.

This recipe seems to be missing something. There's very little liquid left after cooking for the time prescribed in the recipe. It seems there should be a lot more liquid after cooking, there's only 1/4 inch in the bottom of the dutch oven.

One of the most delicious dishes in Mexican cuisine. Absolutely addictive.

Awesome and worth the time. the sauce/braising liquid base is similar to one that is in a Gourmet recipe for Capon that I have also made with great success. though I was concerned with the meat/bone ratio in what I got there was plenty of meat at the end. Wouldn't change a thign though I think the blanching/peeling tomatoes is a waste--they get pureed and then cooked in liquid for 3 1/2 hrs...no one will notice a tiny bit of tomato skin.

The system is based on an average of all the fork ratings and the percentage of people who would make it again. If only one person reviews the recipe, and they give it 5 forks, that is what will display.

Yum. Found goat at the farmer's market. Served with lettuce, cheese, cilantro, avacado and onions, will do again, with or without the goat!

Goat tacos. One review. Rated most popular(?!). Seems unlikely to me. Can anyone explain this system?
