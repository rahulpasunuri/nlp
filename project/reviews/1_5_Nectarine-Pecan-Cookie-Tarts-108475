These were kind of a disapointment. While they were fairly easy to make, they weren't anything special. I would recommend rolling the dough a little thicker because they are too hard to transfer otherwise. I just brushed the apricot preserves on right from the jar. I also would not let these sit out too long because the crust gets soggy. They are not very filling, so if your looking for a "lighter" dessert these are good.
