This was delicious. The 2nd time I made it, I subbed the pancetta with real bacon bits and used balsamic vinegar. It turned out just as well.

Loved it! However one word of advice: be very carfeul adding the thyme leaves and vinegar, lots of oil splattering that made a nice mess of my stovetop but it was all worth it in the end.

Loved this dish. Substituted lean bacon for the pancetta and still came out wonderfully. Followed recommendation to use pine nuts/goat cheese--DELICIOUS. YUM YUM YUM YUM

I followed the suggestions to put the goat cheese into patties and bake them. I used bread crumbs which worked very well and the cheese didn't melt too much. I also used dried cranberries - they make them with cherry flavor - which was a great substitute. This recipe is a definite keeper!

Try keeping the goat cheese in the form of a patty, coat it with pine nuts and toast the whole thing lightly in a dry pan. Place on top of your finished salad. Very yummy and adds a great textural element. I stole this trick from "New Wave Cafe" in Philly.

This was a wonderful winter salad, but VERY rich. Pouring the hot dressing directly over the goat cheese melted it a bit too much for my taste. Next time I will add the cheese in last, and serve smaller portions. Rave reviews from the dinner guests.

This is a great salad. We coated goat cheese rounds with macadamia nuts and sauteed in olive oil instead. We've made it several times with rave reviews.

Goat Cheese was the key for choosing this recipe. My dinner guests loved it. I added just a few Grap tomatoes to ass a little sweetness. I am making it again tonight!

I had a similar salad in a Tavern in Ct. The best I have ever had. I substitued the sherry with a rasberry champagne vinegar and added pistacio nuts

too much pancetta and I like bacon better. was not a real hit. My brother said to keep the goat cheese and the dressing, axe the pancetta and cherries.

This was an okay salad and easy to prepare, but I've had better salads made with the same ingredients. The goat cheese and dried cherry combo is very good together, especially if you add in toasted walnuts, or if you've got the time, candied walnuts - my family just didn't care for the dressing much.

I made this salad for a dinner party at which one of the quests is a chef. I was so excited to get rave reviews on this salad from all of the quests, including the chef. It was delicious! I rinsed the dried cherries under hot water for a minute or two to plump them a little.

I love this recipe!! The only thing I added the dried cherries in the sauce in order to let them soak some of the of the dressing. It makes the cherries moist and flavorful!!

Excellent recipe. Was a big hit at a dinner party. I used dried cranberries instead of dried cherries. Would definately make it again.

This is a knockout salad; you will actually get requests for seconds. I worried that the warm dressing would melt the goat cheese and make the salad too gooey, so I added the cheese last--just put a small round slice in the center of each salad and ground some fresh pepper over it. Also, the dried cherries tend to settle at the bottom of the bowl, so be sure to toss again well. I used regular bacon instead of the pancetta and omitted the olive oil. Delicious.

a dreamy salad... i substituted baby spinach for the mesclun and was well impressed with the tender results. i also bought fresh cherries and dried them so that they retained the tiniest bit of juice. magnificent. i highly recommend this dish.

A perfect winter salad! I made it for my Christmas dinner and it was a big hit.

I couldn't get pancetta,so I used prosciutto and it worked really well. It is an interesting combination of tastes, but it does work well. It was a good appetizer before a richer entree.

It was a great salad and dressing. I will make it again but the baked goat cheese slices were fussy work.

Works well w/ proscuitto if olive oil is increased.
