Although I haven't yet attempted this recipe I've had this dish at a local vegetarian restaurant...except they "carmalized" the fennel. It was DELICIOUS!

The combination of fennel and parmigiano-reggiano is classic and wonderful just as it is. Don't change a thing.

I added some olive oil, lemon juice, "fleur de sel" and freshly ground pepper... something was missing. I will do it again my way

Raw fennel is crisper and has a better texture when you soak it in ice water for about 30 minutes, and completely dry it before serving (salad spinner works great). Also, this recipe is just crying for a sprinkling of very good extra virgin olive oil to bring the flavors together.

This is much better broiled. Core and thinly slice the fennel, brush with olive oil, then salt and pepper. Top with parmesan and broil until fennel is fork tender. THEN it's four forks, and very addictive
