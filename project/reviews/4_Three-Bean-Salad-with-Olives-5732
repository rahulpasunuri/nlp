Super good! I was initially taken back by the black-eyed peas used as I find that bean disgusting and tasting like dirt; however, with this combination it works out to be fantastic. The olives take the "dirty" bean to a level of enjoyment that I was SHOCKED by! I strongly recommend making it and, please people, use decent Spanish olives. No $1.89 bottle of presliced briny olives here, it would ruin it.

This is my go-to bean salad. It is good as is but I've also added cooked brown rice to make it a bit heartier and sometimes substitute green beans for one of the canned beans.

I didn't quite have everything this recipe calls for, but it turned out great anyway. I was looking for a way to incorporate black-eyed peas for New Year's, and they fit in perfectly here. I omitted the red & green peppers, (because I didn't have any), and used chopped celery instead. I used apple cider vinegar and also added a handful of sliced large black olives. This recipe was quick & easy.

Well, this is the second night to use another 2 servings of this salad. It has only gotten hotter outside, so I made a dinner in a bowl for 2. Measured out slightly more than 2 servings of the pre-made bean salad. Added 1-1/2 cups cooked and chilled medium shell pasta (uncooked: 1 cup = 3 oz. by weight), and about 6 oz. of M/L shrimp (weight after defrosting and blotting dry) to 2 cups of bean salad. It seemed a bit bland, so I added a nice shake of dried oregano leaves, white wine vinegar, and black pepper, and refrigerated it about 2 hours before serving. DELICIOUS. Served it over fresh spinach with baguette bread on the side. YUM.

WOW!!! This sure made a lot of salad. Hubby loves 3-bean salad, but I cannot stand the canned stuff. So I made the whole recipe for the 2 of us. (Who wants to goof with leftover half cans of beans?) Followed the recipe exactly, except for subbing some Enova for part of the olive oil and sweet yellow onion for the red. Truly hope it is as good on the fourth night as it was tonight!!! Served it with BBQ'd brats on baguette bread on a day that got to 101 degrees. Good meal to not add any heat to the kitchen.

This is my potluck standby recipe--its amazing and very easy to make. My only modification is to add more vinegar as I feel it needs more flavor if you follow the recipe exactly.

I've been making salad since it was published. It's one of my standards for entertaining. I love good recipes that you can prepare ahead of time and this one of them.

Had forty people coming for a buffet dinner...this dish was a perfect addition to spiral ham, baby croissant, pasta salad, and apple pie. Most people asked for the recipe, including some husbands. To me, this is the sign of a winning recipe. It tripled very well though I did add more dressing to add a little more zip.

Great dish. Have made this twice already and have been asked for the recipe. Easy and quick to make, I made exactly as recipe is written with no substitutions.

My family loves bean salad - but I made a few changes in beans using wax and red kidney with green beans - the olives and red bell pepper make this recipe great - I loved the oregno in the dressing, but it still seemed flat so I added a good quality balsamic vingerette and it really sparked it up - I took it to a potluck and everyone asked for the recipe and fought over the limited leftovers.

I love 3-bean salad and this is a great recipe. I actually changed it a bit and made it a 4-bean salad by adding a can of cut green beans. I also threw in a small jar of pimentos in addition to the pimentos that were in the olives because I really like them. A very tasty salad - perfect for a summertime lunch.

Very good dish. I agree with the other reviewers - easy to make, colorful, and very yummy. My husband raved and said he could eat it once a week. A definate keeper.

This dish was very easy to make and very colourful. I used 19 oz tins of mixed beans (red kidney, black eyed peas, pinto and garbonzo) and let the salad sit overnight. I found the salad not tangy enough and somewhat bland (probably due to the extra beans)and so, I added extra marinade (1/2 the recipe)close to serving. This did the trick.

The addition of the olives really makes this recipe. It's great for a party, easily doubles. My husband and I had the leftovers over pasta with some grated romano and a salad. Terrific.

I don't know if its the brand I used but I did not like black eyed peas in this. Otherwise, it is a definite keeper recipe for the summer's barbecues, potlucks and picnics. Great blend of flavors, colors and textures, Healthy, filling, delicious... and great accompaniment to grilled meats. 'Will be making it over and over again.

Very easy and very yummy. Makes a nice presentation with all the different colors. This salad would be perfect to bring to a pot luck or barbecue or just as a side dish to an Italian meal. I will make this again.

This is a great recipe--very colorful and tasty. I originally made it for a New Year's Eve buffet, but have since found it a great dish to pack at lunch. Each time I use different beans, and it is always good.

EXCELLANT ADDITION TO ANY SUMMER BUFFET. I DID CHANGE THE BEAN VARIETY TO DRAINED CANNED GREEN BEANS, WAX BEANS, AND KIDNEY BEANS, ONLY BECAUSE I WAS TRYING TO RECREATE A RECIPE I USED EARLY IN MY MARRAIGE. I WILL DEFINITELY TRY IT AGAIN USING THE BEANS AS LISTED. MY FAMILY LOVED IT. THANK YOU
