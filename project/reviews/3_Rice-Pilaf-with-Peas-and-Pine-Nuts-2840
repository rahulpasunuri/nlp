I was pleased to find this recipe and even more pleased that I had everything in the house to make it. I embellished a bit - adding minced garlic and seasoned with salt and pepper as I went along, and used less liquid than thr recipe called for. I quadrupled the recipe which worked nicely. Although after adding the peas and giving the dish a taste - it was incredibly bland. Since we were bringing this to a dinner party...I needed to fix it. I added a lot more salt and some dry mustard powder along with a little garlic powder. I spooned it into a baker/serving dish and then sprinkled the top with crumbled feta cheese. It needed all the salt it could get and ended up much better than I thought it might. So 2 stars the way its written, and 3 stars for the way I made it.

Of course, the recipe in itself is rather dull, but then it's just a simple side-dish. I've made something similar to this and served it with Turkish-style kebabs with garlic-yogurt sauce and a tomato-cucumber salad. F...... terrific!

Pretty, but rather bland. It should have more flavor to match its looks. The pine nuts were a good addition. My kids loved it.

Pretty good. I used 1 cup of rice, vegetable bouillon, and a little white wine... it cooked up perfectly. My husband and guest liked it very much also. Nice colors; had it with pork roast.

This recipe was rather dull. It maybe could be improved by adding white wine in place of some of the broth. The broth to rice ratio was also off - the finished pilaf was watery, and I had to let it simmer without a lid for a few minutes before serving. Not an awful recipe, but nothing special either.

I'm a recent college graduate cooking for myself for the first time and I found this rice to be easy to make, and very tasty. The only problem I found is that my white stirring spoon is now stained by the yellow seasoning stuff. I'll make it again though.

This is a wonderful, delicious recipe! I have served it many times for dinner parties with barbecued salmon or flank steak. It is so easy and everyone loves it!

From all the positive reviews, I thought this would be a great dish. Anything but. Call me weird, but this was bland and boring. Plus, the tumeric stained my countertops! Thank goodness I made this dish prior to a dinner party to try it- it got a thumbs down from everyone in my family!

This was a nice side dish with seafood. I think next time I would add some chopped mint right before serving.

Was responsible for a side dish for a fondue dinner party, and made this. Was a hit, I got many favorable comments. I left out the pine nuts but otherwise made it as is.

actually i should give it 3.5 forks. i made this to accompany a seafood dish. the color was wonderful and the flavor full. i left out the pine nuts and used vegetable broth instead. i didn't think anything was lacking. i definitely plan to keep this recipe for more regular use.

This was really excellent. I made it for a dinner party for 10, the recipe is easily increased. I was asked by my mother-in-law to make it for a birthday party for 50! It should be no problem.

This was outstanding. I added some diced, steamed carrots and everyone raved about it. There were no leftovers. I'll definitely make this again.

This recipe adds a lot of interest to plain long grain rice. The tumeric lends a delightful golden color to the rice, which contrasts nicely with the peas. I used tiny ones, which didn't overwhelm the rice. I left out the pine nuts. My husband, who usually finds rice "boring", ate three servings!
