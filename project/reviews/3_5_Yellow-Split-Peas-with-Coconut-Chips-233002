I simplified by skipping the coconut chips and thought this was just okay. There are dals out there with fewer ingredients (that is, smaller amounts of expensive spices) that are just as good, if not better.

ok, the coconut chip step was waayy to much for me. I used the basic recipe and subbed 1 can coconut milk for broth. I raised the spice amounts, but maybe my spices were old and weak. I sauteed and then added chopped onion, celery and carrot to increase the vegetable impact of the dish. I forgot to, but will next time, cook the spices in some of the coconut milk fat, like you do with Thai food. Made Jasmine rice and served together, as there was plenty of delicious coconutty broth. Also, served it with shredded dry coconut to sprinkle on top. Since I made so many modifications it was sort of a hassle to make and adjust. It got more tasty on the second day. Ultimately, its goodness will probably depend how big a split pea fan you are.

Delicious and so easy. My husband thought it rivaled the best restaurant dal he's had. I wasn't sure whether I should drain off the excess water from the soaked peas before adding them to the boiling water: I ended up leaving the extra in, and it took a looooooooong time for the dal to thicken, so next time I'll drain it and see what happens. I did not have turmeric, but some research on the 'net indicated I could either leave it our or substitute dry mustard; I used dry mustard. Will definitely make it again. (Oh--and I skipped the coconut altogether.)
