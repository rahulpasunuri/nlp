I discovered the recipe while trying to find something to do with a large batch of extra whipped cream. Luckily for me, I also had lady fingers and a jar of lemon curd (bought from the jam and jelly section of the grocery store) in the cupboard. So for those of you out there who might not be interested in making your own curd, store bought worked well, I just nuked it in the microwave to soften it up a little before folding it in with the whipped cream. I also didn't make my own candied peel, but topped the charolettes with a little lemon zest and the presentation was adorable. Enjoy.

Phenomenal!! Absolutely delicious. Even though our local store had run out of lady fingers, I was able to substitute Nilla Wafers in their place... I think the unexpected splash of vanilla flavor they lent went perfectly with the bright lemony notes! Having made it already though, I will not be lining the souffle dishes with cellophane the next time. When I attempted the unmolding, I put them right back in the cups as they never would have held their shape on their own. Perhaps I cooked the curd too long? Anyway, this dessert was absolutely divine nevertheless; this, of course, coming from someone who loves lemons!!

Surprisingly light, refreshing dessert. I have made this two times. The first time, I made the individual charlottes per the instructions. The second time, I put the ladyfingers around the sides and the bottom of an eight-inch bowl. Then added all of the lemon curd and topped it with the lemon peel mix. I assembled this a day ahead of serving. It was actually good for several days.

I made this for my husband and some friends and they were so impressed with it that they took a picture. The charlottes looked so pretty and they separated from the plastic wrap easily. I was amazed. I'll make it again but I might try that other lemon dessert that another reviewer suggested.

It unmolded perfectly and looked beyond homemade! The flavor was just the right amount of lemon and sugar!

I've made this twice. Both times, I got rave reviews. It's definitely a new favorite!

I made this recipe for a gourmet group and everyone loved it. The presentation is wonderful and even my husband, who does not care for lemon desserts, liked it. I did have trouble with the lemon curd - my thermometer broke so I just cooked it for the 6 minutes as suggested. It needs to cook longer to be thick enough - even boiled. I had to re-heat it after I added the whipped cream - which still worked, but it probably would have been even better had I prepared it properly.

We had this dessert for Easter and it was quite good. The lady fingers make for a nice presentation and the filling is flavorful. HOWEVER, if you want an outstanding do-ahead lemon dessert then I recommend the Frozen Lemon Mousse with Strawberry Mint Sauce from Epicurious. It is delicious!
