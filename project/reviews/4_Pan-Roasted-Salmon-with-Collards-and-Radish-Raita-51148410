I forgot to add the vinegar, even so, this is definitely a "keeper" The raita makes the dish.

Now having actually made this, it's good-for-a-weeknight, but not life changing. The Raita was definitely the best part - 2 of us ate that all up. We cedar-plank grilled the salmon, so that was good, but not this recipe. The greens were sort of dull - I added white wine and some curry powder, and a lot more garlic, which helped. They were quite nice at 15 minutes, still a bit crunchy, but then by the time the salmon was finished it had been 30 minutes and they were also good, but softer. They were young, garden fresh leaves to begin with, though.

Collards are tender in 10-15 minutes if they are young fresh leaves... I have even used them uncooked in a salad, just marinated in balsamic vinegar with olive oil for 30 minnutes. If they are the big old tough things then you need a different recipe.

I thought this was an excellent recipe! I added some spices for the salmon, but other than that, I followed the recipe. I thought the raita complimentd the collard greens as well as the salmon. All three together was exceptional! Loved it.

No way are collards tender in 10-15 minutes.

Made this for dinner tonight, it was so good that I would've felt guilty had it not been healthy!
