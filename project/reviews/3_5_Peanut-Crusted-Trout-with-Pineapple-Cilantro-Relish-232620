I can't believe only 5 folks have commented. I make this now and then with great results. A few tweeks. I use canned crushed pineapple (boo hiss) but I usually have on hand. I use peanut oil to enhance the peanut flavor and add chilli garlic sauce again I usually have it on hand. A little extra lime juice all so helps. Enjoy

My wife loved it, and I thought it was very, very good. We liked the coating and the salsa was very good with it. I might try pecans, though, next time.

I'd make this again, but perhaps with different nuts (pine nuts? hazelnuts?) or at least the unsalted ones as called for. I used salted which the BF liked, but I wasn't so keen on. I made a full recipe for 3/4 lb of trout, which may have been the problem. I served it with roasted butternut squash soup, balsamic glazed asparagus and crusty bread. The pineapple salsa is addictive and makes a lot, even though I halved that part of the recipe.

I took other's advice and upped the ginger and peanuts (also used salted peanuts) and the fish was so flavorful. The salsa went great with the taste of the fish. This will go into my fish rotation for sure!

This has potential with some tweaking: I'd use more ginger and perhaps as the previous reviewer suggested, more peanuts. I'd also cut the salt to 1/2 tsp. I had lots of relish left over too but I think it'll be delicious over plain grilled or baked fish.

I made this for my parents and wife. I think I'd use a little more peanuts next time or substitute a more flavorful nut. I also was puzzled by the excessive amount of relish left over, but will use this on burgers tomorrow.
