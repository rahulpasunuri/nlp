Saw the photo in Gourmet this month and decided to try it. Very impressive presentation. Save yourself time, money and many steps by using Florida lobster tails. Cut into "knuckles" and start recipe at stir fry. Found the fermented black beans at a gourmet market here. "Ground" a 1/4 lb piece of boneless pork in the mini food processor after chopping the ginger and garlic. Serve over rice or rice noodles to soak up the sauce.
