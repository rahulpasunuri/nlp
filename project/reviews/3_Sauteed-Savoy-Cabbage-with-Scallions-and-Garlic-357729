Agree with another commenter that the cabbage should be blanched before adding to the garlic and scallions instead of adding water to the whole mix. I like this side crunchy instead of soggy so when I blanch the cabbage it comes out nicer. This can be a really cheap alternative to a side salad. I like it ok and will continue to make it.

I made it as directed and found it pretty flavorless. After I added sesame oil and soy sauce, it was ok, but I wouldn't make it again!

Adding water to the sautéed scallions, garlic and cabbage is an error in execution. The cabbage should first be briefly blanched in boiling salted water for a few minuets, drained and then added to the skillet to take on the flavour of the sautéed garlic and scallions. Pouring water into the skillet simply robs the dish of those beautiful garlic oils. No matter how much water you drive of through evaporation, you will be left with a soggy mess!

I followed the directions exactly and thought it was easy and flavorful.

An excellent, healthy recipe that will become a go-to vegetable side dish. We used green garlic and spring onions (instead of regular garlic and scallions) because it's the start of spring and they are fresh at the farmers' market. Be liberal with the salt and it's not at all bland. Best way I've found to prepare cabbage.

We enjoyed it, with addition of thinly sliced celery, and seasoned with soy sauce.

I wasn't very impressed with this dish. I love cabbage, and was really excited for this. We prepared it exactly as instructed. Overall it was rather bland. A few modifications could really improve this.

Quick/easy to make. I used minced garlic with sun dried tomatoes & a dash of white wine vinegar to give it an extra punch.
