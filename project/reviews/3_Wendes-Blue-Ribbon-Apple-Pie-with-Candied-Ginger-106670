Very, very average. Crust was dense and hard. Not recommended.

This pie wasn't bad, but it really wasn't the big hit of ginger with apples that I was hoping for. I only tasted the ginger if I got a piece in the bite I took. If not, no ginger taste at all!

This pie is just wonderful. I couldn't find candied ginger, so I used two tablespoons of ginger preserves -- gave just the right amount of bite and tang to the apples. I followed the recipe exactly except for that and it was just great.
