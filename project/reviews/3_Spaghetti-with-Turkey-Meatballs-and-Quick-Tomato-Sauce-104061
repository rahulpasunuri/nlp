I didn't really like this recipe very much, I felt like the meatballs fell apart in the sauce and the sauce itself was flavorless.

Not serve-it-to-guests good, but perfectly fine for a quick mid-week meal. The meatballs were a little dense for my taste, so I think next time I might mix in some breadcrumbs. Sauce a little one-dimensional -- maybe add a T of tomato paste next time.

Excellent and easy...a big part of the recipe is the kind of turkey sausage you choose...

Excellent! My toddler liked it, too! I made with all turkey sausage because that's all I had on hand. I prefer more dark meat anyway.

Very tasty and not too time consuming. I'd make again, but have to see if the rugrat enjoys it, too. The sauce was surprisingly tasty given its simplicity. The person who suggested the bay leaf was dead on! Good one!

that was pretty darn good! the only change i did was addition of one bay leaf to the sauce. fast and delicious!

This is delicious! The meatballs are light and moist and the tomato sauce is fresh and tasty. This will be one of our favorites. I thought it took a bit longer than anticipated, however.

Easy to make and offers a taste not expected from meatballs. Kids will love this one and it will help them get used to the subtle tastes of fresh herbs.

This was relatively quick and simple, and it tasted delicious! I served it over penne with a side of sauteed broccolini, and my boyfriend and I all but licked our plates! Definitely use fresh parsley and thyme as it adds wonderful flavor.

Liked it! Easy and really good. I added oregano to the sauce. Next time i might add more salt to the sauce as well.

Very good. I used Costco's Nina tomatoes (they are San Marzano tomatoes -- VERY tomatoey and 4.95 for a huge can) and chicken sausage because it's what I could find. The second time around I replaced the 6TB cheese with 6TB Panko breadcrumbs and liked it too, and less guilt.

All I know is that these were the best-tasting meatballs I've ever made. My husband said "You're allowed to make this whenever you want."

The turkey meatballs were great,especially for those of us watching our calories. It was easier for me to find chicken rather than turkey sausage. The sauce was a little weak, even compared to some jar varieties. However, when I spooned leftover meatballs and sauce into a baguette the next day, the sauce had gained some more character. Good weeknight meal.

This is delicious! I added one large hot italian sausage link to the ground turkey. It gave it a little zing. I cooked my meatballs in the oil before adding the tomatoes. The sauce was great because it was thicker than traditional spaghetti sauce. Great dish!

I used bowtie pasta instead of the spaghetti and it worked well. Meatballs were very tasty and the sauce was, as stated, quick. An easy, weekday meal.

My husband made this last week and it was superb. Made great left-overs too. Definite repeat!

Wasn't impressed with this recipe, not a whole lot of taste. Certainly not worth the effort when compared to a bottle sauce, and arguably worth it for the healthier turkey.

I have not made this recipe as of yet; The ingredients are very similar to mine. The only difference I have is the method of cooking the meatballs. I prepare as very similar to above; For cooking, I place raw turkey meatballs in the sauce. I let the sauce do the cooking for me. It's a slower process, but the turkey meatballs will melt in your mouth. I do not recommend Ground Turkey Breast as an alternative. Since it is the white meat part of the turkey, the meat will dry out faster. Which means that your cooking time will decrease. If you're like me where you like your food tasty -- a slower process is better without the use of turkey breast!

Have not made this one. To save even more on fat, use ground turkey BREAST, instead of the ground turkey. BIG diff. in fat content!!!! For meatballs, take the ground breast, add breadcrumbs, Italian spices, an egg (or egg beaters), salt/pepper, a few dashes worchestire sauce, a squeeze of ketchup. Then in a food processor (or finely chop), add some onion, fresh garlic and PORTABELLA mushrooms. Blend, or chop till fine. I also like to add a pinch dried crushed rosemary (YUM!!). Blend all w/ the meat mix. Roll into balls & place in a non stick oven safe LG. pan (sprayed w/ PAM). Bake at about 350 for about 10 minutes. Add to sauce, and simmer.

This was my first attempt at making meatballs, and I found the recipe very easy. In general I try to use ground turkey more than ground beef as it is a it leaner, so I was glad to stumble across this recipe. I even used spaghetti sauce from a jar and doctored it up a bit and it tasted great.

Don't use the turkey sausage. You only save a few grams of fat per sausage, and give up ALL the flavor of a nice pork sausage. Other than that, this was a pretty OK recipe.

This is not gourmet fare, but I don't believe it was meant to be. Using turkey sausage added lots of flavor to the meatballs, and I found them to be quite acceptable. I browned them, then let them cook in the sauce, so they stayed moist. Kids like it and it's a bit healthier than the usual meatball.

I've been cookimg at home and in resturants for thirty years. Have been a subcriber to both mags for twenty. But, these meatballs were the dryest, most tastless things I've ever eaten. Even my dog spit the meatballs out and ate the leftover pasta. Sorry. The sauce was fine.

This was very diappointing. Meatballs were rubbery and not very tasty. Not sure if I did something wrong but somehow this just didn't work.

Very good tomatoe sauce recipe, I added some mushy tomatoes from the fridge and cooked slowly

This was a great family weeknight recipe. The only thing is that ground turkey or turkey saucige is not always readily available. So then I would do it with chicken.Would definitely do it again.

Found the recipe extremely easy to accomplish. The results were absolutely delicious. However, I added a few sprinkles of cayenne red pepper to the sauce during the simmering. That gave the dish a savory hint of tang.
