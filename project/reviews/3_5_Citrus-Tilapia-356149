My husband started eating this and "Ummmm! Oh, I love it! Ohhh! Ummm!" I guess he likes it.

I was willing to try this despite the negative reviews and I am sorry to say, I also did not like it. I followed the recipe for the glaze exactly as written, used only fresh ingredients and it still failed miserably. I am very experienced in the kitchen, and love citrus and ginger but this is inedible. Thankfully, I tasted the glaze before adding the fish and decided against it.

Very tasty! Quick, and easy too season and cook. Tilapia is my favorite. The citrus flavor goes well with a nice Hoegaarden (a delicious Belgian Whitbeer) . And woot! Something really tasty that me and my (semi) vegetarian girlfriend can agree on.

Quick, easy, good flavor combination recipe - it could be adapted to any white fish. I'd probably use a little more ginger next time.

Rating: 4
Simple and easy. I didn't read the recipe fully before making it and ended up using 1/2 c oj, plus the juice and zest of 1 lemon, then added the juice of 1/2 of another orange to balance it out. When cooking I added a splash of coconut milk for fun. My 2.5 yr old exclaimed that the fish was a "tasty treat" I guess because the sauce is a little sweet? Well received by the whole family. PS - I also dusted the fish in 1/2 flour, 1/2 panko for texture. Anyway, it's a good and quick weeknight meal.

I am so glad I tried this recipe. I made this for my family (husband, 5yr old, and 3yr old) and they loved it! I doubled the sauce and am very glad that I did because it was delicious. This one is definitely a keeper. So easy and so easy.

Loved this recipe. My tilapia was quite thick so I covered the skillet and cooked for ~7 minutes per side. I combined the flour with white cornmeal for an extra crunchy crust. I had some freshly squeezed lime juice from a previous recipe, so I threw that in the OJ. *LOVE* (PS I, too, would consider doubling the sauce.)

Rating: 4
Tasty, super easy, even the toddler liked it. I might vary the flour coating next time based on reviews, and I'll be careful to not crowd the filets. Otherwise, delicious and simple.

Just made this again tonight. Used store-bought OJ this time (but fresh lemon) as I didn't have any oranges around. Like another reviewer, I used a gluten free flour (brown rice flour) which gave it a much better, grittier crust- I like that texture- and made for great frying. Last time I made this I used olive oil rather than butter to be a little healthier, but this time I went for butter. SO GOOD. I have no tweaks for the recipe, which is rare. I really like this recipe for a quick week night meal but it's also great for company.

Love this recipe! Have made it several times already. We use a gluten free flour to coat the fish to make this a gluten free recipe. It's delicious and light and easy! Can't ask for anything more. We followed it pretty exactly, except used lemon juice in a container and skipped the zest.

I made this successfully the very first time and just modified it a bit adding both ginger and garlic, plus zest from 2 lemons, plus a splash of mango juice and white wine... it was great!

Rating: 1
I HATE this recipe! (Made exactly as the recipe described) I made this because I wanted to make something healthy and refreshing..(and because of the good reviews?!?!). I like tilapia - and have made it several times different ways. Anyway...I think this is much to ascetic. It needs something to balance it out. Two things I was thankful for this day : 1. That I didn't invite friends over (like I considered) and 2. That my parents called just as my husband and I tried this to invite us out to eat for Chinese food.

I join the raving fans for this delicious and easy to prepare dish. I made it mostly per the recipe. There are lots of ways to change it up. I will make this often.

Rating: 4
This was awesome, even though I didn't have a lemon. I used a blood orange, so it looked like it had a rasberry sauce on it, but it was delicious! I can't wait to try it again, this time with the lemon.

Rating: 3
very simple weeknight meal. Total cooking time is about 10 min, and that includes the time it takes to juice the oranges. Don't make extra sauce as reviewers suggest, the amount the recipe calls for is spot-on (and I'm an extra sauce kind of person)

Rating: 3
Made this tonight. I only had one orange on hand, so I added some chicken stock to make the 1/2 cup. I also added a tiny pinch of sugar to the lemon juice. I just wish I had made more of the glaze, it was delicious! Paired it with rice

This recipe went horribly wrong and was pretty much inedible. Way way way too citrus-y.Totally embarrassed myself in front of someone I was cooking for.

Light, refreshing, perfect paired with a bottle of white wine and coconut rice!

Very good - a delicious sauce for delicate fish. The recipe amount makes just enough sauce to coat the fish. Next time, i will make double the sauce, reserve half, and serve it over rice.

Quick & easy, served with rice, asparagus & artichoke hearts in lemon butter sauce - husband liked it so I'm happy

This was excellent. The glaze is so easy and quick, and made the tilapia so good that even fish-phobic young people liked it.

Rating: 4
This was very delicious! I adjusted the recipe, eliminating the flour, oil and butter and I baked the tilapia with pieces of fresh pineapple and papaya in the pan next to the fish for around 25 minutes at 375 degrees. The ginger is, in my opinion, the ingredient that makes this dish fantastic.

Rating: 4
Wonderful and easy. I had blood orange juice on hand so used that, beautiful color and a bit sweeter than regular orange juice.

Rating: 4
Wonderful! With plenty of pepper, the orange glaze with ginger goes well beyond tangy!

Rating: 4
Delicious and easy. I don't know why others had difficulty with the sauce - I was able to make mine balanced and delicious with the recipe ingredients - maybe it's the orange juice quality? This is a great weeknight dinner. It was so fast to make. Quick, healthy, and yummy. I gave it 4-stars because I think that it is so difficult to find a fast recipe that also tastes this good. Served it to my family including two teenagers and everyone wanted more. Side dishes were Saffron Rice Pilaf (another great Epicurious recipe) and steamed fresh green beans. This will definitely make my regular recipe rotation.

I ended up mixing orange and grapefruit juice b/c only had one small orange on hand. The dish was tasty overall, but the sauce a little tart...I might try adding a little brown sugar next time and maybe something fresh and herbal like basil or mint. Definitely a fast, easy dish to keep in the recipe larder though.

Rating: 4
Delicious and very simple! It was served with steamed asparagus, and there was enough sauce to top the veggies. Yum!

Very nice and simple! Easy to do and it taste delicious. The only thing is the sauce, there's not enough! Next time I'll double the sauce if not more, I used blood orange and it gives a very nice color!

Okay - it was quick, easy, and light. However, there was no sauce to speak of - I coated the filets on one side - and not a whole lot of flavor.

Want recipes that are faster than picking up take out? We do. This is one of the 30 in my file. It's faster, cheaper and MUCH more nutritious (not to mention delicious) than fast food. Dinner's ready in under a half an hour around here.

I made 1 1/2 lbs of tilapia. I expanded the ingredients for the sauce but still fell short. This recipe was better than I had anticipated. Pretty simple too !

This was inedible. Tasted like someone dumped a margarita over the fish. We were very disappointed.

Made this for the first time tonight and it's now my go-to recipe for tilapia (I had been making just the fish part of the fish taco recipe here on epicurious.) My husband preferred this recipe - and enjoyed the citrus flavors.

Delicious and simple to make. The glaze is very tasty - I was afraid it was going to come out syrupy sweet, but it had a great tang to it. Loved it on top of whole grain rice.

I don't understand why this recipe has gotten so many rave reviews. The sauce tasted like orangeade--powerfully sweet & sour, without any subtlety whatsoever. I had to add a bunch of stuff (white wine, shallots, soy sauce) just to make it edible.

Rating: 3
So good! I didn't have a lemon on hand, so I used a little bit of white wine vinegar in the sauce to add some acidity. I was afraid it would be too sweet, but it was delicious. A surprisingly impressive dish, considering how easy it is to prepare.

Made this with my husband two nights ago...delish! very light and summery. We made "Green Beans and zucchini with sauce verte" as a side dish. Perfect!

This is a quick, healthy, kid-friendly dish. The sauce is sweet and I needed to add extra salt. But otherwise this is a very good mid-week dinner.

Rating: 4
Very easy; Very good! I'm gluten free so I substituted equal parts of sweeet rice flour and brown rice flour for the all-pupose flour. I also did not return the fish to the skillet to simmer in the sauce, but rather reduced the liquid and then poured it on top of the fish just before serving. MmmmMmm. My under 10 girls both loved it!

I combined the Orange, Lemon, zest,and Ginger in a bowl for 30 minutes to allow the flavors to mingle. It was perfect!

Excellent. I made it with the mashed sweet potatoes from another Tilapia recipe and asparagus. This is a "keeper"

Rating: 4
Good gracious, this was GOOD! I was in too much of a hurry perhaps and didn't read thru the sauce directions (a bad habit of mine). As a result, I added the orange juice, lemon juice, zest and ginger all at once into the pan. The results were still fantastic. I loved the "brown butter" taste to the sauce, so I encourage keeping butter in the recipe (it's not so much, after all). I thought the Tilapia with Lime Butter - from this site - was good, but this beats it...a fresh and bright taste that only citrus can give.

skipped the butter, used only a bit of olive oil, then used half an orange, a meyer lemon and some of its zest, and some ground ginger. DELICIOUS. i was practically licking the pan!!

This recipe was fast and fabulous! I served mango salad and coconut rice with it. Everyone loved it!

This is a first rate recipe -- easy enough for every night, but with modest adaptations can be turned into a guest meal. I served it with risotto and asparagus. I added a bit of sesame oil to the glaze, just for a touch of complexity. For appearance, I sliced an orange, placed the slices on the skillet until they caramelized, and served the filets with a slice of orange on top. It adds a nice visual effect even for a family meal.

Rating: 3
I wish I could give 3.5 at least for the ease of making this dish. I didn't find the sauce too sweet. I squeezed my own orange to get the juice, only took one. I used the leftover lemon juice to deglaze a second time after reheating and removing the fish. I thought it was a quick and easy meal.

Rating: 1
I have been using recipes from Epicurious for years, and this is the worst one I've ever made. I am shocked by all the positive reviews. I found the sauce so disconcertingly sweet--and I used fresh squeezed juice. It was reminiscent of the flavor of lemon meringue pie filling. I followed the recipe to the letter and am an experienced cook. This sauce is just plain weird.

Rating: 4
My family loved it. It's definitely a keeper recipe. It's a bonus that it's cheap, easy and healthy. I served it with Roasted Potatoes with Herbs (this website), steamed broccoli and Green Salad with Mustard Vinaigrette (also from this website) - the combo worked well together (I wouldn't cook rice with it - you'd be hungry an hour after dinner).

Rating: 4
This recipe is fabulous...it was easy to execute and everyone loved it including my picky 3 year old and 7 year old grandchildren. I too, dusted the filets lighly flour and added some diced shallots. I served it with steamed lemon-oil broccoli and baked yams. Will definetely make again!

Nice flavor and super-fast prep time. If you have more than 4 Tilapia fillets to your pound, recommend increasing the OJ/sauce by a little.

Wonderful week night recipe. Easy and fast.

Rating: 4
Made this last night it was so good I ate nearly 3 servings! Did make some changes since I prefer a punch in the face of taste: To the flour mixture add a little cayanne pepper and curry powder To the sauce added the whole zest of lemon, 3Tbsp lemon juice, and zest of half the orange. Nearly triple the ginger (slightly more to taste) I had a hard time keeping the fish intact when coating with the sauce, but that was probably due to how abnormally large the fillets were, nearly 0.5lb each!

this is a good quick easy dish for weekdays. I sauted some diced shallots in the pan before putting in the citrus juice.

The day I tried this recipe, I didn't have any ginger at home. So I substituted Ginger with green coriander (added at the end as a garnish) and the result was superb, husband lived it!!!! We had it with Pasta and Steamed Brocolli!!!!

I loved this recipe as well. Very tasty and now my other "go-to"recipe for tilapia - the second is the tilapia with chile lime butter on this site. Both are delicious!

What a fantastic recipe! My doctor put me on an allergen-free diet, so I had to make some changes (flax-seed meal instead of flour; all oil instead of oil & butter; pink grapefruit juice with a dash of stevia instead of orange juice), but it was still superb, and totally company-worthy. I've made it 4 times in the past two-and-a-half weeks.

Quick and easy! Served with brocoli and rice. Mistakenly thought I had a lemon at home so was missing the zest. It lacked salt and was on the sweet side. Will definetly make this dish again with a few tweeks.

Hard to believe that something so simple tasted so delicious. [The only thing that was difficult is that I was making the recipe from my iPhone because I had just downloaded the "Epi" app (which is outstanding by the way) and I had to keep scrolling up and down between the ingredient measures and the instructions.] Glaze is simple, attractive and really makes the tilapia--a very mild fish--something special. Yum!

Exceptional dish. I served this with rice and broccoli for a dinner date and was promised a second date if I made it again. I made it slightly more Asian by adding black sesame seeds to the flour.

Excellent! very quick and easy to make, great flavors. Glaze provides something different for a change. Will definitely make again.

Mistakenly thought I had a lemon home while shopping so used bottled lemon juice and lime zest. Only floured one side of fish cooked it in oil first. My husband compared this dish to something one of his favorite restaurants in Antwerp would serve.

I also thought this was excellent - the ginger adds just enough spice and the citrus a nice tang - the combination really works well on the Tilapia. I will make this often!

Delicious, fast and easy. I didn't change anything and it came out perfectly.

I too enjoyed this dish immensely and it was beyond easy. I did not add the fish back in to the pan at the end but instead just sauteed it a tad longer in the beginning. I drizzled the sauce on before serving for a lighter approach. It was refreshing, interesting and flavorful. I served with haricot verts and mashed potatoes. My husband loved it even though he professes to "hate citrus glazes". I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
Wow! I'm amazed such a simple dish can taste so good. I used the whole of the lemon zest and a little extra lemon juice, to suit our taste. The freshly squeezed orange juice gives a beautifully rounded citrus flavour, and the ginger adds to the complexity without standing out. The grated ginger also helps thicken the sauce nicely. The recipe is quick, easy and tastes healthy. I served it with steamed carrots, broccoli and new potatoes. Definitely a keeper, and in my view good enough to serve at a dinner party.
