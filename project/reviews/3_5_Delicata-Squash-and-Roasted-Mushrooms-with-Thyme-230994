Made this last night. Extremely easy to prepare. Would even be fine without the mushrooms (although I love mushrooms) just as a roasted squash dish. Delicata are so easy to use since you can eat the skin. No way I could fit 3 med squash into 1 pan single-layer, but they cooked just fine, even if they didn't "brown". I used dry thyme, but it would be even better with fresh.

Not so good :( Left the peel on and it was tough to chew. No flavor. Will not make this recipe again.

Wow, this was so simple and so delicious. I can't believe I've never thought to roast mushrooms before. I used oyster & button mushrooms, and tossed with whole wheat penne, caramelized onions and wilted spinach to make it a meal. I'm not sure, but next time I might add some chopped tomatoes dressed with olive oil, vinegar, salt, pepper and garlic to see how that tastes.

Made twice (first time I measured quantities and the second time I didn't) and it couldn't have been easier. I used baby bella and button mushrooms. Adults and kids loved it!

I used fresh chanterelles and rehydrated boletes (porcini) mushrooms. I roasted red onion along with the mushrooms - yum! Oven was at about 375-400°...hard to tell exact temp. with my oven. Next time I'll use creminis and maybe shiitakes and definitely the onion.

Perfect marriage of texture and flavors. It says "autumn" and is the tastiest way I've found yet to prepare delicata.

High marks for being an easy, yet distinctive side dish. I'd take 'em out after 25 minutes from a 375 degree oven for best consistency.

We aren't huge thyme fans and I was a little worried about the amount of thyme, so I only used half the amount. It was delicious -- we didn't find it bland at all. I'll definitely make this one again.

This is a great technique for cooking delicata squash. I'll definitely use it again often. I didn't measure anything, I just wung it and I left out the mushrooms since I didn't have any. Very simple and tasy. Great for everyday meals.

I found this too oily, and a little bland. The mushrooms were good, but the squash (and I like squash) did nothing for me. Not sure why this one didn't have the magic, but it didn't.

An oven temp of 375 is great for this and most other squash. It caramellizes the surface without burning.

Unbelievably easy. Even my vegetable-hating guests loved 'em. They were all picking them off the serving plate before we even sat down to eat. Amazingly delicate flavor. But don't bother making them with the mushrooms, nor the frizzled onion or polenta. They're perfect by themselves!

I made mine with I just tossed my squash and mushrooms in the same cassarole and roasted them together. The result was delicious. Fabulous with Salmon en Papilotte w/caramelized onions and currants.

I made as directed (unusual for me) and it was yummy. Next time I would decrease the amount of oil a little, but will definitely make again. I liked not having to peel the squash.

I dotted with butter before slipping the dish into the oven and finished the squash with Parmesan cheese and parsley before serving. A delicous and delicate dish that allows you to appreciate the natural flavor of Delicata.
