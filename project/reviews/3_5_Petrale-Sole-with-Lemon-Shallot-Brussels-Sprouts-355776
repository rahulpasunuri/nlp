This was good. To me, it didn't have the "wow" flavor I'd hoped for but my fam said it was a keeper. I subbed carrots for sprouts and I added wine to the broth & butter. I would fix this again. I suppose next time I should include lemon zest - didn't have one on hand so maybe that made a difference in the flavor.

This was perfect for me today, because I had picked up fresh sole & brussels sprouts, & even a bunch of lemons that had just fallen off my tree. It was pretty quick & straightforward, yet flavorful. Slicing brussels sprouts is rather a pain. I think you could just halve them & cook a little longer with the same effect. I had some leftover shrimp on hand as well, so coated it & sauteed it with the sole. It actually carried the lemon flavor more effectively, so I would consider making it with shrimp instead.

Simply lovely!

I'm usually not so far off from all the other reviews, but.... The fish was good (and I'd make it again, with some changes I used, described below), but the brussel sprouts were pretty much meh (would not make them again). The shallots from the brussel sprouts was good (w a bit of garlic added as suggested by previous comments), so I could see doing a shallot sauce with the fish (we served with couscous) but leaving the sprouts out... Changes to the fish (based on previous comments): added paprika to the coating to give it a bit more flavor, increased the lemon peel a bit, and before coating, sprinkled lemon juice on the fish to give more lemon flavor and to pick up more of the coating. We used regular sole, and it worked fine. Husband and son requested that we make the fish again soon, but that we never ever bring brussel sprouts into the house again.... I'll give them a year off and then try a new recipe ;)

Sorry to disagree, but my family found this a bland recipe. I followed this recipe exactly. First of all, adding the lemon zest to the flour moistens it with the result that the fish does not turn out crisp, but rather soggy even on medium-high heat. Secondly, the flavor of the shallots is too strong for Petrale Sole and we did not care for the brussel sprouts cooked in vegetable broth. If you agree with me, check out the other Petrale recipe on this site titled "Pan-Seared Petrale Sole with Winter Vegetables". It delivers everything this recipe doesn't.

The brussel sprouts preparation is delicious. Even my non-brussel sprouts-loving husband liked them. I probably shouldn't review the fish, because we are on a fat- restricted diet so I first pan seared them in olive oil Pam cooking spray (after breading as directed), then, once browned and partially cooked through, I finished them by poaching in a liquid of white wine, vegetable stock and lemon juice. It was good--just needed some seasoning. I will make this again.

The brussels sprouts were excellent and that preparation will be applied to other menus. The fish, not so much. The heat turns out to be a factor, I think, and "medium heat" may not be enough to achieve the desired browning. This is not to say the recipe is bad. I simply think the temperature for cooking the fish may be an issue for some.

This was a big hit, and really simple to make! I made a few changes: I used almond meal instead of flour to make it gluten-free, and I used a lime instead of a lemon, since that's what I had. I also cooked the fish in the oven (at 400, then a quick broil to brown it) while I cooked the brussels sprouts, which simplified things.

Very easy and quick. I would make the brussel sprouts first and then fry the fish in the same frying pan because the fish cooks very quickly.

I'm only reviewing the brussel sprouts portion as I served this with swordfish in a lemon butter sauce. But, the brussel sprouts were good with the addition of 4 cloves of garlic while sauteing the shallots. I'll actually probably double the amount of garlic if I make this again. If you are looking for a way to make brussel sprouts appetizing to everyone, this is the way to go.

Loved the brussel sprouts! Used chicken broth instead of veggie. The fish was yummy but not anything special. I would cook the Brussels at the same time as the fish due to the fish not staying warm. I will make this again.

Wonderful dish, the Brussels sprouts were very good. I would use less salt.

I was mad at my father and had him cook this for my mother and I. (Every parent's fantasy, I know!.) The brussels sprouts had an amazing flavor! I was a little disappointed with how salty the sole turned out. However, when a forkful had both fish and cabbage the taste was simply wonderful. When I actually cook this, I will be sure to pare down the salt.

This is a quick and easy dinner. The best brussel sprout recipe I have made.

Wonderful recipe. I used just one skillet (not 2 as called for in the recipe), keeping the cooked fish warm in a 180 degree oven (along with the serving plates), while I cooked the second batch of fish. Petrale cooks very fast. Then placed all the cooked fish in the warm oven while cooking the shallots and sprouts. Next time I'll use 1/2 as much salt and pepper in the flour, but that's just me. Couldn't taste the grated lemon peel. My wife called it exceptional. Served with a chilled Pinot Grigio. Sublime.

I gave this a 4 fork based on how wonderful it was for how quick and easy! Brussels sprouts are a winner!!

An out of town friend showed up unexpectedly and this meal was the perfect solution. I used 12 oz frozen orange roughy fillets (2 fillets) and it was enough fish for all 3 of us & for hubby and friend to get seconds of the brussels. Delicious and fun to make!

I thought this was great. It had a clean light flavor. I halved the butter and used tilapia instead of sole. I will be doubling the brussels sprouts portion of the recipe next time because I enjoyed them so much. This is a keeper!

Wish I could give this 3.5 stars; it was excellent, easy, pretty and my husband loved the brussel sprouts, which he usually won't even try. I served with rice on the side, and thought the fish benefited from a slice of lemon on top when serving. Used tilapia instead of the unavailable sole since it's both suitable for cooking and sustainably harvested. Could solve leeleah's problem too. Speeded up the brussel sprout cooking time by covering the pan for a couple of minutes.

Fish should be cooked last as it became to mushy while sitting. Sprouts had wonderful flavor will make them again with different fish.

As a person who doesn't eat often fish. I found this recipe very simple and I really liked it. I added it in my favorites and I will redo it without any hesitation.

Did I say "mmmmm...." when I tasted this? No. It was okay, but too bland for my taste. I used 2 tsp. olive oil to saute the veggies and cooked them before I cooked the fish. Reheated when fish was ready and halved the butter. I used schrod, which worked nicely, and cooked all the fish in one skillet with 1 tablespoon olive oil.

I tried substituting Dover sole, which didn't work well at all, and I wouldn't advise trying this recipe that fish. Also, my brussel sprouts required 1/2 again as much time (approx. 15 min.) to become tender. However, I really liked the flavors of this dish and will try it again with a more substantial fish (and even thinner sliced sprouts).

I followed this recipe exactly-- it was quick and easy, perfect for a weeknight. its flavors were simple, but clean-- the simple white fish and the tangy sprouts and really complimented each other. my fishmonger didn't have the specified type of sole, so i went with basic sole--i would probably use a firmer fish, such as halibut next time. all in all, my fiance and i found this dish to be really good, and satisfying on a chilly fall evening!

Easy, delicious, healthful. I skipped the butter and didn't miss it.

This was phenomenal. I would absolutely make it again and it was SO easy! My boyfriend usually is the one to cook the fish but I maintained that I wanted to be the one to manage and what do you know - HE LOVED IT. He also doesn't usually care much for brussels sprouts but really enjoyed them cooked this way. They weren't bitter at all and instead had really soaked up the essence of the shallots and broth. The hints of lemon on the fish were also a really nice touch. Easily a four-fork recipe!
