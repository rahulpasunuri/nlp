This is one of the worst things I've eaten in a long time. I followed the recipe exactly - three of us took a bite and we immediately threw it out. What a waste!

This is actually a pretty great brownie recipe, not sure about the red velvet part, though. I was looking for things to make my kids that I could stash extra nutrition into and love the inclusion of beets and beans. My variations were: 3 eggs instead of egg sub and 1/4 c white whole wheat flour instead of 3 tbsp, skipped the almond extract but added extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla and passed on the food coloring. Also added 1/2 c of walnuts and dark chocolate chips to up the brownie/anti-oxidant factor. Delish!

This is a great recipe if you are looking to satisfy the chocolate craving but are trying to be "good." I've been trying to seriously cut back on the snacking to lose a few pounds and found this recipe. It does not substitute for a real brownie, but if you set your expectations properly, it is an excellent recipe for a satisfying dessert that is lower fat and calories, and especially considering it is made from beans, beets and agave syrup. I used 2 regular eggs and 1/4 cup milk instead of the egg substitute, worked fine. And of course skipped the food coloring, a dumb ingredient. I think this may be the same recipe Rocco is using in his truck cupcakes, billed at 70 calories (and free if you checkin with foursquare or ask nicely if you don't have an iphone), but I think the truck version is possibly using a different sweetener because the cupcake has a weird aftertaste that this cake doesn't have.

Yuk, I had to eat something else to get the taste out of my mouth. Truly a waste of ingredients and time.

Wow, this is a really different recipe. At first I became a little skeptical when my batter smelled strongly like beets and beans....but the end result is exactly as pictured, dense moist chocolate 'cake.' Unfortunately, I hadn't read the description that almond extract was 'essential' and skipped it. Also, I couldn't find canned beets, so used the vacuum packed baby beets at trader joes'. This lead to the cake still tasting slightly more like beets than desired. Regardless, the cake was still yummy and not to sweet. Will make again and this time add almond extract and perhaps dried cherries soaked in brandy to the cake.

This is actually a terrific little recipe. I was skeptical at first but followed it faithfully (except for the almond extract) and the result was wonderful: VERY moist, great flavor.
