Really great relish & quick. I did not use the cornstarch and reduced the sugar as suggested by other reviewers. I also added just a pinch of turmeric and a little dill. This is so good, that I've been getting a spoon to eat it straight out of the bowl in the refrigerator. One note on preparation: after putting the relish together, let it stand for an hour or so, uncovered at room temperature before refrigerating.

I would reduce the amount of cornstarch just a bit. Otherwise, we really liked it.

I made the relish as stated in the recipe. I was really good. We also put it on hot dogs and I have been eating it just off a spoon. I hesitated to make it because I'm not a big fan of sweet relish. Not too sweet. I might try putting a little dill weed in next time, when the cucumbers are ripe in the garden.

As soon as we received our latest issue of Gourmet we made the homemade buns and relish and made our usual incredible hamburgers...We loved this relish so much we invented things to eat it with for the next few days until it was gone. Not even close to the bottled corn syrupy stuff from the store...BETTER!!

Didn't do it for me. A bit too sweet for my tastes and the cornstarch gave it a rather odd consistency.
