I have a vegetarian step-daughter and it was a hit. I did turn the broiler on to get a good char on some of the veggies. Otherwise, follow per directions. It was really good. I would certainly make this again.

The roasted veggies really make this dish special. I didn't have eggplant, so increased the zucchini and onions and raised the temp to 500 after adding the zucchini. The toasty bits of onion added great flavor. I also tried 'caramelizing' tomato paste and liked that a lot. For a little zing I toasted red pepper flakes in a skillet, then added olive oil and 6 cloves of minced garlic, then combined all together in a saucepan with a large can of diced tomatoes and extra liquid because it was so thick. I didn't add the herbs when cooking, but stirred in finely cut fresh basil just before serving. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Just made this for dinner with added kalamata olives and red peppers. YUM! Very tasty. I'll use the leftover sauce with some spaghetti squash.

This was easy and tasty. I used fire roasted crushed tomatoes (because it's all I had) and I didn't use the thyme and rosemary.

Great flavor--I misread the recipe and added the zucchini at the beginning and it all came out fine. we really loved the flavor and found that we had more then enough juice (probably from the slightly overcooked zucchini) and didn't need the pasta water.

I use this recipe for a base for a lot of different dishes; pizza, quesadillas,lasagna etc. I also adjust the herbs by the type of dish I am making with it(basil, mushrooms,cilantro). I also add fresh tomato sauce and a little bit of tomato paste to make a nice dip with baked pita chips. This is a very easy recipe to make.

Excellent Excellent dish!! WOW! So flavourful! I added 2 packets of beef bouillon in the sauce to add more flavour and some garlic cloves. Will definately be making this again!

Not much work, with decent results. Next time I will omit the rosemary and thyme. While I usually like both, they overpowered this meal.

I liked the recipes, but changed the seasoning. I use the basil, and I add oregano and hot pepper flakes. I prefer the Italian seasonings to the rosemary and thyme. I also add some sauteed pignoil nuts.

This continues to be a favorite of mine, and is especially unique with the roasting of the vegetables. With fresh herbs it's a great dish for springtime. My friends always love this dish whenever I make it.

This wasn't bad, but I definitely won't be making it again. It is just too average to justify the effort when I have several other pasta recipies that I know everyone in my family prefers. By the way, I also didn't find that it was necessary to use any of the pasta water.

decent dish... Nothing special, but a good basic pasta, tomatoes and vegetables dish. It's not a dish for which I would bother to make fresh pasta, but I will probably make again at some point. I will definitely add black olives next time though. Note: I used 1.5 times the amount of eggplant and 16oz dried pasta. The dish was "saucey" enough and did not require any of the reserved pasta water.

This is an excellent hearty and simple-to-make entree. I threw mushrooms on top of the vegetiables at the end of the roasting time.

quite delicious--but don't skimp on the fresh rosemary, parsley, and basil. I used dried thyme and it was good. I didn't need any of the pasta water.

Excellent recipe. A little labor-intensive for a midweek dinner, but worth it. I used fresh herbs from my box and followed suggestions to add some tomato paste/sugar with the canned tomatoes. I also used a brown-rice penne to make it even more "diet-friendly." Served with the parsnip bisque recipe, also on this site. Will certainly make both again!

This was an excellent and easy to prepare dish. I was unable to obtain all the fresh herbs so substituted some dry. I also used a pound of penne instead of 12 ounces. This has a bit of a "kick" and we all loved it.

Great recipe -- worked well w/16 oz penne. (no 12-oz pkgs penne in my supermarket)

I took the reviewers suggestion of cranking up the temperature, carmelizing tomato paste and it really worked out well. I also added a pound of asparagus and one red bell pepper. Definitely a keeper.

Fantastic dish, and one I am glad to have leftovers from (even though it tasted even better freshly made). Interesting texture came from using dried thyme and rosemary...I think next time I would opt for fresh.

This recipe was fun to make--I like the whole process of roasting vegetables. However, it seemed like this sauce did not highlight the roasted-ness of the veggies. After a lot of (fun) work, it tasted like any basic spaghetti sauce. Low flavor to effort ratio.

I used the advice of reviewers and this came out so great my husband called his mother to tell her about it. I always salt my eggplant before cooking, and I recommend anyone else do the same, and the cooked tomato paste was good. I disagree with one cook who claimed there was no real roasted flavor. I stirfry or saute an eggplant dish almost every week, and I definitely could taste the difference. Cranking up the heat might overcook, so you would have to reduce the overall cooking time if you tried that.

I followed the advice of another reviewer and carmalized some tomatoe paste and it was wonderful.

The dish is certainly simple to make, inexpensive and nourishing, which accounts for why I'd make it again -- but there were a couple of problems that I'd want to solve before preparing it a second time. The total roasting time for the eggplant is probably a bit too long, but not terribly so. The biggest eggplant problem is that drizzling oil onto freshly chopped eggplant results in absorption of the oil -- and the oil-soaked parts of the eggplant cook differently (faster) than the rest, resulting in a weird final consistency. I would recommend salting the eggplant and letting it sweat out for a few minutes before adding the oil. Everything else is fine; there's hardly any "sauce" so if you want a richer consistency you might consider adding some additional tomato puree at the very end.

yummy goodness... I added lotsa roasted garlic. Whatta kiss!

I thought this was gummy, and not all that appealing. One of the few things I'll never make again.

O.k., it breaks down like this. This is a good recipe that could be a great recipe. First of all crank the heat about 100 degrees higher to actually roast the veggies. Also, next time, I'm going to caramelize 1/2 can of tomato paste in a non-stick pan and add it to the tomatoes before adding them to the roasted veggies. This'll add a terrific smoky flavor. Maybe 1/4 of can will do. Also I'd add some kalamata olives.

This was great! Easy to prepare and full of flavor! We will be adding this to our list of to make again...soon.

This was pretty tastey. Next time I'll use more eggplant and add some olives, mushrooms and tomatoes. I also roasted whole garlic cloves along with the vegetables.

This was a great recipe for a mid-summer Sunday night. We picked up fresh eggplant, zucchini, red onion, and heirloom tomatoes during the day and roasted them while we made fresh pasta (and prepared an apple crisp for dessert). The roasty flavor of the fresh vegetables blended well with the fresh herbs. Note, that with just 2 people we only made about half the recipe. Also, we roasted some fresh tomatoes with the other vegetables. An excellent summer recipe that we would definitely consider making again.

This was the first recipe I made for my husband when it was discovered that his cholesterol was, proverbially, through the roof. We both enjoy spicy food; usinga boost in the red pepper flakes, and adding white pepper, and fresh rosemary from the garden helped. Tossing the vegetables in a roasted-garlic-infused olive oil probably helped, also. Fortunately, we did not find it bland.This is a commendable left-over, improving over the next day or two.

This is basically an okay, and probably pretty heatlthful pasta with tomatos and vegetables. But it is nothing special. For all the time it took to roast the vegetables, they didn't have a distinctive roasted flavor, so roasting didn't seem to be worth the extra time (vis a vis, for example, simply sauteeing.
