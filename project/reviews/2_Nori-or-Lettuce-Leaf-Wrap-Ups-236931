As written, this doesn't taste/sound terribly appealing, thus the 2-fork review. However, I love the avocado/alfalfa sprout/cucumber combo and made the following changes the second time around: mashed an avocado with some mayo, spread it on some Boston Lettuce, layered cucumber, sprouts, carrots and some mushrooms (had some in the house, substituted for the unappealing idea of chicken, salmon or tofu). They turned out to be a pretty filling, healthy accompaniment to the detox/cabbage soup also on this site. Oh, and a dash of salt helped bring out all the flavors, especially the cucumber and avocado. My son enjoyed it, and requested it for lunch the next day, so I'd call it a win!

I used nori - but filled it with mashed steamed yams (salt, pepper, green onion mixed in), red pepper, cucumber, avocado, and japanese mayo (yes, I know - not very healthy!) and it was goooood. Unfortunately, the nori got a bit too soft, but if I wanted more crunch, I'd probably layer another piece of nori underneath. I suppose I took a "rice-free" maki approach to this recipe. I probably wouldn't mix a traditional guacamole (with lime juice, etc) with nori, and instead I incorporated other ingredients that would go with nori well.

I agree the nori with the rest of the ingredients is not a good idea. I tried it with the lettuce leafs suggestion and it was great. Plus I have a great ginger dressing recipe that wen along great with it. I agree with Geneva that you can springboard off of this recipe and have some great choices.

Wonderful, and a great springboard for adaptation! To the cook from Tokyo, as an alternative to guacamole (yes, the avacodos alone are also expensive here), consider plain yogurt (dairy or soy) with a spike of wasabi - YUM!

What a waste of quality ingredredients. Guacamole should not be next to the nori, as it makes it soggy and hard to bite/chew. I should have saved these quality ingredients for another dish. We choked down as many as we could to address hunger and avoid waste, but still ended up discarding a good portion. I live in Tokyo, where aside from nori, these ingredients are rather expensive. Thus, I am bitter for having tried this marginally edible recipe.

First bite was interesting but the wrap tasted disgusting before we finished chokeng it down. The reviewer WesternWilson from Vancouver describes it accurately.

This sounded so good but tasted just terrible. The guacamole and chicken are unhappy bedmates with the bean sprouts and nori, with the fishy notes from the nori overwhelming and unpleasant. The filling was bland and tasteless. I would suggest pairing the filling (sans beansprouts) with some zippy salsa and a whole wheat tortilla. Save the nori for a good sushi filling.
