This is a delicious stew that will warm you up in cold weather. I made some substitutions based on what I had on hand/what is or is not in season: (1) 1/2 cup of yellow moong dal from my local Indian grocery store, (2) 2-3 chopped canned plum tomatoes, (3) 1/2 pound frozen haricot vert green beans from Trader Joes, and (4) two jalepenos. The stew was flavorful but not super spicy so I may up the chili factor next time. I added the frozen green beans when called for in the recipe but I should have waited until closer to the end, as they became a bit mushy...but not so bad that they ruined the stew! Next time I might experiment with frozen okra since it's readily available. I also made my own sambar powder as described in the notes to the recipe. If you have a fair amount of Indian spices on hand or are looking to experiment with this flavor palate, I recommend this recipe.
