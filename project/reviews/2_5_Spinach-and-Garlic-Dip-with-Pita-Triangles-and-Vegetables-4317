I used greek style yogurt instead of sour cream and I really liked this for a dip.

Bland. Even with more garlic, and good amounts of salt and pepper. There's an excess of sour cream taste, and it does nothing for the spinach. Something about this recipe is a bit off; the flavours just don't marry well. It got worse, not better, over 24 hrs in the fridge.

I doubled this recipe with one bag of fresh spinach (9 oz.). I was out of green onion, so I used 1 cup sour cream and 1 cup french onion dip. It turned out fabulous! I'll use the pita triangle recipie a ton as well.

Very good and very easy. I added a Thai pepper--I like it a little hot. Umm...those of you who found it bland...you do realize that you have to add salt to taste, don't you?

The bonus to this dip: it was easy. But the bland comments were right on. I used 3/4 c sour cream, added cayenne pepper, salt, a tablespoon of mayo, garlic powder (in addition to the sauteed garlic), black pepper, and I topped it with paprika and a garnish of kale. Not bad after all that. I'll make it again, but i'll add more kick with more hot stuff.

i added twice the amount of spinach and sauteed with not only garlic but some crushed red pepper. before blending i added two raw garlic cloves and some whole black peppercorns. not the greatest dip, but i will make again

This spinache dip is VERY bland and basically tastes like sour cream with a hintof garlic. I even added extra garlic, a bit of tobasco sauce and more slat and it still tastes bland.

I do not understand why anyone thinks this dip is bland. I was relieved to find a dip that had such fresh flavor, yet was not overly-flavored like the store bought dips everyone is so used to. The only change I made was to add more garlic. I did not make the pita triangles, just used fresh cut vegetables. If you want a good, fresh non-artificial dip, this is it. This recipe has become my standard homemade dip. Works well with frozen or fresh spinach.

I thought this recipe was delicious! Before making it, I read the reviews, SO I added a few more garlic cloves, i added garlic salt to the spinach sautee and to the final product and i poured some hot sauce in the procedssor and in the end product. It is simply delicious and it hasn't even chilled yet!

Originally tried this only because I had a ton of sour cream to use up. I did take the suggestions...added salt/pepper then 1/4c.grated romano and Tbl.hot sauce.....very good!!...give it a try. It's easy and the flavors are complimentary. Everyone loved it.

As per previous reviews, yes, this dip needs help. Very bland as made according to directions. I "fixed" by adding 1/4 c. yogurt to brighten, 1 tsp. basil and 1/3 c. grated asiago cheese. Allow to "age" for about 4 hours. It was very good but really needed those extras.

I thought this dip was great ! It was very fresh tasting. The color is vibrant ! Next time, perhaps, I would use about 3/4 Cup of sour cream and 1 1/2 teaspoons of garlic. As the previous reviewer said, salt and pepper do help.

It was surprising to read reviews about the blandness of the dip. A bit of salt and pepper made this delicious. Seasoned salt on pita was also more tasty. More than two rounds of pita should be used for dip, even with assorted vegggies for dipping. Looks pretty with pita, yellow peppers and carrots.

If you like garlic, this will be a hit because it's just about all you'll taste. With some modifications (less garlic, cream cheese in lieu of some sour cream, additional seasoning) this does have potential. More suited as a vegetable dip than a dip for pita chips. I too will make the pita chips again for other dips/spreads. though

This is a good and easy dip. I have made it three times and served it with the pita chips, steamed sugar snap peas, and thinly sliced bell peppers. It looks fresh and colorful.

Very healthy, fresh and light sensation. Goes great with carrots and celery.

This is the 2nd time I've made this dip. I thought I perhaps had done something wrong the 1st time, because it turned out rather bland. So the 2nd time I added more garlic and onions and let it sit overnight. And guess what.......still bland! I'd make the pita triangles again to use with another dip, but I'm afraid the recipe section for the dip is going to be trashed.

The dip is very good, but it really needs to sit at least overnight for it to develop it's true flavor. I served it with paremsan pita crips which were a big hit too.

A pretty green color with good dose of garlic. Good response from our guests and easy to make ahead of time.

I thought the pita triangles were great but the dip was tasteless.

This was good, but I added some artichokes and it was great! Served it at a party to rave reviews.

This was a little too garlicky for me (and I like garlic), though my guests really loved it.
