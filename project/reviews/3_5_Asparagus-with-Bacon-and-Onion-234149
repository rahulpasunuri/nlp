4 forks with some modifications: Instead of an onion, I used a shallot for gentler flavor. I also put in a half teaspoon of maple syrup and a half cup of breadcrumbs to enhance the dish. It was a hit with the family.

Fantastic! Flavors blend well when you actually use the special oils...Is it the healthiest recipe? No, but it's a great way to spice up asparagus other than the typical wrapped-proscuitto route...

Not that good compared to most other asparagus recipes (and most other recipes are healthier). Edible, but not worth making again.

The lemon juice didn't seem to blend with the bacom and onion flavos, but it was still good and easy to make. I skipped the special oils.

This was easy and very tasty. I will do this again. Something different.

I think the asparagus has distictive taste on it's own. The bacon distracted from the lemon oil mix. It was definitley not something I would make again with asparagus. I would use the bacon and onion with potatos.

Easy recipe and went over great at the table--there were no leftovers. I received lots of compliments on it. I couldn't find walnut oil or hazelnut oil at my local grocery store, so I used safflower oil. Everybody loved it! Asparagus is 2 of my dinner guests favorite vegetable and this recipe earned 2 thumbs up from my aspargus experts!

I love this asparagus recipe. I find most recipes for aspargus to be quite similar and boring -- this one certainly made a dish to remember. This dish made some asparagus-skeptics converts!

Like the cook from Aurora, IL, we used olive oil because we didn't have the recommended oils on hand. This recipe is certainly a tasty alternative to simple buttered, steamed asparagus.

We made this dish for just my husband and myself because we had a ton of aspargus. We served it with lamb chops. It was absolutely delicious! We used olive oil because we did not have the other oils available. We also cooked the onion until it was starting to get an almost charred look to it. We really enjoyed it and will definately make again
