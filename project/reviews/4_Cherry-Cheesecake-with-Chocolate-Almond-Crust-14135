Great recipe overall. Had no almonds so used all cookies in the crust, however should've used less sugar to compensate. Its somewhat strange to make the cherry topping before the cake itself, just to extract some juice from it to add to the filling, so I made the filling without the juice, and made the cherry topping the next day after the cake cooled. Also important - cake will be extra, extra wobbly - but don't worry, it firms up even if it seems like it won't.

I made this cheesecake for my friend's birthday party. It was a huge success. I made an oreo almond crust instead of using chocolate wafers. We had gone cherry picking the day before so the cherries were extremely fresh. I pureed the cherry topping to get a smoother jammy consistency. One of the best cheesecake recipes I've tried.

The overall cheesecake recipe, as far as flavor, texture, and consistency, had a great outcome in my Culinary Arts II baking group. However, we made some changes as follows: Concerning the chocolate-almond crust, the ingredients and techniques remained the same with the exception of the 1/4 tsp of salt-we simply took it out. The cheese filling was performed in the same manner as the original recipe; it was all perfectly organized and tasted great. The drastic changes came with the cherry topping-- it became a layer in the middle of the cake. First, the ingredient list for the cherry topping altered with the exchange of fresh cherries to 2 15oz cans of Del Monte Dark Sweet Cherries in Heavy Syrup. We left out the lemon juice when boiling the cherries to reduce tartness. Second, we cooled the sugar and cherry mixture, then strained all excess juice into a bowl and set aside. After the juice was removed, we "smushed" the cherries to remove any juice left. Then we pureed the fruit into a smooth jelly. After baking the crust as by the original recipe, then pouring half of the filling on top, we replaced the cheesecake into the oven for 20-25 minutes in order to bake the first half completely through. Once done, we spread the newly-made cherry jelly evenly in a layer over the bottom half of the cheesecake. We then poured the remaining cake batter directly onto the spread jelly and continued baking for another 25 minutes. The results were fantastic. Because of the dark color of the cherries, it made a beautiful purple stripe between the two creamy cheesecake layers. Another differientiating factor came from the decorating.The leftover juice set aside earlier was made into a paste by adding a packet of gelatin to the bowl. After thickening, we spread the gel along the sides of the cheesecake. Once sliced onto individual plates, we drizzled a chocolate syrup and placed a red cherry on top to complete the look. This received great reviews from the consumers.

Loved it! Made it for a summer garden party and it was a hit! My mother who never eats sweets or cakes ate two HUGE pieces as this cheesecake has a perfect texture and a beautiful delicate sweetness. Will certainly make again.

This was a very good, easy cheesecake and a hit at my holiday party. The tart cherries I had frozen from the summer were perfect though I used less of their liquid in the final topping and boosted their color back with a skoach of food color-ick but they needed it! The flavor over all was perfect and irresistable and the contrast of the light pink cake with the chocolate crust was very pretty. (I did forget and add the almond extract to the topping before it was heated but it was fine.)If you don't like chocolate I think this would be great with a shortbread crust.

I am not sure what the cook from Oregon is talking about. I still think about this recipe and recommend it frequently. I often don't eat the desserts I make, but this one, this one I hate half the cake -- it was irresistible! So delicious. Followed the recipe exactly.

I have my made this cheesecake every summer for years. The cherry and almond combo is so perfectly matched. It is alway a hit at my summer parties (especially when I go to the local farm and pick the cherries fresh). It is a tried and true recipe that I have given out many times.

This cheesecake pops off the plate after you add SALT!!!! Why are people so afraid of salt? It always brings out the flavor in dairy desserts, the addition of one tsp Kosher salt or 1/2 tsp table salt will fix the flavor completely. No problem. Totally yummy. Cheers.

I tried this recipe because it received so many good reviews. Perhaps I am a cheesecake snob, but this recipe isn't worth making again. I have tried about 20 different recipes over the past 3 years and this cake is nothing special. It is almost as if it doesn't hit all of the taste buds in a person's mouth and there is no tasty after flavor. It is not a bad cheesecake, but taste similiar to what you would find in a mid-grade restaurent. It is very "common" in my book and you could do better. The Lemon Cheesecake with the Shortbread Cookie Crust recipe from this website is much better.

I made this for a big gathering and now everyone is waiting for the next one! Made it to the letter. Heaven!

This dessert was just right. Not too heavy not too light. Delicate but flavoursome. I used a light chocolate sauce over the cheesecake and that went down well with everyone.

A very good cheesecake. I thought it was just right -- not too dense or heavy, but full of flavor. The crust was especially good, and it was much easier to work with than other graham cracker crusts I have made -- no cracks or falling off the sides. Unfortunately, there were no fresh tart cherries to be found anywhere, so I tried using canned. It worked OK, but not great. I think the topping would be great with fresh cherries, but if canned is the only possibility, I think next time I'd just buy the light cherry topping and use that. The other thing was that mine should've baked a little longer, perhaps 5 - 10 more minutes, as it was a little runny inside. (Maybe due to the extra water in my canned cherries?) Overall, it was delicious! Definitely one I'd make again.

Not a cherry to be found in winter, so I opted to make this with canned cherry pie filling. I didn't have any cherry juice for the cheesecake itself so the cake turned out beautiful white, with a lovely cherry topping. Friends raved!!!! Easiest cake I've ever made at altitude!

This is not too subtle, but very good. A little goes a long way. The cheesecake was a pretty light pink color, and the crust and topping were wonderful. I made it for a hoilday party and it got rave reviews. Good served with lots of whipped cream.

This was the easiest baked cheesecake I have ever made and the most delicious. So creamy and not to sweet. My family wents nuts. Speaking of which - I sprinkled a handful on the bottom over the crust. Purrrrfect served with a gourmet coffee (like amaretto). Definately a new family favorite and on my Christmas dinner menu.

A good alternative to canned cherry topping, and a nice way to use fresh cherries in season. When I make again, I think I will use fewer almonds and more chocolate cookies in the crust to suit my preference.

The receipe was great for a new years celebration, but this novice was thrown by the last paragraph which must be part of a different recipe.
