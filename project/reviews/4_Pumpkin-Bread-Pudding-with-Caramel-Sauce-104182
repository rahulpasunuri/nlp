This recipe is fabulous. We make it every year for either Thanksgiving or Christmas. It has now become a family tradition. It can be made ahead of time or the day before and I usually double the recipe for a 13"x9" casserole dish

Have been making this recipe since it came out in 2000. It is our go to pumpkin dessert for Thanksgiving...as well as for our fall & winter dinners with friends. Even did this for our dinner group to rave reviews. The only think I changed is that I serve it w/Bourbon Sauce instead of the Caramel Sauce. Oh So Yummy! You need to try it. Plus, it is quick and so easy to make. Enjoy.

Outstanding recipe! Made it for Thanksgiving and will make it again for our Xmas dinner party. Caramel sauce is killer!

I made this as written, even weighing out 10 ounces of bread to be precise. We enjoyed the flavours, but the texture was disappointingly mushy. With almost 4 cups of liquid, two eggs are not enough. I will be trying this again, but next time using 4 eggs which is in keeping with the standard ratio for custards of minimum 1 egg per cup of liquid. The sauce is very good, but needs a pinch of salt (or salted butter) to come alive. I recently made a repeat batch to pour over poached pears. (I admit, the pears were just a vehicle for the sauce!)

I used the amount of bread called for in the recipe, and it seemed fine to me, maybe because it was good quality challah that was light and fluffy. I did increase the pumpkin but only by a little bit. The best thing about this recipe is how EASY it is. A nice change from the traditional pumpkin pie, but so much quicker to make than a pumping cheesecake. I made it in a round springform pan and cut down on the cooking time to keep it from getting dry. The sauce is key.

Simple to make; a real hit with my family, including my grandchildren, recently. It makes 6 generous servings.

This recipe is sooooooooo delicious and easy! The only tweaking I might do is to find a way to top with salted pecans for a perfect flavor balance. This is the bomb....I actually used a lower end commercial loaf of bread and the dessert was absolutely scrumptious...don't sweat the bread if you don't have egg bread. My daughter doesn't like raisins so I skipped those and didn't miss 'em. Enjoy!

Delicious, and quick and easy to make= Winner! It is important to use only 10oz of challah (or egg) bread and not more else the pudding wont be gooey enough. i used a pound of challah, which i cut into 1/2" cubes. i didnt bother to measure the number of cups. i kept all other elements of the pudding as per the recipe. while it wasnt as gooey as it should be (because i used a pound of bread), it was still SUPER delicious. i will definitely be making it in the future but with the right proportion of bread, and using a combination of whole milk and whipping cream. the half and half doesn't taste too heavy, but isnt the healthiest ingredient.... especially if you plan to indulge every day! the caramel sauce is a must for the recipe. it rounds out the "pumpkin pie" flavor. what i changed about the sauce: added some sea salt + vanilla extract.

I made this for Thanksgiving yesterday on a whim. My FIL loves my bread pudding and thought I would surprise him with this. It was EXCEPTIONAL!!! SO good!!! I used a 29 ounce can of pumpkin, and heavy whipping cream since I ran out of half and half.. I also didn't have the golden raisins and used regular raisins. YOU MUST make the Carmel sauce it definitely makes it even better (for adults only I would add rum or whiskey to the sauce for a little extra kick) Definitely a keeper!

This is a GREAT recipe!! Instead of the egg bread, I used cinnamon raisin bread, then just omitted the raisins. I also baked it in a 9x13 because I didn't have the pan the recipe it called for. Everyone LOVED it and I'm eating leftovers right now! This is a definite for Thanksgiving and Christmas!

This was a nice change from the usual Thanksgiving pumpkin pie, but I did make a couple of changes. I used a good quality Tuscan loaf and based on previous reviews, I cut the sugar back to half a cup. I was pretty sure the caramel sauce would add enough sweetness to the pudding and it definitely did! I also substituted cranberries for the golden raisins and they looked very pretty and gave it a nice bit of tartness.

I made a few changes to accommodate the ingredients I had on hand - I doubled the recipe and used about 1 cup whole milk and the rest 2% milk, and I made my own "pumpkin pie spice". I also dried the challah bread cubes in the oven for about 5 minutes (at 300 degrees) before soaking them in the pumpkin mixture, and lightly buttered the casserole dish before pouring the pudding into it. I made this the night before Thanksgiving, and then reheated the whole casserole covered with foil in a warm oven (and made the caramel sauce while the pudding was warming) after dinner. I'll be honest - I wasn't too pleased with it. I thought it was too pumpkin-y and didn't really like the texture. HOWEVER - the leftovers we've eaten since Thanksgiving are fantastic! It really does get better and better each day that it sits in the fridge - we're two days past Thanksgiving and I can't stop eating it (lots of leftovers). The caramel sauce keeps well in an airtight container as well. Delicious - but if I were to make this again I'd make it a few days in advance and reheat the night of the dinner.

I made this with a couple of changes. Instead of the spices they used, i used one teaspoon each of the following: All Spice, Cinnamon, Ginger and Ground Cloves (I use Penzy's).

Easy recipe, and so good! I added vanilla extract and a dash of salt to the caramel sauce, and added fresh ginger and allspice to the bread pudding. Also substituted toasted pecans for the raisins. Added a 1/4 t. salt to the bread pudding as well--even sweet things need a bit of salt to pump up the flavor. I plan to use this caramel sauce recipe for any other dessert that needs a little something extra. It is SO good. Hard to believe it's this easy.

Cook from France, I used about 2 cups fresh pumpkin. It's important to use the small pie pumpkins. I prepared by slicing into quarters, removing the seeds & stringy bits, microwaved in a covered dish with a little water for about 25 minutes then pureed.

mmmmm so delicious and easy! The sauce really makes the dish. I doubled all the spices (used ginger, nutmeg, and cinnamon instead of the pumpkin pie spice). The recipe makes a lot of caramel so we put pistacio ice cream on the side and drizzled the sauce on top. I used this for two dinners and both groups raved!! Make this now!!

Easy, fast, delicious: rare to find all three in a dessert recipe! I didn't have half and half, so I used 1.5C heavy cream and 0.5C water. Was very moist and took about 15 minutes longer to cook. Also subbed valhrona chocolate chunks instead of raisins and added 1/2 teaspoon salt to the caramel sauce to make a salted caramel sauce. Delicious! The caramel sauce recipe yields too much; next time I will half the sauce recipe.

So very very very yummy. I of course changed the recipe completly too. I used coconut milk with some extra low fat lactaid milk (lactose intolarant I am), and I had some really chewy sourdough rolls that i cut up for the bread, and craisons. The best part was the caramal sauce. I wanted to drink it, it went well with the pudding which was not very sweet. I will make this again

I thought it was good but not a favorite of mine. However one of my guests requested to take some of it home. So I gave him a huge piece. He was very happy. I didn't make the caramel sauce I made dulce de leche instead. I'll make this again.

Absolutely amazing! Don't skip the caramel sauce, it's really easy and adds the perfect velvety finish. In fact, it would be a little dry without it. I substituted light brown sugar with no problem. Any bread should work (I used leftover soft dinner rolls). This is a new family favorite.

despite having to find a close substitute for almost all of the ingredients, this was insanely good! without any canned pumpkin to be found on the island the day before thanksgiving, i used whole fresh pumpkin (microwaved + pureed in the blender) ... no half & half at the store, so I used long-shelf-life whole milk ... couldn't find pumpkin pie spice, but used equal parts of local ginger and clove ... the only bread available was white sandwich bread ... and they were out of golden raisins, so I used regular raisins soaked in a little amaretto instead ... and my guests are still raving! it was totally worth the effort of the fresh pumpkin and i'll definitely make this again ... perhaps with some nutmeg for even more local flavor :)

This recipe was delicious and a huge hit with my guests. I will definitely be making it again. I used Challah, adding an extra splash of milk. Also, I didn't have pumpkin pie spice but ended up just adding a bit of ginger and clove. And instead of the recommended caramel sauce, I served this with bourbon sauce... mmmmmm. Bourbon Sauce: Melt 1/2 stick unsalted butter in top of double boiler set over simmering water. Add 3 tablespoons bourbon, 1/4 cup sugar and 1 egg yolk. Whisk until mixture thickens slightly and candy thermometer registers 160°F, about 1 minute. Remove from heat.

I often come to Epicurious to figure out what to cook, based on what I have on hand. In this case, I had 4 egg whites I needed to use up, along with some commercial egg nog (gingerbread flavored). Since I knew I was experimenting, I had already lowered my expectations, but it actually worked! I did have to reduce the sugar in the custard mixture to accommodate for the extra sweetness in the egg nog. And, as others, I played around with the seasoning a bit. Didn't add raisins (again, I was experimenting) and was fine without them. Now for the truly decadent part - after reading another reviewer's suggestion to shape these into columns for individual ramekins, I thought, why not shape into slices for a truly decadent FRENCH TOAST? No need to dip "bread" into eggs, since they're already in there. Just saute in butter over medium heat, add maple syrup and voila! Best French toast I've ever had! ******* Will make my version again and also try recipe per its original ingredients list, but this is a keeper because it's easy to tweak.

This recipe was highly recommended by some family members so made it for them. I was disappointed but my family members loved it. The texture was very dense and gummy. It was too sweet for me.

This was a big hit tonight at our Thanksgiving dinner (Canadian Thanksgiving). I used Challah bread, added 2/3 cup of plumped regular raisins instead of golden raisins, and I added an extra 1/4 cup milk (Challah absorbs more liquid than other breads - it would have been way too dry if I had just used the cream). I also drizzled 1/4 cup[ milk over the top before leaving it to set). We prefer a less dense bread pudding, so it turned out perfectly. My husband called it "exceptional"...

Considering how low-effort this recipe is, the results are astounding. I made a double batch for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. Changes I made: -- Used a soft Italian loaf instead of egg bread (grocery store was out of Challah) -- Instead of pumpkin pie spice, used allspice, cinnamon, and fresh ginger. I'll probably use even more ginger next time, it's what adds the secret "gourmet" flavor. -- I went a little light on the brown sugar in the pudding, and the guests praised that it wasn't oversweet. That's especially true if you're using the caramel sauce to add sweetness.

This recipe is not only delicious and decadent (thanks to the caramel sauce) but also one of the easiest desserts I've ever made. I used a stale white baguette (crust included) and I also lightened it up by using 5% cream in the pudding and 18% cream in the sauce. It turned out great; very rich tasting. I highly recommend.

This was a huge hit both at Thanksgiving and our annual Christmas party. Be forewarned...everyone will ask you for the recipe ! Used Brioche from Trader Joe's instead of Challah, swapped chopped bittersweet chocolate for the raisins, and opted for ginger, cinnamon, and vanilla instead of pumpkin pie spice. A little goes a long way here...especially with the caramel sauce and whipped cream. Seems like it served more like 12 than six. A true winner.

As usual, I made changes to the recipe that I quite liked: I subbed leftover cooked kabocha squash for pumpkin, subbed 1 cup of fresh whole cranberries drizzled with about 3 tbsp honey for sultanas, and added about 1/4 cup almonds (though pepitas or maybe pistachios would have been ideal) Instead of pumpkin pie spice I used 3/4 tsp of allspice and 1/4 tsp of mace.

I really liked this recipe. I'm already a bread pudding fan, and I was craving something pumpkin for fall, and this was great, and really easy to do. I didn't make the sauce, because I didn't have the ingredients on hand. I thought it was good without the sauce, because I don't like anything that's too sweet. The down side is that it only tastes good warm out of the oven, so I didn't bring it with me to the party I was going to, which was my original intention.

Just served this at a thanksgiving pot-luck. "This is really good" from a few people :) I'm not an expert cook, so I'll share what I did. I followed the recipe to a T, except I added twice the pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon as recommended by other reviewers. I found some pre-made challah bread at the store. I ended up using one with raisins and one without. I didn't find a good guide on making the bread cubes, so I took the bread fresh and start cutting it into "cubes" as best I could, crust included. I let the bread sit out for a few hours before I mixed it up. I tried folding the bread cubes in the non-raisin one, but I was worried about the bread not being evenly distributed. So I poured the mix on top of the bread cubes on the second one, and worked the pudding around so it filled in around the edges. I stored it overnight in the fridge covered. Cooked it in the morning. The caramel sauce is a definite must, and made it exactly as said (yummy!). Vanilla Ice Cream goes great with this as well. Ended up cooking for about 1hr-1hr15min, and don't forget to give some time to cool! Awesome recipe!

Everyone raved about this pudding. It may not be the most sublime dessert I have ever had, but it was certainly wonderful. And to find such a good dish that is so easy and fool proof is priceless. I don't think you can very easily mess this up. I used too much bread and too much pumpkin, it looked a bit dry, so I poured a little more cream over it after I put it in the dish (which was bigger than called for) and it still came out perfect. And the sauce is wonderful with it.

I made this a few years ago for a Thanksgiving potluck and it was a huge hit with everyone. I had to send the recipe out to about 10 people the next day! Incredibly easy, foolproof recipe. I skipped the raisins b/c I'm not a fan and it still turned out great. Serve the caramel sauce on the side.

I have made this recipe for the past five years, pretty much as written. I add cranberries as well as raisins. You can make these a day ahead or early morning. When cool, use a small, round cookie cutter to cut out a round shape. Set these on cookie sheets. To serve, pop into warm oven. Then plate first caramel sauce on the bottom, top with bread pudding cylinder. I serve with a small scoop of salted caramel ice cream and a second of ginger ice cream (bi-rite creamery for you locals). Looks fab, gets raves, only have to do caramel sauce before serving, can serve dozens.

I have tried this at a restaurant here and absolutely loved it. So was quite pleased to find a recipe for it. This is comfort food at the highest level. I made a brioche bread with my bread machine butter/egg bread. At the restaurant here that I tried this recipe at they crumb the bread so the dessert has a cake/custard texture. I've made this recipe both ways I think I prefer the crumb over the cubes. The caramel sauce is really good a little goes a long way though.

This is an amazing recipe for bread pudding, but like other reviewers, I wasn't crazy about the caramel sauce. So the next time I made it, I opted for the pecan bourbon caramel sauce (on this website), and I made some whipped cream, and everyone absolutely loved it. Myself included!

Rating: 4
Pumpking pie is obsolete! This is the most amazing bread pudding ever and about a million times better than pumpkin pie. I've made it twice and found the key is not to use too much bread so it stays nice and custardy. The unbaked mixture should be really, really wet. Being a caramel purist, I initially disliked the brown sugar faux "caramel" sauce but when I made a real, carmelized sugar carmel sauce I found it didn't compliment the flavors as well so I guess it's back to the recipe as written!

Made last night for a dinner party. I made challah bread the day before (receipe from epicurious website) since this bread was rather dense, I would only add 8 cups of bread cubes to allow a more custard type filling. Great carmel sauce--easy but a bit on the thin side. I also served a apple cherry galette from this site and used the carmel sauce over this dessert as well.

Rating: 3
I made this pretty well as written except for uping the spices as a lot of folks recommended. It was fairly good and rich, but not an "oh wow" that I expected. The caramel sauce wasn't as good as others I made where I carmelized the sugar, but it was quick. Some folks left half of theirs. I used butter crosants like I used in my other bread puddings. Maybe they don't work here. We have enjoyed the maple bread pudding and the appricot bread pudding from this site much more. I'll go back to the Marbled Pumpkin Cheese cake from this site that does recieve an "oh wow" even though it is much more time consuming to make.

Holy Moley this was F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S! Really a dessert beyond compare; I wouldn't change a thing. Rich, comforting and delicious. You must try this recipe. I used challah bread. Brioche would work, too. Yummy, yummy, yummy.

So my family has actually asked that i never make this again because it was so good that we ate way too much of it! I doubled the pumpkin in the custard and added just a touch more half and half to keep the consistency. It gave it a more pumpkiny taste. Just sinful.

This was absoulutely great! I used the Hawaiin sweet bread rolls and it was perfect. Also, it was fine zapped in the microwave the day or two after Thanksgiving. Better than a plain ole'pumpkim pie, yes it was!

OUTSTANDING! Everyone who ate Thanksgiving dinner at my house enjoyed this bread pudding in place of pumpkin pie and loved it! I'm not sure how anyone can get "bland" out of this dish. We used challa my step-mom made in advanced and omitted the raisins (we are not a raisin-loving bunch), baked the pudding in a water bath in ramekins, and the result was a smooth, decadent bread pudding. No sogginess, no gumminess, just perfect, autumnal bread pudding. We served the pudding with the caramel sauce (heavenly) and a dollop of fresh whipped cream. I just finished mine and wish I had another!

OMG!! This recipe was so great!! I made it for a dinner party recently and it impressed all my friends when I served it on dessert plates with powdered sugar, the caramel sauce, and fresh whipped cream on top. This will become a staple in my kitchen from now on. **note: I had to add a tad more liquid, but this could be owing to the fact that my bread was old. Use fresh egg bread!

I made this recipe for a dinner party a couple of weeks ago and it was a huge hit. Everyone who attended requested the recipe. I used dried cranberries instead of raisins and I didn't use the caramel sauce. I instead used a cream anglaise (sp?), which of course was less sweet. Next time I'll make it using the caramel sauce to see how it compares. Yum.

Rating: 4
OMG!!!! This is tremendous, truly for a bread pudding this is outstanding: Moist, flavorful, sweet, but not too sweet. I used fat free half n' half and brown, organic eggs. Still divine. Also, used Hawaiian bread, yum. One change though, I used a traditional Bourbon sauce and that sent it over the top.... it amped the flavor up to another level. This is a keeper.

Absolutely wonderful and a BIG hit at our Halloween party this year! Everyone wanted the recipe and two people who are self-proclaimed bread pudding haters loved it. I used 1/2 2% milk and 1/2 half & half for the pudding but you must use 100% whipping cream for the caramel sauce. Very easy to make.

I make this time and time again and it is always a huge hit. It's also super easy. I use cheap, grocery store brown-and-serve rolls (white bread or hawaiian bread) since they have no crust to speak of and one package is the perfect amount of bread for this recipe. I adore bread pudding and this is one of the best recipes I've found.

Rating: 4
I make this dish at least once a month during the winter months. It is absolutely unbelievable, and every person that has tried it asks for the recipe. Here are a few simple keys for making this dish exraordinary instead of just really good. First, use very fresh bread and keep it as light and air filled as possible when cubing it (I often tear it gently with my hands). Second, use real butter and full-fat heavy whipping cream for the caramel sauce. Once you try this, you may never settle for regular bread pudding again.

Delicious. As suggested by other reviewers, I added slightly more pumpkin pie spice and left out the raisins, and also used croissants since I couldn't find eggbread. And I served with unsweetened whipped cream to balance the VERY sweet caramel sauce. Agree with previous reviewer that it serves more than 6. We probably got 12 servings out of it.

Very, very disappointing, especially when I couldn't find a "egg bread" and made my own brioche. I should have made a denser challah. This turned into a dense, mediocre, unimpressive dessert for Christmas day. Won't try again, even with Challah. Too many other good desserts out there.

Rating: 4
Wow. Made this exactly as directed except increased the pumpkin pie spice and the cooking time (I like a very firm bread pudding, less custard texture and more bread texture). I love desserts like this because they are so easy to make, and so good. Divine by itself but the caramel sauce (also very easy, and fast to make) turns this dessert into one to die for. This is a very sweet, heavy and rich dessert but it is worth every single bite. I will be making this many, many more times in the future.

I made this recipe over Thanksgiving weekend substituting dried cranberries for the golden raisons. I also pour a couple of tablespoons of melted butter over the top before baking.

I made it again for a Christmas gathering of my colleagues at work. All loved it and wanted the recipe.

Great and easy recipe. I was impressed at how easy the sauce was! I skipped the raisins and toasted pecans to sprinkle on top of each serving - yum! Also, used only half the amount of half & half and used skim milk for the rest. Added more nutmeg and cinnamon than the recipe calls for. I've been making bread puddings with my grandmother since I was 8 and this is by far one of the easiest and tastiest recipes. If you're not a confident cook yet, this recipe is a breeze. I'll be making it for the day after Thanksgiving.

Office Thanksgiving lunch: UBS gang says DELICIOUS & I got 3 OMG's! Cubed Kings Hawaiian buns night before. Put in warm oven 15 min to dry. Used 1/2 light br. sugar. I never made sauce before- it is literally a snap! Maybe some who complained pudding being too sweet used pie-filling instead of pure pumpkin? Non-Raisin folks like raisins I found out. (Don't tell them 1st) All said sauce made it. I may have baked it too long as I wasn't sure if it was done. Can knife come out ALMOST clean and be done? A keeper!

Holy yumyum, this is the first time I'm using the power of the 4 forks. My husband--who's quite picky--and I LOVED this dessert and ate it every night till it was gone. The sauce IS quick & easy and good for all kinds of uses, the best caramel i've ever made. We loved it w/ a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It's a great way to use your own roasted squash (carnival, acorn, butternut etc) and get those vitamins in there. We didn't have any hallah or egg bread in the store, so I used a whole (16 oz) loaf of king's hawaiian bread, perfect.

Rating: 4
This dessert is amazing! The first time I made it, I made it as written. Sinfully delicious, but not super healthy. The second time I made it, I dried out my bread cubes 1 day in advance, used whole milk in place of half and half, and assembled the bread pudding and refrigerated (covered) for 8-10 hours prior to baking. It was just as good as the first time I made it, but it was lower in fat and I was able to pre-make the dessert.

I have made this recipe three times now for dinner guests, and each time it has received high praise. I did make a few adjustments the last time.

This was a wonderful change to plain ole pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving. The caramel sauce was great and we used the leftovers for ice cream.

This dish made all my guests gasp with pleasure. Even one who told me she didn't like pumpkin OR bread pudding asked for the recipe. Granted, I'm a sweet-freak, so take my opinion should perhaps be taken with a grain of - sugar? I too lessened the amount of bread, and challah worked perfectly for me. I added extra spice -- abundant cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger instead of pie spice. Serving the dish and sauce piping hot with the cold homemade whipped cream was the way to go.

This sounded like a perfect Thanksgiving recipe, but... I am very glad I gave it a test run because I won't be making it for Turkey Day. It was overly heavy and sort of sickeningly sweet. I'm not against rich desserts, but I felt it wasn't a good balance of flavors. I almost want to try it again with different bread (I used challah) and other ingredients because it got so many other good reviews and it does sound like a good concept. Maybe I'll cut down on the richness of the other ingredients, too. Any other modification suggestions?

This was delicious! Made it for company and everyone loved it. I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out great. The whipped cream is essential-- the caramel sauce is indeed very sweet, but the whipped cream helps tone it down and it makes a great combination. I think I'll make it again for Thanksgiving.

WOW! Indescribable combination of decadence and comfort food rolled into one! Simple to make and is a great recipe to try out variations in breads.

This is so good that it's ridiculous. It is also incredibly quick and easy to make. I was skeptical about the caramel sauce (afraid it may be too much), but I must say that it really makes the dessert complete. A perfect fall dessert that will have your guests thinking you slaved for hours!

I know everyone can't stand those who alter recipes, but my father is diabetic, so I had to alter this a bit. Still not low fat, but lower... I used 1 cup of 2% milk and 1 cup of skim milk.

I prepared it the day before and baked it the next day, b/c I was making this for 16 people. It turned out great b/c all of the flavors blended into the bread, and the pudding was compressed.

This recipe was the absolute hit of my autumnal dinner party. I made a few slight modifications, however. I left out the raisins (my husband hates them!) Also, in lieu of cubed egg bread, I used day old croissants sliced in half (about 6 whole). I placed the bottom halves of the croissants in a 9 x 13 glass pan, then poured in approxiamtely 1/3 of the custard over the slices. I then placed the top halves of the croissants on the bottom halves, and filled in any gaps with pieces of additional croissant. I then poured in the reamining 2/3 of the custard. I let this soak for 15 minutes, and pressed down on the croissants to flatten them slightly and absorb the custard. I baked this per the recipe directions. The result was phenomenal - the buttery layers of the croissants make this a light yet pleasantly rich dessert. I highly recommend serving this with the caramel sauce and fresh whipped cream - it truly was a delectable combination. Try this recipe - you will not be disappointed.

Wow! I live in Chicago, but have never been to Wildfire . . . this dessert is fabulous! I was a little skeptical about the carmel sauce, since I'm used to making carmel with only sugar in a dry pan, but this carmel tasted really good. For the bread pudding, I used parker house rolls and toasted them in the oven before beginning. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so I used my morter and pestal to grind some clove, nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice together. It worked. I'm planning to make this again for Thanksgiving at my in-laws house.

I tried this recipe the other day, a trial run, and boy did the run back for more! I shared some with a friend and he told me he couldn't concentrate on what I was saying as he was WAY OUT THERE, enjoying this dessert! I made this with Challah and all in the Kitchen Aid mixer, so easy, all in one bowl. The caramel sauce is divine and the top was crispy, YUM. Unbelievable. Don't miss out (if you are bread pudding fan). AUGH!

This has gotten raves from everyone I've served it to, and it's very easy (but baking time was way off, I baked it over an hour); it was SO GOOD my husband actually banned me from making it again until Thanksgiving. I used cinnamon-raisin bread rather than bread and raisins. Also, I used the orange caramel sauce recipe on Epicurious, though you could just add a bit of orange extract or liqueur to this caramel recipe too.

I thought this was just okay, not great. I cut the brown sugar to 1 c, and it was still too sweet. I didn't find it too heavy (at least, for bread pudding) as some reviewers did--I wonder if that's a consequence of using fresh bread. Although this recipe doesn't mention it, most bread pudding recipes call for slightly stale bread, which is less likely to get waterlogged by the custard. If you only have fresh bread, you can dry it out in a 250 degree oven for 15 minutes or so.

I used milk instead of cream, and a light lemon sauce rather than the caramel ..... I've made it the past two Thanksgivings, and it was a big hit both times, so I'm planning it for this year, too.

I've made this twice, and only made it again because my guests requested it again. I think it's just okay. This time, I added chocolate chips instead of raisins, which I thought made it taste better. My guests were not as pleased with this substitution though! Overall, this dessert is nothing special, but it is easy to make, and it's a nice end to a fall meal.

This was Deeeeeeelicious! I made it with a cup of whole milk and one cup heavy cream. Used my own blend of spices (ginger, cinammon, cloves, allspice and nutmeg) and it was a hit. The carmel sauce was incredible - served with vanilla ice-cream - and also used Challah bread. Got rave reviews!

Rating: 2
I have to say that I was very dissappointed with this recipe. The custard was way too thick for a bread pudding and the "caramel" sauce tasted like what it was, brown sugar dissolved in butter with a little cream. I should have gone with my insticts, but the previous reviewers were quite convincing. It depends what you are looking for in your bread pudding. If you just care about a sugary dessert, you cannot go wrong with pumpkin and sugar. But if you also want texture, balance of flavors,and a overall good dessert, I suggest you look somewhere else.

Rating: 4
Terrific recipe for bread pudding and pumpkin lovers alike. The only thing I would change is the sugar. Overall it was a bit too sweet, especially when served with the caramel sauce. Even my boyfriend, who adores anything with sugar, thought it would have been better to cut back on the sugar.

This has to be one of my favorite holiday desserts! I've been making this since it published in Nov 2000. Absolutely one of my faves! Very easy, and tastes like it took hours slaving in the kitchen. I made a double recipe for Thanksgiving a couple years ago, and with all the other desserts there, it was gone! I always use the "Texas Toast" bread found in any market. I find that it's thick, easy to use, and it holds up wonderfully. The caramel sauce is simply awesome, and the leftover sauce is great on ice cream or for whatever you can think of putting caramel on.

The caramel sauce for this was fantastic and overall the bread pudding was very popular. My roommate did not know what "fold" meant and stirred the bread cubes into crumbs, which meant it took longer to bake, but still tasted great. I substituted cranberries for raisins and skim milk for half the cream.

Question for those who have made this: what's the best way to prepare it if you are going to bring it to someone's house for dessert? Bake it off beforehand and reheat for dessert? Or, assemble and then bake there? any advice would be appreciated, I'd love to bring this for Thanksgiving!

Rating: 2
I was disappointed. I found it really heavy and blah. I'm not sure why I made it in the first place now; bread sodden with 1/2&1/2 and pumpkin was sort of depressing and seemed like the food of impoverished colonial settlers. We've come a long way. But the caramel sauce was very good and delightfully simple. Also, I think it makes 10 servings instead of 6--unless you had salad for dinner.

I made this dessert for my mother's birthday and she loves bread pudding. She said it was perfect and I would have to agree. It's a really easy recipe. I ended up using french bread which was good but I'd like to try it without the crust and experiment with different breads. The caramel sauce was really easy to make and added a lot to the dessert. serve with ice cream and fresh whipped cream and you'll have any bread pudding lovers smiling!

Great bread pudding! I used whole milk instead of 1/2 & 1/2 and it was plenty rich. I made a recipe and a 1/2 and put in an 9 x 13 dish. Perfect! The carmel sauce is very easy. We served with vanilla ice cream.

I don't want to be that person that rates the recipe after they have made a million changes. That being said, I have made this according to the recipe and it rivaled any bread pudding I have gotten in restaurants. But I wanted to make it again and didn't have all the ingredients so I used what I had in the house. I used skim milk, 1/8 tsp each of cloves and nutmeg(a little less nutmeg),a loaf of french bread with most of the crust removed, and I dotted a bit of butter on the top. With all of these changes, some of which drastically reduced the fat content, my boyfriend still swooned! Delish! So experiment with what you have!

My husband loved this, but I thought it needed some tweaking. I was using up ingredients I had lying around, and creating this a bit to my own taste, so I made a few modifications. Used challah and buttermilk, leftover freshly ground cinnamon and a little nutmeg. I used dark raisins and candied lemon and orange peel soaked for an hour or so in dark rum. The texture was mostly good, but I thought it was a bit dry, and it didn't puff up like usual bread pudding, but I figure that's the pumpkin holding the custrad down. I didn't make the caramel sauce to go with this, just served with whipped cream, but I think the caramel sauce would take care of the dry aspect. Very good overall, and I'm definitely going to make it again sometime.

Phenomenal. We used dried cranberries instead of raisins, which added lots of flavor and a little tartness. We got nine healthy servings out of this dessert. Absolutely delicious with whipped cream and caramel sauce. Yummm!

My family adores this recipe. I first offered to make it for my sister's birthday last year and she really thought it sounded disgusting so we did a different recipe(which was so-so).

IT'S THAT GOOD!

Fabulous and SOOOoo easy! Took it to a block party and it was devoured. I even forgot about it in the oven for two hours and it was still GREAT!! I soaked it overnight to save time on party day. I think it made it even better. Everyone loved the caramel sauce but I thought it was way TOO sweet. I also served whipped mascarpone cream sweetened with vanilla and powdered sugar. I thought this was a better accompaniment.

I assembled this (adding 1/2c. dried cranberries for some tartnes)the night before a ladies tea. I baked it in the morning and poured the sauce on right away and served the whipped cream on the side. The reviews were mmmoans and eye rolls..that's good..right? For a dinner party I would (and will) bake this in individual ramekins, invert onto a large plate, drizzle with the ca-ca-caramel sauce, add a dollop of maple syrup infused whipped cream, and finish with a sliver of pecan brittle. Yummmm with 3 m's!!!! Move over pumpkin pie there is a new Thanksgiving dessert in town!

I made this last night at my boyfriend's home and we loved it. I never made nor ate bread pudding before and was pleasantly surprised. I made it according to directions except I added a few craisins along with the raisins. We just drizzled the caramel sauce on it and it was perfect. Not too sweet with just enough spice...making it a perfect ending to a meal or even great in the morning instead of a cinnamon bun. The "so called" pudding came together easily and I will definately make it again.

I'm in the "I love bread puddings camp". This one was certainly good and my guests ate it with gusto, but I thought it a tad too sweet. I cooked it in a bain-marie (I always do with any bread pudding - it results in a moister and lighter finished product). Next time, I'll cut back a bit on sugar...As desserts go, it's very easy, homey fare but certainly no show stopper - I have other bread puddings that are.

Made this at Xmas with the Molasses-Brined Turkey & Gingersnap gravy on Epicurious - both were wonderful. 1st time making a bread pudding.Used a 10 in round glass cassorole dish - no 11 by 7. Used French bread and added spiced rum to the sauce. Had no idea if I baked it enough since I'm new at bread puddings but everyone loved it. My son isn't a dessert eater but had 2 helpings.

This was the hands down favorite at Thanksgiving! My guests all did that blissed-out, eyes closed thing. I'm not a big pumpkin fan myself, but this made a believer out of me. I used my own blend of pumpkin pie-type spices to suit my personal preferences. The caramel sauce really made this sing. Will definitely make again, but maybe I'll mess with the half & half to spare a few calories.

Rating: 3
This was so easy! I used challah, which made a nice creamy consistency. But, based on other reviews used soy milk (my favorite) instead of the half and half - and it was indeed decadent enough w/out the cream. Also, next time I will definitely double the pumpkin pie spice, and add more cinnamon and a pinch of salt (considering adding more nutmeg and clove too...but that's a personal preference!). Served with vanilla gelato.

I made the carmel sauce, and to save time I poked holes through the pudding and poured the sauce over the top while in the pan.. When it was heated, the sauce melted all over each peice.

This is a very good recipe as written. I'm not a bread pudding fan (something about the texture always turned me off). But I do like this recipe.

Bon Appetit, will you PLEASE give readers nutrition information? This is why: I adjusted this recipe to halve the calories, halve the Weight Watchers points and cut 2/3 total fat. The serving size was still VERY generous (more than a cup + 2 T sauce) and the taste VERY rich. As written -- gag! To adjust, first plan to serve at least 8, not 6. In pudding, substitute whole milk for h&h and use 2/3 cup brown sugar. For sauce, use 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup cream. SKIP the powdered sugar and SKIP the whipped cream. Trust me! BTW -- I also used a molasses brown sugar from Zingerman's, very special, worth keeping on hand.

I have never been a bread pudding fan until now. This recipe was great and so easy to make. In fact, it was so simple that I was able to throw it together and put it in the oven right before we sat down for dinner so it was still warm and fresh from the oven when served. A nice twist on those pumpkin pie flavors I love so much. I served it with cinnamon whipped cream on top. Love the idea of serving it in jack be little pumpkins for a dinner party!

I made this yesterday for a Halloween birthday party.

Very yummy, and a hit with my family. I did think that the sauce was a tad rich, but the whole dessert smelled and tasted wonderful. Leftovers (this made a lot) also reheated well.

Easy to make and very good. Nice pumkin flavor and not too sweet. Next time I'll split the caramel sauce in half, as the recipe made twice as much as we needed. To cut fat/calories, I used whole milk in the pudding rather than half and half and wasn't disappointed.

Heavenly! The best dessert I have made to date. Very tasty, smooth and comforting. This must be one of those no-fail recipes, since I am not a very good cook, and yet this dish came out great!! I did a trial run for Thanksgiving, so I halved the ingredients. I also substituted 2% milk for the half and half, french bread for the egg bread, and omitted the raisins. My 2&1/2 year old kept asking for more. Presentation appeal increases tremendously when powdered sugar is dusted over the pudding, and caramel sauce is swirled onto serving dish. A keeper for sure!

I really like this recipe. I used firm homemade bread and it soaked up all the liquid. When I make it again I will use less bread.

this was surprisingly easy to make and extremely flavorful. The bread pudding has a nice pumpkin flavor but isn't overpowering. The caramel sauce is the kicker in this dish. For that reason, I would consider making the bread pudding with whole milk rather than half and half, and keeping all of the richness in the caramel sauce. By the way, this feeds 8, not 6. The caramel sauce would be good in any apple dessert too.

I made this last night for a Christmas eve dinner for 16. Went over well (but the chocolate dessert was a bigger hit). It's fantastically quick to make, and a lighter take on pumpkin pie.

This recipe is great. We have made it three times in the last two weeks and people rave about it. I recommend serving it with whipped cream. Also, cooking time varies based on the density of the bread that you use. It needs to cook until firm. The toothpick test is not a good indicator.

This is easy and pretty tasty, although a little one-note in terms of flavor; next time, I might add some Granny Smith apple chunks to round it out. Delicious with homemade whip cream--the caramel sauce recipe is not a "true" candy-thermometer caramel sauce, and so lacks a certain richness.

FABULOUS. So easy to make in the throws of plating up the Thanksgiving meal. It baked as we ate and was absolutely decadent. Unfortunately, my pumpkin walnut fudge, also found on this site, was not as successful and never set-up. Rather than throwing it out, I reheated it and served it with the bread pudding which added a double whammy of pumpkiness...wonderful. I used leftover cinnamon raisin bagels which may have been a little bit too pourous for a bread pudding recipe. I liked the consistency, as did my guests, but next time I'll try using challah or brioche for a creamier texture. That creamier version will probably rate four forks.

I tend to agree with the last reviewer in that I wasn't wild about this dish either.

Maybe I did something wrong, but this dish was not anything like the other reviewers have said. It had very little pumpkin flavor, other than an occasional hint of spice and raisins.

I would have given 4 forks on this, as the reception it received was marvelous. I had a little trouble, however, getting the recipe to true "bread pudding consistencey. Perhaps it's because I used fresh challah and it just sucked up the custard like little sponges. I added another half-can of pumpkin, an extra egg, another cup of half & half, 3/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 tsp cinnamon, whisked together and poured into and mixed into the pudding mixture in a 13 x 9 pan. The result was marvelous. I was too tired (served this for Thanksgiving) to do the caramel sauce, so opted for Breyer's vanilla bean ice cream as topping. Also re-heated the pudding prior to serving. WONDERFUL!

Really, really delicious. It was also very easy to make. And you don't have to use cream. I used sweet and condensed milk. Still came out rich and wonderful. It also travels well. I packed it like it was a kit. Put the bread cubes in one baggie and the pumpkin mixture in another and when it was time, just threw the whole thing together in a buttered dish. Put the caramel sauce on the stove and got out some vanilla ice cream. What a great finish to a thanksgiving meal.

I have made this recipe three times now with raving reviews from my family and guests. After my first time making this and using the golden raisins, I have chosen to omit them. The different textures of the bread and the raisins was not something I enjoyed. The caramel sauce completes this fabulous dessert as does vanilla ice cream. Left overs are equally delicious!! Definitely a "keeper"!!!

This is great! Just made it as a trial for Thanksgiving, and it is a go! Wanted something other than pumkin pie, but I love pumpkin. This is quick, easy and delicious. The caramel is yummy. I used dried cranberries instead of the raisins- nice for color.

Wonderful alternative to pumpkin pie. A hit here in Luxembourg, where pumpkin is not a common ingredient and just right for the season. Note: if using unsalted butter for the caramel sauce, add a pinch of salt - it needs it. (PS I gilded the lily by serving with vanilla ice cream - yum!)

This dish went over so well last Thanksgiving I am making it again. Last year it left the party without half the group trying it. Maybe this year everyone will get a taste.

I made this as a trial run for Thanksgiving dessert. It was so flavorful and would be a great alternative to pumpkin pie. I used vanilla soy milk instead of the half and half, and the pudding was still moist and creamy.

This was absolutely fabulous. I served it at a Halloween gathering last night, and people couldn't stop talking about it. I didn't use the caramel sauce that was suggested, but instead I used a white chocolate whiskey sauce, which was outstanding. (1 12 oz. bag of white chips, half can of condensed milk, 3 T of half-and-half, or to desired consistency, and 2 T of whiskey. I made the sauce up off the top of my head, because I needed to use a bag of white chips that I had opened by accident. It was decadent.) I highly recommend this recipe, especially to pumpkin lovers. It was a wonderful alternative to regular bread pudding, and I will DEFINITELY make it again!

I made this bread pudding for an office potluck...my boss had three helpings! I used regular french bread from the bakery instead of egg bread with no issues. To the caramel sauce I added three tablespoons of rum....yummy! Definitely serve it with homemade whipped cream.

I made this for a large group of people(150) and got numerous compliments. I did subsitute dried cranberries for the raisins and added a little whiskey and pecans to the carmel sauce. Topped with fresh whip cream, it was incredible!

This a wonderful fall bread pudding. The carmel sauce makes this. I served it with a scoop of Ben and Jerry's vanilla ice cream...YUM!! It makes a lot but is also good the next day warmed up.

Excellent!!! I'm not a big bread pudding fan either but this has incredible flavor. And DO make the homemade caramel sauce. It's to die for! I also topped it with whipped cream. What the heck - only live once!

A very rich, but delectable bread pudding!

I wanted to try this dish before making it at Thanksgiving so I gave it a whirl. As with most recipes, I changed a few things. I used a bread pan to bake the pudding in and I added 2 tablespoons of whiskey to the sauce and about 1/2 cup pecans. I also used dried cranberrys instead of raisins. All my immediate family loved it and I think my extended family will too on Thanksgiving. I would highly recommend this recipe. Good eating

The third time we made this desert was for my partner's family in Germany. After searching every store around and finding only pickled pumpkin, we decided to try using fresh sweet potatoes instead. The result? It was better than the pumpkin version and the entire family loved it! This has become my favorite dessert...an easy to make comfort food.

Generally I don't like pumpkin but this recipe is divine. It doesn't taste anything like pumpkin. The caramel sauce is great and very easy to make. Definitely a keeper for those winter dinners!

This is a great dessert! For serving, I took a round cookie cutter to cut the bread pudding. (The waste was eaten later as a snack.) Then I spooned a pool of caramel sauce on the plate and put the round on top finishing it all off with a dollop of whipped cream. Delicious!

I made this with home-made Russian Kulich, and added extra bread (about 12 cups) and half and half (i cup). Results: SUPERB! I have already made it 3 times since, and passed on the recipe to 4 friends!

I have never made or eaten bread pudding before, but I found myself with a loaf of challah bread and nothing to do with it. This recipe was really wonderful. It was so easy to prepare, and the results are just delicious. I made it with light brown sugar and regular old raisins (because that's what was in the pantry) and it turn out beautifully. The caramel sauce is tasty as well. I served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and the sauce drizzled over top. And the leftovers are great for breakfast!

I have never made bread pudding before and I was looking for something different. I was really delighted with this recipe. Next time I would use less sugar in the caramel sauce as I found it a little too sweet. Even my kids, who don't like much...liked this.

This was divine. I thought the caramel sauce suited the pumpkin/spice flavors particularly well. Next time I would more accurately measure the challah, because my bread pudding was kind of firm.

I made this tonight for my family for our Christmas Eve dinner and everybody loved it. I think I used too much bread, so next time, I'll use less bread, but it was still very good. The caramel sauce and whipped cream really make it. It was a great dessert, albeit, it didn't look overly fancy but it tasted decadent!

Made for some very picky friends and they all loved it. My husband doesnt' like raisens so I substituted dried cranberries as I usually do with anything pumpkin. Wonderful.

Put me in the camp of calling this a "make-againable" treat. I took some egg bread out of my freezer, and after cutting into cubes, I was left with only 7 oz. I made the pudding anyway, and it was wonderful. Very moist, flavorful, and tender. I will make it this way everytime.

I made this with panettone (Italian sweet bread) from Williams Sonoma and it was incredible. I very much enjoy the subtle addition of the glazed chestnuts in W/S panettone. Some of my guests commented that raisins would have also been nice. The texture is good, especially if you prefer a "breadier" bread pudding rather than a more custard one. Very simple recipe...don't forget to make the homemade caramel sauce...worth the effort!

We couldn't find egg bread either so used french bread. It was great. Our only mistake was to use a caserole dish rather than the flat pan called for. To get the center done, the edges were too hard. We served it with whipped cream. Yum! We plan to make it again for our holiday dinner party next week.

I was really disappointed in the texture of this bread pudding, particularly in light of all the spectacular reviews. It was heavy and gummy, without nice custard to counterbalance the bread. I did let the challah get stale as I usually do to make a bread pudding - perhaps it would work better with fresh bread. I also found it a bit sweet, particularly with the sauce. I think the sauce would be better with it if it cooked more and tasted more like burned caramel or if there was a little liquor in it to cut the sweetness. All in all, I was not happy with the results.

We made this evening to serve tomorrow night to guest. My husband and I had a small serving just to try it out. We both loved it and could hardly resist having more. Will definately make it again. Couldn't find egg bread and used french bread instead and can't see how it could be any better. The caramel sauce is wonderful and easy to make. A real winner.

This was delicious! It was a perfect choice for Thanksgiving, as I get very bored with the same old pumpkin pie every year. I omitted the raisins and also skipped the caramel sauce (I think it would have made the dish way too rich). I did serve with whipped cream - it was a nice contrast to the bread pudding. Wonderful flavor - this recipe is a definite keeper!!!!

Nobody touched the pie. I served this dessert at Thanksgiving, which was a potluck. The pumkin bread pudding dissappeared and there were three pies left untouched. It was so easy to prepare and absolutely delicious. Have the recipe ready to hand out if you make it for a group.

We served this at our Thanksgiving dinner and it was an incredible hit! I selected it because I wanted to do something different with pumpkin but dessert is my least favorite course and my expectations were not high. I was totally taken aback by the fabulous taste!! I usually think that any dessert that is not chocolate is not worth eating but I loved this more than any dessert I have had in recent memory. We frequently entertain with epicurious recipes and I thought this was a five fork dessert.

This was a huge hit with the Thanksgiving crowd! I left out the raisins, and forgot to sift on the powdered sugar, and neither were missed. I also didn't serve it with the suggested whipped cream, since it's quite a rich recipe as is.

Very easy recipe to make. I substituted dried cranberries for the raisins and used a cinnamon challah for the bread. Personally thought the bread was too gummy, but the crowd at dinner loved it and several asked for the recipe. Might try it again with a different bread choice.

Yummy, perfect for the Holidays. Very simple to make in one big bowl. Added more raisins and some crunchy sugar for the top. Skipped the caramel sauce and it was perfect without. Ate the cold leftovers out of the fridge the next morning!!
