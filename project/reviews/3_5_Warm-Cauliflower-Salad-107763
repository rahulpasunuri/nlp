Delicious! I also roasted the cauliflower and I warmed the dressing up in a saucepan before adding it to the cauliflower. Just wondering what temp others roast for and how long? Trying to get the right combo...

No leftovers when I made this! I did roast the cauliflower as well. Next time I will make a little extra dressing.

For the first time ever, my kids ate cauliflower! I followed the recipe pretty much as written, except that I used anchovy paste instead of a whole anchovy. Dee-yummy.

I love this combination of ingredients. AND cauliflower has been one of my favorite vegetables since I learned to microwave it so the flavor doesn't disappear with the boiling water. I've also roasted it to great effect. I wonder why does anyone boil it? For those wondering about anchovies: they totally disappear into the mixture. There are great recipes for dishes including anchovy or the various Asian fish sauces like Nuok Mam, a mixed fish sauce.

I made this exactly as written except I roasted the cauliflower instead of boiling. Delicious! Even my 3- year-old gobbled it up.

This was quite a hit in my house! I hate those reviews that tweak the recipes, but...I used less salt, double anchovies, 50% more capers and lemon juice, and 50% less oil. I used a medium, orange cauliflower, and blanched it briefly - 5 minutes would have been too much. It was beautiful in addition to delicious! Oh yes, I also minced and added about a tablespoon of bottled in oil, julienne(d?), sun-dried tomatoes. I was scared, but it was a great addition! I can't wait to make this again!!

Definately a different way of serving cauliflower. You have to be a lover of anchovy and capers to appreciate this dish. I took the other review's comments into consideration and added 4 T of lemon juice...the only problem was that you had to drain off some of the excess liquids while serving. That being said, we still enjoyed this dish. I would definately do this one again

A delicious and exceptional way to make cauliflower. I doubled the anchovies and kept everything else as is. Scrumptious!

Hard to believe, but I found this recipe a bit bland. I used multi- colored varities of cauliflower for interest, but the dressing didn't pack the kick I was expecting. Next time, I'm going to try to experiment with the proportions.

I bought cauliflower with some trepidation--I don't really like it raw, but felt experimental. This recipe had a really nice flavour and texture, but mine came out rather salty--my only complaint, and that's easy enough to fix. I will DEFINITELY try this again!

I loved this dish. I ended up using dried parsley since I had everything else on hand and didn't want to go to the store, and it was still fantastic. I ate all of it by myself.

I am an 11 year old girl and I made this for my mom and grandma's birthday! They LOVED it! They said that the flavor combination was really good. I just about doubled the lemon in the dressing because when I tested it, I found it too olive oily. I also left out the anchovie because my grandma is allergic to fish. This recipe is definately a keeper. Thanks epicurious!

I made this with purple cauliflower: the cooking water was beautiful, but the cauliflower rather gray. When I put the dressing on, it turned a vibrant lavender-pink! So for Easter I used a mixture of white, orange, and purple cauliflower - a delicious and beautiful dish which surprised and delighted everyone!

My husband and I loved this recipe. Following some other advice, I doubled the lemon and added a little soy sauce, leaving out the anchovie and capers. I also cut the parsley back quite a bit. I sauted a little red pepper for just a couple of minutes to add color, and added cooked shrimp to make this a main dish salad. I'll do this again for guests as a side dish with grilled meat - a sort of surf and turf.

I converted this recipe to be Vegetarian: use slightly more lemon juice (I used 1 entire lemon). Replace the anchovy with a splash or two of Bragg's Liquid Aminos or soy sauce. It was great, and really livened up a rather boring vegetable! Yum! It's also great with broccoflower.

I think this cauliflower dish is a real winner. It is very easy and delicious, although I would recommend that you leave out hte parsley. I have made it 4 times during the holidays. It is a great pot luck dish and all of those folks so think they don't like anchovies gobble it up. I even double the anchovies.

I was disappointed with this recipe. I love every single one of the ingredients, so I thought it was a sure thing. But I felt that the cauliflower's delicate flavor was compromised, the dressing wasn't tangy enough, and the parsley masked the brininess of the capers and the earthiness of the anchovy (and I only used 1/3 of the amount of parsley called for). If I were ever to make it again, I'd leave out the parsley entirely, increase the lemon juice, increase the anchovy, and increase the pepper. But I'm not sure it would be worth the bother. For now, I'll stick to roasting cauliflower with garlic.

Delicious and a snap to make. In addition to the parsley, I added one half diced red pepper for looks. Will definitely make again.

This is fine, nothing special, but easy enough to throw together on a worknight.

This was really great! Fantastic flavor. Next time I'll puree the dressing for a smoother consistancy. The chopped capers and anchovy bits can be a little unappealing to people not accustomed to those tastes (like my boyfriend, although he really enjoyed it anyway).

My kids like cauliflower but it has not been one of my favorites. I decided to try something new and this one was great. Everyone enjoyed it, and no one guessed it had anchovies!

Light, tasty, and easy. Even cauliflower haters love it! Don't tell them there's anchovy in it and they'll never know.
