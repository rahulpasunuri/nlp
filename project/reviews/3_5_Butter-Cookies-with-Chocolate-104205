I made these to have on hand for the weekend of my wedding, and three years later they have become one of my husband's favorite cookies. I make them every year for Christmas, but instead of chopping chocolate to add to the dough I dip them in melted chocolate (Trader Joe's dark or bittersweet pound plus, microwaved at 50% power til melted). I think they're much prettier that way, and still delicious!

Disappointing - these cookies will not make it into my holiday repertoire. Maybe it's the altitude (3700 feet), but these cookies are dry. After tasting the first batch, I added fleur de sel, which helps somewhat, but not enough to make them again.

This is a fantastic cookie. It is really the same as Chip Wiches in Bon Appetit August, 1990 and June, 1990 which I have been making for years whenever I wanted a really special cookie. It is really a shortbread with add ins. Just this is sliced instead of rolled out. I used mini chocolate chips and dipped one side of finished cookie in chocolate.

I may have accidentally added an extra cup of flour -- I'm not sure -- but at any rate, these didn't hold together well at all. I was never able to form good log-shapes, and even after chilling everything over night, I still ended up with cookie fragments instead of cookies. The results tasted like like sweet butter with bits of chocolate. No surprise with butter cookies, but 4 sticks of butter is a lot!

These were very, very good. I added rum extract to one batch and it was very tasty. I used M & M's too and they made for a nice looking cookie.

This was an easy recipe to make and the cookies were delicious. I substituted white chocolate chips, but made the mistake of not chopping them, which made the dough hard to slice thin. They were still good.

Not the greatest cookies ever, but tasty and relatively easy. My friends at the office liked them better than I did. Do yourself a favor and slice the chilled dough with a very sharp and heavy knife.
