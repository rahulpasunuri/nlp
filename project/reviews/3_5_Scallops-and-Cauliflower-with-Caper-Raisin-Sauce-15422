This was good but I'd rather have someone else make it for me. I tried for half an hour to cut the cauliflower thinly and it was a crumbly mess. Used a mandoline, then several different knives. Never got it right. Try to find a super tight cauliflower, mine was a little looser constructed, maybe that means it's older? (it was fresh and organic but just not hard&tight). The sauce is very good, and can be made ahead a few hours. I did this as a first course...if you do that, your main course should have little last minute prep as you'll end up with too much to do to get each course on the table.

We were really looking forward to this recipe for a special occasion dinner as we are definitely fans of Jean Georges and love scallops. We all agreed that this recipe was only okay. Next time we will definitely make scallops with capers and sundried tomatoes (also on Epicurious) which is far better.

Very labor intense and I did not feel it was worht it. Most of my guests liked it, but I am a harsher critic and thought it was just average. Make sure your scallops are dry before cooking or they will not carmelize.

There's a good reason to use golden raisins and not reguar ones...what a yucky color! But still very tasty.

I'm a purist (or not inventive) and followed the recipe and the outcome was great. The sauce is what makes this dish and i will try it with other meats. Excellent.

This is truly an extraordinary dish. We used no butter. None. A dash of oil to saute the cauliflower and the same for the scallops. They were superb. The sauce is out of this world. This is the dish to serve when your food-snob friends are coming for dinner. Like another reviewer, I deglazed the pan after cooking the cauliflower and scallops and used an immersable blender to do the sauce- less fuss and mess.

Excellent sauce! I modified the recipe by making the scallops an entree and serving them on a bed of julianned green beans and carots, then drizzling the caper-raisin sauce on top of the scallops. Served along side a dish of pasta aglio-oglio for a fantastic meal.

I don't own a mandoline, so I just cut the cauliflower into narrow slices. I followed the recipe to a tee, but think I made a mistake when I plated the scallops and drizzled every last drop of sauce atop them on the plate. The sauce is very very piquant, in a good way, but a little goes a long way. I would try it again, perhaps going a little lighter on the capers, since they have so much flavor in them, and using much less sauce.

One word: Amazing!

I have to say Jean-George is my hero. His technique for scrambled eggs was for me an epiphany. Use your smallest sauce pan, put in some butter, melt over medium heat. Beat your eggs dump them in then stir while cooking. In the blink of an eye you have the most buttery wonderful never over cooked yet also not runny eggs in the world. Breakfast will never be the same again.

I liked this a great deal - but made it with a lot less fuss. I only used one pan, doing the cauliflower first, then the scallops, then deglazing with some water and white wine and the vinegar (used champagne vinegar instead of sherry, what I had on hand,) and made sauce in the pan, used immersion blender. I think scallops have enough flavor to go with this sauce. I did rinse my capers, out of habit, so maybe my sauce was slightly less pronounced on the sour side - but I could definitely taste the flavor of those lovely little berries!

This was a very simple dish to prepare in minimum amount of time with spectacular results. The sauce had a mild sweet and sour taste. The presentation was lovely and would make a wonderful appetizer. The only thing that I would change is that I would use some white wine to deglaze the pan instead of water as the water bouncing on a drop or two of oil caused far too much splattering.

Unusual flavor combination; sauce perhaps a little strong for the delicate flavor of scallops. Probably works best as an appetizer instead of a main course. Piquant, interesting, and well within a 60-minute prep time.
