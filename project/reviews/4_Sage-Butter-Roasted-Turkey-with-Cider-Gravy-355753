Great gravy and simple to make. I loved it.

Could have used a tad more flavor. The gravy was a great touch, but I'd hoped the spices and whatnot would soak into the meat more. Maybe if it marinated or something for a while before cooking.

Followed the recipe to the letter with 20lb turkey. It came out beautifully juicy but about 20minutes early. Luckily we were monitoring. I needed to babysit it a little, really pouring a little cider and stock every 15mins or so. It was juicy and flavorful. Loved the subtle flavors and happy it was not at all sweet

We used a free-range chicken instead of turkey, adjusting quantities and roasting time accordingly. Also used true cider instead of apple juice. The cider infused the chicken with a sweetness and tenderness that was truly delicious. Highly recommend.

I wish I had followed the suggestion for rinsing the turkey. I used Kosher salt for the rub, and the gravy was unbearably salty. I even tried the potato trick to no avail. Other than that it was fine, but nothing special.

This was the juciest turkey I've every had. It was a bit salty but no one minded. The family thought it was delicious. It was very simple and a huge success.

The overnight salt rub (with Kosher salt, not table salt) was a god-send. The bird was moist and very flavorful. I didn't rinse the pan out and the gravy was perfectly seasoned and didn't taste sweet at all. I did skip the apple brandy as we didn't have any, but I did use real apple cider, NOT apple juice.

OK, but not wonderful. The skin never fully crisped and the flavor was nothing special. I do think the turkey was one of the juciest I've had - even after a day of leftovers in the fridge. The recipe definitely wins on EASE. Nothing better than waking up, preheating the oven, and popping the bird in to roast. *** To those who felt the bird was too salty: Use Kosher salt. The same amount of table salt is 3-4 times saltier.

I made this for Thanksgiving. It was the moistest turkey ever. My sister couldn't make it and we sent her a plate of leftovers. She called the next day to ask what I had done to the turkey, that it was the best. I will do this again. I didn't make the gravy.

This was terrific, a big hit! My only complaint was that I had to take the turkey out of the oven about 1/2 hour ahead of when the recipe had said; that bird was cooked! Luckily cooked perfectly, moist and delicious; thank goodness I checked. The skin looked gorgeous and tasted better. We took the comments about the salt into consideration and decided NOT to rinse the bird, but to rinse out the roasting pan after the bird had been in the fridge overnight. Gravy seemed perfectly seasoned. It could have been thicker, though. Next time, I would add more of a roux to it. Definitely would make again.

I took the comments about it being too salty into consideration and gave brine bath instead. Also, I used home-brewed cider, which was less sweet.

This turkey was definitely a success for Thanksgiving. The gravy was a little sweet, but I added some whole garlic cloves, chardonay, and low sodium chicken broth while simmering in the roasting pan to give that "salty-sweet" effect which worked out quite well. I also added thyme to the sage butter and stuffed the bird with lemons, thyme, and sage. The skin didn't look as beautiful as the picture but it definitely tasted wonderful and was extremely moist.

The bird turned out great with this recipe. I was not as big a fan of the gravy. I made a few modifications: 1) Used a turkey breast instead of a whole turkey - roasted at 350 for 1 hour, then turned down to 325 for another hour and a half. It was perfectly cooked and had a great flavor. I covered it loosely with foil until the last hour and it got brown, but not as crispy as I would have liked. 2) The roasting pan wouldn't fit in my fridge, so the overnight salt and sage rub took place in a glass casserole. Therefore, there was not as much salt and sage in the roasting pan itself and it made a difference when it came to the gravy. I used low-sodium chicken broth and it needed salt. 3) Didn't have apple brandy, so did without. All in all, I didn't love the gravy - a little too sweet for me. I did keep it and may try it on a pork loin, which I think would suit it nicely. I will definitely cook the turkey this way again.

Definitely a keeper and will make again. I had to substitute ground and rubbed sage, as there was no fresh sage to be found (I live on an island) which worked out well. I substituted brandy/cognac for the Calvados, as I did not have any on hand either. I followed the suggestion of rinsing the turkey after letting it sit overnight in the sage/salt rub. I then mildly rubbed it with the ground sage to re-apply what I had just rinsed off. End result, delicious, very moist and not too salty.

Regarding scout34's salty gravy (perhaps from the pan drippings): substitute 4 tbsp. of butter for the pan drippings. This is how I always fix gravy and mine wasn't overly salty.

I used coarse salt, but didn't rinse the turkey. I suppose that would have made a lot more sense!

I haven't made it yet (3 more days!), but regarding the salt issue: I think there may be a step missing in the instructions. I checked 3 different recipes for salted turkeys from BA, including the delicious one i made last year (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Salted-Roast-Turkey-with-Orange-Fall-Spices-and-Sherry-Gravy-350434). ALL of them said to rinse the turkey inside and out after salting overnight. Maybe this would explain the overly salty gravy?

to scout34 above, did you use coarse salt or regular salt? I am planning to make this for thanksgiving, didn't make it yet.

First the good: the turkey came out beautifully. Gorgeous color and flavor, and very, very moist. I also loved the cider and sage in the gravy. I didn't have Calvados -- and the guy at the liquor store said he'd never heard of it (!) -- but, really, I didn't miss it. The main problem I had with this recipe was that the gravy came out extremely salty. Since I used low-salt broth and didn't add any additional salt to the gravy, I assume that it came from the drippings, which were salty from the salt rub. I would love some suggestions on how to solve this problem, because otherwise, this recipe was great. Maybe a brine bath instead of a salt rub? Or using the gizzards/neck as a base for the gravy instead of the pan drippings?
