Two forks because I found this only average. Sure it had a fair amount of flavor and the hot sauce added a nice little kick. The basil gives it a nice dimension. But it was not an 'aha' experience. For one, I found it too rich. Perhaps a bisque is not my thing. I did cut back on the cream and substituted clam juice by water. And added even more water while reheating to thin it out some more. Even so, this seemed too rich and lacked complexity of flavor. If I want crab soup, this won't be my go-to recipe.

Super easy and absolutely delicious. I didn't have clamato and used a can of tomato sauce mixed with clam juice. Added about 1 cup additional clam juice than the recipe called for during cooking and omitted the water at the end. Added extra Old Bay, too. It was a little heavy on the basil which overwhelmed the crab. I'd reduce to about a 1/4 cup. I did use canned crab (doubled to 14 ounces)[sorry foody purists!], and didn't top with crab at the end... Liquid diet fare for broken-jawed BF. Extraordinarily good.

FABULOUS with tweaks suggested by other reviewers: use unsalted butter to reduce saltiness; use more garlic (I used 8 cloves for a recipe increased by half); substitute spicy seafood cocktail sauce instead of ketchup and pepper sauce (I only used 2 TBS for the increased recipe size); skip the clam juice; use chicken stock instead of water if needed to thin at end. I used the 16 oz Costco crab. Fiance ADORED it and urged me to write this review. Better as leftovers!

I now use halibut instead of crab when making this soup as I have an abundance. Halibut flakes like crab after cooking as in 1st paragraph. In a pinch, I've also used evaporated milk instead of cream as the other flavors cover the evaporated milk taste. I omit clam juice and sometimes the water if I reduce flour.

I made this as written except I used a full pound of cleaned crab to serve 5 people. I think I decreased the ketchup and bottled clam juice by just a bit - used a scant 1/4 cup. My Christmas Eve company was thoroughly impressed. I found it delicious but very rich. We followed this a few hours later with live oysters, cheese and crackers, olives, pickles and cocktails. We had to save the main course tri-tip for the next day!

Made this for Christmas Eve this year. It is rich but quite good and easy to make. I would make it again.

This was a bit of a disappointment after all the great reviews. I followed the recipe to the letter, using the lump crab from Costco. To me, it was a bit too thick and lacked the flavor I was expecting. I wouldn't make it again - especially with the cost of the ingredients.

I made this for company (with Prime Rib) and it was very good, but actually, it was better the next day. I didn't change anything, except using Phillips Crabmeat from Costco (and used the whole 16 oz) and used the emersion blender instead of the blender. Easier, for sure. I felt it was a bit too thick, so I'd cut down on the flour next time and maybe use plain tomato juice and increase the clam juice. Seemed a waste of money to buy Clamato (no other use for it) and clam juice rather than buy tomato and use the entire bottle of clam juice.

I've never written a review before, but I couldn't help myself with this one... In agreement with most others, this is fantastic. Simple and easy to prepare, and it makes you feel like an absolute genius in the kitchen once you've tasted it. I took the advice of others and cut back on the ketchup and clam juice (halved both ingredients), and the results were magnificent. Used precooked fresh Dungeness crabmeat. Excellent flavor, not "fishy" at all. Topped some linguine with it for my little boy, and he wolfed it down. My husband couldn't have been more pleased. Absolutely a dish to serve for company.

My husband and I both thought this was a yummy soup. And, as a bonus, very easy to make. I loosely followed the recipe. It seems very flexible and can take lots of variations depending what ingredients you have on hand, which is great.

This is an excellent, excellent soup -- very flavorful and extraordinarily easy to make. I've made this twice in the past six weeks. The first time I followed the recipe nearly verbatim, using fresh Dungeness crab. The second time I doubled the recipe; used 16 ounces of Phillip's Pasteurized Crab Meat (Costco); substituted Clam juice for the water; switched to unsalted butter (to balance the saltiness of the additional clam juice; used only three tablespoons of flour (for the doubled recipe); and skipped blending the soup (it doesn't need it). The second version was less expensive, even tastier, and enough for two nights (yum). I expect to use this for my next dinner party, and I know my guests will love it as much as my husband and I.

My husband said this was the best soup he's ever had. I thought it was much too thick - I will cut the flour in half next time. I also won't bother with the clam juice next time - will just use an extra 1/4 cup of Clamato or water. The lemon at the end is a must.

Fabulous! I just made it with fresh crab that I caught and cleaned down the Jersey Shore. Quick and easy. I had read and used other reader's ideas...one is I used the 1/2 low sodium v8 and 1/2 spicy v8, both instead of ketchup., also my local grocer did not have fresh basil, but I tried the "squeezible" tube made from basil and herbs...worked great, and no cutting, etc.. Also, used a fresh tomatoe from my garden and used a bit of tomato paste, also. Instead of water, I used chicken broth. I wish I had a bit more crab...can never have enough crab...great dish!! Four forks!!

Rating: 4
Outstanding! I've made this several times, using this recipe as a springboard for slight variations, and it's always turned out beautifully. Also, going to the trouble of making your own stock makes a chef proud, but really, using store-bought stuff (or GASP, having to use chicken broth) still makes for a heavenly soup.

I live alone in Japan, so it's nice to not to have to cook every meal. This lasted me for a few, and I was happy to eat it each time. I couldn't find clam juice so I substituted shell-fish boullion. Instead of ketchup, I used some leftover canned whole pealed tomatos from a meal the day before and diced them. I also couldn't find Old Bay seasoning so I ooked up the recipe for Old Bay and just threw in what I had on that list. The lemon juice is essential! I WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN.

Rating: 4
Definitely 4 forks! I followed the recipe with 2 exceptions. I chose to make a crab stock (also found in Epicurious) and I also chose to leave out the ketchup. Save the adding of the water til the end.. you may or may not need it depending on thick you like your bisque. I belong to a Gourmet Dinner club who enjoys finding delicious new recipes). This was a hit!!! Not one drop left over. It was easy to make (making your own crab stock takes a little time but is NOT hard). And Ohhhh... so tasty! Even my kids and a few neighbors not in the club who got to sample it said "it was to die for..... all thumbs up". The neat thing is if you make your own crab stock you can easily double or triple the batch!

I can't truely review this recipe as written because I followed the suggestions from so many other reviewers. First I made a very quick and simple crab stock in place of clam juice- which did add great flavor. Second I didn't add ketchup but did add a little tomato paste. One thing I didn't like was adding the flour to the crab and butter mixture - I felt it was gummy and took a really long time to cook the raw flour taste away - next time (and I will make it again) I would make a simple roux with the flour and the butter and then add the crab, garlic, and basil. I made this for a formal dinner party and it was a great first course.

I just made this for our company "Soup Bowl" and got 2nd place. I'm pretty sure the only reason I didn't get 1st place is because it ran out in the first half hour! I doubled this recipe and it worked fine. I also left out the ketchup and used Phillips crabmeat from Costco. I didn't use the Clamato based on the reviews here but instead substituted with half low-sodium V8 and half spicy-hot V8 and left out the hot sauce. I also didn't puree. The best part is that I made it the night before and it held up fine being reheated in the crock-pot. Divine, got great raves and lots of requests for the recipe!

This bisque was soooo fishy. Yuck! I will not make this again. I wonder if it would be *less* fishy if you left out the clam juice and clamato and substituted with just V-8? Just a thought :)

This is wonderful! I've made it numerous times to raves. I always double the receipe and blend about half of it so it still has some texture. Truly amazing.

We love this!!! And have made it numerous times. My husband added liquid crab boil to the recipe which was a great addition. He also made it a little spicier. Everyone we have served it too loves it. A definite keeper!!! If you like tomatoes, basil and crab you will love this.

This is a keeper but without any blending. Loved the chunks of tomato and of course used Dungeness crab. Used clam juice and tomato juice in place of Clamato and catsup. The fresh chopped basil was a hit.

Initially I ommited the flour and ketchup- then added them (but used less)as I wantd it to less watery. I made it a day ahead and refrigerated it- It was a hot night and we were dining outside so I served it cold(after tasting) and then garnished it with crab meat- It was the hit of the party- everyone raved! Did not add Clam juice. Did not puree- it didn't need it.

Rating: 4
This was an excellent bisque but I strongly feel you must use crab stock to get the same result I did. I used all crab stock (made from picked over crab carcass shells) in place of the clamato, clam juice and water and I did not add ketchup. I added a little bit of the tomato juice for color from the canned tomatoes I used (didn't have any fresh handy). I think the crab stock makes all the difference because I feel that clam juice and clamato taste somewhat unnatural and are too strong. I also did not puree the soup and it was plenty creamy/velvety and thick but not too thick. My husband also commented that it's nice to get a few more chunky bits instead of just having pure liquid. A definite keeper for my recipe file.

Well, I made this precisely as written and served it to my husband and another couple. I even purchased snow crab leg clusters and removed the meat myself rather than buying canned crab. The two men enjoyed it immensely and the two women (one of which was me) did not care for it at all, but nonetheless ate it anyway. Both of the women agreed that it was the Clamato juice that gave it an unusual taste. I rated it 2 forks because the guys liked it so much, but if it wasn't for them, I would give it only 1 fork. I'm afraid that I would have to agree with amars from MI and say, "BLAH"!

This is a fantastic basic tomato bisque- try it w/o the crab too. Made it at the restaurant to much fanfare. Made polenta croutons and a balsamic drizzle... yum.

I like this recipe because it can be made ahead of time (always a benefit for we restaurant people). I too leave out the ketchup. As we like a little more "kick", we add a little more garlic, basil, hot pepper sauce and fresh lemon juice. We do not blend it, However, I have blended 1/2 of it and then incorporated that into the not blended half. We are adding the amended version to our winter/spring menu this year, as when ran it as a special, it sold very well.

This one was amazing and the whole family loved it and begged for more. Easy to prepare after work it became the whole meal. The Old Bay seasoning isn't so easy to find here but found it and was great! Will certainly make it again!

This was delicious and not as difficult to make as antipicated. Very rich and flavorful. We did not bother to puree the soup because we like the chunky texture. Used a combination of crab claw meat and chopped shrimp but otherwise followed the recipe pretty closely. Might try reducing the amount of flour and basil slightly next time.

This is a great soup for a snowy winter day--or any day for that matter. Its creamy and tasty...I doubled the recipe and instead of using 2 cups of cream, just used one and added more tomato clam juice. I also used imitation crabmeat and it was still delicious. Bravo!

Very tasty. I took the advice of previous reviewers and omitted the ketchup. I doubled the fresh tomato and added a bit more basil than called for. I did not puree the soup because I like it chunky. Next time I think I'll add a little less than 1 cup of cream and a bit less flour. Don't add all the water at once, add it a bit at a time until the desired consistency is achieved. The chunky version is excellent served atop good-quality fresh pasta.

Served this with lunch with the open-faced Scandanavian shrimp sandwiches (recipe also on this site). It was a really "pretty" lunch, with great taste. It was especially nice because so much of the time-consuming preparation was done the day before and it came together quickly just before serving.

I made this recipe exactly as written (except I didn't puree it because I didn't think it was necessary), but I had to go back and make some adjustments. The ketchup is not needed and made it too sharp, so I added more heavy cream to smooth the taste. Also, don't just add all the water to it. Instead, judge how thick or thin you prefer bisque to be. Having said this, my family really loved this recipe.

This was SOOO good! My husband was pratically swooning. We had it for dinner with just some good bread and a cucumber salad. However, I must add that I had crab broth in the freezer (made it last time we had cracked crab) so I used it instead of the clam juice and the water, and instead of clamato juice I used one cup of tomato sauce plus a half cup of crab broth. Otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter, including pureeing, albeit with an immersible blender, so it wasn't completely smooth. I made it the night before we ate it. So, for us there was plenty of good crab flavor. I really like the addition of the fresh crab sprinkled over the smooth soup.

We made this for a progressive dinner (red & white theme), all LOVED it and requested the recipe. Would have liked to try it the next day, but alas, none leftover. Bummer. Stuck with recipe to the letter, then realized we needed servings for 8, not 6. Merely added more cream and clamato. Next time may not puree' just to go for the chunk factor. E-Z to make. Will definitely repeat.

I thought this was yummy. I agreed w/a previous reviewer that adding the ketchup would have given it to much tomato flavor for my taste. I'm not a fan of puree to much so I kep everything chunky and served it as a dinner with crusty french bread and topped it with a shredded four cheese blend. My husband also likes spicy, so I added creole seasoning to taste instead of pepper sauce. Totally rich and yummy.

Have to confess I made some changes. How much corn syrup does crab require? After I cleaned the crab I used the shells to make stock (cover w/water sim 20 min & strain)I replaced the Clamato with Knudsen's Very Veggie and ommitted the ketchup. Using crab stock, didn't need water or clam juice. When crab season is over will use shrimp shell stock. A hit with company and very easy.

It was alot of work, but well worth it. I made it for a food and wine pairing dinner and served it with a French chablis...it was wonderful!
