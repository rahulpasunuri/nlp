Without the mint this worked fabulously with Epicurious recipie Salmon in a Bengali Mustard Sauce

Very good indeed. Reduced the pine nuts and mint to 1/4 and a handful, respectively. I'd skip the bay leaf if your saffron's good enough.

This was a perfect accompaniment to crown roast of lamb for Xmas dinner. It looks wonderful and tastes better. The cinnamon and currants made it sort of Christmassy. The cumin seed and saffron gives it a bit of a Moroccan flavor, which went well with lamb. It might overpower less flavorful meat. I had to cook it much longer than 20 minutes to absorb all the liquid. The commenter who said it was soggy probably just didn't cook it long enough. I would absolutely include toasted pine nuts as it provides excellent flavor and texture. And I would not make this for a palate that prefers simple tastes. Just look at the ingredients! It is complex and flavorful, which is what I like. I will make this again.

I make this all the time, but with variations. I am still perfecting the water to rice ratio because I like to use basmanti or brown rice instead. They produce a nuttier flavor but both varieties require more cooking time and about an extra 3/4 cup of water. Try adding more dried mint and sultanas for a sweeter flavor. This is perfect with lamb. It also livens up baked salmon.

Was considering this dish for Easter. Think I'll take a pass. A little too Persian for lamb and ham and us potato eaters. Also a little blah. More mint and salt for sure. Let sit under cover after cooking to soften rice completely. Maybe nice in a stuffed/steamed cabbage leaf however. Husband really didn't like at all.

I made this with a two encrusted racks of New Zealand lamb and a turkey for Christmas. I figured it would be an interesting change from the boring white rice. Instead of currents I used dried cranberries; and I had some trouble finding saffron, but eventually did. It was not worth the effort. It came out gooey and the spice mixture gave it a very unpleasant flavor. After a quick poll of the 12 people at the table, we decided to scrap it and had Christmas dinner with no rice.

This is a great recipe. I made it with a dry rub/crusted porkchop and everyone loved it! I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is fantastic! I use dried cranberries instead of the currents and it is just awesome. I serve it along side bbq'd lamb chops.

I did not have any cumin seed on hand so I simply added a dash of cumin powder with the rice. Also I improvised minced onion( dehydrated ) and added that also with the rice. Did not use currants as called out since I have finicky eaters, but the next time I make this I will definitely add them and enjoy it myself. The toasted pine nuts were a delicious addition and I recvd 4 thumbs up from the peanut gallery. I served this with Roast Chicken smothered in Butter and rubbed in Fresh Garlic and Rosemary. Great dinner before Girl Scouts!!!

I doubled the recipe for Easter and served it with the spice-rubbed butterflied leg of lamb. It was very good and everyone went back for more. It will be a standard now for Easter!

This was really excellent. I made this to go with the "Rack of Lamb with Spinach Pine-Nut Crust". I didn't have any saffron but used curry powder instead. Everyone loved it!

Perfectly delicious. We served this with the Swordfish with Salmoriglio Sauce. I doubled this recipe to serve ten people believing that leftovers would be excessive. There was a scant spoonful left. I used white raisins available in my cupboard and for the doubled recipe only 1 teaspoon of salt. More would have been too salty. I cooked the rice early in the afternoon, reheated before serving to add the pine nuts and mint leaves. It was special occasion perfect.

I served this rice with my Easter Lamb. It was wonderful. Something out of the ordinary I look forward to making it again. It did not dryout so the leftover rice was just as good. This makes it a great make ahead dish.

This receipe was exquisite! I actually served it with a grilled citrus salmon fillet and the combined flavors were delightful. Also, since I am not a fan of currants or raisins, I substituted dried cranberries. The exchange was wonderful. The fruit still had a little bite, but the additional sweetness of the cranberries blended nicely with the citrus marinade on the salmon. Also, the color addition (red) made the presentation very pleasant. Thanks for a great recipe.
