very tasty- and not too hard to make- I think I will make triple the sauce next time so I have extra to put over the ice cream (as shown in the picture..)

This seemed really easy to me--everything is done in one pan. I used a cast-iron skillet. I've made it with plums as well as other fruit, and I've also reduced the quantities and made two servings.

Delicious. Easy and fast to make. (Didn't pretoast the nuts. Used walnuts instead of hazelnuts.) Not having an oven-proof skillet, I simply moved the warm syrup to a baking dish with a rubber spatula and proceeded. Everyone raved about the flavor. Baked in-season fruit is wonderful.

I've never had 'plum crisp' but if it's as delicious as this but less hassle to make then I'd love the recipe.

what a fussy way to make plum crisp
