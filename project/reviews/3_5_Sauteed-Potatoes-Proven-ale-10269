Phooey - I thought I was going to be the first to rate this recipe. Nonetheless, I agree that it was wonderful. It did take quite a long time to get the potatoes crispy, so then it was a little disturbing to pour sauce on them, knowing they were going to soften back up, but the result was worth it. I used lemon juice rather than zest for ease of preparation.

I can't believe I'm the first to rate this excellent recipe. This is only the second dish at Epicurious I've given four forks to, and I highly recommend it. Definitely add some leeks (just the white parts), and try it with the pork chops in rosemary-vinegar sauce. Do NOT make this the least bit ahead, or it gets soggy.
