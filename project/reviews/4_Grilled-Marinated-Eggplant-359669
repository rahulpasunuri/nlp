I followed the recipe pretty much as directed. Since I don't have a grill, I put the eggplant in my George Foreman electric. Absolutely delicious. I can't wait to make my leftover sandwich at work on Monday.

Excellent combination of flavours. I did not bother with dipping the eggplant in balsamic, I just added the vinegar to the parsley mixture. I didn't think I would like it "chewy" as described so did brush some oil on before grilled the eggplant.

An easy yet tasty dish that is a cook's best friend--it's made hours before it's served and only gets better the longer one waits. A terrific addition to a summer menu.

fabulous flavor! after mixing the "pesto" with the eggplant i chopped up the eggplant and the parsley pesto and mixed it into cheese tortellini... IT WAS AMAZING!

DELICIOUS! I wasn't able to grill the eggplant, so I dipped in the balsamic vinegar, spread on the marinade and then BAKED it in a 9x13 pyrex dish until tender. Then I chilled it to create the appetizer. It could also be served warm as a side dish. This is one of the best ways to use eggplant that I've found.

Because I was out of capers, I used olives instead; I also added walnuts to the mixture. The blandness of the eggplants combined with the 'pesto' was just perfect.

The flavor of this eggplant is amazing. I used a cast iron pan instead of the grill, and fresh chili instead of dry. Exceptionally simple and delicious. I had some extra balsamic, so I combined it with the extra parsley mixture and marinated chicken in it. I would recommend it. Then, for lunch, I had the eggplant and chicken on ciabatta with blue cheese spread. Yum!

Very simple and delicious recipe! We ate it on its own as a side dish but will try in a sandwich with the leftovers. Grilling the eggplant on the BBQ really adds nice flavor and shouldn't be ommitted, even in the middle of winter, it's worth it to go outside and BBQ it.

I have made this recipe many times and every time it's fantastic. We've eaten the eggplant straight out of the marinating tray and also on pizza. Delicious. With or without parsley, the marinade is top notch.

I really liked this recipe. Will no doubt make again. Served it the next day on a sandwich and melted some cheese on top.

As recommended by recipe used the eggplant in a sandwich with crusty, rustic bread, fresh mozzarella, prosciutto, and added tomato and light mayo. Yummy!

Wonderful! This was my first experience cooking with aubergines and it was so worth it! I deviated from the recipe as follows: No capers, so I upped the garlic to two large cloves to add flavour. I didn't have any peperoncini, so I used the pepper flakes. Oh, and I used 1 tsp oregano rather than 1/2 tsp. Delish. We took the suggestion of using them in a sandwich with crusty bread, mozzarella and prosciuto. You have to try it that way. AMAZING!

Hubby ate it and he hates eggplant. Need I say more? OK - I will - I thought the garlic was a bit overpowering, and I love garlic. Admittedly, I used two small garlic cloves rather than one medium one, but I was surprised at how garlicy it was. I still loved it, though. I would definitely make it again!

Wonderful dish! This was absolutely delicious. Everyone at the table agreed, and I'll be making this a lot for the rest of the summer. Very fresh tasting, great texture.

I made this pretty much as directed (proportions of a few things may have been off because I'm a guesstimator cook), but I made a large batch because I had a *huge* eggplant from my CSA. This was fabulous, quick, and simple. The eggplant texture holds up to the parsley and oil mixture, the flavor is fantastic and bright, and (even better) it keeps well in the fridge and I'm enjoying it a week later! As a bonus, the parsley mixture is also a fantastic chicken (and probably beef and fish) marinade. I marinated chicken breasts in it for about 15 minutes, then grilled and they were flavorful and tender. I'll definitely make this again!

I was looking for a quick way to use up eggplants from the garden. I was skeptical about grilling dry, but it really works. I served it to guests as hors d'oevres and got raves. I'm making it again tonight to serve over pasta with grilled italian sausages, basil, zucchini, sweet onions and tomatoes from the garden.

Surprisingly different than any eggplant I've had...but definitely in a great way! Loved the chewy texture the chef mentioned. Very tasty stuff! My regular eaters already insisted I make this often when I grill.

This was awesome.......the texture is perfectly chewy and he is right about saving some for a sandwhich next day! WOW! YUM! I added a bit more olive oil to the parsley mixture.
