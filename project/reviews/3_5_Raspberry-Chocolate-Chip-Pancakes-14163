Delicious! Followed the recipe exactly, and it was a winner -- one of the best pancake recipes that I've tried. That combination of chocolate and raspberry was just excellent. Would be perfect for a Valentine's Day treat for a chocolate lover. Great suggestion from an earlier reviewer to let the milk mixture cool prior to adding the chocolate chips. My only suggestion would be to double the recipe. It was just that great...no leftovers in our home.

Chocolate was a bit much, and yes, wait for the batter to cool, once they melt the cakes get dark. I used about a shot of Chambord instead of the fresh berries.

I used blueberries instead, yum! Be sure to let the milk-butter-egg mixture cool down before adding in the chocolate chips because mine melted!

These tasted good, but the chocolate was so overwhelming for breakfast that I won't make again. Too cloying and sweet. It's a matter of taste. The raspberries were good, but I'll keep searching for one that suits me.

...some people commented that these pancakes were too thin and the raspberries were out of scale. add some buttermilk-- thicker pancakes and richer too!

I love this recipe!! I have made a lot of different variations on it like apples and peanut butter chips in place of the raspberries and chocolate chips (the raspberries remain my favorite). My family loved it!

this was awesome I substituted dark-barry jam (chunky style) for the berries, and added trader joes dark chocolate chips... and added about 2tsp of sugar. these were some of the best pancakes I've ever had. also - I used (approx) 1/4Cup of butter MAX... only adding about a tablespoon per 3/4 pancake batch in the pan, which worked pretty well.

These were pretty good. Very thin and lacy cakes. I was concerned about the rasberries being too large, but it was fine. I used partially thawed frozen raspberries. I also substituted canola oil for the melted butter (I find it to be healthier, easier, less messy and makes little to no difference in the recipe) and added a touch of vanilla extract. If I were to make this again, I would lessen the amount of chocolate chips and up the amount of raspberries- my last pancake was full of chocolate chips and only chocolate chips... My BF who does not care for chocolate chip pancakes also liked these. They were okay, but I really perfer puffier pancakes.

Big hit with the over 6 crowd at my house. The little ones still prefer regular pancakes (that'll change!). I did not add any fruit just the chocolate chips.

I didn't make this with the rasberries, and I found it a little bland when I made the first batch, so I added a little sugar to the second batch and that lightened it nicely. This is a good basic pancake recipe.

YUMMY!!! Left out the berries and added 1 tsp vanilla. There was a fight for the last one!

This is so easy easy and so good. I have made mine with mini chocolate chips. I want to try sometime again when it is berry season with the raspberries.

Absolutely delicious. I used white chocolate chips instead of semisweet and my antique cast-iron pan (seasoned so it adds flavor).

Great with fresh Oregon berries! Just the right amount of chocolate to offset the berry flavor. Mocha Mix instead of milk worked well (dairy allergy). I added the egg and then the dry ingredients straight into the saucepan, first making sure not too hot. No bowls to clean! Will definitely make again and again.

Wow! My kids adore these pancakes and ask for them all the time. If you don't have raspberries, I have found blackberries work just as well. We are trying them with cherries today but are not sure how this will go. Highly recommended!

Absolutley delicious. I substituted a half a cup of graham flour and bananas instead of rasberries. Also, I used bittersweet Belgian chocolate chunks instead of chips. A good tip is to keep a plate in a warm oven to stack the cakes until ready to serve. The chocolate stays melty and delicious.

I made the recipe without the raspberries and chocolate chips and it was still delicious!

My husband just made these for Valentine's Day and they were amazing! Whenever I make pancakes with added fruit I get little pockets of uncooked batter around the fruit, but this was not the case here. I don't know if the superiority lies with my husband or the recipe, but whatever the case, I'm sure we'll have these again. I HOPE we'll have these again. :^)

I made this recipe quickly and it was incredible. I used chocolate chunks because I could not find chips, and the maybe would have increased the amount of raspberries, but I am not sure.

I made this for a friend of mine on her birthday, who's a 'chocoholic' and likes just about anything with chocolate in it. She loved this recipe and so did I! It has a very nice batter, well matched with the chocolate flavor.

Very easy to make, but use chocolate chunks or large morsels, not mini-chips. They melt to fast when you mix the milk and butter in. This is a breakfast "date" food.

Quick, easy and amazingly good. Was looking for a basic "Blueberry Pancake" recipe, and with over 60 cookbooks didn't find one that fit the bill. Saw this and had all the basic ingredients on hand. Substituted the Raspberries for Blueberries and chopped Semi-sweet baking squares for the chips. Wonderful and the estimated 45 minutes was about right.
