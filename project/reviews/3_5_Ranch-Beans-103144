So funny, as usual I didn't have alot of time at all so bought 2 cans of pinto beans, and sauted all the other ingredients, fried bacon etc, and added the beans to pan and 1/4 of a beer and redcued a bit, and they are really good! very spicy, but a great side. someday will have to try the actual recipe.

Awesome Recipe! We make it over and over again. I don't buy Chipotle Chili's. We roast our own jalapeño and use the charred skin and we leave some of the seeds for a tad extra heat. We can't get enough of them. I do let them cook all day in the slow cooker, after soaking the beans over night! YUMMY

Had in laws coming for a week or better. Needed something to slow cook for the day as I wasn't going to be home much to cook. Followed recipe Almost exact. Seems the canned chipotle is nit Gluten free and my mother in law HAS to have a gluten free diet. I was a bit nervous about the dark beer not usually a first choice , also was worried about the jalapeno's. Instead of canned chipotle chilies we roasted out own so we missed the canned in adobo sauce. But oh welllll what a hit. I made enough for 6-8 there were only 4 of us. Not a drop of leftovers. Everyone raved about it in between bitefuls. We served it with fresh gluten free corn bread a mix I bought from a little local bakery. Wow what a meal. Will definately make this one lots!

I used some lovely homemade chorizo in place of the bacon and the result was outstanding. I didn't find the beans overly soupy but I did cook tmen slowly for a longer period of time. These are amazing and a wonderful side dish to any southwestern/mexican entree.

No doubt they were very tasty. But guests were not impressed. Sigh.

EXCELLENT! definitely more "liquidy" than baked beans but if thats what yor looking for, these are awesome. used crock pot, chorizo and veg stock.

Try it with Chorizo instead of the bacon...gives it a less bean and bacon soup flavor, more oomph!

Made a lazy version of this. Soaked the beans overnight then threw everything into a crock pot. I omited the jalapeno but finished it with a cup of deli salsa (from Safeway) instead of the tomato & cilantro. A generous shot of bourbon (1/4 cup?) gave it a smooth, smoky taste. Absolutely delicious!

These beans are flavorful enough, but they are really for a side dish. You want them to not take over the dinner because whatever you're serving should takep top honors. These really go well as a filler and a good source of protein!!

I love these beans and so have my guests whenever I've served them. I make them when ever I want a southwestern flavor to the menu. A word to anyone at high altitude- you will have to cook them longer. Mash some with a potato masher to thicken them up.

Yuck!! The flavor of the beer was way too strong, and by the way, what juices? there were no juices left at the end of cooking and I followed the directions exactly. The whole thing was inedible and I had no choice but to throw it in the garbage. Let me also clarify that I know what ranch beans are -- was not expecting anything else, but these were a terrible version of what is usually a pleasant dish. Zero stars should be an option-- these were much worse than "just so-so".

Reading the reviews on this recipe, I was a little hesitant to make it, but it was exactly what my menu needed. I was highly impressed and can't wait to dig into the left overs. My guests loved them, they had lots of flavor (I used roasted vegetable stock for liquid). After they were done, I just put them in the oven on low to keep them warm, but it also did something to join all the flavors together. They went beautifully with the Pork Verde Enchiladas.

Okay...it must be a New Mexico thing...these are served as a standard side dish in ANY New Mexican resturant. They are not supposed to be sweet, thick, or have an explosion of flavor. They are supposed to help belay the heat from the chiles. They are supposed to be subtle. This is the best recipe I have found for these...MOST other recipes for are far, far plainer. As for the cojita...feta will do nicely as a substitute.

This dish was ok. After seeing the other reviewers comments about the liquid, I decided to add some cornmeal to thicken it up a bit......tasted beter.

I think that some people may expect a thicker sauce, but these are ranch beans, not barbecue beans. I did reserve about a cup of beans and cooked them down in the left-over liquid, then pureed. I placed the whole mixture in a gratin that I coated with lard, then roasted. I melted cheese (asadero) on top and garnished with chopped tomatoes and cilantro. Great Flavor!

I can't rate these, as I haven't made this version. However, adding 2 or 3 small sprigs of epazote, a dried Mexican herb, adds a little flavor and helps reduce flatulence. Add 2 or 3 bay leaves. Add 6 or more peeled, whole garlic cloves instead of chopped garlic and the jalapeno leave whole, too. I've read 2 different substitutes for cotija, a medium hard cheese: parmessan (which is harder than cotija) and greek feta (which is softer). I used all 3 with good results so your taste buds can determine which is best.

I have to agree with everyone else- I would have liked a thicker sauce for the beans. They were okay, but to me beans shouldn't depend on cheese to boost their flavor. I couldn't find cojita cheese- does anyone have a good substitute?

These were okay. I guess I was expecting something spectacular after waiting three hours. They were good, but it's easier to open a can of refried beans and achieve the same result.

This was not what I expected. With my limited experience of prepared beans I was expecting a thicker, richer sauce despite the ingredients and was nervous when the liquid remained broth-like. Nevertheless, this turned out well - and they ARE even better the second day. I made these with the Cheese Enchiladas in Green Sauce and the Quick Mexican Corn Risotto. Really too much cheese for one healthy meal (!) but very tasty.
