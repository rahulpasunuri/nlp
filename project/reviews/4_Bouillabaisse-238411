We used this recipe for our end of the season celebration on Martha's Vineyard. The Stock was so sweet and delicious with halibut just two hours out of water. The entire dish was fantastic with lobster, clams, mussels and halibut all from the island. My husband made one suggestion that made the dish even better - we served the croutons separately to use for dipping in the soup. We tried the croutons on the bottom of the soup but they got too soggy. Happy eating.

Now this is Bouillabaisse! I believe true Bouillabaisse does not emphasize a tomato dominated broth like Cioppino and Zuppa di Pesce. Don't get me wrong because they are good seafood stews as well. The true stars here are fresh (as can get) seafood, saffron, fennel and the rouille. I like the addition of the rouille and kept adding it to my bowl. It has a nice garlicky kick, but how much to add is personal taste. My rouille came out more like a soft paste. Some comments called it a sauce, but I am not sure the consistency matters once you add it to the Bouillabaisse broth and then stir it around. I used homemade shrimp stock made from head- on shrimp shells which probably gave it a bit richer flavor. I think this recipe is great for shrinking and expanding. You can also use the fish you can find readily and affordably available. The white fish should be firm though. By the way, it was great with Champagne because the de-emphasis of tomato reduces the acidity. One last point (as others have noted), add the course sea salt towards the end of cooking. Some of your seafood might come with some natural salt and the rouille will add some salt later.

I adjusted quantities for 2. I used the seafood that was fresh and available at Whole Foods: tilapia which worked well because it is firm and sweet, mussels, large clams, and large shrimp. I chopped up the fennel bulb and added it, which was a delicious complement to the other veggies in the stew. This was really delicious and remarkably quick and easy to make despite how impressive it looks on the table - making it again soon for guests!

Really excellent. Did not use lobster either, but did make the stock. I compared it with some stuff available from our local premium fish market, and there was no comparison. Worth the effort for sure. Also, did the traditional thing of separating out the fish after it cooks and serving it on the side. Gives a lot better control over how done it is. The roille is essential, not to be skipped.

Fantastic taste. Much better than other recipes I have tried or had in restaurants. For a less fishy taste make the white fish stock with 1 lb of cod fillets rather than fish heads and bones. Blend the solids and press through a strainer to get the final stock. This leaves a white fish mash which still has lots of flavor and makes a great dog or cat food addition to dried kibble.

This is so good! Didn't use lobster because of costs. The rouille makes this recipe so don't skip it.

I ran into several roadblocks shopping for this recipe. Living in Las Vegas, far from the sea, was the first. My local Whole Foods stopped carrying fish stock and I had not left myself time to prepare the stock myself, so I substituted 6 cups vegetable broth, 2 cups clam juice, 1 cup wine and juice from 1 lemon. Whole Foods was also out of clams, so I doubled the mussels and the shrimp. There was no fresh lobster to be found, so I substituted frozen lobster meat, which I thawed, and added with the shrimp. Since I was running behind, I also used Simply Potatoes and Muir Glen organic canned fireroasted tomatoes (2 cans). Even with all these changes and losing track of where I was in the recipe due to numerous interuptions,it was delicious. Even the picky fish eating guests went back for seconds. And my 15 year old son who hates soup filled three bowls. I'll definitely make this again!

Excellent dish! Made for New Years and it was definitely a hit. Rouille a must for this dish. Company worthy.

I have made this recipe many times. Of all the recipes for Bouillabaisse this one is my favorite. I substitute local available Seafood ( Lobster Tails, Red Snapper, Halibut and Cod). I eliminate the clams and the Rouille. I love the potato and saffron, which I feel really belongs in this dish.

This was perfect for a grey winter day. Used fresh seafood but substituted canned tomatoes with perfectly acceptable flavor. I added some fresh oregano and doubled the garlic, but kept the garlic out of the croutons and sprinkled with sea salt and herbs instead. Add a quick brush of truffle oil to the bread as well. Perfect!

I cheated and used a store bought fish stock; with the 1 1/2 TBS. of salt called for in the recipe, the stew was too salty. Next time I'll make the fish stock from scratch and 1/2 the salt. The rouille adds a nice complexity; adjust the cayenne to taste.

Tremendous, Simple enough- just my add to the recipe is 1/8cup of cognac and add calamari cleaned w tentacles. I used FL. lobster and grouper for the main "meats" the grouper head for the white stock --- fresh kill!!! Spear what you eat, Eat what you kill!!!

So so amazing. Don't don't don't miss the saffron or the rouille. Made mostly as directed with local striped bass, cod, flounder, Clams, lobster and shelled shrimp, forgot the mussels. Didn't have a food processor to make bread crumbs at the beach house where I made it, so the look of the rouille wasn't the prettiest, but the flavor was amazing. I bought the stock at a good local fish monger - who said it was made the same way as the recipe linked on here. It was outstanding! The best host gift dinner.

Superb recipe. Delicious flavors. Easy to make. Preparation may exceed 2 hours for inexperienced people making the recipe especially making the rouile. The rouile with fresh garlic mashed with the bread and cayenne pepper really completed the meal. It added great zest to the taste. Absolutely enjoyed the entree as did my quests who kept asking for more. Can be made as a fish soup without the shellfish and is equally as refreshing.

This recipe is very good and simple to make. I didn't have access to live lobster the day I made it so I used tails and added shellfish stock which worked perfectly. You MUST make the Rouille! The bouillabaisse would not have the rich, complex flavors that make it such a great dish without it. I'm making it tonight for my husband's guy's dinner and I know they will love it!

I have made the recipe several times, and this time, I reserved the lobster juice and added to the fish stock which I make using sea bass (prefer hailibut, but was not in season) and quahogs (hard shelled clams). The lobster juice did not add anything and may have detracted from the the delicate and sophisticated broth. If you want the flavor of lobster, after cooking the lobster and reserving the tail and claw meat, use the leg panels which can be removed by holding the body, and pushing down with the thumb of your opposite hand. In this way, the gut juice does not end up in the broth. When making the fish stock, which I recommend, I add one onion (quartered) to the quahogs, muussels and sea bass and generous amounts of black pepper. I reserve these fishes, and add at the very end of the simmer period (final minute). Be very careful with the Rouille, if you use to much it will overpower the other flavors in the broth, and make it taste like scampi...do not be afraid to double saffron, and increase fennel. Still one of my all time favorites!

Not only was this super easy to make but it tasted wonderful! I used Mussels, Clams, Cod, Scallops and Shrimp. I also used Vegetable Stock since I didn't have Fish Stock. I will definitely be making this again!!

We made this for Christmas dinner 2007 and plan on making it again this Christmas. It was wonderful.

This was an outstanding recipe! We did have to change some of the recipe (we used craw fish instead of lobster)but it was still amazing, and every picky person in the group enjoyed it. The saffron is a must here and I would also make extra croutons next time. I would pair it with a french rose or even sauvignon blanc from New Zealand..
