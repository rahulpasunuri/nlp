Loved this dish. I didn't soak the capers because I enjoy their saltiness, and I sauteed the eggplant rather than deep-fry. It was complex, delicious and extremely simple to prepare

This dish was good, but not fabulous. I added pine nuts and chopped artichoke hearts, which added texture and flavor and a little bit of red pepper. I think lemon may have helped, or maybe some sliced olives?

This can be modified in so many ways. Follow the shortcuts, jarred red pepper, saute the eggplant vice frying, also use italian themed veggies. I have used zuchini, artichokes, jerusalem 'chokes. Great recipe!

Very flavourful and summery! I skipped the gazillion laborious steps, didn't salt the eggplant or soak the capers ('fess up, people, how many of you actually did?), used roasted red peppers from the jar, and sauteed the eggplant instead of deep frying. I also used fresh oregano rather than marjoram. A delicious meal that took less than half an hour to make from start to finish.

I couldn't get my husband out of the kitchen because of the great smells. I sauted the eggplant and used differnt olives and capers and it came out great. Next time I will try pine nuts for an extra texture.

Wonderful flavors! I used a few different types of olives for variety. Definitely will make again.

I find that I rarely need to salt aubergine (eggplant) as the ones available for sale here in the UK have generally had the bitterness bred out of them. However, this is still a useful procedure if you're planning on frying the aubergine, because it will absorb less oil this way. I make a 5-minute version of this dish in which I cube and sautee the aubergine, before adding garlic, some chilli, capers, pine nuts, olives and a can of tomatoes. Different, but fast and delicious!

This is a very tasty pasta dish. Wonderful flavors of summer in a cold winter. I am not convinced that the same effect could not have been achieved by sauteeing the eggplant instead of deep frying (and therefore saving a lot of oil). I used a nice spaghetti instead of penne. The photo in the magazine showed it with spaghetti.

We made this recipe with some modification (no anchovies, different olives and capers) and it was still excellent. It is a little time consuming but I will definitely make it again.

Eggplants and bitterness, some tips: One hour of salting/draining is a little excessive. Half an hour is usually sufficient (read on!). Choose a male eggplant. They have less seeds and therefore are less bitter. They are identifiable by their lack of indentation at the base (compare several eggplants and notice the difference in appearance). Also, "Italian" eggplants, the smaller variety, tend to be less bitter and are often firmer. They also tend to be more expensive (but worth it!).
