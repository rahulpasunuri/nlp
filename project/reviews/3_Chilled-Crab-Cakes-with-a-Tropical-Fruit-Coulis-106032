I made this for a tropical-themed office party. It never made it to the office as I threw it out. Even though I followed the recipe, apparently my technique was off because it came out as a badly colored, watery mess. Even that wouldn't have stopped me if the taste was there, and it was not. This recipe cost me about $40 to throw out.

This is the first time I have tasted an Epicurious dish so bad. Pretty, but the taste was awful. Total waste of good crab meat.

I actually had a bite of this dish @ the Inn at Little Washington and by that I mean, my boyfriend ordered it and he "allowed" me a small morsel... It's incredible, very light and refreshing, highlighting the sweetness of the crab and the creaminess of the avocado and I can't believe I found the recipe for it on your website! Can't wait to try this @ home!

This was excellent! Light and refreshing (but very flavorful) served on a bed of greens. I substituted basil for the cilantro in both the crab mixture and the fruit coulis, which worked well. Since I didn't have PVC pipe pieces (!), I layered the cakes in ramekins and then inverted onto plates - a bit tricky, but worked fine. My only complaint is that I have LOTS of extra coulis. Any suggestions on what to do with it?
