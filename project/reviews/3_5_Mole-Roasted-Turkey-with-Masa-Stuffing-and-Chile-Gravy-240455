The turkey is delicious. Mole and turkey are a very happy pairing. I wouldn't make the dressing again. It is dry and unlike a tamale, it is dense despite the amount of butter. I wanted to like it but all I can say is it was edible.

Mexican Thanksgiving is an awesome idea! I made this for a group of friends, some who had already done the traditional Thanksgiving meal and others who hadn't had the chance. It was sweet because those who missed out still got their roast bird, and those who had eaten roast turkey the day before didn't feel they were eating the same meal at all. I did make one major variation: the recipe lost me at "Don't look for crispy skin...". Who wants to miss out on delicious roast chicken skin? So I made a plain roast chicken and served the mole sauce on the side. It's rich and complex enough that it really doesn't need to penetrate the meat to taste good. Now the leftover chicken is far easier to use up because I can flavour it with whatever I want. The flavour of the masa stuffing was good and went really well with the rest of the meal, but the dense texture was too filling, and the dry, crumbly leftovers are very unappetizing. A cornbread stuffing made with masa in the cornbread would probably be much better.

Not worth the effort. Unappetizing appearance and underwhelming flavors.

This was a disappointment. I did not find the turkey very appetizing. The sauce tasted "raw" and the masa dressing way too dense.

Loved this recipe. Made mole a day ahead (makes about 6-8 cups). It was fun to make, but takes some time. I put some of the mole under the skin too. I also cooked it in a bag, which was really easy!! The stuffing is delicious!!

I made this Turkey in a cooking bag to ensure the mole spices would penetrate meat. The white meat was as good as the dark!

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and it was easily the best turkey I have ever made. The gravy was actually pretty pointless though as the mole tasted so good.

I made this dish for a big dinner and was happy with the results. The mole took a while - 2 to 3 hours - but it was really fun to make and yielded a ton of mole. The white meat didn't take in the flavor of the marinade, although the dark meat did, and I would recommend putting the sauce underneath the skin. It made for a very fun and creative menu.
