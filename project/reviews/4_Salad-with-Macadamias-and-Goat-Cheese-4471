This was good. We don't care for avocados, maybe could use something else? Simple dressing.

OK - but not worth making again.

WOW! Absolutely tasty, gourmet and easy! I used the individual Boursin (Goat Cheese w/ Herbs) packets to save time. Will make again & again!! Can be an elegant side salad or a main salad for lunch

this is an excellent salad, made particularly mouth-watering with the addition of the avocado.

This was fine, but not as tasty as I was expecting. And I did use roasted, salted macadamias. I had to increase the nuts significantly to get all of the goat cheese covered. Make sure the goat cheese is well-chilled to facilitate slicing!

I made the recipe for a friend who really likes goats cheese (it was my first tasting). I used more nuts than called for and was delighted with the combinations and taste sensation - can't recommend it enough!!

Try this salad with the pancetta, dried cherry and port dressing also found on this website. (look under "goat cheese salad with pancetta, dried cherry and port dressing"). It is absolutely KILLER! Everyone rants and raves over this salad, it is always requested when I am having a dinner party.

As a novice cook this recipe was easy to follow and came out incredibly yummy. My boyfriend put it on the "A" list. Only trouble I had was when I fried the goat cheese rounds I don't think my pan was hot enough; the rounds started to lose shape before they were browned a little. Next time will make sure pan is hotter. Can anyone give any advice on this?

Great and simple. Only hard part is to get the avocado ripe at the correct time.

What a sinfully delicious salad! I'd highly recommend it and will definitely be making it again.

Yum! Very very good, and EASY. Doing the stuff with the cheese is the most "difficult" part, but as long as it's well-chilled, your fine. I served this 4 finicky people, and they all loved it. So did I!

This salad should be illegal! It is so good and so easy to make. What's not to like?? baby greens, goat cheese, avocado, and macadamia nuts. I taught my teen-age sons to make this salad. They will have to fight the women away when they get older.
