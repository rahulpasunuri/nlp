The dip is fabulous and I would make it again--with something else. I used twice as many clams as the recipe called for, and still felt like these fritters were just balls of fried dough--tasty fried dough, but not the clam fritters I was looking for.

I followed the recipe on these exactly -- and was quite disappointed. The recipe need more clams (as you couldn't taste them) in relation to the dough (or maybe my clams weren't pungent enough). Fresh corn would probably work better than frozen, to give a bit of texture. The cayenne also overpowers the clams. These came out tasting like doughballs. Also, the mixture would have benefitted from a little cornmeal. As for the dip, skip it. I will admit, the dip did improve the fritters -- but not enough to make me rave over them. The tang of the yogurt was a good compliment to the heat of the cayenne in the fritters. I'll make clam fritters again -- but just not this recipe.

My guests devoured this dish. The batter is quite stiff, so I formed larger fritters and cut them in half while frying. I think the dish would work better with an oriental dip.

Tried this with canned clams, 1 each minced and chopped. Don't bother. Next I tried 18 cherrystones, recipe wasn't large enough. Resolution is 18 quahogs and double everything else. Mince the fresh clams and blend all together. Next trick is to deep fry them outside in a round bottom wok, over a Morrone outdoor propane burner. Uses just a quart of vegetable oil. Used a Taylor candy/deep fry thermometer to regulate oil temperature. Tricky but it works. Worth the effort - everyone loved them. Nice and light too. A tip: to open fresh clams, soak them in warm tap water, change as needed, and the shells will open slightly. Makes shucking them a breeze.

Thanks Ken from Prescott, AZ. Tonkatsu sauce was a great idea. I didn't bother trying to make the dipping sauce. Great recipe!!!

Ignore the dip; Tonkatsu sauce is better! The fritters are great without any sauce. I did only minor substitutions (Bisquick for the flour/salt/soda; pepper sauce for cayenne). First time I used minimum oil (NOT 1"!!) and dusted w/ paprika to aid browning; second time I baked them for an even lower-fat meal.

Fabulous! No clams in the house, but scallops in the freezer. Used approx 12 large scallops, chopped (not too small) Also, no buttermilk in the house, so used light cream. Added some diced red pepper for color, a little more corn than was called for, and served with homemade tartar sauce!!!!!(yes, as you suspected, no cilantro in the house!!) Will make them again using every available seafood, and whatever else is in the fridge!!! Only question is... would buttermilk have made them a little more crispy on the outside???? Will definetly try buttermilk next time...... AND THERE WILL BE MANY "NEXT TIMES"!!! try these!
