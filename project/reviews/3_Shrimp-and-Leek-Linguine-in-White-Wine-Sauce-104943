Delicious, and a very nice change from tomato or cream based sauces. The pepperoncini are *essential* for cutting the sweetness of the leeks -- double the number (and double the garlic too). This even works with romano on top, unusually for a shellfish pasta. Capers are also a good idea. A keeper.

I love this dish because you can do so much with it if you want. I double up everything but the pasta so there is more flavor. I also love wine and garlic together so I also increase those amounts depending on the wine and how fresh the garlic is. Serve it with crusty bread and a green salad and a nice bottle of white wine and you have yourself a winner.

would not use this recipe again. lacked intense flavor. i added much more garlic and one chili pepper for a little spice. the heavy cream helped somewhat

Rating: 3
This tasted just okay until I added creme fraiche...then it was delicious! I also didn't have capers, so I substituted with chopped cornichon. I'll definitely make this dish again.

This was delicious. I made the following substitutions: dried oregano for fresh. shallots for leeks (didn't have on hand). added 3T heavy cream lemon zest for minced peel extra 1/4 C wine left out peperoncini It was delicious like this, just right.

This was all right. I followed the directions and was disappointed in the blandness. I thought the peperoncinis were completely wrong for this dish. I have far too many new recipes to try without trying to rework existing ones though I think this one could be better with some alterations.

You have to understand the origins of such a recipe - not that I have researched this recipe but it probably came from a region if Italy where the ingredients were readily available to create wonderful and creative dishes. Therefore prospective chefs trying this recipe must recognize and appreciate its flavour and thechique used in creating this wonderful dish.

I have been making this since this issue first came out. It is such a nice, light option to heavy pasta. I have an abundance of herbs in my garden, and fresh oregano and parsley make a big difference. The lemon juice and zest add to the fresh taste. I don't always use the entire amount called for the leeks, though. I also top off the pasta with grated parmesan. YUM!

i agree with the last three reviews. a bit more wine (for the dish & the chef!), and a bit of creativity (if you really know how to cook) and this is fantastic. sadly all i had was dried oregano but it still worked. TWO TIPS: taste it as it cooks and add flavor accordingly and YOU CAN NEVER COOK LEEKS ENOUGH. if you dont like leeks dont make this, it's a leek and shrimp dish. i upped the wine a tad, added capers at the near end, and also added some peas for an touch of sweet to this very savory dish. very green but very good.

This is a staple in our house. We make it a couple of times a month. Fresh herbs make a difference. Greek Oregano slightly better than Italian Oregano. We're making it again tonight for guests arriving late at our lake house in MD. Just get all the prep work done and it practically makes itself. Throw in some drained and rinsed capers for additional flavor and some fire roasted red peppers for color. Fresh flat leaf Italian parsley is a must for flavor plus color. My husband eats the leftovers cold as a snack and I'll microwave it at work the next day for lunch. If this recipe doesn't turn out for you, you must have done something incorrectly. I've never had it fail. Oh, don't overcook the shrimp. Four forks for sure.

Consider the rating 3.5. The ONLY thing i would change here is cut the lemon...but for others (like my wife) it may be just right. I did add some Zatarain's Shrimp Boil to give it a little kick...oh yeah, and we're garlic freaks. While i'm on the subject...i read over MANY reviews on this just to get a feel. All y'all that hated or didn't like this because it was too bland or too much this or too much that...take this into consideration for ANY recipe you get- IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, IT'S YOUR FAULT. YOU ARE THE COOK, MAKE IT GOOD. People who blame these recipes because "it was terrible" or whatever. Or won't make them again...eat out, cooking may not be your thing. These recipes are a trail map, those who stay on the path don't get to take in all the scenery. STOP WHINING AND MAKE GOOD FOOD!!! Sure, your entitled to your opinion, but you need to realize, you're only criticizing yourself.

I thought this recipe was great, but it needs some help. It was even better the next day after sitting. I followed pretty much everything the same as the recipe except I added more wine. But I thought next time I would add a tangy cheese and perhaps some capers. You have to like leeks and lemons to like this recipe. The shrimp were flavorful and delicious. This recipe has potential.

My wife loves this recipe. I now use a lobster base for my sauce and save the time/trouble of making the shrimp stock. Easy to make, very tasty, feeds a bunch.

We really enjoyed this dish, I have varied it by adding just a few sliced olives or capers.

My husband and I really love this dish! I have made it twice and both times I left out the pepperocini and added extra leeks and lots of fresh ground pepper. I also used large shrimp instead of small, and fettucine rather than linguine. It's lots of work, but definitely worth it.

If I make this dish again I will use much less of the leeks overall it was just ok

The shrimp came out very nicely, but I wouldn't describe the sauce as very compelling, especially given the amount of time it requires in prep work.

Very nice, flavorful dish! My husband doesn't like very spicy food, but he loved this. I think it would be better with more shrimp per serving.

The only thing I would change is to use about half the amount of leeks--otherwise I thought the dish was delicious. I used slightly less peperocini and it was just right for my taste.

This recipe is very similar to my favourite Italian restaurant's! I didn't follow the recipe to the letter, but I do think that the lemon & juice adds the zing I've tried to recreate. Yipee!

I thought this was terrible. I like spicy foods, but I would not describe this as spicy. The pepperocini lost their taste and the leeks were overwhelming. Perhaps a real leek lover might like this, but last night I ate my salad, enjoyed my French bread, and wished I had saved that 1/4 cup wine. I would have enjoyed it much more in my glass....

I used a little more wine. The pepperoncini gives it a real zip. If you don't like a real hot dish, don't put in as much of the pepperoncini as it calls for.

Our family loves this recipe! One of our sons is allergic to dairy, so this sauce is a nice reprive from the heavy tomato sauces. A little more garlic and lemon is delightful!

I turned this recipe into an elegant main dish. I used large shrimp or prawns as we call them down here. Add cooked fresh spinach to the vegetable mixture. Also used peeled and finely sliced red bell pepper instead of the peperoncini. Then served the shrimp stacked on the vegetable mixture and spooned over the reduced liquid. Omitted the pasta. Looked great and tasted sensational.

In getting through my list of recipes to try from all my back issues of Bon Appetit, I finally made this dish last night. It was really tasty; nice and light with the flavor and zest of lemon. I can't imagine the oregano (one must use fresh) being overpowering, as another reviewer suggested. We found the pepperoncini to add just the right amount of tang. Simple and light - will make it again.

Rating: 4
I have made this twice and will continue to do so. I omit the pepperoncini and substitute green onions for the leeks, since the plebeian grocery stores in my area don't always have leeks. I find the shrimp broth step time consuming but well worth the effort. I also add a little grated Parmesan at the end and serve with crusty bread. Yum!

My guests were thoroughly impressed! Just the right amount of spice to this unique dish

I followed the basic recipe with two minor additions. I added several chopped up slices of prosciutto and sliced mushrooms to the heated garlic and leeks. The prosciutto added a little saltiness and the mushrooms absorbed some of the lemon flavor. Not only would I make this dish again but I also e-mailed the recipe to my son because it was so easy.

After the positive reviews, I was very, very disappointed--it was a waste of nice shrimp. The dish was bland and, at the same time, it was overpowered by the oregano. But even taking into account the fact that the amount of oregano can be adjusted, it just didn?t work. It was one of the rare times that my very sweet husband admitted that he didn?t like the dish and, more to the point, that it was not worth attempting to fix it up in the future. Definitely won?t be making this one again. I agree with the reviewer from Vermont , however, that boiling shrimp shells is a great idea.

Delicious and easy recipe. Have made it several times now. I use large U15-size shrimp, skip the shrimp broth step and use home made chicken stock (1 cup). Added 6 ounces of thinly sliced Portabellini mushrooms when the leeks and peppers go in. The peppers add quite a kick, so if you don't like things too spicy you may want to decrease a bit for your taste. I too used fresh grated Parmesan-Reggiano over the top. Took this for a tailgate dinner last night. It was a hit! You only need 8 ounces of dried Linguine to serve 4...Thanks for another terrific shrimp recipe Bon Appetit!

Fantastic recipe, however, guard the shrimp shells from helpful loved ones...my boyfriend discarded them in an attempt to 'clean up' and I had to retrieve them from the garbage..but it stil came out great! One reccomendation: add some grated parmesian or romano on finished pasta.....mmmmmmm

Started laughing when I saw the review questions about peperoncini's. I had no idea what they where either and looked them up in yahoo. My husband, who is Italian, knew exactly what they were. We loved this pasta recipe and I am making it again this week.

Peperoncini is a small pickled pepper. It looks like a banana pepper & can be found in the pickle section of just about any grocery store.

Thanks-- now, any idea where I can buy them? Do they sell them at the local grocery store, or must I travel to Little Italy to find them?

Anybody out there? What is peperoncini?

We loved this dish! I did make a few changes to the original recipe. I reduced the shrimp to a half pound and added a half pound of sea scallops. Having read the previous reviews of this dish I decided to add a little butter while sauteing the leeks this added the flavor I believe that others felt the dish lacked. I too thought the pepperoncinis were an odd addition but again having read the previous reviews I went with them and they added a little heat that was a great addition. The leftovers really were the best part!!

The first time I made this I used shrimp (large) and it was great! Last night I planned on making it again but discovered too late I had no shrimp in the freezer. I did have boneless chicken breasts which I sliced thinly and used in it's place. I followed the directions except used vegetable broth for the added liquid. My husband loved it and so did I. We are always looking for different pasta dishes without having to use red sauce. This Bon Appetit issue has several which I've tried, so far so good. Oh yes, I added some sliced mushrooms.

We love leeks and this was an interesting recipe to try. It was so so but improved during the meal. It was vastly improved as the flavors blended for a leftover lunch. Don't know how to overcome this blending problem except be sure to make enough for leftovers.

This was excellent. The only change that I made was to use large shrimp(16-20 p/lb.). The pepperocini, although a seemingly odd ingredient for a shrimp and pasta dish, added a nice additional dimension to the flavor and was not overly hot. Enjoy...

Delicious. Followed the recipe exactly. At first I thought the pepperoncinis were kind of an odd ingredient, but they really added a lot of flavor to the dish.
