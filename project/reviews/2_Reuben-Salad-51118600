Thank you for your response, A Cook from nyc. "I find the photo unappetizing" is much more courteous (and informative!) than "looks gross." Thank you for the clarification. I can understand you seeing the ingredients and knowing you would not care for the flavors together (I guess you don't care for the flavors of reuben sandwiches). What irritates me is when people post a "review" that is not a review. You are, of course, entitled to your opinion, but "reviews" like yours are much like writing and publishing a review of a movie you haven't seen but you disliked the poster, or a review of a book's contents based solely on your dislike of the color of the spine and the font used in the title. Keep cooking, and I look forward to real reviews from you in the future.

"What, are you in junior high? How did it taste? I am assuming you made it, and you wouldn't review something you hadn't even tried......." Yes, A Cook, actually I am 14 years old and a very competent cook. I don't need to taste something to know I would not like it. An in my opinion, the photo looks unappetizing (do you like that word better?).

For the folks looking for rye berries...if you're having trouble finding them in the health food or bulk sections, try online at bobsredmill.com. I'm lucky enough to live nearby (they're located in Milwaukie, Oregon), and I've gotten them before. I'm going to make this for the Halloween potluck at work...sounds delicious!

To the reviewer who wondered where to get rye berries I would suggest a health food store or a bulk foods store. I have made salads with both rye berries and wheat berries they have a nutty flavour. You can also use them as a base for other salads of this type with a vinegarette base. Croutons would Not work in this recipe.

I don't know where you get rye berries but alternative is to make croutons out of rye bread. Sounds excellent and will try.

"Sounds yucky, looks gross"? What, are you in junior high? How did it taste? I am assuming you made it, and you wouldn't review something you hadn't even tried...
