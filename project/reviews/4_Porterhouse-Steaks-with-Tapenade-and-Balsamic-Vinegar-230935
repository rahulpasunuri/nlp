Surprisingly excellent--got rave reviews from my red-meat averse family. Made these with mere sirloin strip steaks. Make yer own tapenade: put in processor 20 pitted kalamata olives, 1 tsp lemon juice, 1 tbsp. olive oil, garlic, 1-1/2 tbsp. capers, a couple of basil leaves if you have 'em, and (in my case) about 1 tbsp of fish sauce to substitute for anchovies (since I didn't feel like shelling out for anchovies I'd just have around in the fridge collecting mold since I'd never use them for anything else). You can add the rosemary here right into the processor after you've made the consistency for tapenade. Doing it that way makes this about a 5 minute weekday meal prep miracle.

This sounds too simple to be good, but the flavors are fantastic. It's one of my favorite treats to myself.

This was easy, the flavors were great and the balsamic reduction added just the right touch. Will also try with filets instead of the steaks.

Easy to make. I bought 1 1/4-inch-thick T-bones and followed the recipe. The steaks turned out really tasty, I just had to adjust the oven time because the steaks were thinner. I served it with couscous and sautee mushrooms. Will make it again.

Really nice recipe and quite versatile...did not have porterhouse steaks so used regular steak cuts. Have cooked in the oven as described and on the grill in foil. Delicious flavors both times.

Was easy and delicious. Be careful not to overcook if you use a thinner cut of meat.
