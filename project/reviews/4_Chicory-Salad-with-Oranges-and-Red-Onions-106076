I made this using walla walla onions, which was really good - I also made it with the red onions, which added some colour. The dressing is fabulous and the oranges are inspired - it is worth the time to cut the pith off. Also I used mixed baby organic greens instead of chichory, and that worked fine too! Goes very well with the whole meal in this issue of Gourmet.
