The recipe was delicious! However, the recipe instructions are very poorly written and hard to follow. (4 forks for flavor with modifications, 3 forks as written) A couple of tips: - If you're new to chopping pumpkin, make sure you have a very heavy/sharp chef's knife and cut it like you're cutting a cantaloupe (this step takes forever) - I also tripled the vegetable stock because the pan was too dry with just the recommend amount - I used 5 basil leaves and found that amount to be adequate - If you don't have thai chilies, you can substitute serano peppers

I loved this! Steamed the pumpkin in the oven, easier to get the flesh out than peeling. And added some fish sauce at the end, really helped the flavor!

this recipe is great, just a little time consuming with cutting up the pumpkin. We had to smash it on the ground to get to the inside! Anyway, I think it would be great with squash also, and the sauce would be good for any other type of stir fry. I also added some raw scallions as a topping- yummy!

Definitely enjoyed the flavor of this recipe. The only thing that got me is I couldn't decide what a "handful" of basil should look like. In the end I added a whole pack (2/3 ounce) of Thai basil which I think overwhelmed the other flavors a bit, so next time I won't use quite as much.

Just finished eating this dish and found it absolutely delicious. I used butternut squash because pumpkin is out of season right now and it tasted great. I highly recommend pairing with Mahi Mahi and coconut sauce main course. As mentioned, definitely add the basil and chilies!

Flavors were great. Do not under any circumstance forget the basil - it made the dish. I used regular basil and it worked just fine. The chilies also added great flavor, although leave them out if you don't like spicy food. I followed the recipe exactly, although my pumpkin wouldn't get soft so I had to cover the pan to steam it. By the time the pumpkin was done, the onions were a deep caramelized brown. Yummy.

We really enjoyed this recipe. It was easy (besides peeling the pumpkin) and so delicious! I wasn't able to find Thai basil, but the basil I used served the purpose just fine. Also, we like spicy foods, so I left the chile seeds in - SO GOOD!

Such a great autumn recipe. We used a sugar pumpkin which was a good choice. We added spice with fresh Wisconsin-grown serrano pepper with local honey mixed with the soy for the sauce.

I don't see how this could be bland with 3 hot red chili peppers and 4 handfuls of fresh basil. I used thai finger peppers and it was hot as blazes. The sweetness of the oyster sauce and honey conterbalanced the spiciness nicely.

I thought it tasted a little bland; I added more vegetable stock than the recipe because the pumpkin kept sticking...

I was roasting pumpkin for homemade puree and used the roasted flesh for this dish. So I sauteed onions & garlic, then added pumpkin and deglazed pan with chicken stock (out of veggie) The flavor is AMAZING and my family loved it. Who knew?? I will definitely make this again.

Wow! Great flavor. We belong to a CSA so we have squash and pumpkin coming out our ears. My husband is not a squash fan but he really loved this dish. I was suprised how quickly the pumpkin cook. Will make again.
