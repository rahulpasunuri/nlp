This recipe is excellent. You'll definitely want a nice baguette on hand because the sauce is incredible. One thing I'd add, though, is the juice from one lemon. It was conspicuously missing the first time I made it, and made it perfect when I added it the second time. I also think that 5 minutes is a long time to boil the mussels when you're first cooking them, and would just watch for them to open, especially since you add them to the heat again at the end.

I don't want to share this recipe it's too good. I had the same cream curdling experience the first time, it's the way it's written. Cook wine well, turn down heat, whisk in cream slowly. I would not sub the leeks, but do double the broth, and I find shaved fennel a nice addition, add with the leeks.

Another excellent dish. Doubling the sauce is required since sopping up the elixir with French bread is like dessert. The leek is an important ingredient; makes it authentic and to me, tastes better than onion. Like the reviewer from New Orleans, we used Champagne; it was French and we poured it in our flutes; great with the meal.

Wonderful. Took the advice of cooking the peppers and leek with some garlic and butter prior to following the recipe, and it was a great suggestion. Doubled up all the ingredients and we almost licked our bowls clean. This is my new staple mussel dish.

Excellent! I followed one if the reviewers suggestions and sauteed the vegetables in butter and doubled the Permod. We will definitely make his one again.

Excellent and unique way to prepare mussels. The sauce is so good I would double it next time. Added roasted garlic and sauted it, the leeks and the red pepper in a little butter and olive oil till they were soft. Added a few flakes of red pepper too. Then I added champagne (had no white wine around!)and the mussels. Once they were cooked I added the Pernod-- doubling the amount -- let it burn off a little before adding the cream. Simply SPECTACULAR.

Easy, delicious and authentic. Forgiven too. No leek? Just substitute with onion (very finely chopped) or shallot. Don't want to buy 1 red bell pepper only to use 1/4C? Skip it! We make it whenever we have great breads at hand. The broth is to die for.

This recipe is excellent if you use clams instead of mussels! Mussels have to much of an ocean taste (salt water/fishy). Clams are have a much milder taste and the pernod sets them off beautifully. Add slightly more pernod and you will find you'll lick your bowl clean with bread!

Possibly the rave reviews were a set-up for disappointment. This was good, but not excellent. Not a keeper for me.

Made this for the annual Beaujolais Noveau dinner. So very easy but impressive to the taste buds. This is a keeper.

This is my favourite recipe for mussles. I go to it every time I want to impress my guests. And the ingredients are so easy I take a look at the recipe before they get here and then put it together as if from pure inspiration!

This recipe is wonderful and so simple. An alternative to Pernod is Ouzo...same flavor but less expensive. The sauce is also great over linguine.

To the person that had her sauce curdle... whenever you cook with any type of alcohol, you need to cook off some of the alcohol before you add the cream... only add about a tablespoon of cream to see if it will curdle... then add the rest slowly. It can happen with any alcohol, not just sambuca or pernod or even vermouth. :-)

I really enjoyed this recipe, however my husband did not like it al all. He is not a big mussel fan but will usually eat and try anything.

Delicious! The pernod (pastis) added a flavourful and savory taste. One of the best mussel recipies I've ever tried. I will definitely make this again!

I read the review about using Sambucca instead of Pernod. I did that and it ruined the entire recipe. The sauce curdled. DO NOT USE SAMBUCCA instead of Pernod! I was so upset. I want to try it again but I WILL NOT use SAMBUCCA.

Fantastic. My boyfriend wasn't so sure about having mussels, but this recipe was a huge hit with both of us. super easy and very tasty.

This was delicious. I used Sambuca instead of Pernod and put the mussels and sauce over fresh fettucine and it turned out great. It was very easy and quick to prepare.

Enjoyed this dish and found it straight forward and quick to prepare. Rather than return the mussels to the sauce, I added back just the accumulated juices. Then served the sauce, strained, in large soup bowls, dipping the mussels and pieces of French bread in the sauce.

I did it friday night as an appetizer, we love it. Saturday, my husband went to the grocery store to buy more mussels and ask me to do it again. Twice we enjoy it. easy and delicious.
