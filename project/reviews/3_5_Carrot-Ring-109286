This is a keeper. I sometimes bake this in mini cake or muffin pans for a different presentation. Makes a tasty and unique side dish.

Not too sweet, just the right amount of spice - This is a great versatile dish! Can be served warm and baked in muffin pans as a side or add cream cheese frosting and serve dessert!

I made this for a brunch and it was fabulous! Does anyone know if it would be OK to substitute soy butter for margarine?

What I like about this recipe is how you can play with it. Make it as is and it's wonderful! However, you can substitute spelt for wheat flour, and/or add lots of ginger, and/or make it with 1/2 carrot 1/2 zucchini, give and take on spices as you please...it still works.

This recipe was one of my mother's favorites. She served it as a side dish with poultry and added cooked peas and pearl onions in the middle of the ring. This made a lovely presentation. HOw nice to see this old favorite recipe revived again!

This was incredibly easy (I threw it together at the last minute just before dinner)! While it's definitely not a traditional carrot cake, it made a wonderful dessert for a simple dinner. It's definitely best warm, but wasn't bad as leftovers. My kids suggested that it should be served with lemon curd, so I made some to go with the leftovers the next day. Even our chef friend liked it. Next time I'll make the lemon curd to go with it warm---yummmmmm. I might increase the lemon in the cake just slightly too, but it really doesn't need any changes. One word of caution: I used a teflon bundt pan, and the cake fell apart when I took it out--it's very moist and tender, so use caution!
