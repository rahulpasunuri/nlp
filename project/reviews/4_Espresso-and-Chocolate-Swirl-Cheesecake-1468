This cheesecake is so amazing!! I made it at Thanksgiving for out of town guests and now every time we are together they say, "Hey, remeber that amazing cheesecake you made?" Make this! You and your guests will be so glad you did.

I made this for a work function and it was devoured. Great recipe. After reading a few reviews I decided to modify baking directions from another cheesecake recipe I had. I baked the cheesecake at 350F in a water bath for 1hr 10min, and the consistency was perfect. Also I suggest gradually adding the coffee/espresso mix to the cheesecake batter, tasting as you go, this gives you better control of the overall flavor.

This is amazing cheesecake! I made it for a coworkers birthday and it was a huge hit. I'm not sure why the others reviewers felt it necessary to dilute the chocolate swirls with the cheese mixture. I love that part. My swirls did not get too hard in the fridge. I did swirl extensively. There were no clumps so that might make a differnce. I baked it at 400 for 44 minutes because I was worried about it not setting up but it did. It looked just like described with puffy slightly cracked edges and a golden top. Go ahead and add all the coffee. I made it with a homemade oreo crust. Fabulous!

I've been making this cheesecake for many years now and it never disappoints. Everyone loves it! The only change I make is adding about a cup or a little more of the cheese mixture to the melted chocolate. Then swirl it in to the rest of the espresso cheese part. I find it melds better with the whole cake that way. I never add the coffee grounds because I find the coffee flavor to be strong enough and since I'm always raiding the left overs in the evening, I want to be able to go to sleep after that!

Fabulous recipe! One modification: Did not add the coffee grounds. The expresso gave enough flavor for me. I also made a gluten free, crustless version, but cooked in a small crock, same water bath, same time and temp. Came out perfect! Add whipped cream. Very rich dessert!

I have made this cheesecake both as directed and also adding some batter to the chocolate. Raves for both ways, but I prefer without batter in the chocolate. Yes, the chocolate is hard, but I appreaciate the high contrast between chocolate and coffee.

Tried this recipe using fat free cream cheese and was surprised that it turned out great!!! Otherwise followed all instructions as written and it turned out perfectly. We froze most of it since there was only two of us and pulled out pieces over the next few months and it still tasted great.

Outrageously decadent and delicious. Perfect for the coffee/chocolate lover. I followed the recipe but baked it at 350 for 50 minutes. Topped it with fresh whipped cream whipped with powdered sugar and kahula and dusted with cocoa powder. Only caution is to serve it to a large group or you will eat it all!

The first tome i made this cheesecake i fell asleep in front of the oven. It burned but my family of 4 still devoured it within a day. Best chesecake ever.

I've been making this for years...I guess since 1991. Perfect for a holiday party, if only because if you make it without lots of people to help finish it off, you'll find yourself returning to the fridge at least 5 times a day. Yum!

I loved this cheesecake! The combination of espresso, chocolate and cream cheese is perfect. I baked it at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes. Came out looking beautiful. I was leery of putting in coffee grounds, but it was great!

The flavor of this cheesecake was great, but as stated in other reviews, the cake did not set when baked at 400 degrees for 40 minutes. The center part of the cake was a pudding consistensy, although the top was golden brown. Next time I will lower the temperature to 350 degrees and bake longer.

absolutely delicious. i found that the chocolate swirls were a bit too firm, even after the cake came to room temperature. it could be that i just didn't swirl them in enough, but i like the contrast of a mouthfull of chocolate next to the creamy cheesecake, so i think next time i will try adding slightly more cream so it doesn't get as hard. also, be very careful not to over bake. when you pull it out of the oven, you'll probably think that there is no way that it will firm up, but it does, even when it comes out looking too soft.

I need to try this recipe again, as my cheesecake was seriously overcooked at 400 degrees for 40 minutes. I will try lower temp next time. The batter tasted so good I was disappointed in the results.

Awesome recipie, I subed cocoa for the coffee cause I just didnt have the instant stuff, came out great actually made 3 cheesecakes. I did a short cut and bought the oreo crust. Everyone raved said it was the best cheesecake they've ever had.

Sensational! This cheesecake was my very first and was devoured in under 5 minutes. I substituted ginger snaps for chocolate wafers in the crust to give it some spice. The cake cracked rather badly, so I made a quick dark chocolate ganache for the top, which pushed this cheesecake from excellent to decadent. A must try!

Wonderful flavor combination and beautiful presentaion. Made for husband's study group potluck. I followed a few suggestions from previous reviewers and sub'd 1T. espresso powder for gr. coffee beans, added 1T. of cinnamon, mixed some cheese batter in w/ the chocolate, and baked in water bath @ 350F for 1 hour. Would have preferred it to be smoother and creamier. I believe that my mistake was over baking since I did use convection and should have reduced baking time by apprx. 15 minutes. Will know how it was received by tasters tonite.

I made the recipe exactly as stated. I took it out when still soft in the center. I expected it to contiue to firm up. It didn't. Also, the ganache chocolate becomes very hard int he fridge. Next time I will double the cream in the ganache so it will be softer and will bake a little longer. The coffee flavour is terrific.

Ahh. A chocolate-coffee lovers dream. Had a boyfriend make this for me years ago. He is long gone, but this glorious cheesecake lives and rears it's head at family functions! This is a rich, bad-for-you cheesecake in all its glory. Fix it exactly as written and enjoy! Wrap the bottom with foil so all of the butter doesn't ruin the bottom of your oven.

Great coffee flavor, I skiped the coffee grounds and added another TBS of espresso. Much smoother texture also I used a water bath and baked it at 350 for 1 hour. It came out wonderful next time I'll try a oreo crust.

I made this for a holiday party and it was a big hit. Very rich, though, so it goes a long way. I used chocolate grahams for the crust and added the chocolate glaze from another recipe. Turned out beautifully. There were two desserts offered at the party, and this one was wiped clean.

I made this for a Thanksgiving get together. Not difficult to make. Had a hard time finding Nabisco Famous chocolate wafers, eventually found them at publix and they made for a great crust. I've made many cheesecakes and was surprised by the directions stating "cake will not be set" after baking for 40". It was not set in the middle after baking so I followed the directions and removed from oven thinking it would solidify somewhat over time. The next day when I cut it, the middle was still mush. This was somewhat embarrassing, thank God I made other desserts. I do not understand this direction. My instinct was to leave it in until done but the top was already a deep golden brown. Input from someone who has made this cheesecake would greatly be appreciated. The outer half was wonderful to eat. Great coffee flavor but not too sweet and had a lighter texture than other cheesecakes I've made. Will make again but won't take it out of oven until it's set.

This recipe is better than any cheesecake I have ever had in any great italian restaurant. I was originally making it for my father, a confirmed coffee and chocolate hound, but ended up falling in love with it myself! Definitely better on the second day, and I would take the advice of mixing in a little of the cheesecake filling with the chocolate swirl since it does get kind of tough to cut when refrigerated. Otherwise, an amazing cheesecake!!!

Just wanted to add another rave to the chorus below. I made this for our Superbowl party. One guest e-mailed me the moment he got home to say that it was so good, it was in his top 5 of all time! I added the chocolate glaze from the other recipe, just to throw out all discipline. Super!

Every time I make this recipe for a party I get rave reviews. Even people who don't like coffee love it. A friend got two marriage proposals when she made it.

This cake would have been better with slightly less baking time. The chocolate wafer crust burned slightly and the top cracked a bit also. Still the taste was good. However, the "Cafe con Leche with Chocolate" cheesecake recipe is MUCH better tasting and impressive looking and has the same coffee/chocolate flavors!

This is one of the most delicous desserts I have ever put into my mouth. I used flavored coffee beans (chocolate praline) and ground them fine at the market. I too glazed the top with a chocolate glaze. This is to die for!

I have been making this cake since it appeared in BA. It is a truly sensational combination of tastes with maximum mouth feel. Swoon. I am a personal chef/caterer in Boston so I actually serve this cake often. Never to a disappointed audience. It is really superlative. It also is so rich that it serves very many people. I think the recipe talks about 10 servings, but it actually serves many more due to its rich elements. Please use the Medaglia d'oro instant espresso - it's part of the incredible richness of the coffee taste. Also, I believe that even though I make everything from scratch, "Famous" chocolate wafers cannot be beat. I am somewhat embarrassed by this admission, because it does not fit with my profile. But they are really good. Don't recreate the wheel by doing your own. And try this thoroughly wonderful rich and creamy cake. It's amazing.

I have made this cheesecake many times to rave reviews from family and friends. My husband who fancies himself as quite an expert loves it! I varied the recipe a few times by adding a top layer of whipped cream tinted with espresso powder and sprinkling the top with cinnamon, cocoa powder and sugar. Since it looks like a giant latte, we call it "Latte Pavoratti". I won a local cheesecake contest for this version!

I added the glaze from the Double-Chocolate Cheesecake recipe, and heard nothing but praise. This is definitely one to bowl over even the non-cheesecake fanatics.

Really delicious and easy. I too used intstant coffee,chocolate grahams and added a little bit of filling mixture to the melted chocolate. Also, I added about a tablespoon of cinnamon to the filling to give it a cappucino-like taste. Definitely a saver - I think it would be an excellent finale to an Italian-themed dinner.

Yum! I loved it, and so did my friend. She refused to share her piece with anyone. I used regular instant coffee, however, and for the regular coffee, I used a suisse mocha flavored coffee. Very tasty.

I'm just learning to cook and decided to make this cheesecake for a family party. Everyone was so impressed and thought I bought it! I didn't use the espresso powder but it still tasted fine. The coffee and chocolate really balanced the cheese flavor- even those who don't usually like cheesecake loved this one. I'll definitely be making it again!

This easy recipe was a big hit. I followed the suggestion of mixing cheesecake with the chocolate, plus I piped a cream cheese frosting around the edges and dusted it with cocoa for aesthetics. My friends couldn't believe I made it from scratch! It looked and tasted wonderful.

The cheesecake was wonderful. However I did add 1/3 cup cream AND 1 Tbsp. of the batter to the chocolate mixture to soften it up. It cut perfectly. This is definately a make again recipe.

The expresso taste in this cheesecake is wonderful, but the chocolate hardens when refrigerated. Next time I make it, I will add some of the filling to the chocolate to make it creamier in the cake.

I make a lot of cheesecakes to take to parties, and I'm used to getting good reviews. I just found this recipe on the website a few days ago, and decided to give it a try for a New Year's Day party where there were a number of serious cheesecake lovers. It was a smash hit! Everybody went nuts over it! I've already made plans to make it again.

This is one of the best cheesecake recipies I have had. It has just the right amount of coffee flavor and a great chocolate taste. And super rich. Not too difficult, but very impressive. I made it once for my boyfriend's birthday at his grandmother's house. Now when we go visit her, she asks me to make it.
