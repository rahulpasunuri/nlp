I'm no idiot but I couldn't figure out the instructions for the artichokes at all. I've never prepared fresh artichokes before so found this very confusing. The two forks are for the delicious sauce over foraging chicken eggs. If that were the only component of the recipe, I would have given in 5 forks.

I love this idea! I cheated by having artichokes the night before and then using the leftover chokes for the bottoms the next morning. That way, you can just make the sauce and the eggs. (I'm not a morning person) I would serve this with sourdough toast.

For the work that goes into the artichoke bottoms, I can not say I think they are worth it. But the sauce is amazing! We now use it as a quick go to sauce for everything including plain old eggs benedict.

Amazingly subtle combination of flavors. This may sound like a white wine dish, yet you can complement it with a massive red such as a great zinfandel or petite syrah. Also, make sure you use real artichokes--the frozen type don't retain anywhere near the flavor needed to make this dish complete. The prep and cooking process is not that hard at all. If fresh porcini mushrooms are not available, they can be replaced with dried porcini mushrooms that have been rehydrated. Their stronger taste and mustier aroma mixes even better with the truffle oil, which as another reviewer noted has to be of the highest quality.

THE food critic from Lake Worth, FL. To eat food this good should be a crime against God. I don't know who created it, but they are welcome to my table anytime. I would never buy articokes already made because it is worth it to clean them out yourself. I also used a egg from my own pet chicken but the supermarket variety would work o.k. I used the truffle cream sauce to eat the rest of the vegetable and will make this dish for anyone that comes over my house. Do yourself a favor and don't use the phoney oil, real truffle oil is what makes it good.

I must have made too many dishes with artichokes because I did not even try to make these artichoke bottoms. Yes it makes a nice presentation but with your fingers bleeding and all the choice words you will have trying to create such a thing is not worth it. BUY ARTICHOKE BOTTOMS! I was looking for some other alternatives to use with my nice new egg poacher and this was a very good addition to the eggs benedict. I overcooked my egg yokes a bit on the first batch. I made 5 of these and there were none left with people asking for more, so I know this hit the spot. I added some chives to the eggs is about the ony change I made. Go hunting for the porcini mushrooms if they are not in your local grocery, they do make a difference.

Delightful dish. Loved it. A LOT OF WORK! Second time around I used frozen artichoke bottoms. Worked just as well without all the labor. Great for a Sunday Morning Special!
