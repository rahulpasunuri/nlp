These were very good, but there's a couple things I'd do differently next time. I'll buy 2 pkgs of pie crust to use the next time - the crust didn't take the handling & rerolling very well. If you have to, borrow a 2nd muffin pan so you don't have to wash it in between. Get the cookies out of the pan quickly - my guess is the unsatisfied commenter left them in to cool. Last - these would go great with a glass of champagne!

These were excellent. They are now a regular on my Christmas cookie tray. I had no trouble getting them out. They stayed beautifully formed. I just sprayed the tins as the directions called for.

I really liked this recipe and it was definitely a winner. I did make some basic changes: I used butter not spray to coat the tins, then to be super safe I lined the tin with waxed paper. When I put the wax paper in the tins I let tails extend above so that when I removed the cookie I just lifted it out by the tails, and could also gently pull the waxed paper away with the tails. Your could use tiny muffin cups,but I prefer the cookie without the paper muffin cup. This is a keeper with endless possiblities.

When I first saw the list of ingredients, I immediately decided to make this recipe. However, I was not expecting to have to eat these cookies out of the muffin tins with a spoon! The dough stuck (even though I used non-stick spray)and so did the coconut mixture. Everyone loved the flavor, but I am not the kind of cook who gives a group of people a muffin tin and a couple of spoons and says "chow down".
