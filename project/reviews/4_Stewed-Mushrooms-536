Delicious recipe, but I think the instructions are written poorly. I used 3 T flour and added this to the butter to make a roux, cooking it until dark golden brown. Then I whisked in the broth, then wine, and rest of ingredients. I think the order is very important, as well as adding the ingredients slowly while whisking to prevent clumping. This also took about 2 hours to fully reduce. I uncovered the pot and turned up the heat at the end, and the resulting sauce was DELICIOUS. Will definitely make again, since it's so easy once it's covered and simmering.

Made and served a double recipe of this dish for a birthday party. Everyone loved the mushrooms. Only reason it rates 3 forks is because I had to adjust. Needs at least twice as much worcestershire sauce and a decent amount of salt and pepper to have good flavor. Also, cooked in a slow cooker which worked well. I suggest following recipe and then add additional worcestershire sauce to taste. Overall, it was a hit.

Rich and luscious, the worcestershire sauce makes it taste almost meaty. Easy to prepare, excellent reheated.

F.Y.I. to strict vegetarians, Worcestershire sauce has anchovies in it.

Delicious! Followed the recipe with the exception of not having any Worcestershire sauce on hand. I ended up serving this over slices of sourdough baguette that had melted Gruyere cheese on it. Next time I will try serving this over egg noodles or potatoes.

I added some cream to this, didn't reduce as much (I had a hard time reducing so I improvised) and made Cream of Mushroom soup -- delicious!

Nice and easy. Tried it with toast; was pretty impressed. Would make a great appetizer with spooned on a fresh baguette, wtih melted gruyere on top.

Made the recipe as given (using shitake, oyster & baby bella mushrooms) except for the time. It took several hours to reduce the liquid to the consistency I wanted. The extended time greatly improved the texture and taste of the dish. Took it to a New Year's Eve supper to go with steak, baked potatoes & salad. Very easy. Very tasty. I will make it again.

I used beer in place of wine. It definately needs more flour, it didn't thicken with only 1 tablespoon of flour. I also added a few sprigs of rosemary because it definitely needs some herbs besides parsley. I made these the night before a potluck and put them in a crockpot and the flavor got even better the next afternoon.

This was a great dish, I made this and served them with ribeye roast and mashed potatoes. I double the recipe since I was cooking for 30 people. They raved this more that the meat. I did not have vegetable broth so I used chicken broth and I used 2 1/2 tablespoons of flour since there was definately a lot of liquid. It took me almost 2 hours to reduce it, but this is by far the best mushroom gravy.

A lovely companion for most meats; easy to prepare and sophisticated. I used 4 different kinds of fresh mushrooms and cut them into chunks. The recipe does not specify whether to leave them whole or cut up. I would add an extra tablespoon (or 2) of flour however, as there is a good deal of cooking liquid involved. This would be a nice buffet dish as well.

I served this with really good prime rib, and the mushrooms got more comments than the beef. Delicious, and the gravy is a wonderful compliment to beef. I didn't make any changes, the recipe didn't require any. So easy and so good.

Wow! These were great mushrooms! Made this to serve with the blue-cheese-crusted steaks and it was terrific.

I make this quite often during the winter months and whenever I want gravy. Really great over rice. The only thing I do differently is quarter large mushrooms and halve medium ones to make them more managable and then it cooks faster.

This is a heavenly recipe! I made it but used organic beef broth, and a variety of fresh golden type mushrooms.... There were absolutely no leftovers here! It is great as a soup served with warm crusty French bread and butter. MMMMMMMM!

This dish was very good. I did cook the mushrooms a little longer than suggested because I wanted a reduced, thick sauce. I served it as a side with roast; it would be wonderful with steak.
