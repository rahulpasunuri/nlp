I really enjoyed the flavors but next time I will make a few changes in the process. All the pepper settled to the bottom of the half and half and ended up heavy on the potatoes that got the last of it poured over them. I would salt and pepper the layers directly rather than putting it in the liquid. Cooking at 400F there was some curdling of the half and half. I would make a roux based sauce with the half and half and cheese. I would say I'm quite likely to make again with those couple changes.

It would have been *really* nice if the author of this recipe had stated what size baking dish was needed in terms of volume (2 quart? 3 quart?) instead of a "deep-dish glass pie dish" (what is that anyway?). I had to try three baking dishes before I got one that everything would fit into.

Excellent! I liked the corn, gave it a great taste. Used only 1/2 of the poblano, otherwise too spicy hot.

Poblanos, cheese, potato and corn with a creamy texture all together is a winner. The poblanos give the dish a nice deep smoky flavor without being "hot and spicy." Being from the southwest, this would be a great addition to our Thanksgiving or Christmas table rather than the traditional mashed potatoes. Love it.

Very, very tasty. I too had trouble with the cooking time, however. I don't have a Mandoline but felt I had cut the potatoes to the appropriate width. We had a late dinner, but it was worth the wait.

This was fantastic, we both went back for seconds! I made a few minor adjustments but I followed the recipe for the most part. I roasted the poblano peppers instead of sauteing them and then I used the frozen "roasted corn" from trader joes which gave it a really nice smoky flavor. I couldn't find the Oaxaca cheese so I used a mixture of mexican blend shredded cheese and gruyere. I thought the cooking times were accurate, I think the trick is to use the mandolin to cut the potatoes super thin. I even took it out 5 minutes early since the cheese was brown and it was cooked all the way through. This is a keeper!

Simple and delicious. A new dish to add to our stable of comfort food delights. Like many of the reviewers, I had to increase the cook time for this dish. Served with a side salad and glass of wine. Looking forward to making this again and experimenting with a few other variations on the recipe.

I fiddled w/ this recipe a bit so I was sure to have plenty for a dinner party for 10. I used 4 Hatch chilies (another mild, large chile), 3 lbs. of potatoes (used a mandoline to cut 'em), a whole bag (maybe 3 cups?) of frozen, roasted corn (Trader Joe's), about 3 cups of Jack cheese (the woman at the Bristol Farms cheese counter suggested this as a substitute since they didn't have Oaxaca/Asadero), 2 cups of half & half and 3 Tbs. flour. I followed the layering part of the recipe but used a glass 9x13" dish. I baked it for about 65 minutes and let it sit for maybe 20. It was delicious! Everybody raved about it and there was PLENTY. Next time I'll use 2 1/4 lbs. and modify accordingly.

If you decide to be trendy and do it in a cast iron, you must preheat said cast iron at temperature for at least 30 minutes, or your potatoes will be undercooked. I found you needed to cook these at 425 for at least 40 minutes before uncovering them, potatoes are a fickle mistress...

Simple, delicious and beautiful presentation.

This was so good. Since fresh corn is in season and cheap right now I used 3 ears of corn which I blanched for 30 seconds instead of frozen. I also roasted the poblanos. I used a mandolin to slice the potatoes, it was not quite done after the recommended baking time so I gave it another 10 minutes before resting it for another 15, it came out perfect. This is a great recipe to play with and makes a nice side for a Mexican or southwest meal .

We loved this..works beautifully as written with the Oaxaca. A mandoline makes this a breeze, and fun, too.

This is a great interesting recipe. I recommend adding twice as much cheese and throw in whatever spices suites your fancy. Adding extra cheese might sound too heavy for some of you, but a cup just did not seem like enough. What may have triggered that is that I went with a less expensive Monterrey Jack cheese. I would LOVE to try this with the cheese the recipe specifies, but maybe when my budget is bigger! :) I also added some spices - 1/4t each of oregano, cumin, red pepper flakes and garlic powder. I served it with a reheated rotisserie chicken - sound blasphemous considering what this recipe was paired with in the magazine - but we were short on time and energy with my whole house being sick. This is going into my permanent comfort food collection!

I have a recurring problem with potato gratins, in which the potatoes stay crunchy and the sauce stays runny. This is probably my fault, but I parboiled the potatoes and used a little roux to thicken the milk up, just in case. It took about 10 minutes to bake, and the results were really good -- a nice variant on your usual gratin. Served with the Caramelized Chipotle Chicken from elsewhere on this site, an accompaniment I recommend.

Great comfort food. It could be a meal in it's self with a side salad. Made it to go with the Chiptole Roast Chicken Tacos but it would be great with any grilled or roasted meat. No problem getting it done in the time indicated in the recipe (sliced the potatoes in my Cuisinart using the 4mm blade)

I made this recipe exactly as written, and the cooking time was roughly correct for my dish, though it sat a little longer than 10 minutes before serving. I loved the texture contrasts (creamy, crunchy, soft) and the slight bitter note of the chiles with the sweet potatoes and the sweet corn. We ate it as a vegetarian main with salad and avocados. Next time, I will add some garlic to the cream, I think, and might experiment with a different cheese. Overall - really, really good. Will make again!

Very easy to make and a great result. Like others I'd like to add a bit more corn next time. Potatoes cooked very nicely - I think the key is making sure they are thin enough.

We loved this recipe. My children could even eat this, because the corn, cheese, and half and half balanced the heat of the peppers. Potatoes were perfectly cooked.

I'm amazed to see reviews saying that the cooking time listed was accurate. Perhaps I need to get my fancy new oven's temperature checked, but this thing has been baking for over an hour and a half at 400F and the potatoes are still raw in the center. Followed the recipe to a tee, including weighing out ingredients and using a mandolin to slice the potatoes. Can't really comment on taste because it was not ready in time for the meal. Highly disappointing.

Roasted the poblanos & added sautéed leeks to the layers. Used 1/2 whipping cream & 1/2 cup low sodium chicken broth. "Best potatoes gratin ever" from my husband

I and all my guests loved this. Next time (and there will be a next time) I will add more poblano peppers. I added more corn than the receipt called for. Really a lovely dish.

Like a relleno in casserole form -- Yum! Only as hot as the pepper you use. We made it with oaxaca, don't know if mozzarella would really be the same. Used a mandoline for the potato as we usually do for gratin so it took about exactly the time it suggests to cook.

Anyone else recoginze this as a rip-off of a Gourmet recipe?http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/reviews/Poblano-Potato-Gratin-350596 But besides that, it was really good! I added almost double the amount of corn and chiles, and used fresh mozzarella and finely grated asiago. Everyone at the party loved it!

Easy to make. Next time, I'd include more corn and poblanos. Served alongside Southwestern Lime Chicken with Ancho Chili Sauce (from July 1998 Bon Appetit).

Yum! My whole family loved this, even the 4-year-old. It's the perfect comfort food, and easy to make as well. Heed the instructions for 1/8-in. potato slices; some of mine were thicker and not quite done.
