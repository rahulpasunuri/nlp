Looks impressive but tastes a bit boring. I was not thrilled with the pancakes at all, and I am a huge masa harina fan. Perhaps if they were to be spiked with some cumin and chilies they would be more exciting. The dough was very very stiff and hard to spread on the frying pan. I would try them again with more liquid and spices. Oh, and make sure to keep your chorizo in a much cooler oven than 250F or it will dry out.

This is one of our favorite breakfasts! I use chipotle in adobo, add a TBL or so of the adobo to the salsa, and serve it warm. Below is the recipe from this site, which seems to have gone away: CHIPOTLE RANCHERA SALSA 3 TBL corn oil, 2-1.2 C thin sliced onions, 4 minced garlic cloves,1-28oz can diced tomatoes, 3 TBL minced jalepeno, 2 tsp chopped canned chipotle. Heat oil, saute onion, then garlic, then chilies. Add tomatoes, simmer 15 minutes. Puree half the mix, combine all with cilantro, S&P to taste.

These are delicious and versatile enough to go with many toppings: toasted pecans and blueberries, or shrimp and avocado. I beat the egg whites separately and folded them in last to make the pancakes extra fluffy.

Phew! Very filling. My pancakes seemed more "dense and corny" than "light and fluffy", as claimed in the header. It tasted like Huevos Rancheros.

I made this for my Guatemalan boyfriend and he practically finished it before I could lift up my own fork. Truly superb.

i loved the recipe as is, and have also found that the masa pancakes are really awesome with fresh blueberries, obviously leaving out the eggs and ranchera sauce.

I made it exactly as written, and we thought it was very good. Lots of different flavors and a decent balance. It might benefit from a bit more variety in texture.

Great dish. Masa pancakes easier to make with non-stick, quality better and thinner. The Chipotle Ranchera salsa makes the dish. We made the night before and set it out to warm to room temperature. Made a nice presentation. Full-flavored and not as heavy a breakfast as we anticipated. At first glance, this look labor intensive but it is not.

Quite delicious; however, I missed the cornmeal item, so when my batter was prepared, it was not very thick so I just kept adding more masa until it was nice and thick. My pancakes were still delicious and fluffy, maybe even more than with the cornmeal, but I love masa, so it could just be me. I have a favorite jarred chipotle salso I used to save time. Also, I had one pancake left over - it reheated quite well and was tasty with a fried egg topper as well.

I loved this recipe. I'm glad I had masa that I needed to use- or I would have used corn tortillas, and missed out on the pancakes. Believe me - a tortilla could not compare. A word of caution with chipotle chilis - they can overwhelm a dish. Don't use too much.

My salsa looked liked something from Denny's in the pan (I was skeptical). I pureed the whole thing in the blender and it was really very chunky still. When assembled it's so impressive and really really yummy. The toasted masa pancakes add a nice layer of flavor, only use corn tortillas in a pinch.

This is one of those meals that is relatively easy to prepare yet looks very impressive. This dish is not only delicious, but the recipe is easy to follow and the salsa is outstanding!

to the reviewer below, the recipe for the salsa (when you hit the link) calls for 2 tsp of the canned type of chipotle peppers. it is the 2nd to last ingredient on the list.

I served this at a family brunch and everyone loved it. I had one problem---The Chipotle Salsa didn't call for any Chipotle peppers. Did I miss something?

I made this verbatum the first time and my family loved it. Since, I've made the salsa, but used corn tortillas. There are Mexican food stores here, in San Diego, that sell fresh, terrific corn tortillas.

I left the oil out of the pancakes and increased the sugar to 1/4 cup. I also took a shortcut and used Herdez salsa. It turned out great and was a hit with everyone. A really creative dish fit for company. Thanks Epicurious for another great recipe!

Delicious and very filling. The Chipotle Salsa has great flavor and a real kick to it. Resist the temptation to increase the chipotles unless you like your salsa burning hot. Both pancakes and salsa freeze well.
