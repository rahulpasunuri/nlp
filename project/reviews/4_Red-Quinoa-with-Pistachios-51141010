I really loved this but I'm not putting a rating to it because I made some adjustments. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken, toasted pine nuts instead of pistachios, and basil instead of parsley and mint. It turned out to be really great and I'm happy to have found this recipe as I was getting tired of the boring old white quinoa pilaf style I've been making.

While I love the flavor, versatility and healthfulness of quinoa, I have reduced my consumption down to once or at most twice a month. The reason is that this dietary mainstay of the Bolivian, Colombian and Peruvian mountain people has become too expensive (because of growing first world demand)for them to afford it. There is growing hunger due to the sudden increased cost of quinoa and the lack of other food crops suited to their mountainous region

Hmmm, don't know how to contact the source of this recipe but someone needs to correct or revise the instructions. How do you add the quinoa twice? My take on this oversight is that the word 'in', as in 'stir in' is not appropriate. Otherwise, sounds like a quick and simple way to enjoy some good grain. Take out the 'in' and were good to go. Just sayin'.

I made this recipe with red quinoa and toasted the pistachios. I did use basil instead of the parley (as it is not a favorite of either my husband or myself) and kept the mint for freshness. Likewise, I added Meyer lemon. I served it with Dover sole and a Persian cucumber salad that had a touch of dill and some of the Meyer lemon zest and juice. It was an all around delicious meal. Definite make again.

I served this tasty quinoa with salmon and an asian cucumber salad for a tasty meal. Instead of using parsley and mint, I substituted cilantro. I also opted for roasted and salted shelled pistachios. Before serving I tossed in a little extra virgin olive oil.

Prepared this dish as part of the BA 2013 Food Lovers Cleanse. It was an excellent simple way to prepare quinoa. I used regular white quinoa since it is what we had one hand. Loved the beautiful colors in the dish and the multitude of flavors. This is definitely a keeper. The "menu" for the challenge had this paired with Cod but could see this with any kind of fish or chicken,
