Too bland. Would have marinated it first in ginger and garlic. Like the deglazing idea to get the bits o' sesame seeds from the plan. Wine or balsamic would be good. I actually tasted one, too bland, so I put it on a bed of arugula and tossed with fresh grated ginger, a bit of sesame oil and rice vinegar. It was just ok. I'd need to modify this like crazy to keep it.

added tablespoon of butter to olive oil when searing scallops; recommend using half as much salt and twice as much sesame seeds; deglazed pan with balsamic vinegar and poured sauce over scallops. very good!

I thought this dish was great for a quick but tasty dinner. I too had problems with the sesame seeds falling off during the cooking process, but I followed the advice of another reviewer and added about a 1/4 cup of white wine (as well as about a tablespooon of butter) to the pan after removing the scallops and it produced a delicious sauce. The accompanying pea and mint couscous was wonderful! My husband, who doesn't like seafood or peas, thoroughly enjoyed it! Would serve to guests.

I give this recipe 3 and 3/4 stars. The recipe written as is can be too salty so I made some adjustments. This first adjustment I made was I used my lemon lime margarita salt in place of the sea salt and that was really good. Then I had a brain storm and used Japanese furikake instead of the sesame mixture. For those who haven't heard of furikake it is a sesame seed seasoning that is used as a condiment for rice. The one I used had sesame seed, nori strips, sugar, and a little salt. I seared as directed and served with seaweed salad for a light lunch and it was fantastic. So fast and so easy will make again.

I would give this three and a half forks. Quick, easy and delicious. My electric stove makes "moderately high heat" difficult to evaluate and control. About half of the sesame seeds fell off in cooking. The seeds did not get golden enough on 8, and got too dark on 9. Two minutes per side plus rest time on oven warmed serving plates while the Snow Pea and Sesame Rice Pilaf was plated made for perfect doneness. The scallops were large 1 1/2" - 2" diameter. I will only use 1 1/4 tsp salt next time. I substituted Snow Pea and Sesame Rice Pilaf (this web site) for Pea and Mint Coussous and it worked well.

This was very easy to prepare, and tasted delicious. I made it with the pea and mint couscous and the whole thing made a beautiful presentation. Fast enough for week nights, but pretty enough for guests.

Simple and excellent. Added 1/4 cup of white wine to the pan after we removed the scallops for an excellent sauce. Mushroom risotto and sauteed green beans with garlic and red pepper rounded out a fantastic meal.

WHOA! i used sea salt (the recipe does call for coarse salt), and it was WAYYY too salty! also, my husband and i thought they were a bit bland - probably would benefit from a bit of chili oil. My husband said, "This one isn't a keeper."

I dried scallops thoroughly but couldn't get sesame seeds to stick to it. Sesame that managed to stick fell off during cooking. Seeds popped all over the place. Seeds in pan burning. I had to clean the pan twice. Too salty. Tried dipping in egg and then seed - same problem. Maybe there is a better way to make seeds stick. I tried turning with several utensils including a skewer but it didn't help. I tried pretoasted seeds and raw seeds to no avail. Dish has potential.

I made this for dinner tonight as a treat for my wife, who loves scallops. She loved it. I thought it was wonderful too, even though I am not a scallop fan. The dish is easy, quick, and delicious. I recommend it.

I love sesame, and I'm fond of scallops, so I had some hopes for this recipe. But it really wasn't that good. My wife found the sesame too overwhelming for the scallops.

We really enjoyed this dish, I even used frozen large scallops, it is a very quick but elegant dish.

Despite the poor reviews, I made this one and loved it! I used a little less salt though. One warning...this thing really SPATTERS when you add the scallops, so beware!

Looks great, but a nothing receipe. The sesame seeds make it look good, but adds nothing taste wise. I took Keith Tillery's advice and added parmesean cheese and a few dashes of tobasco, which was very good. That changes the receipe completly, so this one goes in the trash can.

This looks really pretty, and because I'm on Atkins I served it on a bed of the Sesame Coleslaw instead of the pea/rice thing. But much too salty, and the scallops didn't make me say "mmmm" like they usually do. It needs something...

I used butter and olive oil instead of veggie oil and I think I could have heated to a bit higher temp and/or increased cooking time to 5 or 6 minutes. Otherwise, the flavor was great, and because scallops undercook so nicely, they were succulent. Upon serving, I topped them with some freshly grated parmesean cheese and a few dashes of tobasco! Along with some fresh nuked crisp-tender broccoli, and a glass (or two) of white wine, I know I'll perfect this one!
