This is the easiest recipe ever--i used a pre-made pie crust for it, cause i don't work well with pastry. It's such a big hit with friends and fam. i switch the cheeses up, love it with a tangy goat cheese! just make sure to drain the spinach all the way :)

Rating: 4
I had to sub a few ingredients..goat cheese instead of real cheese and hemp milk for the half/half. The rest i cooked as directed as is and it came out so good i even surprised myself! I think I may add some mushrooms next time, it would mix well with the taste of this dish.

I can't tell you how many times I get complimented on this dish and how many requests I get for the recipe! Following other reviewer suggestions- I use 4 eggs instead of 3. Love to add browned sausage, sauteed red peppers and mushrooms as well. I usually use Marie Callendar's frozen pie crust to make it even easier! The combination options are endless- will have to follow the more recent suggested cheese options!

This is a good quiche recipe, but I have a suggestion.... After lots of experience making quiches with puff pastry, it is very important to use a metal or silicone pan! Glass is a poor choice as the bottom will not cook properly and be soft and revolting.

I agree with other reviewers that this is a solid 3+ fork recipe, but gets the 4th for ease. I also made a few changes. First, my DH brought home spreadable cream cheese instead of regular, which tasted fine, but it wouldn't blend. I broke out the immersion blender and that fixed that problem. I did add an extra egg and used more like 3/4 cup of 1/2&1/2. I also used swiss instead of cheddar. The best change I made, though, was to sauté a carton of chopped mushrooms with some red onion and about 4 cloves of garlic. Mixed it all in, baked as directed, and it was light, fluffy, and delicious, not at all as dense as a classic quiche. This is totally going into the rotation. Yum.

I just made this last night, and thought it turned out well. The crust did stick to the bottom of the pan a bit, and the edges browned a bit too much. Next time I make it, I will lightly grease the pie pan and brush the edges of the crust with beaten egg. I looked at the puffpastry.com site for ideas and found a recipe for puff pastry cooked in a springform pan. In that recipe they recommend lightly greasing the pan. I used fontina and parmesan, but next time might try Fontina and Gruyere as others have recommended.

Family favourite for breakfast or quick weeknight meal. I keep spinach and puff pastry in the freezer and always have cheese and eggs. Have made it exactly as the recipe states and now tweak it by sauteing onions and garlic and adding spinach with some cayenne. Quite often I omit cream cheese, change the egg quantity to 6 and use 1/4 cup skim milk, 1 cup cheddar, 1/4 parmesan. Have used emmental and swiss instead of cheddar and fiddleheads or asparagus with or without the spinach. It really depends on what's in my fridge. Great way to get greens into my 8 year old! Hard recipe to screw up.

Very easy, very good. All the kids liked it. I loaded up on the spinach, served with fruit salad.

I made this for brunch; everyone loved it and it was super easy and quick. I used half of a bag of fresh, wilted baby spinach, 4 eggs and 1/2 cup of light cream (I couldn't find half and half). I also added 1 clove of garlic and used mixed shredded italian cheeses instead of cheddar. I served it side-by-side with the blueberry-mango-ginger fruit salad also on this site and some cherry tomatoes with garlic, basil and olive oil. This is my new go-to brunch menu.

Rating: 3
Terrific quiche. I took advantage of many other reviews and wilted one bag of baby spinach and then chopped it up. I used smoked gruyere instead of cheddar. Any cheese combinations would be great and the addition of mushrooms, onions, garlic, red pepper, etc are all great ideas. Enjoyed the ease of the puffed pastry crust. Like another reviewer, I will keep some handy in my freezer from now on.

Rating: 4
This was great, and SO easy. The first time I made it as written, and since then have modified it using fresh spinach, mushrooms, shallots, gruyere. The variations are limitless. The puff pastry really makes it. This will be a regular dish in my household.

Rating: 4
My family really liked this quiche though I modified it a bit by doubling the half & half, using 4 oz. of fresh baby spinach, crumbled bacon, and an additional two eggs because it just wasn't covering the spinach. I was very happy with the results and happy to add something to my repertoire of recipes.

Rating: 2
I forgot to mention, the crust wasn't cooked through on the bottom, either, which I don't care for. None of the reviews I saw mentioned this so wanted to add that note. On regular-crust quiche, I usually pre-bake the crust for a bit, but didn't think that would work with puff pastry.

Rating: 2
We didn't really like this. I usually make the arugula & bacon quiche on this site, sometimes substituting spinach, but I didn't have any gruyere cheese and had everything needed here, so I thought this would work. The reviews were so good I was hopeful, but the result was mediocre, even following some suggestions (added bacon, fresh spinach wilted, extra egg, bit more cream). It was the cheese combination I didn't care for, and, as a couple others mentioned, too much spinach. My son usually loves my quiche, but he didn't like it, either, and neither did my cheese-loving girls. Try the other recipe I mentioned!

This was absolutely delicious! Like others I added and extra egg and an extra 1/3 cup half and half to fill out the dish more. Also, I substituted red onion for the green onion which I sauteed with half a red bell pepper - just to give the dish more color. Not only did it taste great, it also looked beautiful once the puff pastry was fully puffed. Will definitely make again and try with different ingredients.

Oops! I forgot to add to my previous review that I DID add 1 extra egg to my recipe - and, to save time, I used pre-cooked bacon (crumbled). It turned out perfect!

This recipe is more of a 3 fork rating (for being so delicious), but I had to give credit for how EASY it was to make - due to the use of puff pastry -so FOUR forks it is! I had to substitute milk+butter for the half/half, and it did not suffer for it! I topped it with sliced grape tomatoes - delicious! The only thing I might suggest is to wipe just a tiny amount of butter around the edges of your baking dish - the pastry edge does stick a bit. Tip: this recipe can be altered to make individual servings using a muffin pan! This is now a family favorite!

I LOVED this recipe! My mom used to make tons of quiches and fritattas, and I liked this one the best that I made. The cream cheese was great in it, and I used 1/4 of a red onion instead of green onions, since that's all I had. I'm going to try adding some rosemary or other herbs to the pastry before baking next time to see what that does. yum.

Rating: 4
This is one of my favorite reicpes from this site, and I've made it many times and many variations. As others have said, the original recipe does not fill a 9" pan, so I increase cream cheese to 4 oz, eggs to 4 plus an extra white, and cream to 2/3 cup. I've also subbed low fat cream cheese and milk for the cream with success. A great idea for entertaining - bake quiche in a foil pan which has been sprayed with cooking spray. Cool for 15 minutes or so, then cut pan away with kitchen shears and slide quiche onto a serving platter. This allows for beautiful presentation and easy slicing/serving. I've also made this a day or two ahead and re-heated at 325 for 30 - 40 min, covered loosely with foil.

Rating: 3
The quiche was good, but I felt that it was more like a baked spinach pie (too much spinach), so I added a 4th jumbo egg. Still, I thought that the concentration of the spinach was a little too high. The egg/cheese flavors were almost lost. It's a great dish, and I'll definitely make it again, but next time, I'm cutting the spinach in half.

Rating: 4
This was fantastic! I wilted 10 oz. of fresh baby spinach instead of using frozen, I used 4 eggs, and I added an extra 1/4 cup of parmesan. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. My husband requested that we add this to his "favorite box"!

Rating: 3
Great recipe! I added some prociutto I had laying around as well. I put the filling into a regular pie shell and that was just as tasty. To supasexy, I think you could mix the filling up the night before and keep it in the fridge, then pour the filling into the shell in the morning right before you throw it in the oven. Otherwise, the filling might make the bottom crust soggy.

I was running late the day I made this and started putting it together 15 minutes before my guest arrived for lunch.

Even the atheists would say, "Thank God!" I admit, I used this recipe for inspiration to create my own. But what I did tastes so incredible I could almost faint. Here's my version: Instead of puff pastry, I used store-bought pie crust--the filling is rich enough. I used a hand blender to puree about 2/3 cup of 2% milk, 4 or 5 eggs, 10 oz. thawed chopped spinach, 1 chopped shallot, 1/4 tsp. salt and a few turns of a pepper mill. After this was pureed, I grated 7oz (1 wheel/package) of a buttery French goat cheese called Le Chevrot into the bowl. Before grating, I sliced off the outer rind (I'm not a rind person). The cheese is pungently flavoured, but not overpoweringly tangy like many other goat cheeses. It is also harder than most goat cheese so it actually is gratable. Then I stirred the mixture, poured it into the pan and let it bake. I used the recommended baking time/temperature settings and it came out perfectly. I am now ready to die of happiness. :)

Absolutely loved it! First time making a quiche, but this will definitely be a staple in my house from now on. Used 4 eggs and 2/3 of half & half instead of what the recipe called for. Also used one 10oz. bag of baby spinach steamed in the microwave for 2 minutes then drained really well instead of two frozen packages. Added about a half a cup of diced canadian bacon, too. Although mine took about 15 minutes longer to cook than the recommended time it turned out UNFREAKIN' BELIEVEABLE!!!

I like this a lot. I used fat free half and half and thought it was delish. I found it easy and most things are already on hand. The kiddies didn't like it too much but sadly for them, it's going into the rotation. It's much to easy and delicious to pass on.

As a person who enjoys elaborate and challenging recipes made completely from scratch, I was floored by how delicious this quick and simple recipe was. Granted, I used fresh spinach (2 6 oz. bags, as other reviews suggested) wilted with about 1/3 of a yellow onion, sauteed (only b/c the grocery store ran out of green onions. Yes, I couldn't believe it, either). Also following other reviewers' recommendations, I used 4 eggs and 2/3 cup of cream -- perfect! Next time I'll try it with homemade pastry crust, but the puff pastry works well, too.

I've made this a couple of times. The first time the crust was OK, the second time it was very soggy, probably due to my weird Swedish oven that I'm not used to, though. I prefer the texture of a more custardy quiche. A previous reviewer gave the 4 eggs, 2 cups half n half, and that is a great base for any quiche. It gives the perfect texture. This recipe was so-so.

This recipe is wonderful. I used a Pillsbury ready made pie crust instead of the puff pastry. Like the other reviewer I also used: 4 eggs, 2/3 c half & half and steamed 2 6oz bags of fresh baby spinach. I also sauteed 2 regular onions and used 3/4 c lowfat white cheddar. I baked it about 45 minutes. Moist and delicious.

This recipe turned out DELICIOUS, in spite of me! I don't know if anyone else besides me has a problem rolling out the Pepperidge Farm puff pastry into the proper size. Tonight I defrosted it very well and couldn't open it out to whatever size that it's supposed to be before you start rolling it, without it all ripping apart. So I had to start rolling the dough from the 3-1/2" x 10-1/2" size. Had to piece the crust into the pie plate. Only modified the original recipe by adding an extra egg, increasing the half & half to 2/3 cup, using Kraft EXTRA Sharp Cheddar cheese, and deleting the salt. It filled a 9" glass pie plate perfectly. Mine took forever to get done--next time I will bake it at 450 degrees and perhaps it will be done in 45 minutes.

Rating: 3
This recipe is great. It doesn't have the eggy taste that most quiche recipes have and the texture is perfect! I would double the quantity of the filling next time since it was too little for my 12" pie dish. I used fresh spinach and sauteed it with one chopped onion before adding it to the egg mixture. This is definitely a keeper and I'll try it next time with other ingredients e.g. turkey, mushrooms, salmon...etc.

A real hit. For those who had trouble with the crust getting too brown, before you put it in the oven, brush the crust with vegetable oil. It will be golden without having to cover with foil. I added a large sauted white onion, some sauted mushrooms and a drop more of half and half and it filled the crust perfectly.

This is an excellent recipe! To the cook from Florida, you may wish to try using a dark non-stick pie pan. This may solve your problem of a soggy crust. On the other hand, it sounds like you have had good luck with your recipe--I'll have to give it a try!

I was disappointed with this recipe. I think it was a texture issue. The puff pastry was soggy at the bottom, so I didn't see the advantage over regular crust No-one at mother's day lunch complimented me, and I am known for my quiche!(so I knew that they didn't like it as well) I will stick to Craig Claiborns recipe(The New York Times Cookbook) I've been making for 25 yrs! It is so easy! The base is 4 eggs to 2 cups half and half.(salt and pepper to taste) Then you can add anything else..like sauteed onion, bacon, gruyere, parmesan,( called quiche lorraine) or broccoli and cheddar, or spinach and feta, or asparagus, swiss and tomatoe. Sometimes I use poached salmon, fresh dill, with some sherry and lemon juice . You can even use leftover chicken and salsa for a Mexican flavor. My husband likes breakfast sausage and cheddar cheese. The possibilities are endless. You just have to cube the cheese so it melts nicely.If you need more liquid,(depending on how much filling you use) add more in the proportions given 4:2 (eggs to half and half). This makes for a custardy quich.) Use ready made frozen deep dish pie crust and bake(prick with a fork) 5 minutes first at 450, then fill and bake at 450 for the first 15 min then lower to 350 for about 20 minutes.(test with toothpick till dry)(you may have to put alluminum foil on the crust edges so they don't overbrown) I think the 425 for this recipe is too high- for quiche you need to lower to 350 for most of the cooking.(that's why the crust was burning for some of the cooks)Freezes well so make 2 at a time!(cook first) (wrap tightly with alluminum foil if freezing.) Defrost fully before baking and leave the foil on for most of the cooking.

I can't tell you how many (perhaps hundreds) rimes I've prepared this recipe since it came out in 1991 in Bon appetit's Too Busy to Cook special edition. I always have pastry sheets on hand and consider it almost a "pantry items on hand" category with the frozen spinach, cream cheese, eggs, 1/2 & parmesan on hand. All I have to do is pick up the shredded cheese. First thing in the morning I put the spinach out to thaw, eggs & cream cheese to room temp. All I have to do is watch the timing of the pastry sheet readiness to roll out. The rest goes together in a jiffy & ala I have lunch ready interspersed with other chores. I may pair it with colorful orange slices or a small tomato juice or roasted roma tomatoes. It's quick & easy after work or Sat lunch before I get out for weekend grocery shopping. My Special Edition issues of the 1991-92 era are getting quite dog-eared so glad can now tuck into my Recipe Box & be assured of easy retrieval. This reliable mainstay has seen me through many moves, even into living abroad, and shared w/many people.

My first quiche and it turned out great. I used fresh steamed spinach. I pre-cooked some red onion(I didn't have any green onion, bacon, and mushrooms together and added it to the filling. I used thick cream instead of half and half (all I had)and used a mix of parmesan, pecorino and colby cheese. I pre-cooked the pastry until just starting to brown. The end result was prefect and tasted sensational. I found all the comments very helpful! Thank you to all who add comments, even with variations, it saves me the trouble of making something I may not enjoy.

After reading the reviews, I doubled the base but only had one package of fresh spinach. I sauteed the spinach and added one pound of fresh broccoli rabe and 1/2 pound sliced baby kielbasa (leftover from New Year's Eve) then followed the remaining instructions. I split the custard into 2-9" pies. It was quick, easy and very tasty...flexible too!

This quiche is positively sinful! It had a rich flavor, delicate texture, and beautiful presentation. I used chopped fresh spinach (raw) instead of frozen, whipping cream instead of half and half, added an egg, and used a cheddar and jack blend instead of plain cheddar. I also didn't have my phyllo dough thawed, so I made the pastry recipe from Julia Childs' "The Way To Cook" cookbook instead. Outstanding!

I have to give this recipe 4 forks because is it delicious, as well as versatile. I'm one who's a stickler for following a recipe as it is printed for the first try. I was looking for an asparagus quiche recipe, but there isn't one, so I tried this recipe after reading all the reviews. I decided to follow any tip or recommendation that was made by at least 2 cooks and still had to make exceptions based on what was available. My subs: asparagus for spinach, Smoked Gruyere for Cheddar increased by 1/4c., increased half&half to 2/3c., covered for first half to prevent burning. EXCELLENT, a 'keeper'!

This came out as it should have--the crust was done right, the eggs were set--and I still didn't think it was exceptional. Quiches that include kalamata olives and goat cheeses tend to suit both vegitarian and carnivorous palates better. But this, of course, is just my opinion. I think a better and more festive dish for the mixed epicurian table is the Black Bean Tart with Chili Crust. It is savory, filling and unusual.

Yummy! I used some vadalia onion instead of the green onion. I added some Monterey Jack cheese (I had it left-over in the fridge). I added a little bit (1/4 c)more half and half.

I've made this a couple of times when entertaining vegetarians, and it was a great success both times. I LOVE the puff pastry crust and have had no trouble with it sticking. I took suggestion to add a little crushed red pepper both times and could probably add even a little more. I may try adding some bacon or ham sometime when fixing it for non-vegetarians. I served with the Wild Mushroom Risotto and fresh asparagus.

While I thought this recipe looked really good in print, the execution was something different. The puff pastry stuck to the glass pie plate, so that my guests were eating a crustless spinach quiche. I'd have probably added more half-and-half, too, as the filling was rather rubbery. In all, it was disappointing as the centerpiece of an Easter luncheon.

Rating: 3
The puff pastry makes this an easier (and impressive) crust. I reduced the amount of spinach by 25% as suggested and added about 1/4 cup milk in addition to the half-and-half. Perhaps this was the reason the quiche didn't set in the middle. I will still add more liquid but will add half and half next time and allow for additional baking time. Also, I sauted some onions (omitting the green onions) and bacon which added lots of flavor. Crust was a bit soggy under the mixture, I'll try pre-baking it for a few minutes first.

This was an easy, relatively quick, and very tasty spin on quiche. We substituted feta as the cheese component, added a couple of shakes of crushed red pepper based on a previous reviewer's suggestions, and threw a few chopped red bell peppers on top for color. Served with broiled tomato halves, it was a great option if you need or want a meatless meal.

My husband is actually the cook in the family, but my parents were visiting from out of town and wanted to make a good impression. This recipe was easy even for an inexperienced cook like me! Also, it was convenient: I could just make it ahead, stick it in the fridge, and pop it in the oven when they arrived. And it was YUMMY! Even my husband liked it, and has asked for it again! I covered the crust in tin foil for the first half of the baking time to keep it from burning, and it came out beautifully!

Out of about 15 dishes brought in for a bridal shower, this dish was gone first. Although I agree that prior to baking, it looked a little dry, I did add more half and half and it turned out perfectly! I am definitely saving this one for future potlucks.

I enjoyed this dish very much, and so did my husband who does not really care for quiche. I added one can (well drained) crab meat and I was happy with the results. It is also good cold.

I served this to company for brunch today and got great reviews. None left. I used fontina along with the parmesan and added slightly more half & half since some reviewers thought it was a bit dry. This helped I think because it wasn't dry at all. Also added crumbled bacon -- so easy to make. Not diet food but I'd definitely make it again!

Very easy to make, but does tend to get dry sometimes. I made this a few times and I tend to cut the baking time by 7 minutes to reduce dryness.

Excellent recipe! After reading the reviews, I also decided to add crumbled bacon and to use gruyere instead of cheddar. I made 2 for a recent gathering and both quickly vanished.

I made it without the puff pastry by baking it in a greased pie plate, and I added crumbled bacon. A keeper for my kitchen!

'i found this recipe to be bland and a little dry and lacking moistness. It needed another ingredint such as more onions, spices or a more robust cheese. My guests also did not seem to ask for seconds with this dish.

This recipe was very easy to prepare. The ingredients involved were all staples in the pantry and the level of preparation was quite low. The ingredients in this dish complimented each other and the taste was superb! i had many compliments and have made it several times!!

This was so easy to make and everyone loved it! I will probably try my next quiche in a puff pastry - how decadent! Everyone wants the recipe!

Very easy to make and not too eggy. I would add mushrooms and more green onions and reduce some of the spinach, but the basic recipe was very good. I never liked quiche until now.

SIMPLY OUTSTANDING!! I doubled the recipe and instead of cheddar, I made it with Gruyere. FABULOUS. Everyone LOVED the puff pastry crust and 3 people asked me for the recipe. What a success!
