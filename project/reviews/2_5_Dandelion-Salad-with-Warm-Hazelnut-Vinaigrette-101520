I added seared scallops to this dish and sauteed red onions for color. The sweetness of the scallops works well with the bitterness of the greens. I think this dish tastes better with a vinegrette that is more acidic so I used lemon instead of balsamic vinegar. I've also tried this dish with a poached egg that is still a bit runny on the inside--the runny yolk, toasted nuts and greens is an amazing combo.

This is good. Especially with the cornmeal fried fish. The secret to dandelion greens is the age- go for small new leaves- and the price, which should be free. Even if you live in an apartment, there must be someplace you can go to pick fresh organic dandelions!

We ate this salad with some cornmeal crusted fried fish and it was great. The bitterness of the greens complemented the fried food like crazy. Also, a tip I got from Cooks Illustrated for wilted salads is to saute some chopped red onions or whatever else you like in the oil (or bacon fat) for the vinaigrette. The extra solids keep the vinaigrette hot long enough to get perfect wilting. In this case, the sweetness of the red onions also helped the bitterness a little. But I like bitter greens anyway.

Dandelion greens ARE bitter and this recipe doesn't help matters. There are some nice recipes out there that incorporate dandelion greens but this is not one of them.

OK, is it me, or are dandelion greens insanely bitter? I bought a bunch at the farmer's market here in San Francisco, and made this recipe, only I opted to saute the greens on the vinagrette a bit, so they wilted. The end result was so bitter we couldn't eat it. Are dandelion greens just like that, or was my mistake in the choice to cook them?

The vinaigrette is awesome but the greens I used were maybe too old; they were really stem-y. Maybe I should have used just the top part of the leaves. I love the vinaigrette on arugala salad with pears though.

First try was only one-fork, but then again I hate hazelnut flavoring in my coffee. By substituting pecans for the hazelnuts (everything else as in the original) it became a 3-fork! recipe. With bread and coarsely grated parmesan: g-g-great!
