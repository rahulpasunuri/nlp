Wow! Served it in puff pastry vol-au-vent. Will definitely make it again. I used Julia Child's recipe from "The Way to Cook" to make the creme fraiche. Equal parts sour cream and whippimg cream whisked together. I let it stand at room temperature for a couple of hours to become tangy. I didn't think it would work, but it does.

Excellent. I scooped out a bit of the sauce before putting it into a serving bowl for an appetizer, and served with baquette slices on the side. A little thicker consistency made it easier for guests to assemble and eat during the informal/gathering part of the evening.

Had these for Christmas Eve, and will be having them again for New Years Eve. Made no changes to recipe and had great reviews from party goers.

Made this recipe 90 minutes ago for the first (and definitely not last) time, and couldn't be happier. My wife, I think, put it best saying she may never eat again as it can only be downhill from here. High, high praise.

This is a fantastic way to serve escargot. Have used as appetizer in mini puff pastry shells, as well as a first course in regular size puff pastry shells. Both times the recipe got rave reviews.

Excellent as small supper for two with a salad and crisp baguette.

Excellent! The creme fraiche takes it from being ordinary to extraordinary. I served these in puff pastry shells and received lots of compliments.
