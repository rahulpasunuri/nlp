Very simple as far as sorbet recipies go, but it tastes pretty much the same as frozen applesauce.

Very good. I added some cloves (along with the cinnamon stick). I had to put it in the freezer to get it nice and hard (after the ice cream maker step), but that is not unusual with sorbet. I wouldn't add any sugar if I made it again... it tastes so good that I want to eat more but with the sugar it is too sweet to eat much at a time. Oh, I added 2x the lemon to make it more tangy.

MMMMMMMMMMMM...really tasty. i wasn't sure i would like it, but it is rockin' good! i added a few allspice berries, a few cloves to the mix and some candied orange peel i had leftover to spice up the mixture. next time i will cut some of the sugar, but other than that, this is a definate 4 forker.

After spending a few days working in the kitchen, this was a nice, refreshing dessert that still had all the flavors of fall. I thought some people would object to this non-traditional dessert, but they wanted more! If the sorbet doesn't seem to be freezing in your ice cream maker, scrape down the sides so more of the liquid comes in to contact with the freezer.
