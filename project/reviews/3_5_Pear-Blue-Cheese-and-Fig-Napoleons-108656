to the previous reviewer wondering about the term "napoleon"-- yes, it is a specific pastry, made with layers of puff pastry, pastry cream and usually fruit and/or chocolate fillings. the use of the term here is, in my opinion, taking excessive liberty...

I made this for my first cocktail party ever and thought it tasted amazing. The prep time was next to nothing and has amazing presentation. Definitely a consideration for an autum party.

This looks delicious but we don't ever see fresh figs that are worth eating in Madison, WI, so I will have to improvise. I thought napoleans were pastries, but it seems that the sliced pears are being called napoleans in this recipe. Is there another meaning? I looked it up in the epicurious dictionary but only got the meaning that I know.
