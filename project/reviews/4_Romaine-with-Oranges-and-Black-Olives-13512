I used kalamanta olives and changed the vinegar to white balsamic. This was a pleasant change for a salad. It makes the non fruit eater eat fruit.

This is just a great salad all the way around, no question. Innovative AND delicious. Even the die hard salad haters loved it.

We really enjoyed this salad. The flavours were fresh and different. I cut down the oil and added the juice from the orange instead.

I got what I thought were oil-cured dried olives and soaked them in olive oil. That must not have been right as the olives were tough. Other flavors were good, so I will try next time with either labeled and tender oil cured olives or my stand-by kalamanta olives.
