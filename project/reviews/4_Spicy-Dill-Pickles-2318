Excellent refrigerator pickle recipe.

These are my favorite pickles. I've tried others, but these have (to me) the perfect balance of hot and sweet. I also stick green beans in them, for spicy dilly beans.

These are great. My family doesn't like sweet pickles so I reduce the sugar to 1 tsp. We have no problem eating these up within a month...but for the person looking to make them last longer I would suggest cutting a thin slice of the blossom end of the cucumbers before pickling. There's a chemical in the blossom end that impacts the crispness (when they're canned traditionally at least). You can also try adding grape leaves to the jars.

I believe you buy pickling spices in a jar in the spice section of the grocery store. The same stuff you use to make corned beef.

How can anyone rate this recipe when the ingredients for "pickling spice" are NOT STATED! This is not self evident. It's ridiculous to accept a recipe where an important term is undefined, as to ingredients. I found no fewer than ten(10) pickling spice recipes on the internet, all different. Please specify what the components and quantities are in the pickling spice you refer to! Thanks!

This is my first year making pickles and these have been a huge hit. I take another reviewer's suggestion for homemade pickling spice and it's great. Although they are on the sweet side, they appeal to people who don't like a sour pickle. I've been serving them as part of my locavore hor d'oeurves assortment and they always are gone. quickly. Just finished another batch today.

Two forks as written, four forks with modifications. These are WAY too sweet to the point of being borderline disgusting, more like bread and butter pickles. If you want a classic dill pickle taste, cut the sugar back to 1 Tablespoon. Additionally I could not find dill seed for the life of me (not at Whole Foods or local mega-grocery chains) so I just added more dill weed. Could use more dill flavor so I think I'll order the seeds online. The spice level is just right, nice zing from the pepper flakes. My recommendation is follow the recipe as is but drastically cut back the sugar unless sweet pickles are your goal.

I started making the recipe years ago. Since I can't stand the overpowering taste of dill, I made it without the fresh dill or the dill seeds. What a hit. I can't keep up with the demand of my friends wanting their own jar! I highly recommend omitting the dill for a really spicy pickle

the best pickle recipe i've ever had. Leave them in for about two weeks. The flavor just jumps out at you. It' sour, spicy, and just tastes like a good old pickle.

I've been pickling Kirby cucumbers for many years, using almost this exact recipe. The only thing is, I don't use sugar in it. I also add celery, cabbage leaves and green tomatoes. Fabulous and drop dead delish!

Just a pinch of sugar and more chili flakes. I also sliced hot peppers into these pickles which are wonderful and crunchy and continue to cure in my fridge. My boyfriend and friends love them!

Great recipe! I've been pickling small to medium sized cucumbers whole to be eaten in the fall and slicing up the large cucumbers prior to pickling for immediate eating frenzy.

Great pickles! Per the suggestions of other reviewers, I halved the sugar. It's still a little sweet. I'm after a classic dill pickle, so I'll cut the sugar to 1 tablespoon next time. Husband loves them! The spicy is just a pleasant heat - tolerable even for sissies like me.

I'm confused by the recipe, which says to "combine all ingredients except dill sprigs in large bowl". But there are no dill sprigs listed in the ingredients, only chopped dill and dill seeds. Are the sprigs in addition to the chopped dill?

I made these this past summer with my overabundance of cucumbers. They were delicious! In fact, my somewhat finicky husband wiped out the entire batch (about 6 jars) within 2-3 weeks! I cut the cucumbers into quarters and restocked the jars with new cucumbers as they were eaten. Also, I halved the sugar. I can't wait until next summer to make them again!

I've been making batches of pickles using this recipe all summer - people in my office are actually offering to *pay me* for jars of these pickles, they're so good! A few modifications I've made - I cut the cukes into chunky rounds, and use half the amount of sugar called for (and use superfine sugar since it dissolves better). Also, I use my own pickling spice comprised of equal amounts of brown mustard seed, black peppercorns, allspice, juniper berries, coriander and fennel seeds. Finally, I tuck a few whole dried chiles into the jars once they're filled. Super easy and delicious!

i learned something. eat them in about a month and they are like claussen--nice a crisp. wait a few more months and they are like vlasic's, alot softer. i prefer the claussen but can't eat 6 jars in a month. does anyone know how to keep them crisp for longer? they certainly last over a month as we are eating some now that are 6 months old. flavor is still great but texture is soft.

This recipe is too sweet for my taste. I didn't think it was spicy at all. If i were to make again, i would add dried chili pods and cut out some sugar.

These are terrific -- so easy and good that they inspired a male friend to try his hand at pickling. Like others, I left out the sugar because I don't like sweet pickles. I only had cider vinegar on hand, so I used that instead -- and they still turned out great.

This pickle recipe is incredible. I've never made pickles before but finally decided to with the surplus cucumbers I have. The sweet/spicy combo is a big hit with family and friends. I've even used the recipe for green beans, carrots, pearl onions and some celery. Awesome in a Bloody Mary. The previous reviewer is on the money, crank up the red pepper and holy moly.....awesome!!!!!

I made these pickles on a whim -- too many cucumbers to give away. After I made them I put them away for two weeks and then timidly presented them to the family. I was surprised at how much they enjoyed them -- I raised Vlasic kind of guys. I left out the red pepper but they were still really good, not sour but kind of a sweeter dill. I will add this recipe to my file.

This pickle recipe rules! Crank up the hot pepper and garlic for double-plus good.

I, like many others, was looking for a "dill" pickle. Based on other reviews, I decided to try this. I nixed the sugar and pickling spices. FANTASTIC! These come out so good, because they aren't cooked by the brine. To speed things up, though, I did boil the brine, and then chilled it in an ice water bath. Poured it over the cukes in the jars, let sit in fridge 2 weeks. WOW! Just the right amount of herbs and spices. And these get even better the longer they sit in the fridge! Next year I'm growing my own cukes, as they are hard to come by in El Paso! KEEPER!

great crispy pickles! not too salty which was nice. i doubled the dill (good move) and pickling spice which i won't do next time. this is a keeper!

My children loved these pickles. I used a little more garlic, because we a garlic lovers.

I cut the sugar and pickling spice in half (too much sugar and the pickling spice I found is also a little sweet). I put all ingredients (except dill) into a large pot, turned up the heat slightly, and once sugar and salt had dissolved, poured it into jars. Perfect. I have also made this with green tomatoes and they also are terrific!

Has anyone tried this with anything other than cucumbers? Like green beans, asparagus? Thanx

I make these every summer! I always eliminate the sugar, though. I prefer mine without any. And I always use more salt than called for. If you have an abundance of cucumbers from your garden, and they're not the pickling variety, you can cut regular cucumbers into spears and they work excellently. The freshness is reminiscent of the uncooked varieties such as Claussen. And one other note, based on my experience, they stay fresh in the refrigerator for much longer than one month!

Broke out the first bottle today (10th day), and they are spectacular. Will definitely make this again; may increase the pepper and garlic on the next batch.

Very simple and good. I used cider vinegar and reg. vinegar and doubled the brine ratio to cover the pickles well. My husband, a pickle lover, really liked them. I am going to increase the garlic on the next batch.

10 days in the fridge and they were ready. we made approximately 8 jars, and they're all gone. making them again today. a big hit, and super easy. quite sweet, though.

I quartered my cucumbers first and used fennel seeds in place of dill seeds and had fantastic pickles (I would call them dill/bread and butter pickles) in ten days.

These need to cure longer than 10 days. The ones I served at a family reunion were bitter and inedible 10 days after I made them. The ones I gave away to friends were crisp and delicious after a month in the brine.

Absolutely terrific. Best pickles I've tasted in my life. Cut the sugar in half, too sweet. I wouldn't call it a "dill" pickle being that sweet. I used regular table salt, worked fine. I'll try apple cider vinegar next time. I added chopped basil. Lightly on the fiery hot side, some people may like it with half the amount of dried crushed red pepper.

Easy to make but would add more red pepper. Very taste pickle. Personally enjoy a little more zing in the heat department. I would recommend to anyone interested in making pickles. It would be helpful if anyone knows if these can be canned to prolong shelf life.

This was a great recipie. I didn't realize how easy it was to make pickles without the canning/water bath step. I didn't have pickling spice so I used Old Bay and I increased the red pepper. Great flavor.

These are terrific pickles. I added dried bird's eye peppers, as well as crushed red pepper...it gave them a nice ZING! Can't wait to make more!

The pickles turned out great, but they were more sweet than they were spicy. They were not what I expected but delicious anyway.

Had I known how easy it is to make such great pickles, I'd have made them oh so much more! It seems we eat them faster than I can prepare them. I usually end up adding extra red pepper and dill and decreasing the sugar a bit... but even if you follow the recipe exactly, they'll still be great!

Wonderful, fresh and crunchy. Since the recipe makes more than on jar, add more crushed red pepper some jars for spicier and less to others for folks who cant handle the flame!

super pickles, crisp, tasty, and really easy to make. no cooking keeps them very snappy like claussen, only better.
