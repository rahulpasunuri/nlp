This is my go-to tikka. It's even better with a good masala sauce. You will not have leftovers.

Delicious! I marinated chicken and lamb, and they turned out extremely well. Tender and flavorful! The one change I made was to use soy based sour cream instead of yogurt to keep kosher standards (I know, it may sound gross but it worked out really well!). I would highly recommend this WITH the mango red pepper chutney, which was out of this world.

ok...a bit bland for us unfortunately...maybe next time I'll double the spices...

nmatulich: per your comments in your review, chicken tikka masala is a different dish than chicken tikka. chicken tikka DOES mean chunks of chicken that's been cooked on skewers (masala is the dish with a sauce).

Delicious and pretty easy. This isn't the usual spice mix Indian restaurant's use when they serve chiken tikka masala. I am trying to figure out this dish's real name, since chicken tikka is a really vague name. chicken tikka = chicken on kebabs

My family adores this dish. I make it with a masala sauce and there are never any leftovers. The chicken is fork tender.

This is my holy grail for chicken tikka masala! I've been trying for a while to replicate the restaurant dish for my husband. I made this as written (altho' scaled down for 1 pound of chicken). Then I sauteed some onion, garlic and ginger and added Patak's Chicken Tikka Masala Curry Cooking Sauce (yes, I know, but the masalas I've made from scratch have been not so good) until heated through. Added the cooked chicken and about 1/4 cup of heavy cream and heated. Then stirred in some chopped cilantro and served. The husband said it was the best he'd ever had (finally)! And I really loved it, too.

This was our first grilling this spring. Wow what an opener!! The flavor was fantasitic. I marinated boneless skinless thighs overnight then grilled them whole. We sliced the thighs and ate them in pocket pitas with thinly sliced sweet onion and cilantro leaves. I also made a flavored sauce using the same spices as the marinade. It was wonderful.

Solid Indian marinade for chicken- I just put the pieces in a broiler pan, no skewers involved. Not worth making on its own, but pair it with the Mango-Red Pepper Chutney and OH yum. Highly recommend with the chutney and basmati rice for a delicious dinner. I added paprika too, for the heck of it. Proportions are somewhat forgiving - add more of something if you like it.

Delicious - restaurant quality taste. I used chicken thighs, which I marinated overnight, and threw them on the grill instead of broiling so that they would get a little charred.

Such small spices do not blend in a blender. Better to crush the spices first they just mix everything together. Used gas grill instead of broiler and liked the charred effect...did not oil the grill which turned out to be a problem. Added paprika to the marinade for more color.

Delicious and authentic. I didn't have any cumin or coriander so I added a teaspoon of Hot Madras Curry Powder instead. I've also made this recipe with fish and that was great too. A cucumber and tomato salad and the following naan recipe is an absolute must for accompaniments: http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Naan/Detail.aspx

I meant to say, a longer (1-2 days) marinade with garlic-yogurt, followed by another day with the spices...

Rating: 3
This was a reasonably approximation of the dish. A marinade of garlic-yogurt before allowing a tikka spice rub to marinade into the meat lends a deeper flavour. This isn't bad for the effort though.

Fabulous. I did not use skewers, just broiled in a non stick roasting pan, but my wife and loved this. Served with brown rice and mango red pepper chutney from other epicurious receipes. Plan on making for our next dinner party.

I halved this recipe to use with a smaller amount of boneless chicken thighs. In the interest of time, I used ground cumin and corriander seeds (not toasted), and was out of turmeric. Marinated for 4-5 hours and just broiled it in the oven (no skewers). Very forgiving, adjustable recipe- It is addictingly moist and declicious. Served with curried cauliflower and peas. YUMMY!

This is one of the best recipes I've ever made! I followed the directions to the letter- and marinated the chicken overnight. Definitely make the chutney too - it's scrumptious.

This is a solid recipe. In my kitchen it never quite reaches the tikka at my favorite Indian restaurants, but that may have to do with my ingredients or prep. The recipe as written is very forgiving and it is easily scalable. I've halved it, I've doubled it. I have even gone so far as to make a batch, not added the meat, and frozen it for two months. With minor tweaks to the thawed product, I had a very good tikka, without even marinating the chicken. I like this recipe because I can adapt it to a very low sodium diet for some of my guests, to a very spicy dish for others, and I can add the richness of coconut milk for real comfort food. Infinitely tweakable, adaptable and stretchable. One could devote a master's degree level of study to simply perfecting this one dish. ~ Have fun. This recipe will get you nicely started.

Served this as an appetizer to an Indian meal. The chutney was delicious with it. I made Cucumber & Mint Raita too. Marinated the chicken overnight & cooked them on the grill. Enjoyed by all.

I made this for my boyfriend and he raved about it. Definitely a keeper and so easy to prepare on a weeknight -- just make sure to marinade the evening before the dinner. I had it in a wrap with red lettuce, tomato and sauteed onions and it was excellent. Looking forward to making it again.

This is not real chicken tikka. After I made this recipe, my husband filed for divorce and started dating a woman who can make real chicken tikka. I'll never eat chicken tikka again. Though it was tasty. I'd add cilantro next time.

Excellent recipe....I used ground corriander/cumin in place of seeds-prep was easier & texture nicer. YOu can also serve this with a peanut satay/sauce....yum!~

I love this dish. Definitely make the chutney, it is what "seals the deal"--I eat chicken just to have generous spoons of chutney! Also, taught this dish in a cooking class, met with rave reviews. If you make the mint raita, you will likely have twice as much as what you need.

I have made this dish a few times now, and I love it. Definitely make the mango chutney and cucumber raita. I have always broiled, but next time will try on the grill.

The problem with any recipe that "has no taste", is that you didn't taste it before you cooked it. Taste as you go and you will never have a bland recipe. I added extra garlic and raosted spices. Very good, very flavorful.

My husband and I love indian food. This is not too spicy, and very tender. Made using 6 lbs of chix last night, BBQ'd on the grill, and it disappeared so fast, I barely got to try 1 skewer myself. Even my mom who generally keeps kosher, had to mix milk with meat and taste some! Next time I will make mint raita and spicy chutney, plus increase spices.

This isuch a great and easy dish. I have made it several times and it is always a crowd pleaser. I serve it with a cucmber and mint raita and rice - simple, flavorful and light. I am not a recipe follower typically, but I did follw this one and have only altered the cayenne pepper to suit different palates.

This dish was outstanding! I marinated the chicken for 24 hours. Served with couscous loaded with veggies, mint and raisin. We loved this dish. Chef Denise

This was absolutely delicious and my guests were all quite impressed that such good Indian food could be made at home (by a non-Indian!). I served it with the mango chutney and raita, over brown rice, and it was a fantastic summer dinner.

This is pleasing, even to people who aren't wild about indian food. I served it with the mango chutney and mint thingy as well as the cumin glazed carrots as suggested. Flavors blended really well....

This was killer. Did chicken on the grill, added toasted/ground urad dal and toasted, dried red chiles to the mango chutney, and did raita with shallots, cucumbers, tomatoes, jalapenos, and lime juice. Grilled flour tortillas brushed with olive oil. Threw cilantro over everything. Wicked.

Thought this was ok, but not great. Needs some zip to it. Served it w/the cilantro/coconut rice & cumin glazed carrots. Both of those recipes were good.

This is just delicious. We made it with the mango relish, mint raita, and the coconut basmati rice. The hardest part was adjusting the ingredients for just 2 people and one pound of chicken. But I found the proportions of ingredients to be quite forgiving. It is not a lot of work if the components are made in stages while the chicken is marinating. I do agree that the messiest part is skewering the marinated chicken pieces. But the results are worth it. We also grilled it outside on a gas grill.

This was good and easy to prepare. Kinda messy putting the chicken on the skewers, but worth it. Served with Cilantro Coconut Rice from this site. Delicious combo of flavours.

Chicken was easy to make and very tasty. Took the hint and cooked it on the gas grill. Came out looking like the picture!

Delicious. Grilled on gas grill with good results. Next time, will add a little heat (cayenne) to the marinade.
