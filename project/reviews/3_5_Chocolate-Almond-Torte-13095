I made this for my husband's birthday and the whole family enjoyed it. The flavour was lovely and the torte was neither too heavy nor too dry. We discovered while eating the cake that there were some bits of the almonds that didn't get ground up. I think I actually prefer it that way. Next time I may leave in a few more larger bits to add a bit of texture.

This torte was good, but the compote was just odd. I followed the recipe exactly, and when the compote was room temperature, it was the consistency of thick jam, and the Kirsch taste was overpowering. Since I had made this for a work function, I toned the alcohol flavor down with large volumes of apple juice, which also made the compote more like compote than jam. In addition to the compote and sweetened cream condiments, I added a chocolate sauce made with the leftover Scharffen Berger chocolate and some whipping cream. It presented well, and everybody liked it!

This torte was very good but I think that there are others that are easier and taste just as good if not better. I think that the flourless chocolate espresso torte on this site is certainly one.

Of all desserts I have eaten, this is probably my favorite. It was made for me on my birthday several years ago and I make in on average about five times a year! (usually for birthdays and other special occasions) The only amendment made is to serve it with a raspberry sauce instead of the cherry compote. Excellent recipe!

I have made this torte about 3 - 4 times. It is dense, fairly rich but not cloying. The real star of this recepie is the sour cherry compote. If you cannot find dried cherries, use dried cranberries instead -- the result is very similar. THe combination of chocolate and the compote is great -- dont forget the schlag (lightly whipped cream)on the side!
