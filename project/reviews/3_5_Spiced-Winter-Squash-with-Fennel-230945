Amazing Flavors! I served it with some coriander chicken and some light brioche buns and it was amazing. I would definitely recommend this.

We didn't enjoy this dish. The fennel and squash were dry and the spices were somewhat overpowering. I may try one reviewer's recommendation to turn leftovers (we have lots) into soup but I won't be making this again. There are many better recipes for roasting veggies.

At best, this was O.K. You could eliminate the squash altogether and cook it twice as long and it might be acceptable as the flavors of the spices seemed to be worth working with but I have better things to do with my time

Have been making this for years in small and large batches. Great autumn aroma throughout the house. Terrific as leftovers. Make sure you cut the onions and fennel leaving even just a little bit of root to keep the segments from falling apart. No substitutions needed.

This is a nice combination of spices and a great addition to any fall menu. It is especially good with pork or grilled lamb. I wouldn't change a thing.

I sort of made this recipe- used acorn squash instead of butternut, and probably less of it but the same amount of everything else; and no turmeric. The finished product was delicious and the aroma of fennel filled my house. My only complaint was that the vegetables got a little dry from the roasting, maybe I would cover them next time.

I didn't care for this at all. The curry paste dried on the outside of the vegetables, which detracted from the flavor and texture of the vegetables. I love roasted vegetables but thought this recipe was a clunker.

Delicious! My family could not get enough of this dish... so flavorful.

I have made this recipe several times and IF we have leftovers, I puree the vegetables with vegetable broth to make a most delicious soup (Amount of broth depends on how thick you like your soup.)

I love this very easy recipe and have made it four times in the last month. The blend of spices is just perfect, and contrary to the last review, the fennel is great to balance the sweetness of the squash. I just made it for a luncheon for 12 people, and everyone asked for the recipe. Just be careful when increasing the recipe that you do not use too much olive oil. Also, I find that the vegetables are all cooked through in 30 minutes if using a 450 degree oven.

I loved this recipe and have made it several times already. I just served it at a party and everyone was copying the recipe before they left. A great success

Very easy to make and healthy. This is a wonderful fall dish that belongs at a Thanksgiving table. I adored the fennel and spices, but don't forget to use plenty of salt.

This is a great dish for the Fall. It's seasonal, delicious and very easy to prepare. I served it, and had immediate requests from several to include it in the Thanksgiving dinner.

Outstanding recipe for a late dinner by candlelight with a glass of white wine and of course, my lovely wife. We drizzled fresh extra virgin olive oil over the vegetable at the table. Olive oil added an extra nutty taste to the recipe. We topped-off the dinner with crustless cheesecake and black coffee.

Decent - go easy on the spices simply because they can actually feel gritty in your mouth as they sit on the veggies rather then get absorbed. Don't skimp on the salt. Carrots made a nice addition and I might leave out the fennel next time, unless you LOVE it, it does not really add anything memorable.
