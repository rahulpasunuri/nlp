Easy, quick. Nice alternative to mayonnaise-based or asian flavored slaws. Used regular head of cabbage we had on hand and that worked fine.

This a good mid-week recipie. It's simple to make, healthy, and inexpensive.

Sorry.. I read the reviews and I knew my husband loved cabbage and especially caraway seeds,but, I thought this was not so interesting. It was certainly easy and beautiful presentation, but the taste was not worthy of the 100% rating.

My husband said this was the best cabbage he ever had. I don't cook cabbage very often, but after making this recipe, I may fix it more often.

This dish was quite nice and light - I served it as an alternative to the heavier boiled cabbage with corned beef on St. Patrick's day.
