This was not nice at all. I used good quality cocoa & the result was very poor. Flavor was quite strong, but the texture was off & left a chalky feel in the mouth. Five of us tried it, none finished it & I won't make this again.

This was almost as good as the Berthillon "Sorbet au cacao amer"! I can't get corn syrup in France, so I used liquid glucose syrup. It's basically just a liquid sweetener that prevents crystallization... Simple syrup can also work in a pinch, as long as it's a relatively thick version...

I would love to try this but cant have the corn syrup, can anyone suggest a suitable substitute ?

I had my doubts before making, but this turned to out to be very good. Extremely easy to make. Definately full of chocolate flavor but refreshing at the same time.

This was very chocolatey-- but a bit too sweet for me. Next time I will reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup. A bit of instant espresso powder would be a nice addition--maybe 1/2 - 1 teaspoon.

DELISH! easy-to-do, though you definitely have to start this one early. the only time-consuming part is the blending, though it may be b/c i used a blender instead of a food processor. Sooooo good & rich & chocolatey!

I added the zest of one orange to this, and it was a really nice touch. With the orange, this sorbet makes the perfect companion to the Coconut Lime Sorbet (one scoop of each.

This was a little too icy. I was hoping for a consistency closer to that of Ben and Jerry's. It was my first time using my ice cream maker, so that probably had a lot to do with it. But I absolutely loved the rich chocolate taste. It was very dark and intense, but cool and refreshing.
