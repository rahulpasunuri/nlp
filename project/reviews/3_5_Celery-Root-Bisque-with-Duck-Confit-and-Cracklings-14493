I have made this recipe quite a few times.It is always a big hit at dinner parties in the wintertime instead of rolling out some banal starter.It is delicious and most people don't use celeriac so it was quite a conversation piece.I will keep it as part of my repertoire.

Found this recipe to use with some leftover duck legs. It was very delicious, considering the few ingredients.

I think this recipe needs a little help, starting with some guidance on pureeing hot soup in a blender. Other than that, flavor was very delicate and would benefit from some sherry or mushrooms or something. Might make it again with some improvements.

My guess is that the flavor of this soup would be greatly enhanced by the use of well-seasoned chicken stock instead of water.

I love celeryroot. That why I was so surprised that this recipe did not turn out as expected. It was bland. Needs an herb to enliven it. The pureed celeryroot was an icky color, especially in my white soup bowls and the texture was pastey--needed to be thinned. Like all pureed vegetable soups, it was easy to make and the duck cracklings were a nice touch. I'd make it again to see what went wrong, but there are so many recipes to make and so little time. If it isn't great the first time, I move on.

When I "confit" duck legs/thighs I cover them with rendered duck fat in my crock pot and let them cook at a low temperature all day. This way you don't need the oven on for long periods of time and the preparation requires less supervision.

Question: I can get raw duck, but not confit. How do you proceed with just raw duck leg? Answer: Make duck confit. It's a simple peasant preperation. Simply, generously rock salt, thyme, and pepper duck legs for 1-2 days. Then brush off the salt and poack the duck legs in duck fat for 2 hours. The best way to poach is to bake in a 220 degree oven submerged in duck fat. You can then store the confit in the refridgerator for several weeks. Confit makes all the difference. Also try this preperation with pork tenderloin and fresh lard. -Enjoy

Very nice. I didn't have much confit, so I just added a granish-sized slice of it as well as a handful of crispy duck skin to each bowl. The soup was tasty without these garnishes, but really good with (the skin gave the soup a deep roasty flavour). I also roasted the celeriac beforehand as I find it more mellow that way.

Question: I can get raw duck, but not confit. How do you proceed with just raw duck leg? Answer: I'd recommend removing the leg/thigh and cooking separately (ala Julia Child). It's not the same as confit, but close enough! Your neighbor on Spotswood Dr. Cloverly, MD PS: are you on Harding? I think I've gotten your Gourmet by mistake occasionaly.

I just made the bisque (no duck leg for me)and it was delightful and warmed the cockles of my heart.
