I have made creme caramel in the past and this was the first time I've made it using heavy cream. Although the consistency was very smooth, it definitely did not have the same texture as a traditional creme caramel. Next time I'll stick with making the creme caramel with strictly eggs and never again with heavy cream - that is what differentiates this dessert with others. If you prefer a creamier texture, then this is the one, otherwise stick with the traditional egg and egg yolk based creme caramel.

Nice and lemony, however it did not turn out firm and even texture like a regular creame caramel, it turned out more like the texture of mousse. This calls for heavy cream? I used whipping cream...it this how I errored as most custards are made with milk or light cream. Also when inverted most caramel sauces come out with custard and flow..this did not.. Any advise as to what I did wrong? Would love to try this again. I have a super receipe with orange juice and Grande Marnier for those of you who would like it..just email me and I will forward it to you...to try out... Please tell me how the texture was for you on this lemon receipe. Thank you...lstcougarlady

A PIE PAN!? Use a decorative, sculptural copper mold instead of the pie pan. (PLEASE!) It makes a better presentation at the table. Just experiment with the quantity to fit the mold. (Probably doubling the recipe will fit most copper molds.)

I've made this twice and both times I had trouble making the caramel. However, that never interfered with the taste -- nice and lemony.

Made this for a New Year's eve date. Creme caramel was fabulous, the date ... well, the creme caramel was rich and delicious! I wonder, could this recipie be made in individual ramelins?
