Reminds me of the more traditional cornbread that my grandfather loved to eat. This recipe forms a thick crust on the outside and is tender and crumbly in the center. I wouldn't recommend it, however, to someone who is looking for a sweeter, more "cakey", corn muffin recipe.

You have to understand this is a dry cornbread because it is meant to be made as a stufing. It is not too flavorfull for eating on its own! Now with that said, I have a daughter who is allergic to milk and egg so I used a plain soy milk, vegan shortening sticks, and "egg replacer" powder from whole foods and it came out great. It looks beautiful and though it would taste better with butter it still tastes great! It goes well in the cranberry sausage stuffing.

This easy recipe was just perfect for the Herb & Bacon Cornbread stuffing. I thought it was a bit too dense for eating directly, but then I'm not a huge fan of cornbread by itself. I'll definatly make it again for stuffing though!

I use this recipe every year to make for my cornbread stuffing, and I make extra just to eat. Very good, moist and tasty!

Wow, for just a basic recipe this turned out fantastic. I used gluten-free flour instead of the all-purpose (with 1.5tsp of xantham gum to bind) and agave/maple syrup instead of the sugar. So ya, there were modifications, but the resulting cornbread is moist and buttery and all-around yummy. I made this for my stuffing recipe, but I'll be making it again just to eat straight-up.

My bread was burned in less than minutes and my oven thermometer is normally right on. The cooking temp must be WAY too high.

This recipe was overall great. I added about 1/4 cup extra milk but that was the only adjustment. The taste was fantastic. The texture was heavinly the same day, but a little dry the next day. The only problem i saw was that the batter was not thin like the recipe said it was going to be so i got a little confused at that point. I plan on making this regularly

I agree with the chef from Canada. it was dry and not flavorful. I like corn bread that is more like a corn muffin. this was dense and dry.

Made it in a cast-iron pan and it was beautiful and delicious, took it out at 40 minutes. Moist inside and crispy outside. Reminds me of home...North California.

I've made this a few times just to have corn bread. It makes a lot, the loaf shape is a nice change, but if you just want it for corn bread watch your time and take it out sooner! It's been a while, so not sure how much sooner I took it out, but I think it was a good 10 min or so!

tasteless, dry, waste of time and ingredients

I made this for the herb and bacon corn bread stuffing. Turned out ok, next time around I'm just going to use the Marie Callender's corn bread mix. It's much easier and I got better results when I used that instead.

It was VERY GOOD right out of the oven. However, when it cooled, it was VERY dry. As it is for a stuffing recipe originally, maybe that's what you want. But for eating it was too cakey and dry.

Very good, moist and easy corn bread. It is a full loaf size and I think that makes it less dry than shallower breads.

Just what I was looking for: simple to make, just the right sweetness, and perfect texture (not dry, not too moist).

A bit dry but a good bread indeed. Great with stew or a real savory dish in the winter. Gets stale very quickly so make sure you use it in a day or two.

I have made this several times just to eat as it comes out of the oven! Yummy! Last time, I added some chopped fresh rosemary, fresh garlic and fresh parmesan cheese. It was delicious and my guests loved it. I'm sure you could add lots of different things to the basic recipe. It has a wonderful texture.

I didn't think this cornbread would be as good as mine, but I was pleasantly mistaken! The only thing I would suggest is that if you are using this for a savory dressing, and not one that has fruit in it, I wouldn't put in the sugar.
