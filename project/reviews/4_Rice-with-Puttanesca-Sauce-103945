Here in Italy, this recipe is well-known as a warm pasta sauce, beginning with oil, garlic, anchovies, then tomatoes, green and black olives and capers. Hot chili is also welcome. Generally used with spaghetti, linguine and bucatini. A CLASSIC !!

Quick, easy, and delicious! Being a grad student on a pretty tight food budget, I used canned tomatoes and dried spices, and it still had fantastic flavor. I allowed the sauce to sit in the frige and blend its flavors overnight, and then threw it in a frying pan with day-old rice to make a quick and easy Mediterranean-style stir fry.

Very Flavorful! Extremely fast; I choose to use pasta not rice. It is good hot or cold, or with added seafood. I have blended in the food processor and used it as a dip on crusty bread. Think about omitting the salt, olives have enough as it is.

I've made this numerous times for my family since my daugher was forced to eliminate wheat from her diet. I use Muir Glen organic chopped tomatoes instead of fresh in the cold months in New England. It's fabulous with some grated aged gouda sprinkled on top. Super fast, easy and always satisfying.

Made with anchovy paste as suggested. Used 1/2 local yellow cherry tomatoes and 1/2 local mini-plum tomatoes. It worked very well.

This is wonderful with brown rice. I added a bit of anchovy paste and it improved the flavor. This would be best if made during the summer when tomatoes are at their peak. I used winter tomatoes and the flavor lacked somewhat. Would definitely make this again.

I added a few smashed anchovies, cooked with the garlic and tomatoes, and found it a bit salty, but my husband loved it -- he called it an explosive flavor mix. Next time I would add a lot more parsley and basil, and serve it as a side dish with a blander fish or meat.

I rated this 4 because I used as side dish. This rocked! Brown rice was Lundberg Wehani.

I gave it 4 forks because it's so fresh, delicious, comforting, and easy! I used a huge bowl of fresh tomatoes and sprigs of basil from my garden, and I know that put it over the top. It was perfect over brown basmati. Try it!

I wish I had tried this years ago. Such flavor. Obviously, you must love olives to like this dish but if you do, look out. I had to use canned diced tomatoes but enjoyed it. I heated it also. I also did not add salt and found it on the salty side anyway.

Excellent taste! And looks beautiful when served too!

This recipe totally satisfies my taste buds, the flavor is very balanced. I didn't serve it on rice but on pasta.

This was an excellent dish. I made it with pasta, as I'm not wild about rice, and made the heated version, which was delicious. Nice strong flavors that blend well. Plus, it's easy--I made it for a friend in 20 minutes! YUM!

This was fabulous - and even better the next day.

Good, not stellar. I tried this over long-grain white rice, but felt that it would have been better over pasta.

I love this sauce. In winter I make the cooked sauce with good quality canned tomatoes and it still tastes so good. I serve it over brown basmati. I've tried it over white and the rice just doesn't stand up to it as well.

It's not comfort food, but it sure is comfortable. We made it on the start of labor day weekend as a supplemental dish. It was quite a supplement! It would have done for a main dish. It leaves a really feel-good aura!

I would most definitely make this again, it was absolutely wonderful! I served it with leg of lamb and my guests were using the yogurt mint sauce to put on the rice. Everyone wanted the recipe.

I made the cooked version. Easy, filling and delicious. The flavors of the capers, green and greek olives, herbs blend together beautifully. Even with winter tomatoes (blah) the sauce worked out and my husband raved about it. I've borrowed the cookbook from the library, and it looks like there are several other great recipes. I can open it at random and find something I'd like to try.

This is a wonderful recipe. Very easy to prepare and delicious. I love Pasta Puttanesca, and this is even better.
