I loved this dish. I ommitted the plain salt in the rub. The glaze was wonderful but a tad sweet. I'm thinking of adding a bit of white wine vinegar next time to tart it up a bit.

Excellent choice for Father's Day. WE definitely will make this again and again.

By the way, I used pork tenderloin. I browned it quickly in olive oil, then put it in the oven at 325 for 30 minutes, then let it rest for another 30 minutes.

I made this for guests last night. It was really delicious. After dessert, my guests kept sneaking back into the kitchen for a few more bites. I made it with http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Mashed-Potatoes-with-Celery-Root-and-Mascarpone-4382 and served it with a delicious barbara wine. As close to perfect as I've ever gotten.

We modified this recipe to use make a dry rub for a Boston Butt roast. We skipped the glaze entirely, because we were looking for something a little less sweet and a little more spiced/salty. We made the spice rub as directed, rubbed the entire roast (be sure to score the fat cap and place it right side up so that it drips down around/onto the roast). We both thought this came out exceptionally well. I'm admittedly a bit stingy when it comes to 4 forks, but this dish definitely deserved it. Served w/ a wild-rice/pine-nut/fig pilaf and steamed spinach. Yum yum.

Yum! Great chops - we broiled them instead of grilling and they were delicious. The smokey flavor of the chipotle made them interesting - and perfectly seasoned.

Wow - this is fabulous. I'm glad I read reviews first, however, as I also cut back on the salt by using garlic powder rather than salt and I used a bit less of the plain salt as well. The rub was still plenty salty. I also applied the rub a few hours before cooking to allow the flavors to develop more. I would recommend this step. The sauce is to die for. Dinner guests last night took home a printout of the recipe. I think this would be a wonderful treatment for chicken or turkey as well.

my entire family loves this. Even the children. Made by the recipe the first time but not enough time to allow glaze to come to room temp and was too thin - but still turned out great. The way I make the glaze now is to put the ingredients in my little "magic bullet" blender (that I use to make smoothies with) and there's no need to heat it on the stove. Consistency is perfect to use immediately. I serve it with mandarin orange slices, too.

I use real cranberry juice instead of the cran-raspberry.

I make 4 batches of the rub & glaze and use it on chicken too. It's really good on boneless chicken thighs. Everyone raves when I make this. If I don't have hot smoked paprika, I use half paprika and half ground red pepper. the chipotle chile powder adds the smoke. i also sometimes use garlic powder instead of garlic salt, since there's already so much salt.

These were good but all the different flavors were a little overwhelming. If I made it again I would simplify either the rub or the glaze.

I loved this recipe. I have made it three times so far. The first time was perfect, the second I accidently put too much of the rub on it. It overpowered the glaze, so beware of that. I paired it with baked yams with all-spice maple butter and it was a perfect fall dinner. The third time I did it using a pork loin instead of chops and I reserved some of the glaze to spoon on to the sliced loin. It was fantastic! Enjoy!

This is a good recipe but nothing special. We didn't think that the rub or the glaze were very strong flavored.

I thought this was an absolutely delicious recipe, even though I did make a couple of changes to the recipe for various reasons. For the rub, I cut way back on the salt (too much in my opinion). I kept only the celery salt and replaced the garlic salt with garlic powder. I also didn't have any onion powder, so went without that. As I unfortunately didn't have any hot smoked paprika, I used regular paprika and added 1/2 tsp. of cayenne to the rub. I also added about a tsp. of cumin just because it sounded like it might add to the rub. The last change I made was to use cran-pomegranate juice in the glaze because that's what I had at home. I don't think any of these changes really compromised the original recipe that much. That said, this was one delicious recipe. As others have said, the contrast of spice with the sweet glaze was amazing. My husband had thirds!

I was so surprised by how well this recipe turned out. Did it on a George Foreman grill with perfect results. You HAVE to eat each bite of pork with a bit of glaze, that spicy/sweet contrast is what makes this recipe. Way to bring back the pork chop. We'll make this for guests next time.

This was one of the best pork recipes I have had. I used a loin instead of chops and roasted it on 325° until it was 150° (just about 30 minutes) and it was superb. We didn't have any leftovers!

My first impression without trying the recipe is that the recipe lacks the number of pork chops and how large they are or what kind. I suppose 8 servings would indicate 8 pork chops?????

Awesome flavor. We served it with grilled butternet squash rounds that were seasoned with cinnamon, garlic and drizzled with olive oil. Wow!!

I used the spice rub (omitting the celery salt and sea salt) and glaze with a 2 1/4 lb boneless pork roast. I smoked it at 210 degrees for 2 1/2 hours, slathering on glaze at 40, 80 and 120 minutes. It was GREAT. Served it with the leftover cranberry sauce, potato slaad and corn on the cob. In a word - YUM. Will do again.

WOW!!! I'd give this 6 stars if I could! The contrast of spicy and sweet was awesome, and the spicy wasn't overpowering, and love it when you take a bite of something and get a kick after swallowing. Didn't have chipoltle powder, so threw all the spices in a food processor with canned chipoltle in adobo (one pepper and a little sauce), added about 1/2 cup of water, and put the mix into a big ziploc with my pork and marinated for a bit. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This sounded like a good one, so I made it for a family gathering. I used two large tenderloins instead of chops, so I doubled the glaze (and the original amount would have been fine...). Absolutely delicious! The sweetness of the glaze against the slight heat of the rub was fantastic! WIll definitely make again -- very easy to make the rub and glaze ahead of time.

What a great grilling recipe. Can make the rub and sauce well in advance which is nice. I used the leftover sauce on chicken and it was delicious. Would definetely make again.

So yummy and easy to make... I didn't add the celery salt or sea salt and added a bit more chili powder and it turned out great! Definitely a do again.

Fast and tasty. Living in Texas I used a lot more chile powder and the combination of chiles and sweet/tart glaze was perfect. Used the left over glaze for dipping sauce with some leftover egg rolls. Going to try this glaze the next time I make a turkey loaf.

My family(including a 6 and an 8 year old) LOVED this dish. I would cut down on the salt products in the rub. It was too salty. The glaze was amazing!

I substituted pork tenderloin very successfully - it was delicious. Served it with red swiss chard & shallots from this site and cornbread stuffing. All in all a great dinner.

Made the recipe as presented using thick boneless pork chops from Sam's Club (our favorite), although I don't think the smoked paprika we used was "hot". Excellent!
