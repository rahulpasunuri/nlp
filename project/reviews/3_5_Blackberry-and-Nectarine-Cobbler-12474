This was MUCH too sweet. I doubled the fruit but only used 1.5 the amount of sugar and starch. It was inedibly sweet and liquidy, the topping was not done after 20 minutes. My advice: taste your fruit and only add very little sugar if it is ripe!

Very Good! Based on other reviews, I used 4 nectarines. I liked it a lot, but my husband and daughter did not care for the almonds. I only had slivered almonds so maybe that is why, and probably the sliced would have been more delicate, but I thought it was very good served with vanilla bean ice cream.

I also tripled the fruit and doubled the rest. I added the almonds to the dough by mistake, rather than sprinkling them, but it added a nice texture to the biscuit. A little sweet for my taste so will use less sugar next time, but otherwise a fantastic recipe.

I loved the way this recipe tasted! Blackberries and nectarine are a great combination. I second those that said they used more of the fruit filling as well as cobbler batter. Next time I make this, I will definitely double (at least) the dough and smooth it out over the top of the fruit mixture. I even thought that it might be good to put a layer of dough in the dish first and then the fruit and then another layer of dough on top. More fruit filling wouldn't hurt either. I will also definitely have some vanilla ice cream/whipped topping on hand for next time also.

The nectarines were a nice touch; simply delicious!

I made a few changes and I would definitely rate this a 4. My husband who has become, I am afraid a bit spoiled , doesn't always comment on my meals. But he swooned over this one, as did my dinner guests. So much so, I just finished making a second one. Here are my changes: I doubled the topping and tripled the filling, but still baked in in the same size pan. Took about 5 min. longer to bake. I added about 1 T. sugar to the topping, used pecans instead of almonds, and sprinkled the topping with coarse sugar prior to baking. Yum. I served it with a whipped creme fraiche topping.Here is that recipe: whip 1/2 c of whipping cream and 1 T. sugar to soft peaks. Stir in 1/2 c. creme fraiche. Continue to beat to stiff peaks. Add 1 t. vanilla.

THIS WAS VERY, VERY GOOD. I DOUBLED THE RECIPE BUT KEPT THE PAN SIZE THE SAME. GREAT RESULTS. LIGHTLY SWEETENING THE BISCUIT PART ADDED TO IT.

Easy and fast. My kids like recipes without seeds betters.

Really good, but almost too sweet. I had *very* ripe blackberries, so I probably should have adjusted the sugar a bit. Terrific with vanilla ice cream.

Beautiful and tasty dish. I have made it for a few years for the fourth of July and it's always a big hit.

Really very nice. My Asian friends ("I don't like anything that's too sweet. . . ") loved this, yet I thought it satisfied my sweet tooth exactly. Made it exactly as is, except with more almonds and brown sugar over the top. Will definitely make this again, but overall I think it's the blend of fruit that makes this so good--I have a better general cobbler dough recipe (in the Pike's Peak Market Cookbook) I use with varied kinds of fillings.
