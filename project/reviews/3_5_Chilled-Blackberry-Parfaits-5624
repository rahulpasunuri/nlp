Made this at Thanksgiving for a new twist on dessert. Used frozen berries and no problem. It was fabulous. Even my son who doesn't really like sweets loved it.

This dessert was really good. The whipped cream went really well with the berries.

The blackberry gelatin was a pain to prepare, but it was worth it! The parfaits were fantastic. I made them for a dinner party and got rave reviews. I used raspberries in place of some of the blackberries, and cranberry juice instead of grape juice.

Great recipe for a hot summers day. I made it with frozen blackberries that a friend was trying to get rid of before the new crop came in. Will make it again very soon.

can't wait to get to the mountains where we can pick fresh berries and try this recipe! sounds much easier and cooler than making them into a pie or cobbler.
