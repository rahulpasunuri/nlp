Simple, flavorful and lovely. Key, however, is not simple to "pat dry" with paper towels, but rather to press them firmly to get rid of as much liquid as possible (leeks are water babies), THEN pat dry. Really recommend serving at room temperature -- flavors are just great.

I omitted the pancetta and substituted balsamic vinegar- great first time attempt at leeks- I will make this again!

I loved the vinaigrette, but used procuitto instead of the pancetta. Also, i used only the white parts of the leeks, and after they were cooked tore them into ribbons and added them to fresh spinach. I then poured the warm dressing over the leeks and raw spinach, and it became a wilted spinach salad with leeks. Really good!

I am willing to admit that maybe I didn't follow the recipe completely correctly. I don't know for sure. But I actually thought it was kind of bland. Even my family thought so. I think if I were to make it again I would try adding some caraway seed to the mix.

I had trouble cleaning the leeks while they were whole, so I wound up slicing them in half lengthwise, which worked out fine. They still stayed together, for the most part, and made an attractive presentation. I thought the sauce tasted a bit sharp, with a touch too much of a bite from the mustard, so I wound up adding a bit more olive oil to temper it. There were no leftovers!

Leeks are my favourite vegetable, so needless to say I hurried to make this dish as soon as I saw it. It was simple, quick, elegant and sublimely tasty. Serving the leeks whole was unusual and really beautiful. A knockout recipe for company or even a random Tuesday night.
