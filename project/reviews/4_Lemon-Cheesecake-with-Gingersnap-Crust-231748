Excellent! BUT, more lemon, less batter! Wish I had read further in the reviews prior to making. Was amazed at the amount of ingredients...cream cheese, eggs, sour cream...should've known!

The best cheesecake recipe. My entire family requests this at least twice a year.

I am a cheesecake fiend, i've tasted so many and baked so many and this one was truly outstanding. This came out incredibly smooth and creamy, not like the drier New York Style cheesecake (which is a good thing, in my opinion). I chose this recipe for 2 main reasons: the fresh lemon and ginger flavor combo, and the large amount of sour cream in the recipe (which is what makes it so soft and creamy and deliciously tangy). Everyone loved this at thanksgiving. I was going to add a homemade raspberry sauce drizzle to the top when I served it but I totally forgot to make it and everyone said it didn't even need it because it was special enough on it's own!

Changes I made: 1. all the reviewers said the ginger wasn't strong enough so I added some crystallized ginger but I found it was too time consuming to dice it up fine and add, so I just added ground ginger to taste until I could taste the ginger before pressing into the pan. 2. filling: I halved everything except sugar (3/4 cup) and I added the zest of 2 lemons (looked like 2 T) and after tasting it add a bit of lemon extract for extra lemony flavour. I baked in a 10"? it's the medium pan in the set of 3. I baked it 45 min and I think I could had baked it less. mostly the guys liked it. I was surprised. they all liked the ginger crust.

I love this cheesecake, and have been making it for years. It is exceptionally light and fluffy, and is always a crowd pleaser. It is true, it makes way too much batter for a 9 inch cheesecake, but this, in my opinion, is not a problem. I have found this recipe will make 1 9" cheesecake, and three mini/individual sized ones. Or, it will make 2 8" cakes, and an individual one...you get the idea, you can play around with it. I've also made one cheesecake, refrigerated the batter for a few days, then brought it to room temp to bake a few minis. As someone who bakes often for events and whatnot, this is a very useful and adaptable recipe. I do recommend finely chopping the lemon zest after grating it. You won't have the problem of it sticking to the paddle if you do.

i should have read this prior to making the cheesecake. not lemony enough and way too much batter.

Rating: 3
RIDICULOUS recipe. i listened to previous posters and halved it and had more than enough for a 9 inch springform. i also took another tip and increased the zest for a more lemony flavor. (like another poster, i too found gobs of zest had become caught on the paddle, which i was careful to scrape free and stir into the batter. i'm sure it helped.) as nutty as the amount the actual recipe produces, the finished product is, as others have noted, surprisingly light and utterly delicious. as like the best cheesecake i've ever tasted! and i made it! wow. (and it looked as good as it tasted!) if not for the fact that the ingredient amounts weren't so dramatically miscalculated, i would have felt bad giving it only 4 forks. just be sure to cut the recipe in half or have a second pan prepared for the overflow!

It just goes to show that you should always listen to experienced cooks. Too much filling and too little lemon. Cut down on the sour cream and eggs. I had three extra servings of filling. The crust benefited from the addition of crystalized ginger ground into the gingersnaps. This cake was much better two days later.

Rating: 4
Like all the others, I agree that this recipe makes a bit too much batter--it barely fit in the mixer. I solved the problem by lining cupcake papers with gingersnaps and making individual cheesecakes in muffin tins with the extra. It also needed a bit more lemon zest. That said, it was amazing--one of the best I've made. Rave reviews all around--baked without a crack and turned out perfectly! A++ And thanks to all the people who take time to write reviews--they are super helpful!

I made this for Easter and it is the most decadent cheescake I have ever eaten. It got rave reviews from everybody! I made a raspberry sauce and a lemon sauce to serve with it...there were only a few slices left over and they went home with a firefighter friend so he could have another "taste"....

This recipe is easy and delicious. I made it with 1/2 low-fat cream cheese and light sour cream and I couldn't tell the difference. It wasn't quite lemony enough for me, so next time I will add just a bit more lemon.

Rating: 4
This was delicious and if you are prepared for the amount of batter that it produces, you will be fine. A 10" pan is better and you need to use a REALLY big bowl to mix it. I had to transfer it mid way to a bigger bowl. Cook for @ 1 hour 20 mins. I did not really taste the ginger in the crust which is what drew me to the recipe but would do it again the same way, maybe try a different brand of cookie. I served it with a blueberry preserve that I made and it was delicious. Great for a crowd.

This was my first cheesecake attempt and the results were terrific! I could not be more pleased. I followed the advice of previous posters and halved the recipe. Worked out perfectly. I am making this recipe again this evening for my co-worker, Nilesh, who's birthday we are celebrating tomorrow at work. This time I am using limes instead of lemons.

Great cheesecake recipe. Used 10 x 3 inch springform and halved the recipe; perfect for small dinner party. Also used lime instead of lemon (so nice with the ginger flavor) and lite cream cheese, sugared limes on top. A keeper, for sure.

I loved this cheescake. Made it just as directed and added a raspberry sauce (strained frozen raspberries with a splash of creme de cassis) drizzled over each slice with a sprig of mint and 3 fresh raspberries on top. It was a smash hit with 12 guests.

I substituted lime for lemon and made the best cheesecake I have ever had. I used a 10" springform pan to hold all the batter. Came out better when I blended the eggs in last and did not beat them too much. It did not look done at 1 hour and 25 minutes, but it was fine when it cooled.

Rating: 4
After listening to other cooks, I changed the following ingredients:; 4 1/2 cr ch, 1/1/2 cup sugar, 5 lg eggs, 2 cups sour cream, extra zest, and other ingredients the same as receipe calls for. Oh, used a chocolate cookie crust as we love lemon and chocolate together. It fit into 10"x3" springform pan perfect. Baked 1 hr 5 mins. It also came out PERFECT. Melted in your mouth. Kathy

TASTY! This is a really excellent cheesecake and was devoured by my coworkers. My only complaint: as called for, these directions create way too much filling. I used a 9-in springform pan filled to the brim but ended up pouring a lot down the sink. boo hoo.

I made this exactly to the recipe, except I used a 10 inch pan with 3 inch sides. I used all of the batter and found that it required 2 hours of baking time, but it turned out perfectly! The lemon flavor is wonderful, and the texture light and delicious. Of note: when I blended the cream cheese mixture in my standing mixer, the lemon zest, for some reason, kept sticking to the beater. I scraped it all back into the batter then whisked it through the mix before filling the pan. Perhaps that is why others felt the lemon flavor was too mild. We loved it!

This cake came out absolutely perfect! I was a little worried about the amount of batter after reading the reviews, but I used a 10-inch springform pan and it came out just right. I cooked it for exactly 1-1/2 hours, and it came out perfect. One note of caution -- leave the cake uncovered until it has completely cooled. I put a sheet of foil over it a little too soon before putting it in the fridge and ended up with a few cracks on the cake's creamy smooth top! But thanks to the tip from the cook from Copenhagen, I covered them with sugared lemon slices, and it looked -- and tasted -- great! This is a keeper.

Move out of the way! You will have people running back for seconds. I reviewed the other reviews first. Decided to take advantage of the extra batter by making two cakes instead of one; one regular size cake for the dinner party & one for the family. Had to make a second crust for the smaller one. I love lemon so I added more lemon juice & lemon zest. I used the cherry sauce from the rice pudding recipe from this site over it. Big hit for a summer party.

This got rave reviews!! I cut the filling amount in half and used half light cream cheese. I included 2T of lemon zest but even so it still doesn't taste very lemony. I would add anothe T or maybe 2 next time. I used "triple ginger" snaps from Trader Joe's which made a superlative crust. When it was too late I realized my springform was 10 1/4". This made it hard to waterproof the pan with foil...at that point I realized why the smaller pan is necessary! 1 hr 25 minutes was plenty, maybe even a few minutes too long given the smaller amount of filling.

Rating: 3
I used lowfat cream cheese & lowfat sourcream. In addition, I cut the recipe in half,except for the crust part & it worked out PERFECTLY!!! For the 7 eggs to be cut in 1/2 I used 3 & for the 4th egg I wisked the whole egg in a dish & just measured out 1/2 of that for a total of 3 1/2 eggs. It still tastes very rich........can't imagine what it would taste like with full fat sour cream & cream cheese. I made it for my book club & all loved....it was a nice addition to the book "Angry Housewives Eating Bon Bons"....

This cheesecake was a huge hit! The only real issue was that there was WAY too much batter, I should have read the previous reviews closer to know how to avoid it. Other than that the whole thing was eaten in a period of 1 hour, even one person who doesn't like cheesecake ate some and liked it. It turned out wonderful and light not dense like many comercial cheesecakes. I would highly recomend this, just cut all the ingredients in half!

My guests loved it and commented that it was light and looked so impressive. I used a 12" springform pan which was perfect. I added more grated lemon peel. The top was brown (not like the picture) which I didn't like so covered it with whipped cream and sugared lemon slices. I would definitely make it again. I think the recipe could be halved and made in a smaller pan.

The cheesecake was lightly, lemony so I added more lemon peel to, I guess, "zest" it up. Everyone LOVED it!

This recipe definitely yields waaay more filling than is necessary--next time I'll play around and reduce everything by about a quarter but the lemon zest and juice (which could even be increased a wee bit). But there will be a next time--this is a great cheesecake. Gingersnap crust was a stroke of genius--made the recipe special. No way anyone could mistake this for a generic store-bought cheesecake. Tres yummy.

I made this cheesecake for Easter and it was delicious, but I agree with others that there is way too much filling. My pan was the size specified in the recipe and the sides were three inches, but I was left with much excess batter. I also had to bake longer than recommended in the recipe. But knowing those glitches, I will definitely try this again.

Rating: 3
The cheesecake itself was superb - light (for a cheesecake) and full of flavor. However, if I made it again, I would make some changes to the crust - which contrast too much with the cheesecake both in terms of texture and flavor. It was hard and the ginger taste to sharp of a contrast. Next time I would add some graham crackers to the ginger snaps to soften the texture and the flavor. The hot water bath was perfect - the top did not crack and the cheesecake cooked evenly as a result.

I did not have the appropriately sized pan so I had to pour out some of the filling. However, the flavor was fantastic. For something so rich it was surprisingly light and airy. I will make this again...for a crowd.

This was totally incredible! As per the directions, I made sure my 9" pan was 3 inches deep and had no trouble whatsoever. It was filled to the brim and I had to handle it very carefully getting it into the oven, but once there it was fine. It puffs up during cooking, but it's partially solidified by then, so it's going up and not over!It looked exactly like a "Cheesecake Factory" cheesecake -- gorgeous top and sides, and I garnished with lemon leaves and lemon blossoms! Everybody raved about how beatiful it was, even my 18 year old son who never comments about how desserts look - just how they taste! Anyway the taste was stellar, but the lemon flavor is so mild about half of us couldn't taste the lemon at all. I'd increase the lemon zest by at least half if you want a distinct lemon flavor. Everyone at the table said this was the best cheesecake they'd EVER had, bar none! All that said, I had a bit of trouble w/the crust. I don't know if I patted it too firmly into the pan, or if I overcooked it during pre-baking, but the crust was very difficult to cut while serving. I had to get my sharpest chef's knife and exert major pressure to slice it through! Once on the plate, the fork tines were able to slice it, but I'd guess I did something wrong here as I've never encountered this problem w/cheesecakes I've baked before. And I had to bake it an addt'l 15 minutes to get the cheesecake to "move only slightly when pan is shaken", so that might have had something to do w/the crust, also. The filling was not overcooked, however. I will definitely bake this again and again, even if the crust turns out the same way.

I agree, there was entirely too much filling for a 9" springform pan - you could almost cut the filling in half and still have a decent sized cheesecake. Even though there is alot of cream cheese/sour cream, we found the dessert to be very light and not heavy at all. It was a hit!

Rating: 3
Delicous!! I will make it again and again. Yes, the first time I used a 9 inch pan and ended up making 2 cheesecakes there was so much batter. The next time I used an 11 inch springform pan and had just a tiny bit left over. Didn't need more crust since it just goes on the bottom but did cook it about 30 min longer. Added more zest and served with a raspberry sauce. Everyone raved!

I haven't made this, but have read the reviews and have an observation. It sounds SO good, but obviously there are objections to the amount of filling, and the resulting added calories and fat. Cheesecake will always be an indulgence, but I think I might try using my gold standard of cheesecake (the one on the Philadelphia Cream Cheese box!), substituting the gingersnap crust and adding the lemon zest and juice to the filling. Can't wait to try it--the flavors sound delicious.

To cook from Minnesota, re confusion about the Test Kitchen Tips on springform pan. Apparently there is also a removable-bottom cheesecake pan that is NOT springform, and that is what the directions first suggest using. No difference in size between the two. Still, this does sound like a mega-amount of cheesecake for that size pan.

This was absolutely delicious! It got rave reviews & numerous recipe requests at the baby shower I made it for. I have never made a cheesecake before, and the recipe was easy to follow & delicious. I do need a larger bowl for the batter though - it was overflowing my large mixing bowl. Also, the crust was delicious - next time I will add more cookie crumbs/butter - there was too little crust for all that cheesecake.

This is a remarkable cheesecake. It's decadent, beautiful and overwhelming... Just like dessert SHOULD be. I used a 12" Springform and it BARELY fit... I've no idea how high a 9" would have been. The texture and flavor are perfect, as is the crust. My only warning is to really make sure that it's completely set. An hour and 25 minutes was not nearly long enough.

I loved this recipe. It had a wonderful light flavor and the cake came out perfectly. I used a 9 inch springform, and all of the batter fit fine...not sure what the others are referring to. Granted, it was most likely the largest cheesecake I've ever made, but when would that be a bad thing! My husband loved it so much he had 3 pieces in one sitting...and he is lactose intolerant!

Like the other cooks, there was far too much filling for the 9" springform pan. I ended up using my additional filling with leftover crumbs to make a second smaller cheesecake in a pan. Although the cheesecake is lovely, the recipe seems a little "big". You don't want to serve guests this massive slice of cheesecake as a sliver, and to serve a regular slice would be overkill.

The lemon flavor was delightful and very spring-like, but nothing out of the ordinary - and it was VERY rich. I ended up with too much filling and had to use another crustless pan for the overflow. I'm not sure the extra sour cream (and calories and fat) added to the end-product in a positive manner. I have other cheesecake recipes that my family prefers.

Wonderful cheesecake .. rich and delicious. I think maybe what some may not realize is that considering the richness of this recipe its made to be eaten in small amounts .. if you note, its 16 servings .. there are other good cheesecake recipes but they arent quite as rich and dont have a true cheesecake consistency ... therefore people usually have a much larger serving, which means your intake of cholesterol and fat wont be that much different than a normal serving on this one.

Rating: 3
The recipe is delicious, but I have other cheesecake recipes that taste just as rich and creamy but that use MUCH less cream cheese (2-3 packages rather than 5) and much less cream (3 cups of sour cream???) and fewer eggs (7??). This recipe is only for people with negative cholesteral levels!
