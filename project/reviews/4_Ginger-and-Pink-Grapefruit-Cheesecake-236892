I was very nervous about making this cheesecake. The ginger sounded overwhelming to me, and not everyone likes grapefruit... I actually added the powdered ginger a tsp at a time tasting the batter, thinking it would be to much, and it wasn't. I used the ginger jelly ( its not really that sweet, and its more of a glaze for the fruit than anything else.) I also didnt have the right tin foil, so i wrapped the cheesecake in the foil i had and put a water bath in a lower rack. The cheesecake came out perfectly moist throughout, subtle ginger flavor that enhanced the cheesecake rather than competed with it. Really lovely flavor. Everyone loved it. I think if I make it again, I may experiment with raspberries on top instead of grapefruit. I also forgot the sugar in the crust which although may have made it a little more flakey, I liked that the crust wasn't sweet...probably a personal thing. Definitely recommend trying this one.

Rich and succulent, tart and tasty, there is a plethora of words available to describe this cake. The bottom line is, it's wonderful! The only trepidation is the amount of ginger and the combination of the jelly with the cake, it might be too sickiningly sweet. I opted for a sour cream glaze instead of the jelly, and it was fantastic!

I just finished my first slice of this cheesecake and I am struggling to find the words that will give this dessert proper justice. It's absolutely incredible; probably one of the best confections I have ever had. CERTAINLY the best cheesecake I've ever had. I made the filling exactly as instructed. However, due to a gluten intolerance, I substituted gluten-free gingersnaps for the graham crackers, and omitted the crystalized ginger from the crust. As others have pointed out, purchasing pre-sliced grapefruit will save you a lot of time without sacrificing any flavor. I picked two jars up from the refrigerated section in my local grocery store. I must admit that I was slightly wary of all the ginger this recipe called for. Grapefruit and ginger are a lovely marriage of flavors, but I was worried that the ginger might be too overpowering. So, instead of brushing my cake with the ginger jelly, I threw it into my mixer with some confectioners sugar and the grapefruit juice I reserved from the jars - creating a glaze. I really wasn't expecting it to turn out as delicious as it was. Fantastic recipe - will be making again and again.

Just dropping in to say if you want to section your own grapefruit, you can purchase a knife specifically for this purpose -- it makes the task a lot easier. It's small like a paring knife and the tip is curved so you can get under the sections.

This cheesecake is phenomenal. I'll definitely try to buy the grapefruit that is already peeled the next time as I found that to be one of the most time consuming parts of this recipe. I made it for a dinner party and it was the perfect desert to finish off our roast chicken dinner.

this cheesecake was really good and not /that/ difficult to make, if you use prepared grapefruit. i also omitted the ginger preserves and crystallized ginger, preferring to just infuse the cream with the fresh ginger. this gave the filling a subtle gingery flavor that wasn't too overpowering. overall, delicious. it's become a family favorite.

I had to mske this twice. The first time I mistakenly used an 8 inch pan and had to toss a lot of the cream cheese mix. The second time I still had to toss a bit....anyway, it turned out great. I didn't use the water bath either. I couldn't find ginger preserves, instead used orange marmalade. I also sprinkled some fresh grated nutmeg and shredded coconut on top. Made this for (a potential) boyfriend and his fellow fire department. They were anticipating the dessert and were very happy with it.

This is one of our favorite desserts. We make it several times a year. Always delicious! It is worth the time and effort.

I took this to a party & the people who tried it loved it. The general consensus was to try mandarin oranges instead of the grapefruit so I may go that direction next time. The actual cheeseacke turned out well even though I didn't go the surround cake pan with water route. Took a good 3 hours to make so plan to spend some time in the kitchen but it was fun & I'll do an abridged version of it again.

This was my first cheesecake and disappeared immediately and my office holiday party - so delicious. I agree with a previous reviewer that buying prepared grapefruit will save you time in preparation! The most challenging part for me was finding ginger preserves - I visited 4 grocery stores and was about to make a trip to a specialty store out of town before someone suggested Cost Plus/World Market, which I'd never heard of before. That said, I definitely plan on making this recipe again.

I made this recipe for a dinner party and everyone (even one who said they didn't like grapefruit) loved it. The flavors are wonderful together. The only thing I did differently, was that I used already-sectioned grapefruit that I purchased from the grocery store. The fruit comes in a jar and is located in the refrigerated section of the produce dept. That made things SO much easier and saved a bunch of time! Also, the presentation was much better than it would have been had I tried to section the fruit!

I made this dish for an office Christmas party. The flavor was excellent and it was a huge hit. My only complaint was that peeling the grapefruit for the topping was a huge ordeal. Maybe the grapefruit wasn't ripe enough? Anyway, although this was great, it was a lot of work, and didn't really impress me more than other, easier cheesecakes I've made previously.
