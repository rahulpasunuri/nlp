I agree that different kinds of seeds would work for this. Used sesame and poppy only, as I had no flax seeds. Will add cumin seeds next time. Used only half the salt, but I think the full 1 tsp. would be even better, especially if you're serving them with drinks.

Delicious... however, I added more then 1 tsp salt. But that's just me... I'm a salt junkie.

This was such an easy recipe to make, and with such wonderful results. The chips were light and crispy and perfect for dipping!

It's silly to rate a recipe if you didn't follow it at all (like substituting cheese for seeds, which would totally change the effect of the recipe).. Additions or suggestions are great, but if your creativity didn't work out, don't blame the recipe. :)

Be sure and add a little garlic salt, paprika, and frest parmesan cheese. Flax seed is so good for us. These are delicious.

Excellent "chips" - goes with Charred Tomatillo Guacamole very well. I'd perhaps add a sprinkle of medium-coarse salt over them just before baking next time.

We substitued parmesan cheese for seeds. They present well for a party, taste good, but are not great. They might have been better if they were served fresh out of the oven and with a good dipping sauce.

Simple to make and nice presentation. They taste pretty good. I also tried grated parmesan cheese as a topping instead of seeds and it turned out well.

Good party food. Any manner of seed can be substituted. My kids liked using a cheese-type dip for these "chips". We liked them and will add them to our "game day" and "family-days" snacks.
