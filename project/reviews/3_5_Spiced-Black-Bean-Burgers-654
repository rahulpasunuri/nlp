Loved them! I have never tried black bean burgers and I was definitely impressed. I would agree that they don't hold together very well but I ate mine on top of baby romaine lettuce instead of a bun. Definitely will make these again! Next time I will add more spice to them.

Yummy burgers, but they really don't hold together very well. I added 1/3 cup of dry breadcrumbs, which seemed to help, and I also mashed only half the beans to give the burgers a bit more texture. Also make sure to really drain the beans as much as possible.

Rating: 4
This is an awesome burger recipe. I only mashed about half of the beans and then mixed in the whole beans with the other ingredients. That seemed to help keep them from being too mushy. I usually fry them on a lightly oiled pan for a few minutes a side and then top with pepper jack cheese, sliced avacado and pico de gallo. I double the recipe and freeze the extras for easy week night meals.

I wanted to keep all the ingredients fresh so I added 1/4 of a tomato, a couple sprigs of cilantro and the juice of one lime together instead of "salsa." I also added mushrooms and an extra 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs like someone else had recommended. I cooked them in a sauce pan on the stove top because I do not have a BBQ and my broiler was not working and they turned out delicious! I cooked them for about 5 minutes on each side like someone recommended. I had problems with them falling apart so next time I might add the egg and may add more breadcrumbs.

These burgers are great. Healthy, simple, and super tasty. I broiled mine for three minutes on each side, but I thought the needed some extra time so I turned my oven down to 400 and let them bake for 5 extra minutes. They came out perfect! Make sure to use a smaller chop for the onion so you can taste all of the other flavors. Delicious!

The burgers were a hit. I made quite a few changes based on other reviews. I used prepared black beans (Trader Joes has "Cuban style" with seasoning and diced peppers). Since I couldn't get all of the liquid drained, I added an extra 1/4 cup of bread crumbs. I also added one beaten egg, garlic powder, a dash of cayenne pepper, 1/8 cup of cooked brown rice and a few tablespoons of finely chopped mushrooms. After cooking for a few minutes in the pan, I stuck them in the broiler for 5 minutes, adding a slice of cheese to melt. The burgers held together well, and had great flavor.

I've been craving a black bean burger for ages (for a fantastic one in Seattle, it up Charlie's. I'm just not in Seattle as much anymore!) Anyway, this one looked like it fit the bill but ended up being mushy and falling apart. Maybe not enough bread crumbs? For what it's worth, I added fresh jalapeno and garlic to mine, and topped with a thin slice of cheddar, fresh salsa & guacamole (look up food network mag's "Perfect Guacamole" for, quite literally, PERFECT guacamole!

This recipe was delicious. My vegetarian son loved them and so did the meat lovers. I broiled them 3 minutes each side and that worked great. Next time I will grill them. We had fresh guacamole that we used as a condiment. Definitely will be making these on a regular basis!

These burgers are an awesome. They are easy and a real party pleaser with a wholewheat bun. Just because I don't really keep salsa in the house, I chop a couple of tomatoes and some extra onions to supplement the real salsa. We pull hot peppers from the garden when they're around to add some kick, but are also very happy dumping in extra tabasco sauce. These burgers seriously never fail to satisfy and they're great to whip up for low-key guests. Also, I think my boyfriend would devour all four to five servings on his own if it didn't have to feed me too, haha. So gooood.

So easy and good! Great if you're looking for a full-flavor veggie burger, just up the cumin until you're happy with it! I finish mine in the oven so they stay together a bit better.

There were a few changes that I made to this recipe. First, it seemed a little labour-intensive to mash beans with a fork, so I simply put them in the food processor for a few seconds. Then I added the breadcrumbs, red onion, salsa, cumin, and Tabasco. To that I also added some garlic powder, and chili powder. They were pretty good with some delicious homemade guacamole and lots of mayo. Instead of barbequing, I did them in the broiler. Also, like many others, I added an egg. However, it may not have been necessary because they were already pretty thick. It made six regular-sized patties, much more than the two the recipe claims to yeild. Note that I used a 19 oz can of black beans and adjusted the other ingredients accordingly, though.

These are always a huge hit at a bar-b-que! I coat mine in a mixture of flax seeds, sesame seeds and a bit of wheat germ, then I pan fry a bit; this helps to hold them together for grilling, along with the addition of an egg white to the mixture. The kids love them too!

Rating: 3
These are quick & delicious - but I couldn't get mine to stay together either. I pan fried them, and even the tiny ones from from 1 tbsp of mixture fell apart. I forgot the onion, maybe that made a big difference? They were really dry, so I'm not sure what happened. I may try an egg next time like other reviewers suggested. The flavor of the mixture really gets better once it's cooked.

I cooked 1 cup of dried black beans. I added 1/2 a chopped white onion, 2 minced garlic cloves, chili powder, cumin, salt, oregano, & some salsa. I didn't have any breadcrumbs so I added 1/4 cup of fiber one cereal. They turned out great & totally held together in patty shapes! Loved them! I also kept some in small crumbles and made burritos. So good!

Rating: 3
i doubled this recipe and somehow ended up with eight (super-tasty) burgers. like other cooks, i added an egg to help glue it all together (and a bit of wheat germ for the heck of it). served the burgers slathered with my own quick guac on whole wheat buns and paired with baked sweet potato fries--we almost forgot they were good for us!

I made the burgers into mini sliders.. This recipe yielded 4 mini burgers for me. I also topped with jack cheese and made a mango and kiwi salsa as a topping instead of the bottled salsa. Hamburger buns were replaced with pretzel rolls that were made at a local bakery. YUM!

Rating: 4
i thought these were a fabulous meatless option for a bbq. really flavorful. i made the recipe as is, but did make sure the beans were really dry before mashing. to mash i used a hand held masher--i was a little worried about them holding together, but they did fine. in addition to topping with the salsa, i spread some homemade guacamole on the buns (just because i had it to use). they were delicious.

Rating: 3
Because other reviewers mentioned trouble with burger cohesion, I made two changes to the recipe. I dried the beans after rinsing them and left the burgers in the fridge for about 6 hours. I'm not sure if those changes did the trick, but the burgers worked out well on the grill. The flavor was pretty good, but was a little boring. It needed the help of some good condiments. I mixed 1/4 cup mayo, juice of 1/2 a lime, and a heaping tablespoon of chopped cilantro (idea from another veggie burger recipe on epicurious), which went well with the burger. The only trouble I had was that the burger was mushy. So, it was squishing its way out of the bun.

Yummy burgers! I didn't have any dried breadcrumbs, so I crumbled up 3 saltines and added them. I pulsed it all a few times in the food processor. This recipe makes either two HUGE burgers or 3 more normal sized ones.

These are delicious and easy to make. I had no trouble forming them into patties which held together for grilling- I mashed the beans until they were almost a paste, so maybe they just require lots of mashing. I recommend making these into small patties because they are very filling!

It's absolutely delicious. They didn't form patties at all for me, so I cooked it all together and ate them in soft tortilla shells rather than on a bun. This is by far my favorite black bean "burger" recipe.

I must have done something wrong because I could not form this into patties to save my life. It was tasty though and I ended up putting the cooked bean stuff into romaine lettuce leaves as "black bean boats" (topped with avocado and salsa). I thought it was fun. My boyfriend didn't enjoy my "boats" or the fact that it was so crumbly.

I am absolutely in love with these veggie burgers. In order to be able to put them on the BBQ, I added an egg as well as doubled the breadcrumbs. I also added in about 1/2 cup frozen corn. Topped off with 1) mashed avocado seasoned with lemon juice and salt and, 2) homemade salsa (which is what I used in the burgers as well). Meat- loving boyfriend adored them. DELISH!!

For all those people looking for a flavorful, cheap, and easy recipe to make, this would be it. I had the main problem that many of the people had with this recipe and that was that it fell apart. The first attempt I made it had trouble staying together and in the bun it was very soft. I tried making it a second time adding egg. It was stronger while cooking it and still soft in bun, but still held together. I also cooked it in a skillet and cant imagine cooking it directly on the grill . So why four stars? It was simply delicious. Much more flavor than a Boka burger, and easily adaptable. For instance, one time I used red onions and the next I used a white, simply what I had but still worked with the recipe. It is really easy to make, very filling, as well as quick and once you have the initial spices, it is very cheap, the perfect meal for a college student (I should know). If the softness bothers you for some reason, just imagine it as a cleaner sloppy Joe, although it wasnt that dirty. Or you can try making smaller patties, which gives it a better chance of sticking together. Additionally, I added garlic powder and recommend it or garlic itself.

I cut the recipe in half and got 2 pretty good sized burgers from that. This is a really good simple recipe.

You know, when I first looked at this recipe, I thought it was going to be tasteless and boring based on the few ingredients. I was wrong! This was very good, and I really enjoyed it with roated sweet potato fries and a nice green salad. I did leave out the bread crumbs due to a diet restriction, and added a little more hot sauce (Sriracha - my favorite) Makes a great easy weekday meal!

Big hit with the hubby. Pretty much made the recipe as is, except I browned in a pan instead of grilling. My patties were smaller, too, more like flattened meatballs, so that they wouldn't fall apart (they are soft). Served in pita pockets with mashed avocado mixed with salsa, as suggested.

Really delicious and easy. I had some leftover brown rice which I threw in along with a bunch of fresh cilantro. It did fall apart pretty easily although I had doubled the breadcrumbs. I think I'll try an egg nxt time. My four year old loved it .(I just called it a burger) I think the beauty of this one is you can pretty much add and delete what you want.

I really enjoyed this receipe. I pretty much made it as listed. I mashed an avacado and mixed the extra salsa with that and used it as a topping. It started to rain just as I was ready to cook so I did them in a skillet. They are very soft and do squish out of the bun. I think next time I will try the half a pita bread to keep it contained. I do not think I would get either my son or my husband to like these but it makes for a quick easy and healthy lunch for me.

These are delicious and so easy to make. I have made them twice in 2 weeks. The first time using extra restaurant salsa and the second time using the August 1998 "Fresh Tomato Salsa" recipe on this site. Both times, I added 1 egg and doubled the amount of bread crumbs. I also didn't really read through the recipe and dumped the salsa in the mixture. That made it a little hard to work with but it seems like this is a common problem. In order for the burgers to stay together, I put them in the refrigerator for about 20-30 minutes after forming the burgers. I then baked the burgers on a greased roasting pan at 375 degrees until brown on both sides (about 15-20 minutes on each side). The burgers held together nicely. Put a little extra salsa on top; we didn't even eat these with buns.

I added bell peppers, cilantro, and carrots along with some garlic, chili, and cayenne powder to make nice and spicy. Screw canned salsa! They did fall apart, but next time I would add an egg or a ground flax and water substitute to make it gel then pan fry. 1 Tbsp. ground flax seeds + 3 Tbsp water (or other liquid) = 1 egg They're not meat but they're delisiouc

This was easy and tasty. I did follow the suggestions of adding extra spice and bread crumbs. i cooked mine in fry pan so didnt have trouble with burgers falling apart. One suggestion for on the grill is to wrap burgers in foil - then you eliminate the worry of them falling apart. Yum!

These were great.A nice change from soy/grain burgers and so quick and easy to prepare.I used cracker meal,a little better 'n egg product.I omitted salsa adding fresh chopped jalapeno,cilantro and minced garlic.I also added some jerk seasoning powder.I think it is better to mash beans with fork rather than using food processor as there is more texture.It is also a good idea to let them chill so flavors can blend.I made the burgers on the thin side,as there are very filling and cook better.

This was good. I think I prefer grain-based burgers, but the bf liked these better. The texture was a nice change from grain burgers. For those former-meat-eaters, this has a more burger-like appearance than most veg burgers. I omitted the hot sauce & only added 1/2 the cumin (plus some Mrs. Dash) so it wasn't too spicy for me. This made 3 patties for me. I pan fried in a touch of veg oil after baking ~10 minutes. I'd give it 2.5 forks if I could because it certainly wasn't "delicious", but just 2 forks seemed too low. They *were* tasty. Also, I didn't find these too dry at all! And although I was gentle with them, I think they would have fell apart if I had grilled them or been rougher flipping. They stayed together, but when eating it squished out the sides of the bun. This is why I would suggest making larger, but thinner, patties.

I love this recipe. It is so easy and yummy. Usually I will make a few burgers to take with me to BBQ's for my fellow vegetarians, who are often left out of the main meal. People love these burgers. The spice level is easy to adjust, you can always add nuts, egg, more bread, depending on what you are looking for. I usually cook them in very hot oil for 1 min on each side and then grill them to reheat at parties. They last for a very long time in the fridge.

delish. sauteed onions, added wocestershire and egg white, a little more crumb, cumin, and salsa (used pace medium). have to say bacon really made this thing come together taste-wise tho. added to the final sandwich and sauteed the patties in a bit of the grease. yum yum. nope, I'm not a vegetarian, just cutting down on meat a bit. mine stayed together very well.

I am not a vegan but do order these in restaurants when offered. Great alternative to turkey burgers and tasty. I too used my George Foreman grill and they did get a little soft but very good. Possibly next time I will brush with egg whites or egg substitute and dip in bread crumbs; lightly spray then grill. Very good - alternatives could be adding corn or finely chopped zucchini. Low fat cheese on top is also good.

as a previous carnivore, but now vegetarian, it is so difficult to find recipes which are 1)Quick, 2)Easy, 3)Cheap, 4)Filling, and 5)Don't call for breads or pastas or gunks of cheese which can be terribly fattening!

Oh, and I followed advice of others to add more bread crumbs as well as egg whites to build up the consistency...perfect!! :)

even though plans are for a casual dinner, i wanted to make sure these would work... so i made a scant 2 patties with limited ingredients just to get an idea for taste and texture. it turned out well, and i imagine it will be much better when i do the whole show. for now, i just threw main ingredients together, used seasoned bread crumbs, some peppers and made my own 3 minute salsa with tomatoes, lemon juice, onions, garlic, green onions and cilantro. extra breadcrumbs solved the crumbly problem, but to be safe, i may add an extra eggwhite. a touch of worcestershire sauce is nice, too. but keep the black bean flavour! speaking of which, i used dry beans rather than canned, i think the firmer texture helps with keeping the patties together. anyway, i'm now officially excited to serve these delicious burgers in a day or two.

My husband and I made these for dinner last night using a very hot salsa and topped them with fresh sliced avocado and the burgers were delicious! We did find that they lost their shape on the grill. Next time I think I will prepare the patties and thoroughly freeze them; then partially thaw them for grilling. Perhaps then they might hold their shape better? Overall a tasty and easy recipe!

These were SO fast and easy to make and they were delicious! I added extra tabasco and a little cinnamon. I also used about 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs which helps to make them more firm.

I suppose these are better for you than the chemical-laden frozen veggie burgers you can get at the store, but they definitely taste weird. I think a tofu-based burger with black beans IN it would taste better than simply mushing up beans into a paste and grilling it. And what's the point of the breadcrumbs?

Like everyone else has sais, very fast, very easy. I used homemade salsa that I had on hand and extra cumin. I also topped the burger with mango salsa (I think the Epicurious recipe from 1998) and it was fabulous. I will definitely make a bunch a freeze them for easy dinners.

We couldn't get the burgers to hold together on the grill, so next time I think I would take the advice of the earlier reviewer and pan fry them. However, the mixture was wonderful and we ended up eating it as a dip with chips! I would omit the bread crumbs if I were to make it just as a dip.

Delicious! Everyone at the dinner table loved them. We varied from the recipe a bit. We sauteed the onions to take the raw edge off them and also took another cook's suggestion and used pulverized tortilla chips in place of the bread crumbs. Additionally, we sauteed the burgers instead of grilling. It added a nice crisp texture to the outside and while it added calories, it also added a lot of flavor. If you're not vegetarian, try sauteeing them in bacon drippings. The smokey taste is great. One last note: be careful in your choice of salsas -- there's a lot in there, so make sure it's a salsa you love.
