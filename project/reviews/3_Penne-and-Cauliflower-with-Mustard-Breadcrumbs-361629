Thought this was just okay -- a bit on the bland side. The next day, eating leftovers for lunch -- added grated gruyere cheese and microwaved (breadcrumbs were mixed in with the pasta & cauliflower) to reheat --- and it was FABULOUS!

Unfortunately, I found this quite bland and unexciting, despite being a fan of all the ingredients. There are better things to do with cauliflower out there.

to the phoenix cook - the cream is in the 3rd paragraph "Add 3/4 cup grated Parmesan, cream, lemon peel, and 1/2 cup cooking liquid to pasta mixture..."

Totally gross. I can't even imagine anyone liking this dish. If you make it, halve the breadcrumbs, totally dried out the dish.

Tasty, easy, but: the predominant flavor in "Penne and Cauliflower with Mustard Breadcrumbs" is . . . LEMON. I'll definitely make again, but cut lemon zest WAY down and add more mustard to pasta along with cream.

So, where does the whipping cream come into this recipe? It's in the ingredient list but not in the directions. I guess I make a roux out of it?

Quick and easy, good flavor, pretty healthy. Used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of whipping cream, because it was what I had in the fridge - still turned out well.

Fabulous! Never would have paired caulifower and pasta in a hundred years but OMG! Delicious. I used leftover roasted cauliflower from Cauliflower with Mustard Lemon Butter instead of as this recipe called for. Tasted great! Now one of my go to recipes. Make extra cauliflower because you will be nibbling it before you make the pasta. I usually do 2-3 heads at a time. Used farfalle instead of penne. Breadcrumbs really make the dish. I use extra lemon but then I eat lemon slices with salt. Adjust to your taste. Thought mustard with cauliflower would be disgusting but NO. It's great.

Don't expect a miracle - make this if you think you will like pasta with cauliflower. It's the crumbs that make it passable - a full dijon flavor.

Really a wonderfully comforting dish & Very easy to make. Also, the simple breadcrumbs would make a great batter for chicken for a salad.

I was looking for a recipe that was simple and fast but this exceeded my expectations. I'd definitely make this one again and have added it to my recipe box.

A little on the bland side for my tastes. It was yummy, but not something I'd make again.

Absolutely delicious! Made a few changes to make it fit better into our South Beach Diet lifestyle. I used olive oil instead of butter; whole wheat penne and crumbs, and fat free half and half for cream. We will enjoy this again, especially in the fall when cauliflower is plentiful and inexpensive.

Really good and really easy! Ill half the recipe next time and also use less Penne. The sauce was just enough richness without over doing it.

Filling, yet light in flavour. I used unsalted butter and I had to substitute 1 cup of crushed multi-grain crackers.

The consensus is that the dish is delicious: rich yet surprisingly light in flavour.
