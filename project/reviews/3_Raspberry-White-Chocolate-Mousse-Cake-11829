The other reviewers saying that the mousse is runny are correct. Mine didn't turn into a gloppy disaster, but it was definitely not as firm as I would have liked. Usually when I make a fruit mousse cake, I use two packets of gelatin. Maybe that will turn out better results for this one.

Thanks to all your comments mine was successful, except for the Genoise, but it was still beautiful and delicious. I wondered if anyone thinks you could make this with regular cake instead. Would it not have the strength to hold the mousses?

ZERO FORKS! I mousses were good but the genoise was not. It had a rubber like texture. I used the completed mousses as another dessert. I will not make this genoise cake recipe again.

Cake came out fine, despite a few setbacks. Didn't know where to find Framboise and didn't want to buy any Chambord just for this cake, so I bought some really high quality raspberry sorbet and melted a bit of it as a substitute. Second, my raspberry mousse never set up. It was like a previous reviewer mentioned, so to avoid a disaster, I just refrigerated the cake between servings. It made the mousse rather firm, but overall, it worked out fine.

I love this recipe! I have made it twice now, and both were successes. This is not a quick recipe, it took half a day the first time. I did take advice on doubling the cake recipe, which worked out well. My kitchen doesn't have lots of pans, so when I bake the cake, I divided it between three 8 inch cake rounds that had the bottoms lined with wax paper. I also don't like cutting cakes apart. Now, because I used these cake pans, my springform pan wouldn't work for assembling this masterpiece. What I did instead was to use posterboard. I made an 8 inch round for the bottom, then I cut long strips about 6 inches wide. I tested the length before taping them together to make sure they would go around my bottom piece. Then I covered the sides with Saran wrap and attatched them to the bottom. I assembled the cake as per the directions then. I chilled the cake overnight in this set up, and when I went to garnish it, the sides came of beautifully. The posterboard bottom made an easy plate transfer, I just left it there until the cake was gone. It didn't last for another meal and got rave reviews. I also noticed some reviews saying their cakes turning out eggy. Another trick I learned from making other sponge cakes is to take the eggs and put them in a metal bowl. Then, put a pan of water on the stove. Bring the water to a boil first, then turn it down to a simmer and set the bowl in it. Keep it there until the eggs warm slightly, then remove them from the water and whip them with the mixer. It seems to help when I do it to make a fluffier mixture. I did enjoy making this cake, and it does make a lot of dishes. Good thing I have a daughter to help me clean!

I have made this dessert many time and is a hit every time, not to sweet, it is labor intensive but well worth the effort, a few tips I good give is to use a 11/2 cups heavy cream for the white chocolate mousse it yelds a little extra, and when making the genoise beat it for 6 minutes minimum.

This recipe is a good example of why some of us subscribe to Gourmet - because sometimes you just want to go all out and make a complicated, fancy and stunning dessert. Not for the faint-hearted or hurried, but worth the effort.

This cake is heaven. I made this cake first when I came out in the magazine. I refered to another pastry book with more details to understand the trickiness of the component parts. It came out perfectly for me. Deceptively light. Not for the inexperienced, and it was quite a production to make.

NOTICE TO ALL COOKS, NOVICE AND ADVANCED: Do NOT attempt this recipe. I spent approximately 6 hours trying to put this together. The recipe itself is confusing enough. The genoise was a thinner than a newspaper, so cutting it in three is impossible. Whoever wrote this recipe knows nothing of logic. The recipe itself contains "in another bowl" over a dozen times. I would need about 50 bowls to make this work efficiently. It was so disastrous my 3 year old niece with quite a sweet tooth told me she didn't like it after one small bite. I urge everyone looking at this recipe to turn back now before ruining your day. I

I agree with the cook from MA, the sponge cake turned out to be like rubber on the bottom (very distasteful), as for the raspberry mousse, the gelatin did not set quickly enough, it ran halfway through the cake making it look very unappealing. I am very disappointed in this recipe, it took a lot of work, the ingredients were costly and the result was terrible.

The food editor back in late '89 or early '90 when this recipe was originally tested must have magic hands. The amount of cocoa butter in the type of white chocolate used in make the genoise batter has a great impact on the outcome of the sponge. If not done correctly (ratio of fats to egg foam AND temperature of the egg foam and fats at time of combination) the fats in the batter fall out of suspension with the egg foam and collect into a yellow layer of rubber at the bottom of the cake. That's only the first problem. An equally serious variable is the alcohol content of the framboise. If there's too much alcohol the gelatin will weaken. When it does work, this recipe makes for a stupendous creation, but forget about making it look like the picture! Follow the direction offered by one of the other critics; fold in the eggwhites separately--see a recipe by Jacques Pepin on white chocolate sponge.

This recipe was a disaster! I've made complicated desserts before but never had one utterly fail, as this did. The genoise was so thin I could barely slice it into two layers, forget about three. Then the raspberry mousse didn't set up and turned to mush when I unmolded the cake; the raspberries that I had carefully placed came sliding out! It was so disappointing to spend the better part of a day making this cake only to have the final product be such a mess. The only positive was that the white chocolate mousse was delicious -- maybe I can come up with an alternate use for it.

I'm 13 years old and my sister and I made this dessert it didn't take as long as expected. It was fabulous, we found no need to double anyhthing it turned out beautifully. Everyone loved it. We would definatley make it again.

The genoise I have always made is a classic one, with egg yolks/sugar, and egg whites beaten until stiff, then combined. Otherwise, way too eggy and dense. I don't think the white chocolate in the batter helps, either. I "made do" with just a normal genoise, then the white choco mousse. It could be fun to use both white chocolate and dark chocolate for the curls on top of the finished product.

Maybe it's just me, but I usually do well with cakes. I made the white chocolate genoise twice and both times it came out very heavy and eggy. It didn't even seem like the consistency or texture of cake. I never even got to the rest of the recipe because I couldn't get the cake to work. I don't know what I did wrong but it was dissapointing because it sounded great.

Fantastic, stupendous!! I Served this along with a Tirimasu at our Easter dinner and this cake was defininetely the crowd favorite. Thanks to fellow reviewer "Libby" for the tip on increasing Genoise recipe, as I cannot imagine using amount called for in original recipe.

A wonderful dessert, not for the novice. A trick to cutting the cake is to use toothpicks to divide the layers, use a sharp serrated knife to slice, and having a second spring form bottom to transfer each layer is helpful. Every one loved this, but it took several hours including chilling time of the pastry cream & chocolate.

Wow! A lot of work but got rave reviews. Many "best cake ever" comments. I agree that the recipie for the genoise could be increased. It was paper thin once cut. Quite a challenge. My best suggestion is be organized and give yourself plenty of time. Had my husband take our son out of the house so he wouldn't hear me curse at a cake.

I had to triple the genoise recipe, but otherwise the cake was delicious. It was a lot of work, but worth it.
