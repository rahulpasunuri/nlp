I have made this pie many times and always get asked for the recipe. Mind you this is a very dense, rich pie so it is not appropriate for all dinners. It travels well just add the whip cream after you get there. I have a whip cream maker that I take with me to finish it when I get there.

This was a very good, flavorful pie. Much higher quality and better tasting than a regular pudding pie. I made the filling exactly as instructed and had no problems with it. Would also agree to use good quality chocolate, as that is key! I did substitute Oreos for the graham crackers in the crust, which was great. Left the espresso powder out of the topping due to a bunch of non-coffee drinkers present, but would try it in the future. Will make again. Great that the entire thing can be made a full day ahead of time also!

I made this pie for Mother's Day yesterday and it was a big hit, as always. I give it 4 forks for its luxurious texture as well as its ease of preparation (a great make- ahead dessert). As the recipe makes quite a lot of filling, I made 1.5x the crust recipe and used a 10" deep- dish pie pan. And I usually serve it with plain whipped cream. Perfect!

I made this pie for my friends a couple years ago and now I have to bring it every time we get together. I've never had a problem getting the pudding to set up properly.

A big FAIL for me. It was runny & soup-like, even after more than 6 hours of sitting in the fridge and then, the freezer. Maybe my whisking was not furious enough? (But my mousse always turns out perfectly.) Since it never set, I served it as a chocolate soup to (very gracious) company. On the upside, the flavor was good. But not recommended unless you can risk a flawed presentation.

I doubled this recipe for a luncheon for 45 people - thinking that it would make three pies (after reading some other reviews) and it could have done a 4th! It was so rich that we easily got 10 slices from each pie. There were other desserts available, but it was by far the most popular. I was worried that by pressing the plastic wrap to the top that it would not look nice when it was time to serve. It looked wonderful - I used real whipped cream from the can & dusted each plate with cocoa/powdered sugar. It looked beautiful. It was a really hot day, so we had to keep the pies in the fridge until right before cutting them otherwise it was to difficult to get a good slice. The crust was easy and yummy. Oh, and by doubling this recipe I was able to buy the 1/2 gallon of half and half which cut down on the cost per pie.

Simply put, This recipe is ridiculously good. Its very easy to make, even though it requires tons of stirring, the ingredients are easy to get and it is one of the best pies I have ever eaten. Although what I have been doing was skipping the pie crust altogether and just making it as a pudding. It tastes just as good and requires much less work. Still, this is an exceptional recipe that i will recommend to anyone.

My husband made this for a dinner club night and it was a huge hit! He's no chef and found it easy to make. I've made it twice since then and each time people love it. I admit I'm lazy and do a premade crust though.

Wow. This is truly an amazing dessert. So richly chocolate-y and not too sweet. A coffee/chocolate lover's dream.

This pie was decadent and delicious. Good quality chocolate is a must! I used Scharffen Berger semi-sweet chocolate and Trader Joe's unsweetened Belgian chocolate. Based on previous reviews, I doubled the crust recipe and there was just enough filling for 2 pies. I didn't do the "cappuccino" cream, I just used sweetened whipped cream, and served with sliced strawberries.

Rating: 4
This pie was a huge hit. I used a pre-made chocolate graham shell, and ghiradelli chocolate. I used regular whipped cream instead of the cappuccino. Way too much filling - I had read the comments and had smaller pre-made mini shells to fill. I got one full pie and three minis from the filling. Small slices are definitely a must, as it is very rich.

Rating: 4
My guests went crazy for this pie! Even the non-chocolate lovers were thrilled with the taste, saying that it was not too sweet even though it was rich. It was easy to make and made a great presentation. One pie served over 20 slices. A regular sized pie slice would be way too big and rich for one person.

Rating: 4
This pie was fantastic! It was absolutely decadent and perfect for any chocolate lover. I did have to use a store-bought graham cracker crust because I couldn't find regular chocolate graham crackers, but it's salty flavor provided a nice contrast to the rich pie. Make sure you boil and whisk for a full 12 minutes and the pudding will set up perfectly. Chocolate-covered espresso beans from Trader Joe's were a perfect finishing touch.

Rating: 3
This was delicious, I used a store bought graham cracker crust which didn't look pretty but was yummy (and was easy). Also, the recipe makes more pudding than can fit in the crust, and even then I think the ratio of crust/pudding is a little bit off. Next time I'm going to half the pudding recipe and put it in a shallower crust for a better crust/pudding recipe. Maybe something along the lines of a tart.

Rating: 4
I used a hazelnut crust which was great. I reduced the amount of sugar in the crust. The result was so delicious! It is my favorite. The espresso beans were an excellent garnish. A few people said they didn't like the cream, though I did. It was really easy to make and delicious. I would suggest chilling it for a lot longer than time stated. Mine was mush but the taste was great. I used top notch ingredients and it was worth it. yes, this makes a lot, but knowing that in advance helped avoid confusion. Wonderful!

This is a fantastic pie! I actually made this for a pie contest at my job and won best overall pie last year. People are still talking about it and asking me to make it. If you have chocolate lovers they'll love this.

Wonderful chocolate pie! There is a lot of filling, so I put the extra into a store-bought chocolate graham crust and took the other to a party. It's still good in the store bought crust, but it's soooo much better if you make the crust. I'm not good at making press-in crusts very pretty, but it turned out fine. I didn't make the topping, just used canned whipped cream.

Chocoholics of the world, THIS is your nirvana pudding pie. I cheated with the premade Oreo crust, but frankly you could spread this pudding on rycrisps and bring tears to a chocolate lovers eye. I agree good chocolate and half& half are important, but the key to holding it together is the 12 minute whiskathon...(nod to an earlier author). Simplest, best chocolate dessert I have ever made...and I do a lot of chocolate desserts...it is, after all, a separate food group. All kidding aside...try it, you will be a star!

Delicious, just as everyone else has said. Very chocolaty, but in a good way. I had a hard time finding espresso powder (Starbucks wouldn't even sell me a small amount of their grinds), so on a whim I substituted the coffee flavor for mint flavor. In place of the espresso powder I used 2 1/2 teaspoons of creme de menthe. It gave the cream a very subtle, not overpowering, mint flavor that really complimented the pie. I followed the filling recipe exactly and turned up with the right amount of filling, with a little left for tasting afterwards. After the success of the mint substitution, I would be curious to see how well this pairs with other flavors...caramel or raspberry.

I made this recipe using a ready-made 9" Oreo crust and Ghirardelli chocolate. It tasted great; very rich and chocolaty. The filling is a wonderful consistency and doesn't ooze at all when the pie is sliced. As others have noted, the recipe generated a considerable surplus of filling - I almost wondered whether it was intended to fill two crusts! I'm not convinced that it is quite good enough to be worth the cost however: I calculated the recipe (with ready-made Oreo crust, Ghirardelli chocolate, and without cappuccino cream topping) at about $9. Perhaps if the filling could be stretched to two pies, it would be more reasonable. It certainly does satisfy the need for chocolate!!

Read the reviews and solved the crust problem. Sprayed a little Pam (gasp) in pie plate before pressing crust. then, I added some Amarula to the whipping cream. It's a South African liquer not unlike a caramel-y Bailey's, a great contrast to the fantastic depth of chocolate in the pie.

I have made this pie for a few different occasions and it has always been a hit. Yes, it's a very dense and heavy pie, so I always cut smaller pieces so that it doesn't overwhelm after a dinner. It always seems to be best when using Ghiardelli chocolate.

This pie was a little too dense, but if you love chocolate, you'll enjoy it. I think if you would mix some whipped cream it would lighten it up some.

I made this recipe for my neighborhood Fourth of July bake-off. I made two pies so that I could taste test the first one before submitting it. Well, the flavor was nice but there was something missing. No one liked the coffee flavored cream with it. So before submitting the second pie for the contest I added chopped toasted hazelnuts and sprinkled them on top of the pie. I also added pure allmond extract to the cream instead of the coffee. I ended up winning the grand prize for the bake-off with these changes.

This pie is a great go-to for family dinners. In fact, it has become a standard at Thanksgiving for those of us who don't like pumpkin (bleah, pumpkin). I find that using cinnamon graham crackers in the crust makes a nice contrast with the filling. I would also recommend not using chocolate that's more than 60% cocoa. I found that when I went with a really dark bittersweet chocolate, the pie wasn't sweet enough.

Big hit at our poker-night cookout. I made the recipe pretty much as written, with the following exceptions: I used an Oreo crust (see the chocolate mousse pie--basically, Oreos and butter); I didn't have unsweetened chocolate, so I used all semisweet (Callebout dark) and reduced the sugar to 3/4 c.; and instead of the cappucino cream, I used plain whipped cream with sliced strawberries. I think the last substitution improved the dish, because the chocolate filling is so rich, it benefitted from a little fruit. I have to disagree with the reviewers who said the filling was like instant pudding. If made properly (with whole milk or half-and-half, and good chocolate), it's more like a heavy mousse.

This is a very good recipe. It is almost like eating fudge. And the other reviewers are right in saying good quality chocolate is CRITICAL. I owuld definatly recomend this recipe to anyone.

I made this with Scharfenbergers chocolate and followed all the directions as is except for the crust. I don't like choc. grahams, so used chocolate wafers to make the crust. What was "to die for" was the coffee cream. I think it would also be great with regular whipped cream and fresh raspberries!

I agree that using a very high-quality chocolate is critical to this recipe. The first time I made this, I used Baker's unsweetened and Ghirardelli semi-sweet, and I noticed what another reviewer called a "chalky taste", (although everyone loved it and it disappeared quickly.) It needed a better, deeper chocolate. Don't bother with the graham crust - an oreo cookie crust suits this pie MUCH better than the chocolate grahams.

I still have mixed opinions of this recipe. I did not make it with the cappuccino cream per other's recommendations, (I also am not a coffee lover). Both my husband and I enjoyed it, but I kept feeling that my chocoholic vacuum was not being sufficiently satisfied. It was rich and creamy and not too sweet, but something was missing in the chocolate dept. I used Baker's chocolate, so maybe a more intense chocolate would improve it. Melting the chocolate in the butter was also a good idea. Thanks all.

I can't believe how good this was, a real chocoholic's dream. The recipe made too much pudding for the pie, so I put it in a dish, covered it with plastic wrap and had it the next day as a bonus pudding dessert. There was nothing left on the plates.

Instant Pudding?? You've gotta be kidding! This pie is to die for. Use the best chocolate, like Scharffen Berger or Valrona, and you just can't go wrong. If you use the leftover whites and whip then fold into melted chocolate and then the whipped cream, you can top the pie with a lovely mousse instead. Add a bit of Grand Marnier to the mousse. It is heavenly!!!

I made this for a dinner party after reading the reviews. My guests raved about the pie. I used a deep dish pie pan and didn't think there was enough crust to fill the pan - next time I will 1 1/2 times the crust ingredients. I also just used purchased whipped cream and sprinkled toasted almonds on top to simplify the process.

You can easily re-do this recipe to follow Atkins or for diabetics: use a regular pastry crust instead of graham crackers, and use only unsweetened chocolate. Cook the pudding without sugar all the way through and allow to cool slightly before adding sugar substitute - I added as much Splenda as the recipe called for sugar, and found I had to taste and add a little more. NOT a low-cal recipe, even without sugar, though!

Rating: 3
I can't believe someone compared this filling to Jello pudding! Not even close. The pie is really delicious as is, but can also be enhanced with many other flavors (Grand Marnier, dark rum, Chambord, etc). Most people I've served this to prefer plain sweetened whipped cream as well. Yum!

Rating: 4
We all loved this pie. I have made it a few times and one thing I change is too melt the butter and chocolates together instead of finely chopping, it seems to make the filling smoother. I also only use 1 cup of half & half and the rest milk with no difference in taste to save some calories.

Wow! I am a true chocoholic and this rates way up there with some of the best, rich chocolate deserts I've had. I think good quality chocolate makes a lot of difference.

This was the most decadent and delicious dessert I have ever made. The espresso beans added such a nice touch. I would make it again although I couldn't believe how long 12 minutes are when you are wisking the pudding - worth the effort though.

If you want to imagine this dish, think of chocolate pudding in a graham cracker crust with whipped cream on top. Of course, the pudding is a lot richer and more decadent than the Jello boxed stuff. The flavored whipped cream makes it work. I poured a bit of Grand Marnier over it, and that was good too. I think Kahlua would work well too.

I found that there was a chalky taste. This might be from the powdered chocolate. It was still very good and went quickly at work. The cappuccino cream was great. Due to the richness of the pie, I found that I liked plain whipped cream with it better. I will save the cappuccino cream for something else.

Yes, the flavor was dark & wonderful. Yes, it was easy. However, at the end of the day, it is still pudding in a pie shell. It isn't that a pudding pie is bad, it's just that there are many more interesting & pretty desserts out there... Sorry! BTW, I used Oreo crumbes for the shell...

I was instantly drawn to this recipe because I almost had everything in the house already, plus I didn't have to heat up my kitchen by turning on the oven. I took a shortcut and added the filling to a kosher for passover chocolate crust...trying to clean the cupboard...and it turned out great. It is most definitely a cool and creamy dessert, but it is almost too rich. The chocolate is so overwhelming you NEED the whipped cream to cut it. I might make this again in the Spring for Passover!
