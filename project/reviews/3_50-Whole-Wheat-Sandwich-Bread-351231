Recipt is very unclear. To clarify: 1. make starter: let rise 1-4 hours 2. add rest of ingredients, let rise 1-1.5 hours 3. put dough in oiled bread pan, let rise 20 min in 75-85 degrees temp (i let let oven warm up on 'warm', turned heat off and 'proofed it') 4. preheat oven to 450 5. turn temp down to 400, put in bread, bake for 1 hour. keep an eye in it, 400 at 1 hour may be too much. man, it took me countless read-throughs to understand these 5 bullet points.

I've made this bread at least three times and each time it turns out perfect. It takes most of the day but I think it's well worth the time which is pretty much just waiting for it to rise. This may be the only bread I bake from now on. Much better than any store bought white bread. I absolutely love this recipe.

I have made this recipe 3 times this week. I am on vacation. This is a fine recipe if you don't leave the house to do anything that takes more than an hour and a half. It's a findecent sandwich bread in the end if you do exactly what is instructed... but all Rosies recipes are like that. They are brilliant that way. Woudl I make it again given my lifestyle? No.

What exactly does flour 100% mean and why do the percentages not add up to 100?

Just made this bread -- it is very good. Couple of things about the recipe. First, though it is not explicitly stated, the oven temp should start at 450 then be immediately lowered to 400 when the bread is put in. Second, I made this over two days, putting the starter in the fridge for 24 hours. The recipe is not entirely clear on this point, but I let the starter sit out at room temperature for one hour before chilling it. At any rate, we are very happy with the end result.

This is a fairly simple recipe to get almost no knead half wheat sandwich bread. The oven temperature change and steam methods are common with this type of bread. A simpler approach is to just use a loaf pan without the stone and steam or an oven safe pot with a lid.

This recipe is terrible! It is so poorly written with very important information buried in text. Also, at the top is says the oven temp is 450 and then 400, but nowhere in the recipe does it tell you to turn down the temp. Also, it demands way to much fussiness with the baking stone and ice cubes in a baking sheet at the bottom of the oven!? Also, you are supposed to open and close the oven very quickly when you put in the bread, but also put the ice cubes under the rack on the lowest setting?! This is my first attempt at bread making and it has been very frustrating. I just wanted to make a basic wheat bread.

This may be the worst bread recipe I have ever made. It took forever, the additional rise called for (in a sandwich bread???) seemed excessive, plus the bread stuck to the pan. The mixing technique with the developing of the starter, etc, was just a waste of time that yielded no appreciable gains in flavor. The baking technique (which requires that the oven be preheated FOR AN HOUR), plus a baking stone and the addition of ice cubes as you put the loaf into the oven is total overkill. This is sandwich bread, not a rustic loaf where you are trying to improve the crust... Honestly I just wanted something healthy and soft to spread some peanut butter on for my five year old... This was a total disappointment, especially because I love Rose Levy Berenbaum.
