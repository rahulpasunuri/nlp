I made this largely because it matched the ingredients I had on hand. And it was okay, but the tomato basically overwhelmed the rest of the dish. Perhaps that is what it tastes like. Not a bad meal, just not very exciting.

Wow! I didn't think this would be so incredible since it's so simple. But it's fantastic! Excellent flavor and not too soupy. I didn't have mace and allspice, so I used dill instead which was great. I also cooked it for about 45 minutes instead of 30. I definitely will make this again.

I must have done something wrong but this did not taste that great to me. I made it for a large family dinner and I couldn't even get half of them to touch it. Might try again, but really wasn't impressed the first time around.

I used two small broilers, cut into eighths, because I couldn't find a 4 lb fryer. The dish was really easy and turned out great. For the leftovers I just put everything in a soup pot and added two cups of water. I think the chicken was even tastier the second time around.

The dish was so easy and quick. I doubled it for company and used 4 fresh tomatoes from my garden. The next night, I cooked up soup pasta and used the stock as chicken soup, and it was the best soup I ever made! My grandmother would be very proud!!!
