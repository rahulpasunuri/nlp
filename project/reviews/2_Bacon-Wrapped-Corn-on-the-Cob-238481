Yes I agree with the other comment here, it needed to be cooked much longer than 10 minutes....we did like 35 minutes till it was done. Boy was this delicious!

I have been grilling corn in the husks for many years and I'm pretty sure you'll want to grill for 10 minutes, rotate 1/4 turn and repeat all the way around for a total of 40 minutes (I use 15 for 60). Other corn grilling tips: make a fresh cut on the ear and soak in water for 3 or more hours, I like it burned on one side, open the ear per recipe and smear with flavored butter.
