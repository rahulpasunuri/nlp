Delicious summery meal. It is nice to serve a delicious, flavorful grilled chicken that isn't all gloppy with sauce.

Fabulously easy. I doubled the recipe for the marinade, used canned chipotles in adobo sauce, and added a whopping dollop of crushed garlic. I used a fine sieve to get a smooth sauce and added more honey than was called for, because I just couldn't taste any sweetness with the recipe as described. PERFECT!

I made this with boneless skinless thighs on the grill pan and they turned out really good- I poured the rest of the marinade over the pan to deglaze and served on top the chicken and some potatoes. Easy and tasty weeknight dinner- though nothing toe curling.

Not at all impressive.

If I could I'd give this 10 stars I would. It is stellar. I did add some citrus zest and more chopped garlic to increase the flavor. The chicken is amazing, but the corn...oh the corn is absolutely unbelieveable. I've even made it with pork tenderloin. It was good but the corn still beats all. Don't leave out the green onions. I did the second time around and we were sorry. A real keeper. Thanks Bon Appetit. We can always depend on you!

Great barbecue dish! My first foray into barbecuing corn turned out much better than I expected; I'm looking forward to making this again this weekend! A much lighter alternative to the cuban chicken thighs with rice and chorizo, if you are considering possibilities.

Just thought it was so- so. Citrus flavors didn't come through.

Wonderful! Followed the directions exactly, bone in with skin thighs and 4 hour marinate. Moist, very flavorful and easy. Great for a casual dinner with friends.

Made this last night but only marinated it for about 2 hours. The husband and kids loved it but I didn't really care much for it. Next time I'll try to marinate it for a little longer and perhaps increase the salt and add some chipotle or something. Will try again because family loved it.

Made the chicken for a large party, and there was nothing left, they ate it all and were looking for more. Followed the marinating instructions closely since citrus was involved...Will definitely make again

Delicious. We like the citrus flavor. I used Walla Walla sweet onions instead of garlic because I get very ill from garlic. Also used powdered red pepper because I didn't have the crushed. This is a wonderful recipe. Great for company. Takes some time to squeeze the limes and oranges, but well worth the trouble. Don't be tempted to use bottled orange or lime juice.

Please note...you cannot marinate chicken overnight! Especially with this much citrus juice in the recipe. It will completely change the texture of the chicken and destroy the flavor of the chicken. Sometimes the instructions are there for a reason!

I made it with a lot less citrus and it was fine. This recipe is the way food is made in a mexican border town. I guess it's to kill the taste of scrawny chickens and poor quality veggies. Way too much citrus.

I think my husband described it perfectly. HORRIBLE. Way to citrusy and no flavor. I even let it marinade overnight. The ingredients sounded great however there need to be some major readjustments in the amounts. YOu would be better off winging it.

This dish is delicious. The flavors really came thru in both chicken and vegtables. Served for company and got rave reviews. This is a keeper!

Love, love, love this. Substituted spicy smoked Spanish paprika for the hot sauce. This is a level above most grilled chix recipes. Truly great! (Didn't make the corn, just the chicken and green onions)A keeper!

got to the store and couldn't remember if recipe called for skinless/boneless or skin on/bones in so, against my better judgement for chicken, I allowed the houseguest with me to choose skinless/boneless and it was a big mistake! Pull the skin off after it has cooked if you must!!! But the flavor was awesome!

Made this last night for dinner. I threw together the marinade in the morning and marinated the chicken all day. For the onions and corn, I marinated those after work for about 1.5 hours. All 3 items turned out fantastic-I'll likely do this again.
