Great salda verde. I have used jalapanos and serranos, but whichever pepper you use, definitely add the seeds from the peppers, because without them the recipe doesn't have much kick. Adding a clove or two of garlic definitely helps, too.

This is a great summer salsa. So fresh and tasty. My friends always request this one. Use extra serrano to give it a real kick--but the longer it sits in the fridge, the spicier it gets, so be careful!

Next time I'll go to the store and get fresh cilantro and the right chilis. I used dried and added some jalapeno and it still wasn't spicy enough. I did use my home canned tomatillos but just drained well and they worked great. (plant once and they come up year after year!) Might consider the bit of garlic next time. Ate with chicken breast and raw veggies. Trying to watch carbs! Would use in the 7 layer dip in place of gaucamole.

Love this recipe! So did everyone on our camping trip - it was supposed to accompany the Bean Enfrijoladas, but everyone ate it up with tortilla chips and crumbled asadero cheese before the beans were ready! Will definitely make this again.

Wonderful recipe. I cut down the tomatillo, 2 for 1 avocado and added a little mayo (1 tbl). The tart refreshing taste of the tomatillo with the creamy avocado with sweet onion,lime, cliantro is a winner! Don't forget the serano chile for the added heat and zip.

This is one of the best recipes I've found on Epicurious. The flavor is very clean and fresh. I made it when our son visited last weekend and we ended up eating the leftovers on everything that weekend...burittos, omelots, salmon, chicken, etc. Then I took it to a community potluck today and was asked to bring two batches of it to a dinner party tomorrow night. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. Our local (rural) store doesn't carry serrano chiles, so I substituted some dried Korean pepper and chipotle chili powder (from Tierra) and Tabasco. Other than that I made it just as directed. We had some sweet Mauai onions. I don't think you want to use strong onions in this. (Just my opinion) This one is a real keeper!

We absolutely loved this recipe. I served it with the accompanying carnitas recipe and some pico de gallo. Heavenly, definitely a keeper. Yes Lily, you do need to take a chill pill

I agree with the cook from Cambridge. Yum, yum! I, too, only used one avocado and thought that was enough, and added a clove of garlic. Lots of flavor and easy to make. As a dip with tortilla chips I could eat it all day, and it was a hit at my party.

I made this just as the recipe called for (I don't measure ingredients, but I'm sure my proportions were pretty close) and it was fantastic. Fresh, light, flavorful. Pure summer perfection. I was tempted to add garlic and not use two serranos, but I stuck with the recipe and am glad I did. I may try little variations on it in the future, but this was lovely as is.

This is a CLASIC mexican salsa recipe given by a Mexican and actually EVERYBODY in México eats this type of salsa in their two versions raw as presented in this recipe or broiled as the cook in Tulsa suggested, however I do not agree with the other cook that it's bland if he thinks it's bland he didn't get it right. This sauce is full of flavor and it's great with a simple Quesadilla please do not add cheese to the salsa.

Fantastic! I just threw everything in the processor and turned out great. Have made several times already and passed recipe along to several others.

Good, not great (our vote).

Fantastic - this was the favorite among 3 salsas that I made for a taco dinner. Minor modifications: used 1 avacado (2 is probably good too), used vidalia onion instead of white onion, cut cilantro in half at the request of one of the guests, and added a medium crushed garlic clove at the advice of one of the reviewers. We will definitely do this one regularly for a change from the classic tomato salsas.

Haven't actually tried this yet, but I definitely will because it sounds a lot like the fabulous green salsa served at Casablanca (in Venice, CA) which has chiles, diced avocado, plenty of cilantro (if you're lucky), etc. But even better--they add diced jack cheese (they were shredding it last time which wasn't as good) and you put it on the handmade flour tortillas and hope you don't fill up on them.

In a word...yuk! In more detail...bland, runny, green mush. Don't waste your time on this one.

I agree with the cook from Tulsa. Rick Bayless is DA MAN.

Great recipe. I only used 1/3 lb of tomatillos. I also added minced garlic and lime juice to it to add a little more flavor. I couldn't stop eating it!!

I've not made this dish, but I can't imagine it being better than the version from Rick Bayless. Take the same ingredients, but put the tomatillos, serranos, onion and a couple cloves of garlic under the broiler until charred. Put it all in the blender -- minus the avocados. Add avocados just before serving. It's so good, and the charring gives it a lot of flavor.
