I like these tastes, but felt there was too much sauce. Next time, I will either only use some of the sauce made from the first 6 ingredients (except for the scallions), or eliminate the sauce entirely and just serve the dish with the hoisin/hot chili paste with scallions on top. Any leftover soy mixture could be saved for another recipe.

Very tasty ... halved the soya sauce and vinegar due to other reviews and kept the rest of the recipe the same. Very easy and delicious. Expensive with the Alaskan Black Cod, but worth the expense once in a while. I am sure this would be tasty on other firm white fish like halibut and also on chicken. Will definitely make this again.

I was looking for a way to use some cod from my freezer. Made the soy-ginger-onion sauce and instantly realized that this was exactly the sauce that I experienced in Shanghai - the vinegar dumpling sauce! I ran the sauce through the blender and strained it to remove the bulk. The fish was wonderfully spicy, and even though it was from the freezer it caught my attention. Served with brown rice and edamame it really made my day. I will use this sauce again - it is so good!

This recipe has a lot of Asian flavor.I used Alaskan cod, halved the sauce, and I grated the ginger instead of dicing. My husband said "This is great! Make this again!"

Like my husband said after every bite, this is delicious. I halved the soy sauce and vinegar for the ginger sauce and used a whole bunch of green onions but otherwise followed the recipe. I used black cod/sablefish, which is so worth the price.

Definitely need to cut the soy sauce in half and monitor the amount of ginger -- then just dribble a bit of the sauce on the fish and rice. Also limit the amount of hoisin on the fish. Delicious but be careful not to make everything too saucy.

My favorite kind of recipe - easy and delicious. I used wild-caught cod fillets from "Whole Paycheck" and followed the directions with the exception of the hot chili paste, where I cut it back to 2 teaspoons. I prefer only enough hot to linger like a memory, not scorch my tongue; but I could have added the full recommended amount. Perhaps the chili paste I used - Thai Kitchen Red Chili Paste - is not terribly hot. Next time I'll use the full amount. The directions for cooking the cod are flawless. It was a delicious meal. I served it over basmati rice with steamed broccoli and carrots. Did I say it was delicious? Made my company think I'm a gourmet chef!

I combined all ingredients (cut a bit of the soy sauce) and cooked in the oven per a previous suggestion--it was delicious and simple.

Although this recipe was delicious I gave it 3 forks because the instructions are terrible for the Soy mixture. I listened to the other cooks and changed the soy sauce to 1/4 c, combined the rice vinegar, 1 tsp of minced ginger+ the green onions and honey. Skipped the garlic. I seered the black cod with the hoisin + 1/4 tsp of the chile paste (i too like to taste the fish and not too spicy) for 2 minutes but I felt I could have seared it a minute or two longer to seal in the flavor more. I will definitely make again, but with my adjustments. And to the chef who recommended broccoli with sesame oil - thank you! Great addition.

I used Alaskan Cod, no skin. Put all the ingredients together, used red onions in place of green onions. Put it in a glass cooking dish and popped it in the oven till sauce was bubbling. Maybe 10-15 minutes. The fish was done to perfection and the taste was superb. I use extra ginger. I'm freezing the extra sauce for a future stir fry.

I followed the recipe fairly closely. I used Chilean Sea Bass instead of Cod and reduced the amount of Asian Chili sauce, since my family prefers it not too spicy.We thought that this is one of the BEST recipes for fish EVER! Served it with brown rice and broiled asparagus! Yum! A perfect 10!

I bought some really beautiful fresh cod to make this - followed the recipe closely and to be honest, although all the flavors are nice the fish was over powered by the raw garlic, ginger and hoisin.

Flavorful, quick, and healthful! I served it with coconut brown rice and sauteed broccoli with a bit of sesame oil. I only wish I'd read more comments and hadn't made so much of the soy-vinegar sauce! Not a tragedy, as I plan on using it for a stir-fry in the next few days. Ooh, and maybe some steamed dumplings!

Quite good. Too much sauce -- make only 1/2 of amt.

Quick side note since many people substitute other fishes in this recipe (and this is the first recipe I've made with "Alaskan Black Cod" too!) -- apparently its also known as "Sablefish" and is a very sustainable species in Alaska. As a deep, cold water fish, its high in Omega-3s. Good to know! http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/fishwatch/species/sable fish.htm

This was delicious and very easy. Black Cod is pretty expensive (was $18.99/lb) and it if weren't for that, I'd make this twice a week! The fish comes out succulent and juicy. the skins stuck to the pan for me as well, so non-stick pan is the ticket there. We had this with coconut rice and stir fried veggies.

I halved the soy sauce as other reviewers suggested and used 1 teaspoon ground ginger rather than the fresh ginger. I left out the green onions and the chili paste only because I didn't have these on hand. I used one pound of wild Atlantic cod and marinated the fish in this sauce for 30 minutes. I then baked it in a 400 degree oven for 17 minutes. The fish was juicy and flakey and tender. My husband raved about it. This is a great marinade for other white fishes or even chicken.

Straight up delicious. If you have the option, use a non- stick pan. I had some trouble with burning hoisin. ymmv

This was delicious and easy to make, although we used salmon instead of cod. Like other reviewers said the soy needs to be reduced. Next time I would halve the amount of soy and add more honey. I love the combination of the hoisin/hot chili paste with the ginger sauce. We served it with ginger-cilantro rice and put the sauce on the side rather than covering the fish with it. This is a recipe that we will definitely make again.

We love this. It was so flavorful and I served it with Coconut Rice and Japanese Cucumber Sesame Salad. Wow!

I confess I'm not a big fan of fish, so I'm always looking for ways to make it more appealing. This one scored big time. I agree with others that a little less soy sauce is an improvement, but don't leave the ginger/soy sauce out. It's the combination of flavors that make it fun to eat. It's supposed to leave liquid (hence the advice to serve in shallow soup bowls), and with rice the consistency works just fine.

A-mazing. I bought a whole fish & then filleted it out; put each fillet on a cedar plank, brushed on the hoisin/chili sauce, & grilled for 20 minutes in a closed gas bbq at medium. For the soy ginger sauce, I did not have green onions, so after grating the ginger on a microplane, I also grated a shallot and the garlic. Didn't have unseasoned rice vinegar either, so seasoned it was. Took the advice of previous reviews and cut down on the soy sauce, but also used a low-sodium version. That always seems to help with the salty strength of the soy. Anyway, it was amazing, and we spooned the sauce over the fish, brown rice, and roasted asparagus. I will definitely be making this again!

After reading reviews I decided to try the fish without the soy ginger mixture. It was far too sweet and one-dimensional to me. So I mixed up the soy ginger (taking advice of some to cut soy in half) and added a couple of teaspoons to the top of my fish filets. This did the trick and brought more flavors to the dish. My advice is to just drizzle it over the fish-- you'll use only a fraction of the soy ginger quantity the recipe calls for. I used the remainder to saute my asparagus with. It was delicious and easy.

This is an easy and delicious weeknight meal that I have made twice now. I would agree that the ginger soy sauce is watery, but serving the cod over a bed of white or brown rice somewhat ameliorates this. Garlic sauteed sugar snap peas are an excellent side dish.

terrific flavors. i agree with the other reviewers that the ginger sauce is not right as printed - I halved the soy (and used low sodium tamari) and more than doubled the vinegar and honey. it balances nicely against the hoisin on the fish. served it over lunddberg wild blend rice and garlic roasted broccoli.

Great dinner that comes together very quickly. I have no idea what Black Cod is so I used East Coast cod and probably killed some important habitat in the process, but hey it was affordable. The amount of Hoisin is way too much just from reading the receipt, and I reduced it by half. Using that much Hoisin one would never taste the fish. That being corrected, both I and my best friend (a Chinese chef) greatly enjoyed the dish. Our overarching comment was that there are a lot of flavors, sweet and salty, going on in this. So be prepared. With all Asian style cooking the correct brand means everything to the dish. My house brands are Pearl River Bridge Light Soy Sauce and Koon Chun Hoisin.

We enjoyed this very much. I agree that there is a lot of the soy/ginger sauce but I put the excess on my rice. Had it with said rice and steamed micro bok choy.

I thought the hoisin/chili sauce was very good but did not like the soy ginger. It was kind of salty, watery, and had kind of an odd overall flavor. I'll definitely use the hoisin again though.

i thought this was ok...the soy ginger sauce was a little watery?? did anyone else think this or have this problem? however, it was quick and easy. also used chilean sea bass because i couldn't get black cod and i think this is what saved the dish. sweet/spicy hoisin was nice.

I made this with a salmon filet and it was very good. The hot chili sauce I used was very hot so only put in 1 teaspoon. Good week night meal!

The black cod w/the hoisin is phenomenal... next time I am just going to stick to that. I found the ginger soy sauce to be an unnecessary component and while I like all those flavors, the dish did not need it.

I liked the sauce alot but didn't care for the texture of the cod I bought. I would make this again but use halibut instead.

Made this as directed, and served over steamed brown rice and broccoli, which were great with the sauce. Had to sub sriracha for the hot sauce called for, which worked just fine. This is a crowd-pleaser, no doubt, and though it's got more sugar than I'd like (between the hoisin, which is loaded with it, and the added honey), the overall healthiness of the dish with the sides makes up for it. Will be making this one again.

This was really delicious and very fast and easy to make. I used halibut but any thick cut white fish will do. My only suggestion is to reduce the amount of soy by about half.

Did this with Alaska salmon since we live here and that's what we had. Worked great, delicious and fast.
