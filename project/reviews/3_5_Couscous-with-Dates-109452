Made exactly as writen to accompany a rack of lamb. Served with oven roasted asparagus. Pretty to look at, easy to make and a nice blend of flavors. Will try with Israeli couscous next time.

Trivially easy, and a nice change from boring, plain couscous. The hardest part is chopping the sticky dates. I've also added a bit of cinnamon, which is nice, too.

This was very tasty. I adjusted the recipe to accomodate a family of four. The dates and orange zest work well together. Ate the leftovers cold the next day for lunch and still enjoyed.

This is very tasty and takes....15 MINUTES to make. Definitely worth making.

Really really good! I sauteed some leeks and used those instead of the scallions. I also omitted the orange zest (as I was out of oranges). This dish has a really delightful sweet/salty/savory contrast. Will definitely make again.

I have not tried this recipe, but I often make variations of couscous quite similar to this one. I always add lemon zest and lemon juice, sometimes mixed with a little bit of orange juice or pomegranate molasses. An additional ingredient I would recommend, which I think suits the dish wonderfully, is ground cardamom...but only if you ike the strong flavour of it of course. Mint is also a nice addition. The dates can be altered with or used in addition to a variety of dried fruits. My favourite is dried apricot. If you like nuts, almonds and/or walnuts are also delicious in couscous, in addition to being very healthy.

Simple, simple, simple to make. We made this to go with a spicy pumpkin curry (indian style). It was FANTASTIC.
