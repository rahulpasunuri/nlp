This is quite good - I'd recommend omitting the broth in the pepper sauce and using 2-4 tbsp of EV olive oil instead. Otherwise it tastes too watery. The green onions were pretty chewy, so I'd probably skip them next time. Otherwise, this is a very pretty, light, & easy dish.

How much lemon juice? For some reason the quantity is not showing up on the recipe this evening. Thanks!

This was my first time making polenta...while I didn't love the polenta part of this dish, the sauce and the vegetables were excellent! I will probabaly make this dish with a different main ingredient - like chicken - and make the sauce to go over it and the vegetables on the side. Anyone who is a polenta fan will love this - I just think after exzperimenting with this recipe I may not be a fan.

Trying to eat healthier and lower our family cholesterol... and we already eat very healthy but have bad genes. This recipe was a great veggie option with some grain. My husband gave it a thumbs up - "the polenta was the best part!" And he has texture issues. The sauce is outstanding and I used precooked polenta to cut time.

I used TJs precooked polenta and mixed in the parmesan. Tasted great, but stuck when frying, even with generous olive oil. Next time, will follow instructions and put parmesan on top before broiling. Otherwise, an easy tasty recipe. Makes a lot of sauce...enough for double the other components.

Very easy and very tasty. I omitted the lemon juice - just didn't appeal to me. Instead I roasted the vegies with olive oil, balsamic, garlic and herbs. Other than the change with the vegie dressing, I followed the recipe. My husband asked to keep this meal in the regular rotation.

I made the polenta according to the recipe from "The Barefoot Contessa" and used the roasted red pepper sauce as the accompaniment along with roasted asparagus with parmesan. It was a hit, and I used the olive oil in the sauce as was suggested and found it married well with the polenta. Would definitely make it again.

Thanks to Andawe's suggestion, I also added about 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil to the red pepper sauce. I sliced the vegetables thinner so they'd cook better before they became too charred. I cooked the polenta according to the manufacturer's directions. We served the dish to non-vegetarians and they liked it so much they asked for the recipe. To top it all off, this is very easy!

sauce was too bitter-- i wouldn't use balsamic vinegar with roasted red peppers. also, the lemon-herb mixture for the vegetables was a little too lemony for our taste. it may be that we didn't quite broil the vegetables to a char well enough, though.

I've not really a polenta type girl, but I was epicurious! I made this and it was DYNAMITE!!! Very very good. Thanks so much...I can't wait to make it again.

Really delicious and healthy. I used oregano from a squeeze tube for the sauce. I didn't have quite enough Parmesan, so I added some feta. Loved the marinade and the overall effect.

I wanted to drink the red pepper sauce it was SO AMAZING!! The marinade for the vegetables was equally amazing. I think the key for me was using canned/jarred roasted red peppers because the marinade adds to the flavor of the sauce. I also made sure to use chicken broth to add flavor. The sauce was a little runny so next time I won't puree it as long. I also used pre-cooked packaged polenta that comes in a vaccuum sealed "tube" - all you do is cut into little circles and warm in a pan with a little oil. Much easier than making polenta the way the recipe suggests, although I don't mind my polenta a little loose with a bunch of cheese. Yum!!

I really liked it. But I like to be able to taste the vegetables I'm eating, so I enjoy "blandness".

Although it looks nice to roast the scallions whole, they were hard to cut afterwards. Otherwise, this dish tasted great!

Too much oregano in the vegetable marinade, which made it a bit overwhelming. The roasted red pepper sauce was really bland. The polenta was fine. I would make this again, and stick to my own recipe for roasted vegetables and roasted red pepper sauce. The concept is good, but the recipe isn't.

We made this when we had some vegetarian friends over for dinner. We added some chopped basil to the polenta and 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil to the red pepper sauce. The addition of some oil really made a difference in the richness of the sauce.

eh. this was bland. really bland. the polenta needed something else - a stronger cheese? herbs? the sauce was really a waste of roasted red peppers (and I did them myself instead of using canned ones) - the flavor of the peppers was not strong enough. although the sauce wasn't gross, I had no problem throwing it away and will not make it again. the vegetables were fine. I liked the lemony marinade - I think the tomatoes came out the best of all of them. overall, this is not a meal worth repeating without some serious adjustments and changes.

I marinated yellow squash, zucchini on lime/lemon juice, salt and garlic for 6 hours. Used balsamic marinated onions instead of aspargus and it turned out great. My guests loved it, and marinating longer made for very tasty squash.

I saw the recipe and picture in Self magazine and made it the next week-- it looked so good. Thought it was going to be difficult to make since I had never worked with polenta before. It was so simple. And the vegetable marindade was incredibly flavorful. We both enjoyed it. Asked my husband if he liked it enough for me to make again and he said YES...even though I'm still not sure if he knows what polenta is. :)

I would not make this again. Granted it is the first time I have made polenta, but I don't think it should have been as hard as it was. I wound up broiling the polenta for almost 10 minutes and it was still runny and uncooked. The red pepper sauce I thought had too much lemon juice and the flavors did not mix well. We threw the entire meal away and made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches instead.

This is one of those rare dishes that's nice enough to impress company, but is very quick to put together. Also great for guests who are vegetarian, gluten-free, or even vegan if you leave out the cheese. I increased the olive oil a bit, but otherwise made it as written, and it was a major treat.

i mixed feta into the polenta right before taking off the heat. that mixed with the red pepper sauce was awesome. i eat a lot of meat and this was an alternative that didn't feel starved.

This was good but I thought there was WAY too much thyme. I'd halve it next time. And I'd kick up the polenta a bit. Maybe a richer cheese? The sauce was tasty and a bit tangy. I'll make this dish again, but with some adjustments.

Nice combination of flavors; I made the sauce with fresh basil which really complemented the vegetables.

This dish is a bit spicy and very tasty. It will be a staple in my home. The sauce for the vegetables is also delicious and would work well with pasta.
