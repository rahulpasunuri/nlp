This is the recipe for pao de queijo that people can't find anymore. The link seems to work to epicurious but you can't search for it!!! This other recipe is excellent. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/member/views/PAO-DE-QUEIJO-AKA-BRAZILIAN-CHEESE-PUFFS-1266023

As with "ankemon" review, I tried a different Brazilian cheese bread recipe recently that used tapioca flour which was fantastic. It appears to have been removed. Please put it back!

I thought I was rating a different recipe, that I can't find now. Just made it 2 hours ago, and now it is gone from the site. Am I going crazy?

I was born and raised in Brazil, and must say that this recipe is really good, just like the real thing.

What a timely recipe just had these at Samba's yesterday and my hubby went nuts for them. FYI- these are not like Red Lobsters biscuits. More like a popover.

According to GourmetSleuth.com, they suggest the following: instant tapioca (grind beads to a fine powder before using) OR cornstarch OR instantized flour (such as Wondra).

Cassava starch, yucca starch, or tapioca starch may be other terms for products made from the same root. If those don't turn up anything, try searching online for a Brazilian grocer or specialty supply that ships.

I live in a very countryfied area, deep in the heart of Texas--WHERE can I get Manioc Starch? Nobody has heard of it where I live. Is there a substitute, 'cause it looks like it would be delicious.

I had been looking for something to match Red Lobster and this is close. Minus the yellow cheese and easy, would try it again
