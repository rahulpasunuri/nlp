I have been making this recipe for two years and it always turns out incredibly rich and choco-licious. I am not allowed to come to the in-laws for Thanksgiving without at least one in hand. I will admit I don't use the crust recipe, only the filling (I buy a pre-made graham cracker crust). It has never turned out egg-y; I would recommend when pouring the hot chocolate/cream mixture into the egg/sugar mixture to take care and do it really slowly so the eggs are gradually brought up to temperature. This may help. I was surprised at the mixed reviews - this is always a hit with any crowd - especially with chocolate lovers.

My husband loved this, although it wasn't all that special as far as I am concerned. The crust was hard to work with, and there was way too much filling (I baked the leftovers in two custard cups in a hot water bath.) There was a bit of an eggy taste to it all; I tried to doctor it up a bit with framboise, but no luck.

My husband and I did not care for this. I thought it was too egg-y, and he thought it was "wierd" (tasted like warm puddding). Since the filling is like chocolate cream pie filling, I'm going to try putting whipped cream on the leftovers and serving it cold.

This is a yummy recipe for any chocolate lover. The crust is a bit tricky but what crust isn't? I've made this tart several times and aside from the crust, it is quite manageable to make. I suggest warming it up in the oven for a few minutes prior to serving and serving it with ice cream.

Delicious! I had no problems rolling the dough out, as others did. Perhaps overmixing the ingredients was the problem. Use of a dough blender resulted in a delicious shortbread crust--and pie weights will definitely keep shrinkage to a minimum. It was a hit at Christmas dinner.

I checked on this recipe and was honestly surprised at the tepid reviews. True, the crust can be quite sticky, but I found rolling it out between wax paper made it much easier. And after checking the recipe again, I just realized what the problem may have been for many--there is no mention of using beans or pie weights when pre-baking. Do so. (It keeps the crust from shrinking.) The result is really one of my--and my guests'--favorite desserts, rich, chocolately and simple.

I used the crust recipe from the "Lime Custard Tart" in the Dec 2002 Gourmet. No trouble with that crust (it's also a great recipe) and it paired well with the chocolate. I did also add a few tablespoons Kahlua, that added to the flavor.

I found the crust quite tricky but kept my board and rolling well floured and turned the crust over several times while rolling it out. It was well a real hit and turned out exactly as I had envisioned it would.

Same comments as others. Good flavor if you like shortbread and chocolate. Other than that, nothing to write home about.

This did not work for me at all in spite of following directions . The crust would not come up from the floured board no matter what tricks I tried. Ended up treating it like a crumb crust which shrank in the oven so I had a big shortbread-type cookie with good tasting chocolate filling on top of it. So much for my reputation as the Christmas Eve dessert provider.

I made this for Christmas day. It was very easy to make but it was really nothing spectacular. I made it a day ahead and reheated it in the oven.
