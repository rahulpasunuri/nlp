This is an impressive presentation. There is plenty of chopping but all of it can be done the day before. As far as the Morels, they add an exotic twist to the dish but for the price $18/lb shitakes might be the way to go. I like the fava beans. Definitely a hassle to prepare but you don't run into them too often so it was a good change as opposed to peas. I made it with a lamb dish so it was a good fit. Next time I might add a little garlic and oil when sauteing the mushrooms.

I liked this--it had a lot of subtlety to it. I did make a few changes. I used shitakes rather than morels--I think they pair well with spring vegetables. I also used frozen peas rather than the favas--after reading the comments here I decided to go an easier route!

This veggie dish was amazing! It was the first time I've ever cooked fava beans. They were a bit more work than I'd have thought, but SO worth it! They were delicious in this dish. I never thought to boil green onions like this. Wow! And the mint! The mint was essential to the overall feel of "Springtime Freshness." It added the freshness without tasting all minty. I served the veggie saute with rack of lamb, and my guests were all impressed with this side dish! I will certainly cook this every chance I get. (Any chance to use morels I take.)

I thought this dish was wonderful. I found the peeling of the fava beans to be a bit too time consuming given how few there were after all that work and how little impact they had on the taste of the dish. The morels were wonderful, but so expensive, so if you were going to make this dish for a less extravagant meal, you could omit them, and save the morels for special occasion. I served this dish with a leg of lamb, and the combination of mint and crispy vegetables was a perfect complement. The dish is also easy to make ahead; chop everything beforehand and then just saute before you serve. Delicious!

I prepped the favas the day before--this would be very time-consuming if done all on one day. The secret to the success of this recipe is to use all fresh ingredients--I'd substitute ingredients (as recommended by other reviewers) before using anything canned. The mint was a delightful addition--very fresh-tasting!

We often use this combination of vegetables. A variation would be to use fresh peas if fava were unavailable, or in combination with the fava. We usually use olive oil, garlic and shallots instead of the butter/scallions. We also use tender,sliced artichoke hearts. Basil can be substituted for the mint. I would only blanch the fava for 1 minute.

This is a tasty and attractive side dish. I substituted fresh baby shiitakes for the morels because they didn't have fresh morels at the store. I left them whole because they were small enough. I didn't add the fava beans because I was making this for guests and I didn't have the time. I actually shelled them and cooked them, but didn't have the time to do the final peel. I peeled a couple though and they were a bit soft and mushy. If I did this again I would only leave them in the boiling water for a minute. If I were making this again for guests I would definitely follow the cook's notes and prep this stuff the night before. I made this to accompany Rabbit with Mustard Sauce, but I think it would be nice for any light spring meal. The mint is a nice touch. I cooked the vegetables longer than I intended to; next time I'll be more vigilent. Also, to the cook from Vancouver, I've made the fava bean soup with carrot cream from this site and they recommend using frozen edamame beans if you can't get the favas. It also seems like the "would you make it again" rating for this dish is not accurate.

This is really terrific. The flavors marry well and it is quite simple. I followed as directed. I found the favas easy to deal with once I figured out a quick way to shell (tearing the pod then kinda squeezing each bean out sort of like toothpaste worked best for me). I'd give 4 forks but for that I want something with a bit more interest level. Morels are a pricey addition and, if fresh, need to be washed thoroughly00it took me three changes of water before I was satisfied. A bit of grit would ruin this.

Im thinking of making this recipe but I cannot find fresh fava beans in my area... Does anybody know if I can substitue canned beans or any other fresh beans. Help appreciated.
