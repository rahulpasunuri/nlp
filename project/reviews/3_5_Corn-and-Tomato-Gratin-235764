Made exactly as directed with frozen white corn instead of fresh corn. Might have added a little extra cheese in with the breadcrumbs. Excellent right out of the oven and even better cold out of the fridge the next day. This recipe is on the short-list for this year's Thanksgiving side dishes.

I found this recipe looking for something to make with some fresh corn and extra cream I had on hand. I didn't have high hopes for it because it sounded like it could be a little wet. I basically halved everything for the two of us, except the bread crumbs, and I used about 1-1/2 cups of those. I salted the tomato slices and put them on a plate, not on a rack, that was a little too fussy for me. I used a shortcut I learned in Cooks Illustrated and melted the butter and added it to the bread crumb mixture. I don't think there was too much butter (using 3 T for half a recipe). I would make the tomato slices thinner next time. I used an 8 inch square pan, and it still took the full time to get piping hot. I don't think I would bother making this with anything less than great tomatoes and corn.

This is seriously good -- wonderful way to use garden tomatos. Followed recipe except used about a third less cream and butter.

This came out very well and is quite easy. I just sauteed the bread crumbs (homemade) with butter and a little olive oil, garlic and herbs. Then layered it with seeded tomatoes, grated parmesan, then corn. Finish with a layer of breadcrumbs and cheese. It was done in the oven in about 25-30 minutes. The breadcrumbs keep this dish from getting watered down. It was delicious and easy to improvise.

Yum... Didn't measure anything just threw this one together and it was wonderful. I didn't have enough tomato and thought the corn mixture looked to liquidy when putting it together but it all came out just fine. You could add more fresh herbs and I'd experiment with some different cheeses next time just to switch it up but perfectly fine as is.

I have made this 3 time and it is one of my favorite summer recipes. I followed the recipe exactly, and it did not disappoint. Each time I made this, I had requests for the recipe. I did use fresh corn and the best tomatoes I could get (twice I used home-grown tomatoes that were given to me). I did drain the tomatoes on racks, but I also used paper towels to absorb some of the liquid. The flavors in this dish are fabulous and so quintessentially summer!

Thank you to previous reviewers' comments regarding the watery consistency. Seeded some of the sliced tomatoes and used them on the bottom layer. Placed the remaining in the oven to dry out a bit before assembling. The dish is exceptional and perfect for outdoor entertaining.

GREAT recipe. I was expecting this to be good but it overexceeded my expectations. I used frozen corn, a little less butter, all half and half, and doubled the cheese. Next time I will slice the tomatoes a little thinner and not bother with the draining. Company worthy!

i love this so much! each time we're grocery shopping (me pushing the cart and follwing more than anything else), i make sure she says we have enough corn for the corn gratin. i hope she makes it again soon! love you, hunny!

Easy to make and absolutely delicious. I didn't use any of the butter and did not drain the tomatoes (just added a bit more bread crumbs) I made this with both fresh corn (great, but a lot of work) and found that frozen corn worked well, too. If you make this at the end of summer, use fresh heirloom tomatoes from the farmer's market! They really made the dish perfect.

This was delicious! We made this for a side dish with grilled tri-tip last night, everyone loved it. I added another half cup of bread crumbs, used frozen corn, and sprinkled an extra layer of parmesan cheese on top. I also blotted the tomatoes with paper towels before assembling the dish. Used only 4 tbs of butter. we will definitely make this again.

This recipe completely knocked me off my feet. I think the cream/milk combination was the best part. I used skim milk and it didn't hurt the recipe at all. The basil was key--you could even add a little more than the 1/2 cup the recipe lists here. All my tomatoes went bad, so I fried some eggplant and replaced the tomatoes with that, and that didn't really matter since the corn is the star her. Because of that, make sure to get fresh, sweet corn. The flavor has that higher level to it that you can taste with a really good dish. Make this dish!

I thought this was wonderful. I did make some changes based on both reading other reviews and my own intuition. I used 2 large red tomatoes and 2 large yellow tomatoes from the farmers market. I sliced them thinly (1/8 - 1/4") and seeded them. I also let them drain on paper towels. I pressed them gently on top with paper towels too, then salted them lightly. I used the corn from 8 large ears. I also added two finely chopped shallots, sauteed in a bit of butter, to the corn. I cut the milk to 1/2c (and used 2%). I upped the cream to 3/4 c. and added 1/4 tsp of cornstarch whisked in completley, before adding it to pot. I used prior advice for the breadcrumbs by indeed using the day old sweet french baguette. I tore them into 1 in pieces, then pulsed them in food processor. They were still about 1/2 " or so after that (bigger than normal breadcrumbs). I used the equivalent of 10" of baguette vs. 8". I combined this with the basil and fresh parmesan as directed. I followed the rest of the directions, except I added a layer of shaved asiago cheese atop the two corn layers, and I also drastically reduced the butter by cutting on a lesser amount (I used only about 1/4 c.). I used all my bread crumb mixture before the top layer was reached. For the topmost layer, I used store-bought, italian breadcrumbs and sprinkled a bit more parmesan cheese. Baking time was the same. This was so delicious and wonderful. IT was NOT over wet or runny at all. The key is in the tomato prep as well as adding a bit less milk, and a few more breadcrumbs.

I was excited to put my garden-fresh pickings to use in this recipe, but was largely disappointed with the results. I should have followed my instincts and peeled the tomatoes first, as the cooked tomato separated from the skin leaving unappetizing bites of tough skin to pick out. I don't think I would make this out of season, because the fresh-from-the-cob corn held up wonderfully and added nice textural balance to the creaminess of the dish. Speaking of cream, the results didn't justify the addition of so much fat- butter, cream, and whole milk. I also thought the bottom was much too wet (despite an extra 15 minutes of baking time) so next time around I plan to halve the cream and milk, and add the cobs to the liquid during stovetop cooking to add more fresh corn flavor. Finally, the top layer of crumbs could be added halfway through baking to prevent over-browning that occurred. A good start, but I'll definitely be tweaking this recipe next time around.

As is, this was very good. BUT, the next day, when I wanted to put together a "leftover lunch", I browned some bulk sage sausage and added cooked egg noodles and a little veggie broth to the corn dish and warmed it all on the stove...WOW! It was really good. Maybe because it's -10 degrees outside, my body was craving this comfort food.

I should have read the reviews first (I usually do). I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a little too runny. I think drier bread crumbs or, as suggested, panko would help. I used frozen corn and that may have added some liquid. Good flavor though.

I didn't have high expectations for this given the reviews but this was delicious! I used plum tomatoes and didn't bother salting and draining (this yelded only two layers of tomatoes). I used three large ears of corn and doubled the basil. It was the perfect consistency.

Sorry, folks! I used garden tomatos, fresh corn and home grown basil. This just didn't make it on the flavor scale. I'm going to recycle it with Italian bread crumbs and sharp cheese tomorrow night. Hopefully, that will jazz it up a bit.

A great side,made it with salmon for myself and steak for my husband. Use a little common sense when using the liquid to bread ratio and you will have a side enjoyed by many.Was wonderful with mixed heirlooms but fully believe would be just as good with any ripe tomato, if seedy, seed first.

I followed the recipe almost as written except used about 1/3 of the butter. I think using a baguette for crumbs is essential because the crumbs are pretty big and give the gratin an excellent texture. Next time I wlll slice the tomatoes thinner. Excellent dish...a keeper!

I made thsi last night with fresh heirloom tomatoes, which I did noy bother to drain or seed. I used Japenese Panko breadcrumbs, which were a great addition. My husband loved it!

While the combination of flavors was really delicious, it didn't quite have the body we were expecting to hold the corn and tomatoes together. I don't think it was a matter of excess moisture (we gave the tomatoes a large chop, instead of just slicing, and they were well drained) as much as it just needs extra bread crumbs to create the "bread pudding" like consistency. Definitely one to keep trying until we get it right!

I couldn't believe how good this was the first time I made it, and have since tweaked the recipe every time since. I've added roasted poblanos for a mexican flair, sauteed garlic in the corn mixture, and used many different types/flavors of bread for the bread crumbs. I use lowfat milk instead of whole milk and don't bother with draining the tomatoes ... I thoroughly reduce the corn mixture and use an extra cup of bread crumbs to take care of extra moisture. I've done this with (heaven forbid) canned corn with equally amazing results.

I will definitely make this again, however, I do have a word of advice based on one problem I had with the recipe. Draining the thick tomato slices on wire racks did not reduce the water content sufficiently & as a result, the finished dish was much too soggy beneath the crisp bread-crumb topping. If your tomatoes are particularly juicy, seed at least some of them. I'd consider increasing the amount of bread crumbs and/or changing ratio of cream to milk.

Delicious! Crispy on top, and creamy/cheesy inside. Yellow squash or zucchini would make a nice addition.

This was a pretty simple recipe, but very delicious and it has a nice italian flare
