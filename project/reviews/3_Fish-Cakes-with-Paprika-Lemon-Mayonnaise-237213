I followed the recipe exactly, but before forming patties I cooked a tiny bit as a test. My husband and I both thought it was bland. I added 1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon each of the following tarragon, ground ginger, dried lemon zest, dill, dry mustard, and garlic salt. Better, but we won't make them again.

Delicious! If you like crab cakes, you'll love this dish. Light, tasty AND easy. Yes, use an extra egg and double the bread crumb amount. I used a mandarinquat hybrid for the citrus. Will definitely make again. My husband, he who does not like fish, really enjoyed this dish as well.

This recipe is awesome; however, I made a few changes. ... I use tilapia fish, Kikkoman bread crumbs (Panko) for their sturdiness and crunchiness (the cakes tend to fall apart before you cook them), water chestnuts (cut into small pieces) and sometimes I use scallions (green onions) to change it up a bit. Also, I make my own TARTAR SAUCE by using the following ingredients: mayo, sour cream, shot of champagne vinegar (I discovered this delicious vinegar when making blue cheese dressing), lemon juice, capers, salt and pepper. Just mix everything to your own taste. It is simply delicious and people go crazy over it and think you are an awesome chef!

Good but could be much better. Next time I'll pulse ginger in with the starting ingredients.

I really enjoyed these fish cakes. I followed the advice of others and added an extra egg as well as the increased bread crumbs and they held up well under my rather inexperienced hands. The mayo did need a bit of cayenne sauce, but that is just me. The best part of these is the make ahead factor. Processing them in the morning and leaving them in the fridge for later frying really fits my schedual, and it helps them firm up, holding up under the frying better.

Very good. I agree with all others - more garlic and bread crumbs, 2 eggs. I used Alaskan halibut and had no trouble with the patties holding together. I also was fine making them the 1/2-inch thickness called for.

we enjoyed it but it doesn't make it to the Repeat List. Maybe I processed it too long but it was a bit mushy. Great concept but we prefer Louisiana Crab Cakes!

My husband and I love this recipe! Our local market has some excellent rock cod, which we used for the fish cakes with much success. I used a little more lemon juice and sweet paprika + cayenne in the mayonnaise because I love a little zing, and it was perfect. A note: I am on a gluten-free diet, and used tapioca bread for the bread crumbs. I know some folks have mentioned that more than 1/3 c crumbs should be used, and this is especially true with tapioca bread. I dried out the bread and crumbled about 1/3 c and it really wasn't enough. I ended up using 1/2 c instead, and it was perfect.

Very good. I used Haddock, Cod probably would be have been firmer. Should add more bread crumbs 1/2-3/4 cup so it will stand up to the frying without falling apart. My wife loved the dressing, I thought it a bit salty, I would cut back on the salt in the dressing next time.

This is delicious. I used cod and agree with another reviewer .You have to increase the amount of bread crumbs so that the mixture is thicker or they will fall apart in the pan. I would say to use 3/4 of a cup of bread crumbs. Also I would decrease the salt in the mayo mixture.

I loved this recipe...especially because my 7 and 9 year old loved it! It was easy to make. I wouldn't change a thing. I had leftovers for lunch the next day...delicious. Will definately make this many times...

Even my husband who doesn't normally like this sort of thing enjoyed this meal. I didn't have hot paprika so used sweet and the sauce was still excellent. Also, I used way more lemon zest and juice than the recipe called for which worked really well. I found that the cakes took way longer to cook than the recipe suggested, nevertheless, they were delicious. Next time I may take another reviewer's suggestion and add cayenne to the cakes.

The Lemon Mayo sauce was fantastic, 4 forks. I used entire lemon peel for zest, and 1/2 lemon for juice and regular paprika not hot. It was DELICIOUS! B U T ... The fish cakes - since I used Cod, its a moist fish which needed more bread crumbs. Also 2 eggs would be better to help make the cakes firmer, absolutely necessary. Size - Patties should be made very thin. Spices - The first cook who said too much garlic was wrong, I took that advice - used less, and regreted it. There could have been 4 medium cloves. I would add more onion next time and a bit more corriander, but not more cumin. Perhaps a dash of cayenne to put the kick in the fish patty and not rely completely on the sauce. Maybe even toss in some zest into the patty, why not. It needed every spice listed, for sure. Will absolutely make the sauce again. Might experiment with the patties, but not sure it's worth it. I'm sure there is a croquette recipe out there that works.

Absolutely perfect as is. Today, I tucked a leftover cake, with greens and that scrumptious mayonnaise, into a small multigrain bun for my lunch. I think it was good, but I'm not sure. My coworkers split it between them.

Maybe my garlic cloves were larger than average, but the garlic overpowered all the other flavors. Additionally, If I were to make this again, I wouldn't process the fish with the breadcrumbs, I would chop the fish to keep some larger pieces intact and possibly use Panko in place of the breadcrumbs to lighten up the consistency. The mayonnaise was delicious.
