The tuna was delicious, although I ran into some problems. Either my scale is off ,or the recipe called for more than 3 oz of sesame seeds. Next time I'll measure instead of weighing, before toasting the seeds.I used wax paper to wrap the patties for refridgeration for them to hold their shape, as they were falling apart. Even though I have a gas commercial style range, the temp of the oil never got to the 330 recommmended.Even with these problems, it was worth it!

This dish came out beautifully. Tuna was a little over cooked. 2 minutes was too long. Avoid adding salt when there's soy sauce.
