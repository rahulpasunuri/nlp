I agree with other users that there was a slight medicinal edge to this, although I will admit that I didn't have the orange-flower water. While it wasn't bad, there are better grilled pineapple recipes out there.

This dessert is fabulous. It's easy to make, really hard to mess up and delicious!! At the time of serving I added some chocolate ice cream as well as mini chocolate chips (I'm a huge chocolate fan!!) It added a nice touch to it!!

I didn't have the orange flower water and mint. The lime zest was a bit overpowering but it was an interesting taste. Will try again w/ all the ingredients...

This was OK - smelled amazing, but the mint combined with the super-sweet honeyed pineapple tasted a bit medicinal. Next time, will omit the mint and maybe do brown sugar instead of honey.

I haven't made this recipe yet, but as I was reading the comments it was obvious that everyone was having a hard time finding the orange blossom water. Please don't look for it at liquor stores as the recipe states. You will it at middle eastern, mediterranean, or indian specialty stores, and sometimes at Asian stores. It's really worth having.

Absolutely delicious! It was such a great accompaniment to the spiciness of the Thai BBQ menu I made. I couldn't get the Orange Flower water in time, so I used a bit of fresh squeezed oranges instead. I definitely want to try it with the water next time though. Yum!

This was so easy and delicious! Couldn't find orange-flower water, but I had some orange syrup that I used in its place. I served the grilled pineapple over vanilla ice cream, sprinkled with toasted coconut and sliced almonds. Yum! Everyone loved it.

So simple, delicious, and versatile. It tastes like summer. The orange flower water adds an interesting dimension. Definitely give this one a try!

This recipe is super easy and super yummy! I make it for potluck grill parties and always get asked for the recipe. Orange flower water can be purchased at Beverages and More and also high end grocery stores like Whole Foods. I purchased several bottles on line. It makes this recipe!

I made this dessert in combination with another dessert (pears) that failed. Served the pineapple ontop of pears with a slice of brie. It was awesome. Didn't have orange flower water. Don't know if that would have made it even better?

I served the whole Morroccan-themed menu from the 6/03 Bon Appetit. My guests raved about how perfectly balanced the flavors were. I could not locate orange-flower water so I used orange liquere instead. Fresh mint from the garden added a bright note to a perfect dish. Will definately make again.

I love easy desserts utilizing fresh summer fruits and this one was a no brainer. I will make it often served with ice cream

Really, really good, and really, really easy. I served this with grilled salmon and a crisp green salad with tarragon vinaigrette, and my guests raved. (It was about 95 degrees last night and the pineapple flavor was very refreshing.) Like the first reviewer, I did not have orange flower water, so I added a tablespoon of orange juice. I also used fresh spearmint right out of my garden. Terrific -- will make it again for 4th of July!

We used this recipe for grilling pineapple slices as an accompaniment to grilled pork tenderloin. I had no orange-flower water, and since one of the ingredients in the pork recipe was fresh orange juice, I added a big squeeze of an orange to the marinade as a carry-over. I also added a little olive oil to the marinade. Everyone loved it.
