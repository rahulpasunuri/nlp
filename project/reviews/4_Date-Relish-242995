I followed the recipe exactly as written. It's a fantastic complement to the grilled cornish game hen.

This is a fantastic relish for the grilled sumac lemon cornish game hen recipe! the balance of sweet fruits, tart citrus complement the berry and smokiness of the cornish game recipe. I have also tried it with walnuts to substitute the pinenuts to accentuate the middle eastern palate, which also works well.
