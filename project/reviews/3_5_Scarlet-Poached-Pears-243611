I used Bosc pears as I couldn't find any of the other. Turned out great. Made it the day before and also added some star anise. I turned the pears about every 8 hours and left them in the syrup overnight. Pears slowly turned darker until they were the scarlet by X-mas Day dinner. Never got it to be very syrupy - so I removed the pears and cooked the liquid down. Definitely would make this again - not too sweet and absolutely beautiful.

Intrigued by the beet addition -- it was brilliant and added a wonderful earthiness to the pears. Only change I made/make is to use half Orange Muscat and 1/2 ruby Port. Intensifies the colors.

Not great. I didn't follow recipe exactly (subbed another liqueur for the Orange Muscat) and probably should have allowed the liquid to reduce more, but they were still very un-special.

Made this for a dinner party for 6. While acceptible it was not raved over, unlike the poached pears with spiced caramel also available on this site. Therefore considering the cost and the time involved I will not be attempting this again. The Orange Muscat wine is hard to find and not exactly cheap and so cooks need to find some substitute for this.

These were AMAZING! I did not have the exact ingredients, but still used the same beet and wine base. I used what I had on hand, which was port, fresh beets, sugar, cinnamon (powdered), whole clove, orange rind, and sliced orange. I served it with a bit of goat cheese and sliced cucumber for garnish. Everyone raved about it! I can't wait to make it again.

This was excellent, and perfect for Christmas Day brunch! I think this would be a great make-ahead dish as well. I used port wine, left out the bay and added some whole cloves, cardamom pods, peppercorns, and strip of orange peels, along with a little extra sugar because cooked in in a couple handfuls of fresh cranberries. To serve, I tossed with some satsuma segments. Gorgeous and delicious!

I made this with red muscat and concord pears (i didn't see smallish pears in the market). Look for firmer and less graniny pears- in case your friends don't eat pears on regular basis. I poached it since mine are getting pretty soft after 20min. i turned off heat and they steep overnight. I reduced the syrup after poaching. everyone thought it was great. super festive too.

While I have yet to make this particular recipe, I make lovely ruby colored poached pears by poaching the pears in a combo of red and white wine and simple syrup. I let the pears steep overnight to enhance the color. I also add a couple whole cloves, peppercorns and cardomon pods to the poaching liquid.

After 45 min. or so, the liquid was not yet "syrupy". I cooled the pears in the liquid overnight. The next day I poured the liquid into a pan and boiled it down to a syrup. I put the chilled pears on a platter with some coconut sorbet and drizzled the syrup over both. Delicious! Will definitely make again.

Made these for a dinner party and they were beautiful. The pears were delicious before being poached (a rarity, in my experience) but the color made them even better.

The parchment "wicks" the poaching liquid over any pear pieces that stick out above the top, so you don't have any uncolored spots.

What's with covering the simmering liquid in parchment? That sounds like a sticky pain. Why not just a lid?

This is a lovely dessert recipe. The flavors are just right and the color from the beets is beautiful. Although I would not serve the beets with the pears, I must say that they were quite good to munch on.

What do you think about canning this recipe? I have pear trees ready to pick and love to can. I am wondering if I make the syrup and pour over the sliced pears in a jar and then water bath can them. The recipe sounds very good, I love the beet addition.

I would definitely remove it.

Before I make this, a question: Do you remove the sliced beet or include it with the pears?
