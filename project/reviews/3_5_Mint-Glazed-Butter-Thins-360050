Excellent! Used half of the peppermint, and no glaze.

This recipe is great as-is, but is also great for its versatility! In place of the mint extract, practically any other extract can be used; I've tried rose extract (great for a bridal shower or ladies' tea), and I plan to try lavender extract, lemon extract, fiori di sicilia (orange flower water), and anything else I can find! They're light, and delicate, not too sweet, and somehow, they're low cal, according to Epicurious. As other reviewers have said, 1 cup of powdered sugar is too much for rolling; I find a handful to be just right (but there's still leftover).

They're good but not fantastic. A bit time consuming too. I don't know why recipes say to use so MUCH powdered sugar to roll the cookies in. I ended up with 3/4 leftover after that step and used the rolled in sugar to make the glaze. I think they'd also be good using lemon extract instead of peppermint...

These are really fantastic cookies, with a lovely old-fashioned appeal. My husband took a batch to his workplace and they disappeared! I reviewed this recipe on my blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.
