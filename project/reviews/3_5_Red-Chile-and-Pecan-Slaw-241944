Yum! I used Tabasco's Sweet and Spicy in place of the Thai sauce. My friends and I like it so much that I don't cut back the recipe for the cornstarch and veggie broth... that way I can have it again and again (and when I get sick of the spicy flavor I play around with other spices with the same broth base or other veggies like zucchini and carrots).

My husband loved it! Definitely got some kick to it. It does take a lot of work.

Thanks for the note below. Instead of preparing 32 oz of stock with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to get 1/4 cup of dressing base, just use about 1/3 of a teaspoon to 1/4 cup of stock, and save the freezer space.

Loved it. But one thing that isn't very clear in the recipe - it calls for making 4 cups of the stock and corn starch mixture but then only uses 1/4 cup of the mixture in the dressing. That's the way I made it and it was spicy but really good. If you are doubling or tripling it, do not increase the amount of stock or corn starch used, instead just increase the amount of mixture of the two you use in the dressing - i.e. 1/2 cup or 3/4 cup instead of 1/4 cup. You'll have plenty of extra mixture no matter what- not sure why they wrote it this way...

Absolutely fantastic - didn't have the sweet chili sauce so I substituted mango chutney instead - delicious. Husband said it was the best slaw he has ever had - reminded me this morning to keep the recipe.

WOW! This slaw is superb. The market had run out of pecans, so I used walnuts instead, and they worked very well. I used half of a large jalapeno instead of one and it was definitely spicy enough for my husband who doesn't eat anything without hot sauce. Also used a touch less than 1/4 cup of vinegar. I'm eating the leftovers as I type. To keep the salad from wilting overnight, I drained the excess dressing from it and kept it in a separate container. It's just as good the day after! Terrific recipe.
