My family absolutely adores this dish, which I've been making for years. My teenagers ask for this for birthday dinners. It goes together quickly, and I can buy all the ingredients at Trader Joe's (good crusty bread and fresh mozzarella are absolutely crucial). We make a vegetarian version using fake chicken soup mix, and leave out the parsley. As the previous reviewer notes, the cheese does clump somewhat, which we don't mind.

I can't decide if I like this recipe or not. More like 2-1/2 forks. Perhaps because something went wrong in the preparation because when I didn't get the pretty strands like you do in an egg-drop soup, and further, when I served it the egg and cheese clumped up and it didn't look very nice in the bowl. The flavors were nice, enough to get me to try it again. It seems mediterranean and I thought it paired nicely with the "green salad with goat cheese, artichoke hearts and migas" from this website, in which it mentions the salad is traditionally served with eggs in Spain.
