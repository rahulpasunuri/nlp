This recipe is excellent. The cormeal makes a delicate and crunchy coating on the shrimp. The aioli is flavorful with a nice kick. The best part is how quick and easy this is to make!

This is fantastic! I've made it several times now, all to rave reviews, even from non- shrimp eaters. I make it with smaller shrimp- -it's a little more work frying but the pieces are tangy and bite-sized.

I didn't make the shrimp, but i did make the aioli, which i served with roasted potatoes. If you like spice, you'll love this aioli...very, very good.

This recipe is delicious! I am not a spicy food fan, but with hedging the cayenne a bit it was perfect for my tastes. The shrimp are light and crispy -- not the heavy coating one usually expects with fried shrimp. And so easy to fry. The aioli is absolutely wonderful. Will make this again and again.

I doubled the cayenne and the lemon juice. I left on the tails and sauted the shrimp in peanut oil till crisp. They can be frozen: after cooling on a rack, put in a freezer bag and remove the air. Surprisingly, the aioli also froze well: placed in a freezer bag and flattened - again with the air removed. I re-heated the shrimp at 300F without defrosting; the aioli was defrosted by the time the shrimp was done.

This is easy to make and an enormous party favorite. I use regular mayo and splurge on already-cleaned shrimp. I suggest regular cornmeal rather than the more expensive stone-ground.

Good flavor, but the corn meal seemed to be too hard and coarse for the delicate shrimp. Perhaps the corn meal others used was ground finer than mine which was quite coarse.

I have made this receipe countless times for company and everyone loves it. I use regular mayonnaise and a little more cayenne. This recipe is definitely a winner in my house. Grace from Metuchen, NJ

Everybody thought this was a great change from typical shrimp cocktail. I used a form of corn meal called masa harina that has a granular texture and coated the shrimp very evenly.

My quests loved this. I love recipes like this. Everyone thinks I'm a gourmet.

The aioli was great! The cornmeal on the prawns are very good as well. I added a lot more cayenne to both the ailoli and the cornmeal mixture. We like things hot.

Not impressed...I have enjoyed every recipe I have made from this site but this one was not one of them. I made mayonaise from scratch and the aioli was definitely delicious but I was underwhelmed with the shrimp (I used fresh jumbo shrimp). Overall not worth the effort.

Terrific! I added a dash of extra cayenne, but I love spicy food! Since I served this to my family and friends, I have made the aioli constantly for those who keep requesting it. We have been eating it with anything from turkey sandwiches to other shrimp dishes. GREAT!!

Absolutely fantastic. I butterflied the shrimp and coated them in the cornmeal, then cooked them at the last moment when our guests arrived. I pan fried the shrimp--I don't think you have to deep fry them. I used cayenne to taste, and remember if you make the aioli ahead that it will get spicier as it sits. I coated chicken cubes with cornmeal the next night to use the extra aioli, and that was also super. A keeper!

I, too, put all of the cayenne in the aioli. When I realized the error, I put cayenne in the shrimp coating as well. No problem, the extra spiciness made it good. My guests loved this appetizer and I will definitely make it again.

I didn't make the crunchy shrimp, but I used the cayenne aioli as a dip for the Shrimp Sizzlers Shaw recipe and everyone at the party went crazy. They were meant to go together!

I accidently put all of the cayenne in the aioli, but it was fantastic and spicy. It would be great with potato wedges or raw veggies. I think next time I will make the aioli the same, but use boiled or sauteed shrimp.

Another thumbs up (or should I say forks up) for this one! Great to have for a snack at a cookout or with friends over for drinks! The cayenne aioli was fantastic!

This recipe is as easy as it gets. Makes drinks on the deck even more special. The cornmeal gives it a wonderful crunch. Make lots because your guests will beg for more.

Good, impressive appetizer. I will make it again because it's so easy.

I thought this was an excellent recipe. I also made this for a cocktail party and had many compliments. It was definately a hit. An easy and very tasty appetizer to make. The only thing I did different than the recipe was that I used the medium size shrimp rather than the jumbo. I think the medium is a better finger food. The cooking time was probably closer to a minute with the smaller shrimp though.

Easy as can be...I tripled this recipe for a cocktail party (no need to triple the cayenne aioli...there's plenty!) and it can also be done in advance and reheated on a baking sheet sprayed with Pam for just a few moments.
