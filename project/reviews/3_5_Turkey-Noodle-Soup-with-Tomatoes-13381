Thank you for the comments/tips. At first read there appeared to be so many suggestions for change that I questioned the high rating of the recipe. Once I read thru most of them it became clear that adding a soup boullion, salt and dry herbs of choice to stock pot are the key changes recommended. Super simple! It is simmering away on the stove top now and smells lovely.

I took advatage of some previous suggesions; -1 1/2 Tbls of kosher Salt -3 Tbls of homemade turkey gravey -Sprinkling of Poulty Seasoning - added fresh celery, carrots, onion and green pepper to the strained broth - precooked noodles (bow pasta) - 1 rounded Tbls of chopped fresh ginger instead of lemon

I have made this soup at least 4 times, the major change that makes this soup absolutely amazing is at the very end squeeze a fresh lemon into the soup.

This is the same family standard I have been making since I was old enough to pull turkey meat off the bone. It is a MUST for post holiday eating. I did not do tomatos because they just aren't in season and I don't do tomatos unless they are home-grown. Had I had a jar of Granny's canned tomatos from her garden, I might have gone that route, but since that wasn't available, I skipped it. Paired with white corn and rosemary herbed cornbread muffins, it was (as always) the hit of "left over Sunday"

Like another reviewer, I've been making turkey soup with the carcass for over 30 years - just as my mom did before me (and probably my grandmother too). I pull all the meat from the carcass and any leftover drumsticks, wings, skin etc. You do need to add a good bit of kosher salt (taste along the way) and I always add 2-3 whole allspice and some poultry seasoning. I recommend making your noodles separately and adding them to each bowl as you serve the soup. Oh and no no no tomatoes! Just fresh celery & carrots after the soup is strained. If you have leftover gravy (we rarely do) add it also. Yumm!

This is a great soup recipe for using up the remains of your turkey. I add fresh carrots and celery after the broth is made.

I made this after Thanksgiving and it was super easy and delicious. I skipped the whole carcass stock step, and used two cartons of chicken broth instead. I sauteed an onion and garlic in butter, added the broth, tomatoes and vegies and let it simmer for 20 minutes. Being from Santa Fe, I HAD to add my green chile (1/2 C roasted chopped) which gave it a little kick. I will definitely make again.

Unlike me, be sure to read the other reviews for ideas of what to add. I made Bon Appetit's "Spice Rubbed Turkey with Cognac Gravy" and thought I would have delicious broth because of all the seasoning on the bird, but this soup was disappointingly bland and tasteless. I do like the ease of the recipe, and with a few simple additions, I know the soup will be great, but be sure to have plenty of herbs and seasonings on hand before serving. I like how pretty the tomatos make it in the bowl.

I did not know this was an actual recipe. I've been doing this for years with turkey carcass. I add bay leaf & garlic to the stock process and omit the tomatoes. I use the old fashion store bought noodles and let the broth become absorbed into the noodles. I always serve with sour cream the way my German Grandmother made it.

I've been searching for THE soup recipe for after Thanksgiving. This is IT! Unbelievably delicious flavor. I discarded all the vegetables with the carcass, and since I love lots of carrots in my turkey soup, I added fresh slices when I reheated. I also like more pasta, so added cooked elbow macaroni, and it was great. Started to make this one night, put the carcass into the stockpot with water, then decided it was too late, and put the whole thing in the refrigerator. Curiously, the next morning the liquid looked like stock--like I had already cooked it. Have I stumbled onto something????

I used the carcass of a 16 lb. thanksgiving turkey that was well seasoned with rosemary. I made a few modifications. I added a good amount of salt to the stock. I also added lemon juice from one lemon for extra flavor which I highly recommend. I decided not to add any tomatoes to keep the flavor simple. I made the noodles (alphabet noodles) in a separate pot and added them to the finished soup. This avoided the problem with losing the broth which other reviewers reported. The soup was so delicious, served 3 with a loaf of french bread and froze three servings for later.

Roasted carcass first. Supplemented meat from carcass with additional cooked and cubed turkey. Didn't like the canned tomatoes in it so will use fresh plum tomatoes next time. Yummy.

This dish was surprisingly fantastic, given the simple ingredients. I made it AS IS...

I like this soup so much, I've made it after every Thanksgiving for four years. This year, we traveled to Ohio and my sister cooked Thanksgiving dinner. Not wanting to miss this soup this year, I was compelled to buy a turkey the day after Thanksgiving and roast the bird, just so I'd have the carcass to make this soup. Like other reviwers, I have extra chicken broth on hand to add day two, as the noodles suck up all the moisture and you're left with something resembling casserole rather than soup. Very tasty! Again!

This was great. I followed the suggestions of another reveiwer of roasting the carcass as it does bring out the flavor from the bones. I added chop zucchini and leeks as I had them on hand and thought they would go well in the soup. Lastly I garnished with some grated parmsean. What a lovely hardy soup for winter. This is a keeper recipe.

Sorry I didn't make this before the Thanksgiving company left! It is delicious. I added a large bouquet garni (of parsley, thyme and bay leaves) and put the carcass thru peppercorns in a large crockpot, and covered with chicken broth. I let it go all night. Disposed of the bones and refrigerated to solidify the fat, then removed. Then, reheated and continued with the canned tomatoes, etc. It was very tasty!

Love this soup! Made it 5 years running so far. We brown the carcass in the oven first, at 400* for 30 minutes, before simmering it for broth. This gives the bird a lot more flavor. Also, this soup needs zesting, so we add fresh ground salt & peppers, herbs, etc (pretty much whatever sounds good that year) plus 2 cans of low sodium chicken broth. Instead of noodles, we use orzo, and we try to salvage a few of the celery and onion chunks to toss back in for "greenery." This soup is better made one day ahead, but whatever "noodle" you use will soak up a good portion of your liquid, so an extra can or two of chicken broth (and water) is good to have on hand for re-heating. Serve with a crusty bread and a good table wine and you're set! Enjoy!

Such a great way to use the rest of the turkey. I've also scaled down the recipe for use with rotisserie chicken leftovers.

Thanks to the previous comments, I added to the basic recipe to spark it up. It is flat and bland as written. So I atarted adding and tasting and adding and tasting until I got it to my liking. It got better as the days past. I added a lot of salt. I like salt. Also a tsp of Old Bay, tyme, rosemary, poltry seasoning, pepper and the juice from a lemon. So make the basic soup and doctor it to your taste. It has served us well during the winter.

This soup is delicious though it does need some additions to pep it up! In addition to what the recipe called for, after the simmer and strain phase, I added two sliced carrots, two diced celery ribs, a sprig of fresh thyme, 1 teaspoon salt, a pinch each of seasoned salt, onion salt and garlic salt, and about 1/4 teaspoon of pepper. The soup looked and tasted perfect until the noodles absorbed a considerable amount of the broth. I added 1 can of chicken broth and an equal amount of water and the consistency of the soup was perfect! Enjoy!

Delicious! This has become a standard post-Thanksgiving soup in our household. I leave in the celery and other vegetable solids after the stock has cooked - why not? It adds a lot more interest. I make it and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight before serving it. This really brings out the flavors. I did add a can of chicken broth before warming and serving, because the noodles sucked up the stock. This is really a great, hearty, tasty soup. Highly recommended!

Add salt! (I don't normally add salt to things, but I thought it was much better after I did)

This soup was great. I added a little extra of everything, although I omitted the tomatoes. Before serving I put crushed tortilla chips at the bottom of the bowl and poured the soup over them, then I grated Montery Jack and Chedder cheese on top. It was fantastic!!! I will definately make this again.

This was a good healthy and hearty soup. I did find that I had to add extra garlic, salt, pepper, and herbs to give it enough flavor. I added 2 cans of chicken broth as well.

This recipe was similar to the one MOM use to make. I removed the tomatoes an added one bottle of Chardonnay. It made it "just like Mom's!"

This is just the soup you need when curling up in front of the fire! My husband and I added fresh carrots, celery, rice (instead of the egg noodles)and about a cup and a half of torn turley during the last hour of cooking time which we doubled. It was great...and we didn't even need the bouillon cubes!

we just finished eating this soup, and it was fantastic!! We used the leftover turkey from the Turkey with Chardonney and Herbs, and added the 2 cans of chicken broth as suggested by a previous reviewer. This is a great comfort food. You've got to try it :P

I am making this soup for the second time. I also added some bouillon cubes and some herbs.With fresh crusty bread this is a meal for us.

Very nice use for leftover Thanksgiving turkey. I added a little boullion because I agree with the previous reviewer that turkey stock is a little bland. Added mushrooms and used Orzo instead of egg noodles. This was very flavorful and filling.

This is exactly how I make turkey noodle soup except that I add 2 cans (or 3 cups homemade) chicken broth, and cut the garlic down to 2 cloves. Because turkey broth is blander than chicken broth it needs the added flavor. It turns out richer and very flavorful.
