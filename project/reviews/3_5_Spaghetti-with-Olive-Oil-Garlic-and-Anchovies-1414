I've made this a couple times in the past month. It is a good starting point, but lacks flavor as is. Definitely benefits from adding an add'l ingredient or two, such as oil cured olives and/or chopped sun dried tomatoes.

I have to agree with previous reviewer. I made with and without lemon, and I prefer without, given that I love anchovies.

The lemon takes away from the anchovy flavor. I will eliminate the lemon in the future. Otherwise it's a great easy recipe.

Extremely fast & easy. Double for 1 pound of pasta. I followed recipe exactly (but doubled it) and it was quite good. Lacks the subtle flavor of a bagna cauda or salsa verde, but I had it on the table within 1/2 hour of beginning to cook -- and it's hard to argue with that kind of speed.

I love this dish it was fast, easy and so delicious. I would definitely be making this again and again.

My kids love this, even as they remain blissfully unaware that it contains anchovies. When made exactly as the recipe says, it is a bit dry. My modifications: Double recipe. Beyond what's called for by doubling, add an extra 1/3 c of olive oil; use a cup of parsley, chopped; juice of half a lemon. To cook, puree garlic, then anchovies in food processor, adding the olive oil at end, then heat mixture for 5 minutes at end. The last step saves considerable time and makes this a superfast weekday meal.

My kids loved this recipe when they were little, back when they didn't know what an anchovy was. When made it again recently, they refused to eat it until I lied and told them I had omitted anchovies. Made it as the recipe called for, except doubled the lemon juice. Next time, will use more oil as the pasta was a little dry. I tripled the recipe overall, and this worked but tossing the sauce and pasta was a bit unwieldy. As did others, I used angel hair.

This is the FASTEST and EASIEST recipe that I have made in a long time. Not to mention that it was DELICIOUS. I wolfed it down and went back for more. Something about the flavour combination is just so simple and perfect. Highly recommended recipe.

The lemon is a nice twist that adds some more depth to a classic. Great recipe for when the cupboard is (almost) bare!

Spaghetti with garlic and olive oil is one of my favorite simple dinners but the addition of anchovies and lemon juice blew me away. I will make this again and again and I am also not an anchovy fan! I added a few mushrooms and cooked the anchovies until they melted into the sauce. I didn't have any parsely on hand but will definitely try that next!

This is a quick perfect recipe that is great the way it is. I too use angel hair and mash the anchovies until they dissolve into the oil. Sometimes I add hot pepper flakes, and don't skip the lemon juce, it's a great touch.

This is simple and soul-satisfying. Can't imagine ever getting tired of it. Excellent recipe.

I usually tinker around with recipes, but there is no need here. With the ground pepper adding just enough heat, the balance of flavors is perfect. As with previous reviewers, I don't think the cheese is necessary.

Outstanding! I have made recipes with these ingredients for years and this is the first time that there is a perfect balance of flavors and ingredients. The pasta had just the right amount of oil and the garlic and anchovy flavors blended perfectly. A simple and delicious recipe.

Simple and sensational. Use good-quality ingredients and you won't be disappointed.

I let the anchovies dissolve and then added red peppers or hot cherry peppers (or both) along with prosciutto to add additional flavor to this dish. Always a big hit.

When I first made this dish, I was hesitant about anchovies, so I substituted minced bacon. Other adaptations included a bit of minced rosemary instead of the parsley and diced ricotta salata tossed in afterward. but Since then I've grown to appreciate anchovies and am quite fond of the original recipe.

This recipe was so delicious. I added some sauteed mushrooms and chopped fresh tomato, and a little water from the pasta. I doubled the recipe, and the entire thing disappeared in no time! Big hit with my family, and I would definitely make it again.Four of us finished the entire doubled recipe. It is a good base recipe, and can be altered by adding whatever you can imagine- capers, eggplant, chicken tenders, sauteed peppers, etc., but it is DELICIOUS just as it is. Serve with garlicky bread and a crisp salad, and you too can have a bunch of happy campers.

Anchovy lovers of the world, unite! This is wonderful -- tasty, chock full o' anchovy flavor, and super-easy. So good, in fact, that it's become one of the basics in my repertoire...

Great easy dish, heaps of flavour and so easy to make. Make sure the pasta is still quite hard, and that you spread the parmesan cheese over all of it.

Took a chance (not being an anchovie lover)and made this. It was o.k., but I would not make it again, a bit too fishy for my taste.

Darn good and a basic for more! Husband loved it, surprised me, served with a decent white wine, crusty bread and salad, it was quick and worthy of a repeat. Just added mushrooms and some red pepper flakes, other reviewers are quite right, as much as I love cheese, you do not need it.

This was okay, but we prefer a similar recipe which uses clams and butter instead of the anchovies and olive oil. When we're in the mood for that sort of pasta we'll prepare that one instead.

Incredible! I took the advice of others and added chopped up prosciutto, some red pepper flakes and a handful of capers. I used elbow shaped pasta, so that everything was the same size. I would make this often.

I make a dish like this all the time, especially when I'm too tired to make a more complicated meal. I also throw in prosciutto and Kalamata olives. Yum!

I made numerous variations of this dish before trying this recipe. LOVED the addition of lemon juice. Simple, easy and classic. Even non-anchovy lovers will enjoy this!

IT'S WONDERFULLY SIMPLE. THE LEMON JUICE IS A GREAT ADDITION TO THE WAY I MADE IT. THANK YOU.

Simple, inexpensive and very tasty. Who could ask for more? After the sauce had cooked I thew in some Sicilian and dried black olives along with a finely chopped fresh tomato. Maybe next time I'll try a few artichoke hearts.

I thought I didn't like anchovies, but I tried this recipe anyway and loved it! I took a cue from one of the other cooks and added capers, and next time I think I'll use feta instead of parmasean. This is a perfect dish for a late night gab fest with an old friend -- quick and easy and very satisfying.

Excellent! I'd never cooked with anchovies before, but this meal was simple and delicious. I can imagine fixing this often as a last-minute meal on a weekday and being very happy.

I thought this was excellent! I added some red pepper flakes and mushrooms as other folks suggested. I enjoyed the left overs the next day. Sooooooo good!

This recipe is one that is better suited to little pasta like macaroni, small shells or orrechiette. I recommend that you try it with orrechiette. The lemon was a nice touch. It's part of recipe from now on.

This is tasty. I would suggest adding some drained capers (1/4 cup) and (1/4 cup) chopped Kalamata or other black olive that is packed in salt instead of brine . I like food to be quite flavourful with different textures too.

My Dad, and excellent cook, made this dish every year at our New Year's Eve parties growing up at home. Guests loved it - I make it now at least once a month. Angel Hair pasta works best for me.

My husband isn't a fan of anchovies but he LOVED this dish! There's just a hint of anchovies & I would recommend it highly to others -- it's easy, quick & delicious. I added dried crushed red pepper to this dish...YUMMY & it gave it a "kick".

This recipe turns out a fast and easy weekday dinner-- a quality which, as a college student, I've lately come to appreciate. I added toasted breadcrumbs in lieu of grated cheese and found it delicious, particularly with a green salad on the side.

Rating: 3
Great recipe with ingredients that I almost always have on hand. I doubled the recipe, but not quite double the oil. Taking the advise of other recipes I have read, the additional garlic I used I added raw. Also lengthened the sauce a bit with 1/4 cup of the pasta cooking water. Finally, a nice pinch of kosher salt. Perfect.

I've already made this twice! The second time I threw in some sauteed mushrooms & onions to add more texture or a different consistency. Fabulous! I only have a little problem with the anchovies clumping. But otherwise, this is a great comforting dish.

I have made this many times at the request of my family. We love it. The anchovies add a wonderful saltiness to this dish, not fishiness. My 12 yr. who doens't like anchovies, actually gets happy when I make this. Often, I serve sliced cucumbers, lightly salted and broiled buttered and garlic powdered, english muffins.

I made this two nights ago for the first time and am making it again tonight. My husband loved it!I served mine with the cheese and quite liked it. I served it with crusty bread , a green salad, and dry red wine. It is a great light meal.

delicious if you like strong, pungent flavours. I don't think the cheese goes well with this dish. The fish/oil/garlic combination deserves to be savoured alone. Eat it with a friend or eat it alone!

I use the salted anchovies often found in Italian Deli shops. They are packed in salt in large tins. You need to wash the salt off under cold water. Makes for a wonderfull meal! helps to have a nice white wine and good fresh bread! Have it once a month. I never use grated cheese with fish.

On a cold, wet, winter's night this was a delicious tangy meal. Of course I used the Western Australian 'Auschovies' which are plump and juicy. Great with a South Australian red wine!!!
