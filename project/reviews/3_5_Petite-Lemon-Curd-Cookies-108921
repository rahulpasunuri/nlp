Did I miss something? the curd turned out great, but the dough was AWFUL. i ended up throwing out the cookies and then just using a sugar cookie recipe i had and that worked fine. really, this is a terrible butter cookie recipe.

Really great and light, a lovely cookie. I ran out of time and made a few curds/pastry creams and had everyone dip the thin buttery cookies instead of sandwiching them. It was great! Highly Recommended!

A delicious cookie. Rave reviews from my guests. Tastes like lemon tart but in easy to eat cookie form. I was worried that the butter cookie would be too hard but once you pipe the lemon curd on and let them sit for a few hours, the cookies soften just enough so that when you bite into them the lemon filling doesn't squish out. Yum.

Oh, wow, these were great and were gobbled up. Made them as a trio with pistacio orange lace cookies and 3 ginger cookies. This sophisticated dessert was perfect with ice cream and alone afterward. Full recipes were devoured by 8 people in 2 days!

Absolutely excellent. Like other reviewers I created logs of dough, chilled them, and cut them to make circles. Much easier, and they still look perfectly circular as long as you are careful to make a perfect log before freezing/refrigerating. I made my cookies the day before and filled them, and I had no problems with my cookies being too mushy or too hard. People could not stop popping them in their mouths! Consider making these alongside rich desserts- these will seem so light!

i make these every year for christmas cookies and people always request them. i make them very, very small so they are extra petite but always have some lemon curd left over. i think these are just wonderful little cookies.

I love this curd! I made it with lime instead of lemon. The butter cookies with the curd are good too. A little messy, because I put too much curd between the cookies.

No one in the family was very fond of this recipe. I ended up throwing out about 1/2 dozen of them.

I loved this recipe! They came out great. Not only did I fill them with lemon curd, but on some I used jam and others nutella (hazelnut chocolate spread). You can even use a store bought lemon curd to cut down on the time. But this lemon curd recipe is very delicious. I used a small fluted shot glass as my cookie cutter. It was just the right size. For those who complain about the cookies getting soggy, please read the recipe notes at the bottom. They tell you that you can store the cookies dusted in powdered sugar BUT not with the curd. So make the cookies ahead of time and spread the curd on day you plan to serve. I had no problems with this recipe and would definitely make it again.

Wow, these are amazing! I have a party this weekend, so I did a test run on them tonight to make sure that they would be good. I added 1TBS zest to the cookies. I made half rolled out and cut out half. It is easier to cut them, but they are obviously better looking cut out (more uniformly round). I made them very small (about an inch) and baked at 390 for 5 min (allowing them to cool on the cookie sheet). I added the 20 degrees because I am at high altitude. I also sifted the powdered sugar over the tops only. I cant wait to show off my beautiful little cookies this weekend!

This cookie is too much of a pain for what you get out of it. Plus, though it photographs very nicely, the powder sugar blows all over the place. The cookies also get soggy after a half a day from the curd. HOWEVER, this is the BEST curd recipe I've found. Though most the cookies got trashed, I used the curd for mousse AND a double layer lemon cake and still had some left over. This is now my staple curd recipe...I won't make these little nuisances again though.

Unfortunately, I was in a hurry and used unbaked store bought sugar cookie dough. The cookies were fine until I put the lemon curd on the cookies. Within three hours they were soggy (but still edible by some standards!). It sounds like taking the time to actually make cookies from scratch is well worth it. Additionally, I used lime, instead of lemon, and loved it!

these cookies are good but yes the key is to make them small. first off, the recipe for the butter cookies... well my dough was a bit crumbly making it hard to roll out and stamp out circles without it splitting apart or cracking. any solutions? the way they tasted was just fine. the lemon curd i thought was good. just the right about of sweetness and tartness. putting them together? not a problem.. eating them. large problem. maybe they should really be bite size because any bitter causes you to bite it in half leading to the curd oozing out everywhere. so good recipe, just make them bite size for like a child.

This were very good and my guests enjoyed them. If I make them again, I will definitely take others advice and make them smaller. Mine were about an inch and a half diameter. They were a little messy and crumbly to eat daintily. The cookies were a little harder than I might have liked, but still very good.

Thanks for the suggestions from other reviewers - I made these for a party and didn't have any leftover. Making your own curd is well worth it - store bought just doesn't have any kick. Rolling the dough into logs and slicing was a snap. No need to dredge in powdered sugar, just dust a little over the tops. Small, Small, Small is key, as other reviewer said.

I made these cookies for a bake-off and won! They were excellent. I didn't dredge the cookies in powdered sugar, just sifted over the top for serving. I made them the night before and stored in an airtight container in the fridge, the lemon curd firmed up nicely and everyone loved them.

These cookies are wonderful! So easy and so tasty! The lemon curd is perfect, just tart enough without being too tart and just sweet enough without being coyingly sweet. I won't dredge the cookies in 10X sugar again, however, I will sift the sugar over them. Also, I made them really small and they were adorable.

The cookie and the lemon curd were absolutely delicious. A fairly easy recipe to make. Just to make thing easier, before you put the cookie dough in the fridge, form a roundish column. When you take it out you can just cut from the column instead of rolling out the dough. Saves time!

Everyone loved these cookies!! The basic butter cookie recipe is great. I browned my butter and let it set and cool before using for the cookies. The first time I made this, I made lemon curd from scratch--very time consuming. So, the second time I used purchased lemon curd and you could notice the difference in freshness and tartness from the homemade---but still delicious! Instead of chilling and using the log method, I rolled the dough into small balls and flattened them in the palm of my hand. Added the lemon curd and carefully sealed the dough around the lemon curd. Rolled it into a ball and baked. Works great!

These cookies were delicious. I love lemon so I added a tablespoon of zest to the cookie dough. I also substituted 1 cup raw sugar in the dough recipe, it makes the cookies light and crispy because of the larger granules. Rolling the dough into logs and slicing was a useful suggestion, thanks! I used store bought lemon curd to save time with great results.

We love these cookies and they are a must every year. To avoid squishing the filling and making a mess it is really important to make them small, small, small. Also I use a knife to spread a small amount of curd. Love them.

I usually love all the recipes I try from Gourmet, and had my eye on this recipe for a long time! I really love fresh lemon flavors (used freshly picked lemons from our tree) but will someone tell me how to eat these without the filling squishing out all over your hands? That's what I didn't enjoy about this recipe! (perhaps a more delicate baked cookie -- flakier and not so stiff -- would solve this dilemma)! I did follow everyone's suggestions about forming dough into log (instead of rolling out dough and using cookie cutter), not sprinkling with sugar until end, etc. and these were all very good suggestions! The flavors of the cookie with the lemon curd together were really good (although the lemon curd was a bit on the tart side). What we wound up doing was just putting lemon curd on one cookie and eating it "open-faced"! It was delicious that way too! I did not assemble that many cookies, and instead froze the plain baked cookies to use later in other recipes!

I wanted to love this recipe. I love sugar cookies. I love lemon curd. And I followed the recipe to the letter. But these were too much trouble to make, too messy to eat, and not particularly tasty.

Like a little bite of lemon pie. People really commented on this addition to my holiday cookie tray. Coat the cookies with powdered sugar when they are warm, but give them a little dusting when you present them. They look beautiful. Try them with a thin layer of tart cherry preserves (heat till runny, then press through a sieve and cool before filling cookies.)

Still one of my favorite cookies. Anyone can bring a chocolate chip to the party--but show up with these little gems and you'll have people asking you for the recipe. Mistakes happen but this cookies is generally foolproof. Make a double batch of dough because there is so much curd leftover. Dust with powdered sugar after assembled for presentation but they really dont need the powdered sugar for taste. Hey, if you dont like lemon make a ganauche filling.

pretty silly to make lemon cookies when you hate lemon and you hate cookies but whatever. these are great. they are wonderful. one thing is that the filling squishes out when you bite them but i am still having people asking me to make them again. i don't roll the hot cookies in powdered sugar though. the sugar doesn't stick right and it makes them too sweet. they are perfect without it.

Excellent! Tart and refreshing. The small size makes this just the perfect bite. I used the Basic Butter Cookie Dough recipe (1995), rather than the one provided with the recipe due to reviews on this one, and it worked out perfectly. Will definitely use again!

What a great cookie! I made the dough in advance and froze it for about 2 weeks. Then when I assembled the cookies (without the powder sugar) I froze them again until I was ready to serve them. They held up beautifully--and I got lots of compliments on these dainty, flavorful gems.

yum! Definitely worth the effort involved.

Really wonderful and not all that hard. I used two different sizes of small star shaped cutters. Substituted Meyer lemon juice for the regular lemon juice. Best to let these sit a while. The cookie is still crisp the first day, but softens up by the next and melds well with the lemon curd.

I gave these out for christmas and they were a huge hit. Becuase I packaged them, I didn't use the icing sugar at all. Instead I lightly brushed the top cookies with egg whites and sprinkled them with turbonado sugar, just as pretty and less mess.

By far the best cookie I have ever made. I doubled the cookie recite and only one curd recite and there was plenty for both batches.

well lessee... first, the butter cookies werent really what i expected; they arent flaky, they are crisp. second, dont use this lemon curd recipe... i tried it and had to throw the whole thing out. a more foolproof curd recipe goes along with the "lemon mousse napoleans" on this site. so, after tossing the first try and retrying with the other curd recipe, the ultimate result is so-so. tastes like lemon bars. i guess they are kinda cute though. good luck.

I made these for hostess gifts last year and people are asking for them again. Instead of rolling and cutting them for round cookies I used a very small heart shaped cookie cutter it was much easier and less time consuming. I also did half with lemon and half with Key Lime curd.

These were a great addition to a dessert buffet at church. There is NO way I could have made them in the allotted time, though. Started the day before, making curd and shaping the dough into logs to slice & bake next day(which saved time, though the cookies weren't quite round). Then baked and assembled next a.m. for evening event, which helped them settle and soften. The curd was fabulous and easy--don't settle for store-bought, because you need the flavor punch to make these special.

These cookies did take some work, but turned out wonderfully. They were even better the next day (they became a bit softer). Like other reviewers, there was plenty of lemon curd left over. The curd was nice and tart. The only thing is that the lemon curd took a lot longer than the suggested times.

Good recipe, but had a lot of left-over curd (made into nice little lemon & graham cracker ramekins). At a 1/4" of cookie, we found them a little hard at the max time - recommend cooking a little lighter and perhaps chilling the cookies once sandwiched before serving. Less icing sugar means also less messy...

Rating: 3
These are beautiful, yummy cookies. Here's what I did a little differently to save time: rolled them into two long logs approx 1 1/2 inch in diameter and after refrigeration I just sliced them off. I didnt dredge in powdered sugar until they were already sandwiched. They made a lovely presentation and looked great in a gift basket.

Takes some time and effort (especially dredging in sugar), but with fantastic results. Make sure you roll the dough out very evenly - the cookies cook quickly, and if there is variation they will cook unevenly. I had quite a bit of leftover lemon curd, and plan to make blintzes with it. I agree with other reviewers that these cookies are much better the next day (I stored them in the refrigerator in an airtight container).

I have a question I hope someone can answer. I want to make these cookies right away but I would like to know if they can be frozen. I know the cookie itself could, but can they be assembled with the curd filling and then frozen. thanks in advance.

In response to the gentleman who asked about the lemon curd - yes, jarred lemon curd will work in a pinch, but homemade lemon curd is usually safe, too. The egg yolks are cooked, so the risk for food-borne illness is greatly reduced. (Homemade has an incomparable flavor, too.) These cookies are wonderful, I made some for a dinner party I hosted and I had to fight with my friends for even one!! If you're going to make these, make two batches - you'll need them!

These were fantastic! Several friends said these were the best cookies they had ever tasted. One modification, though: I found that dredging the butter cookies in the sugar was an unnecessary step. They were just as good left plain, with a dusting of icing sugar at the end. I found I had to handle the cookies too much to shake off the excess sugar from the dredging. Also used logs of dough rather than cookie cutter - much easier. Make these soon, you won't be disappointed!

These cookies are fantastic! The curd is nice and tart, the cookies sweet and buttery, and the combination of flavors is just right. They take a little bit to assemble, but the wait is well worth it. I'm sure this will become a staple in my recipe box, as it hits my lemon craving just right.

I intend to make these cookies this Christmas. They sound wonderful! I, too, will be sending some through the mail. No, the curd is not perishable, but anything with curd in it is a bit clumsy to mail.

Sorry, no rating--I just have a question. I'd like to make these cookies and send them to friends, but I guess the lemon curd here is perishable. Do all of you experienced bakers know if jarred lemon curd would be safe to use? Thanks.

I just tried one of these cookies made by a friend. It is an amazingly delicious cookie. Sweet, tart, great texture. I rushed home to find the recipe. It is something like a lemon square, but really even better. She said that the texture for the cookie was better today, one day after making them. The flavors and moistness must need to blend.
