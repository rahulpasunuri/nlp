I make this all the time. It's easy and delicious. You could certainly find a fancier recipe, but I see no need.

Cooked for over 3 hours and had to finish it in a pressure cooker. Very bland it needed spices not in the recipe. I will stick to more traditional osso buco recipes.

I have made this recipe several times. It is one of my absolute favorites -- a real comfort food recipe

Very easy to make. I used veal breast and canned tomatoes and turned the veal halfway through the cooking time. Incredibly tender. Recommend adding a few garlic cloves (whole, to taste). I would make this again!

There was nothing fabulous about the flavor of this dish, but it is extremely easy. I did sear with 2 T olive oil first before baking. I served it with leftover carmelized onion and tomato linguine (BA March 02). That gave it the flavor it needed. I served my husband the mashed potato like the recipe indicated, but he said it was bland.

This is a meal that is so easy to make and makes a very impressive presentation. It is so wonderful because the meat is just tender beyond anything that you've ever tasted.

I've made this dish several times and I love it. Great taste, and one of the easiest recipes ever. I just made it for a Halloween dinner and it was easy to put it in the oven and have it finished when the kids were back in from trick-or-treating.

I didn't think this was special. The sauce needed extra spices to "perk it up", and the veal was tender, but not like when you brown it first.

This recipe is great-very easy to get going in advance for guests and it looks impressive. I have prepared it 4 times. I cut the cooking time down to 2 1/2 hrs. and added a little beef stock to the au jus as it reduced for more flavor. Make sure to use ripe tomatoes.

I agree...this is a delicious and easy dish that's perfect for company.

This is a wonderful dish. The sauce is great. In order to avoid dryness use canned Italian tomatoes in place of fresh. They enhance the flavors even more, and there's plenty of savory sauce to ladle over the garlic mashed potatoes that I served with the shanks.

I made this dish for an informal dinner party, and received rave reviews--though I used my own very special recipe for mashed potatoes! I also served rice with the veal, which some guests preferred with the onion and tomato flavors as oposed to the potatoes. The next time I prepare this recipe, I am going to serve an italian risotto, which will be a fabulous accompaniment.

A wonderful dish, although I had to add about one half cup of wine to prevent burning. Also, the au jus idea just wasn't working on the plates so I dumped all of the sauce into my mini food processor, along with 1/4 cup of chicken broth, and just barely processed it. It came out very chunky and the taste was fabulous.
