I bought tomatillos for another recipe and couldn't find it so i decided to try making salsa and it was very good. I'm not a fan of cilantro so i omitted that

Quick and easy way to use tomatillos from the garden! I also used jalapeno pepper, added dice white onion, and substituted fresh lime juice for the water. Consistency was great! I will definitely make this again.

This was delicious, even with a few substitutions. Used a fresh jalapeno since I didn't have a serrano,omitted the water (it would have been too thin), and added a bit of lime juice and salt.

This was great! It had a really nice tang to it. I changed a couple of things. First, I used 1/2 lb of tomatillos like stated, but used 2 serrano chilies and 3 cloves of garlic. I didn't feel like chopping the chiles, or anything, so I just roasted them with the tomatillos and garlic for about 5 minutes, and threw them in the blender with some cilantro. It turned out so good. I would definitely make this again, as it required almost no effort and took 10 minutes.

YUM! I swapped lime juice for the water but the rest was perfect!

Oh, and I left out the water. No need for it in my opinion, the texture was just right as is.

Surprisingly tasty for virtually no effort. I will make this all the time now. I added a tiny splash of lime juice and some cumin. Left out the seranno entirely for the kids and it was still tasty, although the adult version was much better!

Delicious, I love the flavor of the tomatillos.

Fresh tomatillo salsa is very tasty and this is the basic recipe, not really much else to do with it. I only give it 3 forks because there is nothing really earth-shattering about it. To the reviewers who recommend roasting the tomatillos, that is also a very good tomatillo salsa, but it is different. You can make salsa from tomatillos basically three ways: fresh, roasted or boiled. All have different flavor profiles, but if you roast them, that's an entirely different dish for which epicurious has many recipes (nearly all of them the same).

My CSA gives us a salsa "kit" with tomatillos, a jalapeno, and a little cilantro. Their recipe is similar, but they recommend boiling the tomatillos. I much prefer them fresh (as in this recipe). I added an onion, which negated the need for water. Great recipe.

This is the best salsa verde.I omitted the water, roasted the tomatilloes and charred the pepper on the gas grill before pulsing it all in the food processor. I also added a little bit of avocado and extra salt and it was delicious!

I took the advice of another review and quick roasted the cut up tomatillos in a hot cast iron, added the garlic at the end. RAVE reviews.

Very nice topper for a chicken and white bean chili that I made this evening. I made it as directed, but omitted the water based on previous reviewers remarks (though one person did say that the water would help the tomatillos gel, so I was tempted to add it). I'll bet that roasting the tomatillos makes it even better.

Awesome recipe for a nice simple delicious salsa verde. I like to pulse the tomatillos in the blender/processor for a couple of seconds.

easy and tasty. i used fresh lime juice instead of water and a touch of cumin.

very yummy... a little more watery than I would like, so I would reserve some of the water before pureeing next time... but besides that, yum!

How about roasting the tomatillos in a very hot skillet first...cast iron works the best. I like the addition of garlic and onions too, all the better if you roast those as well. This roasting adds so much depth to the flavor!

It's really tough to get this one wrong, sometimes for texture I will add chopped white onion along with the rough chopped cilantro at the very end (I process the rest) this makes a little chunkier texture while still being VERY quick! The water really helps since the tomatillos will gel. Another variation, roast, or toast the tomatillos and garlic for a smokey flavor, or replace the chiles with canned chipotles, Yum!
