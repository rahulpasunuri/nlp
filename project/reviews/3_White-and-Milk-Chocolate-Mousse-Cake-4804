Many reviewers on this site have complained about the flatness of the cake. There is nothing wrong with the recipe if those making it will notice that it comes from Ireland. Cakes in Ireland are small and flat, quite different from the large, fluffy cakes made in the United States. I am an American who lives in Northern Ireland and have had to get used to this difference in baking styles.

Oh my goodness! This cake was a disaster (and I've made a LOT of cakes in my day)! For all the money I spent on wonderful chocolate, I could have made something extraordinary- instead, I had a flat cake and a recipe that doesn't call for enough mousse to cover each layer of the cake. How are you suppose to cut this flat, 1.5" high cake into THREE layers? I can't even fathom cutting it into two!! (Incedentally, my top layer was about .25" high and paper thin... good thing that the outer layer is rubbery!) Can ANYONE make this cake rise, I ask?! Never again would I make this cake. Time for a new Mousse Cake recipe.

I have made this cake at least 5 times - and i've used all different kinds of liqueurs (whatever is on hand). The cake part is always flat, but everyone loves it! I recently made it for a birthday party, and the guests couldn't get enough. If someone can figure out how to make the cake rise, I would give this 4 stars. Definitely worth the effort - flat cake and all.

What a disaster!! I tried to make the cake twice. Both times it was flat and came out like rubber. I have absolutely no idea what went wrong. I finally gave up and used a box mix that I had in the cupboard for the cake. I then followed the rest of the recipe, except I used kaluha instead of the orange liquer. Everyone liked it, and I will probably use the mousse again along with a different cake recipe.

I made this cake for my fiance's birthday. I had to make the cake twice because the first time it was flat. I realized that I beat the air of the batter when I added the dry ingredients; my folding technique was lacking then. But I am thankful to say that I redeemed myself and made a light and delightful cake. The mousses are to die for! I used Callebaut white and milk chocolates. I omitted the orange liquer, only using orange juice. For the bittersweet chocolate I used Michel Guizel. I omitted the coffee because we don't consume coffee, but I think that skipping that made the chocolate mixture grainy. Perhaps it was because I used 85% bittersweet chocolate; I don't know. So, I sprinkled slivered almonds and pressed them onto the chocolate. It came out lovely. It was certainly an easy recipe, and I will definitely make it again. My fiance LOVED it and thanked me profusely! :-)

I used just the mousse part of this recipe to fill the Inside Out German Chocolate Cake from this site because I made that cake at Christmas and liked the texture and flavor of the cake. I also used the glaze from the German Choc. cake modifying it by adding some milk choc. to the glaze. I'd have to say it was excellent except for the white choc. mousse...It just didn't taste right and I usually love a white chocolate mousse. I'll keep looking for that. The milk chocolate mousse from this recipe was fine though.

I usually don't have so many problems with baking. I used a self-rising flour like the recipe said and it didn't rise. Did anyone else have this problem? I had to remake the cake batter part just to get two layers. After reading all the great reviews I was very disappointed in this recipe.

I am a fanatic about chocolate and this is the perfect fix for me. It has the perfect amount of chocolate without going overboard. I loved it and so did my guests. Thanks for the recipe.

To Trish: If you like the espresso in the chocolate glaze, try Kaluha or any coffee liqueur in place of the orange. Bailey's Irish cream would also be good and Godiva makes an amazing chocolate liqueur. But as a certified choclaholic, my favourite has to be Godet belgian white chocolate liqueur brushed on the cake layers. Have fun choosing!

I loved the cake, but I am not a huge fan of oranges. Any suggestions for alternate liqueurs would be great. Thanks in advance to those who help out.

Totally decadent and wonderful. I slightly overcooked the cake, but compensated by making a white chocolate frosting as well which I drizzled over the bittersweet and used as a colis around the dessert.
