I thought I'd love this recipe--I'm always a fan of a lot of flavor, this combination of spices is delicious, and who doesn't love beef tenderloin? But in the end, the spices overwhelmed the beef flavor, and left it tasting a little too perfumed. Bummer. Beef tenderloin is a special meal, and I ended up wishing I'd stuck to something simpler that let the beef shine more.

Great recipe. In AZ we can find spices in smaller quantities at the supermarket that caters to the Hispanic population. It made it easy and less expensive to purchase all of the various seeds called for. Used this for Christmas dinner for 12 people. Rave reviews.

This was very easy to make and came out delicious. The only thing I did not like was the cumin scent seemed to be a bit overpowering so I may skip it next time.

Excellent, at the beginning I was a little scare, for all the amount of ingredients with such a strong flavoring, but I do highly recommend it, and actually I made it in the grill, and loved it!

A very expensive cut of meat, but well worth it. I served this (along with the rest of the Blithe Spirit menu) for a birthday and it was delicious... very tender and flavorful.
