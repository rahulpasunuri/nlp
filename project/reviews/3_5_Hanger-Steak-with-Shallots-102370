Great recipe - very tasty every time. Quick, easy, and inexpensive.

If I could, I would give this recipe 3 1/2 stars. It's quite delicious and the prep time is short. I made this as written though I don't think it really needed much - if any - butter at the end. I don't find it exceptional (hence the 3 stars) but I definitely plan to make this again and again.

I had the same problem as some other reviewers in that my steak was too thick. I had read the reviews and pounded it to 3/4" but it was completely raw in the middle after being seriously browned (the juices in the pan were about to burn) and allowed to sit under a powerful heat lamp while I made the sauce. I had to slice it and broil the slices to get it on the table in time. I found the sauce very unattractive (picture cloudy meat blood) and I didn't even think it was all that tasty.

Excellent!! I served it both hot and cold with salad. Easy, looks....well not the most beautiful for presentation but makes up in flavor. Definitely a keeper.

Not one of the best looking meals I've made, but one of the most delicious.

This dish comes out great every time. The shallots make it. It has become a frequent favorite.

Great meal to make when entertaining. Made this for a dinner party, didnt end up spending the whole night in the kitchen yet my guests raved about it.

This is a wonderful and fast week night meal for my very active family of 4. I typically prepare it without the shallots for speed, and serve it with a salad and some type of potato. Hanger steak has a very rich flavor, and when prepared medium rare as this recipe suggests, is very tender yet chewy. Please don't get hanger steak confused with skirt or flank steak. While they all come from a similar part of the cow (the diaphragm), the hanger is definitely a separate cut, and more tender than the others. Also, it can be difficult to find in your super market... I started ordering from Niman Ranch, and asked my local butcher shop to order for me... now I'm only paying $5.99/lb instead of $20+/lb! Don't be afraid to ask, but make sure they know the specific cut you're looking for! Good luck!

This is an excellent recipe--works like a charm and hanger steak is a marvellous cut. I agree with the other reviewers that this is best made with the designated cut. I made this with roasted potatoes and it was lovely.

I was introduced to this method of cooking steaks years ago by Julia Child's recipe. I use thin ribeyes. The selection of beef cuts are limited where I live but ribeyes work fine.

Just wanted to share my experience, which was that a gourmet butcher sold me a hanger steak which almost 2" thick. Thinking that all hanger cuts were the same thickness, I followed this recipe and ended up with a seared/burned outside but TOTALLY RAW inside (and I love medium rare meat, so it's not that I was freaked out by a little blood). If your butcher offers you a large cut like this, have them plane it cross-sectionally so you get a real bistro thickness (certainly less than 1").

This tasted great, but the shallot sauce was an unappetizing dark red colour. I used cab; maybe something else would have cooked down differently?

Hanger steaks are a revelation! Great beef taste, easily found at Whole Foods. I made this recipe twice, once with Merlot, once with Cab which I thought was a bit better. My steaks took a little longer than the time indicated to get to perfect medium rare, I monitored with inst read therm. Run, don't walk, to the meat counter and get hanger steaks...

I've made this dish several times now, and I can't say just how good it is. The sauce is the perfect accompaniment to the hanger steak. Outstanding!

Why can't I find a hanger steak in my refrigerator?

This is the most fabulous steak dish I have ever had. The hanger or skirt steak cut is a must. Instead of using store bought red wine vinegar and red wine, we simply used some of the nice red wine left over from last week. Not quite wine, and not quite vinegar....but unbelievably lush in flavor (unlike most store bought wine vinegars). A great use for those not-quite empty bottles that we never choose to drink the next day. I serve it with roasted broccoli (dry broccoli "fingers" baked on a cookie sheet with olive oil and coarse salt for half an hour at 350F), and everyone goes wild for this meal.

Great! A great use of hanger steak, and very fast for a last-minute meal. The flavors were good-- not too subtle or complex-- but bistro good.

I agree with other reviewers...if you don't use hanger steak, don't bother to rate this recipe. The sauce itself is not the point. I bought hanger steak today at the urging of my butcher--thought I was crazy at the time as it is a rather unappetizing-looking cut of meat. Came home and found this recipe. Followed it fairly strictly, but used less shallots and used a 1/4 cup beef broth too after the wine reduced. This is amazing, hanger steak is great! Go for it...

This recipe has been a favorite of mine for many years. It is always a crowd pleaser! Unless you find a hanger steak, please don't review the recipe.

I am a Chef at a French restaurant and this dish is often served, It is quick to prepare and guest continuously ask for it. Simply delightful

This was fast, unusual and delicious. Flap or flank steak done rare is a must. I added 1-2 tbsp of dijon mustard to the sauce, very good. I served it with yukon gold mashed potatoes in which I had added some gruyere cheese, then ladled some of the shallots and sauce on that as well. Went over well with the family.

Search out a butcher or a gourmet grocer and use hanger steaks only!! They are also called butcher steaks and onglet in French. I followed the recipe exactly but I did not have alot of sauce....next time I will use a little less shallots and chop instead of slice them. They still tasted great though....by the way do not cook them as long as stated in recipe, ifound 1 1/2 to 2minutes per side was enough for medium rare which is the only way hanger steaks should be eaten.

Please do not bother to rate this recipe if you have not bothered to find the cut of beef called for, as that is the key! If you can't find hanger steak, you could try skirt steak; or maybe even flank steak in a pinch, but NOT London broil, as it is usually top round, which is one of the least flavorful cuts of beef. This is an excellent dish with an intense beef flavor and is only diminished by other cuts...even the more expensive. Use the real thing, OK?

Hanger steak is a very flavorful cut which should not be substituted by more expensive cuts -- the results will be completely different. Maybe that's why the Boston cook was disappointed. The closest cut is a strip steak, but even that doesn't have the flavor of hanger (butcher's) steak. Try to find it!!

I am shocked to say that I though this dish was quite bland. The sauce lacked inspiration. I am all for simple sauces made with great ingrediants, but this one came up short.

Excellent dish! I've made this dish 3 times. Everyone loves it. The first time I made this I used Filet Mignon, which was delicious. However when I cooked for 8 guests, I used a very good quality london broil from the butcher. It actually came out very good with the london broil. I would definitely make this again, until my husband gets sick of it. This is a great dish for company - very nice presentation & excellent taste!!

we were fortunate enough to have this dish (and several others) at "brasserie les halles" in washington this spring--what a treat that place was! so i was very pleased to see this recipe and tried it out yesterday. i used a sirloin steak and while my technique didn't produce a dish that looked as nice as theirs, it certainly had a great flavor!

Wonderful flavor!! I thought the sauce was absolutely delicious, although I have no idea what hanger steaks are and I used a strip loin (next time I will splurge and buy filet mignon).
