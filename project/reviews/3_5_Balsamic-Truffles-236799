This is a good recipe to work from. I added dried cherries to the base and dipped them in milk chocolate before coating with the hazelnuts. Everyone thought they were fantastic!

I was surprised by how easy these were to make. Based on other reviewer's comments, I tried making the Robert Linxe recipe as well but found the finished product to be less attractive and no tastier. His recipe is faster to make, but I'll likely stick with this in the future.

I made these two years in a row now. They are easy and simply wonderful. I gave them away as gifts last year and got many compliments. I would highly recommend this recipe!

The truffle making process is very messy, but not at all difficult. I followed the recipe for my first batch, using some truly aged balsamic vinegar, and they were delicious. I later made another batch, experimenting with white chocolate coating (make sure it's cooled quite a bit, and work quickly or the dark center will melt through) and add-ins (chopped dried cherries) for the truffle center. All were delicious.

Probably the worst truffle recipe on this site. The consistency is not good, it was hard to shape them and the taste wasn't anything special either.
