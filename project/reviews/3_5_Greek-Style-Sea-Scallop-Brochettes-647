Just to add a hint - don't overcook the scallops. They only need a few minutes on a hot grill. Spray with oil first.

I took the advice of others and added a little (2 tsp) lemon juice to the marinade. I also used medium sized scallops, fresh oregano and added a bit of mint from the garden. This was exceptional, very pretty, and totally delicious.

This was so very good. Served the scallops on fresh salad spinach with a light dressing.

Although this one is aesthetically quite nice, it was a bit of a let-down on taste. Even with the use of fresh garlic and fresh oregano, I found this recipe to be a bit too bland for my taste. A note on the bay leaves... try soaking them in tepid water for about ten minutes before skewering them. After soaking them, I had only one leaf that split; the rest were quite easy to handle.

This was OK, but I wasn't crazy about it. It smelled great, though. I used dried oregano, which I think was fine. Dry bay leaves are nearly impossible to swewer without breaking! Served with orzo and greek salad.

This makes a beautiful presentation and is delicious with fresh sea scallops. We added fresh rosemary to the oil mixture and grilled as directed. A worry-free dish b/c we quickly assembled it an hour and half before guests arrived and then pulled it out when needed - so easy and so pretty.

excellent appetizer recipe but could definitely serve as a main course!

It is quit good for a low fat and tasty meal. I added a little more of garlic, oil, and oregano. I also had jumbo scallops which is good for a very hot grille. Lemon zest accented fork mashed potatoes gave it just the right flavor. Enjoy!

Excellent and very easy. Added a dash of lemmon juice to the oil etc. Could have eaten many more than the budget afforded.
