These are great and easy to make, no modification needed for recipe. You can get frozen lime leaves at asian markets. Should stay away from using Rhododendron leaves, some are poisonous, levels of poison vary, why take the chance?

The leaves were a snap to make. They turned out perfectly by spreading one layer of the layer on each leaf, putting them in the freezer for 15 minutes, then adding a second, much thicker layer. They really make a spectacular and memorable presentation.

These leaves are much easier than you would expect! Only let them set for 45 minutes after applying the chocolate. If they get too cold, they break more easily. Instead of the gold leaf, you can get powdered sugar at Joann's Fabric in the section for cake decorating. It is only a few dollars. I couldn't find gold, but the silver shade worked well and the presentation was beautiful.

I made this recipe for our cul-de-sac's annual winter holiday progressive dinner. Not only is it beautiful to see on the table, it is delicious as well. It is somewhat time and labor intensive, so if you need a quick dessert, this is not what you're looking for. The chocolate leaves with gold dust really make this one of the most stunning desserts ever. It took me two tries to get the leaves right. The first time, I layered the chocolate too thin and they broke when I tried to peel off the leaves. Once I made them thicker, they were easy to handle. Camelia leaves work really well. I bought the gold dust from King Aruthur's Baker's Catalog. If you like tiramisou, you will love this. Now that I have made this once, the next time will be much easier. TRY IT!!

About "lemon " leaves; I believe the florist sells SALAL leaves as "lemon leaves"- they always have them, But they are wide. I think rose leaves do a good job, and are shiny. ?? anyone

I have not yet tried this recipe but I would like the person who used rhododendron leaves to know that they are considered poisonous, and so should not be used as a base for this recipe.

You can find lemon leaves at almost any florist. The florist told me to wash them very well, using a dishcloth to wipe each leave with soapy water because the leaves you get from a florist are treate with some kind of pesticide. She also said to rinse them with either a lemon/water mixture or a vinegar/water mixture. I followed her instructions, and everything was fine.

I used Rhododendron leaves last year -they were in the back yard. No one got sick, so I assume the leaves aren't poisonous. Try looking structurally sturdy leaves. Chocolate is both easier to brush on and then remove when the leaves don't flop around.

anyone know of any other suitable types of leaves that could be used to make these?

I have been making these for years! They look beautiful with white chocolate arranged on top of a chocolate cake with little red hots in the middle. Looks like a poinsettia. They are easy to make and even a young child can be a part of making your everyday cake a special occasion!
