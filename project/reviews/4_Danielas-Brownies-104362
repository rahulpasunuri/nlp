My son is allergic to dairy and this recipe was perfect for him! I used Earth Balance margarine and Scharffen Berger unnsweetened chocolate. The batter looked a little too light brown to me so I added vegan chocolate chips. They came out perfect! Yes, a little on the cakey side but after settling, really more brownie like. Wonder if adding more chocolate or less flour will get it to that "brownie" stage. Will have to experiment...

I tend to like gooey brownines. These were more cake-like than I had anticipated BUT I had to freeze them for an upcoming party. When I took them out to thaw them (it only took about 20 minutes to a half hour) they were AMAZING! The had condensed a bit through the freezing process and thus the chocolate seemed more dense. They were devoured before they were even thawed. LOVED THEM!

I don't bake and already, I've made these twice. They were so easy and delicious. I used unsalted butter instead of margarine and melted it with 2oz of unsweetened chocolate over double boiler. I also added about 1 tablespoon of milk chocolate chips prior to baking and got raves both time when I made it for company. Definitely a keeper!

This is good! I subed the margarine with unsalted butter (one stick), and melted it with the chocolate chips (in the same dish in the microwave)first, added that to the sugar-eggs mix, and no vanilla. And yes, one more, sprikled with choc chips before baking. I learned my lesson; keep it simple with brownies. Everyone gobbled them.

Excellent starter/training recipe. Excellent and almost foolproof too!
