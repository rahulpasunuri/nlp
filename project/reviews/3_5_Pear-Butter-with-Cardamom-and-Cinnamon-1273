For those who are interested in making this for gifts - This recipe yielded quite a bit more than the 3 1/2 cups listed hear. After cooking it down for significantly longer than the recipe called for, I got almost double that. I also found this a little too sicky sweet for my tastes. I wish I had cooked the pears down to the right consistency, then added the sugar to taste. Overall, I think this is great!

I make this pear butter every year when I find myself with a surplus of pears in the fridge. I don't always use the wine and have substituted apple cider with good effect.

OK, not great using Asian pears. Needed to drain wine/lemon liquid to the side before pureeing to keep consistency as it didn't thicken well otherwise. Didn't really like the flavor, choose another way to preserve pears

I made this last fall and I'm about to make it again. It turned out lovely and people just raved about it. I think the cardamom made it unique and different to them, and no doubt the wine brought out flavors.

This was the first time I've made pear butter and was very pleased with how it turned out. The flavor was wonderful and it was very simple. I would recommend anyone who likes pears to try this recipe.
