I served this as a light finish to a ladies lunch and it got raves. Don't be discouraged if you taste the hot coffee mixture as it is really sweet and the vanilla is overpowering. Once chilled and set, however, the flavor is perfect. I didn't have enough heavy cream on hand to whip so I topped it with sweetened ricotta instead and it was great.

I love this recipe maybe, it is just because i love coffee. But i throw a litte Triple sec in there to pump up the flavor.

This a great dessert! - The additon of the curry to the whipped cream is brilliant - it adds an interesting complexity to the flavour of the cream. I'm going to experiment with how this works with other desserts and thinking it might be wonderful over poached pears. I did add a small amount of vanilla to the coffee and it worked very well -

Definately make sure you LOVE the coffee you use for this recipe. I used to own an espresso bar in the US and know the importance of freshly roasted and ground beans. I just ran out of my usual blend from Seattle, and had to use what was available here... Anyhow, the brewing method makes a very strong, somewhat concentrated coffee, so the resulting jelly actually seems stronger. The recipe has a lot of potential, just make sure you like your beans. This would be fun to try with real espresso and a bit of kahula or baileys..

To A Cook, below: Are you a therapist, or just overanalytical? This recipe was good, but not outstanding.

Oregon, I hope your review wasn't serious!! Maybe the coffee flavor was too strong for your liking, but gelatin really is never 'rich', and if this is too much effort, I feel badly for you! There is time involved, true (it has to chill), but this is a pretty simple recipe. Try giving yourself time to spend in the kitchen without interruption, and enjoy the prep work! Sometimes that's the best part about cooking. Good luck to you.

Oh the ever-popular coffee gello in Japan! Yumm! I prefer a touch of brandy to the cream topping to orange-flavor. Use good, strong coffee and keep it simple. In Japan, people serve the gello with simple unsweetened light cream poured on top, and sometimes with a few toasted slices of almonds.

I was dubious at first, but this turned out really good. The coffee lover in my family loved it. I used orange extract instead of curry in the whipped topping.

Wow! Live and learn. I have to say that the orange whipped cream sounds ever so much better than curry. Now I'll HAVE to give it a try...

To rich and takes to long to make.

Maybe it's regional to New England, but I grew up with homemade coffee jello (a packaged version was & is available in supermarkets as well). It used to be a standard menu item in restaurants around here, too. Now I think it is only found reliably at Durgin Park or The Union Oyster House. It's always been a great way to use left-over coffee after a big party. This recipe is very tasty. I liked the whipped cream, but personally prefer orange flavored topping with coffee jello, so added a little Grand Marnier the second time around instead of curry powder.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but I wanted to assure you who seem hesitant- one of the yummiest desserts we had in Japan was coffee jello. They make it not-so-sweet, very strong coffee flavor, served with whipped cream and even mandarin orange slices and cherries. It made a low fat treat- I used to choose it everytime we went to the revolver-belt sushi shop Urashima. Yum.

As someone who loves Jello in all it's many forms and has been a die-hard coffee drinker for the last 30 or so years, this is for me a fabulous combination. I'm just surprised I didn't come up with it myself!

I'm afraid of it, too.
