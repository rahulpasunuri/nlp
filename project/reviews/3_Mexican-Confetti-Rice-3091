Turned out great even though I didn't have all ingredients. Used one packet of Goya culantro/achiote plus 3 cups water in place of chicken broth. Used a can of diced tomatoes in place of sauce. No peas or carrots for us but did add the corn. Turned out pretty well!

I wanted to spice this up a bit so I used 1/3 cup of enchilada sauce instead of the tomato sauce. It added the right amount of spiciness to suit my family's taste. If you want to add some more heat add some green chiles or a diced jalapeno with the other vegetables.

Generally rice in a Mexican-style meal is not meant to be spicy. It's meant to be a cooling, fairly bland side dish that's good at soaking up sauces and that contrasts with spicier dishes on the plate. As such, this works quite well. The colors are pretty, the preparation is simple. If it's summer, use fresh corn sliced from the cob. Definitely gives it a lift.

It was ok at best. Not enough flavor.

Oh, this is good! I added pepitas (pumpkin seeds) but that is the only adjustment I made - just because I had them on hand and it seemed like a good idea. Served with mole chicken. Will become a regular in my house for sure.

My family really liked this recipe. I substituted brown rice and adjusted the liquids and cooking time accordingly. I also used taco sauce instead of the tomato sauce. Very tasty and a nice side with fish tacos or fajitas.

The previous reviewers are right, this dish is OK and that's about it. The enchilada sauce is a must, as is substituting various peppers for the suggested veggies. Not a bad side with a spicy dish or for those people that don't like too much spice.

Add roasted red and bell peppers for a nice touch. Use green, red, yellow and orange peppers to add more color.

First of all, I want to say that I do not consider myself a cook AT ALL, so the fact that I could make the dish and not ruin it automatically gives it Two Thumbs Up from me. I took a tip from another reviewer and used enchilada sauce rather than tomato sauce. I also deleted the onion and the carrots, and used a red bellpepper instead. The result was a flavorful, colorful side dish that was easy to make and quite popular with my guests. Thanks, Epicurious.com!!!

I substituted red enchilada sauce for the tomato sauce, since one reviewer said that this dish seemed bland. This gave it a nice little kick. I think it came out great. It reminds me of the rice at El Torito Restaurant. P.S. I also used converted rice.

I made this dish as part of a "Fiesta" themed buffet dinner. I thought the rice needed a little something and added Mexican oregano and it did add that little something that was missing. The rice was alright, but I would probably try another recipe next time I make it.

We added 1/4 teaspoon of chipotle chili powder to the recipe to give it some zest. It was very good with chicken in avocado sauce.

We found this dish to be very, very bland. Perhaps some chilis and cumin would give it some flavor.

This was a great accompaniment to Fiesta Red Snapper. I also left out the carrot. Served chopped tomatoes and cilantro on the side...also, sour cream and olives. Guests devoured everything!

this recipe was very good. It went perfect with my spicy chicken and mole enchiladas. The only thing I did differently, was I added extra tomato sauce, and omitted the carrots. Also, at the very end, after it was all cooked and ready to serve, I added about 1/4 cup of chopped fresh cilantro. It made all the difference!

Fast and easy. Will make again for certain. Great for busy weeknights and kid friendly too. Not necessarily a dish I'd serve guests but good family fare.

This is a great Mexican rice recipe that is very easy to make. I made this with chicken enchiladas and black beans.

I didn't put regular vegies in - I roasted some pasilla and anaheim peppers, chopped them up, and put them in. This was very bland I thought, but that was good as I made very spicy chicken mole enchiladas as the main. For that kind of dish, this pretty looking but mild rice is good. I think more tomato sauce would be good though.

This rice was great and easy! I served it with Oven Baked Chipolte Chilli Chicken and refried beans. A perfect mexican rice side dish!

I did not add the corn or the peas. My husband said it was the best rice he has ever had.

I've made this recipe several times. It's nothing extraordinary; it's just a nice, simple, colorful rice recipe that complements the main dish. I have a toddler, and this is a good dish to feed him, as it isn't spicy and is healthy. This will be an old standby in our house, for those nights we need a starch but don't know what to have.

While this was an incredibly colorful recipe...great presentation, it was much too sticky. Perhaps cutting down on the amount of chicken broth (I used organic chicken broth) would make the difference.

the best part about this recipe is that it is fool-proof. It cooks up to perfection every time. If you think it might be too bland then forget the peas and corn and try using a can of diced green chiles and/or one medium sized minced jalapeno pepper with seeds removed and toss in a chopped red or yellow bell pepper instead. This recipe will let you get as creative as you want. Try adding a cup of skinned and shredded chicken and heat it through the mixture for a meal in itself.

I was really excited to make this recipe based on previous reviews, but I must say I was VERY disappointed. I found this dish bland and tasteless, and I will not make it again.

This was delicious. My guests loved it and I'll definitely make it again.

Very nice and mild to counterbalance the 'heat' of spicier dishes. I added the corn near the end of cooking and the peas at the last minute lest they overcooked.

I have made this recipe several times now. I have even made it for large groups of people and everyone loves it. At least two people have asked me for the recipe. I have added it to my permanent recipe file.

Try substituiting the vegatables with Ro-Tel chopped tomatoes and chillies. Great addition to a mexican meal
