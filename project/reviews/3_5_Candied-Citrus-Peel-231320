Simple and tasty. A surprise for the guests. There won't be any left.

A Greek friend taught me to make great candied roses with this recipe. Cut the strips of peel four inches long. Coil the candied strip while still warm, pinch the bottom to form a rose shape, secure with a toothpick, then chill. Dip in the chilled syrup, remove the toothpick carefully and garnish any dessert plate. My Greek friends eat it as a confection. It's also a terrific garnish complimenting any savory roast meat such as lamb, duck, and venison.
