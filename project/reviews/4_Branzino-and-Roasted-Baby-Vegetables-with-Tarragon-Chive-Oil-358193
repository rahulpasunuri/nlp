Made this for our Friday night dinner and it is great. I took the reviewers advice and used garlic oil for the olive oil and squeezed a lemon over each fillet before serving. The fish was in the oven for about 6 minutes total.

I added 2 Tbl of fresh lemon juice. Loved this - so easy!

This was good - but I too agree some lemon would have kicked it up to great.

For a citrus freak like myself, I had to restrain myself from using lemon on this dish. But I was pleasantly surprised at the lovely flavors that came through. Still, I think I'll try it with lemon and chili oil as someone suggested below.

This was lovely- so fresh and tasty. I served it with whole wheat couscous which made a nice base for the veggies and herb oil. I'd make it again.

Really great preparation for the fish. I used Basa Fillets since I had some in the freezer. The tarragon-chive oil needed a punch so I added lemon juice and Chili Oil. So good!

The branzino was excellent. It was cooked perfectly and was tender and light. I marinated it in lemon juice for a couple of hours first. I did think, as did my sister in law, that it could have used some acidity. Perhaps a squeeze of lemon juice in the oil or some zest? It was a wonderful, unexpected passover entree.
