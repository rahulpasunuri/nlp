Wow! This is really amazing for a lower fat chocolate sauce. I would highly recommend it!

There are plenty of things where you can skimp on calories, but splenda? No real chocolate...gross.

A very good recipie! The chocolate was light tasting and very good. Just make sure to heat the chocolate slowly because it has a tendency to burn when you are warming it.

Great sauce, and useful for lots of things. If you use a really high quality cocoa powder, it will thicken up almost to the consistency of smooth fudge, perfect for dipping fruit.

very rich chocolate flavor, but consistency seemed thin so I melted ten marshmallows into it. mmm...

This is good low-fat fondue. I used it as a group dessert for health-nut friends who loved it. Really good cocoa powered is a must. I made it twice. The first time I made it exactly to recipe which was good. The second time I sifted the dry ingredients together which smoothed it out considerably and added Grand Marnier and orange zest. I also increased the amount of condensed milk because it thickened up very quickly in the fondue pot. Rave reviews from those who usually deny themselves dessert.
