This is easy, and I actually really like it. I admit it isn't "very interesting," but it's a decent weeknight meal and a great use for leftover pork (or chicken).

This is easy, true, but it's just not very interesting over all. There are other easy things that are more fun, like the black bean burritos on this site.

EASY EASY EASY!!!! And versatile, you could do anything with this. It's not pizza, though, it's a quesadilla. The first time I followed the recipe and it was great, the 2nd time (for a party) I used a 1/2 can of refried beans with chiles instead of the bean dip, and the smaller (6") tortillas to make smaller appetizers. They DISAPPEARED completely in 10 minutes!

My husband and I loved this pizza! I couldn't find the 9 oz can of Bean Dip with seasonings and cheese so I used leftovers from the Southwestern Black Bean Dip recipe (BA 5/96) which I had made for a party over the weekend. I omitted the cilantro as I had doubled the amount in the dip. Next time I will use the whole can of chilies. I also had a cooked and frozen pork tenderloin. This pizza was sooo easy.

Excellent!!!This recipe is TO DIE FOR! I like the spicy filling and love to add green peppers to the filling.

Instead of pork, I used leftover ground turkey taco filling. Also, to the bean mixture I added spicy salsa and corn. I toasted the tortillas individually before stacking them. Finally for the turkey mixture, I incorporated the cilantro, chilli peppers and a dash of salsa before spreading it on there.
