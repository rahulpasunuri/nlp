I have been making biscotti for years and never made lemon....wow, they are so yummy! I did switch it up a bit: only 2-1/2 c. flour, 8 T. butter, but add an extra T. of lemon juice and grated lemon. I also used 1 c. ground almonds instead of the walnuts. Will add to my collection.

Good recipe, you can use salted butter if you rather not use unsalted butter and use 3/4 tsp of salt instead. I used lime zest...so I guess you can call mine Lime Biscotti..because I left out the walnuts..very good....try it.

Substituted orang zest and juice or lemon. I also added orange extract 1/2-1tsp. I cut the quantity of walnuts since 3c. seemed like too much. First bake was only about 25 minutes;.can't imagine 50 minutes -- seems way too long. Second bake was 20 mins. These sliced beautifully. Tips: be sure to make the logs small as noted in instructions because they really grow! I used turbinato sugar for top. I've made a lot of biscotti and this recipe is ine of my favorites.

I used about a tablespoon poppy seeds instead of walnuts. Tasty! Make sure to have extra flour for dusting when you're shaping the logs because it's pretty sticky.

These are great! Following another reviewer's suggestion, I used 1/2 the walnuts, an extra egg, and reduced the baking time. I also used a lemon glaze. They were gone! I made them again and froze some -- still great.

On the advice of other cooks, I decreased the amount of chopped walnuts to about 1.5 cups and used a blend of toasted walnuts and pecans. The result was delicious! I will use this as a base recipe for biscotti in the future.

I am not a baker and usually mess up a cookie recipe. However, I have been making this one for years and family and friends love love love them. This year I messed up and added 3 eggs to the first two batches I made. The third batch I realized my mistake and added only the two. I found both tasted the same however, the 3 egg version had no crumbs when slicing. The 2 egg batch did. So I will now make with 3 eggs. Also make sure your nuts are really chopped and like others said, you don't need three cups. I take logs out after 40 -45 minutes.

Excellent recipe. Light and crisp. Ill definitely make again. In fact, I'm making another batch tomorrow - after I get more lemons (see below). Here are my variations: Lemon: I only had one lemon on hand, which made 1T of finely chopped fresh peel and 3+T of lemon juice. I used all of that and added 1T of dried lemon peel. The dried peel contains sulfates so I avoid whenever possible but I'd already started mixing, so I thought I'd try it out this time around. Taste is fine  but Ill still use fresh whenever possible. Nuts: I keep a supply of finely chopped walnuts and pecans (combined) on hand so  after reading other reviews  I used just one cup of that instead of three. Baking time: 50 minutes seemed like a very long baking time for round one, so I checked after 20, 25, and 30-minutes. My ovens are pretty reliable, but 30-minutes was plenty of time for this round. Same with round two  15 minutes instead of 20.

I made these exactly as the recipe says and they were easy and delicious. I thought the amount of nuts was perfect. I shared some with my neighbors and they agreed that this recipe was a keeper!

First made these over Christmas to give away and they were my daughters favourite out of four recipes. Very light texture for a biscotti and the raw sugar topping really makes them rock so don't skip this step.

I cut the recipe in half and only used one cup of walnuts and thought the biscotti came out great.

Good but way too much walnuts. One cup is plenty

Very good taste but too delicate a cookie and very difficult to cut this size and keep their shape. Needed more structure to make a great biscotti although, the lemon and walnut are a great combo.

I have made a lot of different biscotti recipes - and also their cousin, Mandelbrot - and I thought this recipe only fair. Too many nuts, and even with extra lemon zest, did not think they tasted great. Very hard to slice without crumbling. Perhaps the walnuts were not chopped fine enough? I used the Cuisinart,, and chopped them pretty fine. The egg glaze was a nice touch.

I used the zest of a whole lemon, I thought this biscotti was wonderful. Such nice flavor. Definitly a staple at the cafe where I serve it.

Great recipe--instead of using finely grated lemon zest, try using a vegetable peeler to peel the lemon (avoid as much pith as possible), line up the peels, and cut into short, thin strips (a chifonade, perhaps). Instead of giving consistant lemon flavor, it gives you wonderful bursts of zest that fit wonderfully in this biscotti.

Easy and tasty. Kids love 'em. Adults do too.

Not bad. This recipe calls for more butter than most other biscotti recipes I've encountered. The buttery taste goes nicely with the lemon.

This is the best biscotti I've ever tasted, including the cafe-bought kind. I made the recipe almost as directed: the only two changes I made were to the nuts and the raw sugar. I added poppy seeds instead of walnuts (about 1/4 or 1/8 cup) to have that wonderful lemon-poppy flavour. I also used a citron-flavoured sugar instead of raw sugar for the top. These are wonderfully crunchy, quick and easy to make. I'll be bringing these to many people over the holidays. I highly recommend them!

I would reduce the nuts by half only because with so many nuts, they don't hold together as well.

These are very good and have gotten raves from all who have tasted them. Everything about them is great - texture, flavor and ease of making. I thought these had robust lemon flavor - I used dried lemon peel that you purchase on the spice aisle at the market. I will use this basic recipe again changing the lemon peel for orange and adding some chocolate chips. I think the basic recipe is a keeper.

These were o.k. but not nearly as lemony as I had hoped. I did throw some thyme into 1/2 the batter which provided an interesting flavor. The Nanas Anise Biscotti from this site are the best!

Other than some major "cook's errors", this turned out very tasty and much nicer than "normal" biscotti. I used half macadamia nuts and half walnuts which was lovely ... the errors I made included trying to move the logs whilst still hot and dropping one! Then I burnt a batch of the biscotti when re-cooking!! My fault entirely ... don't cook when you are in a rush and distracted! The recipe had no faults though!!

These were excellent. A co-worker originally brought them in to the office, prompting me to buy the April 2004 issue of Bon Appetit just to get the recipe as it was not yet posted to epicurious.com. I made them for an office function and they were a hit! I didn't get 5 doz. from the recipe, but perhaps I could have cut them a little thinner. I did get more than 3 doz., but I didn't get an exact count. I'll definitely make these again and again.

Some of the best biscotti I've ever made, or eaten. The lemon flavor is wonderful. Use an organic lemon for the zest, because it is a lot of zest and the zest of non-organic lemons is pretty full of pesticides (I actually used a little more zest than called for).
