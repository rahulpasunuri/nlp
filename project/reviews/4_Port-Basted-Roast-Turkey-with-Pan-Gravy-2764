This is our absolute favorite recipe for basting the turkey & the gravy is the best ever. With the 3 mushroom dressing, this is our standard!

We have made this recipe for the last 5-6 Thanksgiving dinners and I cannot give it enough praise! The port is the secret ingredient. Amazing! And, we follow it to the tee...no need to mess with it.

Very good. Made it almost exactly as written and was loved by all...even my 4 year old. Used home chicken stock instead of broth -- worked well.

this has now been our standard for years-- with a brined free-range turkey & the 3-mushroom dressing, it just cannot be improved upon. gorgeous colour, too!

I'd lost it, from 3 years ago, and am very excited to have found it again. This had been the best turkey I had ever made!

If I roast a smaller bird --say 7-10 lbs., can I just cut the roasting times in this recipe in half?

I've made this recipe for the last four years and panicked when I couldn't find my old tattered version from the 1996 magazine! This has become our standard for Thanksgiving. Combine it with the Three-Mushroom Dressing and the Cranberry Sauce with Cherries, Marsala and Rosemary from the November 1999 Bon Apetit and you've got the most elegant Thanksgiving imaginable.

Fantastic! Having just got married, this was our 1st Turkey we ever made for Thanksgiving. It was a BIG hit. Everyone loved the gravy.

This dish is wonderful. I generally use just a turkey breast dressed for roasting from the butcher. It doesn't matter how much I make, 4 lbs, 7 lbs, or more - there is never anything left. I always serve it with mashed potates and steamed sugar snap peas. It really is the one of the best ways I have found to cook turkey.

Excellent dish - full of flavour. gravy outstanding.

The turkey was dry and relatively flavorless. The gravy on the other hand was very good. A little on the sweet side but tasty none the less.

The gravy from this is fantastic!! Used a smaller bird (10 lbs) and homemade turkey stock (giblets, etc. with fresh bouquet garni) instead of chicken stock. Didn't use a cheesecloth. Cooked under the skeptical eye of mom... who agreed the end result was delicious. Again, the gravy is fantastic and the bird has a very mellow color at the end of it all. Would use less butter/flour combo in the gravy base next time.

Made this with a turkey breast instead of a whole turkey and it was very moist and flavorful...the gravy is out of this world!!!

The gravy is incredible. It has become our family recipe. Time consuming, yet worth it.

Not the easiest recipe to make, but I have never tasted better gravy. Worth making, just for that. I am making it again this year

This has become a Thanksgiving tradition at our house -- the port gives a wonderful depth to turkey gravy (and beautiful color to the roast bird). And the flavor works with a number of different sorts of stuffings -- mushroom stuffing, the traditional midwestern bread stuffing, oyster stuffing -- so we can vary the meal each November without upsetting the traditionalists in the bunch!

Great Thanksgiving Turkey with Three-Mushroom Dressing stuffed in the bird, and Gravy Base. Good make ahead for parts of the recipes.
