these were quite good (with reviewer suggestions)--but I found them very time-consuming to prepare...also, a good thing I used a mix of peppers--by the time my anaheims were roasted, there was nothing left of them!

I added a couple of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (diced) to sauce, which added flavor and heat. I also used a variety of cheeses and made more sauce than the recipe called for. This was so delicious! I would definitely make it for guests.

Made with flank steak. Varied peppers for more heat and combined cheeses for more complex flavor. Could have used more sauce, and will make more in the future. Very tasty, though, and definitely will make again.

We didn't think there was enough sauce or taste in these burritos. It sounded good though.

Delicious! I couldn't find Anaheim Chiles so I roasted a Poblano and added more roasted reds to counter the heat. Soooo tasty that this will become a family favorite.

Very easy to put together. The flavor is really good. Will make again.

super good! baking is definitely necessary so that the cheese melts and the top gets crispy. guests loved it too and wanted recipe

The onion/peppers/cheese combo was Fabulous (I added jalapenos for some heat), but the meat was not outstanding. I eliminated the baking requirement (who wants to bake in the summer??) and just made tacos....heat the tortillas, add some meat and veggie combo and fold over, yum. Maybe the meat needs to be marinated longer? I'll keep looking on the site for a four fork fajita recipe....but I'm keeping the veggie recipe.

I've had this recipe for years (although originally it was named "Creamed Peppers," which I think is more descriptive). After blackening the peppers, they usually only need 10 minutes or so to steam, not the hours mentioned by a fellow Epicurean. When I've been pushed for time, I've even used a combination of ground beef and a mild chorizo, which isn't really heresy. It is no faster than using a skirt or flank steak, but I almost always have it on hand. And since I'm the microwave queen (husband works for a major appliance manufacturer), I sweat the onions and garlic in a 4-cup glass measuring cup, add the chiles and peppers, add cream, cheese, oregano, and S&P. Then heat on high, watching for boil-over, in 30 second increments until heated. I can even keep it warm in the microwave on lowest power while I continue preparing the rest of the dish. I heat the tortillas in the microwave (one at a time, about 15 seconds each) to make them pliable. If I had made the dish ahead of time, I always heat it in the microwave for a short time, 5 minutes at 50% power, just to take the chill off. At that point, you decide if you want to heat up your oven to 450 for like 10 minutes, only to have to heat the dish for 5-10 minutes, or if you just want to heat all the way to serving temperature in the microwave and be done with it. After all, the cheese doesn't brown. Sound like as much work as this recipe? Maybe, but it's the only way I know how to cook now.

This recipe combines two of my husband's favorite meal pieces: meat and cheese, so naturally it was a hit. I bought a fresh red pepper and roasted it along with the anaheim and poblano peppers in the broiler for 20 minutes (until the skin blackened). Then I enclosed them in tin foil until I was ready to work on the meal again. The skins peeled off nicely after leaving them for a few hours. Normally I've baked them and only let them sit for 30 minutes; this method worked better. My meat ended up marianating in the juices instead of being rubbed; it was moist and had great flavor. Easy and enjoyable.

Excellent and easy! I added some cheddar to the sauce too.

The picture does not look as though they've been baked in the oven. Is this step necessary?

I made this for some friends and got rave reviews. I then made it for my husband and he also enjoyed. It has a lot of flavor and is very easy to prepare. I will definitely make this a staple in my kitchen.

These were yummy and easy. Will add these to my weekday recipe file! I fire grilled the anaheim peppers on my gas stove and peeled them. They added a nice spicy touch. This was definitely restaurant quality Tex-Mex!
