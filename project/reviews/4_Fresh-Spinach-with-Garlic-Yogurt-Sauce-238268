Tasty and easy recipe to make. I also used a single thai chili instead of the chiles de arbol, which provided plenty of kick. For texture, I used some kale instead of just spinach. Also, I substituted diced, fresh tomatoes for the tomato paste. Very tasty, and very easy. It just takes a little longer to cook because of the tomatoes and the kale, but still very fast and easy. The cayenne butter is the perfect topping - a must have.

I also recently published a blog post and later found out that there is something similar on epicurious.com. If you want to read my version go to http://mytastyhandbook.com/tasty-food-and-drink/my-moms-baby-spinach-with-garlic-yogurt-sauce/

Followed the recipe and this came out delicious, with a subtle flavour. Probably the most time-consuming aspect is waiting for the rice to cook (in this case, on an uncovered skillet; perhaps it cooks differently covered or in a saucepan?) but it was well worth the effort. And the chillis (I sliced mine, two tiny chilli padis, finely) really add that extra kick!

Was bland and boring. Rice addition was weird.

This has become a standard in our house. I've also made it with bulghur instead of rice and fresh tomatoes instead of paste. I've also substituted the chiles with a red curry paste. It's great any of those ways, but the yogurt topping is essential.

WOW! Usually I love fresh spinach over cooked - but I also love Greek Yogurt so I thought I'd give this a try. I used some leftover rice to avoid cooking the spinach for so long. AMAZING recipe. Do not skip the Greek yogurt garlic sauce. That really makes the whole dish.

Wow! I just made this with spinach from my CSA box - amazing. I threw in some leftover basmati rice and tossed a lot of fresh garlic with the Greek yogurt and some sea salt in the mini-cuisinart. Phenomenal and easy.

Absolutley delicious. I used chipotles in sauce instead of chiles (I like it hot) and also substituted bulgar wheat for the white rice.

This is absolutely delicious! I used fresh spinach from the farmers' market and I drained lowfat yogurt, which is just as good as whole-milk. I cut the cayenne in half and there was still plenty of heat. May use a touch less next time.

I got mmms... and yummms... all though dinner! I served this dish with grilled salmon and cherry tomatoes, and the combination worked perfectly. I'll make it next time I have guests for dinner.

This was absolutely delicious - got rave reviews at a Mediterranean-esque dinner party. I strained plain yogurt and roasted the garlic before adding it to the thick yogurt. Fabulous.
