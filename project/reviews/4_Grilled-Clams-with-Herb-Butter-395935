I always grill my littlenecks as a result of this recipe. I don't necessarily make them with the butter -- I like them just plain. So good! The first time I made them, I scrubbed them but did nothing to remove the grit. Forgot all about that. Now I soak them in cold water with a teaspoon or so of cornmeal so that they spit out their grit. Did I mention that these are so good?

This is a delicious way to enjoy clams. After reading the previous review, I simply threw the clams into a preheated broiler pan on the grill so they retained their juices, and melted the butter to mix in afterward. Perfect and easy.

Not bad, but we met several problems. First, the lemon juice simply did not blend with the herb butter. We ended up zesting the lemon and mixing that in, instead. Second, even room-temperature herb butter drastically cooled our clams so that they were cold by the time we ate them. This nearly ruined them. Third, the clams lost a lot of their liquid on the grill, so were lacking much claminess. In the future, we'll grill the clams in an aluminum tray (like in another epicurious recipe), then melt the butter and toss it with the clams in a pan.

So simple and delicious! We loved it so much we've made it three times this past week. We'll be grilling a lot of clams this summer!
