I made these carrots for small Thanksgiving dinner. The recipe yields enough carrots for 4-6 people. The glaze was a little thin but adhered ok to the carrots. The flavors were perfect and not overpowering. The dish was beautiful with the contrast of the carrots and fresh tarragon leaves.

There wasn't anything wrong with this, but it didn't really end up making what I'd call a glaze. The sherry was a nice flavor, but the whole mixture was pretty liquidy.

Made dish with carrots and parsnips, but otherwise as the recipe described. While adding the cloves gave the glaze a rich color, found the flavor of the cloves overpowering the sweet flavor of the carrots, parsnips, and Clementine. None of the guests at the meal ate the dish and will not make again.

I agree with reviewer below that it only feeds 4-6. For a Thanksgiving crowd of 20 - I made 8 bunches of carrots and adjusted the recipe accordingly. I did not need to cook the carrots as long as the recipe indicated. I also found that the glaze was very insufficient so I ended up making 8 times the recipe for the glaze. I also felt the glaze was too thin and not adhering to the carrots - so I stirred in 1/4 cup butter at end.

A good, flavorful, straightforward glazed carrot recipe. I didn't have fresh tarragon, so I subbed a scant tablespoon dry when I added the orange juice, and I opted for fresh ground cloves and sweet vermouth. Also, I also sectioned the other half of the orange and tossed them with the carrots and glaze at the end, and if I were to do it again, I'd buy a second orange to section and add to the mix. One warning: there's no way in hell this'd feed ten people. Maybe four with a salad and hearty entree.
