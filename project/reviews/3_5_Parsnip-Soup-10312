I used chicken stock instead of broth, skipped the celery and nutmeg and added a couple apples, lemon and salt. Turned out great!

Just made this recipe last night and it is DEFINITELY on my list of chill-busting dishes for winter! The ginger gave it such a wonderful depth.

Perhaps it was the quality of the produce, but we loved this subtle, earthy soup. Next time I have parsnips laying around this will be a go-to.

I made this recipe as written except I used more garlic. We didn't like it. The flavor almost seemed overpowering, and I had to water it down because it was so thick. I have had parsnip soup in the past that I liked, so I will look for another recipe.

Very easy soup to make- perfect for a cool evening! I added about 1/2c more chicken broth so I didn't need to add any water at the end. I was also very generous with the nutmug and thyme. When I served the soup I added a few drops of olive oil and some pine nuts for a little added flare.

I made this soup tonight, sans onion, nutmeg and ginger. I used an extra carrot and I added a little extra garlic and thyme, per other user reviews. Threw in a dash of cayenne pepper as a flavor enhancer. Wow, turned out so well. I used an immersion blender when ingredients were all boiled and soft. Velvety texture and quite filling. Easy to replicate and cooks fast!

Soup was good but not great. Didn't have enough flavor to be exciting. Maybe more ginger or garlic would help. Came out way too thick and I had to add quite a bit more liquid to get the right consistency.

texture was nice, but i thought the flavor nothing special. a little too "rooty" tasting for me. maybe i just don't like parsnips. i wouldn't make it again.

My husband's first comment was, "Why can't people sell soup that tastes this good?" So easy to make and very delicious. Search no further for other recipes. Stop here and make this one tonight!

Excellent recipe. I have made this numorous times. Do not leave the carrot out as someone else suggested. I tried that once and it lacked the depth of flavor of the original recipe. I'm not one to exactly follow recipes, but this one is best as is. Very important to use the correct amount of carrot to parsnip. Can't tell any difference between using butter or olive oil.

I loved this soup although I made some changes based on what I had on hand. I used white carrots which seem a little sweeter. left out the celery and exchanged vegetable broth for chicken, added tarragon and a little maple syrup and grated fresh parmesan and homemade croutons on the top. This was lovely on a cold day.

Maybe it was the carrots I used, but I thought they overpowered the parsnip. I could not really taste the parsnip very much. Also, it was too sweet. Next time I would use no carrot, or another recipe for parsnip soup, rather.

I added one small yukon gold potatoe instead of carrot, doubled the garlic. The taste of thyme was non-existant and next time I'll double. You could substitue whatever veggies on hand. Parsnips are soooo sweet! It is quick and easy for week- night supper. Would make again.

I use 2 teaspoons of olive oil to do the veggies and it comes out wonderful - with less fat

I had never had parsnips before this and I was very pleased. I served the soup at a dinner party and it was a huge hit. I got the parsnips from the CSA farm delivery program I joined. It's been so wonderful getting a box of fresh organic produce from a local farm each week. It's not any more expensive than the store and the produce is incredible. If you love to cook, try it! Mine comes with a dozen eggs in addition to the fruits and veggies. And it has me trying all kinds of new foods. Try this recipe and a CSA.

This soup was delicious! I too used an immersion blender, and added a dash of salt, pepper, & red pepper flakes. Served it with sauteed mustard greens (right on top) and crusty baguette. Totally fantastic as a winter meal for two.

This soup had no flavor and was really disappointing. I actually made a double batch because of the other reviews and ended up throwing it all away! Would not recommend this at all!!!

This soup was very easy to prepare and came out delicious. After cooking the parsnips, I used a hand blender to puree it in the pan itself. I will certainly make it again, as I'm sure guests will be delighted by its flavor.

Made it last night for dinner - very tasty! I don't have a blender, so I took a potato masher to the veggies. I can hardly wait to get to the leftovers tonight, especially if the flavours meld the way I think they will.

This is an easy soup that starts a roast chicken dinner or turkey very nicely. Use an immersion blender to do the puree. Doubles easily and freezes well.

My husband and I truly enjoyed this recipe. It was easy and I will make this again soon.

This is a great recipe using winter vegetables. I added at least 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and it gave a very nice flavor to the soup. I used homemade chicken stock for the broth.

Very good...I used vegetable broth instead of chicken and used more garlic. It was extrememly easy to make and quick, too.
