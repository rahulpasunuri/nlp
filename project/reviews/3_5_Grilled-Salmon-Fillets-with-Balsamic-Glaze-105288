I, too, have used this glaze for grilled salmon many times. A true winner!

I've made this several times,and have started brushing the salmon with some chili oil instead of olive oil. The heat of the chili oil goes well with the sweetness of the balsamic glaze.

Rating: 4
fantastic recipe; i recommend using a meat thermometer on the salmon. we grilled the salmon for about 10 minutes, flipping only at the end to sear. i also tossed the salmon fillets in olive oil and minced garlic before putting onto the grill. the reduction was fairly tangy, and requires no modifications. i served this with grilled asparagus tossed in OO, lime juice, and minced garlic. tasty!!

I made this for a dinner party and thought that it was very good and will make it again. I will increase the amount of glaze the next time that I prepare this dish but that would be the only change. I didn't experience any problems in making the glaze. I brought the glaze to a boil and then lowered the heat to medium low and simmered for the 17 minutes the recipe called for. I made the glaze the day before the dinner party and rewarmed the next day. It was delicious: sweet and tangy.

This was excellent and easy. The glaze would also go very well with chicken.

So simple, yet so delicious! I make this just about every week for my wife and I and serve it with roasted vegetables. Yes, it does take more than 30 minutes to make, but forget Rachael Ray for a second. Try this, even if you do not like salmon. You will not be disappointed. Serve preferably with a chilled white wine (e.g., Chardonnay or Pinot Grigio).

I made this tonight with just 1 T. brown sugar, simmered it for about 20 minutes, and it's really good. I'd make it again - it would be a good dressing on a salad, too. It's very easy.

Everyone I've ever made this for loves it! It does take longer to reduce the sauce, but it's worth it. I now try to make it in advance and then just heat it up. Terrific!

A little too sweet for my liking, but something I can work with. I choose a wine with lime and apple flavor.

I always had a hard time with glazes until I went to a class at a culinary college. The chef taught me to put equal parts balsamic and brown sugar and heat only until the sugar incorporates. Then let it cool in an ice bath or in the fridge. It is phenomenal and no living over the stove.

I got this recipe from my "Best of Bon Appetit" book. After one bite, I promptly wrote "THIS RECIPE SUCKS" over it so I don't accidentally make it ever again. The glaze was bitter and disgusting (despite wasting 1/2 cup of good balsalmic vinegar), and it hardened to a candy like shell as soon as started to cool. I actually shot a piece into my wife's eye whie trying to pry it loose from my plate with a fork. Whatever you do, skip this one.

Okay but not great. Prefer the sauce for Mahi Mahi with Brown Sugar Soy Glaze, used on salmon. I have no luck with either getting the sauce to thicken, either at a fast boil or at a simmer.

Rating: 3
this was a great little recipe. i also made it with a big salad, some tomatoes, and thinly sliced red onion. just added some olive oil and a little of the glaze to make the salad dressing. a note about the glaze - as others have hinted at, it really thickens quite a bit as it cools. i kept it on a high simmer for about 15 minutes, then let it cool and thicken while i finished the fish. it turned out great!

Rating: 2
I made this, followed all instructions as written. It was just OK. I would not call it a true glaze, as it was quite runny. I was expecting a glaze that would truly "hold" onto the salmon, as I expected it to cut the rich flavor of the fish. But it didn't - just kind of ran off onto the platter, leaving a minimal amount on top of the filet. It wasn't bad - just wasn't fantastic as expected.

great recipe - don't overdo the balsamic reduction or it will be gooey

I actually baked this in the oven, put it on top of a fresh romaine salad with home made balsamic dressing (balsamic, olive oil, garlic, basil, salt and pepper... Blended in food processor) Then topped it off with home grown cherry tomatoes, and shaved parm. cheese. Absolutely fabulous! Great summer meal!

Well I'm into the third cleaning by boiling of my saucepan. There's NO WAY you can boil this for 17 minutes or even 10 and get anything other than a nasty carmalized mess. I may or may not try it again, but at more of a medium heat than med-high or for 7-8 minutes, not 17, thats just crazy talk!

Rating: 3
I love the way the balsamic glaze complemements fatty salmon especially. Had it recently with lightly wilted spinach with green garlic and it was very well received. Cook from Grand Rapids, keep trying, this sauce is simple, but it turns gooey very quickly. It also thickens as it cools - my trick is to take it off heat while it still looks thin and let it cool slightly, then heat it again just before pouring over the fish. A classic.

Delish! The twang of the marinade really comlplemented the fatty salmon. I used Wild Sockeye. I didn't have any brown sugar so I used maple syrup all on a bed sticky sushi rice. Even loved by my meat n' taters man! Next time I'll sautee some chard and drizzle the glaze over everything.

My family loved this....watch the sauce My first attempt was too runny and my next one almost caramelized...I caught it just in time and it was great. I served it with a strawberry/spinach salad and french bread and it was wonderful. Perfect summer dinner on the deck!

Rating: 1
Be careful reducing the sauce!!! I reduced it to the suggested 1/3 cup, and it became a caramelized goo that tasted like burnt wood that solidified on the salmon. Naturally, it didn't taste good in that state, but if I were to remake it, I would spend some money on good Balsamic vinegar and I'd reduce it much less.

I loved this recipe. On a lazy day, I even made the glaze in the microwave. Very simple, and lends itself to an excellent presentation.

1. I havee also made a similar glaz with blasamic vinegar, champagne vinegar and orange juice. Added a very small amount of sugar. Using less sugar gives the salmon a more pleasant tang.

My husband didn't care for this at all. I thought it was a nice change from the Salmon w/creamy horseradish sauce that we've prepared the last four times when cooking salmon. (Definitely 4 forks). I was just looking for something different. According to the spouse, this isn't it. Different strokes for different folks. If you like sweet or teryaki-like flavors, you'll probably enjoy this recipe.

This turned out well, but my fiance prefers some of my other salmon recipes. I would make this again, but only if I didn't have time to marinade. For anyone having trouble with the timing on the glaze, I would suggest that "boil" in the recipe shouldn't be taken too literally...once it comes to a boil, simmer it on a lower heat until it's just the consistency you want.

Rating: 4
Anytime you boil down something with sugar, you REALLY have to watch it. It took me only 10 minutes to boil down the sauce. Any longer and yes, it would have been a blob. But what a dieter's delight! A great tasting sauce, and it looks great drizzled in a nice pattern over the fish. Served with a wild rice pilaf and a salad of baby greens, fresh steamed asparagus, tomatoes and sweet onions with a mild balsamic vinegrette...HMMMM! I've done this twice and the first time I served with nicely steamed broccoli and rice. Green beans would be excellent also. A chardonnay or fume blanc works, but so does a nice Merlot. Sterling has a Coastal variety for around $10 that's outstanding.

Rating: 1
I followed the recipe exactly but the glaze came out thick and sticky. It plopped off of the spoon in globs that stuck to our teeth like taffy. The flavor neither added nor detracted from the fish. Cooking with the skin on did protect the flesh and the salmon came out wonderfully moist.

I made chilean seabass rather than salmon with the balsamic glaze. Absolutely wonderful. It is better than top restaurant quality. Any white fish grilled or broiled would be good with this glaze. You can feel comfortable serving this to your most discerning guests. They will rave!

We made this last night, and as promised it was delicious and very simple to prepare. The fish looks really beautiful with the mahogany-colored glaze. We added a bit of fresh-snipped dill after the glaze, and paired the fish with a wild rice pilaf and a brocolli-cauliflower medley sauteed in a garlic-lemon butter and fresh herbs (basil, thyme, and oregano) from the garden. A perfect "First Night of Spring" meal!

I love seafood, but hate the smell and taste of salmon. However, my husband is a huge fan of salmon, so I try and make it for him once a week or so. I tried this recipe and it came out ok, except the sauce came out a little too thick. I'd watch it very closely to make sure the sauce doesn't develop a sort of caramalization type consistency where it hardens after cooled. Other than that, with slight variations, I'd definitely make it for him again. As long as I don't have to eat it ;)

This was nothing special, I'll never make it again. My 7-yr old ate it, but my husband was less than enthusiastic, he even thought it tasted strange. I marinated it in some of the glaze for about 15 minutes and then put on the grill, spraying with Pam first. I think we weren't crazy about it because we've been spoiled with this site's Glazed Grilled Salmon which is 10x better!

Rating: 3
This is a very nice and different way to do salmon. Served it to eight people, including a PICKY eight-year-old, and all loved it. We ended up baking it after brushing the salmon with the glaze and letting it marinate for about 15 min, then brushing it again during cooking and just before serving. Would have grilled it if we could have found the fish basket, but unwilling to tempt fate while turning this much salmon. Baking works just fine, tho.

I made this once and it was to die for! Absolutely melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I served it over mashed potatoes with a hint of horseradish. But then I made it a second time and didn't enjoy it as much. I believe it was because of the freshness level of the salmon. I agree with getting the smell out of the house. Took days the second time which I believe also indicates the salmon wasn't as fresh.

Rating: 3
This was delicious! Very light but flavorful. I really think the difference in taste has to do with the balsamic vinegar you choose. I used Modenaceti (of Modena)..yum! But...I would cook this outside. It took days to get the fish smell out of the house!!

Served to guests and got excellent comments. The salmon was terrific and the sauce was just an adjunct, so it didn't add a terrific amount to the meal. My spouse liked the overall effect though.

Salad was the green bean and grape tomato salad w Kalamata vinaigrette which turned out to be a bummer, the vinaigrette that is.

i do agree with one of the other raters that the glaze could be too tart...I think this is a problem if you you use lesser quality balsamic, which I did so I compensated with some honey to balance the acidity...if you use better quality balsamic i don' think this would be as much of an issue....however it was yummy
