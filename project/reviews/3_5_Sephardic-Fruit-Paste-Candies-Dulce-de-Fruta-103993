I looked all over the internet for a pectin-free pate de fruit recipe, and here it was hiding under a different name. I made the apricot version and it was really good. It did take much longer to cook than the recipe said. At least 90 minutes. My candy thermometer did not work well in such a thick paste. So I borrowed a trick from jam making and put several small plates in the freezer. I tested the pate by pouring a small amount on a cold plate.

I wish I could have given this a zero-fork rating. 20-50 minutes isn't close to enough time to boil down the fruit. Try 3 hours of stirring, and they still won't hold a shape. A monumental waste of time. However, the apricot turned out to be a good hamentaschen filling.

This is a wonderful recipe. Indeed it is time consuming (it seems that it will never get any thicker) but well worth the effort. Our family has been making this kind of desserts (with different fruits) for many years. However, due to the time-consuming preparation we make it for special occasions only.

What time-consuming waste of effort. It took too long, required too much equipment, and came out all wrong. It tastes good, but it's a gooey mess. Forget it, choose something else.

This recipe sounds really good, but I was actually looking for the recipe for aplets & cotlets. Can anyone help me get one?

I have not yet tried this recipe. But I have made similar treats called "applets & cottlets" I like the sound of these better , the others used unflavored gelatin . I'm diabetic and can only sample them in a very small way, but love to cook for others a lot. I can't wait to try 'em!!!
