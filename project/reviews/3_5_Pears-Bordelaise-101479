Have you noticed that this recipe is from James Beard, friend of Julia Child, and it is from 1959?!? I have made poached pears before, but never thought to thicken the sauce with apple jelly. I found an 18 ounce jar at my grocery store. I sliced the pears from this recipe into small pieces and used them for pear and Gorgonzola tarts, so I decided not to use the juice after all. I later used the juice to flavor some homemade ice cream. If you do need the juice for your dish, just use as much of the jelly as you need to achieve the consistency you are looking for. The pears took a very long time (about on hour) even when they were cored and quartered, so I added more wine as needed to keep them covered.

Substituted the bordeaux for shiraz and apple jelly for honey. Also, I used more wine than they suggested--it seemed that only 1 cup evaporated away far too quickly, and especially so with 6 pears (i only did 2).
