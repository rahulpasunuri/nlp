Really good! I've used this recipe a few times...usually as an appetizer for an asian dinner.

great mini-recipe! I found this about 10 minutes ago, and now our little batch of beans is almost done. We added lots of fresh pepper to the batter, and didn't bother to make the dipping sauce due to a lack of soy sauce. Also, we only put about a 1/2 inch of oil into our old cast iron skillet because: a. honestly, that's as deep as our deep frying needs to be, and b. that's all the oil we had on hand. Call them low-fat french fries!

I've made this a few times and it's always a big hit. I used Dale's Pale Ale the last time and it was delicious.

yummy. Used mild pepper rings and zucc. spears that were partialy steamed. Great for kids or guests.

I used club soda instead of beer and it was delicious. I did a variety of vegetables, and everything except the mushrooms stayed crip.

I've used this recipe twice now, the first time exactly as printed, with great results. This past week I did a fondue with it, we battered shrimp, scallops, salmon, broccoli, par-boiled sweet potatoes, and zucchini. Everyone loved it.

Fabulous!! Very easy recipe! I could have made double the amount and I still would have had people asking for more! I used an old 16" cast iron fry pan so I could do more than 10 beans at a time and not have to do multiple batches. This is a keeper!

Brilliant and easy side dish. I've always loved tempura and this batter is wonderful. My family woofed it down and are still talking about it. Yummy! - PS. add a little soy sauce to the batter, makes it even better!

Great and I have made them many times. I substituted thin asparagus and it was even a better hit.

If you're a maki-sushi fan, try making these beans as a filling for your rolls! I had green-bean tempura rolls in a sushi bar and I was so glad to find this recipe so I can make them at home.

This was an easy recipe, but I found the kids only ate about 6 green beans each. I think they would have eaten more of them if I'd just steamed them. Good for adults though - interesting and different. I was easily able to reheat them in the microwave.

This is a terrrific recipe -- my four kids love it as do my husband and I. I make it often. It makes a nice change from the usual dinner time vegetables.

The 17 and 10 year-old kids loved this! Easy to make. The sesame seeds added a great slightly nutty flavor to the coating. The kids dipped the rest of their chicken and potatoes into the dipping sauce! I'll serve this as either an appetizer or veg. course.

These green beans are delicious. They can be served as an appetizer or as a side dish. If you're bored with traditional style green beans, try these out.
