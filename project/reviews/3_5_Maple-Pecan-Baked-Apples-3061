I've been looking for a good baked apple recipe for a while, and this one is solid. I substituted dates and a litle candied ginger for the raisins and coconut, and kept the pecans. I didn't have apple juice, so I spiked the butter with brandy and added a little water to keep them from drying out in the oven. Baked perfectly with the dates getting a nice crispiness. Split them open and served them for brakfast with a big dollop of low fat Greek yogurt drizzled with honey. Delish!

Delicious, despite some forced improvisation. I'd planned to substitute chopped dates for the raisins (dislike them), then discovered both dates and coconut were MIA! Ended up using more pecans, orange-flavored craisins and grated orange peel. Accidentally added 1/4 cup brown sugar. (I think the coconut flakes would have added nice texture.) Used only 5 medium apples, to fit into available 9x9 glass dish. The amount of liquid came halfway up the apples. After baking 30 min covered, and 5 minutes uncovered, the yummy apples were just shy of collapsing into applesauce.

I recommend having some vanilla ice cream on hand to go with these. They're delicious, but very rich. The ice cream takes the edge off the richness a little.

I made this a year ago and it was great.I would like to serve it again but the Apple Custard Sauce isn't listed. Does anybody have this?

We really liked these . . . however, I don't know about anyone else, but I didn't really understand the cutting of the apples . . . I think I did it correctly, but I wish epicurious would have had a photo of this one. At any rate, the apples looked really pretty and were delicious. Definitely a winter brunch staple.

A big hit. Try it with the delicious Maple Caramel Sauce from one of the other baked apple recipes. I did not have to cook the apples as long as the recipe said to. The filling was delicious and I would definitely make it again.

Macademias are a fab substitute for pecans.

We took a shortcut the second time making these, using individual ramekins and we sliced the apples thickly. We then topped the apples with homemade vanilla ice cream...try this one on a cold winter night!

Try baking them in muffin tins, they hold their shape better. We have a bed and breakfast, in the fall I do a several baked apples. Dried cranberries is a wonderful addition to this dish.
