This dish is phenomenal!! I added shallots pan fried in oil until crispy, and mushrooms sautéed in some of the dressing. I also added about 10 cilantro leaves to the dressing in the food processor. I would definitely recommend this!

Excellent. I don't give many four forks, but this dish deserves it. Doubled the sauce, used 2 T PB, extra garlic, chili paste, and added cilantro on top. Pretty presentation and delicious as well!

Good, but nothing revelatory. I'd cut back on the lime juice and add a little more chili paste next time. Also, I only used one cucumber since two seemed like it would have been an awful lot...

Delicious, but I agree it could have used more dressing, which I would have tossed with the rice noodles. I would also be careful to drain the noodles very well -- I treated them like spaghetti and they were watery.

yummy salad that can be "beefed up" or down with the addition of more veggies. Snow peas would be great. Also halved red grapes would add a crispness and a little zing. I topped with blackened cocktail peanuts (great flavor!), some extra pinenuts that were laying around, chow mein noodles. Also, I served over bow tie pasta since I had that. If you are serving the day after preparing, save some of the dressing to top dress immediately before serving. The whole vball team, except my daughter, loved it!

This recipe was fantastic! I first made it for my sister and her friend who is vegetarian. This is great if you add with chicken or on its own. It is better the next day cold for lunch. Double the sauce

This recipe was really delicious. The dressing is fantastic and my husband used it oto marinate grilled chicken later in the week. I didn't have any rice noodles, so I substituted chow mein noodles which added a nice crunch.

Very yummy -- a nice flavorful dish for a warm evening. My husband loved it too. But, I couldn't make this in only 35 mins. I needed an hour to chop everything, and make the dressing and noodles.

One of my family's absolute favourite dishes. My wife prefers it without the cucumber (I like either way, so it gets made without!). Only change that we make is that we increase the sauce by roughly 50%. Makes EXCELLENT left overs to be taken to work the next day :)

This was a terrific weeknight meal. I grilled the chicken breasts, and I made a bit more than 4 1/2 ounces of rice noodles.

Execellent light meal. I think I used the wrong kind of noodles,but it was good any way. This is a keeper

Great for leftovers, too!

My husband and I loved this!! I made it a warm salad by sautéing the onions and red peppers with more chopped ginger, moving to a plate and then in the same saucepan cooking shredded chicken in the blended peanut-mixture. Then returned onions and peppers to saucepan with grated carrots to blend into chicken/peanut stuff. Served over hot noodles and then added cold cucumbers. Also sprinkled with sesame seeds and chopped green onions. Looked as good as it tasted! My only complaint is that there wasn't enough noodles and it was just 2 of us. Next time will make with 6 ounces noodles.

Loved this. My 6 and 7 yr olds could't get enough!

I made this as written including the edamame. It was a good weeknight meal. I like the Chinese Chicken Salad recipe on this site better, however. On a second go, I'd use unsalted peanut butter and low sodium soy sauce. I found the dressing too salty and I like salt.I also had problems with my noodles sticking after they drained. I might give them a dash of oil or coat them in a little dressing next time. The serving size seemed right on to me. Enough for a dinner for two and lunch leftovers for two.

The sauce tasted great and the mix of food was just perfect. It was also really easy to make. I would be tempted to make more sauce and more noodles next time.

Rating: 4
Flavorful and refreshing! I didn't change anything, except to use some red cabbage I had in place of the napa. This is definitely going in the rotation. I think it would also be good with shrimp or tofu, or even ground pork or ground chicken.

One of the best dishes I've made in a long time. Instead of using purchased roasted chicken breast halves I bought three uncooked chicken breast halves with skin and bones and roasted them in the oven (425 degrees for 30-35 minutes). So much better than store-bought chicken! I thought the sauce was delicious and there was enough to go over one whole package of rice noodles (about 6 ozs.). Leftovers were even better the next day. I will definitely be making this again!

Great dish and light. Dressing is good. I didn't have cucumber but did have jicama which was great.

this was very good. I recommend adding a little oil to the noodles after they are cooked, so they are easier to work with. Also, did not have napa cabbage so I used half iceberg lettuce and half regular cabbage and it worked.

Simply delicious. I'm a beginning Thai cook and this was easy to make and very delicious. Leftovers on the second day were very tasty too. I was worried about the chili paste making it too hot and cut the amount in half. No need. Will go for the full strength next time, maybe even 1 1/2 tsp.

Fantastic thai chicken salad. Fresh, easy to make and the dressing certainly gives a good kick! Can't wait to make it again.

Followed the recipe and assembled a double recipe on a large platter for a potluck luncheon. My wife told me it went over very well although my addition of chop sticks did not play well with this group of therapists.

Rating: 4
Oh, and I used Broccoli slaw as well as shredded cabbage, and extra shredded carrots. I might try to slip in toothpick sized jicama next time, to prove to my husband that jicama is GOOD. Might add slivers of fresh jalapenos too.

I doubled the recipe, loosely, and we ate it over 3 days until it was GONE! We throw away a lot of leftovers, so this is unusual. SO good, so fresh, a welcome change to the routine. Easy to make, and I'll definitely use this for large groups, maybe substituting fried tofu for chicken to please our vegetarian friends.

The salad was amazing. The carrots really absorbed the dressing, so I will cut them slightly bigger next time. I also marinaded the chicken in extra dressing for an hour, very good!

...sorry forgot to add that this dish makes a lot. The two of us will have at least 2 more meals out of the leftovers. I would add a bit more chili paste but that's personal preference.

I was a bit surprised how good this was! And adaptable too! I used a broccoli mix from Trader Joe's instead of cabbage and carrots; chili lime burgers (also from TJ's) instead of the chicken, but otherwise pretty much stuck to the recipe. Really, really good!

Made if for 2 with one chicken breast and used green onion instead of red. For whatever reason my store was out of rice noodles so I used "green bean" vermicelli and it was fine. Would be great for summer time and when you don't want to dirty many dished.

The most perfect asian noodle salad I've ever eaten!

Yum, yum, yum! As a salad fan, this was a great variation from any version of a green salad. I seared skinless breasts with lime and black pepper and then thinly sliced them after cooking to lay on top of the salad. I added a bit more lime to the dressing than suggested.

This was really easy and tasty. I had all of the ingredients on hand (never happens for me). I chopped/pulsed the rotisserie chicken and veggies in the food processor and added cilantro. Very tasty and easy to do even with my two kids clamoring for attention at my feet.

Thought this was a yumy recipe. I used regular cabbage and rotisserie chicken. I wish I'd have put it together more like a salad though...noodles, toppings and dressing on top. The dressing was DIVINE and I will surely make it again.

Rating: 4
I thought this needed double the amount of peanut butter and half the amount of garlic. But it is very good and you can vary the vegetables according to what you like and have on hand. I added edamame and thought it was good even without chicken as a vegetarian dish. But we had grilled salmon basted with some of the sauce over the noodles and loved it.

Rating: 4
Quick, easy, light summer dinner. Loved the sauce - lots of flavor - even better the next day. I added more kick by doubling the chili paste. I did not have all of the vegetable ingredients on hand, but doubled the carrot and bell pepper and poached chicken breasts for a lower-fat option. I will definitely make again.

Amazing dressing! My family LOVED it!

This was so delicious, I licked the plate. We added some cilantro to the salad which was a nice fresh addition. We also poached the chicken instead of buying pre-cooked as a cost-, but not time-saving technique. All around yum!!

Made this with leftover thin sliced pork loin instead of chicken. Next time I'll reduce the lime juice to 1/4 cup and double the peanut butter. I thought as-is it was a little too tangy and runny. It was still very tasty and simple to throw together.

A keeper! Made it and then made it again right away. So light. I didn't care for the sauce so I used store-bought Thai peanut sauce in a bottle. I agree with the other reviewer about the quantity. My son ate the entire dish in 2 servings. Add a dash of oil to the noodles and you won't need to cut them.

I made this for a work pot luck lunch. EVERYBODY raved and wanted the recipe! I used the Morningstar Farms Chick'n in place of chicken breasts (and skipped on the maifun for the buffet--I'd definitely do it at home though!).

My husband and I loved this recipe. It's easy to make and we really enjoyed the flavor of the sauce and the crunch of the vegetables. We did cut back on the garlic b/c we wanted to taste the ginger and lime more, but it still had a lot of flavor. It was a nice change from the typical dinner fare. Now we're going to try using the sauce in other dishes.

Superb! There used to be a Thai food restaurant in town and they had the best Thai Beef Salad. I could never find a recipe to match the flavor. This was it!! I used shallots instead of onion and added cilantro as another reviewer suggested. Everything was good cold the next day except the noodles. I will make those fresh. I am a teacher and this was a wonderful lunch.

Use minced chicken for a more authentic taste. Pan fry in concentrated apple juice for a healthier option. And use shallots, not onions.

I've made this several times - delicious & very flavorful. I've decided that I prefer to substitute jasmine rice for the noodles... Sometimes I mix the whole kit & kaboodle together and use the filling to make a burrito or wrap. I'm not quite sure what the last reviewer found so objectionable... The prep is not bad - the dressing is completed in minutes, then it's just a question of dicing some chicken and the vegetables. Oh, I like to add some fresh cilantro too. It's no more work than any other salad, and quite tasty!

I have made this recipe numerous times and have always gotten rave reviews from the young ballplayers I have made this for. I use sliced chicken breast that I cook lightly and then chop into bite sized pieces.
