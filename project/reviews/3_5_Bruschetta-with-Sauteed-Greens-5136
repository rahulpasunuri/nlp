Made this with beet greens. Not worth the effort. The flavor really needed enhancement and it was too crisp with just 3 minutes of cooking. So, I added water to cook longer, salt, pinenuts, and parmesan cheese and finally it was somewhat good.

The recipe has an error- it should say 1/2 teaspoon olive oil, not 12 (as is written in the instructions)

Delicious. Skipped the extra olive oil drizzle, added diced tomato, basil and shredded Parmesan cheese. Perfect appetizer or side dish. Quick and easy too!

Made this with beet greens from my CSA share this week. Used regular salt and added about 2 TBLS feta cheese to mix (after sauteeing). Used far less olive oil per slice than recommended. Just a drizzle. Fabulous!

I had some fresh spinach I needed to use to use in an easy appetizer. I wasn't thrilled with this recipe on paper but on the serving platter this was a hit. I used sea salt instead of gros sel. I added some chopped tomato and a little more fresh garlic in the end! Great and easy!

I gave it three forks after I added fresh diced tomattoes, garlic, and fresh basil. Now it is DELICIOUS!
