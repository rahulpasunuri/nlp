This recipe was so awful, I just had to write a review. The texture was disgusting (gluey) and the taste was boring and bland. After my first few bites, I dumped the entire batch down the garbage disposal in disgust. I'm angry that I wasted my time and money on this loser. I prepared it exactly like the recipe dictated.

This was really quite yummy. I used fresh Niagara cherries instead of frozen. I also used 1/2 cup ramekins. I think next time I would cook it less, and grind the almonds more, because they were a little crunchy where I would have preferred a smoother texture.

I have made this recipe many times. I bake it for about 1 hour and 15 minutes in a 10x6 pyrex. I also add a shot of kirsch for flavor. My husband LOVES it.

I found this recipe to be easy and delicious, but a couple of my guests didn't like the texture. I think that this is going to be typical of any clafoutis recipe.
