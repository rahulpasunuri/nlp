Spring is the time for this recipe. Finding the fresh morels is critical. I made this with only 3 oz. of fresh morel and replaced the Brie with a similar cheese made with sheep's milk. Given the rarity of the morels I served it with a sparkling white, live a Cava. Fit for royalty.

Simple and delicious. Great for a weekend breakfast or brunch. It also makes a lovely summer luncheon with a simple green salad, good crusty French bread and a bottle of dry rose wine.

I wonder if cook from Chicago soaked the dried morels before using them in the recipe. Dried mushrooms soaked and plumped are as flavorful as fresh.

To be fair, I did make this with dried morels (all I could get). Maybe the fresh would have had a stronger flavor. With the brie, butter, eggs etc... it all just was sort of greasy tasting.
