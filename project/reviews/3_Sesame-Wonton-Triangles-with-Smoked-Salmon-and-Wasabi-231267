Very easy and tasty. I think the reviewers suggestion of a little bit of cream cheese would be nice. We like the kick of a good wasabi dip, so upped the amount of wasabi paste. No complaints! Lots of compliments.

These were quite good, though not excellent. The wonton triangles came out a bit rubbery and didn't have the snap and crunch I expected them to. I might just make this on a cracker or a pita chip in the future. Otherwise, the flavors were good, basic Japanese.

I have made this ap several times and it's wonderful. As other reviewers have said it's a great make ahead ap. If you have a finicky guest they probably won't like it...won't like the smoked salmon or the wasabi sauce. I always get rave reviews from guests whenever I make it!!

Once you have the wonton triangles made and the smoked salmon in hand you can shape this recipe any number of directions. I add just a little cream cheese to this and it really brings everything together. You can also easily adjust the amount of wasabi. The wonton triangles are a welcome change from crackers or crostini (that I like but use a lot of in appetizer prep).

this was good but I also agree it's a bit too finicky so I probably wouldn't make it again

A simple start ahead appetizer I have made for several events. I make the toast points the day before and seal them in a ziploc bag and they hold wonderfully. I also make the dressing and hold it overnight in the frig - giving everything time to shake hands and the flavor to mingle. During the event its a dish I can run and refurbish the plate when it runs empty quickly and it is always well recieved.

I made extra wonton triangles and my inlaws loved them just as. I wasn't too crazy about the vinegrette (not much of wasabi taste..or really anything).

Awesome! But I found that spring-roll wrappers were much better than wonton wrappers

Very easy and the sesame crisps are super versatile. Put a dollop of sour cream and some whitefish, salmon and other fresh water caviar on it for another snack (or real caviar if you are so endowed!). I used slightly less sesame oil in the egg white wash and that worked just fine.

This recipe is a keeper.The wonton chips and dressing can be made ahead of time,so easy assembly when guest arrived.Many raves.You do have to like wasabi.

Was OK as shown in the recipe. Tried to use dried chives in the wasabi drizzle but wasn't a fan. Made it again without the chives, but added mayo to tone it down for certain guests. I'm a wasabi fan but I liked it better that way too. Wontons came out a bit too thick and dry.

I don't know what happened to the other reviews who didn't like this appetizer. I have made it serval times and everyone loves it. I haven't changed anything. Just make sure you cook the wontons until browned (not slightly toasted) otherwise they will be underdone and chewy. Get the micro greans at Trader Joes. GREAT PARTY APPETIZER.

Guests were Very impressed! I thought easy, crackers & wasabi can be done ahead with last minute construction.

My guest came into the kitchen excited to taste what I was making. When he took a bite and didn't say anything, I knew the recipe was not a keeper. Everyone agreed they were alright to make once, but not again.
