the broth this makes is so great, you will want a lot of crusty bread to sop it up. i also think this could be great with chicken- or just with pasta and no fish, it is one of the best recipes for pretty much no work! it is a keeper!

Even without theaïoli or tapenade, this dish was wonderful. We used the oil over pasta three weeks later, and it was really flavorful. I'll make for company next time!

I'm kind of on the fence with this one - I can think of lots of ways to cut the prepping time down on tbis dish. A lot of it seemed 'razzle-dazzle' to me. But, the flavors were quite good, so with modifications I will certainly use her ingredients for a seafood stew again!

Wow, this was awesome. It was a good amount of work, and has lots of ingredients, but I thought it was well worth it. The major change I made was to add a good deal more water to make it into a more brothy soup. Oh, the broth was delicious and the combo of fennel, leeks and shallots, divine. I think you can get a great result without going to the extra trouble of making the slow braised tomatoes - I just used canned roasted diced tomatoes. I did make the aioli which was quick and delicious on crusty bread. I had never cooked with clams before, but courage! They were surprisingly easy to work with, and fun to watch open up.

Excellent. I already had roasted tomatoes in the fridge so that cut down on the prep time. Didn't use fennel (I find it overpowering in most dishes). The aioli and tapenade were nice but not really needed. Monkfish was superb. Will make many times.

I have made this twice now and the results were pretty amazing both times. It sounds intimidating because of the 5 hours preparation time, but most of that is cooking the tomatoes which are delicious and incredibly easy to make. Other than a lot of chopping, the recipe is not especially difficult to execute. I found both times that the clams don't open quite as quickly as the recipe indicates; just be patient and they will eventually open. The first time I made it my grocery store didn't have monkfish so I substituted halibut and it was equally good.

Yum...definitely worth all of the time it takes. The aioli and green olive tapenade lift this to the extraordinary, they're worth making.
