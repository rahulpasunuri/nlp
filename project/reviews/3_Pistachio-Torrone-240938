I would rather buy Torrone than ever making it again. Not worth the time and difficulty.

I made this last night & have to say, it's pretty tasty! It's just not my ultimate version of torrone. I followed the technique to the letter but did put in almonds & chopped candied orange peel instead of pistachios. I used the same ratio though, so added 2 1/4 cups of almonds & 1/4 cup of candied orange. I substituted vanilla too, since I added the orange peel and prefer it anyway. The flavor is very good and I had no problems with it setting. The worst problem for me is the color. It didn't turn white. I had to whip the mixture much longer than stated too, to cool it down. The texture is off too. It's a lot chewier than I wanted. I wanted a softer, more tender nougat. It came out well for my first time making it, just isn't a perfect recipe for me. I did have the wafer paper and am thankful, I can't even imagine how I'd get it out of the pan without it. There are videos available on Youtube that show Italian chefs making it, I found it very helpful to watch them before making it. There were some good tips for working with such a tricky mixture, such as adding the nuts warm, to help them mix together easier. Good luck everyone!

I noticed that most people who didn't have issues with runniness/oozing were from dryer climates and those who had more problems with the consistency and not setting were from humid areas. The humidity just might be tooooo much in some areas to successfully make or store this dessert. Might try during cold temperatures?

i didn't experience the problem with the candy not setting. i definitely beat the mixture for a full 20 minutes, as i have experienced other candies not setting if i've not followed the recipe precisely. i used almonds; my nonna always brought this italian nougat candy to our holiday dinners and i remember it with almonds. every time i take a bite of the candy, i'm reminded of her. i also did not use the edible wafer paper and had no issues. i sliced them, cut them into bite size pieces and individually wrapped them in parchment and they held up perfectly. no gooey-ness whatsoever.

I was a little nervous with the "oozing" reviews, but this turned out great. It took a long time for the sugar to get to 315 degrees. I didn't have a 5 quart pan, so I used a 3 quart pan. I wonder if anyone has tried different pans and if that would decrease the time needed to get to the right temp. The honey and sugar did get very dark, but when I tested it, it tasted fine, so I kept going. It lightened up beautifully when I beat it with the egg whites, but was never really bright white. I also beat it for full 20 minutes with the eggs, so maybe that helped it set. This was my first try at this candy, and everyone raved. I'm going to make it again in a different pan and will report back.

Don't know why this didn't show up before but oh well! Love this recipe. It is a bit messy and very time consuming, but the end result definitely makes it worth it!! Great flavor, color and texture. Will be making this again and again! Thanks!

This recipe is wonderful! Warning: this recipe requires a lot of concentration and time, but the end results are well worth the time! I don't have access to edible wafer so I opted for the cornstarch/non-stick spray and it worked like a charm! It is messy, so be prepared!! Great, great texture and flavor! Thank you so much for a great taste memory! Wish I could give it more forks!

This was a bit of work, but the cornstarch magically makes it workable. I really thought this was one of the best things I ever made! Just incredible. Well worth the work and it set up just fine for me.

I was a bit concerned when the honey sugar syrup looked so dark, but when it was whipped into the egg whites, it turned very white. The flavour was very nice (I omitted the orange flower as I don't like it) but I also had the same problem with it not setting. Just gooey and stuck together. I found a site that explained that professionals whip their egg white and sugar mixture over hot water and that's supposed to be the secret to getting it to set. I will try that next time.

I will not make this recipe again. They never truly set into a firmer state. They seemed somehow suspended in between a liquid and a solid state. I would appreciate any feedback to make them into a firmer finished product.

What the heck is wrong with this recipe? I followed the directions and it looked great in the pan - set beautifully - the next day I flipped it out and cut it - tasted great - wonderful texture- but then I put it on my cookie platter with all the other cookies and after about ten minutes it was a big pile of goo. Anyone have a better recipe?

This nougat is delicious. It has a lovely chewy texture. The color was exactly as in the picture. I roasted raw pistachios and the flavour came through remarkably well. Instead of the wafer paper, I used sheets of "host cuttings" which are easily available in this city. They are slightly thicker than the wafer paper pictured in Gourmet, but work out well nonetheless. Since I have a very old Kitchen Aid mixer, I had to stop beating the nougat before it had cooled completely (less than 10 minutes). My mixer was smoking. I cooled the bowl with a wet cloth to hasten the cooling. The whole thing is very sticky, but fun to play with. It is a challenge to cut and wrap properly but the result is well worth the trouble. I put some in my children's Christmas stockings and they all raved about it.

I didn't have a problem with the boiling; it was a little dark, but my torrone turned out white, as in the recipe. I substituted orange extract for the flower water and didn't notice any bad taste. I wrapped mine in wax paper, and a few of the pieces are oozing as they sit in a tupperware on my counter. Like others, I wouldn't give it away - especially not without the rice paper, as every time you touch it you leave finger prints. Yet, I feel compelled to eat it all after the hour I spent shelling pistachios.

There is something wrong with this recipe. I followed precisely, and had the same sticky, gooey product of others. It never set up, and slicing is a joke. Taste is elegant and subtle, but please review this recipe and find out what is wrong with it!

Zero forks from, me, too. The sugar- honey mixure did get very, very dark, and I thought I might have burned it, but other reviewers had the same outcome. The nougat came out tan, not the creamy white in the photo. It was a mess to cut, and after my husband tasted it, it made a face like the one my cat does when we give her medicine. After that, it went right in the garbage can. An expensive experiment, after procuring the wafer paper, the large quantity of nuts, orange flower water, etc.

First off I love the recipes in my monthly subscriptions of Bon Appetit and Gourmet. However, occasionaly, like home there is a bad one. This was gross. Like the previous reviewers the nougat was dark, smelled like it was burning and the orange blossom water was too prefumey. I found the wafer paper and that was also expensive. I would not make this again however would rather go to an Italian deli and buy it ready made. If I wasn't watching my Kitchen Aide stand mier might of bit the dust. I'm deleting this out out of my recipe file.

I think there are issues with the recipe itself. I followed the recipe exactly. I had the same thoughts as the others about the darkness of the syrup and same concerns about temperature, but my nougat turned out beautifully....UNTIL it was time to cut it. Then I had the same results as one of the other writers did. The torrone is sticky, and floppy and will not be something that I can give away as a gift. The taste is good, but the appearance and stickiness is a disaster, and an expensive one at that. Having subscribed to Gourmet for 25 years, I generally have no problems with their recipes. I also tried the Peppermint Patties, but I'll save the writeup on that disaster for that recipe page!

This is really a strange recipe. I began by following it to the letter, but when the honey-sugar mixture started to burn (and I was boiling it gently in a heavy cast iron pot over very low heat) at around 290 degrees, I had to stop cooking. I never did get to 310, if I had, it surely would have burned. Though it lightened up a lot when whipped with eggs, the color is still a light brown and the torrone definitely tastes a bit burnt, despite my best efforts to keep it from scorching. The overall flavor of this torrone is the weirdest part of all (weirder, even, than the goupy texture) - a combination of burnt sugar, orange flower (I would use much, much less of that in the future) and honey. Not altogether bad for a cake or for ice cream, but way too intense for candy. Plus, even though getting the soft nougat into a pan was relatively easy (way, way easier than drizzling molten sugar-honey down the side of my mixer bowl - what??) now that I've cut it, it's oozing and won't really hold a clean cut (plus it's near-impossible to cut cleanly). I don't know, I think I'll leave torrone making to the experts and buy mine next time! Usually Gourmet recipes turn out perfectly, but this one is either too advanced for me, or a dud.

I made this two days ago. At first I was concerned with the color of the honey. I thought it was too dark. It lightened up considerably while it was beating, but it never got to the pretty white stage. I think the orange blossom water gives it a slightly bitter flavor, so I would substitute vanilla or more almond extract next time. As for the stickiness, I used a bench scraper to get it off my counter. I think the texture is really nice, not hard, but still has a nice chew. I wrapped my slices in parchment and they have only settled a little bit. They are not oozing at all. I think this is a good recipe to play around with.

I followed this recipe to the letter. Even though the dark color of the cooked honey whipped out completely, the mixture was so sticky that it left a thick layer in the bowl and on the kneading surface. I thought that it would firm up a bit after I left it to set, but once I cut it into strips the torrone oozed out between the wafer paper, flattening under its own weight. I wouldn't call the texture a "subtle chew"; its stringy and sticky like taffy. The flavor was sharply sweet. Pistachios were a nice change, but the almond extract with the honey overwhelmed the orange blossom water. Zero forks from me, sadly.

First of all, for the people that reviewed without leaving forks or trying the recipe, you're making the rating go down. If I could give this recipe extra forks, I would. The flavor and texture are excellent, and the pistachios are a nice change from the more traditional almond torrone. I prefer my torrone a little softer/chewier, so I cooked to the top of hard ball instead of hard crack and it turned out great. Wafer paper is a must, but if you can't find it, liberally oil your dish and then dust well with confectioners sugar or a combo of confect. sugar and cornstarch sifted together. Be sure to cook over medium heat to avoid burning the honey, and run a wet brush around the sides occasionally to keep the mixture from burning at the edges. I didn't find it necessary to knead it, since I went with a softer texture; however, if you cook the syrup to hard crack, and beat it appropriately, it's easy to knead. I will definitely add this to my candy repetoire!

I also thought at first that the sugar and honey looked very dark for what the finished product should look like but I followed the recipe exactly. Once you've added the syrup to the egg whites the color gradually fades as you whip it and it becomes an off white. Boy is this stuff sticky though! My hands were covered and I could hardly get the mound off my hands into the pan! Cleans off easily though with hot water. I used parchment paper as I had no edible and I also mixed in almonds with the pistachios. It's sitting now and I can't wait til it's ready to taste!

I am making this, and the sugar seems VERY dark and I wonder if the temperature is too high. The cooked sugar looks like caramel. I've verified that my thermometer is working correctly, but the mixture looks like dark -- not white as it appears in the photo. I've looked at other recipes for Torrone, and the temperature on the candy thermometer is specified as lower -- in some cases 260 degrees F. Could it be that the temp specified in this recipe is not correct?
