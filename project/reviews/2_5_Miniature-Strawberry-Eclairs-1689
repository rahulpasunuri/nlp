Repulsive. Disgusting. I don't know what anyone was thinking when they submitted this recipe. Perhaps their tastebuds were in complete disrepair--do NOT even waste your time or effort.

The potato starch gave the filling a weird taste. And the nondairy creamer- YUCK! I also tried this with half and half and milk, but was still dissappointed with the results.

Yes, worth the effort. Also - try the pastry creme filling with a yellow sponge cake and chocolate glaze for a pareve "boston cream pie"
