Instead of turkey I believe Blackhawk used cooked bacon diced up.

I'm not sure why the other reviewers didn't like this, however, maybe it's because of the turkey sausage. I used sweet italian pork sausage from my local butcher (excellent stuff!) and followed the recipe. Even my kids who aren't fond of cooked spinach like this dish. It's easy and very tasty.

The chicken stock, and sausage conflicts with the dish. Also not creamy enough turned out kind of watery. I will never make it again.

I liked the sound of the combination. Unless you're serving a meatless main course, the turkey sausage conflicts with your taste sensations. I made this recipe in advance and reheated it. It does not reheat well.

I liked this recipe, it was easy to prepare. For my dinner, I grilled salmon which was placed on top of the creamed spinach (made without the sausage)and drizzled a little lemony white wine sauce over with some roasted red peppers for color. Definitely not low cal but splendid for the impressive dinner.
