This is a good choice for a quick, tasty & meatless main. I've made it a couple of times now. Here's my modifications: Like others, I don't fry tortillas; skip tomato sauce; add can of diced tomatoes with spice (like Rotel - or we have a store brand here with chili spices); add dice roasted poblano &/or bell pepper. I also partically mash some of the beans. This provides a little more stickiness to the mix and varies the textures since the corn and beans are very similar.

I've been making this for years and my kids love it. A great vegetarian dish, super quick and easy, and very little clean-up! I usually throw some cheese on top as well which makes it slightly more attractive, plus the kids love the extra gooeyness. Great family meal.

Based on the other reviews I made some minor modifications that made this dish out of this world!!! I used corn tortillas, fresh corn off the cob, and fresh tomatoes and onion instead of jarred salsa. I also squeezed lime at the end for added flavor. This was simple and delicious! Will definitely make this again,

I have to admit I have a bit of a bias against casseroles, but this was excellent and I'll make it again. Easy, flavorful and serves many. I freshened it up with fresh corn (2 ears, sliced off the cob and added raw), can of Muir Glen diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, and double the scallions and cilantro. Used fresh salsa instead of from a jar in the filling and topped with pico de gallo, avocado and cilantro. I took other reviewer's suggestion and used corn tortillas -- much better (though the top layer curled a bit in the oven.) It didn't really hold together well so was not the most attractive on the plate, but great meal!

Good! Very basic - but tasty. Changes I would make for next time - more cumin and some oregano. Also, tortillas get soggy and kind of hard to cut. I think I will fry them and serve on the side next time with melted cheese tostado-style. Cheese is lost in the runny/wet filling.

i only used half the salsa and doubled the cilantro and cumin. Also i appreciated that others thought, like i did, that cooking the tortillas ahead was unnecessary. It was a huge hit. I served it with some avocado and sour cream. It was easy to throw together--had most ingredients in the house already, and cleanup was a breeze. Fabulous for busy days.

I've been making this for a number of years, it's pretty good. If you want a truly rockin' breakfast, reheat some of this the next day, make some eggs with soft gooey yolks, sunny side or poached, and put them on top. A great vegetarian version of huevos rancheros. And to make it a little more meaty, saute up some chorizo (take it out of the casing, and add it before the eggs. Bam, as they say on that other site.

These were super easy and I happened to have everything on hand. I did brown some ground turkey with cumin, chipotle powder, and a dash of hot sauce and used it as the first layer. it was excellent and can be modified with whatever you have on hand!

My wife and daughter loved this one. A spoonful of sour cream to top it off doubles as the "whipped cream" on the slice of pie.

SUPER easy to make -- and such a HIT with EVERYONE. I too adjusted and used corn tortillas instead of flour and it was delicious. I'm vegetarian but my boyfriend isn't, and is always convinced a meal needs meat... but he was totally satisfied with this hearty dish.

EASY and flavorful. Made for group of girlfriends for Mexican themed dinner and all raved/wanted recipe. Put it together before dinner and popped in oven when guests arrived. Would advise covering with plastic wrap if putting together before as tortillas have a tendency to curl up. Like previous reviewer, I did not toast tortillas before layering in recipe and they were still crispy when baked. Save the time used for that step. Will definitely make again and again.

Oh! And it must be made with corn tortillas. The flour dissolve into a nasty paste. Top with chopped red onions, chopped avacoado, chopped tomato & drizzled with La Crema. Oh so good!

I actually crave this dish; it's a great "comfort food." I buy the low-carb tortillas (which are smaller), so my pie has more layers, but the height doesn't make it any more difficult to cut/serve. Yum!

You basically can't go wrong with this recipe. I used canned corn, added chicken, whole wheat tortillas and didn't fry them, added some cheese on top, covered it all and cooked for 20 minutes, uncovered for 5-10 minutes more. You could certainly adjust a number of ways and this would be delicious.

Very tasty and easy to make- I used leftover turkey chili instead of the beans and tomatoes, and whole wheat tortillas. Also put some enchilada sauce on the top layer. Really yumm, and the leftovers held up well for lunch the next day.

We loved, loved, loved this recipe (except my daughter wouldn't eat it since it was too spicy due to the jalepeno jack cheese we used). We made it again with jalepeno jack and cheddar jack combined and she was able to eat it. We also added chicken to the mixture (we cut Trader Joe's "Just Chicken" up into small cubes). This made it more of a meal. Yummy and satisfying!

I made this the way the cook from Dallas, TX, suggested, using corn tortillas and extra sauce, and, for such a simple dish made almost entirely out of convenience items and requiring no stovetop prep, it was great! I mixed together a cup of enchilada sauce, a cup of tomato sauce, and a cup of medium salsa, and I kept some of that sauce separate from the filling mixture. I used the reserved sauce to coat the bottom of the casserole dish, to lightly coat each tortilla, and to top off the pies after they were assembled. Since I could only find corn tortillas in the small size, I made two pies. I grated what was left of my brick of pepper jack over the top of the pies and then baked them at about 400 degrees for 25 minutes or so - that worked fine. I served this with the Mexican salad with honey-lime dressing from this site and it made for a nice, low-key dinner.

Ooops. I forgot to second, as a WW helper, to do as many others have done: do not fry the tortillas; they really don't need it.

Made it the first time according to directions. Outstanding. But ax we are on Weight Watchers, I made some changes. Corn torillas, not flour -- big difference. No cheese at all. Used a casserole dish the same circumference as the tortillas. Used enchilada sauce rather than tomato sauce. Used picante for some kick. Lots more cilantro and cumin. Took advice of previous rater and baked covered for 12 minutes and uncovered for 3 more. Cooking it longer doesn't hurt. I can save the leftovers and heat them up in the microwave for lunch. The fat free sour cream is a help.

It was okay. I think I used the wrong salsa. I also think it would have been better with chicken or something. I also don't see how it could heat through in 12 minutes. It was quite thick? I heated for 30 minutes. I think it will be much better after it settles too!

This is a fabulous too-tired-to-cook, throw-together dinner. A recipe is hardly even required; just throw together whatever you have on hand (always with lots of cheese), bake it up, and YUM! I used red kidney instead of black beans, and a whoe jar of salsa instead of the tomato sauce. We also didn't have scallions so I used extra cilantro instead. Perfectly delicious comfort food!

This recipe was great! Very easy to make and very tasty. I don't like cilantro, and didn't have scallions or cumin, so I just added in some chili powder to give it a kick. I also added extra kidney beans because we love them. I used a one-layer cake pan and it turned out to be the perfect height. I probably won't fry the tortillas next time to cut down on calories. My picky husband even commented on how good this was. We've added this to our list of staple recipes.

I suggest using a round glass high sided pie plate - the pie fits in snuggly. If you are really going to take advantange of this as a quick meal, I suggest a product I found today that is pre-shredded "Mexican" cheese - it made this quick meal even quicker.

This was a wonderful, simple dish. We used enchilada sauce in place of tomato sauce and medium salsa to give it a little more kick. Also used 3 scallions instead of 2 and baked in 10x10 square dish. It got a little messy with filling coming out the sides - Maybe a springform pan would be deep enough to hold this pie in place?

Very good. As I always look for ways to lighten recipes, I used whole wheat flour tortillas (didn't fry them), low fat Jack cheese and fat free sour cream. Very tasty with homemade salsa and guacamole.

Against my better judgement, I tried this when I was at a loss for what to make and low on supplies. I have to concur with the other Texan on here, I can't understand why anyone likes flour tortillas in a casserole. IT's fine when they're fresh made and wrapped around some carne, but in a layered dish it's unpleasantly chewy and gluey. Corn tortillas are far superior if you want to make a dish like this. For a casserole however, they do need alot of contact with plenty of sauce. Increase the recipe a bit or use some red enchilada sauce.

Rating: 3
Great! I've made it a few times now, subbed green enchilada sauce for the tomato last time. We eat it with lettuce, extra onions and lots of cubed avocado. We also backed off on the temp and baked a while longer. When made as directed, the middle didn't get hot.

I made this for dinner last night, adding grilled chicken breast I had marinated in lime juice, tequilla, etc. I thought the filling ingredients made a nice combination and while I said I would make it again, I wouldn't assemble it as a layered pie. I would prefer to make quesadillas, cooking the tortillas until crisp.

This is very good. I also made this with corn tortillas; same amount and technique as the previous reviewer. To accomodate child's concern about spice I used a little more tomato sauce and a little less salsa. Also added a layer of sausage (because I had some to use up) and some grated cheese on top. This is a fun cooking project with kids as they can stir together the ingredients and help layer.

I've made this recipe for EVER! Don't bother with frying the flour tortillas - I grill my corn tortillas directly on the flame of my gas cooktop. Be creative with different beans, sliced black olives, green chiles. This is great for potluck dinners. I never have to bring any home.

Quick and easy to make. I added some chorizo to make this recipe stand out more and it did. Cooking temp was a little high so I backed it down to 350 and left it in longer. This is a good recipe for adding/subtracting ingredients to find the right combination. Leftovers were eaten the next morning with an egg over the top...kind of a huevos rancheros deal.

I don't know what the obsession is with flour tortillas. Try corn, much better flavor, and the fresher they are the better. Consider mixing salsa and tomato sauce together and set aside. Mix other ingredients separately. Don't fry the tortillas (this adds fat and actually drys them out more). Pour some salsa/sauce into the baking dish and place a tortilla on top. Layer, spooning more salsa/sauce onto each layer. Top with the last tortilla and pour remaining salsa/sauce on top. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake.

I've made a variation of this recipe for years, and was surprised to see it on the website! I use 1 lb. of ground beef, 1 can of diced tomatoes (do not drain) and 1 can of kidney beans (do not drain) INSTEAD OF the salsa, tomato sauce and black beans. It is a winner, and very filling with the ground beef.

Divided the recipe in half to serve 2. Used three 7-inch tortillas, and divided the filling in half to make two layers. I also spread a little picante sauce on the top tortilla of the pie. Baked it, covered, in a 9-inch pie plate about 15 minutes. The tortillas were VERY dry. The filling ingredients do work well together, so next time I will use that mixture to make tortilla roll-ups. I just think that the texture would be better.

This gets 4 forks, not because it is magnificent food but because it was such a crowd pleaser. Everyone loved it-- my husband, the kids, grandma. Very easy and the ingredients are basically all in the pantry. Served with Spanish rice and sour cream and green salad. Next time it needs guacamole and shredded lettuce. Also if you have sides, it serves more like 6 people.

Quick, simple (and very Americanized) Mexican food doesn't get much better than this. I added a tablespoon of hot and tangy cilantro-based chimichurri (from Maria's Taco Express in Austin, TX) to the salsa mixture, and served sliced avocados alongside the finished dish. Delicioso!
