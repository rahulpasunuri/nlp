The dipping sauce had everyone licking the bowl. The artichokes were good too.

Amazing! I love the method used to cook the artichokes.

Followed this recipe almost down to the letter. It is SO good. I agree with another reviewer... I'm not sure I'll ever cook artichokes another way again. And given that you can do almost all of the work a day ahead, this makes for a great entertaining recipe.

This was so good! I brushed shrimp with the garlic oil and grilled them alongside the artichokes. The sauce was awesome with both!

A keeper for sure. Used less honey for the sauce and didn't have seasoned salt, but still turned out great. Loved the effect of the dark sesame oil. Cut artichokes in half and roasted in 425 oven for about 10 minutes. Well worth the extra effort.

These are the best artichokes ever! I can't go back to other ways of cooking artichokes (I have tried).

We ate at Walt's Wharf a while back and really enjoyed this appetizer. The restaurant gives out recipe cards, which I tried it but it was not anything like what we had there. Then shortly after, I came across this recipe here and saw that the restaurant version left out the garlic oil at grilling. Since then, I have been making this recipe over and over and just love it. The first time I followed the recipe exactly as written and found that steaming the artichokes for 30 minuets is too long - they fall apart during the grilling step. I cut it down to 20 minutes and it was perfect:).

Two big changes: I didn't grill the chokes and only had light (clear) sesame oil. It was still very good, and a nice change from my usual vinaigrette. I'll definitely try it again when I can get my hands on dark sesame oil.

These artichokes are the best!!! Walt's Wharf is one of my favorite restaurants and the Oak Grilled Artichokes are the reason why. Now that I live on the East coast I make this for friends and family and it's a hit every time!

Too much lemon for my taste, but I used light mayo, which may have contributed to the acidity. I added Snofrisk creamy cheese to counter the acid and firm it up a bit. I also used Gilroy Garlic Award mix instead of seasoning salt.

This is a yummy recipe...I made the dipping sauce with yogurt (drained) and it was perfect!

I was disappointed. I like my daughter's version of this better. She uses the 1/2 C mayonnaise, a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce, 3 Tbsp soy sauce, 2 Tbsp. sesame oil, 1 Tbsp. rice vinegar and 1 - 2 Tbsp. honey (or sugar).

The dipping sauce ingredients are excellent - don't change a thing. I have made this many times to rave reviews. The sauce is also good for dipping with fresh bell peppers and cold roasted aspargus.

Easy, quick, unusual. Better than the grilled chokes I have had at most restaurants. The sesame gives a lovely nutty flavor (used supermarket standard from the asian foods section, nothing fancy.) Rave reviews from everyone who tried it! Also tasty served cold.

yes very nice indeed provided you get a good quanity sesame oil: that is not so easy

This recipe is excellent. I cut down on the worcestershire sauce by 1 tablespoon, thought it was a little over powering. It is important to use a high quality honey, the little plastic bear kind will not work out well. I love artichoke just steamed served with hollindaise, but after trying this one, its the only way i make it.

I didn't make the sauce (I used basil aioli from this website) It turned out fine. I prefer to have the entire artichoke so guests can pull leaves. Slicing it made it difficult to serve. But it tasted nice. I'll make my normal artichokes and then try the sesame dipping sauce...

Yummy yummy sauce -- nice grilling method for the artichokes, but the star is definitely the dipping sauce. Would go well with chicken.

Made the dip w/ yogurt instead of mayo. Dip was great with grilled chicken, too!

My new favorite method for cooking artichokes-- watch out for overcooking the 'chokes, however. Ours were medium-sized; we steamed for 20 minutes, and they were a little too soft after grilling (but still quite yummy). The sauce is a bit much-- I cut back on honey and sesame oil as others have suggested. Next time I'll probably add a bit more mayo. Would also complement grilled asparagus, shrimp, and/or chicken skewers. (Hmm... that's a rockin' first course for a future dinner party...)

The sauce recipe calls for WAY too much sesame oil. That was really the only flavor we could taste. Perhaps by cutting that down a bit it would have tasted better, but we were not impressed with the recipe as is.

I don't bother grilling the artichokes, it's too much trouble, this review is just for the sauce. As written, I wasn't terribly impressed... it was okay, but not great. With the following modifications however, I make this every time we have artichokes: instead of seasoned salt, I use plain salt and pepper to taste, I substitute 1/2 Tbs of the toasted sesame oil with chili sesame oil for a bit of a kick, and reduce the honey to 1/2 Tbs. In my opinion, those are the only alterations that it needs. Fabulous!

We all really like this recipe. YOu must make sure the artichokes are very close to being cooked when you put them on the BBQ

Used the dip with a crudite because of the great reviews. What a waste. Disgusting. I didn't even know which way to go to fix the flavor. Also made soy dipping sauce from jade dumplings. It was very good and may toss with noodles and veggies tomorrow.

Making this for the second time in one month. This is a super delicious dip for artichokes, but also for beef. I made it as an appetizer and then served a tritip. This sauce was so good, we used it to drizzle over the beef too. Fantastic! Will make it again and again.

Quoted from my five year old: "UMMM! It tastes like... SAUCE! I love it. Can we make that again?" (he licked the bowl I whisked it in) I only used 1 tbs. of the honey, but thought it was fantastic. Probably would taste perfect just the way it was written...

The olive oil, minced garlic, salt and pepper *by themselves* are stunning on the artichokes. The dipping sauce is a tad too sweet and overpowering and the taste lingers a bit too long, but, it's completely up to the dipper to adjust.

Everyone at the luncheon raved about this recipe. The sauce really made it special. And the artichokes were so much better with the grilling time than merely steaming them.

I love the SAUce ! I also used the same sauce on chicken strip and shrimp kabobs and place it on the grill as with the artichokes. It was a meal that my friends will remember for years!! thank you - Boo Boo

I loved the preparation of the artichokes and will make that again. My husband like the sauce, but I thought it was a little strong for a grilled vegetable.

Our 2004 summer favorite. We could just drink the sauce with a straw. It's also great on aspargus.

I love Walts Wharf and their grilled artichokes. The dipping sauce is better there. My husbnad and I always grill our artichokes, when I saw the recipe for the dipping sauce I was thrilled. However, the sauce is not great. As suggested I cut back on the honey, but should have cut back on the sesame oil as well. I would make it again but with more tweaking.

YUMMY!! I have made this several times and love it. Cut the artichokes into quarters for easier turning. Guests always rave about this one.

Alot of work for okay results. Cutting the artichokes into six wedges made them too delicate to flip on the grill after the steaming - I ended up with artichoke pieces instead of wedges. Next time we will just quarter them. Sauce is pretty good though.

A winner! Served this at a recent dinner party and all the guest loved them (even those adversed to vegetables!). We spooned the dipping sauce (lightly) over the chokes. It was a great combo. Making them again for the 4th!

I made the artichokes for an appetizer on fathers day. Everyone loved them, and the dipping sauce. I'm bring this dish to a party this weekend.

I wasn't sure how to rate this recipe. The grilled artichokes, definitely 4 forks. The sauce, 0. So, overall, I gave it two. I halved the artichokes (instead of cutting them in six wedges). They were absolutely delightful, needing only a squeeze of lemon. Even my father, an artichoke-phobe, gobbled them up. I thought the sauce was terrible and overpowered the artichokes. This is after reducing the sesame oil to 1T. I'll definitely make the chokes again, but will bag the sauce.

This is a wonderful summer B-B-Q recipe. I made the artichokes a day ahead then brought them to room temp. before grilling them. Everyone enjoyed this unique recipe. :-)
