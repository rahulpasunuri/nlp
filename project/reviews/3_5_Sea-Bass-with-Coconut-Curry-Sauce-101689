Excellent. We all loved it. It does make a lot of sauce, but it's delicious!

With the following ammendments, first of all I did add a splash of fish sauce and a heaping teaspoon of red chili. The curry powder I use is a hot curry powder so there isn't much of a change of getting 'no flavor'. The biggest difference though was that I only bought one can of coconut milk and it was to late to run out for more after I re-read the recipe. I was cooking for three and we had so much sauce left over I've gotten two more meals out of it. Served this over the coconut cilantro rice off this site. It was a pretty spectacular meal

A nice base sauce but needs a bit more spicing for fuller flavour.

Loved the added suggestions and made an additional "smokey" alteration. Result was wonderful! After preheating the oven to 300 degrees, I soaked a few handfuls of mesquite chips in water for about 30 minutes. After draining the chips, I wrapped them in foil, forming a closed packet, and punched a few holes in it. Placed the chips in a shallow baking pan and topped with parchment paper, which I also added ventilating holes matching the foil vents. I drizzled olive oil over the fleshy part of the sea bass, then sprinkled a little kosher salt and some dried basil over the fish. I placed it skin-side down on the parchment paper and slow roasted in the over for about 30 minutes, turning the fish once after about 20 minutes (I had halved the recipe). I omitted the veggies entirely, instead mixing 1/3 cup coconut milk and 1/3 cup low-sodium chicken broth with red Thai curry paste, a couple of dashes of fish sauce, and some dried basil. Simmered the sauce as suggested to cook down by half. When the sauce was done, I drizzled some on the plate, added the sea bass (sans skin), then drizzled a bit more sauce over the fish. Excellent! Thanks to everyone for the suggestions.

This is a great recipe - simple and delicious! I used red curry paste instead of the curry powder, added red bell pepper to increase the nutritional value and make it more of a meal, and garnished with fresh cilantro - yum! One note: a little fish sauce really would make this already great sauce even better.

i thought this recipe was very nice and simple to make- i added more garlic and some cayenne to the initial mixture. and at the end i added some slivered red pepper along with the carrot, which made for an attractive plate. the bass worked very well with the sauce.

This fish rocks -- I think I'm going to have to dedicate a shelf in my frig to fish being marinated for this recipe. Who are the 12% who wouldn't make this again? (Probably the same people who think Bush is a good decider.) I used Corvina (a Central American fish) which worked fine, but it did break apart when I took it out of the pan (not such a pretty presentation). My husband said it was one of the top 3 fish he's had (second to Nobu black cod and Betelnut Chilean sea bass).

I made a modified version of this recipe: instead of the curry powder, I used 1 tspoon of green curry paste and I added 1 tspoon of fish sauce and some fresh thai basil. It was fabulous and not bland at all! Will keep my version on file...

I used tilapia for this dish, and I added jalepenos and cilantro. It was fabulous. It's a must to serve this with rice to sop up the extra sauce. It's a keeper!

Followed it to the letter and I wouldn't change a thing. Definitely will make again and again...

My sauce turned out to be thick, creamy and sweet. I used one can of coconut milk, 1/2 cup chicken broth, a few tablespoons each of major grey's chutney, a store bought peanut sauce and a few teaspoons of sugar. I simmered this down to a thick sauce and served it over thai noodles and pan seared grouper.. I was really delicious!!

My husband asked me to keep this recipe in the permanant file. He loves it. I find the sauce to be a bit lacking in flavor, but the fish has a strong flavor so it balances out. I will try the hot pepper & cilantro as was suggested & see what the "food Critic" thinks!!

Everyone talked about blandness so: I used red curry paste and added a jalapeno. I also added chopped cilantro at the end of the sauce cooking process. This is good!

I agree with others that sauce needed a little kick. I added a teaspoon of thai chili paste and it spiced it up nicely. I served it over jasmine rice and added a dollop of a mango/apricot chutney that I threw together and served it after an appetizer of sauted edamame. My guests were impressed and it was minimal effort.

Delightfully different. Maximum flavor for minimum effort.

Like many other reviewers I also thought this sauce was a little bland, so at the last minute I added about 2 heaping tablespoons of Major Grey chutney (taking a cue from another great curry recipe on Epicurious - Fragrant Beef Curry). The chutney made all the difference in the world! I can't wait to follow other reviewers advice and serve the leftover sauce with shrimp tonight!

This is a wonderful dish, and I didn't think the sauce was at all bland. If anything, it's a little rich. I served it with the jasmine rice timbales with sesame seeds (this website) and got rave reviews. I am under orders to make this again!

This is a fabulous recipe! I added more carrots than called for and my family thought it was great!

This was a very popular dish in Tahiti, it reminded us of our time there. Also, try substituting pure vanilla powder for the curry! We thoroughly enjoyed it :)

The sauce is bland and needs additional herbs/spices, such as cilantro. It could be a good base for something else, but was overpowering for a nice fish such as sea bass.

fish was delicious, but sauce was bland. next time, i'll add some fish sauce & palm sugar.

this was very very good and easy. we made it with large shrimps instead of the seabass and it was just delicious.

Amazing curry sauce! And fairly fool-proof as well. I tried the shrimp but it's the best with the seabass.

Started off with a crisp romaine heart salad and fresh baked cumin bread. Toasted with a glass of Oregon Reisling, and then presented the Bass accompanied with roasted chive potatoes, asparagus-carrot-snap pea-red bell pepper saute. Awesome sauce, very yummy with the fish. Can't help but tell ya, I put two prawn shrimp on the top of the fish. But with the left over shrimp and sauce the next day I made smoked gouda, coconut curry shrimp quesadillas, the best Sunday lazy food ever, and I finished the Reisling with IT!

We tried it for Valentine's day. We served it over couscous with a garlicy potato soup. It was very yummy. The left over couscous with the coconut curry sauce made an excellent lunch!

Will definitely make this dish again, but would love to try the variation suggested by another reviewer and have it with shrimp. The sauce is really delicious, good to serve with rice to soak it up. Made the sauce the day before, and then the preparation for dinner was really simple. Would be nice for a dinner party that way.

Awesome! We used cod fish because our fish monger was out of sea bass. Delicious and very easy to make. This will impress my mother-in-law. Also, easy for beginner cooks.

Great sauce. We heated the left over sauce and added prawns, cooking until they were just pink. It was delicious served over rice. We preferred it to the sea bass.

This went down very well with three friends, I used the red rice (can't remember the name) for fish plus a thai salad and gazpacho for starter. I've also tried it with haddock and a spicier sauce that has worked well. Easy and fairly quick, great recipe.

Excellent flavor. I would also concider serving sauce with Rockfish or Cod.

Light, Flakey. A wonderful flavorful summer dinner. Great for dinner parties also.

By coincidence we didn't use the sauce until the day after it was prepared - the flavors were wonderful!
