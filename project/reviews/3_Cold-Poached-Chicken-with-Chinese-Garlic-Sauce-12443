I used the sauce from this recipe to marinade and baste some chicken thighs I grilled tonight. I used oyster sauce in place of sesame oil and/or chili oil, and used honey instead of sugar and it came out moist and bursting with flavor! I

Probably good for some tastes, but sauce was too sweet for our family. Maybe it's better with more tabasco.

I just loved this dish. I used sherry for poaching the chicken and now pretty much always poach chicken this way. I tried doubling the recipe, but the sauce was better the first time around.

This is great, and super easy. I'd skip the scotch next time (I'm not a big scotch fan, and found the smell of the peety scotch cooking pretty ugh), but I still loved it.

I made this recipe shortly after I received the magazine. I thought the scotch gave the chicken great flavor. I used a very good smoky single malt scotch becauae that its what I had on hand. I looked this recipe up because I need poached chicken for another recipe and I remembered this one. I plan to make the whole recipe again and cook additional chicken for my other recipe.

Simple. Easy to prepare. Delicious. To make it even easier, I used leftover barbecued chicken breast instead of poaching it. The smoky flavor mixed with the soy and garlic was great!

Found it somewhat bland so I modified it somewhat. Chicken Stock instead of water, triple sec instead of scoth, soy sauce (in the poaching liq). Sauce I added 5 spice pdr. After chicken was cooked, I brought a cup of cooking liq to a boil and added the sauce ingrd. Served on a bed of julienned carrot and chinese cabbage sauteed with oyster sauce. Singaporean background helped!

Basic, but tastes good and is so easy to prepare. I do admit that most of the flavor is in the sauce, not the chicken. I am experimenting by adding soy sauce, sugar, and scallions to the boiling water. This recipe is very similar to Cold Poached Chicken with Ginger Scallion Oil.

This is quick and easy to make after working all day. We've made it tons of times and love it each time. I'm not sure what someone found "boring" about it--adjust the chili oil & garlic for an extra kick. Served with steamed rice and green beans or broccoli, it makes a great dinner.

Distinctly boring: don't bother.

I mainly tried this recipe for the garlic sauce. It also works well with shrimp and beef
