This was an excellent way to try to cook some escarole from the garden. It's a delicious blend of flavors with the shallots and portabella mushrooms. We'll definitely make it again.

This is it... this is my stuffing recipe now. I've made it for Thanksgiving 2001 and 2002. We like our stuffing on the dry side, so I dry the bread somewhat in a slow oven. Very, very tasty... the roasted vegetables in the stock and the roasted garlic and mushrooms in this recipe add a very nice flavor and aroma... I'll never skimp on the portobello mushrooms or the shallots... the smell of the kitchen alone makes this recipe and the vegetable stock (see ingredient list) something to look forward to when you're gonna do another turkey.

I made this a day ahead and reheated on Thanksgiving and got many raves for this,a must-have for next year! I doubled the amount of mushrooms and added 2 more eggs.

EXCELLENT! DELICIOUS! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving in our house without my traditional stuffing, but I always try a new recipe for the "dressing" cooked outside the bird. My guests LOVED this dressing...no leftovers:-(

This was a hit at my Thanksgiving dinner, however, next time I will triple the veggie stock, cream and egg to make the dressing more moist, the way my family prefers. I made the dressing a day ahead and chilled in the fridge, which seemed to intensify the tastes.
