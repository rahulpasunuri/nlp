Really enjoyed this. Too hot here in July to have live crawfish delivered,and no local markets actually have them in stock so we used frozen, cooked crawfish (9 lbs) and added large shelled shrimp (9 lbs) with the tails. Doubled the other ingredients and served 8 until everyone was full! Served with Red beans and Rice! Made a beautiful and colorful presentation on the buffet!

You left out the very necessary step of purging the crawfish before you boil them. Purging requires putting the crawfish in an ice bath with bunches of salt poured in. It gets the crawfish to purge themselves and leaves the water very muddy and brown.

A good recipe. We had a crawfish boil for 14 including 2 certified Cajuns. It met with their approval except for the salt. Traditionally the boil should be more than "potato chip salty". We used 3-4 cups of salt for 3 gallons of boil. I can recommend the suggestion of sprinkling with cajun seasoning and allowing them to rest. As for amount we had a few leftovers with 2 lb crawfish/person, 1/3 lb shrimp/person and 4 inch piece of andouille sausage/person.

If you don't have live crawfish in your area check out www.cajuncrawfish.com . Live crawfish, crawfish tails, andouille sausage and much more cajun food!!

Well, it's good, I've had this stuff many times, but after you pull off the head and peel the tail you're left with one little bite per mudbug. 5 lb is a snack for two cajuns, 5 or 6 people could eat more like 20 lb, or you'd better make LOTS of veggies.

What about if you don't have "Live Crawfish" available in your area but there are some already boiled at the Winn-Dixie store? Should I cook then the same way as in this recipe or should I do something a little bit different? Thanks Roberto Rodriguez from Miami, Florida

Why would you use crab boil instead of Zataran's Crawfish Boil. Cook Crawfish after vegies are removed because you need to remove the crawfish from the pot and pack them in styrofoam ice chest with alternate layers of Crawfish Boil powder. Let crawfish "ripen" that way for about 45 minutes. Then serve.

i suggest that after 8 minutes, crawfis be removed from fire, and let rest in the cooking liquid a few minutes...meanwhile, have another beer!
