Decided not to change the recipe first time making it. Ingredients were really off. Recipe only calls for 2 eggs and 2 egg whites, not enough to hold anything together and came out as a large tasteless mush. Garlic is missing from the ingredient list.

I did half potatoes and half parsnips and I added Dill, 2 more eggs, and Parmesan. This is delicious, but it needs lots of salt and pepper.

Good but needs modifications. I used 5 eggs and added Parmesan cheese just before I broiled it. Without the cheese it would have been a little bland.

I make this dish all of the time. Most of the time I don't use the potatoes and increase the number of eggs to 6 whole. I also use a bit of ceyanne. You can use any type of green but the cooking times will vary. If you use a green leafy vegetable other than kale there is no need to blanch Great way to get the greens into my diet.

I agree with the other reviewers about the proportions here. I used 4 whole eggs and subbed spinach for kale. It tasted delicious both times I made it, but better when I didn't blanch the spinach- just threw it in whole and it was better because it didn't retain any water. Very tasty, but add a good amount of salt and pepper.

There is something very wrong with the quantities in this recipe, 6 whole eggs were barely enough to hold the vegetables together in a respectable frittata. And the kale needs to be cooked much longer than indicated. The end product looked nothing like the photo but was quite yummy, so it is worth tweaking.

Based on the other reviews, I used 6 medium eggs, milk, 1/2 pound of kale and 1 and 1/4 pound of potatoes. It would have been much improved with only 1/2 or 3/4 pound of potatoes. I topped with parmesean, but it still needed some additional spices on top of the paprika.

Very good. You can use the basics of this recipe and do a lot to change it up. I added some organic sausage, used half the kale, and used some of my favorite seasonings from a local spice shop. I used 5 whole organic eggs and topped it with grated cheese. Decided we could add crab, scallops and the like to do a seafood version.

This is a good building-block recipe. I used 2 pounds kale from my CSA which I blanched in the microwave, and used 5 entire eggs. Added 1/2 tsp salt but will opt for Parmesan as suggested by an earlier reviewer. Still, yum!

Made with 3 egg whites, 2 whole eggs and a splash of half and half. Required a tablespoon of olive oil. I made with pre-baked sweet potatoes instead of regular, and it tasted GREAT. Used a half-bunch of kale I happened to have on-hand and it was plenty. Topped with a sprinkle of parmesan -- really made the dish.

This recipe was a good base but did require some tweaking. I added some chili flakes with the onion and the garlic, as well as some smoked salt. I used 4 eggs and a little cream and topped it with a touch of grated sharp cheese. I know this changes the recipe a bit, but the adjustments didn't change the nutritional information greatly, if you were serving this to 4 people.

Not a bad recipe, but only if a several important adjustments are made. First of all, a full pound of kale is absurd. Try about a third of that. It also does require more eggs. Probably 1.5 to twice the amount specified. The egg whites should be replaced with regular eggs if flavor is a priority. It would go well with some chorizo, too. But that would admittedly be getting away from the "healthy" point of this recipe.

Incredibly dry - next time I'd use 6 eggs and maybe some milk or cream. Resulting dish looked nothing like picture.
