Simple and good with abundent Basil from the garden. As suggested I added parmesan, but the basil still dominated. Great with lamb pre-marinaded from the butcher.

Something seemed to be missing in the recipe. I did forget to brown the rice b/4 cooking, so perhaps that was why it was flat. I did add 3T of parm cheese. I do agree - better than some prepackaged or boxed rice dish.

This was easy and yummy. My hubby loves rice but I get bored of it. This is a good way to change things up. It does not serve 2. I used the same amount of pine nuts and basil but I did 1/2 c of rice and 1 cup of broth. It was beautiful!!

Wonderfully simple yet delicious side dish. I have made this at least 15 times and my husband and I love it every time.

This dish is great--not quite as heavy as a pasta dish. I would definitely use half the oil...I toasted the pine nuts in a skillet without oil and salted them lightly before adding to the finished rice. I made this and salmon with mustard glaze and ceaser salad--a new favorite dinner for the fam!

What a trio - pine nuts, basil and rice. Who knew? Better than Curly, Mo, and Larry. Try this one. You won't be sorry!

So simple and such great flavors. Have made it several times and it always hits the mark. For a little extra flavor, substituted chicken broth for water, though it's equally good when it's more subtle.

The basil and pine nut flavors combined to overpower the rice with a resinous/musty flavor. Not bad, just not good enough to make again.

Very good, and very easy. A nice way to do something different with rice that adds some flavor but is still mild enough to go along with flavorful main dishes. Yum!

Delicious! I browned the pine nuts on the stove, then added them to my Zojirushi rice cooker. Mixed in the basil and some parmigiano reggiano cheese after the rice was cooked. Perfect, light rice. I made it with the cod with mediterranean salsa. Great combination.

This was easy and yummy. I added gorgonzola but next time might try asiago or parrano. Either way, the cheese makes it!

This is a very simple dish to make, and it is very flavorful. Try adding some pepper to enhance the taste. A great summer side dish!

Delicious, quick, easy. I had to use more water than called for, cause it dried out. This is a favourite side dish at our house.

The recipe was easy and delicious. It also doubled well. I made it to go with scallops provencal and it turned out to be an excellent pairing.
