I very pleasant summer dish, though I would use a bit less sherry, and a dessert wine. I occasionally use an apple sylabbub when I make an apple tart. Just cream, sugar, cider, and the skin of two apples taken off with an orange zester.

This is the perfect dessert to follow a big Christmas turkey dinner. It takes only a few minutes to whip up, and it can be made the day before. I actually made this an hour before we sat down to feast and it was fantastic. (it didn't separate as described, but i think it looked better this way) I used port instead of the sherry and it worked well. It was a bonus that this was requested by my English father-in-law, as it was their family tradition!
