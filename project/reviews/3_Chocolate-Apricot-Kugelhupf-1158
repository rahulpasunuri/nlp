This was relatively easy (although not a quick recipe) and very impressive-looking, even though I left off the stuff on top. If you like pannetone, you'll love this--it's very dense and satisfying with tea for either breakfast or dessert. The combination of chocolate and apricot was delightful. It's huge; I gave a huge hunk of it away, but in our household of 2 a lot of it still went stale. I'm going to try halving the recipe in a smaller Bundt pan.
