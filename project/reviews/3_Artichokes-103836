You can't go wrong with this basic artichoke recipe. I especially like the idea of cutting the artichokes in half and cleaning them prior to cooking. I used a paring knife to make a cut right right under the fluffy choke, allowing me to pull everything out with my fingers, rather than using a spoon. If you want to minimize any mess, pop a sheet of clean newspaper in your sink first!
