So easy and delicious! Great combo of spices with orange , not heavy at at all. It was a little thick for me so added about 1/2 cup red wine - veg broth would have been fine too. Served with a dollop of fat free Greek yogurt and cilantro . Company very impressed. I am not vegetarian but did not miss meat at all! Refreshing spin a standard recipe and will be made many more times.

I altered it quite a bit because I don't like using canned beans. First I soaked the beans overnight. Then I took a soup pot and sauteed some oil and onions for 5 minutes or so. After that I threw in the beans, lots of garlic, all the spices, salt, and pepper. Stir constantly over medium heat and then, after 5 minutes, add the diced tomatoes, continuing to stir for another 4 minutes. That way everything gets really well-coated and seasoned. Then I added just enough stock (never water) to cover the beans by an inch, turned it on low and cooked it for an hour. It came out very rich and well-seasoned. Since I used my own stock I didn't have to depend on canned beans and their generally bland flavor.

This is my go-to chili recipe. Inexpensive, easy, and feeds a crowd. Tonight, I added butternut squash and adobo sauce. I also halved the orange juice. Turned out phenomenal.

i just don't know how this has such a high rating. For real. The taste of orange is overwhelming and the acidic aftertaste is truly unpleasant. Never again.

This is my new favorite recipe! It's easy, fast, extremely affordable, and absolutely delicious. As a vegetarian who is always looking for something a little quirky or unusual I think this recipe is perfect. The sour, sweet, savory and spicy meld beautifully.

Love it. Somtimes hard to find spicy black beans, but always make it with them. I follow recipe as is. I recommend a sweet orange such as Valencia. Great leftovers.

As written, too much cinnamon, too much orange...so I halved those. My children refused to eat this, it went down the garbage disposal. I thought it wasn't bad, I ate my bowlful and liked it once I spiced it up with Tabasco, but I won't make it again because my kids won't eat it.

This one is always a hit! Its not particularly spicy by default, but that's okay..It allows people to add tobasco sauce to their personal liking. I made this last night for friends, and topped it off with some left over cotija cheese, which got lots of compliments.

Excellent. Can't wait to eat the leftovers today. Ok, I did make some significant changes after reading the reviews. I used fresh and rich chicken broth instead of orange juice, halved the spices, reduced the amount of beans and added sweet italian sausage. I realize that is a totally different recipe but it was really, really good, lol.

Delicious! Easy, quick and yummy! My kind of recipe. I read all of the other reviews but decided to make the recipe as is and really liked it. Very flavorful. One thought I had to make it have more protein power would be to also add brown rice to it.

Rating: 1
I found the citrus flavors to be overwhelming, and not appropriate for a chili. Tomato and orange just don't work together. To try and rescue it, I ended up adding beer, brown sugar, tomato paste and a lot of salt. In the future, I will pick a different chili recipe.

Rating: 4
I made this chili for about 25 people, yes I creased the proportions, but after reading the reviews and being cautious, I too decreased the cinnamon and cumin and adjusted at the end. There was no issue with dryness! The orange zest and orange juice were also reduced for fear of too much acid. With two other choices of mushroom barley soup and corn and chicken chowder... this was was gone in the first 2 hours of our pumpkin carving party. I used New Mexico Red chili powder and offered hot sauce on the side.. kids and adults loved this... by there vote it gets 4 forks! I will make it again!

This was ok... I found myself using it as a crusty bread vehicle. I had no problem with the spices like others have had, but I was much more interested in it for its nutritional content (nullified by all the bread) and its savability.

An okay recipe, that's kicked up using dried beans and reconstituting them the usual way. I make my own hot sauce, so any excuse for a use!

Completely inedible as is -- too much cinnamon. Now I'm stuck with a huge vat of aromatic, but disgusting beans...thank goodness for composting.

Rating: 3
It's only three forks after substantial modifications to the proportion of ingredients. I tried to make it 'as is' but the amount of beans vs. tomatoes was way off. I used about one cup of onion, two cans of black beans, juice of one orange and another 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes. I also threw in a few tablespoons of brown sugar and a 15 can of tomato sauce. After all that adjusting, it seemed balanced and like chili should be. The orange flavor is nice but needs some extra sweetness, hence, the brown sugar.

Rating: 3
This was a really good chili. I enjoyed the orange flavor immensely, and didn't find the zest too overpowering. My guests really enjoyed the meal, and ate it all up. Served with cornbread/jalepeno jelly. I measured out the spices, but found them to be a little too much. Next time, I'll cut the spice amounts by 1 tsp each.

Rating: 4
4 forks for ease and taste..lacking enough cans of black beans, I used 1 of red kidney beans, and also added a can of green chilies fropm the cupboard. Shared it with my French language class here in Paris where it got a big thumbs up - especially from the Latinas there who are also taking classes...

Really excellent. Love the unusual flavours! I can't buy seasoned beans in a can, so I added in a part jar of salsa that was kicking around in the fridge. Also added a couple tsp. cocoa powder.

I made this for a Halloween party and everyone loved it. I used half the amount of cinnamon and orange zest but added one t. of unsweetened cocoa at the end as other reviews suggested. The first time I made it with all the chili powder and it had good spice but for the party I cut the chili powder in half and it was still delicious.

This chili is an extremely fast cook and so simple! I substituted orange juice for the juiced oranges and orange zest and it came out deliciously yummy!

Very, very tasty. Didn't miss the meat at all. But I agree it was a bit acidic and folks that have problems with heartburn may struggle with this dish. I did add a dash of unsweetened choco as most recommended and hot pepper chili flakes since I love spicy.

This recipe is delicious. I usually add a few handfuls of spinach near the end, and plain yogurt to mellow it out.

Adding some notes to my previous review: I've made this several times now, and I really don't get how people are finding it dry! Maybe if you use small/dry oranges? But I just doubled the recipe and ended up using 2 cans of kidney beans in addition to 6 cans of black beans, and I still had liquid to spare with 4 good sized navel oranges and 2 28 oz cans of diced tomatoes. Also, I use the full amount of cinnamon now and find that great, but I am using true cinnamon, not cassia, which may make a difference, since it has a less aggressive flavor profile. I've also continued to add some bittersweet chocolate, which I think adds some great flavor (about 2 oz, or 4 if doubling).

Rating: 4
Easy and delicious! We made this on a recent camping trip and served it over potatoes, and it was a big hit. We used 2T regular chili powder and 2T chipotle chili powder which gave it a nice kick. We also added 2t unsweetened cocoa powder. Also, the oranges we used were extremely juicy so we did not have the problem with it being too dry that others experienced. Definitely worth trying!

Rating: 4
Delicious! I made this recipe exactly as is, and it's wonderful! I think a little chocolate might enhance the flavors even more and still keep it healthy, maybe some Mexican chocolate with cinnamon. Probably used about a teaspoon or two of chipotle Tabasco sauce at the end. The flavors are so versatile, I think this would be good in January as it is in July.

The first time I made this it was much better because I omitted the orange zest. WAY too much orange flavor with the zest added. You may want to consider leaving it out.

I should've consulted this website before making the dish. While my family agreed that it was good, it would have been alot better without the orange, which was way too overpowering. We like dishes spicy so I used a ton of red pepper but it still did not make up for that citrus flavor. The next time I'll omit the orange and use fresh beans instead of canned

Very convenient and cheap. Use your instincts when adding the spices; start off w/ less if you think it'll be too much for you, you can always add later ;) I did add chx stock and simmer a bit longer- for more of a stewy dish- as well as add fresh oregano towards the end. Followed prior advice about chocolate- I have unsweetened cocoa from Ghirardelli, just about a heaping tsp (NB: I halved the recipe).

Rating: 1
I would NOT make this again. In fact, I can't even bring myself to finish the leftovers in the fridge. I added cocoa powder as others suggested and followed the rest of the recipe to a T, and it just does not taste good. The orange is totally overpowering and along with the tomatoes, makes the dish disgustingly acidic. Yuck. Oh, plus, there was definitely not enough liquid, so I had to add chicken stock. Helped with the consistency, but didn't dilute the flavor, unfortunately.

My husband is very picky when it comes to chilli, and this is the first recipe he absolutely loved. The unique combination of spices makes this an exotic version of chilli, and very delicious. I added the cocoa powder, as suggested by some other reviewers, and it was superb.

Wonderful! I halved this recipe because I'm the only vegetarian in my house, and I'm wishing now that I'd made the whole thing because I'm going to love the leftovers! I added some mild green chiles and a tsp of unsweetened cocoa powder and loved the results.

Very quick. Wish I had cut cinnamon in half as previous reviewers suggested, it is very cinnamony. I had to add some extra OJ from my fridge because my oranges didn't produce much juice and the chili was very dry. I suppose it depends on your chili powder, but this was very spicy and not for the weak of stomach, and I come from a family who eats serrano peppers in their eggs for breakfast!

yumyumyum! Super-easy and delicious. Use the full amount of cinnamon and 1.5oz of dark chocolate. Awesome recipe

I cut the cinnamon in half as suggested. The problem was the spiciness combined with fresh orange. Super acidic. I'm not sure cocoa or chocolate would have helped. Need a tums shortly after this dish. I've spent a lot of time in the Southwest and thought my stomach could handle it.

Great recipe! Took a hint from the cook who added mole. I pulled out a can of Green & Black's Organic Hot Chocolate and tumped in about 2 tablespoons. Spicy, fruity and Smooooooooooth!

I liked the idea of the recipe (vegetarian and quick/easy weeknight meal), but the dish was much too acidic for us. After a few bites, we couldn't finish our bowls. My husband also gets acid reflux easily, and with the primarily tomato based nature of this recipe, he couldn't eat much of it. The spices bring out the acidity of the dish, too, so it was almost overwhelming.

Very good recipe for an every day meal!

I enjoyed this dish and would make it again. It's good as-is, but I think it would be better if fresh beans were used instead of the canned variety. That should make the overall texture less mushy. Definitely add chocolate. Doing so gives your mouth a blast of chocolate followed by orange right at the beginning of each bite. Yum!

Made this for a Lenten Friday dinner along with cinnamon spiced cornbread. The orange flavor made this a very unique chili - I ended up using all the zest from the 2 oranges because I didn't want to waste, and really liked the added aroma and flavor. As recommended in other reviews, I added 1 tsp unsweetened cocoa powder and a spoonful of dijon mustard. Even better as a leftover!

Rating: 4
This was soooo good! I find the look of black beans unappetizing so I used 365 brand chili seasoned kidney beans. I also looked over the prior reviews and added less cinnamon (since it can be overpowering), added red and yellow bell peppers, a poblano pepper (i don't like things too spicy) in the beginning, added some chicken broth before simmering, added some 70% dark chocolate, Dijon mustard, chopped cilantro and frozen corn in at the end. It was sooo awesome! There are so may layered flavors in this. the orange is a great ingredient. This should definitely be made!

Different and delicious! I used about 2 oz of 80% dark chocolate, and, as people recommended, reduced the cinnamon to 1 tsp. but I found the cinnamon not very noticeable relative to the other flavors, so I would try the full amount next time. Used some each of chipotle, ancho and cayenne for the chili powder, which was plenty spicy and flavorful at just 4 teaspoons (thanks to the cayenne)--would probably do mostly chipotle and ancho next time with just touch cayenne for heat.

Fantastic. Hubby and I both enjoyed it. 3 yo didn't, but that's not saying much. The orange perked it up. Also added some semi-sweet chips as other reviewers. It didn't need much salt at all. We passed the tabasco at the table. Would definitely make again and can't wait to taste it tomorrow after flavors have melded.

I'm kind of shocked to have to give this one fork- I was kind of excited to make it after finding this recipe, and it's the first time I really really didn't like something I made from epicurious, but the chili was just plain bad. i did add a bit (less than 1 teaspoon) of good quality dark chocolate as a couple of reviewers suggested, everything else was as instructed, but the flavor of the dish made it into an unwelcomed left over in my fridge.

This was really fantastic, especially considering how little time and effort it took. This is absolutely a non-traditional chili, but the cinnamon (and I added some chocolate) make it smell soooo good, and it's really tasty. I took the suggestions of garnishing with grated cheddar cheese rather than sour cream and cilantro, and also served with cornbread. Making it again tonight!

We really enjoyed this one. We tend to like a fair amount of spice, so we made the following changes. + Added 1/4 to 1/2 cup of mole sauce Made from 1-1 1/2 Tbsp concentrate. + Limited orange juice to 1/2 cup. + Limited cinnamon to 1tsp. + Added one additional tsp of chili powder. + Used a small bottle of cognac to deglaze the pan just before adding the beans and tomatoes. + Pureed the sour cream and cilantro together to create a sauce of sorts for the topping. Strongly considering adding some lime or lime zest on the next go round. Sorry for the wonky formatting. It appears you can't do bullet lists for these. :(

Great recipe, great flavor, great prep time. I use a chili powder from Savory Spice Shop called Black Canyon Chili Powder. This chili powder contains some cocoa. The orange and cocoa make a great combination in this chili! A dash of cocoa powder might do the trick too (or chocolate like mentioned in the other reviews)...

Great recipe! I used a handful of semi-sweet chips b/c its what I had on hand. I used regular Goya black beans, which probably don't fall under the "seasoned"category, but it worked out very well. Vegans and meat-eaters alike enjoyed the chili!

mmm - good! Except for the huge amount of cinnamon (which I reduced to 1/2 tsp), I think it would be delicious as written - but of course, we can't leave things alone, can we?! Made the following revisions based on others' reviews: Added 1/2 tsp ground coriander w/ rest of seasonings. Thinned w/ about 1/2 cup chicken broth. Used OJ in place of orange/zest because that's what I had. Added 1 large finely chopped jalapeno and 1 T dijon mustard (great suggestion!) toward end. Served over rice w/ sour cream & cilantro. Very vesatile as a standalone chili, over rice, or as side dish.

This was delicious...I would consider it a 3 fork recipe, but 4 forks if you take into account good flavor for for very little work. Great weekday winter meal. I didn't think there was enough liquid in my tomatoes, so added a little bit of broth. Also added a little chocolate as per previous reviewer. I thought it could have used a little more heat...we passed hot sauce at the table so everyone could add what they wanted. The sour cream and fresh cilantro were good as toppings.

I really liked this dish. A great recipe and combo of flavors. My husband loves chili and I love food with fancier and sweeter ingredients, so this was great. I felt like I made something totally new that tasted great. I might have added a little more hot sauce, but it was still great.

This was a huge hit with my family, and it was very easy and fast to make. I added two tiny squares of very dark chocolate and a dollop of dijon mustard at the same time I added the orange peel and remaining OJ, as those additions have always made chili sing for me. And I served it with grated cheddar cheese instead of sour cream. Delicious!!

This was very tasty. I hate that I'm the first one reviewing this recipe, and I added meat, but it is what it is: I halved the beans and added a package of ground turkey, but it would have been just as good without (I wasn't cooking for a vegetarian crowd tonight). The orange flavor is excellent, but not overly fruity. Cilantro, sour cream, and hot sauce on top were excellent fixings. I served it with a salad and cornbread. Delicious.
