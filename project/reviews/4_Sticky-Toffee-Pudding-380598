I made this for a New Years eve dinner and it was a hit! It was really easy to make, and tasted great! Everyone raved about how good it was, and asked me for the recipe. I will definitely make this again.

Way too sweet........my expectations were set high because of the reviews.......not a bad cake.....but not making it again........the sauce is fine, but overkill with cake.......

This was so good and so easy to make. Made the cake a day in advance. The sauce came together quickly and easily right before serving. The sauce really makes the dish the outstanding creation that it is. Had this last night and I'm still thinking about it now, the next day.

We made this for family and friends and it was a hit with everyone!!!! My daughter, who doesn't like chocolate has been asking us to make it again ever since so it's in the oven now. I doubled the recipe the first time, which worked in a regular bundt pan but today I'm doing it as written and I've purchased the smaller sized pan. I wouldn't make individual cakes because it is VERY rich and 6 servings would be too much per person. It could easily serve 8-10 if you are pairing with a good vanilla ice-cream (which I suggest) or whipped cream.

Very easy. Made it for my 17 year old son and his friends and they LOVED it. The desert goes a long way, more than 6 servings contrary to what the recipe indicates.

My daughter scraped every little bit of the caramel sauce off her plate like some kind of crack addict. It's that good.

TDF = To Die For. Add a little bourbon (or brandy) to some good vanilla ice cream & then refreeze before serving with the pudding. EVEN BETTER!

I left out the brandy and served this with a little vanilla ice cream. It was splendid; my new favorite dessert. I love that it is uncomplicated to make and I had everything except the dates in my kitchen already. My husband and our dinner guests loved it, and so did the kids. It truly is exceptional.
