This is the BEST potato salad recipe I've ever made. I've made it for several BBQ's and it always gets rave reviews. Other than experimenting with different types of olives, I wouldn't change anything!

Delicious? NOT! The dressing combined with green olives, and capers made this salad TOO vinegary! Pucker up! Sounded good but WAS NOT!

I've never been a big fan of potato salad...until now. This is a great recipe. I omitted the anchovies, added extra chopped basil, a little crushed garlic and even a small amount of grated parmesan cheese to the dressing. Delicious!

This is an excellent salad but the ingredients and preparation are a little fussy. I notice that the olive oil has been reduced from 2/3 cup (original amount in Bon Appetit) to 2 tablespoons - a much more reasonable amount. I used red potatoes, green beans, dried herbs, plain ripe olives, and other ingredients that I had on hand. No need to let the beans sit for two hours!

I made this for the family over the weekend and they just loved it. I didn' have capers, but it didn't need it. I also added red peppers and celery for a little more couple. Superb dressing will definitely make this one again.

This was very good. It was nice not to have the usual mayonnaisy potato salad that I sometimes find too heavy in the hot weather. The olives added to the refreshing quality. I put the anchovies in the blender with the oil, etc. because I don't like chunks of them - the flavor is great. I served it with grilled marinated chicken and a tomato compote - perfect on a hot summer evening.

This was a yummy vegetarian supper. I took the recommendation of another reviewer and substituted pesto. I'll definitely make this one again!

We made this as part of our Canada Day Picnic, and a mixed crowd went wild for it! The steaming gives the potatoes a sauciness I've never experienced before; fabulous! And finally, being vegetarian, substituted pesto for anchovies... It was awesome!

This is a wonderful potato salad I'm very surprised I am the first to review it. Great flavor and alternative to the traditional mayonaise salad. I will do it again.
