Perfect mash just as written. I added more shallots because really, how can you have too many caramelized shallots? Delicious - will definitely make again.

Absolutely amazing. Best mashed potatoes ever. Used Yukon golds, left a bit "lumpy". Made in advance, and reheated in the oven - just as good. The shallots took a while to carmelized and I might chop them as opposed to slicing next time, just because there were big pieces of shallot and I think a smaller dice might look nicer. Served with Beef Tenderloin and Horseradish Cream and they were wonderful together.

I made this for my Valentine's Day dinner alongside Beef Medallions with Cognac Sauce. These are simply fantastic. Very easy and very good. I caramelized the shallots in advance, deglazed the pan with the milk and set aside. I peeled and cut the potatoes about an hour in advance and held in a bowl of water until ready to cook. When ready to mash the potatoes, I reheated the shallots and milk in the microwave before adding to the potatoes. I also added a few tablespoons of cream cheese to the potatoes when mashing. I didnt have whole milk so I used half 2% milk and half whipping cream. After mashing the potatoes, I covered with foil and held in the warming drawer until ready to serve. Cant wait to make again, as there were no leftovers!

I made this for New Years Eve. I added 6 cloves of garlic to the whole milk prior to adding to the caramelized shallots. Everyone raved about this dish. This is one of the best mashed potato recipes I have ever made.

This was a solid mashed potato recipe. Even though I actually forgot to put in the last 4 tbl of butter, but they were still super creamy and tasty with the whole milk / carmelized shallot mixture. I would make them again for sure.

I used russets and they got a little pasty. The flavor was good but not a WOW! I think it needs more shallots.

These turned out excellent. I may have used just a bit more butter than called for but everyone loved them. The only change I made was that I added just a little salt and pepper. Absolutely wonderful and very easy to make.

We were excited about this one based on the reviews but it didn't quite deliver to expectations. It was good but seemed to be missing something. I kept adding salt which isn't a good sign in my opinion.

I have never successfully made mashed potatoes which is quite embarrassing but this dish was a huge hit!!! The flavour was lovely and the potatoes were gobbled up. A great dish to accompany loads of meat dishes.

These were such a hit last year, I was asked to bring them to Thanksgiving again this year. So simple, and they don't disappoint, even with a year's worth of expectations in the balance. I use red potatoes and leave the skins in for color and texture, but I'm sure the golds are just fine.

pretty amazing 5 star rest quality mashed potatoes.... doesent get better than this

Fabulous recipe! The trick, in my opinion, was to dry the potatoes, as indicated, and also to warm the milk, as indicated. The only things that I did differently was to leave the skins on the potatoes and to put them into a ricer. The ricer really really helped make the potatoes creamy. These were excellent!!! Best ever

Absolutely delicious. The 2nd time I made them I added a bit less of the caramelized shallots as I found them a bit too overpowering. Have served them with everything from beef tenderloin to salmon and they always get a rave.

Just made it for some of my very Irish friends and they loved it! The sweetness of the shallots really takes plain mash potatoes up a couple of notches. The Yukon gold potatoes make a big difference in my opinion.

The first time I made these, I was trying to cook dinner for my mother and make sure it was delicious and impressive :) These aren't exactly healthy but they are DELICIOUS for how simple they are to make. I have made them multiple times since!

Delicious! Made with organic yukon gold potatoes from Wholefoods. Used skim milk. Next time I'll try Maui onions instead of shallots.

good, not great, doubt that this will leave lasting memories for my dinner guests. I make pretty good mashed potatoes without the trouble of peeling, slicing, and cooking the shallots.

A crowd-pleasing dish. I chose this recipe to go with the Herb-Roasted Pork Loin recipe, because, while the roast recipe produces a lovely sauce, it doesnt produce enough gravy to provide all the flavor needed for plain mashed potatoes. This tasty little side dish complemented the roast perfectly. Though Im not so health conscious that Ill destroy a recipe to use low-fat ingredients, I risked substituting low-fat milk and 4 tablespoons of Smart Balance 50/50 Butter Blend in the last stage of the recipe, and was quite pleased with the results. I did use 2 tablespoons of full butter when cooking the shallots, to keep them from burning quite so easily. I only partially peeled the potatoes before boiling them, because my family likes the slight extra chewiness. Ive served this twice with roasts, but I also think it will be a hit as part of a vegetarian meal.

Didn't think this was anything special. Not bad by any means, a great comfort dish and everyone liked it, but nothing "amazing" or special as stated in the description. Still looking for that special mashed potato recipe.

Great tasting mashed potatoes without all the fat. I used a low-fat soy butter, added fresh sage leaves with the shallots and skim milk and it was excellent.

This is by far the BEST mashed potato recipe I've ever tasted. I could have eaten all 6 servings myself! The carmelized shallot flavor pairs well with almost anything and is so simple to prep. If you want to prep this dish ahead, I successfully stored the peeled Yukons in a deep covered bowl of ice water in the fridge and carmelized the shallots ahead of time as well. I simply heated them up and tossed them into the potato/milk mixture when it was go-time, which helped keep the dirty prep dish count down.

My family loved these potatoes. I used 5% cream, about 1 cup total but otherwise followed the recipe as written. This was a great addition to our turkey. Looks like I will be making them again for Christmas dinner!

This is my go-to recipe when I want to make mashed potatoes with turkey or steak. They are easy to make, and are a nice subtle twist on traditional mashed potatoes.

Rating: 4
Sooo good, and soo easy. It took me longer than 20 minutes to carmelize the shallots, but I did it at a very low heat, which I think helped to ensure there was no crispy texture from carmelizing at too high a heat. I also added more hot milk as I didn't think the potatoes were creamy enough with what the recipe called for. Everyone loved this dish, and we will definitely use this recipe anytime we want mashed potatoes.

Wow!

Wondeful! After the prep, I placed in a lightly buttered dish and put in the oven to get a nice browned top to the potatoes. Easy and full of flavor - served with Mom's Baked Fried Chicken & Gravy - crowd pleaser!

okay. i'm not a big mashed potato fan. neither is hubby. we decided to try this recipe in anticipation of some guests coming over for dinner in a couple weeks. it was really good! i used low-fat milk and probably about 4 tbsp of butter and used onions instead of shallots. this recipe has given us a new appreciation for mashed potatoes. i will honestly never revert to my old way of making mashed potatoes ever again.

OMG... These were the BEST mashed potatoes I've ever made. I cooked the shallots in 2 TBL butter for 20 minutes. Then added 1 1/2 C skim milk and 2TBL butter to cooked potatoes. These were to die for...will be doing this a lot more often...and will probably cut down on the butter going forward, unless having company! :)

Wow! To die for mashed potatoes! I had already purchased the Russet Potatoes so I decided to stay with the Russet. I can't imagine the potatoes tasting any better, but I will make these again with the Yukon Gold. The carmelized shallots make these potatoes a standout in a meal.

These were fantastic - served them with roast turkey and homemade stuffing and brussels sprouts with bacon and lemon (also on this site). Rave reviews from my guests and everyone had seconds. Very easy way to "dress up" mashed potatoes without adding a lot of extra calories - delicious!

This is delicious. The flavors are subtle -- more so than some mashed potato recipes I've tried -- but wonderful. Didn't cook the shallots for a full 20min because they became soft and brown after about 10. Served this with a roast rosemary / garlic chicken.

Made these for Christmas dinner along with beef tenderloin. Excellent choice - very easy and very good. They are easy enough to serve on a regular basis.

Made this to go with Beef tenderloin with port sauce described on this site. The port sauce also has shallots, so it seemd like a good match. It was very good - a bit more elegant than regular mashers, but even the purists in the family (who want their mashed potatoes with butter, milk and not much else) liked them. I cooked the shallots the day before. I chopped them in the food processor before cooking, and cooked them a long time over low heat - to ensure they didn'g get crispy. I poured about half the milk (actually used 1/2 and 1/2 for this)into the skillet and scraped up the bits after removing the shallots. Poured it over the cooked shallots and left in the fridge until the next day - then reheated in micro before adding to mashed potatoes.

Hmm not sure if I made these right. I used baby yukon gold potatoes, and the end result was a bit slimy. I also made the terrible mistake of making the recipe an hour before we ate, and warmed in the microwave just before serving, not realizing that they were cold until my guest and I took a bite. How embarassing! I usually don't make a recipe twice if I had a bad experience the first time, but considering all the other reviews are so positive, I might give it another go...

Excellent dish! I added my own touch by browning the top by putting in the broiler for 5 mintues. It gives it a nice color! Everyone loved the dish and we had no left overs!

I made this as my first meal cooked for my new in-laws and it was a total hit. I served it with the pork tenderloin with pomegranate sauce recipe from this site. I subbed yellow onions and sent them through a Williams-Sonoma dicer to get them teeny, then after they were caramelized added them to russets that had been through a ricer. I'll even admit I microwaved the potatoes and it was lovely. This is a new must for Thankgiving. As a bonus, the pomegranate sauce from the pork on this was a great match, but these easily stand alone.

Everyone loved these mashed potatoes. To avoid the tummy aches that some people get from having too many onions, I baked the unpeeled shallots, drizzled with olive oil and covered, for one hour in a 350 oven. After they have cooled, peel off the leathery layer of peel, and cut off the dark ends. Chop the remaining baked shallots finely and have them ready when making the dish. Let them simmer in the butter while the potatoes are cooking, then fold them in after the mashing is done. Really wonderful, just as amazing the next day in the potatoe pancakes. Had these with the Chicken Marsala recipe from this same site. Definitely a keeper.

Loved the ease and yum of these. Even better-I made extra for the next day's potato cakes. Just add an egg and enuf flour to hold together, form into patties in a little hot oil and fry til golden on both sides. My grandmother would approve of this version!

These were fabulous! It's a great switch up on standard mashers  and on our newly common standard of garlic mashers.

These potatoes were phenomenal. I made the recipe exactly as is and would not change a thing. This has already been requested to become a regular side dish in our house. I loved the different taste of the yukon golds.
