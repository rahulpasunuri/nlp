Dreadful. The sauce is the only thing that matters with this recipe and I found it used far too much vinegar.

This is delicious and beautiful. It's difficult to find a chicken that small, that was the only problem. I had to cook the chicken longer, but it was juicy and perfectly browned. Served this with the potato and pear salad, also on this site. It was a great combination. Will make this again!!

The chicken cooked up beautifully, but the sauce was not very flavorful, and there was fat sunk at the bottom. I think next time I will try some sort of variation maple glaze or drain off the fat before finishing the sauce, as others did.

not a bad recipe. easy to make considering the amount of flavor you get. two recommendation: 1) if you don't have good syrup to add a tbsp of molasses and 2) de-fat the final sauce with a de-fatting cup before serving (it will increase flavor, chicken fat dilutes it)

Great sauce! I used balsamic instead of cider vinegar because I didn't have any on hand, and it tasted fine.

This was just weird. The cider vinegar and the syrup gave it an almost sickly sweet flavour, and the rosemary just didn't seem to mesh with anything. I did like the way the black pepper finished each bite though, and I'll definitely do a spatchcocked bird again -- perfectly moist meat and crispy skin. Luckily I served the sauce on the side so we were able to enjoy just the chicken.

This is the yummiest, juiciest chicken I have ever made and was so fast! It was quite a bit easier than I thought it would be, and just came out fabulous! I served this with a wild mushroom cous cous and grilled asparagus. Great flavor combinations! I only had grade A maple syrup, so I put 1/2 cup of that on the low heat to reduce for a while in order to thicken it up. it worked out just fine. Thanks to the review who reminded to strain the sauce as I almost forgot! It was much smoother and not spicy at all without the peppercorns in it, so it is probably just forgetting to strain that causes people problems.

Yum. Really good and frankly, pretty easy!

Yummy, although I wouldn't rate this as a quick and easy meal. Of course, I'm not very proficient with removing the backbone... Be sure to turn your fan on while you're simmering the vinegar. My daughter complained about the smell all through dinner.

This was a very good recipe. I used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken, but the sauce was amazing. I will surely be making this again.

Simply delicious and so easy to make-this is a real winner!

My husband absolutely LOVED this. I only cooked 1 breast and 1 drumstick but kept the sauce amounts the same as he loves to have extra sauce. I also used 1tsp dried rosemary for the sauce, and 1/2tsp dried rosemary for the chicken (husband doesnt like fresh rosemary). I also used 1/2tsp cracked black pepper - didn't roast whole peppercorns and therefore didn't use a sieve at the end - he thought it was perfect.

Kudos to this recipe. My method of cooking was to use a cast iron skillet on a medium heat gas grill and plunk a cast iron Dutch oven on top. Make sure that your parchment doesn't catch fire (don't let it overhang the pan) Do strain the sauce or you'll be overwhelmed by the pepper. Delicious - this one will have you eating the chicken skin.

This is a truly easy, exceptional meal. I followed the directions exactly and the times and the ingredients were right on. Everyone is always very impressed with this.

Wow!! I was really not expecting this glaze to turn out so great. I didin't use a whole chicken, simply used chicken breasts, much faster for a weekday meal. I also used half vinegar and half white wine for the glaze. I cannot speak its merits long enough, so complexe, well balanced, very tasty. Grilling the peppercorns is a must, I am going to try this with different black peppers in the future.

This is delicious ... the sauce is decadent. I used deboned whole chicken breasts and the skin crisped up to a lovely texture under weight. I did have trouble with the pepper in the sauce. Cooking for a heat sensitive eater, I cut the pepper down to half from the get go. In my first attempt at the sauce the heat was overwhelming. I reduced significantly for the second batch. However with the first batch I did not get as far as the straining ... perhaps it is this step that significantly reduces the heat. I'd like to attempt the full amount of pepper again, avoiding tasting until after the large pieces of pepper are removed.

I used full chicken legs instead of a full chicken, and the recipe was fabulous. Chicken was moist and crispy, with lovely hints of rosemary, and the glaze was to die for. It was hard to imagine that peppercorns, maple syrup and vinegar go together so well, but they do! I used tin foil instead of parchment to separate the chicken from the top pan.

I found this recipe when I needed something semi- quick to cook to have ready for my mother in law who was coming into town. I was completely shocked at the results of this dish. Absolutely Delicious. My husband even looked at me like "whoah..." as I am not known for my cooking. The only thing that was a little confusing was the placement of the legs. I just improvised what I thought seemed right. If I got it right the first time...it's easy for anyone!

This was very tasty, and the sauce was awesome! Served this for Mother's day dinner and every one loved it. Next time I will try with grilled chicken. The pan frying was a little messy and I would like to make it leaner with no skin and no added butter or oil.

I followed the recipe exactly except I used chicken breasts w/ bone and skin instead of a whole chicken. A very good meal. To the people who said 1 Tbsp. pepper was too much, I wonder, did you strain the solids out of the sauce? I found the sauce to be delicious and not at all spicy, and I don't have a high tolerance for a lot of spice.

freaking awesome, perfectly browned and crispy and moist. LOVED the mapley rosemary sauce.

Because this recipe was a success the first time, I decided to make it again with a slight change based on my curiosities last time. When deglazing the pan, I used 1/4 cup bourbon, following the recipe otherwise. The result was awesome! The bourbon gave the sauce a dark, rich taste that reminded me the slightest bit of bourbon pork/chicken at the Chinese place at the mall. This recipe rocks!

Holy moly! This was crazy delicious and so easy. The cooking method also impressed my husband. I did not use rosemary because it was too cold out to go clip some (yes, I am that lazy), and we didn't miss it. Also, i didn't use a whole chicken, but two breasts and two thighs with bone-in and skin- on. I wish I could make this every day. SOOO good. Served with roasted carrots and brussel sprouts.

This was awesome! I made this with boneless skinless chicken breasts as several other reviewers had mentioned and it worked fine, just stick some foil on it after transfering to a plate and let it rest (resting is good anyhow, right?) The chicken breasts were on the medium size range, not too thick so I dabbed them off with a paper towel and then threw them in the pan with the double skillet method for 4 minutes per side and they were perfectly cooked, tender, juicy (adjust cooking time as necessary). I can't wait to try this with a whole chicken. A tip: use the old back of a spoon trick to check the sauce - if you dip the back of a metal spoon in the sauce and then draw your finger through it and the sauce doesn't run back to the middle where your finger was, it's good or at least getting there. I'll say it again, this was just phenomenal! The syrup adds a dark, sweet richness without being too dessert-y because the vinegar cuts the sugary taste. I think I'd like to give bourbon or good, dark aged rum a try in place of some of the vinegar next time. Just make it, you won't be disappointed!

I used a whole chicken. The spatchcock method is just butterflying the chicken - I have not done this before but had no problems after viewing the Youtube video. The sauce was delicious. A lot of work but definitely worth it!

The spatchcock part was hard, so we had to go to Youtube to see how to do it. This was a fantastic recipe! very flavorful. It sort of tasted like Bourbon Chicken at the Mall

I love maple syrup recipes, so when I came acorss this one I went out to buy a chicken! I did find the 2-skillet method a bit of a hassle so I just put the spatchcocked chicken on a rack in the oven, skin side down first, for about 15 mins, then turned it over skin side up, for another 15 mins. Glazing with the maple syrup sauce throughout of course!

This is delicious! I did it with breasts as well but I can't wait to try the sauce with a pork tenderloin! Yum!

Excellent sauce! Used boneless breasts. I did cut down on the peppercorns - used only one teaspoon. Served it with stuffing and steamed carrots.

This was great. I made it with chicken breasts which i cooked in a cast iron skillet. Didn't have any drippings so just added the vinegar and remaining chicken broth to the maple syrup. I was a bit worried that it might be very sweet but the vinegar and the pepper corns balance the sweetness very nicely. Great one !

I didn't have a whole chicken or fresh rosmary but instead substituted two large chicken breasts and dried rosemary. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. The chicken was flavorful and moist, I would definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
A winner! I grilled boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of going the "whole chicken" route. I skipped the deglazing step (nothing to deglaze), added the vinegar directly to the sauce, and let it reduce for another 10 minutes. My kind of recipe: great flavor, a little unusual, and with not a ton of effort!

I made this dish last night and it came out fabulously well. I am still not sure that I properly tucked the legs, because the chicken didn't brown as evenly as I would've liked, but it tasted great. My boyfriend's favorite part was the sauce, it was very tasty, and the cooking method resulted in crispy skin and very moist meat. I accompanied the dish with pan seared vegetables (brussel sprouts, fingerlings, broccoli, and carrots) tossing with fresh rosemary and sage. An all around success.

A great new way to prepare chicken in our house. Loved the sauce as well. I might add even more pepper next time as I think I'd like more of a kick. Yummy!

I picked this because I had all the ingredients and it looked relatively easy. Didn't really expect the response I got. All 3 of the rest of my family raved on and on. And I used boneless/skinless breasts, too. Can't wait to try with a whole chicken.

This recipe has been a hit at our house since it first debuted in Gourmet. This is not the simplest recipe (you will dirty a few pots and pans), but the result is a lavishly rich sweet/spicy sauce for a moist yet crispy chicken. While not something we would do everyday, this dish is a lovely weekend treat or for company.

I was intrigued with syrup so I tried this recipe. Savory and sweet but the maple syrup flavor overpowered the rosemary and the entire dish. First 100% approval recipe I didn't like. You can't add enough pepper to dishes for me so I enjoyed the roasted peppercorn but the wife and kids were turned off by the pepper.

My guests loved this dinner! The only challenge I had was with the demiglace, there was just too much fat left over from the Chicken, so I seperated it off, but the remaining sauce had a wonderful flavor. I also increased the number of rosemary sprigs from two to four.

Yumma yumma. Super easy, right out of the pantry. The kids thought there was too much pepper, but still liked it.

A beauty. I originally made this on my cooktop, but the hug mess it created inspired me to do this on the grill, using bricks for weight. It is currently my favorite way to cook chicken.

Rating: 4
Great, simple dish with restaurant-quality sauce. My sauce wasn't quite peppery enough; next time I might try draining some of the fat off as others have recommended. Also, a lot of moisture built up under the weighted skillet, which was probably why the skin didn't crisp up for me; maybe higher heat was needed.

My sweetie came home from a horrible day, took a bite of this chicken and he started crying. It's that good--sweet and spicy! I did have a problem with the sauce bubbling violently (making a huge mess and burning my arms). Not sure what to do about that...

#1: yes, I have spatchcocked before. #2: GIANT GIANT HIT in our house. MONDO BOFFO BOX OFFICE! The two kids who never agree on what is good that I make chimed in perfect unison THIS IS GOOD!!! I, too, poured off most of the fat in the pan before deglazing. Also used olive oil instead of butter with no difference in taste (2 T at the end) and this will definitely be a family STAPLE!

I loved this cooking technique. The chicken itself was delicious. I didn't care for the sauce, I guess I'm not that big of a maple fan. My husband loved it. I will prepare chicken this way again, maybe with a different sauce.

Very easy and delicious, even though I don't think I got the cutting instructions exactly right. One tablespoon of pepper was just right -- a little warm but not uncomfortably so. Very juicy, and great depth of flavors. The maple flavor is there but it doesn't taste too sweet. There was quite a bit of fat in the pan, which I poured off before deglazing the pan and adding the sauce. Serves four? I think not - two of us devoured it!

This is a French bistro-quality pan-roasted chicken. It's relatively easy to make and along with the savory sauce, is succulent and delicious! I think this will now be my "default" roast chicken recipe!

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe - wonderful textures and flavors - very French bistro. I found that the ratio of a full tablespoon of crushed black pepper to what is essentially 2.5 cups of liquid before reduction (so less than half that after reduction) is too hot for my taste. I dipped the end of a knife into the sauce to taste it while it was reducing, and even that little bit was enough to make my mouth burn for five minutes. I ended up making another pot of the sauce minus the pepper, adding that to the skillet after the vinegar had reduced, and then adding in the peppered mixture to taste, with some additional basalmic vinegar to balance it. I also drained the fat out of the skillet before adding the vinegar, which the recipe doesn't specify. At any rate, it was wonderful. I might half the amount of pepper next time.

Very delicious, the sauce so flavourful. I had to extend the cooking time to about 25 minutes on each side. Maybe due to faulty equipment on my side. I did not have a non-stick heavy skillet, so the skin stuck. Will do this again.

Absolutely ingenious method for preparing whole chicken - a welcome change to the usual roasting. Crust becomes incredibly crispy while interior remains very moist. And the sauce...probably the most delicious sauce I've ever had with chicken! (Granted, I'm a bit of a maple syrup freak, but still.) I do have one tip for those trying "spatchcocking" (the technical name for this method of preparing chicken) for the first time (i.e. everyone on the planet). Depending upon the size of your chicken, you might need to increase the initial cooking time (skin-side down) to 20 mins (from 15). My chicken was close to 3.5 lbs and I had to flip the chicken back onto its skin side at the end in order to achieve the desired internal temp. of 160 in the breasts. And make sure to use Grade B maple syrup: it makes all the difference.
