Absolutely amazing. Simple the prepare but complex in its flavors - each ingredients offers a different bite. Our 3 year old loved it as well.

This is a great flexible recipe. I had spicy salami, so I threw that in instead of pancetta. I thought all of the proportions in the recipe were spot on: perfect amount of rapini, cheese, pasta, and meat. Very flavorful. The meat I used was salty enough so no need to add salt.

THIS IS my favorite recipe from Epicurious. It always is the perfect starter for a memorable meal. I am making it for Easter this year and adding a bit of Sweet bulk sausage and chicken broth...yum.

I used broccolini and imported Italian pappardelle. The pancetta only cost $2.00 which averages out to 50 cents a serving. I followed the instructions and used a little less than 1/2 cup of water. Saved the rest of the water for tonight, because pasta frequently absorbs all the moisture. One tablespoon of oil for finishing is enough. Next is to learn to make my own pappardella. We loved the flavor combination

Really good recipe - but way too much oil, particularly if you're working with fatty bacon or pancetta. Using half what the recipe called for (1 tablespoon when frying onions, one tablespoon at the end) was more than enough. We also reduced the cheese to 2/3 cup, and we didn't need the additional water at all.

Lovely! I used orecchiette pasta, and I followed one reviewer's suggestions of adding sliced fennel bulb with the onions and caramelizing those for 20 mins before deglazing the pan with a little white wine and adding back the cooked pancetta, etc. I think if I had added the water it might not have been as rich-tasting. A delicious cool-weather dish.

I loved this recipe, but incorporated some suggestions from a previous review: I lightly sauteed about 5 oz pancetta and removed it. I used 1/2 bulb fresh fennel and cooked it along with the onion. I steamed the broccoli rabe leaves for 1 minute (didn't use the stems as they are tough & bitter). I cooked fettucine while vegs. were caramelizing, lightly cooked the garlic at the end, then added broccoli rabe, cheese, pancetta, fettucine & 1/2 cup cooking liquid to the pan and finished cooking pasta in the sauce. I served pine nuts on the side. A delicious & nutritious one dish meal!

I made this dish 2 weeks ago and I love the combination of ingredients. I used a different kind of pasta, the one that I have in stock and it was very good. Easy on the red pepper, or use according to preference. It was too spicy for me but in the end, it was delish!

This was really delicious and simple. Used baby broccoly, up the garlic and pepper, and added some truffle oil at the end. Yummy, highly recommend it.

I've made this with another kind of pasta I don't even know the name :-). Added chopped mushrooms as well and followed everything else. Perfect!

Delicious. I've made it as written as well as with bacon and broccoli substitions. Great every time.

My husband and I thought this was delicious, though I made the following adjustments: 1) blanched broccoli rabe in salted boiling water for 2-3 minutes, followed by ice bath. (got rid of the bitterness). 2) browned pancetta in pan first, then removed. added onion next, and also added a chopped fennel bulb at this stage (instead of fennel seeds later on). caramelized onion and fennel for 20 mins, then added chopped garlic and red pepper for the last minute or two. 3) deglazed pan with white wine 4) added broccoli rabe to mixture, followed by pasta, then tossed with cheese, a little pasta water (approx 1/2 cup) and the toasted pine nuts. 5) added a swig of nice olive oil to each bowl when plated. delicious!

My husband and I made this last night and really enjoyed it! Our Whole Foods was out of pancetta so we subbed dry-rubbed bacon which worked well. I loved the mixture of flavors. This was hearty but not heavy. We'll definitely make it again.

This recipe is a diamond in the rough and is in severe need of a large modification: the broccoli rabe! I enjoy a leafy green, but it is extremely bitter and not complementary to the other very wonderful flavors in the dish. I noticed only after making and eating the dish that the majority of reviewers had substituted either real broccoli, broccolini, or arugula and then had given the dish high ratings. I'm not giving up on, just perhaps giving it my own spin next time.

Rating: 4
This was truly an exceptional dish. I substituted arugula I had in my garden for the broccoli rabe but otherwise followed the recipe as is. I have to say that the aromas - first of the smashed garlic cooking in the oil, followed by the onions and pancetta simmering with the crushed fennel seed - were so incredibly heavenly! The fennel seed also added an interesting and delightful flavor. I can't wait to make this again.

I just made this recipe for the second time in the last month. My husband and I love it!! I make it exactly as listed which is unusual for me. The combo of the flavors from the fennell seed, pine nuts, broccoli and good cheese added to the silky texture of the pappardelle is perfect.

My family devoured this recipe, albeit with some changes. I used broccoli instead of rapini, and I added it to the pasta at the end of cooking time, just to blanch it. IMO, the fennel really makes it.

The 1 cup of water seems like way too much. It turned the entire mixture into a soggy mess. I suggest using 1/4, if that.

Rating: 4
I made this with arugula rapini--this recipe came up on a search of that ingredient (currently at the farmers market here). This recipe doesn't need any modifications, at least when made with the vegetable I brought home. I did leave out the second dose of oil. You could probably do this recipe with any braising greens you have.

Rating: 3
Very delicious! This is a great way to start eating healthful greens. If you don't enjoy bitter greens add a splash or two of balsamic to neutralize bitterness, although the fennel and red pepper flakes do a nice job of that.

Wow, broccoli rabe is SO bitter! If you're not a fan of bitter veggies (brussel sprouts, turnips, etc) use broccolini. This was barely edible, and it's hard to ruin pancetta and pasta!

Excellent. Used brocollini & left out the onions to make it more family friendly.

My boyfriend and I didn't especially like this recipe. All the parts didn't add up to a pleasing whole even though it had sounded like it had so much potential. For a similar but MUCH better recipe, I would suggest Giada DeLaurentis' pasta with broccoli rabe (or maybe broccolini)and sausage. It can be found on the Food Network website, or in her Everyday Italian book.

Yummy,yummy. I tried this out myself because husband finds rabe bitter; but it wasn't in this recipe. 2 notes from me: I won't cook the rabe as long next time, it was crisp,green sooner than stated. I won't add the cheese to the pan, it just gooed up my tongs and stuck to them. I'll just serve it with each dish. Flavor was fabulous. Make sure you cut off a good section of the rabe stem and don't use that. Also, I wash the night before, wrap in cloth and store in frig. That way it is clean and dry when I want to use any recipe. Can't wait to convert my husband!

This was everything I hoped it would be. I was wary of using fennel in this dish, so I left it out. Next time I'll try it with, and I will use chicken stock to braise the rabe instead of water. No need to add pasta cooking water- -the soupy texture was perfect without.

i love this pasta dish. It has a simple yet delicous combination of flavors. I have made it many times.

I didn't have any experience with broccoli rabe (rapini), so I was a bit shocked with the flavor of the dish when I made it for the first time. (Rapini is a member of the turnip family, btw) I would probably use broccolini instead. No need for pasta water at the end as others have mentioned. Use good quality pancetta for the best flavor.

Made this with mild italian sausage in place of the pancetta, didn't have any pinenuts, and used cavatelli instead of pappardelle. It was delicious. I have made a version of this dish many times and it has never turned out so good. Also, forgot to add in the oil at the end and don't think it was missing a thing.

Quite wonderful combination of seasonings with the fennel and red pepper. I followed the suggestion of braising the broccoli rabe with chicken broth. One of the best pasta dishes I've made in a long time.

This was surprisingly good. I couldn't find pappardelle and used fettucine instead. Also, I left out the fennel seed and used bacon rather than pancetta as others have suggested. Also, I used broccolini as that is what my grocery store stocked. Is that the same as broccoli rabe? It could be a regional naming thing. Also, I used chicken broth to steam the broccolini instead of water---scrumptious! I will definitely do that again next time. This was really a good pasta dish.

Made this recipe exactly as written and it was not worth the work. The good'ol broccoli rabe with olive oil and garlic is by far 100% taster and 1/4 less time!

We loved this and have made it twice. Two things I would change for the next time. 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper was almost negligible. I'd bump that up a bit to be able to taste it, but we like it hot. Also, I'd trim the pancetta of most of the fat, or I'd saute it a couple minutes before the onions & fennel. The fatty portions of the pancetta needed a little more crispiness in my opinion. Also, something we did as a personal preference, we substitutded 1/2 cup of asiago and 1/2 cup of parm reggiano instead of the 1 C pecorino romano, which we think is too salty of a cheese. Also, rapini/broccoli rabe was out and we used aspiration/broccolini. It was AMAZING. One of our favorite new pasta dishes.

This recipe is great. The flavor is amazing. I couldn't find Pappardelle so I used fettucini, but otherwise I follwed the recipe to a T.

This is a tasty and easy pasta. It is great with broccoli rabe but I subbed broccoli once in a pinch and that was good too. I tried both pancetta and bacon and thought the regular (and cheaper) bacon was just as good.

Rating: 3
Despite the fact that this took several pots to make, it was still very simple and very good. I deleted the cheese, since pancetta more than made up for fat, and it was still excellent. The only thing I would do differently next time is to not remove the garlic. I will saute the garlic near the end of the saute time of the onion and pancetta. I didn't notice any garlic flavoring from prepping the oil with the garlic. Very good and very easy.

This is a terrific recipe. As another reviewer suggested, I blanched the broccoli rabe first. I also eliminated the cup of water.

This dish won rave reviews from my friends and it was so easy to make, made a few substitutions. I doubled the amount of pancetta, couldn't find any rapini so I used artichokes instead and didn't add the full amount of water. I also added extra garlic. Was delicious!!!

Yum! A great hot weather dinner, and easy to make. The pancetta and rapini contrast nicely, and the fennel seeds are a nice touch. Next time I'll use more rapini (I halved the recipe and used half a bunch -- all of it would've been perfect!)

We LOVED this, although I did make a few changes. First, I used thick cut bacon which I cut into strips and fried with the onion, not adding any oil. When the bacon was cooked to our liking (the bottom of the pan was brown but this was ok) I chopped the garlic and added the garlic and the fennel together so the garlic wont burn. I didn't add red pepper flakes since my hubby wouldn't like it. I blanched the rapini for about 3 minutes first to rid it of some of its bitterness and just ran my knife through it a few times cutting it into bite sized pieces. I added all the rapini at the same time, gave it a good stir and then added the water and scraped the brown stuff from the pan. I covered it while the fettuccini cooked then tossed everything together. Rather than using the cooking liquid tho, I drizzeled over some very good olive oil, added the cheese, toosed and served. Soooooo good.

Almost doubled the pancetta (we're unabashed carnivores) and found a few shortcuts - but still thought the dish was great. Will be a sure keeper for us!

This was fantastic. The factors that made it work for me were 1) The intense flavor of the oil once the garlic is removed 2) the crisp pancetta and 3) I removed the onions and pancetta from the pan before cooking the brocollini. I could not bear to forfeit the nice crisp onions and pancetta to a cup of water. Once the broc was done I added the onions and pancetta back to the pan and continued from there. Amazingly flavorful with few ingredients.

this is awesome, even with a few subs of necessity. had to use prosciutto and fresh fettucine because that's what the store had. one tip: you'll need all the cooking water. i added only about half and had to put the rest into the bowls because it was too dry.

A few changes. No fennel for our family. Procuitto instead of pancetta. Saute the onion with the garlic and blanch the broccoli rabe in the pasta water to avoid adding the 1 cup of water to the pan. Excellent flavor and I will make this anytime!!!

Rating: 3
Overall, very good. And I would make it again. However, did I miss a step or two? First you brown garlic in 2 TBS of oil, then you saute pancetta, which releases a lot of oil. Then you add 1 cup of water?! I drained most of the oil 'cause I couldn't imagine the splatter. Second, after you saute the rabe you add pasta cooking water? Since the pan is covered, there is already water leftover from steaming the rabe. Third, you add more oil (2 TBS) to the finished product? Isn't there enough oil in this thing? What did I miss?

Yum! This was surprisingly good given the ingredients are fairly ordinary. The combination was really terrific! Maybe it's the fennel seeds. Will make it again soon.
