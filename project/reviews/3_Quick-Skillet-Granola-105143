I gave the recipe 3 forks for its "as is" condition. However, by tweaking it slightly it could easily be 4 forks. I used 1 tbsp butter, added about 1/4 tsp cinnamon (mixed into the oats), and used slivered almonds instead of sesame seeds (that's what I had on hand). The end product was delicious!!! And my family asks for it all the time!

This might not be the MOST delicious granola ever but for the amount of time it takes to make it, it's pretty good.

very disappointing--heavy and greasy

Yummy but really buttery and a little oily. I love the sesame as a salty counterpart to the sweetness of the honey, but I felt like there was a brick in my stomach afterwards. I have another recipe that uses a brown sugar/water solution to bind the oats and nuts instead of all that butter; it's lighter and I prefer it by far.

Excellent. Delicious. no reason to make granola any other way.

gave away jars of it for christmas and got many compliments since i added sunflower seeds for the sesame, flaked coconut, slivered almonds and raisins at the end. the fragrance throughout the house was enough to get me to make myself a serving! it's too yummy to be this easy

Quick and easy. I added coconut, a little wheat germ, and of course, raisins!

I've made this twice, have gotten glowing reports from my man who is a big granola fan. I substituted walnuts for sesame seeds and added craisins. Super yummy! It's a quick and almost effortless fix for granola in a hurry.
