Excellent recipe & results. Made it with quince jam in an attempt to recreate a "membrillo crostata" I had in Argentina. Made it with whole wheat pastry flour & quince jam. Took it to aolstice tango party. People raved about it. I liked it better than any of the membrillo crostata's I had in Argentina.

This was really great. I made it for a friend that had lived in Italy and he thought it was just like what he remembered. I used good-quality jam, which is necessary for a recipe like this. It is a simple dessert, as are most Italian desserts, but the flavor is great. I struggled to get the crust rolled out--it is a bit tough. But the results were great and the crust was nice and dense as it should be.

Well, I do love apricots, but this particular recipe I do say was horrible. I know most people said this was good, but I guess you just have to have a BIG craving!!

This was a very easy and lovely dessert. It was a bit sweet for our taste so I added 6-8 dried, finely chopped appricots (simmered in water for a few minutes to soften) to the jam. It intensified the flavor and cuts down a bit on the sweetnes. Have made it several times.

We used our home made jam. The result was great, as good as you will get from the best Italian bakeries. Keeps well. Will try with other jams as well. Fun to make.

I give this recipe 4 forks with the proviso that you chill the dough again after rolling it and peeling off the first piece of waxed paper. I couldn't peel the second piece of waxed paper off otherwise. And yes, I modified it a little. Omitted the lemon from the crust and used ground coriander instead. My experience is that nothing marries better with apricot than coriander. Also did not add the lemon to the filling as I used a homemade apricot freezer jam that already tart. Result: fantastic taste and appearance. (If you want to do freezer jam yourself, I recommend SureJel liquid pectin. Follow package instructions.)

i would use solo pie filling for this recipe because it is the best filling on the market and if you cant get it you can probly find it on a web site i use this filling for many other types of deserts.and it is exceltnt

This dish was decent. When it comes down to it though, the filling is pretty much just jam. Perhaps the other two reviewers fared better with their substitutions (peach jam in one and almond paste in the other). Next time, I would try an altogether different filling.. some fruit and jam combo with this delicious crust.

I made this for my Bunco group. They had a choice of this dessert, or a purchased Tiramisu, and this was everyone's first choice. Added a little more grated lemon into the dough, and used homemade peach jam. Didn't have a 9" fluted pan, but made it fit into a larger spring form pan, and it worked just fine!

Quick and attractive dessert. I did not have almond extract, so I spread a thin layer of almond paste under the apricot preserve mixture. It was delicious!

This was extraordinarily good and easy to make!
