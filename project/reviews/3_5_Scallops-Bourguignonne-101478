I've always favored James Beard's recipes. This is no exception. Served two per scallop shell as a first course. A perfect recipe. Toasted bread crumbs would be nice as previously mentioned.

This was pretty good. I agree with the reviewer who said it needs more flavor. I would certainly try it again but with more garlic and salt and probably with some breadcrumbs on top as well. I served this with pasta.

This was very tasty as is, but could be 4 forks with a tad more flavor. I recommend seasoning the scallops with white and black fresh ground pepper for a couple of minutes ahead of time. Also, black sesame seeds would taste and look fabulous with this elegant looking dish. We served them in small ramekins asa first course before a fancy 4-course meal.

I was introduced to this wonderful delight at a Wine Connection party last night. The Scallops were served with Kunde Merlot 2000. What a joy!

I used a little more garlic and served it over a thin pasta as a mian dish. The poaching in red wine gives the scallops a teriffic flavor.

Have not as yet tried this recipe. Consquently, I am unable to rate it. However, I do intend to try it soon.
