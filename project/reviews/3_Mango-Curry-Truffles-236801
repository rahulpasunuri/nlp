The mango powder is called Amchur or Amchoor in case you are at the Indian grocery looking for it.

I made these as well as many other truffles for Christmas. These came out a little too soft. I would have dipped them in the 8oz of chocolate, but I was running out of time. The taste is very good, but it looses flavor as it sits, which is odd. I think that I will make them again, but I will definately dip them before rolling them next time.

These turned out delicious. Like for other cooks, these didn't set very well - they were quite difficult to roll out and it was necessary for me to coat them in melted chocolate to add a bit more structure to the truffle. I also ended up adding a bit more curry powder and just a hint of cinnamon. The taste of the resulting truffle is just superb. A nice change (or addition!) to the more traditional flavors.

I made these along with dark chocolate and peppermint truffles. These were the least successful. Ithink part of it was due to a less aventuresome crowd. However, next time I think I'd half--even quarter--the amount of curry. I think more mango, would balance the strong curry. I did use fresh mango puree instead of powder, so maybe that would have made a difference? Not a total loss, all in all. I'll probably try again eventually.

I had a problem with the ganache not setting up enough, so they were nearly impossible to roll into truffles. The only thing I did differently was use semisweet rather than bittersweet chocolate. The flavor was pretty good. Since I was making these for a gift and I had used Callebaut chocolate, I couldn't just throw it away, so instead I baked some brownies, then iced them with the ganache and topped them with toasted coconut. They were delicious and I put them in little cupcake liners and they looked so pretty. Anyway, if you have a similar problem when making these, that's one solution.

Fabulous! My first stab at truffles involved these and the balsamic truffles. I couldn't find mango powder, but mild curry worked well. I also added a bit of dried chili-coated mango to the mango puree so there was probably a bit more fire than originally intended, but it worked out beautifully. I entered them in a bakeoff contast at work. And won. I'll definitely make them again -- wonderful presents for adventurous gourmands!

Wonderful recipe. I've made it twice already, once for gifts and the other for Thanksgiving. Definitely puree the the mango well, mine did not shape well because of all the juice, but they were still fantastic. Truffles are so versatile, it's very easy to create your own and it's the perfect gift!
