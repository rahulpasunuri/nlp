Really liked this recipe! Some of the comments offered helpful advice. Preheating the oven at 400 degrees and then bringing it down to 350 was key in keeping the chicken moist(also something my mother did when roasting chicken. Because I had a smaller chicken, I checked it out after 45 minutes to see if the juice ran clear. Sure enough, it only needed a couple of minutes more before it was done. Another recipe recommended cutting half a lemon and some onion and stuffing it in the chicken before roasting to add flavor. That also seemed to add a little something.

This recipe depends a lot on what kind of bird you use. I think the results will differ from being "blah" to being "brilliant". My recommmendation is to choose a bird that will cook well and evenly under a short oven time (about 45 minutes if using convection which keeps it moist) and a breed that has a slightly gamey flavor. We used French free-range birds since these are in abundance at our local market. You could also try adding a 1/4 teaspoon of chili powder to the rub and maybe a pad of butter for basting. Drop the salt down a bit depending on the size of the bird stick a half of the leftover lemon in the cavity and let the spice rub/marinade sink in for an hour before roasting it. We started out at 425 but only for 10 minutes then we dropped the temperature down to 350 until it was done. Winter is a great time of year for root vegetables and this recipe lets the individual flavors of each vegetable stand out on their own: a bite of sweet roasted butternut squash, a bite of bitter turnip, then some beet root, a clove of garlic and a browned potato. We thought this would be enough for a day or two but there was hardly any leftover.

Maybe I did something wrong, but the chicken was kind of bleh... It wasn't bad, but considering there is lemon AND ginger I was expecting some kind of flavor to pop when I dug into the chicken. The vegetables were amazing, and really simple and I would give them 4 forks, but the chicken was slightly bland, and has motivated me to find a better roasted chicken recipe. I wanted to LOVE it, but it just didn't do it for me.

delicious baked chicken! i doubled the ginger and lemon and cut the salt in half. i think that marinating would have made it even better. also started at 425 degrees for 15 min but then moved down to 350 for a really moist bird which took about an hour in my convection oven.

This is our family's favorite chicken recipe. I make it for holidays or any time I have company coming over. The leftovers (if there are any) are also very tasty.

This is my family's favorite roast chicken recipe. I've made it many times and it always comes out tender and delicious.

Very moist bird - a little salty though. Served with rutabaga and carmelized onions from this site instead of stuffing - nice combo.

I substituted the paprika with Indian meat curry powder (for that extra spicyness), sprinkled some oregon over the whole chicken and found that it baked very well. Nice alternative to chicken curry! Was a tad too dry however...need to add some water while baking to prevent the meat from drying up to much.

This was my first try at roasting a whole chicken. I added 1 tsp lemon juice and 2 tsp minced garlic to the olive oil mixture. This recipe is simple and tasty and made the entire house smell great. The chicken was very juicy and falling off of the bones. I would definitely make this again. I recommend adding more roasting time, as this took longer than I thought. (approx 1:45)

This has become one of our all-time favorite chicken recipes: it's fool-proof and tasty, and the ginger-lemon rub infuses the chicken with a wonderful, intriguing flavor. I make it often for company, and it's always a hit.

Smells great... but blah. The roast vegetables were the best part. Where did the taste go? Not into the chicken, certainly.

I made this with a single roaster chicken (sans the veggies) and served it with plain jasmine rice -- wonderful. The pan juices mingle with the rice delightfully. The only alteration I made to the recipe was to add some lemon juice (maybe a Tsp.) along with the rind, and perhaps a bit more ginger. Really good.

Another great, easy to prepare in advance meal for guests. I would highly recommend pairing with the Mashed Potatoes with Celery Root and Mascarpone recipe which is outstanding.

Sublime. I've been a long time BA subscriber and frequently use this website and this has been one of the few recipes in which my husband said -"Wow, make sure you keep this receipe."

This is a great chicken recipe...very light! Good for summer. I was so glad to see Paul migrated from the fried egg sandwich section! His reviews bring tears to my eyes!

This chicken recipe is so good it brought tears to my eyes. I definitely like to spices rubbed over the chicken, not under the skin. For a dinner party I will use Cornish Game hens for an individual dish. I will also braise the veggies in a skillet with dark stock so they don't look better.

This ish was easy to prepare, moist and delicious. I have e mailed it to many of my friends and family- a time saver but nice enough to entertain with a good bottle of wine and a tossed salad!

Instead of the whole chicken, I halved the recipe and added the juice from half a lemon. Then I used that to coat about 3/4 pound of chicken and cooked it on the stove, 3-5 minutes on each side. Served with just roasted new potatoes and broccoli, it was a great (and easy, <30 minutes) dinner. Using fresh ginger was definately key.

Paul, I'd love to try one of your great recipes. Just post it here.

I tried this chicken in my rotisserie. The flavors did not come through as anticipated. I think that rubbing the seasoning under the skin might help. I would be curious to know if anyone else tried this on the rotisserie. Next time, I'll do it in the oven and see if there is a difference.

I loved the chicken & the veggies together. My husband wasn't crazy about it. Said the chicken didn't have enough flavor. I wouldn't make it again because the veggies take forever to prepare - I was chopping for an hour! That's too long for the end result. Now, if someone else made it...! I added white wine to the chicken pot as a tenderizer - nice touch.

I made his dish with chicken breasts and it had exellent flavor and lemony taste. When I tried it with a roasting chicken the skin was chrisp and meat juicy, but the lemony flavor was missing. I will make it again using more lemon peel for some extra zing. I liked the result using the high temperature.

Aight. This wasn't the best Chicken Paul has ever cooked but it wadn't da worst either. No bombs dropped, and no hearts stopped but me and Gina ate it up and got our boots knocked. Yeah! It's all about lemons and love, baby. Spring has sprung. I got out my grill last night and oh boy does Paul have some sweet, sweet recipes for all y'all out there in Epicurious who ain't afraid to live it up and catch a thrill, real chill on a grill. Anyone know how Paul could post something up on this bizweatch? Yo yo yo I oughta here. Peace in the Paulenium.

I am still trying to work out how 9 lbs of chicken (2 x 4 1/2 lb chickens) serves only 6 people?

To the cook from Cherry Hill, NJ, just double click on the "roasted root veggies" and voila--the recipe will appear.

Think there's something missing from the internet version of this recipe.......where's the veggies??

My husband & I loved it! The chicken was so juicy and tender. I didn't find the salt too overpowering. In fact, I used 1 tsp table salt and 1 tsp coarse salt with great results. I also roasted the vegetables in the same pan with the chicken, and basted everything with beer. Beer helps create a crispy skin. Definately will make again.

I loosened the skin on the chicken and rubbed some of the ginger/oil mixture underneath then let it sit for a while before roasting. It was delicious and moist. I will definitely make it again.

I made this dish and invited some friends over. Everyone RAVED about it. The flavors mingled well and the chicken stayed very moist. I served it with a nice Shiraz, which complemented the spices well.

This was very good, but I agree that the salt should be reduced. My family loved it, but I was expecting it to have more of a zing.

This wasn't bad, but I think there are other chicken recipes that are better. The flavors came together well, and the chicken stayed very moist. I would suggest cutting down the salt, tho, at least by a half teaspoon.
