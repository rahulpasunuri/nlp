I've been making this salad since 1999 and it is sooo wonderful. I always get a kick out of reviewers who rate the recipes low even though they substitute the heck out of it...but it's funny that they rate their own efforts so badly. This has a bit of everything in it and, I too, substitute and tweak the life out of it but that is the beauty of a wonderful base recipe to work with.

Great salad, but I suggest that you use the white balsamic vinegar to avoid the greyish color created by the red balsamic vinegar.

So basic and so delicious! Made a double batch of the dressing (used extra-virgin olive oil) and added dressing to leftovers as needed. Made with half smoked mozzarella and half aged provolone. Also threw in some marinated artichoke hearts. THE BEST pasta salad I've ever had.

We love this pasta salad! It's the only one we make now. This is among my husband's favorite dishes - I always have to make a double batch, and he can literally eat all of it. I also use olive oil instead of veg. oil. I made it tonight with smoked fresh mozzerella, and it was fantastic!

I too use the recipe as a starting point adding whatever I want; olives, artichokes, bell peppers. I use olive oil in the dressing. My only complaint is the color the basalmic vinegar adds to the pasta. It adds a slight grayish tint. I have seen white basalmic at Trader Joe's. I will try that next time.

I must tell you that those who ate this recipe instantly became very protective of it. I brought it to a friendly barbecue and my boyfriend purposely avoided talking about it in the hopes that there would be more leftovers for him to eat later. He kept asking where it was on our drive home. An instant hit... But, as others have said, it needs some tweeking: I used multi-colored pasta, along with sherry cooking wine instead of vinegar, a slight amount of unseasoned rice vinegar, olive oil instead of vegetable oil (??? There's pasta here, people! Why wouldn't they have automatically used olive oil in the first place?!), sliced black olives, double the garlic, and a whole shallot. The other difference is that I emulsified the garlic and the shallots, which added the flavor without making the chunks of either overpowering. Next time, I would make a second batch of the dressing to add right before serving, as the pasta does absorb most of the dressing while overnighting in the fridge.

This is very tasty - I got lots of compliments at my last cook-out. I sliced the peperoncini's before adding them and used smoked provolone instead of mozzerella. Will definitely make again.

This was a great pasta salad. My husband, who is typically not a big fan of pasta salad, loved it! I did make some changes--used olive oil, used sundried tomatoes in olive oil and sliced them into strips, used apple cidar vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and adjusted the tartness by adding 1/4 teaspoon of sugar. Substituted black beans and added a diced yellow pepper to give it some color and crunch. Was even better the next day.

Made using Whole-wheat pasta, regular mozzarella. Eliminated: sundried tomato, salami, garbanzo beans. Added: 6 oz artichoke hearts (quartered), 1/2 cup pitted kalmata olives(halved), 1/2 cup sliced black olives, pint cherry tomatoes, 1/2 cup basil. Dressing is fabulous as written! Great way to start the summer.

Instead of using red wine vinegar, I substituded it with Sherry vinegar. It was fantastic!

The recipe as it's listed here is just a starting point. The beauty of a pasta salad is that it's a perfect foil for so many flavor combinations. I used extra virgin olive oil for the dressing and threw in some chopped shallots. Instead of mozzarella, I used a thick-cut slice of provolone from the store deli (much cheaper than smoked mozzarella and pretty tasty.) I also used sun-dried tomatoes packed in olive oil and whole wheat rotini. The whole wheat pasta doesn't taste dramatically different from the regular and it packs in some extra fiber (which we could all use more of!). I also added canned artichokes hearts, kalamata olives and some chopped fresh parsley. What I got was a very tasty, hearty salad perfect for a quick lunch.

Bland, no color, no texture - move on if you're not into major tweaking. Used ALL reviewers suggestions - basil, fresh tomatoes, chopped red and green peppers, black olives, olive oil, sugar, artichoke hearts, parmesan, more dressing, red onion. End result was not this recipe but I had a really great salad. Served with brandied chicken breats and mushrooms.

This is desperate for flavor, texture and crunch. I added almost everything from other reviews: fresh tomatoes, basil, olive oil, parmesan, artichoke hearts, fresh red and green peppers. Salad was excellent, but this recipe alone doesn't cut it.

Great! Make it the day before. I made two servings of the dressing. Also added 1/4 lb soppressata, regular fresh buffalo mozzarella, 1 12 jar of marinated artichokes and 1 cup marinated pitted black olives. Will use for my wedding reception!!!!

By far the best pasta salad I have ever had. I love pasta salad but haven't had much luck making them myself. This was great.

Very good. I like cold pasta salads to bring to work for lunch and this was definitely a keeper. I added kalamata olives as well and did half smoked mozzarella and half bocconcini (fresh mozzarella balls) and those additions were great. I really love the pepperoncini in this dish, which was a surprise. They went really well. And it was good for several lunches...it lasts well!

Good potluck/picnic dish. I followed the recipe exactly then added good Sicilian olives as an afterthought. I will reduce the garlic as one of the other reviewers suggested when I make this again. Even though I used very fresh garlic I found the raw garlic flavor a little too "lasting." Next time I'll cut garlic in half or use garlic powder instead.

This is the best pasta salad recipe I have tried. I have made it twice and have exchanged many of the ingredients for what we had on hand, and it turned out great. The dressing is the staple and then just add any ingredients you happen to enjoy--perfect, and very easy. I'll be making this all summer long.

3 1/2 forks...The dressing is great. I used farfale pasta and added some extra vegetables I had on hand. The second day this was even better. However, I had to add a little olive oil to it because the pasta absorbed some of yesterdays dressing.

Rating: 4
This recipe was delicious! However, I did make a few changes, based on ingredients I had on hand. The dressing recipe is perfect, and the sundried tomates are a must (they really make the dish). I deleted the garbonzos, peperoncini, red pepper flakes, and added artichoke hearts, black olives, and used regular mozzarella instead of smoked. I also used plenty of salt & pepper, and dried parsley instead of fresh. It was a HUGE crowd pleaser!!

I have been using this recipe for years, since I originally was printed and it is always a hit. The best part is you can adapt it to what ever you happen to have when you make it.

I made this salad pretty much "as is" to give it a fair assessment. However, it definitely needs something more... like the other reviewers have suggested. If I made it again, I would add marinated artichoke hearts and black olives. The dressing could use some tweaking as well since it's a bit tart. It is pretty quick and easy to make so I don't know why others say it's a lot of work.

It's a good start for a salad, but I think it's improved with the addition of marinated artichocke hearts, black and green olives, thinly sliced red onions.

I haven't made this recipe, but since the last reviewer was disappointed with it & asked for a suggestion, I just wanted to say that I made the WARM PASTA SALAD WITH ROASTED CORN AND POBLANOS from this site for the last 4th of July & it got rave reviews from all our guests! It's time consuming but delicious!

I made this last year for a 4th of July party and stumble upon it this year while looking for a better one. With as much as it cost to make, you'd expect it to actually taste good. If anyone can recommend a better recipe, I would use it for this year's party!

Made this on easter due to good reviews and was disappointed. Was looking for something to really stand out and this was not it. I found it nothing better than basic deli-purchased fare and lots more work.

This salad was good, but of course I made changes. Nixed the garbanzos, the pepperoncini,and sundried tomatoes. I added instead two small jars of marinated artichoke hearts, a can of drained small black olives, and two fresh tomatoes cut-up. also grated parmesan cheese. Everyone at the party I brought it to enjoyed it.

Quite good. My only complaint is with the sundried tomatoes. Either I didn't rehydrate them correctly, or I just don't care for the product. Also, I used smoked havardi cheese, which worked well.

WOW! This is fantastic. I did alter the recipe a bit though- left out the peperoncini (just personal preference), added a small can of sliced black olives, some pepperoni, and used smoked rambol instead of the mozzarella. Tastes best after sitting in the fridge for a few hours. The only problem is that the garbanzo beans sink to the bottom so you to stir it well before serving.

I have made this pasta salad at least once a month for a year, and it never gets old. My husband, a professed pasta salad hater, LOVES it and requests it constantly! I have made it with farfalle, penne, rotini, fusilli, and plain old macaroni with stellar results every time. The only change I have made is to use provolone for the smoked mozzarella. Highly recommended!

I made this recipe twice for two different parties, was a hit at both of them. I omitted the sun dried tomatoes and used 4 diced roma tomatoes instead. I also omitted the garbanzo beans. I might try an herb a little less subtle than italian parsley next time I make this dish.

Great salad to use up what is in your kitchen! In addition to the recipe I added fresh mozzerella, canned artichokes and chopped up tomatoes. I used medium sized pasta shells and cut up everything about the same size. As far a flavor..the recipe needs a little help. I added some basil and for the dressing. I used a food processor and added the garlic..(left out the mustard), vinegar, and chopped sundried tomatoes for flavor. Slowly I added some really good olive oil to emulsify the whole thing. My hubby LOVED it! He had a hard time waiting for the flavors to blend in the frig. he kept digging into it!

Everyone loved this pasta salad! Easy to make. Added grilled chicken strips to serve as a main dish. Didn't even add the artichoke hearts or roasted peppers as originally planned because it tasted great before adding them. Also used whole wheat pasta. Had lots of flavor. Will make again!

Excellent! Instead of mozzarella, I used smoked Gouda and I added roasted red peppers and sliced olives. I agree that it needed just a little flavor boost; I added salt and pepper to taste, and that's all it needed. Absolutely delicious, and got rave reviews from a BBQ I brought it to.

Extremely intesresting and tasty salad! Could be even more interesting with smoked cheese, I used just feta had I had at home and it worked out just fine! Also I left out dried pepper flakes but garlic and peperoncini gave enough taste anyway. I will definately do it gain!

I've made this several times, and it's always a hit. This last time, though, there was just too much food overall, so I had a lot left over. I tried plating it and heating it for a couple of minutes in the microwave, then sprinkling with shredded parmesan -- voila, a fabulous pasta course!

This was very easy to put together. It really dresses up a table and the guests were very impressed. It was a great complement to a cookout that featured Italian sausages with sauteed peppers and onions. The flavor is not as strong as it seems but even the toddlers found things in it they liked.

I agree with Karen from Irvine... this was pretty boring. I tried to jazz it up as others suggested, with olives, roasted red peppers, and basil, but I think the problem was the dressing, which is too mustardy and tart for me. My husband who usually like everything I make said to pass on this as well.

This salad tastes best if you leave it overnight in the fridge- that's when the smokey flavor of the mozerella soaks into the pasta. Wonderful!
