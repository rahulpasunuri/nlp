I cooked the basmati rice with two cardomom pods and made the lemon zest optional (it gives the dish a refreshing taste but makes it a bit bitter). I served the dish with yogurt--absolutely yummy.

much better without the peanuts. leftovers that were kept in the fridge had a strong lemon aroma and tasted even better the next day.

Cool/cold rice is best used for this recipe. Kick up the flavor by adding chopped fresh cilantro (about 2 tbsp, at the end), chopped green chillis/jalapenos (to taste), asafoteda (along with the mustard seeds, in the beginning, about 1/2 tsp) and5-6 fresh curry leaves. This is a "dry" rice dish, and is meant to be eaten with other "wet" curries/vegetables/pickles or even yogurt and chips!

Great recipe even without the mustard seeds

Mine came out really dry, and not very interesting--either in flavor or appearance.

Very good! There is a typo regarding the peanuts, you are to add 1/4 cup peanuts to rice and use the remainder to garnish. If you love peanuts add more but be careful, too many peanuts will overwhelm the aromatic rice. I"ll make this one often.

This was great. I was a little more generous with the peanuts. Served with pork sirloin chops rubbed with fresh minced ginger, canola oil, and salt and grilled.
