This is really nice with the chopped egg, pretty boring without it, but still decent. It's very fresh tasting, which I like.

Both of the key ingredients are spring vegetables. With this being the peak of summer I wonder why you are unable to find a chilled soup recipe using what's in abundance right now. Cucumbers. Zucchini. Corn. Tomatoes. Melons. Lots of seasonal options.

This is a fairly healthy soup but it was rather bland for my tastes. I wouldn't spend the time to make this again.

I found this soup to be fairly good for something quite healthy. I actually ate it hot (chilled soups just don't usually do it for me) and enjoyed. I will make this again.

I love spinach, and I love watercress, but I'm not sure this is my favorite. It's a bit slimy.

Made last night for an inpromptu dinner get together. Very easy to put together since I had everything on hand except the watercress. Chilled 2 1/2 hours and it thickened considerably. Probably would have needed to thin with additional stock if made earlier in the day or the day before. Substantial taste without a lot of fat. It made a scant quart, so served it in small bowls. Sieved the white and yolk separately through a coarse mesh strainer (thought it would be more attractive than the choopped eggs in photo) and garnished with watercress sprig. A definite hit on a hot summer night!

I decided to be the brave first one to try this (or at least to review it)...This is actually pretty tasty. It's a healthier version of a creamed spinach soup, and is great if you really want soup but it's 88 and humid out. The only changes I made to the recipe were to use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and didn't add any of the garnish (since I was making this for myself).
