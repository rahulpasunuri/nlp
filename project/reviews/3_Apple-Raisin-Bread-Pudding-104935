This turned out very tasty! Husband loved it and I followed the recipe pretty close to the letter except used Splenda and skim milk in place of sugar and whole milk. Kept it in the oven the full 35 min after adding the cinnamon, so overall it took slightly more than an hour (longer than the quick & easy cutoff), but was worth it! Enjoy!

Wonderful recipe that I've made 3x in the past two weeks and got rave reviews. I made a few changes: - used condensed milk (two 12-oz. cans) - used Kings Hawaiian bread and just cut it into 1-inch cubes, which I think really made the biggest difference. I used the entire loaf of bread and it wasn't too much - just have to make sure all pieces are well-coated with the liquid. I also tried it with the Kings Hawaiian honey wheat bread, and while that was good too, you definitely taste the wheat. Just depends on preference. - Used 1/2 to 2/3 cup sugar and that was sweet enough, especially if you're going to top the slices with vanilla bean ice cream!

I had to add more bread- there was too much liquid...I cut the sugar in half and substituted Blueberry Crumble bred. It made a bit hot on New Years. So far I have made it 4 times and have never had leftovers.

Delicious! I wanted a healthier version for breakfast so I used fat-free milk, whole wheat bread, 1-1/2 cups of chopped winesap apples and only 1/3 cup of sugar. I also added more cinnamon (about 1 teaspoon) and 1/2 teaspoon cloves as well. The result was excellent, bursting with rich apple and raisin flavors and a hint of sweetness. Terrific texture, too, very fluffy inside with a slightly crisp crust. This was perfect for a chilly autumn morning. (For dessert I'd soak the raisins in rum and serve it with whipped cream and a drizzle of caramel sauce.)

This is easy to make and tastes okay, but I still prefer my old-fashioned bread pudding recipe without the apples.

This is wonderful, have made it a couple of times now and my son loves it too! I bake it in my convection oven and have found it is done 10 minutes earlier than the recipe says!!

For some reason the recipe is shown twice. Anyway glad I read the reviews and reduced the sugar by half, it is plenty sweet for our tastes. I also added dried cranberries along with golden raisins. This is a keeper....YUM!

Very good and easy to prepare. I made the batter at night and chill overnight. So quick to bake in the morning.
