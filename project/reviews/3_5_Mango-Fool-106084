African mango can be bought in some african food stores.

I served this after a hot Thai meal and found the fool was the perfect compliment to the heat. I added chunks of fresh mango, a dusting of powdered sugar, and a sprig of mint for presentation and got great reviews.

I thought this was a very nice recipe. The mango flavor was very subtle. Next time I'll try adding mango chunks to the fool. Yummy!
