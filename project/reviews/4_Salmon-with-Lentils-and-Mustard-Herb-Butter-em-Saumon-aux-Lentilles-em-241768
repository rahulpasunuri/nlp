Great recipe. Fairly easy without too much prep work.We have made it several times. The only thing we began doing differently - we added two cut up carrots in with the leeks, and increased lemon juice to 1 tbsp. This is now part of my regular recipes and I keep some French green lentils on hand, which I did not do before.

I love this recipe. Instead of sauteeing the salmon in more butter (there's quite enough already!), I sprayed the salmon with olive oil spray and then salted and peppered it as directed. Then I baked it for 18 minutes at 350. It tasted delicious with the buttered lentils - I didn't even top the salmon with more of the herb butter. Too much butter for me! My grocery store was out of fresh chives and tarragon, so I cut the amounts in half and used dried. It worked perfectly well. I would definitely make this again.

This was excellent and easy to do. followed the recipe to the letter using only fresh fish and veggies. Change for next time would be a bit less salt.

This was delicious. Even my husband who doesn't care for salmon ate every bite. I served it with thickly-sliced (1.5") acorn squash that I brushed with butter and seasoned liberally with brown sugar as well as cinnamon, chili powder and salt, then poured a little apple cider vinegar into the pan and roasted in the oven until fork- tender. I put one squash round on each plate, filled it with a generous portion of lentils and then topped with the salmon, adding a pat of the herb butter to each. The sweetness of the squash perfectly complemented the savory lentils and rich salmon. I left the skin on my salmon which got crispy and tasted great. The only negative (not reflected in my overall rating): I only had red lentils and I'm not sure if they were old or what but they fell apart and got mushy way before the stated 20-25 minute cooking time. Still tasted great, but not the texture I'm used to with lentils. Next time I'll try it with green lentils that are hopefully fresher.

So delicious! Made this as a last minute dinner. I didn't have all of the ingredients, but made some substitutions with what I had on hand and it turned out wonderfully! Didn't have frest tarragon, so instead used fresh sage with the chives in the herb butter. Didn't have French lentils, but used the cheap yellow lentils I had on hand. No leeks, but instead carmelized yellow onion and used that with the lentils. So tasty! Will definitely make it again!

I have never prepared salmon in a frying pan before, but, after trying this recipe, I must say-- it's my new favorite! I made this dish exactly as the recipe said, and it is now in the weeknight meal rotation! I served with broccoli for some added color, and a side of cornbread. Great meal!

Really fantastic recipe. Wouldn't change a thing for this dish. The tarragon positively makes it. We're also going to try changing the tarragon to rosemary and use as a steak topping.

I didn't make the lentils but I made the mustard-herb butter and seared the salmon in it before grilling it and topping it with the butter. Everyone loved it! Just don't use too much of the butter! I kept putting more on and it got too rich for me!! VERY yummy!

I have made this recipe many times and my husband and I love it! This last time we served it with pan seared scallops instead of salmon which was the best iteration yet. For the butter we use a total of 8 Tbsps instead of 5 and add extra mustard, lemon juice, and chives. I also add a little thyme. We have made this for dinner parties and will continue to do so. It is definitely become one of our go-to dishes :)

I was a bit disappointed with this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and while both salmon and lentils tasted okay on their own, put together the dish just didn't work for me - I felt the two components did not complement each other well at all. Also, the herb butter was somewhat bland - the addition of extra lemon juice and herbs didn't help much either. I will not be making this dish again.

Rating: 4
Great recipe. The mustard herb butter makes this dish extra fancy and delicious. Followed other comments and added carrots and celery to the lentils while they cooked in broth. Doubled the leeks to get more vegetables in the dish and cooked the salmon in the oven (15 min at 375). Will definitely make again!

Rating: 4
I added extra lemon juice, some mustard and lots of the herbs to season the lentils - super yummy! Made extra butter, rolled it into a log and froze for future use. Followed another reviewer's suggestion and tripled the lentils, then froze the extras so that I could reproduce the dish at a moment's notice. Note that the lentils take longer cooking time if you cook 3 times the amount. Enjoy!

Rating: 3
A great basic recipe to improvise from with what I had on hand. Fresh dill instead of tarragon; green onions instead of leeks; carrots and haricot verts added to the lentils; salmon baked skin side down at 375 for 15 mins. The mustard-herb butter brought it all together-delicious!

Rating: 4
I made this salmon recipe for my husband and four children and everyone loved it. I was a little nervous about the tarragon flavour and because I was cooking for small children, I mixed the remaining herbed butter mixture with 1 c. of panko breadcrumbs and baked it for about 12 minutes in the oven. I couldn't believe it when everyone asked for seconds. I will definitely make it again as it is a healthy meal that is ready in under an hour.

My husband's quote: "I feel like I'm eating in a fancy restaurant." I followed the suggestion about adding carrots to the lentils - great visual appeal as well as a healthy addition. Served alongside a simple salad of spinach and arugula with balsamic dressing and a glass of Merlot. Divine. And so easy!

I like the concept, but found the dish bland. Part of the problem, I think, was the quality of lentil. When I made the dish, it wound up mushier than it ought to have.

I make this dish at least once a month. It is easy and always a hit. Plus, it's healthy (if you're light on the butter). I don't always use all of the ingredients, the leeks aren't completely necessary and I used dried chives and tarragon in the butter.

This recipe is simple and I used it for Christmas last year (32 people). It was a hit. I double the herbs in the butter and used vegetable bouillon instead of water in the lentils. I also doubled the leeks and kept half to sprinkle over the top of the fish after putting on the butter. Beautiful.

Rating: 4
SOOOO GOOD! I never like beans but the lentil in this dish is really good. The lemon juice cuts through the butter and salmon, giving a light, refreshing taste. I used ordinary lentils and they were great. I tripled the lentil recipe, using the whole 1lb bag, then divided it into 3 freezer bags and froze it. For dinner, I just microwave one bag, pan fry 2 pieces of salmon and dinner's ready in 5 min!

YUM - that sums it up. Made as described, except for substituting fresh oregano for the tarragon (didn't have). Results were incredibly delicious!! Served with very simple wilted spinach. I do agree that less butter would be better and will do that next time.

All these rave reviews had me all fired up to finally make a decent salmon. But, after wiping up the remains and cleaning the sink full of dishes, I'm left wondering if either I'm a very bad cook, or if my taste is out of sync with the rest of the world. The lentils with the herb-butter sauce was just so-so and the salmon, cooked in butter, tasted too strong and fishy for both my taste, and my husband's. For me, this meal ranked among the worst I've made. And it is the first Epicurious recipe I've attempted that hasn't turned out well.

Hmmm. Going against the tide here, but I thought this meal fell into "good" category, not great. I am surprised that it is listed under "Best Salmon" recipes. I would list it under "Best Lentil" recipes. The salmon was good but not outstanding or unique. The lentils were quite tasty and I enjoyed them. The mustard-herb butter adds a pleasant flavor to both the lentils and the salmon. I probably will not make this again. Too many other recipes to try and this one does not make it into the recipe box.

This dish is just outrageous. Filthy good. There are no words. Make SURE you are using french or du puy lentils-- very different from American red or yellow lentils, which will go all soggy and not have the flavors at all-- I'm looking at you, reviewers who rated this sinfully good masterpiece 1 fork! The lentils are very similar to the lentils served in Paris as salade aux lentilles... SO GOOD.

This was an amazing recipe. I served this at my most recent dinner party and had rave reviews. My boyfriend even said this was the best dish I have ever made!

This was very good. I halved the recipe and subsituted gr onions for the leeks. I didn't serve the salmon with a pat of herb butter -- I think next time I would cook the salmon in the herb butter instead of plain butter. I added a couple of sprigs of thyme to the lentils while cooking. Served with roasted carrots. Goes together quickly. Good for family or for company. Will make again.

Rating: 4
This is so good. I followed the recipe exactly with exception of substituting one bunch of sliced green onions for the leeks. The salmon together with the lentils is simply divine. The mustard- herb butter lends such a depth of flavour to the French lentils and marries beautifully with the sauteed salmon as well. I served this with the Sauteed Swiss Chard with Onion recipe from this site. Even my husband who is not too keen about salmon, let alone lentils, really enjoyed this dish and said he wouldn't mind eating salmon prepared this way anytime!

Rating: 4
I don't usually like mustard nor tarragon in recipes but gave this a try based on the reviews. It was fantastic! My salmon was about 20% larger than the recipe called for so I increased all the ingredients accordingly. Couldn't find the french green lentils so used Umbrian. My chives were flavorless so I used half chives half green onions. I cooked the salmon in a pan on the BBQ because I didn't have a non-stick skillet large enough. Served with grilled asparagus and classic bruschetta. My kids (2 and 5) loved it. My son (2) could not get enough of the lentils. This dish is quick and impressive enough for company but easy enough for weeknight dinners.

Rating: 4
Fantastic recipe that looks and tastes like you spent hours slaving, but in reality is a perfect French dish for every day-- or special occasions, just don't tell anyone you put it together in less than an hour! I made as written except I used large green onions from the garden instead of leeks and I added 6 or 7 small sprigs of thyme and the tarragon stem to the lentils while simmering, which was an inspired and totally French accent. Paired with a strawberry, watercress and goat cheese salad, balsamic dressing and a fabulous rose wine for a perfect Easter dinner!

Often I look through recipes to see what will be easy to make without having to go to the store. Even with multiple substitutions, jarred lemon juice, dried herbs instead of fresh, smooth mustard instead of grainy, and onions instead of leeks, the recipe came out great and with very little dirty dishes. So good I will use this as a base for other meats and vegetables that I can prepare easily.

Rating: 4
The only change I made was to use steaks instead of filets and they were lovely. This dish is oh so savory. Be sure to use as much salt, pepper and lemon juice in the leek/lentil mixture as called for. I initially thought that would be a great place to cut back some but whoa, kinda plain without, kinda lip smacking with. As usual, the French cooking wins the day.

Simply wonderful. The only thing I tweaked was a splash of red wine vinegar to the lentils at the end of punch up the flavor a bit. Other than that, I found this dish near perfect and have made it twice in the past week! I paired with a California Chardonnay, which I think played well off the butter and mustard. I may try to substitute the leek with green garlic when green garlic is in season -- just to experiment.

Easy and tasty! Cut back on butter- Used olive oil to saute shallots (sub for leeks). For the salmon, I rubbed both sides with olive oil and seasoned with salt and pepper. Then placed the salmon in a hot saute pan and cooked for 2 minutes. Turned the fillets over spread about a teaspoon of mustard herb butter on top and placed the pan in 400 oven for 5 to 7 minutes until the salmon was cooked.

Ok, I have made this recipe at least 4 times with great results. This time I changed it up a bit. I made a chiffonade of Brussels Sprouts (4 cups) and stir-fried/steamed them with the fried leeks (added 1/2 cup broth) and tossed with mustard sauce (no extra lemon). Served under the salmon - very yummy variation. Even my 17 year old likes it!

I estimated all of the proportions because I didn't have any measuring cups or spoons (new apartment). It still came out really well -- looked very impressive and tasted great. It was a bit stressful to make the first time, because so much is happening simultaneously. Now that I know how it works though, I think it will be a lot easier. Also, not so healthy -- it uses a TON of butter. However, overall a success and I will make again. I also skipped the tarragon.

OMG - so delicious. Definitely a nice treat with a good White Burgundy. I might be in french heaven. Next time I will chop the leeks instead of making the traditional "strips". And I will figure out how to reduce the fat overall.

What an excellent and tasty recipe! My only problem with it is the vast amount of butter called for. So I made some changes: I used 2T of butter in the mustard-herb butter but kept the original amounts of the mustard, herbs and lemon juice, which not only cut the cholesterol, but also made the flavors more concentrated. When I added it to the lentils, I used half of what I made. Additionally, I sauted the leeks and salmon in olive oil with just a smidge of butter for taste. I topped each salmon with about a teaspoon of the mustard-herb butter and then added frizzled leeks as a finishing touch. My boyfriend loved it! The dish still tasted buttery, but it was a lot more healthful.

This is probably the fifth time I've made this and I love it more each time...did I mention I'm really picky? I steam the salmon, and add a small amount of shallot to the butter . This is easy and absolutely wonderful. This is better than many of the salmon recipes we made in culinary school, but perfect for the home chef. If you want something special, look no further!

ehhhh--i find it hard to believe this recipe is one of the highest rated on epicurious. it was good but pretty bland. i liked the preparation recommendations (the salmon was cooked perfectly!) but i would double the herbs and mustard (and lemon, to taste) in the butter to give this dish a little more pizazz...

This is good but I won't make it again due to the amount of butter required. Also, I don't know if the lentil/leek part really went with the salmon other than the fact the butter mixture was in/on both parts.

I tried this recipe after having a similar dish at a pricey french restaurant. It was actually really easy to make at home - and it was a great choice for entertaining. The lentils do their thing and the rest of the dish comes together quite quickly once you get to the point where you are ready to throw the salmon into a pan. The mustard herb butter is delicious and could be a great addition to a number of types of fish.

This was so good - I made it last night for the friends I am staying with and everyone went crazy. I will definitely be making this regularly. I didn't use tarragon because I didn't have any and didn't notice. The one thing I noticed were that the lentild were pretty soft - they were good but I have to cook off a lot of the extra 1/2 c of liquid they tell you to put in. I also don't know if you need so much butter in the mustard sauce. I might half the butter in it, especially the part that goes on the salmon.

This is a really great, easy and healthy recipe that I will make again and again. I couldn't find the green lentils so I used red, and didn't use the tarragon because I don't like it and didn't have any. But it was still wonderful.

I used split peas and was very careful not to overcook. They worked great. I also used dry herbs since it wasn't specified and that worked too. I like that the recipe gave amounts of salt and pepper at each stage. I lightened up on the salt by about 25% and it was still plenty salty. As the other reviewers noted, this does taste like restaurant food!

This is one of my favorite go-to salmon dishes. It's quick to prepare, can easily be adjusted to feed a dinner party, and even tastes good leftover. My only recommendation would be to add a splash of white wine and maybe another Tbsp of grainy mustard at the point where you combine the lentils/leeks. Probably not critical, but adds another pop of flavor. (I also think the leeks look prettier as thinly sliced rounds, but that's a personal preference.) All in all, one of my favorite dishes from the site.

I made this a few months ago, and the flavors were fantastic. When I made the fish, it came out a little overcooked. The only thing I want to try next time is to steam the fish to cook it through.

I made this dish tonight for the family and it was a big hit. I served it with white rice, with a little chopped taragon and lemon juice. I added a teaspoon extra lemon juice to the butter. I think next time I make it, I'll chop the leaks differently, but other than that, it was delicious. The earthiness of the leaks plays well with the tart of the lemon, and the crispness you get from the taragon. Definitely something I'd do again.

For those who like mustard tarragon sauces, this is wonderful. There is a decidedly French appeal to this dish. It's mild when prepared according to the directions. Personally, as mentioned by others, I preferred to add more mustard and lemon, and even a little sriracha sauce around the lentils after serving. It makes a pretty presentation and allows the diner to put as much hot sauce on as he or she likes. It also worked well to grill the salmon.

Lentils are delicious and couldn't be easier! I made this with what I had on hand: subbed sherry for lemon juice, 1 onion for the leeks, and dried tarragon (halved amount) for fresh tarragon.

Made this last night because I had some lentils (red, not green) to use up -- Yum! I roasted the salmon and added lemon zest to the butter. I used a heavy hand with the mustard and lemon juice.

Lovely recipe! Like another reviewer I was pleasantly surprised, it was much easier to make than it looked on paper. I LOVE the leeks/lentils and this was a wonderful, unique way to use ingredients I don't play with nearly enough. I will try baking the salmon as another reviewer suggested, and will increase the compound butter. Every individual flavor stood out so well in this dish. Wonderful weeknight meal!

Excellent! Served over a bed of fresh, steamed spinach. Very healthy, fast and tasty!

I just loved this recipe.I couldn't find green lentils so I used ordinairy brown lentils and it was great. I'm very fond of mustard so added about a tablespoon instead of the 2 teaspoons in the recipe.

The mustard-herb butter makes this dish. I took other reviewers advice and increased the amount of mustard and lemon juice to taste. I also baked the salmon instead of sauteing. The whole thing was very easy to make and wonderfully delicious.

This is a wonderful recipe. I've made it twice in the past week, once for company. It has a delicate flavor that lets a great piece of fish stand out. I'd love to make this with King Salmon. I made this with roasted cauliflower. YUM.

This dish was very disappointing. The lentils were extremely bland and the mustard butter on the salmon was not very tasty. Many better ways to cook both salmon and lentils!

VERY nice and much easier than it sounded when first reading the recipe. My son (11) even loved this, because the lentils were flavorful, but mild and the salmon was nice and crusty and not too "fishy". This is a really nice one. Perfect for a special occasion or when you really want to impress!

Excellent dish. Served this for my book-group last week and the lentils in particular got rave reviews. I did not make the mustard-herb butter (no time); but I did add the tarragon to the sauted lentils to give it that nice flavor. And lentils without bacon, gotta have bacon, so I added some crumbled bacon at the end -- really made the lentils stand-alone. I just seasoned the fish with salt and pepper and brushed with a little butter and broiled it. It was fine. Might have been better jazzed up a bit more, but honestly with the lentils, it did not need it. I recommend this recipe highly, and suggest you try it - salmon,lentil combination is unexpectedly good - just add your own flare to it. Enjoy!

Made as directed, this recipe just didn't do it for either myself or my husband. We both thought it was okay, but nothing great. There are much more flavorful recipes for salmon that do not require so much butter. Lentils were very bland. This dish was just blah -- won't be making again without serious tweaking.

I've made this twice now. The first time around I thought the fish was fantastic but the lentils were a little bland. Second time I added a little bit of pinot grigio & two tbsp of the grainy mustard & I think it made all the difference. I think the additions to the lentils turn it into a four fork recipe for me.

So easy, fast, and delicious. I will definately make this again.

This was fantastic! It seems so easy to be this delicious!

Wonderful! And so easy, even though it tastes like fancy restaurant fare. Just one thing, lentils shouldn't be cooked in salted water. Salt the water once the lentils are cooked (and keep them al dente), otherwise they will take forever to cook.

Need to double the sauce which - by the way - is a good, safe substitute for Bernaise Sauce! (vegan if you use the right margerine)

okay, maybe it was just us, but this meal made my husband and I burp endlessly afterwards, and the taste was not exciting at all. Not worth the effort - I don't even want to give it a fork, sorry.

Wanted to also add that the leeks are really key. They add a terrific texture that we definitely missed the first time I made this with just onion. I used the tarragon this time too and it was excellent. Enjoy!

This is really a terrific recipe, and quite easy. I made the lentils the day before and left them in the liquid as suggested...worked great. The combinations of flavors is really nice. Will definitely make again.

FANTASTIC recipe. Easy, fast, healthyish. Dinner party rated. I made it per recipe.

I was looking for a different way to prepare salmon-- this was fabulous, and it is now my favorite salmon recipe ever. The mustard butter is unbelievably delicious, and my guest was quite impressed. Like others, I used more lemon in the mustard butter, and I served it over Trader Joe's mixed grains, rather than lentils. I also added some shredded orange peel when I sauteed the leeks. I also baked the salmon, as someone else suggested, 425 for 20 minutes. Perfect!

This is a delicious and easy recipe. The lentils and leeks alone are fabulous. I cooked the leeks in a little olive oil and baked the salmon. I think it would be hard to go wrong even with any of the variations suggested by other reviewers. Yummy!

I made this for my book club, eight very smart women who all try to outdo each other with the dinners they prepare for our monthly get togethers. Even the "I can't possibly eat things with butter" people just shut up and gobbled this all down. Wow, wow and wow. I prepared as written with the exception of baking the salmon (at an earlier reviewer's suggestion) at 425 until an internal temperature of 140 or so.

this was really good though would probably do salmon in olive oil next time. lentils were really yummy - my 3 yr old asked for more! will try more lemon next time as recommended by others

I would also either sear in canola oil or bake the salmon next time. This was pretty good, but did need more lemon juice than specified. I might also sprinkle on a few capers next time.

Rating: 4
Really delicious dish- and actually a lot less fuss than the many steps may make it seem. While I agree that canola or olive oil is preferable for the searing (there's a lot of butter going on in this dish), I respectfully disagree with some other reviewers that the salmon is better cooked in an oven- in my view, that's too much cooking for salmon. I seared my fillet in a very hot pan for the bare minimum of time in some canola and it turned out just right. Splendid.

Yum! Great combo of flavors-- the leeks, lentils, subtle mustard flavor, herbs, lemon... light and complex. I agree with previous reviewers, I would probably bake/broil/grill the fish next time to try to make it a little healthier.

Mustard-herb butter is very nice indeed. Lentils with leeks, also turn out very well and frankly make the dish. I used canned lentils so didn't need to do the 25 minute cook-fest for that. The method of preparing the salmon, though, didn't wow me. Instead of slathering the fish in a pan with butter, I instead broiled (skin on - also made it easier) for about 13 minutes. IMHO, a way better way to cook a fish.

My dinner guests were truly "wowed" with this delicious dish. Even I loved it, and I'm my own worst critic. The only thing I would change is the amount of butter, and will either roast or broil the salmon next time.

Very good. Leftover lentils were good the next day. I substituted dill for tarragon and chives with good results.

This is a great "company" dish. I made the lentils as directed and kept them warm, then baked a large slab of salmon at 425 for about 20 minutes, with some of the mustard-herb butter spread on top. My daughter had made the original recipe, sauteeing the salmon, which was fantastic, but baking it made it super-easy for company. I roasted some asparagus for about 12 minutes on a baking sheet while the salmon cooked.

Lovely, light, tasty. I can't wait to make this one again.

I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using some beautiful steelhead trout instead of salmon. This recipe pleased both my fiance, who really loves fish, and myself, I only like fish if it's not too "fishy." The salmon had a lovely crust from being sauteed in the butter, and the butter complimented it well. My fiance loved the lentils as they were, I would've preferred a tiny bit more lemon juice, but otherwise it was divine. Since the meal was so light and healthy (about 547 calories per serving), I also made Butternut Squash with Tangerine and Sage Glaze (also on this site) using acorn squash, the citrus glaze of the squash went beautifully with the salmon and lentils.

This is restaurant quality food. It is not all that time consuming, and well worth the effort. There is a lot of butter, but with four servings it is acceptable given the taste return. Olive oil could be used for the saute protion. Definately will serve again.

Delicious...since I'm living in Cannes now it was a great pleasure to find so many recipes I can use here. The markets are full of beautiful produce. Thank you, Merci

great easy recipe, and the salmon went well with the lemony lentils. i did add about 3 tablespoons (as opposed to 1 tablespoon) of lemon juice to the lentils.

This was absolutely wonderful! It's easy, yet somehow a little different and pleasantly surprising. My box of French Puy lentils said, in French, that one can realize one's fantasies with the lentils in the box. Now I know why. The small firm lentils are a must here, and they are just wonderful with the other flavours. I will keep making this in the future!

Made this last nite for my family and it was a hit! I followed the recipe exactly except that I used dried tarragon because I could not get fresh. The flavors were incredible! Next time I make it (which will be soon) the only other change I'd make is to saute the salmon in olive or canola oil to make it more healthy. With the dollop of mustard- herb butter at the end, it doesn't need the extra butter to saute in.

This is a great recipe, simple and wonderful. It does take a bit of time but if you like the results, it's a great Sunday night dinner. Also, if you like the process of the glaze, there's a great recipe on this web-site for Mahi-mahi glazed with a soy-brown sugar combination which is just terrific. I've used that on salmon as well.
