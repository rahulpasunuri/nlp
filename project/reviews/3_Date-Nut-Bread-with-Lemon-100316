I cut the sugar in half and it was just right. Very flavorful.

I cooked this bread as directed (350 degrees for about 50 minutes) and it came out beautifully. However, it fell apart very easily when you sliced it. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except used chopped walnuts instead of pecans.

This bread is excellent, very moist! I made it for a fair and it was the big hit!

This loaf was too sweet, it took 10 minutes longer to bake than the recipe stated, and we could barely taste the lemon!

I am very sad to report that this recipe did not work for me or my mother. We baked it four times; every time it sank it the middle and burnt on the edges. We tried adjusting baking temperatures, etc. The flavor is terrific; the finished product looks unappealing.

For additional flavor, I added 1 T. of vanilla and 1 t. of rum. For a nice finishing touch, glaze the top lightly with honey.

I made this recipe for family that was visiting so we'd have something easy to snack on for breakfast. I thought this bread filled the bill just perfectly with its moist tender texture and nice balance of flavors. Would definitely make it again.

Tried this, and it's very pleasant. My seven year old loves it! I would add more dates next time, however, and don't know how anyone toasted it (see the comments preceding the recipe), as it's too moist to hold together in a toaster. Perhaps a little less water with the dates, as it would be good toasted with butter or cream cheese. Overall, very easy and quick, and enjoyable.

I teach High School Work and Family Studies in Fairfax County,VA. My students prepared this wonderful,moist bread for a Community Leadership Luncheon. The fresh lemon is a perfect addition to a good standby recipe. The adult guests and my high school students thought the bread was delicious.
