Actually, I used the filling sans bananas to make a custard filling for a birthday cake...it is so yummy. So my 4-fork rating is actually for the custard alone. haven't tried the whole thing but promise to soon.

I found this online, didn't pay attention to low fat. I decided no weird texture in Boston Cream Pie so I mashed the banana into the custard. Maybe that made the custard better but my cake turned out good, moist, my frosing was too runny, but overall the flavor was really good. Even got compliments from a "meat & potato" guy. Ha!

I made only the custard filling part of the recipe for a banana cake that I made. It was pretty bland on its own but with the banana flavored cake, it turned out pretty tasty. I think with plain vanilla layers it wouldn't have been strong enough.

We made this cake, but changed some of the low-fat items ie/buttermilk, to full fat. Even this did not help the taste. I found it VERY bland, even though we also doubled the custard filling. Would not bother with this one again.

I did'nt realize until I was already half done with it that this was low fat. Well it was OK, not great. I agree the cake was dry and I prefer a fudgier chocolate for the top. I like the addition of the bananas to the cake though. I would make it again if I had guests who were watching their weight.

The recipe seems long but the whole process is actually very simple.

This was from the 'light' cooking issue,so it is not as rich as a regular boston cream pie. The cake was a bit dry and the top cracked when I put on the top layer, so the presentation wasn't as nice as it should have been. The filling was so-so, but much better than other 'diet' fillings. And it is best to serve and eat within a day or two at most (the filling makes the cake mushy). It's worth the effort if you want to cut back on calories, not worth it if you don't.

I liked the idea - but the cake was skimpy and rather bland. The custard filling thickened in the pan, but loosened up when it sat cooling. Perhaps I did something wrong, but it was a disappointement for a lot of work.

It was delicious, good looking and easy to prepare I love the combination of banana with chocolate.

The cake was way too dry and dense, but it looked great

The only part of this recipe that was great was the filling. The cake was on the dry side,and the chocolate glaze was not rich at all. This was diet tasting pretty much all the way. Great idea for those who really have to watch.
