Sinfully delicious! I added two shots of Bailey's Irish Creme to the batter and it turned out great. Maybe I might add a few tablespoons of cocoa powder the next time for a smoother chocolate flavor. Impressive dessert. Freezes well. Wows your guests. It made enough for two cakes. I trimmed the rounds, piped with whipped cream and garnished with fresh raspberries.

My teenage daughters loved this cake so much, they ate the leftovers for breakfast! I served it with raspberry sauce and it was delicious. A little time consuming to make due to the long cooking time, but worth it.

I have made this a few times, always to rave reviews, even without the sorbet. It is a great dessert to make in hot weather- I have a side burner on my bbq grill- I make it outside on the side burner, and don't heat up the kitchen at all. If you like chocolate, this incredibly rich cake is for you.

I found this cake to be a little chalky and not so rich- it was strange- it's very rich but it's not very bold- it's a little boring in fact and it's not nearly as decadent as other chocolate tortes I've had. I know- every recipe has to have someone who doesn't enjoy it much- and I'm that person... It might be better with some type of liqueor??

This is the holy grail of chocolate cake. I've served it to the most discriminating guests and they've asked for seconds, which is a pretty amazing feat due to it's density!! It's similar to a torte. I use a little cognac in the cake and fresh unsweetend whipped cream on top. It's a bit time consuming but it's legendary!

This would be unthinkably rich if it weren't for the sorbet- don't leave it out. And just be sure to constantly check the water level, I had to refill mine four or five times. It was the hit of a small dinner party, but maybe that's because I lied and told everyone that I made the sorbet as well.
