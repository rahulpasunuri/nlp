I made this recipe for Christmas, and the entire family loved it (including my nieces who range in age from 8 - 12)! My sister, who is tough to please, asked me the recipe. You must try it!

Great to make a few days ahead. I increased the recipe to 5 lbs. and added the cream cheese, 1.5 sticks butter melted in the milk and whipped it up. I reheated on Thanksgiving after putting on more butter and paprika as directed. They puffed up in the pan with a nice crisp topping and smooth, tasty taste. My nephew loved them!

I like the "make-ahead" aspect of the recipe, but I thought the cream cheese/sour cream additions made it taste sour. Nice presentation, but not a big hit at our Thanksgiving dinner.

I made these last year for Thanksgiving and they were well received. Note that the serving size is quite small. I made a half recipe and had just enough for five people, no seconds.
