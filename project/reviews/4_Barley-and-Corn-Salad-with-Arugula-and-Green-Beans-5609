Served this with salmon to rave reviews. Added sliced radishes (also gave it great color) and just combined it all into a large bowl. Swapped out fig balsamic vinegar for white wine vinegar in the dressing which made for great flavor. Everyone asked for the recipe!

I didn't bother to separate the beans either, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I wasn't sure if the corn should be cooked first, but I did it. The flavors are so fresh and delicious that even non-bean eaters will eat this salad.

My husband and I love this salad. I no longer bother to keep have the beans seperate - I just cut them all and mix everything together.

Excellent, healthy side dish, very tasty and easy to make. I didn't have arugula but made it anyway as a grain salad. Very well received and good for lunch the next day at room temp. Too much dressing but that was my fault for not using arugula. Only cooked the pearl barley for 20 min and it was nice and al dente.

Our family loves this salad! We substitute the thyme with fresh basil and it's perfect!

I first made this salad for a friend who was recuperating when I was looking for meals and dishes packed with lots of healthy stuff. I loved it so much I've made it several times since, always to rave reviews and requests for the recipe. It is healthy AND delicious and, if there are leftovers, keeps well for a couple of days.

My husband and I both liked this - I added diced (baked) tofu to make it a more substantial main course. At another's suggestion I subbed basil for the thyme. I also mixed in the goat cheese. I used too much arugula, so next time I'll go a bit lighter on that. A nice healthy, summer option and different from the usual fare.

I made it without the arugula for lunch one day...still very nice combination of ingredients. I wonder if I should have used pot barley instead of pearl barley...mine seemed to be cooked long before the 30 minute mark. Looking forward to making it again!

Fantastic recipe. I substitute fresh basil for thyme, found it tastes much better. My family insists I make it for every spring/summer get together.

I made this as a side dish for supper club. Everyone raved! I made it again with grilled portobello mushroom burgers. The guests raved again. Great flavor, great dressing. Great for leftover lunch.

Bad recipe. Bland flavors, overly chewy texture. I tried to improve it by adding grated smoked mozzarella, but I was still disappointed. The best recipe using corn on this website is the Corn, Black Bean, and Jicama salad.

A great, easy way to use all your summer farmer's market finds. Other than cooking the barley, I avoided the stove by cooking the beans and corn in my rice cooker/steamer. It was a great light supper and held up well for lunch the next day, too.

Forgot the arugula but still delicious!

Really enjoyed this salad. The arugula makes it. I cut the ingredients in half, including the dressing, and had plenty for two people, and enough for lunch the same day.

This salad is amazing. I make it exactly as is but instead of barley, I use wheat berries. It's a refreshing salad on a hot summer night.

Easy, quick, and tasty. Good side dish.

I've made this recipe many times over the years, it's a standard in our house. We love all the components, so even late in the summer, without good fresh arugula, another green can be substituted. The salad is also good without the goat cheese. This is a great summer salad.

Good! The flavors and textures are wonderful together: pungent goat cheese, earthy arugula, sweet corn and nutty/chewy barley, crispy green beans. This is a great salad to make for a summer barbeque. I'd definitely make it again.

The presentation of this salad is great, it looks beautiful on the table or buffet. In addition to the presentation what I really liked about this recipe was the texture of the chewy barley combined with the flavor of the corn. So I gave it a 3. I am not a huge green bean fan but if you love green beans you will love this salad!

This is a great salad with beef or lamb. It is very hearty, and the flavors are wonderful. The barley takes longer to cook than 30 min...more like an hr unless you like it kind of crunchy.

My brother-in-law made this recipe at Easter and it was a big hit. I've made it twice this summer for parties and everyone has raved. It's a nice alternative to making a standard potato or pasta salad.

Great make ahead recipe - looks beautiful for a buffet, too. Excellent with beef or fish
