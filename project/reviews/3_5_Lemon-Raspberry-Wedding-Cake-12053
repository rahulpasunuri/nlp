This is one of my favorite go-to wedding cake recipes. Its a relatively light lemon cake. The meringue buttercream is delicous and the fresh raspberries pushes it over the top. Ive made it many times and it never fails to impress.

I am always looking for a great Lemon Cake recipe, as my husband requests one every year for his birthday. This cake was pretty good. I am always searching for a cake that is tart/sweet. I made a chocolate buttercream frosting (again, my husband's request) and fondant to decorate it. It held up well and my husband enjoyed it.

You should check www.smittenkitchen.com for all the details of how to transport the cake. This cake is delicious. I have made it probably ten times over the past 15 years, and it has never disappointed. Personally, I use Martha Stewart's buttercream recipe, as it is a bit more sturdy than this one.

I am making this recipe for my sisters wedding in a few weeks. Does anyone have any advice on how to travel with this? I have never made a wedding cake before, and I'm afraid of destroying it by the time I get there. Or is it best to assemble this on site?

Tasted divine! The whole cake was GONE! The only problem I had was with the frosting. It tasted great,but it wasn't very pipable. I found it to be more of the soft-fluffy variety than the holds-its-shape-when-piped kind. Still delish and made a lovely presentation--as long as you're up for a fluffy looking cake and not a polished, smooth version. Three stars only because of this glitch. Taste was four big stars!

This cake is absolutely delicious. I made it for my own wedding in September of 2004. Everyone loved it. This recipe is a finalist for my son's wedding cake that I will bake this summer.

Made as birthday cake (with adjustments) and it was absolutely divine. The actual cake.baking is simple. The buttercream, somewhat tricky (ie a whole lotta beating and beating. Then maybe some more). I made one batch of batter & halved the buttercream recipe (though made the full recipes for both syrup & lemon curd). Couldn't find eau de vie de framboise -- so sub'd brandy and some raspberry puree(put some thawed berries through sieve) instead. Also, frosted bottom layer, placed frozen berries atop, then covered with top layer that I'd put a layer of buttercream on, too (so raspberries sat surrounded by buttercream - yum!) Incidentally, the frozen berries were absolutely perfect & intact. So perfect , that I decided to *ahem* decorate with them & and some buttercream I placed into a plastic bag (I'd cut a smallish bit out of a corner -- in lieu of proper pastry bag). This latter *decorating part* proved a bit rough -- buttercream would warm up VERY quickly, melt and... I actually had to empty bag, chill it all over again. Beat it all over again... and give it another go. Eventually it came together in a home-y sort of way. I finished the whole thing off by melting a bit of organic white chocolate with some cream, cooling that slightly, placing in another plastic bag with teeny hole & piping additional streaks of white chocolate around berries and down sides of cake. Served with a wicked splash of raspberry coulis (www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Raspberry-Coulis-104664). Had some today right outta the fridge after it sat overnight -- wow! Pure.Fresh.Spring.Decadence.

My niece is getting married this summer and I'm testing several different cakes to find the best tasting one. This isn't it. Yuck. It was incredibly sweet, to the point that I couldn't eat even a tiny slice. I chilled the buttercream frosting in the fridge while I prepared the cakes and waited for them to cool, and in that time the frosting seperated. It was smooth and creamy when it went into the fridge, but it was a mess when it came out. I definately won't be making this cake in the future.

I thought this was a lovely cake, with a fine, light texture and lovely taste. I made it as a birthday cake for a party of 26 people - it was just enough cake for a dessert, so if you are considering having only cake as a dessert, take this into account. The frosting was perfect, not too sweet and just enough lemon flavour. We ditched the fresh raspberries (very expensive here and usually sold in terrible shape) in favour of a lemon curd filling (Made following the lemon curd recipe for the frosting, but using 2 whole eggs to make it thicker) and raspbery coulis on the side. If you are considering going down this route, 3/4 of the frosting recipe will be more than enough. The full recipe JUST fit my kitchenaid as it was, and a great deal was left over. I baked this on a 30+(celcius) day and served it the following day in an airconditioned home - after 3 hours out of the fridge it was a perfect texture. Don't skip the syrup as it really changes the crumb, especially as it spends time in the fridge.

SherrilBarry - I would recommend fresh berries, because I think the frozen ones, even drained, would probably bleed into the cake. That said, I'd take this cake with oozing raspberries over other cakes.

I've made this twice - for my brother's wedding and for my wedding. Though I usually fiddle around with recipes, this one I did as written. This is an absolutely wonderful cake! People who claim not to be cake eaters eat it with joy. Cake eaters go back for seconds. Highly recommend this recipe.

Hard to believe that one more commentary would be useful, but I so appreciated others' suggestions that I thought I would add my own. I wanted to make this entire production for my stepdaughter's wedding party last August. When I realized the cost of the candied flowers, one aspect was simplified. When I read the comments about the raspberries getting moldy ... you see where this is going. I ended up using blueberries just as a decoration and skipped the fruit inside. Everything else I followed to the most minute detail. I was thrilled with the frosting because it made such a great presentation - smooth and shiny - and was SO easy to work with. The cake was delicious, all three tiers of it. Since the day of the party ended up the hottest of the summer, I was really glad I'd followed all the advice. I am rating 3 stars only because I didn't follow the recipe exactly.

I'm making this for a friend's wedding, and at our cake tasting, six people demolished a cake that could have served 16, so I'll consider that to be good. I doubled the lemon zest in the cake, but didn't change anything else. Great recipe! I have a feeling I'll need to make several more batches of batter than statd, though.

Just so you know, I am rating the cake part of the recipe only. I wanted to make a layer cake for a garden club meeting and wanted to use my backyard black raspberries. This cake worked perfectly! The cake was very tasty, full of rich flavor and moist even tho I did not use the lemon syrup. The batter was forgiving, since I did not have milk I used 1/2 c cream and 1/2 c vanilla yogurt. Which is maybe why it turned out so moist. For the layer I used blackberry jam and cream cheese frosting from the MOTHER BERTA'S CARROT CAKE on this site.And finished it with more frosting and real berries. Several people wanted a piece to take home! A great sign! I'll make this again soon!

I used this recipe to make my own wedding cake. Everyone told me I was crazy to do it, until they tasted it on the day of the wedding, when they all raved! This cake is absolutely delicious. The icing is quite difficult and took several trys to get right (make sure to do practice cakes if you want to bake this for a wedding). For the icing, I started adding butter only maybe a minute after the sugar syrup. Waiting the 15 min or so for it to cool did not work out well for me. I usually got away with adding about 7 sticks of butter rather than 10 by beating at a high speed. I also doubled the recipe, so that I did not cut each cake in half to make a tier, but rather stacked a second cake on top for one tier (done this way my tiers were about 5 inches high). I was really impressed at how well the icing held the cake together even when the cake cracked down the middle (I don't think I ever got a 14 inch cake flipped on top without cracking it, but you could never tell!).

I made this recipe last year for my daughter's wedding. The consistency of the cake is almost like a dense cheesecake and with the raspberries it is awesome. I am writing this review because after being frozen for a year, it still is wonderful! The lemon flavor is not there but the consistency of the cake still exists and the raspberry flavor is brilliant!

Really good, although I made many variations, so I won't rate it, but thought I would share. I decided to make all the components (syrup and icing), but make a different cake - the Shubox Coconut cake from this site (with lemon zest added to batter), which is by far the yummiest cake ever! It is harder to work with (more crumbly, but also so much more yummy that wedding cakes similar to this, which can be more about durability than flavor)- so I freeze it somewhat before icing and slcing, so it is easier to work with. Since it is such a moist cake, I only used 1/2 of the syrup. Also, susbsituted raspberry jelly for fresh, because the ones in the store looked nasty and costed 4 bucks a pint to boot. YUM! the overall cake was yummy yummy and quite lemony! The icing was nice and velvety, such decadent flavor and texture.

I made the cake portion without everything else (syrup, icing, etc) as a test run before a wedding. I'm not rating it yet for this reason, but I wanted to pass on the info that the cake is very stiff/dry without the syrup (as a warning for anyone who wants to omit it). On the plus side, the texture is perfect for cutting layers and maneuvering.

I made this cake for my wedding last year. It was so delicious! I made a ton more cake than we needed, but everyone loved it so much there were no leftovers. I loved it because this cake isn't sickeningly sweet, and I tried hard to find something that I could enjoy with everyone else. (I am not fond of sweet things). I stayed up the entire night before my wedding making about ten batches of cake and frosting to cover it- for three tiers. It turned out beautifully.

I saved this recipe for two years and used it at my (second)wedding in 1996. It was heavenly! Our guests raved about it for months. I was so surprised, but so happy to find the recipe on the website! My daughter will be married next June and we will use this recipe again. No prospective host or hostess will be disappointed with this delicious confection.

This was my cake for my October 1, 1994 wedding. I tried explaining the kind of cake I wanted to several bakers and the "samples" they gave me were awful. Then, just in time, this issue of Gourmet arrived in my mailbox. I rushed it to the caterer. Everyone thought the cake was delicious; even the top tier a year later was still good.

Made this cake for my son's June wedding. It was all I could have hoped. I made the layers ahead of time and wrapped and froze them, slicing them in half before freezing. The cake was dense and moist...in fact, my small layers came out a little undercooked in the center, but no problem...one is to be the first anniversary cake, so scooped out the underdone part and filled with little messages and goodies ....and the other was the top of the cake and we scooped it out and dropped in a little vase of flowers. I used the minimum cooking time indicated. Lemon curd is easy to make. Butter cream is a favorite of mine to make, but you definitely need a standing mixer...use the flat paddle....frosting is soft and nice to spread and will set up in the chilling period. The cake both froze and defrosted well; it handled well; it was easy to decorate and didn't "crumb"; and it was delicious. We stuck to the recipe, had several cakes on different stands rather than stacking, and decorated with fresh flowers, using a styrofoam base that I had decorated with pansies preserved in egg white and dusted with sugar.

I made this cake for a baby shower and everyone loved it. There are lots of components to this recipe, but since everything can be made ahead it really didn't seem like such a big deal. However, I am so glad I read previous reviews because it is true that when you are beating the previously frozen or refrigerated buttercream it immediately separates and becomes quite watery with bits of butter in it. Just keep beating it for about 5-10 minutes and it will go back into beautiful buttercream form. Personally, I thought the buttercream was the best part of this recipe. I wasn't as enthusiastic about this cake as was everyone else at the party, but I also don't like raspberries. I do think it would be just delicious with a lemon curd filling substitutiong for the fresh raspberries between the layers. Crystallized pansies and mint leaves on top made it quite beautiful and professional looking.

I made this cake and the buttercream frosting for a friends' 50th birthday party. While it does take time and some skill, it is worth every minute. The result is amazing. Even a close friend of mine who has no interest in cake per se requested it for his birthday a year later. In fact it has now become a yearly 'birthday gift.' Both the cake and the buttercream compliment each other in taste and texture. I always think about substituting other fruit for the raspberries but have yet to follow through on that. They are a pefect accent. JS New York City

I made this as a Bridal Shower Cake for my Sister. It was PHENOMENAL! If you are looking for something easy, this IS NOT the cake. If you are looking for something SPECIAL, and don't mind taking the extra time, THIS IS IT! It's purely delicious and divine. I'll be making this again, and enjoying it HUGE! Thank You. It is worth every moment of the endeavor :)

I made this cake for my own wedding!! LOVED IT! One thing to be careful of...be very careful of raspberries, they mold quickly. And you can decorate it simply, you don't have to get all of the fancy tips and whatnot. I just smoothed the icing and attached sugared pansies and violas...which you can make wayyy ahead of time! they are edible! Or you can simply use fresh flowers (that have not been sprayed with pesticides) and just remove the flowers when cutting.

Delicious Cake. I made it for my mothers birthday, and it was a big hit. My only complaint is that the buttercream is a little difficult to get completely smoothe, because the syrup hardens almost immediately when added to the egg whites. Make sure you beat the egg whites while adding the syrup, and not after. Otherwise, the cake was wonderful, and sooo pretty.

Worth the work, really delicious, especially with the Lemon Meringue Buttercream frosting. It is time consuming to make, but the end result is really beautiful and delicious. The first time I made it, I was a little concerned about the texture of the cake, I thought it was going to be lighter, more delicate, but with everything combined, it really is a wonderful cake. I made it as a birthday cake and as cake for a large function. Rave reviews both times.

i made this cake for my girlfriend's wedding altho i substituted a different buttercream for the original. i wanted something less tempermental. the original just looked like a pain altho it sounded very tasty. i used a plain buttercream with lemon juice in it (with tons of lemon rind for the filling layer). i also made a much larger version with a six-inch, ten-inch and 14-inch for the bottom layer. i ended up making 5 batches of the cake instead of just two. i wouldn't recommend altering the recipe but now that i've done it, i would do it again. lots of trial and error. (i ended up wasting 5 batches!) i used previously frozen raspberries and had a bit of trouble with bleeding juice thru the buttercream but in the end it was a beautiful cake - bride, groom and guests all loved it. i would not recommend skipping the syrup (altho i did leave out the frambois) - the cake wasn't dry without it but it is so much better with it.

I made this as a 12-inch cake (each batch of batter made one good sized layer). I also filled it with raspberries and strawberries. It was gorgeous, and I found everything was easy to work with. I got many compliments. However, I don't think I will make it again. I thought there was just too much butter in the buttercream (and I left out one stick). Also, the lemon flavor was not really all that strong. Finally, the cake was not quite as delicate as many other recipes I have made. It was good and beautiful, but not great. P.S. Kids didn't like it--so take that as good or bad. :>

I made this for Easter dessert and everyone loved it. The cake was very moist (very hard to believe that it is even possible for it to come out dry) and the combination of the lemon and raspberries is fabulous. I garnished with fresh ivy around the base of the cake and fresh tulips on the top. Next time, and there definately will be a next time, I will serve a raspberry puree on the side. Totally worth the work!!!!!

This cake was a huge hit at my daughter's birthday party. The cake was not too dry or dense. I substituted previously frozen berries between the layers and they worked fine. The buttercream frosting can be a bit intimidating to work with but the end result is wonderful. The frostng has the perfect balance of lemon and sweetness and is very fluffy and light. It is very temperature sensitive. It is best defrosted in the fridge if previously frozen. The cake takes time but is well woth it.

I made my most impressive wedding cake using this receipe, for my cousin a couple of summers ago. I did a slight variation in that I alternated the lemon cake with a rich, dense chocolate cake so that each tier was 4 layers. And I omitted the fresh raspberries, which weren't available at the time of the wedding. I did serve a berry sauce made from frozen raspberries, blueberries and strawberries on the side. Made a beautiful plate. I did have a lot of difficulty with the buttercream frosting, but I chalked that up to inexperience. I followed the decorating instuctions exactly as per the magazine using sugared pansies and the compliments were incredible!

I made this for my own wedding; I was delighted and our 60 guests were very impressed. I wasn't able to find fresh raspberries, so I found a quality raspberry preserve and used that prior to applying the frosting. I'm not sure why others found this to be dry, especially with the eau-de- vie syrup. This is a fairly complex recipe, and it's important to follow the recipe pretty faithfully - I'm an experienced baker, and wouldn't have deviated at all on this one. I'd advise anyone freezing the frosting to let it come to room temperature before starting to beat it. I didn't, and it started to break up like bad Hollandaise; once it warmed a little bit more it was fine. Talk about hyperventilation! I'm going to be finding occasions to bake this for again - it was out of this world.

I made a test cake, but the cake itself WAS dry like the reviews said. I will try again using whole milk and a bit more butter. I used the white chocolate frosting I found in another recipe and it was great with the lemon and berries. I have 2 weeks to figure out how to get a moist lemon cake!

I must have done something wrong. The cake I made was not the one I read about in the other comments. The cake itself was rather dry and the buttercream frosting had an "eggy" taste to it; perhaps the custard was not heated to the right temperature. Rather disappointing all in all. But as I said, this could very well be the fault of the chef.

I made a trial cake for our wedding using square pan setup, that serves 30 generously. I use one batch of each of the ingredients. The cake is rather dense to our taste but very moist and tasty. The fresh raspberry surprisingly hold up well between the dense heavy cake layers and the buttercream is the best tasting ever. This is what we choose to do for our wedding, after making several other wedding cakes from the recipes in this site.

I have to admit that I was not the chef on this one, but a satisfied customer. I had a semipro cake baker make this as my wedding cake. I didn't want a tasteless, boring wedding cake that was more style than substance or the typical chocolate or yellow cake you normally get at weddings, so I went looking for something tasty and unusual. This cake fit the bill! The flavor was delicious and different and the cake was moist without being doughy. Be warned, however, that it may be difficult to find enough raspberries unless you make it in season. My cake lady substituted raspberry preserves for the whole raspberries in between the layers of cake.
