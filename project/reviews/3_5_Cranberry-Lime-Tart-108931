Wonderful recipe. Didn't have any leftovers. It was a hit.

I'll admit, I got scared when I noticed the crust shrank! I was horrified that Thanksgiving dessert would not come out! Luckily, everything layered beautifully though the cranberries did spill over slightly. All in all, it was absolutely delicious! I used nutmeg and cinnamon with the cranberries. I would never double the cranberry recipe. It didn't cover the entire tart, but the taste was so sour and yummy doubling the amount would make it WAY too tart. The almond crust was exceptional and was so crumbly; perfect for the smooth flavors. The lime curd was a real wow-er. Everyone loved just eating spoonfuls from the bowl. It is important to note, however, that I also served chocolate crepes with dulce de leche. We did a Southwestern themed Thanksgiving and wanted slightly Mexican-flavored desserts. We had the dulce de leche BEFORE the tart and it was absolutely remarkable. Unfortunately the tart just couldn't stand up to the creaminess of the crepes and dulce de leche. The next night we had the tart first and then the flavors and perfect tartness really shined through. This dessert should be the only one eaten!

ok. I need serious advice. I have tried twice to make this crust and both times the crust shrank to the bottom of the tart pan. I am using a non-stick 9" tart pan (all I could find) and following the instructions to the letter. What in the world am I doing wrong? Does anyone have any advice for me?? Thanks!!

This tart is delicious but tremendously time consuming. I recommend using Key limes to make the curd to reduce the metallic taste that sometimes comes with limes.

I made this for a January dinner party, and it was fabulous. I did make two changes: I used Flo Braker's recipe for lime curd (from her Simple Art of Perfect Baking) because I have always had great success with that curd; also, for some reason my local store had no cranberries, fresh or frozen (I guess they think people only use them at Thanksgiving and Christmas?) so I took another reviewer's suggestion and used blueberries instead. The flavors were wonderful, and I would definitely NOT omit the five-spice (although I was a little leary about it before trying it). One of my guests pronounced this "the best dessert I have ever eaten." -- I think I'll be making it for Easter next week.

This was a hit. A nice different mix of flavors that complimented each other well. Very pretty and easy to make also.

Very delicious and easy! As I was finishing a piece for breakfast this morning I added a bit more of the white chocolate and the flavors were outstanding. I think the creme just needs to be doubled because when I served this last night I could barely taste it. I didn't chill it overnight--just a few hours in the freezer and then 30 minutes in the fridge and it was perfect. Try and leave plenty of time for the curd to set (overnight). It turns out beautifully!

I made this for Christmas dessert this year and my husband and I liked it quite a bit. However, the cranberry topping was a bit runny and if I made this again I would add more corn starch to help it gel up a bit more. Also, I think I'd use a personal spice blend with fresh ground cinnamon, mace, and clove in place of the chinese 5 spice. It was a pretty, festive, and unique dessert.

I have made this dessert for Christmas and Thanksgiving in the past and have received rave results each time. This year I decided to make it for Christmas again. This time, I used Meyer lemon curd instead of lime because I have a Meyer Lemon tree in the backyard full of lemons that I don't know what to do with! I also could not find any cranberries so I opted for frozen raspberries. It turned out beautifully! With the lemon/raspberry combo I did have to make some minor modifications. I used 2 12 oz bags of frozen raspberries, increased sugar to 1 1/4 cups, omitted the honey and the five spice and cooked only until it boiled, so the raspberries wouldn't become mushy. For the curd I just substituted Meyer lemon juice for lime juice. I will definitely be making this again and again, the combination of tastes is amazing!

I thought this dessert was phenomenal! The crust is delicious (I made it with granulated sugar). The curd is fabulously sour. The white chocolate offsets the tartness of the curd and cranberries wonderfully. For the cranberries, I added just a fair amount of cloves and a little cinnamon...provided a nice, festive spice to the tart. All in all, I thought this tart was a delicious, complex, and sophisticated blend of sweet and tart flavors that mingled well. I felt that this was a very special dessert, probably appreciated by those looking for a unique dish with depth. Enjoy!!!

I debated on 3 or 4 forks. I just made this for a dessert competition at work and it won. I received lots of gushing compliments. I made it in a 10" tart pan, I just tore a chunk of the crust off and discarded it before pressing the rest out. I made and baked the crust the day I made the lime curd, just covered with plastic wrap and let it set at room temp. I did use all of the lime curd and all of the berries, not quite all of the white chocolate. My berries never really thickened even though I made sure the cornstarch boiled. Luckily I had the foresight to not add all of the liquid from the berries, as some did ooze toward the edge of the tart. I didn't want to go overboard on the five-spice, added two dashes, but couldn't taste it in the final dessert. Next time I'll add more. I added about 2 teaspons extra sugar and half a teaspoon extra honey to make sure the berries were sweet enough. I loved the balance of flavors, the lime curd is really tart, but goes so well with the white chocolate and cranberries.

Delicious! Don't let all of the various steps scare you off....each of them is easy and quick. I made the recipe exactly as written. The crust does not roll out. If you read the instructions, it says to press the crust into the pan, and that is exactly what works. Use your fingers to spread it out. AS others noted, this is not a very sweet dessert. Rather, it is a sweet-tart dessert. All of the flavors blend beautifully, and I would not omit or add a thing. My guests raved about it! The cranberry topping is so artfully developed, that one of my guests thought it was cherries! And it actually ends up looking exactly like the photo. It's a beautiful and delicious addition to any table. A keeper!

I made the recipe as-is but cut the crust with round cookie-cutters and "stacked" the ingredients for a Christmas party last year as hand-around food. Gorgeous and delicious, rewarding as small bites. I paired it with chocolate truffles to give each dessert contrast and impact. Many recipe requests after.

This recipe is very good. I made it last Sunday for our family Sunday dinner. My husband's grandfather and parents (who do not like cranberries) really liked this. At first, I was afraid that the flavors wouldn't go together, but they are great. It wasn't too sweet but it took the tartness away from the lime and cranberries. I would make this again for the holidays or any occasion that needed an extra dessert. My main problem was that I didn't have a tart pan, so I had to use a pie dish. I think I may have made the crust a little thick, but it tasted so good it didn't really matter that much. Make sure you do chill the pie for several hours after making it, or it will not set and is runny.

I have made this twice now, both times to great reviews. It is tart, but deliciously so. It's even better because it's not a heavy dessert, it's a great lightweight dessert for Xmas time.

I could eat the whole thing by myself. All the flavors came to gather marvelously. Struggled a little with the cranberries. The sauce didn't thicken properly. The smell of the5-spice powder worried me at first but mellowed out with cooking. Also,had a little trouble getting the white chocolate on the crust. Well worth the trouble.

I read all the reviews. I only had the smaller tart pan so i had leftover filling and extra crust. I added a bit more chocolate so it wouldn't be so tart. And for all the negatives, I was pleasantly surprised. It was really quite good and something different than what I usually make. A keeper! Crust delicious.

Whether or not you like this recipe depends on your tolerance for sour/tart foods. We happen to love the tartness of this dessert. The white chocolate wasn't an essential part of the dessert. Next time I make it, I might omit that layer as it really didn't add (or detract) from the dessert. The crust was tasty, if a bit crumbly. Overall, a nice addition to any meal.

Absolutely AMAZING!!!!! I was pressed for time and thus made a few minor shortcuts, after reading previous reviews I will make it exactly the same way again next time. First, DO NOT omit the 5-spice powder ~ it gives the cranberries such a nice extra oomph, and really makes the dessert spectacular. For the crust, I did not toast the almonds and I also did not refrigerate it for an hour. So, I did not have any issues with the crust being too hard or crumbly. Definitely make the crust from scratch, as it is an integral part of the dessert. Other than that, I must say that is was just amazing, the flavors of rich versus tart, creamy versus the zing of lime, WOW!!!! I will make this again and again!

Rating: 2
Cute, but too rich for my taste...the cranberries, the white chocolate cream, and the lime curd don't necessarily compliment each other. I failed to taste the balance between these three major toppings as other cooks promised. If you do decide to make it though, definitely double the ingredients for the cranberry topping. I used a 10" crust and the cranberries were not even close to filling it even after I spread the white chocolate cream and the lime curd. My guests were also slightly disappointed because the name of the dessert promisses something grand and you get an odd mixture of sweetness. I won't make this dessert again.

This is now a family tradition. Everyone argues over the last piece every year so far and I've got a funny feeling it will happen again this year. This recipe is a keeper in my book!

With many of the the others the lime curd overpowered the rest of the dessert. I have attempted this twice, thinking I missed something and because I think it looks beautiful. I too made it for Thanksgiving and was the least appreciated dessert on the buffet. My advice....keep looking.

I followed the recipe word for word and it was wonderful. The amounts of each ingredient were just what what was needed. It was especially easy because I just spent a little time on it each day. Makes 13 people very happy, especially the one who took the left-over piece home for breakfst.

My husband made this for thanksgiving last year and it's a keeper if you like cranberries. I'm hoping hel'll make it for Christmas since he tried a new tart at thanksgiving. Wonderful combination of sweet and tart. It looked so nice on our dessert bar next to my pies. It's just delicious!

A very popular dessert at the Thanksgiving feast. One guest licked his bowl clean. I used a jar of lime curd rather than making it fresh, and used Ghiradelli white chocolate chips to make the white chocolate cream. This was a time consuming recipe, but I thought the end result was worth it. I used the 5-spice powder, and the bowl licker noticed it and commented "I thought it had a kick. That's really nice." I didn't have a problem with the cranberries setting up, and I had enough to cover the top of the tart, so it was beautiful to look at, too. Of the three desserts I made, this was the only one to completely disappear that night.

This was such a hit for this Thanksgiving!! I felt it needed more cranberries it didn't look like the mound in the picture. Everyone loved it, the balance of the white chocolate layer with the tart lime curd was amazing. I would make this for any occasion, well worth the effort.

While it was time-consuming, I had much fun making the tart. I was disappointed, though, by how overwhelmingly sour it tasted and was not balanced by the chocolate. I would double the chocolate layer and add more cranberries in the future. Also, the five spice was overpowering so I would leave it out.

I made this tart for a holiday brunch. It ended up being too rich -- I think it would be better if less sugar were used both in the white chocolate cream and the lemon curd. Otherwise it is too sweet and rich -- the lemon curd overpowers the cranberry flavours. Though it was good, it was time consuming to make and used quite a few ingredients; I don't think I would make it again.

I was pleasantly surprised with this tart. Having read the comments I added a little more sugar to the cranberry topping. Will be making again for New Year's Day.

This was an unbelievable amount of work, but worth it. I brought this to a Thanksgiving dinner, and even those who were a bit wary at first, because it's not your traditional pumpkin or pecan, loved it (including children). Be careful not to overcook the cranberries - the five minutes called for in the recipe yielded berries that were burst and deflated. Watch them carefully, and remove from heat while they're still nice and plump.

I made this for an elegant end to a starchy thanksgiving and it was a hit. I ommitted the chocolate altogether -- without it the flavor was tart and just a little sweet, which countered all the richness beautifully. I did double the cranberries as advised in other reviews and chilled the cranberry topping overnight, it spread really nicely. I am adding this to my Christmas dinner menu, as it is beautiful, delicious and festive.

A few things... I used a 10 inch tart pan and I barely had enough cranberries to cover the top. I'd add in another half bag and wouldn't cook quite as long - my berries lost their shape pretty quickly and didn't look as nice as the photo. I had no problem with the cranberries thickening - it was VERY thick after about 4 hours The dough was so hard I was sure I had done something wrong. I couldn't even roll it out. I had to break off little pieces and then press them into the pan...it worked out great. I barely used half the dough though (and as I mentioned, I had a smaller tart pan. It kept the crust nice and thin. I also added a drop of almond extract to the crust.

I changed this recipe a lot, but it still tasted great! I made a completely different butter pie crust because the one in the recipe sounded very peculiar (ie. freezing it, etc.) and some reviews had mentioned it became quite hard. I also can't buy fresh or frozen cranberries here, so I made it with frozen raspberries. But it turned out great! You definitely need to make this pie at least 2 days ahead so that everything firms up. What I liked is that it was sweet, but not overly heavy. I liked the tartness, but it wasn't overpowering. The Imperial measurements were a nightmare to convert to metric, something that's definitely missing from this website! Otherwise, a good pie. I would love to try it with cranberries next time, if only I could find them here...

This was excellent. I also doubled the cranberries and found that the topping set well. I will definitely make this again!

I made this last year for Christmas Eve - it was rich and delicious. For those of you concerned about the richness, I suggest making these into bite-size mini tarts. That way, it's not so overwhelming, plus it adds beautiful color to a pastry display. I too had trouble making the cranberry topping thicken, nor was it enough to cover the tart - so I doubled the cranberries and it was just perfect. The additional cranberries took the edge of the sauce as well. I would definitely make this again - it is a spectacular looking dessert.

I wasn't crazy about the lime curd so will omit it and double the white chocolate layer next time. Can confirm that this recipe works just fine with a store-bought shortbread crust and garam masala instead of five-spice powder.

What a disappointment after all that work! Maybe blueberries rather than cranberries. I made it for Christmas Eve, and it was just not what I had expected. The crust was too hard, the cranberries too tart, the rest was lost. Lots leftover, and it broke my hert to send it down the garbage disposer on New Year's Eve! Couldn't even talk DH into eating leftovers, and that's a first! Nope. Never again.

The tart was an instance when the whole was not greater than than the sum of its parts. Separately, the elements - and particularly the lime curd - were delicious, but together they fought each other and were overwhelming. The tart was time consuming but fun to make and assemble, and certainly impressive to look at. Make sure you have an appropriate plate/platter that will accommodate its 15" diameter - I had to use a round tray. Overall, the tart was a disappointment; at Christmas dinner it could not compete with the usual pumpkin and pecan pies.

I am one of the few who didn't like this recipe. It was time consuming, but not difficult. the crust was hard and too thick. I didn't like the combination of white chocolate and lime curd and didn't feel the cranberries were a good foil for these flavors. We love cranberries in any form, so thought this would be a winner. I don't think the recipe was faulty, we just didn't like the results.

This desert was excellent--rave reviews from all Christmas guests. I did not achieve the perfect balance between tart and sweet, which may have been a result of my cranberries. Next time, I will double the white chocolate portion to add moe sweet to this very tart, but delicious dessert.

I loved this recipe! Absolutely delicious! The cranberry filling did not reach to the edge of the tart as it did in the picture, but I thought it was even prettier than the picture because you could see the contrast between the lime curd and the and the cranberries.

This tart was a delightful finish to our Christmas dinner. The white chocolate cream balanced the tart lime and cranberries perfectly. I would definitely make this again. A couple of the kids didn't care for it, but those pieces were quickly spoken for by adults looking for seconds. And I had no problem finding an 11" tart pan in the first store I looked in, a smaller tart would not have worked in our house, it was too popular.

i used a 9 inch tart pan, key lime juice and omitted the lime zest. tart was tasty, but i didn't like the 5 spice seasoning - it overpowered the cranberry. i will leave that out the next time that i make it. loved the sweet/sour contrast. this tart had a bevy of flavors that challenged the palate. use this for your most discerning guests.

A very impressive dessert. I didn't think it would come out as nice as the photo, but it did! (that never happens) Yes, the cranberries were tart (they usually are) but the cream and crust balanced it nicely. Everyone loved it. I will file this one away for next year!

Outstanding! I made this for a New Years Eve dinner party and it turned out perfectly. Yes, the cranberry layer is tart, but in combination with the white chocolate cream and the shortbread crust, I thought it was perfect. And it was much easier to put together than I thought it would be -- there are a number of steps, but each one is as simple as can be. I will definitely make this again.

WOW! My 14 year old niece made this as an early "birthday cake" for me. What a spectacular presentation it made! Yes, the cranberry layer is quite tart. I think the lime layer and crust are perfect. She used a 9" springform pan rather than tart pan with removeable bottom. It still looked great although the crust didn't have the high sides shown in the photo (the sides went up about halfway). No matter as it all held its shape beautifully. I would be honored to have someone make this for me again as I know she worked on it over the course of 3 days.

Though I thought this was good, I wouldn't make it again. It was a lot of work and I'm not a big fan of desserts but, I do love lime. I too had the problem with the 11 inch tart pan but, since I already had a 9 inch, I did a little math and found that a 9 inch pan is about 2/3 of an 11 inch pan. It worked out fine to make 2/3 of everything except the chocolate: I made all of that and used 2/3 because it was easier that way. Also, the syrup for the cranberries was very runny and I thought it would make the crust soggy but, it sets up a lot overnight so, that wasn't a problem.

I love tart desserts and this one especially hit the spot after a decadent holiday dinner. I made it exactly as the recipe stated. I found the flavors balanced wonderfully. The almond shortbread crust made sure it wasn't too sweet or too sour and the five spice gave a sophisticated, exotic touch. The only thing I would change next time is more cranberry topping. There wasn't enough to cover the tart completely. Over all delicious.

I am just writing to help out the person who didn't know when to add the lime curd. Here are the instructions again (it's right after white chocolate step): Spread white chocolate cream into crust; freeze 15 minutes. Spoon curd over; spread evenly. Spoon cranberry topping by tablespoonfuls over, then spread carefully to cover completely. Cover and chill overnight. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Keep refrigerated.)

The first bite imparts tart cranberries, creamy lime curd and sweet white chocolate. Even my 7 y.o. was unhappy when it was gone. I'll be making this again soon. I can't imagine this without the lime curd. The recipe calls for the curd just after the white chocolate is "painted" on the crust. It's every bit a beautiful as the cover photo.
