I was nervous to make this recipe because of the mixed reviews. I followed the instructions to a T and it turned out well (no lumps, no cooked eggs, etc). The flavor was good, but it did not set into a mousse- as other say, it's more like a whipped pumpkin dessert. There are many, many other recipes for healthier, lighter mousse type desserts and they are way easier to make and taste about the same. I won't be making this recipe again as I don't think the calories are worth it. Check out the mango yogurt mousse on epicurious. It's awesome!

Wow. Just...wow. A waste of three eggs and a can of pumpkin, etc. And, possibly, a burned-out motor on my mixer. For a bowl full of pumpkin mixed with lumps of sugary egg yolk; knew better than to continue from that point. Just...wow.

This is a terrible recipe. I had to double the gelatin and it was still soft and un-pipable. The flavor was good but I think the pumpkin is too heavy to make it properly light and fluffy. Greatly disappointed!

I have made this with the ginger snaps and without. Both times it was a hit with guests. It's not a low-calorie dessert but it's much better than a traditional pumpkin pie for TG.

I was disappointed with this recipe. It didn't set up very well and the flavor was a little bland. I put it in a spring form pan with a gingersnap crust. It didn't keep it's shape and I ended up spooning it onto the plate. The only thing that redeemed it was the minced crystalized ginger that I put on top. Won't make it again.

This was just ok, didn't have much flavor.

Tasted like pumpkin mixed with cool whip. Not that impressive.

If you like pumpkin pie, you'll really like this. The gingersnaps really make the dessert, as I didn't have enough to go around for all the glasses, and the mousse by itself was still good, but much better with the ginergernaps.

This is not what I would call a mousse - it is more of a whipped cream creation. The flavor was excellent but definitely not a mousse. I followed the directions. I even saved it for the next day to see if it had to chill more - nope, still more of a whipped cream creation than a mousse.

I really liked this, boyfriend did not. He is not the biggest pumpkin fan, though. I used agar flakes rather than gelatin and added in fresh ginger. Was just thinking this would be so super good with the breakfast crepe recipe elsewhere here, and now I see someone else had the same idea:-)

quite delish. Had the lumping problem, (definately not a novice cook) kept whipping in the kitchen aid, scraped it down, lumps gone. Whipped a full pint of heavy cream, folded in not quite the full amount. Oh man! Was this good! I put the mousse in vanilla pumpkin pie spice crepes. Made dessert crepes, added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice with 2 tbsp sugar. The crepes were not too sweet, a perfect foil for the mousse. Made this for a baby shower and got rave reviews.

This was scrumptious! So easy and so much better than mundane pumpkin pie. I had no trouble whatsoever with the eggs curdling and, if you follow the recipe and put the custard over already simmering water, it certainly won't take the fifteen minutes to reach the desired temperature as mentioned by another reviewer, more like five. I made it a day prior to serving it and it was wonderful. I did take the advice of other reviewers and substituted heath bar bits for the crumbled gingersnaps. SWOON!

Wonderful dessert. Served in chocolate bowls, which resulted in a beautiful (and tasty!) presentation. A great thing about this recipe is the mousse does not separate in the refrig so what is left over can be served the next day! A perfect dessert!

Never tried to make mousse before, followed the instructions carefully and pleased with results! Nice change from icky pumpkin pie.

OK,I got it! This is the how I tweaked this rec; I made the pumpkin mixture with the eggs and sugar and spices, beat it well and baked in a corningware for about 45 min on 350º. I let it cool, then beat it again to get it fluffy and folded the whipped cream into it. Tada! Serve it with either the gingersnaps or heathbars or whatever! Guests said it was like biting into autumn heaven. And don't ask why I thought of this rec. in July.

Made this for Christmas Eve and it was delicious. I had no problems with lumps, but, in order to avoid that possibility,would recommend not scraping the bowl much after cooking the eggs as the mixture hardens on the sides of the bowl. I thought this was rather easy for a patient cook -- don't attempt if you're not as cooking egg mixture takes about 15 minutes while constantly wisking. The only thing I would change is maybe cut down the amount of whip cream in the end as I'd rather have more of the delicious pumpkin flavor come through. All in all, very good and will certainly make again.

This was AMAZING!!! I was a little worried about making this after reading some of the bad reviews, but it was totally worth my time! To prevent clumping when you add the pumpkin to the egg mixture, make sure you let the egg mixture cool (very important). The taste and texture were amazing! I used a candy thermometer while whisking, but an intant-read would have made it a lot easier. I will definately make this again!

I just tested this at a dinner party recently, where I had at least a half-dozen desserts--it went in a flash. Kids, adults, everyone scrambled for a spoonful before it was gone. Passed on the gingersnaps and sprinkled the top with chopped Heath bars. Fantastic, and easy easy easy.

A great dessert - very tasty and festive! You can cut the servings in half as this dessert is very rich. Would definitely recommend this dessert for a fall gathering.

I too had a disasterous experience with this recipe. I am so glad I tried it out before the big holiday dinner. The egg mixture took FOREVER to reach 160 degrees. It was golden and smooth when I removed it from the heat but then when I added the pumpkin and spices it glopped up into inedible lumps. No amount of mixing would cure it. The whole thing went into the trash.

What an absolutely horrid dessert! After reading the rave reviews the were posted here, I was excited to try this out BEFORE Thanksgiving, just to be sure that it was a winner. Thank heavens that I did! I followed the instructions to the letter (I am an accomplished cook, not a novice) only to have the yolks turn into lumps when I attempted to beat in the pumpkin puree. What a waste of good ingredients & my time!!! It just goes to show that one cook's dream can be another cook's worst nightmare. I'm sure I can find a way to make pumpkin mousse on my own, in a manner that will not waste my time or disgust my guests.

we have made this dish several times and it never fails to impress guests. It has a very pretty color, light smooth texture and just looks lovely layered in wine goblets. We usually top with fresh whipped cream. Perfect autumnal dessert.

Just finished making this for the big turkey day tomorrow. My daughters and I had great fun making the recipe. Lots of wisking, crushing, beating, folding, etc. The girls loved licking the bowl (and so did I!).

I served the mousse in hollowed out pumpkin shells (cleaned out the pumpkins and refrigerated shells/caps until time to serve.) Piped the mousse in just prior to serving and topped the mousse with crushed Heath Bar candy instead of the gingersnaps. My guests (and husband) gave it a huge thumbs up for flavor (and for presentation)!

My family was totally impressed when I made this dessert for Thanksgiving. It is a great spin-off of pumpkin pie for a traditional holiday meal. They swore they'd never eat regular pumpkin pie again!

This was a very good desert - nice and light after a heavy meal. Next time I would add more cinnamon and ginger. My guests really liked it and were practically licking the glasses clean!

This also makes a wonderful pumpkin mousse pie! I used a homemade graham cracker crust, and chilled well before slicing. Everyone at work loved it!!

I LOVE this recipe. My favorite way to serve it is layered with white chocolate mousse in wine goblets-garnish with whipped cream and a ginger snap. YUM!

This is just so yummy, I could have ate the whole thing at once! I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream and I think it turned out excellent. A little hard to make it but worth it for special occasions!

The presentation was elegant and the ginger snaps a nice spicy foil to the smooth pumpkin. Since it can be made ahead of time in individual dishes, it is very easy to serve at a dinner party!

This mousse was very rich but light. I think it will replace the traditional pumpkin pie at holiday time. Friends loved it!

I didn't bake the gingersnaps for lack of time ( I used storebought) but my guests preferred this to pumpkin pie, very good!
