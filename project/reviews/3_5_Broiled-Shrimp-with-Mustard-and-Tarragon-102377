What is shrimp made of?

Although the shrimp were tender and juicy, they had little flavor. I thought the mustard overpowering.

I made this for the first time for guests. They raved about it! Two changes - my broiler wasn't working so I saute'd the shrimp in a little butter instead then added and boiled the marinade in the skillet and used as a sauce.

My family loved it. I used finely chopped red onions instead of the green onions. It was wonderful

This was delicious and simple. I marinated the shrimp about 45 minutes while I prepared the rest of the meal, and that was plenty of time for them to pick up the mustard tarragon flavor. I served the shrimp with spicy carrot salad and garlic bread, and it was a tasty and easy meal. The leftovers are great cold too.

This recipe is simple and delicious. Guests raved about it! Suggest to cut back just a little on the mustard - and no need to skewer...placing in aluminum pie pan and broiling works perfect. It's one of my favorites - I've been making it since I first saw this featured in Bon Appetite in 1999.

Very tasty, loved the mustard! I used jumbo prawns and that was great! Excellent as a main/side/or appetizer.

Spicy and fun way to serve shrimp as an appetizer. Guests raved about it. BTW - I used all ingredients at the full strength.

Unfortunately too much mustard taste. Suggest keeping in the marinade only a very short time. Epicurious has carried much better shrimp recipes. For the price - this definitely wasn't worth it.

Another winner! Considering ease of preparation and flavor, how could you go wrong. Liked "all" the mustard flavor. Could do on the grill as well as the broiler. We used it as a main course.

We loved this receipe (though I did reduce the amount of mustard). It was delicious, fast and easy. I didn't use skewers, just put the shrimp on a foil-lined baking pan and put it under the broiler. We ate them plain, as an appetizer, but I also think these would be wonderful over pasta, or served chilled atop a salad.

The dish was not as good as I expected after all of the rave reviews. It had an interesting flavor, I'll definitely try it one more time with not so much of the marinade. If you really like dijon mustard you'll probably like this dish more than I did.

Proportions were perfect. Beyond peeling the shrimp, prep time is five minutes max. Delicious!!
