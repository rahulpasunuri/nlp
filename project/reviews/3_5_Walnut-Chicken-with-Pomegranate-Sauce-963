Made this last night for my husband and I. Used fresh squeezed pomegranate juice from out tree and it was amazing. The walnut crusted chicken was so easy to make and the pomegranate sauce was amazing. If you are using bottled pomagranate juice make sure it's not sweetened. Our sauce was lightly sweet with a nice pugent flavor from the fresh pomegranates. My husband absolutely loved it! This is a keeper for sure!

How do you spell ihh? I recently had walnut chicken pomegranate stew at a local restaurant; it was really delicious, so I searched for something similar. This recipe has many flaws; the sauce is watery, the instructions with regard to walnuts and flour are unclear; should the walnuts be processed to a flour-like consistency or left in small pieces? The chicken sauteed in the small amount of butter and oil browned the chicken nicely on one side, but the other side was rather dark on the other side, nearly burning by the time the chicken was actually cooked through. My son left his chicken untouched. The flavors have potential and I will work to find a way to make my own walnut/chicken/pomegranate concoction, but this is not it. Perhaps next time I will just brown the chicken, then add the sauce ingredients, including walnuts, and braise it in the flavorful sauce? Just in case readers are wondering, I usually love (or at least really like) everything I make from epicurious.com. and I usually try to make it as written first time (with very minor changes according to what I have around the house and previous experience), then vary it according to results (I figure the staff at the food mags actually know what they are doing). This was a good start, but not something I would make according to the recipe as written.

I LOVED this recipe. I only made a couple changes. I used buckwheat flour instead of all purpose to make it gluten free, I baked them on a sheet pan instead of frying and then I garnished the dish with fresh pomegranate seeds at the end. None of my breading fell off it was amazingly delicious. Buckwheat does have a natural flavor of maple syrup so maybe that made all the difference but I will make this again and again.

I just made this today... like a few others, I thought it was good but not great. I think some salt in the breading and or egg may have made a difference. As far as the sauce... mine came out great! I think it may just be a matter of allowing it to reduce enough and letting it cool a bit. I think this sauce would be GREAT on some pork tenderloin. I also recommend doubling the recipie... you may want to make sure you have enough or to have some leftover to serve over something else.

This was quite rich and delicious. I served it with the beet and pomegranate salad recipe also from this site.

This recipe is fantastic. Perfect weeknight meal, yet unique enough for company. Don't worry about buying the "special ingredients". I guarantee you'll make this again and again!

I did not do the walnut chicken and will try it next time, but I think this sauce is amazing and will go on many things. I couldn't find Pomegranate molasses, so took a 1/3 cup of the POM juice and reduced it. Ended up a little thin, So I added 2 Tbs. of flour to thicken. Also, end product was a little sweet for my taste, so I paired with a little pickled ginger sauce. With the amendments, this is one of the best sauces I've ever had.

I wanted to like this because I love pomegranates and the reviews are positive. I hesitated, though. I never melt butter on high heat because it burns easily. I couldn't get the walnuts to stay on the chicken, they kept coming off in big chunks and were burned before the meat was done. I used an expensive, heavy non-stick skillet and chopped the walnuts very fine and tried to follow the directions to a "T". No one else has mentioned these problems. Will try again.

Delicious. I first made this recipe years ago and have been craving it ever since. Double the sauce - which is very thin, by the way. I like to reduce it even further than the recipe suggests. We'll try it as a topping & sace for baked fish soon...maybe snapper? I would love a new recipe for saffron rice if anyone has one to share.

Haven't made it, but just wanted to clarify for a previous review that POM Wonderful pomegranate juice (unsweetened, to answer your question) is not the same as pomegranate molasses, which is the juice concentrated to a syrup form. I found pomegranate molasses at the flagship Dean & Deluca in SoHo, NY, a few years back. If it's not still sold there, I'm sure Sahadi's in Brooklyn and online ethnic ingredient purveyors have it.

Pretty good, but not worth the work. Everyone liked it, but no one loved it.

fyi -- pomegranate molassas can be found at middle eastern and persian markets. my local supermarket now carries the juice under the brand name of POM but I don't know if it is natural or has sweeteners added. you can make your own juice (2 pomegranates produces about 1 cup) by putting the seeds in a food processor and then straining the pureed mixture.

I thought this was just okay. I could not find pomengranate molasses so used honey as a previous reviewer suggested. Maybe that ingredient gives the sauce a big kick. The sauce is thin, so definitely reserve some of the flour mixture for thickening. And add some salt to the flour mixture the chicken was a bit bland.

Very good dish, the chicken was moist and the crust was crisp. I used fresh bottled pomegranate juice, but couldnt find pomegranate molasses, so I just used a little more honey. I also whisked in some flour at the very end to thicken up the sauce as it was pretty thin. Served with oven roasted brussels sprouts and red skin mashed potatoes, yum!

The pomegranate sauce was very tasty, however I found the dish to be a bit too rich due to the butter and oil. I will try this again, but next time will skip breading the chicken (sautee it in the sauce instead perhaps?) and follow the recommendation to add the walnut/flour mixture as a thickener. I didn't have any shallots so I used finely chopped onion which worked well and provided a bit of crunch to the sauce.

This dish was amazing. I served it over dill rice (2 c water, 1 c basmati rice, 1 T dried dill weed, 1 T butter, 1 t salt.) It was great! Next time I think I'll double or triple the sauce as it was good with the rice also. I might even try to thicken the sauce a little with some of the flour/walnut mixture.

An amazing dish- easy to make and so delicious! The pomegranate is a great flavor, and the broth and wine give the sauce a complexity, not too fruity!

My husband has made this dish for me several times and it's always wonderful. We use frozen cubes of juice from our pomegranate trees. It took hours just to get an ice-cube tray full of juice, but every time I eat this chicken dish I realize it was worth the effort! The walnuts are a little bitter against the tangy pomegranate sauce, which makes for a nice flavor combo.

Yum - I found myself searching everywhere for pomegranates to make this again. Next year I will freeze some seeds so I can do this year round.

This dish was delicious! My dinner guests were oohing and ahhing for at least an hour. I was worried that the sauce was thin, but the chicken soaked alot of it up when I poured it. Very tasty and colorful with a side of orange squash and sauteed spinach. I also sprinkled a few seeds on the chicken and around the plate. I liked it well enough to freeze some seeds so I can make it again when pomegranates are out of season.

Excellent! Try the chicken on a bed of fresh baby spinach sprinkled with goat cheese. The sauce can also be prepared with fresh pomegranate seeds, simmered in the sauce and then strained before wisking in the butter.

I have made this about four times and everytime my guests have loved it. The chicken is incredibly moist. I use a pomegrante glaze instead of the molasses and juice - and then sprinkle a few pomegrante seeds on top of the chicken. It's a perfect fall dish!
