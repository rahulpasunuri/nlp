Very good and a lovely presentation. I used a rub (from the How to Cook Everything cookbook) to season the pork for a couple hours before cooking and I believe that made it better, which was something other reviewers noted. Perhaps a marinade or brine would even be better. Very easy to make and will make it again.

As usual, I sliced pork tenderloins instead of using chops. Made no other changes. Everyone at my table enjoyed this dish. I served with yellow rice, green beans and buttered cabbage. The cabbage was a poor choice.

It was good. Not outstanding IMHO.

This was excellent! Uses a tenderloin and it was perfect. Very easy to make. Cheated on the salsa. Used store bought then added extra onion to it.

Picked this because it was part of a menu, it was paired with a simple potato dish and alsa wax beans. I made the Green beans with carmalized shallots instead. Overall, it went well. Thought the resrique and salsa worked well together. I didn't do any of the prep work that would have made the final assembly easier, so this was a fairly busy hour putting the three dishes together. But in the end it was very good and I've been eating the lefyover for lunch and they are holding pretty well. I've only been cooking for two weeks, so I'd say this is not that hard to make.

I enjoyed this. It did take a little longer for the vinegar to reduce, but instead of simmering on lower heat, I let it reduce over higher heat, so that helped some. The gastrique was a really nice addition, though the pork itself, since it was not marinated, was a bit flavorless without the gastrique and mango salsa. I loved the salsa, and would up the mint a little next time. If you make the salsa ahead of time, the rest of the cooking is very fast and easy. I also used the salsa with baked salmon and it was a lovely accompanyment.

I just did the 3/4 cup simmered forever. I always find that kind of thing takes longer in the real world than in the recipe.

I'm not sure if the recipe should be 3/4c. red wine vinegar simmered considerably longer than 3 min. or if it should be 1/4 c. simmered for about 3 min (yielding 2 T)....?????

i've made this dish twice now, and both times it was exceptional. i followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using mango chutney as one reviewer recommended. the flavors compliment each other perfectly, and the pork comes out so tender and not overdone. i served this with new potatoes topped with grated gruyere and fresh green beans cooked with onion (and the second time, fresh sugar snap peas.) for dessert, i made chocolate mousse with whipped cream and raspberries (to continue the fruit theme.) delicious.

In the ingredients section the "Mango Salsa" mentioned is a link. Click on that to go to the salsa recipe.

Where are the mangoes listed in this recipe? Did I miss something??

Season whole Pork Tenderloin with sea salt & freshly ground pepper; sear all sides in canola oil in large skillet. Finish baking tenderloin in oven additional 10-12 min. or interal temp. of 150 degrees. Remove from oven; wrap in foil; let sit for 10 min. Slice in medallions for drizzling with blackberry gastrique. Serve with mango salsa on side. Consider serving with roasted potatoes seasoned with snipped rosemary; seasoned with sea salt/pepper. Fresh cooked spinach/yellow onions seasoned with sea salt/pepper. Add raisins (soak in hot water to soften, about 15 min.) and toasted pine nuts. Also add fresh grated nutmeg to the spinach dish. Mixed green salad with grapes, blue cheese, pecans & raspberry Balsamic vinaigrette. My new fav. menu for Christmas Eve. Fresh nutmeg is the key to the spinach dish.

Made this with a pork loin roast. we liked the gastrique, but the mango salsa just didn't seem quite right. I'd use the technique but maybe use an onion marmalade instead and the gastrique on top

i made the gastrique, but used it on pork tenderloin. it was quite good. wasn't out of this world, but i made it for xmas dinner and got many compliments. i placed 3 or 4 fresh blackberries on every plate for a garnish/decoration. however, for my tastes, the gastrique is a little thin for a sauce. would prefer something more substantial. also, i needed something to take the edge of the acidity of the vinegar (can't remember what i used....perhaps juices from the meat?)

To "A Cook" asking for suggestions for complementary sides for this dish: How about a corn bread (I like "blue cornmeal bread" made with yellow cornmeal or "skillet corn bread," both from this website) and simple, lightly salted and buttered snow peas? Shrimp seviche as first course. That's what we are having.

I'm thinking about making this for mother's day dinner. I looked at the ones suggested but the beans and potatoes seemed a little boring and my family won't eat scallops. Does anyone have any suggestions for complimentary sides?

This was an excellent dish and easy to make. Unrealistic though was the instruction to reduce 3/4 cup of vinegar to two tablespoons in 3 minutes at a simmer--takes considerably longer than that. Also, while we only serving four pork loin chops (v. six contemplated in the recipe), we made a full recipe for the gastrique to make sure we had plenty. It was adequate for four, but I'm skeptical that it would have been sufficient for six. Definitely will serve this again.

For an even easier version, substitute mango chutney from the Silver Palate (silverpalate.com). I've shared many recipes over the years, but this one I will keep as best a secret as possible. (There are still a few people who don't search online.) As another reviewer noted, it presents very well for guests. But the flavors are the true stars! It would be hard to match a dish so simple, and yet so "gourmet". And for the person who wrote that she almost passed out from the smell of the vinegar as it reduced...what on earth were you doing with your nose so close to the pot?

Wonderful recipe. Very quick to make. Very colorful. Great flavor. Only comment- took more like 10 minutes to reduce the gastrique. Will definitely make it again.

This was a homerun out of the park. I used thick sliced loin of pork, much like a filet mignon. Superb!

I've made this for years and it's definitely one of my favorites. It's fast and easy, yet elegant. Everyone I've made this for loves it!

This recipe turned out great. I, too, went the pork loin route and loved the results. I had no blackberry preserves, so substituted raspberry preserves and used fresh rasperries. My family loves this recipe!

This is a great dish for company. It looks and tastes very impressive. It is sweet though so make sure to balance it out with your side dishes.

Big dinner party hit! I roasted my pork loin (with pepper rub)so I could be with my guests, not the stove top... 1/2" slices served with the gastrique & mango salsa was JUST right. Took other suggestions (which I endorse)- I added a little corn startch to thicken the gastrique and fresh blackberries make a nice presentation. Lookforward to trying this sauce/salsa with other meats...

Convinced my mother she actually likes mangoes. I made it with pork loin, which worked well. I would suggest reducing the vinegar on the grill instead of in the kitchen, my eyes were burning even with the vent fan.

I made this recipe for our Christmas dinner, when it's summer here in Brazil and mangoes are particularly ripe and full of flavor and aroma. Using fresh blackberries gives extra-points for presentation and the mango salsa makes a terrific salad on its own. I've tried to serve the pork with plain buttered couscous instead of the salsa and it worked beautifully. Great recipe!

This is a really easy simple dish and shows well for entertaining. Very colorful. It has become a "house specialty" in our home with guests begging for the recipe.

Quick and easy, and very impressive. Make sure the vinegar is relatively fresh, as it has a tremendous impact on the flavor of the dish. I used fresh blackberries along with the preserves, and we really enjoyed the results.

Awesome pork dish. I used regular thick cut pork chops, and it all tasted great. Easy enough for mid week dinner,fancy enough for company.

great recipe. we have this quite a bit in the summer. This take 30 minutes make, start to finish. we never use tournedos, just a nice thick pork chop and we grill the pork. sometimes we use cilantro instead of mint in the chutney.

This is a great "company" dish It is easily prepared, and does not take time away from guests. The combination of the blackberry gastrique with the mango salsa is sensational.
