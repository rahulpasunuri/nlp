I have been making this recipe since its first appearance in Gourmet in 1994. The only way I make, is to first grease a small cast iron skillet with oil, preheat that in the oven, and then pour the batter in. It probably bakes more rapidly this way. Don't overbake or it may become too dry. The finished result is a crisp exterior and moist interior. Friends keep asking for the recipe all these years later.

Feeling homesick, I decided to make BBQ in the slow cooker, and wanted cornbread to sop up the juices. Substituted whole cumin for the caraway, and divided the recipe in half. Also used vanilla yogurt for the sour cream, as my fridge was forlornly bare. Very moist, fragrant with cumin (and the truffle salt to which I am addicted), and the perfect foil to my half texas style - half north carolina style BBQ chicken.
