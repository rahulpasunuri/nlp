Tangy and crunchy. Could use some honey in the dressing next time as the other reviewers added.

This was quite good for how healthy it is. Apples aren't in season, so I subbed some canned pineapple, and added a few tablespoons of the juice to the dressing. It was perfectly sweet that way. We're not fond of sunflower seeds, but toasted pepitas were a nice substitute. The dill was a bit much for my taste, so I'll start with 1T dried next time, and add from there. The lightness of this slaw (lack of mayo) makes it particularly refreshing in hot weather.

I LOVE this recipe! And so did my husband and four year old son. I used bagged coleslaw, shredded red cabbage and carrots to save time and I changed the dressing slightly by using 1/2 cup plain yogurt, 1/4 cup mayo, 2 TBSP honey and 2 TBSP apple cider vinegar. This salad is sweet & tangy & crunchy and just plain good!

I added sugar to sweeten the dressing. I thought the salad was okay overall and a bonus that it's low in fat. However, the other people in my household did not agree! I wouldn't make this for guests.

I thought this was so-so the first time I made it, but have made it since with a few modifications that I think make it much better... I use a dressing of 1/2 cup yogurt, 1/4 mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons, honey and juice of one lemon. I use 1/2 of a red cabbage, 3 big carrots, and two apples, the toasted sunflower seeds and raisins... and I omit the green cabbage. I guess it's not really the same recipe at this point, but the ingredients are similar. I like a lot less cabbage and a lot of other goodies. The way I make it, it makes about 8 servings. You are supposed to "chop" the apples, not "shred" them as the reviewer below me did.

Oh this was terrible! The apple turned brown as soon as I shredded them. So to help, I toss them with some lemon juice, but that really didn't end up helping the taste or the looks. I made the mixture the night before than toss in the dressing before serving. The whole thing was too tangy, not sweet at all as I was expecting. The apples turned brown despite my efforts, so bits of brown dotted my slaw. It was not very popular at my picnic, hardly any was touched. I will never make this again.

I,also, will add something to sweeten the dressing next time. It was so easy to make with bagged slaw! I like the non-fat yogurt for the dressing, making this a low fat salad.

This was ok but i like my coleslaw a little sweeter so maybe next time i will add honey like one of the others suggested or maybe some sugar.

All I can say is that my husband loved it, well, he loves all kinds of food and I liked it also, quick to make and goes well alone as a lunch dish or accompaniment with chicken or pork chop.

My family all liked this, except for my son who never liked any kind of cole slaw. It was especially good for a low fat slaw. I made it with a bag of preshredded slaw cabbage, which makes about half of the recipe. I added some honey to the dressing which was a nice addition, I also subbed walnuts for the sunflower seeds just because that was what I had. I will make this again.

We were the envy of picnic companions at a recent Sarah Brightman concert at the Mann Center where our basket contained this scrumptuous slaw, coupled with crab salad sandwiches. Thanks to you, not only did we enjoy it, but forwarded the recipes to friends. This menu will be revisited!!
