Prepared these for Valentine's Dinner for my fiancee. Dinner included a citrusy salad, crusty fresh baguette, and lobster gnocci. My fiancee's first time trying artichokes and he loved it. The sauce is delicious. Used a little less salt, a little more pepper, and served with the warm crusty bread. Delicious.

Took way longer to cook artichokes than recommended, but mine were huge and my pot was probably too small. Tried serving this at a bridal shower, and the artichokes were mostly ignored for more finger-food style snacks out on the buffet, but the next day at lunch I spread the artichokes out on a cookie sheet and broiled them. THEN they disappeared!

This recipe was good, but could have been great. When I make it again I will only add a dash of salt...it was way too salty. I will not cook th artichokes as long, 15 to 20 minutes would have been perfect. Otherwise a good way to have an artichoke.

I had never cooked or eaten artichokes like this! It was excellent, and would make it again!

I found boiling the artichokes to be fantastic. The artichokes were nice and tender in addition to cutting cooking time in half. The sauce was delicous although I will not use so much salt next time. Thank you for the great recipe!

I made these again and they are still the number one artichoke recipe in this family.

Very simple and, please, it's easy to remove the choke and inner bits, especially if you let the artichokes cool (steam to reheat as indicated). Use a smaller amount of parmesan cheese and omit the salt for a more robust flavor. And have some crusty bread on hand for the extra "dressing".

This is now my favorite way to eat artichokes and it's healthier than dipping in butter. We didn't need as much dressing as the recipe calls for but it didn't go to waste!

Made this dish tonight and thought the dressing tasted horrible on the artichoke. It was much better as a dip for crusty french bread. We were glad we had also made the typical butter, garlic and lemon juice dip for the artichoke.

Greasy mess- enough said.

Very interesting flavors, the pepper doesn't dominate, the cheese does. The cheesey taste adds to the delicate flavor of the artichoke.

Wow ... this is the only way my family and friends will now eat artichokes. When I told them how they were done, no one could believe it was so simple. I often spoon all the cheese/oil mixture into the artichoke leaves and serve it as an hors d'oevres ... no dipping required ... everyone raved. Also, I shy away from artichokes for entertaining because they distort the taste of wine, but we found we could drink a crisp white wine with this and didn't notice the wine tasting off.
