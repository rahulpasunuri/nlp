After an adventurous day at the produce market, I found this recipe when trying to use a ripe red papaya. The salsa was quick and easy to prepare. The sweetness of the papaya, the sour from the lime juice, and the bite of the chile worked beautifully together! If you are not familiar with papaya, then this is a great way to get acquainted.

Used this instead of pineapple salsa in the Grilled Pork Chops with Pineapple Salsa. Delicious with any grill meats.

add one more fan to the club (or two, as my husband loved it as well). We were glad we had some more papaya left and made a second batch right after dinner. Even used white onion and loved it.

Simply stated...unbelievable. I just can't get over the flavor in this dish. Follow the recipe and make the dish as often as you can!

This recipe is outstanding. I made it twice in one weekend for two different parties. Everyone raved. The first time I made it I followed the recipe. The second time, I added a little more lime juice and jalapeno. YUMMY! I plan to make it for another party next weekend.

This was really good. I made it as is the first time - very good, but a little sweet. The second time I made it, I increased the lime juice, left out the maple syrup, and doubled the jalepeno. Perfect.
