I love Epicurious because of the user feedback - never make a recipe without it! This has become my fall/winter standard, sometimes with choc chips if I know it will be dessert. Per suggestions I ramp up the spices, and use a can of pumpkin for a double batch. The texture is lovely (pumpkin will do that) and fresh cranberries add a nice tart contrast. Makes great mini-muffins, too.

I joined this site just so I could give this recipe one fork. I tried it twice. Once as a bread, it was raw in the middle, but I figured it's me and I needed to cook it longer. The part I could eat had no flavor so the 2nd time I made it into muffins and tripled the spices. They were dense and tasteless. I don't know what everyone else sees in this recipe, because it's a miss for me.

Rating: 3
The texture was excellent. I use dried cranberries instead of fresh/frozen, and they worked just fine. The reason I only gave 3 forks is that I didn't think the recipe called for enough spice -- it was a little bland. I'll make this again, but I'll probably double what's called for here and add nutmeg.

Mine's in the oven as I type, so I actually haven't tasted it yet. A word about the consistency and sweetness, though: I bought red kuri and sugar pumpkin for a festive display. So I baked and pureed those once I was done with the centerpiece to use for various recipes. The red kuri is much more sweet and deeper in orange color than the actual pumpkin. It's moister, too. I read up on pumpkin and it turns out "pumpkin" may refer to a variety of squashes. So, for those who found this not sweet enough or not moist enough, play with different squashes. Oh, and this time of year I always have homemade applesauce in the fridge, so I swap out part of the oil for applesauce which increases sweetness.

Been making since 07. Bake 12-15 loaves during Christmas season as gifts for neighbors and friends. Requested annually. I follow recipe precisely except I add 1 C chopped toasted walnuts per loaf. Lots of texture which works for us. My loaves test clean at 1:08. A Christmas staple in our household.

I've made this a couple of times now. I double the recipe and freeze a loaf for later - Easy to make and delicious. I've substituted dried cherries for the cranberries and it tastes just as good. I've also placed pecans and cherries on top for a more "posh" look for bake sales and it looks wonderful.

This bread came out so dense, it is almost like pumpkin pie. Did anyone else have this problem? Tastes OK but the texture is really weird.

I was looking for an easy recipe to use up some pumpkin and fresh cranberries and tried this one with wonderful results. It is incredibly easy and looks very nice. I am bringing a loaf to a holiday function and also made another for home. I like it because it is not too sweet and has good texture. If your looking for something straightforward, this is it.

I love a dessert recipe that leaves room for creativity; and this one's the king! (I'm not a baker, as I like to "healthify" every recipe, and that just doesn't work well with desserts.) I made this bread for the first time ever with a few modifications, and it came out perfectly. I used fresh pureed pumpkin, fresh cranberries (a great way to use up both!), some dark molasses in addition to raw sugar, chopped walnuts, and just a spoonful of oil. I didn't have ginger, so used cardamom instead, doubled all the other spices, and also added lemon-orange zest for an exotic twist. It turned out great, and had a very complex flavor. Next time I plan to add some chopped fresh apples to the mix, as I like even more "chunkiness". This bread is nice as a quick breakfast.

Just made this for hubby this morning and he loved it. I did double the spices and chop the cranberries. I used unsweetened cranberry and pomegranate juice instead of water.

A review update... this is ok as written, but improves with some of the changes mentioned. Double spices & increase sugar are key. I am not crazy about the cranberries so I have added chopped dates & pecans, which was nice. I make these as muffins & the texture is very light for pumpkin. They also freeze very well. I think candied ginger & some grated orange zest would be nice additions as well.

I added about a quarter cup of heavy cream to the batter, as I thought the bread came out a little dry the first time I made it. With the heavy cream, it was perfecto!

This recipe was quick, easy, and extra tasty. I love the combination of fresh cranberries with any kind of sweet bread. The first time I baked a similar recipe with fresh cranberries I didn't know I should keep it in the refrigerator. I recommend refrigerating this bread after it has cooled and is wrapped tightly, otherwise it loses it's freshness very quickly.

This bread wasn't bad but, then again, it really wasn't that good. Based on all the reviews, I doubled all the spices and it was still a little bland. If you're trying to use up fresh cranberries, I would recommend instead the Cranberry Coffeecake recipe on this site.

Very nice! I made this to bring to Thanksgiving dinner, where it was very popular. After reading the reviews I modified the recipe by doubling the spices, and adding nutmeg. I also added half a cup of maple syrup to it. I doubled the recipe, and made three small loaves.

Really nice pumpkin bread. I chopped up the cranberries as others suggested, which was a good tip. I also used cloves instead of ginger because I was out of ginger. Added extra spices and baked a little longer then directed. Made 2 loaves at the save time in the oven so that might have been the need for the extra time. Great recipe for anyone who likes pumpkin desserts!

I read the reviews and made this as muffins, but I think I should have read a few more before I made these. I omitted the oil but I didn't have applesauce so I added more pumpkin. I used half wheat flour. I reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup and I added 1.5 cups of chopped pecans. The muffins came out really moist and they taste great, but I would have tripled the spices, they just aren't as "spicy" as I would have liked. I doubled the recipe and it made 12 big muffins (I have the special pans from Williams Sonoma) and one small loaf. The muffins took longer to cook than I expected so make sure to check them with a toothpick.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe twice, and I double it and make 24 muffins. I prefer the muffins because the first time I put half in a loaf pan and the center was a little mushy, and muffins don't take as long. I use melted butter instead of oil. First time I replaced half the flour with whole wheat. Second time I did all white whole wheat flour (which is still whole wheat but has a lighter texture), and substituted chopped apples for the cranberries. I will use all whole wheat in the future. This recipe is pretty flexible--I might try blueberries sometime. I agree it's a good idea to chop the cranberries before adding them in, they are pretty tart and it spreads the flavor around. Overall, made with whole wheat flour, this is quite healthy--muffins are great for a quick breakfast, and they freeze well. Even my weird-about-food father-in-law thought they were excellent (I kept the whole wheat a secret).

This was a great recipe to use left over pumpkin puree and cranberries. Like another reviewer suggested, I substituted the vegetable oil with applesauce and doubled the spices. It turned out perfectly, and the flavor was very pleasing! Next time, I will try using some whole wheat flour.

I followed this recipe exactly, and it was exactly what I was looking for - stays moist when made ahead, solid enough to transport well, but delicate enough to be flavorful and tender. Very pretty fall colors. I served it with cranberry butter at brunch.

As written, this is not a sweet bread. I doubled the spices & added nutmeg. I also added about 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. The texture is good & I loved the big juicy cranberries but they are sour, so I would add maybe 1/3 cup of brown sugar next time & increase the spices even more. I would keep the nuts & maybe add chopped candied ginger or grated orange rind. I think more sugar is key though, & I don't like very sweet baked goods! You could do a lot with this recipe, but it is bland as written.

great, very flexible recipe! i doubled the recipe, used whole cranberry sauce leftover from thanksgiving (cranberries, sugar, water), reduced the sugar to 2/3 c (could've used less), doubled the spices, and omitted the water. it came out moist and yummy. next time will definitely add nuts. great way to use up leftover thanksgiving pumpkin!

Thought this was great. I made a few changes based on other reviews: used 1/2 brown, 1/2 white sugar, replaced spices with 2t pumpkin pie spice (could have added a little more), added chopped pecans. Additionally, I replaced the 1/4 c water with a scant 1/2 c applesauce. Came out moist and delicious. Its still good 4 days later...

Yummy. Used butter instead of oil, full can of pumpkin, chopped the cranberries, doubled the spices, used 1/2 whole wheat flour, used 1/4 cup extra brown sugar, and threw in some apple butter for fun. Seems like a recipe that can accept a lot of improvisation!!!

Made this for 7 years now, and it's always a big hit. I double the spices, substitute 1/2 whole wheat flour for the regular flour, and usually leave out the oil (did so by accident the first time, and realized I didn't need it!). I also usually cut the sugar back to 2/3 C. If nothing else, I highly recommend doubling the spices but otherwise making as is.

Everyone has been requesting it for the holidays--and am glad i found again to give. ps--this freezes well also.

I added more spices as suggested by previous reviewers. I also used melted butter instead of oil (I like the taste of butter better than oil) but increased the amount to 6TB and decreased water to 2TB. Added a little dried buttermilk powder as well. It was excellent, and certainly lower in fat than the other spiced pumpkin bread recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving for a few relatives that do not eat nuts, and it was very good (although not quite comparable to my grandmother's recipe studded with pecans!) I doubled the spices and added 1/4 cup sugar, per the suggestions, and would do both again (I may even triple the spices next time). I made two loaves, halving the cranberries in one and chopping them in a Cuisinart Mini-prep in another, and would recommend chopping them finely unless you love the tartness of cranberries. It is more of a sweet bread than a savory bread, but very nice for the holidays.

This is a delicious bread. I do wish I doubled the spices and cut up the cranberries. But this is a fantastic recipe (mind you I did use my own puree than one from a can).

Easy light & very tasty. I doubled the spices (I grind my own for freshness), used Turbinado sugar, organic pumpkin, left out the cranberries (my kids don't like them in cakes). I only cooked for 45 minutes in a loaf pan and also got a dozen mini muffins from the mix. I'll be making these often.

I found this recipe to be a disappointment. That said, I will try it again if I ever get around to making the bread pudding it is meant for. It lacked flavor on its own.

I liked this recipe because my bread turned out to be very moist and light, unlike other pumpkin bread recipes I have tried were the end results have been "bricks".

I thought this was a very nice recipe of pumpkin bread and would make it again for sure. It is easy, hassel free, moist, and quite delightful. I did change a couple of things. . .1. replaced the water by yogurt (which made it very moist, but still light) 2. sprinkled the top with turbinado sugar and chopped pecans. The bigger crystals of the turbinado along with the pecans made a nice crunchy top for those who like the added treat! Enjoy!

What a great bread! I made it yesterday and brought some to work today. My co-workers loved it! I doubled the recipe and also doubled the spices, like a previous reviewer had suggested.

This is going to go over extremely well at Thanksgiving. I am really excited about it. I loved that the sweetness of the bread was punctuated by bursts of sourness from the cranberries.

This recipe converts into 12 large absolutely delicious muffins. To bring down the fat/calorie content, I used one egg and one egg white instead of the 2 large eggs, and reduced the sugar by 1/8 cup.

I followed the recipe exactly - using fresh cranberries. It was excellent. The only thing I would modify is to add a little more sugar to the recipe and to half each cranberry. I have a sweet tooth and the big tart cranberry was a bit distracting from the overall taste. (but only a bit!) Good presentation!

Third holiday season in a row I have made this delicious pumpkin-cranberry bread to rave reviews, love the combination-contrast of the pumpkin and fresh tart cranberries. By all means do double the spices as other cooks suggested plus I added about 1/4 tsp ground cardamom per loaf, nice addition if a cardomom fan, but not overwhelming either. I also agree that whole wheat pastry flour is just fine. Yes it's a bit soggy or actually wonderfully moist and almost pudding like, but had no problem with the loaves holding together. I found baking the loaves at 325 instead of 350 for about 15 minutes longer than suggested helped overall.

Still, in the interests of information, I did the following: increased all the spices by two or three times, changed the cranberries into milk chocolate chips, used half wheat and half white flour, used half brown and half white sugar, added vanilla, used an extra tablespoon of oil, and, because I found myself without eggs in the house the night before flying somewhere for a trip, used one small (Mott's individual serving-size) container of apple-mango-peach sauce instead of the two eggs. I made 10 heaping-sized muffins with the resulting batter, and I baked them half an hour at 350. The result, after all this? An incredible, moist, tender, gingerbready pumpkin muffin with pockets of milk chocolate--my pumpkin-hating husband loved them! Someday I will try this with cranberries as well, but trust me, you don't miss the eggs in this recipe. Excellent potential here!

My family liked this. I added more spices and cranberries as suggested by other reviewers, and was glad I did.

Made this for the first time and it will become a Turkey Day regular. I increased spices by 1/2 as some suggested and also added 1 cup of chopped walnuts. We really enjoyed this bread--moist on the inside and a nice crisp top.

I made the changes that the other readers suggested (more cranberries, vanilla extract, more spices....... and still it was a pretty weak recipe. I'd look for a better recipe next time.

I made this holiday treat three times this month;once for family, and twice for friend's brunches. Everyone raved about it and many requested the recipe. I did change it slightly; by adding my own rendered pumpkin, one cup coarsely chopped walnuts, 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 additional tsp cinnamon. I also sliced the fresh cranberries in half and sprinkled with powdered sugar upon serving. Really nice!

I tripled this to make loaves for gifts. It is OK but not great. I added toasted almonds to the top. Also added more cranberries and I think it still needed more. Some nuts into the batter would definitely help, maybe walnuts.

We followed the other reviewers' advice and increased the spices by between 1 1/2 and 2 times the recommended amount. That was great! The bread was very moist and also made good muffins as well.

Every Thanksgiving this is on my table and the poor rolls never get touched. Use fresh cranberries... make 2 loaves, it will go fast.

I added xtra cinnamon, as well as nutmeg, and about 2 tbs extra pumpkin, the bread was moist and delicious, next time I will keep this the same, but add more cranberries.

I was wonderfully surprised by this bread. It was delicious! I had to cut back 1/4 cup on the pumpkin (I made two loaves at a time.) I added some Allspice and put some extra cinnamon because of the earlier comments and was glad I did. The two loaves were done in an hour instead of 1 1/4 hrs. I'm making it again for Thanksgiving.

I've made this dish 2 Thanksgivings in a row now, and am about to make it for the third time at the request of my family and friends. I know from experience that children LOVE this bread. It is one of my all time favourite pumpkin bread recipes. Definetly try this one!

I increased the amount of spices, as suggested by other reviewers and was glad I did. it's lovely, and a nice change from plain pumpkin bread, or pumpkin with apple. I loved the tartness of the cranberries. I made it for the (Canadian) Thanksgiving weekend, and had lots of other baking - so was pleasantly surprised when I discovered it had been "gobbled" up. It disappeared before the Skor Bar chocolate brownies or the cinnamon apple cheesecake!

The tartness of the cranberries adds an interesting twist on pumpkin bread, but overall this bread lacked the rich flavor that I like in a pumpkin bread. Also, it wasn't as moist as many. The group I served it to found it to be somewhat boring, and I had a good deal leftover as a result.

Loved this recipe!! The cranberries were a wonderful contrast to the pumpkin.

The texture is tender and moist without being greasy. I added 1/4 tsp of Chinese five spice, since others commented that more spices were needed. The cranberries (which I cut in half) give it a nice zip and went well with the spices. It is very quick and easy to prepare. Definitely a keeper.

I made this for the holidays this year and everyone really enjoyed it. My husband liked the whole cranberries. It gave the bread a little zing.

I made this bread the first time round staying true to the recipe and it was a bit bland but still yummy toasted. I followed the advice of an earlier reviewer and added some nutmeg. I also added some cardamom--much tastier and spicier. Even my mother-in-law enjoyed it!

Husband really liked this bread. Made it again the next day and doubled the recipe with good results. Smooth pumpkin taste with added "kick" of tart cranberries. Great toasted for breakfast. Also, whips together in a jiffy.

This recipe is nice because it is easy and versatile. I excluded ginger and cloves, and added pecans and extra cinnamon (cassia preferrably). I also used my own pumpkin puree from our Halloween pumpkins. Make sure you cook it through or it will be pasty. I also tried the recipe substituting mini choc chips for cranberries, and made them into muffins. They were delicious.

Decent. Cranberries are a nice addition. Lacks the flavor of a far superior pumpkin bread - "Spiced pumpkin loaves with whipped cream" from Bon Appetit, Nov. 1997.

I made this bread for Thanksgiving this year. I received many raves, and they haven't stopped yet!

I've made this at Thanksgiving since 1997. I double the recipe, using one loaf for the Pumpkin Bread Pudding, and the second loaf for munching. We slice it, and toast the slices in a toaster oven. Then butter it lightly like toast. So good.

This bread is very rich and moist, wonderful! I substituted a little nutmeg instead of cloves and it turned out fine. Using fresh cranberries gives this bread an extra tart twist.

If your idea of a "delicious" pumpkin loaf is one the consistency of play-doh, this recipe is for you. Apparently, a key ingredient, perhaps baking soda was left out, because the batter did not rise or become cake-like at all. Absolutely terrible.
