I really enjoyed this recipe. And the wine sauce was great. I didn't think the butter was needed at all. It worked by itself. I even substituted regular onions for scallions and spaghetti sauce for tomato paste and it worked. I did strain the onions and bay-leaf before adding the butter (which as I said wasn't really even needed)

This sauce and salmon do NOT make a beautiful couple! Imagine salmon poached in mulled wine. Yuk, yuk, yuk. Downright awful combination. Not to mention the ugly color of the sauce. A complete waste of good butter, wine and salmon.

the sauce was good, we enjoyed it. but i don't think its the perfect match for salmon. too sweet, too rich, too something. next time i'll stick with a chile lime butter or an herby sauce. and we'll use the leftover sauce from this recipe for grilled portobello mushrooms or something else that is more hearty.

I had trouble with the sauce - I couldn't get it to thicken.

I thought this was a really unfortunate combination of flavors. Cotes du Rhone with orange zest may sound good in theory (although, maybe not) but in reality it was not. It turned into a very acidic kind of taste. Perhaps I didn't make the butter correctly - it never behaved like jam - but I was not terribly impressed.

OH. MY. WORD!!!!! The sauce is absolutely wonderful. Whomever said you can't do salmon and red wine needs to step out of the 19th century. This was aboslutely marvelous. (I didn't realize this recipe called for steaks and not fillets. Fillets was what I had so fillets is what was used. Same outcome.) Love it, Love it, Love it!...

My oldest daughter (5) and husband would have prefered that the onions where strained out of the butter. I used a Keta salmon which seams to cook dry and the butter worked great with it. Everyone thought it was great. I had leftover butter which I froze for another day.

I thought this was quite a nice way to present the salmon. As the sauce was reducing I decided it was a little too tart. I added about 10 raspberries and continued to reduce the sauce and break down the raspberries. Because of the rasperries I decided to strain the sauce. I confess I did saute the salmon and finish it off in the oven with a spoonful of the sauce on top. It made a pretty presentation and was very good. Perhaps next time I will cautiously add the balsamic vinegar or add the raspberries again - they did add a nice fruity note to the sauce.

I made this recipe for my husband and we both loved it. As the other reviews said there is plenty of sauce which I froze and reused.

This was delicious. I cut the sauce in half and used salmon filets - we still had plenty of sauce. I must have cooled the sauce too much, when I put the butter in it didn't melt - so I slowly stirred it over a low flame until it warmed up just enough. I will definitely make this again.

I've tried so many salmon recipes over the last few years, and this is by far the best! The red wine butter is such a nice change from other salmon sauces and despite being incredibly easy to make, tastes rich enough to serve for a special dinner. One recommendation would be to scoop out pats of it using a melon baller and then refrigerating for an hour or so before preparing the salmon. As it is, it has sort of a sticky look about it...

quite a nice twist on beurre rouge, the orange juice and zest make it special.

Our favorite heavenly sauce, and matches with the salmon perfectly. Previously somebody gave negative critic- quote:I think there's a reason the wine rule calls for white with fish. Well that is a coplete nonsense my dear digeridoo, I do not know where did you find that rule out, probably in Cambridbe, he he.

i made this butter for my husband and i with some salmon steaks, we enjoyed it alot! i cut the recipe in half, and it was still plenty (i think i caught him eating the sauce plain!!). i have to say that whoever wrote the thing below about the "wine rule", seems a bit ill-informed. i spent a summer in sicily, and EVERYONE- every home and/or restaurant- serves all types of fish with red wine. and who cares about rules anyway? eat and drink what you like. salmon steaks go perfectly with a nice, meaty red wine.

This recipe was fantastic. I did modify it a lot however to make it very low fat. I left out all but a tablespoon of butter, and added all of the ingredients at once to make a thick sauce. I then left out the olive oil and broiled the fish in half the sauce and poured the rest over top after. Very light and very tasty!

Easy and pretty tasty. We ended up with a lot of leftover red wine butter (half would have been plenty.) As others mentioned, the purple butter looks strange but complements the salmon nicely without overpowering. Left out the tomato paste as I didn't have any around, and didn't feel like anything was missing.

I really enjoyed this recipe. The butter deserved my first epi review. Rave reviews at my dinner party, and im not a chef, i just love trying new recipes. The extra orange zest really gave "a bang" to the flavor.

I prepared this to serve with steak, it was really quite good. It is VERY important to use a good quality wine, given the concentration from the long reduction. I used the Cote du Rhone. Digeridoo, I wouldn't blame the combination of Sangiovese and sushi, more likely the quantity of wine or bad fish!

The sauce would be great even with cardboard - but also seems it would be better with steak or a meatier fish than salmon. Regardless, we loved it. I ended up using a clove of garlic instead of the shallots, ketchup (gasp!) instead of tomato paste, and about 1/3 of the butter. Definately a drinkable wine makes the difference. This is a versatile sauce that is simple to make.

This red wine butter is SENSATIONAL!!! The salmon stands up to the red wine flavor well. This butter is great with other fish as well as beef and chicken. A small dollop is all you need but you'll want more. This one is a keeper.

I think there's a reason the wine rule calls for white with fish. This "red wine butter" reminds me of the time I ignored that rule and downed a bottle of sangiovese with an entire sushi boat. Later that evening I...well, lets just say, to an onlooker, it might have seemed that I was trying to get to first base with the toilet.

The sauce wasn't as strong as I expected - perhaps it was the wine that I used, but it was a very subtle flavor. The salmon was a very good complement with the butter and took a bit of the tartness out of it. Next time I'll add a little more OJ and zest.

Made this exactly to the recipe. The butter looked odd, not incorporating well in the pan, but melted perfectly on the salmon and was truly delicious. My guests raved. This is a keeper!

Red-wine butter does not complement salmon at all. Plus, the butter itself is quite unattractive and does not easily combine its flavor with the salmon. I tried this dish with my husband and neither of us liked it.

Good qualty ingredients are the key. A great wine makes a great sauce along with fresh fish that never has a smell. Will be serving this for guest over the holidays.

I'm not usually a huge fan of salmon...it's too fishy-tasting. But, the red-wine butter made it taste great. It wasn't too overpowering. Great recipe, I'll make it again!

This is good - nice, different. Not my very favorite butter of all time, but tasty. I used salmon fillets instead of steaks, and don't think it made much of a difference.

Experimented on extended family with this recipe. It went over well but the butter looks dodgy (kind of unappetizing). So if you are going for presentation you are better off making a lovely cabernet sauce with shallots and sprinkling with chiffonade.

I have to agree with the cook from Ann Arbor. I didn't like the sauce/butter. Maybe I didn't use the right wine but I found the flavor weak and not at all what I expected.

The sauce was disgusting! Red wine and orange are definitely not a good flavor combination. What a waste of good ingredients... Ended up dumping the sauce and making a simple papillote (capers, dill, lemon, olive oil) with the salmon.

Maybe I made this wrong, or didn't use high enough quality ingredients, but didn't like this sauce at all. It was a strange combination of lack of flavor with a hint of a weird flavor. Kind of greasy tasting with all of the butter. Won't be making it again.

My wife is not crazy about salmon but when she had it with this recipe, she enjoyed it very much. Thank You for the recipe. Dee

I rated this 4 forks not because it is the best dish I have ever had, but it is by far one of the best ways to prepare salmon. I did not follow the exact method of the sauce. Once the sauce has reduced, just turn off the heat and let it sit. Once it has cooled down you can add softened butter, whisk it and then warm it up again. It is a great way, to do the sauce ahead and then you can cook the salmon just before the meal since it usually only takes 10 minutes. I pan sear and finish in the oven. I also added a few fresh herbs to the sauce--tarragon and parsley.

Very delicous! if you're not concerned with presentation, you should use the fillet cut of salmon. It's easier.

This sauce was really easy to make and the flavors are wonderful. I subsituted green onions for the shallots and it was fine. This sauce complimented the salmon perfectly. An excellent way to add flavor variety to fish.

The quality of the balsamic vinegar makes a big difference. I used a cheap brand and it made the sauce too tart, so I added 1/8 cup of maple syrup. I also tried it with onions instead of shallots, and they were fine, though next time I would carmelize them first in a bit of oil. We put it over baked whole salmon. Even with the substitutions, it was delicious and different!

What a wonderful way to eat salmon the butter just melted over the salmon and full of flavor with every bite. Would definetly make it again.

Extraordinary flavor! I grilled the salmon, but this could work with roasted strong flavored fish or chicken. Use a decent quality, hearty red wine. (We used Yellowtail Shiraz from Australia.) The extra time it takes to make the butter is worth the effort since the receipe makes enough for 8, easily. I froze several portions to use for future easy, elegant meals. Best salmon recipe on this site, in my opinion. We served it with a good Pinot Noir, stir fried sugar snaps, and parsley baby red potatoes.
