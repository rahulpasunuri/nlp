Excellent recipe, perfect for passover. Used a cookie scooper to shape them and they came out beautifully.

These are absolutely delicious and always get rave reviews. They are best when made a bit larger and look great when shaped as pyramids. For parties I put them out on a tray with homemade truffles and they look very elegant. Huge hit! You don't need to dip in chocolate if you love the coconut/almond flavor like I do, but I'm sure they are great that way too.

I'd be grateful if someone could describe the paste stage at the 12-minute mark. It seems to me that the egg white-coconut mixture is stickier before the transformation that happens, for me, at 10 minutes. And by 12 minutes, the "batter" is drier and less sticky and difficult to stir without the coconut flinging outside the pan. Perhaps I need to let it go much longer, past 13 or 14 minutes, but I didn't have the courage.

I made these cookies exactly as indicated, except used only melted dark chocolate drizzled on top. I took them to share at a dance camp but the volunteers and staff ate them before they ever made it out to the dancers. One young woman told me they were the "best" cookies she had ever eaten!

I don't recommend making these macaroons smaller than 2 oz portions. I made them into 1 oz portions so that they would stretch a little farther and they turned out extremely dry. That was my mistake, but the mix tasted great!

good, not great. Not quite as thick or complex as I'd like. These were definitely easy to make and were fine, but I'll keep looking for a really stellar macaroon recipe.

I've made this about 15 times, and it's always *such* a hit. the only suggestion i'd make is to maybe stir the shredded coconut and egg white a little bit longer, say -- 14 minutes. A definite change does occur. Also, i dont add the cream to the chocolate and it tastes just as creamy and yummy. i love em cold!

Perfect! Crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside. Nice and sweet. I brought these into work and they were gone before lunch

These cookies are amazing!!! I just switch up a few things. I put 1/4 t. almond extract in the chocolate coating, and I top with crushed, slivered almonds. The look great, and taste even better.

After browsing recipes to use my six egg whites from the thomas keller pasta recipe found on this site that uses six egg yolks.. I decided to give these a go.. Definately worth it! Having made two batches of the pasta this week, I have accordingly made two bathches of the macaroons.. each time they came out flawlessly. Only on the first batch did I chocolatize them.. really dont think they need it. The second time around I gave them every chance to go wrong... The egg whites partially froze after sittin in the coldest part of my fridge.. After thawing and making the batter, I formed them into balls, and let them sit in the fridge over night, forming them into triangles the next day.. and they still turned out flawless. Skipping the chocolate step and the triangle step really does make these guys a quick fix.. I do prefer to shape them in triangles, though, as they look a little more sophisticated. To shape them.. form them into a ball.. and rechill... they are much easier to shape if they are still quite chilly.. I usually take three out at a time to shape them and leave the others in the fridge.. Anyway.. use a pastry scraper and form a rough triangle by pushing at an angle on each of the three sides.. turn the pyramid over onto one of its side and repeate, using the pastry scraper by pushing it against each side, and sliding it across the slide to make a stronger point.. turn the pyriamid over until all sides are done! viola!

I love this recipe! Topped mine with roasted almonds and drizzled the chocolate. Looked great and tasted even better. I will make this my "go to" macaroon recipe.

I'm obsessed! These are better than any store bought cookie, including the macaroons from my favorite bakery. The key is that you really do have to cook the mixture for at least 12 minutes. I didn't understand the term "pasty" until I got there after 12 minutes. It's clear when it's time to time to remove the mixture...the consistency really changes. I didn't make pyramids, but used my 1/4 cup measuring scoop to mold into stacks and then just popped them out onto the tray. I didn't have dark chocolate on hand so used a white chocolate and amaretto mixture on half the batch and left the other half plain. It worked, but the dark choc. would definitely be better. Happy baking.

I had the same problem as "A Cook from New Brunswick, NJ." I'm wondering how accurate the term "pasty" really is. My mixture of the first three went from very close to the way it started, to moist, but "loose." I managed to form balls (no way with the pyramids), and the larger ones survived cooking without falling apart, but once we tried to eat them, they sort of crumbled (still moist, but not cake like at all). I made them smaller with the second cookie sheet, and they fell apart before even cooking all the way through. The flavor was good, however. I did make some adjustments by cutting down on the sugar and not using almond extract. In part of the batch, I used lemon juice. I'll try it again another time to see if it comes out the same. I guess I'll just cook it on the stove for 12 minutes, and leave it at that.

This was an easy excellent recipe, next time though, I will make them more level so the outside all gets lightly browned. I also mixed the chocolate with a bit of low fat yogurt to cut down on fat and the choclate hardened up nicely.

I doubled this recipe and made 36 generously sized cookies for dessert at a Passover seder. This was the one dessert on the buffet bar that everyone tried, wolfed down and went back for seconds. Even the snobby NYC foodies gushed over how moist the coconut cookies were. I though the chocolate covering was too soft and would have omited the cream in retrospect. But my nephew and uncle loved the fudgy texture and said I shouldn't change a thing. My aunt thought the chocolate overwhelmed the delicate almond/vanilla flavor of the macaroon and would have rather I had made half of them plain. Word to the wise: you really do need to keep these cookies refridgerated or the chocolate will be too melty and sticky.

This was very easy, even though I was a little put off by the initial step of cooking the egg whites, coconut, and sugar, as I have made lots of macaroons before, never using this process. They are delicious! I ended up with 9 extra-large macaroons, and I used a cookie scoop (as another reviewer said) which made things even simpler. I did not make the chocolate covering because I like them just plain. Great recipe!

I have been using this recipe for about 4 years, and it never fails. It's so easy and tasty, that my boyfriend thinks it's ok to request them at midnight.

Have made macaroons many times, always coming out gloppy when made a day ahead. I was hoping for success since no sweetened condensed milk was in this...and I'm happy to report an excellent outcome! I made these Fri. night for a Sat. picnic in 80 deg. weather and all was well. They were never soggy and disappeared quickly, w/many folks going back 3+ times for more. I did not use the chocolate, as I like them plain, and used a small cookie scoop to portion them onto the silicone baking mats. Silicone makes a big difference when trying to remove macaroons of any kind. Will certainly make again and again!

Mmmm, fabulous! And I don't even like macaroons. I made these without the chocolate sauce and everyone loved them. The trick with this recipe is to bake the cookies for exactly the right amount of time. With smaller versions, they should just begin to turn golden brown on the tips of the coconut shreds. Larger versions can take a deeper color on the outside because the inside will stay moist and chewy.

I made them in teaspoon size drops and then dipped half of the cookie in chocolate sauce--very good. Make them small and they will cook more easily.

Made it twice last year. Everyone loved them. I passsed the recipe on to some friends. I'm making it again this year. This is a happy holiday treat.

Excellent! I made them about 1/2 the size and still I think they could be made smaller. YUM! YUM!

I brought these to a staff meeting, and everyone LOVED them. They're really easy and delicious - I made a double batch, but only made half the bittersweet chocolate topping, so each macaroon was half-covered in chocolate, which was perfect. If you like chocolate and coconut, definitely make these.

i keep getting requests for these - a sure sign that it's a keeper recipe for me :)

VERY GOOD! I just used about 6 ounces of chocolate chips for the glaze and drizzled it over and down the sides.

definitely a keeper! just delicious.

These were delicious and easy to make though I thought it was a bit too much chocolate on top. Next time, I'll only use 4 ounces and just drizzle a little on top of each. I took another reviewer's advice and used a 2 teaspoon cookie scoop to make these which made an easy recipe exceptionally simple to prepare.

Yum yum! Easy to make, and they looked absolutely gorgeous. I used my silpat and baked for 30 minutes - perfect!

These macaroons are tasty and definately better than store- or bakery-bought. I found that I had to bake the macaroons almost 40 minutes to achieve the degree of firmness that is sought in the cookies. (although they did shape up into pyramids just fine). They are very pretty - I just put chocolate on the top half.

Incredible cookies! Delicious, quick and easy to make. Next time I think I'll add toasted, chopped almonds to the recipe, as another reviewer recommended. Guess the best time to add them would be with the chocolate glaze??? Anyway, if you like coconut and chocolate, you will LOVE these. Note: The cook from NB,NJ must have either had the heat to high, or cooked the egg white mixture too long, which caused it to be dry and not stick together. I followed the recipe exactly here and cooked it 12 minutes and it was perfect! I didn't form the pyramids though, but instead used a small ice-cream scoop, stuffing the mixture in and patting it down. Worked great! Also, I went light on the chocolate, drizzling it on with a pastry pipe. YUM! YUM!

What did I do wrong? My egg white mixture didn't get pasty--it just dried out. It didn't stick together when I tried to form pyramids and the end result, though it didn't taste bad, was really dry and crumbly. Since this got unanimously many good reviews, I can only think that I screwed something up . . .

This recipe is excellent! If you have a sweet craving, these definitely hit the spot. I have added toasted almonds to the recipe and they taste like a delicious Almond Joy bar.

I can't wait to make this recipe. We eat at Marigold Restaurant as often as we can and their macaroons are superb! Kudos for getting the recipe!
