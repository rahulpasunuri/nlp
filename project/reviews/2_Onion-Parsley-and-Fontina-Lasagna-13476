I added garlic salt, crushed red pepper, Italian spice blend, chicken breast, and green/yellow/red peppers AND IT WAS STILL MISSING SOMETHING! I think it might have been pancetta. I wouldn't make it again to try it, though. Somehow I forgot to read the reviews before I tried this, else I probably would have skipped it.

I dunno about this one. Just made it and my wife loves it, but we cant figure out what to eat it with. Maybe salmon. If i make again ill definatly use sausage in the sauce.

This is missing something, but it's still good. I liked the unusual textures but I wish I'd doubled the turmeric and the parsley--that may have delivered the flavor that I wanted. Still, I think this was fine for a weeknight dinner. I'll probably try it again as a side dish, maybe with fish.

I can't decide if I like this recipe or not. It did not take me a long time to make, but it is rather rich. I even used low fat milk in the sauce, but added more cheese. The flavors are interesting, and good if you have a small piece. Not my favorite lasagne recipe.

I will happily make this again, and I'm with the previous reviewer in that I don't think it took exceptionally long to make. I used cilantro instead of the parsley and loved it! Use more of the cheese if you like. All wonderful flavors! These no-boil noodles are a dream...KIMBER

This lasagna is sweet, rich, and delicious. I added some crumbled italian sausage to the sauce and used parsley fresh out of the garden. I don't know how long the previous reviewer generally takes to make lasagna, but this took less than 3 hours, prep to eating. Not bad if you ask me. I used sweet vidalia onions. I didn't find any of the flavors overpowering. Even the dog was so thrilled with the aroma she begged for a few bites.

This dish has an over-whelming flavor. Between the onions and the fontina cheese, a few bites and I was done! This dish was far too much work. It took me 0ne-and-a-half hours just to prep--not to mention the clean-up. My opinion, forget this one. There are far too many other good recipes on this web site.
