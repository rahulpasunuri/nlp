This is a wonderful beet recipe. Served it with beef tenderloin because I thought the horseradish would compliment the beef and it did. I didn't have maple syrup on hand so I used honey instead and it was a hit. The leftovers tasted great right out of the fridge.

This is our go-to recipe for beets now. Fast, easy and delicious! We cut way back on the butter...use just a scant Tblsp...works out fine.

I have made this recipe countless times after I found it in Gourmet Magazine. I love beets and I adore and crave this recipe because it combines the earthiness of the beet with the earthy bite of the horseradish and sweetness of the maple syrup. Butter smoothes it all together, but you can get away with less butter. The bite of the recipe depends on the freshness f the horseradish, so I don't agree with the one person who said it did not have enough bite. You can always add more but it's going to be overpowering if you add too much horseradish at the beginning. I love the idea of using the greens and I will try that the next time. I do also confess that if I am at the cottage and without my good oven, I sometimes use canned beets. There is no overt glory in baking and peeling this many beets, so I sometimes choose to cheat by using quartered beets. One other point, is that if you use a large number of beets, it is just fine to dice or slice the beets to get them to fit into containers. This recipe is very forgiving. YUM YUM YUM

This was the best beet dish I have ever made and I am usually pretty neutral on beets. The only change I made was to mix in some wilted beet greens at the end. I had the entire beet from root to green, so no need to waste!

Fabulous (even for non beet lovers like my wife). I used a lighter horse radish and it could have used a little more.

Will make, again, for upcoming Thxgv with the homegrowns I am harvesting and freezing now. Flavor profile is deep and interesting. Choosing dark, rich syrup improves the outcome.

Made this for Easter mainly to add a tasty splash of colour to a 'provincal' al fresco family lunch - and a beet fan Mum. Never having cooked beets before, a forum member confirmed beets can be roasted the night before without problem, which saved time and oven space. Concluded that beets cannot be killed and everyone who thought beets were ordinary now thinks they are fabulous. Intended to put the greens in too as suggested by another reviewer but forgot. Mum happily took leftovers home with recipe and note to remember greens.

Amazingly simple and delicious. I added the beet greens, coarsely chopped, into the mixture and it was fantastic. I served this to 3 of my "gourmet" friends...and all raved. Definitely a keeper. Served this as a side with a corned beef brisket (St. Pattie's Day), new potatoes and cabbage,and a 2004 Guigal Cotes du Rhone (red) and home made cornbread. One of the best meals in a while. Cheers.

This is, by far, one of my favorite beet side dishes. It is sweet and savory, not to mention beautiful.

Delicious and so easy! I halved the butter and it was still amazingly good. If you love beets, try it!

Very good, very easy. I was short on time and microwaved the beets instead of roasting them (15 mins on high). Will try less butter next time to see if it's just as good but a bit healthier.

This was great! I made this on Easter as an accompanyment to baked Ham. I used homemade horseradish and pure maple sugar. I plan on making this a regular side dish not only with Ham but also with grilled pork, chicken and steak.

I prepared this recipe for Easter dinner along with the mustard/pineapple basted ham. The color was great and the flavor wonderful! Very easy and if you are a beet lover-a definite keeper.

This was a truly delicious dish! I only had "hot" horseradish and raspberry vinegar on hand, and loved it that way! I halved the butter and it was fine; I only wished that I doubled the recipe! The earthy, tart & sweet of this beet dish makes it a great accompaniment to so many main dishes. I served this up with a vegetarian barley-lentil pilaf. Together it had the "wow" factor!

I'm a big, big fan of beets, so I was really excited to try this out. I made the recipe as written and as is I think it is just three stars. I would have liked more bite from the horseradish... it was just a little too sweet for my tastes. Will definitely play with this recipe to give it a bit more bite.
