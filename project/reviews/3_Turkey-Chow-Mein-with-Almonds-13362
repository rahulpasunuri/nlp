For those with sauce problems, try making the sauce in a separate pan prior to stir frying the rest. You can easily adjust the thickness and taste that way.

This recipe is a misnomer. While it looks like it would be tasty enough, it's just a turkey stir fry. Chow mein is stir-fried noodles.

Not Bad. Used pre-packaged cole slaw mix & thin sliced, stir fried pork. I also doubled the sauce which left me with WAY more than 2 servings (more like 4-6). I agree that the sauce needs something more. Fresh garlic and ginger might be just the solution. Over all, a great/quick/easy weeknight dinner. Will definitely be making again soon.

Anyone who has ever eaten in a chinese restaurant in NY and/or NJ will recognise this as chow mein. For the noodle part, it is usually served with fried chow mein noodles. Onions, celery, cabbage and lots of soy sauce. It's perfect!

With the addition of ginger to the existing sauce, this recipe went from ho-hum to yyyuuummm! Also, I used chicken breast instead of turkey.

I added garlic and chile seeds as suggested, still a little bland. I'd say it's a good base recipe but add stuff like a bit of oyster sauce, green onions maybe double the almonds.

As some other former NY'ers mention, this is classic NY style Chow Mein. I'm making this tonight!

Didn't like the fact that the only veggies in this were onion, cabbage, and celery. So, to increase the veggies, I used about 3/4 of a 16 oz. bag of frozen FLAV-R-PAC Quick 'N Easy Combos Chow Mein Stir Fry, 2 cups of the Napa cabbage, a few slices of red onion, and some chopped garlic. Added about 1/2 tsp. of dried crushed red pepper too. Omitted the sesame oil. Since the frozen veggie mix had noodles in it, I omitted the rice and added 2 oz. (dry weight) of cooked Kluski style noodles. Poached 2 chicken breasts in 14 oz. of Swanson fat-free chicken broth, and then used the remaining broth as the base for doubling the sauce. The doubled sauce still needed extra soy sauce and sugar. It did not thicken properly, even with a double amount of cornstarch/water and the extra noodles. Next time I would use more cornstarch. IT WAS DELICIOUS AND STILL TASTED LIKE CHOW MEIN!!!

I made this into chow mein. I stir fried chicken, added some oyster sauce, then stir fried the vegetables, also with oyster sauce. I made the sauce from the recipe, doubling the soy sauce, added it to the chicken and vegetables. Then added in some chow mein noodles, which I had cooked to al dente in another pot, and stirred it all up. Delicious.

Chow mein means literally "stir-fried noodles." So since this recipe has no noodles it should be called chop suey. Not a bad basic recipe for chop suey though.

I seem to remember hearing my mother say that chop suey and chow mein were the same except that chow mein was made with noodles and chop suey was served over rice. Any experts in the house?

I was encouraged by the previous reviews and very disappointed when I made it. It needs salt, more thickening and a variety of vegetables - in other words it would be a different recipe.

Just finished cooking and eating this-talk about a HIT! I added 3 garlic cloves and a little more soy sauce as suggested, flavor was perfect. But true enough, the doubled sauce never did thicken enough, hence the 3 forks. Added julienned carrots, green onions and authentic chinese noodles. Can't get any better than this!

I made this for a client and it was yummy. Substituted diced chicken that I had stir fried right before. Couldn't believe the flavor!

Haven't tried yet, but NEW YORKERS (even former ones) know that real chow mein is just like this, served over rice with fried noodles on top!

This tasted very good. I doubled the sauce as suggested but mine never got thick. I did double the corn starch. It was more like soup but everyone still liked the way it tasted. I would make it again if I could figure out how to make the sauce thick.

I wonder why the recipes never have enough sauce. It is usually a given that you have to double it.

Finally a Chow Mein recipe without Noodles, similar to one served in a local restaurant. We added garlic and more soy sauce to enhance the flavor.

Technical question: Should this be called "chow mein" when there is no "mein" (noodles) in it?

My family loved this dish. I decreased the cabbage and added a little sliced carrot, bean sprouts, pea pods, and water chestnuts. I also doubled the sauce proportions and substituted honey for the sugar. This recipe rivaled our favorite restaurant's Chow Mein!!!!
