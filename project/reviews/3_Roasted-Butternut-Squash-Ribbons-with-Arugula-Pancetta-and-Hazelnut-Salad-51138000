This is our new favorite winter salad. Only change we've made is to cur butternut squash in 1/4-1/2" cubes - b/c we're too lazy to go through work of shaving squash into ribbons. Dressing is fabulous on all sorts of greens though we keep returning to this mix for its range of flavors/textures

I liked the combination of warm squash with the rest of the salad. The sweeter dressing was excellent with the chickory. I made the salad exactly as the recipe instructed, ate some it, and then added bleu cheese crumbles (because my boyfriend likes it in his salads) and tried it that way. I can't say that wasn't equally good!
