So... this recipe was written before many of us had things like Hoisin sauce in our cabinets. So, based on this idea and on others' comments, I did this hack: Instead of catsup, I used Hoisin sauce (you could also use Maggi's Tamarind sauce), and doubled the amount of the sauce. I also deleted the sugar, as Hoisin is pretty sweet already. On the cooking, I threw the garlic, onions, ginger into a hot wok, then threw in the peapods until they were bright green, added the sauce, corn starch mixture and cooked it down. Then I scraped them all out into a bowl, added a little more oil and threw in the shrimp, cooked until pink. Then I threw in the pea combo, and stirred until mixed. Total cooking time was 9 minutes. We dished over warm rice noodles and tossed them together. My husband and I spent the dinner saying, "ummmmm, ummmmm."

This recipe was just mediocre. I didn't think it had a lot of flavor to it. Quite bland! I think I'll stick to my other stir fry recipes.

I made this recipe as written, guessing when to add the snow peas and catsup mixture. I found the consistency chewy due to the egg whites and since stir fry should be easy to make, I will not make it again.

I made this recipe last night and it turned out delicious! I added a red pepper to the mix and served over rice (I found it strange that rice was not mentioned?) I wasn't sure what to do with the ketchup/soy sauce either...we added it at the end- just drizzled it over the mix.

I was looking for a recipe for scallops & snow peas and found this one. I make it with 1/2 pound of shrimp & 1/2 pound of scallops. It came out great. I too was comfused with the recipe of when to add the snow peas (added before the thickening was done. My husband said to make this again.

Read carefully and use all ingredients even tho omitted in directions. I substituted fresh soy beans cooked in pod and shelled and served with shredded red cabbage on spinach leaves, black olives, pineapple cubes arranged on individual appetizer dishes. The presentation and taste meld are impressive.

I skimmed through the recipe and assembled the ingredients. As I was about to brown the onion, garlic, and ginger, I realized the instructions omitted the catsup, soy sauce, sugar and snow peas. I added those after thickening the sauce, staying at high heat for about 3 minutes. I think I guessed correctly as it turned out to be a delicious dish.
