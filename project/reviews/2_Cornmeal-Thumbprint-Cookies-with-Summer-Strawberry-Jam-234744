If you have a kid who is into sports, make these, they make great hockey pucks. I was really dissapointed, because the dough tasted fantastic, but the cookies were rock hard.

Sorry to be negative-I usually post only positive reviews or say nothing at all but this recipe was very time consuming and totaly not worth it. I liked the crunch from the cornmeal but the taste was SO SWEET!! The mere thought of adding the jam makes my teeth hurt! I cannot reccomend this recipe.

This was really good - loved the lemon flavor in combo w/ the summer jam. Went over great at my party!
