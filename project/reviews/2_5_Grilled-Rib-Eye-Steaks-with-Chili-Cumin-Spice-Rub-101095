We made the mistake of using nice sirloin steaks for this recipe. Reminded me of chuck steak in mom's chilepot. Avoid this one.

Whipped this up tonight to throw on the grill for a quick supper. I thought that this was a real nice balance of chile, cumin and lime. I used ground chipotle for the chile component for a nice smokey flavour

I usually love all the recipes from this site but not this one. I thought there wasn't much flavor to it. My steaks were slightly bigger than what the recipe called for, but I still used the same amount of rub. Maybe that's were I went wrong. I don't think I'll be making it again though.

We thought this was pretty boring. All you could taste was the chili powder. If you reeeally like chili powder, this one's for you. If not, pass. Doubt we'll be using this one again.

This recipe works for cooks who know the difference between CHILI and CHILE. Chili powder is for making chili. Chile is various types of chile powder ie; red chile, green chile, jalpeno powder etc. We made this with Chimayo, New Mexican red, and New Mexican Green chile powders plus a dash of white pepper and kosher salt. If you like New Mexican or Mexican style foods you will love this dish. Just remember to rub steaks and allow to "marinate" for at least 20 minutes before grilling to get a nice spicy crust.

Wow! I love lots of flavor in my dishes and this one truly has it. I actually doubled the amount of the rub, as my steaks were a tad bigger. The steaks were sheer perfection! I make them all the time now.

Simple and delicious. I had this with Stouffer's Spinach Souffle, baked potato wedges, and a some RH Phillips Cabernet Sauvignon. I'm going to try this rub with other things such as salmon, chicken and lamb.

Simple, easy and good, all of my personal requirements for a good meal.

I didn't write down the proportions and realized after I made it that I used a lot more of all the ingredients. Nonetheless, it was quite good. Garlic would be a nice addition in the future though. We served it with fresh corn on the cob, garden salad and margaritas - all of it went together nicely.

If this dish weren't so tasty, you'd love it for its simplicity alone. Soooo easy to do, and using a grill pan makes it all that much faster. Loved it! I served this will Spring Vegetable Medley and steamed corn on the cob. A nice, quick Sunday evening meal. Try it!

Tasty, yet bland? That makes perfect sense. Really good recipe.

I used the rub on a London broil and was very pleased with the results. I'm making this for the second time tonight.

The meat is tasty-yet surprisingly bland. Next time I will add a little salt, maybe garlic salt to the rub. The flavor reminds me of Fajita meat.
