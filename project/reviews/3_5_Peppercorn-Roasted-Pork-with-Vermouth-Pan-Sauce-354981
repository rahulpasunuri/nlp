I know some people don't like it when cooks change the recipe and then rate based on the changes, but that's what I did. I used a local, pastured pork Boston Butt (3.75#). I did not use pink peppercorns at all, just a "normal" amount of fresh ground black pepper. I reduced the amount of salt (about 3/4 T of Kosher.) I added fresh chopped rosemary to the run (about 3T.) I ground the fennel seeds in a mortar and pestle. I used a 12" cast iron skillet as a roaster (easy to make gravy in later) and put the (room temp) roast into a 450 degree oven with convection on, then immediately reduced the temp to about 290 (convection off.) My experience with local grassfed meats has convinced me that low-and-slow is the way to go. I also had significant pan drippings so I used a gravy separator cup to separate the fat. The gravy was absolutely delicious!!

This is a staple at our house. Don't add the peppercorns to the sauce if you find it too much. Wonderful!

I loved this recipe! It is very good. I used a mixed peppercorns and black peppercorns for the paste. The amount of peppercorn seemed to me way too much. Thus, I used a lot less probably around a tbsp of each and no more.It was more than enough. The sauce was AWESOME. I find this recipe suitable for holidays if you want to eat something different. The sauce definitely can be used with veal. I strongly recommend to lower the amount of peppercorns! I actually happen to find that I have this recipe in my mag of the same year hehehe! The pic here drove me to my own magazine but my guts told me that the peppercorns were too much and I was right!

I LOVED this recipe - I have made in three times and each time a success. Guests can't stop talking about it. I used rib roast however as I am unfamiliar with shoulder roast. I also skip adding the extra peppercorns to the sauce - it makes it too peppery and not needed.

The pork tasted great right out of the oven, but as the meat cooled, the flavor of the peppercorns become overwhelming. I would not make this recipe again.

Great flavor, pop in the oven and forget about it. Tender and worth making for company. Not at home when I made this, substitued the pink peppercorns for a full grinder jar of mixed colored peppercorns, tasted great!

This has got to be one of the best tasting pork roasts ever. Hubby couldn't say enough about how good it was. Will be making it again soon for guests.

I just made this the way the RECIPE INSTRUCTS--the correct cut, the correct method and it was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. I can never fathom ANYONE doing a recipe review when they DIDN'T actually MAKE the recipe. Twits.

I just made this dish for a last minute dinner party tonight. I didn't have a shoulder roast so used centre cut pork roast. No time to marinate so just made & used the rub as per recipe & put in the oven. Sadly, I was not impressed. Although the meat was tender, juicy & flavorful, the peppercorns were just too overpowering. The 'pockets' of paste really distracted from the meat flavor and my guests were discreetly scraping it away as they ate. The pan sauce really saved this dish - it was delicious, especially with roasted potatoes. Next time I'd marinate as per the recipe, sans the paste pockets, and then scrape off/discard a lot of the paste before baking. Actually, who am I kidding? I won't make this recipe again but I'll totally use the pan sauce for another roast.
