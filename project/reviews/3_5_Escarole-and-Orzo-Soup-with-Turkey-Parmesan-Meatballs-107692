If forgot to mention I also seared meatballs first and would highly recommend doing that first, then added the carrots, etc.

Delicious and easy. Good comfort food soup. I used chopped spinach since no escarole at store and loved it.

Rating: 4
Super easy and so good. I used 6 cups of the store bought chicken broth and added 2 of my own that I had frozen from my last chicken soup. I made extra meatballs and I seared them all first before added to the broth. I also used seasoned breadcrumbs. I hardly had to season once the soup was done with additional salt. Just a little extra pepper and it was delicious!!!!

A.K.A. Italian Wedding Soup where turkey, ground chuck & ground pork (50/50), or simply ground beef are used. Meatballs are rather bland. Rosemary, oregano or red pepper flakes add flavour. Soup is good. Can use escarole, spinach, chard or kale. Kale doesn't become so soft and I prefer that. Also sauteed a small onion and 2 garlic cloves adding those to the broth.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I followed the other rater's recommendations and made a double batch of meatballs to use later. I found a whole wheat orzo but still added only 3/4 the amount and an entire head of the escarole which was perfect. I also used Italian breadcrumbs which added some flavor to the meatballs. (unfortunately they are a little more "processed" but I needed to use them up)

Rating: 3
This is a really good soup with a few adjustments. Searing the meatballs in a pan before adding to the soup is a MUST. Also, the orzo is way overcooked if added with the carrots. I would recommend adding with only 5-7 min left of cooking. Or cook the orzo separately and add at the end to avoid over- starchy broth and/or over cooked orzo.

We love this recipe at our house and don't mind the "pale" meatballs (which, incidentally, are how the meatballs in a traditional Italian wedding soup always look). I have used Swiss chard often as a substitute for escarole, which I have a hard time finding here. I saute the stems of red Swiss chard in a little olive oil & garlic to soften before adding to the pot. Another tip: making a double batch of meatballs takes just a few minutes more than a single batch, and (uncooked) they freeze beautifully on a cookie sheet. I store in a freezer bag for an almost instant soup on a night with a time crunch.

Pretty good recipe! Based on the comments, I cooked the orzo separately and added it toward the end of cooking. It sounded a touch bland, so I tried out a couple modifications: like others, I seared the meatballs in the bottom of a dutch oven, removed them and then sauteed the carrots in the drippings. With the carrots, I also sauteed some minced garlic and peeled and diced red bell pepper. I did also swapped out half of the chicken broth for beef broth for more flavor. It turned out pretty well!

Rating: 3
It's very good and quite simple. I used homemade chicken broth. As the recipe directs, the boiled turkey meatballs look a bit pallid, so if you have time, browning them would certainly look more attractive. I love escarole and I think next time I will probably use the whole head, as I felt there wasn't enough green. (My kids would disagree...) I added the orzo with the meatballs, since orzo package said boil for 8-10 mins. Thought about adding a can of cannellini beans to make it healthier (could maybe cut back on orzo then?), maybe next time. There WILL be a next time!!

Rating: 4
This was absolutely fantastic. I boiled down my Thanksgiving turkey carcass for stock and so only needed a quart of chicken stock. Also did a panade of the breadcrumbs with some half and half instead of the eggs. Finally, I don't know why I thought it called for the juice of one lemon, but I threw that in there and it was terrific. Made a slight change on preparation: I sauteed the carrots to soften them first, then took out and cooked the meatballs to give them some carmelization before adding all the other ingredients. Didn't have escarole on-hand so I threw in a bag of chopped baby spinach.

Doubled the meatball recipe, and generously adding extra for the ingredients I love (parm. cheese, garlic) and in addition red pepper flakes, basil, oregano, and some onion powder. Browned them in some EVOO and served with pasta and (basil/garlic) red sauce...what I had in the pantry. AND they were excellent, and all consuming parties agreed, will make again for sure.

This was great! Using what I had in my kitchen, I subbed spinach for the escarole and sage & thyme for the parsley, and also incorporated some others' suggestions: I browned the meatballs before adding them, and also included a diced onion and two cloves of garlic in the broth. Yum!

Rating: 3
Enjoyed and would make again, but agree that meatballs would be more delicious if browned before being added. Using up what was on hand, I used chicken and beef broth in a 4:1 ratio, which made it a little extra rich in flavor. Also, added 1 C diced onion and 1 rib celery, diced. Added the orzo a little later to avoid gumminess. Would make again, keeping these changes, and browning the meatballs.

is pretty good as written, I had to tweek it a little, I made it with pearl couscous because I didnt have orozo on hand, but it was very good I ended up adding a little bit of crushed red pepper flakes too (but thats me, anything I add garlic to gets red pepper flakes)...but over all its tastey and a good cold weather comfort food I would definately make again, but I think it could definately use more cheese

Rating: 1
I had trouble with the texture of the meatballs. They seemed mealy and grainy, perhaps for being boiled so long? The soup would be improved by adding more veggies and, perhaps, by browning the meatballs and only finishing them in the stock.

Rating: 4
My family including my two daughters really enjoyed this soup. I have made this twice and the second time I made some changes. I used more than a pound of turkey, and decided to add another 4 cups of chicken broth because I wanted more of a soup consistency. I used the same amount of Orzo. I doubled the cheese and added an additional clove of garlic. I didn't have any escarole so I used prewashed spinach instead in the same amount. It tasted fresh and delicious especially on a cold winter night.

Rating: 3
I agree with the cook from Pasadena, that the texture of the meatballs was unpleasant. I think I pulverized them too much. Next time I would try chopping the turkey instead of processing it. I would love to hear how the people who liked the meatballs "ground" the turkey. I took the meatballs out of the soup- gave to dog- and sent hubby out for tortellini as a replacement. Should be good!

Rating: 4
This is one of my favorite soups. Of course, it's only going to be as good as the individual ingredients you use. I make my own turkey or chicken broth, use the best parmesean cheese, and Plaineville ground turkey. I have never had this soup come out "bland". Enjoying it for dinner right now. I love to read the reviews and adaptations. Can always improve and I like the ideas for substitutions. Thank you!

Rating: 4
I may have found my favorite soup! Of course I changed a lot of it - I may have created a new soup. I used 4 cups of chicken broth & 4 cups of mushroom broth - this added depth and flavor. Did Buffalo instead of turkey- adding rosemary in place of parsley- AMAZING! Also added 1/2 c of celery at the same time of the meatballs... try the adaptation. Rave reviews from those who enjoyed it with me.

The broth was a little bit bland for my taste. Adding a tablespoon or two of pesto at the end made a big difference.

Just finished this dinner. The soup was good but not spectacularly bursting with flavor. The only changes I made were to use roasted garlic (which I had on hand) and to sub gnoccheti sardi pasta (a small ridged shell) as my market was out of orzo. The turkey came in a three pound package, so I quarupled the meatballs to freeze and save for heroes, spaghetti, etc.

This was a great soup and only took about 45 minutes to prepare. I followed previous reviewers' advice and seared the turkey meatballs before putting them in the soup, and also prepared the orzo al dente separately before adding it into the soup to soften. Using 16oz of turkey meat I came out with a little over 20 meatballs.

Though easy to make, this was not a hit. Overall bland flavor, though the meatballs were fine. I didn't have the response from my family as others had and I follwed the recipe exactly, except adding more garlic--which helped. I'll try other soup recipes before making this one again.

Rating: 4
This soup is wonderful. I seem to be the only person who found 2 cloves of garlic in the meatballs to be overwhelming. I cut back the second time I made it and loved it. Of course, my "helpful" boyfriend might have been heavy-handed with the garlic the first go around. Anyhow, this is a keeper!

I have made this soup four times now and I love more each time. I have found that using lentils in the meatballs (about a 65% turkey/35% lentil ratio) makes them light and fluffy. I also like the Israeli couscous more than the orzo. I can't wait for dinner!

I have made this recipe so many times. It is one of our favorites. I always make the orzo separately otherwise it gets yucky. The meatballs I bake in the oven on a cookie sheet at 350 for 30 minutes and set them aside. The broth, I use an entire package of carrots - the more the better. I also peel the first layer of an onion and wrap it in cheese cloth and boil it with the carrots until tender. I remove the onion and set aside to eat later - it gives the broth so much flavor. I assemble the soup in individual bowls instead of adding all in one pot.

This soup is easy to make, healthy and very tasty. I would cook the orzo separately next time, since it absorbed all the broth the next day, which didn't make for very good leftovers. I'd also make the meatballs smaller. Will definitely make again!

This soup is really yummy. I recommend making a double batch of the meatballs and freezing in advance. The soup comes together very fast if you do that.

I always cook the orzo separately, otherwise the soup gets too gummy when reheated.

definitely a keeper, especially given that i've made it three times already! a household favorite, the flavor in the turkey meatball is amazing. with my first go around, i was worried that the meatballs wouldn't have much flavor, but i was wrong...i like to add finely shredded carrots to the meatballs, and about 2tsps of white pepper powder. i find that 1/4c of breadcrumbs and a good splash of milk works well as binder if you don't have eggs on hand.

Rating: 2
Wanted to like this more than I did. First off, the meatball texture was a bit too "gummy" for my taste; the orzo tripled in size & absorbed most of the broth when stored in the fridge; the escarole became too wilted (no longer crisp/crunchy) and lastly it was too salty (even with using a reduced sodium broth).

My go-to Escarole and Meatball soup is made in a crockpot. I think that's why I wasn't very impressed with this version. It was too light, the broth was lacking deep flavors. I will be using the meatballs in my crockpot version. If I decide to attempt this version again, I may substitute 1/3 of the chicken broth for beef stock. I'm hoping that would provide more depth of flavor.

My husband doesn't think anything should be made with turkey burger (as well as my dad). I have been determined to make a meal that my husband couldn't tell it was turkey! I have succeeded!!! My dad loved it as well, he had not clue.

Easy, very good and would make again.

This was a delicious and hearty meal! Per other reviewers I: doubled the recipe for the meatballs + froze half to use later, added fresh rosemary, added extra parsley and carrots, and used whole-grain kamut elbow macaroni. I cooked the macaroni separately and spooned the soup on top of the pasta in a bowl to serve. I love that this is such a healthy treat! Will definitely make again!

I used this recipe as an inspiration for a 4 fork dish. First of all, I made up the meatballs and baked in the oven while I got other components ready (made a double batch of meatballs and used half in a tomato basil pasta sauce another day). For the soup, I sweated chopped onion, celery and carrot in olive oil, then added chicken stock. When vegetables were almost tender I added the cooked meatballs and orzo. It didn't take long for the orzo to become tender. Just before serving I added several handfuls of spinach and a generous amt of chopped parsley. Served with parmesan. This was an outstanding dish - even better a day or two later (great work lunch).

This soup was wonderful! Easy to make and fast. I wasn't holding out a lot of hope (despite others' rave reviews) but it surpassed my expectations. Will definitely be making this again.

I made something similar to this last night and just wanted to note that you don't have to pre-make and chill the meatballs. Just drop them into the boiling soup as you roll them, and add the pasta after the meatballs are all in. That saves some time and you also don't risk pasta-overbloat waiting for meatballs to cook.

This soup is so easy and so good for embellishment. I really think other suggestions of mushrooms and fresh herbs are a must. I added fresh thyme and rosemary to both the broth and the meatballs. I do think others are right in adding the orzo later than called for or you risk it being overdone. But this soup was really excellent and great for the rare rainy day here in Arizona.

My boyfriend and I really liked this soup. It is subtle and hardy. Perfect as lunch for a cool summer day. And its easy-peasy to make. The mild flavors, I think, really require using a homemade chicken broth, which I will definitely do the next time I make it. I made one big substition that I would recommend as a time saving alternative. The Whole Foods near me has wonderful mild Italian sauages, so I just bought two, took the meat out the casing, added some extra fennel seeds, parsley, parmesan, egg and bread crumb and then made them into tiny meatballs. Next time I might also add a couple tablesppons of tarragon, which is usually my secret in all chicken soups, and I think it would go well with the flavors here too, bringing out the flavors of the escarole. Garlic fans may also want to go a little heavier than the recipe calls for. And the reviewer who said the orzo gets soggy was spot on. For best results, add it at the very end. Also, I froze the unused portion and it kept surprising well, although the escarole loss a good deal of its distinctiveness.

This is excellent; we stuffed ourselves on a cold evening with this soup and a side of cauliflower. I added a can of canellini beans at the end, per someone's suggestion, and they were a nice addition. Next time I'm going to try making the meatballs a little smaller so you can eat them in one bite. The escarole is important because of its having body (besides its tang), so try to find some without resorting to spinach right away. To the person who asked what carrots add: the point (ha ha) of carrots is color, a little texture, cultural familiarity and all that good stuff.

Rating: 3
I would say this was pretty good. A little bland for my taste, but nothing that a little (or a lot) of grated parmesan on top couldn't fix up. I did add the can of diced tomatoes. Don't know if that helped, probably a little. I also took the advice of another and cooked the orzo separately. Accompanied with the Cheesy Zucchini and Red Onion Flatbread (Bon Appetit, 2006) which went well with it.

Rating: 3
As others have noted, this is a good, infinitely adaptable soup. For instance, I added a can of diced tomatoes to add a little more tang and body to the soup. And I added lemon zest, lots of rosemary and a bit of sage, and plenty more garlic to this. Turkey stock is the way to go--and try to get escarole. It's available many places. Spinach is a little too mild here--and the point is the flavor of the escarole.

I make this soup every few months, it is easy, cheap to make and very tasty...a perfect combination. I stick to the recipe, except when it come to the orzo.

If I do use pasta I will make it on the side and add it to my bowl. Prevents soggy pasta.

Wonderful, hot, hearty, and healthy meal . I made a few changes to this recipe mainly because it's what I already had. Used panko instead of bread crumbs. Didn't have parsley so I added approx. 2T. of pesto. Used equal portions of veggie and chicken broth. I also added an onion that I sauteed until it was brown, and sweet. No escarole so sub'd spinach. Did brown meatballs, which adds extra flavor and helps keep the broth from being "murky". Definitely add the orzo towards the end so it doesn't overcook.

Rating: 3
This will be my enthusiastic third winter for making this soup, which has enthralled family and guests since I first delightedly found it. Unless the entire recipe will be eaten immediately, it's best to cook the orzo in a separate pot (using some of the chicken broth, if desired, or water, if you prefer to dump the starch from the pasta, as I do, rather than adding it to the soup, which is going to be thin anyway) and add it only to the amount of soup that will be served (or to each soup plate). Otherwise the orzo (or any other small pasta) will turn to mush as it sits. Turkey broth would be a fine substitute for chicken broth here, and after Thanksgiving, a few stray strands of turkey would not go amiss to make the soup even heartier. It's really a meal as it is, and a very fine lunch on a cold day. Articles have appeared recently that encourage the millions of us who don't qualify for flu shots to nourish ourselves well to boost our immune systems. To that end, I plan to make and freeze a double batch of this soup (to use the whole head of escarole) to heat when I get the flu and this kind of hot, nourishing mildness is the only food that appeals. It's a good way to get a little protein down, too, when one is feeling fragile. Reviewers who say they like to brown the meatballs before adding them to the pot are harking back to this recipe's apparent predecessor (still available on Epicurious), a 1995 Gourmet recipe for Escarole Soup with Turkey Meatballs. I have not found any problem with skipping that messy, caloric step. I think the 2003 version is an improvement in other ways as well. Unlike one or more reviewers who question the use of carrots, I like them. I think they provide taste interest and a necessary dash of color.

I've made this several times now, and though i agree with the reviewers who said it wasn't really gourmet fare, I like this dish for 3 reasons. First, it still tastes good and is an easy, hearty, healthy dish for weeknights. Second, the meatballs can be made in advance and frozen for nights when the cook is tired or rushed. And third, it is also easy to adapt the soup or just the meatballs to vary the recipe. I've had the meatballs with pasta and sauce and it was yummy!

Just made this tonight for a quick family dinner. I added one finely chopped onion while heating the broth, and followed a couple of suggestions made by others (baked meatballs in oven rather than chilling, used spinach rather than escarole). With a loaf of bread it made a good meal. Use good, freshly grated parmesan for best flavor.

Rating: 3
Made this for the second time tonight, and again it was VERY GOOD. Actually found Ronzoni orzo at my local store, and this time I used it instead of minute rice (which had yielded a too liquid product the first time). (Ronzoni has an interesting web site: www.ronzoni.com.) The changes I made to the original recipe: used regular ground turkey; used a generous sprinkle of salt (not 3/4 tsp.) in the meatball mixture; subbed 5-1/2 oz. (by weight) fresh spinach for the escarole; baked the turkey balls about 25 minutes at 425 degrees before adding them to the soup at the same time as the spinach; added about 10 drops of Maggie Hot Chile sauce to the soup. It turned out a bit salty and too watery. It did not look like the picture that makes it look more like a stew. Next time I would do as stated above, but also replace 1 cup of the low sodium broth with water, increase the orzo to 1 cup, and increase the spinach slightly. Then I think it would be a 4-forker!!! (P.S. the meatballs are WONDERFUL!!!)

Rating: 3
Good for a family meal - hearty and relatively simple. The meatballs were surprisingly tender. Taking the advice of a previous rater, I broiled the meatballs (instead of chilling them) for 10 minnutes in the oven before adding them to the soup. I also used a combination of escarole and spinach, tripling the suggested amount (my fmaily likes greens). There's definitely nothing complex about the resulting flavors; just a simple, hearty meal for a weeknight.

Everyone just loved this soup. I made a few changes though. I used a meatloaf mix of pork, beef, and veal which made the meatballs much more flavorful. I also cooked the orzo separately so it wouldn't absorb the broth. Just writing about this is making me want make it again!

Great thanksgiving leftover. Used a combo of turkey broth,chicken and beef. We don't like ground turkey so substituted lean ground beef and added a pinch of red pepper to the meatballs. Not sure why everyone thinks the meatballs should be browned - it's very much like Mexican albondigas soup with the meatballs cooked in the broth. Also added a can of diced tomatoes and juice for a little color and spark. No escarole so substituted spinach like many others

Delicious - and to transform it, I added a teaspoon of greek seasoning. Should have done that at first, as it was too salty when added to the spices in the recipe. Also would brown the meatballs to make them more attractive. But this is a good one.

I'd make again, but the meatballs need some serious spice, or flavored bread crumbs.

Great recipe. My daughters, who are typically very picky eaters, couldn't get enough. I browned the meatballs first before adding to soup.

I think this soup is simple and delicious. The carrots seem a little out of place, but I guess they do add a little variety to a very simple soup. The meatballs were delicious, although I added quite a bit more garlic to them to spice things up a little. This one will become a regular in our house.

I was seeking a recipe for ground turkey and ran across this. I was pleasantly surprised. Not super-gourmet fare, but pretty darn easty and tasty. I followed the recipe exactly except for a substitution of a bag of spinach instead of escarole.

I thought the meatballs were the best part of this dish. If you have a hard time finding escarole..dandelion (yes dandelion) will do. Also make sure you use orzo I tried reg. pasta and it absorbed all the broth. Cook and learn eh?

Rating: 3
My family enjoyed the soup but I, like others, used spinach instead of escarole which I couldn't find. I also roasted the meatballs for 30 minutes in the oven and omitted the carrots. I think next time I will take a previous cooks suggestion and use lean hamburger with half chicken stock and half beef stock. The flavor of the turkey meatballs was good but the texture was a little dry.

Rating: 3
My family and I really enjoyed this soup. Although I didn't mind the flavor of the meatballs, I think they would have benefitted from a light browning in a saute pan before hitting the soup. I used Kale because I had some in the fridge. Not ideal for the summer - but we love soups all year round!

This soup was great, but I did make some changes. I used 93% lean beef for the meatballs instead of turkey, left out the carrot and used half chicken broth/half beef broth as my soup base. Yummy!!

My family loves this soup. Even my 3 year old! I can never find escarole, so I use kale, and it is excellent. The meatballs are so good, I am going to use them with pasta too. And of course my favorite part is that it takes no time to make!

This soup was great. I substituted spinach because I have way too much of it but will try with escarole in the future just because. I also did not add the orzo until I put the meatballs in as I didn't want to over cook it.

Very decent family fare. I compared the two recipes for escarole soup with turkey meatballs and decided to incorporate the scallions from the other receipe into this one and it was a positive move. Becareful about the orzo. At first you don't think you have enough but you really do. I did not cook the meatballs that long in the broth nor did I add the orzo until closer to the end. I did add 2 teaspoons of Turkey Base from Better than Broth brand along with using the Campbell's Healthy Request Chicken Broth. The Campbell's Healthy request broth is close to home made. It is not easy to find. I used both escarole and spinach and they were fine. I don't think the carrots added anything except color.

This was easy to prepare, which gives it a boost. It's perfectly good, but not terrific. Next time I'll add a few more carrots though. And do add the orzo last.

I really love this soup. It is a perfect comfort food and makes me feel like my mother is cooking for me in the kitchen. I double the recipe and freeze half for a rainy day. I also cook the orzo seperately and pour soup over it before serving it. This soup is now a staple along with my famous chicken soup.

Rating: 2
An easy recipe but nothing exciting, a bit bland. I used really good organic chicken stock (from a box) so it was easy to prepare. Don't think I would make it again but if I did I would try another reviewer's suggestions and saute the meatballs ahead of time. The escarole didn't add any flavor, just texture.

Rating: 2
The soup was just ok. My husband really liked it though. It was a bit bland for my taste. I think next time I'll use beef for the meatballs to give it a bit more flavor. I have 1 question for anyone who has made this recipe befor & really enjoyed it - What type of broth did you use? Maybe if I change the broth it will improve the taste.

Rating: 2
This was allright. Not the best. I would make it again because it was simple to throw together. I thought it was too brothy for extra cheese so I didnt bother. I'll have to find other ways to use my block of Parmigiano-Reggiano that I brought back from Italy last month

I seared the meatballs in olive oil the night before (added more fat but also more flavor - and the thought of just boiled meatballs grossed me out) and added extra broth to the soup. Came out great! My husband and I both loved it.

I used a bag of baby spinach instead of the escarole (I don't even know what escarole is, lol!), and long grain rice instead of orzo. I sauteed the chopped carrots with a chopped onion and some minced garlic in some olive oil before adding the broth, which probably gave it more flavor than the unchanged recipe would have had. Even with my changes, it was simple to make, and the kids really liked it.

This is a delicious, hearty soup. The seasoning for the turkey balls is just perfect. I will make it again; however, with a few changes. I thought the orzo was over cooked and also that there was too much of it. Instead, use only 1/3 cup of orzo and add it when adding the turkey balls, not with the carrots as directed.

My family loved this. I think not browning the meatballs before helps to keep them garlicky. Yum! I did not have low sodium chicken broth and ended up having to add 1 c. of water because it was to salty, but that remedied it. Adding this easy to make soup to my recipe collection.

Had this soup on a cold (for Las Vegas), rainy day. Not quite like a snowy night in Colorado, but did bring back good memories! Seared the meatballs first to add color and made them much smaller and earlier in the day, as others suggested. Great ideas! Plus fun to make with the kids. Quick, easy. Served with flat bread and a mixed green salad. Nice balance and tasty!

This is a wonderful addition to my soup collection. Made it just as it was written , but did it earlier in the day and added the escarole when I reheated it. Big mistake. Everyone was right when they said to do the orzo seperately and then add. All my liquid had been absorbed and I had to add about 2 cups more of broth. Never the less, this is a winner...a welcome change from all the tomato based soups and still very Italian. Added a salad with artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers and avocado, along with a good cibatta from a local bakery. A lovely meal!

My husband and I really enjoyed this soup. It was great on a cold snowy winter night. I added cannelini beans and boiled the orzo separately before adding to the soup. I used the escarole and put in the whole head as we like a lot of greens. It was not too much. We had a wonderful crusty bread and a nice salad with it.

Loved this soup! Used a lb of turkey (it came packaged that way) and a little more broth, but otherwise followed the recipe and it was SO good. I made the meatballs the night before and left them in the fridge till the next night. Very easy recipe, and even easier when meatballs are done ahead of time. A keeper!

This was a great cold day soup. I received my Bon Appetit on a day I couldn't get out to the store, so I used what I had on hand, which meant ground veal instead of turkey and kale instead of escarole. It was delicous and hit the spot. Thank you!

this recipe is alright but need to make a few adjustments in my opinion. I used beef instead of turkey and baked the meatballs to remove fat. I would substitute beef broth for chicken. I added taragon to htis and carmelized onions before hand...otherwise it would be bland...

I made 1-1/2 times the recipe with more of everything - lots of kale - 8 cups of raw chopped, added only for the last five minutes with the orzo. Also sauteed a chopped onion with the carrots in a small amount of olive oil to get things started. To the broth I added thyme, a couple of bay leaves, and a 16-ounce can of diced Contadina tomatoes. Loved it, with a green salad and crusty semolina bread for a Sunday night winter supper. My huband would have preferred just big chunks of chicken instead of the meatballs, so the leftovers are all mine to enjoy.

Rating: 3
Pretty tasty, hearty and reassuringly healthy (I really wish more recipes on this site included nutritional information), but I think searing the meatballs would make the dish look more appetizing. Like others, I added cannelini and increased the escarole; I also served with a squeeze of lemon in addition to some grated Parmesan. The suggestion of using mustard greens in place of the escarole sounds like a great one to me--more texture, and little more bite. I'll use it next time.

I'm making this soup tonight, will be my second time. A very comforting and tasty soup. I was surprised at how flavorful it was since there's not really many ingredients. I was skeptical about the escarole, but it really added a nice flavor and texture. Easy enough for a week night and my eight year old loved it, definately a keeper!

Yes, yes, yes! Such a tasty soup on a cold night. I, too, made the meatballs really small (1/2" or so) so they'd fit on a spoon and be bite-size. This is really hearty and comforting. Used spinach because I couldn't get to the farmers' market and Kroger doesn't apparently know what escarole is. Try this - it's yummy!

Go ahead and double the recipe for the meatballs; they are terrific and will freeze well for another use. The first time, I had never fixed turkey meatballs before and my family thought they were great. The next time I made the meatballs smaller (1/2") and also added some dried tarragon. Even better. I cooked them in the skillet and drained them on paper towels before adding them to the soup. My kids prefer fresh spinach rather than the escarole. Thanks for the barley recommendation -- that was great!

I liked the recipie, however i added onions, garlic, and bay leaves to chicken broth. Canned broth is too bland without some seasoning added. I only added the orzo during the last 10 min otherwise it would have been way over-cooked.

I made this for the "Storm of 2003" here in Washington: 2 feet of snow and I feel fine! I made sure I had all the ingredients on hand before the storm so I'd be ready, and it was worth it. I used grated Romano cheese instead of Parmesian, because that is what I had on hand. I think it tastes great and gives the meatballs enough ummph. Also, I used two boxes of Caprial's Free Range Chicken broth. I would skip that next time and use my trusted Maggi chicken boullion. I think Caprial's broth was slightly lacking in flavor. Also used this little flowerlike pasta I had; didn't have orzo on hand. Wonderful treat to have after digging out my car.

I made this for a soup tasting party and it was the hit! You can make it ahead and just add the escarole at the last minute. Tastes good the next day as well, but I liked it better if I added a bit more broth, plus more escarole.

This is a tasty and filling dinner. I have made it with escarole, with spinach, and with curly endive and they are all delicious. I add more greens than the recipe calls for because I like a lot of greens in my soup. Agree separating the orzo is nice if you aren't serving it all right away, but the orzo does really add body to the soup when it's cooked in the broth. You can always add another can of broth the next day.

This a great soup for a weeknight dinner. It cooks quickly and easily and is very satisfying. I also substituted spinach for the escarole and it was fine. I agree with the other chef about separating the orzo. When I pulled the leftover soup out of the fridge the next day, there was hardly any broth left at all. This is one my husband's new favorites.

Rating: 3
This is a good supper soup, especialy for someone like my husband who likes a heartier soup. I used spinach instead of escarole the first time and we liked it so much that I made it with spinach again. I would say to cook the orzo seperately and add it to bowls as desired if not eating the soup right away, because it does tend to soak up the broth and break down rather quickly.
