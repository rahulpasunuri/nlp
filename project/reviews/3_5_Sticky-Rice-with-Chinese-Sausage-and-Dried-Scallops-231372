Smells yummy, hubby says taste very nice. I did not eat as i am veg....... scallop's price depends on the size and the country it came from, japan has huge but expensive ones, more tasty compare to the china one, smaller and cheaper. lots of work, but worth the effort...

Great recipe, although people should realize a pound of dried scallops is a massive amount, not much of a leap of price from fresh scallops.

I loved this recipe! It was fantastic....And I would also have to agree with "A Cook from Boston, MA" that "Carolemce from Elk Grove" should not be so arrogant as to put a rating on a recipe that she was simply too cheap to make! I went to my local Chinese market and the dried scallops were only $15.00 (CANADIAN) per pound. Even at $49.00 a pound...this recipe is worth it. Some 'people' need to get off their high horse once in a while.

to Carolemce from Elk Grove: did you actually ever make the dish? It's not fair to go on and lower the rating because you had an issue with the cost of an ingredient, especially if you didn't even make the dish. Lots of us use these ratings seriously, deciding whether or not to try something based on them.

I thought this recipe was wonderful. I didn't use dried scallops or the mushroom water....these ingredients would make this dish too fishy. I replaced the dried scallops with chicken and it turned out GREAT! I would definitely make this again.

I love to cook complex dishes and shop at our local Asian supermarket, so I went on a mission to make this dish. I loaded up my basket with ingredients, but could not find the dried scallops. I asked for them, and was directed to a counter where the diamonds, jewelry, and abalone were kept under lock and key; also the dried scallops at $49.00 per pound! Sorry I could not justify it.

Be cautious when choosing your ingredients! "Small" things such as Japanese sweet/sticky rice (and not Japanese short grain rice) and regular lop choong (chinese sausage, not chinese kidney sausage) make a big difference. I liked the recipe, but it's not exactly the complex sticky rice I'm looking for. But until I find it, this'll be my foundation. I like strong flavors, and doubled the hoisin, soy sauce and sesame in this.
