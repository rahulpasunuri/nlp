RAVE reviews for a New Year's brunch. I substituted half a 2/3 cup of milk and 1/3 cup heavy cream (roughly) for the 1 cup of cream (by default - - I had run out of cream because of an earlier recipe). I also made the rounds about 4 1/2 inches in diameter - 9 scones in total. Husband says they're the best ones I've made yet...

These are delicious and will be a regular in my breakfast cycle. As an earlier reviewer suggested, I replaced the lemon rind with orange rind. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and the dough consistency was perfect. I pressed the dough into an 8-inch disc, then cut like a pie into 8 triangles. They turned golden brown in about 22 minutes at 400 degrees.

These were quite yummy and I didn't have problems with the dough, as many others had. Was my first time making scones, so what do I know? I followed the recipe to a T, except I used buttermilk instead of heavy cream. Instead of rolling out the dough, I plunked fist-sized quantities on the baking sheet and made larger scones. Total yield 10 scones. I also placed the batter in the fridge in order to have them a few days in a row. As I said earlier, they were yummy and will make them again in a variety of flavours.

A very yummy savory scone! I like to substitute orange zest for the lemon. I like to pulse my orange zest with my flour to really infuse the orange flavor.

I used regular lemons and found these to be very good and certainly sweet enough, in spite of the stronger lemon flavor and the tartness of the fresh cranberries. I'd reiterate lostdream's 12/05/10 comment that you shouldn't manhandle the dough. I didn't actually find it difficult to work with anyway -- not terribly sticky or wet. This is a terrific way to use leftover, unused cranberries from the holidays, but now that I've tried these, I'll be buying the berries specifically to make these scones.

Family raved. Rated by teens as best scones I have ever made. I agree. Enough said!

Excellent scone recipe but requires good technique. THis is my go-to base scone recipe. I've made it with apples and walnuts, with regular lemons, with dried blueberries. But of course the original is the best. To the people who have had problems with the dough being to soft: yes, this recipe uses a lot of liquid. BUT the trick is to handle it as little as possible. Just give it a few turns with a spatula once you've added liquid. Don't try to incorporate all the flour. Don't try to produce uniform dough. The dough should BARELY come together. DON"T roll it. Divide the dough into two parts. Pat each into a disc (about 3/4 of an inch high), cut each disk into 6 triangles (some of the triangles will be crumbly but they will come together when baked). THese scones can be frozen unbaked. In fact, they benefit from a spell in the freezer, which makes them ideal to make for breakfast: make them the night before and bake in the morning. ENJOY!

These are yummy and my two year old likes them too. I didn't use a food processor and mixed ingredients with my hands. Turned out not to be a problem. Used about 1 and half TBS of lemon zest with regular lemons. Couldn't find Meyers. I was concerned with it coming out too tart since I used fresh cranberries so I cut the amount of lemon zest down. I had big fresh berries so I sliced them in half and used a cup and half. Turned out great. The fresh berries ooze out. Well definitely make again.

I made it note-for-note, and it is a really exceptional recipe. Absolute musts are using cream and using MEYER lemons. The cream will keep the batter/dough from being too thin, and the meyer lemons will be sweeter than regular lemons, which is nice against the cranberries. The scones have a wonderful crispy crust and a luscious moist inside, a not-too-sweet, not-too-sour baking powder bite that makes it scrumptious with coffee. Really great recipe that I will definitely use next time I get my hands on meyer lemons. When oh when will that be?!? (Husband agreed. His comment: "F$$*!&* delicious!" When a scone elicits an explitive, it's a great recipe.)

The batter was really wet and hard to work with. The texture of the final baked good was more like a cake than a scone.

Rating: 4
I almost never bake ANYTHING and have never baked scones in my life, but I made these scones with my daughter on a rainy day....and they turned out beautifully. I added more lemon zest and chopped my cranberries in the processor. I plan to try them again and add new ingredients. For those who had trouble with this recipe there must have been some "user error", because if I can bake these and they turn out perfect...ANYONE can.

Twice I have made these scones and modified the ingredients from Lemon to Tangerine and glazed the finished scones with a powdered sugar, zest and juice combination. (I have also had rave reviews, with comparisons made to Starbuck's Orange Cranberry Scones, I might add) I also agree with CentralValleyCook regarding processing the flour mixture for a longer period. This recipe is incredible as a base scone recipe and I will use this recipe forever!!

Rating: 4
Twice I have made this recipe (to rave reviews, I might add) and I substituted fat-free half and half for the cream. The second time I processed the flour mixture for a bit longer, and patted the dough a bit thinner, and I think the results were better--more of a traditional scone texture. This recipe is SO easy, even with the aforementioned challenge of achieving "just" the right flour liquid ratio to avoid a too-soft dough. I made two circles cutting pie-shaped wedges which I placed on parchment, then brushed with more half and half and sprinkled with sugar. Yum.

Rating: 4
These were awesome! Puffy and light--maybe not scone-like, but great nonetheless. The dough IS very soft, hang with it-- all you have to do is PAT it out, not roll it. The only thing I wish I would have done was sprinkle the tops with just a teeny bit of sanding sugar. I will be making these again for sure.

This was a great and easy recipe. I had only 1/4 cup cream so I substituted marscapone cheese for the remaining cup (which is lower cal than butter, and it follows, than cream). Delicious!

Just sweet enough. Yum!

This a terrible scone recipe. I have now made it twice and both times they came out more like pancakes than scones. I suggest you find a good recipe and just substitute the cranberries and meyer lemons for the raisins. Here try this one, from a wonderful little B&B in German Village, Columbus, OH: 2 cups flour, 2 tsp baking powder, .25 tsp baking soda, .5 tsp salt, 8 tbs unsalted butter,.5 cup buttermilk, 1 egg, lemon zest and fresh cranberries as above. Mix, knead lightly, roll to .75", cut, bake for 12 mins. at 450 F.

Wow, delicious. Definitely chop the cranberries in a food processor. I used old ones too and it was no problem. I halved the recipe (used 1 egg only and rind of one Meyer lemon.)

Rating: 4
Really good. I made them last night and they turned out great despite my old cranberries (a bag I've had in the cupboard since Thanksgiving!). Do youself a favor and chop them in the food processor - it worked great. I used a 1/3 c measure as my cutter and it also worked fine. The dough is sticky but not impossible.

No one believed these would turn out being made in a food processor. They were fantastic and even better the next day. This recipe is definitely a 4 fork saver.

Great scones, worked well in my non-stick scone pan. They were crumbly when loading pan, but very soft and moist while eating.

Has a cookie-like sweetness and it's denser than most scones, but it is delicious!

Rating: 3
I used fresh cranberries but cut them in half and let them drain on a paper towel before putting them in. Meyer Lemons grow in our yard but regular lemon would work just as well. Definitely recommend that you brush the scones with the extra egg white before baking to give them a nice finish. Use very cold butter and the batter holds together when baking. They are super light and puffy when finished not like a traditional scone but delicious anyway.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe. I used orange zet instead of lemon. I brushed the scones with cream and sprinkled with a sugar cinnamon misture before baking. I never roll out scones. They should be wet and its easiest to drop them on baking sheet.

Rating: 3
I was skeptical of how these might turn out when the dough ended up being too sticky to roll out. I opted instead to drop large clumps onto a parchment paper lined tray and they turned out fabulous. Be warned- they spread out pretty far! Used regular lemons and made a glaze of lemon juice and icing sugar. Great feedback from guests. PS Does anyone know if you can freeze scone batter for later use? I understand that you can freeze the finished product and reheat but there is something to be said for having the delicious aroma of baking scones filling the house when guests arrive!

I got rave reviews with these. I didn't have cream so I used whole milk. Used frozen cranberries which I chopped in blender. They were too runny to roll out so dropped them on the baking sheet instead. Came out GREAT, DELICIOUS.

Rating: 4
Made w/spelt flour twice -- wonderful! Dough was wetter than most scone recipes but could be because w/spelt you need more than regular flour. Still turned out beautifully.

Rating: 3
Lovely recipe! I'd never made scones before and am not even much of a baker and they turned out great. I would've liked a stronger lemon flavor. I'll use more zest and/or lemon juice next time I make them. I didn't have access to Meyer lemons and that might have been the reason.

Rating: 3
Really enjoyed these! Nice and light, not too dense. However, I'm always looking for a way to cut back on fat, so I substituted whole milk for the cream and honestly didn't find that it comprimised the taste! I did need to add about another half cup of flour. Enjoy my friends!

Rating: 2
I used frozen cranberries and that was just fine; though the scones were a little on the tart side. (Nothing a spoonful of light whipped cream couldn't take care of!) The dough is really nice in terms of flavor and texture. This is definitely a recipe to play around with.

Rating: 3
I added more lemon and a little more flour when I made these, and dropped them onto the cookie sheet by the spoon. I found them to be delicious, if lighter and cakey-er than regular scones. They're esp. good with whipped cream.

This is an outstanding scone recipe. I had been searching for a great recipe and this is it. It's good with almost any variation although not with frozen berries.

Rating: 1
Too cake-like. Batter was runny; I couldn't roll it out. I had to use muffin tins for the scones to take shape. Two parts flour to one part liquid doesn't seem right. Glad I test ran this before trying to "wow" friends.

This recipe is fabulous. I've been making them for a couple years now and everyone loves them!

Rating: 2
Double the Lemon Zest as others have suggested. These scones are on the cakey-side, but still quite good. This recipe requires good technique. Handle the dough as little and as quickly as possible. If you still have difficulties handling the dough, then drop by tablespoonful onto baking sheet.

Rating: 2
I wouldn't make this recipe again. The dough was way too sticky, and I didn't think the final result was worth all of the hassle. The scones are very lightly flavored.

Rating: 3
The dough was very sticky- I had to add 1/4 to 1/2 cup more flour. I would also use the egg white left over from the single egg yolk ingredient next time brushed on top of the scones before baking to make the top more golden. But, they were absolutely delicious- love the lemon and cranberry tang.

Rating: 2
These were too cakey to be scones, I like mine a little more dense. After taking the zest, I mixed some of the meyer lemon juice with powder sugar to make a glaze. The glaze completely absorbed into the scones and made them really mushy. There must be a better way to use yummy meyer lemons, no?

Rating: 1
I rated this recipe low because the dough was very hard to work with and the scones came out like cookies rather than scones. I used regular lemons vs meyer lemons and the scones are very bland.

Rating: 4
This is the BEST scone recipe I've ever made! I've been on the hunt for a great for a long time and this is it! The scones were moist (yay!) and sweet but lemon gave it a great "zing." I've given the recipe to all my friends...it's excellent.

Rating: 4
I really like these scones. I'm a big fan of Starbucks lemon poppy seed scones and I found these to be lighter and more flavorful. I tried putting a lemon frosting on them, but found they were better without. I froze a few of the leftovers and they even taste good defrosted in the microwave.

Rating: 2
These were tasty, but I found the dough to be really soft and hard to work with. It spread even more than I expected during baking and I ended up with mutant connected scones. Maybe I has problems because I used creme fraiche in the recipe rather than cream, but I'd rather look for another recipe rather than try this one again. These tasted more like light Bisquick-texture biscuits than what I think of as scones.

Rating: 4
My favorite scone recipe ever. Meyer lemons are great in this. I've used lavender and currants instead of lemon and cranberries; also rosemary and pinenuts-- great results every time. I make the dough in the evening, cut it and put it on the cookie sheet in the refrigerator overnight and bake them fresh in the morning.

Rating: 4
Delicious and simple. And yes -- more ZEST is even better. The Meyer lemons are a must. I used heart and crescent moon shaped cutters for more fun results.

These scones are delicious, although I added an additional 1/2 cup of fresh cranberries and I used half and half instead of heavy cream.

Good good good! I substitued 1/2 wholewheat flour for a bit more substance. I also used frozen cranberries, but did not thaw them before adding them to the batter - this way, no extra flour is required!

Rating: 3
Outstanding scones.I used frozen cranberries (thawed before adding).Maybe this added extra water,but my batter was way too thin to roll and cut out disks.I ended up putting in 3/4 extra cup of flour,and still I had to spoon batter onto sheet like cookie dough.But they still came out great!

Rating: 3
These are great scones, but I found them a little dry. The addition of whipped cream makes them just right!!! Next time I make them I will add even more lemon zest - 2 tablespoons gives them just a slight lemony flavor.

My favorite scone recipe. A Swiss bakery in this area has a reputation for producing the best scones around, and I've been trying to replicate their recipe for years. This recipe comes very close. I sometimes substitute oranges for the lemons, and it's also wonderful.

Rating: 4
This is the PERFECT recipe for scones. I sometimes use citrus zest (lemon or orange) but find that if you omit it, the scones are still heavenly. I often substitute other dried fruit such as cherries or blueberries. I love these scones because they are moist, tender and cakey. I think the addition of butter and egg makes a difference. Many other scone recipes just use heavy cream as the only fat and the resulting scones are about as tender as paperweights. I made these for visiting in-laws and they could barely talk, they were so happy stuffing these scones into their mouths!

Yummy scone! The texture is just right and we made this several times already

Rating: 3
I really enjoyed these with the light sweet lemon flavor of the Meyer lemons and the sweet/tart chewiness of the cranberries. They were not too sweet, just right for scones. I would make these again.

Rating: 3
These are great. Since Meyer lemons are not available to me, I used regular lemons. I've made this recipe twice. The first time, I used the cream called for in the recipe & they were delightful. The second time, I substituted milk & the outcome was disastrous as the dough was too sticky and wouldn't hold together. The additional flour I added to create a doughier consistency really hurt the flavor of the final product. I think you'd need to substitute less than 1 cup of milk for the cream. Next time, I'm just sticking to the cream.

An excellent breakfast treat. I substituted milk for the cream the second time I made them and they were still excellent,just a little lower in fat content.

These were a delicious,tender scone that tasted fine with regular store bought lemons.
