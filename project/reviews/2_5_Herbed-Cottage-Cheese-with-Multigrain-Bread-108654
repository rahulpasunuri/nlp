I read what another reviewer said about using organic cottage cheese and so I bought Nancy's. Big mistake! Nancy's is sour. I've never had sour cottage cheese before. Didn't know it existed. The result was inedible. But even if I had the right kind of cottage cheese, I think this recipe would have been very mediocre.

I think the type of cottage cheese used makes a huge difference. Cottage cheese with varied curd sizes provides a better texture and more flavor. Surprisingly, Alberson's grocery stores house brand is pretty decent. Otherwise I suggest using organic brands rather than traditional cottage cheese with uniform curds.

Don't add the water and add purple onion as suggested by wise chef below. Then substitute cream cheese for cottage cheese. You now have a completely different recipe. But at least you can eat it. This one is awful.

This is alright. It doesn't taste teriffic, but it's a healthy addition to bread or crackers because of its protein content.

This wasn't the greatest but it wasn't too bad either. Did not add the water but did add some minced purple onion. I bought some really great, dense German bread at the deli and topped it with the spread and a tomato slice. For low-fat it'll do!

wonderfully healthy and flovorful. Plan to try with other herbs. Think it would adapt well too with fruit and spice as a sweet breakfast treat or dessert.
