I think my oven is not as hot as it says though because I had to increase the baking time to 2 hours. I recommend using cashew halves and pieces, not whole raw ones, so they will cook as quickly as the pecans and walnuts. Followed one suggestion from here to use increased chili: was a great tip. On my second batch, I actually increased all the spices, including the salt and sugar by 1/2 again as much each. Do make sure to include the candied ginger at the end: it's such a great surprise and really makes this recipe addictive.

These are awesome! Have been making them since the recipe was published. At my parties, they are the first thing to go.

LOVE making this for a party! When I had a ladies clothing boutique in Door County, I would make a huge bowl of this and serve with wine at my after hours Customer Appreciation party. It was always a welcome treat! Enjoy Kate!

these were only OK --- I didn't care for them very well but understand that it may have been my particular blend of chili powder spices ---- probably will not make again

I've made these every year since the recipe was published in 2003. Friends and family would riot if I skipped a year. The crystalized ginger is a must. It helps with the sweetness, for those who don't find it sweet enough. If you've found it bland, I'd bet your spices were past their prime.

I've made this for 5 years now, and always get a good reaction. Try substituting coriander for the cumin, and don't skimp on the chipotle. I double what is suggested here.

I don't eat nuts but I made this for my nut-loving Significant Other and a fall party. Everyone loved them! I didn't change a thing and used all ingredients and quantities as recommended. I am going to make them again as a Christmas gift. I could not find matchstick crystalized ginger anywhere - not even on line - so i did not use this add-on.

I'm surprised at the number of more recent reviewers who were unhappy with this recipe. I've been making it for years and it ALWAYS gets rave reviews, in fact people remind me before the holidays that they will be expecting these nuts! Be sure your spices are fresh (I buy bags at Penzey's and keep them in the freezer for longevity) and of course adjust to your personal preference; in my book, the spicier, the better. I am not a big walnut fan so I substitute whole almonds; perhaps this modification has some bearing on the overall result. Please don't hesitate to try this terrific recipe, adjusting it to suit your own taste!

For all the spices that go into these, I didn't think they had much flavor. Also, an hour of baking was plenty, maybe even too much. They sure look spicy, but.....

The mix was great to chop up and put on salads with the leftovers I had from a cocktail party.

These were ok - not great. They were flavorful, but not hot enough or sweet enough - I even added extra cayenne pepper.

Perfect! Served without the candied ginger because I ran out of time, and loved it SO much as is, not sure I would even add it. Perfect and perfectly easy too, YUM YUM YUM. Nicely spiced if you use chipotle. I also added a wee but more sugar. I made a 1/2 batch, and am kicking myself I did not make more. Also, used some of the spice mixture on lamb - then served the lamb on cumin papads with tomato lemongrass jam. TO DIE FOR!!!

Very good, nice and spicy. I'd say chipotle chili powder is a must - they wouldn't have the same depth of flavor otherwise. I do wish they had a sweeter taste, but that's just my preference. I may increase the sugar next time.

Delicious! I added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of chili powder and 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne

I made these exactly as written including chipotle powder but they were flat and bland. I did not serve them. Big waste.

These were DELICIOUS!!! However we didn't find them to have any heat at all. Maybe because we used regular chili powder? I will definitely make them again, and try to add some heat.

for those of you who didn't like this...you must have done something wrong...when i make them i can't keep them in the house....at parties they're a huge hit

Loved it. I would use a little less salt. I also added a bit of maple syrup which pepped up the flavor.

Flavor was bland. Didn't add the garlic powder because I didn't have any. Not sure if it would have made a difference though. Overall, disappointing.

These were so-so, nothing spectacular. They need more sugar, cinammon & chipotle powder. The ginger is a nice addition.

OH... MY...!!! Just as described. Bought organic nuts at the Wild Oats bulk bin. Added extra candied ginger like others suggested and am glad I did. Surprisingly less spicy than I expected -- the five-spice flavor got subdued in the baking process. I doubled the recipe and am going to make one more batch -- when you think of people grabbing handfuls, 6 cups can quickly disappear. Will make this again and again and again. A sure-fire party pleaser.

Divine. Delicious. Added some almonds to the mix. The recipe has the right balance of flavors. Served to the book club ladies when we read The Ice Queen by Alice Hoffman. The lead character had been struck by lightning: Fire and Spice...so appropriate. Especially when accompanied by the Jersey Lightning cocktail. Would absolutely make these again.

LOVE these nuts! I used a combination of cashews and macadamia nuts to go with an Island themed party -- excellent with Mai Tai's! I will add extra candied ginger next time.

Why use parchement paper? With non-stick pans ,it just gets in the way and makes more work. I used it and it stuck to the nuts so I couldn't turn them and then couldn't get the paper off the back of the nuts. It's edible but sooo useless!! HAd some great walnuts at HEidel House, Green Lake, WI. and would love to have THAT recipe.

I've done a few different spiced nut recipes and they all seem to be similar. I did like this one, however, because I could use up some of the five spice powder I have and rarely use. Worth doing again.

The ginger is a must. These were quite tasty...and easy. Great for parties.

I made these for a cocktail party and they were the hit of the night. Before I knew it they were gone! I am making them again for a halloween dinner party Sunday night.

Have made these a few times, always to rave reviews, and have another batch in the oven even as we speak. I and my guests loved the spicy/sweet/hot flavors. I tripled the amount of crystallized ginger, since I'm a huge fan, and it just brings out the spiciness of the nuts that much more. A definite must-have munchie!

My dinner guests loved these nuts. I used a little less sugar, salt, and chipotle (because I was serving to folks who don't like tons of hot spice) and found that I probably could have used full amount of chipotle. I didn't know what stir every 20 mins meant, so I used a spatula and flipped them about every 30 mins. That worked fine. The nuts were more flavorful a day or two after baking. Very easy.

Store-bought mixed nuts are so salty so this recipe was a welcome change. It's good as written but you can spice it up as much (or as little) as you like. I used more chipotle and the ginger added terrific snap.

I love the technique and the depth of flavor of these nuts - not to mention how easy they are - but I found the cumin overwhelming, and so would half it next time, and increase the cinnamon and chipotle/cayenne powder.

These were so yummy that I can't wait to make another batch. The only thing that I would change would be to slightly increase the amt of sugar.

I made these as Christmas gifts this year, and had to make a second batch after we ate most of the first straight from the pan! I left out the ginger and forgot to add the sugar, but these were still absolutely delicious. Using chipolte powder is key. I used raw pecans, almonds, and cashews.

I used pecans and almonds. Because there is a diabetic in the family, I substituted Splenda for the sugar. They were delicious!

These were wonderful! I used a combination of pecans, cashews, and almonds (instead of walnuts). Baked about 3/4 of the time specified.

We thought these were wonderful. I served them as a snack before grilled chicken salad sandwiches. The next night I put them on a garden fresh salad with a light vinagrette. Wasn't sure how the flavors would mingle but it turned out to be a delicious suprise.

These don't last long around our kitchen. These spicy treats are eaten as fast as we can make them. They're great in Chicken Salads and on Baked Potatoes.
