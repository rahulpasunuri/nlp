I have learned when making Yorkshire puddings (at least with my temperamental gas stove)to always use heaping cups of flour. Guarantees a perfect pudding that pops and THEN sinks. Yum! These were delicious and I also added about a tablespoon of minced garlic to go with an Italian themed meal. Mouth watering!

These were easy to make and tasted fantastic. The proportions of the mix to muffin cups was a little off for me. I had extra batter.

I thought these popovers were unbelievably delicious! And so too did my dinner guests. No complaints. We didn't find them too eggy like others. The texture went perfectly with the rib roast and porcini sauce, soaking up the juices. They cooked exactly as suggested, the only problem was they stuck horribly in my muffin tin so it left for a messy clean up after dinner. However, they did not burn or appear faulty when plated. They added something special to the dish.

I loved the texture of these popovers even for breakfast the next day. They were much egg-ier than I am used to and not everyone in my family liked them.

I haven't made popovers in years and I admit that some of the reviews had me concerned. I made them for New Year's Eve and they came out fantastic. I didn't have time to chill the batter and I didn't heat the pan - but wow, these were great, my guests were impressed!

The first time I made these they fell, the next 2 times they were perfect. I also chill the batter, but then allow it to come to room tempeture. light, tasty, soo better than biscuits. p.s. half the recipe.

These were the best I've ever had! I followed one of the reviewers suggestions and they turned out so light and fluffy. Sift flour, chill batter and pre-heat pan. I highly recommend.

Very good popovers. Pan doesn't need 3 tablespoons of butter, I'd use way less next time.

If you like popovers you'll LOVE this recipe. I made them without cheese and they were exceptional. The recipe made 18 popovers in a regular sized muffin pan. They are paired well with the Standing Rib Roast with Porcini Bacon Sauce.

I thought these popovers were great, although they are a bit temperamental to make. The first batch looked beautiful, the second batch, not so good, but both batches tasted great.

Very good, I am a Yorkshire lass, so I know my Yorkshire puds! These are great, made the whole recipe to go with a beef dinner. Easily fed 3 people 4 puds each with leftover batter. Am going to use that today as Toad in the Hole. (In a roasting pan place cooked cabbage + tomatoes(if desired) on the bottom, pour batter on top add chunks of thick sausage, sprimkle with cheese and cook till golden brown. Serve and enjoy--my version of the recipe:-)

I have made these 3 times with great results. But there are a couple of tricks. First chill the batter. I don't bother with making sure the eggs and milk are room temp since I'm going to chill them anyway. Sift the flour. Most of important of all preheat the pan for 3 or 4 minutes before adding the batter. I make a half recipe which is perfect for a popover pan with six deep cups. I also use all the paremas cheese called for and all the green onion. My popovers rise more than an inch above the pan. Perfect. Also I use Baker's Joy since my pan is not nonstick.

Made these for Christmas dinner using the methods from Cook's Illustrated for making popovers. The best Yorkshire Pudding I have ever had.

Made these for a holiday dinner and they were a hit. Also were extraordinarily easy to make. Took them into a work the next day and were also a hit for breakfast

We made these for our Christmas dinner. They turned out perfect! The only difference in our results is that the recipe made many more popovers than what was suggested. They were a huge hit with everyone!

Everyone keeps complaining about these falling/collapsing... the pre-directions distinctly say they are more like Yorkshire Puddings... ergo they WILL collapse! If you don't like Yorkshires, don't try this!

Yuck! Wished I would have made potatoes instead.

I can only add "amen' to the other discerning comments about this recipe. There is something seriously wrong with this recipe.

These sounded so good and even smelled good baking. But..... they fell and were very sad and eggy. Will not do again.

The result was good - but it took realizing the recipe was ALREADY doubled to make adjustments ending up with 12 large and 24 small popovers with batter still to be discarded. Too bad the editors were ahead of themselves on the comment!

Rating: 3
The recipe did make MUCH more batter than I expected. I doubled the recipe thinking I would need the extra popovers for my bread lovers. I ended up having to throw a lot of my batter away. People raved about them and I felt fairly proud. I have never made a popover in my life.

This was my first attempt at popovers so I didn't know quite what to expect and I made them before these reviews were posted. The recipe does make 2 dozen. They are quite delicious as a side dish. The green onion in the batter is a tasty unexpected flavor. I did have the trouble of the butter bubbling out of the pan and it made a smoking disaster of my oven, however. Had to take the battery out of the smoke detector and open a few windows. My guests loved it - both the near fire and the popovers!

Not only was the yield double what the recipe said, but -- following the directions to the letter -- I wound up with muffins instead of popovers. I've made popovers many times in the past, and the recipe seemed a bit off to me. I forged ahead anyway, and wound up sorely disappointed.

Is there a misprint in this recipe? I used popover pans and had double the amount of batter needed. They puffed up almost enough to be convincing, looked pretty, and the parmesan cheese dusting smelled heavenly when they came out of the pans. BUT... talk about heavy as lead, and waaay too egg-ey! Not the right texture or flavor at all. None of my dinner guests would eat them after the first bite. What a waste. I used the leftover batter in a frittata.

Made this recipe for Christmas dinner and was very disappointed in how heavy they were. The puffed up really nice while baking and did collapse when removed from the oven. The flavor is great just a consistency problem.

This is absurd. I had two dozen, too. Turned out fine. Will look for a different recipe.

Made these exactly as the recipe stated and had enough batter left over to fill another 12 cup cupcake pan! They also did not rise to meet my critera of a popover. Tasty, but I'm glad my dinner guests were all old friends and very understanding! I'll stick to my Mom's tried and true recipe in the future.

I'm relieved to read others also found a discrepancy in the yield/batter amount. Also, these are not in fact popovers, which usually do stay puffed after baking, but rather more like Yorkshire puddings, which always collapse in the center after baking (see the introductory note on the recipe and note the collapsed "popover" in the photo). If you want something that will stay puffed after you take them out of the oven, this is not the recipe for you.

After reading the reviews I was a little nervous about this recipe. So I wanted to make it once, prior to our christmas dinner to try it out. I devided the recipe in half to only make 6 popovers. I made sure the eggs and whole milk were room temp, I also sifted the flour. Then as an added precaution, I put the greased pan in the preheated oven for 2 min. Since we have a convection oven, bake time for 6 large popovers (in a popover pan, not a muffin pan) is 46-47 min. The popovers came out perfect, they tumbled out of the pan and were puffy and light. With a little extra care these popovers are quite a treat and we will have them with our christmas dinner.

I'm a pretty good cook but don't know what happened here. Have never made popovers since I thought you needed more than the cupcake racks indicated in the recipe. Made the recipe as stated and they went 'Plop' as soon as they were out of the oven. The flavor was good and I had a friendly crowd so it wasn't a disaster. As previously stated in the reviews, there was more batter than indicated. Should have been prepared to pour more. A good idea that didn't work.

Looked good and tasted very good. But -- though the previous reviewer didn't mention it -- I think the yield is wrong. I cut the recipe in half, but instead of enough for just 6 small (1/3-cup) popovers, I had enough batter (and enough brushing butter and enough dusting cheese) for all 12 small popovers. Normally I'd think I just intended to halve the recipe but screwed up, but this time I did the whole mise en place thing and double-checked that all quantities were halved. Would be interested to hear whether others had this problem.

Very tasty.If you chill the batter and pour into hot pan your popovers will rise perfectly.I make popovers a lot and these rated high in my book
