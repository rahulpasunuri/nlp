A delicious way to serve potatoes and turnips. We were short on turnips, though, so we added some carrots to the mix, which turned out great. For proper browning, I second the suggestion to use 2 skillets. I halved the recipe and my veggies crisped up nicely.

Very good. I used a 12" cast iron pan and the dish turned out great. I used 3 medium turnips and about 4 medium sized potatoes ... and I used 4 slices bacon and then drained the grease. I did add a little olive oil since the pan seemed a little dry during cooking. Will definitely make again. These would be cook with pork too.

I made a much smaller serving than the recipe suggested and it was perfect as a side for 3 people. It received rave reviews from everyone. Will definitely make this again!

Delightfully good! We sliced the onion in a mandoline for super fine strings which blended well and made the vegetables easier to turn. The more we turned them the better they browned. The flavors were great and the oil was absorbed so the dish was not greasey. Next time, and we do plan to make this again, we will use two pans as suggested below.

Thanks for all the recipe tips. I cubed the veggies smaller, eliminated the oil, and didn't worry over the browning. I thought the leftovers(and there were few) would be a good addition to pea soup. Next time I think I'll try vegetarian, putting the oil back in, using cider vinegar and a little liquid smoke.

The flavor of this dish was very nice, but I found there to be too much fat. With the fat that is rendered off a half pound of bacon, I see no need for the additional 2 tbsp of oil. The bacon was so overpowering we couldn't even taste the vinegar. As others noted, the vegetables never did crisp up.

Ok it was delicious, but I got one question. How big is Lidia's pan that she could spread out all those veggies enough to get a nice even browning? haha I would definitely heed the suggestions below to brown the vegetables in the oven after they absorb the delicious vinegar. This is a great use for turnips. I grow a huge turnip patch every fall because I think its written somewhere that southerners are supposed to grow and each lots of turnip greens. I love my fair share of greens but I love the turnips even more. This is a great use for them.

Served these along with most of the Lidia menu for a dinner party and had terrible results. They never browned up like in the photo. If I were to try again I would simply roast them in a hot oven until brown & crisp, as on the stovetop mine were mushy and not browned. Flavor was good however.

delicious. I used pancetta instead of bacon. Cooking time was significantly longer than stated, and even needed time in 400 degree oven (with the pork tenderloin I served with it). Next time I would reduce the amount of potatoes and turnips to 1 lb each and slice into smaller cubes.

Tasty, and good use for aging turnips, but I wouldn't rush out to buy any just to make it. Had with grilled chicken, squash, and salad.

Absolutely delicious! I cooked the turnip and potato mixture for less than recommended and split the mixture between 2 cast iron skillets afterwards to properly brown them.

Taste was good (we like the mix of turnips & potatoes), but texture was off -- the potatoes were a mush, causing the whole thing to stick terribly, & the turnips were still crunchy.

My husband is not a turnip fan but he thoroughly enjoyed the blend of vegies and even had a second helping. Served with braised red cabbage and a pork roast. Yum -- a great way to enjoy early fall.
