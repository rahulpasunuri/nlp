Didn't quite have enough leftover rice (.75 cup) and I added desiccated unsweetened coconut (roughly .25 cup). Oh boy these were yummy. Next time will serve with macerated mango.

These waffles were very good, but I was a little disappointed that they took so much work and tasted almost the same as regular waffles.
