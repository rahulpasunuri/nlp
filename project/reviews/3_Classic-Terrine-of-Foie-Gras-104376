I have not tried this. I found the directions very obscure.

I prepare this 3 days ahead of the dinner party..My classic approach is to let the foies sit in a milk bath for 1-1.5 hours (this neutralizes the blood), allow to come to room temp,then mix a small amount of cognac and porto and a small amount of salt/pepper and pour over the foies and flip them over from time to time. 5-6 hours is good - but please note - use only a puddle of this mélange...then into the oven, heated to 120°C - cook for 30 min in a bain marie and then take the temp of the centre of the foie, which should be around 70°C, and the foie will have released a huge amount of fat (the gras!)Gently pour off the fat when the terrine is cool enough to handle, and reserve - I use this to fry up potatoes...Cover the terrine and let sit in the refrigerator for a day or two. The terrine should be a pinkish blondish colour and of a firm consistency. served with fresh pain de mie (white bread I think) and this is heaven.

A few tips when woring with foie gras. Make sure the lobes of foie gras are at room temp before deveining (it will be easier to work with). Marinating them in milk for an hour or two before cooking will help bleach out any unwantd redness left from veins.

Colin, in case you are looking again this Christmas, there is no "recipe" for foie gras. It is just cooked duck liver. This is how to cook it.

WHERE IS THE RECIPE???

A tasty treatment of a classic dish. An aside note to the "cook" from Philadelphia. When you made your identical inappropriate comment a year ago, you were told to take your 'soapbox' elsewhere. A 'protest' made unconstructively is merely noise from a loud-mouth in a parking lot.

I made this with several pieces of fresh foie de canard and put sliced truffle between the pieces. Used cognac instead of sauternes. Covered the terrine with bay leaves and aspic. It served 8 as an entrée, with half left over. I'd certainly make it again.
