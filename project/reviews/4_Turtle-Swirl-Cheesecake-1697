Took this to a dinner party and everyone raved. Followed others' suggestions and used only 1 c sugar and 4 eggs. Used a water bath and no cracks. Made it 2 days ahead and added caramel and pecan toppings right before taking. This is scrumptious and a beautiful presentation.

Delicious! I made this cake for a charity auction and it brought $275! I usually make this as directed. If you can find Nabisco's chocolate wafer cookies (no filling, kind of like vanilla wafers only thinner and of course, chocolate) or Oreo crumbs (sometimes in the baking section of the store), they make a nice crust. Sometimes I get cracks, sometimes I don't. Cracks aren't just the result of ingredients. If you don't want to hassle with a water bath, try baking the cake with a pan of water on the rack below it. I have found that letting the cake cool VERY slowly helps reduce cracking. (e.g.,Over the course of 90 minutes or so turn off oven, then open door, then move to counter, then move to frig.) Mrs. Richardson's sauce is a great topping. I will put whole pecans on the top along with crushed--especially if I need to cover some cracks. Cracks happen. Not the end of the world!

This cheesecake has been in my repertoire from the day it was published! It never disappoints and everyone loves it! I add a bit more chocolate to get a richer effect, and make my own caramel sauce: It takes very little time, and makes such a difference! For an elegant presentation, I arrange whole pecans around the circumference of the cake and put a few in the centre in the shape of a flower.

I made this for a dinner party and it went over fantastically! I only made 3/4 of the filling and was happy with the result. I did not have a problem with the swirling process. I made my own caramel (barefoot contessa's recipe) as well. It was the hit of the night!

I made this cheesecake for a family party. They all absolutely loved it. We all agreed this is the best cheesecake we have ever had. I will definately keep this recipe. I did put the caramel on top of the chocolate and swirl it like several people recommended. So yummy!

This recipe will leave your family and friends begging for more! Not a crumb is ever left on their plate-- it's that good! I've made this recipe at least 10 times. The first try gave me a cracked cheesecake, and it was a tiny bit too sweet, but still fabulous nonetheless. Since then, I use between 3/4 to 1 cup of pure cane sugar, and I always add a pan of water on the rack below to minimize cracking. Modifications or not, you're bound to get rave reviews on taste and presentation!!! Enjoy!

I made this recipe many times following the directions exactly and it has turned out perfect every time. When ever I am asked to bring something to a party or event this is what they ask for. I don't have a problem with the chocolate as I lightly drizzle it on the filling and then swirl it in. It is fabulous!

Well, I would like to start off by saying that I love this website-every recipe I've tried has worked out perfectly. As for this recipe, it was amazing and you'd have to really mess it up to make it bad. It's a friggin' cheesecake, for crying out loud. ediesn from Arkansas should use one less egg if she's having problems with the consistency of the batter. It's that simple, and I'm amazed she didn't think of it herself, especially if she's made the cheesecake four times, like she claims. So if you can't bake, don't try to bake. It would be a waste of good money.

I love this cheesecake. I have made it several times and it never fails to impress. I am giving it 3 forks instead of 4 because there is something about the directions in the recipe that never works right for me. It says to spoon the chocolate over the cream cheese mixture and swirl them together. I can't imagine how this would be possible. Oh, I do it, but the chocolate instantly sinks to the bottom, because the cream cheese mixture is way too thin to support it, if you know what I mean. They don't "swirl" together very well at all. I think the cream cheese part should be thicker. Still, it turns out fine in the end and tastes wonderful. Oh, and don't pour the caramel on until the second you serve it, because it just runs off the sides and makes a sticky mess. (Maybe everyone else already knew that.)

Wonderful... Of course, I made some changes also. I swirled the caramel into the batter along with the chocolate. Then I served it with hot fudge sauce as well as caramel. Everyone raved!!!!

Excellent, but I made several changes. I used Heather of Wisconsin's suggestions for the crust, but I used chocolate wafer cookie crumbs and just 2 T. white sugar with the 4 T. brown sugar. I cut the eggs down to 4, and I made my own caramel sauce. I bought Smucker's caramel "flavored" sauce, and tasted it, and didn't care for it, so I made it using 1 c. sugar and 3/4 c. heavy cream. I put about half of the caramel on top of the cold chocolate crust, then reserved the other half. Just before serving I drizzled half of the remaining caramel over the top, then put roughly chopped pecans over, then passed the remaining caramel. This was one of 4 large cheesecakes I made for a picnic at my home, and all were excellent, but this seemed to go first.

Took one taste and threw the rest out. What a waste.

I don't know where I went wrong but the middle layer of chocolate pushed to the sides when I poured on the top layer of cream cheese and the top cracked even though I used a water bath. The best thing about this was the topping. Probably won't try this again since there are so many other great cheesecake recipes available.

Okay, let me start by saying I cook big dinners for family & friends just about every week. Being Southern Californians the friut usually goes a lot fater than the desserts. That being said, my guests were actually LICKING THE CAKE PLATE when this was all gone. This was fantastic- super yum yum. I made some slight modifications (sorry-- how annoying to rate it when it isn't the same exact recipe but I can never follow directions to a T) Anyway-- I made my own dulce de leche by boiling condenced milk for a few hours in the can. (do at your own risk I am always terrified it will explode on me!) I mixed the chocolate mixture some of the cheesecake mixture before I swirled it and that worked really well. I topped it w/ the dulche de leche. I wish I could eat this for breakfast, lunch & dinner. I will make this aagin or my guests will riot

YUM! I have made this twice. The first time I omitted the vanilla by mistake and it still tasted great. I get a great Mexican goat's milk caramel topping at Walmart of all places. An 8 ounce package of the bite size oreos makes shorter work of the mashing for the crust. This is great and really simple for the way it tastes!

This was really delicious. I made my own caramel by cooking condensed milk - much better than the store-bought stuff. The amount of chocolate was good - not too much that you couldn't taste the plain cheesecake.

Rating: 4
This was very impressive. No one believed I made it. It looks spectacular and tastes rich and not too sweet. And- best of all- it HAS to be made the day before!! From the recipe I made 2 smaller cakes in 2 separate, smaller, springform pans. And even though the cakes cracked on top (I didn't use a waterbath), after they chilled overnight, there was no cracking visible. They were beautiful! I served mine with Mrs. Richardson's butterscotch caramel sauce and it was great. I think if I'd used the butterscotch/caramel/fudge it would have been too sweet. This was perfect.

This was the best cheesecake I have ever made and not that difficult. Served it to a group of women today and everyone thought it was from a bakery. I followed others suggestions of cooking it in a water bath (which I had never done before) and it never cracked and the crust was moist, not hard. Loved it, this is a keeper!!

Excellent basic recipe, I varied it a great deal. I used oreo crumbs, half of the cream cheese was reduced fat and I combined the chocolate with half of the batter to create the swirl - plan to increase the chocolate next time. I also made my own sauce and sprinkled miniature semi-sweet chocolate chips and pecans on top. I took it to work and everyone wanted to know where I bought it. Very creamy and rich.

Rating: 4
Terrific recipe! I varied it (well, I sort of misread the recipe...) and swirled in the caramel fudge sauce instead of the chocolate cream mixture. It was unbelievable! I used Oreo cookies and ground them in the Cuisinart for the crust. I also cooked the cheesecake in a waterbath and did not have a cracked top. It was beautifully browned with the swirls just peeking through the top. There was no need to serve extra sauce on the side, because my "technical mistake" made the sauce ooze out deliciously over the cookie crust...mmmm, delectible! My new favorite cheesecake recipe.

This has to be one of the best cheesecakes I've ever made. Many reviewers had a problem with cracking. I baked mine in a water bath and it was perfect. Also, if you have trouble finding the caramel/butterscotch/chocolate sauce, Smuckers makes a caramel/butterscotch and a fudge sauce (I found them in the ice cream topping section of my grocery store). I mixed two parts caramel/butterscotch and 1 part fudge and it was to die for!

I've made over a hundred cheesecakes and have never made one as disappoinging as this. The cheesecake lacks flavor and character - it's simply a run-of-the-mill cake with some chocolate thrown in. 5 eggs is too many - the cake rises too much, causing it to crack deeply. And what is "butterscotch caramel fudge sauce?" I've never seen a sauce that claims to be all three! Try the Butterscotch Almond cheesecake on this site - far superior.

Rating: 4
Wonderful! Although this cake seems to crack more than others I have made it doesn't take away from the cake. Here is the crust I use that people love the most. 3/4 cup chocolate graham crumbs, 2/3 cup fine chopped pecans, 1/4 cup each white and loose packed brown sugar, 5 TBS butter melted. My look dry but works well. Chill 30+ min. before adding the cake filling. One to try at least once. Of course this is now my standard Bday gift to people and I have yet to hear any complaining!

I made this for a Christmas party, and one good friend asked me where I got it, and couldn't believe that I had made it from scratch! It presents beautifully, but had a little trouble with the swirls disappearing after I baked it. It tasted amazing and was definetly the hit of the party!

This is a very flavorful cheesecake. No matter what a recipe calls for, I always use half regular and half 1/3 less fat cream cheese b/c I don't like that cream cheese taste. That worked really well w/ this cheesecake. Next time, I will add some of the cream cheese mixture to the chocolate mixture. The chocolate seemed too dense for the cream cheese mixture and sank a bit. I used chocoalte graham crackers for the crust. I hate wafers! Using Oreo cookie crumbs is another option.

Heed the advice: use light cream cheese and serve small slices! It's very yummy, especially after the second day. I won't make it again since I prefer another cheesecake that I make, but I did enjoy this and TWO people from the office requested the recipe. Thanks Epicurious!

This recipe is now one of my family's favorites. I did modify it a bit. After the cake cools for a while, I add the caramel sauce, pecans, and some chocolate chips to the top of it and refridgerate. I do suggest small servings...

This cheesecake is incredible, and looks beautiful when served. I always get great comments from this one. One thing I do so it's not so rich is use 2 1/2 blocks of regular cream cheese and 1 1/2 of the lite version. It still comes out just fine, and isn't so heavy. Also, I place the springform pan in a roasting pan and add boiling water until it comes halfway up the sides of the pan and the cheesecake never cracks.

Great Cheesecake, the only suggestion that I have is to cut the sugar down to 3/4 cups, that was still very rich. I also followed the suggestion of putting a pan of water in the bottom of the oven while I baked but I left the temp. at 350 and cooked for an hour, came out great, no cracks.

I modified this recipe by making my own caramel sauce and topping it with toasted pecans. To avoid the cheesecake from cracking I baked it in a water bath at 300 degrees for an hour and 15 minutes. I then cracked open the oven door, dropped the temp. to 225 degrees and baked for another 40 minutes. This recipe is simple and the results are scrumptious.

Fabulous recipe. In order for this not to crack, I cooked at 300 degrees for 1 hour and 40 min, then opened the door to the oven one notch, turned down the oven to 200, and cooked 15 minutes longer. The cake came out perfectly flat and did not crack.
