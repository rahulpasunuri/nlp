I've made this a few times, the only changes I made were using olive oil instead of butter (so my vegan friends could enjoy it), and added one or two chipotles in adobo, and smoothed it all out with a stick blender. The chipotles add a little more heat and a little smoke flavor. Makes you want to rub it all over your face.

I have made this sauce several times. Only once as written. First time was out of need and it was loves. Second time was as written for a party and RAVE reviews. Third time I made it a little less spicy for my guests. I will continue to make this all the time!!!

This is a great bbq recipe. I used Dublin Dr. Pepper (made in Dublin, TX with sugar cane instead of HFCS). You don't taste the sweet Dr. Pepper flavor but it adds a richness to the sauce that we loved. A keeper!

I added a cup of strong black coffee and some mustard......couple extra layers. Everybody loves it!

Great recipe, I have never made my own barbecue sauce before and this was easy and fun to make. I ran out of chili powder but it still turned out fine and I didn't miss it.

This was a surprise. It has a little spice or heat to it, but gave it a nice kick over the usual barbecue sauces. The Dr. Pepper doesn't scream out, but the flavor is rich. Makes for a good dinner story.
