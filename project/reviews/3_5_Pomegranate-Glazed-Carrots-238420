Simple, special, and attractive (Yes, it did come out mahogany for me). I've never been a fan of cooked carrots but these were a big hit with me and my guests. Went great with a Moroccan B'steeya.

Mahogany Color? More like midnight black! We renamed this dish Carrot's Noir and told people it was made with a rare Midwestern root vegetable. Maybe it was the cast iron skillet. That having been said, it was quite tasty and we will make it again. The tartness of the juice offsets the sweetness of the cooked carrots nicely.

Very unique! Had to add a liitle bit of brown sugar to overcome the pucker power of the pomegranate juice. I used Knudsons 100% juice. Will try a different brand next time.
