I omitted the sugar entirely and added some buttermilk to thin out the date mixture a bit. Without that step, I think folding in the eggwhites would not have worked. Overall, this was a good way to use up some dates.

I think to make this 'lighter' the dry ingredients should be added to the dates mixture and then combined with egg whites. The texture is 'dusty' and the flavor is bland. I did cut the sugar as suggested by other reviewers. Not too sweet but not too good, either.

I needed something to use up some dates, and this worked out beautifully. It is light and delicious. I added a little clove and nutmeg, the result is great with coffee. Next time I will use less sugar as suggested by other reviewers.

Great recipe for using up dates!! Tips: I used dry powdered breadcrumbs instead of matzo meal because I didn't have it, and it turned out just great. -Cloves add a better flavor than cardommom in this recipe - 1/3c sugar is more than enough for both, consistency, and sweetness. -dried berries would make a great addition to go with the dates, and add texture to the torte. now officially my favorite date recipe!

Excellent! Added some ground cloves for a little extra zip. I had trouble getting the cake out of the pan so you should probably use a springform or put parchment on the bottom. Also, I added a chocolate glaze to dress it up a bit. Quite good and moist!

Excellent, with the following changes: used half the sugar, twice the orange zest, omitted the cardamom, pecans instead of dates

To the cook from Mexico: I would find a different recipe to use the dates.

I followed this recipe exactly except that I used matzo CAKE meal. The Cook's Note should read MUST be made 2 days ahead....it needs that time to become moist and flavorful.

I just recieved 3 boxes of dates as a gift, but I don´t have matzo meal, what can I use instead?
