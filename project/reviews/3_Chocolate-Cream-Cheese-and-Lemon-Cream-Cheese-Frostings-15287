I made just the chocolate version (1/2 recipe). It made enough to frost ~18 cupcakes. I added 1 tsp vanilla paste which I think helped bring out the taste of he cream cheese. My only criticisms are a) the frosting is very soft at room temperature so I had to keep the cupcakes in the fridge and b) the frosting is slightly grainy.

Made these frostings to go with the buttermilk cupcakes..they taste pretty darn good. Only thing is..my lemony frosting curdled just the tiniest bit, despite mixing. Both are fluffy and yummy, though.

I made these to top the buttermilk cupcakes that were written with this recipe. I used 10 ounces regular cream cheese and one, 16 ounce, box of confectioners sugar. I added finely grated zest of one lemon to the lemon frosting along with the lemon juice. Of the two versions, the lemon was my favorite. It was really creamy and easy to spread. The taste was mild with just a hint of lemon. The chocolate was very good as well, but after a day in the fridge, even after I put it out for two hours to come to room temperature, it was really, really stiff. Whisking didn't really help. I added milk to soften it up but that didn't do much either. In the end I got it on the cupcakes but it was very difficult. I would make it again, but I wouldn't make it in advance. Of course, the kids prefered the chocolate frosting. I liked the fact neither frosting is too sweet.

I MADE THESE FOR A HANNUKA PARTY AND EVERYONE WAS QUITE IMPRESSED. THESE ARE A GREAT ADDITION TO MY STOCK OF EASY RECIPES.

These were both really good, although I preferred the lemon (though all the kids at our block party went for the chocolate). I used them to top the buttermilk cupcakes.

Delcious! I made the chocolate cream cheese frosting for the orange chocolate chip cupcakes and it was fabulous! I would, however, reduce the amount of unsweetened chocolate and maybe up the cream cheese a bit. I felt like the chocolate overpowered the cream cheese.
