I really loved this recipe with changes/additions: Before I steamed the eggplant I sweated out the bitterness (http://nanasfablife.blogspot.com/2010/08/eggplant-prep-salt-sweat-and-rinse.html). I also steamed a yellow and green zucchini which I added to the tomato sauce with the eggplant and tempeh. When I cooked the onion, I also added a red bell pepper, a jalapeño, and 4 small cloves of garlic. Because I used a jalapeño, I omitted the red pepper flakes. For the crust, I used sprouted whole wheat grain instead of all purpose flour (the crust turned out great despite the different flour).

Completely delicious. My local grocery didn't have tempeh - I used half a can of black bean instead. It was great. The biscuit on top as perfect.

I was trying to make something healthy and delicious out of tempeh and some veggies I needed to use up, including an eggplant, so I did a search for tempeh eggplant and found this recipe. I was surprised how simple and tasty it was. Like one of the reviewers suggested, I used less tomato sauce (only 8 ounces instead of 15) and added half a cup of water. I also added some spinach while it was simmering before putting it in the oven. It came out really nicely. The biscuit topping was light and fluffy and rose a lot--in fact, it was almost too much biscuit! Really good though.

I have been scared of tempeh since one debacle years ago. I was pleasantly surprised with it here. Overall, an interesting combination of flavors, not at all bland. I made it in one casserole dish and just cooked it a bit longer. I also didn't have celery but I did have a small bunch of beet greens I wanted to use up, so I chopped them finely and they blended in nicely.

This was delish! My kids were so-so about the capers and fennel - different tastes for them - but this recipe (the vegetable portion) can be easily changed and altered. I added broccoli and carrots. Biscuit dough was wonderful. A great vegan meal.

I try to eat a veg-friendly diet, so I'm always looking for good Vegan/ Vegetarian recipes with a bit of sophistication. This recipe was a winner. Out of convenience, I subbed tofu for tempeh. I also added steamed carrots and zucchini and yellow squash to the veggies. I also layered fresh spinach on top before adding the dough. It looked beautiful and tasted great. It even satisfied a meat-loving friend.

This is actually more of a 2 1/2 fork recipe. The problem is in the proportions of the ingredients. I would suggest using less tomato sauce, halving the balsamic, and adding more veggies, and water. It just has too strong of a tomato saucey flavor that is not thinned by the eggplant alone. The biscuit topping is amazing. I used low fat soy milk and it was light and fluffy.
