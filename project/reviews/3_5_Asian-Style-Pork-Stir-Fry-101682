Very very good! I had thick pork boneless sirloins, and cubed it as one reviewer suggested. Marinated it about 4 hours in a zip-loc baggie, then cooked over med-high heat till just browned. Subtituted snow peas for the green beans but overcooked them - next time will add them fresh. I omitted the orange peel as someone also suggested. I didn't have peanut oil and from searching for substitutes, nothing was right. Out came the jar of natural peanut butter and I skimmed the oil from the top - perfect! Served on white rice - a very flavourful and light - change of pace. Will keep it in my "favourites folder".

Very good! Added half a red pepper and a handful of baby carrots, left out the orange peel.

as per previous reviewers, i doubled the marinade (except ginger), doubled the garlic and halfed the oj. this was fine, but nothing special at all. the only benefit from making this instead of ordering takeout chinese, is that i knew what went into it. tasted fine, just not worth the effort.

This turned out very good the first time I made it - the second time, I doubled the sauce and replaced the chili flakes with chili paste and it was even better.

I must have messed up somewhere. The pork was very tender and delicious, but the green beans were not.

this was a great authentic asian dish. I added almost 1 tbsp. of red pepper flakes to make this extra spicy, and served over rice.

I cut up the meat, and let it marinate that way. Made it easier to cook - I tossed it into the hot pan with the marinade, and then when it was almost done added the orange juice mixture. Thanks for previous posters, I doubled the garlic and only used about half the amount of orange juice. This is very authentic tasting (at least it tastes to me like something good from a Chinese restaurant). This would work well with cut up chicken breasts too.

If you love ginger, you'll love this easy to prepare dish and I just picked up an asian pre marinated pork terderloin and added the recipe marinade to the wok.

We couldn't believe how tender the pork was. We thought it was missing something: actually I think I used too much ginger and it masked some of the other flavors. This is a 2-fork with a lot of potential. I will work to tweek this - it's worth trying again.

My husband and I loved this. Kids wouldn't touch it so my husband was quick to make them hot dogs and ate theirs. I made 1 1/2 times marinade and sauce (except for orange peel) and cut baby carrots into quarters lengthwise. Very tender and flavorful.

I doubled sauce except the orange rind. End results were still very orangy. Also added 2 extra garlic cloves. Marinated for 48 hours. Used 1 whole boneless skinless chicken breast and 1 pork chop. Sliced & cooked meat first & added to sauce at the end. What a nice combination. A real scrumptious dinner.

This was great! I could only marinade it for two hours, and it was wonderful, can't wait to do it for four hours. Beans have a great taste, as does the pork.

This recipe boasts a perfect combination and a wide range of flavours. Especially the orange and the honey give this dish a pleasant taste. The only change I made was slicing the pork in advance and stir-frying it prior to the other ingredients. I served it with basmati rice.

I took the advice of several reviewers and doubled the marinade and sauce. It worked out perfectly. I substituted scallion for orange peel and a little more than doubled the minced garlic, as my gourmet cooking friend in Florida says you can never cook most things with enough garlic. I also added extra crushed red pepper. It was a big hit in our house.

I though it was tasty and easy - I subbed matchstick carrots for the beans as I'm not too crazy about them and it worked really well

Rating: 4
fast, easy, healthy and delicious. i used butterfly pork chops and the juice and rind of one navel orange. served with a fragrant basmati and that seemed to be a particularly good match. great everyday dinner dish. could add carrots and brocoli to make it more of a one-dish dinner. might also try with a precooked dense tofu added in the final stage(pete's brand that comes ready-to-eat, in triangles with dips are also great in stirfries and curries as it holds its shape)

Rating: 3
Easy and tasty recipe. 1st- a 13x2 dish seemed too big for the marinade, the 8x8 worked better. I made the recipe as written with the exception of 2 garlic cloves. I was scraping the pan for any extra sauce so I would double the sauce next time. .

The sauce was delicious! I will be making this one again, maybe with chicken or tofu for variety. Easy and good!

I made a few adjustments - more garlic and more crushed red pepper and added scallions and water chestnuts at the end, but it was yummy. I also omitted the orange zest.

Rating: 3
I thought this was a really good receipe. I did substitute sweet snow peas instead of green beans. Also I left out the orange zest and it had a wonderful citrus flavor with just enough bite with the crushed red pepper. I will certainly make this again.

My wife and I made this dish while we were living in korea. Instread of orange, try lemon. It give it the taste of Thai food(If you have had lemon grass, you know what I'm talking about). We also added mushrooms. I'll try it again.

Too much citrus, but still quite good. Next time I plan to leave out the orange peel, and add either black beans, or a black bean sauce.

Rating: 3
Great dish if you like lots of citrus! Substituted sesame oil in place of peanut oil. Used pre-cut ginger in a jar for convenience. Would definately make again; however, would cut back on the orange peel and/or juice in order to make dish more palatable. Suggestion, make Thai "sticky" rice on side.

This was a very tasty dish; however, I should have followed the review from Phoenix and doubled the marinade. The sauce had a sweet, tangy flavor and I would have liked more of it. Next time!

Went searching for new stir fry ideas today, but ended up back at this recipe again. It is easy, my family loves it. What two better reasons can you have to make a dish again and again. I do add more pork, and double the marinade and sauce. I think I will try adding nuts at the end for some additional crunch.

Very easy to make and very flavorful. My kids devoured it!!!

Sorry Phoenix, but a "more impressive fried rice dish"? Did I miss something? Doubled the sauce, used a 1.3 lb. pork tenderloin, followed directions and it was delicious! Will definitely make again! KIMBER

Very good quick mid-week meal. We have added it to our regular rotation.

This was pretty good, I served it with rice. My pork came out very tender and succulent, I really let it brown on the stove. I used a wok for the 2nd part of the recipe. I think I overcooked the beans, but all in all it was pretty good for a low-fat dinner. My husband liked it too. My son ate the pork but no beans (he's 7).

This was an easy to prepare dish that has an interesting flavor. Maybe too orangey; next time I make it I'll cut back a little on both the juice and the peel. I used broccoli instead of green onions and served it with parmesan couscous that I added small broccoli florets to. Nice dinner to make on a busy weeknight. One more thing: don't cook the pork all the way to 155 degrees-- it will be way too done and tough since it continues to cook once it's off of the stove-- 140 or 145 is fine and the meat is nice and tender.

Not being a fan of green beans I substituted green cabbage. Other than needing more cabbage, we thought it was wonderful. A definite keeper.

A very good recipe, but like others I would also use a little more pork. Otherwise, it was delicious.

I doubled the pork, julienned it then marinated and sauteed it. I added sliced onions and red and yellow bell pepper. I also added three tablespoons of pomegranate concentrate to the sauce, then topped with roasted peanut pieces.

Tasty and easy! Ideal everyday healthy food. I've also tried it with veg (red pepper, onion and carrot) - not recommended - rather stir fry veg seperately.

Very good! Definately use fresh green beans - we could only get canned, and we ended up with "aisan-style pork in green bean mush"... The sauce was very flavourful, although I must say that the ginger was the predominant flavour. Cooked the pork on a bit of stock - we barely felt the sweetness of the OJ. Will make this dish again as soon as we get ahold of those fresh beans! P.S. We added sesame seeds - they added crunchiness, kind of made up for the green bean stew-type texture.

Rating: 3
Very good! I doubled the marinade and the sauce which is desirable if served over rice. Could use 50-100% more pork; the serving sizes are modest. The addition of scallions or onions helps.

Very delicious! I doubled all ingredients (including pork) except the green beans. Served with plain rice. The blend of ginger and orange juice is perfect. Maybe next time I would include snow peas.

Certainly different. I don't cook with ginger very often at all, so this dish was a nice change. Very zingy!

Rating: 3
I thought the marinade was delicious, and so simple to make. I doubled the marinade, and also doubled the sauce. I also added red pepper and onion to the green bean mixture. Next time, I might use stock for 1/2 the O.J. mix, because it was too sweet for my family. But it had a good kick to it, and was excellent over rice.

My husband and I loved this dish. It's hard to believe it's low fat because it has such great flavor. I only blanched the green beans for one minute and they were nice and crisp. I also added a quarter cup green onions. I will make this again and again. Yum!

I made this dish expecting to serve 4 good sized portions, but just not enough pork. My family really enjoyed it though!!

This recipe makes a great one-course dinner ! I made the recipe exactly as directed and found it to be slightly bland. It was good but there was no zing. I like it spicy so the next time I made it I increased the ginger, garlic, and red pepper quite a bit. I doubled the sauce, increased the orange zest and was sure not to cook the beans too long. The recipe says to blanch the beans before frying. I disagree with that. Blanching then frying overcooked them. I just fry the beans raw and they stay nice and firm.

Rating: 3
Nice! Added chopped garlic to the marinade, and added red peppers to add colour contrast to the green beans.

Having perfected a family Top-20 list of favorite dishes, and having satisfied my family to the point where they are tough critics of anything new and different, they rated this dish as the best ever! I would not overdo the garlic, as the taste of the orange and the ginger realy makes the dish what it is.

Rating: 3
My girfriend loved this recipe so I'll definately be cooking it again. I marinated small chunks of pork and used a few more cloves of garlic than suggested. I also used some buc choy as well as the beans and I think this recipe would be great with a few more asian vegetable. Great with a beer!

I made this at home with fresh green beans that I did not boil as long as the recepie calls for. Also, I added more garlic and used thinner pork slices so that cut down on the cooking time. It was a great dinner and everone in the house (including my 9 year old picky eater) brother enjoyed the meal. Is great with Jasmine rice.

This dish had great flavor it just wan't very interesting. I used fresh green beans and reduced the amount. I like the sauteed cooking method of the beans. I used more garlic than the recipe called for. I agree that adding scallions would be good. I served it with white rice.

This is so simple to make and really delicious! The pork is so tender and the juices make a great sauce. The first time I forgot to add cornstarch and actually preferred the thinner juices when made this way. It's great with green onions sauteed with the bean.

I used fresh green beans from the garden and instead of boiling them, I used the microwave for 7minutes @ 70%. Also, I had pork that I had precooked and frozen. It sure made it easy to simply put the frozen meat in the marinade overnight. I also had orange skins frozen for quick use. My husband thought that this was a very good and a little unusual flavored dish!

This is one of the easiest and best recipes I have ever seen. I've made it four times in the last few weeks. I've made a few changes: I use l l/2 # sugar snap peas (or l l/2 # beans) and a little less meat. I sliced the meat a little thinner than indicated. Increased ginger a little and added 3 garlic cloves. Have marinated it overnight and that works just as well as marinating one to 4 hours. Everyone has asked for recipe and tried it for friends and family. It's a real hit. Do try it! The last time I made it I served it with saffron rice and flavors went together nicely.
