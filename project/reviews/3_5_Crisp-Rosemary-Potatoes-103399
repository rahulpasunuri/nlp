This is so good!!!I loved making these potatoes always,and they are easy to make.You just need to sprinkle them with salt and pepper,put rosemary,and they are so much better when you put garlic on them.I decided to put garlic on them once I was making thesse potatoes,and garlic was rottening at home.I made it with garlic and they are just irresistable,and also I like to put grapeseed oil on them instead of olive oil.I love this recipe!!! Bon Appetit!!!

Very delish. Make sure and sprinkle the rosemary, the salt and the pepper individually so you get the right amount of salt. I accidentally mixed the salt in with the rosemary trying to save time but then I wasn't sure how much salt I needed. I used a nonstick baking pan and there was no mess in cleanup. Will definitely make again!

These are really yummy. I made thes last week and used dried rosemary because it was what I had on hand. They were delicious with the "pork chops with mustard sauce" from this site, and they were also great with turkey sandwiches the next day. I'll be making these again.

very easy, and with foil, no problem with sticking. i substituted regular russet for the red potatoes, and instead of swapping shelves, once cooked well switched to broil until browned. probably used a little too much oil, not as crispy as i was hoping. also put strips of red onions throughout, made an awesome addition. used dried rosemary, instead of fresh. will probably turn out much better with fresh.

Very yummy and fool-proof. Ensure that you serve/eat them right out of the oven, they are the best this way. Enjoy!

My family loved this recipe. I used non stick foil in my pans and only brushed the potatoes with oil to keep the dish a bit healthier.

These were delicious. I added one minced clove of garlic to the oil (I probably used 5tbsp), rosemary, kosher salt and pepper in a plastic bag. Then, threw the potatoes in so they would be covered evenly. I generously sprayed the pan with PAM and had no trouble with sticking. In the end, I "drained" the potatoes on some paper towels. Next time I'll probably just use 3tbsp of oil but either way - they were great.

I liked it, I liked it a lot! I'll make it again, it's a different spin to red potatoes and oh so easy. Oh and mine didn't stick at all.

Fabulous recipe! I didn't have a problem with the potatoes sticking at all, I just made sure to oil the pan generously. The potatoes came out perfect, following the recipe exactly. Topped these off with some sour cream. YUMMY!

So simple. So devine. My family devoured these, and though they're not fancy, these potatoes are going to my next dinner party. Use no-stick foil. Then you can omitt the "generous" oil on the bottoms of the pans, and the potatoes slide right off.

For those that have tried this recipe and the potatoes have stuck try using a silpat. Oil the silpat and follow the method as applied in the recipe. I hope this helps.

The flavor was fantastic, but even though I greased the pan to what I thought was an excessive extent, the potatoes stuck so securely that I barely got a mouthful and may just trash the pans and buy new ones.

Tasty and Easy recipe. I'm not sure how anyone can complain about the time on this recipe it takes less than 10 minutes to get these to the oven. My oven takes longer to pre-heat then it takes to prepare the potatoes. I have made this dish 10+ times and could not be happier with the results.

Great! add a little seasoned salt, some paprika for taste and color. Wonderful dish to make with anything, even the common old meatloaf dinner. Add red yellow and orange peppers and it is truly colorful! Just thinking about it makes me want to run home and make them!!

If you don't grease the pan you won't get the potatoes up off of it. This was OK but I didn't think it was good enough to go to the bother of thinly slicing 2 lbs of them again.

With fresh rosemary available, these potatoes were just outstanding - so easy and so good!

Really liked these- surprising, because I'm not a huge potato fan. The rosemary & salt / pepper was perfect seasoning. Very easy to make, and so much better than a plain baked potato! Will definitely make again & again.

Every potatoe was eaten for a table of 4. I tripled the recipe so make more than the directions say. I also used dried Rosemary and it worked fine.

Nice change of pace recipe but WHO eats a half pound of potatoes???

A reviewer once told me to heat the pan before adding the potatoes. Using that tip here, the potatoes turned out brown and puffy and didn't stick at all. I did grease the pan as the recipe suggests. The seasoning certainly can be changed to taste. We loved them as written.

This is a great easy dish. I added some chopped garlic and lemon juice and wrapped mine in foil pockets and put them on the grill while my chicken was cooking. I flipped it over once during 20-25 min of grilling! Wonderful!

I roasted these in my All-Clad roasting pan and lengthened the cooking time by about 10-15 minutes. They turned out crispy, tasty and didn't even stick to the pan. Definate keeper. Couldn't be an easier recipe. I think one of the keys is FRESH rosemary. Made the whole house smell wonderful.

Good basic side dish. Like other reviewers said, it's nothing fancy, but it's quick, easy, and tastes good alongside many foods. Great with a meat and potatoes dish, something with a bit of sauce to soak up!

My family really enjoyed this dish. It was delicious alongside beef tenderloin with roasted shallots, bacon and port (Bon Appetit, Dec.'97). It was also great with grilled Atlantic salmon fillets with lemon-rosemary butter. It's easy to prepare and a pleasure to eat.

I would give this a 2 1/2 If that was an option. These were good and simple. Nothing spectacular, but one can read the recipe and see what you get.

Easy to make, and the Family loved it. Will make again!!!

Simple and mindless to make, just what I look for in a side-dish.

I loved this dish. I made a couple of changes and it still worked out fabulously. I cut the potatoes into cubes so the slices wouldn't be completely stuck to the pan. I also added some diced onions to the dish for a little extra flavor. Everyone loved them!

Outstanding!! Very crispy and the rosemary adds a delicate aroma as well as adding to the flavor of these tasty morsels.

This is an easy, delicious recipe, and it's a great way to finish a bag of red potatoes.
