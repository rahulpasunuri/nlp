My go-to pork chop recipe for a decade. Always delicious regardless of chop thickness or bread crumb style - fresh, stale, toasted, homemade, fine, coarse, panko, even 4C! Adapts well to spicy, sweet and boutique mustards too.

Used boneless pork chops and recipe coated both sides of twice as many as listed. Used twice as much mustard as we only had coarse ground. It was delicious and easy! We'll make again!

It was super simple and yummy. I didn't have hot mustard so I mixed a lot of horseradish into my grey poupon. Still not quite enough kick - but it was tasty and satisfying.

I used a spicy lilikoi mustard that I just brought home from Hawaii. Mixed about half the breadcrumbs. Mixed two eggs with mustard and dipped both sides rather than just spreading mustard. Good stuff!

Delicious! The chops were moist and tasty! I followed some of the reviews and halved the breadcrumbs and still had some leftover! I marinated the chops for a few hours in mustard and some chopped garlic (2 small cloves). I used panko and added chopped thyme and rosemary the the crumb mixture. I'll definitely make this again!

My husband put the first bite in him mouth and his jaw dropped and said "wow, what is this again?". It was such an easy, flavorful and cheap way to prepare normally bland chops. I use panko breadcrumbs. My only problem was there was WAY too much bread crumb mixture. I threw out more than half of it and I hate wasting food!

Pretty darn good recipe and very easy. I used fresh basil and thyme (didn't have parsley) and a simple dijon mustard. Good stuff. Also, I think next time I will make half of the breadcrumb mixture because I threw so much of it out after generously coating the chops.

I'll add my rave reviews to the chorus: a quick and delicious dish that's perfect for a weekday meal or for guests. I didn't have fresh parsley but added thyme to the breadcrumb mixture and it was great. Also, I used more than 1 TB of mustard to coat the chops, probably at least 2TB and it wasn't excessive in my opinion.

Excellent! Use bone in chops. Coat with with dijon mustard and horseradish (i didn't have spicy mustard).

This is a great and easy pork chop dish. I used boneless pork chops 1 inch think, Digion Mustard, Fresh baked french bread. In addition, I inserted a slice of fontinia cheese in the middle of the chop and baked it. A nice addition. Would make it again

This was a really easy to prepare recipe and good one for a quick meal after a long days work. But I wouldn't serve it as a feature to a dinner party. It lacked that something special. I may try and better quality mustard with lots of seeds next time, that may help.

My husband & I both loved this recipe. I panfried the chops for about 4 min per side on med-high heat which seemed to seal in the juices. I used Dijon and whole wheat bread for the top and only baked for about 15 minutes. Served with roasted balsamic vegies, it was a great meal. Yep, now a part of the "rotation".

Very good flavor, but way too many breadcrumbs. I think cutting the amount of breadcrumbs in half would make this a four star recipe.

Rating: 4
I used with the hottest Chinese mustard I have(I live with asbestos man). I made breadcrumbs from left over french bread from last night's dinner. I added garlic and rosemary to the breadcrumbs. I meant to use a little worchestershire, but I forgot. I put part of the breadcrumb mixture on the bottom of the chops and the rest on the top. Asbestos man loved it. I would have preferred it with a less over powering mustard...but we all make sacrifices. The crumbs browned nicely in the oven, so no need to broil. I served it with roasted butternut squash with balsamic vinegar from this site. I know I will be making this again in the next couple of weeks.

Rating: 1
Disappointing to the nth degree. I scrutinize your reviews and have had tremendous success with other recipes. This was the biggest failure in 4 years. The crust never browned during the cook time. To add injury to insult, when I placed it under the broiler, the crust burst into flame. (too close) The chops were tasteless. I could have boiled them for the same result. So much for an easy to prepare entree. It turned out easy to pitch.

Rating: 4
This is a great, easy recipe. I followed it exactly except that I used a combination of French Dijon and Mendocino Hot and Sweet mustard and I used a little more than the recipe calls for. The fresh bread crumbs absorb some of the mustard spiciness and the overall effect is tangy and wonderful. I have made this recipe twice - once in my convection oven, once in the normal oven. It came out perfect in the convection oven but on the dry side the second time.

Don't need to broil it- crumbs come out plenty crispy after baking. If you use a less spicy mustard, use more of it!

Great flavor and easy to make. I used olive oil instead of butter to make it lower in saturated fat. It was definitely way too heavy on the breadcrumbs, next time I will make it with one cup instead of two.

This recipe was delicious and easy. I used a smoky mustard, and my husband raved. He said he wanted to add it to the "rotation." The crispy outside texture is wonderful, and keeps the pork juicy and tender inside.

Easy and delicious! I think next time I will only bake 25-30 min. I didn't need to do the additional broil, as mine were nicely browned on top already. Maybe it's because I have a convection oven.

Very easy recipe. I recommend marinating the pork chops with mustard ahead of time and spicing up the bread crumbs (I used an Ital mix, but prefer fresh). Lastly, remember to plan to brown the crumbs/chops under the broiler, otherwise they'll be a little soggy (but still good).

I spread the mustard on bone-in loin chops (3/4 inch) and let them sit overnight. I then browned them quickly on both sides in a cast iron skillet before pressing the crumbs on top(used ? one cup crumbs and less mustard for 4 chops, added a dash of worcestershire and a little shredded asiago). I baked them at 350* for 20 minutes then broiled for two minutes to brown the crumbs. They were still juicy but almost overdone, next time i will cook only 15 minutes after stove top browning (which adds SO much flavor) then broil. All in all, very tasty.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe. Incredibly simple with fantastic results. I've added fresh thyme and sage, but it's great the way it is. It's easy to substitute ingredients, for instance i used italian breadcrumbs once instead of the frenchbread crumbs. I do suggest adding a dash of worcestershire, however. This is my favorite pork chop recipe.

Rating: 3
I halved it for 2 of us. Dijon mustard, crumbs made from 3 slices of English muffin bread using a hand held blender. (Keep it low in the bowl!) I couldn't believe it. Took about 15 minutes to get into the oven. And I think I'm padding the time! Juicy, tender. A winner!

This simple dish was surprising tasty. I used rosemary instead of parsley and flavor was outstanding and the meat moist. I used thinner chops, about 1/2" thick and cooked them for 20 minutes. I also coated both sides by spreading the mixture more thin. I agree with another reviewer that the crumb mixture just on one side is too much. I am going try this on chicken and maybe some fish soon.

Rating: 3
This is a great, simple recipe. The only change I make is to use 1 cup of breadcrumbs and I coat the chops on all sides. 1/4 cup on each chop is way too much for us. Otherwise, it's one of our favorites!

This is very tasty. I used dijon rather than Colman's. I want to go on record as somebody who is not a "fresh breadcrumb" snob...I use the dried stuff all the time and think they're swell. On this recipe, though, I used fresh and really think it made a huge difference. The toasty crumb topping was fantastic in a way that dried can not be. And particularly if you're using fresh, don't neglect the broiling step.

Rating: 4
Excellent dish!! I made it with 2 pieces of pork tenderloin and it was delicious! Very juicy. The pieces were about an inch and a half thick, so I baked them for about 45 minutes instead of 35. The crust on top browned itself. It was wonderful!! I would highly reccommend it!

I put last night's French bread in the Cuisinart for instant crumbs. Careful with the broiler - easy to incinerate the tops of these.

This is one of our favorite ways to have pork chops. They are so moist and the crust is very tasty. This goes in the regular rotation and is made at least once a month. Although, I disagree with other reviewers in regards to the amount of breadcrumbs - if you make your own, with day-old french bread, the amount isn't too much. If you use store bought bread crumbs then you do need to either decrease the amount of crumbs or increase the amount of butter as they don't have the moisture content of fresh crumbs.

Rating: 3
A keeper & extremely easy. Followed other cooks recommendations and kept the butter, but cut the bread crumbs in half. Used 2 T. butter, 1 c. crumbs for 2 pork chops. Also used Dijon mustard with a dash of dried mustard for kick. Used fresh bread crumbs - a couple of pieces of leftover french bread and a dinner roll. Turned out great, with crunchy top, will definitely make again soon.

Yummy, easy, and moist. The crust makes a lovely presentation. Definitely a keeper.

Rating: 3
I've been making this recipe with the following changes: I use panko crumbs seasoned with garlic and onion powder in place of the fresh crumbs. I also add some prepared horseradish sauce (basically horseradish + mayo) to the mustard when coating the chops. A little cayenne sprinkled over the breaded chops is great, too. I bake them at 425 for about 20 minutes in a cast iron skillet and they come out very moist.

Rating: 2
I had bone-in chops but I wouldn't do that again. They took way too long to bake and the presentation wasn't as nice. Following most reviewers' advice, I doubled the butter and halved the crumbs and the crust came out fine. It's a good recipe and I will make it again, but I didn't think it was to-die-for. If you're an inexperienced cook, I think you'll be pleased with this recipe; it really is easy.

Very tasty and easy to prepare. I used store-bought crumbs, which were fine. Pork was moist since it was baked.

I too really enjoyed this dish as a quick weeknight meal. I added some dried mustard to dijon (what I had on hand) to spice it up, used Trader Joe's breadcrumbs - much better than those other kinds of supermarket ones, if you don't have the time to make your own, added more parsley and some oregano to the mix. Baked for recommended time and drizzled melted butter on just before the broil time. Served with egg noodles with a mustard cream sauce (butter/flour roux, some chopped scallions, heavy cream and salt and pepper to taste). This will definitely go into my winter meal recipe box.

Rating: 3
Delicious. I have made this recipe several times and recommend it. I prefer to use day-old sourdough bread. However, instead of making breadcrumbs, I cut sourdough bread in small cubes. 2 cups is just right for 3-4 porkchops. I mound the butter-mustard cubes on top. We love the bread topping. It seals the meat and the pork chops are moist.

Rating: 2
I thought this was good but not outstanding. Like others though, 2 cups of breadcrumbs is way too much. Other measures OK. Did not broil as crust was already browning.

This receipe is quick, easy and delicious. Even our 12 and 14 year old boys loved the pork chops. Used dried breadcrumbs instead of fresh and Dijon mustard since both were readily available. I have made this dish three times with the same great results.

I did everything slightly different, but it still turned out great! I used spicy brown mustard instead of hot mustard, I used store bought bread crumbs instead of making my own, I used olive oil instead of butter...I also used bone in chops, which make a juicy chop. Regardless of all the modifications, it made a great chop and I will be making them this weekend for company! Definitely broil them at the end, it really makes the crust yummy...This weekend I will be using homemade bread crumbs because I have time, but I will still use the olive oil for health reasons.

I should have read all the reviews before making this dish. The amount of breadcrumbs should definitely be reduced, although I didn't feel a need for more butter. The chops were very tender and moist, and the crunchy crust was a good addition. It was so easy and quick to make. Next time I'd add something to the breadcrumbs to punch up the flavor a bit and maybe let the pork chops marinate longer in the mustard. Overall, a great simple dish!

Rating: 3
This dish was easy and quick which is perfect for a weeknight. The mustard crust had a good flavor. Broiling at the end seems a preference as to whether you like your crumbs soft or toasty. I think those who like to tinker with a dish could come up with lots of variations using different spices. It sure beat our weekly tacos!

Rating: 4
My dinner guest gave these chops 4 forks. I rarely give more than 3 forks myself, but this recipe deserves all the kudos it gets. I made some errors. To wit, the word "prepared" in English mustard didn't register with me, and I mixed up some Coleman's dry mustard with an equal amount of water. What also didn't register was the "fresh" as in breadcrumbs, and I used dried. With all that, the chops were moist and delicious. Baking seems to temper the hotness of the mustard. I did add a little extra butter and a dash of garlic powder. Try this recipe; I doubt you'll be sorry.

Rating: 4
Just by the many responses you can tell this is a tried and true receipe. The Pork comes out tender and moist. I like to mince garlic with the parsley when adding to the melted butter. Nor can I resist adding oregano. However, I really don't see the point of broiling at the end unless you top it with butter or perhaps a cheese. This is an excellent receipe!

Rating: 3
Per other reviews, I used 4 T. butter, dijon mustard, and half the amount of dried breadcrumbs. I brushed the chops with mustard and refrigerated for 24 hours, which was probably a little too long because the mustard flavor was quite strong. I liked these a lot, but my husband thought they were only so-so. You have to like mustard and they aren't so great reheated.

Fantastic dish that's great for a simple weeknight meal or for company. Allows for many variations. I used dried bread crumbs (but only about 1 cup) and added a little Parmesan cheese to the mixture. Chops were tender and moist.

Very nice, tangy flavor to the crust but I had to cook the chops longer than 35 minutes. Maybe mine were thicker than the recipe called for.

Excellent advice about doubling the butter and halving the bread crumbs. In my absent-mindedness, I forgot to get parsely and had no dried stuff -- it didn't matter, although it would have looked prettier. But I did crumble up a small handful of the french fried Durkee onions and mix them with the breadcrumbs. It made for a wonderful flavor! Will definitely try this again.

I took all suggestions - used Grey Popon Mustard spread on both sides and marinated the pork chops for 3 hours, then for preparation - doubled the butter and used 1/2 c. Italian Breadcrumbs.

I too cut down on the bread crumbs, increased the mustard and the butter. I used my garlic press to add about four cloves of garlic to the bread crumbs and about a half a cup of parmesan cheese. This was a very good dish that my family really loved! Please someone out there, try the Mocha Crunch Icecream Cake. Only two of us have reviewed it and it is sooooooo delicious!

Was a little dissaponted with this one. Chops were okay, but nothing to write home about. Agree with other reviewers, the recipe calls for way too much bread crumbs and not enough butter. I cut the cooking time (about 20 min.) chops were very tender but, found the bread crumbs somewhat of an overkill. I find whenever I bake my pork it is tender and good. I think this might be a better dish and less fattening with just the mustard rub, some favorite spices and baked. Also, I lined a cookie sheet with foil and baked. Less clean up and faster cooking time.

Rating: 4
I followed previous suggestions. I used dried bread crumbs and cornflake crumbs, 3/4 cup of crumbs altogether. I will use dijon next, but had a Jack Daniels Horseradish mustard which I brushed on the chops and marinated for 3 hours. I used a little more butter and was generous with the mustard in the topping. Uncle Ben wild rice mix with added sauteed celery and sliced waterchestnuts made a good sidedish. Thanks everyone.

Wow. I was a little dubious about this recipe with the mustard and all, but it turned out GREAT. I marinaded the pork in Dijon mustard the night before, decreased the breadcrumbs to about 1/3 cup and used 1.5 tsp. dried parsley. The pork was very tender and juicy, and the topping browned nicely. Very good, we will definitely make it again!

I took other reviewers advice and decreased the breadcrumbs (I used half fresh, and half seasoned from Progresso), doubled the butter and parsley and I used Country Dijon mustard--excellent! My chops were tender and moist, the crumbs were great, so tasty! I cooked it longer though, more like an hour and 15 mins., (I like to make sure they are done, and not undercooked at all!). I served with mashed sweet potatoes and roasted asparagus with kosher salt, very good weeknight dinner!

Used dijon mustard. Nice flavor, cooking time was right on. Browned breadcrumb topping was delicious. I'll make these again.

I guess I should have read all the reviews with the helpful hints before I started the recipe. Or maybe I did something drastically wrong. We had a hard time finding the chops under all the gooey bread. Once we scraped the "crust" off and ate just the meat, we found the flavor to be delicious. The mustard really does tenderize the meat. I'll try this again with MUCH less bread crumbs and be even more generous with the mustard.

This was a quick, tasty, good-enough-for-company, meat dish. I used a combination of country dijon and honey dijon mustards, which was quite nice. If you brush the mustard onto the pork chops ahead of time, the vinegar in the mustard really tenderizes the meat. Also, I substituted crushed, fat-free croutons for half of the bread crumbs which added extra flavor and texture. Yum!

I describe myself as a once in a blue moon gourmet chef and this was one of those times. I made this for myself and a roommate after a tired day at the office, and it felt like I spending a night on the town eating the best dishes SF chefs had to offer. The pork chops came out perfect. We used butter knives to slice the meat, and it was incredible. It melted in our mouths. I did use dijon mustard, and more butter. The crust came out so perfect, I even amazed myself. It was a perfect pairing with a light crunchy crust and incredibly juicy, well marinated pork chop. Incredibly easy recipe, even I could follow it. Accompanied it with asparagus and a vinagrette. Kudos to this recipe.

his receipe is quick and easy yet tastes like you slaved over a hot stove. The key is the right mustard. That single ingrediant will make or break this dish. Go for a spicey but flavorfull mustard and you can't go wrong. Also, you can subsitute the french bread with bread crumbs, just use them sparingly.
