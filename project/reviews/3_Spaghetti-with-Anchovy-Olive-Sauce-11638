I tried using black olives and fresh basil as well..absolutely delicious! I added parmesan cheese as well which accentuated all the flavors. Simple and easy to make - definitely a go to recipe after a long day.

I love epicurious and this website has been a standby for some delicious recipes. Unfortunately this one was a real disappointment. I would have to agree with a previous comment that the sauce tasted like nothing more than salty parsley. I will not be making this recipe again.

Totally a keeper. Couldn't be any easier or quicker for such a flavorful side dish (I didn't think it quite held up as a main). Most definitely add 1/8-1/4 t red pepper flakes for the boost. You can cut down a tad on the oil and pasta water (keep the pasta a tad undercooked to start).

Maybe it's the quality of anchovies i had, but we could feel the grainyness of the anchovies on the spagetti, not one of my favorites.

Perfect side dish, my husband loved it, added a sprinkle of chili peppers, and used black olives cause I didnt have green ones.

This was fantastic! I served it with poached catfish fillets, and everyone at the table loved it, even my picky daughter, so it's definitely a keeper. I made it as written except for my moronic disposal of all the pasta cooking water...I realized what I'd done, and substituted an equal amount of sherry. Very good.

This recipe was great! It's a delicious pasta dish that can be made quickly. I followed a previous reviewer's suggestion and used basil instead, and added red pepper flakes---the pepper flakes added a nice kick to it. Will definitely make this again.

Delicious! I would cut olives in half next time. Added some red pepper flakes and fresh shelled shrimp to the sauce before mixing with the pasta. Nice melding of flavors.

I tried this recipe since we love anchovies and olives...used oil-cured black olives, fresh basil instead of parsley, added some fresh grated Parmesan...divine! The flavors really melded together well. We loved it! Will definitely make again.

Halved olives and didn't rinse them. Used all of the other ingredients for 8oz of pasta. Topped with lots of grated Romano cheese. Great.

Kinda boring. This dish is a great way to use up quite a bit of leftover parsley, before it goes bad. The sauce is simple (my boyfriend made it!) but nothing to rave about. Tastes like spaghetti with salty parsley.

Absolutely delicious, except I substituted chopped black olives. Super with hot, crusty, yeasty bread (garlic bread would not be suitable for my taste, with this entree), chilled salad and a nice chianti.
