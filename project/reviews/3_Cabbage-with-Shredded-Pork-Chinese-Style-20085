I made this more or less according to the recipe, and yes, it was bland. I added some black bean garlic sauce and red pepper flakes, which saved it. It was, however, a good way to use up the coleslaw mix I had leftover, and I liked the basic combination of pork and cabbage in a stir-fry.

Sauted scallions with celery in a sauce pan with sambal olek (chile garlic paste) added a little saki to stay on theme and add moisture. When that had arrived at a good spicy flavor I set it aside and added to the pork before it went into the wok. A little more saki in the wok when it all got cooked up together and voila! A dish everyone loved, even the pork hater in the group.

As suggested by one review this recipe as given here is indeed very bland. The second time I made this dish I added three Tbsp. Szechuan Sauce and one tsp. Chili & Garlic Sauce at the same time I put the cabbage back in with the pork. Very Tasty! I also used pre-packaged cole slaw mix in order to save time
