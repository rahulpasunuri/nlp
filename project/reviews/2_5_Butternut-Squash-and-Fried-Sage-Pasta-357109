Realize that this is very late plus I haven't made the recipe but Barrilla whole grain ( yellow box) may not be whole wheat but the kids can't tell and at least it adds some fiber.

alicia55w's suggestion to roast the vegetables was spot-on. In addition to s&p, I seasoned with a little cinnamon, garam masala, and Szechuan peppercorns, and upped the garlic. I still pan-fried the sage, then sauteed a bunch of watercress in that oil, then added the pasta, the vegetables, and liberal Parmesan. Adding a cup of the pasta cooking water was essential, because it actually made a sauce. All in all, not a quick dinner (if you break down the squash yourself) but a delicious and healthy one.

Agree that this recipe needs 'more' - but it is supposed to be healthy, so a bit of sacrifice. A dollop of a fresh goat cheese or blue cheese might add something here. Perhaps some toasted, chopped walnuts too. I drizzled a bit of walnut oil over and thought it worked well here. These are both healthy additions, right? My 14 month old daughter loved this!

I rated this recipe two spoons because it was good, but it may have been better if I had opted to use fresh butternut squash rather than prepackaged butternut squash from Trader Joe's. Also, I haven't had any luck finding whole wheat pasta that tastes even remotely as good as regular pasta. If it exists, please let me know. Had I used fresh butternut squash and regular or better whole wheat pasta, I think this recipe would have turned out great.

This recipe is very bland. tastes "healthy." That said, it is REALLY easy if you need a quick veggie meal. I added spinach like another reviewer suggested and extra garlic.

An easier way to do this and retain more of the nutrients is to roast the butternut squash with the onions, garlic and sage. Once the veggies are roasted, remove from the pan and deglaze the pan with some broth or wine. Toss it all over pasta. I also only use farro pasta -- a whole wheat variation that is not as gummy as regular whole wheat. One more note - for those who buy "pre-cut" vegetables, you are losing nutrients as well as flavor, and increasing the risk of bacteria. It's not that difficult to peel a squash! (plus you'll save money.)

I make a version of this on a regular basis. Omit the sage, add in a bag or two of baby spinach and dry vermouth. Cook the spinach and squash along with the other ingredients in the vermouth. Add the cooked pasta and toss with parmesean cheese salt and pepper. The spinach gives it a great flavor and goes nicely with butternut squash... you cna even use frozen squash if you are in a hurry. This version is a true family favorite! ( Two teenage boys devour it every time.)

I love butternut squash and sage together, but this recipe is tasteless! Have found much better ones...don't waste your time

I had all the ingredients for this on hand today so I made it. Just doesn't appeal to me. Bland, dry, and the whole wheat pasta just didn't seem to work with the other flavors. Risotto with winter squash and fried sage is one of my fav winter comfort foods. This, not so much.

A great quick vegetarian recipe. Save some of the prep work by getting the butternut squash already chopped at Wegmans or other similar grocery stores.

epichuck, I needed you in my kitchen. As it was, this recipe gets no forks from us. We really didn't like it, though we have successfully paired butternut squash and sage before. It's a rare day when my husband doesn't finish his food, and he left a third of this on his plate. I gave the leftovers to a neighbour who had liked the sound of the recipe. She added more salt and pepper and drizzled good olive oil on it and found it passable.

Carnivore to the rescue- I added twice the onion, tons of black pepper, chicken broth instead of water and then I broke every rule by adding in a few tilapia filets toward the end. It turned out fantastic- dinner party hit!!

I have to say that we enjoy the ingredients individually, but this combination is the worst! The best thing about this recipe is the wine we paired with it.

Absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe exactly. This recipe is healthy and wholesome and feels like I'm really taking care of my family. I highly recomment it.

A great meal - Agree about bumping up the garlic a bit. We crumbled the crispy fried sage over the pasta just before serving and it added a great additional flavor - very good and easy !

Tasty and easy meal. I substituted basil for the sage and yellow onion for red onion. I also doubled the onion and garlic.
