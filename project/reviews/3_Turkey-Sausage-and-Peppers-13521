I replaced the bell peppers (because I didn't have any on hand) with additional fennel bulb, and really liked the results. Very easy as a weeknight meal, and the spicy sausage provided all the seasoning required.

Really satisfying, and super easy! Definitely a keeper. I served with crusty French bread and increased the amount of peppers a bit because they're so tasty.

I don't cook but, this recipe will make me start. My family loved it. I had the Gastric Bypass Surgery and I'm unable to eat pork or beef for a while. This meal is a great replacement without feeling deprived.

Excellent and very easy to make. Would definitely make this dish again. I would suggest cooking the sausage by itself, until it is just about done, removing it from the pan or grill, slicing it, placing it in a pan and then adding the peppers, fennel, and onions to that pan to cook with the sausage.
