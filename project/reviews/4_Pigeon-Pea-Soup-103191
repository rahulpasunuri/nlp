What a Disappointment! I am an adventurous and skilled cook who was looking forward to welcoming the Fall with a hardy new soup recipe. Alas, after devoting time and specialized ingredients to the Pigeon-Pea soup, we are now hungry and have to throw the whole pot away. The peas are too hard for our taste (despite having followed the recipe closely). Plus, the flavors are nothing special at all. Perhaps, this is an acquired taste you have to grow up with?

Incredibly tasty! Used ham bones for the meat, which yielded less than the 1 #, even so, it was still hearty. Couldn't find frozen Pigeon Peas so I used canned, well drained. Otherwise, followed the recipe as written. Next time, I would want to try it with Chorizo and serve it over rice.

SO GOOD, esp for something so healthy. I made this at least once a week last winter, and am looking forward to it again. I always used the canned pigeon peas, rinsed well, and had no problems with them. I too had trouble finding aji dulce peppers, so I substituted whatever available - - sometimes just more sweet red pepper, sometimes cubanelle, a couple of times a trimmed-down amount of poblando pepper. Agree that avocado is an excellent garnish. I made the plaintain thing once or twice, but you don't *need* it, in my opinion, if you are not trying to match your abuelas's recipe.

I didn't want to run to the store so I made this with dried navy beans; I also added finely chopped celery to the sofrito and used a yellow plantain instead of a green one. It was so savory, so easy, and so delicious. Low fat, too.

i followed the recipe fairly accurately. could not find aji dulce chiles so i used a combination of cubanelle, sweet italian peppers and poblanos. also did not use any meat what so ever. this was excellent. the stew was served over white rice with a spoonful of yogurt on the top. it was rich and subtly spicy. would definitely make again.

The sweetness of the calabaza is a great contrast to the savory flavors in this dish. I couldn't find aji dulce so I just doubled the red bell pepper and added a bit of sweet Hungarian paprika; it still tastes great!

This may be one of the best meals I've ever made, and very easy. I followed the recipe fairly closely, but substituted bacon for the sausage, used homemade vegetable stock, and served it over mixed rice (basmati, white and wild). Amazing combination of flavors, and it's even better the second day.

Very good version of a classic Puertorican recipe. The second time I made this soup I made some variations with very good results. Instead of the jalapeño pepper I used tabasco sauce, added a coupled of chopped culantro leaves (broad leaf cilantro), and did not use the grated plantain. The frozen green pigeon peas are the best if you dont find the fresh produce, but unless you dont have any other choice, I sugest not to use canned, in which case you must rinse them well. White rice as a side dish and simple avocado slices that you can add directly into the soup, completes this delicious and nutritious meal(pigeon peas are up to 22% protein). This soup is great the day after. Caution: dont confused aji dulce with its super hot cousin, the habanero or bonnet pepper, unless you are a capsicum adict.
