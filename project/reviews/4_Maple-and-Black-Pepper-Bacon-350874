Made this as part of our Christmas brunch. Under-cooked the bacon and drained the day before, then added the syrup and pepper and finished cooking it on Christmas morning. Very good.

I made the mistake of using low-sodium bacon which ended up being a little thin. Next time I make it - and I WILL make it again - I will use thick cut bacon. I'll save the "healthier option" for another time.

I use Brown Sugar instead of the syrup. It adds a lot of flavor and and Sustenance to the thin bacon. I get nothing but rave reviews when I make it!

I have to say since this recipe first made it's debut in 2008, it has become a staple for our Christmas Day Brunch. My family, especially my brother-in law goes crazy for this!

Our local smokehouse makes a peppered bacon. I brushed maple syrup on it and cooked it in the microwave. My husband LOVED it. What a great combo.

Save yourself some time and energy. The night before you want this, take a large ziplock bag. Add about 2 cups of maple syrup. Grind in a goodly amount of fresh black pepper. Place DOUBLE THICKNESS bacon in the bag. Squeeze bag and move bacon about to ensure that syrup coats bacon. Put in fridge overnight. The day of, put bacon on med heat griddle pan (no stick is best for this). Fry it up till sticky and just cooked. Do not try and crisp the bacon. enjoy it hot. If you want to spice it up a little, gently sprinkle it with cayenne pepper ( to taste). They'll think you spent hours working on this...it really only takes minutes! YUM! Great with thick french toast and berries.

This was good, will be great. Cook the bacon as directed until cooked halfway, then blot off fat and brush with syrup and pepper. If you wait too long the bcaon burns and burns the syrup. While flavorful it is still a tad burned.

I've found maple or honey bacon has a propensity to scorch though I love the flavor. This is a little more work but I'll try this some time when I want to jack up the taste.

This was good, but I think it could be done just as easily without putting the bacon on the broiler pans. Next time I will just cook the bacon in a cookie sheet as always and glaze it the last 10 minutes or so. Nice flavor and everyone loved it.

This is SO good...it's hard to improve bacon, but this is a good way to do it for a special weekend breakfast/brunch treat.
