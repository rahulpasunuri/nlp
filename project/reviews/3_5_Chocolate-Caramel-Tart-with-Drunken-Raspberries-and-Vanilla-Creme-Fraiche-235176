If I could have I would have given this no forks. Caramel recipe is awful - there are much better recipes for caramel than this one. Following the caramel recipe as written results in a hard crack caramel that will break a tooth. Even letting the tart sit out for an hour doesnt soften the caramel enough to safely eat it. I made this tart three times and the caramel turned out the same each time. On the 4th time, I used another caramel recipe I have and it made soft thick golden caramel. The ganache is the thinnest I have ever made. Chocolate soup. 4 tries is enough to waste on this recipe.

I think it would have been good if my caramel filling had caramelized. I was so worried about over cooking it that I undercooked it. I should have read the reviews all the way to the end about how to caramelize sugar properly. Also, when I mixed the heavy whipping cream and the scharffen berger bittersweet chocolate, I got this weird oily substance all over the top. I poured it all off before putting it on the pie but even then when it hardened, there were these weird congealed grease white streaks on top of the chocolate. Does anyone know what I did wrong that the whipping cream?(if that is what it was) separated into an oily substance? Maybe if I try it again it will work better???

We made this absent the gold flake garnish and also absent the raspberries and creme fraiche accompaniments. So the review is for the tart itself and it was delectable! We tried it twice, actually, the first time taking the caramel to dark amber per the recipe. I've made a lot of caramel and so it was no problem to tell when the sugar was ready per the recipe, but we felt the finished product caramel was simply too hard to cut through easily with a fork...and tough on the dental work of a guest or two as it stuck to their teeth! Second time around we only took the caramel to about medium amber stage. Perfect texture. Also, since all three vendors of cocoa nibs in our little city were out of stock, we went without them the first time and then subbed mini chocolate chips the second time for the crust. At 3T for volume, a little volume is lost in the crust if you leave the nibs (or chocolate chips) out but the crust is equally as delicious either way. I am more cook than baker (my hubby is the designated baker :-) ) but a recipe like this makes even a cook like me look "bakery worthy". A keeper! Next time I'll probably add the berries and creme fraiche too. But I never have been able to "get" the gold dust as edible thing.

This was EXCELLENT! We couldn't find cocoa nibs, and the caramel turned out a tad on the hard side, but it was still fabulous. It looked and tasted so good! I will definitely make this again. Would give it 5 forks if I could. The raspberries and creme fraiche are a nice touch as well. Delicious.

Easy to make and sure to impress! Admittedly, the caramel filling can be tricky. I burnt it on my first try, but luckily, it's just sugar and water, and easy to repeat. Even though there are multiple steps, it's not as intimidating as it seems. Although I made both vanilla creme fraiche and drunken raspberries, I think I would enjoy it equally with vanilla whipped cream, and plain raspberries. Holds together well, serves up like a dream!

This was very good. I followed the recipe exactly as written. The first effort at making the caramel failed -- the sugar did not totally dissolve so the caramel was grainy. The second time I brought the water to a boil before I added the sugar and it worked like a charm. I made the crust and the caramel two days ahead, added the ganache the next day, and took the tart out of the fridge about two hours before serving so the caramel could get soft. I couldn't find the edible gold dust, so I shaved some white chocolate on top -- it looked very nice. The drunken raspberries were just OK but went well with the tart. I made my own creme fraiche and added Kaluha instead of vanilla. Yummy!

I obviously do not possess the culinary skills to make this tart! I burned the caramel on my first try, so I had to start over. Second time, I must not have let the sugar melt enough, and the end result was kind of crunchy. I made the chocolate ganache thinking...what could go wrong at this point....and the ganache came out really watery. At this point, desperation was setting in, so I mixed the crunchy caramel with the soupy ganache. Then I added a bunch of peanut butter to try to thicken it up. The end result was not bad at all, but nothing at ALL like the recipe! I normally think of myself as a pretty good cook and able to follow instructions. But in this instance, I admit my defeat and warn away those who are cooking without the aid of an expert.

My friends were just delighted with this one! Following the Once Upon A Crust people, I was careful to pulse and not overwork the dough. It was flakier than I expected. I did not use cocoa nibs and the cake was not lacking for anything. Caramel came out just perfectly with vanilla instead of vanilla bean. Peaople licked the container I brought this in, I swear!

Loved this tart! It was the desert course for a New Years romantic dinner for the two of us. Thought it would last at least a few days...but by noon Jan 1 it was gone. I did add the cocoa nibs into the crust and to the other reviewers who did not and loved it anyway, I say to them wait until you try it again with the nibs! You will appreciate the interesting flavor and the crunch that they add. I did have a bit of shrinkage with the crust while baking. If anyone knows how to prevant that next time I would appreciate any comments. Definitley a keeper in my permanate recipe file!

The caramel is easy to make if you ignore the timing printed in the recipe and rely on your eyes and nose to know when it is ready .

I made this almost as written--but couldn't find cocoa nibs and I felt that 1/4 t of fleur de sel wouldn't be missed so used regular salt--it was fantastic! got raves from four woman friends with pretty sophisticated palates. I dropped and broke my candy thermometer while making the caramel, so I just relied on color and timing. It was soft and creamy. I had purchased enough ingredients for a test run, but didn't need a second try!

This was exceptional. I made it without cocoa nibs, since I couldn't find them, which was fine, and with both fresh and drunken raspberries. Both were great. I wouldn't bother with buying the expensive creme fraiche again; if you have time to make it, fine, but otherwise just make whipped cream. But, really excellent, ,and will make again.

This was wonderful, though I'm not sure I'm allowed to give it 4 forks when I made several changes. Because I can't find cocoa nibs here and because the idea of nuts in the tart or crust appealed to me, I used the hazelnut crust from the caramelize-banana tartlets on this site. Had no trouble with the caramel, it was perfectly soft. Used fresh raspberries instead of drunken, and completely missed the part about scraping vanilla seeds into the creme fraiche until it was too late, so I just added about 1 tsp vanilla extract. Everyone loved it.

Wonderful! I made this for Mother's Day dinner and had a ton of compliments! I had trouble finding fresh rasberries, so I used a packaged mix of blueberries and strawberries.

I followed the recipe and comments exactly and had no problems. It was really straightforward. If you follow the recipe you'll have no issues. This was so yummy - like eating a piece of candy. Slice thin since it's so decadent. The caramel was so yummy! I could have eaten that all by itself...

This was delicious and easy. I've made it 3 times already and am amazed how simple it was compared to how it looks and tastes. The first time I overcooked the cream (forgot to watch it) and had to start that part over but it recovered nicely. The caramel part is not hard if you just follow the instructions - no need to measure temperature of the sugar if you just follow the recipe. I skipped the chocolate nibs but made the rasperries and creme fraiche. Rave reviews.

My caramel turned out perfect - I took it off the heat and left it off the heat as soon as it turned amber. I didn't make the drunken raspberries but, instead opted to simply garnish the tart with fresh raspberries. Be sure to take the tart out the fridge a hour before serving, this willl ensure a soft, velvety texture. Everyone raved and asked to take a piece home.

I enjoyed this, but as with reviewers below, the caramel was harder than I would have liked. To add to the post below (I didn't go to culinary school, but I've made a bit of caramel in my time!), the hotter you get the sugar, the harder the caramel will be. It isn't just a matter of making sure to add all of the cream and butter. Next time I make this, I plan to heat the sugar up more slowly and proceed to the next step as soon as it becomes amber. In fact I'll probably follow the advice of the reviewer below who used a thermometer to make sure it stayed in the soft-ball stage.

This was good. For the people who had trouble with the caramel, you MUST add all of the cream and butter. If you don't, it will be harder than brittle. When you caramelize the sugar, use the tallest small saucepan you have. I use my All-Clad 2 quart. You need to let the sugar get amber to get that wonderful caramel flavor. When the sugar is amber and you just start to see whisps of smoke, TURN OFF THE HEAT (move to another burner if you are using an electric burner) and add all of the cream. It will VIGOROUSLY (almost violently) erupt into a boil, bubble up to the top of the pan, and look like it will overflow. Don't do anything, just step back and let it settle down a little. Once it has, then finish the recipe. You will end up with a wonderfully smooth caramel sauce. I've done this many times, but the first time (in culinary school) was a bit startling. I've never seen a recipe really describe this process.

This was wonderful. As for the caramel, it will continue to cook when you take if off the heat, so be sure that it is not too amber before you do so. I used a candy thermometer, like another reviewer did, to make sure that it stayed at soft stage. The soft caramel with the ganache was amazing.

The tart looked amazing and was relatively easy to make. Similar to other readers, the caramel was too hard to enjoy. I am still trying to figure out what went wrong even though I followed the recipe exactly as written.

I made this and was not thrilled although my guests loved it. I had trouble with the caramel and had to remake it. I really didn't think the crust was all that great. I have had other recipes similar to this that I have liked a lot better and were a bit less trouble. It's good, just not my favorite.

Based on previous reviews I used a candy thermometer when making the caramel filling and did not let it get beyond a soft ball stage. It kept it soft and delicious. Very great double roasted nibs (and other amazing chocolates) are available at Theo in Seattle if you live in the Northwest.

While flavor is outstanding, the caramel is a problem. The caramel is too hard...one could break a tooth! I would make again if I knew how to make the cramel creamier (?)

Correction to my last posting. It was the caramel that was hard to cut thru not the crust. I agree with the other person, the caramel needs to be creamier.

I too had a really hard time cutting this tart. It is not the crust but the caramel that is hard. My guests ate it like cookies, once I finished cutting it. I am going to try making the caramel a bit creamier so it doesn't turn into a block of hard candy! Will keep you posted

The receipe was easy to make and receive good feedback from my guests. I must have made the crust too thick, because it very difficult to cut thru.

I got rave reviews on this dessert. I couldn't buy chocolate nibs locally so I left them out. In addition, you don't need as much Chambord as called for. Next time I will just spread the raspberries out in a shallow bowl and pour just enough liqueur over to cover.
