I made this cake yesterday leaving out 1/2 cup hazelnuts or almonds. Instead, I used 1 1/2 cups of walnuts. I didn't bother with the soaking syrup because I thought it would be too sweet. It was a delicious Passover cake. Everyone at the Seder really enjoyed it.

I realized on the day of our seder I needed another dessert. Thanks to a quick search on epicurious, I found this one. It came together very quickly and one could really use any nut. I used pistachios and walnuts since I didn't have the hazelnuts. I sprinkled some toasted slivered almonds on top after the caked had chilled for a few hours. Everyone enjoyed it. The only down side? Not much left over!

Every thinks I'm a chef now! This cake was delicious. I happened to have black walnuts which gave it a very rich flavor. I did not use matzo flour, just regular (same amount). This would prevent any 'matzo flavor' that other posters were concerned about. This is a keeper for all occasions!

Folks, this cake is goooood. I made it on Saturday for a seder on Monday, and let it sit/soak in the fridge. The flavors mellowed out and it became really dense, sticky, and gooey. Everyone loved it! I cut down on the sugar, per previous suggestions. The only thing I'd do differently next time is leave the lemon juice out of the syrup. I can't get past the "cold medicine" taste-memories of honey & lemon together! That's just a personal preference, though.

OK maybe i shouldn't give it 4 forks because i really made another cake. i used 50/ 50 blanched pistachios and walnuts and i added a tablespoon of rosewater. i used a rosewater soaking syrup - water, lemon juice sugar and rosewater. i left out the orange juice and cinnamon and used water and white grape juice instead. and it DID taste exactly like the syrian baklava which is made with pistachios. oh and it was a very pretty little green cake. next time might reduce the walnuts and up the pistachios.

My sister made this for our Passover seder. It was good (better than we expected) - and our guests raved about it.

As far as passover honey cakes go this is a pretty good one -- nice and rich. If you are unfamiliar with this genre of cakes you should be aware that they are very sweet, often dense, and usually too dry w/o the syrup.

This was good enough to make more than once each Passover, it really does taste like baklava!

Another Passover staple. I agree with previous reviewers who suggested making it a day in advance, and cutting sugar down. I always make it 36 hours in advance of serving - it mellows a bit in the fridge. It's always a hit.

A lovely cake. Reduce sugar and oil by half and make only half the quantity of soaking syrup.

With the recipe soliciting such high ratings and as a frequent reader and user of Epicurious, I was surprised to find myself disagreeing so much with the previous reviewers. This tasted exactly like a Passover dessert!! The faint but unmistakable aroma of matzoh meal came through. I was expecting something better. I made it exactly as stated and I believe the cake came out as it was supposed to. However it was just okay at best, even though I love baklava and similar desserts.

The best Passover dessert I've ever made - or had anywhere. Yes it is sweet but that's the whole idea! Instead of baking a doubled recipe in a springform, I just make 2 - 9" rounds or ovals, one for each of the two nights - there's never anything left!

Rating: 3
This cake was incredibly tasty, and while dense, does not have that heavy Passover taste. If you do double the recipe and make in the springform, be sure to also increase the baking time to about 60 minutes or else you'll wind up with mush!

I made this recipe for Passover and all the guests really liked it. I used sour oranges instead of sweet for the juice (only because I have sour orange trees in my back yard), and it tasted wonderful. It is very rich - even a dessert fiend like me needed only a small piece.

This is the best passover honey cake I've ever made, and very easy to make. It does get a mite gooey in the middle, but nobody seemed to mind. It is reminiscent of baklava, so what could be bad?

Rating: 4
In a word....OUTSTANDING! I doubled the recipe but not the syrup. I did however add more honey. I made it in a 9" spingform pan. It did take more then 35 minutes to bake. This cake will always be a staple at my Passover dinner.

Adding to my earlier review- Definitely would cut the sugars but chilling does bring the sweetness down a notch. Was a BIG hit with my Passover guests last night with frequent comparisons to Baklava.

Made this cake this weekend. Doubled the recipe, used a springform pan and used triple sec instead of water. Will make again, but too much syrup as I doubled that too. Will add more orange zest and keep the syrup down to one recipe. Very sweet. Good to make a day or two in advance.

Just tried a tiny little square still warm cause I couldn't wait...VERY yummy and intensely sweet and dense. Next time I might cut down on the sugars just a smidge but otherwise fabulous!!!

I made this dessert for our annual Easter dinner. I was intrigued by the ingredients, the nuts, honey, orange and the idea of the soaking syrup. This cake is unlike anything I have attempted before, and I was a bit tentative, but I am so glad I made it. It got rave reviews from my Mom, who absolutely loved it!!! I followed the recipe to a T, and while the cake is dense, the syrup and orange compliment it perfectly. A very distinctive and elegant dessert. I think it tastes very natural and rich!

This recipe was really great, and different from your average Passover dessert. I made the following alterations, all of which I recommend, but each change could of course be done on its own and not along with the others. Also, don't scrimp at all on the citrus aspects of the dish -- these flavors are needed to lighten the heavy sweetness of the sugar and honey. For the CAKE: 1) I added 1 tsp. vanilla extract 2) I used half the amount of oil called for, and substituted flaxseed meal. (Flaxseed meal can be used to replace oil on a 3:1 ratio, so I used 3/8 of a cup of flaxseed to replace the 1/8 of a cup of oil I omitted.) This gives you some Omega 3s, and flaxseed meal has a nutty taste that works well with the dish. 3) I didn't measure how much zest I put in, but I zested at least half of an orange, which definitely was more than the 1 tsp of zest that was called for. This didn't make the orange flavor overpowering, but it was more detectable than it would have been with only a tsp. For the soaking SYRUP: I used half the amount of granulated sugar that was called for, and this was plenty. The syrup may not be as thick, but it does the job. My friends and I found the cake to have just the right amount of sweetness.

Big hit with everyone - even people who said they would not like it ate their words and plenty of cake. Used all pecans and a regular cake pan lined with parchment. Poking holes is a must to let the syrup penetrate. Triple Sec was used primarily in lieu of water for the glaze. I made the cake a day before serving and kept it chilled until it was time to plate it and put it with the other desserts. Have already been asked to make it again.

Yuck! A sticky, gooey mess that didn't bake properly (yes, my oven works fine, it made all my other Passover baked goods successfully. Made a double recipe in the springform pan as recommended but only the outer 1 inch ring baked properly and the rest was just goo that I had to toss. Everyone liked the resulting tiny squares of nutcake, which I admit were tasty, and the syrup went very well with matzah pancakes but the liklihood of my making this again is very slim. There are way better choices out there, folks.

I doubled the recipe & will be making again. Everyone loved it. I used pecans & filberts. I used the extra amount of cinnamon suggested. Also loved the flavor of the orange. Good idea to poke holes in the cake to let the syrup soak in. I made the cake 2 days ahead & covered it & added the syrup the day I served it. I've been asked for the recipe. This one is a keeper & doesn't taste like it's for Passover. Beware it is sticky.

excellent- great for any time of year. also, it's super easy. next time, i would try adding a bit more cinnamon and leaving out the orange zest. but it is still absolutely delicious as is.

Omigod! This was out of this world. In the past, I've prepared another cake similar to this one which is very good and always well received (Honey-Lemon-Almond Cake from Bon Appetit) but this one is moister and even more delicious if that's even possible! I made it the day before as some had suggested.

Whenever I make this, everyone "chalishes" (as we say)--that is, passes out from, in this case, delight. I've had good results in an 8-inch round pan, and actually prefer the round to the square--the cake remains evenly moist. It is best made a day in advance, and is usually good for at least two more, if it lasts that long--which it usually does not. It IS sweet and dense.

I made this recipe for Passover, and everyone loved it. I thought it was a little too sweet myself, but apparently I was the only one. I will definitely make it again.

I made it last week for seder and am making it again for a dinner party this weekend. I did not have walnuts so I used pecans and it was still absolutely wonderful. This time I'm going to add 1/2 c. pistachios and 1/2 c. pecans instead of 1 c. pecans. Also, I didn't have a 7" cake pan; I used a 9" pan and baked it for slightly less time. It did not seem to be a problem at all.

Made this dessert for Seder, along with a flourless chocolate torte with chocolate ganache, and believe it or not, the nut cake was a bigger hit than the chocolate cake (which was pretty good)! The cake is rather sticky when removing it from the pan, so use waxed paper or parchment to line the bottom of the pan. (I used a springform.) I wouldn't change a thing on this recipe.

This was a hit at the first Passover Seder I've ever attended, much less cooked for - I was out of town for the two days before, and so I let it soak for about 48 hours, although I was concerned it would fall apart. It stayed together beautifully! I doubled the recipe and used a 10" springform pan - put a dish under to catch syrup drips. I cut it into diamonds and garnished with mint - everyone really loved it.

I never bake, and this was very straight forward and easy to prepare-I usually mess up the entire kitchen when I attempt to cook anything, and it was really very neat. I used 1/3 almond meal and 2/3 regular matzah meal, instead of the matzah cake mix, and it worked great. I thought it came out really super, not dry or tasteless, like most passover desserts, at all. I have to say, I was surprised that it didn't get a great response. Everyone said it was good, but no "raving," or "fighting over left overs," which is why I gave 3 forks. But really, I thought it looked and tasted amazing: def. 4 forks. It's really worth making. Hope you don't have such a tough crowd!

This cake was gone very quickly on my first seder night. Everyone raved about how flavorful and delicious it was. I will certainly make it again, and not just for Pesach. I substituted groud hazelnuts for the choppped hazelnuts and I think the recipe benefitted. Just wonderful!

Great recipe with a few changes. I added 1/2 cup of coarsely chopped California apricots (Turkish don't have the same intense flavor) and upped the almonds to 3/4 cup. Also, I use a non-stick 8" cake pan and cut a parchment circle for the bottom. This is essential if you don't want a mess. Flip the cooled cake onto a plate, peel off the paper, and it's perfect. It was a huge hit.

ehhh, I thought this was a little too syrupy, and the orange flavor was a bit too strong even though I left out the orange zest. I would make this again since I like the nuttiness of the cake, but I'd cut the orange juice down considerably. I also couldn't find matzo cake meal, so I just ground some regular matzo meal in a food processor, and that worked beautifully. Served this with cinnamon ice cream, which evened out the sticky sweetness of the cake.

Rating: 4
Yum! And so easy. Served to a crowd of goyim who unanimously loved it -- one said it was just like baklava but with a better texture. Couldn't find matzo cake meal but smushed up some regular meal a little more and it worked fine. Perhaps the texture was a bit looser and rougher, but with all that citrusy honey syrup, no one cared. Served with cardamom ice cream, though that really gilded the lily.

This was delicious! Everyone at the seder loved it, and requested seconds. I would make this at any time of the year. It is very simple recipe, yet it tastes gourmet! Recommended for impressing your mother-in-law.

This was excellent. A big hit - at both seders I brought it to!! Did not have that taste that I associate with cakes made with cake meal. I also doubled the recipe, and it was wonderful. Did not taste like passover cake at all.

An absolutely fantastic cake that everyone at the Passover Seder raved over. I doubled the recipe as well and although I substituted the matzoh cake meal with kosher honey cake mix, the ultimate result was a moist, chewy and delicious cake. Will make it even when its not Passover!

Thank you for a BEAUTIFUL recipe. I made this for my first seder....and it was a huge success. I used pecans in lieu of walnuts and almonds. The syrup was perfect. I used a 7' stoneware baking pan lined with parchment. The caked popped right out! I received the ultimate compliment..."Not bad for a goyem"....lol.

I doubled this recipe and it worked perfectly. Next time I would definitely use a springform pan since getting this out of the 9 inch square pan resulted in squishing some of the cake into mush. I also recommend foil cupcake liners so the liquid doesn't soak through.

This is fantastic!! All the flavors came through so perfectly and one would never know this was kosher. Considering my family is sephardic, it'll be all that much bigger of a hit! I'm delighted to have something new and delicious for Passover. This was my trial run to test it out before making it for my seder and I did the round cake pan, but I like the cupcake suggestion and doubling the recipe. I think it would really impress your guests.
