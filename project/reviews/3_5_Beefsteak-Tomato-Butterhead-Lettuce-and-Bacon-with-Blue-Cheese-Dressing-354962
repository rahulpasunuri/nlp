Although pretty simple, company worthy in my opinion. I thought the dressing was great as written - not too much vinegar. I used skim milk and light sour cream to lighten up the dressing a little. I did have to thin the dressing just a tad.

I enjoyed this recipe, but agree with other reviewers that the dressing had too much vinegar. I'd recommend starting with just 1 Tbsp of the vinegar, and then adding additional to taste. Also, I'd increase the bacon to 2 slices per serving.

Bacon was yummy, but the dressing was so - so. Too much vinegar, not creamy enough. Would look for another blue cheese dressing.

I used a mix of romaine & iceburg which I had on hand rather than the butter lettuce. The result was good but not exceptional. The dressing was good but I think there may be a better blue cheese dressing out there. The bacon bits really made the salad though. The remaining dressing lasted OK in the fridge for a couple of days. 6.5/10.

Very good dressing. Easy to make and will do this one again.

Basically my favorite salad from the Cheesecake Factory.

This was so easy and delicious, that I'll happily make it again and my husband will happily eat it again! It made enough for us to have it two nights in a row.
