Trout was unavailable so we made this with smoked salmon instead. Gently heated the smoked salmon until it "cooked" so we could flake it. The souffle worked well, but was very strongly flavoured done this way. Would mix with fresh salmon if making again (have never seen smoked trout in our area). Phyllo is a nice touch!

I made this recipe as an hors' d oeuvre. Instead of dealing with the phyllo dough, I just bought the small, bite sized phyllo dough cups and poured the batter into it. The batter does not rise too much so the cups should be well-filled. I added a little bit more horse radish because for this purpose some more bit is good; Also, I would not pack the dill leaves or the dill will be to strong. The result was a very sophisticated and tasty nibble that can be prepared ahead of time an then baked when the guests arrive.

I thought this was good, but my husband really loved it, so I'll make it again. I agree that this was very easy to prepare. We had it for dinner, but I think it would make an excellent brunch dish, and is a nice departure from the standard cheese souffle. The phyllo sheets didn't fully cover the width of my tart pan (I guess it's larger than specified, although I've used it for many other recipes), so the souffle had to rise up against the pan in some places rather than the crust and stuck a bit. One more note--I might use a bit more horseradish next time for more of a bite.

This is just delicious. I made it because I needed to use up an open package of phyllo and found this recipe in a search. I can't believe no one has made it. It is extremely easy to prepare. The instructions for the phyllo sound strange but it works perfectly. It makes a lovely presentation. It's great as a light course or meal with a green salad or frisee'. I will admit to substituting half and half for the milk as I had it in the refrigerator and chives for the dill.
