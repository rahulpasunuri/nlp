Excellent for family quick meal. Just use lowfat milk, and put the crumbs on late. I also suggest using a really tasty cheese, like the "Uncommon Cheddar" from Trader Joe's. EVERYBODY loved it.

This is the perfect teenage boy recipe. I watched this disappear in about 20 minutes flat. No leftovers! Used regular breadcrumbs not panko and more garlic and added in other shredded cheeses to equal 2 cups.

Tried this recipe twice and both times the end result was delicious. I used gruyere and cheddar with the pasta and parmmeggiano with the crumb topping. I did use 50% more cheese and added a little light cream to the base to give it a creamier, cheesier taste. The kids and my husband ate almost the entire casserole! There wasn't much of a time savings but it did keep me from having to use another pot to boil the pasta which is a bigger bonus in my book.

Yummy recipe. I would decrease the salt and add more cheese next time. Not a time saver.

While the "Cook from San Fran Bay Area" had a bad experience, mine was quite the opposite with a little embellishment. I added chopped chorizo under the topping and mixed cheddar and smoked Gouda rather than plain cheddar. While it lacked the creaminess of a recipe made with a full roux, this was quite tasty and I had only one pan to clean.

A recipe for disaster - whats the point - no saving of time as you can be cooking the pasta while making the sauce and you wont have to chance that there is enough liquid. Dry and tasteless - then to top it all the panko burns before the sprinkled cheese is brown - don't believe me? - try it...

Reading other reviews, I decided to pump up this comfort food by adding asiago and romano cheese to the mix with the cheddar. Yummy.

this was good, it could be creamier. doesn't necessarily take less time than traditional mac and cheese. Because other reviewers said it was bland, I added some dry mustard and worcester sauce.

I loved the idea of this recipe but was not too happy with the final result. I used freshly grated, high quality cheddar cheeses and felt it just wasn't cheesy enough. In fact, it was hardly cheesy at all! The topping is DELICIOUS so on your first bites you think you're in for something great. Then you keep going and it just gets plain. It is also not a great leftover since the topping gets soggy while the bottom gets rock hard. I think next time I would halve the recipe and keep the cheese quantity the same to up the cheese and not have leftovers.

Very tasty... At a party of 15, over half raved about how wonderful it was. Note: make more sauce, to cover all noodles. Before putting topping on, if too much liquid stir it around and cook un-covered for 5 mins to absorb extra sauce. Off to the crunch layer which I found didn't brown, so I broiled for few and it looked more like the pic. I made the sauce in advance and then refrigerated. I let the sauce sit in with the noodles for 1/2 before going into the oven (party timing) and it did not breakdown the noodles. I saved any extra sauce and used it to reheat leftovers. Still yummy.

this is better than other no boil recipes...but it is still not creamy enough.

Oh yeah...a winner in my book. Lots of room for variation for cheeses, add-ins, etc. Used chicken broth instead of water in the bechamel. Shared it with friends who also made and loved it.

Made this as a gluten-free version by using GF pasta and replacing the flour in the sauce with cornstarch. I used more cheese than directed (probably twice as much) and lowfat milk. Used gluten-free rosmary olive oil bread for the crumbs and skipped the garlic. This got rave reviews from both adults and children and I will make it over and over.

Good for kids. I thought the no boil would mean time saved but making the sauce took longer than I would have liked, Nevertheless, everyone liked it.

Not a good recipe. My noodles were not evenly cooked - crunchy near the edge of the pan and al dente in the center - presumably from the "do not stir" instruction. Texture aside, there was very little flavor, even to my five year old. I hoped this recipe could act as some sort of culinary bridge to get my children off Kraft and onto something more interesting, but given the ingredient list I should have known better.

This is a simple and yummy meal -- not knock your socks off yummy, but a tasty fast dinner. I grated my own cheese, and did not measure. I'm confident I used more than 2 cups. I also added more garlic to the panko. As much as I love garlic, probably would stick to the 2 next time so it's a more subtle addition.
