Wonderful! Delicious, even with using part fresh orange juice (about 1/3 cup) and the rest water (2/3 cup) = makes up the full 1 cup orange juice measure. A lot stickie in the castle bundt pan, even with liberal spray. Can't get it out! Might try butter paper and spray, or flour too on pan first. Like the chocolate chips.

I have made this many times and don't get the bad reviews. I make it with fresh mandarin or orange juice, not frozen concentrate, and it always comes out gooey moist and sweet. The best part, it lasts forever.

I thought this turned out great. I made the vanilla version, using water instead of OJ. I was a little worried because the batter seemed awfully runny but the resulting cakes were moist and tender with good flavor. I used one of them for an ice cream cake - layered slices of marble loaf with chocolate and vanilla ice cream, chocolate ganache, and chocolate cookie crumbles. Yum!

following the recipe exactly, the cake's texture heavy & a little gelatinous. With so many wonderful cakes out there, why make this one which would be ordinary on a good day?

I don't understand some of the negative reviews. This lovely cake was flavorful and attractive. My family had half of it eaten before I could even glaze it and they're used to lots of baking around. I will definitely be making this one again.

Taste and texture is wonderful. Used the chocolate version. Add 1-2 TBS brandy, or cognac to the batter. Add a TBS of kalua or "sabra" liquour to the chocolate batter. I use small loaf pans, making 3 or 4 loafs.

I wouldn't give this cake any forks, no homebaked aroma and the taste was absolutely bland. May be a ethnic thing, though I'm Jewish. I threw it out

I think that the cooks listed here made two different recipes... I have to side with those who did not like it. It was easy, it did rise nicely, but I thought it was very bland and mostly tastless. Sorry.

The taste was so so. Would not make this again. I've had better chocolate-orange cake before.

I BAKE NEARLY EVERYDAY AND THIS CAKE WAS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I HAVE EVER MADE, OR EATEN. I AM A CHOCOLATE NAD ORANGE LOVER AND THIS CAKE SHOWCASED BOTH FLAVORS SO WELL. BECAUSE OF THE OIL, IT STAYS SO MOIST. I PLAN ON MAKING IT AGAIN FOR A PARTY AND IT'S GREAT BECAUSE IT STAYS SO MOIST YOU CAN BAKE IT EARLY IN THE WEEK AND IT WILL STILL BE SO FRESH!

This recipe was one of two chosen from the recipes for Marble Loaf/Cake that I got off this site.I baked The Shabbat Mandarin Marble Loaf for a competion and it was chosen to go through to the final round,so I have to make it again as the first one was so nice it has all been eaten. I think I will be making this cake time after time. Thank you for an excellent recipe.
