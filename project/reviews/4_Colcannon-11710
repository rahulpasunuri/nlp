Good, but kind of plain as is. When I make mashed potatoes, which is rarely, I add a whole container (6 oz.) of plain yogurt-in general, this is enough for a large bowlful of mashed potatoes. Then I add some raw onion. I do not add butter to the mixture, but we do add butter, salt and pepper to our individual servings on our plates. I do not feel the butter can be tasted in the whole mixture anyway if added as an ingredient. The yogurt, however, gives a nice little tang which is NOT overpowering. Adding the butter, salt and pepper at the end is a wonderful blend with the slightly tangy yogurt flavor. I also fry the cabbage in a little oil (it does not take much oil). This gives the cabbage a MUCH better flavor than steaming it. It brings out the flavor, and sort of caramelizes it. Brown the cabbage until some of the shredded pieces are actually browned. Red onion makes a nice colorful touch as well. I find basic mashed potatoes where only a little milk and butter are added are very boring. I like my twist on it much better!

This is delicious and easy. I, too, add more butter to the potatoes and I do not use a ricer - I just mash them well by a hand masher.

In my family this was made after St. Patricks day or any day when you had left over potatoes, cabbage and corned beef. No butter, no cream just sauté the left over corned beef in olive oil, add cut up potatoes, cabbage and salt and pepper. Sauté together until a crust bottom forms and turn out. When the corned beef was gone we added scrambled eggs and called it Slumgullion.

I just wanted to note that I have used this method to add other greens (like kale, collards and mustard greens) to mashed potatoes. Sneaking some nutrition into comfort food always works for me.

Sauted an onion and the cabbage with some butter and added to mashed potatoes - delicious and easy way to use up cabbage and potatoes.

I've tried this with bacon and with italian sausage as some writers have recommended; I preferred the extra flavor of the italian sausaage, but both were yum! I've made the mashed potatoes with yogurt, but once with ricotta (it was all I had on hand) - it was amazing! One note: it sticks to your ribs, so plan a nap after eating if possible :)

Made this pretty much just as written, using yukon golds and a sweet biodynamic cabbage; delicious! Cooked the potatoes less time and for ease just used a regular masher instead of fussing with other tools. Scalded the milk in the big serving bowl in the microwave. Also, for simplicity I steamed the cabbage (in a pot insert) right over the cooking potatoes. I can't wait to try the other versions people suggested.

I made this for a dinner party. I did make the following modifications: sauteed cabbage with vidalia onions and 1/2 stick butter, salt and pepper. Added another 1/2 stick butter to the potatoes. A good friend from Ireland had three helpings and said it was the best he had ever tasted!

I've made this dish numerous times with the addition of onions and bacon. Next time, I'll leave out the onions, but the bacon stays.

Try sauteing chopped kale w/garlic and shallots in butter while the potatoes cook -- use broth instead of water. Then mash them all together with a little broth from the potatoes and some milk or cream...and don't forget -- lots of salt and pepper..Far beyond delicious!

I never had Colcannon with meat, either. I'm a vegetarian, and was having a vegan couple over for dinner. I served this, with modifications: Cut up the cabbage, and cooked it in the microwave-covered- for 8 minutes on high. Cooked the potatoes in vegetable broth (I cheated and used College Inn 14 oz. can). I also added a chopped up leek. I reserved the broth, and mashed the potatoes in the pot I cooked them in. I added a little of the cooking broth to keep them my favorite consistency. Put it in a casserole with the cabbage and served. The vegans loved it. I served it with grilled root vegetable kabobs.

I followed the suggestions to saute the cabbage rather than steam it but rather than bacon (didn't have any) I used a bit of butter and some olive oil. I added half an onion, too, and browned the batch a bit. This is quite tasty! Served with sausages for a nice warming meal. I've done a similar thing with kale. The contrasting color is quite nice.

I've never seen this recipe call for meat, so I don't add any. The first time I ever had it, it had mace in it, so I always use that. I slightly cook the cabbage in the potato water as I mash the potatoes. You can doctor it up with milk, or you can increase the richness as far as you want with cream. I generally use kale as well as cabbage, since the kale adds some more color. If I have it handy, I add some cracked white pepper and fresh parsley. I did find a "highlands" version that included some other root vegetables, so I will occasionally cook some turnips, carrots, and parsnips, and blend them into a puree with butter. After I've done the typical recipe, I add the puree and heat it all up. I occasionally reduce the water from the root veggies to put some of the sugar kick back in. Then you serve it with a stick of butter in a "well" in the potatoes' center. People love this dish!

I made this for St. Patricks Day-- it was fabulous! I followed some other reviewer's suggestions by sauteeing the cabbage with bacon and green onions, then adding everything to the mashed potatoes. My husband loved it, and he's not a mashed potato lover. I'm making it again today-- yum!

Agreed- fabulous. I sauted the cabbage and onion in chicken fat, added diced ham, and used cream instead of milk. And then I ate the leftovers for breakfast, lunch, and dinner the next day.

Fabulous dish. I agree with other reviewer. I sauteed bacon with onions and added shredded cabbage until all was limp. Then I mashed the potatoes and added bacon cabbage mixture and added rest of ingredients. To die for. A very European dish.

Hearty, tasty, and quick! I sauteed the cabbage with green onions and canadian bacon in a little olive oil and butter. I also added the milk right into the saute pan over med-low heat to keep things nice and hot as I mixed in the potatoes. Will definitely be making this again.

I did as I was told by the other reviewers and sauteed the cabbage in butter, with an onion, instead of steaming it. Then I spread the finished colcannon in a casserole and paved the top with browned "banger"-type sausages, and baked the whole arrangement at 375 till it got crispy around the edges. It was incredibly delicious -- perfect for a cold night.

Delicious basic recipe with some great suggestions for changing it up. I put green onions and leeks with the milk. Then, I basically sauteed the cabbage in the bacon grease rather than steaming it. I don't think you could go wrong with this one. YUMMY!

Now I know why cabbage and potatos are garden ready at the same time! I used Yukon golds. I sauteed pancetta (I prefer it to bacon for these type of dishes) with onions in butter and then added the cabbage and a little water. Smashed the potatos with butter and mixed it all together with a little salt and pepper and YUMMY!!!! Another cook recommended roasted garlic and that would be awesome too. Can't miss with this one!

I followed the advice of other reviewers, and sauted the cabbage with the butter and onion instead of boiling it. It was so good. I'm going to try adding bacon next time.

This is the ultimate comfort food! Made this to accompany corned beef for St. Patrick's Day dinner last night. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and sauteed the cabbage and onion in bacon fat. Used lots of butter and salt. Something about it satisfied the peasant in me, the textures of creamy potato and the slight resistance of the cabbage... I just had the leftovers for lunch and feel so good and happy now. I gave it four forks because it's a fabulous simple dish, and I prize that over fancy and complicated recipes.

I agree with other people who have rated this recipe that it treat on it's own. However, I like to use shredded cabbage, sauteed in a small amount of bacon grease and kale cut into small pieces and steamed to tender crisp. Add these and the bacon to the rich mashed potatoes and you have a meal! A true hit at my house as a side dish throughout the year!

Yum! My Irish eyes were smiling to have found (and made with ease) a yummy meatless food from the motherland! Taking a hint from another recipe I added some onions (1 small-medium, chopped) sauteed in butter until golden, and a pinch of dill and smaller pinch of nutmeg. With salt & pepper (& melted butter) it was very tasty!

My Irish relatives consider it a mortal sin to peel your potatoes before cooking them. :) So, they steam them about 30 mins then peel them while hot. In addition, ham is missing! Boil ham (about 45 mins) cut it in small pieces (kind of shredding it) and add it to the dish. To serve, put a good helping in a soup bowl, put a well in the middle with a spoon, then put a drop of butter in the well, and sprinkle with parsley. That's like the Colcannon I'm used to and love. Great comfort food and generally eaten as the main dish in my family.

I thought the recipe looked a little flat, so I added sauteed leeks, bacon cuts in bits, used only 1 Tbsp butter on the mashed potatoes, and I used olive oil and the brown bits left after frying the bacon to saute the cabbage til limp. The cabbage still had a touch of crunchiness to it (My husband does not like any vegtable cooked til mushy and is not crazy about cabbage to start with.) It came out very tasty. I do not think I would have liked it without the embellishments, as it was not a very assertive dish even with all that flavor added. Thumbs up to a cabbage dish hubby actually liked enough to save some left overs for lunch

I fixed this for St Patrick's Day dinner today and it was a huge hit! I followed others' suggestions by melting butter in a saucepan to "cook" the finely sliced cabbage and half an onion. I also added a bit of garlic, used lite sour cream instead of milk, and added bacon. The textures were wonderful! It was delicious and I shall make this in place of regular mashed potatoes when I can.

never had or heard of colcannon before but it was a great way to use up the stuff in my fridge and pantry! read other reviews and added a couple cloves of garlic and a half onion thinly sliced to the cabbage. no milk available so used non fat half and half. really tasty

Delicious! We sauteed a sliced onion and the cabbage in some of the butter, then covered it a bit so it would steam slightly. We heated the milk but didn't scald it; mixed it all together and thoroughly enjoyed it with a grilled swordfish steak.

This is a wonderful "comfort food"! I added the shredded carrots and chopped bacon. It also makes great potato pancakes!

Where is the bacon. Colcannon without bacon (or at least bacon fat, if the family is just getting by) is not colcannon, at least in our household. Also, needs more butter. Steam yellow onions with the cabbage or boil garlic cloves with the potatoes (and rice them in) for other alternatives.

Wonderful!! I added carrots as one reviewer suggested and my family really enjoyed it. I also sauted the cabbage instead of steaming it. I know that added to the calorie count but I think this makes the cabbage a bit sweeter. I am going to make potato pancakes with the leftovers.

This recipe is a HUGE hit. It is easy to increase the amounts to feed an Irish-sized dinner crowd. I also grate a carrot into the cabbage and steam them together. It adds a little sweeteness and color to the dish. Also, when I was travelling in Ireland I had a variation that included leeks with the cabbage. Yummy!

Our Scotch-Irish version, includes addition of a rutabaga and small carrot with the potatoes and cabbage. We also season it with Worchestershire sauce. It goes great with the Haggis.

Parsley and scallions can be added instead of the cabbage. In Ireland, it's often served for kids by making a well in the middle of a mound of colcannon, putting a little butter in the bottom, and filling the well with hot milk. Kids scoop a little from the outside, dip in the milk, and eat. The game is to eat as long as possible without breaching the well.
