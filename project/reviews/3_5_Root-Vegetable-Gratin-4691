I've made this on two occasions, varying a little each time. Both times it's been fabulous and very well received. Adding golden beets is a nice complement to the celery root!

Have made this several times and think it is delicious.

This was a very good recipe and quite easy to prepare. Be sure to generously season each layer with salt and pepper, otherwise the dish is a little bland. Very nice winter side dish.

My daughter made this when it first came out in the magazine, and it was great. Now I have found it again, and I will make it too!
