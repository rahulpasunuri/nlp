A bit labor intensive, but can be made ahead and kept for days. Proportions can vary. Used Vidalia instead of red onion; red, yellow and orange peppers. Didn´t need extra vinaigrette at end, so less can be made next time. Good side dish at room temp. Also good reheated and sprinkled with feta for a light lunch with crusty whole grain bread. Makes a good sandwich or omelette filling too.

Everybody really liked this as a change for the seder. But it was a lot of work and personally I didn't love it. It was a bit sweet. I did cut down the oil.

I made this for a party that had roasted lamb as entrée. It was a huge hit! I did cut the oil in half and ended up not having oil/dressing to drizzle on at the last but it was great.

I have made this dish several times, incorporating some of the comments of other reviewers (less oil, no endive) and adding some other veggies at times. I am just so glad that we are urged to serve this dish on a "round or oval platter." I would not know what to do with it otherwise! ;o) Imagine the poor cook who only has square platters! I'll bet it would equally attractive, and still taste fine, as well!

I should have read the reviews before making this. One cup of oil was way to much and I didn't even use all of it. The veggies were very greasy. 1/2 cup mixed with the balsamic should be more than enough. The veggies never got crispy because they were too saturated in the oil. The colors were nice, the taste was there...I would definitely try again. LESS OLIVE OIL!!!

This recipe is bland and bitter tasting, and too oily even though I cut the amount in half. The delicate flavor of the endives was overpowered by the eggplant, and at the amount they cost it is quite a waste. Make real Italian capanota instead.

This is a big recipe, so I would cut in half for two people. I marinated the peppers for a few hours and then cooked them first under the broiler. It took a long time to cook all of the other veggies between flipping and switching the trays. All in all a lot of work for grilled veggies. I would probably only do the pepper next time, but red and yellow ones made a nice presentation.

Used asparagus instead of endive - it was delicious and crunchy. Peppers didn't char as much as I would have liked but flavor was delicious and was a big hit with my dinner guests. I would make it again but instead of roasting in the oven, after marinating, I would grill on the outside grill.

Good basic oven roasted veggies. Cut back a little on the dressing and I think that they are better warmer than room temp. I added fresh grape tomatoes to the platter for color pizzaz. Easy and makes a nice presentation.
