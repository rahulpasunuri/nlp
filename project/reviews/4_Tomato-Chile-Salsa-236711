Excellent and very simple salsa with a little kick and nice smokiness from the chipolte. I add a few garlic cloves when roasting the tomatos and onion. Great on just about anything. Try on eggs.

Ordinary. Needed something different to really standout.

Slight smokey flavour from the chipotle and adobo nicely compliments the roasting in the broiler. We added 1/2 can of black beans both into the food processor and then rest of the beans with the cilantro. Great!
