REALLY GOOD! I used Italian turkey sausage for the chorizo, otherwise followed the recipe. The toppings are a must.

This recipe made for a tasty weeknight supper. I left out the sausage, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The tortilla strips were a nice surprise texture in the mix of eggs, onions and cheese. I served this with a simple winter salsa I make by pulsing canned tomatoes, chopped onion, chopped garlic, and cilantro in a food processor with cumin. Yum!

We really enjoyed this dish. Will definitely make again for the occasional calorie/fat splurge--it was worth the indulgence.

Being hispanic, I would not add sour cream to this dish. It just doesn't go. There is something called "migas" that is made this way, replace chorizo with onions. Delicioco! Add a little picante sauce (home made of course). Email me and I'll give you the home made hot sauce recipe.

Ingredients sounded great for the Southwestern food lover but results in an unappetizing appearance...the chorizo colors the mix and it needs something. Rather bland but the tortilla gave the dish an interesting texture.
