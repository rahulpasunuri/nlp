This dish was the "star" at a recent dinner party. Everyone loved everything about it. Who would have thought everyone wanted to know about dandelion greens. The flavors blended wonderfully. A new staple!!

I julienned and roasted a bunch of swiss chard leaves in place of the dandelion greens. I also shredded the Parmesan, which got distributed more evenly than I imagine. My squash was a little too sweet so a sprinkling of smoked paprika cured that. Otherwise, I'll make this again and try out different types of greens (dandelion greens aren't available here).
