I really liked this recipe. It was flavorful, but not overpowering. I might try slicing the potatoes next time to see if they'll get a little crisper, but otherwise it was great.

Made it for a brunch and everyone raved about it. It all disappeared. It took a long time though to cook all the potatoes to a nice brown, but apparently it was well worth the time.
