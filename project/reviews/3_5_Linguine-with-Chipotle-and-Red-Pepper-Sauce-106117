This was excellent. My husband made it and he followed the recipe, with no modifications.

Tasty! I tossed in some sausage for some extra protein.

This recipe turned out to be very easy to make. I'm vegetarian and found the mix of the ingredients interesting. The dish turned out delicious. It made a lot, even though I halved it for myself and my companion. I made it with whole wheat pasta and served it with a whole grain baguette. Loved the manchego cheese and the chipotle flavors. I will make it again for sure.

This was quite nice, using pecorino instead of manchego. Cilantro might acually be a better choice than parsley, though. What I didn't like: too much pasta, too little veggies, even with this rather huge amount of peppers. The pepper mixture would be ok for, say, 2 servings.

This was a bland recipe with a smokey flavor. I agree that it seemed to be lacking something.

I reviewed this before and gave it two forks, however my opnion of this dish has changed. I increased the amount of chilies and it is much better. I have made it for several potlucks and everytime I bring it, it disappears.

We didn't care for this dish, which was disappointing since we love everything in it. I think it would be much better with the addition of prosciutto, or even bacon, since it seemed to lack something. Even if you like spicy food, resist the temptation to increase the chipotle peppers. We found (from experience) that 2 is plenty.

This recipe had a good mix of spicy and sweet flavors, but it tasted like it was missing something. I might throw in some chicken next time, and I didn't really care for the Manchego cheese.

We just had this at one of our family get-togethers, and it was delicious! It's not much to look at, but the taste makes up for that.

Yum -- I couldn't stop eating this. Manchego is now my favorite cheese of the moment -- expensive, but delish! 1 substitution: I used white wine instead of sherry.
