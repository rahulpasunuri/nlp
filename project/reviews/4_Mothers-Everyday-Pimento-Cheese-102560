Do not change a thing. I grew up in the south and this is far better than any store bought pimento cheese. I use whole pimentos and cut them myself versus the pre cut pimentos which have less flavor. I serve this up with crackers and celery at dinner parties and people love it! I too feel almost guilty as it takes about a whopping ten minutes to prepare.

I've been making this spread for several years now, always gets rave reviews. I add about a teaspoon of smoked paprika and - if serving on the same day - a few stalks of chopped celery.

This recipe is simple and the closest thing to the pimento cheese that I remember from childhood. But, it's an acquired taste, and I thought it was a bit too heavy on the pimentos.

I'd never tasted pimiento cheese before, although I know I've heard it mentioned in novels. It was fine, but maybe since it wasn't a part of my NW upbringing, I don't understand the attraction. But it was easy enough, and I MIGHT consider making a cheeseball out of it during the holidays. Probably use medium cheeses next time, or half med/half sharp. It kind of wiped out my tastebuds.

Call me crazy. I just go out and buy my pimento cheese. Palmetto Cheese is hands down the best pimento cheese out there. There is a YouTube video on pimento cheese differences, here is the link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi80BajQP70

This is the recipe one of my favorite ladies in my hometown church has been making for years. It is the best- one of those recipes that is so easy you feel guilty when everyone raves. I chop chunks of cabot seriously sharp white cheddar and cabot yellow sharp cheddar in the food processor with the mayo and everything except the peppers. I add peppers at the end. Sometimes add worchestershire, garlic, onion or hot pepper from the garden.

Simple, classic and spot on Southern. For a nice kick, I add some good-quality chipotle powder. Cannot go wrong with this recipe.

Pimento Cheese is hard to find in Ontario Canada so I am grateful for this recipe to make my own. The only thing I do differently is to grate a small clove of garlic into the mixture. I don't use the " best" cheddar for this one either. A nice sharp cheddar from the dairy section at the grocery store works well for this recipe.

Just returned from the market where I picked up the ingreds for this longtime favorite. For those who like it with a bit of a kick, try using pimentons that most groceries carry on the olive bar. I agree that is isn't necessary to use a fine cheddar for this recipe.

This recipe is out of control delicious, and it's so easy. I threw it all in the food processor for mixing, which was easier than doing it by hand. It had a great kick, and everyone loved it as a dip or a sandwich spread. Check out more about my favorite recipes at www.adventuroustastes.com

I guess I admire the simplicity: this really is not much more than pimentos and cheese. I mashed and mashed but never did manage to get the tiny flecks of pimento, so the meat grinder is probably a good idea. This was OK, but I prefer my standard from Charleston Party Receipts with the grand marnier.

Very good. Serrano pepper complements it nicely.

If my Mom had made this, she would not have used the best chedder cheese. And taking the recipe name, not many more would have. It was an inexpensive snack using up cheese. However. This is a wonderful recipe. One can add garlic in any form & any other ingredients one would appreciate. Any combination of cheeses. That makes it "Everyday". Not the "best chedder cheese".

I made this completely in the food processor, adding the unchopped pimentos at the end. Served with untoasted slices of French bread (have them slice it at the bakery). My guests raved over it.

My husband loves pimento cheese. I have always found it to be too sweet(store bought). I made this and it was good. I added hot smoked spanish paprika. I was very good. I am making this again for New Year's Eve.

If you like this recipe, many of us here in Va. change it up by using 1/2 cream cheese and adding minced garlic! Wow

Great recipe for pimento cheese lovers. Honestly it tastes good on anything. Also one of those great recipes to play around with and try all different types of cheddar cheese and pepper sauce.

Excellent!! Holds up great for picnic sandwiches. Or a tasty addition to tea service, add paper thin slices of Vidalia or OSO sweet onions, cut off the crust or cut in fancy shapes. Also great stuffing for celery too!

My wife uses this recipe but substituted pepperjack cheese for the New York cheddar, because we like a little extra bite to it. It is not only good cold but also makes a great appetizer spread on toast rounds and run under the broiler just long enough to get a bit bubbly- great no fuss party fare!

I grew up on pimento cheese. From the deli or being made by my Mom...I love it. This one is delicious. Not to soupy - just the right consistency. I spice it up with various hot peppers sometimes.

I have been using this recipe for several years and it's a Favorite. My Husband didn't ever like pimento cheese until he tasted this. Now, it's a favorite in his lunch bag. I recently started working in a Coffeehouse in South Carolina and took this recipe in to try. The grilled pimento cheese panini is Now one of our No. 1 sellers at lunchtime.

I've always been curious about pimento cheese having read about it in Southern novels and cookbooks, so I decided to try this recipe. Since I'm a lazy, ignorant Yankee, I used my food processor to grate the cheese, chop the peppers and mix everything together. (I did add hot sauce though.) Wow - pimento cheese is now on my top 10 list of fantastic foods!!!!

I don't give 4 on this site very often - but I have made this over and over and over. Its truly very good.

Made this with 8 oz. Cabots seriously sharp cheddar and 8 oz. Cabots white cheddar. This is outstanding pimento cheese. For a change might occassionally add a bit of garlice or grated onion. For a true southern experience top with the thinnest slice of the seasons first Vidalia onion on homemade bread, pour yourself a tall glass of ice tea with a breath of mint and know that life doesn't get much better. Y'all come back now Y'hear.

I thought that this recipe was a good start. I roasted the peppers myself, since I was making this dish to use up the pimentos in my garden. I also added some worcestershire sauce and a little garlic, which gave the recipe some depth. I also used a three pepper blend instead of just black pepper because it was what I had on hand. I ate it everyday until it was gone! Next time I'll try the hot sauce idea.

Yum! I'm not normally a pimiento cheese lover, but this is a great version. I halved the recipe and it still made plenty - I've had it for lunch 7 days running. Don't omit the cayenne, as it gives just the right finishing kick. Hot sauce would be good too.

I made this for an appetiser for my supper club and they loved it. I made it into a block shape and topped it with a jar of a variety of marinaded olives. Serve with Ritz crackers.

This recipe is so easy, but you must follow the steps exactly to get the right consistency. It only took me 15 minutes start to finish. I could not find Vermont White Cheddar so I just doubled up on the New York Extra Sharp Cheddar. I also added three dashes of Tobasco sauce as I think it brings out the cheddar flavor even more and spiced it up. My husband is a pimento cheese aficiando and he says it's great.

My family absolutely LOVES this cheese, in fact my father asks for it as birthday and Father's Day gifts. I do not drain the pimentos however, I think it's much better with their liquid. This cheese is delicious on crackers at a party, or on bread for sandwiches (excellent with soup). Yum!

This is a very good version of pimento cheese. I like to use roasted red peppers in substitution of the pimentos for variety. Also a crushed clove or two of garlic adds the nicest background flavor.

Try it with toasted, lightly salted pecans and unsalted slivered almonds. Chopped green chiles, preferably the frozen kind, thawed and drained of course, are excellent. Use the "heat" you can stand. It IS addictive this way!! Becomes a 4+.

Having craved pimento cheese since my friend from Greensboro NC brought "Stans" back to the big apple (those of you who know Stans know what I'm talking about umm!) I've been craving it since. He suggested I make it and I did. It turned out to be GREAT :-) However, I added a dash of Jack Daniels no 7 mustered which added the extra kick. This will be a party favorite.

A family favorite made by my grandmother. Spread on white bread with the crust cut off and paired with cold fried chicken and deviled eggs, you have the makings for a true Southern picnic, cholesterol be damned! Substitute chopped pimento-stuffed green olives and chopped pecans for "blue moon" cheese.

I grew up on pimento cheese sandwiches as a child in the South---I had not made this ever as an adult in California--my daughter and I saw the recipe you printed last year for PC and our taste buds were whetted once again for the Old Southern Favorite--so, at Thanksgiving we made it and it was the hit of our Thanksgiving weekend...

I couldn't find white chedder, so I used a combo of mild and sharp orange chedders. It tasted fine - just a little brighter in color then you would expect pimento cheese to be.

Amazing! After 8 years in California, far from my North Carolina roots, this was just the comfort food I needed. You can add a dash of tabasco or a touch of worcestershire for a spicier taste. Beware though, the cheese will make it salty so don't salt unless you have tasted it first. It always tastes better if you let it sit for a few hours or overnight before eating. Try it spread in celery sticks or stuffed into fresh cherry tomatoes. I wish I had seen this recipe years ago (I've actually tried to bring containers of it back from trips home).

Please do buy the best cheddar you can afford. This is a rich dish and very satisfying in small quantities. Small toasted sandwiches are great with vegetable soup and round out the meal.
