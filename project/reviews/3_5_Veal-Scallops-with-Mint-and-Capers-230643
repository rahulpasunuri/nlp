distinctly soso. The capers and mint are not a good combination

Delicious and super-easy! Sauce would probably work well with pork, if veal is out of the budget.

This is 5 star restaurant quality or better! Just wonderful. The mint just makes this dish so do not omit. I highly recommend this recipe! Make sure you give the veal scallops a quick wack and you will get rid of the toughness.

I haven't made this recipe, but I'm giving it 4 forks just to offset the inappropriate "review" by mysonvaughn. Please go air your politics somewhere else. This isn't the place for them.

My fiance made this for me the other night and it came out wonderful! The veal itself was a bit tough (prob just due to the quality of the veal) but the flavor of the sauce was perfect! The mint added just enough kick, along with the capers to produce a very pleasing end result! I would definitely make this & serve for company. He served with orzo.
