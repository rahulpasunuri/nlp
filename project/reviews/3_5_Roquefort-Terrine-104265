This is one of our all-time favorite appetizers. It's easy to make and there is seldom any left (much to my disappointment - would love some the next day!)

I'm just hoping that there will be some left when my guests arrive! Delicious. I substituted half the butter for cream cheese because I was concerned about it being too buttery. Love it!!

I've made this recipe with a few modifications several times to rave reviews. Instead of using butter, I've used cream cheese. I've also added plain yogurt to thin the blue cheese mix. I've toasted the walnuts or peacans (whichever I've had on hand). I also serve it with celery sticks. Yum....

I'd give this zero forks if that were an option--horrible, horrible, horrible, and I like Roquefort normally. NO ONE at my party took more than a single tiny bit of this, at most. It looked very nice, but tasted WAY too buttery and strong.

I've made this on several occasions the past few months. It is addictive. I highly recommend if you are fan of Roquefort.

Excellent and easy. Nice because it it can be made far in advance. Will definitely make it again!
