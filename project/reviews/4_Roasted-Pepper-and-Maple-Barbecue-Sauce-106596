Loved the recipe. Easiest and best barbecue sauce I've ever made. It is a sweeter sauce so make sure you like that. I also let it reduce a little longer too thicken more.

This is the only BBQ sauce I use on ribs and is a request of friends and family constantly. We like it on the spicier side so I do 2 chipotle peppers with some of the adobo sauce. I let it reduce for 30 to 45 minutes to get a lot of the water from the peppers out. Slow cook the ribs on the grill and for the last 30 minutes baste and flip several times to get great grill marks and the sauce starts to caramelize on the ribs.

I thought this was exceptional, but my husband felt the sauce was too thin.

Love this sauce. We've had it on pork, chicken and salmon, and am sure it'll be a regular with burgers this summer.

Made this when I had leftover roasted peppers that had to be used. Served it with grilled steaks. Everyone loved it. The smoky-sweet-spicy combination is a winner.

I have the magazine and it's 1 teaspoon of adobo sauce (from can).

I would say 1 tsp adobo sauce...1T would be way to strong.
