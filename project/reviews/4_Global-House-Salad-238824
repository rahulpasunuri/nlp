An easy but tasty salad. Our guests loved it and I'll definitely add it to my repertoire. I used agave syrup in place of honey when I discovered I had no honey and like others, I used a Honeycrisp apple in place of the pear as I was serving poached pears for desert. This recipe makes enough for 4 as an appetizer and there was plenty of dressing left over - the recipe makes at least twice what you need. Paired the salad with a crisp dry Riesling wine which was a perfect match.

Very nice salad. Great flavor and texture. A nice change from the garden and Caesar salad. I will definitely make again.

I've made this recipe verbatim and also with changes. I added double the amount of sriracha (and tempered it with more honey) so I could taste the spice. Also, this recipe works well without blue cheese for a healthier salad.

This was a very impressive salad ... just like some of my favourite restaurant salads. I do think it benefits from a more tart fruit (rather than the sweet Anjou) and the second time made it with halved grapes which was an improvement. Another time I think a tart apple would be nice too.

Best salad I've ever made! I used honey crisp apple instead of pear and romaine. The dressing is a favorite in our house now!

I love this salad....I always volunteer this salad for potlucks... The recipe makes enough for at least 4 people. The secret is finding the right chili sauce for the dressing.

Simple to make, yet the blue cheese and candied walnuts were delicious together. I used an apple instead of a pear and it was reminiscient of a waldorf salad. Dressing was heavenly, I like it so much better than the raspberry vinaigrette you buy in the store.

this was ok, not the best i've ever had. i'd make it again, but the best advice i can give is not to dress it until the moment before you eat it!!!

I was not wowed by this dressing as I thought I would be after reading the rest of the reviews. I was expecting something a little more interesting with the hot sauce, but this ended up being ordinary.

A great twist on a vinaigrette dressing. My husband, who generally dislikes salads, loves this. I used feta cheese rather than the blue, and it worked well. You can also add some strawberries and thinly sliced white onion for more complexity. Make sure you use the pears, though.

This salad is delicious-even with other types of pears. The dressing is even better the next day! The friends who had this at a dinner party insisted that I can "make that yummy salad every time" they come over :)

Delicious! The flavors are perfectly balanced.

This is one of the best simple salads ever! I used a mix of endive and arugula and crumbled fried pancetta in addition to the other items in the recipe. The dressing is perfect. We took it to a party last night and we were asked to bring it to two other dinners. I would give it 5 forks!

I followed the recipe to the letter and everyone loved it! Even my kids (19 & 21) loved it.

I LOVE IT

what makes this a four fork recipe is that it is very simple, and yet has a light sophisticated taste. It goes well with plenty of mains, and is a standby in our house!

Made this last night and was so impressed! I made a salad as good as the best restaurants I have been to! Thanks Epicurious!

I'm allergic to walnuts. Substituted raw pecans. Because the pecans have a sweet finish, it was unnecessary to coat them with honey. This was a delicious, light, well-balanced and easy to make dish. Luv it! This dish will remain a part of my daily eats.
