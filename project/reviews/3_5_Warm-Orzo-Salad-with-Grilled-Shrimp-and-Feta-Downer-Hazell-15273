A wonderful recipe. I've made it a few times--just for the two of us and also for compamy. I've made it using both dried oregano and fresh. Both work well. Only real change--to cook the peas a full minute. They are till crispy but not quite so raw.

I needed a vegetarian (fish and seafood ok), gluten free, cow's milk free, sugar free meal for a potluck dinner. I chose this because of the fresh ingredients and ease of preparation. I substituted jasmine rice, which meant I had to boil the rice separately from the vegetables, which was easy enough. I added asparagus, used an entire container of grape tomatoes halved, and substituted basil for the parsley in the dressing and rice. It was winter so we cooked the shrimp inside under the broiler after marinating for an hour and they were amazing! To make them look bigger and cook evenly, we butterflied them first. Last substitution was using crumbled goat cheese instead of feta because of a cow's milk allergy. The cheese was wonderful because it provided a nice creamy tartness to go along with the salty shrimp and lemony rice. Although it sounds like I made a lot of changes, I actually made both the dressing and marinade exactly as the recipe stated. Everyone loved this dish, especially the shrimp!

My family loved this. we made it with shallots instead of garlic due to allergies and it was still great - a new staple.

I made this dish for a potluck picnic and it was so well received that it was requested the next time the same group of friends got together. The first time I made it I substituted a little fresh basil for the flat leaf parsley which was delicious. The second time I forgot to add the scallions and I sauteed the shrimp, however both times the dish was a hit with everyone. It's light, healthy, perfect summer-time fare.

Delicious. Very fresh tasting - good enough for guests (we served as a side). Didn't have orzo so used small shell shaped pasta, which worked very well.

So... I only made the orzo salad... and I made it with wheat berries instead of orzo... and I left out the feta... but the point: the flavor profile is great. The basic proportions on the dressing/herbs are perfect. I think the texture would probably be nicer with warm orzo and feta, but I was going for the fiber/health angle so there's my two cents. With the wheat berries it was still pretty darn tasty.

This is really good and reasonably healthy. I used a little more than 1 lb. of shrimp but otherwise changed nothing.

I made this for a party of 10 and what a hit! plate licking good. I added fresh mint to the final dressing and used fresh peas not snap peas . Be sure to use good feta- it makes a difference. Served with grilled steak on top of arugula and grilled radicchio.

Have made this dish before following the recipe and enjoyed it, but last night it was so much better. Used fresh basil instead of the parsley, more garlic and only one cup of orzo. The grilled shrimp on their own are great and I would make them again on their own.

I thought this was alot of work for the result. It did disappear at table though. Perhaps it was missing something because I had to use dried oregano. I might try this again but change the parsley to dill. I'd also peel the tomatoes.

I am giving this 3 forks b/c my husband really liked the dish. I think something was missing...maybe more lemon & some texture. I will try it again & add some toasted pine nuts. I followed the recipe, but added some sun-dried tomatoes, kalamatas & roasted bell peppers.

Very Very good. It was 108 outside so wanted something easy and cool. Had to use jasmine rice due to wheat allergy, and it was just great. Definite do again. Had garden greens so made a "nest" like effect on a large platter and put a bottom layer of tiny thin green beans-also from garden- and then put this salad on top. I did add a bit more garlic since we can't seem to get enough and a bit of lemon zest to the dressing. Family had disagreement over who would get some for lunch the next day..salad was even better next day. Going to use this for potluck dish and add some marinated artichoke hearts, kalmata olives and maybe some pine nuts for garnish.

Love this recipe. Even my picky 8 year old daughter ate it all and asked for more. Both kids said 4 forks weren't enough. Made it as is except I left out some of the scallions. Once I chopped up the 6 (they were pretty big) it looked like too much. Also, I just wisked the dressing instead of breaking out the blender and it came out fine. Delicious!

What a great dish! Used asparagus & added some mint leaves at the end, although my husband's palate kept me from adding garlic to the dressing (but not the marinade! I have standards!) or the scallions (sigh). Even so, lovely lemony flavor & the herbs come through nicely. I will definitely make this again.

Loved this recipe...easy and able to do much ahead of time. Took the advice of the asparagus, olives and grape tomatoes. Added 4oz of feta as well...and just as good the next day.

All the components for a great recipe. Tasty, easy to prepare, and minimum clean up. I sub'd asparagus (it's what I had on hand) cut thin on the bias for the snap peas, and added kalamata olives. I also used extra feta. Enjoyed the orzo cold for lunch the next day. Family enjoyed it so it's a keeper. With summer on it's way, it'll be great for entertaining, served with a riesling or pinot gris.

I made the recipe with two small substitutions - peas for the snap peas and halved grape tomatoes for the whole- and really liked it. Thought the feta was skimpy, so I added more of that. Maybe next time I will add a bit more lemon, and try mint to give it a little extra something. The leftovers eaten cold today were even better than last night. All around a hit in my house on a warm evening.

this was phenomenal! time consuming, but well worth the effort. i made with broiled chicken, marinated just as you would the shrimp-turned out great, i will try shrimp next! note: leftovers are great as a chilled salad.

A great recipe, full of flavor and VERY colorful. We used dried oregano instead of fresh and grilled the shrimp on an indoor grill with no problems.

This is a great recipe, well worth the effort. The marinade works well with grilling chicken also. Using grape tomatoes also adds to the taste and presentation. I have made this dish several times with lots of compliments from friends.

Full, RICH flavor; delicious! Substituted rice for orzo, and broccoli for sugarsnaps. Asparagus might also be nice. Looking foward to orzo next time around. Also cooked rice using some liquid from feta to carry the flavor further. Had to saute (v. grill) the shrimp; -did nicely! Since I hate to waste beautiful lemon peel, I added lemon zest to the blender dressing; garnished salad with rest. (1 small lemon, and a bit short of the ~4 T. needed. Nice addition!) -Seems this might be nice chilled as well, for a picnic or fall tailgate lunch; simple, one-dish ease. If so, might cut shrimp in half to handle those pesky disposable forks better. For presentation, I'll try a bed of red and green leaf lettuces, whether on a platter or in indiv. bowls.

I thought this could have used a bit more oregano, although I used West Indian oregano because that's what I picked up at the greenmarket. Overall it was good; added chopped Kalamata olives and used a great not-salty domestic feta. Made this with chicken instead of shrimp because that's what I had on hand; were I to make it again I'd try it with shrimp, and maybe use mint in place of oregano.

This was a wonderful dish! I used jumbo prawns and arranged them around the salad for a beautiful presentation. I'm not sure why so many thought there was too much chopping-the dressing is made in the blender and the parsley in the salad is whole leaf (though I chopped mine a bit) other than that you slice some scallions and tomatoes and viola! I added a bit of vinegar & Dijon to the dressing also and it was very good.

This recipe is very adaptable to taste. I added cucumber and used sweet yellow tomatoes. Instead of grilling the shrimp, I cut them into bite-sized pieces and sauteed with a bit of butter. Ground red chile from New Mexico added the kick.

The comments from Los Gatos and VT. inspired me to try this recipe. I purchased fresh oragano, parsley and spiced feta cheese. However when I started the recipe I realized that I only had a 1/2 cup of orzo so I used three grain risotto to make up the difference. It is an elegant yet easy dish to make.

This salad was good, but not great -- I thought it needed more oregano and less parsley. Would also be good with herbed feta. T marinated grilled shrimp were wonderful, though. I will probably just make the shrimp in the future and serve them as appetizers.

This was simple and looked great! To the reviewers that thought it was too much work,there are web sites that have recipes where you just dump stuff out of cans.

To the reviewer from VT (below)-- what polished social skills you have, and you've obviously obtained a doctorate from the Harvard School of Efficiency. Ever think about contributing your input in a less offensive way, like perhaps trying the recipe your way and THEN sharing your streamlined techniques with the world? Please do keep us all posted on your keen insights, and we'll be sure to check for other recipes you haven't yet tried but deemed the author illogical anyway. BTW, the ratios of the same ingredients are different in the marinade and dressing -- maybe there's a reason for that.

I actually didn't make this recipe, just read it and read the reviews. The recipe is fussy and difficult because the author was not thinking about efficiency. The recipe would be improved enormously by making one batch of the dressing/marinade omitting the parsley. Then divide the mixture in half and use half as marinade and half as dressing. Omit the parsley in the dressing because you are going to chop up a cup and add it to the salad anyway. Why don't people use a little logic when they write a recipe? The ingredients look good. I will make this recipe in this alternative fashion and let you know how it turns out.

yum. This was very good, especially if you like feta. But it certainly isn't a quick dish to make, all of that chopping and soooo many ingredients. I don't think I'll be making this one frequently, but I may make it again.

I selected this dish because a previous reviewer said it was easy. It wasn't! Even with the purchase of pre-cooked shrimp- there were too many steps and too much chopping and pureeing to be considered "easy." But it was good.

My husband and I really liked this recipe. I used less olive oil and parsley than called for, and just broiled the shrimp after marinating. Really good tomatoes make a big difference!

This is a seriously easy and delicious dish (even tho I cheat and buy cooked fresh prawns from the fish market) Takes only minutes and even my foodie friends made pigs of themselves.

I added broccoli florets to the mix instead of the sugar peas. It was a better combination for someone not fond of peas, and tasted very good.
