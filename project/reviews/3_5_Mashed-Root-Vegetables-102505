I wish I could say that "I wouldn't change a thing" but for this recipe I definitely would! And did. I followed to a 't' as written, but after mashing and seasoning with s&p, the result was somewhat bland. However the addition of grated parmesan and some Lawrys Seasoned Salt did the trick. The color of this dish is fantastic, and the flavors were a delightful complement to broccoli and spicy salmon. Plus, in this menu I was able to use the organic produce from our weekly CSA box, which always makes me happy!

This recipe is a new personal favorite! I'm not a fan of cooked carrots or parsnips, but I added two small carrots as well as one small parsnip to this, half of an onion and three times the garlic and dang. I skipped dessert last night to have a second serving of this and just finished heating up some of the leftovers for breakfast this morning. It's keeper!

Finding rutabagas in September in Louisiana turned out to be more of an endeavor that I bargained for, but it was all worth it in the end. This was colorful and well balanced! Not too carrot-y, not too potato-y. It you are big on spice, you may want to add more garlic.

I made this as a side for my halibut. I don't see why everyone waits for Thanksgiving or Xmas to enjoy this. The coloe and texture is awesome. Perfect alternative for boring mashed potatoes. This is my new favorite side dish.

I made it for Thanksgiving, and everyone loved it so much that I made for Xmas too! It was terrific with goose.

I substituted baby carrots for whole carrots. This would have been fine, but I over-compensated and added to many. This took away from the dish (but that was MY mistake, not the recipes!). I have never tried rutabegas before making this dish. I look forward to making it again (& doing it correctly) because I think it will be really great as long as the carrots are not overdone. We served with Ham-gravy at Easter dinner. If you double the recipe like I did, be sure to stir up the chunks on the bottom so that they do not burn!

I agree this would make a great Thanksgiving dish. It has a lovely golden color, great flavor, and creamy texture without having to use milk or cream. We used a handblender, all farmstand organic veggies, and new, unpeeled potatoes. So healthy even with the butter! In the future I would mix in all the parsley and "sprinkle" with fresh grated nutmeg to garnish.

Great taste! Interesting! Nice color! Just slightly dry.

I can't believe I'd rave so much about something so simple - root vegetables! But this was sooo tasty. We've never tried rutabaga before; it gave a nice "bite" to this which contrasted with a hint of sweetness from the carrots ... mmmm. I would not change a thing about this recipe and can't wait for the opportunity to make it again and again!

made it with potatoes, carrots and a couple parsnips... heaven. Christmas guests couldn't believe their luck. It was perfect with ham. Even my mom, who hates parsnips, loved the combo of flavors.

Excellent even for fussy eaters. I made this as an accompaniment for Christmas Day dinner and didn't make enough and we ran out. The flavors go together so well.

Mellow, mild, rich, what a great side dish. Much better than plain mashed potatoes. Excellent at Thanksgiving. Needed to add a bit of butter and cream (or milk).

An excellent traditional side dish! We will make this often. A very nice, lower-fat alternative to mashed potates.
