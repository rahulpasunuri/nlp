Excellent recipe! I find blanching 3 times to be enough (NB: peel floats the first time.) Adding a quarter teaspoon white Karo syrup to the sugar solution makes it less likely to crystallize. Tastes delicious dipped in bittersweet chocolate too!

I've used several recipes for candied peel but find this is the best recipe and the easiest. 8 hours drying time is enough, otherwise the strips lose their stickiness and the dusting sugar does not adhere.

I made these to put on top of a chocolate cake. The peels turned out the way they were supposed to, so I was satisfied with this recipe.

I inadvertently reviewed a different version of this recipe so want to make clear that THIS is the version I use. I follow it to the letter (e.g., only remove the rind in quarters) except that I do usually let the pieces dry overnight before rolling them in superfine sugar. Have once or twice also re-rolled a few that got that "wet" look, and with no bad consequences. This is a great addition to a dessert table or a hostess gift. That's if I can keep myself from eating them all.

When I worked as a cook at The Inn at Little Washington this was basically the procedure that we used for the g-rinds included in the cookie baskets given to guests at the end of their meal. I recommend that the rinds be allowed to dry on wire racks overnight before being coated with superfine. This will prevent the sugar from becoming saturated by residual moisture in the peels.

These always get rave reviews and are esp nice after dinner with coffee. Had no trouble with them getting sticky again, be sure to air dry as stated and use superfine sugar for final dusting.

Works well with all types of citrus except limes. Please see further comments on Candied Grapefruit Strips.

The result was very good, although the finished pieces of grapefruit rind got sticky again within hours after sugaring. I simply left them that way and they were fine for us, but I would not have wanted to give them as a gift. They were wonderful when coated with melted chocolate. To peel, I quartered the entire grapefruit and separated fruit from rind; the recipe implies that you should quarter just the rind part.
