I used yellow and orange peppers in the puree, then red, greena and orange along with the mushrooms because that's what I had. I added spinach in the last seconds of cooking the pasta and drained along with it. This is a keeper!

Recipe was easy and good enough for a weekday meal. I used 1C milk and 1/2C ricotta for sauce. I added shallots and basil to the yellow peppers and onions to boost the flavor. Also, I did not use mushrooms but I roasted the red and orange peppers in the oven while I made the sauce. I used whole wheat pasta.

This has been a home run with my family for years now. I first tried the recipe in 2001 and have made it many times since. It is always enough to satisfy everyone and seasoning can be added to improve flavor as needed. Today I am trying the suggestions listed here and adding Italian Sausage to the recipe for body and flavor.

What a copious dish! The sweetness of the peppers was a bit cloying, but otherwise worked well with the remaining flavours. Puree releases more of the sweetness, so experimenting with reducing the amount of peppers is recommended. The dish came out bit runny. I would reduce the cream to 1 cup and decrease the cheese to 1 1/2 cups. Be prepared for a rather large production.

This was so, so delicious! I LOVE THIS SAUCE!! I could have drank it all before my guests arrived. :) I used low-fat cream cheese and a little skim milk instead of cream to reduce the fat content. I added spinach, basil and red pepper flakes and omitted the mushrooms and green onion. I also roasted the peppers, onion and garlic in the oven, which gave it a nice smoky flavor. It was colorful, creamy and rich with flavor. I agree with another reviewer that the presentation is a bit rustic. I think next time for a nicer presentation, I will make the sauce and pasta, plate it, top it with parmesan and garnish with basil, instead of baking it.

First, my substitutes. Used both yellow and orange peppers for the sauce. Used whole milk and about 1/2 cup low fat cream cheese instead of cream. Also, dumped in the whole amount of parmesan by mistake, and then sprinkled some on top. Also, used whole wheat penne. The result was a yummy, cheesy and relatively easy pasta that can easily serve 8 and will be a hit with bell pepper lovers. Served it with a simple arugula and tomato salad with balsamic dressing. It is pretty time consuming for such a seemingly simple dish, but well worth it. This will be a repeat performer. I want to try it with garden fresh peppers when they become available.

I have made this four times now and all the diners absolutely love it and can't stop raving about it. I followed one reviewer's suggestion of putting sausage in it, but I used veggie sausage instead and the Rastas love it!

This recipe is AWESOME! People could not get enough of it. Followed recipe exactly (the reserved pasta water has starch that helps thicken sauce and the water keeps pasta moist while baking) and it was yummy. Will make again.

This is an excellent dish to serve to a family gathering or close friends. Too much work for a regular weeknight supper; rather hearty and not very elegant for a real dinner party. I added sliced italian sausage links purchased from Costco and used good Asiago cheese. Omitted the cooking water -- that just seems bizarre. Otherwise followed the recipe as written and everyone LOVED it, myself included! Defintely a keeper for the right kind of meal!

I'm one of the decenters. Based on reviews,I used more garlic, veggies, cheese, and added browned Italian sausage. I thought the result was just fine for a weeknight dinner but nothing to rave about.

This is delicious, a nice receipe for a buffet table or as a main course for vegetarians. I cooked the peppers and mushrooms separately because there is just too much for one pan, and I used excellent Parmigiano Reggiano, which is expensive, but really makes the dish. It'e not "a dish beyond compare," but definitely a keeper.

My first recipe to make from epicurious. It was wonderful. I added some small tomatoes to sauce for color and white wine to the mushroom sautee. Sure to be a staple at our house.

Everyone I have made this recipe for has loved it!. I did add fresh basil and extra garlic to the yellow pepper sauce, which gave it more flavor. I have also added a variety of fresh vegetables since red and orange peppers are not always in season.

This dish got great reviews at our house! Added one small can of diced tomatoes. Increased garlic. Served as a side dish with grilled chicken breasts. Beautiful and quite tasty!!!

I have made this dish twice following the recipe exactly (except I forgot to rinse the pasta) and I thought it was excellent. Everyone else loved it too!

The yellow pepper sauce is simple, yummy and the most beautiful shade of light yellow and the dish is beautiful with the colored peppers. Next time I will use a fresh herb like basil, thyme or marjoram. You don't need to rinse the pasta and then add a cup of pasta water to the sauce. Don't do either and the net effect is the same because you will get a little starch from the unrinsed pasta into the sauce when you mix them together.

This was great! I increased the garlic to 12 cloves, added 1 tsp of red pepper, a load of basil, and added cremini mushrooms. With these changes, it wasn't bland at all. Love it!

too flavorless to be worth the effort. Needs spices. Or more ingredients (like tofu, or ground beef).

You definitely will get 8-10 servings from this dish.That said I didn't think it was at all bland.I used a very fresh onion and extra garlic for the sauce and it tasted great.If you like mushrooms add more.I think I would make this as a side dish next time.

Stick with the traditional red sauce Ziti, unless you are a big fan of cream. Regardless there still isn't enough flavor in this dish. Don't waste your time with this recipe.

This was a lot of work for a dish that is good, but not spectacular. I probably wouldn't make it again. I added crumbled, browned sausage which helped and also a handful of fresh, slivered basil (which it really needed).

This was a great dish -- I added 6 hot sausage links (casings removed and sauted) --but would add twice as many next time, and would also double the mushrooms. I also would add a little less pasta water. I loved the yellow pepper-cream sauce, but thought that the pasta watered it down too much. Maybe more peppers next time? I froze it -- and it reheated beautifully!

I just tried this recipie and thought it was delicious! I read some of the other reviews and went with adding 1 pound of hamburg with slices of sweet sausages. I used leftover spaghetti sauce and added just enough to cover meat mixture. It was very good. Family loved it and will certainly make it again and again!!

This dish was delicious. It takes a fair bit of prep time, but the result is worth the effort - a real crowd-pleaser. Next time I might add some italian sausage to make it a little heartier.

Easy to make (though it's a bit of chopping) and everyone liked it. My health nut friend frowned at the amount of cream in it, but I'll admit too that you could cut it down a bit and keep the taste. Would also experiment with some spices next time, maybe add some fresh herbs.

On a rainy day stuck in a cabin, what better way to entertain than to get everyone chopping? We made this for 30+ people, originally thinking it could be an alternative for those not eating meat...well, all three glass cassarole dishes were EMPTY before we knew it! The yellow pepper and onion puree is gorgeous, and the piles of chopped red and orange peppers and mushrooms are beautiful. Even the most tried and true carnivores were full and happy after this one. It does need quite a bit of salt, and don't be stingy with the cheese, either.

Just awesome! I made this a few nights ago, and it pleased the entire family. The only think I might do a bit differently next time is to add a bit of sauted garlic at bake time.

This recipe for baked ziti is mouthwatering. What I did to make it a little better was I browned one pound of ground beef and made a red sauce with that (diced peeled tomato's, and tomato paste) and I made that the bottom layer and put cheese on top of that then the pasta with the pepper sauce on that and cheese on top of that. It turned out excelent. Alot of preperation but it was worth it!

My roommate and I made this for our college eating club of 50+ people. Even that large of a quantity was easy to make with the help of a food processor, and everyone LOVED it. Plus the leftovers made fantastic lunches for days. We're just two culinarily clueless college students, but this recipe definitely gets an "A" from us!

Made this yesterday, was not impressed with the final baked product. The creamy yellow pepper sauce was good. That sauce tossed with cooked pasta and chesse, plus the peppers as a garnish, served right away tasted much better.

This was a pretty tasty recipe. My husband liked it a lot. Because of what I read in other reviews I added some garlic salt to the pepper sauce. It was good, but for the effort that goes into it I am not sure it was great! I might make this again, but I am not positive.

This was a big hit with my family. My six year old even asked for seconds, unheard of in my house. It is almost perfect in every way, but next time I make it....I think I'll add a little more salt or garlic salt....aside from that a big hit. Thanks for the recipe.

I had found this recipe in the magazine years ago and lost it. I searched everywhere and could not find it until I decided to start looking through recipes on the web and found it. I am looking forward to making it again it is definitely one of the best recipes that I make for large gatherings, and no extra spices are needed!

Unless your parmesan is very flavorful, this dish will be rather bland. It needs thyme, oregano, mace, and a bunch of other spices. But then once you start adding in a lot of other ingredients, are you really using this recipe any more?

Rating: 3
Very good. But I didn't use as many peppers in the puree so it probably came out creamier for me which was just fine. Also I added a little more seasoned salt, but overall I'd say it's a keeper.

I have made this a few times, and it is consistantly good! You may want to add a little garlic salt, otherwise it's great. I use a hand blender to puree the red peppers. Much quicker!

I discovered this recipe in an edition of Gourmet magazine which I then managed to lose. I found it again online and emailed it to a friend. We both now count it among our favourite pasta dishes and are competing to add different ingredients. Courgettes - sorry, zucchini - are currently flavour of the month..

I used 1 pound of button mushrooms and 1 pound of portabellas. I also increased the garlic in both the yellow pepper puree and the sauteed mushrooms/peppers. I used both imported Parmesan and aged Asiago in the dish and what I sprinkled on top. It was good, but not spectacular.
