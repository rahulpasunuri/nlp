This recipe is quite good. The beurre blanc (Butter sauce) goes well with the scallops and the coriander gives the dish a nice complexity. To awensveen: The recipe does not say anything about hollandaise sauce, it says quite clearly, "butter sauce/beurre blanc". Also, bernaise is just a hollandaise emulsion using tarragon and tarragon vinegar in place of lemon juice. Reading some of the reviews by people that do not have their facts straight is extremely frustrating especially when it is a reviewer that should do a bit of research before giving any ratings or opinions on any recipes. JMHO

The recipe as written is fairly dull as the acidity is totally missing from the butter sauce. Replace the water with white wine and the onion with shallot. The recipe speaks of hollandaise when in fact this is really the technique for bernaise. As such you should not have a thin runny sauce.

This is so surprisingly good! I also used shallots and white wine, as others noted. Tossed the scallops in melted butter instead of oil before grilling. Grilled only 2 min max per side. At the end, I tossed most of the sauce with some baby spinach, then topped it with the scallops and drizzled the rest of the sauce. Fantastic!

This is one of our favorites! My boyfriend usually inhales his while I'm on my third bite. I sub shallots for onion and white wine for water (as previously noted by commenters). I dry the scallops and dust with s&p, as well as brush with olive oil. I also always double the recipe. We usually serve the scallops on a bed of angel hair pasta. The reason I'm reviewing tonight, however, is because I finally was able to grill the scallops (instead of pan sear). YES, GEORGE FOREMAN! The flavors jumped from awesome to spectacular. Definitely try to grill the scallops and if you're stuck in an apt with no grill, get yourself an indoor grill.

Yum, yum, yum, Yum, YUM! This was an excellent, flavourful sauce to accompany my grilled scallops! It was not too strong as to overpower the delicateness of the scallops, and had a delightful sweetness to it. I, too, substituted white wine (homemade Chardonnay)for the water, as recommended by others. I also used shallots in lieu of the onions, which turned out to be a great change. I will absolutely, positively make this recipe again!

I completely botched this recipe but it was still good! I didn't have any fresh onion, so I used dried minced. I did not reconstitute it first, so when I put in in the pan with the coriander, vinegar and wine (which I substituted for the water, and doubled, per earlier reviews), it all evaporated within a minute! I proceeded to add the butter (1/2 stick), and it turned into an onion marmelade! By now, I was laughing, and decided to broil the bay scallops (because they were half the price of the sea scallops and it was now raining outside). When they were done, I stirred them into the marmalade and served with rice. It really was very good. I have to imagine it is even better when you actually follow the recipe ;)

Excellent! My boyfriend and I made this 20 mins. before i had to leave for work. we used white wine instead of the vinegar, salted butter, and only ground coriander! wonderful!

Like other reviewers, I subsituted white wine for water. Also, I replaced the garlic with shallots- which made the sauce even smoother. This has become our standard dih for guest. and our 18- month old son's favorite dish... scallops just melt in your mouth. Miam!

Delicious! We reduced the butter amount a little bit and used two cloves of garlic, too, and only dried coriander-- it was great!

I took inspiration from this recipe but substituted rice vinegar and added Thai seasoning - grilled on the Weber using Reynolds Release foil (best thing in the world) and they were delicious! Great flavor!

Easy and tasty. Scallops taste better grilled (or pan seared) because they brown.

Turned out well with a few modifications - I added garlic, used rice vinegar instead of white wine vinegar, and used a bit of dry vermouth for some of the water. Also only used ground coriander and added a touch of dijon mustard to the sauce. Even my seafood hater liked it.

Absolutely delicious!

Easy and delicious!!! I took the advice of others and substituted dry white wine for the water and added 1 clove of minced garlic. We found that scallops are hard to place on skewers so we grilled on top of a metal grill tray on the gas grill. Grilled corn was a great side dish.

I made this dish last night, and it was superb! I also used white wine instead of the water, as suggested from previous reviewers. I made according to recipe otherwise. I plan to make this for dinner parties in the future.

This might quite possibly be the most delicious thing I've ever put in my mouth (with the wine substitution). We grilled fresh veggies and fruits with an herb and butter blush all on an outdoor grill, and we were groaning with each bite. I'm a Personal Chef so we are used to excellent food. This was extraordinary. Try it. It's easy and you won't be disappointed.

Can't say I was in love with this recipe...the sauce was too vinegary. If I made it again I would halve the vinegar, but I'd rather try a different recipe.

Hi! Followed another reviewer's advice and used wine instead of water - good call. I didn't use any vinegar and wish I had. I would've prefered the dish to be a bit more piquant (sp?). Still the lemony-butter flavor was surprisingly good. Also, used bay scallops and some chopped sea scallops. The sea scallops were much more managableto cook. Next time I try: I'll (1) add some lemon to the butter sauce when it's finished; (2) use sea scallops and (3) try on an outside grill! Cheers!

Very easy and tasty with a couple of modifications. I used white wine instead of water and added one clove chopped garlic. Also, I only cooked the sea scallops for 1 1/2-2 min. per side and they were perfect.

OMG! On a scale of 1-4 this is a 5! I used champagne vinegar because I had no white-wine vinegar. Very delicate.

Outstanding. I don't even like seafood, and I thought these were wonderful. I made them for guests, but ended up devouring them, along with everyone else. I took the advice of other reviewers and make extra sauce.

Made this for my girlfriend today and she absolutely loved it. Its really simple to make and I'm sure it would compliment other shellfish dishes beautifully too.

this was my first time preparing scallops and it was so much easier than i expected. my husband and i both loved this dish. we felt like we were eating at a restaurant! i highly recommend this recipe, even if you are a not an experienced cook.

Wonderful. Restaurant quality. We're not fresh coriander/cilantro fans, so I, too, substituted the ground coriander at the end of the recipe. I doubled the sauce for 1# scallops. Also lightly dredged the scallops in seasoned flour and sauteed in minimum amount of vegetable oil in a non-stick skillet.

Magnificent! I didn't have any fresh coriander, so added another tsp. of ground coriander at the end. Also, I used 6 Tb. of butter after reading other reviewers desire for more sauce. One tip for frozen scallops: to get the scallops to brown, use a large skillet with more surface area to help the water to evaporate.

Excellent, the coriander was delicious. I served the scallops on top of little mounds of slightly crispy-fried Chinese noodles.

The sauce was very good. The scallops I used were also good, and went well with the sauce. I put some steamed green beans on the plate, and it was a very nice summer lunch.

This was my third attempt at making this type of sauce (a beurre blanc) and I was finally successful, because (1) I froze the butter pieces, (2) whisked the mixture constantly and kept it mainly off the heat, and (3) made sure to add a new piece of butter before the previous piece had completely melted. Now that I know I can do it, I'll make beurre blanc more often. This is a very nice recipe, and the sauce went well with the spinach, and with the long grain-wild rice mixture that I served alongside the scallops. Unfortunately we get only frozen sea scallops here, and they don't brown well due to their high moisture content. I'm going to try cutting them in half horizontally and squeezing them somewhat dry in a tea towel before cooking them.

I thought the scallops were very good. My wife thought that they were a bit bland. I think that next time I would make a bit more sauce.

This was quick and easy. The butter sauce was light and yummy. I think I will make a little more the next time. I served it over spinach with rice and my finicky family members loved it. Nothing was left!

I tried this recipe tomite along with spinach, stir fried and seasoned with garlic, white wine vinegar, and olive oil, and fairly dry mashed potatoes. I feared the sauce would tend to be perhaps to oniony, or strong vinegar, but it was perfection itself. This recipe is a definite keeper.

Terrific recipe! Very easy to make and delicious. I accidentally used ground cumin instead of corriander, but it still came out great.

Delicious! I found the sauce a bit difficult to make because I wasn't working in my own kitchen. However, I will make this again in my house and I am sure it will be fast! I served it over rice and steamed spinach! Wonderful!

Delicious, delicate flavor. I served the scallops on a bed of fresh spinach and spooned the sauce on top of everything as there's plenty to spare.
