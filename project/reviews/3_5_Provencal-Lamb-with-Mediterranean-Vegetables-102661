The spices complement the flavour of the lamb very well. I made this with lamb chops and rubbed a garlic clove over the meat before coating it with the spice mix. A nice change from the usual garlic and rosemary, and fairly quick and easy.

This is excellent! The crust of spices on the lamb is very flavorful and matches perfectly with the Mediterranean Vegetables and Polenta with Fontina (both Bon Apetit recipes) Together, they are a perfect balance of flavors. This is a great meal for special occassions--I'm making it for my husband for Valentine's Day this year!
