This is the best brownie recipe of all according to my husband. It has been a standard in our house since I first found it on this site.

Really good! Would probably add another 1/2 cup of chocolate covered raisins to next batch. They stay a lot moister than the Triple Chocolate Brownie recipe on this site which used to be my favorite.

I am a huge fan of chocolate raisins and this recipe was very good, but not great. I think that a nice frosting or ganache topping would have made a big difference. Good choice if you're craving for a brownie.

Finally, a brownie recipe that doesn't call for nuts but a take off of the Chunky bar. The raisins were a welcome change. Will make again and again!

These were very good. in the past I have found that brownies made from scratch are to cakey these were fuddgy and very good.

This is the best brownie recipe I've ever tried! They turned out just the way I like them....moist and brimming with chocolate flavor. Great recipe!

OHHHHH MY GOODNESS!!!!!!! These were the best brownies that I ever tasted! I brought them to work as a treat for the girls and they just couldnt keep their hands off of them! Nor could my hubby! The chocolate kind of melts off of the raisins a bit, and just makes the brownies taste like fudge!...definately not for the weak hearted! haha

The raisins provide a great new taste.

These are absolutely fantastic! Sometimes I use a combination of bittersweet and semisweet chocolate when I have a serious chocolate attack.

I thought this was a great new taste to a traditional brownie.
