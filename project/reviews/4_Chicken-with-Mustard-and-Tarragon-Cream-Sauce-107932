I reviewed the recipe on 1.17.13. That review still stands. Fresh it was 4 stars! However, I felt that I had to come back and update my review. I really enjoy leftovers, however the leftovers from this recipe were a faint glimpse of what it was like fresh. I ate some of the leftovers for dinner the following night. Not impressed at all. Yuck. I actually threw out the remaining leftovers rather than taking them for lunch. It did not reheat at all, and this makes me very sad because it was a very delicious 'fresh' dish.

Yum, this recipe is a Star! Delicious, quick, easy, with ingredients on hand! YAY! I followed the recipe as written, with only one only minor adjustment. Two teaspoons of mustard did not provide enough flavor, so I increased it to my satisfaction, over 1T I would guess. Can't wait to impress guests with this recipe!

outstanding! served over orzo. followed recipe exactly which is rare for me... and really would not change it

This, really, is a tasty, easy recipe, that once you make it, becomes repertoire. The tarragon flavor can get lost, though, so I tossed freshly chopped tarragon into the steamed rice. Served with brandy-glazed roasted carrots & accented with steamed broccoli florets tucked around. Looked great, was delicious.

Rating: 4
This sauce is delicious. I used a touch less mustard based on previous reviews. I cooked 4 boneless chicken breasts but they were VERY dry upon serving (the sauce more than made up for it). My recommendation would be to cook boneless breasts for a less amount of time (but make sure you still thicken the sauce) or use bone-in. Again, the sauce was fantastic. We served it with broccoli and delmonico potatoes (next time I would do rice, as the potatoes and sauce are too rick for each other).

Rating: 4
Fabulous! When my partner asks if there is any more of the "glop" you know the sauce is outstanding! used the first tarragon from my garden. Used leeks instead of shallots because of allergies. I browned the breast of chicken per instructions but then cut into piece to cook in sauce. Served with rice -- stirred peas and stir fried red pepper into the rice for a side.

So good! I am a huge fan of mustard cream sauces and this one was spot-on. Simple to make, as well. It tastes pretty decadent for having only 9 ingredients. One substitution I made was sage (which I browned in butter) for tarragon because I am not a tarragon fan. Husband raved about this dish, and my 6-year-old also liked it. Will make again.

Loved this easy sauce. Grilled marinated chicken breasts first 5 min each side, then added them to the sauce using white wine (1/2 cup) instead of brandy. Finished up with another 5-10 min and added cream, dijon & tarragon- yummy

adding a little fresh thyme sprig as well as stuffing the chicken with something sweet such as a mandrin orange patte really helps with the tartness of the tarragon i also used white wine.

This is a really delicate, delicious dish. I used 1/2 cup of white wine instead of brandy and I only used a tsp. of mustard. I whisked in a tiny bit of flour at the end, too, just for thickness. When I make this again I'm going to grate some fresh Parmesan cheese into the sauce, too; I think it will help with the thickening and make the taste a little more complex. But yeah, this is a keeper.

"Chicken with Mustard and Tarragon Cream Sauce" is a simple, satisfying recipe that should please most palates. Still, it left me craving either more "omph" or an authentic, silky French cream sauce. The outcome of this recipe is a slightly chunky, very tangy sauce clinging to workaday chicken. It's flavorful, but unrefined. Next time I would opt to make a sauce straight from Julia Child--apparently one can't take shortcuts en route to a classic French dish.

This really is a great recipe and it's very simple to make. Like a lot of other people here I used boneless chicken breasts and substituted white wine for brandy, but it was delicious.

I have been doing a version of this recipe for years. I use boneless skinless (for time purposes only), sear on both sides, then reduce heat and cover until just cooked through. Remove to plate, add shallots to skillet, saute a minute or two, deglaze with 1/2 cup dry white wine and reduce a bit, whisk in 1 tsp dijon mustard, then 1/2 pint heavy cream. Bring to a light boil and continue to boil until reduced and slightly thickened. Add fresh tarragon to taste. Remove from heat and let sit a minute or two and the sauce will thicken more upon standing. Pretty much the same, just using pan juices from the chicken breast instead of the chicken stock and white wine instead of brandy.

I thought it was a nice, classic recipe, but I didn't love it. I added mushrooms (which added some more flavor) and served over rice. I also sliced the chicken diagonally and placed nicely over mounds of rice.

Great, tasty recipe! While the ingredients may seem heavy, the taste isn't heavy - the dish is filling though! Like many other cooks, I used boneless skinless breats and they turned out very moist. You chould even cube the chicken into bite size pieces. Definitely make somthing to soak up the sauce, such as rice or pasta, because the sauce is yummy and a bit thin for just the chicken. I made a parmasean risotto which was pefect.

I have made this recipe several times and loved it each time. I have always used boneless, skinless breast, but will try it with skin on next time to see if it is better.

I made this today for a family dinner party and all thought it was delicious. I used six split chicken breasts on the bone and doubled the sauce recipe. The only substitution that I made was to use apricot brandy in place of the plain (I've had a bottle hanging around for ages) I served the chicken and sauce with extra wide egg noodles and steamed carrots. I could eat this sauce with a spoon it's so good... I think it would be fabulous over scallops. Maybe next week!

Rating: 4
We've tried this with skinless breasts as well as breasts with the skin. Although both were good, the breasts with skin were superior. it seems that when one is "throwing caution to the wind" in regard to cream, brandy and butter, one might just as well enjoy breasts with skin! As suggested by others, we doubled the recipe for 6 breasts, and it worked perfectly. SO easy and SO delicious!

Rating: 4
Marvelous! I just made it with a single skin-on, bone-in chicken breast, tarragon and gray shallots from my garden, top milk from my fresh raw milk, homemade butter. I made a bit of rice, sliced the cooked chicken breast over the rice and poured sauce over all. Very easy to prepare, but complex taste and pretty on the plate. Definitely a keeper.

This is a very easy and tasty recipe. The only fault I find is the mustard. It overshadows the taste of the fresh tarragon. I halved the amount and even then I found that I should have added less...maybe 1/2 teaspoon. Other than that, it was great.

Rating: 4
This has become one of my family's favorites - adult children as well as husband! I use bone-in, skin on breasts, and follow the recipe exactly (chicken always turns out amazingly tender) except on boiling down the sauce - I find it needs boiling down a little longer in order to be thick enough. I also make a full recipe of sauce for just 2-3 chicken breasts (LOVE that sauce!)

This dish really is very tasty and it's easy. I finally have fresh tarragon in my garden, so I'm going to make it tonight. The only question is, noodles or rice. ;)

You can use de-boned chicken breast cut very thin (scalopini) but dust it with flour lst. Then take it out of the pan and cover it to keep it warm before you make the sauce. Put the chicken on top of egg noodles and pour the hot sauce on top. This is the version I was given in the 70's in New Orleans.

I make this about once a month - it's too full of fatty goodness to make more than that! I have done it with bone-in and boneless chicken, as dinner for two and for dinner party for 16 - easy, delicious. When I want it to look "wow" without a great deal of effort, this is what I make.

This is SO easy and SO delicious! I made it with dry tarragon and sour cream because I did not have the fresh tarragon or cream in the house. Also, used two large boneless chicken breasts and when covered only cooked it for an extra 10 minutes. Had tried it at 20 minutes and it was too dry. What a treat and what a "keeper". You must, however, love tarragon and we do! I would even serve this to company!

My wife loved this, so its a winner! It was just the 2 of us so I did one large chicken breast, cubed. I was out of Brandy so I used cheap scotch and it was good. During the steaming I added some 1 inch strips of red pepper for color and that worked out well. I used coffee cream (10% BF) instead of whipping (35%BF) just to be reasonable. I served with steamed fresh Washington Asparagus spears and mashed Yukon Gold. A nice easy Wednesday night dinner.

This recipe is amazing! I used 6 boneless/skinless breasts and doubled the sauce. I like a more pronounced mustard flavor, so I ended up tripling the mustard amount. I also saved half of the tarragon and added it after I had boiled it down to a sauce consistency-- gave a really fresh tarragon taste. I highly recommend this recipe for a weeknight meal or a fancy dinner!

I've often made chicken with dijon-cream sauce, but this dish was so much better than any I've created. I think the brandy and fresh tarragon really makes the difference.

Well, I still think this is THE most wonderful dish I've ever had. But, I do have a confession to make! When I made it the first time I only had dried tarragon, no shallots.....so used an onion and no cream so I used sour cream! I know some reviewers would state....."well make THE recipe" and tonight I am going to make THE origional recipe since I have everything on hand except I am using boneless chicken breasts. But, I'll tell you one thing.......even with all the substitutions it was absolutely wonderful!

This sauce was to die for! Some type of rice is a must to scoop up the sauce.

Really great sauce. I used cognac and more tarragon than the recipe called for...it was terrific. Even my fussy 16 year old daughter swooned. The timing on cooking is right on. Chicken (I used breasts) was perfectly done. The only very tiny suggestion is that the shallots are chopped fine enough...my were just a bit too "chunky". A keeper.

Used a bit more cream than called for. Used more mustard than called for (about 1/4 tsp. more). Finished sauce with a couple pats of butter. Threw chicken under brioler to crisp skin while finishing sauce. Served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. So, so good. Came out very juicy, despite the extra broiling. Will be a regular. Definitely company-worthy.

The sauce is rather nice on steamed cauliflower or "faux" mashed potatoes made with well-drained pureed cauliflower and butter.

I came back from wine tasting in Temecula with some exquisite bottles of Viognier. It complimented and balanced out the complex taste of tarragon, brandy, and mustard in this dish. Lovely. Serving it over plain white rice or orzo as another reviewer suggested is important, I think; don't set up a competition of flavors and let the sauce stand out. If you liked this dish, then go for the tuna in ginger shiitake cream sauce which receives such rave reviews on this site.

Sinfully rich and great change of pace from "grilled meat" (husband doing Atkins diet). This was a perfect low carb dinner for him, delicious treat for the rest.

This was excellent. Easy to make. The chicken came out tender. My kids who always asks what in thisss?, even loved it . The sauce is what makes it and if your watching calories you don't need much to enjoy the flavor. If your not watching the calories you'll want to double the sauce. If you don't have fresh tarragon you can subsitute with dried tarragon-2tsp.

I made this recipe for my family as something new and the general response was that it was either a 3/4 fork! The recipe was really tasty and there was not too much Taragon, which could have been very overpowering if there was too much! The tastes really all came through, but none of them were too much. Tastes blended together REALLY well. I shall deffinately be making this again. I have also tried it using a different mustard which was equally as nice: Try Tewkesbury Mustard which you can get in a Deli, probably! AH

It is relatively simple and the flavor is a good example of how lovely fresh tarragon can make something. I suggest to cook the chicken skin side down to take advantage of the caramel effect of the sauce.

I made this last night, and we loved it! I used brests and thighs and substituted amontillado for brandy (that's what was on hand), and it was delish! We steamed asparagus for a side veg, and my husband said little potatoes (white or red bliss) would have gone well, had we had them. I will definitely make this again! Santa Rosa, did you saute the shallots until they were glassy? If not, that might be where the "sharp" flavor came from.
