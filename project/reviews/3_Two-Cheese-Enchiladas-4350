I agree that this recipe is not authentic Mexican at all, it's more of a Tex mex dish. That being said, the ricotta is actually great in it, it goes well with the green sauce. It's a perfect and delicious simple recipe for those who can't cook more complicated authentic Mexican food (I'm not really a natural chef). I don't know why someone thought it was spicy--there are no ingredients in it that would make it spicy. It is totally 100% mild which is perfect for my kids. If I make it for adults I'll add 2-3 diced jalapenos to make it more interesting.

One measuring issue I just realized: the recipe says 3 1/2 cups monterey jack cheese is 14 oz. This is wrong, it's actually 28 oz according to google.

Great fast and easy recipe for enchiladas. Very mild flavoring for those who can't handle spicy. Tasted great with sour cream and guacamole.

These were wonderful. Very spicy, but I love that.

Be sure to fry the tortillas, up until the last time we never did to avoid the extra fat/calories, but boy did it make a difference. The tortillas held together much better and the meal was much more appetizing.

I've made this several times and think it is a very good vegetarian recipe. I use fat free ricotta with success.

Honestly, I don't know what other reviewers found so disagreable about this recipe. I know ricotta sounds weird, but it works just fine in what is basicly "enchiladas suizas". I added some cooked white meat chicken to the filling, other than that I followed the recipe to the "T". My kids loved it. My husband had seconds. This is definitely Mom cooking, not gourmet fare, but it's still good!

It wasn't "so-so" - it was inedible. Ricotta cheese in an enchilada?! This is probably the worst cheese enchilada recipe I have ever tried (and I did try it!) It needs more seasoning and NO ricotta.

This is no where close to authentic enchiladas.

I made this a 3 cheese version - Cheddar, Monteray Jack and Swiss.(We don't care for riccota)I did dip the tortilla in sauce before filling it. It was very good! Served it with Mexican rice and refried beans. Great vegetatian meal.

Monterey Jack and Ricotta? Bottled Green Sauce? ICK!!!! Try instead using queso fresco and oaxaca or queso quesadilla. You can get away with using Herdez' Salsa Verde, available in most markets, I add a little more garlic and onion to it. You HAVE to fry the tortilla first to soften it, then pass it through the sauce. If you don't fry first, the tortilla will fall apart when you soak it in the sauce.

My family loved this recipe! My kids did not want to try it due to the 1 and 2 fork ratings....I am glad that we made this! If this sounds good, try it! It is very light; the cilantro is EXCELLENT in it. Enjoy!

Who would even concider making this. it sounds bad. The enchiladas should be dipped in salsa after being fried and raccota cheese? yuck! try queso fresco instread. then it would be good

I'm not crazy about ricotta, so I can't honestly say I'd make this again; also, I tend to bypass the oil stage and dip my tortillas right into a sauce 'til softened. Then I put cheeses (cheddar, jack)and a bit of onion inside, roll them up and pour more of the sauce and cheese on top. I just am not crazy about my recipe and hoped you had a basic cheese enchilida recipe that offered something more exciting than the standard one I make...

We've tried several enchilada recipes in the past and this one was, by far, the least preferred. No one even wanted the leftovers the next day...I was asked to not make this one again!

I made this recipe for a party and my two vegetarian friends raved. Also, I couldn'f find green taco sauce so I just used regular taco sauce and it turned out fine.

Although I didn't particularly care for this, I gave this dish 2 Forks because my husband really liked it. BUT, in order to please the meat-eater, I topped this with taco-seasoned ground beef, which is worth considering.

Onions came out raw...should have sauteed first. Also, could work in a metal baking pan.

I used flour tortillas and we loved it. Was also so simple to prepare. Served refried black beans as a side dish along with a few pickled jalapenos.

HAD A DINNER PARTY LAST NIGHT AND SERVED THESE. EVERYONE LOVED THEM. EASY AND CAN DO AHEAD, WHICH MADE THE EVENING MUCH MORE RELAXING FOR ME.

This recipe is also good with flour (fajita size)tortillas. It's much lower in fat, and less time to make!
