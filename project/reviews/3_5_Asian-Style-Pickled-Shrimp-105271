I have made this recipe dozens of times. I always get rave revues. and always have copies of the recipe because I always get asked for it. I wouldnt be afraid. I make the brine and put my Shrimp in a half gallon canning Jar bring the brine to a rolling boil then I add the brine to the Jar and I stir a couple of times to make sure all the shrimp turn pink then I put in the cilantro green onion and the picked ginger in brine , refridgerate .I usually make it the night before my event and its always perfect . Absolutly love this recipe .

So sorry folks, but this recipe sucks. :-) The combination of pickling spice, lemongrass, and pickled ginger should have set off huge alarm bells in my culinary subconsciousness! The *taste* was great; the flavor, well, to paraphrase what Mozart (Tom Hulce) said to Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) in "Amadeus", after hearing Salieri's latest musical creation: "I didn't know that such flavor was possible!" :-)

I thought this was wonderful - guests scarfed them down. I followed another reviewer's advice and boiled my ingredients for several minutes. Then Iadded the shrimp and scooped them out almost immediately - less than 2 minutes. After the broth cooled I added the shrimp back, put all in a ziplock bag to marinate and served it the next day.

I haven't even tried this yet but I think I shall just because of all these hilarious reviews...for those not clear on the recipe...you remove the PAN from the heat, not the shrimp from the pan.

I am SO glad I made this! It was so simple! -- To those of you who thought the directions were confusing, fear not, it is a PICKLE, so the shrimp SHOULD stay in (boil first 6 & shrimp, add rest, let cool)...the idea is that the last ingredients just shouldnt be boiling, they will lose flavor...just follow right along, it works, and well. Mmm. Mmm. A breeze to make and a delight to eat! Try it tonight!

I made this dish and everyone wanted the recipe. I think many are reading the recipe wrong (it is ambiguous). I read it as taking the shrimp out when done, mixing in the other ingredients and letting the whole thing cool for 1 hour before putting the shrimp back in to pickle.

I, too, worried about the technique, but followed it exactly and the dish was a big hit with my guests. Isn't that why we amatuer cooks try new recipes to learn new techniques? Anyway, I think it's a great use for the large jar of picked ginger in your frig and a good party recipe.

I was looking for something to bring to an Asian-themed pot luck...and this seemed perfect. I read everyone's comments and took many into consideration. My comment to the cocky cook from PA is: why trash someone's ability??? If anything, why are we not critizing the source of the recipe. Where was Bon Appetite's expertise on this cooking method???

It is delicious and easy. My guests (have made it four times since I got the magazine in July) can't stuff it in their mouths fast enough. I shortcut by using frozen tail-on shrimp and just put them in when the brine is boiling. Yummmmmm.

Tried this recipe out of curiousity. I was captured by the comments - positive and otherwise. Now that we know that the recipe isn't all that precise, we can enhance it for future purposes. May I suggest that the water be cut in half and I would add some ginger at this point. Add the shrimps only when the liquid is boiling hot. Salt the shrimps before cooking. Remove the shrimps once they turn pink/curl (they will continue cooking). Stir in your cold ginger brine to the cooked shrimps and cool further. Hope the suggestions work out for you as well as it did for me. Bon Appetit.

With all of the comments about the comments aside, can anyone tell me if this is a truly worthwhile recipe, even after incorporating the changes noted?

A great BIG thank you to all that came to my defense. I'm actually not exactly an inexperienced cook, and had some reservations before I started this recipe, but must have fallen into the trap of trusting the printed word. I appreciate that noone else appreciated the comments from thc cook from PA - what an *#@%!@!#

Wow, this has been the funniest exchange to read through! I agree with everyone else, NOT COOL, Cook from PA. Anyway, I've actually made the recipe and my 2 cents is to remove the shrimp from the poaching liquid as soon as they're cooked through. Cool the liquid completely, then add back the shrimp and the other ingredients so the shrimp can soak in the flavors ( I peel the shrimp, but that's up to you). I also add a couple of sliced jalepeños to the liquid for some extra kick. I hope this helps, and thanks for the entertaining rapport! :-) MCW

I haven't prepared this recipie yet because I was overcome with disapppointment in the people who wrote the reviews! I would think the visitors to this site have a love of cooking. I for one would go out of my way to encourage eager but less experienced cooks. Cooking is a joy for most of us and to have an ongoing dispute about a recipie is immature and imposes a shadow on the efforts and pleasure of others using Epicurious. I for one love hearing critiques in a positive and encouraging manner.

To cook from PA: Cook from Coronado did what we all expect: tried the recipe as written and then commented on it. No reason to be pompous.

Regarding the question of the shrimp soaking up enough flavor before they're removed from the broth: I'm going to try combining the first 6 ingredients in a saucepan and simmering them, covered, for 10 minutes before adding the shrimp. I also suspect that the shrimp would have a better texture if they were poached by adding them to the simmering broth, covering, and immediately turning off the heat and letting them stand a few minutes until cooked through. I think they'd be more tender with this method than if they were "boiled," or even "simmered."

So you're so smart PA. Get real! Coronado might just be a novice cook. Drop the sarcasm and then your advice might be appreciated.

I ahve not made this recipe and have a question for those who have. It seems that the shrimp would be way over cooked if left to sit in the hot broth for so long, as per the recipe. Yet, if you don't leave them in the broth, will the pickling spices and other flavorings have time do work their magic? Please advise. Thanks!!

This appetizer recipe was very easy to make and the friends I cooked it for loved it. I'm lucky enough to have a clump of lemon grass growing in my yard. I'll definitely make it again.

To the cook from Coronado: Any cook worth his/her salt would know NOT to LEAVE the shrimp in the hot broth after it finishes cooking (regardless of what the recipe says!) Use common sense & a little bit of creativity. Cooking is an art,not an exact science. If something doesn't make sense, question it or just change it! No one will throw you jail for it! LM in PA

Excellent presentation, leaving the shells on definately aids in the juciness of the shrimp. Make sure you make the optional dipping sauce; it was very popular. The cocktail sauce was completely avoided. Be care to not over-cook!!!
