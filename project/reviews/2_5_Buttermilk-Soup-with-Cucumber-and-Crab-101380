I made this without the crab as an appealing way to use up cucumbers from the garden. The buttermilk and yogurt base was great, and the soup was a lovely green color. However, I didn't like the raw green onions at the end. I used sliced yellow cherry tomatoes and I don't think the crunch of the tomato skin worked with the smoothness of the soup. The fundamentals were so good, I would be willing to revisit this recipe to put together a better vegetarian version.

Refreshing, yes. Tangy, yes. I found the lump of unseasoned crab at the bottom of the bowl a bit bland. But this soup was easy and light--I think I'll use it as inspiration for other buttermilk-based soups.

This is a good chilled soup, and plenty satisfying for us, especially during the week when we are trying to eat light. Grilled shrimp bruschetta was a perfect side dish.

It just isn't satisfying as a soup. I prefer cucumber salad in sour cream to this.

Nice summer soup.

Since I recently have started getting serious about cooking, this was easy to make and inspiring to try other things. I added a little extra crab. We found it to be a satisfying side dish to dinner. I can't wait to make it again now that summer is here.

Thumbs down. Soup was thin and watery. I found myself adding more and more crabmeat, tomato and onions just so I could get through one small bowl. I wouldn't make it again.
