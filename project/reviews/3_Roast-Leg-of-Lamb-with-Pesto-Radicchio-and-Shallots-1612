I've made this recipe many times since it was first published. The house smells so wonderful while the meat is roasting and the finished product is excellent. Everything in the bottom of the roasting pan is delicious. I've also made it with baby or fingerling potatoes thrown in. Can't go wrong!

Excellent and simple; allow the lamb to sit with the pesto overnight for really tender meat. I used a boneless leg as well--just make sure to adjust the cooking time downward (about an hour at 350 should be fine)

Made this back in 1991 for Easter -- our family never ate lamb but ham for the holiday. But as my mom and dad were traveling out of the country, I thought it would be fun to try something out for the rest of the family. This turned out to be our favorite dish (and one everyone looks forward to even though I'm now living in HK and they're in NJ) -- and it gets better if you also add about 3 slivered cloves of garlic into slits along with the pesto!
