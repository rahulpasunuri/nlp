This recipe is easy to make and really tasteful ! I used a steamer which makes it even more simple to prepare ! My friends and I were surprised of how good it was even if I used simple black mushroom which are less tasty than shiitake and couldn't find any baby bock choï ( not available in common supermarket in France ) ! Definitely a meal I will prepare again !

This was fun to make, the sauce is created when you steam the chicken, which I thought was very cool. However, the dish was quite bland and uninspiring, despite tripling the ginger. However, it is quite healthy.

I loved the way the steaming process creates the sauce all on its own. I doubled the ginger, but still have to say this dish is pretty bland and uninspired, though certainly very healthy and fun to make.

This was great. I made it for some friends and we were surprised how good it was--chicken is very moist and broth is flavorful. It makes a lot of broth, so have rice to go with it. Some changes: Used boneless thighs, fresh mushrooms instead of dried, and rice vinegar because I didn't have rice wine. Also, the bok choy cooks down to nothing once you add the chicken and broth. So cook the greens less in the beginning and use more of them. For steaming, I put a metal vegetable steamer (took out the pin) in pasta cooker and put a Pyrex bowl on it then covered everything with a lid. Worked great.

This dish is wonderful! It is fast and easy to make, and has a wide appeal. The recipe can also be easily converted for a food steamer, which makes cleanup much easier.

This is an easy and tasty recipe that I've been making for a couple years. One thing I learned tonight: definitely marinate for the full 30 minutes! I tried to cut corners and only did half the time and the flavor was totally bland. I'll still make it again though!

This recipe gets 4 forks for its simplicity and ease. I thought it was a great recipe overall but would maybe marinate the chicken in some oystersauce and ginger to intensify the flavours a bit.

I found this to be exceptional. Not too much work to prepare and the chicken was so moist! Used a double tray bamboo steamer and chicken breasts.

I made this recipe without the bak choy, which I braised separately. An alternate method of "steaming" is to place the marinating chicken in saucepan with mushrooms + soaking liquid (use only 1 cup water when rehydrating mushrooms and don't throw this out: it's very flavourful!) and simmer the whole thing, covered, for 25 minutes. Also, reduce the cornstarch to 1 tbsp. Wonderful recipe, and incidentally - the movie comes highly recommended too!

We have made this several times and love it with just a little revision. Use twice the amount of scallions and ginger to boost the flavor. It is delicious and healthy.

I hate to be the spoiler but this was a very dull meal. I am a stir fry nut and this sounded like an exciting variation to basic stir fry ingredients. My advise: chop the bok choy, add some garlic paste and stir fry the whole lot!

"Eat, Drink, Man, Woman" is about as sexy as food gets. I found myself salivating and wishing for a personal chef while watching it. I tried this recipe based on its association to the movie and because I'm always looking to try something new with my frequent grazings of steamed rice. This was delicious. Just what I expected. I had the butcher debone and skin the thighs and then cut accordingly. I think you'll find that once you switch to dark meat, you won't go back : }` It's just juicier and tastier.

This turned out to be easy, and a real crowd pleaser. I used boneless thighs, and added some baby corn in the last few minutes. At first I thought it was going to be a gelatinous mess, but as it steamed, it created a wonderful sauce. Will definitely make it again.

Be careful not to add too much cornstarch. Cut the original by about 1/2-1/4 Tbsp. Then be sure to really incorporate it into the mixture. Otherwise, it may devlop ino a gelantenous goo.

Delicious, easy, and even my super-picky daughter loved this dish and asked me to make it again. Since I had sugar snap peas I needed to use, I made it with those instead of the baby bok choy. It worked perfectly well but next time I'll probably use the bok choy.

This was a wonderful component of a Chinese-inspired meal, full of flavor and texture. Having all the ingredients already on hand, except for the bok choy, I made do with (believe it or not) a head of Romaine lettuce, which I sliced crosswise, and then lightly sauteed with slivered garlic. Very successful.
