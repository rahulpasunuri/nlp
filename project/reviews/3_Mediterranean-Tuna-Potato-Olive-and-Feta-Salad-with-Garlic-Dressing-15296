If you are a low carber like me. Leave out the potatoes. Boil the garlic and proceed from there!Soooo very tasty.

I thought this was tasty and pretty to look at with all of its contrasting colors, but I think it was more work than it was worth. It went over ok with my guests but didn't disappear as quickly as some of the other foods I served.

LOVED IT!!! I"m not a big pepper or cucumber fan, so I substituted tomatoes and zucchini to keep the color and texture. I also used more feta, since I love it. Great lunch salad, very filling. I will definitely make this again.

It's robust, that's for sure! Colorful, chunky, but not quite worth the effort.

This recipe had a lot of great ingredients in it but for some reason they just didn't all come together for me. I thought that the tuna and feta were overpowered by the Dijon mustard and that, overall, the flavours didn't blend very well. After reading the other reviews, I was looking forward to it being delicious. We had some which was left over so I served it the next day and even though it was a little watered down, we found that it tasted better after sitting.

VERY Tasty! and I didn't think I would enjoy this (I made it becaue I knew my husband would) but I really did!! I'm not that big of a vegetable fan, I'm always trying different ways to incorporate more vegies into my diet - this recipe is great! As I was making this recipe I realized I only had less than one tablespoon of balsamic vinegar, I substituted red wine vinegar and it was still very tasty.

A very good recipe for a light summer meal...a delicious mixture of flavors and very different from the usual. With fresh grilled tuna, I'd probably give it 4 forks.

This was the best salad I've had in a long time. I boiled the potatoes with garlic, then used roasted garlic in the dressing, and substituted ricotta salata for the feta cheese. My mother who dislikes vegetables, ate this.

Great and easy summer salad. To make it extra special, we marinated and grilled fresh tuna, then broke it up in the salad. Also, boiling the garlic for 20 mins. takes away most of the flavor -- take it out after 10. Also, marinated the cucumber in a little rice vinegar to perk it up more. All in all, YUM! We've had it twice this month!
