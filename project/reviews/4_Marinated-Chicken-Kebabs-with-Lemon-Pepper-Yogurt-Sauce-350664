Chicken marinated in lemon can turn out dry and grainy, but this was fantastic. I made half the marinade and it was more than enough. With respect to the sauce, it had a bit of a chalky texture at first. This dissipated some overnight, and the mint was absolutely key. Served these chicken kebabs and the lamb kebabs with pomegranate-cumin glaze; both were superb with the sauce. Would do it all again.

Instead of skewering the chicken, I just cubed it and cooked it in olive oil on the stove. I don't know if I did something wrong, but my recipe turned out WAY too lemony. And I only used two lemons. I didn't have time to make the sauce, so maybe that would have cut down on the lemon flavor. But, it was still good, once you get past all the lemon taste. I will make it again, using less lemon and more garlic.

WOW! These were fantastic.... partly because the chicken was so good (Fresh Market), but the flavors were great and marinating the chicken overnight meant super moist chicken. The sauce was good too... wishing I had save the marinade for a second batch.

We made this for vegetarians and put onions, cherry tomatoes, eggplant, and tofu. Delicious! Marinade is also really good with pork kebabs. The yogurt sauce tasted a bit too tart on it's own, but with the marinated veggies it was a nice compliment.

I'm not a big fan of this recipe. I didn't like the sauce. I thought it was too sour. I marinated the chicken breasts overnight; however, the chicken was dry.

Muy sabroso!!! El aroma del limón (auqnue usé lima) es genial y el pollo queda super blando luego de tenerlo marinando en la heladera. El romero y las otras especias le dan un sabor muy rico. Eso sí: la próxima vez voy a usar menos aceite: queda muuuuuy aceitoso todo!!! Tuve que secar el pollo con appel absorvente antes de colocarlo en el palito del kebab. Y la salsa es muy sabrosa por sí sola. Subtituí algo del ajo fresco, por ajo en polvo, que es más suave.

Made this for a deck party and grilled the skewered chicken. BIG hit! Loved the sauce, but will use non-fat Greek yogurt next time after reading the calorie numbers on the carton. The chicken was so tender and flavorful and even better the next day when I ate the last remaining skewer-ful for lunch!

BLECH! I'm basing my review strictly on the sauce. I have the chicken marinating at the moment and will cook it later. I certainly hope it's better than the sauce, which was ghastly. It was waaaaay too salty - and I'm someone who loves salt - and I think the vinegar was completely unnecessary. I tried to salvage it by adding extra lemon juice and then a little sugar in the hopes of cutting down the horrible saltiness, but even that didn't work. I ended up tossing it. I can't think of another recipe I've made from Epicurious that was so well-reviewed by other people and turned out so terrible. Strange.

Wow this was so excellent all eleven guests at the table, young and old alike just raved over this and especially the sauce. I used Greek yogurt as well and next time will use less salt although none of the other guests thought it was too salty (surprisingly the mint makes it, and my mom doesn't like mint but raved over this). Makes a ton of sauce but some took a little home and I'll use on other meats like other reviewers suggested. This recipe is a keeper in this house for sure...I love Epicurious!!

I also cut out the sour cream and used non-fat greek yogurt and less olive oil. It was still delicious. I thought the lemon was prominent without overpowering. This would be lovely with other meats too.

Wonderful citrussy flavor in both the chicken and the sauce. A real winner hot off the grill and even delicious warmed up the next day! A real keeper.

Truly excellent recipe. Added large tomato and onion hunks to skewers and marinated overnight. The sauce was wonderful and really versatile. Made a very few alterations: non-fat Greek yogurt, slightly less garlic (1 clove) and less pepper (1 tsp). The sauce is so versatile - I used it on salad, dipping vegetables, crab and salmon cakes.

This was a great recipe for entertaining - I marinated the chicken overnight. It was very tender and flavorful.

This recipe is seriously good. The acidity of the lemon juice breaks down the chicken, making it extremely tender and easy to skewer. All of the flavors of the marinade come together simply and beautifully. I had these on medium heat on the grill for about 15 minutes. The sauce, oh the sauce!! It was incredible on the chicken. The flavors blended perfectly with the chicken and the zing of the lemon zest tangoed with the smooth coolness of the yogurt and sour cream on my palate. YUM YUM YUMMMMM!

The sauce is so good, but I only needed a half recipe of the sauce. Very tasty main course.

Only reviewing the sauce, which I used for Tandoori-spiced chicken from this site. It's a decent yogurt dip for what we made which was quite spicy. My biggest qualm is that I think it makes too much sauce; I even cut it in half and it was too much...what are you folks doing, making a soup?

The sauce was a smash, even my husband who isn't a fan of sauces liked it. The marinade was very good and we'll make this again.

This was very good. Just made this with roasted vegtables and it was a big hit. Very easy, healthy and good. did not serve it to the kids, but might try that next time. My husband really enjoyed it and will want me to make it again.

I am a huge fan of lemon. So this was great! I used nonfat yogurt so it was also guilt-free!

This is an excellent and simple recipe. The marinade is great for chicken even if you're not making kebebs. I use FAGE 0% fat greek yoghurt and skip the sour cream it's so rich in flavor!

This was great! Simple, tasty chicken and a really unique, satisfying sauce. Don't be afraid to be liberal with the lemon, pepper, and mint. I am trying to figure out other things to do with the sauce, it is so good. I tried to make a chicken salad with it, but it was a little much, drenching everything in it.

@mingum, I think the idea was you broil the chicken cubes, then skewer them for presentation. Saves you having to actually fire up the grill eh?

My husband and I liked this recipe very much. I served it with white rice which was a nice simple compliment with the yogurt sauce on it. One word of caution, if you make the sauce two hours in advance, the garlic flavor will be very strong, this is ok with the meal but, it stayed with me a long time! Good thing my hubby had plenty too!

Very flavorful and moist. I too added some cayenne pepper to this recipe for added kick. I also had to substitute the mint for cilantro, because I didn't have any. As a side I made sauteed slivered garlic in olive oil with broccoli rabe and baked potato. The contrast in flavors between the sweetness of the chicken and the bitterness of the broccoli rabe made it a perfect pairing.

To answer the previous question, I served it room temperature and it was delicious. Then I ate the leftovers the next day straight from the fridge, still delicious.

This recipe is written a little bit weirdly, it says to cut up the chicken, then marinate, then grill, then put on the skewers to serve? Odd. Well we don't grill in winter so I put the whole pan in the broiler. I should have drained more of the oil, it made a bit of a mess but still came out delicious. Just stirred it up a few times while under the broiler. Served it with the dip, to which I added a bunch of zest from one of the lemons so it was lemonier. Very tasty.

I just want to know if anyone has taken this recipe to an outdoor event-therefore the chicken will not be too warm. Would it still be good??? FlSandra

SO good. I made these for our New Years Eve Party and received compliments all evening! Will definitely make this recipe again and again.
