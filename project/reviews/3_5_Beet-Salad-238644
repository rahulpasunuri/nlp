Exactly what I expect from a beet salad. I used a giant golden beet, toasted the walnuts, and olive oil (like many reviewers). I also added a little bit of red onion. If I had arugula, I would have served over a little of that. Very good.

This salad got good reviews at my table. I went lazy route and boiled instead of roasted. I aslo added salt and used olive oil (thanks zuni53)...added some red pepper flakes to give it a little kick. I thought it was decent (which is big praise from a beets hater), but my husband really liked it.

My husband and I love a good beet salad, but this dish was, if truth be told, rather boring and uninspired. Tossing in a bit of chopped fresh mint will definitely perk up the leftovers.

The key to this recipe is using quality balsamic and goat cheese. Double the balsamic, and use olive oil with a bit of salt. No cheating! Success is in the ingredients.

This was messy and work-intensive for not much extra flavor than one might expect from beets out of a can. Toss some beets with vinegar and feta and...you have a simple salad that is fine, but not spectacular in any way.

Delicious salad. I didn't use the sunflower oil, but other than that I followed the recipe. Great!

Hubby and I really like beets so I'm sure that helped the rating. I found yellow beets at Whole Foods; they are a bit mellower and less bitter than the red ones but I have made this with just red beets too. I use olive oil and have served this over arugula greens with some extra balsamic vinegar/oil for dressing. Wonderful for company, if they like beets, as the beets can be cooked the night before and this tastes good cold as well as warm.

My family loved this salad. I have used pecans in place of the walnuts and a little white vinegar to meke it less sweet. I didn't have goat cheese, so I use a plain white fresh cheese we have in our country: Colombia. María

My husband and I love this salad. We've served it to friends and have gotten rave reviews. I have used pecans in place of the walnuts, have also served it on spinach, and have tried it with blue cheese, too. Delicious every time!

Entirely unspectacular - though certainly edible and easy. But rave worthy it's not - kinda boring, except for the forkfuls that had some feta on them. I also used olive oil, and I can't imagine how bland it would have been without. I'll make it again, but with the addition of fresh herbs.

This salad was delicious. I did use sunflower oil, but I think it would have been fine with olive oil.

I am making this tonight for the third time in as many weeks. It is easy and delicious. I can never again eat a canned beet! The only drawback is that I haven't been able to find golden beets but that hasn't stopped me from enjoying this as a cool lunch and/or dinner side dish.

So simple & so tastey. I made it as written without alterations.
