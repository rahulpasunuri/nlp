I wanted a complex, nutty foil to the candied citrus terrine I was serving, and these macaroons were perfect. To up the nuttiness, I toasted the sesame seeds as darkly as I dared and omitted the sugar. Outrageous!

This got a rave review from my family, will definately make again. I used greased muffin tins to keep the cookies from spreading too much. Delicious and easy to make (once I got past getting the almond paste soft enough to work with).
