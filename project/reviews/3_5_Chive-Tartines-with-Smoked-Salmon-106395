I have made this several times and it always flies off the platter. I do have mixed feelings though - for connoisseurs, the extras like the chive oil and shallots in the cheese make the dish, but when I serve it to my relatives - they love anything with smoked salmon and I don't think they appreciate the extra effort.

Fabulous was everyone comments. They flew off the platter. Very easy to do ahead of time. Great chive oil. Can't wait to try it with other recipes.

These tasted great - the chive oil was wonderful. They looked beautiful.

This was superb, use enough good olive oil to get the volume you need. I also used fresh, whole, shallots. They look like little leeks, full greens, and really made the chevre stand out.

It was good, but there is definitely better out there. Cheese tended to get a bit crusty because it doesn't really melt. Also, be forewarned that all that oil and chives only results in a few tablespoons of chive oil - defintely enough, but it looks deceiving.

Very easy and great.

Just delicious. An appetizer for a special evening. Use one 3.5 oz log of goat cheese and buy two packs of herbs for the chive oil. Yes, chive oil does make a difference. I had to bake for almost 10 minutes to get them to brown. A sophisticated dish!

I used the food processor without cleaning it to mince the shallots finer, then pulsed in the goat cheese. This made the cheese mixture a bit easier to spread onto the bread and infused a bit more of the chive flavor. It is quick and easy making it great for a party!

This was a big hit at a cocktail party. I used herbed goat cheese and cooked the bread/chive oil for a bit longer -- closer to 10 minutes. The blend of flavors is quite delicious.

Very easy and a big hit. Because I was bring it to a party, I didn't melt the cheese but spread it on afer I toasted the bread and brushed it with the chive oil. Top with the salmon and voila!
