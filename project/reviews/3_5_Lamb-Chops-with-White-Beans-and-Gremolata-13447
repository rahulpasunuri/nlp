Excellant - used strained stewed tomatoes and chick peas. Very tender and flavorful and would look forward to making for a dinner group

Made a few adjustments -- used lamb chops, coated in herbs de Provonce, salt and pepper before browning, used a little pickled lemon I had with the beans and a can of chopped tomatoes, I agree, this doesn't really need fresh tomatoes (especially in Minnesota in December). I also added a can of chicken broth to the beans. We like lamb fully done so I popped the casserole in the oven for while. Served with sugar pea pods -- a treat!

Instead of canned beans, so yourself & those delicious rib chops a favor & prepare your own. The recipe is too basic to not notice they're from a tin. I also recommend adding a shallot, & using stewed tomato (the flavor of the fresh romas gets a little lost, otherwise).

Made this last week for dinner - YUMMMM. It was so easy and so tasty, will definitely make this again. My 4-yr-old loved it...

This is ambrosia! Do not skip any steps and make sure to make the gremolata. This is delectable!

I simply made this with lamb stewing meat cut in large chunks and added some sage. I made a large portion of gremolata which I sprinkled over the stew. Good food.

I've made this recipe many times and, like others, searched for it on this site after losing the copy I ripped out of the magazine. I don't bother with the frenching and usually cook the beans/tomatoes a bit longer.

I agree with the cookfrom Los Angeles,Calif.......a waste of good lamb

I would make this again and again. I used a rack of lamb and cut ribs and also sauted the beans and tomatoes 10 minutes to cook down. Best part was the next day eating the beans cold.Wow what a great taste.

I, too, lost this recipe and hunted it down. I've served it to guests with great success. Delicious; easy finish in the oven; pretty presentation; nice combination of flavors. A real treat for lamb lovers.

Many reviewers used pork or fish and gave the recipe a rave review. The beans were ok, but it is a true waste of a delicious cut of lamb to prepare it in this manner. While there is really no labor involved, this was an overall disappointment - only soso

I found this recipe online after I lost the one I tore out of the magazine in 1997 - and believe me, this is a recipe you'd search for days for.... Make it - you won't be sorry!

I made this dish with loin pork chops instead and the result was fabulous! Will definitely make it again and am looking forward to trying it with lamb chops as well.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone raved about it, said they felt like they were dining in a fancy restuarant. with a side of steamed spinich with a splash of fresh lemon and peach pie for dessert we were happy! happy!

I have made this recipe several times; often substituting butterflied pork loin chop, center cut for the lamb. Have also put it all on a bed of fresh cooked spinach! Guests rave about this dish! When asked what I'm cooking for dinner, I say "pork and beans"!

My husband and I found this recipe to be quite tasty. We almost always grill our lamb so it was quite a change for us. It was fairly easy to prepare. I did not bother with the special cutting and I used Cannellini for the beans.
