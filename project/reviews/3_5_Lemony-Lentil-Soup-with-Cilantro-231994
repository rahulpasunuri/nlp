I enjoyed this soup! It came out pretty tasty. I have never cooked with lentils before, but I'm always looking to try new things. I used 4 cups of chicken broth, and only 2 cups of water. I do think it needs some hot sauce. I added a little greek yogurt to my bowl. I would make this again and use veggie broth, so it would be vegan, and add more spices. I really like the cilantro and the lemon. I also tried to cut down the oil a little, maybe 1 tablespoon.

Tasty, just not distinctive. Came out a bit watery for me.

should also mention - this tasted much better a few days later! The allspice really mellows in to the lemon. Num num.

I made this recipe in an attempt to burn through some extra cilantro. I changed it a little, so I'm not going to rate it. I doubled everythind except for the liquid, and that turnd out well. I used entirely broth for the liquid, as others have suggested, and was happy with the result. I added a little more allspice than I should have - careful with that. I used the juice of one large lemon, which was perfect. I added about 4 stalks of celery and three carrots to bulk it up. The cilantro pesto was good, but don't try and get artsy (like I did) and add toasted nuts and things. In pesto form, cilantro is definitely not as accomodating as basil! This was a good base recipe to play with. The allspice and the lemon were a great combination. Good soup.

Delicious! I cut a bit on the oil and it is still very good.

Made the recipe as directed. Was expecting more of a lemony flavor to give it a different dimension. Really didn't notice the lemon. Next time, I'd do 2 things differently: 1) add more lemon at the end, but not so much to make it tart. 2) Make some cilantro oil to drizzle over the top.

Just made this tonight and it was wonderful. I followed the others suggestions and only used chicken stock. The allspice was just amazing in this dish. and the cilantro adds a freshness to the palette. My 3 boys ate it without a single word. The lemon juice is a definite must. a keeper!

The soup was good but not great. I added the amount of water suggested by previous comments, I would also recommend adding more lemon juice.

I was pleasantly surprised at how good this soup turned out. I am a big fan of making homemade soups and this will definitely be on the top of my list. I think what is key to this recipe is having good quality ingredients, especially the chicken broth. The allspice might seem strange, but it really enhances an already good broth. Be careful with the salt in cilantro puree, I over did it a little so I had to be careful not to over salt the soup. I will definitely be making this again!

Made this recipe for dinner tonight and it was a big hit. The lemon and cilantro really make this dish. Used 2 cups of lentils to make it thicker with a bit less water/broth, upped the amount of cilantro to 1 cup. A definite keeper!

This soup was delicious - earned rave reviews from foodie friend and her meat-loving husband. I expect it would be great as written but I like others before me made some changes. Increased lentils to 2 scant cups. Used a few chopped baby carrots since I had 'em and the color contrasts nicely with the lentils. Added a pinch of cumin and chili powder (chipotle-based) and also roasted a poblano pepper and added that to the soup. Also used all chicken stock, no water. Served with cilantro puree (more than 1/2 cup will be needed) and meyer lemon juice and some slices of grilled baguette. Outstanding, and leftovers were even better. Think I'll make it again this week, and double recipe for freezing!

I've made this twice in a two week period. Will make it often. It's easy and delicious. I reduced the liquid once and increased the lentils the other time. Both worked, but the extra lentils gave the dish a heartiness we all appreciated. Added lots more cilantro than the recipe called for--it makes the dish. Had no allspice so used cayenne pepper instead. I highly recommend the pepper.

Wow, this was really delicious! One of my best soup efforts yet, and an excellent vegetarian soup if you use vegetable broth. I don't think carrots and potatoes are necessary, the soup stands on its own, though I added extra lemon juice, doubled the cilantro oil (the more the better w/ this soup), and made garlic croutons (strips of hearty bread rubbed w/ garlic, drizzled w/ olive oil, and then broiled or toasted).

This was delicious! As noted below, you can just double everything except for the amount of liquid. Also as people have said, when making the cilantro oil mixture, treat it like any other pesto and add oil gradually til it looks like enough...start with a tablespoon and go from there. The cilantro oil and lemon make this soup rich and delectable! I also added carrots, potato, and macaroni.

I made this soup following the recipe to the letter and it was too strong, too salty and too greasy. Made it again using half the onions, half the oil, and half the salt and it was fantastic.

i only gave it a 3 because i think the chicken broth/water amounts are 2 high. i used 2 cups of each and it came out great!

Forgot to add that having an immersion blender simplifies this even more!

Terrific soup! I usually hate cilantro, but the puree totally makes this dish. I do add an extra tablespoon or more of lemon juice to bring out the flavors more, but that's personal preference.

This is a delightful and different flavor combination. Like all soups, it's very enhanced by the next day. We loved it. Like some other reviewers, I used French green lentils, which feel a bit more elegant than brown. Obviously this is a light, broth based soup. -Just noticing some disappointed reviews regarding texture. If you prefer a heartier version either add more lentils or reduce liquid. Would also be tasty with chicken. But it's great as directed. Absolutely make the cilantro puree, it's not the same dish without it.

I'm raising my rating because it was so good the next day that I ate the whole pot myself.

This soup is delicious. I did, however, make a few modifications to the recipe. I used a whole package of Steamed Lentils from TJ's (in the cold produce section) and I added carrots and potatoes. Even though the lentils were already cooked, I let it simmer for about 30 minutes to cook the carrots and potatoes until they were soft. I added a splash of chicken broth (from TJ's - I swear I don't work there) to the cilantro and oil puree because there wasn't enough liquid to get it whirling in the blender. I used 32 oz's of chicken broth and two cups of water which was the perfect amount of liquid. I was able to use less liquid because the lentils were already cooked - I think.

I have made this several times and it is a great soup, very hearty and delicious.

This was a basically good soup recipe and very easy. I echo what one of the other reviewers said about the importance of the Cilantro oil, but would caution to use a mild flavored olive oil (or perhaps even grapeseed oil) so the flavor of the cilantro comes out. And don't omit the lemon -- that's also critical to the end product. I also found that the flavor of the soup greatly improved after 24 hours, so give it a day for the flavors to meld for the best results.

I used french green lentils and vegetable broth, and an immersion blender to puree the soup. I found the cilantro-oil puree to be worth the effort, and stirred it into the soup before serving.

A really outstanding soup -- using more lentils and less water than the recipe suggests.

A good soup, but VERY simple. Could do well with some carrot.celery.spinach etc. additions. I used red lentils which made it a much thinner and less textured soup, but it was still nice, and the lemon and cilantro are excellent accents. However, this is not a hearty, meal in a bowl kind of soup.

It was great soup, we added pumpkin spice to it and used vegetable broth instead of chicken. Very good vegetarian soup.

This soup was far too thin to be substantial enough for a meal, and the cilantro-oil puree was a lurid green that just pooled at the top of each serving. In the end, I added some chopped ham to try and make a meal of it, but it just wasn't very good.

My new favorite soup. Super quick and easy. I've made it twice already--even though it's 86 degrees outside, the soup is very light and appropriate for spring. I used chicken boullion instead of broth and it's still very good. Tip: Use a hand-held blender instead of a regular one--the volume of the cilantro mixture was not enough to be properly blended by the blades.
