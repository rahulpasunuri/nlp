The sauce is ok, but for the amount of time and cost involved I would have expected something to knock my socks off, which this didn't.

Delish--the sauce makes the dish. I does take a long time for an entire bottle of red wine plus stock and port to reduce, but it didn't really require a ton of watching. I found veal stock and Williams Sonoma.

Absolutely marvelous, and quite easy. I used one cup of veal demi-glace instead of two cups of stock to cut down on the time to reduce, but otherwise did this just as written. Served with simple roast potatos and grilled asparagus. Definitely a dish to make when you really want to impress your guests.

You can make veal stock at home by browning 5 lbs veal bones for 10min over high heat, removing then adding celery leeks carrots and onions bay leaf, peppercorn and 2 allspice berries on med heat to caramelize, then add 2 tbs. tomato paste and 4 quarts or so of water, simmering down for 2 hours until reduced by half. It is almost essential to really making this dish stand out.

We made this with tenderloin and it was spectacular. The sauce takes a looong time to cook down though, so although it's easy, it does take time. I made the veal stock myself by buying cheap veal shanks and boiling them for an hour in tap water- tasted fine to me. I've never found veal stock for sale.
