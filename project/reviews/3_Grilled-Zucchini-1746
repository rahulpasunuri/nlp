Eh...so so. Maybe because I cooked it on an electric grill, maybe because I used "large" zucchini as directed, and they were too mushy, but I didn't love this. The mixture of salt, chopped herbs, olive oil and garlic was great by itself :) but didn't love it all together. Was better w/some balsamic vinegar added.

I ended up doing this on the grill in a heavy pan. I added onions and yellow squash. My hubby loved it. My dad--who always makes an effort to avoid veggies--has been requesting it every time they come over for BBQ!!

This was a simple yet delicious way to use summer zucchini from my Dad's garden. I make it quite often.
