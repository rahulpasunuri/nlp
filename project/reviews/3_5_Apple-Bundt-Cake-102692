Very big hit on Thanksgiving. Served with scoops of homemade vanilla ice cream to make it even more decadent. Made 2 very minor changes. Used 5 tbs of dark brown sugar to mix with the apples rather than white. Also placed pecan halves in the bottom of the pan before adding the first layer of batter. Nice complimentary taste. But I could have changed nothing and it would still have been great.

I think the cake was way too sweet even though I reduced the sugar to 2 cups. Also, just using vegetable oil instead of butter didn't give the cake any richness of flavor that it could have used. If I try it again, I would use half cup vegetable oil and .5 cup (1 stick) melted butter to see how that tasted.

I've made this cake four times in a week-- once in a 10 cup Star of David bundt pan for Hanukkah, and three times in a more traditional 12 cup Nordic Ware bundt pan for Christmas parties. It's an absolutely delicious cake, and I concur with the reviewers who wrote that it improves after a day or two. Make it ahead, let it cool completely, and then wrap well in plastic. I made a simple buttermilk icing for the first one, but I prefer this cake unadorned. I also prefer it with tart granny smith apples and slightly less sugar. My only complaint about this recipe is the cooking time and temperature. At 350 for 90 minutes, it would burn. It takes 80 minutes tops, and I've been lowering the temp by ten degrees toward the end. Watch the cake carefully. It's worth the extra care, because the flavor and texture are both excellent.

Excellent Cake. I would only add a wonderful glaze the next time. Love the fact it has a firm outside texture and the inside is wonderfully moist. Will definitely make it again.

This cake is absolutely delicious! Something about it reminds me of Christmas, probably due to the orange zest and cinnamon. I agree with other reviewers that a) you need to loosen the cake with a knife before turning it out (I let it cool completely in the pan, which had been greased and floured) and b) it didn't take 90 minutes to cook. It took more like an hour, so do check it to be safe. The batter will be very thick, so it's more of a "dollop" rather than a "pour" when you put it in the tin. I just spooned it over the apples and spread it a little using the back of the spoon. I will definitely make this one again.

I made this for Rosh Hashanah dinner last night and it got rave reviews. I used Gravenstein apples and made a few other modifications: I baked it on convection at 325 for 1 hour, 10 minutes, and I put a honey glaze on top, though I don't think it was necessary for moistness. I also cut the sugar by 1/2 a cup. Next time I'll probably cut more sugar AND leave off the glaze, as my one complaint was that it turned out a bit too sweet.

I dont know whats with all of the negative reviews, this cake is delicious! I may add walnuts next time. Also do not cook it for more then 80 minutes! I also made a glaze out of icing sugar and milk to make it look more appealing. If you use an oil spray and flour carefully you shouldnt have a problem removing it from the pan

Made cake 2nd time - halved the recipe used mini-bundt pan for 6 individual cakes. Bakes 14 min. and 4 of 6 cakes stuck to pan and broke apart... still very tasty and moist, but disappointed over the breakage. Wonder if cutting down sugar will help next time (??)

Rating: 3
This is an excellent cake - moist and not too sweet. Instead of one large bundt cake, I made mini-bundts and due to their small size, they cooked in about 14-15 min. Be sure to watch them closely, so they don't overcook! Delicious by itself - - or I also served the cake with a little whipped cream and some fresh berries. I will definitely make these again!

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, and was thrilled with the result. Perfectly moist, not too sweet despite the amount of sugar in the recipe and gone within an hour when I took it to work. The added orange flavor gives it an extra unexpected dimension. Just make sure to grease and flour your bundt pan carefully or it will break apart.

The first time I made this cake 2 weeks I was just trying to use up some Pink Lady apples and a pear that were left over for the week. My family adored it. I made it again for Easter with Golden Delicious and it was just as good. The batter is viscous but it needs to be to suspend all those apples!

I've just pulled this from the oven and it is delicious! I must admit that I broke it. I would recommend that you use a knife to loosen it from the bundt (this was my first bundt cake-maybe everyone knows that already). Hopefully no one will be too harsh on the appearance when I serve it w/ coffee tomorrow.

I have made this several times. I always cut back the sugar and I add a pinch of ginger nutmeg and allspice. I use half applesauce and half oil. I made it today with blueberries and apples and it was ever better. Sometimes I don't bother with sugaring the apples first and it still tastes pretty good!

Rating: 3
This was really good. However, I wish I'd read the reviews beforehand and cut back the sugar. The amount called for in the recipe makes it too rich and sweet. I also would have added more spice to the apple mixture. Still very good, though, and easy to make.

I made this for a dinner gathering because I had an abundance of apples. It was a slightly risky choice since it was for a chocolate loving crowd however; it was a HUGE hit!! An encore appearance was requested by a devout chocoholic for our next dinner gathering. I only made minor modifications ...used more spices with the apples (nutmeg, allspice, cardamom) and tossed with maple sugar rather than regular sugar. Served warm with coffee ice cream & caramel sauce... AWESOME! Leftovers (if there are any) are great with coffee the next morning.

I made this cake for the first time a few weeks ago and it was wonderful!! I did NOT change any of the ingredients, BUT, I did add blueberries into the apples. This cake did NOT last in my house. It is moist on the inside and crunchie on the out. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is a great recipe, especially after it sit overnight. I put half of the batter in then layer apples, walnuts and cinnamon then top with remaining batter and add another layer of apples, walnuts and cinnamon. Makes a really nice dessert if you serve with a little caramel sauce and whipped cream.

Used tart apples, lemon instead of orange for peel and juice. Made a lemon glaze (icing sugar+lemon juice) and poured it over while warm. Reduced sugar to 2C. Used part butter and olive oil for the fat. Brought it to a party and people loved it - especially the people who liked cakes that weren't too sweet. A dense cake, with a fine crumb. (2.9 forks)

This is an absolutely fantastic cake recipe. My only slight modifications to the cake were to omit the orange peel (I didn't have any on hand) and I used a combination of the different apples I had on hand. I also made a rum glaze to top the cake - tasted much better than plain powdered sugar would!

dense dense dense. I really wanted to like this, but I found it to be just ok. the cake is way too heavy and dense. I did the suggested subsitutions, lessened the sugar. replaced 1/2 the oil with applesauce.

Rating: 2
During baking, the sugared apples exuded juice which burned and stuck to the sides of the pan - after baking and cooling, the cake didn't come out in one piece. The finished product is extremely sweet, I'd cut down on the sugar by at least 1/3 cup. If I attempt this cake again, I will certainly make adjustments per reviewer's comments.

Rating: 4
Received rave reviews from everyone at the office. Some even said it was my best. Soaked the apples in Calvados and in the sugar/cinn mixture. I only did two layers so the apples baked on top and the whole top layer was like bread pudding. Don't skip the orange zest - it added a lot.

I made this for valentine's dinner dessert for my sweetheart, served it with ice cream and some toasted walnuts. Super sweet, just like my sweetie!

I thought this cake was delicious and made it on a whim having looked for a recipe that called for apples. I didn't have enough oil so I used half butter. The baking time just under one hour produced a lovely crunchy outside and a nicely moist cake inside. Everyone in our rural village of France loved it.

Before making this cake, one should think about whether or not they like oil vs. butter in baked goods. I made the recipe exactly as written and although some people liked it, I thought it was greasy, dense and just plain sticky. The flavor was very nice, but texture is where it loses. If you tend to like heavier cakes, this could be nice. Otherwise, I would try some of the previous reviewer's suggestions. At that rate though, you might as well look for another recipe. Just my two cents...

Rating: 3
This recipe turned out great and the best part is that it took 20 minutes to make, and was super easy. I used frozen apples and cut the oil to 3/4 C as is my standard for recipes w/ oil in them. The baking time listed has got to be off though, I only baked mine for 1 hour and it was just a little too brown on top, but the sides and interior were perfect. Very moist, and unlike a previous review I thought the addition of orange was just the right touch!

Rating: 1
Yikes! I did not have luck with this cake. Too greasy, too dense. I made it as printed, but if I try again I will follow some advice from the reviews, especially to substitute butter for oil. It sounds like a good cake, but it seems like the people who loved it changed it from the original.

I made this cake and it was gone in one day! My husband took it up to work and it disappeared! I soaked the apples in Calvados. Yummmmm! Will definitely make it again!

Rating: 1
I found this cake to be too greasy and too sweet. I would suggest cutting down on the oil and the sugar by at least a third. (Or to cut the sugary taste, I would choose a more tart apple, such as Granny Smith, which might balance out the original amount of sugar in the recipe.) The amount of orange juice recommended was insignificant and did not add to the otherwise normal "yellow cake." I would not make this cake again.

Rating: 3
I was so thrilled to have found this recipe! I had this very same cake in the past but neglected to ask for the recipe. After searching and unsuccessfully trying many others seemingly "delicious" apple cake recipes did I come across this one. From the description it sounded what I was looking for and it truly was. It's such a hearty one and is especially good in the morning with coffee. This is one of the few recipes not to be lost amongst my hundreds of others and to be passed along to friends and relatives! A real winner!

Not a glamourous dessert, but very much enjoyed by my guests as an end to a German-themed meal. Texture turned out heavier than I anticipated, similar to a pound cake, but it was very tasty. Added bonus, very quick and easy to make, about 30 minutes, including peeling and chopping apples. Did deviate from the original recipe a bit, based on other reviews: used melted butter in place of oil, reduced the sugar, and baked for about and hour and ten minutes. Will definitely make again.

I'm looking up this recipe now to send it to a friend of mine!! This cake is delicious. I only cooked my 1 hour 15 minutes and it was perfect.

Will definately make again. Loved the layering effect.

This is a phenomenal cake!

My family thought the cake was good. I soaked the apples in brandy for a couple of hours and drained them well before mixing apples with the cinammon and sugar. I used a cup of butter instead of vegetable oil which gave the cake a rich buttery flavor and reduced sugar by 1/2 a cup. If I make this cake again I will not use as much cinammon on the apples next time. Overall, the cake was good.

I love this cake, and so does everyone else, but you have to really grease the pan carefully and liberally in order to get the presentation right. I have been disappointed more than once. It is a very sweet cake, and I always mean to cut down on the sugar but haven't yet. I always use Granny Smith apples in my cakes and pies. The tartness and crispness work well in baking. I have shared this recipe with many friends. I have even substituted fresh blueberries rolled in flour for the apples. MMMMM!!!!!!

I won't assign an official rating because we changed the recipe (ingredient availability and health reasons). Anyway, we reduced the sugar from 2.5c to 1.75c, reduced the oil from 1c to 1/2c, increased the orange juice from 1/4c to 1/2c, left out the orange peel and powdered sugar. After baking it for 70 mins and letting it cool for a bit, had no problems getting it out of the pan because it was a tube pan and the bottom had been lined with parchment paper. It came out like a slightly dry (overbaked?) pound cake that could have used more flavor and pizzazz. It certainly was no match for the Apple-Walnut Cake we made at the same time. Didn't try this cake the next day to see if the flavors melded. Overall, I liked it, didn't love it, and wouldn't try it again.

Rating: 2
My main gripe with this desert was that I used a fancy bundt pan and it did not come out of the pan. I used a pastry brush to get the oil all over the pan, then floured. Maybe Pam or butter would have been a better choice.I sliced each piece individually to serve so no big deal, but I was hoping for a great presentation. This was ok-not the most amazing as the cake seemed a little bland.

Rating: 3
First, I used a pretty bundt cake pan with a detailed pattern and should probably have used the plain one for more even baking. Second, I took it out at one hour but think it didn't bake long enough because it was more than just moist at the very inside; it was RAW. 10 more minutes would have done it. This may also be because I soaked the apples in spiced rum and didn't drain it all off, so the apples were a lot wetter than they should have been. I used 4 teaspoons of cinnamon instead of the two in the recipe and it was great - the little tingle of cinnamon but not an overpowering flavor. All my complaints aside, everyone LOVED it and said it was great. All the flavors melded together well and people were trying to figure out what was in it. I baked it for an hour but it rose up over the center of the pan and crusted over so I had a hard time getting the toothpick test to give an accurate result. It seemed done but then two days later we cut it and found the raw center. It came right out of the pan because I sprayed a little PAM onto an already non-stick pan. I also only used about 2 1/2 apples and it was still too much for the poor 12-cup pan to hold - I had a bit of batter left over.

Rating: 4
I love anything with apples, so I may be biased, but this cake was fantastic. I had to cut the recipe by 1/3 because I only had an 8-cup bundt pan, and took the low-fat suggestions (1/2 large banana and 2 eggs; substituted the oil with half fatfree sour cream and half apple sauce) and substituted 1/2 the flour with whole wheat pastry flour. I shortened the cooking time to about 50 minutes. It was fanastic, moist - my parents never eat anything that's lowfat or whole wheat and they loved it!

Rating: 4
As suggested by the reader before me, I made this cake a day in advance. It was moist and delicious. I served it with vanilla ice cream and drizzled it with caramel. It tasted like apple pie, only it is cake. Next time, I will only serve it with vanilla ice cream because it didn't need the caramel.

Rating: 3
This cake improves drastically with age - day one, two forks at best; day two or three, three and half forks at least! I cut down on the OJ just a smidge, and soaked my apples in apple brandy. Absolutely fabulous if you make it ahead of time; if you're looking for something to serve the same day, this isn't it. Oh, and by all means - pull it out of the oven after an hour. Mine passed the "done" test at 55 minutes and surely would have been good for nothing more than a doorstop if I'd given it the full 90 minutes that the recipe instructed.

Delicious and a snap to prepare. I used a 12-cup Kugelhupf pan and it was done in 1 hour 15 minutes. Would agree that the cake should cool longer than 15 minutes before removing from the pan. The cake was still very delicate after 15 minutes and broke in one place, but was so tasty no one cared.

I have to admit that i substituted so much that I can't really call this cake the same as the original, but it was wonderful, so if you want a great apple cake with much less fat, check it: i used 1/3 cup oil, 1/3 cup non-fat sour cream and 1/3 cup unsweetened apple sauce with a splash of soy milk instead of all the oil. Instead of 4 eggs I used 2, and one mashed ripe banana. Also I used half spelt flour with the all-purpose. The cake was moist, sweet, and lovely- better the next day though, as they say.

I cut back the sugar by 1/2 cup and used raw (organic) cane sugar. Also, upped the cinnamon by 2 teaspoons. Used braeburns instead of galas, and used butter instead of vegetable oil. It was awesome-tasting, but it tore in half on the way outta the bundt pan. My comment is let the sucker cook cake in pan on rack for way more than 15 minutes. Try about an hour! And oil/flour that bundt pan really well!

This cake is outstanding, but only if eaten the next day.It takes this long for the flavors to meld together, but when they do....WOW! I only used one and a half cup of sugar instead of the two and a half cups called for in the batter, and it was still sweet enough. Also, I substituted whole wheat flour instead of white, and the cake was very moist. DO NOT bake this cake for more than one hour or it will be very dry! I checked mine at the 1 hour point and the top was getting way too brown. When I inserted a toothpick it told me that it was already done. The orange peel is what makes this cake so special. Chopped walnuts were another addition of mine, to the original recipe. This is definitely a keeper!

I've been making this cake for about twenty years. It's from a recipe from Jean Hewitt author of the "The New York Tmes New England Heritage Cookbook". It was included in my "The Good Cook" series cookbooks the ingredients are all the same, just the amouts vary. Hint: the amout in my recipe calls for 5 teaspoons of cinnamon. I think if you like cinnamon, add more. great with coffee or for the kids afterschool. And tastes better the next day. ALSO if browning too quickly after 5o mins. cover w/foil--nix the rind-not necessary--do up the cinnamon to 5tsp--and try with pears instead---even better

I've twice made this cake, trying to like it. The top does end up browning and crusting nicely however I found the recipe to yield too strong an orange flavor so that I couldn't taste apple at all! If I ever try it again I'll decrease by at least half the amount of orange rind and/or juice.

I'm not sure whether this is the same Bon Appetit recipe I've used in the past (due to spouse that is a chronic recycler of cherished magazines!. If it is there are a few errors in the recipe that make all the difference. First, should be 4 cups apples (about 3 large) instead of 4 large. Also 1 cup of chopped walnuts (I roast my) should be added to the apple mixture. Then add one cup of sour cream to the oil/egg mixture. One very critical detail (that I learned the hard way) is to make absolutely sure that the apple mixture is not in contact with the bundt pan. Remember sugar burns and may cause the cake to brown too quickly so you pull it out too soon = undercooked middle. Try filling the pan half way and pressing apples into the batter. Finally, my recipe calls for whipping cream and a caramel sauce on the side.

This cake wasn't bad, but it didn't knock my socks off either. I took the advice of previous reviewers and cut back on the sugar a little, and used a cup of applesauce, and only about 1/4 cup of oil, if that. Moist and great with coffee this morning. It is better the next day. Nice and crunchy outside and I had no problem with it coming out of the pan or falling apart. Used Pam and flour, but I think my Bundt pan is nonstick anyway.

My 9 year old daughter wanted to know "where's the flavor?" I guess other people are making a different receipe or something -- I much prefer a German Apple Cake receipe my mom snagged from friends in Berlin. Butter instead of oil, lemon instead of orange. I think all of that oil was the problem, myself. I'll take butter any day.

Delicious. Not fancy, but reliable and keeps well. I made it when we had house guests - we ate it with a toffee sauce for dessert and it was fabulous. Then I left it on the counter and it was eaten for breakfast, for afternoon coffee by people who say: "I never eat dessert, but just a sliver please!" And it's wonderful for a bedtime snack with a glass of cold milk. I suspect it's the kind of recipe you could play around with, as well, but I made it exactly as written, and I did enjoy that slightly crunchy crust.

Very good cake, but I cut back on the sugar (reduced it by 1/2 cup)and the oil slightly and it was fine. The other reviews were very helpful.

We didn't try it warm, as everyone was too full from dinner last night to eat dessert! I'm eating some now (cool room temp) for breakfast with my tea. It's very pleasant, and doesn't seem too sweet to me. I will definitely make this again, as it was incredibly easy. I'll probably increase the apples next time, as I love lots of fruit in my baked goods. Oh, and by the way, I just sprayed the pan with cooking spray, and it practically fell out after the requisite 15 minutes cooling in the pan...

I have made this cake twice recently and it was delicious. Everyone loved it. However, there are some problems with the recipe (which I fortunately avoided by reading other reviews before I made the cake). First of all, it calls for an excessive amount of sugar, in my opinion. I used one tablespoon less in mixing the apples with sugar and cinnamon, and 1/2 cup less in the batter. It was still plenty sweet. Also, the cake only requires 65-70 minutes to bake. I am planning to try it with applesauce replacing some of the oil -- as recommended in some reviews -- and even less sugar. It will be interesting to see how it turns out.

Although the flavor (minus the orange peel) was good -- albeit a bit sweet -- the cake wouldn't come out of the pan, despite oiling and flouring thoroughly. I had planned to bring it to someone's house for dinner and had to bake brownies at the last minute because the cake was a wreck!

I had some trouble taking the cake out of the pan, which had been well oiled and floured. However, it still looked and tasted very good. I took out half a cup of sugar, but the cake was still a bit too sweet, so next time I will take out a full cup of sugar, use tart apples, add walnuts, as suggested, and maybe increase on the spices. The subtle orange flavor is great, and complements quite well the apples.

I hate to be one of the few dissenting voices, but I found this cake "just o.k." I didn't care for the orange flavor with the apple/cinnamon taste. I have other apple bread recipes that out do this one.

Served this cake with a warm caramel sauce, and my guests loved it. I baked it for 1 hour and 15 minutes, and it was perfect...very moist. I had no trouble getting it out of the pan as I had sprayed it liberally with cooking spray. Great fall dessert!

Everyone thought I had purchased this cake from a gourmet bakery it was so delicious! I DON'T recommend reducing the sugar. It makes a lovely crunchy "crust" on the part that is exposed while baking. The only problem I had was removing it rom the pan...It's very dense and heavy.

Rating: 3
I followed the amount of sugar and spice in the recipe exactly and thought the end result was too sweet. I loved the texture, however. Next time I make this I'll follow earlier reviewers' advice and significantly reduce the sugar, use tarter apples, and add a little additional spice.

Each time I've made this cake I've received rave reviews. And it's easy to make,too! The only "work" is peeling and chopping the apples. My kids enjoy helping me make this one. I have also used a simple powdered sugar glaze on this to dress it up a bit--powdered sugar with enough milk or orange juice to make a thick, spoon-able glaze. Next time I make it, I'll also try adding some chopped walnuts or perhaps a streusel-type filling. Try this one!

I made this recipe as is and it was delicious. But, I had a lot of pears and was looking for a cake recipe to use them in and thought I would substitute the pears for the appples. I mixed the pears with the sugar and cinnamon but then also added a half cup of flour since pears tend to be juicer than apples. I then continued the original recipe but to really "wow" my quests I also made the browm sugar pears (epicurious) and spoon that on top. AND THEN! I also made the five spice whipped cream (epicurious) and put a dollop on top. Umm eeee. I think this would be a great non-pumkin dessert for thanksgiving.

This recipe is simple and the result: delicious! I made a small variation--sprinkled the sliced apples with 5 tablespoons of light brown sugar instead of regular granulated sugar. Great for breakfast, as well as dessert.

A nice cake which isn't overly sweet despite the OJ, apples and sugar. I will follow the advice of others next time and decrease the sugar, either reduce or substitute the OJ and orange zest as well as replace some of the oil with applesauce. My cake was finished in 75 minutes. Very moist.

Rating: 2
I halved the recipe and baked it in a loaf pan for about 50 min. Used 2 Granny Smith apples and used only 3/4 cup sugar. The apple chunks were nice and tart, but the cake portion was still on the sweet side for me. Will try this without any sugar in the batter next time. Also, 1 tsp. of cinnamon was too much. Moreover, will increase the citrus flavor next time with more zest and the Grand Marnier that has been recommended. But, my biggest problem with this dessert was the texture of the cake. It reminded me more of a steamed pudding than a fluffy, airy cake.

Rating: 1
I bake regularly and since it is apple season, I thought I would try out a new recipe for the apples I just picked. Well, the ingredients seemed great but, I had trouble in two areas. First, I followed the cooking time (minimum) and the cake was overcooked, thus it split in half when I went to take it out of the pan. Secondly, it was more work than it seemed. Took me awhile- peeling and slicing the apples,etc. Although the taste is fine, and I can serve this with vanilla ice cream to conceal the poor presentation, many fruit and nut bread recipes are far easier and taste much more delicate.

Rating: 4
Very good, tender, moist and very easy--mixes up in no time at all. I baked it just 1 hr and 5 minutes--perfect. I highly recommend brushing the hot cake with 1/4 cup Grand Marnier, to intensify the orange flavor (brush bottom when still in pan, top when inverted onto rack). Cake came perfectly out of the pan (I used a light spray of Baker's Joy). Super for breakfast for people who hate breakfast food.

This is truly one of the best recipes. Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and I wouldn't change a thing. Some of the cake did stick when I turned it out so I'll just grease the pan better the next time (which will be soon).

My cake baked in 60 minutes and turned a beautiful golden color. I added walnuts with the apples. To flour the pan, I used oil and dusted the pan with bread crumbs. This always works great.

This really is the best apple cake ever! I made this for Rosh Hashanah dessert. I substituted apple cider for the orange juice and omitted the orange zest. I also drizzled it after it had cooled with a maple glaze. Mine took 65-70 minutes, by the way. I made it a day ahead, which worked out fine--in fact, two days later, it's still perfectly fabulous. It has a wonderful brown crust and a very tender, moist interior. An exceptional apple cake!

I also used only 1/2 cup oil and added 1/2 cup applesauce as well as reduced the sugar to 2 cups. Cake took 1 hr. 30 min. and was delicious! Great fall comfort food. Very easy to make. I made this in Florida and will have to play with high altitude adjustments when I get home.

This is a great cake. I added nutmeg to the cinnamon, only used 2 cups of sugar, and substituted 1/2 of the oil with apple sauce (a low fat cooking trick!) - it still turned out moist and delicious. The orange rind and juice add a nice dimension to the flavour. Also, I used granny smith apples and they were perfect - not too sweet.

This cake is very good. It took a good hour and a half in my oven. I added pumpkin spice and brown sugar to the apple mixture.

I made a couple changes based on what I had in the pantry, which I think gave the recipe a nice kick. Instead of vanilla, a 1/2 tsp. of real (no imitation!) almond extract is very tasty. Also, you can substitute some ginger, clove, and nutmeg (about 1/2 tsp. each) to toss with the apples instead of cinnamin. It only took 1 hour and 5 minutes in my oven.

Rating: 4
Delicious. The only change I made was I added 1 cup of Buttermilk for the oil. I cooked it for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Unfortunately I did not grease the tin properly and half of it stuck to the tin. However, it was still fantastic. Next time (and that won't be too far away) I will take special care in greasing the tin.

Actually, I made the recipe from the December l999 issue, which had the sour cream. It was very moist. The only thing I would suggest is more spices and apples. I wanted to give this 3 forks, but my father insisted on 4. Oh, well, fathers know best.

This cake happens to be my 11 year old's favorite cake, which I am happy to make as it's so quick and easy. One Saturday morning I was being super mom and made the cake in 10 minutes flat. As I was ready to take the cake out of the oven I realized it looked a bit small, but my son couldn't wait and had to have a piece "right now" The cake came out of the pan easily and I served a piece to everyone for breakfast. I was told that was the best yet, I tasted the cake and thought WOW it really is. After looking at the recipe again I realized that I had forgotten to put the sugar in. The cake was exceptional even without the sugar.

Very good cake - rave reviews at parties. I've tried it with apples only (good but bland), apples and cranberries (wonderful), cranberries only (quite good), and blueberries only (like a muffin). The best was apples and cranberries...very festive for the holidays too. To those whose cakes fell apart, make sure the fruit doesn't go all the way to the edge so the batter can hold the cake together. Mine came out perfect after 70 minutes.

This is a great cake. True, it burns if you don't watch it closely. I cover with a piece of foil if it starts to brown too much at the end. I coat the pan with Baker's Joy cooking sray (oil w/four mixed it) and it browns beautifully with a nice crust.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving. It did come with a caramel sauce, which was wonderful. The cake itself was delicious, HOWEVER, by the time I pulled the cake out, the outside was burned beyone consumption. we cut the burned part off, and the rest of the cake was cut into little bars and served almost like a trifle. My nephew filled up on it and didn't eat his turkey!!

Unfortunately, epicurious does not list this recipe the way it appeared in the magazine. It was to be served with a delicious carmel sauce and bourbon whipped cream. I made it for Thanksgiving and a birthday and people raved both times. It's worth looking up these other recipes (I know they are listed on their own) Seems odd that things are not kept together. PS - any sort of apples work great.

I love apple desserts, but this one did not fit my billing. It was definitely moist, but it didn't have enough apples in it. The crust was too dark (I think the baking time should be shortened), and this cake was just too boring. Even though my mom said it tasted better the next day, there are probably better apple dessert recipes out there.

I have one comment for the reviewer who said this cake "wasn't sweet enough"..."What must your dentist bills look like??!?!?" While this was very moist, (but also very heavy), I felt the immediate need to go brush my teeth after having a piece. I could have cut down on the sugar (you really need to), but why?? There are many other really good apple cakes out there w/out half the sugar, eggs or oil, but w/ just as much taste. I wont be making this again. (I cant afford those extra trips to the dentist.)

This is a great apple cake (can also be used in small loaf pans as Apple bread) I baked in historic Abingdon, Va. I personally cut the sugar back to 1 1/2 cups and add 1/4 cup of Sherry. I make a carmel glaze of condensed milk, butter and light brown sugar to pour over the cake. Use waxed paper in the bottom of your pan and be sure to let it cool 30 min before inverting pan. Cut the apples in small pieces and try using apples and ripe pears for a change. This is a must keep recipe; I am always asked for the recipe.

This was a wonderfully flavored cake. It came out a little dark on top due to the length of time for baking. The aroma said 'done' long before the time ran out and it made me a little nervous thinking it was burning. Next time I'll cut the time as suggested.

This cake was delicious, but it completely fell apart when I was taking it out of the pan. I would make it for our family again, but would not take the chance on making it for company. I ended up just dumping and spooning it into a large bowl and serving it in a bowl with vanilla ice cream. The family loved it - one of the best apple cakes I've ever made, I just wish it hadn't gone to pieces on me.

Wonderful foolproof cake. Comes out of pan easily using only a good spray of Pam. I made it for my husbands birthday today and know that I will make it many times in future. Next time I will cut the sugar down a little and make a calvados glase for the top.

I'm not a fan of apple desserts OR cakes without icing, but this cake is among the best I've ever tasted. It's very tender, and even the crust is delicious. I served it with vanilla ice cream, but it's great with just a glass of milk or a cup of coffee. It would be a wonderful addition to a brunch menu. I followed the recipe exactly as written except that I shortened the baking time by ten minutes. This cake would travel well, so I plan to make it again for parties and holiday gatherings. I'm also going to try an earlier review's suggestion to use peaches in place of apples. Mmmm!

This was a delicious cake! I'm wondering if I overcooked it as it was not as moist as everyone said it was? I'm wondering if cooking it 1 hr. and 15 minutes would make a difference? I cut up the apples in bigger chunks for more texture and served with vanilla ice cream. Tasted great!

This cake was so easy and it's so delicious!! It dissappeared from the plate so fast. Next time I will cut the sugar down by at least a half of a cup, I don't think you would miss it at all. I GENEROUSLY buttered and floured my scalloped bunt pan and it didn't stick. Be careful when moving this dessert, when I went to move it from cooling rack to plate it wanted to fall apart so badly. This dessert is also great if you keep kosher, because there is no butter in it, so you can have it with meat dishes. This was every bit as good as the rest of the reviews say it is!!

Must be me, I guess, but I didn't have much success with this recipe, despite the rave reviews. Followed the directions to the letter but about one-third of the cake stayed in the pan when I unmolded it. I thought it was too sweet & too moist. Almost pudding-y. I'm considered to be a good cook but this just didn't work for me. My cat seemed to enjoy it a lot though. I accidentally left a slice on the counter & he tucked right in !

Just as good as everyone says it is. I love grated orange peel in baked goods and this does not disappoint. Not only will I make it again, I may play around with the fruit a bit and add or substitute cranberries or use lemon peel with blueberries. It's just as good at room temp the next day.

This recipe truly is a gift from your mother, Amanda. Thank you for sharing it. I used a fluted Bundt pan and took the recipe literally by using a brushing of oil to grease it. The top stuck when I removed it from the pan. Next time I'll grease it generously with soft margarine or butter before flouring. Don't miss a spot or it may stick! It looked a little funny on my first try, but still tasted great. Everyone loved it, and it will now become a tradition in our family too.

At first I thought I had over-cooked it (at 1 hr 15 min) when I saw the dark brown color, but that's the best part! It is delicious! My only modification next time might be to reduce the sugar by maybe 1/2 cup (it is almost too sweet) and cut the apples in bigger chunks, as they shrink quite a bit with such a long time in the oven. Definitely worth making again.
