good! I made with maytag bleu cheese and pecans. I think the "specialness" of tenderloin was a bit lost in this recipe. Next time, I will use a good sirloin (also less expensive.)

I love this recipe. I've made it many times for guests and I always get rave reviews.

To the cook who said he/she wouldn't "boil the lettuce" next time - try reading the recipe carefully next time before you make it. No where in this recipe does it instruct you to boil lettuce - it does, however, tell you to boil the green beans!!!

The original recipe is nice.The second time I made the following changes and preferred it . I made it using arugala and red cabbage in place of the lettuce. I always find red onion overpowering so I used scallions . I changed the citrus to segments of fresh cocktail grapefruit. Added dried cranberries. Also used pecans and walnuts prepared in the following way: whisk one egg white to froth and add 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 Tbls. cinnamon and1 tsp. vanilla. Fold in one pound of pecans or pecan and walnut combination. Coat nuts. Spread evenly on a Pam coated jelly roll pan and bake in 350 degree for 30 minutes, turning once during baking. Store in your fridge or freezer for use with future salads. Hope you like it.

Well, I made this dish for my family (mother and husband), and they truly enjoyed it. In, on the other hand, did not like the combination of flavors. Regardless, due to my family's enthusiasm, I will make this dish often, but I will not boil the lettuce, as I just see it as a wasted step and do not see the benefit of it. (I substituted sesame seeds for the poppy seeds and left the green beans out altogether.)

I thought this recipe was very usual; no better than any other steak salad. The dressing tasted watery to me and I did dry the greens. Am I missing something? We're from beef country!

This has become my husband's favorite salad. We have had it numerous times during the summer. I grilled the steak outside for the flavor. I also used pecans instead of walnuts and toasted them under the broiler with a little sugar sprinkled on top. Blue cheese is a great idea for blue cheese lovers. Good surrounded with a ring of sliced avocado and tomatos.

This salad is absolutely delicious. I made it for a Mothers Day luncheon and everyone raved about it. I wanted to keep all the leftovers for myself!

Absolutley delicious! I used mixed spring greens instead of first 3 ingredients, and served on individual plates. It looked and tasted great. I didn't have walnuts but I don't think they are a necessary ingredient. Everyone had seconds!

Outstanding! I stood outside in 20 degree weather to grill the beef and it was worth it. made everthing at noon and assembled it last minute for a very late dinner. Perfect, no need for changes.

DON'T MISS THIS ONE!!! I am a chef and I loved this salad. The only improvement I made was to grill or barbecue the steaks. The smokey flavor could only add to the recipe. The sweetness and acidity of the dressing was "right on". The poppy seeds and fresh chives are essential so try not to omit or at the very least substitute with black sesame seeds and scallions. The mandarin oranges, feta, walnuts, and red onions were the perfect accompaniments. I believe fresh orange segments and candied walnuts could add appeal as well.

Delicious. I made this for a casual lunch and it was very well received. I grilled the tenderloin and peppered both sides generously beforehand. Will definitely make again.
