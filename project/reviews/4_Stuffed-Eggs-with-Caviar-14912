Fresh tarragon makes these eggs stand out from all the other appetizers at a cocktail party.

This just kicks deviled eggs up a notch. I love the saltiness of the caviar with the eggs. Definitely a keeper!

Well...I would NOT use large eggs again, they are just TOO large. Use less mayo and if you like caviar use more. (Use small eggs too, did I mention that?)
