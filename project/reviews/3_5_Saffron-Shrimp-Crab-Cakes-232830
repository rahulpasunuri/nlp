very nice but the saffron gets lost. Also, who wants all that lovely shrimp and crab pureed. I gave i a fine chop instead.

I was looking for a Shrimp with saffron recip. I didn't have any crab, so I used tilapia in the mousse and chopped shrimp as the lumpy stuff. It was great, although the chipotle overpowered the other flavors and I didn't even use a whole tsp of chipotle. Next time I'll leave the chili out of the cakes.

Delicious. I followed the recipe with no changes or substitutions and received rave reviews at a party full of foodies. Will make again.

While everyone else seemed to like this, I was surprised and disappointed the cakes came out like 'shrimp custard'. The puree of shrimp, egg, cream, etc. turned this into a gloppy batter-like texture that cooked into a sorta of custard or wierd scrambled eggs. Maybe it was my fault for not reading the recipe more carefully. Also, the creme fraiche and chilis mixture was too salty, I would halve the salt in that.

Good ecipe. I changed it a bit. too spicy with the chili so I left this out and added in cilantro. I changed theh dipping sauce to a lime-marmalade sauce. Guests love it.

Oh, yeah!! The crowd went wild over these at Christmas party last night. It was a good thing I sampled one before they left the kitchen, because the platter returned empty in minutes. I wanted them to be bitesized, so I used a teaspoon to drop them on the baking sheets and chopped the shrimp just a little finer than 1/3 inch pieces. I brought the uncooked shrimp and crab mixture to my friends' house and baked them while the guests waited---a little theater doesn't hurt. The recipe has a couple of steps, so it takes a little longer to put together than some seafood cakes, but that is offset by baking the cakes instead of frying them.

WOW!! I made it exactly as directed and used the recipe for creme fraiche (make this 2-3 days ahead for best results) on this site. My guests were very impressed ("fabulous" was the word used) and it was the hit of an easy, relaxing and enjoyable summer dinner. Thank you to the creator of this recipe!
