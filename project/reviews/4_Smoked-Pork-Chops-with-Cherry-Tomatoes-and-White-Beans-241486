I loved this! Felt as though I were in Italy while eating it. I changed it a lot. Used regular pork chops, but dusted them with flour, salt & pepper before pan frying them. Used fresh basil instead of thyme and squeezed fresh lemon juice over the dish at the end. It was very light, fresh and so yummy. I will make this often. Very easy!

a simple and delicious dinner! I used regular porkchops, and garbanzo beans instead of white beans...I also mashed up some green olives in lieu of green olive paste. Even with all the substitutions, this recipe was a hit!

This was a great recipe that complimented smoked pork chops perfectly! I added a little white wine to the tomatoes and garlic before adding the beans. I did not have any green olive paste but made my own with brined olives in the blender with a touch of olive oil. I even added a few olives at the end as garnish. The olive flavour with the tomatoes and thyme brought out the smoky sweetness of the chops and made a perfect and simple meal! This one surprised me!

I made this last night and we really liked it. I overcooked the beans and tomatoes a bit, so it was kind of mushy but it had a really great flavor. I used a Kalamata Olive tapenade, instead of the green olive paste. I think I might try to make this without adding it to porkchops next time and try it as a side-dish.

Instead of using smoked pork chops, I prepared the pork as in Garlic-Rosemary pork chops (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Rosemary-Pork-Chops-240946) and made the beans according to the directions. Served with a winter greens salad. Super easy, fast and delicious!

Time consuming but sooooo worth it. I love this and have used the dipping sauce to create my own version of fried rice with grilled flank steak. It's a great way to learn about different flavors and how to use them with other applications.

Awful. The quality of the smoked pork was akin to hot dogs. Very hearty but not something we enjoyed.

This is so easy! The beans taste great. I also couldn't find olive paste or smoked pork chops, but substituted tapenade and pan fried chops.

Considering how simple and quick this was, I was very impressed. Didn't have smoked pork chops so I seasoned and pan-fried some.

Wow, I am really impressed by how flavorful and easy this was. I couldn't find olive paste so I had to use tapenade but other than that I didn't change a thing. This is going in regular rotation.

This is a delicious and easy dinner. I will be making this again and again.

Made this last night, with a few changes. Browned the pork first in a heavy pan, removed, kept warm, then added the garlic and tomatoes, deglazed with white wine, used more tapenade and thyme than called for, simmered for approximately 20 mintues. Fabulous! My fiancee and really enjoyed it with a nice rioja.
