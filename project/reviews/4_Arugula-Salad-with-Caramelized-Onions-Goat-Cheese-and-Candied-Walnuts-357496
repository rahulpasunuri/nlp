Delicious, easy, and healthy! I made this for dinner, after work-- I bought candied walnuts to speed up the process and it was still delicious. I will absolutely make this again!

I made this for the first time for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it even a teen boy who "doesn't like fancy salads". Just one note, the dressing is a little sour so I added a pinch of brown sugar.

I added sliced asian pear and used Trader Joe's candied walnuts (they have pecans too). Lovely fall flavor.

This might be the best salad I have ever made. It is delicious and worth the trouble! I've made it twice, once with arugula and once with organic spring mix and green lettuce from my farm box. It's equally good either way. I had no trouble making crunchy walnuts. I followed previous reviewers' suggestions to use a little less water when cooking them. To lower calories, I also cut way down on the amount of goat cheese that I used.

Measurements on topping should be subjective. I like it a little lighter--but if you have it all done ahead of time, you are good for more salads, right! Candied walnuts were gooey--but still tasty. Nice combination of textures. I preferred to layer the salad, onions, drizzle the dressing lightly and top with goat cheese rather then toss together--it presents beautifully. Used Spring mix salad.

This is an excellent salad...wonderful flavors and textures. As to the sticky walnuts....Decrease the water a little and boil the sugar mixture for several minutes at least so that it is further in the caramelizing process, before you add the nuts. Once you add the nuts, stir constantly until the nuts begin to sugar. They get coated with a dry sugary coating and are crunchy.

Made this salad and it was delicious with the following changes: decreased the croutons, goat cheese, and candied walnuts to a reasonable amount. All the flavors were a great combination but if we had used the quantities of croutons, walnuts, and goat cheese in the recipe the salad would have been too rich for us.

This recipe looks delicious, but how did it wind up in the "healthy" category? 435 calories and 70% from fat? Definitely not my idea of healthy...

Easy to make. Boil off more liquid on the walnuts to make sure they turn out crunchy. I struggled a bit with the onions, but it's either my stove or I need more practice! :) I also used store bought croutons to save time. Flavors work really well together - will definitely make again and again.

I found this salad to be too sweet between the candied walnuts and the sweet caramelized onions. Perhaps adding some cayenne and other spices to the walnut mix would balance some of that.

I loved this salad! I put in half as much goat cheese and bought the croutons from the store to save time. It was fast to put together, delicious, and filling. The candied walnuts were so good and the sweet from them balances out the goat cheese.

I hate goat cheese so I substituted Feta and it was great... also used dried cranberries for some color and some sweetness.

This definitely did not feel like a healthy salad to me, but it is tasty. You may find that the 10 oz of goat cheese makes the salad too heavy. If I make it again, I will cut the cheese down to half of that. The candied walnuts were so good. I just boiled them on high, stirring constantly, until the liquid was gone, and then layed them out to harden.

Really delicious salad, I'd make those caramelized onions for other types of salads in the future as well, they add a whole new dimension in flavor. My modifications: I didn't candy the walnuts, just toasted them. I didn't make this dressing. I had leftover Balsamic Dressing from the Bon Appétit, March 1999 recipe so I tossed in 2 tablespoons of that instead (I only made about 4 servings).

This is incredibly delicious. If you want the walnuts to be crunchier, just cook off more of the water in the skillet and throw them in the oven for 5-7 minutes. Instead of arugula on its own, I used a spring mix with arugula included.

This is a delicious salad. Very fresh tasting! I wasn't pleased with the reviews regarding the candied walnuts, so I made the candied pecans from the Spinach Salad with Mango and Pecans from the Bon Apetit April 2000 edition. These are absolutely DELICIOUS and not tacky at all. Everything else was excellent though!

Have made this 2x, once as written, the second time with some adjustments. I also found the walnuts to be soft/soggy/chewy -- I thought they should have a crunch. After the glazing step I turned them out onto a buttered sheet pan and baked until the coating became dark brown. I also added a heavy dash of cayenne. I added fresh herbs to the croutons, some thyme and sage is what I had on hand. Overall a great combination of flavors and textures -- stole the show!

This is a really good salad. It is a lot of work though - so being able to prepare a lot of the ingredients ahead of time was great. I made the entire recipe for my husband and me. The first night we ate it as a salad, the second night I sauted some chicken breasts that I added to it and we ate it for the main course. Yum!

I've made this twice now, both times without the croutons. Only problem was the candied walnuts -- they were very sticky. Usually when I make candied walnuts I do not add water. The onions were great, however.

It was great, I would make it again for guests.

Delicious the first day, not as good a day later. I thought the croutons lacked flavor and would add some garlic next time.

I used baby greens instead of arugula, which worked fine. The candied walnuts were delicious, but remained tacky (the coating never hardens). I left out the croutons and it still tasted great.

This was a very nice salad. The walnuts didnt harden the way I thought they should, but it still tasted wonderful. We had a late addition to our table, so I addeed spring mix salad to stretch it out and it was still delicious.

Thank you! I love this recipe. Will do it for my family next week.
