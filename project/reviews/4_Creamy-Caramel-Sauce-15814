Love this recipe. I've been using this caramel sauce for years in anything that calls for caramel. You must add salt, though. I've found 1/4 t. is perfect. Also, it's easier to work with a candy thermometer. I check mine when it gets to 260 degrees, and I usually take it off at 266 degrees. Also, agree with another reviewer that you have to have the cream (with vanilla added to it) ready to go, otherwise teh caramel keeps cooking and will scorch.

I would add a bit of salt to this recipe if I make it again. It doesn't work on ice cream -- freezes instantly into candy. Not very hard to make, but it did take a lot of careful watching and stirring.

I too had to throw out my first attempt- it got too brown and tasted burnt. On the second go, I took it off when the entire batch was golden with no brown in sight. I also made sure to have the cream and vanilla ready to go (I actually put the vanilla in the cream so I only had one thing to pour) because the sugar continues to brown once you remove it from the heat. I should have made a double batch, my greedy company was eating off of the spoon! An absolute winner- and so easy.

Add this to one batch of Italian Meringue Buttercream for an excellent caramel buttercream filling! This is a popular request from my customers w/ the double chocolate cake recipe on this site.

I didn't care for the flavor. It seemed like it boiled forever but maybe it wasn't quite done. I won't try it again.

This is the best caramel sauce I've ever made. It's easy and delicious. I made it to go with the chocolate souffles (which was wonderful), but I'll make it again whenever I need a caramel sauce.

Delicious and easy. I followed another cook's suggestion and cooked it over low-medium heat until it turned golden brown. It's a bit hard to tell exactly when the color is right since the liquid seems to get darker more quickly at the edge of the pan than at the center. I took it off the heat when the edges were a medium caramel brown. I'm a private chef and am serving it to a client tonight w/ apple pear and walnut filled phyllo bundles, so we'll see what he thinks!

It's great to prepare souffle the day before. Everyone loves this recipe. I've made it twice and will make it again this coming weekend for my east coast family arriving in CA.

Great caramel sauce. I added a tablespoon of brandy with the cream and vanilla and it was wonderful. I did have to make it twice - the first time I let it get too dark and it had a slightly burned taste. The second time I lowered the heat so that it turned golden more slowly and it was perfect. Does anyone know a sure fire way of getting it right everytime?

This sauce went nicely with spiced pumpkin cheesecake(recipe also from epicurious). Watch it carefully while boiling it as it would be easy to burn it once it starts turning caramel. Easy and delicious!

Wonderful with the Chocolate Souffles! Served at Supper club!

I served this delicious creamy caramel sauce with a warm apple cake. Everyone was delighted. I added 1 tablespoon of Calvados brandy to remove some of the sweetness and add some spark to the sauce. It was heavenly.
