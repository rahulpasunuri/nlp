I was so excited to make this salad because I love a spinach, love bacon, love goat cheese so I was very disappointed when the result was just okay. I'm a big believer that every salad needs crunch and this one was lacking. The dressing was bland. On the positive side it was easy and I love the variety of natural healthful ingredients (yes I consider bacon and oil healthful if in moderation).

I did enjoy this salad quite a bit. I sauted the red pepper so they were a bit burnt on the edges. Who doesn't like goat cheese, bacon and red peppers...yum. I would make the dressing in a saute pan instead of the fry pan as it did splatter a bit. I liked the idea of a previous review to carmelize the red onion. I'm sur that would make this over the top.

A tasty, pretty salad that would work wonderfully as a side dish on a holiday table. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

I really enjoyed this salad. My friend and I ate the whole salad in one sitting, so if you cooking for hearty eaters, i would double the ammount.

I don't know if I would make this again.I thought the dressing was a little bland so I added a splash of red wine vinegar.

I don't eat meat so I just used a bit of olive oil to saute the peppers and mushrooms. I also only had chardonnay vinegar so I used that instead of champagne vinegar. I found the recipe very easy to scale down to one serving. I thought it was quick, delicious, simple and very nutritious. I ate it for lunch with a slice of Ace Bakery Grainery bread and a couple of figs.

Love this salad however next time I'll definitely be added a couple more slices of bacon!

I decided to make this at the last minute and had to substitute big time. I used sugar in the raw, chicken grease (very little, as the chicken was lean), pine nuts and red wine vinegar as substitutes. I didn't have the mushrooms or onion. it was still fantastic!

this recipe is great. the warm dressing on spinach is timeless. it is super quick and really easy. i feel that it is missing a contrast flavor, like dill or tarragon. it could also use a sweat, like raisons, or something more sophisticated. I tried raisons and it worked well, fresh fgs might work too. i also used vidalia onions because i dont like reds and i cooked the onions with the pepper and garlic. over all its great, simple, cheap, and delicious, thank you!

Great recipe! My tweaks are to use baby spinach leaves and to caramelize the red onion. Terrific dish.

Clearly this recipe makes too much dressing. Important to note, but just divide the recipe in half! That shouldn't take away from the flavor-- which is wonderful! The goat cheese is very mild when combined with the spinach and peppers. I think the textures are pleasing. This is a fun recipe that looks like you've done a lot, but is so simple to prepare. I used tofu bacon. Bacon drippings are gross and should never be used in a recipe. If you've found yourself drizzling bacon drippings onto your food, or into something, give yourself pause and put the pan down. It's not worth it!

I was really excited to make this after all the great reviews, but ended up being REALLY disappointed with how it turned out. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and halved the dressing, but the end result was pretty boring. Ok, but not anything special.

This salad was delicious! I'm not a huge fan of spinach so I used 1/2 spinach and half arugula. Also added toasted macadamia nuts and caramelized the onions in the drippings, which brought out a nice sweetness to contrast against the saltiness of the bacon.

A wonderful salad. No leftovers. I used less oil than called for. I also sauteed onions a bit with mushrooms too! I've made it twice already in the past week! This is a permanent salad in our house!

WOW! Excellent and what a beautiful presentation it makes! Everyone loved it and there were no leftovers :o( !!

I made everything ahead of time and tossed the spinach, onion and goat cheese with the dressing, which was reheated in the microwave, before serving. It was excellent.

Excellent salad. I drained the bacon fat to a bowl and used just as much as needed. I reduced the olive oil to 1/3 C and used about 2 T of maple vinegar and less sugar. I marinated the peppers, mushrooms, onion in the warm dressing and added the spinach and goat cheese just before serving. It was a bit hit.

I made this for a dinner party, and it was a big hit. The flavors are great together. We DID get the fresh applewood-smoked bacon from behind the meat counter at Zupan's, and I think that made the flavor much richer. GREAT dish!

Delicious salad. I made a half recipe, and added a chopped clove of garlic to the dressing. My wife and I finished the whole thing off at one sitting for dinner.

This is a great salad. My only adaptation was in adding a couple of small red chillies to heat things up.

The best spinach salad I've ever made! The combination of flavors was perfect. I could make a meal out of just this salad. Only caveat is decrease the amount of dressing. Perhaps 1/2 C. olive oil and 1/4 C. vinegar.

Did a search on this site with "spinach mushroom" as I had both on hand and wanted something quick to put together for lunch with on-hand ingredients. Happened to have bacon and blue cheese on hand as well, so decided to whip up a variation. I didn't have peppers, but had some green and red onions, so just used those and went a little lighter on those. I made half the dressing as others suggestted, that's plenty. Very tasty and easy to make.

This is excellent! Drain 80% of the bacon fat just before making the dressing. Cut the oil, vinegar & sugar by half when making the dressing and...wah lah! You're guests will rave for days! It's really quite yummy!

Good salad, and easy to make. I followed the advice of the other reviewers and halved the salad dressing. Also, I would halve the amount of red onions. They smelled great with the other ingredients, but they're so sharp, and there were so many, that they overbalanced the other ingredients.

This is a great salad, but don't forget the bacon! We sprinkled it on right before serving. You will probably want to halve the amount of dressing, and shitakes make a wonderful & healthy substitute for the criminis.

The fact that this makes a cup of liquid salad dressing for four servings (despite how nice the flavor combination sounds) makes me kinda want to stay away from it..........or at least cut the oil and vinegar portion by 90%. Otherwise, cannot imagine this as anything other than "salad soup".

Great salad, very light and very easy to make. Agree with the salad dressing comments that it makes too much so just use half of the ingredients. Also, I'm not a big fan of goat cheese so we substituted using feta cheese and it turned out great.

Yes, I too noticed the error. If you followed this recipe exactly, then perhaps after you finished eating, you'd notice the nicely browned bacon still sitting on the paper towel in the kitchen. Oh well, save it for tomorrow morning's omelet!

Very good. The only thing that I would do is decrease the dressing. It was just a little soggy.

Great salad. Does make too much dressing, but I'll just half it the next time. The addition of the sauteed mushroom and bell pepper is wonderful. I used blue cheese, and did not have goat on hand...tasty! I do think 6 slices of bacon is way too much for this salad. I used only 2 slices for the whole recipe. Oh, they don't mention it, but you are to crumble the bacon and add it to the salad.

Does anyone think it's strange to cook all of that bacon and not use it?

This salad was one of the best I've ever had. Sure to please guests! However, I used about 1/2 of the dressing that the recipe called for.

Served this to guests last night and everyone loved it. A great combination of flavors, and there was dressing left over to use another time. The recipe didn't specify what to do with the cooked bacon, so I added it to the salad. Yum!!!

Yummy. Next time I would drain off about half the bacon fat and replace with olive oil before adding the mushrooms - I don't know if it was the bacon I used, but using all the rendered bacon fat was a touch too heavy. But overall it was fabulous.

This recipe was wonderful! followed exactly as-is & rave reviews from friends & family, and even a "I think this is the best salad I've ever had" from a fairly finicky eater in the group.. will definetly be making again.

I have to revise my review after noting a couple of errors (better not to review recipes so late in the evening from now on). First, I used HALF a bag of spinach and it still could have served four people as a side dish. Second, the recipe does clearly state that it makes four servings, not six as I previously noted. The recipe makes a lot of dressing and can probably handle almost two 10-ounce bags of spinach. It's excellent and one that I'll make again and again.

This was terrific. Great combo of flavors.

This is a fantastic combination of flavors. I halved the dressing and there was still plenty. I'm not sure it needs quite so much olive oil so I might cut down on that next time. The goat cheese really compliments the bacon and red peppers. Excellent!

Wow, was THIS good. A great salad. I made it on a ski trip for my sister and she begged me for the recipe (and she doesn't always do that). I only had to use one bag of spinach and it still made enough for four people. Although the recipe says it will feed six, if you used two bags of spinach I'm sure it would serve eight to ten. Yum!

This was very flavorful. Great combination of flavors. I used 1/3 of the dressing ingredients and found it more than enough.
