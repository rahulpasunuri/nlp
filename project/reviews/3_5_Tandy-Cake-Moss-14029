I too have made a similar recipe for years. There is no need to melt the peanut butter or the chocolate. As a previous user stated, just put the peanut butter directly on the hot cake. I wait about 3 minutes after it comes out and then place small dollops of peanut butter all over the cake. Give it a few minutes to start melting and you can spread it easily. Then sprinkle the chocolate chips on top of that. Make sure the chips are in a single layer, touching the peanut butter. Leave it sit until you see the chocolate change in color (it's melted). About 3-5 minutes. Then take an offset spatula and spread it over the cake. Sometimes the chocolate and peanut butter mix together. If you keep spreading it, it will all turn chocolate. Good luck! It's always a big hit with my family and friends. I wait until chocolate has cooled and set before I cut them with a serrated knife.

Thought this was good, but not great. Would be good for a picnic.

We really enjoyed this! Moist, fluffy cake with peanut butter and chocolate-- what's not to love? I took the advice of a previous cook and spread peanut butter on the hot cake.

This was incredibly easy to make, and it tasted amazing. It was a hit all around.

I have made a slightly different version of this recipe for years. The only difference is you don't have to heat the peanut butter before spreading it over the cake. Measure 1 cup of peanut butter and as soon as the "hot" cake is removed from the oven spread peanut butter on top. The heat of the hot cake is enough to soften it and make it spreadable. Delicious!! It takes like Tastykake Tandy Cakes!!! They are a local company in this area
