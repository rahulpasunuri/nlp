Very delicious. I used 4 yolks and replaced half-and-half with whole milk and felt that the result could use some more creaminess. Next time I'll leave the half-and-half in.

Outanding flavor,very rich. I used 6 egg yolks and it was fine as modified. The tangy flavor of the sour cream was almost lemon-like. Make this and share !

Pretty delicious. Great served with fresh strawberries or a rhubarb/strawberry sauce.

I received rave reviews with this recipe. The ice cream is VERY rich - I don't suggest eating it alone - I served it as an accompaniment to an apple tart, which was perfect. You could always lighten it up a bit by using whole milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2, using reduced fat sour cream, or using less eggs. All and all - a winner!

I would have given this 4 stars except for the fact that it is over the top rich. Do not plan on eating this without an accompanient - I served it with an apple tart (from Barefoot Contessa) - which was great, but I had lots of leftover ice cream. Next time I make it, I will cut back on the egg yolks and will substitute whole milk for the half and half. You could even cut back on the amount of sour cream - or even use lowfat sour cream. This is the beauty of making your own ice cream - anything goes!

This was incredible. Very rich but worth it. We made it to serve with a rosemary and pinenut tart from the Last Course cookbook by Claudia Fleming. Wow.

I thought this was a great ice cream flavor. I made it to serve with bananas foster and the sharpness of the sour cream flavor nicely offset the sweetness of the caramel sauce.

oh my gosh, this was the best stuff i have ever had in my entire life. The one thing i changed was to half the recipe because i am the only one in my family that likes odd stuff. Next time i will add 4 ounces more of sour cream
