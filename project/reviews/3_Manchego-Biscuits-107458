These went so well with a vintage port and a tawny port. They were very easy to make, and go with any sweet or fortified wine (we tried 9 different wines including Chateau D'yquem with our Wine Club) Try the Dark Chocolate Shortbread from the same 12/02 issue.

Holy crap, these were good. I don't have a food processor and just made them by hand, crumbling together the flour, salt and butter and then adding the other ingredients. I can feel them clogging up my arteries right now, though, so I think these would have to be an occasional treat.

I was pleased with the way these turned out. I served them with Spanish ham and olives and they went quickly. I loved the little kick the cayenne added!

Very tasty but delicate! I rolled some of my dough too thin and those biscuits crumbled with barely a touch. The ones that turned out were great! I didn't think the dough was particularly difficult to roll out.

Though I was a bit frustrated when the dough seemed to stick to EVERYTHING it came in contact with, the end result was great. I used crushed chili pepper seeds-great kick-and served them w/membrillo, spanish quince paste. Any advice on making them a bit sturdier? Spreading the quince was tricky.

I'm no baker, either, and these turned out great. I didn't have any manchego and used comte cheese, which was very good. I too was worried about the dough...but the results were just fine. I'll be making these again.

I loved this recipe. So versatile! I used the dough in petit four cups and filled them with chopped apples and walnuts. The cook from Boston has some great suggestions! A little Old Bay would go great with seafood chowder. I can't wait to make these again.

To the cook from Anapolis: This recipe works much like making a pie crust. To make the dough stick together you can add a very SMALL amount of ice water, only a tablespoon at a time and no more than three or four tablespoons total. Throughout the preparation, use only the "pulse" setting on the food processor, "pulsing" the mixture to combine. The mixture should still look somewhat crumbly. It's a very good idea to use the method of dumping out the dough from the food processor and working it very briefly by hand to form the disk, as recommended by the cook from Seattle. Let it rest for for the 30 minutes in the refrigerator. Then sprinkle flour on your work surface and on the top of your dough, and roll out the dough like you would a pie crust.

This recipe went tremendously well. You may be confusing biscuits (as in tall and puffy like the ones out of a can) with these which are like the water crackers. The name of the recipe should have been more like Manchego Wafers. I've begun to experiment with Old Bay, chili powder, etc. instead of the cayenne, and try Parmesean, or an English Cheddar for the Manchego. A terrific recipe!

I agree with the cook from 12/18. This does not need liquid - the butter and the cheese add enough of a binder to bring the flour into the dough. Sometimes when using my food processor in recipes like this, I let it generally combine all of the ingredients and work them just a bit and then I hand-work them the rest of the way. Depends a lot on the temp and humidity of the day I'm making them. I found these to be very good and substitutions of other cheeses as well as various herbs for the cayenne would be fun to experiment with.

I bake a lot and have to disagree with the reviews below. This is more like an english biscuit (hence shortbread) which does not contain any liquid. These were very good but did require more work than anticipated.

I don't even have to make these to know they left out the liquid. I make biscuits all of the time and they require not only the butter or shortening, but always liquid.

It seems the recipe may be missing the liquid; either buttermilk, regular milk, or water. Usually 1/2-1 cup liquid for 2 cups or so of flour. The cheese would make up for some of the butter used, and a very small portion of liquid, but certainly not all. Perhaps that is why your dough would not bind together into a ball. As for being sticky, extra flour usually eliminates that; adding a little at a time until it is consistent. I find dough better mixed by hand too. Breaking up the butter into the flour with a fork, mix in cheese, then add liquid a bit at a time until forms.

The biscuits ended up tasting good but were difficult for me to make. The dough in the food processor never did come together so I had to improvise. Being a cook who doesn't like to bake I figured this sounded easy. Can anyone tell me why my dough didn't form ANY kind of ball and why it stuck to everything? I used the chilled dough, a chilled marble surface, floured rolling pin and cutter.
