I think they should call this lasagna soup. It tastes great and is low calorie. Plus all the veggies are available in my garden at the same time. Wow. Even my kids love it although when you puree in the basil it goes from a lovely red to a nutty brown color. Still it is excellent. Can't give it enough praise.

Loved the smoky, nutty roasted flavor of the eggplant. To save time, I used a large jar of roasted peppers (instead of roasting them myself) and used an hand-held immersion blender, which worked perfectly, as usual. Delish!

This soup is excellent. I omitted the butter and it tasted great without it. To make it a meal, I threw in some cooked whole-wheat tortellini.Delicious! The only pain was roasting and peeling the peppers. :D I posted a pic of the final product here: http://blogs.creativeloafing.com/eatmycharlotte/2011/02/23/roasted-red-pepper-and-eggplant-soup/

I had an eggplant soup at a restaurant last month. It was so delicious that I vowed to try and make a batch at home. This recipe seemed to have the ingredients that matched the taste I remembered. The result was absolutely delicious. It has a lovely, creamy texture and much flavor. I'll definitely make this one again. It wasn't too time-consuming either.

this soup was good. i roasted the red peppers and a head of garlic along side the eggplant. but i feel there was too much stock. i used a vegetable broth & once added the flavor of the roasted veggies was greatly diminished. this could possibly be because i cut the recipe in half. i'd definitely do this again, except i'd add an extra peper or two

Excellent soup--maybe even a four- forker, but I'm not sure it's REALLY "exceptional." I cooked the onion-leek-garlic mixture considerably longer than the recipe suggested (slowly, while the veggies roasted in my convection oven)--and thanks to a VERY useful comment from another cook, omitted the butter and didn't miss it. It was a delicious first course for company on a winter night--nice texture, great flavor, and guilt-free. Will become a staple.

This soup is so tasty and a great use of the abundance of eggplant and peppers from the CSA this season. I broke up the work-time by roasting the eggplants and peppers one day and then finishing the soup another, and this worked just fine. I plan to freeze half for a mid-winter treat of fresh veggies! I give 4 forks for flavor and because I love recipes that accommodate my needs to use LOTS of veggies at once.

Exellent soup! Made it for the company and all asked for the receipe.

This is a great receipe. I substituted the fresh basil and thyme with freeze dried basil and oregano and it was fine. My husband said it was like eating in a restaurant!

Great! Made exactly as directed, but with homemade stock instead of canned. If anybody's counting calories -- I added the butter, but it tasted pretty much the same to me before and after. Lemon juice definitely improved the flavour, though.

I had roasted a number of red peppers to save from spoiling and had 2 eggplant on had. Virtually typed in the 2 and decided on this recipe. With all the prep virtually finished beforehad this was simple and very tasty. I thought the lemon juice at the end added the kick needed. I added some chili flakes to accommodate my tastes but I would definately make this again.

question-has anyone tried peeling the eggplant and then roasting it? it seems as though that would save some time/effort.

Rating: 4
I chose to make this soup as a gift for an eggplant-crazy friend. Mid-way through roasting, my oven literally locked up, so I had to punt. I purchased 2, 19-ounce jars of roasted eggplant, and 1, 16-ounce jar of roasted red peppers and followed the rest of the recipe -- the result was DEVINE! This unexpected change of course would cut the total prep time significantly when made again, so I highly recommend it as an alternative for those wanting the great taste without spending 3 hours in the kitchen. Make sure you purchase "roasted" veggies, not those heavily spiced or marinated.

GREAT SOUP. Anyone who makes pureed soup more than twice in a lifetime should use a stick blender. Provided the pot is deep enough, and a little care is taken in holding the stick blender upright, it is far safer and easier than putting hot soup into a blender a cupful at a time, to "explode" out!

To cut down on time, eggplant can be halved, scored, drizzled with olive oil, and microwaved covered 15-20 min.

This was a great tasting soup. It was a time consuming process though. I would make it again, if I had the three+ hours to devote to it. I left out the lemon, as I didn't feel it would add anything accept an acidic taste. I don't feel that this would have help the soup out.

Rating: 3
I really like this soup and have made it several times. It's great because it has a wonderful consistency without needing any cream. I do find it can sometimes have an acidic aftertaste, but the Parmesan really helps to cut that. It's a really good one for me as it uses lots of things I usually have in the kitchen anyway.

I had an eggplant & a leek about to go around the bend so I made 1/2 a recipe. I didn't have fresh red peppers, but did have some homemade roasted red pepper sauce left over from another dish so I through that in instead. The result was quite delicious (I would give it 3 1/2 - I rarely give 4 forks) Other than the time it took to cook the eggplant, I found this very easy to make and look forward to making it again!

I made this to take advantage of my summer garden full of fresh eggplant. It was good but a little bland, and preparation was a lot of work.

I made this for a women's luncheon group. The only change that I made to the recipe was to substitute vegetable broth for the chicken broth to accomodate the vegetarian members of our group. It is absolutely perfect for a summer lucheon! Everyone wanted the recipe. I served it with a tossed green salad. Next time, I'll pair it with a fennel and orange salad. Some cooks complained about the prep work. For me, it wasn't an issue. We grill frequently. And, every time we fire up the grill, I toss some peppers on to roast so that there is always a supply in the fridge. I never have any trouble finding a delicious way to use them before they go bad. I find that they keep for about a week.

Well it did taste good, but it was an awful lot of prep, and it just didn't have the quality that will have me making it again. Although, if you do make it make sure you have the cheese.

Rating: 3
Although the prep time for this soup is long, I would indeed make this again. I was unable to find fresh red peppers so I had use ones in jars. I am sure that fresh peppers make this recipe even better. I happened to have some fresh spincah on hand, so just before I pureed the soup I added the spinach. My husband, who doesn't care for soup, ate 3 bowls. I consider it a fine recipe.

Great soup--very light, but full of complex flavor. The cheese topping is a must. It was a great soup course for our Italian Chistmas feast. It got four forks from all our guests.

Have made this twice and it has been a surprising hit, even with my kids! It dies take some effort to roast and peel the peppers, but it is worth it. Enjoy!

I substituded the broth by 4 cups of greek-style low-fat yogourt and 4 cups of water. I eliminated the tomato paste, leek and onions and added 1 extra pepper, 1 eggplant and 2 Table Spoons of lemon juice. I also substituted the basil by chopped fresh mint leaves and added cumin and 1/2 table spoon of chipotles in adobo. It was fantastic!

It may just be my fault for choosing this recipe for a day when I didn't have too much time to be fussing with recipes, but I thought this was just a little too much trouble for the result. It was good, yes, but it took a pretty long time. I don't think I'd do it again, honestly, but that's not because I didn't like the results. I just think there are other similar recipes out there that require a little less and produce an equal or better soup!

I loved this recipe. A great flavorful soup. I also used it as a sauce over some salmon. It was wonderful.

This is so good!! I used a veg broth and it was one of the tastiest soups I've ever made. I rinsed the eggplant and even discarded clumps of seed which must have reduced the bitterness. I also skipped the last (lemon & parm) but still, the soup was excellent. Will try that last step the next time around-which is very soon. Enjoy!!

I made this into an epicurean and vegan experience by using veggie broth, no oil (saute in a bit of broth, it works!) This was a really superb soup... two recommendations: 1. immersion blender. 2. double it and freeze half (or send it to me!)

This soup was beyond words in flavor. Fabulous! I served it for friends at a dinner in my home. It was the opener. They loved it so much my friend said she must have the recipe. One thing though,this soup is probably the most time-consuming soup I have ever made. It is worth making it again .

Rating: 3
Pretty simple to make and tastes great. Only warning is to be careful when you purree the soup in the blender. When the soup is hot, it will expand faster and shoot all over the place! Can turn a cooking experience into a hospital visit.

It is exellent soup. Few alterations: broiled tomato instead of tomato paste, and broiling leek instead of sauteeing it. To cook from Montreal - the eggplant can be bitter if a) it was not cooked enough or b) some of the peel remained or c) you didn't rinse it well as it was advised in the receipt.

I always wonder when I see one bad review among many, but this time I have to be the one to dissent. Although I admit I am not a huge fan of eggplant I thought I should give this recipe a try since it was so well reviewed by other cooks. I was so disappointed! I found this soup was very bitter tasting and had a stringy texture. In an effort to save the meal I added two cobs of sweet corn,a cup of milk and a tablespoon of sugar, which helped alleviate the bitterness. In the future I will stick to my old favourite, roasted red pepper soup.

I don't like soup, but this is the best I've had. It was a fair amount of time to spend, but the result was well worth it. I also only used have the butter and it was super-good. I also subsituted two orange peppers for two red. I don't think that made a difference, but a great soup regardless. I just made it last night and look forward to having it again.

This has become one of my favorite soup recipes! It's easy to make and tastes so good! I omitted the butter when I made it and don't think the soup suffered at all because of it. Try this recipe!

This really is for bell pepper fans. I loved the soup as is. Well, I used more onions and no leeks and omitted the butter at the end. If more eggplant flavor is wanted, than the proportions of eggplant to bell pepper should probably be inversed. I used dried herbs and added them with the broth. In summer, I'll try fresh herbs and I think this might work as a cold soup, too.

Rating: 3
Great soup! It was surprisingly rich and filling. The only changes I made were at they very end...I only added about half the butter called for and used a little less lime juice (instead of lemon because that is all I had on hand). Served it with fresh bread and a light side salad. Wonderful dinner!

Delicious if you are a roasted red pepper fan. Tasted just as good before the butter was added, will omit next time. Also, I used the juice of a whole lemon but will only use half next time.

I served this soup to the Mrs. and my mom. We all loved it. I would definitely make the soup again, the only thing I didn't like is I underestimated the total time to make it, takes perhaps 2-1/4 hrs from start to finish. Also I used more onions instead of leeks and it still worked out fine.

Soup got great reviews. Had a fun evening with with an Italian wine tasting followed by an Italian dinner. Since we were rating guests gave the soup a 5 on a 5 point scale as they tried to guess ingredients. Not one could guess eggplant! Since the dinner theme was Italian and the entree was tomato based I omitted the tomato paste called for any yet the first ingredient guessed was tomato! Also increased the leeks and garlic and omitted the butter,lemon juice and Parmesan cheese shavings. A great low cal soup with intense rich nutty flavor. Can't wait to serve it to more friends.

A friend made this recipe for lunch and it was so good I had to repeat it (and I am not a soup lover)! I also thickened the sauce with a bit of tomato paste and put it over pasta as a sauce - delicious.

I thought this was great. In place of most of the stock, I used some liquid from roasting peppers that I had on hand and it really picked up the flavor. I also added some roasted sweet corn after the soup had been blended for some more texture. This soup really needs lots of fine tuning at the end, balancing the acid, sugar, salt, etc... I added some red wine vinegar to pick up the acid, and also some corn syrup to bring out the sweetness. All in all, after some tinkering, a really great soup.

Rating: 3
The whole family loved this soup.I didn't find it to be as involved as others commented. A hand held blender is nessasary when making any blended soup.Char the peppers well before peeling. I might try adding a little more garlic and lemon juice next time. This is a new family favorite.

I seem to be going against the direction of opinion, but I was disappointed with the end result given the amount of work and cost of ingredience. When I got done I had a "soup" that tasted like tomato spaghetti sauce from the jar. I could water down a jar of spaghetti sauce and get the same flavor. Then again, if one looks at the ingredience it almost is spaghetti sauce save for the eggplant and red peppers, both of which are cousins of the tomato. In fact, I am going to reduce it just a little and use it as a spaghetti sauce tonight.

Wonderful! I didn't have any chicken broth (I used 1/2 vegetable broth and 1/2 bouillon), only two red peppers and no basil, and it still turned out delicious! My kids ate every last drop--that's the real test! Goes great with a green salad and crusty garlic breat. A definite keeper.

I would omit the butter at the end at use a bit less of the thyme.

Excellent! I added some yellow crook neck squash as I had some. I also did not peel the eggplant OR run it under water after being cooked. I consider it extra steps and work that isn't necessary. Also, instead of batching into the blender, I simply used a hand held mixer into the pot. *Less dishes to clean etc. I also used lime juice versus lemon (I have a very producing lime tree in the yard), and I added a bit more lime juice then called for, as I like it. Anyway, I'll definately be adding this to my soup collection and look forward to making it again soon.

While the soup is labor intensive, it is worth the effort for special occassions. The color is beautiful. I made the day before and I would recommend that. Next time I would reduce the tomato paste or omit it entirely.

I made this soup for a dinner party and everyone loved it. My husband was skeptical when he saw it cooking, but was very impressed with the finished product. It became rich colored, thick and delicious after pureeing. I made it a day in advance and rewarmed it for the party.

A lovely, rich-tasting soup. It benefited greatly from more lemon juice (at least a whole lemon's worth) and salt. I must say that eggplants roasted this way cannot be cut into chunks--I merely scooped the gloppy contents out of the halves and chopped it coarsely on a board.

This soup is relatively easy to make - I added parmesan croutons as well. I also added more leeks for flavor.
