This recipe is similar to Georges Perrier's Souffle Glace Grand Marnier (in Le Bec-Fin Recipes), altho I think his version is more foolproof. Instead of heating egg yolks, he makes sugar syrup and slowly adds that to the yolks while beating in a mixer. You can't miss - it's a stunning dessert, easy to make ahead. His is one big souffle dusted w/ cocoa and complemented by a tart raspberry coulis.

Amazing! I followed another reviewers suggestion by doubling the recipe and putting it in a graham cracker crust. I also made a strawberry/blackberry sauce to go on top... it was delicious! The souffle is very fluffy and light and has a strong but not overpowering citrus flavor.

Fairly easy to make; my problem was whisking over the hot water while trying not to brake the thermometer. Substituted Grand Marnier with Baileys, reducing by1/3 the amount of whipping cream, and it was very good.

I doubled this recipe and used a 9" springform pan with a graham cracker crust. I also replaced the water with more Grand Marnier to increase the flavor. It's best when just frozen enough to cut into slices, but not frozen hard. Served with the chocolate sauce and raspberries, it received raves from my guests.

This is a very rich dessert. It tasted like ice-cream. Flavor was good but a little too rich. I used the regular size ramekins and made four servings. I had enough to go over the rim but it was too much for one serving. It was easy to make but I probably wouldn't make it again.

This recipe took longer to make than I anticipated. Waiting for the egg mixture to reach 140 degrees took much longer than ten minutes!.What annoyed me most is that I did not have enough to make four servings as depicted in photo. Nobody else mentioned this . There is no way this amount could fill the dishes above the rim!!

I added more Grand Marnier to the recipe--everyone raved about it. I made raspberry sauce (bought frozen sweetened raspberries, whirled them in the food processor, then strained them)and put it and the chocolate sauce in squeeze bottles to decorate the plate and squeeze on top. Delicious.

I served this for a dinner party and was disappointed. The grand marnier flavor was subtle at best. I also did not get the number of servings the recipe said I would so I had to make another batch.

This souffle was great! I tripled the recipe for a large dinner party and skipped the sauce (dusted with high quality chocolate). The servings were rather large, so I thought next time I would made it in a large souffle mould and scoop out servings. A great make-ahead dessert!

Not what I expected, but very, VERY good! The souffle was rich, creamy, smooth. I used masking tape to hold foil in place. I wisked a Tablespoon of Grand Marnier into the bittersweet chocolate sauce before serving.
