Super yummy! I loved this recipe. I used a couple mashed bananas in the oatmeal portion of the recipe and used a combo of wheat germ and flax. I also added about 2/3 to 1 cup of milk. Thanks for sharing this!

Excellent taste and hearty, but added 1/2 c. milk, otherwise it would have been too thick, almost like cookie dough.

Have made this recipe over and over again, everyone loves it, but the pancakes are FILLING!, you want to eat more but can't fit them in!

Sheesh, talk about thick batter! It was more like a dough. I first added 1/2 cup water to thin it out, then added 1/2 cup milk to get it to more of a pancake batter consistency. Cut back on the sugar as other reviewers noted. I also added some vanilla and baking soda to help it spread out. Overall tastes great, however, I like other pancake recipes on this site much better.

I made this recipe looking for a pancake version of oatmeal raisin cookies. It's a winner! I used raisins as the fruit and ground flax for wheat germ. De-lish.

These were good on their own but GREAT when served with the Caramel Pear Butter recipe on this site. I made a few changes...left out wheat germ (but next time will replace it with ground pecan meal), cut the butter to 4 Tbsp, cut the brown sugar to 1/3 cup, added 1/2 c. buttermilk, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and 1/4 tsp. cloves. Used diced fresh pears as the fruit. Very yummie but not a recipe for a busy morning.

I made these for breakfast this morning and my entire family LOVED them. I couldn't believe it; they were all absolutely raving. I made them with diced banana and added some blueberries to a few -- no one needed any syrup because they were plenty sweet enough (and that was with cutting back on the brown sugar as suggested). I also left out the wheat germ because I didn't have it on hand. Can't wait to make them again!

We liked the texture, thickness and flavor of these pancakes - delicious! However, they were way, way too sweet. I would definitely cut back on the sugar next time (maybe half or less). Also, I used chopped apples in mine and I cooked them with the oatmeal before adding to the batter.

Ugh. Too sweet. Too heavy. Too thick. Ugh.

The batter was way too thick...I had to add over 1/2 cup of water. They didn't cook very evenly (maybe mine were too big)...many were undercooked no matter how long they sat in the pan.

These were really really tasty. I give them only three stars because, as other reviewers said, the batter was going to be too dry as the recipe is written. I added 1/2 c. buttermilk and it worked wonderfully. When I make these again I will try cutting back on the sugar. A whole cup is a lot, and I think when eaten with maple syrup cutting back to 3/4 or 2/3 c would work fine.

We really liked these pancakes - and they are a little like "oatmeal cookies". They are very hearty and thick and taste wonderful! I skipped the wheat germ since I did not have any and added my diced apples towards the end of cooking the oatmeal (to insure the apples would get soft). Delicious!

Instead of adding extra milk i scaled the flour down to 1 cup instead of 1 1/3 cups. The pancakes were quite moist.

Excellent! And for my changes... I reduced the sugar and added raisins for the full oatmeal cookie taste. Also went with a 1/2 c soy milk because the batter was a bit dry. Thoroughly devoured in my house.

Absolutely wonderful. Seriously, devine. I did omit the nutmeg and double the cinnamon. Amazing.

Made this recipe twice now and everyone loved it. Didn't use wheat germ either time. First time we added bananas and second time blueberries. Both were tasty, but I prefer bananas.

The flavor is spectacular. This was fast and easy and made an excellent weeknight dinner. The children loved it as well-which is a big plus.

This is awesome!! My kids and husband loved it. It was a little bit dry, but we just put a little bit of milk in (not much, just about a half of a cup) to make it more water-y :)

followed other reviewers and added 1 c. buttermilk- made it too soupy! next time will add 1/2 c. Also added bananas and choc. chips- nothing can be bad w/ those!!

My young kids loved these! I love what is in them! I would suggest scooping out only 1/4 c batter so they cook more thoroughly (batter is very thick) I used chopped up apples and banana's. Wonderful!

Rating: 2
tasty, but not fantastic. I divided the batter into 3 bowls and added blueberries to one, banana to one and I left the third one plain. All three were good, but my favourite was blueberry. I will make this again, but I am not in a rush to.

I used a little less than a cup of milk to thin it out. it was delicious! I put apples, bananas, and raspberries as the fruit. I will make this again and again!

These were wonderful, even my reluctant husband, who has a preference for the traditional pancake recipes, conceded that point. I took note of the comments from the other cooks and omitted the wheat germ because it is something that I don't generally keep on hand. I also added 3 tbsp. of buttermilk to thin the batter a bit. As previously noted these are not light and airy, but thick and filling. Next time may add about a 1/4 cup of crushed nuts. This is not something to fix if you are in a hurry, but it is wonderful for a leisurely weekend breakfast or brunch. Would definitely make them for guests.

Delicious! I added ground flax seed instead of wheat germ. I also subbed chocolate chips for the fruit --so, it was kind of like a giant chocolate chip cookie. A decadent breakfast!

A great, hearty pancake recipe - thick and filling rather than airy. Didn't have wheat germ, and added about 1/2 cup extra water to the batter because it was too thick to spread. Worked great with jam for brunch.

These were great, but in my opinion, you definitely need to add milk. They were the consistency of very thick porridge before I did so. I served them with fresh blackberries and left out the dried fruit. Delightful.

These are delicious! I didn't have wheat germ, so I just left that part out. Also, I only had about a cup of flour on hand. The consistency was perfect.

There seems to be missing a liquid ingredient from this recipe. I had to add quite a bit of milk to get the consistency thin enough to spread on the griddle. The flavor is delicious and hearty.

I made the recipe as is, and the batter was much thicker than normal pancake batter. Don't worry though they come out nicely. I used a ripe banana and cut the recipe in half. These taste much better than a plain old pancake and are high in fiber! Due to the thicker batter, I think these taste a lot better if they are fresh off the griddle. If you keep them heated in the oven they seemed a little too dry.

The pancakes were very hearty and needed added (3 Tb) water to the final batter. I added chopped (2) apples vs dried fruit and they were very good.
