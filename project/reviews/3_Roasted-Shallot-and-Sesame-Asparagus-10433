I really liked this one. I did follow other reviewer's suggestions of adding more lemon, and was pleased with the result. It was really tangy and delicious!

This was quite good. The shallot complemented asparagus in a way I did not expect. The first time I made this, I used a wedge's worth of lemon juice and felt it didn't do much. The second time, I added a generous amount and the dish was even better. Try it!

My husband hates vegetable, but even he ate this. It was extremely simple to make, and I thought it was very tasty.

I used very thin asparagus and substituted walnut crumbs for the sesame seeds. A nice, delicate taste, though I would suggest a very quick sauté for the shallots before adding to the asparagus.

We made this side dish for Easter dinner and we were a little disappointed because it lacked something. The recipe sounds really delicious and simple, but it just didn't come together like we thought it would. Next time we think we would add some sesame oil and soy sauce to it.

the cooking time is too long, but reducing the cooking time by half or more, depending upon the thickness of asparagus improves it. I also added balsamic vinegar or soy sauce to the oil and marinated it for 30 minutes for added flavor.
