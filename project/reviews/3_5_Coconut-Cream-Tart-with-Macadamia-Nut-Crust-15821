haven't made the tart, but I use the crust for the "spirited brown sugar pecan pie" recipe on this site. It is awesome and gets rave reviews! You can make it gluten free too!

I had a hard time with the filling on this recipe. Despite my cooking it on very low heat and stirring constantly the eggs kept cooking, giving the custard a grainy texture. I tried it twice and it came out the same way both times. The flavor was fine but I wouldn't make this again.

Yum!! Delicious coconut flavor and silky texture. My tart pan is only 7" so I adjusted the filling accordingly. I didn't adjust the amount of crust because (thought I) wouldn't that make a tasty biscuit? I rolled the leftover crust into a log, cut 1/2" slices and baked. The bisuits were delicious and tender. Then my husband took the biscuits and slathered them with nutella - OMG! It's all good.

This is a great dessert. I loved the crust and the light texture. It makes a great presentation too.

This was a nice dessert. Very light. Not spectacular. I used a 9" instead of an 11" pan however, and so the actually custard portino was rather shallow considering the abkundance of crust. I substituted pecans for macadamias,s till very good though more work than I like for such an average dessert.

The crust is delicious and really makes the dish

I followed the advice and toasted the coconut. It made a beautiful presentation. I will make it again for sure. I used lower-fat coconut milk and had no trouble with it setting or the taste. I would reccommend anyone trying this. My guests loved it.

I was not wild about this recipe. Though the taste of the custard was ok, the texture was grainy. That may well have been my fault. I also did not care too much for the crust. This recipe took a lot of work without yielding very great results.

This receipe was easy to prepare and very impressive to present. I agree with one of the other reviews in that next time I will toast the coconut. It looks pretty with it un-toasted but I prefer the texture of toasted coconut. I also used a springform pan instead of the tart pan (didn't have one) but this turned out great. I made the crust go all the way up the sides, about an inch higher than the filling. It was fabulous looking. I will definitely make this again but do to the calories etc of this dish, probably only once or twice a year. Enjoy!

I just love this recipe!!! I'll tell you something about the rum, the flavor is not really that strong. For me insted, of the run i would used a some Grand Menier or someother licuor.

This recipe was disappointing .... but salvagable. The gelatin ruined the creaminess of the filling and should be either cut by 2/3 or cut completely. The toasting time for the nuts is too long. Ruined my first batch of nuts because I trusted the recipe and set the timer(expensive lesson).

whatever you do, don't use reduced fat coconut cream. It was all I could get and the filling did not set. I was stuck so I froze the cake and served it. I found it had almost no flavour. Perhaps that had to do with the cream.

WOW! Mmmmmm - yummy - decadent - sublime. I could go on and on. With some vanilla ice cream on the side - your eyes will surely roll back into your head. This is just perfect and lucious and living in Maui macadamia nuts are one of our main food groups. We've had a slice for dessert for the past three nights and it keeps getting better. Calories, fat - who cares - enjoy it! Super easy to make too : )

To be short and sweet I like just about anything with macadamia nuts.

I didn't make this recipe yet, but was wondering from those who did, do you have to use rum? I'm not a big fan of rum and would like to leave it out, but wasn't sure what to substitute instead. Any ideas?

I made this recipe for co-workers and they raved and raved about it. It was easy to prepare, made a nice presentation (I used a springform pan rather than a tart pan), and tasted heavenly.

At first I wasn't sure this tart would solidify. After refrigerating overnight, that changed! This tart turned out to be one of my best dessert productions (even thought I am relatively new to the fattening dessert making category). It's a definate recipe file keeper.

Besides being a guaranteed "hardening of the arteries" per slice, this tart was exceptional. Very rich, very filling, excellent served with a strong cup of coffee. I made one minor change in that I toasted the coconut...this was just a taste preference. It was a huge hit with our company...but I didn't let them know it contained over a cup of coconut milk, 10 egg yolks, heavy cream and a cube of butter. Some things are better left unsaid. Indulge in this tart once a year and don't feel guilty...life is short.

This recipe is so easy but looks very elegant. I don't like desserts that are too sweet. This one definitely falls within that requirement. Enjoy!
