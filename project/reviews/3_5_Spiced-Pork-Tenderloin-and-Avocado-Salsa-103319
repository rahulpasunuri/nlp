This is fabulous! My husband and I love spice however I would highly recommend removing the seeds from jalapenos in the pineapple-avocado salsa or reducing the cayenne as the two are a bit overwhelming. Looking forward to preparing for dinner guests.

I made this for me and my boyfriend and only made one tenderloin. I'm not a big fan of sauces or a lot of flavour on my meat, but my boyfriend is. However, we both loved the meat. And I love that it's easy to make.

The seasoning amongst my guests recieved varied reviews. Those that enjoyed spicy food enjoyed the pork. Those that did not like spicy foods found the rub too imposing. The pork in and of itself was cooked to perfection and my guests were surprised at how tender the meat was. The avocado salsa is a decent complement to the spicyness of the rub. Will cook again.

I didn't like the rub - way too much cayenne, though I used the same amount of rub for only 2# of tenderloin so that may have been why. In any case, the flavor was just nothing exceptional. No one liked the salsa much, either, and I followed that recipe exactly. I won't make this again.

My Boyfriend went crazy for the pork... he ran out the next day and bought me 3 more tenderloins.

This was excellent...I made the pork with the salsa and fried some corn tortiallas for some delicious homemade chips. Fabulous meal...I feel sorry for all the previous cooks who thought 2.5 Tablespoons of sea salt would be equal to 2.5 Tablespoons of table salt...leave out the salt if you have no course salt. I used canned pineapple and would love to try it with fresh next time.

This dish was so easy. The rub was delicious on the pork (we used a tad less kosher salt), the meat was sooo tender, and the salsa complemented the meat perfectly. I was worried that my husband wouldn't like the salsa because he's a manly "no fruit with meat" guy, but he loved it and thought it was restaurant quality. For just two of us, I used only one tenderloin, but made the whole recipe of salsa. We ate *all* of the salsa (used it liberally w/ the meat, and broke out a bag of tortilla chips to finish it). I would probably double the salsa recipe if I was making this for 6 people.

Great dish! I've made it 4 times. As far as the salt it wasn't too much for us except the time that I subbed table salt for the coarsley ground sea salt. Sea salt is the key. As for the salsa delicious! Served the left overs with chips the next day.

This dish was very delicious, however I agree with other reviewers that the rub was too salty. We cooked our pork on the grill, which turned out really nice. I didn't have pineapple for the salsa, so I substituted mango, and also added cilantro. It was great. Will definitely make this again and try it with pineapple.

Very tasty and easy; also, good for entertaining because you can make the salsa a few hours in advance, adding the avocado just before serving, and the pork also is ok if made a little while in advance, slice just before serving. Our guests loved it, and most had second helpings

I have never rated a recipe this highly, but it has been a show-stopper for me many times. I sometimes BBQ the pork on a very hot grill, other times cook as directed. The salsa, with fresh ingredients is particularly wonderful with the meat, but is good on anything.

Rating: 2
It's interesting to read these reviews to see how people's taste buds differ. I thought the tenderloin and rub was quite good. The salsa, on the other hand, didn't do much for me. Maybe a more traditional tomato based salsa? I don't know...will have to play with this one.

I made this recipe for our annual garden party pot luck and it was a huge success. The salsa was wonderful and provided a sweet tangy contrast to the spicy pork. The prep time for the salsa is closer to an hour for all the slicing & dicing.

This recipe has become a regular in our house--it's so easy. I also make a mango salsa, which really complements the spicy rub.

This is so easy and so delicious! I've made it twice now, and would suggest making extra paste for the rub. I added a bit extra cayenne pepper for a little more heat, which is perfectly complimented by the pineapple/avocado salsa. Be sure to sure fresh pineapple in the salsa. I also used the same spice rub and salsa with grilled salmon and served over a bed of wild rice pilaf. Awesome!

I've made this several times and has become my wifes favorite. Cut back on the allspice and your good to go.

Great recipe! As suggested, I cut down on the amount of salt in the rub. My taste buds prefer hot, spicy foods and was pleased at the heat level of the pork. It was spicy enough to please me but not too hot to offend others. Loved the salsa and have used it since with other dishes.

As others said, cut waaaay back on salt. Also, I will make this again but going to half the cayenne next time. It turned out to be a blackened tenderloin. The allspice was perfect. Great salsa!!!

Delicous, exotic and easy. I cut down on the salt and skewered the pork for the BBQ. Tasted great. The salsa is a must for this dish. So easy!

This is a fabulous dish, especially with the help from the others who reviewed it. I took the advice to cut down on the salt and the rub was delicious. I modified the salsa, grilling the pineapple and onions, adding some diced red peppers and garlic with the jalapenos and skipped the avocado and tomato altogether since i didnt think they would add so much. i served it with cornbread stuffing and potatoes.

Excellent and Easy Dish. Great for weeknight dinners. Salsa was excellent, but taste before seasoning. I found salt was unnecessary.

delicious. but oven cooking time was way too long. after browning, only needed 7-10 minutes in a 400 oven. salsa is delicious also.

Delicious recipe -- the pork comes out tender every time. It's spicy enough to please my boyfriend, who likes things hot, but not too spicy -- just the way I like it. Be sure to use coarse (Kosher) salt in the rub -- using table salt makes the rub way too salty. (~2 tsp. seems like a good amount.) The salsa is incredible.

Rating: 3
WAY, way too salty. Try using 2 teaspoons of salt, we had to wash the rub off after cooking. Otherwise the pork was wonderful, moist and perfect. The salsa was a perfect compliment to the spicyness of the pork.

Rating: 2
I found that the rub for the pork was too salty; I would definitely fix this again (meat was fork tender & even better cold than hot) but wil use considerably less salt. the salsa accompaniment is a 4 forker. We served this with long-wild rice mix and steamed broccoli. Great meal.

Rating: 4
Wonderful. Would make again and the salsa gave a nice balance to the spicy pork. My friend said that she doesn't care for real hot and would use a bake and shake the meat in the bag and not press the remainder spices into the meat. Nice idea, but I like it hot.

The dry rub was perfect - just the right spice. I used mango instead of pineapple in the salsa with no other variations...WOW!!! I will serve this to guests in the future.

This is an equally unique and scrumptious meal to serve to family or guests. The avocado salsa with cilantra and pineapple added an aromatic flavour to this tasty dish. I received compliments from guests and my boyfriend. If you don't have time to use fresh pineapple, I found the canned type delicious.

This dish was OK. I have never done a dry rub for tenderloin before and realize now that I don't particularly care for it. I think the pork would be better if marinated all day or overnite in a soy based marinade (such as soy, olive oil, green onions, cumin, asian chili paste, etc.). I think it would be jucier and more tender. Ours was tough and dry. (Maybe we just purchased a bad tenderloin?) The salsa was good, but I have to admit that there is another pineapple salsa on this website that is better: "July 1999, Bon Apetit, Grilled Shrimp with Pineapple Salsa". In that recipe, the pineapple is grilled first before chopping and adding the other ingredients, and I think that makes the difference. I would rather make that recipe, adding the avocado to it. I think you could add the tomato if you want a more vibrant color, but I'm not sure they add much to the flavor of the salsa. With those revisions, I would make this again.

This recipe was awesome. My whole family loved it. It was very easy too!

Great and easy recipe. I loved the variety of flavors that would appear with each bite of salsa. My only recommendation is to use less allspice and/or more cayenne on the rub. The rub needs to be spicier, not sweeter. The salsa, which is excellent, provides more than enough sweet. Will make this again for sure!

The family really liked this, especially the salsa. Seemed like too much salt in the rub for the tenderloin. Easy recipe.

Rating: 2
While the pork tenderloin was good, I thought the spices were a bit harsh and they didn't really complement the salsa. The salsa was also kind of bland so I added black ground pepper to try and give it more flavor. Overall, the meal was ok but there are better pork tenderloin dishes out there. I recommend the one with the cherry salsa -- yummy!

Weighing in the on the question of how much salt and spice, I made this for four instead of six (so that would be two tenderloins, not three) and used a teaspoon of cayenne, a tablespoon of salt and a tablespoon of Chinese five-spice (I was all out of allspice). The verdict: just right. I made a full recipe of the yummy salsa which completely disappeared. A very nice meal.

This is a great and fast recipe for pork. We used the rub on chops instead and it turned out great. The salsa recommended is wonderful as well. Great for summer nights!

Excellent recipe - easy to make. I too would cut down the cayenne pepper. I followed the recipe, and even though I like hot, spicy food - this was too hot. I'll try it again cutting the cayenne in half. The salsa was delicious and complimented the pork. I can't wait to make it again.

A wonderful taste sensation. I cut back on the Cayenne pepper to a scant 1/2 TBS and found it to be spicy but not overpowering. The salsa was a wonderful complement to the pork and my guests raved about it but still said to cut back on the Cayenne pepper next time.

This is the best recipe I've found on Epicurious yet. My wife doesn't like spicy food, so I cut the cayenne down to 1/2 tsp. I couldn't taste it at all, but she thought it was a little spicy. I also used boneless pork chops, with excellent results. The salsa lifts this one above the competition!

This dish was easy for a novice cook. It was a great combination of spicy with the cool ingredients of the salsa. Even those who don't like a lot of spice loved it. Everyone I have made this for has wanted the recipe. Delicious!

I couldn't believe the amount of salt in the recipe, but tried it anyway, and it was fantastic. You definitely hae to have the salsa with it as it completely takes away the salty flavour of the rub. I like the cayenne spice with the cool salsa as well!

This dish was so wonderful! Make it with the pineapple salsa and it's a perfect summer meal. You can make it spicy or mild, whatever you prefer. Next time, I'll cut it into smaller pieces and serve it as an appetizer.

Given the salty and cayenne complaints, I didn't have really high hopes BUT it's turned into a favorite around our house. The first time we made it, we stuck to the recipe, the second time, the only changed we made was added a bit more onion to the salsa. Caveat emptor: both my wife and I like hot food

The amount of cayenne in this recipe is way too much. I think 1 teaspoon would be plenty. This is coming from someone who loves spicy dishes. The cayenne overpowered the dish. All in all it was a good dish. The salsa was excellent and a great accompaniment to the pork.

Rating: 2
The allspice in the recipe is a good complement to the pork. There is, however, WAY too much salt in it. The pork is really an easy dish to make and can be done in less than 45 mintues. If I do this recipe again I will definitely decrease the amount of salt and probably decrease the amount of Cayenne too. I like spicy food, but this was almost too much. Between the excess salt and the strong flavors of both the allspice and the cayenne the flavor of the pork gets lost. A little less of all 3 would probably be a better enhancement for the pork. Also, I needed a little more than the amount of oil called for in the recipe during the browing.
