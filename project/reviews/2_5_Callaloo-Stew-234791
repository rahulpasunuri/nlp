I cannot say anything about authenticity. There is a place near my house that makes fantastic greens in a "callaloo style" that I was hoping to imitate. This is not that recipe. In fact, this recipe is outright strange. I tried the suggestion below to blend everything together, you get this weird green slime. Maybe I used too much okra? I don't know and never will know because this recipe is a one timer.

As a native Trinidadian, I'm quite familiar with both the traditional callaloo AND its less viscous counterpart, callaloo soup. This recipe doesn't claim to be either of those things, but it contains almost all of the same ingredients (or their more easily obtained North American equivalents). It may not be authentic, but it's certainly quite delicious!

I totally agree with the Trinidadian from L.A. Callaloo is not a Soup or Stew. It is just Callalo. Please don't not alter our Native dishes this way. Another Trini from Los Angeles

I thought this was delicious, I don't care how authentic it is or not. I mis-read the ingredients and made the mistake of using 2 scotch bonnets instead of just 1/2 of one, and man was it HOT !! So I added some coconut cream to mellow it out. Even with the heat, we loved it. I used swiss chard as the green, and butternut squash, and added a kilo of shrimp. My only real complaint is that by the second day, the squash and the okra had all pretty much dissolved, so I didn't get the chunky effect I was expecting. The flavor was still awesome, though. I would definitely make it again.

This was delicious, however I had the true Callaloo Soup in Aruba a few weeks ago while on a Royal Caribbean cruise, and it was a "dish to die for!" The cooks in Aruba used Okra, Spinach, Pork, Shrimp, and some "mystery" spices, to create their soup. When served, it looked a mess but was absolutely wonderful. So, when I saw this recipe I had to make it. I used spinach, shrimp and crab and okra, etc. It was green and gooey and wonderful. But, I believe if you don't like okra and spinach much in the first place you aren't going to enjoy Callaloo. This recipe needs some tweeking..and I will work on it...but it was good and I would make the Callaloo Soup again. I was very surprised to see it here when I looked it up. Most people have never heard of it. I bought two cookbooks just to get the recipe ~~ that's how much I loved it.

We made this stew for our Carribean themed gourmet club dinner last night. I was assigned to make it or I never would have picked it given the previous reviews. I was pleasantly surpised. It was delicious! I used spinach leaves and Kabocha squash (Japanese pumpkin). Pumpkin is out of season right now, but the Kabocha was sweet and delicious in this. The Habanero added a nice punch.

I saw this recipe in BA Magazine, and decided to look for the ingredients at the farmers mkt. I found a bunch of what looked like taro leaves for sale for $1. I asked the Hmong farmer what they were and she said "they are whatever you want them to be". Then I asked (foolishly) are they taro leaves? and she said "YES! taro leaves!". The stew would have been better with crab, but the leaves tasted odd, and nobody would eat the okra,and my husband doesn't like pumpkin, so I offered it to my dogs and they wouldn't eat it either.

No decent Trinidadian cook will make callaloo this way. Where is the crab?

I AM A WEST INDIAN (TRINIDAD) THIS RECIPE WILL BE BETTER IF AT THE END ALL THE VEGETABLES ARE BLENDED
