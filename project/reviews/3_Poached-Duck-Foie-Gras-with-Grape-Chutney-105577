This one takes a lot of work ... if you are looking to impress cultured guests give it a shot if you can find quality foie gras. The basic sauce preportions are great ! My recommendations: Sear livers in non-stick pan with wipe of oil, the sauce is delicate and is better thickened (arrowroot) as opposed to burned reducing, instead of bread, serve w/ toasted brioche and gingerbread cake slices, also throw a couple of fresh berries with grape chutney. The combination of these flavors are sublime .. but it takes a lot of work. The best I've had was in Lyon, but this rates ! Would love to hear how others have done w/ this along with recommendations. I would love to perfect a foie gras recipe !
