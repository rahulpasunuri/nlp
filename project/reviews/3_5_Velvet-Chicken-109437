I coddled a two- pound bird per the instructions and it was still bloody raw. Went out and bought a proper cast-iron pot from Canadian Tire. This one is going to hold the heat!

I will make this again. The star anise made the flavor for me. The flavors really get through the chicken.

This is not a company dish due to the floppy skin you must discard, but it was absolutely delicious. The dark meat was out of this world. The breast meat was a tad less tender, but a little sauce spooned over made it perfect. The sauce is very rich with all that chicken fat. I have a feeling the yellow rock sugar is a must--it was a very different taste than brown sugar. (I had to use pale dry sherry and regular peppercorns, though--still great.) As far as the salt level, I used low sodium soy, did not add the extra spoon of salt, and used my own homemade almost no-salt chicken broth. It could have tolerated a little more salt the way I made it. Another reviewer said he or she would rather cook a chicken in a way that one could use leftovers in different dishes, but you can totally use these leftovers--chinese chicken salad!

I may try this again but It was WAY too salty and not at all velvet in texture. Mine was not cooked but i think the bird was closer to four lbs. Boring and too salty!

I would like to add to my recent review that this sauce is very versatile! I have used it to poach thin slices of boneless chicken breast and they remained very tender and picked up flavor. I added sauteed mushroom, onions and green pepper and served this with noodles. The sauce is also great to add to plain rice and serve as a side dish.

Easy and delicious! We enjoyed the exotic mix of flavors. I omitted the salt and added 4 medium crushed garlic cloves. My bird weighed just over 4 pounds so I simmered it for 25 minutes instead of the recommended 15 minutes. It was cooked perfectly, still moist and tender. I froze the left over poaching liquid and will use that again next week.

Oh, this dish totally rocks. We loved it over Jasmine rice, with pan-fried asparagus. The chicken was beautifully colored, tenderly textured, wonderfully flavorful and fully cooked through. We used a 3.1 lb Kosher chicken and ALL the other ingredients, following the procedure exactly. And don't forget to munch on the orange zest strips after! We will definitely make this again ... and soon!

Not bad, but I think if I'm short of time, I'd rather just poach a chicken and have chicken for salads and sandwiches as well as a handy chicken stock at the end of it all. Not that impressive.

I made this without the chiles and star anise (my whole foods didn't carry the latter and I skipped the former because my daughter is sensitive to spicy foods), it was terrific. Like other reviewers, I was nervous about only cooking it 15 (my chicken was 4 pounds) and so I had the fire on simmer most of the time, which may have made it a bit less tender, but it was still so moist and good. I would omit the salt, it's not needed. My son (8) found it salty, but ate well. My daughter (5) who is harder to please LOVED it and ate more than her brother. We had it over rice with green beans. I started cooking later than I should have and so dinner was late, but this could be a good dish to have on hand as it is rather easy.

This is delicious. It tastes like comfort food, Cantonese style.

so easy and so tasty! I will make again but will skip the extra salt - it was just a touch too much. A squeeze of lime over the meat at the end gave a fresh taste and balanced the sweetness. Serve it with stir-fried sesame rice and green beans. mmmm

I made this last night and both my husband and I loved it! I couldn't find the Anise Star...it probably flies by every 76 years. I took the advice of one of the users to simmer 15 minutes on both sides then let sit for half an hour. Next time I may leave the burner on warm as the chicken could of used a little more cooking time. I'm going to stir fry the left-overs as another one of the users suggested. My husband said this one's a keeper!

My family's favorite Chinese chicken dish. Be sure to save the sauce, freeze and reuse. Better flavor each time. Called Velvet Chicken for a good reason; the meat is velvety tender.

This was really good, though a bit salty. I will cut down on the soy sauce next time. Great with steamed brown rice.

To Meryl in Alpharetta, if you go to Whole Foods/Harry's Farmer's market and look in their dried spices you will quickly find star anise.

A big hit and definitely a keeper. I also extended the cooking time based on the reviews I read for a whole chicken. Simmered for 15 minutes each side, turned off heat and left for 15 minutes on each side. Came out perfectly cooked. Flavor was equivalent to a good chinese restaurant. Froze the strained cooking liquid for next time!

I've made this several times. The first time, I used a whole chicken, but it did not cook through in the time allotted. I had to extend the cooking time by at least another half hour. Since then, I've always cut the chicken into quarters and removed the skin. The chicken has always come out moist and flavorful. It is a HUGE hit with my family! We searched more places than you could imagine for star anise and were never able to find it. Even without that ingredient, this dish is simply delish!

I LOVE this recipe!! I make the sauce and keep it in the freezer and use it as needed. Instead of using a whole chicken I use frozen chicken breasts and just throw them in the hot liquid then I take them out when they are tender and slice them up and throw them in a stir fry pan with sweated onions and red and orange peppers. When everything is tender I add some of the liquid and serve over rice!! It sounds like a lot of work but it really isn't. I am a working mom and this recipe is one of my old standards!

As a note to previous reviewer who suggested using cut-up chicken - it completely ruins the dish. The key to this simple recipe is the tender chicken, which comes from cooking the chicken whole.

Not a good recipe. Like boiled chicken.

I was very skeptical about making this, as I was afraid the chicken would be too undercooked. I was unable to find star anise, and I did not have any cloves, but I followed the recipe (except for those two ingredients) to the letter. The chicken around the thigh bone was still a little pink, so I cut the chicken apart and simmered it all for 15 more minutes. It was incredible! My family absolutely loved it! Next time, I'll remove the skin from the chicken and cut it into parts before I cook it. I might also add some onion (besides the scallion) and some green pepper. This was definitely a hit, and I'll be making this again -- SOON!

This recipe was instructive in that it taught me an easy way to cook a whole chicken in one hour. The chicken meat was tender and juicy, but the flavor didn't knock me out like some other reviewers. (I had to use sherry, brown sugar, and regular soy sauce.) If you don't already have the ingredients, I don't think it's worth a trip to the supermarket to get them. The chicken broth and soy sauce make up most of the flavor profile. The anise and ginger did make an interesting aroma, but that flavor didn't seem to penetrate into the chicken. Taking a tip from other reviewers, I put the carved pieces under the broiler for a few minutes to make the skin crispier. I froze the remaining broth for later use, but I won't go to the trouble to make this exact broth again in the future.

This dish was not very good. I really didn't like the flavor. I foolowed the recipe exact, however, if I were to make this again, which I won't, I would put the bird in the oven at the end of it's coking time to firm the skin on the bird.

I used low sodium soy sauce. I made it for a small dinner party and it was a HUGE success (easy to make also). I had to beat people off from sucking on the bones!

I found the saltiness of the soy a little strong, which muted the other more interesting flavours in the poaching liquid. Nonetheless, the chicken was tender and aromatic.

I found this to be quite simple to make yet very tasty. I will definitely be making it again.

The chicken in this recipe is very tasty, reminiscent of the flavor of Chinese Peking roasted duck. I agree with other reviews: the skin is inedible (rather flabby), although, the next time I make this (of course using the saved broth), I think I will try to broil the chicken pieces to make crispy. Very good.

A delicious and hassle-free one-dish meal. I've made it twice. The second time, I used the broth I saved from the previous time. Both times tasted very good.

This is an absolutely wonderful dishButthe . I made it with chicken parts , boneless skinless thighs , just perfectly . You can definitely the use the cooking sauce if you keep it frozen between uses . What a fabulous make ahead meal.

I've made this several times now and it is delicious. It's even easier the second time if you store the poaching liquid in the freezer. The only thing I added was to run the chicken under the broiler for a couple of minutes at the end, just to crisp it up a bit.

This was amazing! The flavours are quintessentially Asian - if you don't like Asain flavours then maybe you wouldn't care for it but I LOVED IT! Of course I am especially a fan of star anise flavours. I used sake (in place of sherry) and brown sugar and only light soy sauce and yes I suppose it would be "prettier" if darker but the flavour makes up for light colour and soft skin. (Probably healthier to take skin off anyway?) I can't wait to make this again, and crammed the poaching liquid into my very full freezer so I can soon!

Came out great. I used dry sack sherry and brown sugar. I will make this recipe many more times and recommend it to my friends. I saved the poaching liquid and intend to poach boneless/skinless chix breasts (see Gourmet mag 8/04 issue).

This recipe has already become a favorite! It's so easy, the chicken makes a delicious dinner with steamed rice, a dipping sauce and a veg. I use the leftovers for salads, sandwiches and soups.

Overall this was a nice new way to prepare chinese chicken. Not superb, but good. Next time I will add another chile since the sauce is certainly on the sweet side and I prefer a bit more balance. I liked the new method of preparation, too.

This is the best chicken ever. It cooked perfectly, I forgot to buy a dried red chili, and it was wonderful without it. I used regular soy sauce rather than the dark sauce. My boyfriend thought it was so good that he drank the leftover juice off his plate. I will definetly make this again.

The delicate flavor and succulent texture of the meat was phenomenal. I also don't like wobbly chicken skin, but in this case I don't think you'd want to serve the skin. The meat itself makes up for the crispy skin we usually enjoy with a roasted bird. I will use leftovers as stuffing for gyoza or spring rolls. The clove and anise definitely adds the right backnote to the overall flavor.

This was only so-so. Yes, it was easy to prepare, but I did not think the flavor was anything to brag about. The end product was slippery and the sherry taste was unnoticeable with all that soy sauce.

This recipe is very similar to White Chicken w/Ginger Scallion sauce that you can get in authentic Cantonese restaurants. The previous reviewer is mistaken -- the chicken WILL be cooked through, although it may seem softer and pinker than Westerners are used to. To make White Chicken, use only ginger and scallions in poaching liquid, and serve with a dipping sauce made with minced ginger, sea salt, and minced scallions upon which boiling peanut oil has been poured.

My family wasn't crazy about this recipe. I bought all of the recommended brands/ingredients from a local Asian market and followed the directions exactly. Our chicken wasn't completely cooked around the thigh bone..although the breast meat was very moist and tender.

This recipe is awesome. It is easy (relative). It has a wonderful aroma and much richer flavor than the ones sold at a chinese barbeccue shop. My wife, a picky eater, loves it. I will never buy another chicken from a commercial barbeccue shop again. My finished product did not have a nice presentation as the one in the picture. The skin around the breast area sort of melted apart and the colors near the thigh area was not quite evenly coated. But, we enjoyed the chicken. We like our chicken a little more well done in our household. So for the next time, I might simmer the chicken for another extra 3-5 minutes more.

The many ingredients in this poaching liquid make for a delicious well balanced sauce. After poaching the chicken I cut in half and broiled it for just a minute or two to crisp up the skin (we don't like wiggly chicken skin). The color was a deep amber. Served with Black rice and peas with shiitake mushrooms it made a delicious and quick dinner. I strained my liquid and froze it as suggested. I think I will try it next with bone in chicken breasts. Fabulous!
