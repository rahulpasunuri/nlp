Very easy and wonderful scones. I used heavy cream instead of buttermilk, which I think was the right choice because they had a nice balance of lightness and moisture. Looking forward to trying this recipe with other dried fruits and nuts. Maybe also with orange juice.

I substituted one cup whole wheat flour for one cup of white flour, and used one full cup of full fat buttermilk. They came out wonderfully moist and delicious!

These were definitely decent but my search for the perfect scone is without a doubt not done. If you prefer a more biscuit-y, cakey scone as I do, this is not the recipe for you. I also found that these were not sweet enough, even with the sugar on the top, and I would add more sugar for sure. The only adjustment I made to this recipe was to substitute one cup of whole wheat flour. My search continues....

These were a very nice scone and I was very pleased with the results! However! I used baking powder, not baking soda. Baking Soda makes a hockey puck.

EASY to make and turned out great, these were my first attempt at scones. Serve with Devonshire cream and jam for a delicious treat with or without tea.

My first attempt at scones! These were very easy to make and looked pretty. I also sprinkled the tops with sugar and baked exactly 18 minutes. I served them with butter but next time will serve with whipped cream and jam. They did need something like that to jazz them up.

Very good. I did the initial dry ingredient-butter mixing in the food processor. I used a whole stick of butter and a little extra sugar. I also sprinkled a little cinnamon sugar on top before baking.

These scones are great--I make them without currants and only bake them for about 15 minutes. I serve them warm with clotted cream and jam, or occasionally with butter and honey. Yummy!

I found this recipe rather bland and dry. I'm glad I served them with butter and jam to give it the extra flavor it needed. Not a keeper.
