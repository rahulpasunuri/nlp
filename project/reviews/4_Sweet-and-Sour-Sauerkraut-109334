If you like the taste of traditional sauerkraut, this recipe is not for you. It changes the flavor of the kraut so that it is almost unrecognizable. I prefer kraut w/onion, mushrooms, small amount tomatoes, and optionally chopped partially cooked bacon, simmered for quite a while.

The best kraut ever! I used the whole spices and followed the recipe precisely... I wasn't sure about the tomatoes, but they just blended right in for a memorable compliment to our New Year's menu. My guests raved right along with me! I'm planning to use it again this year - simply delish!

Easy and good, tried it first on New Year's Day and again tonight. Used powdered spices and reduced the sugar a little from the first time. Having with kielbasa, a keeper!

Made 2 for neighbors - both guys. They each had a second helping and one asked for the recipe. Enough said; it's in the recipe box permanently! (BTW, a 2 lb jar made approx 5 ample servings).

While definitely one of the best versions of sauerkraut I have had, I think maybe I just don't like sauerkraut that much because I much preferred the sauce to the kraut. So I won't rate the recipe, but would say that it was fairly easy to make (used the powdered versions of the spices), and took another reviewer's advice to drain the sauerkraut really well and watch my sugar. Guests seemed to enjoy!

I had leftover sauerkraut and found the recipe to be easy and delicious. I did not find it overly sweet. I used powdered spices but believe the crushed would greatly enhance the dish. Used it the next day for hybrid Reuben sandwiches!

We tried this recipe for the first time on New Years Day. Outstanding! We used ground cumin and allspice instead of the whole version of these spices. We also used fire-roasted whole tomatoes to add an extra layer of flavor. This recipe is a keeper!

This would be better if I rinsed the heck out of the sauerkraut, I guess; bit too sour. Very similar to some recipe I dimly recall from The Joy of Cooking. Next time I go in this direction, I will DEFINITELY add crumbled bacon to balance out some of that vinegar.

Up until I tried this recipe, I never enjoyed sauerkraut, but this was really good! I was very pleasantly surprised to find this little gem.

This is an unusual treatment of a traditional ingredient. I liked the results..as did my children. Definately do this one again

A good dish and an interesting change from the usual sauerkraut. I would be careful with the sugar, checking the taste as you add it. Otherwise, delicious even though I used powdered allspice, not having whole on hand.

Excellent dish even though I couldn't get the recommended whole allspice locally and went with the normal ground grocery store spice. The 30 minute cook time on the onions seemed strange at first, but I loved the carmelized texture the onions took on using the long cook time - don't try to cheat the time on this.

We host an annual Oktoberfest party with our dinner group, beginning outdoors with a variety of grilled wursts, mustards and sauerkrauts. This will go on my permanent menu to add variety to the more traditional German krauts. Very different seasonings, and it's always great to have another make-ahead item.

FANTASTIC! We have been eating sauerkraut recipies all of our lives, but never tried it with tomatoes. It was great!

A new family favorite! Made this as part of the Russian Easter Menu, and even the sauerkraut haters had to admit that it was delicious! I used only 1 Tbsp oil and substituted broth for the remainder. Do make an effort to find whole allspice and crush as directed; Can't duplicate the combination of flavors without it. Smacznego!
