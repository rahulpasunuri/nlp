This is identical to the 128 Cafe appetizer I love! My only complaint is that the two times I've made this my chutney has ended up with a lot of extra liquid in it, which I pour off. Also be careful not to over do the chutney, it can quickly turn to camelized and burn. For this amount of chutney I use 4 bulbs of garlic and two baguettes- so definately cut in half unless this is for a large group.

I'd like to make this, but maybe I'm missing something. HOW MUCH garlic do you roast? I can't see that it's mentioned! Please give me your opinions.

I made this recipe over the weekend as an appetizer for a dinner party for four. This Crostini was a HUGE hit. The combination of flavors of the roasted garlic and apple chutney complimented each other nicely. The chutney itself is full of flavor and texture; sweet yet slightly spiced with the cayenne, ginger and cinnamon which was great with the creaminess of the goat cheese. This is a great recipe. I agree that the recipe makes a lot of chutney, so If only using it for the appetizer, you might want to consider reducing the amount by half. I made the full recipe intending to use some of the chutney over sliced pork tenderloin for dinner tomorrow night. I think it will make a nice accompaniment to the pork. I would highly recommend this recipe!

These are great! I brought them to a work apple/cheese event, and to a wine pairing event and they were a real hit.

We enjoyed this appetizer with friends at 128 Cafe on a visit to Minneapolis/St Paul, and I was delighted to find its recipe on Epicurious. I've made it twice myself to rave reviews. It's the perfect fall hors d'oeuvres! Consider halving the chutney recipe, though, because as others have noted, it makes MUCH more than is needed.

Fantastic! I also omitted the tomatoes and it was superb. I brought this to a party and everyone raved!

These were so amazing and easy if most of the work is done the day before. So, the day ahead, I toasted the crostini, let them cool, bagged them air tight; roasted the garlic and mixed welll with the goat cheese, & made the chutney. 30 min before guests arrived I spread the cream cheese on the crostini and topped with chutney. It all held up fine, in fact the crostini were a little easier to chew once the chutney juice softened them a bit. Everyone really enjoyed them. An hour or so later there was just one left and I tried it, it still held up well. Definitely now part of our party food repertoire.

When I was in college, I would eat at 128 Cafe a couple of times a month and always, always ordered this to start. When I found the actual recipe about 5 years ago on epicurious, I was totally thrilled. I've made it more times than I can count -- usually omitting the tomato, and sometimes substituting slices of just-ripe pear for the apple -- to universal acclaim. The chutney is great on pork as well.

I put this on the menu for a dinner club I hosted and wasn't really sure what to expect. It ended up being the most popular dish and I made it again as an appetizer when I hosted Thanksgiving. My whole family raved about it...and they are not even goat cheese lovers.

I made this as an alternative to our usual Friday night bruscetta (roasted red pepper, proscuitto, feta). I thought it was delicious; my bf said it was too rich--good for one or two, but after that it was too much. Well, I could've eaten the whole thing myself, and finished it off the next day for lunch. I was leery of adding the tomatoes (it seemed weird) but tasted good. Also tried it without the tomatoes, and it was delicious. Whether you use tomatoes or not, don't leave out the mint! That adds a really nice flavor. Also, I only roasted four cloves of garlic (peeled, tossed in olive oil and salt, wrapped together in foil and baked) with no problem.

A crowd pleaser every year at my holiday cocktail party, but heed the advice of others -- this recipe makes a load of chutney. If you don't want leftovers, the recipe easily halves. And having prepared it both with tomatoes and without, I'm siding with the "without" crowd, but don't leave out the mint.

So good for the sweet and savory lover! One of my favorite party appetizers.

Made this for a neighborhood party. As many have said, not one bite left! I did not use the tomatoes since they have recently been taken off the shelves in supermarkets for making people sick. If was fine and have no plans to use it the next time. I blended the roasted garlic with the cheese to make the assembly easier for guests. Worked out great! Will use this much in the future.

This is a perfect appetizer. Consider prearranging as passed appetizer as it can get messy and tedious. The combination of flavors is incredible! Fresh apple slice is a must. I combined the leftover cheese and chutney with rotisserie chicken in lettuce wraps for lunch the next day.

I made this for a Xmas party of 20-30 guests. Made it exactly by the recipe, however, I added a 1/4" slice of pork tenderloin on the roasted garlic/goat cheese spread and topped with the chutney. Makes it more of a heavy hor doevre and everyone raved!!! The apple chutney is incredible and as everyone says, the blend of garlic, cheese, sweet and hot is uniquely appetizing. I used the epicurious recipe "tender pork tenderloin". You know, this even tasted great cold the next day!

Like several other reviewers, we first enjoyed this treat at Cafe 128. Yum! For the folks concerned about making too much chutney, we've found that the cooked chutney freezes well for future use (sans tomatoes/mint, which can be added -or skipped - when you're ready to enjoy round two).

This was easy to make and very, very tasty. The blend of flavors is wonderful. I make half the chutney recipe and had plenty, as suggested by previous reviewers. I also omitted the tomatoes and did not compromise the recipe at all imho.

This was my Christmas hors d'oeuvre, and it was a bit hit. The combination of flavors and textures is delicious. I made this with exactly the same ingredients called for, but instead of brushing the baguette slices with oil, I sprayed them with olive oil and baked them for only 3 mins. In my opinion, they were just crisp enough, but my husband found them too crisp for his taste. The recipe makes more than enough chutney to repeat the process with a new batch of crostini, which I intend to do--soon! Excellent!

I used this to win an Iron Chef Apple Battle with some friends. I skipped the roasted garlic and served it warm on crostini with a dab of the goat cheese. I've also just spread it cold on a slice of bread with some cheese as a sandwich. Decadent? Oh yes.

Made this as the first course at our annual New Year's Eve six-course meal... WOW. Rave reviews. Full recipe GONE in no time, with just six of us. The combination of flavors is out of this world! Did all at room temp since I had to transport to our friends' house -- assembled there. May have been the best course of the evening!

LOVE THIS recipe! Made it for the second time for Tgiving appetizer (at least 1-2 hours before the meal because folks will fill up on this!) Used the pear and apple chutney recipe on this site b/c it's simpler -- the beauty is the garlic, cheese and chutney combining tastes and textures and temperatures (make sure you serve with warm garlic). I love putting it out for a small crowd and letting them make their own -- they'll start out a little squeamish about squeezing out the garlic and will then spend 20 minutes perfecting their crostinis to their personal tastes. Delicious, unique and fun!

Terrific recipe and it works flawlessly. Like others, I'm a 128 regular and have always wanted to know how to make this. It will be a part of my permanent repetoire from now on. It was a complete hit at a dinner party--I served just the chutney with roast pork loin with mustard sauce--it was all I could do to restrain myself from eating all the chutney before everyone came over! The mint is a crucial ingredient, though it seems like it would be odd. I used about 10 sundried tomato halves in lieu of fresh roma tomatoes (it's November, why bother?), and those worked nicely. (I soaked them in hot water first then drained and chopped them.)

Made this for a cocktail party...you can get away with keeping the chutney ratio as is and doubling the goat cheese/crostinis. Make the chutney at least a day ahead of time to develop flavors...serve warm...much nicer texture and flavor. Bring chutney to room temperature before putting together.

Rating: 0
I omitted the tomatoes but included the mint (sprinkled on top of each finished crostini rather than mixed into the chutney, for presentation as well as for graeater layering of flavor), and while the mix of these flavors was very good, the overall enjoyment of the dish probably would have been better if served slightly more warmed rather than at room temperature.

I was thrilled to find this recipe after having this dish at the 128 a couple of weeks ago! This is amazing. I made it for a party of 9 people last night. It was a big hit! The recipe says it makes 8 servings, but I think it makes at least 15. I still have plenty of goat cheese and chutney left. But that is just fine with us... we can have it again today!!! I should also mention that I forgot the tomatoes and it was fine.

the cheese and garlic combination was excellent, however i didn't care for the tomato and mint in the chutney. i have a feeling i will omit those ingredients the next time i make this, or i will add less tomato and allow it to cook down some with the apples, while leaving out the mint.

I multiplied this recipe by four, for a big holiday party. Luckily, I realized before I did so that I was going to have plenty of chutney using only the quantities given here. I ended up throwing away a large portion of the leftover chutney even after making so many of these. Everyone enjoyed them!

This recipe was heinous. Of course, it might have been better if I hadn't left out the ROASTED GARLIC, GOAT CHEESE, and APPLE CHUTNEY....(!) You know, if you're going to leave out major ingredients like an entire cup of something or an entire teaspoon of a strong herb like fresh mint, why are you reviewing THIS recipe? You didn't make THIS recipe.

I made this for a dinner party last weekend and it got raves from everyone. Very unique flavor and a great presentation. Be sure and use all the roasted garlic, in fact make more!! AND, don't be afraid to use a lot of goat cheese. The chutney makes enough for more than one baguette.

What a great combination of flavors! This was a hit at our last party. It is sweet, but when placed on a platter with other appetizers, it provides variety and beauty. I will definitely keep this recipe. If I were to change anything, I would make a 1/2 recipe next time. This does make quite a bit of chutney, and serves far more than 8 people as an appetizer.

EXCELLENT! I look forward to making this again - I was in a hurry - needed a quick app for a crowd - I used toasted thin Boboli instead of baguette, mixed the goat cheese with 1/2 cream cheese, used a good quality prepared chutney, I topped it all with a few toasted walnuts - cut unto 2"x2" squares with a pizza cutter...this app was a great hit! Next time I will follow the recipe to the letter - (taking more time) but it was so good - the flavors of the roasted garlic and the chutney and the cheese were very sophisticated and wonderful! I also like another reviewer's choice of serving the components separately!

What a fabulous combination of flavors. If you like foods that have layers of flavors that compliment each over, then this is the appetizer for you. It's also visually appealing with the green mint and red tomato setting off the color of the chutney. My guests ate it as fast as I made it.

Easy and delicious! As others, I left out the tomatoes. But to give more eye appeal, I do think it needs some red. I think I'll saute some matchstick size red pepper in the wonderful juice. After assembly, placing a few on the top. Also, I would add a pinch more cayenne. This is a make again for the holidays.

I served Reveillon to my friends and family Christmas Eve and made enough so we could just munch on leftovers all day today and have a lazy, play with toys and gadgets day to ourselves. Among all the appetizers I made, this was my favorite! Definitely make the Chutney a day ahead -- it is full of flavor. The plum tomatoes are quite good this time of year from the southern hemisphere, so I don't agree with tomato problem. I used more mint and I used garlic flavored olive oil instead (easily made and stored briefly during this time of year). The goat cheese did it. I hadn't realized what a perfect base a good goat cheese can be to Crostini. And with the tomatoes and mint added, the Chutney tasted great for a second go around the next day. Yum!

I would suggest serving the appetizer as they do in the restuarant where everything is served separately, the whole bulb of garlic which you squeeze out yourself, the chutney and goat cheese, so you can use as much or as little as you please.

THis dish is unique and addictive. It has been an enormous hit with my friends. I do change it a bit. I doubled the cayenne to offset the sweetness and add complexity to the flavor of the chutney. Who likes raisins? Not me, so I eliminate them. I agree with other reviewers to eliminate the tomatoes.

This was a fabulous do-ahead. We made crostini ahead of time and then rubbed the freshly roasted garlic on that when we were ready to serve it. When you do crostini, let the cheese and chutney sit on the toast for 5-10 minutes, so the chutney can "soak" into the cheese and toast!
