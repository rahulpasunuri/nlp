Thanks to all the reviews submitted my duck came out perfect. This was my first duck experiment and it was surprisingly good. As suggested in other reviews, I reduced the braising time to 35 minutes each side. Instead, I roasted the duck a little longer, breast up for 20 minutes at 500F, breast down at 400F for 20 minutes, and breast up at 400F for 10 minutes. I glazed the duck before and after roasting it. Since some reviews said the sauce came out thin, I used 2tbsp of arrowroot instead of 1.5tbsp and a little less clementine juice. It had the perfect consistency. All in all (with a few small adjustments) this duck was a delicious Christmas meal!

In the end of it all the duck had a really nice flavor, but was it worth all that time? Probably not. It had a great taste, but if I were to make it again I would wait until I had to make several for a large group, but for the two of us, it wasn't worth it. One problem, besides the time involved, was that the recipe, as published, was very disjointed and difficult to make heads or tails of. Perhaps the original author could rewrite it to make it easier to follow. Bottom line was this: great flavors but not a meal for just two. If you're doing a meal for several and have the time, go for it!

Frankenduck is indeed the term with the bare bones sticking out - but the taste was amazing! Provided a delicious meal for the family and a lot of amusement too. Will definitely make again - maybe cut back a little on the braise time in hopes of a prettier end result? Also just used a microplaning zester on the tangerines rather than the listed method.

Absolutely delicious. This was my first time making duck and I am a fairly inexperienced cook. I don't think it was terribly difficult or messy, though I did make it the night before the housekeeper came. I too used a zester rather than blanching strips of the rind, and I did half orange juice and half clementine juice. A tip on getting the fat to separate from the cooking liquid: put it in the freezer once it has cooled. I put the bowl in a Pyrex dish surrounded by ice and put a few baggies of ice in the bowl. It took 20 minutes for a solid layer of fat to form on the top and my sauce was not fatty in the least! Unfortunately the sauce doesn't keep well...but the glaze does!

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner and it turned out really great. In fact, so great this is the first time I've ever reviewed anything. I made 3 ducks since I had 6 people to feed and we have some leftover but not a ton. The only thing I did differently then the recipe is I used a zester to zest the clementines as using a peeler and then scraping off the pith and then julienne-ing the pieces seemed like too much work. Also, I ended up roasting the ducks longer at the end. Once they got golden I turned the oven down to 400 and roasted longer (I'm not sure how long, maybe another 30min) to get the inside temp up to 160 before I let them rest. The sauce was a little thin but great flavor. the birds looked incredible and tasted even better!

We skipped the part with the shallots and just put all our duck juice in with the orange/vinegar reduction and it was still ah-mah-zing!

A friend had made duck for Thanksgiving that was good, but not crisp. I felt I could do better so I made this for Christmas Eve, using only one duck. While almost all of the fat rendered out, I agree with a Cook from Baltimore that it made a big mess and seemed more involved than necessary. I have a dutch oven large enough for one duck, so I didn't have to deal with the foil - definite bonus. Also, who can actually poke holes in the skin with a fork without piercing the meat? I used kitchen scissors to nip holes in the skin - worked beautifully. This duck was tasty, but truly UGLY! So ugly that I took pictures and we had a good laugh! If you want to impress company with a lovely dish - don't use this one! My sauce didn't thicken properly, but I probably used too much liquid. Tasted good, but very thin.

This recipe looks awesome! I have been looking for a main dish for Christmas Eve, and I think I just found one! :) ----- As someone mentioned this recipe being too complicated, here is a simpler one: http://www.cuisineetvinsdefrance.com/ recettes.php?idRecette=377. It's in French, but Google Translate can give the basics, even if you don't speak French...

Definitely my favorite roast duck recipe. It doesn't normally need the full two hours to braise though.

Although this dish was very good, I would not make it again due to the large amount of work it took and mess it made. This generated quite a lot of duck fat and smoked up the oven pretty bad while roasting. The sauce was OK - but not good enough considering the effort and having to juice all of the citrus fruit. As with some other of the reviewers, I found that the skin and meat came off of the wing bones after braising which took away from the appearance of the cooked duck. All in all, I'd like to find an easier way to make a duck that tastes just as good or better (I've still had better in some restaruants so this wasn't the 'utlimate' duck recipe for me).

Wonderful recipe. One guest remarked it was the best duck she'd ever eaten, and another nearly finished off a whole duck all by himself! I reduced the braising time by 30 minutes, and although there was still some retraction of skin on the extremities as mentioned by sautedude, it wasn't very noticeable. Next time I will apply the glaze before chilling and roasting like you do for Peking duck. Also, after roasting there wasn't much of anything to deglaze in the pan except some burnt bits that discolored the sauce, so I plan to skip it and just add the 2 cups of broth to the sauce.

Fabulous! My family has shared this recipe they like it so much

Ususally I can't follow a recipe precisely to save my life, but, since I had never cooked duck before, I towed the line. Thie is a great recipe! In fact, my only disappointment was that I had invited guests to share it! I made it for my family again a few nights later. The lengthy braising eliminates the yucky fattiness of duck completely. Well, I think it's yucky, but I reserved the fat rendered from the braising and gave it to my Irish Setter dogs as a treat on thier dinners. They loved it so much that they figured out how to opened the refigerator and took the rest! Bird dogs will be bird dogs...

The resulting duck was extremely juicy, and the glaze was fantastic (I used oranges instead of clementines). I did have one serious issue, though--when I braised the duck, the skin and meat on the thin parts of the animal, the wings and the lower end of the drumstick, snapped or fell off the bird. The result after braising was a pale-white corpse-duck with it's skeleton exposed in the limbs that looked like it came out of some kind of waterfowl horror movie. The end result still tasted fantastic, and I was able to salvage the presentation by slicing the breasts and thighs off whole and just serving those, but I was a little perplexed as to why I ended up with a Frankenduck after braising. The resulting sauce also didn't turn out very well, having some off flavors in it, but the duck had plenty of nice orange flavor with just the glaze.

This Duck was amazing. The brazing method makes all the difference in the world, crispy, juicy and tender. My husband loved it. I thought the sauce was a little to pungent for my taste. I think it was enough just to put the small amount of glaze on while roasting it, but not serve w/ the duck. I will always cook the duck this way in the future.

Ever see a six year old devour duck? How about a grown man who "hates" duck? I staged the cooking over the prescribed 2 days which made it easier for removing excess fat which builds up in the stock. The braising creates a moist meat while reducing the fat content and the second cooking makes a beautiful crisp skin that holds the sauce wonderfully. If you have any leftovers (which you very well may not) I would suggest slicing the pieces and serving in a salad of mixed greens, scallions, mandarin orange segments and a very light oriental dressing with sesame seeds. Delicious! If you have never done duck or have people who say they don't like duck because of the fat content, try this dish on them!

This was the best duck I have ever tasted - bar none. It was so juicy and delicious and the sauce was fabulous. As a time saver, I used Clementine/Tangerine juice I bought at a supermarket. It was great!

The sauce is what makes this dish. The duck turns out looking and tasting very good, but takes a long time to make.

I have to agree this is delicious, and worth the time. I've made this a few times and the family always love it. Next time I might do the 'first cooking' of the duck the day before.

This is the BEST roast duck ever; the sauce is good but this unbelievably crispy and flavorful duck stands on it's own. My husband, who tolerated duck only occasionally, can't wait for me to make it again.

Magnificent! The clementine sauce is the very best "orange" type I've used. I halved the ducks for a Dinner Party of 4 (with "green rice" and giblets) and everybody, including me agreed this definitely a culinary delight to be repeated. Excellent with a deep Pinot Noir.

We love roast duck. This is very special. We like to boil the leftover meat/bones for a hardy soup stock, this is excellent.

It was a fantastic hit with my guests. I'll also make the same recipe with a roaster chicken. Try a roasted asparagus as a side.
