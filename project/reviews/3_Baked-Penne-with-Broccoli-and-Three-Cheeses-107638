Enjoyed this very much. Used 1 jar garlicky pasta sauce, plus 1/2 red onion sauteed per a previous reviewer's suggestion, and mixed 2 types of pasta. The broccoli had a delicate, mild flavor without being overcooked - next time I will add a little more onion and up to 1 cup more broccoli. NOTE: had to use my "biggest" lasagna pan, not the size listed.

Entire family enjoyed. Love that you can make in advance and that it got my kids to eat broccoli.

I have made this a few times and agree with other posters that twice as much sauce is needed otherwise it is too dry. I used Rao's pasta sauce and everyone loved it.

I used this recipe as a jumping off point for what I had in the house. I made my own quick marinara with garlic, onion and Italian spices. I had no Parmesan and I used low fat cottage cheese and mozzaarella. I only used about 1.5 pounds of pasta. It was very good! Be careful not to overcook the pasta in the bouling water! A great quick alternative to the boring pasta with tomato sauce.

This recipe came out delicious. I used the appropriate amount of ricotta and also mixed in a half of a block of squeezed out tofu that I tore apart to match the consistency of the ricotta. I also sauteed half of a red onion and added the garlic mid-way through. I added a little bit of extra Parmesan on top. Unless I told you, I don't think you would ever know that I put tofu in it, it blends right in!

I enjoy this recipe quite a lot, but I think that it needs more salt and a good addition to it is some shredded beef

You can never go wrong with pasta and cheese and sauce and veggies... this was perfect for a quick week night meal- it took no time or effort at all, and it was pretty tasty. I will definetly make this again, but next time I would add way more garlic and a little more sauce.

My expectations of this recipe weren't met even with homemade marinara. It's easy enough so I'll try it again but with some tweaks - definitely more sauce (which I now see other reviewers noted previously - that will teach me to work from a hard copy rather than looking at it online!!) and more cheese. Next time I'll bake it covered until the last few minutes because it dried out - might reduce the oven temp, too.

I made this tonight for myself and my very picky boyfriend. He hates broccoli so I used zucchini and summer squash instead and sauted them with the oil and garlic. I used a whole jar of sauce and a whole bag of whole wheat pasta and it was a good sauce to pasta ratio. I also threw some fresh tomato in. Both of us really liked this.

This has become a major favorite in my house. Even my extremely picky daughter will tolerate it, as long as I pick out the broccoli first. Like many other reviewers, I make my own marinara - it's worth it. I also saute the broccoli with the garlic. Yummy, great to take to potlucks, good for a crowd or just your own family. Highly recommended.

Not bad! As expected, reminiscent of lasagna. An easy vegetarian family-style meal. Substituted cottage cheese for ricotta, and pesto for the basil; that worked quite well. It's definitely healthier than most baked pasta what-not with all that broccoli. It should be cut into fairly small pieces, but I was surprised to find myself not overwhelmed by the broccoli -- more veg would be welcome.

Not sure what happened with the people who didn't like this. Maybe it was the farmer's market broccoli, or my mom's homemade sauce, or the extra cheese I added, or the fresh mozzarella I used, but I thought it was great. The tops of the pasta got a little crispy in the oven, the extra mozzarella became gooey on top - YUM! This should really be 3 1/2 forks but that option doesn't exist. Maybe it should be four because I'm finishing the leftovers for lunch right now and am kind of sad that it's gone!

I thought this was very good! It was very simple, which made it even better! I added 3 cups of sauce like the others suggested, and used minced garlic from a jar so I wouldn't have an extra pan to wash. This made it very simple! I think the secret to splurge on a pricer marinara sauce that has a lot of spices. I could see how it would be kinda bland if the jarred sauce was lame.

Rating: 2
I would make again with alterations because my 2 year old ate this - broccoli & all. I wasn't too impressed but I think it was the sauce. It was Muir Glen, but all I could taste was the jar. Next time I'd make my own basic sauce and add at least 3 cups as ours turned out dry with 2 cups.

Very good, but not a low-calorie recipe.

I'd give it 2.5 forks too. Good weeknight, easy to prepare dinner. I used garlic powder so I would have one fewer pan to wash, and prepped the baking pan for easier clean up. My husband really enjoyed it and I would call it food for food's sake - what's not to like about veggies and pasta smothered in sauce and cheese???

Superb dish. Excellent. My husband can't get enough of it. I did not use broccoli. I sauteed some ground turkey with the garlic. Then tossed it in together with everything else. I also had extra ricotta which I layered on top of the pasta before I put the mozzarella on. That extra layer of ricotta added an uummpphh that made it taste extra special. Will make it over and over again. Great with crunchy french bread.

Instead of blanching the vegetables, I sauted them with the garlic, then covered the pan and steamed them for about five minutes. I also added zucchini and porcini. The result was delicious. The vegetables weren't the least bit soggy. Next time, I'll fix the veg the same way and also add more basil.

Rating: 2
2+1/2 forks really. Very good, simple, quick, everyday dinner. We added zucchini and mushrooms, and easily served six with a side salad and baguette. Will make again only because I made an extra to freeze.

This recipe is AWESOME with your own touches added on. Personally I added italian sausage, mushrooms, and I used Parmesan, Ricotta, Asiago, and Romano (all salty cheeses plus ricotta for the creaminess). The dish turned out amazing, although next time I'll probably use Mozarella instead of the Romano or Parmesan.

Quick, easy, delicious and very versatile. You can add virtually any veggies you like(I added zucchini) and use any red sauce you like as well. Great weeknight dinner, and good for cleaning out the fridge!

Nice simple dinner- nothing special or exotic, but very homey and easy to prepare. A lot depends on the sauce you choose to use...

Rating: 2
I think this recipe is best used as a base, but requires each cook to use her/his own imagination to create something more flavorful. I made the recipe as written and thought it was too bland, so I added sauteed mushrooms and zucchini, some asiago cheese, and hot pepper flakes. I think this recipe comes in handy when you're trying to figure out how to pull something together with the odds and ends in your frigde and pantry.

This is an extremely easy, quick, and tasty family dinner. Not company fare, though, unless it's for an extremely casual friends with kids dropping by kind of thing. I'll use this again when I'm stumped for something easy and quick that reinforces the idea for my kids that they love broccoli.

Very good. I used more cheese than suggested, and added spinach with the broccoli.

My entire family gave up meat for lent, so this dish really fit the bill.... Made it on a Wednesday -- perfect "hump day" meal. I didn't have ricotta, so used cottage cheese. Didn't have fresh basil, so used a combination of dried basil and Italian seasoning. And of course, my hand is always "heavy" when it comes to cheese (added a bit more mozzarella and parmesan than indicated in recipe). Hearty, hit the spot, and tasty. Don't know that I woul serve this meal for company, but perfect for a mid-week, meatless family meal. Do it!

Little people in my family really loved this dish! The big people didn't think it was so bad either. I'll definitely make again for a change to my baked mac and cheese.

I made this for a get-together with another family (5 kids, 4 adults) and they ate it, but no one loved it. The cheese has been cut back too much, and it's bland. My sister-in-law makes a very similar, very easy dish my kids love. I asked her for that recipe, and it calls for 1.5 lbs. ricotta, 1 lb. mozzarella, 1/4 cup parmesan, 1 quart marinara to 1 lb. pasta...then add vegetables, sausage, etc. in dish or on side as you like. I'll stick with that.

I agree with the other reviewers. This was very.... unexciting. I followed the recommendations except for the homemade marinara sauce. Maybe that would make all the difference. The only reason I'd make this again would be to freeze it for a dire emergency.

My family loves this dish. It may not be "gourmet", but it's tasty and it's a great way to sneak in those veggies. I used Bertolli italian sausage, romano and garlic pasta sauce--yummy and easy. It is officially in my repertoire of easy, kid-friendly weeknight recipes!

I am a 16-year old who made this recipe to give mom a break from cooking. It was so easy!!!! The whole family enjoyed it! I added more mozzarella, but with a side of salad and bread, it's a great dinner!

I used my own leftover marinara sauce, and thought this dish was fine. It was VERY easy to make, and I would make it again. But it doesn't feed four - needed sides - chicken (and salad) works well.

I am really suprised at the number of dislikes. I really liked this recipe and found it quite easy to do as well. I did put probably double the amount of garlic as called for but followed the recipe and this is the second time that I have made it and both times enjoyed it. I ate it with a side dish of chicken one time as well as a tossed salad. Perhaps the problem lies in whatever the marinara sauce is that people are using! Mine is from a small italian shop that makes home made sauces.

This recipe was so bland and tasteless! By the time I made this dish edible, it was a completely different meal. I suggest adding onion, mushrooms, and chicken to this recipe along with alot more Mozzerella and Monterey Jack. (Not to mention Italian spices!) And for crimeny's sake... make your own marinara sauce... from scratch!

This dish was disgusting. It was tastesless. I suppose it could be altered, but I'd rather look for another meatless recipe.

A great side dish by combining the pasta and the vegetable. The suggestions of adding mushrooms and sausage add versatility; but I see this with a white sauce like an Alfredo. Add 1/4 cup more parmesan, decrease basil. 1/2 cup is too overpowering.

Rating: 3
I just fixed this . It didn't take a whole lot of time, and it is good. I read the reviews, and decided to add the mushrooms as well as the broccoli. Adding sausage to this receipe, and not so much broccli, would be really great!

Good and easy casserole. I added more broccoli and baked it in a 11X9 baking dish. Next time, I will add some mushrooms.

Rating: 2
I agree, not spectacular, but quick and easy for a midweek, "vegetarian" meal. I added an extra clove of garlic and heavily seasoned with pepper and salt. So simple, I felt like I was doing the family a disservice by serving it to them (being that I prepare so many other more involved recipes on this site) :-)

Not *spectacular*, but still very tasty! I will definitely make this again.

A good, lower-fat pasta recipe. I used whole wheat rotini and had to add some frozen peas as I didn't have enough broccoli. It's worth making again with different combinations of vegetables. Spinach might be nice next time. It was more garlicky that I thought it would be.

This is a wonderful pasta dish. Even if you are not crazy about broccoli, try it! It's definitely a keeper. For a change, add sausage or even diced chicken. Everyone raved about this recipe. I made it originally on a Sunday and then reheated on Wednesday. Wasn't a bit dry! Perfect.
