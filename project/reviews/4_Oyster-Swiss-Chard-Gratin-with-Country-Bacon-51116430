Fantastic dish! My family has traditionally made oyster stuffing...this was a wonderful change that my family now loves more than the stuffing. Cannot recommend highly enough!

I made this to serve with our Thanksgiving turkey and now will be making it for Christmas to serve with prime rib. Rich, creamy, absolutely delicious and decadent sidedish!

Served this for Thanksgiving & everyone raved about it. Will be on my "permanent" list, and not just for Thanksgiving.
