I don't know how anyone could not love these. They are absolutely wonderful! I've been making these for Thanksgiving and Christmas every year. I get into trouble with my family if I don't make them. They're a little messy to make, but well worth it. I always hope there are leftovers which I like for breakfast.

I expected these to be much better than they were. I made them for Thanksgiving and it was a lot of work-rendering the bacon etc. The biscuits were dry and not that flavorful. I'll try making them again.Even though I did like the taste, none of my guests did. Maybe I did something wrong. I'm an experienced båker and I can't figure out what went wrong.

These were great...sort of a cross between corn bread and a biscuit. They were easy to make and everyone thought they were delicious. The leftovers also made great stuffing to go with roast chicken the next day.

These are very hearty biscuits. You could eat one or two of them for breakfast and they would hold you until lunch. Despite the addition of the corn kernels, bacon etc., it wasn't a heavy biscuit. Although, I think that I would cut back on the bacon the next time I make them (the bacon flavor was a little too overwhelming for me).

These were pretty good. My husband gave me the ok to make them again.

These biscuits were great, even my kids liked them! I added an extra tablespoon of buttermilk instead of the bacon drippings, and the bacon flavor still came through. Can't wait to make them again. :)

Very nice buscuits. I made them to go with one of the several New England Clam Chowder recipes available on this site. The guests stopped raving about the biscuits only long enough to praise the soup.
