I would have liked more of a kick in this dish. I made it with cherry tomatoes from our garden and even adding more serrano than called for it wasn't spicy enough for me. I liked the fresh flavor of the tomatoes with the green beans but next time I will add a whole serrano chile with seeds and also drain off some of the juice before serving.

The cumin made the flavor of the whole salad rather single-note. An addition of a splash of red wine vinegar helped give the dish more dimension and interest.

I really like it. Huge hit with the family, and they usually won't try new things.

I thought this was very bland and boring. Extremely disappointing.

Good green beans, but sauce lacked flavor. The tomatoes were nice but needed something else. I thought it was better after marinating for 2 days. Maybe some additional garlic??

I cut the recipe in half and made it to accompany a seafood curry. It was very tasty and just as good, if not better, the next day. The combination of the green beans and the chutney with a kick worked well and the dish was a refreshing complement to the curry.
