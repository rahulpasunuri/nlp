This cake turned out very tasty and moist. I was skeptical because the recipe was pretty easy. Baked an extra 10 minutes and removed from oven just in time, any longer and edges would have been too brown. I grated the ginger into medium grate size (like cheese for pizza) a finer grate was too wet and clumpy. The pear mixed nicely throughout with a few pieces peeking out the top.

I changed the recipe a bit to work with what I had on hand. I used 2 1/2 teaspoons of ground ginger instead of fresh, light brown sugar instead of dark and 3 red pears since I wanted to use them up before they went bad. I also hand mixed the pears right into the batter, poured the batter in a large muffin pan an cooked for about 1/2 hour at 350. The muffins had pear through out, did not get overdone on the edges and were moist and enjoyable.

Re: the pears not making a difference in the flavor. This recipe works well if you make a pear sauce with brown sugar and brandy. It makes it more complex and the pear sauce with the whipped cream is an amazing combination. Also the cake keeps fairly well in the freezer so you can make it ahead of time.

This dish is a wonderfully mature, though understated, addition to a fall or winter dinner. Kind of like a spice cake, except more interesting thanks to the pear. A friend brought over some pumpkin mousse and homemade (unsweetened) whipped cream, which was a nice complement and added some color. I baked the cake at 325 for about 40 minutes then increased the temperature to 350 for another 15 or so, which kept the edges from burning. Per another reviewer's suggestion I tried to avoid putting pear near the center of the cake. This was a great suggestion! The cake cooked through wonderfully and the edges stayed moist. I decorated the top with some fresh pear and powdered sugar. The flavors do come together better on day 2, so make a day in advance. Great recipe!

While I'm saddened that the pears didn't play a larger role in the flavor of this dish, overall it was delicious. The ginger-y quality of it was scrumptious while not too strong. If I could change one thing about the recipe, I think I'd cook down some pears with sugar and pour it on top!

Though it was delicious, this cake didn't quite come out the way I wanted it to. First, the pears floated on top instead of sinking, which is my understanding of what is supposed to happen, though not stated in the recipe. This made it slightly difficult to cut through- just slightly, though. Also, like other people have mentioned, it cooked quicker on the sides than it did in the middle, so I had to insert toothpicks to test it every now and then, and came close to burning the side. However, once served, it was still moist and the spices were not overpowering. Maybe it would have been richer had I used dark brown sugar, but medium was what I had on hand, so I used that. A pretty easy recipe it was, but, considering all things, it wasn't mind-blowingly fantastic either.

Quick, easy, delicate ginger taste - my guests loved it. I would skip the pear as I didn't find it added anything. Had no trouble getting it out of the pan, so just butter and flour generously.

Based on the previous review, I checked at 25 and at 30 minutes. The outside was done but the the center wasnt. I took it out at 32 minutes. It was very good. I was surprised at how mild the ginger flavor was since it calls for so much. I do agree that it is better the second day. I will make again.

Made this because I was looking for a quick and easy dessert for a weeknight dinner. It was quick and it was easy. Flavors didn't WOW me, thought it would be more gingerbready. Also would recommend checking the oven at about 25-30 minutes as at 35 minutes it was a little over done.

A good cake all around. Nothing spectacular and for a Thanksgiving or Christmas dessert I might try something else in the future. I made it twice and liked it both times. I had a heck of a time trying to get the cake out of the pan each time though so I'd cut a round of parchment paper and place it in the pan and butter that before pouring in the batter.

I've made this cake three times in the last month, each with a different result, but all were amazingly tasty and popular. When I made the cake exactly as the recipe called for, I found it less gingery than I wanted. I recommend adding 1/4 tsp more fresh ginger, a dash of clove, and an extra pear. Great hot or cold.

I have made this cake 3 times now, and I think I've worked out all the little quirks of the recipe. I used 1 pear, not 1.5 like some reviewers suggest, but I cut it into smaller pieces and focused on concentrating them around the outside edges of the cake. That way the center cooks thoroughly, but the edges don't get dried out. Also, while this cake is wonderful the first day, it is stellar the second day after the flavors have had time to develop. It's gingery, not too sweet (very adult-feeling) and perfect with coffee or tea.

Great recipe! Simple, delicious and perfect with a dollop of creme fraiche. This one's a keeper.

I think this has the potential to be 4 forks but I doubled the recipe and baked it in loaf pans, thus the cooking time had to be extended. It burnt a little on the edges and was a little dry on the ends. The middle was so delicious and moist. The pears floated to the middle somewhere; I would add loads more pears so they'd be all throughout the cake. They gave a nice moist and mildly sweet burst of flavor. I served it with vanilla custard sauce and everyone loved it.

Only ok. I love pear, I love ginger, and I certainly love cake, but this was not the fabulousity I was expecting. I took it to a party along with another dessert, and this was pretty much left alone in favor of the other one. If it could be made lower-fat (like replacing half the butter with applesauce) then it would be worth it, but as-is it isn't good enough for the invested calories. Easy to make though! 1.5 pears was perfect.

I just made this recipe and for some reason when I made it the pears didn't sink at all... any ideas why?

This cake was extremely good for how easy it was, and it does make the house smell amazing. The fresh ginger takes it to another level. I may add another pear next time.

This cake was unbelievable, very moist and tasty. I did serve it with a dollop of cardamom pastry cream from another recipe on Epicurious. Definitely a keeper.

Delicious taste but cake didn't cook in center. Outside was done.

I thought this was good, but I did mistakenly overcook it slightly. I would add more pears next time. I plan on serving with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream, although I had a slice for breakfast. My mom makes a great gingerbread out of Betty Crocker.

Really good and pretty easy for a novice baker. It takes a good sized piece of ginger to make a 1/4 cup, and it seems like a lot, but tastes great. 1 1/2 pears seems about right to get pear in every bite. One caution - the second time I made this my pears were not very ripe, so I sprinkled them with a little sugar DO NOT MAKE THIS MISTAKE. The sugar makes them float instead of sink. Not a good look!

Delicous recipe. Very easy to make. I agree with other folks in that it does get better as it lays. I made it for a fall themed dinner party and it was met with rave reviews. Will definitely make it again.

Excellent recipe! The fresh ginger definitely makes it - do not use powdered. I baked in 4 mini loaf pans so I could give away. Perfect amount of sweetness for me, but I don't like things too sweet.

Delicious, moist cake. Great with whole wheat flour and Egg Beaters, too. Makes the house smell great while it bakes! A definite winner.

Fantastic recipe - the fresh ginger really gives this some "zing!". We'll make this again many more times through the holidays.

Delicious. It was very simple to make and tasted better the next day. You could definately add more pear.

Hmmm. For me it is good but not great. Not quite sweet enough for me and probably could do with a little less molasses. Nice texture though. I'm anxious to taste again tomorrow as one reviewer said it gets better over time; maybe with coffee in the morning. I think I'll try another gingerbread recipe before making this one again.

Had to skip the molasses which probably took away from the recipe. Doubled the pear. Overall good cake. easy to make.

I made this like a upside down cake by placing pear slices in pan first with some brown sugar and pouring batter on top to bake, came out very nice and delicious!

Great, not-too sweet cake. Used a bit less molasses because I ran out - came out fine. We all agreed that is was a very good, adult gingerbread cake. Perfect with tea.

I used a little less than 1/4 cup molasses and was very happy with the flavor. I also used two pears. Nice cake texture.

Yum! Easy to do. I sprinkled the pears on top, most of them sunk but would probably double the pears next time. Served with vanilla ice cream.

Nice texture and a subtle, not too sweet flavor. It is definitely important to use fresh pear though! Too firm otherwise.

Excellent recipe! My only complaint was that for me, it took much longer than 35 minutes to cook, and I'm sure I used the right sized pan and followed the recipe exactly. Still, it came out right in the end, and for once it looked exactly like the picture said it would! In answer to a previous reviewer's question, the pears sink through the batter and end up on the bottom during baking.

In the photo, the pears are shown on the bottom. Inthe recipe they are placed on top. Although it doesn't have instruction to do so, is this an upside-dwon cake???

Great cake, made no changes to the recipe. It actually gets better over time - although it did not last very long in my house
