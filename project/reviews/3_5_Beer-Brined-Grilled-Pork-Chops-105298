A great recipe, will definitely use it often. A note though, is that it should be 2 cups hot (or warm) water to dissolve the salt and sugar. The ice is then used to cool the mixture down so you aren't cooking the chops in it while it's marinating. If you use cold beer then you should be able to skip the ice, but would need to let the brine sit for a bit to cool down slightly. :)

Turned out very juicy and tasty after 5 hours of brining. I used lager, which was fine and cut the salt to a little less than a 1/4 cup. I sprinkled garlic powder and ground some pepper on for the rub (no salt) - quick and simple with no sticking issues. Served with a rhubarb chutney and grilled herb potatoes, really tasty!

The chops turned out very juicy, but the taste was a bit salty, and the beer gave it a "I don't dislike it, but not sure if I like it" taste. I used Sierra Nevada Celebration ale and kosher salt and brined for 24 hours. I even reduced the amount of salt. I will try it again, but will try a cider or Blue Moon instead. I grated my garlic rather than mince it, and I am sure that contributed to the taste. Will definatly make again but with my own trist.

Love this recipe,I always try to get 24 hours in brine,I noticed that a little more brown sugar offers better carmelization (of course). A prime filet wrapped in bacon about 1.5 inches thick was the best juiciest pork Ive ever had.This will be a staple in my arsenal of grilling recipes.

I thought it was great! I actually brined it without the molasses, with a little more sugar, for an hour maybe a bit more(half on the counter, half in the refrigerator), I did the rub with some sage powder, garlic powder, kosher salt and pepper. I grilled them on my stove top grill with a bit of olive oil. Served them with onions on top and some mashed potatoes and they where excellent! I loved them! My boyfriend devoured them! I really recommend them!

This is an excellent recipe. Had it years ago and still remembered how good it tasted and wanted to try it again. We bought very good pork from our local butcher, kept the brine to 4 hours, and it was still a little salty (which I love, but others might not like so much). Even with Bud Light, the brine was flavorful and I would not skip the garlic step. The pork was super juicy and cooked perfectly to 145. Served it with braised kale, smashed taters, and a kicked up apple sauce with horseradish (a la Steve Raichlen). DALISH.

This is our favorite pork chop recipe. I'd always had trouble with chops because they always came out too dry. Not any more! This recipe keeps them moist and delicious. I've tried it with dark and light variations of the molasses, beer and sugar, and it's always great. The only modification I make is that I leave the salt out of the rub, and add olive oil like others have suggested. Otherwise, it's as-is.

THIS IS THE BOMB OF BOMBS!!! I used thick porkchops minus the ice cubes with Negra Modelo Dark Lager soaked for 8 hrs. Had a dinner party for 12 and they all commented on the succulent chops.

Nice flavor and very moist. Reading the other reviews, some people feel that the rub is more trouble than it is worth. Taking that into account, I added enough olive oil to hold it together. This worked very well and held the rub in place through the grilling process. I also had my grill at 500F when I seared the chops.

Great brining recipe. The flavors really come through. I didn't care for the rub. It thought it gave it an odd taste and it was hard to spread evenly. The chops came out very moist. Thicker chops are a must.

I love this recipe. I have a habit of overcooking pork chops and the brine really makes them tender. The flavors from the sage and garlic are amazing, I usually use fresh sage though since I have it growing. They are always a hit.

These are very good, but I can see the previous reviewer's point. Indeed I can imagine easier (and less expensive!) marinades that might result in a similar taste. Nonetheless, I do like the natural, smokey, know-exactly-what-you-put-in-it quality of this recipe...and it is very flavorful. I skipped the ice, unsure what that was supposed to achieve???

I'm sorry, but I just wasn't that impressed with this recipe. It was more work and didn't work any better than simpler marinades I have used (Italian dressing, teriyaki sauce). The chops were very moist, but not that flavorful. I won't make these again.

I have been making this recipe since it was first published in the magazine. My family and all those I have made it for, love this recipe. Be sure to use a bone in chop.

As some of the other cooks, I also left the pork chops in the brine a little too long. The flavor was good but a little salty and you really have to like the flavor of molasses. I will make it again, but with a lighter flavor molasses and brown sugar.

OK, so I left it in the brine longer than I should have, about 8 hours instead of 4, and..the first bite was a tad salty, but then you get used to it and the flavor was really good. I used coarse sea salt like the recipe calls for. My chops were about 1 inch thick. I grilled them for exactly 20 min. They were a little dry, but again, the flavor was great. I'm going to make it again, leaving it in the brine for only 4 hours next time and see what happens. THis is definitely worth making again.

This is a great recipe, but unfortunately what gets missed by many is the "coarse" salt. 1/4 cup of coarse salt is a WHOLE lot less than 1/4 cup of table salt. Make sure you're using the right stuff. If you don't have coarse or kosher or sea salt, just add it tablespoon at a time until it tastes salty, but not overbearing. This is just a brine, people!

This came out better than I had hoped! I set the timer so I wouldn't forget to take it out at 4 hours, rinsed well and continued with the recipe. My husband grilled it to perfection and we didn't find it the least bit salty. Even my 2 year old loved it. I've made this twice now and both times have loved it. My hubby did say he liked it best when I used Guinness! I'll keep this recipe handy!

This recipe is fine if you like your pork chops to taste like ham, which I don't. I followed the recipe to the letter except for cutting the salt in the rub by a third, and they were STILL so salty that they were inedible. I don't understand how this recipe gets such a high rating.

This recipe is simply wonderful and so very easy. The first time I made them (right after the July 2001 issue came out), my brother raved about the chops - and he doesn't really like grilled chops! I am making them today which prompted me to write the review. I think most people will be very pleased with the results.

Great recipe, but as most you play with it to make it your own. Firstly we used large pork tenderloin. We ommitted the sugar, used a delicious dark chocolate beer, and allowed it to sit overnight. We also allowed it to soak in water about two hours before grilling, and then rubbed herbs. The tenderloin was just injected with flavors!

These pork chops turned out great! I used the full amount of salt and made sure (after reading the reviews) to take them out after 4 hours, and rinse and dry them well. I also omitted the salt from the rub and cut way back on the pepper (1/3-1/2 the recommened amount). My husband took them off the grill sooner than the recipe stated- he didn't want them to dry out. Our guests loved them and asked for the recipe. Definitely a keeper!

This is a wonderful change to the everyday pork chops - they were very moist and flavorful. My husband was so paranoid that the grilling would dry them out that he wouldn't do the honors - so I did! He was amazed at how easy and tender they were. I used Sam Adams Winter Lager and I felt it was a good choice. This recipe is a keeper and probably will be used more than the stuffed pork chops - less fat and just plain easier.

This has become one of our favorites. I make sure to always use coarse salt, so it isn't too salty for us. However, I have to say that, as a salt addict, I rarely find anything too salty.

Very good recipe. I always brine pork when I grill. It defiantly makes a difference. I used boneless sirloin chops and it came out great. For those who think brining is too salty, two points. 1) The thinner the chop, the less time it takes to brine. E.g. 2-inch bone-in chops can sit for 10 hours. 1-inch boneless chops only need 4 hours. 2) Rinse the meat under cold water after you brine them. The solution is already in the meat, so you aren't rinsing it off.

Succulent and delicious, these come out delectable every time. I'm not a big pork fan myself, but my family is, and even I adored this recipe along with the rest of the gang. I would respectfully disagree with an earlier cook's suggestion to try this recipe with lamb instead of pork. Brines work best with meats like pork, chicken and turkey, not beef and lamb. Brining can leach away the juices from beef and lamb and take away, rather than enhance, their tenderness and flavor. There's a chemical reason for this which is beyond my ability to explain, but I would suggest brining as a successful, fool-proof technique best used with pork and poultry only.

I omitted the salt in the rub and still found this a tad salty (even for a brine). I think you just have to tweak the amount to your salt tolerance. But that's my only quibble. Otherwise, the chops were wonderfully moist and flavorful. Try this one!

We made this for the fourth time last night with 1 1/2" thick boneless pork chops and it was great. Some people have mentioned it being too salty, but it is a brine marinade, however, I did omit the extra teaspoons of salt. The pork was very tender, and the flavor was just right for me.

YES YES YES...tried this over a year ago have fiddled about and have tried turkey in honey brine to much and great success all due to this recipe. What's a couple bucks for a chop or two that you try this one out on? Was fun drinking some nice beer and roasting a bit of pig. Try to use the kosher salt, rinse well and have one (or two) to sample along the way. Fed 23 hungry sailors these chops and not one thought they were salty-and trust me they would let me know. Do a boston butt or a nice tenderloin in the brine too...

These are very easy and tasty. Used a scant 1/4 cup of salt in the brine and none in the rub after reading the other reviews. All so, rinsed and dryed the chops well before applying the rub. The grilling time seemed too much, so only grilled approx 6 min per side and it was perfect for the bone in chops. We used a light lager since I'm not crazy about dark lager, and the taste was perfect. An outstanding recipe!

Rating: 4
You have to make this recipe - best pork chops ever! Very flavorful, extremely moist. Got rave reviews on it! Use DARK lager beer, (don't worry about the carbs - it's not like you're going to drink the brine!). The only change I made was to skip the salt in the rub. This was so easy - we just dropped the pork chops in the brine - went boating for 4 hours and came back and finished the recipe. We made more than we needed and sliced the leftovers for pork sandwiches - still delicious.

Pretty good recipe, 3 star restaurant quality for sure, but not 4 or 5 star quality. I used America's cut chops (Thick boneless chops, omitted water and used all light lager beer which worked well.

I am SO very grateful to the cooks who suggested a reduction in salt in this recipe - thank you everyone - you saved my dinner!!! I used the full amount of coarse salt in the brine, but completely omitted it from the rub & was not disappointed (I used 1/4 cup Baleine coarse sea salt crystals). The chops had just enough flavor & saltiness & were tender & juicy. Since I'm on Atkins, I omitted the brown sugar & used Michelob Ultra in the brine - the beer worked out great & the extra sugar wasn't missed. In addition, I don't have a grill, so I seared the chops on my stovetop, in a hot cast-iron skillet. This recipe is a keeper & I definitely plan to make it again, since we love pork. This is a quick, easy & delicious recipe. I served it with a cauliflower-leek purée, but mashed potatoes would do just as well.

I marinated this for the full 4 hours and the taste of beer and salt was overwhelming (I used coarse sea salt). I also used lean pork chops, and they came out dry and very chewy.

I had the advantage of reading the other reviews and cut salt from both the brine and the rub. I used 3 scant tablespoons in the brine, and 1 teaspoon in the rub. It was delicious, tender, and juicy. I even got two thumbs up from my son. I will definitely make this again.

For those who found the meat too salty and who used kosher salt, they might have been using Morton brand kosher salt, which has a finer flake than Diamond Crystal brand. For THIS PORK CHOP recipe, use 1/4 cup Diamond Crystal kosher salt OR 3 tablespoons Morton kosher salt OR 2 tablespoons table salt. The general conversion is 1/2 cup Diamond Crystal kosher salt OR 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons Morton kosher salt OR 1/4 cup table salt. Hope this clarifies things.

This dish is pretty easy to make, especially using a George Foreman grill. Tasty too, though some might find the rub a bit strong. Unfortunately pork in the U.S. is much leaner (and thus much drier) than pork 15-20 years ago; as the daughter of an ex-pig farmer, I know! Brining helped with the dryness, but fattier, well-marbled pork would be better. Bring back the fat!

I made this last night for my fiance. He said they were the tastiest pork chops he'd ever had! He did say the rub was a little strong.(I didn't have any coarse ground pepper, so I crushed black peppercorns I had on hand instead). The rub was a tad salty, so next time I'll cut the salt to ~1 1/2 tsp. VERY good recipe - I'll definately make this again.

I cannot get a recipe for pork chops that my family likes, I had tried this one once and it was "ok" tried it yet again. I am now convinced that it really is the pork. Ok we all need to be more aware of the ill effects of fat content. But, I remember pork chops as a kid, luscious things which I devoured. Chops are just not the same, brining them is an attempt to make an otherwise tough and almost inedible cut tasty. It does not work. I will stick to beef, chicken and other cuts of pork, at least the flavor is of meat. Disguise it as we may, there is nothing as delightful as a warm muffin, a good steak or a wonderful bone in chop (with fat thank-you). I want the real thing!

Tried recipe with a few extra pieces to sacrific along the way to check on brining progess. Used regular table salt at one half the amount of course salt required, brined for half of the time and cooked one to check for flavor. Chop was ok. Brined remaining chops for required time and cooked. They were great! remember as in any recipe, regional and brand differences can affect outcome, there are saltier salts and water from softeners etc... this was a nice change of pace, really moist and fun to do-a little beer for me and a little for the pig. p.s.ice slows down salt absorbtion.

This was my second try brining pork chops, and fortunately it's been improving. The meat was juicy even though I cooked it a bit long. Because the chops were too salty (despite my having rinsed them after removing from the brine, which did contain coarse kosher salt), I'm going to skip the spice rub next time. I don't think they need the extra flavor, and it keeps the preparation extremely simple. I'll save the rubs for separate dishes. I was glad to find a brine that didn't require boiling to dissolve the salt, because that's where I went wrong last time. I think that with more practice I'll get the brining and broiling down right, and this will then be an excellent main course for dinner guests.

The brining made the chops incredibly juicy--and we grill pork A LOT. For those who found the chops too salty, try rinsing 'em first. Be sure to use thick, bone-in pork if you can find them--the bone keeps the meat from drying out on the grill.

We used Yuengling Lager for the recepie...a dark amber lager available in the northeastern U.S. (it's actually the oldest brewery in the country.) The chops came out moist and full of flavor: the saltiness was not overbearing and complimented the flavor of the lager like a pretzle does at the bar.

My friend made this for us one weekend. It was the juiciest, most flavorful chop I have ever had. She used boneless loin chops, cut thick; 1.5 inches, I think. She grilled them on a very hot grill. Fabulous! I made it myself and I must say, it was a bit salty and garlicy (my fault - I added more than the recipe called for because I love garlic). And I only used half of the salt called for in the recipe. Skip the salt in the topping and go easy on the garlic. Let the salt do its magic in the brine and allow the beer flavor to come through!!

No rating, as I only made the brine. I used it for about two and a half hours with my country style ribs. They were already almost too salty, and kind of heavy on the beer taste (perhaps a poor choice of beer?). I don't think I'll bother to try this as written.

Have made it three times. However, once my dinner plans changed and it was left to soak overnight. The chips were almost too salty to eat. Also I used fresh sage instead of the dried, about 1/4 to 1/2 cup. I used a food processer to mince up the leaves.

We've made this recipe 5 or 6 times and served them to company and everyone has loved them and asked for the recipe. I find thin cut chops, make grilling faster, safer and get better flavor. We cut the molasses amount in half.

Cook on 8/28 is right; trichinosis and most bacteria is killed in pork by about 140*...there is no need to cook to "leather" overkill; 150-155* or so is plenty. Pork can be JUST done (medium-well), still juicy and tender and NOT give you diseases. Check Julia Child's recommendation it is the same temp or less than this. Overcooked pork is usually due to killing it to a temp of 170-180*. If you are fearful, cook to 155 and let it rest to come to 160.

Spokane, I didn't say to eat RARE pork, I suggested that people sometimes KILL it (OVERCOOK it to "leather") unnecessarily due to fears of trichinosis....which was also more prevalent in the past when pork was fed/raised differently.

I added some orange juice and crushed red chilies to the brine(using kosher salt). Very tender results!

Awful! I used course salt and cut the amount in half and it was still too salty.

Stuck the chops up my arse for half an hour. Added some great flavour... a little tough though. Drank the beer, so I used my urine.

These pork chops were soooo good. Tender and wonderful flavor. I have a habit of overcooking chops so I was really proud of myself that these came out so well. I will make these again and again.

Rating: 1
To cook on 8/25/01, you are ill-informed about things being different now about trichinosis. Eat all the rare pork you want, but don't encourage the rest of us to do the same. And of course there is too much salt in the rub.

I followed this recipe exactly, using kosher salt. It was so salty I couldn't eat it. (And I LOVE salt!) My husband and friend ate theirs, I think to be nice. I did like how the taste of the beer came through, maybe if I eliminated the salt in the rub or brined for less time the pork chops would've been better.

This recipe was pretty good; my husband and 3 year old liked it. My 8 year old did not for some reason.

Rating: 1
Where did I go wrong? Used the right salt, marinated exactly as described, and it was inedibly salty! One plus - it was very tender, as advertised. Any thoughts?

Rating: 2
My chops were thicker and I brined them for about 5 hours. They were not any more tender than usual. The rub was tasty. I had some left over and they stayed in the brine overnight. They looked like they are going to be noticeably more tender--I'll try the recipe again.

Rating: 3
Very tender and juicy. And even a grilling novice as myself avoided scorching them. Everyone loved it. One of the chops fell on the ground and I had to rinse off the rub and it was s significant difference in taste to me. Thanks for all the helpful comments below!

Rating: 3
Hands down the best tasting and moistest pork chops I've ever grilled. They were even grilled over direct flame on a gas grill. Next time, though, I'm going to cut down or eliminate the salt in the rub.

Rating: 4
Four plus stars and I'll make it again and again. At a recent barbecue I used thin, cheap, porkchops and they too were moist and delicious. In fact, I ended up printing the recipe for everyone at the party! Even my sister, who is no gourmet chef, raved. I followed the recipe, used kosher salt, molasses as called for, and just regular beer. Ya know, if you're going to make random substitutions, you shouldn't rate the original recipe. THIS ONE IS A WINNER!

Yum! My husband started dinner and forgot to rub the chops with the garlic, salt, pepper, etc. before putting them on the grill and it was still delicious. I grilled thick boneless chops over a direct flame and still had a tender product.

After years of failed pork chops on the grill and smoker, I have finally found one that I like! This recipe is so easy that it doesn't seem like it should be this good. Here are the specifics of my variations: 1. Boneless 1+" thick loin chops from Costco 2. Used a tad of maple syrup instead of the molasses 3. Anchor Steam Stout for the marinade 4. Cut the salt in the final rub by 1/2 and added one TBS of olive oil. Other suggestions: After marinating the chops, dry them really well with paper towels - this will avoid "seepage" of coagulated proteins and brine onto the beatiful grilled surface of the chops once they start cooking. Grilling technique (and this may be the most important!): Use a Weber kettle BBQ if you are lucky enough to have one. IMO, this recipe will NOT be as good prepared over a direct flame (i.e. a gas-fired BBQ). I prepared my coals (~60 of them)in the center of the grill, seared the chops on each side, then moved the coals into a ring around the outside edge of the lower grate. Then I added a small chunk of hickory (that had soaked in water for a couple of hours). I placed the chops into the center so that they were not directly above the coals, and grilled them for about 30 minutes with the top and bottom air vents open but the lid on, turning the chops once. The results were beautifully-bronzed chops with nice grill marks, incredibly tender, and flavorful. Believe it or not, I served them with a little bit of apple sauce - it was delicious!

My husband loved this recipe, but I thought it was too salty. For a brined pork recipe, I prefer "Grilled pork chops with molasses Barbeque sauce" from Bon Appetit June 1998. It has more flavor and less salt, but still gives the juicy effect of brining.

Rating: 3
These were delicious. Very moist. But I couldn't taste much of the garlic, and considering the amount on there, that was surprising. It's very important to use the coarse (or Kosher) salt called for here, both in the brine and in the rub-- otherwise the chops will be unbearably salty. As well, patting the chops COMPLETELY dry is crucial to the spice rub adhering properly to the meat. I served the pork with the potato and pea salad from the same issue. Both recipes will be repeated many times over.

Rating: 3
The chops really did come out juicy - hard to do with today's lean pork! We did find them too salty for our taste, however. Also, I used fresh sage from my garden, instead of dried. Next time, I will omit the salt in the rub, and double the amount of sage.

Rating: 1
What a boring recipe -- no flavor except salt, and not more juicy or tender than any other carefully grilled chop.

Rating: 3
We loved the recipe and will make it again. It is a little salty, so I'll have to work on that.

Keeps the chops moist and flavorful despite grilling. A big success

Very easy and delicious!

Was a little nervous about the salt as other reviewers have noted, but I followed the directions and it turned out wonderfully--not too salty at all. Used a light lager instead of dark and fresh thyme instead of sage. Everyone liked it!

Rating: 3
Pretty good chops. But thought they would be a little better after having read all of the other reviews. I followed the recipe exactly (with thick cut bone in loin chops), and while good, they are not the BEST I have ever had.

Rating: 4
Awesome! My family loved it. I made some substitutions so I wouldn't have to go to the store: I used light beer and light brown sugar instead of dark, and I used dark molasses instead of light. I omitted the salt in the garlic mixture and substituted marjoram for the sage. Also for those of you who still use charcoal grills, cook the chops using the indirect method for 15-20 min and then place directly over coals 2 more min on each side. They were perfect!

Rating: 4
Loved it. The chops were juicy with beautiful color. Next time I'll use less salt in the garlic mixture.

Rating: 3
A good pork chop recipe for the grill. I used fresh sage because I had it, and also an amber (not dark) lager, and dark (not light) molasses. My thought was that these would balance out. In any case, it was really good, moist, not too salty in my opinion, and will be made again at my house.

"The best pork chops I've ever had," was my husband's quote. I agree. Couldn't use the BBQ at the last minute; even though I had to resort to using the broiler, they were STILL fabulous.

In a word - great! Found the pork to be wonderfully moist and flavorful. Loved the garlic/pepper/beer flavors. Also loved the ease of preparation as we have a newborn. A good midweek entree.

This recipe was decent, but nothing spectacular. I found the brine taste to be a bit overstrong. While my guests enjoyed them, they did not rave or request that these be added to my permanent cooking list.

Rating: 3
This was wondeful! Very juicy and delicious. I used a light colored beer and light brown sugar. I also didn't use coarse salt, just table salt and left it out of the pepper coating. We will definitely be making this again!

Rating: 3
My grill guests raved about it. A touch too salty for my taste. I'd probably keep the salt in the brining liqued and reduce it in the rub. Perhaps even better as leftovers in a sandwich.

Delicious! The most tender pork chops we've ever had. The beer was slightly noticeable and gave a nice depth to the chops. Will definitely make them again.

Excellent recipe! Have made this at least 4+ times. Even for my husband who prefers his meat on the drier side just loves this !Excellent great flavors,easy to prpare,tender & moist!I have made this for dinner/cookouts with friends and everyone raves! I do alot of cooking and entertaining & this is one of my favorite ways to prepare pork. Can also use with chicken.

I was afraid of the salt issue so I ended up brining per instructions a 3 1/2lb. center cut pork roast instead of the chops. Not being a lover of sage I cheated a little by using a rub consisting of the 7 cloves of garlic and 2 teaspoons of Emeril's Original Essence (which you can make by hand or purchase at the market). After the rub I simply wrapped the roast in tin foil leaving some room at the top for circulation, slapped it on the grill until it was done and let it rest for 15 minutes. The result was a delicious, moist, flavorful roast surrounded in wonderful dipping juices. Best of all, it feeds a good crowd.

I made these for a dinner party. Two of the guests asked for the recipe. I will definitely be making these again.

Made this for my wife and in-laws, and everyone was quite pleased. The sage gave it a very nice flavor, and the beer-brine made it very moist. Relatively easy to prepare - will make it again.

Rating: 4
Wonderful flavor, juicy and easy to make. My husband said these were the best pork chops he'd ever eaten - and we live in the heart of pork country (Sauk County, Wisconsin)!

Rating: 4
I thought this recipe was perfect. It produced a tender, juicy pork chop that was full of flavor. With the use of kosher salt I thought the saltiness of the final product was just right. I will definitely make this recipe again and highly recommend it.

Liked this dish for the relatively unusual flavor. Kinda B-B-Qish, but not not quite. I started with nice, thick, center-cut pork chops. Skipped the ice (didn't see the need), used dark molassas(all I had) and cut back a little on the salt(which I recommend). Marinaded 10 hours (while at work), and then again cut back a little on the salt in the rub (which I recommend). Grilled on gas Weber 8 mins. per side then let rest for 8 mins. Perfect (which, for me, is slightly pink at bone). Not salty at all. Moist and flavorfull. Previous reviewer makes an excellent point -- the recipe calls for COARSE (or kosher) salt which has much less salt per volume. If using regular salt (which you shouldn't do) you'll have to cut the amount back by probably half.

I have found that pork brines much faster than poultry and needs about 2 to 3 hours of brining. 4 hours tends to produce a product that is quite salty.

Rating: 0
I haven't made this recipe yet. However, I have been making one that appeared in Gourmet for the last 3 years. I have allowed the chops to stay in the brine solution for up to 4 days and they are wonderful. I use the thick center-cut chops and because the salt causes them to absorb water, they stay very moist during the grilling process. I just grilled them 2 days ago for a dinner. Forgot the wonderful spice rub that goes on at the end and they were still delicious.

Ths is but a variation of the brining and rub recipes found in "The Complete Meat Cookbook" by Aidells and Kelly (an excellent book, by the way). The amounts of salt and liquid are correct. Be certain you use coarse salt; if using table salt, reduce amount by half. If using thinner cuts, shorten brining time, and don't overcook, or the meat will be tough (especially the leaner cuts). Rinse quickly and dry before grilling. This is an excellent way to prepare pork.

I made this recipe cutting back slightly on the salt and marinating them an hour or so longer. While the chops were very moist and tender, I thought they were much too salty. I wanted to try this recipe because I found a recipe on Epicurious for a salt-brined turkey that was out-of-this world.

Rating: 3
Have made this three times and it was terrific each time. Had no problem with the salt amount but did use regular beer unstead of the dark.

Rating: 0
I am interested if anyone sealed the pork in the beer brine overnight. Could this cause the pork to be too salty? Four hours isn't an easy marination time since I work and like to have dinner before midnight :) I welcome any suggestions.

Rating: 0
Can someone at epicurious advise if the amount of salt printed is accurate? I'd be interested in preparing the dish based upon the favorable critiques, however, as some have pointed out the recommended salt ingredient seems very high.

I have never had grilled pork chops this moist and tender. Marvelous dish.

Rating: 2
I give this two forks since I liked it, but even with enormously thick pork chops, they retained a bit too much salt flavor for my tastes. Otherwise, they were quite tender and moist--brining is definitely a great way to keep the meat from drying out while grilling. Next time I will simply cut down on the salt in the rub and compensate by adding more fresh sage and using roasted garlic.

I made these pork chops for my parent's anniversary and they were easy to prepare, yet absolutely deliscious! They were a real hit!

Rating: 4
Excellent pork chops. Tender. Juicy. Tasty. I don't understand the percentage of people who would make this recipe again. Everyone who has responded liked the recipe. Yet there is a percentage that would not make it again. I hope anyone that has negative comments about a recipe would let others know why they would not make it again. Often it is a difference personal likes and dislikes.

These are the best pork chops I have had. Make sure not to over-cook the meat. I will make them many more times.

Rating: 4
The pork was tender, juicy, and flavorful with a minimal amount of work. I used both boneless thin pork chops as well as the thick, bone-in chops. I will cut back on the salt in the rub when grilling the thinner pork chops next time.

Rating: 4
You can always trust Bruce Aidells to come up with fabulous meat recipes! This one is definitely a keeper. The only changed I made was to use fresh sage since I was out of dried. In fact, I only brined them 2 hours instead of 4 and they were still delicious. Tonight I'm using boneless chops and doing the full 4 hour brine.

Rating: 3
I've made this recipe twice with excellent results. The brining makes the chops very moist. The second time we didn't have thick center-cut chops and used smaller loin chops instead. The flavor and results were still delicious.
