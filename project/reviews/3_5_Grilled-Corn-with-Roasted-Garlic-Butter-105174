Super easy...super yummy. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great. The corn was sweet and carmelized. I'll always make corn this way now.

An alright recipe, heavy on the garlic. Tasted good though.

Fantastic and simple. This is the way I prepare corn on the cob from now on!

Good recipe. Another option is removing all but two layers of husk, soaking ears in cool water for 45 minutes and grilling husks on. The corn simultaneously grills and steams and the kernals are protected from scorching by the husks (which, incidentally smell great when burning). The husks peeled back also make a good handle. Shake some cajun spice on the ears after buttering. Make extra and use the roasted garlic butter on EVERYTHING.

Addictive is a very accurate way to describe this dish!! It's amazing what the grill can do to those little kernels. Made this for the 4th, and it was delicious and easy. Did not use oil when roasting garlic though, to cut down the fat. Had some of the garlic butter left over to use on our baked potatos too. Yummy!!

I served this recipe for grilled corn with garlic butter at a party my husband and I hosted recently. Not only is it simple to make, but it was extremely well received. Additionally, I made an herb butter using a stick of regular salted butter and chopped fresh rosemary. I offered guests both options and the roasted garlic compound butter slightly edged out the rosemary butter. Both were fabulous at contributing heightened flavor layers to the wonderful grilled fresh corn.
