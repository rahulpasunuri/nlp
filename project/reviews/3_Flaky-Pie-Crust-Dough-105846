Literally the worst pie crust recipe I've ever made. I actually made it once before and it was terrible then, too, but I decided to give it one more chance. No, it really is bad. It didn't just crack; it broke into six separate pieces when I tried to roll it out, and it somehow ended up with huge holes in the middle (not because it tore, but because it split open). Don't use this recipe. Seriously.

Very hard to work with. Pooled into a mess when I pre-baked after following all the prep instructions.

After freezing and poking the holes as instructed, I baked it at the exact temp suggested and it fell from the sides of the pan and pooled in the center into a big doughy mess. I also found the dough very sticky and hard to work with. The worst pie crust yet!

I had never made a crust before and found it relatively easy. I just wish it rolled easier. It is extremely fragile. I will definitely use it again. I did it all (crust and pie) in the same night. Next time, I may spread it out.

I am not much of a baker but I really could not work with this dough. I too, like a previous reviewer had to form it in the pan and the result was anything but attractive. However, if you can work with it it has a great texture when cooked.

A good-tasting crust though a bit difficult to handle when rolling out. I will try using pastry flour next time to see if it decreases breakage while rolling out. Really flaky and perfect with pumpkin pie!

This recipe is great for folks like me who simply enjoy a tasty thick pie crust. I have a tendency to make all of mypies with a thivker crust than most, and this recipe has become my favorite homemade crust ever. And this crust does crack upon rolling, but I found moderate success by not using my rolling pin as normal, and instead using a COLD wine bottle on its side to roll out crusts. Seems to help me some but not completely. Still my favorite. Throw some vanilla beans in there with the flour & salt & YUMMY!

Dough would not roll out & had to be pressed into pan, but it was flaky & tasty.

Great recipe. Dough has a tendency to break during rolling, but this isn't really a problem.

This was so easy and very flaky. I will definitely use this recipe for other pies, but we enjoyed it with the pumpkin pie brulee.
