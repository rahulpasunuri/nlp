I've made this recipe for at least 3 Easters. The flavors are simple and good, IMO; my young children like it, too. I purchase the lamb from Central Market (it's more natural, though not necessarily organic) and use fresh organic herbs and fresh garlic, probably double the amount called for. I've never tried making a Greek version, so I can't compare as to which tastes better. I've even made this the day before (Saturday), to then be reheated and eaten for Sunday lunch, and it worked out great! One year we did a Russian Orthodox- themed Easter: this lamb recipe, mashed potatoes, carrots, plus homemade challah bread and pashka cheese (to spread on the bread...yummmm!).

This dish was so simple and impressed all my friends. I think if this one turns out so-so for you, it is because you did not use first rate ingredients such as fresh herbs and garlic, and a really nice piece of lamb.

Poured off most of fat from pan, and made gravy with the drippings, some broth, a little wine, and dried thyme. Not the best leg of lamb I've ever made, but good. My husband loved it. Might make it again, if he requests.

I made this dish for my boyfriend and I last night. Like the cook from Boston, I too thought that some coarse chopped garlic and rosemary would add splendid flavor. I also splashed some chardonay on with the herb mixture to give it a little extra zing. I paired it with herb roasted red bliss potatoes and a goat cheese vinagarette spring salad. Came out EXCELLENT!!! Even the nacho cheese and spam loving palette of my boyfriend approved. Will deffinetly make again.

My first review, I couldn't resist. I'm Greek Orthodox, and not to knock the Russian recipe it's simlpy bland! The Russians didn't have have the herbs, garlic, etc. of the mediterrean. Try the same recipe w/ spermint, greek oregano, garlic, and rosemary....Yummmm!!! Best Regards....Richard Boston, MA
