I found this soooo boring. There are so many recipe more worthy of fresh garden beets.

I'm in love with beets now! I made large dice of the beets and cucumber and onion, then mixed all together in bowl with dressing and refrigerated for several hours. I knew this would color everything red/pink but it was a family dinner so I wasn't concerned. I actually liked the way it looked and in the end, everything was able to soak up more flavor from the dressing and it was easy to get a serving that included everything rather than picking from this layer and that layer. Even the kids ate it and loved it, they had seconds! I expected to have leftovers but there was nothing left except to lick the bowl.

Delicious, easy. I may add some crumbled goat cheese next time but the salad is perfect as is.

Absolutely fantastic!!! I love beets and have been looking for just the right dressing to serve them with in a salad. This dressing is wonderful, just added some extra mustard because it was a little too sweet for my taste. Both dughter and I wolfed it down. Will defenitely make over and over.

I first made this 2 years ago, and then lost track of the issue it was in. This is an amazing salad, and great with the fresh beets from the Farmers Markets. Roast the beets, skin, slice and freeze them for wintertime use.

I am always on the lookout for easy recipes that take a few simple ingredients and mix them together in an unusual way to create something wonderful. This is one of those recipes. The sweetness and soft texture of the beets contrasts nicely with the mild flavor and crunch of the cucumbers. It looks gorgeous. The vegetables can be prepared ahead of time and assembled right before dinner (I mixed the cooked beets with the salad dressing right in a plastic container and placed them in the fridge. Ditto with the cucumbers.) and the salad was delicious even though I used really pathetic supermarket vegitables.

The dressing got such good reviews that I tried it using the regular cucumbers and canned sliced beets that were already on hand, as well as the sweet onion. Liked it a lot, and am already looking forward to using it with the cukes and roasted beets called for in the original recipe. An excellent accompaniment to the German sausages we served for our Oktoberfest dinner.

I just made the dressing for a spinach salad. Very good. I wanted something creamy so I added a bit of f/f plain yogert and a dash of garlic powder. Yummmmmmm!

for peeling the beets,save your tin foil. just cut off the ends season with oil salt & pepper and cook to the recipe. the skin will keep in more flavor and moisture.

I actually love beets, but didn't have time to make them, so just made the dressing for a plain-jane salad and it was really nice! I can't wait to try it on the salad the way it was meant to be! One thing though - I decreased the honey by 1 teaspoon as it sounded like it was going to be a bit sweet for my liking.

An excellent dish! The dressing has deservedly won rave reviews. I also LOVED the flavor, texture and quality of the roasted beets in this recipe so much more than the usual boiled beets. I must confess that I made this dish to spice up another beet salad that I saw on Sara's Secrets, which only called for beets, toasted walnuts, Italian parsley, and oil and vinegar. Using the leftovers, I added the cucumber, vidalia, and honey-dijon dressing made with walnut oil rather than corn oil. Magnifique!

I don't much like beets, and I didn't like these beets either. But I did love the dressing, and I'll be making that again...

A cool and refreshing salad and easy to make.... I served as a side along with a spicy Thai meal.

I must confess I did not make the salad. My husband does not like beets. However, I made a salad of romaine lettuce, sweet onion, tomato & bacon. The dressing was fabulous!!! I will repeat the dressing recipe for sure!
