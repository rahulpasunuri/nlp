This soup is fantastic. I used canned beans and skipped the first part of the recipe - added the bay leaf and fresh rosemary to the soup for about 20 minutes; it added a nice flavor.

I made this soup as it said with Chorizo. I didn't care for it much. I would recommend strongly considering italian sausage instead. The rosemary bean mixture with fresh thyme would have been quite good with something less strong spanish sausage.

The whipping cream is NOT necessary! Just puree some beans. Italian sausage good alternative to chorizo also. Yummy!!

I made this exactly as written and it turned out very good. Great hearty soup, wonderful flavor from the chorizo. Would make again!

This soup was so good...really flavorfull. The only change I made was due to the fact I had no chicken stock; so, after removing the bay leaf and the rosemary I cooked it down a little more for about a half an hour. Then I reserved all the liquid and added enough water to equal the 6 cup liquid total and 2 tablespoons of Knorr chicken boullion powder. The soup was good even before the cream and chorizo went in, I will make this over and over!!

Really good! Omitted the rosemary and upped the amount of cream a teensy bit. Next time I will puree a little less for more texture, but overall a very nice recipe.

This recipe was fantastic - your spice comes entirely from your chorizo, so make sure you are familiar with the heat/spice of the chorizo you are working with. I upped the quantity of mirepoix a bit to get a heartier soup. And because you puree most of the bean mixture, I found it safe to cheat and use canned beans - just add them in the last 5 minutes instead of the full 25 min. Foodies raved about this soup!

Great! I really like this soup: tasty, velvety...just plain yummy! I leave out the cream because I don't think it adds anything in terms of flavor or texture. I can definitely recommend this soup.

Excellent tasting soup. Next time I'll use Italian sausage just because it suits my taste more.

I shortened the process by using 2 cans of white beans, which I prefer to cannellini because they are smaller and easier to eat due to their size. Also used a combo of hot and mild Italian sausage. We loves it, particularly because it has no pasta in it, a nice change.

This is one of my favorite soup recipes. I always add extra carrots, and I don't bother with the cream. It doesn't really need it. Bulk venison sausage works great, especially if the butcher spices it up with extra chili pepper. I'm off to soak some beans so I can make another pot tomorrow...

I just discovered this soup and have already made it twice. The first time I was in a hurry and made the soup with canned cannellini beans and thought is was great. The second time, I made the soup according to the recipe and thought the taste reflected the extra effort. Either way though, this is a good soup recipe. Also, we have a few vegetarians in the family so I replaced the chorizo with soy chorizo from Trader Joes and used soy creamer as well. It worked.

I make this frequently and use canned beans and spicy Italian chicken sausage. It is always great.

Excellent cold night soup. I didn't have time to soak the beans so I used canned cannellini instead. I drained some of them and mashed them with a potato masher since I don't have a blender. I did get fresh chorizo, although if you wanted the soup to be vegetarian you could definitely leave it out and it would be delicious. I only added a drop of half and half which worked well and wasn't overly creamy. I have lots leftover so I'm going to freeze it for another cold night, yummm!

Wonderful winter soup, with subtle flavors. I made this recipe exactly as is. No changes or substitutions, as I have access to fresh chorizo nearby. Also, I don't know how much rosemary another person here put in, but a sprig is sprig and definitely did not overpower anything. Next time, I may not puree as much, as I like having more texture. My only problem with the soup is that it is far too labor-intensive. A soup should be one pot and fairly simple. This one involved way too many pots, pans and appliances. But overall a very good soup and not at all spicy or hot.

Rating: 0
This has become one of my favorite bean soup recipes. I omit the cream because I find it unneccesary. I use bulk chorizo because it's easier, but any sausage works. You can even use a smoked turkey keilbasa type sausage if you dice and brown it before you add it to the soup. I simply stick blend right in the pot. Enjoy!

I found this recipe to be both extremely satisfying and very much of a comfort food. I did make some slight changes to the recipe. I cooked the beans as directed, however when it came to making the soup I used 3 leeks and some extra celery and left out the carrots and onions. Also I used 1/2 a lb of pancetta which i cooked till crispy and then reserved then cooked the leeks in its drippings till slightly golden then added in celery and garlic and continued as directed. For the sausages I used a mixture of 1/2 sweet 1/2 spicy. When i served I passed around both the sausage and pancetta so that people could top with their choice. Both worked equally well

This is a wonderful fall/winter comfort food. Creamy, spicy, flavorful and healthy! I use jarred great northern beans (easy) and crumbled sage-flavored breakfast sausage duted with less than 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper instead of chorizo. The sage seasoning is terrific with the rosemary! And the cayenne adds the nice "kick" Also didnt use the cream (why add fat?) and it was wonderful. I have made this many times to rave reviews.

This is a good basic recipe that can be adjusted in many ways. I added a tablespoon of salzon and two cups of chopped collards and got the flavor I was looking for. Some minced red pepper gives it a colorful spark.

Very ordinary and I used dried beans and grilled the sausage. Not worth the time it took to make. You'd like the recipe more if you really enjoy the flavor of rosemary.....

Sorry, not impressed! Tasted bland and uninteresting, even after I tinkered with the recipe by adding extra galic, salt, etc. I used a top notch chorizo, so that wasn't the problem... the fact that this is a dull recipe was!!

My husband & I have made this soup twice now - delicious both times... we LOVE it! We believe that using dried beans is essential because they become infused with the rosemary & garlic as they cook. We use sweet Italian sausage removed from the casings and crumbled. This soup served with the Olive & Parm cornbread (recipe also in same issue) and paired with a nice Cali Pinot Noir made a scrumptious, hearty meal that we shared with our best friends... everyone asked for the recipe!

Don't be afraid of salt! It did lack a bit, but I did use spicy chicken sausage I had on hand. Next time I will use chorizo, and I was thinking to add a head of roasted garlic.

This wasnt bad, however, it makes quite a bit. I used canned beans to save time. It was too spicy. Next time I will make it with a milder sausage.

Not overly impressed. Perhaps the chorizo used could be the problem, will try with spicy Italian sausage next time.

We really enjoy this soup during the winter months. I, like others, used canned beans in a pinch, with good results. I also suggest topping it off with a cilantro oil, pepper jack cheese and a sprinkle of chipolte chili powder. I make buttermilk, chorizo cornbread to serve with it and pair it with a really nice Spanish dry Riesling or Garnacha/Tempranillo blend, if you want red wine.

We've had with Chorizo & hot Italian. Both are great. A wonderful comfort food dish.

The only reason this got only three forks is because, for me, the "hot" Italian sausage substitue was just a bit too spicy. I'm going to try it with sweet Italian sausage next time. This a new favorite recipe of mine that I'll be passing on to my family and friends.

Rating: 3
Delicious bean soup. I followed the advice of others - adding additional thyme, fresh italian parsley and some dried oregano for flavor. I deglazed the pan with white wine after sauteeing the vegetables and didn't add all of the beans to the pot with the bean liquid and stock so they would still be firm. I used an immersion blender, but removed most of the carrot and onion before blending so the soup would be chunky, rather than smooth. Added some swiss chard at the end and omitted the cream and the sausage. Great winter soup.

Rating: 4
Wow, this is a great soup; really lovely. I did not add the cream and while I may one day try it with, I don't plan to. Making this is a lengthy process but it's well worth it. I've not made a soup with white beans before and am delighted with the results and that you do puree this one. I too nixed the chorizo this time (but have used it & do enjoy it) and opted for hot italian sausage out of convenience during shopping. It was still great. Err, these folks who say it was bland, threw it out...what the? I followed the recipe as specified and added some black pepper during cooking/second simmer, some extra thyme and all went well. Still, suit to taste and I may change it up next time. I will definitely make it again and have already forwarded on to others. Cheers.

It's not that this soup didn't taste good, because it did. It just didn't taste good ENOUGH for me to be dying to make it again. The results seemed on the mediocre side, and while the soup was easy enough to make, it took a while to put it together.

Amazing! I changed 2 things slightly, I used canned beans instead and used sweet sausage instead...but this recipe is a hit in my house, it's absolutely amazing!

This was delicious! And very forgiving of deviations. I did the 'quick soak' method for my dried beans, ran low on the cooking liquid so I didn't 'drain & reserve', and I just stuck my stick-blender directly in the soup (before adding the chorizo) and gave it a few blends. I guess I'm a lazy cook, which makes this a perfect recipe for me! Everyone loved it.

I made this soup exactly as stated the first time and didn't think it had enough flavor - even with great mexican chorizo. The second time I made it I used 3 cans of Great Northern beans instead of dried, replaced the thyme with 3/4 cup fresh cilantro (stirred in just before serving), and added 1 cup of fresh corn. It was a huge hit this time and full of great mexican flavor!

Terrific. I agree that "comfort food" is an apropro category. I'm sure other sausages would work, but give chorizo a try, even if it does look odd. It gives it a great flavor.

This is one of our favorite comfort food soups. I use smoked chourico (portuguese sausage) and just dice it and brown it to render off some fat before adding it to the soup. I love to make this soup on Sundays. I find it much less time consuming if I can remember to sok the beans overnight, rather than quick soak them on the day I make it. My husband says it cures colds!!!

This dish was a two day process but it was well worth it. It is perfect for a cool day paired with a good ciabatta bread or a warm crusty bread. The soup has a wonderful flavor. I followed the recipe as it was written and it was extremely flavorful. The one exception I made was with the sausage; could not find chorizo at Publix so I used spicy Italian sausage. Would definitely make again.

I loved this recipe. I'm surprised how many people are not using the chorizo though. You really should give it a try, it really adds a good flavor. One reviewer said that after she cooked it it looked bad so she didn't use it. It does look bad and it wouldn't be good by itself but it is good in this soup.

I fixed this soup before any reviews appeared, so followed it exactly. Loved every spoonful, and am never afraid of a little heavy cream. As Julia would say, I'd rather have a small bite of something good than a huge helping of something average. While it's easy to use canned beans, they really are better soaked fresh overnight. Nevertheless, shortcuts or not, this soup is a keeper.

Like the previous reviewer, I made some changes to make it fast & easy. I halved the recipe, and used two cans of beans and l/2 lb. of hot Italian sausage. I simmered one can of beans with the sauteed vegetables & bay leaf & liquid, and then pureed the second can of beans and added that (I'm happy with chunky carrots & celery). I didn't bother with the cream - didn't think it needed it, and fewer fat grams. At the end I threw in l/2 head of sliced escarole because (1) I had it on hand, and (2) I wasn't serving a salad so the escarole added some green nutrition. My husband and I both thought it was a real winner!

I'm eating leftovers right this moment. I made a few changes and the soup is marvelous. I used 2 small cans of white beans, added the bay leaf to the soup as it was cooking, and used half pound of ground chorizo. After adding the stock and one can of beans (let it cook for a few) I roughly blended with my stick blender, and added the 2nd can. The soup is so creamy like this it doesn't need the cream.

Very good bean recipe. I made it over 2 nights. I also used andouille sausage because I had a few links leftover, very tasty. I think I will try using canned beans next time to cut down on the cooking time.

Delicious! I made the recipe as directed with the exception of substituting hot Italian sausage for the chorizo. The only problem was the beans not being fully cooked at the 1.5 hour mark. I used navy beans and added about ½ hour to the first cooking time. The results were fabulous, and the soup freezes beautifully too!

We loved the soup and I'd definitely make it again. Usually I use fresh herbs and non-prepared food items but due to a snow storm made due with my pantry. I used 1 cup each of diced carrots, celery, and onion and 3 chopped garlic cloves. I sauted this in 2 TBSP of olive oil and added 48 oz of chicken broth with 1 rounded TBSP of herbs de provance, 1 tsp pepper, and 1/2 tsp. salt. I threw in 2 cans of drained, pured white northern beans and simmered 45 minutes. I sauted 5 links of Italian sausage, sliced them, and added these to the soup with a can of small white beans. I simmered for another 20 minutes and served freshly grated locatelli (romano) cheese and crusty Italian bread.

A great basic list of ingredients. I made this over a stormy weekend and it was a hit! I substituted canned beans for soaked and andouille sausage for chorizo (faster! cheaper!).

made this yesterday, only change being to use hot italian sausage as my market didn't have the other. Delicious. I think next time I might puree less of the soup or add more veggies to it. I'm wondering for those who are having the lack of bean broth issue, if they might be either cooking the beans at too high a temp, or not soaking them long enough. I had plenty of liquid left.

This was a good bean soup recipe. I had to add a lot more stock to keep the pot from burning and to have enough bean liquid left over, but other than that it was very good. It did take a little more effort however, than I might like for bean soup....

Yummy!!!!! I made this with andouille because I like it much better than chorizo (though chorizo is nice). Like the previous reviewer, I wasn't left with the prescribed amount of liquid at the end of the bean-cooking time, but adding extra stock made up the difference. Also, I like more rustic-textured bean soups so I ran about 1.5 cups of the beans through my food mill instead of the stick blender. I will definitely make this again! It is true comfort food.

I've made this recipe twice already and given out the recipe to several friends. The only thing I changed was I used canned small white beans just to save time and I prefer small beans. The one reviewer who complained Definitely a keeper.

I soaked the beans overnight as recipe calls for. I cooked the beans in the slow cooker for several hours and the liquid did not evaporate. I used Spanish Chorizo which is not as spicy as Mexican Chorizo. My children and husband raved about it and can't wait until I make it again. I would highly recommend this recipe.

Did anybody else have the problem where the 8 cups of water evaporated? I measured 8 cups and simmered the beans and after 1 hour and 10 minutes all the water was gone. I'm not sure how I'm supposed to reserve 2 cups of cooking liquid when the liquid evaportated. I hate when I make a recipe and it doesn't work out - it's very frustrating. I'm going to continue making the soup tonight. I'll just use extra broth in place of the bean water.

I love this soup! I made it for the Super Bowl and everyone just gobbled it up. Its very hearty and while it says it makes six servings, I thought it made more like 8 - though people had been snacking. It is the perfect soup for a cold day. I cut the cream in half and used spicy Italian sausage as the store was out of uncooked Chorizo. It was so good I am making it for a friend tomorrow! Enjoy this one!
