Having no access to champagne grapes, made this with half split black grapes, and part pomegranate seeds that I softened up by sauteeing in butter (in other words, added the whole pom-butter mix). With my scallops (I only had bay scallops available, go figure) it was almost, but not quite, an overpowering mixture of different flavors. Definitely file under "advance tastes" in the recipe book.

Presents beautifully. Artful flavors. Easy. I used the black grapes and about half the butter. It was still plenty rich. I augmented the sauce with water and wondra at the very end.

Fantastic dish! I have had this recipe in my collection for a couple of years and did not make it until a month ago. It has become my summer dish - my guests, and especially my husband, just loved this dish. You cannot beat the presentation and if all your ingredients are ready to go this dish comes together very quickly and easily - to rave reviews! This is a 10 fork dish!

Wow! This recipe is absolutely amazing. I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe (quality scallops are key though). Very impressive dish that I can't wait to serve as a first course to dinner guests this weekend.

I was happy to see champagne grapes in season again so I could pull out this recipe. It's quick and flavorful. I buy extra scallops and serve as a main course with rice.

We love scallops and this was a fast delicious dinner. I made the full amount of sauce with 12 scallops and we split it in half for dinner. Delicious with herbed buttered noodles.

Quite nice. Very easy to make, just make sure you use fresh scallops. Four scallops for each person with a salad and a side dish is a full meal, not a first course.

This is a fairly easy, amazing tasting recipe for scallops. Rich. If you're making it as a starter, keep the portions small. I used black grapes cut in half, but when I do come across some champagne grapes, I'll make it again.

So easy and tasty (if you like sea scallops). Use only the freshest sea scallops, and don't overcook. I have trouble finding champagne grapes, so substitute seedless sweet red grapes, halved. The guests were amazed, and this dish has become a regular in my repertoire.

I also made this as a New Years appetizer, and it was great. Follow the directions and you'll do fine. This could easily be increased a little bit and be a main dish, which I might do in the future. Definately not flavorless, guests loved it.

Really wonderful and so easy! Only change I would make is to double the sauce. Will make this again, for certain!

Definitely fabulous! Used the black grapes cut into quarters, seared the scallops on high heat -- it was just for two of us, so we halved everything but the butter - PERFECT !!! Would definitely serve to guests.

This easy-to-prepare recipe was a big success with my guests. I pre-prepared the grape and almond-mix and put it in the pan again after I cooked the scallops. I skipped the parsley but will all the other flavor, it didn't need it at all!!

Absolutely lovely starter, so quick and easy to prepare! Light, delicate flavours - ideal to serve before a heavier main course.

So easy and so wonderful, everyone loved it, we have a new family favorite. I used red seedless grapes and cut them into 4 pieces.

This was a great dish to make. Something different for a scallop dish.I used Concord grapes (i took out the seeds) and it was very flavorful. This is definitely a keeper.
