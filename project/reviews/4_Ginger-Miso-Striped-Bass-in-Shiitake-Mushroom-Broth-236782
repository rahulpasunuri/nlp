I will definitely make this again, easy, healthy, and really quite elegant.

Excellent! Sprinkled with nanami togarashi to add a little bit of kick at the finish. Love it.

Great recipe. Easy, great flavors and textures. My only changes were I used corn meal instead of panko as I am gluten free and added bonito flakes to the miso broth to kick up the flavor.

Loved it!!! Excellent my kids loved it as well. I added three extra cups of water to the miso.

My husband goes fishing for striped bass often, and I'm always looking for a recipe that takes away the fishy taste: this is our new favorite! It's super easy to make and absolutely delicious. I made no changes to the original recipe.

Wow this was delicious. This was the main dish in a 4 course asian seafood dinner for my stepdad's birthday and was a MASSIVE HIT with everyone. Great flavours, great textures, and little preparation time. We used black cod instead of bass, and used very wide bowls so that the panko on the fish would just sit on top of the mushrooms and stay crispy, as opposed to sinking into the broth and getting soggy. What a fantastic dish.

Loved this recipe. Fiance said it was better than restaurant quality. I added udon noodles and had a side of seaweed salad. Will definitely make this again. My filet was a thick cut so I had to cook it significantly longer than recipe suggested. @kimberlyhamill

This was really tasty, although more work than I expected from reading the recipe. The crust on the fish was fantastic--I'm going to try roasting it next time and see if it works. I used packaged miso soup and would like to try real miso next time. Added udon and it was tasty but a tad too filling. Will definitely make again!

This recipe was so good, that for the first time ever I've decided to write a review. I did have to make some changes for what I had on hand...yellow miso instead of red, cod instead of bass, a mix of shiitake and cremini mushrooms...it turned out beautifully. I also sauteed some cut up bok choy in a pan and added that to the soup so it was more substantial. My husband said it was by far my most successful culinary experiment ever and we can't wait to try it again...maybe with scallops next time? I think the flavors will go. DEEELISH. And so easy to make!

Entire family loved this dish including two young teenagers. Easy to make, few ingredients. Quality in flavor, texture, and presentation as good as any restaurant. Only problem is there was not enough. Everyone wanted seconds!

Everyone loved this! Made it twice, first time with brown rice and sauteed spinach, second with udon and no one liked the udon noodles. Does not taste as good the day after so eat it up the first time!

I loved this recipe, as did my kids. I ended up using sole, as it was all my store had. I was worried about it falling apart in a pan so broiled it and it was surprisingly delicious.

Delicious. I usually add some udon to the broth to make it a hardier meal.

This recipe has made it into my regular rotation. I've simplified it by using ginger paste and miso instant soup mixes. I usually use tilapia. My changes make it cheaper and easier to make.

I thought this was terrific. Like the previous reviewer, I also used cod instead of bass. Served it with some braised bok choy and stir-fried tofu on the side. A light but very flavorful and fulfilling meal.

The flavors are subtle which I would expect from an Asian inspired dish. I served it using True Cod filets instead of the bass. Very nice!
