Love this recipe. Starting making it four years ago and have been making it a every Thanksgiving ever since. The pairing of the turkey with the pear juice and the rum for the gravy are exceptional. The brining of the turkey the day before makes it amazingly tender and moist. My only recommendation is not to put as much kosher salt as the recipe calls for in the water. I usually only put 1 1/2 pound and it's worked out better for me. You really should try it!

The turkey was much too salty. Based on the previous reviews I used only half of the salt yet I still found the turkey and herbs overpowered by the salt. I'll look for another brine recipe.

The salt to water ratio was off. My bird turned out way too salty. Instead of 1 pound of salt to 1 gallon of water I'm going to try 0.75 or even 0.5. Maybe a smoker designed this recipe!

I made this recipe two thanksgivings ago and it was delicious! A bit salty so when I make it again I will most definitely cut back on the salt. The gravy was very good. Last year I tried another 'brine' & it was not as good as this one. This year I am going with this recipe. By the way I fry my turkey and its even better.

Now our Thanksgiving Tradition! Brine makes the turkey extra tender and juicy, and I find that it cooks more quickly too. Even my children love this one! Wouldn't do Thanksgiving without this recipe. The BEST

Followed the proportions and timing - the turkey was nearly inedibly salty. This was my first attempt at brining a turkey - and it will be my last.

This was my first attempt at brining a turkey, though my husband did it the last 2 Thankgsivings quite successfully, and it came out without a hitch! I did follow another reviewer's advice and used 3 cups kosher salt and 1 cup brown sugar in the brine to make sure it wasn't too salty and it was perfect. Moist, flavorful and delicious. The gravy was fantastic! Try this recipe!

Didn't make the gravy but the turkey brine was the best I've tried. Will make this again.

I just did the turkey (not the gravy) and it turned out so well -- my first time cooking a turkey!

We've grilled "Brimed" turkey and chicken a number of times----suggest you refer to recipe "foolproof grilled chicken"---they suggest you add the salt & sugar and THEN boil and let cool plus a wonderful vinegerette--that would probably eleminate the salty taste---we also brime for 12-24 hours-we've had great luck and got rave reviews

We used a Heritage turkey for this recipe which turned out great. There was a lot of herb flavor with out adding more herbs to the roasting pan but the pear gravy was OK. The gravy did not have even a slight pear flavor.

I made a test turkey the weekend before Thanksgiving day with a 12 lb turkey. The wing meat was very salty even after a rinse and pat down with a kitchen towel. The Wednesday evening before Thanksgiving I prepared a 23 lb turkey, but reduced the salt in the brine by 30 percent. Perfect!! The meat was very moist and flavorful and the gravy received many compliments from my 28 guests.

I needed to put my turkey into a 2 gallon bag to brine, so we used just 1 cup of salt, plus water to fit. The result was moist and delicious. Not salty. And the gravy was a major hit.

I loved this!! I found the bird perfect, the gravy just a bit salty. My husband says it's his favorite turkey ever.

This was the worst turkey I have ever made, it was so salty as to be unedible. We are actually throwing it away. The salt ruined the gray and the dressing as well. I was told after the fact that in brining you must use sugar which was left out of the recipe.

Unbelievable - brining is the way to go. I added 3 cups kosher salt and 1 cup brown sugar, which was perfect so that the drippings were not too salty. However, do not cook it at 400degrees as this will burn your drippings. I would try 350 and turn the turkey ever 30 minutes so that all 4 sides get crispy and brown.Family and friends were blown away by how moist the turkey was.

I made a different turkey, but wanted to try this gravy for the pear flavor. It was easy to make and delicious.

For all you trying this recipe! I was given a tip on how to not make it so salty! Just add 1 cup of sugar!

I found that a brine made with a half cup of salt and a quarter cup of sugar per gallon of water is the way to go regardless of herbs and spices used.

I think the brine was way too strong. I did this successfully with a roasting chicken, but used only 1/4 cup salt to a gallon of water.

A friend of mine has a similar recipe. I loved the gravy, but the bird was way too salty.
