This was really easy, I followed the recipe exactly. It was not runny at all but perfect consistency.

Way too sweet and runny, had to add some cream cheese to thicken enough to work with. Nothing special flavour-wise, I prefer a cream cheese frosting for my cupcakes.

I did not have any problem making this recipe. I do believe that the reason way some had runny, is because you added all the milk. I added a little at a time. In witch I had some left over. My Butter Cream turned out, very Creamy, Smooth,and Delicious! What a Wonderful Recipe! Taste just like you got it from the Bakery. I would give it more stars, but you can only go up to 5.This is a 50 Star from 1- 50.

I had the same problem as the first reviewer - too much liquid and then it didn't blend well. Ours too, looked like a broken emulsification and was quite the drippy mess. Tasted ok, but not a pleasure to behold in the least. Can anyone shed some light on what we could have done wrong?

I must have done something wrong. The frosting had way too much liquid. I think 1-2 T. milk would have been better. The mess I got looked like a broken emulsion. Sloppy. I removed about half of the mix, then added about a pound of sugar and another cup of butter. Any ideas about why mine was such a mess? I double checked the ingredients.

This really is a great recipe. And, as others have noted, I used whipping cream instead of milk. I'm all about some whipping cream! :) I also used about 1 tablespoon (vs. teaspoon) of vanilla. Delish! :)

I love this recipe! It is easy and tastes great! I use heavy cream instead of milk, but add a lot more vanilla. Use a good quality vanilla and real butter. I also add the vanilla before the sugar to help with the mixing. The butter has to be at room temp and creamed very well (fluffy) in order to incorporate all of the sugar, and beat it very well with the cream. It will be a beautiful, soft consistency. If you want to decorate with it, you have to cool it or add merengue powder to it, though I haven't tried this.

Super easy. I used whipping cream instead of milk and added a little dark corn syrup. Easily the best vanilla frosting I've every made or eaten.

I use 1 lb. salted butter a bit cooler than room temperature. 1-2 lb. bag of powdered sugar. 1 tablespoon Mexican vanilla, 1 teaspoon almond. Combine in stand up mixer and slowly add heavy cream to consistency speed up the mixer and whip to fluff up. I like to add a piped border to my cakes so don't overdo the cream. Fantastic on chocolate cake. made his dozens of times, always rave reviews and requests for the recipe.

Paired this frosting with a chocolate sourdough cake...excellent!

I am going to agree with Previous. Using this recipe to a T, as well as adding what ever flavor you like is Phenom...I am a frosting snob and for Butter Cream this is the easiest and the best consistency I have found in a long while and I have tried tons, all using my Kitchen Aid mixer and most came out soupy and like icing..you need to use this recipe right to get the fluff. be gentle when adding flavor as you may need to just add a mit more butter and confectioners sugar to balance the fluffiness. enjoy

I thought this recipe was brilliant. It's far easier than many butter cream frosting recipes I've seen. I disagree with those who said to use 2.5 cups of powdered sugar; I used all four cups and found it to be perfect consistency (Frosting is going to be sweet no matter what you do to it, after all). The only modification I made was to use cream instead of milk. I've also found this recipe takes other flavours well; I made it with orange and orange-blossom water and it was marvelous.

I like how simple this recipe is, and it's very easy to make minor adjustments for preference. I used margarine and 1.5% milk. I also replaced about 2dl of the sugar with vanilla sugar which isn't quite as sweet and has more vanilla flavour (this is a common ingredient in Scandinavia, not sure if it can be found elsewhere but definitely worth it). I added some flour to make it thicker and was liberal with the milk. Making it as is would be extremely sweet, and would taste basically just like powdered sugar, but everyone's frosting preferences are different so I think this recipe is a good a starting point.

This was very close to the kind of icing you buy in the tubs at the store. Maybe a tad less sweet then store bought but still pretty sweet. The 2 forks=GOOD and it was good, easy to handle, frosted well. I made it just as written except used 1/2 tsp vanilla and almond vs. all vanilla. I wish I had read the reviews first so I could have decreased the sugar as it was pretty sweet. It is not a decorators frosting, but very soft so it will ice a cake/cupcakes well but not work for a border.

Love this recipe. I made it exactly as written, and it came out exactly as I remember buttercream on my cakes as a child. It's definitely topping out the sweetness scale, but when used sparingly on a light cake, it's divine!

Used 2.5c powdered sugar and 1/4c skim milk (what I had), per other reviews. Still quite sweet. Great easy frosting! Made enough for over 2 doz cupcakes.

I used 2.5 cups of confectioner's sugar and 4 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of white shortening for stability. I followed the rest of the recipe. This made enough to decorate a dozen cupcakes. It's light and not overly sweet.

I made this according to the recipe and it was a big hit with kids and adults alike. I used it for filling between brownie-based cookie sandwiches. The frosting was neither grainy or lumpy (I used a fairly high setting on the hand mixer). If you don't have fond memories of super sweet buttercream frosted birthday cakes and fighting to see who got the corner piece, then this isn't the frosting recipe for you. I will make this again.

I was looking for a white icing recipe that was quick - a full out buttercream is also a little too heavy and rich for my kids' 'birthday cake' tastes; so this seemed promising. Following the earlier reviews, I used 2.5 cups sugar - which was more than enough. I can't imagine using 4 c. I substituted 1 tsp white shortening for 1 tsp of the butter - after creaming the butter -to ensure creaminess for the kids and measured 1/3 c heavy cream instead of the milk, using almost all of it, while whipping the icing, to the consistency I liked. We used it to ice the white cupcakes recipe from epicurious - which is not too sweet and can handle a sweet icing. The end result was absolutely delicious and the kids adored it. I should mention that I used the whipping attachment on a kitchenaid stand mixer, which might have made a difference in the end result.

I followed the suggestions:2.5 c confectioner's sugar and 1/4 c milk(i used heavy cream for a little more body) and the sweetness and consistency are just right. Make sure to cream your butter first. This is not a groundbreak mind-blowing recipe, but it tastes good, colors well and it's super easy, so it's a great standby.

hey now this recipe as is sucks, but if you add flour for consistency then it will not. I experimented tonight,so I would not have to go to the store... I added cake flour until it was frosting like instead of glaze like. It worked well and is 6 -year-old approved. Then I added red and yellow color and make scary Halloween cupcakes for kids so bring on the sweet!

I TOTALLY AGREE THAT IT IS TOO SWEET AND ITS MORE LIKE A CLUMPY GLAZE THEN A FROSTING

Rating: 2
I agree it is too sweet. If you reduce the surgar, you must also reduce the milk or you have runny frosting. Also - the recipe should say creme the butter and then add the other ingredients - otherwise it may not all mix and get fluffy. Dissappointing - find another recipe.

Glad I read the reviews. I used 2.5 cups of powdered sugar instead of 4. It was still on the verge of being too sweet. I really think 4 cups has to be a misprint for the recipe. This is a fast, easy butter cream recipe that I will use again when I want fast and easy.

I used this to frost a chocolate banana cake. For those with an Asian palate* for sweetness versus American palate, half the sugar. Also be a little more liberal with the salt if you like the contrast between the sweetness and saltiness of the frosting. * Asian palate = generally, Asian desserts are less sweet than American desserts. To suit my and my Asian friends' palates, I notice that I generally have to half the sugar content of the American desserts found on Epicurious.

This was the most disgusting buttercream frosting ever. I had to add extra butter and cream cheese to make it edible. I cut the sugar in half and was still too sweet. YUCK!

This is a great, easy frosting. For people who are complaining that it's too sweet, let me remind you that this is frosting. Frosting is sweet. You want less sweet, use less of it. I added way more vanilla than called for just coz I like the extra vanilla flavour. It comes out 'shinyish' and almost pure white. It's ever so slightly gritty (just a bit) in texture on the tongue but I like that. It's real pretty. I will definitely makes this again.

This is an awful recipe, overly sweet and becomes hard after only an afternoon in the fridge. There is no quick way to do a butter cream frosting.

I use 2 - 2.5 cups of sugar (depending on consistency I want) and sometimes use half vanilla and half almond extract. This is great frosting for my favorite cinnamon rolls. Everyone loves this frosting recipe. Easy to use and tastes great.

very good! I made a quadruple batch in the standing mixer, and ended up tweeking the sugar and milk a bit for consistancy, (less sugar, more milk) but the flavor was great and the frosting was thick but easy to spread. I will definitely make this again.

This was waaaay too sweet. I think that I will follow another reviewer's suggestion and start at three cups of powdered sugar. It literally hurt my teeth. Consistency was good, and it was easy to work with. Just not easy to eat.

Very easy and quite good. I was careful not to add too much milk to make it too soft; texture turned out perfect. In general, I love sweet recipes, but next time I make this, I'll start tasting after 3 cups and see how much more is needed. I added some lemon curd to half to see how it would taste - was great.

Icing wasn't stiff enough to use for "Brain Cupcakes", even after refrigeration.

Rating: 3
This is a great recipe! I only added half the amount of milk as I wanted it to be a bit more stiff. However, note that this is a butter cream frosting, not the regular super-sweet icing frosting that comes out really stiff when you pipe it from a pastry bag. I also had to refrigerate the cupcakes after icing it because it was too soft.
