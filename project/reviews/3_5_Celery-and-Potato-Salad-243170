I must really like a LOT of eggs and mayo, because I thought this was a little bland. I think using the celery leaves would have helped with the texture, which I didn't do. Overall just meh to me.

The whole family liked this. The malt vinegar added a nice note of tangy sweetness but if you are not a fan of it you may want to halve the amount.

Nothing special... Tossing the vinegar with the potatoes is a nice way to ensure you don't get too much acid, but other than that, meh. Nothing memorable about this one.

Delicious! I used red, yukon, and blue potatoes. I cut them up into chunks no more than 1.5 inches and boiled them the same time as the eggs. The blues were quite tender and lent a gorgeous purple swirl to the end result. Also added bacon and fried up the onions a bit, as we're not crazy about raw onions. Great recipe--and even better if you get REALLY GOOD celery! (Try a farmers' market!)

Easy to make and very tasty. Had to use red potatoes since that's all I had in the house. Came out very well. Did cut down on the celery and used only half the vinegar. Will definitely make gain.

I can hardly believe the praise this salad gets in the comments. I found it watery and rather bland. Far too much celery -. I had to serve it with a slotted spoon. I will not make this again.

This is one rich potato salad! I generally don't make the mayo & egg kind and thought I'd try something different. I probably used closer to two lbs of potatoes and a total of 2/3 cup dressing. 1/3 each mayo & sour cream with enough milk to loosen it. It was still plenty moist. A couple TBS of dijon, and 4 or 5 stalks of celery, thinly sliced. Plenty of freshly ground black pepper - I didn't think it needed any more salt. The potatoes tasted a bit vinegary right after I dressed the salad, but that disapated overnight and gave the salad and extra flavor dimension. I would make this again for a traditional potato salad.

Very nice and a definite summer food. Next time, I will probably reduce the amount of celery and vinegar but a delicious compliment to summer grilling.

This was such a great and easy recipe. I had never made potato salad before and this came out perfect. It tasted even better the next day. I did end up using less mayo than the recipe called for and maybe used a bit more sour cream. I also used only 2 celery stalks since using a whole bunch seemed a little much.

This was creamy and delicious. I've never made potato salad before, but this turned out wonderfully.

This was really good. I also cut down on the celery, used maybe three big stalks, and I chopped them finer than 1/2 inch pieces. I also only used three eggs. It's really not enough potatoes to accomodate so much dressing. I cut that a little too. I used 1/2 c of sour cream, 1/4 c of mayo, and no milk, and it was still very "dressed." My husband's comment was "yep, that's potato salad." I think that's good...

I should have read the reviews more closely and reduced the vinegar....it was a bit over-powering.

Very nice potato salad. I cut the celery into slightly smaller chunks, but otherwise didn't change it. Will use again.

I made this recipe for the first time for a holiday party and it turned out great. The guests loved it, and it was very simple to make. I used a whole, small white onion and a little more sour cream than the recipe calls for. I also sprinkled some dill weed on the top as a garnish, which also gave it a little kick. I will definitely make this again.

This is a good recipe for potato salad, but as other reviewers noted, it needs a few changes to make it a great recipe. If I make it again, I'll cut the mayo, sour cream, and vinegar -- it's currently too much for the amount of potatoes. I agree that it could also benefit from bacon and a little mustard, as another reviewer suggested. And to the cook who thought it was the potatoes turning the eggs green, it's not: that's the result of not getting the eggs into very cold water immediately after cooking for a sufficient amount of time. Boiling the eggs and potatoes together works well -- it's nice to have one less pot to wash after finishing!

This was so good; my husband loved it, especially the crunchy celery. I used apple cider vinegar.

Great flavor, would suggest lightly sauteeing the veggies for anyone who doesn't like the 'squeak' of biting into raw celery like my hubby.

I added some bacon and a little dijon and a little less sour cream and the family was raving!!!

I made a few changes in this recipe. I reduced the vinger to two TBL and the celery to two stalks.I chopped the celey fine as well. I boiled the potatoes and eggs seperately. Although it does save time to boiling them together boiling eggs makes the whites rubbery and the yolk turns a nasty green. To cook the eggs I put them in a small saucepan and covered them with water by an inch. I brougt the water to a boil and immediately covered the pan and took them off the heat and let them sit for 10 min. I also added salt and fresh cracked pepper to the recipe.

Made this for a Labor Day party, and everyone LOVED it! I even got a request for the recipe! I do admit that I couldn't find malt vinegar, so went online, and found that I could substitute cider vinegar...which is what I did. I would definitely make this again, and would do a better job of finding malt vinegar to keep the integrity of the recipe.

very good and simple. I used low-fat plain yogurt instead of sour cream, which wasn't in stock.

I made a lot of the changes suggested here: cut mayo in half, subs nonfat yogurt for sour cream, used only inner celery stalks and cut amt of celery. I also used a scant 1/4 c of malt vinegar, but it was still too vinegary for my taste; I'd use just a couple of Tbsps next time. It's possible I didn't use quite enough potatoes, since I didn't weigh them, but even with one or two extra potatoes, I think it still would have been too wet for my taste, and I eliminated the milk entirely. I used just one stalk of celery, but I think I'd use two next time; a whole bunch sounds like overkill to me. I would also use half as many eggs and increase the amt of onion and salt. I used Maui onions and could hardly taste them. I think a little paprika sprinkle for a garnish might be good, and some chopped fresh Italian parsely.

Found this to be fantastic after we doubled (perhaps tripled) the amount of sweet onions called for and also tripled the amount of salt. Also cut the amount of celery in half, peeling off the outer stalks and only using the inner, more tender stalks cut into 1/4" pieces. Also added approximately a tablespoon of pepper. It was absolutely delicious! Looking forward to eating it cold for lunch tomorrow. Ate it with almond-crusted salmon and it was absolutely perfect.

Good, I like the crunch. Some might prefer a little less celery

We like this especially the dressing. I didn't care for the amount and size of the celery - too crunchy and dominant.

Used very fresh celery and avoided the strongly flavored outer stems to keep the flavor light. This was a delicious counterpoint to chipotle ketchup and balsamic onion hamburgers. I also soaked the onion for 20 minutes prior to chopping to take some of the bite out.

Working in the kitchen restaurant and made this for family meal with flank steak. Was a very good recipe to feed a big crowd. Very tasty.

This is a one-dish meal for vegetarians. It's convenient to cook the potatoes and eggs in the same pot at the same time. I halved the mayo and used yogurt instead of sour cream. It was very good, and I usually don't like mayonnaise-y potato salads.
