this is very simple and tasty, but i could not get it to "jell" like a jam should. i cooked it an hour and half and the temp did not want to get high enough. i eventually turned up the heat which burnt the bottom but it did get to 216 for one second! Regardless, it was very tasty and i have been eating it with my breakfast cream of wheat.
