Giving this 3.5 forks with hopes that next time I can tweak this to a 4 fork recipe. My minor changes: --Added 2 minced garlic cloves w the shallots. --Used about 1# of fingerling potatoes w/ a half# sweet potato --Steamed the diced potatoes to al dente --Seasoned aggressively with S&P at each step With these minor changes, this was a great brunch recipe. Next time I'll add some heat. I'll add a half minced jalapeno to the shallots and some hot sauce to finish. Outstanding overall.

This was a nice hash and I made it because I had a piece of pork belly to use up. Next time I would just use bacon and skip the belly. I liked the addition of vinegar and maple syrup giving the hash a bit of depth.

I added some chorizo for extra spice. I placed it in a casserole dish and heated it through in the oven, then I poached some eggs and placed them directly on top...my guests loved it...they all fought over what little bit was left to take home!

I actually had some left over cooked pork belly from another recipe. I loved this dish. At the whole thing myself.

I served this at a 15-person brunch (doubling the recipe). I got RAVE reviews and many requests for the recipe. I changed the recipe a bit because the piece of pork belly I purchased ended up being mostly fat. I added 6 slices bacon (after removing fat). For the fun of it, I also substituted half the sweet potato for diced Jerusalem artichoke and pumpkin. I made the dice smaller, 1/4 inch, in all cases. I added 1 cup minced onion because I didn't have shallots. Finally, I roasted the diced veggies before adding them to pork in cast iron pan. I ended up letting the hash cook till it was crispy. I omitted the maple syrup. I don't believe it was necessary.

I actually had this dish at Longman and Eagle not long ago - it was good, but I think it can be improved. First, the potatoes were a bit underdone - a quick steam will help that tremendously, and allow them to get nicely crisp in the pan. It needs more maple, more vinegar and more spice as well.

I didn't much like this dish. The flavor was bland, and the contrasting textures of the soft pork belly meat and the firm sweet potato didn't work well together. And the end result is certainly not worth having to prep a day ahead of time.

Used the leftovers this morning and served as a side along the Big Apple Pancake recipe- delicious!

I feel a little bad reviewing this recipe since I did have to make some changes but I always enjoy seeing the alternative options peopl have tried! First of all- I would serve this more as a breakfast side as it can be pretty heavy as the only dish. It was very good, though. My local grocery store didn't have Pork Belly so I substituted Chorizo (idea from local favorite restaurant similar brunch dish). Also added one chopped up apple which added a nice sweetness. I would suggest cutting the yams smaller to cook a little faster- maybe 1/2" x 1/2" max. I served with sunny side up eggs on top and also drizzled extra maple syrup on top. A very good Fall breakfast!
