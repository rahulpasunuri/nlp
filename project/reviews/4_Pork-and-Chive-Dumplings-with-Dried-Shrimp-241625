AMAZING recipe! Time consuming, yes. Somewhat dangerous, perhaps. But so, *SO* worth it! The only issue I had was, in the pan fry method, when you're instructed to add water to extremely hot oil. After enjoying these tasty tidbits, I ended up having to degrease half my kitchen. Not so fun ... My Solution: Add the dumplings to the pan, as instructed. Cover with a tight fitting lid FIRST, and crack it just enough to add the water, then re-sealing it tightly to contain the spitting. Crisis overted! Don't let my mishap sway you though - these are DELICIOUS, tender and tasty dumplings worth making again and again. Dipping sauce, though enjoyable, was somewhat heavy on the vinegar but (as previously mentioned) can be easily tweaked to taste.

Fabulous! Used 1 anchovy fillet, minced, for dried shrimp. Used dipping sauce from another recipe. Used wonton wrappers.

This recipe was A W E S O M E! Time consuming (even when using pre-made gyoza), but definitely worth the effort. The plus of this recipe is that you can stack them in the freezer and thaw them later. My husband and I loved it. I see myself eating them home made from now on. This is also an excellent recipe for parties.

This is my go-to dumpling recipe and am making it again today with my daughter. I just read my notes on this and thought I would share. We get 60+ dumplings from this recipe, but could easily have filling for 30 more. (I run the dough through my pasta maker.) I am going to add 50% more to the dough recipe today. So wonderful. The flavors meld perfectly.

What a fabulous recipe! It was time consuming but was a lot of fun to make with a group of people. Omitted shrimp(food allergies in our house) and it still came out great. I substituted Chicken for the Pork (ran the chicken through the food processor to shred it) and they were a huge hit!

time consuming but tasty! if you find it difficult to obtain dried shrimp look in the spanish section of your local grocery store where they keep the spices in little cellophane bags, you will more than likely find them!(i was surprised) the garlic chives are hard to find, i used shallots instead. definite do over! :)

these were not fantastic for the amount of work and i actually like difficult recipes. i followed the recipe exactly and harvested garlic chives from my garden and was hoping for a 4 fork result :-(

I made these with all fresh shrimp (chopped in food processor) instead of the dried shrimp/pork combo and omitted the garlic chives as they are not readily available. Used pre-made wrappers (filled with about 2 tsp filling) and pan fried/steamed them. They were really tasty and fun to make. The two of us put down 30 of them! I would like to make them with the pork too but I think the recipe lends itself to swapping out the protein. I didn't love the dipping sauce which I made as written; too much vinegar I think. However, it could easily be tinkered with.

My family--including my 8-year-old who can be a bit picky--loved these. I didn't have shrimp, so I omitted. I steamed one first and tasted, found it to be a little saltier than I wanted, so I added a little honey, and they were fantastic. There were far more than we would have eaten in one sitting, so I cooked about half and froze the rest. Just arrange them on a plate so they aren't touching each other, place in the freezer until they're solid (an hour or two), then place them back in the freezer in a ziplock or vacuum sealed bag. Cook them as you would fresh but give them about 5 or 10 minutes more cook time.

Really good! I tried with the wonton wrappers as well as dough recipe. I think the dough is better taste; but wrappers are faster. Has anybody out there ever froze the dumplings after preparing? I didn't have dried shrimp so I used 2 raw frozen (thawed) with about 1 tablespoon of bonito flakes in mirin, strained residual fluid. Good also. Definitely will prepare again.

wow! better than the dumplings at my local chinese restaurant. i used much less water in the dough than the recipe called for (only about 1/2 cup), so don't dump in the entire cup at one time! i followed a previous reviewer's suggestion and rolled out the dough in my pasta maker...super easy!!! made half steamed and the other half pan-fried and they were both delicious!

These are the best dumplings I've ever made! So tasty! I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand so I used 3/4 lb ground beef and 1/4 lb italian sausage. I also substituted celery for the cabbage, added some onion instead of the garlic chives. Rolling out the dough was a pain but worth it in the end! I usually use pre-made wontons but since this dough is pliable you can fill them more. My 6-year old son loves them too!

I have been making dumplings (and fresh pasta) for years now. It only just occured to me to try rolling out my dumpling dough in my pasta roller, and it was a great success. Just wanted to share this with you, it has made the process a lot easier than rolling individual cirles. Havent tried this recipe, but it does look good. I LOVE DUMPLINGS!!!!! Good Luck.

absolutly fantastic, I seen this women on food network giving Bobby Flay advise on how to make dumplings.

Unfortunately I couldn't find the dried shrimp or garlic chives so I have no idea how important they are to the recipe (I suspect they make a big difference). I've made this twice and I find it very difficult to pleat the dumplings. Anita Lo makes it look so easy - you can tell she's been going this since childhood. I'll keep working on it.

Made this for my husband who thinks that the only thing worth eating on Sunday mornings is dim sum. We both loved the recipe and I really appreciated the video demonstration. I omitted the dried shrimp, but still used the Chinese rice wine. The only thing I found challenging was rolling out the dough thin enough, (some of the wraps turned out too thick and doughy), and pleating the dumplings. I'll make this again and try the gyoza wraps and possibly make the dough again. Took me about an hour from start to finish. Delicious!!!

I've made many dumplings with all sorts of ingredients and different recipes and this is by far the best! All the flavors are right on. I did however substitute chopped raw shrimp and halved cooked shrimp (at separate times) for the dried shrimp. Awesome results... you can fold the wrappers in many different ways if you find the pleats too hard (as my fiance does...).

I would give this recipe five forks if I could. I've made it trice now and every time it is so delicious. The flavors complement one another perfectly. I follow the recipe exactly, with the exception of omitting the shrimp altogether. And you wouldn't believe it, but these are incredibly easy to make. Mixing all the ingredients together is a cinch and filling the dumpling wrappers is easy, although a little time consuming. Just a note, I learned that not all goyza wrappers are equal. The ones I used the first time were thick and wouldn't pleat properly. I used a different brand the second time and my beautifully pleated dumplings would have made a Chinese grandmother proud!

made these 3x now, and they get better each time. Used shrimp paste and chopped garlic in addition to regular chives. Dish reminds me of home.

I made this recipe for my dinner club and it was a huge success! I used raw chopped shrimp instead of dried, which worked well.

This recipe is VERY good! The entire family enjoyed these. While it took a while to prepare, I will certainly be doing this again. I made these for a visiting student from China...she thought they were wonderful! I have earned a new name at the house..."The Dumpling King." Like the last review, there were a few things I left out. Thank you Anita Lo
