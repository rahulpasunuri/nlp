This has been a staple among all dishes. Easy to prepare and presents elegantly. I undercook the tenderloin slightly then cover it with foil. Deglaze the cast iron skillet with red wine add a few shallots, a bit of beef stock and reduce. The sauce is strained and returned to skillet with addition of a few pats of butter. I slice the tenderloin thinly and serve on a bed of orzo cooked risotto style with a finish of 1 cup parmesan. Then drizzle gravy over the pork and serve remaining gravy in a sauce boat. Always gets rave responses!

Use coarse salt and pepper. Cook per directions, tenderloin should be medium rare. Cooking tenderloin 'well done' will invariably disappoint. After cooking and resting, slice the medallions for easy serving. I have cooked this, and variations of it, many times and it is a family favorite.

I halved the salt, and it was still too salty for my taste. Also, I had to cook it longer than suggested before it was cooked through, and it turned out very dry.

Easy week night dinner. I used fresh rosemary as one of the other cooks recommended.

Easy preparation. I used a cast iron skillet to brown two small tenderloins in olive oil. Added 8oz white quartered mushrooms and 1/2 sliced onion to the pan, then popped everything in a nice hot oven. Served with blue cheese and chive scalloped potatoes and sliced tomatoes.

Very tasty and simple, however I found the salt and pepper overpowering. I will use much less next time I make this.

This recipe is super easy and makes for a great presentation. I also used fresh rosemary and tripled the amount. I found the salt was too strong and halved it. Using Montreal Steak seasoning instead of straight pepper works nicely, too. I deglazed the pan with white wine and then dribbled over the tenderloin after it was cut. Delicious!

A sterling example of a simple, classic preparation that takes no time at all, but produces a tasty meal! The secret to this is getting a good carmelizing browning of the tenderloin before oven roasting. I did a red wine, broth deglaze and reduction, with a little butter to finish/thicken. This is a standard in my "rotation"

easy and delicious! I reduce a salt a touch though, I find it's too over powering.

This was sooo good and easy! I used fresh rosemary and tripled the amount per another reviewer's suggestion. Next time I might use a tad less pepper, but as is I (and my guests and picky fiance) loved this. Especially good for prepping dinner in a hurry!

I've found this recipe to be a no-fail one that always impresses. I use fresh rosemary (triple the amount of dried.) It's extremely easy as long as you don't overcook the pork - it comes out very tasty and tender. Great for entertaining and equally as nice on a weeknight.

Very good I also put mushrooms and couple of small onions in the dish in the oven, and a reduction of red wine and chicken stock with nob of butter to make a sauce

Hey Epicurious, great recipe and I don't want to rate it again since I did this last year, but it seems to have vanished from your site. You guys are great at cuisuine and recipes, but greatly lacking on the IT side.

Easy and yummy week night dinner. Used fresh rosemary because I didn't have dried, and three small garlic cloves. Used chicken stock to deglaze the pan and it make a good low cal sauce. Will make again.

Great! I also had some leftover chix stock from my side dish and used it to moisten and deglaze at end of cooking. Added butter and flour to thicken. It made a great tasting gravy.

I have made this dish several times. Rarely as the main meal, but I use it for sandwiches. Tasty. I add a bit more pepper, maintaining the 1 to 2 ratio between pepper and salt and increase the amount of garlic.

This was so easy and delicious. I forgot to add the rub before I seared the pork so I added it right before I put it in the oven. It still turned out great!

We have been making this recipe since it was first published in Bon Appetit more than 10 years ago. When available, we use fresh rosemary and add a slight bit more garlic. My husband prefers the pepper content in the recipe but I sometimes cut in down when we have guests.

My boyfriend (a total food snob) and I really enjoyed this recipe. Easy to make, and very tasty. I would definitely cut down the pepper and even the salt (a little) I also brined the pork tenderloin first, very moist and tender.

This was ok, but not great. If I were to make it again, I'd put less pepper.

Tasty and very easy to prepare. Next time I would cut the pepper back to 1 teaspoon and the salt to 3/4 teaspoon. Also had to roast a good 5 minutes longer for doneness. We threw some quartered mushrooms into the pan before putting in the oven - very good.

This was a really easy recipe, yet elegant enough to serve to guests. It was my first time using a dry rub rather than a glaze or a marinade, and I was very pleased with the results-- tender, juicy and flavorful.

Rating: 4
This dish is fabulous! I make it often, and wow guests even though it is so easy! It is peppery, so you can trim down the pepper for folks that don't enjoy a spicy entree. Great to make for large crowds too...just double or triple the recipe!

Really simple & very good. Be sure to slice thin, thin with an electric knife.

I made this dish for my parents and it was a hit. My father is a rather particular man, and he loved it. I doubled the recipe, but didn't use all of the spices, and made oven roasted potatoes. It is a definate make again recipe, and would recommend it to anyone. I did cook the pork a little longer than suggested, and it was so tender you could cut it with a fork.

Great recipe! Roasted potatoes were an excellent side dish. Peel and quarter potatoes, coat with olive oil and roast in a 400 degree oven for about 45 minutes. Turn several times, particularly at the beginning (they will tend to stick). When the pork is ready to go into the oven, transfer the potatoes to the skillet. Turn the potatoes when you turn the pork to get them golden and crispy on all sides.

We enjoyed this dish, but made a few changes. Cut the pepper to 1/2 tsp (to accommodate our 4 year old's taste), the salt to 3/4 tsp, and substituted basil for rosemary. It worked really well! You have to use some sort of dried herb, to get the crusting effect. Served it with stir fried veggies and chow mein noodles, despite the "Italian" flavour of the basil. Yum!

This is fabulous! A bonus is that it's quick and easy enough for a weeknight, but good enough for guests. After cooking, I deglazed the skillet with a little white wine and chicken broth which made a wonderful jus for the meat and a side of Basmati rice. For guests I may try the roquefort stuffing in your file which is with paired with pork chops, baked separately. This is truly special.

Simple, healthy, and VERY flavorful!! My husband loved it. I thought it was a little salty so next time I will reduce the amount of salt. I will definitely make this dish again.

Whoever came up with this recipe should be commended. I used center cut loin chops instead of tenderloin and they were fabulous. So easy, moist and flavorful. Great for a week night. Highly recommended and will definetly make again.

Good concept, but way, way too salty! The second time I made this, I cut the salt by half, and increased the pepper proportionally. It was much better.

This dish keeps getting rave reviews at our house. Rather than just slice and serve when cooked, the pan with its herbs and pork juices lends itself to a wonderful wine (Merlot) sauce, using pan juices. Just deglaze and strain all the herbs and pork pieces. Add red wine and at last minute 1 1/2 TBL of butter. Pour sauce on bottom on plate and sliced tenderloins on top!!!

Excellant, Next time I will cut the rosemary to 3/4 tea. and the salt to 3/4 tea., was a little to much for us. Might try it on the grill.

I made this dish last night, and it was indeed very good, the meat was very tender. I would, however, cut down on the amount of salt and pepper used...it is a little bit salty and very peppery using the amounts listed in the recipe. But, it was a VERY easy dish to make, and was a hit.

This was delicious...so easy to prepare, but so flavorful. The meat was very tender and moist. I doubled the recipe for a small dinner party and it was a big hit! Also a big hit with my extremely picky son!

This was super-easy to make, and even my picky, picky husband loved it. He kept saying "this has so much flavor"! Even though it's pretty basic, it does look nice on the plate. I served with mashed potatoes and green beans. Real quick for a weeknight dinner. I'll add this to my list for sure!

My husband made the mistake of scraping the bottom of the pan and drizzling the drippings over the meat! Let it be, I say...it is plenty seasoned as it is! Quite good and a welcome change from our stand-by recipes.

I've made this half a dozen times, and it always comes out full of flavor -- never dry. I almost feel guilty preparing it for guests -- it's too easy!

I keep experimenting with different spicies in the mix. The kids love to help me make this recipe. It can be made without any salt. Enjoy

I have served this dish to friends in Florida and at home in Toronto..and it has been a big hit both places. The meat is lean and this appeals to many people who are watching their fat intake, but the flavour is anything but a 'diet' food. I know it will become a standard dish for a long time to come.

This was fast, easy, and delicious. I added a little orange juice to the pan after searing the meat and put in a half pound of mushrooms to cook with the meat. Afterwards I removed the meat and mushrooms and heated a can of green beans in the drippings. It was a really delicious accompaniment.
