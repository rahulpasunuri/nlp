This is a great recipe for a quick and elegant dinner. We changed the recipe a bit, omitting the tomatoes and replacing the ham with chopped broccoli. We used both wild and button mushrooms. Delicious results; this recipe has potential for many different combinations and will remain in our collection. Suitable for a casual entertaining dinner, or jazzed up, for a more formal one.

LOVED IT. took other's suggestion and I added fresh thyme to the cream, i omitted the tomatoes because my boyfriend hates them and it was amazing. I used black forest ham and salted and peppered the breasts before i stuffed them and threw some garlic powder on. with brown rice and green beans, it was so good. Will def make it again.

This is a good base recipe, but needs a bit of doctoring. I like it because it makes lots of sauce and it's quick and easy enough to do on a worknight. I seasoned the inside of the breast surface with salt, pepper, dry sage and thyme. Also added more of same seasonings plus about a tsp of Saracha chili sauce to the cream sauce. Would go well with any starch, but I enjoyed mine with Orzo and Peas.

Made this for dinner this evening. Very good. I stuck to the recipe with the exception of: I used salted butter, I used 2 TBS of Shallots, I added a clove of garlic, used extra dry vermouth and subbed gruyere for the swiss. Oh, and I slapped a few fresh basil leaves in with the ham and cheese stuffing (just because I had it on hand). I found the chicken needed longer to cook, but I had pretty large breasts (that's what he said....Sorry, couldn't resist). Overall, very good and definitely will make again.

This is a good basic recipe. I followed the recipe to the letter, but after tasting the sauce I had to make some modifications. I added kosher salt and white pepper. The breast was a little dry, but I blame myself for that. After reading a number of reviews I was concerned the chicken might be under cooked, but it wasn't. Next time I'll add a second slice of cheese. The recipe needs tinkering. It wasn't a bad recipe, it just needs more. It's a good starter recipe to use and play with a number of fillings.

Rating: 3
The way this is prepared really allows the cheese to stay inside the chicken breast, which has always been a challenge for me in the past. I thought it was delicious and the kids liked it as well. I served it with rice which blends nicely with the sauce. mmm

Oh my! This recipe is worth the effort. Two thumbs up and I would definitely make it again. Takes about an hour from prep time to plate but the sauce and chicken combo (with the swiss and ham inside) makes for a tasty dish. I used a can of diced tomatoes,drained, to make it easier. Had thin chicken breasts to begin with so didn't need to slice them down the center, Still pounded the breasts as directed but used toothpicks to keep them sealed together. Simply remove toothpicks before plating. Served with rice. A nice fall/cooler temps type dish to warm the tummy!

This was absolutely delicious! I hardly ever follow a recipe exactly the way it's written mainly because I may not always have every ingredient. In this case I omitted the mushrooms, used a 14oz can of diced tomatoes, marsala wine, 1/2 cup of half and half and 1/2 cup of chicken stock. After I sautéed the chicken I poured the sauce over the chicken into a oven ready dish and finished cooking the chicken in the oven at 275 degrees for 30 min. I served it with a side of couscous with chick peas and zucchini (a recipe I also found in this site). The whole family loved it. Enjoy

This was good and the chicken was cooked perfectly, but the sauce was only so-so and frankly looked a little like someone got sick on the plate. It was good, but I probably would not make it again.

This is a good recipe but it served as a base idea for what has become a regular dish in our family. I substituted Gruyère (or an aged swiss) and fresh sage for the filling and sea salt and cracked pepper for the coating (table salt and finely ground pepper do not carry the flavor as well). Follow the recipe up to the point of adding the shallots and mushrooms (and only use fresh of the latter or not at all). Sautee the shallots (I use 1 whole md-lg shallot) and instead of tomatoes, add about 1/2 tablespoon of fresh Thyme for about 1 minute before adding the cream. Simmer the sauce until reduced a little and a light golden color. Transfer the covered chicken to plates (I like to cut mine in half at an angle) and top with the sauce.

This recipe is great for entertaining and I've made it again and again. As others have, I substituted proscuitto and gruyere instead of ham and swiss, and I use halved cherry tomatos instead of the diced ones- I think it makes the dish prettier. I serve this with herbed cous cous but it would be great many different ways.

This was a special treat version of Cordon Bleu! I followed the recipe with a few variations based on other reviews. I used Procuitto in place of ham, added garlic and tarragon the the wine reduction and baked the chicken in the oven for about 20 minutes at 275 to finalize the cooking. My family couldn't get enough and the sauce bowl was licked clean. This is definitely in our monthly rotation and one I will share with many.

I made this for new years 2007. While it showed well, 8 minutes cooking time was not near enough. I put the chicken breasts after I sauted them in the oven for about 15 minutes.

Did not care for the tomatoes in the recipe. I think it made the sauce too sour. Will try next time without the tomatoes.

My husband and I love this recipe! I used monterey jack cheese because I don't like Swiss. Also, I added red pepper flakes to the sauce which gave it a "kick" and I beleive is a must. Make sure you cook a pasta (I used egg noodles) or rice with it because there's enough sauce to go on the chicken and pasta/rice. Otherwise, you end up throwing away a ton of yummy sauce. It's a really pretty dish also. I will definitely make this again and again.

This was delicious, the sauce was so good and easy to prepare. Followed the recipe as written except I used prosciutto for the ham. And I, alas, did not have a truffle to shave onto my rice, but it was lovely anyway.

I love the concept of this recipe, but I had to modify it so much that I can't honestly give it a good rating or say I'd make it again. I think it serves as a good starting point for a cook looking for a bit of inspiration, but I wouldn't recommend following it to the letter. I agree with several of the other reviewers: this is very bland, so be prepared to add more flavor in each step! I seasoned the dredging flour with a little salt/pepper; substituted proscuitto and provelone for the ham and swiss; added a little ground sage, salt & pepper to the inside breast before folding. The sauce was also a little bland. I made the mistake of using canned diced tomatoes. Did NOT care for the flavor. If fresh tomatoes aren't available, maybe minced sundried ones would be nice? The sauce could also use a bit more pep.. maybe minced garlic in addition to the shallots.

My guests and husband really enjoyed this dish. I thought it was a little bland as written. I would probably add less cream to the sauce next time and maybe a few hot red pepper flakes as suggested by others. I served it with basmati rice and asparagus to great reviews. It makes a lot of sauce, so fettucine or egg noodles would be a great side, too.

Rating: 4
Wow! This was just wonderful! Made it exactly per the recipe, and served it with fettucini. My butcher butterflied the breasts for me, which was a help. I had ham & swiss on hand - if I were didn't have those, I would probably try prosciutto in lieu of regular ham. It's a great company dish - you can stuff the chickens a little bit ahead and prep the mushrooms & tomato, and then from scratch to finish it's less than 1/2 hour.

This is an awesome dish! I have made it several times and it's always well received by guests. To the previous reviewer, butterflying a breast creates a pocket for the ham and cheese. This dish is simple and elegant enough for a dinner party.

Can anyone tell me the advantages of butterflying the chicken breast over pounding out the breast?

Rating: 3
Great! I used black forest ham and 2 year aged white cheddar because that's what I had on hand and it turned out wonderfully. I cut through to the outside of the chicken breasts a bit(by accident) because they weren't quite thick enough but the ham slice still kept the cheese inside. Tip: Keep the cheese near the centre. The chicken turned out to be very moist and tasty. I served it with fresh fettucine tossed with garlic powder, olive oil and parmesan cheese. Would definitely make again.

I wanted to make this recipe exactly as written. It's so of a moment. I agree the flavor of the ham is completely lost and I did use good quality Virginia ham. The rest of the dish however was delicious. I served mine with red skin potatoes and brussels sprouts.

The chicken came out moist and the sauce was also a wonderful compliment.

I was looking for a chicken recipie that was different as I find chicken bland and boring most of the time. Made this by replacing the ham with pancetta and I was surprised with how great it turned out. The pancetta gives a little bit of spice and smoky flavor to the chicken and the sauce is rich and blends perfectly with the dish. I usually wouldn't change a recipe and then rate it but I really don't like ham and thought this was worthy of a review.

Bland and boring. I would not bother with this again.

This was amazing! All the flavors works so well together especially using only "fresh" ingredients. To the previous cook's review, I saw no reviews that seemed to be up in arms about using fresh tomatoes when canned tasted so much better. Well that's what they prefer, and what you prefer, it's up to the individual.

Great recipe! Next time, I would cut down by 1/4 on the cream as I found it a little too much. I love the taste of shallots and I slightly caramelized 1/4 cup. Also browning the mushrooms added a great depth of flavor. I'm not sure why people are so up in arms about the use of canned tomatoes - I would chose Muir Glen organic canned tomatoes any day over those crunchy mealy insipid tomatoes in the off season. Surely if you make this recipe anywhere from October to May or even June, you're better off choosing a good canned variety. Just make sure to choose ones that aren't canned with a lot of salt, sugar or added spices which could ruin the true flavor of this dish.

Excellent recipe for company. Next time, I will slice the chicken and fan it out for an even better presentation. I like the white rice with this. Any tips for a good vegetable recipe that goes well?

This is a wonderful recipe. I actually made it a while back and wanted to make it again for company. It's a simple and beautiful dish. I always wonder why people say they loved the recipe so much, yet they have completely changed it. To use canned tomatoes instead of taking the time to use fresh, and dried parsley when fresh is so wonderful. Tis a shame!

Rating: 4
My boyfriend and I loved this! I was a little skeptical because of how simple it seemed but it was great. I did make very small modifications though: First I marinated the chicken breasts in white cooking wine (same I used in sauce)with some poultry seasoning for a few hours. I did this because I was affraid of the 'plain chicken taste' that was mentioned before. I also used slices of Asiago cheese and Black Forrest ham because it was what I had on hand. One more thing, instead of garnishing with fresh Parsley, I added dried Parsley flakes to the sauce while it was cooking. I didn't have any heavy cream either, so I used some whole milk - to thicken I used flour/butter. Oh, and I used about a half a can of petit cut tomatoes about 90% drained instead of fresh tomatoes. This is one of my new favorites.

My husband loved this recipe; the sauce was much better than anticipated-this also made fantastic leftovers for the next evening. I used Kendall-Jackson Vintners Reserve Chardonnay, and was pleased with the results from this bargain wine. I served this with twice baked potatoes instead of the rice in the picture.

I am giving this a rare 4 forks. It was delicious!! I am really surprised to read that some people didn't care for it, but I think the secret is that because the ingredients are relatively simple they should be their freshest. Absolutely take the time to use fresh diced tomatoes, NOT CANNED. This I think is important; my husband who does not like tomatoes really liked this dish and even ate all the tomatoes (I used fresh Romas). I made just as written with the exception of a little extra fresh rosemary thrown into the sauce at the end (just because I had it sitting around) and I think this was really nice and I would add it again, maybe more. It was so simple and I did not think at all labour intensive and I was amazed at how wonderful it tasted. We work shifts and are not home for too many dinners so when we agree to make something again it MUST BE GOOD!!

This recipe was good, but not quite worth all the work it took to prepare it, I was expecting something great and it ended up tasting alot like bland old cooked chicken breast. The sauce definately adds good flavor and is the key element to the dish, but overall nothing special. Word of advice, pound the chicken as thin as possible otherwise the bland taste of chicken will overpower the dish.

excellent, am planing to make it in the very near future, scored a lot of points guys!!!

I had some problems and need advice: my chicken breasts tore during the flattening process, even though I was gentle. The ham served as a lining to contain the cheese, for the most part, but after both sides were browned, cheese started bubbling onto the skillet while the chicken appeared raw in the middle. I removed the breasts at this point and put them in a casserole, made the sauce (thickened with flour because there was a lot of liquid) and covered the chicken and baked at 350 for 25 min. The result was amazingly good, and the presentation was still quite nice. But what did I do wrong? How do you create a uniform 1/2 inch breast without splitting?

Rating: 3
What a great dish. I too, substituted proscuitto and Gruyère. I wanted to be relaxed when my husband came home, so I prepared ahead and put the chicken in a casserole, covered with the sauce and reheated for about 1/2 hour. It still tasted good, but the presentation wasn't as great as if you would keep the sauce seperate. Served with Roasted Garlic Creme Fraiche mashed potoatos. Excellent meal.

This recipe is definitely a keeper. I, too, substituted Gruyère, and thought it added a subtle nutty taste. The chicken stayed remarkably moist, and it truly did take only 1 hour to make.

The sauce is what makes this dish great! Use fresh mushrooms and fresh tomatoes, cut back slightly on the cream and its a great delicate sauce. I used gruyere cheese and prosciutto, and i thought the chicken portion was a bit bland.

This recipe is a bit labor-intensive, but well worth the effort! It was delicious. The only substitution I made was to use chopped up sun dried tomatoes instead of fresh - I think this probably intensified the flavor of the sauce. This was a BIG hit with my family.

This is a great recipe. I've tried it as written and then a couple of times with other reviewers adaptations. I definitely like the Gruyere and prociutto. Swiss tends to release too much oil. I had two huge chicken breasts and was able to stuff them nice a full - thus I didn't lose the flavor of the stuffing amidst the cream sauce and mushrooms. We like very spicy food in our house, so like some other reviewers, I jazzed it up with extra shallots, crushed red pepper, and lots of freshly ground black pepper. I also used a can of Rotel tomatoes with green chilies but drained the liquid. I serve this with a side of fettucine or linguine to help sop up the sauce. I have also found that this recipe can be done ahead of time by cooking everything up and then keeping the chicken and sauce separate until about 45 minutes before serving. Pop the chicken in the oven at 325 for about a half hour and re-heat the sauce just before ithe chicken is ready to come out.

I really liked this dish. I used a can of diced tomatoes - drain about half the liquid - and added minced garlic and red pepper flakes. I also doubled the onion and mushrooms. I wonder why people didn't like the cream - maybe the heat was up too high when they added it and it curdled? I thought the cream and tomato combo was great. I might try adding spinach next time too.

I made this for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it! I used prosciutto and gruyere as recommended by others. However, the sauce was terrible!!!!!!!! We pitched it and I whipped up a quick white sauce at the last moment, which everyone thought was much better. Also, this is quite labor intensive if you plan to make it for more than 4 people. I would suggest making it the day before and then reheating it prior to serving (it holds up well and still tastes fabulous).

The sauce was pretty good until I added the cream. Next time I make it, I will skip the cream and add some crushed red peppers to the sauce. Otherwise it was a good recipe.

This was a delicious recipe. I used canned diced tomatoes, which I drained down to about one cup. Used regular onions too. My chicken breasts were too small to seal with egg. but it wasn't a problem. I carefully cooked and turned them once. A little bit of the cheese leaked out, and made the sauce even better!!

I used some leftover Honeybaked ham (from Easter dinner), and although it could have been more thin as a stuffing, it worked fine. Next time I will make sure I pound the chicken thinly, as I ended up having to microwave in the end to get rid of some of the leftover pink where I didn't pound enough. I served it with the Asparagus Risotto (recipe via Epicurious also), and it was the perfect accompaniment. My dinner guests enjoyed it, and I enjoyed making the chicken, as it was simple as stuffed chicken goes. No rolling, which was different (and quite nice).

This was such a nice surprise! I put "chicken breast" in the search box, and stumbled upon this recipe. Wonderful. I used regular sandwich ham and swiss cheese, dried porcini (soaked in hot water prior to cooking), and grape tomatoes which I obviously did not peel, nor seed. Will make for company!

i quintupled the recipe. there were no leftovers. i used ham and swiss cheese and substituted white onions for the shallots and chicken broth instead of wine, everyone liked it. since we had such a large party, i cut every breast in half before topping with sauce. served with the lima beans and corn in chive cream and the red poatates with garlic and sage. i will make again.

I doubled the recipe for a dinner party and got many compliments. I modified the receipe as many others had...I used proscuitto and gruyere cheese..I also used twice as many shallots and canned diced tomatoes. The sauce is very good and takes a completely different turn (for the better) once the cream is added. I cooked all the chicken and sauce ahead of time and put into separate dishes. A half hour before dinner I placed in the oven at 300 degrees and warmed everything up. I will make this again.

I made this recipe for a dinner party I had and it turned out fabulous. I changed it around a bit and used gorgonzola cheese, proscietto ham, and i stuffed them with portabella mushrooms also. In the sauce I added roasted red peppers and omitted the tomatoes since they are out of season. I also used seasoned bread crumbs instead of flour and half and half instead of heavy cream. I served it with zucchini and squash that i marinated in balsamic and garlic and then grill and with rice and caesar salad.....it was awesome! Would definitely recommend this to anyone!! But play around with it...the things you can do with this are endless!

Okay, so I really changed this recipe around but it was so good! I used proscuitto instead of ham and gruyere cheese for the stuffing. I had these really thin chicken breasts that I couldn't cut in half, so I layed the proscuitto and cheese on top and rollled it up, then dredged it in flour. Frying it in butter is a little over the top, and I usually wouldn't do that, but it was a special dinner for guests so I went for it. I also added chunks of proscuitto to the sauce. I skipped the tomatoes as well because winter tomatoes scare me. A great dinner for special occasions

The chicken was fantastic however the sauce was ruined by the addition of the tomatoes and cream. Omit these two ingredients and you have a wonderful sauce that needs only a little stock and some butter to finish it off nicely.
