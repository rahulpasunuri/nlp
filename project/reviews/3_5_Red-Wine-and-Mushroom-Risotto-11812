Not quick but simple and delicious. Works well with other ingedients if you don't have the right mushrooms for example.

After teasing my husband that he would be a full fledged cook if he could make me a risotto, he made this recipe for me. It was very good. The only change we made was to use half pancetta, half bacon. I liked the periodic taste of the bacon in it. The meal was quite a bit of work, even for a risotto. It's definitely one where you should start with an empty dishwasher and have someone cleaning as you cook. I also would turn this into 7 or 8 servings in the future, especially if serving anything else with it. It does reheat okay, but consider adding just a touch of water or broth while reheating it.

Excellent! I loved it. The balance of flavours was perfect. I used Austrian smoked bacon instead of pancetta with no diminished results.. The color was also fine. Try it, it is unique and delicious!

i used baby portabello mushrooms, and beef broth as another reviewer suggested. It was good, but you def. need to add extra parmesan, or else you risk it being bland.

A great recipe, though I make mine with beef broth for a smoother flavor. I've also been known to throw in a few chopped walnuts on occasion, which works out great. I've got news for Epicurious though, a recipe with pancetta and chicken broth isn't vegetarian.

I have made this recipe several times and it is always a hit. My risotto also never turns out purple. I think you have to use pancetta instead of bacon. If you are using bacon it must be a thick cut of bacon to preserve the flavor.

This is a sneaky one. When I was tasting throughout (to test the rice), the taste of the rosemary was way too strong, and I thought it was going to be a bust. But after the final addition of broth, it was excellent. I didn't add procini, and I cut the amount of rosemary slightly (I like, but do not love rosemary), but otherwise stayed true. Very good. Ignore the silly people who are offended by purple risotto; it's not really unusual to use red wine in risotto.

This was my first attempt at making risotto ... and it was fantastic! I didn't find the deep purple color offensive at all. You forget about that once you take that first bite ... delicious.

This recipe was a disaster. Red wine + Arbioto rice = purple risotto. We had to throw it out, it looked so bad; tasted pretty bland too.

This was really good. I would recommend doubling the herbs and adding a little extra wine (1/4 c.) at the end. Also a little extra parmesan never hurts. We really enjoyed it next to a grilled filet mignon.

This dish was a nice treat. We used bacon instead of pancetta. However, we were a little dissapointed that there wasn't more of a bacon flavor. Overall, the taste was a little bland considering all the yummy things that went into it. I wonder if it was because there was so much chicken stock compared to 1 tbsp of sage and rosemary? I will try this dish again, but will try cutting the amount of rice in half (way too much for just 2 people) but keeping the rest of the goodies at the same amount. Might even try cooking the bacon separatly and adding at the end to preserve some of the bacon flavor instead of bacon soaked in chicken stock. Not really sure if our dissapointment was because we used bacon instead of pancetta. Really enjoyed the red wine flavor. Used a nice merlot. Not one of my favorite risottos, but definately still worth making.

I had some portabellas on hand, which I chopped and used instead of cremini. Regular bacon works fine if no pancetta available. Whoever used a 40 dollar bottle of wine in this recipe is crazy--what a ridiculous waste--using a basic dry red table wine (3-7 dollars) worked fine and was delicious. (I make risotto about once a week and believe me, the quality of the wine does little to the final flavor of the risotto--the quality of the broth, however, has a great deal to do with it, I always use homemade chicken broth.) The rosemary and sage worked beautifully together. It was an easy comfort food to make.

I didn't love this - maybe because of the amount of labor involved. With the cleaning and chopping of mushrooms and the 3 pans required for the dish, I want the flavor to be incredible. My husband and daughter enjoyed it more than I (they didn't make it!). There are too many other risotto recipes out there that I prefer to repeat this one.

guests said this was in the top three of all risottos they have ever had, and i myself have made about seven to ten for them. i used a nice merlot

This was outstanding. my adds: addl tsp of rosemary,sage and T +tsp of thyme. double pancetta, addl 1/2 cup parmesean, 5 cups veal stock not chicken - did not need mushroom water. MUST use the Rosso di Montalcino wine listed. Not an inexpensive meal, Rosso was $40/bottle, pancetta $4, fresh parmesean $12, veal stock $12, served mesculin salad w. fennel and mandarain orange balsalmic vinnegrette to start then the risotto in bowls with grilled dry aged strip steaks $20 each (4 for 6 people sliced served family style) but it was a hearty fall meal we will all dream about!

This is an outstanding risotto dish, rich and full of flavor. We don't eat meat so used a roasted veggie stock along with a mushroom paste type stock. I had an open bottle of a very good red wine which added another depth of flavor along with an excellent aged parm. Paired with a salad and roasted aparagus this is a keeper. I can't wait to serve it to company!

This dish was YUM! I give it the four fork salute! It's bursting with flavor and pairs nicely with an italian red.

I found this a little bland. I don't know if the States has been inflicted with Jamie Oliver, the irritatingly ubiquitous British TV chef yet, but if so, you should check out his risotto with red wine, smoky bacon and radiccio, which I think has more flavour.

This has become my signature risotto dish. Although it's great on a chilly evening, I make it year round. There's nothing like the flavor that Pancetta adds -- for my non-meat-eaters friends I make it without and fry up some pancetta on the side and sprinkle it on for only those who eat it -- yum!

An all time favorite in our house since it was published in Gourmet in 1996. It is without a doubt one of the most flavorful risotto dishes I've ever made -- perfect for a chilly evening.

We loved this dish as part of our New Years Eve celebration. We used white, portabello and oyster mushrooms with the porcini for a mushroom medley. Would definitely make again

THIS HAS BECOME A CLASSIC IN OUR FAMILY SINCE IT WAS PRINTED YEARS AGO IN GOURMENT. MY HUSBAND EAGERLY ANTICIPATES THE ADVENT OF THE COLD WEATHER AS THIS HEARTY DISH MAKES REGULAR APPEARANCES. IT IS WONDERFUL ACCOMPANIED BY A TRICOLORE SALAD AND BALSAMIC VINAIGRETTE.

The flavour was fantastic! It made more than enough for our group of 10. It did take alot of time but drink wine and chat with friends while you stir! I used up all my homemade frozen chicken stock.

I found this recipe to have intense and complex flavors. Success will depend on the QUALITY of your ingredients-Use good wine!!! ALSO, do not under-cook!

I made this for a special birthday dinner. My friends are real gourmets and absolutely loved this risotto. It is very time intensive, but the final product was a big hit and the recipe has been requested by guests.

Delicious. This recipe is a meal in itself. But it makes such a large quantity, I'd say it's enough for eight people. I serve it with prime rib, with a port wine sauce.

THIS DISH DOES NOT HAVE GOOD FLAVOR, AND INVOLVES TOO MUCH CHOPPING, AND TOO MANY POTS AND PANS. NOT WORTH IT.
