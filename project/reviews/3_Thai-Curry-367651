I definitely changed this recipe quite a bit and made it more of a cold coconut curry I used canned coconut milk and skipped the soaked peanuts. instead of cabbage I used red bell pepper, and green beans and green onions. But it turned out very well really yummy and the perfect summer curry I used tons of tumeric and curry powder to make it a bit more flavor.
