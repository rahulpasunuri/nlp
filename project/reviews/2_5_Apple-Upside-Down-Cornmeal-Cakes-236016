this was simple to make and tasted really good. i used pecans instead of walnuts b/c that's what i had. and after reading the reviews, added cinnamon and nutmeg to the apples and the cornmeal batter. i didn't think it was gritty at all and liked the combo of the apples and corn cake. would have liked to have tried it with the whipped cream but didn't have it. but it was still good with a glass of milk. i'm surprised by all the bad reviews.

Not impressed. Was too heavy and bland to really seem like a cake OR a muffin.

I thought the cake was too sweet. Next time, I will use less sugar in the corncake. The apples mixture is sweet enough on it's own.

This was nothing more than a corn muffin with apple dice. Bleagh!

This is a great recipe to play with. I used bosc pears in place of the apples and chopped candy ginger in place of the nuts. The combination was terrific! The presentation is lovely with everyone having their own little cake. My guests loved them, so this will definately be a repeater!

This is a great recipe. It is fairly quick and easy. I have made them a few times and everyone raves about them.

I added cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg to the apples, as sugested by a reviewer. The apples were good on their own. However, I would chop the walnuts finer because they overpowered the apples and cornmeal. I personally did not think the apple/walnut topping and cornmeal cake tastes combined well.

i made this dessert for a big family dinner and everyone loved it. i made a few changes, i used bartlett pears and hazelnuts ( no time to shop ) and what wasn't inhaled after dinner was eaten for breakfast with yogurt...this reciepe is easy to play with and it works for large groups.

Prep-wise, this recipe was quick and uncomplicated. I did let the pan "rest" about 10 min prior to baking to let the cornmeal absorb moisture & reduce grittiness. Ingredient-wise, I would reduce the quantity of nuts to 1/4 cup finely chopped & I'd use pecans (my preference). The walnuts' flavor and size competed with the subtle flavor of the apples/brown sugar. I did add 2 Tbsp. of pure maple syrup as I didn't see much in terms of spices and/or flavorings. I would make extra apple/nut mixture to apply warm at time of service with vanilla ice cream.

I didn't think the flavor was that good. The combination of the sweet apples and the texture of the cornmeal didn't have a nice feel in the mouth. It came across as gritty. The apples however were tasty. Maybe I would prefer a more cakelike consistency than the grittyness of cornmeal with this dessert. And a day later, it wasn't looking too appetizing.

A little boring for my taste. Apples needed some spice (cinnamon? nutmeg?) and cake maybe could use some vanilla.

Made this recipe to help deal with bumper crop of crabapples. Didn't peel, but cored and cut into 1/2" dice. Doubled amount of sugar because of tartness of crabapples.Baked the muffins in individual 1 cup ramekins.Served warm with low-fat vanilla yogurt for breakfast, along with boiled eggs, and lattes. Recipe was easy and came out very well.

This was very simple and delicious. I would, however, add a little Calvados and a pinch of cinnamon to the apple mixture. That's for my taste. But my teenager boys absolutely LOVED it ! Its a keeper.
