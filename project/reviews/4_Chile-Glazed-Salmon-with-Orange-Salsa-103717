Substituted the grapefruit for orange in the slsa receipe. It needed 1/2 tsp sugar but otherwise worked out well and would go well with any grilled or broiled salmon receipe.

it was good. It was not great. Too odd and I didn't feel the flavors melded perfectly. Interesting change to the standard fish dinner, for sure!

Excellent recipe. Easy to prepare. I went easy on the fennel and was not sorry. All the flavors complemented each other well. Served it with a whipped delicata squash and a South African Syrah. Very delectable and will go into the meal rotation when fresh wild salmon is available.

Delicious! Didn't have tamarind, so substituted 1/2 tsp of achiote paste, I think it might have worked even better than tamarind! Served with toasted barley salad with roasted reds (find on Epicurious). Great flavor combo! Don't skip on the fennel- it adds a great depth to the chile glaze.

The different flavors in the glaze, and the salsa "played well" with each other and did not overwhelm the salmon, which has a delicate taste. The fennel seeds were a nice additional flavor. I used serrano chiles for the salsa which we also use for fresh salsa. In Mexico where I live I can get an unsweetened pure tamarind paste which simplifies making this recipe. My wife does not like honey so used a mixture of corn syrup and dark sugar which gave a nice sweet taste and caramalized beautifully. I made this recipe for my fanily and friends (nine of us) and all reviews were very positive. I served it with a side of coconut infused rice which also had fresh cilantro, which made it very fragrant.

I eat fresh, local salmon all the time out here in the Pacific Northwest and this was one of the best salmon dishes I have ever had! I made it for a large dinner party though which made the prep time long! I would make it more often if it wern't for the time involved in prepping the oranges. Outstanding dish!

Exceptional. A classic example of "layered flavors". Guests eat the salsa after the salmon is gone. On our short list of all time favorites!

Rating: 4
I thought this recipe was very good! I used 4 dried chilis for the glaze and used the other ingredients as directed. Instead of broiling the fish, however, I heated the glaze in a saucepan, and cooked the salmon in a skillet on the stovetop-adding the glaze about halfway through. Then served it over rice with the extra glaze drizzled all over it. So good, you don't even need the salsa, really. This glaze is wonderful! A keeper for sure.

Made with Mango Salsa, which is now in season, instead of Orange. This is the number one Salmon recipe for sure. Amazing. Don't be put off by the smell of the glaze which may be strong.

The glaze was good, but should be used with pork, NOT for salmon. I am mystified by the previous reviews. I wont make this one again.

Rating: 4
It's all in the chili glaze -WOW!! Superb, different, still lets the fish flavor through. (Salsa - 2 forks.) Grilled 1 1/2 inch salmon steaks. Should have listened to other reviewers' advice to make twice as much sauce - family wanted more. Oh, incidentally - found an 8 oz pop top of tamarind juice in my pantry (international grocery). Reduced to 1/3 cup. An essential element, in my opinion.

This dish is amazing and the directions are spot-on. I am not a great cook by any stretch, but the salmon was cooked perfectly and all 7 of my guests were enamored, including a woman from Seattle who said when she lived there she had salmon once a week and this was some of the best she had ever had. A couple of notes from my experience: making the glaze and sectioning the oranges ahead of time makes for a lot more sanity if you are having a dinner party. That was what I did and it worked out well. Also, tamarind paste and dried chilis are not as easy as you might think to find (at least in Fort Lauderdale). I finally tracked them down at an international gourmet market so be aware you might need to make a special trip. Last, I mistakenly forgot to put in the chopped cilantro, which I'm sure would have been delicious, but it was just as good without it!

I gave this recipe 4 forks becuae it is absolutely fool proof. The chile glaze is fantastic, the orange salsa is a must and the presentation is outstanding. I plate this using large lettuce leaves topped with couscous (the Lemon Heb Cous Cous from this site), topped with the salmon and the salsa. A winner.

Delicious and interesting. Salsa a refreshing surprise! Tamarind sauce was a snap since I found a very good bottle of commercial tamarind/bourbon sauce. (Also made sauce from scratch but think I prefer the commercial.) I used a scant 1/4 tsp of fennel seed and really don't think I would use it again. Fennel is so strong. I want to taste all the salmon, orange and tamarind flavors. Cracked pepper is a must. Aso it works to bake this at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Thanks.

Good, but not fantastic. The glaze, while tasty and unusual, was a PITA to make. The orange salsa was necessary to the dish, IMO. Made it for spouse's birthday dinner and while he's a salmon lover, there are other dishes on this site he'd prefer to this. It was a nice change of pace, though. I may or may not make it again. If I do, you can be sure I'll double the glaze, so as to try it on chicken.

Rating: 4
The orange salsa was great - the chili sauce messy to make, but could easily be made ahead. We didn't have tamarind but,added a little Pickapepper sauce, lemon rind and one chili pepper for extra kick. We also made this recipe using chicken breasts and it was wonderful!

This was great!!! The chile glaze was not the most excellent dish. I couldn't find any tamarind paste. I added more ancho chiles for an extra kick. All in all, this was a very good dish. The orange salsa is excellent, the perfect complement to the salmon.

This recipe involved a lot of steps, but was not difficult nor did it involve any complicated techniques or watching. Tamarind was hard to find (check an Indian grocery), but everyone raved about it! Don't skip the salsa - it really made the dish complete. I also will try grilling next time.

great recipe,very tasty. Made it twice already, the second time since I had lots of mangoes, used them to make the salsa. Everyone raved about it and requested the recipe

A good dinner party recipe. Not too terribly difficult, but looks impressive. I was actually hoping for a spicier glaze. I'd put in more chiles next time. Made it on the grill, which is always tastier in my book.

Rating: 4
This glaze is truly worth the effort but as suggested below double the amount and freeze some. I used 3 ancho chilis and it fairly spicy until I strained it, next time I would use more chili or not strain. The end result is not as spicy as you might think. I omitted the peppercorns & fennel & grilled instead of broiling. I thought the salsa was mediocre compared to the delicious glaze. Would serve with rice or couscous next time.

Rating: 4
Simply put...divine. I,too, had a hard time finding the tamarind, therfore, i substituted it for the closest thing my grocer carried,guava paste found in the latino foods section. Instead of broiling the salmon, i tried grilling. FANTASTIC! i continually coated the fish with the glaze during the grilling process. Two thumbs up on this one.

Rating: 4
This is by far THE best salmon I ever tasted! Had a tough time finding the Tamarind Paste, and not knowing what it was, I wasn't sure if I could omit it. Now that I've tasted the paste itself, I don't think it's an essential ingredient. I love trying newly prepared food and rarely make the same thing twice, but this is DEFINITELY a keeeper! (It worked very well with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and green beans)

This was truly excellent! Very complex tasting and a beautiful presentation. I found the chili glaze a bit time consuming but I made enough to freeze some and that will save me time next time. The orange salsa REALLY made this dish TRULY special!!

Rating: 4
Wonderful and fairly easy recipe. It is a great dish to make when friends are coming over for dinner, as much of it can be made in advance and the salmon cooks in 6 minutes. I am sure you can get creative with different glazes if you have a hard time finding the tamarind.

It could be that I am overly influenced by the gleam in my girlfriend's eye and the touch of her soft lips, but I love this recipe. It was the entree of our two-year anniversary dinner. The result is as good as any dish we have been served in Washington's best restaurants. The tanginess of the salsa juxtaposed against the bite of the chile glaze is fabulous. I suggest a piece of orange for each bite, because I missed the orange when it wasn't there.

This is such a great dish! As I made the chili glaze I feared that it would overpower the salmon, but it was really just perfect. (I recommend making a double-batch and storing half of it to save time in the future; the glaze is quite time-consuming.)I made the dish just as the recipe read with one exception: I omitted the olive oil in the salsa. (Who needs oil bogging down a nice fresh salsa?)The salsa was good, but maybe a little cilantro-heavy; next time around (and there WILL be a next time around!) I'll cut down on the cilantro a little or maybe use a different citrus salsa altogether.

This was a very interesting dish, great for serving to guests who like trying nw tastes. I couldn't find the tamarind paste so I used 2 tbsp. of the concentrate. It was a bit bitter but still tasted good. I will definitely try it again. Great with the fennel quinoa as recommended!

Rating: 4
EXCELLENT!!! I'm not a salmon lover, but this was well worth the time. I added fresh lime juice to the salsa . Unable to fine tamarind paste so used a fig/onion marinade, very good. Will still look for tamarind paste. Used the 3 ancho chilis and added a little tabasco to heighten the twang. Served it with brown & wild rice mushroom pilaf, spinach strawverry salad, fresh asparagras and the frozen boysenberry white chocolate parfait from epicurious! An outstanding meal for our guests!!!

Rating: 4
This is the best salmon recipe I've ever had. My boyfriend and I make it at least once a month. (We make extra chili glaze to use the next time.) The quinoa/fennel pilaf that was featured in the same Gourmet issue is a welcome change from the usual rice and pasta side dishes and goes perfectly with the salmon! You have to try it!

I have prepared this great recipe twice this season and it is without a doubt, my familly and freinds favorite. Both times I lightly smoked the salmon with mesquite chips on the BBQ, and finished the glaze step in the oven. I found the recipe much more time consuming than suggested and in the future (especially if entertaining) will prep all the ingrediants ahead. I found the leftovers even tastier the day after. *Note* find tamarind paste at an Indian or Asian food market. Yum Yum

This dish was awesome!We live in England and the British don't always have a palate for South/Western-inspired recipes,so it was with great pride that I gave all 12 guests the recipe when they asked for it. It was an enormous success.Thanks epicurious for making it happen.

I've now made this twice for dinner parties, and each time wonderful reviews. I initially had trouble finding tamarind - everyone at the Indian stores recommended I use tamarind concentrate, but the sauce didn't thicken. I finally found it in an Asian store as "tamarind candy". Both the sauce and the salsa taste like there is too much vinegar in the recipe, but placed on the fish, it's perfect. I served it with steamed asparagus and cilantro cumin rice (found on epicurious).

Yummy, yummy, yummy!! I made this for a dinner party and it was perfect. The chile glaze was a great accompaniment - the spices were subtle enough not to overpower the natural flavor of the fish, yet added a delicate flavor.

This was delicious. I used a little less chile after looking at the other reviews, and grilled one large fillet instead of broiling individual fillets. It was more tricky to caramelize the glaze but still was great. However, my salsa was too runny/not chunky enough. Maybe I wasn't very good at de-membraning the orange. But it still tasted very good. Served on bed of butter lettuce with tomato/basil israeli couscous.

I cheated and it still tasted wonderful. I stopped short of making the glaze and bbq'd the salmon instead of broiling it. Grilled vegies on the side. Another hit with the family!

This dish is fantastic. We hosted Supper club this month. I cook fish lots and this is by far the best Salmon recipe! The salsa was glorious! The chile glaze ended up a bit to thin so I added corn starch, the reason may be I could not find Tamarind paste so I used Tamarind Chutney. Oh, I forgot to put the fennel seeds on too! I served this with Spring rolls as an appetizer, Cold Cucumber &yellow pepper soup with crab meat and chives, Wild rice Salad (which had cranberries & apricots in it, spring vegetables with shallots and Lemon and Chocolate Souffles with Creamy Caramel Sauce! The dinner was wonderful.

That was fantastic....I couldn't taste the salmon! The chili glaze, fennel and salsa were brilliant.

Wow! I usually do not like salty and sweet combinations, but this is a definite exception. The salsa is amazing and I have used it on pork as well. While the chili glaze is ok, I found it to be a bit overpowering. I now simply marinate the fish in soy,lemon, brown sugar, olive oil, garlic, ginger and crushed red pepper. A much more subtle flavor, and it does not compete with the most excellent salsa. Feed this recipe to guests, and they will ask why you are not a chef!

This is by far the most delicious salmon recipe I've ever made. I couldn't find tamarind paste so substituted guava paste; and instead of the chiles mentioned (also unavailable in local stores) I used a mix of chili powder and Japanese red pepper spice blend. The glaze was incredibly good!

This recipe was delicious and very easy to make! It was a hit with everyone! The only thing I may change would be to omit the black pepper grounds and fennel seeds, I am not sure that they made that much difference to the tast and were somewhat difficult to remove before serving.

Wow! Fantastic. I just made this for dinner! It was quick and delicious. I prefer lots of textures when taking a bite and this recipe had it. I would not puree the salsa. I thought the texture of the salsa went perfect with the dish and it looked beautiful. I served the Salmon on a bed of rice that I had mixed with some Olive Tapenade. Then, served the salsa on top. It was beautiful! My husband thought we were at a restaurant. I would serve this dish for guests... Definitely! I used premium navel oranges for the salsa. I also crushed the fennel and pepper together with a mortar and pestle. I left the ancho chilis in the paste without straining. I would do the same next time.

This is a beautiful dish! I used 1 can of canned mandarin oranges instead of the fresh oranges. The salsa is devine. I think it's a good idea to scrape off the peppercorns before serving - it's not nice to bite them.

This was a solid dish and got great reviews. I agree, however, with the reveiwer who wanted to play with the consistancy of the salsa-- a rough puree might be better. Then you could serve the salmon in a puddle of salsa with a little cilantro sprinkled over it or maybe a piece of orange on top as a garnish. Also, I reduced the chili by half and it was still quite zingy.
