YUM, everyone loved this! We made a few small changes: added 1.5 TBS Purevia (you can use sugar or another sub) and used white pepper for a little kick. Also used paprika powder - couldn't find fresh - and 3 TBS white vinegar instead of 2. Didn't do the salting of the cukes to start. Great, simple salad!

This is my favorite kind of dish; simple ingredients, simply prepared. I used my mandoline to slice the cucumbers and onions, and followed previous posters' advice, using 5T water and 2 T rice vinegar. Perfect! My Slovenian father used to make a similar salad, but also used bell peppers and pumpkin seed oil. I prefer this version!

This is a simple and delicious salad, though I agree that the vinegar to water ratio is totally wrong. My Hungarian grandmother would agree that 5 T water to 2 T vinegar is much more appropriate.

I made this because of the reviews, but I think there is something seriously wrong with this recipe. I'm Hungarian and it is much too acidy/vinegary as is, and I had to add almost equal parts water instead of the 2 teaspoons as the recipe states. Even with more water added, it was terrible - had to add about 1-1/2 Tablespoons of sugar and 1/4 tsp ground white pepper, and salt to taste. At this point, I almost threw it out becaus it had no flavor. Luckily, I placed it in the frig for a couple hours and the result was very, very good. I generally have very good luck with Epicurious recipes but this, as is, is troubling. After the changes, I would give this salad 3.5 forks.

I love this dish with sour cream added to it. Its absolutely fantastic this way. And of course use the absolute best paprika available "Szeged" is what I prefer..Add a sprinkle of sugar to even out the bite of the garlic and garnish with pepper rings.

This is the sheer basic, sort of like "boil water, add eggs, until done." The only thing that's pivotal is the salt and draining of water. After that, do your own thing. I mix up some dijon, various vinegars, garlic, et voila. As for paprika, I do like Pride of Szeged, though if you have access to a Whole Foods/Freshfields, their house brand is just as good, and cheaper.

My husbands grandfather came to this country fom Hungary in 1906. He was the head chef at Luchows in N.Y. for many years. We have been making this recipe for sooo many years, handed down from him. It is by far the best cucumber salad recipe there is. I don't like cucumbers, but this I love. The key to this recipe is to cut the cukes very thin and to sprinkle with salt each layer. I often let it sit for several hours. Then it is important to really squeeze all the water out. Our recipe is for 5 cukes and the dressing is 3/4 C. vinegar,4 TB. oil, and 2 TB. sugar and of course the paprika before serving.

This is the real Hungarian cucumber salad - simple yet tasty. For an added touch (this is how a lot of Hungarians do it) make individual bowls and sprinkle a stripe of paprika and one of ground pepper so as to make cross shape. Looks good, tastes good.

This is good, but try adding a bit of sugar and some fresh chopped dill!

I have made this recipe often as did my mother and grandmother before her. The thing that I do different is to also add the onions to the cucumber and salt then squeeze out excess liquid .

Guests love it, but try a white/rice-wine vinegar combination in case they're acid-shy. And don't stint on the "Pride of Szeged" paprika!
