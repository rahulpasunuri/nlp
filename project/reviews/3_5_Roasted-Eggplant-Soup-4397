I make this every winter. Everyone loves it. As a plus, it fights off colds! I don't use the cream; it makes the soup too heavy. If you have vegetarians in your life, you can easily substitute vegetable stock for the chicken stock.

Fine recipe, simple and rather quick compared to some others. I switched the fatty cheese to silken tofu and the creamer to non-dairy creamer which worked just fine ( I'm vegan if you didn't guess). Essentially just those little changes were made and it tasted great

The soup is awesome. I just cant restrain myself when I am making soup, so it is impossible for me to actually follow the recipe as it is listed. As a result, I added a stalk of celery and a yellow squash. I also used stock from the last time I boiled corn. With all these adjustments I am not sure if the soup I have is actually the soup that was intended. However, it is really good. One problem: This was my first time cooking eggplant. Scoping it out of the skin was not easy as the recipe made it out to be. Trying to remove the skin of a 400 degree vegetable is not fun, and scoping isnt really the action that I did. It was more of a cutting. I needed a fork and a knife. Hints for new cooks: get an emulsifier. They are so much less messy than using a blinder for soups like this.

I didn't have any thyme, but the soup had plenty of flavor from the garlic. Also used creme fraiche instead of cream and goat cheese. It was delicious, but I think I might skin the tomatoes next time.

I was so excited about finding a soup that had the potential to be a great soup loaded with veggies. Sadly it was really boring in taste. I did use sour cream instead of whipping cream to reduce the calories, but I don't think that would have changed the flavor. I think more garlic, spicy peppers or something is needed.

This soup is really quite nice. I added a handful of mushrooms and carrots to the broth (used vegetable instead of chicken). The smell while it was simmering was heavenly. Great flavor and very comforting!

My guests always enjoy this soup. The most important thing to note is that this recipe makes 4 very small portions, suitable for a very shallow soup bowl. I prefer the soup cold, and it definitely needs some cream--but only about 1/3 - 1/2 cup, not a full cup--to give it a lovely texture and taste. I might cut down on the garlic next time. Also, do NOT simmer the soup for 45 minutes--that's way too long--30 minutes is plenty.

I did it without the thyme and instead used some pepper. Very good and great consistency.

We really enjoyed this soup-- didn't need to add the cream. It's simple, easy, tasty and healthy. We'll definitely make it again.

Boring and bland...fostered creativitity, however. Added lots of salt, pepper, garlic, onions and cheese (any kind at this point...brie was around) to rescue the soup, which was very boring and tasteless. Also, reduced the soup to 2/3 its final volume to concentrate the flavours. Do NOT follow the recipe.

This was very good. I roasted a red bell pepper along with everything else, and it gave the soup an excellent color. The smaller garlic bulbs I used charred pretty badly, so I will definitely only use big ones next time. I do not recommend using dried thyme, as it was a little twiggy while eating. No cream, but I did crumble in a little bit of feta on top of a serving - not necessary, but it was pleasant to get that little bit of saltiness every now and then. I may experiment with adding curry to it some time. My roommate just went up for a 3rd bowl!

This is soup is just fine without cream and goat cheese, but in the end I did add about 3 tbsp of cream just to add some depth to the soup. Either way, it is a beautiful, nutritious, and hearty soup with unexpected flavors. Note: I find that eggplant dishes are always better on day #2. In order to give the flavor time to develop, I roasted the vegetables and simmered them in chicken broth the night before, then pureed the ensemble before re- warming for dinner.

This is an excellent soup. I made some homemade croutons and put them on top before serving. It was a great addition. I never included the goat cheese.

I added basil and parmesan rinds while cooking. Even without those additions, I think this is nothing more interesting than a very good pasta sauce.

I thought this soup tasted good "as is" but was definitely missing something so we added egg noodles.Next time we'll add chicken.

Surprisingly delicious -- I was so tired of making ratatouille and this was a welcome recipe for eggplant. I modified the recipe by adding one yellow and one orange bell pepper and roasted them along with the other vegetables (which I coated with an olive oil spray). Instead of cream, I used low fat yogurt (just be careful not to boil the soup or it will curdle). And instead of thyme, I used herbes de Provence.

I added 1/4 cup of 10% cream and 80 grams of crumbled feta in the soup. Very good and healthy! I do think it absolutely needs the cheese to give it some depth.

The flavor of this easy-to-prepare soup was incredible. It absolutely needs the cream, but not necessarily the goat cheese. Mine came out a bit thicker than expected, and could easily have been used as a flavorful pasta sauce. It was a big hit.

Just like the other reviewers have said...this recipe is amazing. My boyfriend grows asian eggplant in his garden and always gets a healthy crop, so we are always looking for new ways to cook them. This soup is now my official favorite. I cut the cream to 1/4 cup and added some sage and rosemary but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I can't wait to make it again.

I made this recipe to use fresh eggplant from my garden. Substituted fat free half and half for the cream, cooking just until heated through so the half and half would not clump or become stringy. Used feta instead of goat cheese. A nice recipe with roasted flavor and a summertime staple.

Rating: 4
Wonderful, rich late summer/early fall soup! I suggest lifting the skin off the roasted tomatoes before adding them to the soup. I sauteed sage and thyme in a little butter before adding the roasted veggies. I used water and one vegetable bouillon instead of stock. No cream needed, though the indulgence appeals to me, and maybe next time I'll try that. I'll make this again.

Very good. Lovely eggplant texture. Make sure to keep an eye on it while it is simmering; I did not and must have had the flame on a little high because the majority of the liquid evaporated off.

Really nice. I made it without the cream. Placed a cup of cooked jasmine rice in the bottom of the bowl. Yummy.

Luscious! I grilled the vegetables which gave the soup a nice, smoky flavor. I topped with parmigiano reggiano to finish. I did not use the cream either- it did not need it. The texture was very velvety and smooth.

This is subtle but very good. I used feta instead of goat cheese and it worked well. I'd roast the veggies a bit longer next time to give a more pronounced roasted flavor.

Made this with the last of the season eggplant and tomatoes from our garden. It tastes great without the cream and cheese but with them added it takes the soup to a whole other level.

Rating: 3
Absolutely delicious. I put the eggplant pulp through a food mill to get rid of the seeds and next time will either put the tomatoes through too, to get rid of the skin, or puree the finished soup more (the tomato skins rolled up into little bits I didn't like the mouth feel of). If you're going to put anything through a food mill, though, you may want to roast more of that ingredient in the beginning, because you're going to lose some pulp to the mill.

Great taste and easy to make. Would definitely make again. I used fat free half and half and it was nice and creamy without the fat. Goat cheese is a must. Good for a cold night.

I have made this soup three times in the last few weeks since discovering it. It is just terrific. I have used sungold cherry tomatoes off the vine in place of the large tomatoes and it has been delicious. I agree that the cream is not necessary. . . a full bodied soup without. The goat cheese adds a nice richness too. We will continue to make this all summer!

This was delicious & very easy to make. I doubled the recipe for 7 people and prepared it a day ahead of time but didn't put the cream in until the day I was serving it - it warmed up beautifully and was full of flavour. Two of my guests asked for seconds and another asked for the recipe. Wonderful use of eggplant.

My husband loves eggplant and I try to find new ways to make it. This soup was fantastic, I have tried it with milk, cream, or without either and it is just wonderful. Very easy to make,though the roasting takes a while, and one time when short of time, I shortened the time somewhat and it worked fine anyway. Also did some of the cooking of the soup in the microwave to save time. We love it!!

Rating: 4
Delicious and very easy. I'd like to repeat what another reviewer said about the flavor developing over time -- make this a couple of days ahead and it's even better than when just made. I have not used the cream or the goat cheese as a relative has a very restricted diet, and it's still been wonderful. You can of course vary the ratio of the vegetables to bring out your favorite flavors. Takes a little while to make, but you can stop and start, and the actual working time is pretty short.

Rating: 3
This was nice but needed a lot of additional salt and pepper and got better with each day that passed - definintely make ahead. Also, we dumped in the goat cheese and stirred it in completely, instead of crumbling on top - made it much more flavorful. Manual food mill takes the seeds out nicely.

Rating: 4
This is a very tasty dish, however my first attempt had to be discarded due to the roasting pan that I used for the vegetables. I would strongly advise using non-reactive cookware for the roasting. Other than that, it is a realatively simple recipie. Also, feta cheese can be substituted and works well.

This dish is very easy to make, and tastes fantastic. Cooking time takes a while, but actual prep is a snap. To pull some of the bitterness out of the eggplant; I quartered it, salted it, and let it sit 30 min before roasting. I also added a couple pinches of fresh savory and oregano from the garden.

Deceptively easy and delicious too! Look out for the eggplant seeds, they become bitter after roasting and don't blend well. The majority of them can easily be scooped out of the cooked eggplant. I skipped the cream and goat cheese and increased the broth. Use a handheld stick blender for these kinds of soups - so easy!

I am quite the amateur when it comes to cooking and it came out great. I went with 4 cups of stock and the consistency was just right; I wouldn't want it thinner. Some of the garlic charred in the oven and I was afraid it would ruin the flavor but it didn't. It was quite hot when I served it. I think it would be best served lukewarm or slightly warmer. We used a whole ball of goat cheese instead of crumbling it, serving the soup over small "cheeseballs" in the bowl or chopping off big chunks and scooping it up with the soup. Yummy!

Oh, I garnished the soup with chopped scallions instead of using goat cheese - it worked well.

I made this soup today and it is wonderful. I took Laura's idea about adding curry to this recipe. Since all these flavors are screaming for curry, I didn't think it could go wrong. It didn't! Thanks for a great idea. Since I used curry and don't care about this dish being vegetarian, I used beef broth instead of chicken and it gave it a real richness these hardy vegtables need. I will definately make this recipe again.

I made this soup this afternoon and it is wonderful. Instead of thyme I substituted about a teaspoon of curry powder. I only used enough cream (about 1/4 of a cup) to increase the richness slightly. It is tasty and will definitely make it again.

I love eggplant, I love tomato, I love onion, I LOVE garlic. So imagine my surprise when I made this soup and ended up not liking it. Perhaps I should have seeded the eggplant before roasting it, or perhaps I should have used roma tomatoes, but something about the resulting sourish flavor and the blender consistency of the soup turned my stomach. I tried it without the cream first, and it was so-so. Then I tried it with cream, and it was horrible: the cream didn't blend with the soup very well, and it turned it a strange beigey color that wasn't very appetizing to look at. I think I'll save my eggplants, tomatoes and onions for more deserving recipes.

I had a similar soup in a landmark Washington DC restaurant. The only difference was they reserved a dollop of the eggplant meat as a garnish for each bowl. Hoping to replicate it I looked it up here and there it was. Perhaps the restaurant had visited your site as well.

I made this recipe for the first time for a group of people. I was a little nervous about the 'look' of the soup until I added the cream at the end -- the depth of the brown shade was gratefully lightened!
