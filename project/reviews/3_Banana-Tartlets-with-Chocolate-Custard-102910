I had four egg yolks left ove from another recioe that needed to be used, and this fit the bill. However, i only made the custard, and added biurbon instead of rum, and four ounces chocolate instead of two. Poured the custard into teacups to chill for a nice little dessert. I also used soy milk, as my daughter cannot tolerate milk from cows. I do think i will make the whole thing, tarts and all, on a day when i have more time.

Though this recipe was relatively easy to prepare and tasted good, it wasn't great. I probably won't make it again.

Made these for a holiday dinner--really nice recipe! Custard and crust are very easy to prepare. I topped mine with fresh whipped cream.
