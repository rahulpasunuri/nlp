Whatever you do, do NOT bake this for 20 minutes. It's far too long. Ten, 12 tops.

YUM! Only trick is where to hide it before the party so that we hosts don't eat every bite. Used a wonderful sweet paprika that we got in Marrakech.

Great snack. It was all gone by the end of the party. Used Hungarian hot paprika (was all I had) and cut back a bit on the cayenne.

Good! the popcorn gave it a diffrent twist to those other mixes and i liked the oomph of the worcestshire sauce. tasty and easy

I really liked the technique of using whites to adhere the seasonings, but was disappointed in myself for later serving to vegetarians and vegans. My paprika was not of good quality and left an odd taste in the mouth.

Why would you waste your time and ingredients on this loser, when the Chex Mix all time classic is so very much better??? This was an awful recipe

I made this recipe exactly as instructed and I could find no one who liked it very much. What a waste of perfectly good ingredients! Made me realize how impt it is to check epicurious.com before making the recipes in Gourmet (although usually quite wonderful). Your reviewers' comments are invaluable as time-savers and troubleshooters.

I made this for Superbowl Sunday. I liked it but didnt think it was fabulous. My husband thought it was really good though. I made a lot so stored the rest and he ate it as a snack everyday. Was over in no time!!!

I didn't change anything in the recipe, and my guests and I loved it. I will make it again and again.

This is really a strange recipe. I really didn't care for it but had it on the tables at a cocktail buffet this weekend and the men loved it. My husband has finished what was left over and says he really likes it. I did change the spices a bit, using allspice instead of everything except the paprika and cayanne. Also omitted the worchestershire sauce. Like I said, I probably wouldn't make it again but everyone else liked it.

This is the worst thing I have ever made. I would give it 0 forks if possible. Try the curried spiced pecans from November Bon Appetit instead, they are fabulous
