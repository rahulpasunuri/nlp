Just finished making this recipe; like others, I found it not chocolatey enough, so I used all of the ganache. Yes, this produces a huge quantity of icing, so I divided the mixture before incorporating the ganache. The result is VERY nice - great texture, consistency! I look forward to decorating with it.

Great Icing for sure.

I have made this recipe a few times. I think it is delicious. I did cut back on the liquor and replaced with a bit of cream. It was a bit time consuming I thought and a little bit more difficult to decorate with. (I am a cake decorator, so it may not be as important to some). At first it was really fluffy, mousse-y like, but after awhile it settled down enough for me to do a basketweave technique with it. It will be hard as a rock if you refrigerate it as another poster mentioned(most buttercreams need to be a room temp to decorate). I wouldnt see the need to refrigerate this recipe. meringue powder and a bit of milk dont require refrigeration. The sugars in the buttercream act as a preservative. Also in case you were wondering, ganache is fine to be left out for a couple of days as well.

A lot depends on the liqueur you use -- the taste is predominant, so choose carefully grasshopper. The full recipe completely filled my 6Qt mixer when I whipped it -- cut it in half for a smaller bowl. VERY IMPORTANT -- I followed the recipe precisely, used table salt, and I ended up with salty crunchy bits because there's not enough liquid to dissolve the salt. Recommend dissolving the salt in the milk before adding it to the mixture. I left the frosting in the fridge overnight (to try to dissolve the salt) and this A.M. it was hard as a rock. Will have to be brought to room temp and probably re-whipped before I can use it. At room temp last night, it was too soft. I just don't like the consistency either way. Plus the cake should be refrigerated since it has meringue powder in it (and milk). Not sure most people would realize this, so it might be a food- poisoning incident in the making. The recipe has potential, but will need substantial tweaking.

I thought this was good, but not the best chocolate frosting I've ever had. It was very sweet and not chocolatey enough for my taste. I added 3 oz. of unsweetened melted chocolate and that helped. I used Vermeer chocolate liquer because I had an almost-full bottle in the house and it was good in the frosting. I loved the consistency, but I don't think this is worth all the work.

i tried this recipe because I was looking for a unique Chocolate Buttercream recipe that called for real chocolate instead of just cocoa and this recipe met my criteria. the taste is quite unique...maybe it was the Chocolate liquer I used, but at first thats all i tasted...which i wasn't happe about but after i let it sit over night it was DELICIOUS! I used this frosting with the Double layer chocolate cake and my MIL thought it tasted just like a fancy slice of chocolate cake you get from a restaurant...definitly a keeper

I made 1/2 the recipe and found it to have a wierd aftertaste. I could taste the shortening flavor, so I added more ganache, cocoa powder and vanilla. It was just o.k. I was dissappointed after reading all of the reviews.

This is the best chocolate frosting that I have ever tasted. You barely need a cake! I made the full recipe and had enough for a 3-layer 10 inch and a 3-layer 8 inch. Yummy!!!

When all is said and done, this is chocolate frosting, albeit an expensive version with the Godiva liqueur and ganache, but not a buttercream. I found it VERY sweet and did not enjoy the texture once it hardened.

This is outstanding, I will never use another frosting recipe again. It makes a lot which is good, as there is enough for two cakes. I couldn't rave enough.

This is the best chocolate buttercream i have ever tasted. thick and rich and forgiving to the cook. Messy to make as it fills my kitchen aid 5 qt bowl to the brim, but worth every second of cleaning. I made this to use for a couple of purposes. made it ahead and put in the fridge for 4 days (keeps perfectly in a covered tupperware bowl). took out some, rewhipped it with a little whipping cream and orange zest and grand marnier to use as the filling for a buche de noel. gorgeous. rewhipped some with just a little whipping cream to frost the outside of the cake. perfect consistency. Also used as is (just let it come to room temperature) to fill the layers of a 2 layer flourless chocolate cake. again, perfect consistency. I used the rest as plain chocolate buttercream on the chocolate cake recipe from the back of the hershey's can. amazing. This will replace every other chocolate icing recipe I have ever used.

This is by far the best chocolate frosting I have made or tasted, it has great chocolate flavor.

Give me a spoon! This is the best chocolate buttercream I've ever tasted. I love how there's enough for more than one cake...that leaves some for midnight spoonfuls! It also freezes very well in an airtight container.

I just finished making this buttercream frosting; very time consuming, but well worth it! This recipe makes enough frosting for 2 cakes, so beware. Right before I made the frosting, I placed the cake layers in the freezer. Slightly freezing the cakes helped to set the buttercream as I frosted the cakes, allowing for a smooth frosting. I would recommend buying high quality chocolate and cocoa when making this buttercream recipe.

As stated, this buttercream is absolutely fabulous beyond compare. Beware though that the recipe does make more than enough for two cakes. I was just able to mix the icing in my 4 1/2 qt. KitchenAid. You won't be sorry you made it..I've already bought the chef's book and I've only discovered this chocolate fudge cake and icing about two weeks ago..Great book too!
