Love this recipe and always get requests for more. I substitute (1) of the packages of cream cheese with mascarpone cheese. Cake is not as dense and has a wonderful texture. Also substitute chocolate wafer cookies for the chocolate covered grahams and sometimes add nuts to the crust. Don't care for them in the cake. Think it ruins the texture.

I have made this recipe several times with much success. As a previous reviewer, I have also subsituted the frangelico for amaretto but reduced amount to 2/3c and cover with sliced almonds. Mmm, mmm. Lip smacking good!

I have made this recipe multiple times and received rave reviews each time. I omit the nuts, and use (1 cup crushed) plain chocolate cookies for the crust instead of chocolate-covered graham crackers.

Amazing cheesecake recipe! My husband wanted a chocolate-almond cheesecake so I used Amaretto not Frangelico in the cheescake mixture (and left out the almond flavoring.) Took other suggestions and put nuts in crust - everyone loved it like this.

I did everything wrong on my first cheesecake and it was still amazing! (It was in the oven for 2 mins when I notices the 4 eggs at room temp on the counter). It was so pretty before I screwed it up! I dumped it out of the crust and blended and baked. It was great. I did not have chocolate covered grahams, just chocolate. And I blended the almonds into the crust as previous people have recommended. I will do this again without drinking the Frangelico while I am baking! Hehe!

I made this for our 4th of July picnic. No one thought it was special, including me. I'm a cheesecake lover and have made many far superior to this one. This one was so-so and I won't make it again.

Made this for Easter for a friend and she loved it. Said it was fabulous. The only thing I added was that I frosted the sides of the cake with some cocoa whipped cream, and then added some sliced almonds. Originally, the sides were a mess when I took it out of the pan, but this was an easy fix and it looked beautiful. Will definitely make again.

I feel like I've died and gone to cheesecake heaven:) Took reviewers suggestions and made only 2 changes: added the chopped almonds to the crust instead of the filling and I used chocolate wafer cookies for the crust instead of the chocolate-covered graham cracker cookies. This cake was out of this world! Everyone should try it at least once.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it earned rave reviews from my husband's "tough on new cheesecakes because NO ONE makes it like Grandma and how dare anyone try a funky new recipe when the old one is just fine" family. I took the advice of the other reviewers and took the almonds out of the cake and added them (plus some ground hazelnuts) to the crust, using ground chocolate graham crackers (not choco covered, just the choco graham). I will absolutely make this again for another event.

This is a flavorful cheesecake, but it's not one I'd make again. While the frangelico and almond extract give a heavenly, nutty smell, the toasted almond pieces interfere with the cheesecake's smooth texture. If I had it to do over, I'd have mixed the almonds into the cookie crust instead of into the batter. My other gripe is with the presentation. The marbled surface looks nice, but when all is said and done and the cake is fully chilled, the edges look terrible. I've made dozens of cheesecakes, but this recipe just didn't work well for me.

I made this dessert for company and they ranted and raved over it. They even asked for seconds after eating a huge meal beforehand! One thing I would eliminate is the almonds. Next time, I'll add it to the crust mixture instead of mixing it in the cheesecake. It's strange to have the consistency of eating something crunchy when cheesecake is known for it's smooth, creamy texture. I took the advice of other reviewers and mixed Frangelico with extra creamy whipped cream and added it to the side of each slice. Big hit and nice way to end a meal!

I made this for our wine group and 11 women want another one next month! We have NEVER repeated a dessert! I did change the crust to 1/3 c. hazelnuts, ground in the processor, 2/3 c. graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 c. sugar, and 1/4 c. melted butter. I also decorated with Frangelico whipped cream - about 1/4 c. added to 1-1/2 c. whipping cream and garnished with whole toasted almonds dipped in melted semi-sweet chocolate.

wow. I am in the middle of making this cheesecake RIGHT NOW, and the BATTER is so good I know i'll be making it again! What did that clown put in it? FLOUR? BLECH... no wonder he ended up with something repulsive... it makes me crazy when people tell you they changed 3/4 of the recipe and then tell you they would never make the recipe again! I can't wait for Easter so we can EAT THIS!

Outstanding cheesecake! This is a recipe that will impress any guest! Make the frangelico whipped cream, it will definitely be worth it!

Have to wonder with some amusement what Rajiv's non-sucktacular cheesecakes taste like. I guess he considers his 6 six years of baking cheesecakes a real master, given the probable range of experience of cooks on this board. Thought this one was good, but then a bottle of the friar's nectar doesn't need any additional ingredients to improve it, does it?

I've made this cheesecake three times now. It's wonderful. I agree with the tips: no almonds and add a few more cookies to the crust. My guests are so impressed and it's easy to make. I serve it with whipped cream with a little Frangelico mixed in. So good!

I substituted whipping cream for the sour cream, and omitted the extra egg yolk. Also, I began making this in the morning, and it was ready to serve that same evening. Everyone thought it was delicious. I was surprised by how easy it was to make. I'd definitely make this again, especially when I wanted to impress someone!

Wow! This is one delicious cheesecake--by far the most interesting and tasty I have ever had!! Yummmmm! With a chocolate glaze and frangelico cream, it is truly a grand presentation. Without those extras, it still smashing with its marbled top (and still oh so Yummy!) Do try this one...you won't be sorry.

Rajiv, check your ingredients again as you may have inadvertently measured incorrectly. I made this exactly as printed except I did pour a dark chocolate glaze over the top.My guests raved and raved. It is absolutely divine. Unlike European cheesecakes which are VERY dense and not very sweet (which may be what you prefer) this one is silky, creamy, rich and melts in your mouth. I made a bouquet of chocolate leaves interspersed with sliced almonds for the top since it was for the dessert buffet at my New Year's Eve party. People went back for seconds and thirds of this one!!! This is a definate keeper and impressive for a party!

THIS SUCKS. The sheer amount of Frangelico makes this cheesecake mushy, flimsy, and yucky. No substance. My other cheesecakes are rich, filling, and creamy. If you want to use 1/4 Frangelico, add at least 1/4 cup of flour to the batter. Decrease the eggs to 2 only and increase the cream cheese to at least 5 bars. I've been making cheesecake for 6 years now, and this is THE WORST I've ever made. The crust, however, was darn good but only because I added 1 tsp. almond extract to the graham crackers.

I served this cheesecake as a Thanksgiving Day dessert and it was a HUGE hit! I added a chocolate frangelico sauce with frangelico whipped cream before serving it. My husband enjoyed it so much he requested it as a replacement for a birthday cake!

Rich and creamy. Made for a cheese-cake loving crowd and everyone took "leftovers". I must have initially misread the ingredient "chocolate covered graham crackers" and bought plain chocolate grahams---maybe that's why the crust didn't get soggy. Flavors were wonderful.

Found a way to avoid the soggy crust so many reviewers wrote of: couldn't find "chocolate-covered graham crackers," instead used 1/2 pkg of the Nabisco chocolate wafers (about 4.5 oz) plus a 4.4 oz pkg of Bahlsen Choco Leibniz cookies (essentially chocolate covered butter cookies) and that combination processed with the butter made a crust that was nicely chocolately and stayed "dry." I also left in the almonds and almond extract and served with Frangelico whipped cream. Was very happy to find such a delectable dessert using Frangelico, which I have loved ever since a girlfriend gave me some one Christmas. Next time may try with a chocolate glaze

Obviously I'm in the minority here, but I wasn't doing cartwheels over this. I had the same soggy crust problem, which was very disappointing. Even though I am a diehard chocoholic, the chocolate in this didn't do anything for me. My vote for most phenomenal cheesecake goes to the Roasted banana with macadamia crust from "The Best American Recipes of 1999."

This was the first cheesecake I've ever made - and it was excellent! I left out the ground almonds and used Nabisco chocolate wafers for the crust. I served it with frangelico whipped cream and it was divine.

I made this for a wedding shower. Out of this world ! My friends are still raving ! I added a chocolate glaze and omitted the almonds.

Incredible. Something about that Frangelico does amazing things to cheesecake...it doesn't need the almonds or the almond extract...I'll bet it would still be incredible without the chocolate. I had the soggy crust problem that others have mentioned, think I'll try a few more cookies next time. Almost didn't try this due to the $$$ of a bottle of liquor that I had never heard of before - sure am glad I did! Served it to a guest and the look on his face with the first bite was priceless.

I've been making cheesecakes for twenty years, and this one is the absolute best! Made it for Valentine's Day with a Lindt bittersweet chocolate glaze and decorated it with whipped cream and a heart made out of raspberries. My husband was so impressed that he took a photo! He's requested it for his birthday this weekend. It is divine (and so is he!)

Everyone who ate a piece of this cheesecake complimented me on the recipe! I used a 16 oz pkg of chocolate covered graham crackers which yielded about a 1/2 inch thick crust. I skipped the nuts, because I don't like the idea of crunchy cheesecake.

I have been collecting cheesecake recipes for years. When I saw the combination of chocolate and frangelico I immediaetly decided to make it. My friends and family loved it and have been begging for more. I added a choclate glaze to the top of the cold cheesecake and decorated it with stars of whipped cream. Sensational.

I loved this recipe. The Frangelico adds wonderful flavor! I didn't like the idea of chocolate covered graham crackers for the crust, so I used a chocolate wafer cookie crust, which turned out well.Overall, it was the best cheesecake I've ever tried.

I used about 28 choco-covered grahams; crust turned out nice! Filling has nice 'nutty' and chocolate flavor with good texture. Very pretty with the marbling. Used 8-inch springform pan, and added about 10 minutes to baking time. Gotten requests for the recipe due to upcoming holidays.

Very yummy but a little disappointed with the crust. Can someone clarify what 20 chocolate covered graham cookies weighs maybe? My crust was too thin and did not bind well to the cheesecake. My cookies may have been too small... The cheesecake portion was fantastic though!

Great cheesecake!! My husband said it is the best cake he has ever had. Not overwhelmingly creamy like typical cheesecakes; perfect moist texture. Next time though I will try baking the crust and cool before making the filling and pouring it in. Crust seemed a little soggy.
