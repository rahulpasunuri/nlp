Yet another rave. I have made this recipe since it was first published to raves and requests for me to double, triple, quadruple the recipe so friends and family can have some to take home. At first I made it as the recipe is written, but over the years have made changes and additions. Now I always add an equal amount of apricot preserves and marmalade (usually more than the recipe calls for). I add 1/2 cup of dried cherries (or the dried cranberries with cherry flavor). I also add a fresh chopped apple and pear. The most popular addition is a nice amount of whiskey (e. g., Jim Beam, Jack Daniels), perhaps a third-cup for the recipe as written. It adds a mellowness and smoothness. On occassion I've added a handful of dried apricots I have switched out the liquid and used cranberry-apple concentrate or apple cider. This year I used pomegranate juice. A friend who is addicted to this recipe recommends serving the leftovers with vanilla ice cream or on toast the next day with cream cheese.

I too, have been making this for years and it is the best cranberry sauce ever! I live overseas and frozen concentrate isn't available, so I've been substituting cranberry juice and it still turns out beautifully.

This is a wonderful cranberry dish - people who do not like cranberries ask for this recipe. This recipe became a family tradition in 1993 when it first appeared in Bon Appetit and will always be on our holiday table. I do add a couple of cinnamon sticks and double the sugar. Dried cherries are good in it as well. Great with grilled pork also!

Every Fall I open my 1993 issue of Bon Appetit and make this cranberry sauce. This year I used POM pomegranite juice and apricot preserves as substitutes and added some brown sugar and cinnamon. I love the original but also love playing around. And, if you don't like cranberry sauce then of course you won't like this cranberry sauce. A real keeper.

I have been making this sauce since it was first published. Everyone loves it and it keeps for months. While you can make changes to it, it doesn't need anything altered. I do use the liquid concentrate cranberry juice now (frozen is harder to find as noted by another reviewer).

I've been making this for years - love it. Sometimes add nuts, clementine sections, etc. However, as I was making it tonight, I realized I was out of dried cranberries so I substitued golden raisins. I'll now never use anything but - it was even better.

Will make this again next year. Need to add half a can of whole berry sauce to it because it was a bit tart due to the fact I tried to use sugar free marmalade!

It is NOT Thanksgiving at our house without this sauce. When we travel to eat with friends or family, this recipe has to come along! It's getting harder to find the frozen cran concentrate the past few years though....

This is the best cranberry sauce ever. You can keep the turkey, stuffing and potatoes, I am all about the cranberry sauce and this one is by far my favorite. I added cinnamon sticks and orange sections to it for a colorful presentation. Also, I didn't have enough cranberry juice because I double the recipe so I added a cup of red wine for the liquid. WOW!

This has been a requested staple on our family's table for about 10 years! Always a hit. It freezes beautifully and is a great treat to pull out of the freezer in a few months! This year I used cranberries fresh from the bog in Massachusetts courtesy of my sister-in-law, tripled the recipe and sent folks home with containers of frozen sauce. This is a keeper bar none.

This is delicious and I haven't even served it yet! I made this tonight for Thanksgiving dinner (2 days away) but just had to try it and it's REALLY good. I skipped the allspice and added 2 pieces of crystalized ginger (sugar cube size) minced but otherwise followed the recipe. I'm sure it will be even better in 2 days after the flavors have had a chance to "marry." The color is gorgeous in a crystal bowl too. I will definitely make this again and again.

It is a sad fact that one cannot find fresh or frozen cranberries in my town after Christmas - at least I could find none after searching three large grocery stores (Albertsons, Target, and Kroger). Anyway, I had to resort to using canned whole cranberry sauce in place of the frozen/fresh variety. I cut a bit of the sugar called for in the recipe, added a bit of Grand Marnier, and came up with a winner! It was really good and had a more sohisticated taste than other cranberry sauce dishes I've tasted. Great blend of orange and cranberry flavors. Now, I can't wait to try it next Thanksgiving when I can get fresh cranberries.

Note:The Cranberry Sweet Cherry Marsala Rosemary sauce on this site is even better..by far!!! This was a great recipe--after the addition of 1/2 cup brown sugar. Even then it was still tart. Next time I will add 1/4 cup cranberry juice cocktail (was a bit rubbery as previously noted), and a dash of Grand Marnier as suggested. This is a keeper.

I searched for years for the ultimate cranberry recipe and this is it! It takes 10 minutes max, and there is no comparison to the canned sauce. It's been on my holiday table for several years now, and my friends and family have all loved it. The dried cranberries are optional in my opinion.

Ooh, let's start a debate over whether people should be using canned cranberry, and see how high it climbs up the chart! That way, any useful comments anyone has to make about this recipe will become secondary to people's rantings. I'll start: that canned crap they call cranberry is so vile, that anyone who uses it has no talent in the kitchen, and should quit abusing their children by serving it - Hang up your oven mitts! (OK - someone else respond by saying that people who work full-time . . . yada yada yada!)

I'm from the canned-jelly school of cranberry sauce, so I didnt think I'd like this recipe as much as I did. Not sure about the other reviewers, but when I stirred in the marmalade and orange rind, the whole thing smelled and tasted VERY orangey, not at all like cranberries. I chilled it overnight and served it anyhow for Thanksgiving - surprisingly, there was only a subtle hint of orange in the finished sauce, and it was the perfect balance of sweet and tart cranberry flavor. Much better than canned - I'll be making this sauce every year now!

Actually, I didn't make it this time, my husband did. Wow, is this good! I was sceptical, as I'm a cranberry sauce purist (whole berries, sugar, water), but this has me converted. I've been eating the leftovers by the spoonful out of the bowl, and it was wonderful over waffles for breakfast. Definitely will reappear at this house.

I made this for the first time for Thanksgiving. It was incredible! Used cranberry juice cocktail instead of plain cranberry juice and a little more sugar to taste. My guests couldn't believe how good it was. Will definitely make it for Christmas!

I've made this twice - I followed the recipe the first time and it was too tart and a little rubbery. The second time I doubled the sugar, used cranberry juice cocktail instead of concentrate, doubled the allspice, added 1 T. grand marnier, and topped it with toasted slivered almonds. It was fabulous!

This is an INCREDIBLE recipe!!! Very easy and quick to make and absolutely delicious. It is so good you can eat it by itself with a spoon.

I make this every year and double the recipe so my kids can take some home with them.

I make this dish every year for our company Thanksgiving potluck. People actually remember it and request it the next year! I'm a cranberry fanatic and the canned stuff just doesn't cut it!

This is the absolute best cranberry sauce I've ever had (and I LOVE cranberries--not just at Thanksgiving). Tart and tangy--the orange sets of the cranberry just perfectly. Impress your friends and relatives at next year's dinner with this awesome homemade sauce. I have individual servings frozen to add to roasted chicken or pork. Makes great "Thanksgiving leftover" sandwiches with roasted turkey from the deli and some boxed stuffing. YUM--this will top my turkey every time I make it!

I've been making this since you first printed it, and although I needed to sweeten it a little more, it was still great. This year I substituted dried cherries for the dried cranberries and it is fabulous. I also added a little more allspice, cinnamon and a little brown sugar.

I liked the idea of this recipe, but made substitutions to give it a different flavor. I always get rave reviews. In lieu of straight cranberry concentrate I used a cran/raspberry blend. I used cherry flavored craisins instead of plain. Also switched marmalade for raspberry/blackberry/cherry preserves and last but not least used Chambord instead of orange juice. You could also use framboise or Kirsch. No allspice. It's very delicious this way if you're not into the cranberry/orange thing.

this has been a big hit and a sentimental favorite at our group Thanksgivings for 7 or 8 years now. One of our dear friends who passed away in 1998 found this recipe and made it for the group (we are in our 16th year of celebrating together). It took some doing, but I finally located the recipe after a year of doing without, much to the delight of all our friends. We now all refer to this recipe as "Hal's Cranberries" and remember him lovingly each Thanksgiving for his contributions to this meal and to our lives. We all miss him.

I have made this recipe countless times -- and it has never failed to be a crowd pleaser. Even my husband who typically isn't a cranberry lover enjoys this one! If you want a fast, easy and really "yummy" side dish with turkey, standing rib roast or pork tenderloin -- give it a try.

This is the best cranberry sauce ever! I have made it many times, sometimes substituting dried cherries for the dried cranberries, and it is always unbelievably good.

This was as good as everyone said it would be! Definitely a keeper. I took the advice of the reviewers and added a couple of splashes of Grand Marnier and some minced fresh ginger and that was tasty.

Oh, what guilt I feel. This was so easy to make, yet everyone was impressed and seemed to think I went to a lot of trouble to make it! I'm adding this to my yearly Christmas dinner - it's definitely a "keeper" recipe.

This recipe was delicious! The cranberry sauce was very sweet and flavorful. The orange peel and orange marmalade gave it a nice, tangy flavor. The dried cranberries gave it a little added sweetness.

It is a great recipe and I recommend it to anyone who likes cranberry sauce.

We had not had cranberries in any form in years (18 to be exact) for our Thanksgiving dinners. No one ever seemed to care for them. This year I made this recipe - WOW!!! This sauce was delicious. People in my family who never would have gave a damn about the cranberries before were asking for the recipe - they were soooooo good. We used Wilkins and Sons 'Tawny' Marmalade which has a little extra kick, fresh cranberries, and we took the other suggestion of a small hit of Grand Marnier - could not have been better or so quick to make.
