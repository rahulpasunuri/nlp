This is one of my go-to recipes. It is great with orechiette!

I finished it with a little bit of Oaxaca cheese, just a dash of cinnamon, and cracked salt and pepper - changed up the flavor profile, but I loved it!

I made this with plain old bacon and plain old onion, and it was pretty great as a side to grilled salmon. It did benefit from a squeeze of lemon. But yeah; quick, easy, tasty.

This was the best meal I've had in a while...Somebody said to add add parm. cheese, but it took away from the dish. I would say to add the peas last.

I was surprised, after all the great reviews, but I didn't really like this. Not too much flavor nor depth of flavor. Had to add a lot of salt and pepper, and it just didn't taste like much.

This was a great recipe. I added 1 cup baby spinach leaves to make it a little "greener".

I subtituted Canadian Bacon for the pancetta so that I wouldn't have to run to the store. My husband loved it.

boring. not sure why everyone loved this, it was so blah.

Almost 4 forks, because it's better than a mere "3", particularly for something so very simple and fast to prepare, yet somewhat elegant. I was so impressed with how the flavors came together. I was doubtful about dill but was delighted to find it a different yet perfectly suited and somewhat sophisticated flavor compliment. We made this to bring up to the cottage and it was perfect for a cold lunch - or two! The flavor improves the next day I think.

Very tasty side-dish, served with Oven-Baked Fried Chicken Breasts and complimented it well. Would go well with beef or pork also. Didn't have fresh dill so used dried and used maybe scant 1/2 t. total. My sons, 18 & 21, liked it better than risotto.

I've made this twice - my husband and I love it. It is fresh and delicious.

Detalini is a small pasta usually used in Italian soup. You can find it in most good Italian Deli's. Orzo is easier to find.

Toronto: I'm a pretty experienced cook, but I'm sure I'm not alone in wondering what ditalini is....

I have made variations on this dish for years. It is simple and delicious. Good also made with ditalini. You can dress it up a little as a lunch dish with a drizzle of great olive oil and a few shavings of parmesan or other hard cheese.
