Excellent and easy. The second time around I decided to use Grand Mariner instead of brandy (Colvados brandy would also be great rather than straight brandy). I also drizzled on top, a mixture of coconut cream and white chocolate right before serving... ripe rasberries on the side. LOVE IT!!!

Definitely a simple recipe for an outstanding result. I've made this a few times and they always come out delicious. Instead of brandy I've used Grand Mariner, Whiskey and Port (not all at the same time!!) and the recipe still comes out delicious. Next time I'm going to try with an orange liqueur. YUM!!!

I would only shorten the bake time or lower the temp and keep the bake time. Other than those issues, the recipe is delightful. I only use Belgian chocolate as well.

We enjoyed this recipe but it didn't seem chocolatey enough for us. I used semisweet but would go for bittersweet next time. Also reduced the baking time to 12 minutes per the reviews, but it wasn't long enough.

Delicious and very quick to make. I used Kahlua liquor instead of espresso powder since I had it on hand.

The flavor of this dessert is wonderful. One has to be very, very careful not to overbake; better to err on the side of a little undercooked, since they seem to continue to firm up even after removal from the oven. Take out when tester is full of gooey batter.

This is not very good. It's not sweet enough and not molten at all...too much egg tasted kind of like a chocolate omelette.

Delicious and easy. I lined the bottom with buttered parchment paper, cooked 11 minutes and let sit for about 4 minutes and they came out of the ramekins and were still molten. Used bourbon instead of brandy.

I made mini versions of these using small square ramekins...key is the time...I overcooked these more than once...which resulted in basically very labour intensive brownies....Do not bake more than 5 mins tops for the mini lava cakes...they really don't looked cooked at all...but you will have the lovely lava molten insides...YUM!

Fantastic and super super easy. I actually didn't have enough bittersweet so I just added equal parts unsweetened and semi to make up the difference and it was perfect. I also didn't have Brandy so I substituted a nice tawny port instead. This was the crowds favorite course of the night.

Like many other reviewers on this site I have made this recipe on at least a dozen occasions, with perfect results every time. I don't care for instant espresso powder so I whipped the cream until fairly thick and then added a small shot of brewed espesso to the cream along with a teaspoon of icing sugar.

Delicious and very, very easy to make. I poured the batter into two larger ramekins because that's what I had on hand and baked them for about 14 minutes. They were absolutely perfect and I served it with Sticky Toffee Pudding ice cream from Hagen-Daz. It was out of this world.

Wonderful. I subbed Amaretto for the brandy and served with vanilla bean ice cream. The hot/cold contrast was terrific. My husband said it's one of the best desserts he's ever had and he eats a lot of desserts! I'm not much of a baker but this was simple, even for me. I made the entire recipe, baked two for our romantic dinner and put the other 2 in the fridge. We shared one the next evening and the last one 2 days later and they were still great!

I've made this cake dozens of times and it's fabulous! I make it for company all the time since it's easy to prepare and can be made a day ahead. If you are not going to garnish with the whipped cream then be careful to note the amount of sugar and instant espresso since some of that is for the cream.

These were pretty good but they definitely were not molten. I followed the recipe and baked in porcelain ramekins that I usually use for creme brulee. They were very fudgy and chocolatey and a nice dessert for my Valentine's Day. But definitely not molten which was a bit sad. I guess next time I will just undercook them a bit more.

O M G!!!! This IS a quick and easy recipe. Let me just tell you: I don't even like chocolate and I LOOOOOVEED this recipe. Incredible. Outstanding. Make it. Made it without the espresso powder and didn't miss it. I subbed Grand Marnier - AWESOME. I made it in metal heart-shaped pans and cooked it for only 8 1/2 minutes at 375 and it was perfect. Perfect. I'm a cook, not a baker and this still turned out amazing.

This is a quick and easy recipe. I made this twice and both times the resulting cake was delicious. My cooking time was right on at 15 minutes in ceramic ramekins. I suggest melting the chocolate and butter ahead of time (the butter will keep the chocolate liquid). I did this at 4 p.m. and kept it covered on the countertop for 9 p.m. cooking. The cakes were high, with cracked tops and deliciously most and molten in the center. The recipe suggestion to make the batter ahead of time and refrigerate, then bringing it to room temperature before baking, took longer to bake (23 min) and yielded a cake that was less high and no real molten center, but still very good. I, too, do not like mocha flavors, and left out the coffee without any ill effect on the end product.

These were so good and easy. My guests were impressed. I left out the espresso powder because I don't care for the coffee/chocolate combo. Also, 15 minutes in the oven was too long. Otherwise, great recipe!

The perfect dessert! The trick is to find the right baking time for your oven and type of ramekins. I use metal tins and they come out perfectly after exactly 8 1/2 minutes. Experiment with one ramekin at a time until you find the right baking time for your situation and preference for degree of molten-ness of the center. I suspect the baking time with ceramic is longer than with metal.

This was an amazing cake. I made it for my mom's birthday dinner and if I (a 15 year olf) can make this easily and quickly I'm sure that anyone can then! Of course, I listened to the suggestion of cooking it for less time and 12 was my lucky number. Served with raspberries and blueberries and a scoop of HD Mayan Choco ice cream this is just to DIE FOR!

I made this for desert last night and it was absolutely marvelous. I used Grand Manier and baked it for 11 minutes. My cakes came out of the oven with very soft center but not runny. My boyfriend loves it. It tastes great when served with red wine. I will definitely use this recipe again. Thank you so much.

I wish I'd read the other reviews, I had trouble getting them out of the ramekins and they were slightly overdone - but still yummy. I'll try again with the reduced timing and addition of cocoa powder and whipped cream. I had better success with the molten cakes with the chocolate mint sauce on this site.

These cakes are wonderful. Based upon other cooks' suggestions, I reduced the baking time to 12 mins. and they were perfect. In my first attempt, I used buttered ramikins and had some difficulty unmolding them. Then I invested in a set of six silicone pans from the King Arthur catalog, designed specifically for molten chocolate cakes. The cakes popped right out. After a recent dinner party, I had one cake left over and we ate it chilled--a treat on its own. It was just like a brownie with a dense fudge filling--to die for!! These cakes are so easy and I'll make them again whenever I have the opportunity. Not for the calorie-conscious however.

Huge success - simple and delicious. I added 1T of Bailey's to the egg mixture and then made a Bailey's whipped cream with a pint of whipping cream, 2T powdered sugar, 2T cocoa powder, and 1T Bailey's - it melted over the warm cakes and was delicious!

Awesome. This was one of the easiest & best molten chocolate cakes ever...I used Hershey's special dark chocolate chips & semisweet chocolate(about half & half of each) I baked it as indicated & it came out rick & gooey. I should say, I substituted Frangelico liquor for espresso in both the cake & whipped cream. I also added a little Nutella (2 tbsp.) to the chocolate-butter mix. (Both Nutella & Frangelico have a nice hazelnut flavor which was actually almost impreceptible in this recipe...still great though) I had seen a recipe for a hazelnut molten cake online and combined that one with this. Goooooooood.

Pay no attention to any rating less than 4 forks. I have adapted this recipe to make it "South Beach friendly" and it is still amazing. Substitute Equal or Splenda for the sugar and whole wheat flour for white flour. Reduce baking time to 9 minutes. When I'm in a hurry, I substitute 3 eggs for the eggs/yolks combination. You can't go wrong. Enjoy!

I make this all the time. It's delicious--just watch the cooking time. They're very easy to overcook. Also, make sure you divide the ingredients--the recipe is a little tricky in what to add when (some of the espresso powder and sugar are for the whipped cream, not the cakes). Other than that, these are great and an easy do-ahead dessert.

Rating: 4
This recipe is just fabulous. I didn't have any brandy so I used rum and that worked just fine. The whipped cream with the espresso powder was very tasty. I baked the cakes for just 10 minutes and they came out perfect. This a a great dessert to make for company. You can prepare it the night before and just pop it in the oven. Next time I am going to try the vanilla ice cream instead of the whipped cream for a change.

Rating: 3
I would call myself an advanced baker, but my experience with molten cakes has been limited. I've eaten only one, and that was in Paris, France, (so my expectations were pretty high). I tried this recipe for a party, not realizing they would be as souffle' like as they were. I think oven temperature and the location of the rack in the oven is crucial to get the exact amount of cake to soft center correct. However, the flavor was very good coming from the chocolate snob that I am. I use Belgian or French bittersweet chocolates exclusively in everything I bake.

Rating: 3
This is the second time I have made these cakes. I used Scharffen Berger chocolate and doubled the recipe as we were serving these to our dinner guests. They were sublime. My chocoholic daughter - who loves the chocolate espresso pots de creme on this site - loved this even more. I did reduce the cooking time per the suggestion of others - 9-10 minutes. Excellent!

Rating: 4
I used a higher quality chocolate and had fantastic results. I've used Baker's once and it wasn't quite as good. I buttered and sugared the ramekins and that added a nice crunch. I did bake them for only 12 minutes and that was perfect. These are easy and magnificent!!!!!

Rating: 2
These were nothing special. I did overbake them (should have read the reviews first, 15 minutes was way too long), so maybe that had something to do with it. Also, I wasn't crazy about the flavor. It's a little bitter for my taste, I think I'll only use half the coffee powder and an extra tablespoon of sugar the next time I make these.

If you're looking for the perfect dessert, look no further! This is a fabulously outrageous dessert that will leave your guests exclaiming with delight. Best of all, everything can be done a day ahead of time, making it tremendously convenient. Heed the advice of an earlier cook, who advised paying attention to the baking time. 12 minutes is probably enough, although every oven is different temperature-wise. I served this for dinner on Christmas Eve with Tahitian vanilla creme anglaise and a raspberry sauce, both from "The Cake Bible", but sweetened whipped cream or vanilla ice cream would be terrific, too. Definitely make this chocolatey-rich dessert--easy, convenient, and infinitely elegant!

I used Scharffen Berger bittersweet chocolate and made the recipe exactly as written. I was thoroughly disappointed. My cakes turned out perfectly but I was disappointed in the taste. To me, they tasted like an ordinary brownie. I served it with vanilla ice cream and a mixed berry sauce. I would have thought after reading the reviews and using expensive chocolate as well as Brandy in the recipe it would have been awesome, my guests were disappointed too. I will not be making this recipe again.

Rating: 4
TRY THIS DESSERT!! It's wonderfully simple. I've made it many, many, MANY times. It never fails to please. It's one of my favorites to make and eat! I use plain old pyrex custard cups and double butter them to ensure that the cakes will come out easily. (Brush with melted butter, freeze cups for a minute, brush again with melted butter.) I use instant coffee instead of espresso powder. I like this better with plain whipped cream - I just leave out the coffee powder. I sprinkle a little powdered sugar over the top for fun. PERFECT! Don't worry about testing the cakes with a tester. Just take them out of the oven after 12-15 minutes, and DO let them sit for 5 minutes or so before unmolding. Easy and delicious!!

Rating: 4
This is not bad, but 15 minutes is way too long. My first batch was completely cake after 12 minutes. My second ended up fine after 9 minutes. I suggest just watching the tops carefully until they are solidified but still a bit shimmery. If I wait until the tops are dry, the insides are going to be dry too. This also depends on how large your cakes are; obviously, the larger the cake, the longer the insides will stay molten. I'll compare this with one of the other molten cake recipe http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=104604 That one is *much* easier to get right, since there seems more leeway in terms of the cooking times, and it is much easier since it only requires whisking ingredients. But, it is also more solid so that the outside just takes like a dry, dense cake. This one on the other hand tastes better, it is "fluffier" since the ingredients are beaten and folded. So, weigh your options in terms of taste, likelihood of success, and effort. I topped this with a raspberry sauce (get one small package of frozen raspeberries in sauce, blend in food processor for 5 seconds).

This recipe is fabulous! I was thrilled with the results, I usually pay $8 at restaurants in NYC for this dessert. Quite easy to make and tastes delicious. Be careful not to over bake as the center may not melt, start monitoring after 12 minutes. Also use dark chocolate.

This was a fantastic recipe. I heard somewhere putting a frozen chocolate truffle in the center just before baking makes it really oozing. It worked great. Timed it exactly as per recipe. I used a one cup ramekin instead of 3/4 cup. The smaller ones were just too small.

These were not what I was expecting at all but still delicious. These cakes are so light but still rich in chocolate flavor, I really liked the fact that they were not too sweet. I did not use the coffee and served them with french vanilla bean ice cream. Next time I will try baking for only 12 min per earlier reviews as 15 min seemed to have cooked the center too much.

A croud pleaser every time. Try coating the buttered ramekins with granulated sugar before filling. This adds a slightly crunchy coating to the cakes when they are unmolded.

A chocolate lover's dream! In addition to tasting and looking spectacular, the ability to make it up to a day ahead make it the perfect company dessert. To ease unmolding, I put buttered rounds of parchment in the bottom of the ramekins.

I loved this recipe. I made it for a big family dinner and everyone thought it was amazing. I served it Bryers Vanilla ice cream and some strawberries for color and what a hit. I made it in the morning so I was able to focus on other things besides dessert the rest of the day. I took the advice of one critic and double buttered my ramikin dishes. I did this by melting butter and buttering the dish then I put the dishes in the freezer for a couple of min. Then I buttered them again with the melted butter. I didn't have ANY problem with the cakes sticking. Also I found you have to cook the cakes longer if the batter is cool. I'll definately make them again.

As good as this tasted, it wasn't what I was looking for to satisfy an insistent craving for chocolate--it just wasn't as "chocolately" as I'd expected.

Otherwise, I recommend you look for something else.

I'm a personal chef and use this recipe everytime I cook for special dinner parties. The clients always rave over it and you cna't make cake any easier - even w/a mix! I use high quality semi sweet chocolate bars and since I can't find espresso powder in my area, I grind instant coffee into a powder - this recipe is fabulous!

Rating: 3
This was very tasty served with vanilla ice cream and sliced fresh strawberries. I made 2 modifications: I substituted 1 oz of the semi-sweet chocolate with milk chocolate - I am convinced it gave it a richer taste and used cake flour instead of plain flour. One problem I ran into was that the cakes puffed out quite a bit and then the tops collapsed and crumbled. I couldn't get them out of the moulds I used (non-stick nonetheless) without destroying them. Not exactly presentable but delicious. I guess I'll just have to practice making them.

This was a good, easy dessert that I made for company. People seemed to like it, but I didn't get the raves that I expected. The cakes didn't taste quite as rich as I expected them to. I had a leftover cake that I heated up in the microwave the next day and served with ice cream. This was a nice way to use leftovers.

After several attempts to make my husband's favorite childhood dessert, chocolate steamed pudding....this FINALLY did it!

I made these in a rustic cabin in the woods on a cold, rainy night - a simple, yet elegant, finale to a great day of hiking in the rain. I didn't have espresso powder, and I didn't have all of the right tools (electric beater, souffle cups, etc), but this recipe still turned out amazingly well. I used a jumbo muffin tin which worked out great, and I didn't miss the espresso since the semi-sweet chocolate is already so dark-tasting and rich. I overbaked by about 1-2 minutes so didn't get the molten center - instead it was soft, warm cake which was still terrific - so I agree with others that you need to aim for 11-12 minutes of bake time for the perfect molten center. Overall this is a great recipe - everyone asked for a copy!

I tried this twice -- once with bittersweet chocolate and once with semisweet. I far prefer the semisweet. I may try again with a mixture of bittersweet and semisweet. I prepared in advance, refrigerated, and let come to room temp for 30 min. The cakes were still quite cool, so I thought they might need to bake longer, but they only needed 11 minutes. The cakes are very glossy, though, and kind of have an 'underdone' look. I'm not sure which recipe I prefer -- this recipe or the epicurious Chocolate Pudding Cakes which bake longer at lower temp.

I used a heart-shaped baking pan, which made for excellent presentation. I cooked the cakes for about 13 minutes and while they were fudgy, they weren't as "oozy" as I usually like this dessert. I'd go with the other reviewers at about 11-12 minutes. I paired the cakes with homemade Frangelico ice cream (another recipes from Epicurious). The delicate hazelnut flavor was the perfect compliment to the rich, dense cakes. Next time I'll try adding Frangelico to the batter instead of the brandy.

For those that love chocolate, this one just blows all the others away! This cake is true to its name, Molten Chocolate Cake!

This is a great recipe! 13 minutes was perfect timing. Everyone loved them and wanted the recipe. These would be great for a dinner party. It's always hard to serve a hot desert because the timing of the meal/conversation is difficult. If you have the cakes ready to go you just pop them in the oven. By the time you pour the coffee for everyone they are done! Wonderful!

Rating: 3
Next time I'll definitely bake it for 2-3 minutes less. I did exactly fifteen minutes, and the cakes weren't liquid at all in the center. Still, they were delicious--moist, warm, dense and intensely chocolatey, without being too sweet. One question: how did other reviewers turn over the hot-from-the-oven custard cups? After 5 minutes, they were still too hot to touch, so I served them in the cups with vanilla ice cream spooned on top.

Rating: 4
Simply wonderful, simple to make. I prepared the batter the evening prior and baked the cakes the while we dined. Don't be afraid to remove the cakes too early - my batter was still chilled and 15 minutes was good, 1 or 2 minutes less would have been perfect. I add my vote for ice cream over whipped. Note: I doubled the batter and yielded only 6 full ramekins.

Easy, although some tricks help: Line the pans with rounds of parchment paper so you can flip all six over at a time - I was using popover pans and had to turn the whole hot 6-cup gadget onto a tray all at once. Each cake is ample in size, so next time I will make smaller ones in muffin pans. For Valentine's Day, I will cover plates with red raspberry sauce, then put the cake on with the loveley sauce and decorate with a few berries. Whipped creme fraiche might be more interesting than plain whipped cream. 11 minutes cooking time was perfect for a runny middle. Have fun!

I have made this twice in three days, and though it is easy and delicious, I still haven't seen the "molten" part ooze out of the cakes. If you have teenagers anywhere near, though, they pronouce the cakes out of this world when served with a little french vanilla ice cream.
