I used my favorite chocolate cake recipe for this, but other then that I followed this recipe exactly. I love the chocolate glaze! It sort of hardens when it dries so it's not gooey, but yet its still so creamy and melts in your mouth. It reminds me of chocolate fudge. It was a pain in the butt mess to frost once the whipped cream was added, but in the end it the cake turned out beautifully and everybody LOVED it!

This cake was a huge success and tasted amazing. I will definitely be making it again. It was very moist and not too sweet and all in all a great recipe!

I assembled the cake just as it instructed, and it really looks impressive. The first coating of glaze on the sides looked messy, but after chilling briefly, the final coat smoothed it all out. I made the cake and glaze the night before and left the glaze out, covered, at room temp. Very easy to work with.

The assembly process on this cake is very disappointing. Make sure that your glaze is "chilled" and not just room temperature or cool. In preparing this dessert as written, it became a complete disaster as the glaze and whipped cream oozed out between the layers. I was able to correct by placing cake in freezer to quickly set the glaze. I doubled the glaze recipe from the start, therefore had enough to correct any imperfections. I always refer to epicurious for my baking as I bake desserts for a local restaurant. Usually the desserts that I choose have a 4 fork rating and have always proved to be successful, except for this one.

This is a delicious and beautiful looking cake. Everyone at my party thought it was great. I made one change which was to use all four layers of cake. I cut the cakes in half and then put them in the freezer for a few hours. That made them very easy to handle. I used 2 1/2 cups of cream, 1/3 cup powdered sugar and 14 oz bag of frozen raspberries. I also folded in two teaspoons of gelatin that had been softened in 1/4 cup of water. Next time I will set aside 2 cups plain whipped cream so I can do some decorative piping. I only had 12 oz of semi-sweet chocolate so I did not increase the ganache. I made thinner layers of ganache on the cake but still ran out on the side. Next time I will use a pound of chocolate and adjust the other ingredients accordingly. The four layers looked very impressive and decadent so don't throw out that last layer. One last thing. I expected this cake to be very heavy but with the cream and raspberries it wasn't.

My 15 year old son made this cake for my birthday and did it taste delicious!! He accidently added the "extra" layer thinking it was the cake dome - it was huge! I thought it odd the top was not decorated but it was very impressive in size and don't see why that layer should be discarded. Raspberry cream was yummy but the chocolate glaze had me licking my plate :P

Excellent cake! I made the cake the day before and wrapped it in plastic wrap overnight and it was not dry at all. I also made the glaze the day before and reheated it slowly just before using. The day of, I just had to make the whipped cream filling quickly and assemble the cake, which was easier than I thought it would be. (I split the 2 cakes into layers but next time might try 3 9" pans.) I used fresh raspberries and omitted the eau-de-vie. Everyone liked it and said it was good enough to be sold in a bakery!

This cake is a showstopper. I used a super moist devil's food cake mix due to lack of time. I was concerned that the whipped cream would make it hard to frost the sides with the ganache but I followed recipe and cooling times exactly. My adult son had requested a choc birthday cake with raspberry filling and this was better than I expected. I think it will freeze well. Could serve 16 easily.

The cake is soooo good! I've made it for more than 5 times already (i have this recipe for 6 years and come back to it every time i see good raspberries in the store). I use 1,5 cups sugar instead of 2, add 2 tablespoons of framboise to the batter (after eggs), bake it in 3 9" pans for 25 minutes and with these layers the cake comes out just perfect. I also remove raspberry seeds with a mesh strainer and add 1 tablespoon of framboise to the glaze. Everybody just loves this cake.

My cake wasn't drier than any other non- cake mix recipe. I get 5 gal seedless raspberries every summer so I'm pretty familiar with raspberry recipes. This one's a keeper. Anyone make it in 9x13 pans to take to potlucks or for groups where people will just want a little of several desserts? It was a lot quicker for me than frosting a cake. I measure the dry ingredients & prep the pans the night before, and use a heavy duty mixer which makes it easy to pull together.

I made this cake for a small party and everyone loved it. I doubled the glaze and the filling and used all 4 layers. I still had left over filling, so I served it with the cake. I personally found the cake itself a little dry, but no one else seemed to. its a beautiful cake, I will make it again.

Rating: 4
This was a huge success - even someone who claimed he "doesn't like cake" loved it! Personally, I thought it was a little dry, but that's probably because I used three pans and cut the cooking time to 25 minutes rather than slice up the layers. The raspberry whipped cream with the ganache was delightful. Definitely worth the effort.

Rating: 3
Instead of 2 pans, splitting each layer, and tossing the fourth, I made it in 3 pans and used all the cake. Don't understand not using it all. A touch on the dry side I found, but it looked lovely and everyone said they enjoyed it. Substituted non-fat yogurt for the buttermilk because that was what I had in the house. Definitely a cake to make when you want to impress.

Rating: 4
This makes a spectacular cake. Delicious and impressive looking. I'm a cook hobbyist and realized upon reading the recipe that the glaze needed to be thicker than written. Another 4 - 6 oz. of the semisweet chocolate would help. There's enough glaze to glaze the top, which "finishes" it, IMHO.

I agree that the cake was a bit dry. We didn't have the brandy and omitted that, the berry whipped cream just lacked flavor. I am not sure where I went wrong. I followed the recipe exactly. Just wasn't all that great for us.

I'm not a great baker -- I always seem to mess something up -- but I followed this recipe to the very letter and it came out gorgeous and delicious. Really, it was perfect. I made the glaze two nights ahead, the cake one night ahead and then pulled it all together on the third night. I was surprised that I was able to make such a great cake! An excellent recipe. I made it for my husband's birthday and he loved it!

This recipe turns out perfectly and is a must for the chocolate lover. It will look and taste incredibly professional. Those ending up with a dry cake are not following the recipe correctly. I watched the cake very closely and took it out as soon as the tester came out clean, I used regular buttermilk, not low fat/yoghurt/sourcream, and I wrapped the cakes tightly with plastic wrap after they had completely cooled. Not doing the above may be the reason behind a dry cake. Definately drain the raspberries (frozen work perfectly and they are much more affordable). I also used blackberry brandy instead of raspberry as it was available in a much smaller size. I also used all of the cake and made 3 layers instead of 2. I didn't need to increase the filling but I increased the glaze by 1/2 and it was just enough for each layer and the cake sides. I only used whipped cream for the top. Enjoy!

I've never understood recipes that tell you to make too much cake for the recipe. Rather than throw half a layer out, I put the batter in three pans, and baked them for half the time the recipe called for. I agree with a few of the other reviewers who said the cake was on the dry side, so if I make it again, I'll cut down on the baking time even more. Maybe because I used all the cake, I found there was not enough glaze, or at least not enuf to put on a thin layer, let it harden and then add a final layer. I was really short, so think I would have been even with 3 layers. And I used frozen raspberries left from our summer harvest. I'm sure fresh would be more attractive. And I used plain yogurt, instead of buttermilk. Anyway, I didn't think it was any more complex or time consuming as any other scratch recipe. I served this for a large gathering, but no one fell over themselves over it. I actually like another chocolate cake recipe from this web site better- old fashioned chocolate cake with fudge frosting- much moister and chocolatey.

Rating: 3
WOW! I served this last night for our Christmas Eve dinner and it was a showstopper! The cake was very good, but it could have been a 'little' moister, but not too bad. I found I did not have quite enough glaze, so next I'll make more. I just spread whipped cream over the top and put raspberries on top decoratively. Definitely, use fresh berries. It really was beautiful, and I'm looking forward to more today, since I have almost have left over!

A show off dessert. I dont have 9" cake pans with 2" sides. I used 3 8.5" pans instead and they worked perfectly. (didnt cut the layers in half which I expect makes the recipe easier)We didnt find the cake dry at all. I was proud to serve it.

Rating: 3
I made this to see if it would be suitable for a party we're having in a couple of weeks. It is incredible! It is well worth the time it takes to make from scratch. I had no problem with the cake being dry as another reviewer had mentioned. I made it a four layer cake and increased the amount of whipping cream and berries for the filling. Still had plenty of glaze for the four layers. Scrumptious and I will be making this a lot in the future!

This is a great cake for special occasions, though it is time consuming. I used Nestle semisweet chocolate chips for the chocolate, and used a boxed cake instead of making it from scratch. I found that refrigerating the cake longer than an hour makes it taste even better.

This is a really great cake!!! I made it for my six year old's birthday, and for a more mature gathering. In both instances, I was requested to make it again. I definitely will. I think the outcome was well worth the time spent on it.

This is for sure a show stopping dessert. I made this cake for my son's birthday - he loved it. I recommend fresh raspberries - it's so much nicer. Also the recipe has been forwarded to a local restaurant owner - he is now in love with this site. Absolutely YUMMY!

The combination of chocolate, raspberries and cream is wonderful and the glaze recipe is great, as is the filling. I did, however, find the cake to be quite a bit dry and bitterly disappointing considering the rave reviews.

My friends and I now refer to this recipe as "the cake" and make it for all special occasions. Perfectly fine with cake mix (even so, it's time-consuming); the other ingredients make it moist and delicious.

I made this cake for an office birthday celebration and the results were incredible. I found the cake moist, the presentation beautiful, and a great way to use raspberries before they are completely out of season. The glaze didn't seem to thicken to the right consistency so I put it in the fridge (after the hour on the stove) for a few minutes and that did the trick. I would definitely make this again. Elegant and delicious.

Time intensive but well worth the wait! I made this for a friend's birthday (who is a better baker than I) and she told me it's become her favorite cake. Be careful with the glaze and cream though, they tend to be a little runny if you do not follow the recipe exactly.

This is the all time favorite of my entire family (over 30 people). I don't think the cake is dry at all. If you use fresh raspberries in the whipped cream you will not have the problem of the berries leaking out the side. Also, I use the glaze on the top of the cake then garnish with the whip cream and raspberries.

I have been looking for this recipe since 1996. I made this for my then-boyfriend for his birthday and we both loved it and ate the whole cake within about 24 hours. I couldn't remember the name of the recipe, just that it was so chocolatey and that there was whipped cream and berries. I think I had substituted blueberries so I probably searched for the wrong thing. Now I need to make this for another boyfriends' b-day. I'll make sure to post a more current review!

This cake was delicious and easy to make- after reading the other reviews I decided to make it eash on myself and use a box mix for the cake-- it made the dish easy to make, yet it was delicious and elegant!

This cake was terrific. Instead of not using one of the layers, I used a little less of the chocolate glaze between the other layers so I could put one on top of the third layer and then added the fourth and finished. Next time I will try making more of the raspberry whipped cream mixture to place between the third and fourth layers. The result was an impressive looking and tasting cake that wasn't at all dry as some has said.

This is an Excellent Recipe. Everyone LOVED it. Make sure the raspberries are really dry, however, because otherwise they leak water out the sides. Also, I wouldn't cut the second cake in half, just use a whole cake for the bottom layer.

This is a great recipe - I made it almost 2 years ago for a family function and I still get requests for it! The cake is quite dry, so substitute your favorite recipe. I used the recipe for the Chocolate Cake with Caramel-Coconut-Almond Filling (Bon Appétit November 1995) for the cake portion.

Avergage chocolate cake, with a classic whipped cream filling, except for the addition of raspberries. There are much superior chocolate cake recipes. The glaze was pretty good, but the actual cake was dry and crumbly (maybe because it only had three eggs and to get a really moist cake you need more eggs). Just take your favorite chocolate cake recipe and add the whipped cream filling as another layer.

This cake is great. I've made it four times and received rave reviews. Thank you bobpam1010 from Maine for giving me the courage to make a bigger cake (needed to serve 22 for a baby shower)! I used Cointreau instead of framboise eau-de-vie and it tasted fine. Do use some type of flavoring in the whipping cream because it adds a special flavor.

Rating: 4
Excellent! I made this cake twice with consistent results and rave reviews. I used DeKuyper raspberry liqueur, which tinted the whipped cream a very pale pink. I piped the whipped cream on the top of the cake with a star tip and added fresh raspberries on top. It is a beautiful cake and actually rather light. This will be in my recipe file for quite some time.

I made this for 24 by increasing cake ingredients by 50%, using an 11*17 pan to make 3 layers (one at a time was no problem). I doubled the glaze and cream filling, and had just enough. Glazing the sides was easier using a warm spatula to soften the glaze a bit. Everyone loved it.

The recipe makes this more complicated than need be. Instead of making 2 layers, cutting them and throwing one away, I multiplied the cake measurements by 3/4, and baked 3 layers (rotating them top-bottom or bottom-top rack after 10 minutes). I used 8 1/4" pans, and the cakes were done in about 20 minutes. Since you have to remove the cakes before completely cool, I found that the cheap, disposable pans worked much better than the expensive, non-stick variety! If you don't put the eau de vie in the filling, I'd definitely finish it with some fresh berries. I had trouble finding eau-de-vie... I don't know why you couldn't use Chambord, as long as you don't mind coloring the filling pink. Glazing the sides was a pain... I ended up with lots of extra, which I just spread on the top. The end result was rich, yet surprisingly light. A huge hit!

This cake was wonderful! i tripled the ingredients to make a large birthday cake for my niece. everyone raved! the only thing i found was that frozen berries just don't seem to drain enough,it ran through a little,next time i would use fresh ones. also if you dont want to use liquer,use rasberry juice instead-i did.
