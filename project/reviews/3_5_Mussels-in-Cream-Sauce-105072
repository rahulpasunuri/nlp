This is a fast and delicious preparation for mussels. We doubled it for a family of 4, and my 2 little ones (5 and 3-adventurous eaters, both) ate as much as my husband and I! We finished an entire baguette soaking up as much of the yummy sauce as we could and there was still a TON left. I served remaining sauce tonight over some fettucini with sauteed shrimp. Both meals were big hits, and we will certainly make them again!

Simply divine. Easy elegant and so very continental. Made it for a girls luncheon, Have converted non mussel lovers with this recipe. Will save it as one of my favorites.

i made this for Valentine's Day. I used shallots instead of leeks. I used 4 lbs mussels and there was still lots of juice to sop up with French bread. As good as any I have had anywhere and I am originally from the East Coast>

nothing special. I found it a bit bland. I think I prefer a spicy tomato sauce with mussels than a white cream sauce.

This is delicious! I did revise it to a moules I had in Normandie...instead of the white wine, I used Calvados and shallots--instead of leeks. Moules Normandie is very typical of that area of France served with wonderul frites and a simple butter lettuce with vingarette! That's all you need!
