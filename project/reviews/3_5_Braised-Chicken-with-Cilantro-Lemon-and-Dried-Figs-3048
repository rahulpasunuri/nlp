For those who don't like the figs, try substituting with golden raisins. I actually like it better that way. Also works well using boneless chicken breasts, prepared just as you would the whole chicken pieces. Really liked this recipe; my husband loves it.

I have made this recipe many times. I serve it with roast potatoes and yams. I can prepare the whole meal basically and leave it in the overn on low temperature and serve it when I'm ready (within limits of course). It tastes great and folks always enjoy it.

Truly delicious. The sauce reduction makes this very easy to prepare dish a delight. Served with rice pilaf or couscous it is quick and simple to prepare.

We added 1/2 cup of white wine and used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and 10-12 fresh figs. Wonderful!!

Filled our home with a wonderful aroma. The presentation is as rich as the flavor.

For an excellent lunch option we cut up the chicken and added some mayo, toasted pecans, fresh cilantro, and lemon juice for an amazing chicken salad sandwich. Highly recommend it.

Tripled this recipe for a large crowd of adults and kids- it was delicious. I used skinless thighs, fresh figs and the white wine/broth combo that others suggested. Use really fresh cilantro to get the best flavor and dark figs to enhance the 'look' of the dish. I served it with pilaf and broccoli and everything together made a really great bite!

WOW. My husband requested that this go into regular rotation. Easy, easy, easy and delicious. Be sure to add the salt and pepper to the sauce after it has cooked down...that is KEY to bringing out the flavor of the figs. Also don't leave out the extra sprinkle of fresh uncooked cilantro at the end...that really brightened up the flavor. I used only 8 oz of chicken broth and added 10 oz of sweet white table wine as suggested by previous reviewer...great idea! I used skinless boneless breasts and the cooking time was the same. Did everything in the Dutch oven. I can't believe that someone was actually upset about the graininess of fig seeds...ummm..haven' t you ever had Fig Newtons??

I made this recipe as directed, and it just wasn't very good. I really wanted it to be, though-I was wild about the notion of using figs in this recipe iwth chicken. However, the result was far too contrasting. The lemon was too much in comparison with the very sweet figs. I'm sorry but this combination was almost gag-worthy. I couldn't finish my serving. It must be a matter of the tastebuds. It smelled wonderful while it was cooking, though!

This was dead easy to make and the chicken was excellent. I even had to let it sit in the pot for an extra 15 minutes since we weren't ready for dinner when it was done. I used mission figs and meyer lemons but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. This was a complex sauce for such an easy recipe and it was tasty but seemed to be lacking something. Maybe next time I will try 50/50 mix of white wine and chicken broth. I will for sure make this again trying other fruit combinations.

Really delicious. I substituted Turkish apricots for the figs and it was terrific. My husband loves this dish.

This is one of my favorite gourmet recipes to serve to guests. I've served it many times over several years. It can be made easily before they arrive. I serve over couscous. Serve with a gree salad. It's Middle-Eastern tastes support Moroccan appetizers, salads and a light dessert.

Mainly want to add that I agree w/previous reviewer re the FIGS...seeds tend to be "gritty" and it felt like eating dirt!! I used thighs, left skin on (mistake) and red wine. Everything was a bit too mushy and all in all, not a winner for us.

4 forks, especially given my ability! L.A. suggestion was good.. I used white cooking wine and chicken broth, too. My boys (14 and 17) both loved it. The younger is pretty picky. The older son wants me to open a restaurant now (and go broke, I suppose!)

So easy and so delicious. I braise it in 70% white wine (Charles Shaw Sauv. Blanc) and 30% chicken broth; it adds to the fruitiness. This chicken is so good and easy, I can't stop making it.

This dish was very delicious, a big hit with my family (especially my 13 month old son!). It was pretty easy to make so I will definitely make this again and again.

This has become one of my favorite mid-week dinners. I use chicken breasts only, and they turn out so tender and flavorful. The dried figs taste delicious and juicy after all that simmering.

I made this last night for Hanukkah dinner and it was very good. This is one of those recipes that doesn't look like it will be anything special, but the contrasting tastes and textures are delicious, ie. the tartness of the lemon and the sweetness of the figs. I used just drumsticks and thighs.

Delicious. Something different instead of the same old boring chicken.

Really good comforting chicken dish... Added more lemon juice and a handful of raisins to the regular recipe and simmered in a claypot. The flavours blended together nicely and the leftovers were just as good as the first night. Mine was not dry, or too sweet

I didn't have the figs, but cooked the recipe anyways. Added an extra tablespoon of lemon juice. Turned out really good. The whole house liked it.

NOT WORTH THE TIME. FLAVORS WERE NOT TO MY LIKING.

This was repulsive. The sauce had a weird, cloying flavor because of the figs and a gritty texture because of the fig seeds--it felt like I was eating dirt. The chicken came out a little tough, too. I would never make this again.

What a great dish! I doubled the sauce and had more than enough--it also keeps the chicken looking attractive enough for company. Am serving it this weekend for guests. Yum!

Tried this recipe for the first time today. What a keeper! I took the advice to double the amount of sauce and was glad I did. The entire dish was scrumptious.

Very very good and not hard to make. I agree with the person who said to double the amount of sauce as the original recipe doesn't provide enough of it.

I need to try this again, but the first time I made it, it tasted great (and the chicken was so moist) but looked unappealingly uncolorful, especially after being simmered. Um, for you novices out there, don't forget to pat dry the chicken pieces before you flour them ;) BTW, I didn't have Calimyrna figs, but was handed a box of golden raisins instead. Next time, I will slice instead of chop the onion, try Mission figs (for color contrast), and double the chicken broth because there was so little liquid -- not enough to cook the chicken completely.

This is a wonderful dish, perfect for dinner parties. We used just chicken breasts -- skinned, with bone. Also, to infuse a richer flavor, I added a couple of extra figs. There are three tricks to making this a truly four-star dish: first, use home-made chicken stock; second, be sure to reduce the sauce to a thick, almost syrupy consistency at the end -- don't rush it; and third, as others have noted, add the squeeze of fresh lemon at the end. Excellent.

This recipe is delicious and very easy to make. I have made it 5 times since discovering it 4 months ago. I always make double the amount as leftovers taste even better. I always add extra cilantro and serve it with basmati rice and steamed green beans. Don't forget to serve with lemon wedges - that squeeze of lemon makes a big difference.

This is a delicious meal. I was a little curious about the figs. I cooked this dish over low heat and the chicken was both tender and juicy. Served with basmati rice, I'd definitely make it again!

Easy to prepare. But cook slower, longer. Leftovers just as great.
