This was a delicious salad with the mix of potatoes. I think 35 minutes is too long on the grill; in addition, I made the mistake of letting my foil cool before unwrapping the potatoes, so mine were a bit too soft. But still great for a warm weather supper. I used 1/4 C. light olive oil mayo and 1/4 C. plain yogurt to lighten it up. Everyone loved it!

I was really dissappointed in this potato salad. Apparently so was everyone else at the BBQ where I took it as hardly anyone ate it. It tastes very much like a German potato salad. If you like that type - I suppose it's ok. One change I would recommend is to grill the sweet potatoes less than 35 minutes as mine got a bit too mushy. I would go with 25 minutes.

What a hit - we had a pre-4th BBQ party yesterday. In my hast to prepare everything I did not follow the directions and cut all the potatoes up into 1" pieces and put them in the foil packets. We did not reduce the grilling time and of course they burned. I decided to prepare the salad anyway and see if it was any good. People RAVED about the salad. I can't wait to make it again and NOT burn the potatoes.

I made this with barbequed ribs and it was delicious. I will make it again. It is very flavorful and everyone liked it as much as I did. Thanks for the recipe, Epicurious.

This was an amazing salad! I have made it 3 times in two weeks. The lemon is the key along with less mayo than many traditional potato salads. This is really a fresh and different salad; you can be proud to bring it along to all your that summer BBQ's! I used red potatoes because purples can be hard to find this time of year. DO NOT OMIT the sweet potatoes either - they add so much interest!

I made a lightened version of the recipe, using 1/4 c. lemon juice, 2 T. Dijon, and 3 T. olive oil. Plus, I roasted the potatoes in the oven rather than grilling them. It was absolutely fantastic. I served it slightly warm as a side dish with grilled salmon and asparagus. Guests raved about the meal and the salad in particular.

We boiled the Yukon and red potatoes, and grilled the yams in the oven and this worked just as well.

The celery seeds make this dish. Very simple to do- even on a campfire. Yummy!

I make this using any and all varities of potatoes, and use fresh chives from my garden instead of green onions. I also prepare and serve while potatoes are still warm - it is great.

I actually misread the recipe and used red skinned potatoes instead of yams, and it turned out great. A nice change, with good flavor combinations.

It was so flavorful and refreshing as compared to traditional potato salad. A welcomed surprise to my bbq buffet!
