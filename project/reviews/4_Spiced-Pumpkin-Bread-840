This is a phenomenal pumpkin bread recipe. I love how spicy and delicious it is. I also love that it makes two loaves. I follow the recipe exactly and have had great success with it. Highly recommend.

This is an excellent recipe that I have saved to my "recipe box." I've been making it for years and have made the following changes (thanks to others' suggestions! I've reduced the sugar to 2 cups, doubled the spices, use 1/2 c, of oil and an additional 1/2 c of pumpkin and I add 2 Tblsp. of molasses. This makes great bread, but I usually make muffins. yum!

Very tasty. 1 cup of chocolate chips added at the end made it even more delicious, in my opinion. I also used just 2 1/2 c sugar, and instead of 1 t cloves I did 1/2 t cloves and 1/2 t ginger powder.

Like others, I modified this recipe by reducing the sugar to 2.5 cups, which was still plenty. I used 1 cup of brown sugar. Also, I substituted 1 stick of butter for half the oil (as I saw on a Bobby Flay recipe). With modifications I loved the recipe. I think 3c of sugar would be a bit too sweet. It only took 50 minutes to bake, so check early!

I gave this recipe a solid 4/4 forks, because I think it's even better than Starbucks' pumpkin bread. I did not deviate from the recipe. I think this recipe is better than Starbucks, because the flavor is comparable, but this bread lacks the greasy finish that Starbucks' pumpkin bread has.

The cook from Manchester, NH who gave this recipe a bad review, calling it wasteful, misread the recipe. The recipe clearly calls for two loaf pans and refers more than once to the two pans. She thought it called for only one pan. Please disregard her review. I have made this recipe every Thanksgiving for several years. It is loved by all.

This pumpkin bread was so moist and delicious! I loved the chewy, caramelized edges.I decreased the sugar to 2 and 1/4 cups and it was perfectly sweet. I also halved the cloves because i thought it would overwhelm the pumpkin, and added a little extra cinnamon and nutmeg. Also check the bread at 45 mins! Mine was done at 50.

Excellent Bread. I reduced the sugar to 2 1/2 cups using 1 cup brown and 1 1/2 cups white sugar and added 2 tbsps of maple syrup. I also adjusted the spices to my taste (spice cake spices) and added 1 tsp vanilla. Very moist with good pumpkin flavor. Will definately use this recipe from now on.

I have been making this recipe for years, but now I can no longer eat gluten. I have made this twice using gluten-free flours and it has turned out great both times. What a forgiving recipe! Also this time I cut the sugar from the 2 cups I used to use, to a total of 1.5 cups (3/4 cup brown and 3/4 cup white). I also added fresh chopped cranberries to the pumpkin puree for a total of 16 ounces. I doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg and added 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger. Also used 1/2 cup of olive oil and 1/2 cup of apple sauce. In case anyone else would like to try to make it gluten-free I used a total of 420 grams of different GF flours (140 grams for every cup of regular flour). First I make a batch of GF flour based on the video from the Glutenfreegirl.com website. 1000 grams total: 300 grams potato starch, 300 grams sweet rice flour, 150 grams millet flour, 150 grams teff flour, 50 grams almond flour and 50 grams superfine brown rice flour. (Last time I used 200 grams millet flour and 200 grams sorghum flour along with the potato starch and sweet rice flour). Then I measured out 420 grams of the combined (and shaken) flour mixture, to replace the 3 cups all purpose flour the recipe calls for. You cannot tell this is Gluten Free! Plus you have some GF flour left over to experiment with. Good luck!

I did not like this recipe. It should have called for two baking loaf pans, not one. It was too doughy. I usually bake great baked goods, but this was not one of them. The editors might want to review the ingredients, and directions again. Throwing away product is expensive and wasteful today. Next time I will stick to BETTY CROCKER.

This has been my go-to pumpkin bread recipe for many years. It's become a standard for holiday gift giving because it's so delicious and reliable. Everyone raves about how delicious it is. Based on all the recent reviews recommending cutting back the sugar to 2 cups I tried that this last round. It changes the character of the bread too much for me; I will stick to the 3 cups of sugar as written. I do double all the spices and add ground ginger as well.

i needed to do something with my halloween pumpkins so i roasted the meat and pureed it and used fresh pumpkin puree in place of the canned. it came out really tasty and moist. i also cut the sugar almost in half and still found it to be plenty sweet

I'm not sure what people were raving about--this has zero pumpkin flavor and huge amounts of cloves. I made it as written except for reducing the amount of cloves by 60%, because a full teaspoon of cloves in anything is just silly. Pumpkin bread is my family's favorite, but I'll stick with recipes that actually taste like pumpkin.

Loved that this recipe was so easy. I too, only added 2 cups of sugar, it was plenty sweet. I also added one cup of whole wheat flour for one of the cups of flour, turned out delicious and moist.

First of all, every baker should have a thermometer in their oven so they are 100% sure of their oven temp. Makes ALL the difference in your baking. Next, do not use 3 cups of sugar in this recipe. I like sweets and 2 1/4 cups of sugar were plenty. Plus I used one cup of applesauce in place of the oil, it worked perfectly, you would never know! I also made muffins. Baked 350 for 21-22 min came out perfect. I do not think I would have used 3 cups of sugar even if I had used oil instead of applesauce, which probably added to the sweetness. Made 26 muffins.

The amount of sugar called for is definitely way too much. Even reducing it to 2 1/2 c. made it sweeter than carrot cake. The bread is delicious. Love the walnuts in it.

This is the best recipe. I know thanksgiving is over but I really love this bread and it takes no time to make. The only change I make is I use 2 cups of sugar and I still think it is really sweet. If I have sour cream in the house I also use that to make it moist but this is pretty moist without it.

This pumpkin bread was delicious. Very moist and kept well wrapped in saran and then foil. I actually gave two away as gifts already. If it gets a little stale later on after the holiday, I'm sure it can be toasted and eaten warm with a schmere of butter or jam. It was delicious; can't wait to make it again. You must include the walnuts; they make it even better.

what can one add to 945 reviews, LOL? anyway, I used melted butter instead of the oil and I think it improves the texture. i agree 3cups sugar would be too sweet - i used 2, and it wan't quite enough. i also used 1 tsp salt not 1/2. made half as muffins and one loaf - the crunchy edges on top of the muffins were perfect :)

I have made this bread a dozen times, exactly as written. The rich sweetness of the batter caramelizes into a chewy crust (on all sides when baked in Pyrex loaf pans). The crust is what sets this recipe apart from other fine pumpkin bread recipes. Don't mess with it!

Perfection! I made these into muffins for a bakesale and they were one of the first items to sell out. (The recipe made 24 muffins, which I baked in liners for 29 minutes. They came out perfectly moist.) As per the suggestions of other reviewers, I made a few changes: I decreased the sugar to 2.5 cups (1.5 cups white, 1 cup light brown), decreased cloves to 0.5 tsp, increased cinnamon to 1.5 tsp, and added 1 tsp vanilla. Also, I used a 15-oz can of pumpkin and decreased the flour to a scant 3 cups to balance it out. I found the amount of sugar to be perfect - sweet, but not cloyingly so. A huge success!

This has to be the best Pumpkin Bread ever. Moist, tasty and easy to make. Tastes great with a spread of low-fat cream cheese. Will be making it for our Thanksgiving gathering.

Rating: 4
the 4 forks assume that you reduce the sugar to 2 cups as others suggested, that you increase the spices per personal taste and that you let the bread sit wrapped at room temperature for one day to let the flavors develop. I did added sweetened dried cranberries and I swapped out half the oil for unsweetened applesauce plus 1/4 cup water, but that was a personal choice. The bread is moist, very flavorful (but you can still taste the pumpkin) and, would make a great treat for a potluck or brunch. This will be my go-to recipe.

Rating: 4
Very easy, tasty and forgiving recipe. For those of you trying to make it a bit healthier (we were so we'd feel better about sharing it with the toddler), there are many adjustments that can be made. We cut the sugar to 1 cup mix of white and brown sugar, and it was still plenty sweet, even for an admitted sweet tooth like me. Greek yogurt can be substituted for part of the oil (we did half) and spelt substituted nicely for half of the flour. Whole wheat would likely do just fine, too, as others have mentioned. Very flavorful, soft, and all around yummy. Plus, your home will smell heavenly of fall!

By far the best pumpkin bread ever! Cut sugar to 2 1/2 cups, half white and half brown sugar. Only used half the cloves since im not a huge fan, and more than doubled the cinnamon. Put in loaf pan and topped with walnuts. Baked five minutes less than called for. Perfect!

I only gave this 3 forks because as written it has WAAAAY too much sugar. I used 1.75c white and. 25c dark brown sugar. I also added 1/2t ginger and reduced the nutmeg, cause a little nutmeg goes a long way. The recipe works great with whole wheat flour and olive oil if you want to make it a lot healthier.

great recipe and you can make your own adjustments. I cut back the sugar to only 2 cups; 1 white around 1 brown. I also cut back on the oil, added a half of cup, and a to go applesauce cup. I also added some cardamon, pecans, and dried cherries! Very tasty, not overly sweet and super moist from the applesauce. everyone just loved it, the best pumpkin bread!

This was a delicious recipe. I don't like pumpkin anything but made this for my husband and I ended up loving it. I made a couple of changes. I halved the recipe (to try first). Took other people's suggestions and did 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. I think the brown sugar added to this recipe. Then I added about 1 tablespoon of melted butter over the top and sprinkled more brown sugar then baked it. It was delicious!

I took everyone's advice, and used slightly less than 2 cups of sugar. I didn't have brown on hand so I just used white. Added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice. I like a fine crumb, so I replaced 1 cup of flour with cake flour, and I increased baking powder to 1 tsp. Finally!! The pumpkin bread of my dreams!

Wonderful flavors. I agree with the others and only used 1 1/2 c. regular sugar and then 1/2 c brown sugar for that extra depth of flavor. I have a brand new oven and baked the loaves for 50 min and I will most likely adjust next time for only 40-45. Don't want the edges looking all cajun.

Super yummy. I didn't have cloves but it turned out just fine. I only baked my two loaves for around 50 minutes though! An hour and ten would have DEFS been over kill. It was so good I think I'm making another batch today to serve as desert for a party tonight :)

I love this recipe for many reasons: I love pumpkin anything, it got me interested/started in baking, and it is so easy to very to individual tastes. I felt like a successfull My own preference (probably my indigenous Southern sweet tooth) is to use brown sugar, cloves/cinammon, pecans, and Appleton rum instead of the choc chips. Another fave combo: pecans and choco chips and figs.

This was bullet proof... was out of control for a brunch I was supposed to put on for girlfriends. Slapped it together the night before at 9 pm (and I am talking seriously sloppy measuring). Too tired to chop nuts so I put in a cup of currants. Lay in bed and waited for the timer to go off and it came out great! I would probably bake it 5 minutes less as I prefer a really moist bread but it could have been the currants. EASY!

This is a great basic recipe. Add two smashed overripe bananas and less than a cup of semi sweet chocolate chips. Done. If you want more, mix a couple of tablespoons of pure maple syrup with a cup of confectioners sugar to glaze.

So obviously with 900+ reviews, one knows this is a good recipe. But I still had to write a review since I made a horrible mistake and it STILL came out great. I added 1/2 c extra flour by mistake and decreased the sugar by 1/3c. I've made this recipe several time (just as written) and it is fantastic. But even with the mistakes, everyone loved it (Yes, I still served it to friends. They even wanted to take the extra home!) I actually like it better with less sugar, but the added flour made it a little too dense for my taste. I'll go back to how it's written and try to pay better attention to what I'm doing next time.

I have been on a mission to perfect pumpkin bread this week even though it is January. I think this is wonderful year round. I decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups with an added 1/2 cup of brown sugar which I think gave it more depth. I also added a 1/2 tsp. ginger and 1 tsp. of vanilla. Yummy!!!

DELISH! Made this for preschool snack, and baked it in two 8x8 square pans for ease of portioning. Cooked for 35-40 minutes, worked wonderfully. Made some substitutions others had mentioned: buttermilk for half the oil, reduce the sugar and do half brown sugar, also substituted wheat flour for some of the white. I imagine the original would be great, just sweeter. Loved it so much, I may need to make another loaf or two to keep for myself.

Forgot to mention in the review (see below): I agree with the other reviewers. The recipe calls for too much sugar. I cut it down to 2 cups and I think I probably will try 1 1/2 cups next time.

Delicious. I made the following changes: substituted spelt flour for white (more healthful), substituted melted butter for oil- used 3/4 stick per loaf (more flavorful than oil), upped the amount of cinnamon and nutmeg a bit, and upped the baking soda (1 1/2 tsp.) and baking powder (3/4 tsp.) to compensate for the added heaviness of the spelt flour. Was a huge success.

Tasty and straightforward recipe. I doubled the filling and it was way too much. Probably fine as written - max would be 1-1/2 times. One thing I would definitely change is to cut the rum in the filling in half or out all together. Overpowering and not necessary.

Rating: 4
It's such a fast and easy recipe. We all love it, but the sugar and fat content are high. I tried a few modifications that made it a little healthier and every bit as good. I cut the sugar to just over 2 cups, replaced 1/2 the oil with buttermilk, and replaced 3/4 C. flour with ground flax seeds. I don't put in the nuts and add extra helpings of spices. It's a very forgiving and flexible recipe.

Good recipe, though I did adjust it by taking other reviewer's suggestions of dropping the sugar to 2 cups. I also hate the flavor and texture of oil in most baked goods, so I substituted creamed butter. Also, I used 2 full 15 oz. cans of pumpkin puree and threw in a scant cup each of chopped nuts, chocolate chips, and fresh cranberries. The loaves turned out beautifully with gorgeous crispy, craggy tops. The cranberries were an especially good addition. They gave the breads lovely pops of pink which looked and tasted great.

Good as is, but I think that a few changes next time will make it even better. The crumb is very moist. The crust is a bit harder than what I prefer. I agree with the other reviewers who say that you can cut 1/2-1 cup of the sugar out (and that is extremely strange for me, as I am a hard-core sweet tooth). I imagine that would soften the crust up a bit, as well. Aside from cutting the sugar I will use half white and half light brown sugar next time. I like the last reviewer's suggestion of adding ginger, allspice and mace, as well. I will be doing that and adding more cinnamon. Like I said, it's good as is, but more spice would make it just right.

Great recipe that I've been using for years! I do think it is way too sweet, though (I guess it depends on your preference). Like others, I use 3/4- 1 c. white & brown sugar each (1.5 - 2 c total); sometimes add choc chips (with lower sugar); and always throw in a bit of ginger, allspice, and mace. Also just as good with 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 regular flour. Turns out perfect every time.

DELICIOUS pumpkin bread. Only made a few changes. 3 cups of sugar seemed excessive, so like other reviewers I used only 2 cups (1 white, 1 light brown). For vegetable oil I used coconut oil, which is extremely healthy compared to other oils. Also, I see a lot of reviewers cut the oil in 1/2 in favor of applesauce - which if you are trying to make this bread more healthy I would advise, as a nutritionist, to just use the full cup of oil. It sounds counterintuitive, but sugar (in this case applesauce) turns to fat in the body, not fat (the oil). Also I used gluten-free flour so I needed to add xanthan gum, which I used 1 1/2 teaspoons. Also, instead of walnuts, I topped my bread w/ raw pumpkin seeds that I candied.

Rating: 4
Oops, one more thing -- like the previous reviewer mentioned, the bread was finished well before 1 hour and 10 minutes. I think it came out finished around the 45-50 minute mark. I would start checking at 40 minutes depending on the size of your pans.

Wow, this is my new favorite pumpkin bread recipe. I used 1/2 as much cloves and added 1/2 tsp ground ginger. Otherwise, followed directions (oh, except that I baked on conv bake at 325 for 1 hr).

Fantastic recipe. Dense, moist, and delicious. I'm always a little loathe to post a review when I've made any or too many changes in the recipe at hand, but I'm going for it anyway this time. Changes: I reduced the sugar by half a cup, and used 2 cups granulated - 1/2 cup brown sugar (it was plenty sweet). In place of 1/2 the oil, I used 1/2 cup butter. I also replaced the canned solid pack pumpkin with roasted pumpkin left over from halloween. (Sliced pumpkin into 2 inch wedges, coated in oil and 1T brown sugar, and roasted in 400 degree oven for forty-five minutes, pureed and replaced 16-ounces canned with 16-ounces fresh pureed). This bread had a really great balance of spices, without being overpowering at all. Good stuff, definite repeat.

I made this recipe with margarine instead of oil, and with a 15 oz can of pumpkin and 1/4 cup of yogurt. Baked as directed with chopped pecans pressed onto the top of the loaves, and it came out well...however, I thought it needed something more, so I made an icing for the top of margarine, powdered sugar and apple cider vinegar. That is what pulled it all together and gave it more of a desserty presentation and taste. Icing necesary, but not too sweet.

Fabulous recipe, although I did modify it a bit. To cut down on fat/sugar I substituted 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce for the oil and used 1 cup brown and 1 cup white sugar-- definitely sweet enough-probably because of the applesauce. The bread was insanely good.

I agree with changing out 1 cup of white sugar for brown sugar. I made my gluten free with my typical all purpose mix (sorghum, teff, corn starch, corn flour) and 3 tsp of xanthum gum. I used fresh pumpkin (I weight out 16oz) and left the spices as is. I do think this is a great basic recipe you can mold into whatever you want. I also love that it is dairy free.

I made it with the full amount of sugar, because I like yummy sweet pumpkin goodies. It is not too sweet, rather it's just sweet enough. I don't recommend cutting down the sugar unless you are particularly sensitive to sweet things. I skipped the cloves, subbing in pumpkin pie spice for the other herbs. Moist and yummy, and does get better the next day!

It turned out great and is a little healthier than written. I also used 2 cups of fresh roasted pumpkin instead of canned.

Great bread. Instead of 3 cups of sugar, I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar (i will reduce the sugar even farther next time). I used half whole wheat and half ap flour. I also substituted 1 cup of vegetable oil for 1/3 cup of olive oil, 1/3 cup of plain non-fat yogurt and 1/3 cup of apple cider. I added 5 tsp of pumpkin pie seasoning and 1/4 tsp ground ginger. I then topped the bread with a mixture of 1/2 cup rolled oats, 2 TBSP of brown sugar and 2 TBSP olive oil. Baked for 1 hr. Then I let cool completely and topped them with a apple cider glaze (powder sugar mixed with just enough apple cider to create a glaze). Next time I will also add 1/2 cup more pumpkin.

i used butter instead of oil and made a number of other changes, so while the spirit of the original recipe is there, it's certainly not the same. i whipped the eggs, a pint of fresh pumpkin and 1 small container of plain yogurt in a medium bowl. then in my kitchenaid, i combined 2 cups whole wheat pasty flour, 1 cup whole grain flour (contains 9 different grains, some ground, some not), 2 cups sugar, half a cup of brown sugar, the salt, powder & soda, and 2 tablespoons of pumpkin pie spice. once that was mixed, i added 2 sticks of cold butter, cut into 1-tablespoon chunks. let that mix on low for 4 minutes, made a well in it, then added the pumpkin mix and an overflowing cup of pecan halves. used half the batter for a bread, then folded in about half a bag of whole cranberries to make a dozen muffins. these are seriously amazing!

Over all a good base for a pumpkin bread. I did as others suggested and reduced the sugar by 1 cup. I use 1 cup white and 1 cup light brown. Perfectly sweet. I also substituted a lot of the oil for non-fat vanilla yogurt. I only had a 15 oz. can of pumpkin. So, 15 oz. pumpkin, 6 oz. vanilla yogurt and 3 oz. oil. I then substituted half the white flour for whole wheat pastry flour. Then I used fresh ground cinnamon and nutmeg. I sprinkled the tops with cinnamon and Turbinado sugar. It turned out very well. Light and moist. I'll make it again, exactly as I just did. http://itssewyou8.etsy.com

I really enjoyed this. I used fresh pumpkin and substituted the oil for a stick of butter and added 1/2 a cup of plain greek yogurt. I also reduced the sugar to 2 cups based on all the reviews.

This is a great recipe, I only shorted the sugar by half a cup and it was sweet enough for me. I also subsituted 1/2 cup white sugar to brown. So it was 2 cups white and 1/2 cup brown. I also changed the spices a bit. i used cinnimon, ginger, nutmeg, and allspice. It was perfect!

This is an easy to make, wonderful bread. I actually increased the cinnamon and nutmeg to make it taste more like pumpkin pie. No question of freezing one loaf for later - it was GONE over the course of two days! Great with coffee in the morning or warmed a little in the microwave and served with a dollop of french vanilla ice cream or even just a slice on it's own. A keeper for this family!!

Found the cloves to be very overwhelming (my husband said it tasted like church!)- would recommend reducing to 1/2 tsp, perhaps to be substituted with 1/2 tsp of ginger and a dash of vanilla. Also, as with many raters, found the bread to be too sweet - If I make this again I will knock off a half cup of sugar and may experiment with a mix of brown and white. I may also up the pumpkin content by a half cup to add additional depth and moisture.

this one is ALWAYS a hit! I always have a few cans of pumpkin on hand to make this in a pinch to bring on playdates, or when visiting. I add a dash of ginger as well for an extra zing.

I LOVED this recipe! I did change a couple of things: 2 eggs instead of 3 and 2 cups of sugar instead of 3. I baked them for exactly 1 hour and they came out perfectly. It was definitely best the next day after all the flavors melded together, so I would make it a day before you want it. It made my house smell so yummy! Delicious with coffee!

Totally lovin' this recipe! Super easy and fabulous results also. I just made 4 loaves yesterday and they are all gone. Ok, two were for neighbors, but still... :). I made this bread over Thanksgiving and used it for pumpkin bread pudding. Fabulous. Great spices and lovely texture. Make it, you'll like it. Oh, and I don't do nuts.

I substituted brown sugar for 1 of the cups of sugar and used 1/2 cup of applesauce for 1/2 of a cup of the oil in order to give it more taste and keep moist. Even still, this looked perfect but did not have much taste soon after baking. I hope it improves the next day as some reviewers mention. If I make it again, I would add more of each spice and maybe make some type of glaze. Otherwise, nothing that special.

I use a 29oz can of pumpkin and make 6 mini loaves. I also omit the walnuts~ Pre-heat to 350, but when you put them in the oven drop the temp to 325 and bake 1 hr. They come out perfectly delish every time!! I give them as gifts and every year people always ask, 'Where's my loaf?!' This year I am going to make a butter cream frosting and sprinkle chopped walnuts on top~

Rating: 3
I've been making this for years, it's so good! I reduce the sugar to 2C and add an extra egg. It comes out a little firmer that way, so if you slice it it doesn't crumble in to pieces. and I've never tried the recipe as-is, all the other reviews said to use less sugar so that's the way I've always done it. -oh and this last time I had everything I needed except the oil, so I used butter instead. Unhealthy, but so delicious!

After skimming the 800+ reviews, to see what the most consistent recommendations were... I reduced the sugar to 1 cup brown and 1 cup white sugar. Doubled the spices and added ground ginger. Also added 1 1/2 cans of pumpkin (22 oz). I thought the level of sweetness was appropriate, but found that the spices overwhelmed the flavor of the pumpkin. It could have been zucchini, carrot, or any other one of a number of fruits/vegetables in the bread. I prefer to taste the pumpkin. Not sure whether I'll make this again (with the recommended spices) or keep looking for another recipe. It was moist. Easy. But I've had better elsewhere. Agree with another reviewer that mentioned having fork ratings for the recipe as written and fork ratings for the recipe with modifications. Feel that 4 forks for a recipe that most reviewers changed substantially is rather misleading.

Rating: 3
halved the recipe to only make 1 loaf. even with only 1 1/4 cups sugar, way too sweet, but I prefer my desserts where I can taste the flavor rather than just sugar. I like strong flavors, so next time I'd add more of all the spices, and I also added ground ginger. I substituted white flour with whole wheat and spelt flour and it turned out great. Added flax seeds for texture and health benefits.

Rating: 3
2 cups of sugar is not enough! I took reviewers tips and used less sugar, 2 cups. Both my 13 year old son and I felt it was not sweet enough. To fix that we made icing of powder sugar, milk and maple syrup extract. YUM! Next time I'll add 2 1/2 cups sugar as it was worth making again.

I was looking for a simple pumpkin bread recipe and found this one with very high ratings. I completely understand why. Even though it's simple, it's very good and moist. But wait! There's more! The recipe makes two loaves! I read many comments and the only change I made was to reduce the sugar to 2 cups and that was plenty sweet. Will absolutely do again. And again. And again.

Way too sweet as written. I wish I had read many of the reviewers' comments about reducing the sugar before I made it. Will probably give these loaves away to people who like lots of sugar and try again with maybe half the sugar the recipe calls for. Also, was hoping for something with more of a pumpkin taste.

I am not quite sure how this will turn out as my bread isn't even fullly cooked yet, but according to the rest of the comments I think it will turn out just fine.

I was disappointed because this turned out dry. I think it was overcooked. I also omitted one cup sugar and 1/2 the oil for applesauce. The flavor was good though. I think I'll try it again and maybe decrease the flour amount slightly and shorten the cooking time.

Wow, I just made this with cream cheese icing and it is wondeful! I used fresh grated ginger, ground cloves, nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon and one cup of light brown sugar and one cup of organic cane sugar. I also added toasted pecans. I had to bake for about 45-50 min. The cream cheese icing was 8oz cream cheese, 2 tbsp butter, 2 tbsp fresh honey, and 2 tbsp sugar dissolved in a little water. Definitely making this one again!

Fast and easy! I only do muffins, which turn out great (bake about 45 minutes). I've used a can a sweet potatoes when I was out of pumpkin, which is also excellent. I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and did 1/2 and 1/2 oil and applesauce. I also did one cup white and one cup brown sugar. Those changes are great.

The first time that I prepared this recipe, it was way too sweet. The second time I used 1 1/4 cups of sugar and it turned out heavenly!

This recipe is a keeper!

This is great, but i only used two cups of sugar and was still really sweet. I also used .5 cup of oil and .5 cup of homemade applesauce. I also added .5 tsp. of ginger. Came out really moist and definitely agree it taste better the next day. I will make this again for sure.

This is excellent, as modified by most reviewers - 1 c. sugar, 1 c. brown sugar instead of 3c. sugar; applesauce for half the oil. Also, I used egg whites in place of one of the eggs. Varied the spices to my taste - 2 t. cinnamon, 1/2 t. nutmeg, 1/2 t. ginger, 1/2 t. allspice. Also added some craisins. This is really moist but not overly heavy and dense - excellent. Cooking time WAY off - maybe b/c of the decreased sugar? I used the size pans specified, and my loaves baked in 45 to 50 minutes.

Made these this AM- very easy and yummy- only changes were- used 1cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar only, added a splash of vanilla no ground cloves- and used chocolate chips instead of nuts. made 12 large muffins (done in 35 mins at 350) and one large loaf (done at 1hr 5 mins at 350) very good pumpkin bread

REDUCED TO 2 cups sugar; would use 1 each brown and white in future. No cloves; used 1/2 tsp ground ginger instead. BETTER AFTER IT SAT over night, not so great fresh out of the oven, but the flavours really mellowed as it sat. The frozen loaf is coming out for the Halloween party, and the one on the table has been mostly devoured in one day!!! This will be my go-to pumpkin loaf recipe to use up the half-can that's always left from pumpkin pie :-)

This is my go-to pumpkin bread recipe. I have made this bread many times, usually just as written, sometimes I add 1/2 tsp ground ginger and reduce the amount of cloves. Have replaced some white flour with wheat, which was fine too. Almost never use nuts as family doesn't like them. Also made as muffins, 2 dozen muffins, 35-40 minutes.

I'm excited to eat this but as I sit here waiting - it's been 1.5 hours, I'm wondering if I did something wrong! The top is almost burned up and the inside is still completely raw! Maybe it was my mistake, I put all the batter into one loaf pan instead of two. I should've trusted the recipe but when I saw that all the batter fit into the loaf pan I thought it would be ok :( :( I have been having a desperate craving for pumpkin bread so I really hope this turns out ok...

You might want to try this topped with cream cheese to which you've added a bit of grated orange zest. I've made this pumpkin spice bread at least a dozen times; sometimes exactly as written, sometimes altered to be a healthier with additions and subtractions. It's an adaptable recipe, always delicious.

This was a wonderful recipe. I found no problem with the 3 cups sugar although I'm sure those who suggested the brown sugar as well as the white would be wonderful as well. The bread was perfectly moist and I sent some with my boyfriend to his work to share with his coworkers. They loved it! Next time I'll try them as muffins with a cream cheese frosting! Maybe for Halloween!

Very nice. Good flavor, great texture. I would have appreciated a bit more pumpkin flavor, thusly 3 forks. Like others, I did modify the recipe to use one cup white and one cup brown sugar. It was plenty sweet--can't imagine what three cups would have tasted like. Also, the spices seemed out of balance to me--lots of cloves taste bitter. I used 1/2 tsp. cloves, 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1 generous tsp ground ginger, 1/2 tsp. allspice and a scant 1/2 tsp. nutmeg. I use freshly grated nutmeg, and a tsp. in any recipe will overwhelm it.I'll make this again, and next time add some dried cranberries. I might use chocolate chips, but they I'll omit the allspice and nutmeg. I don't like the combination of nutmeg and chocolate.

This recipe was very good. I mashed my own pumpkin and used 2 cups. I cooked it a little longer because of the fresh pumpkin mash. I didn't have ground cloves so I substituted 1 teaspoon of allspice. I loved how the edges of this bread are crunchy/chewy and it's even better sliced in the toaster!

I used 1 c each brown sugar and white sugar, 2 eggs & 1 egg white, and 2 tsp cinnamon & 1 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I also didn't have two bread pans so I baked half the recipe as muffins for 40 minutes.

I love this recipe. It really lends itself to experimenation, freezes well and I have never made a bad batch. Basic Variation-- I always reduce the sugar to two cups (I use raw sugar so have never felt the need to use brown and white sugar). I did a blind taste test with my family and all including my son who loves sweets preferred the one with less sugar. I had a contest to guess what was different - none guessed that one had less sugar. Favorite Variation-- I up the spices 1 and a half teaspoons each and to add 1 to one and an half cups of pecans- pulverized in the food processor- then add 1 cup of chocolate chips (a mix of semi sweet and milk chocolate chips). The fat in the nuts makes it very moist and enhances the flavors of the pumpkin and spices. Kid/School Friendly Variation-- When I send this to school I delete the nuts. Because of nut allergies schools are very concerned about nut allergies (rightly so). To account for the missing fat I use either plain yogurt or sour cream to replace the fat and moisture from the pecans. Last year my son had a vegan in his class and I made a loaf using olive oil intead of pecans and dried cranberries instead of chocolate chips - it was a big hit - his mom wrote to me for the recipe.

i used 1.5 teaspoon cinnamon and added 1 tsp of ginger. i also cut sugar to 1 c. tasted good, but needed more moisture. in the future, i would cut flour to 2c OR increase the pureed pumpkin to 3 c. flour to puree ratio should be at least 1:1. would definitely make again. i also added 2 c chocolate chips.

We love this recipe. I used 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1 1/2 nutmeg and 1/2 cloves. Also used olive oil and whole wheat flour (trying to be more healthy). As was suggested by previous reviews, used 1c. granulated and 1c. brown sugar. Turned out very moist and flavorful. I probably would have liked it with 3c sugar, but is very good with less, too. My husband thinks it would be even better with a maple glaze on top. May try it next time.

Very good bread! I added about a tsp of vanilla, otherwise I kept the recipe the same. I didn't have 2 larger loaf pans, so I used 3 smaller ones. I also cut the cooking time to around 40 minutes (check after 30) & it turned out perfectly. The pumpkin flavor & spices came through. My husband & I each brought one loaf to work & it disappeared in no time.

I recently had Squash Quick Bread from Seattle's Macrina Bakery. A friend gave me a butternut squash recently when she went out of town and I was desperate to find a quick bread recipe. The ones that came up when I searched squash bread didn't meet what I was wanting. Then I decided to change my search to pumpkin bread. That is when I came across this wonderful recipe. I substituted 16 oz of steamed, pureed squash and the result was incredible. I can't wait to make it again and have it be a regular treat in my home. Thanks, Vern!

Rating: 4
I chose this recipe because I had a small butternut squash that needed using, which I substituted for pumpkin (steamed and pureed, it made a little less than 2 cups.) I had already mixed the 3 c. sugar and 1 c. vegetable oil when I realized I hadn't read the reviews. I stopped and read them, and the main thing that stood out was that the bread was too sweet when made as written. So I took out 1 c. of the sugar/oil mix, and instead of replacing 1/3 c. oil I added 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce. Then I followed the rest of the recipe, adding an additional 1 tsp. of cinnamon and an additional 1/2 tsp. salt. I put nuts in half the batter and raisins in the other. Baked for about 55 minutes in two loaf pans. Delicious!

I was on a pumpkin kick this year and tried making this recipe as my first stab at a pumpkin bread. Did not need to go any further - it is moist and DELICIOUS! I used spice amounts quoted in the recipe and skipped the nuts. I did find that the recommended bake time is too long. I've made this twice and both times baked for only 55 minutes (not sure if this is due to dark/nonstick loaf pans?) My aunt is the baker in our family, and almost all of my recipes are from her. I brought this pumpkin bread to a family holiday gathering and she asked me for my recipe (a first!). Also - as noted on recipe - it freezes extremely well. Both times I froze 2nd loaf after completely cool and let defrost on counter a few weeks later. Tasted same as day it was made.

everyone loves this bread! i've also made it without the nuts, and have added golden raisins. i like to sprinkle a little sugar on top before baking to make a crunchy crust, and i also omit about 1/2 cup sugar from the recipe. it's a little too sweet otherwise.

Rating: 4
I make this over and over again, but i definitely modify it to suit my tastes. First, I roast my own pumpkin...slice in half, scoop out glop, rub in olive oil and roast at 400 for an hour, then puree. Next, I cut the sugar to 3/4 c white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar. It's still plenty sweet. I use one stick of butter, plus a half cup of either low fat sour cream or yogurt, depending on what i have on hand. And finally, I use 2 cups of bread flour and 1 cup of whole wheat flour, because I like it to have the texture of actual bread not cake. I've passed this on to tons of people and they've all loved it!

Rating: 2
I have made this twice now. I only made it a second time because of the heaps of great reviews. Followed other's suggestions (reduced sugar, upped the spices). The result was a dense moist cake. But in a blind taste test I doubt I'd even pick it out as pumpkin bread. The pumpkin flavor is lost, and it's not spicy enough. I love pumpkin bread and will continue to try other recipes rather than sticking with this one, which I think is weak.

I made this with 1c white and 1c brown sugar, 2 eggs & 1 egg white, about 2 1/2 or 2 3/4 cups fresh home-grown pumpkin puree, i also added about 1/2 to 3/4 cup chopped candied ginger, used fresh ground nutmeg, and doubled all the spices. It came out fabulous! moist, delicious -- great accompaniment to citrus tea or in the morning with cream cheese. makes me wonder how it would've come out without all the suggested alterations tho...

Delicious bread when using the few tweaks mentioned by other reviewers. 1c. ea. of brown & white sugar, addition of 2t. vanilla extract, plus I mixed in apprx. 1c. of orange candied cranberries (fr. Trader Joe's) along w/ the walnuts. Next time I will increase the amount of pumpkin puree to make up for using less sugar (affects moistness). Baking time was way off. 30 mins. using convection was just right. Great that I had all ingredients on hand for a last minute holiday gift, plus a loaf for the family

I got a lot of positive feedback from everyone who had some of this bread. I did take some of the suggestions below. I more than doubled all the spices as well as cutting the sugar to 1C white & 1C brown. It gave it the spiced flavor without being too sweet. Definitely make this again and again.

I'm glad I took other's advice and cut the sugar to 2 cups. The bread still tastes like a dessert with 2 cups of sugar. I used 2 eggs and 1 egg white.For the spices, the suggestion of using using 2 heaping tsps of cinnamon and a heaping tsp of each of the others was perfect. I did use about 22oz. of pumpkin, since we love pumpkin, and the bread was like any other dessert cake in consistency-not airry, not wet. There are so many layers of flavor:pumpkin,nuts,the taste of each spice, and then the texture, adding anything else would have ruined the dessert for me. If I had kids I might add chocolate to interest them in the bread the first time.

I'm only giving this recipe three forks because I made quite a few changes. Minor ones - but changes nonetheless: I cut back the sugar to 1-1/4 C. of each kind. I cut the oil in half and added 1/2 a cup of unsweetened applesauce. I used 2 heaping tsp of cinnamon, heaping tsp's of the other spices, 1/2-tsp of ginger and 1-tsp of vanilla and 1- tsp of salt. I used both the walnuts as called for and 1-cup of semisweet chocolate chips. The changes make this bread nice and spicy - a little less sugar and fat - but still somewhat luxurious with the chocolate.

This is truly a very versatile bread. I tried it the first time and followed the recipe to the letter. It turned out excellent. I made it a second time with minor changes (I upped the cinnamon all the way to a tablespoon, used 1/2 teaspoon of cloves, and 1/2 teaspoon of ginger, and I upped the salt to almost a full teaspoon) and it was excellent. I also added cranberries and raisins (soaked first in hot water to plump) and loved loved LOVED it! This will be one of my standard fall recipes from now on.

This is by far the best pumpkin bread I've tasted. It will stay moist for a long time, so its great to make ahead. After reading some of the reviews, I too, cut the sugar down and used 1 cup organic cane sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.

Cut recipe in half to make one loaf, used butter instead of oil (melted it to be sure it was enough liquid to substitute equally) and sprinkled regular sugar on top before baking to make the crust a teeny bit crunchy, which was a neat texture with such a moist bread.

This was very tasty... I followed the recommendation to cut sugar to 2 cups (one brown, one white), which makes it a nice breakfast bread-type of sweet. I might add another half cup next time (2.5 cups total), to make it more of a dessert. I also used heaping teaspoons for the spices and added finely chopped crystallized ginger (4 tablespoons) for a nice kick, plus toasted chopped pecans.

I routinely (as in weekly) make this bread come fall through the holidays, and I can't seem to make it fast enough... I use heaping teaspoons for the spices with the addition of allspice and omit the walnuts. It's great the day it's made, but even better a day or two later after it's cooled and sits in a ziploc baggie -- so very, very moist. It's sweet, but it's fantastic with a cup of good coffee. Also good as dessert when served along with a scoop of ice cream!

Yes, a bit too sweet. I would also cut the sugar a bit next time. But, VERY good. Would make it again and again. Especially a hit with kids.

Made this with only 2 c sugar as others had suggested (1 white, 1 brown). Came out delicious - very moist and nicely spiced. I made smallish muffins and it only took 1/2 hour to bake.

Made this recipe according to directions except I did add 1/2 teas. of ground ginger as some others had suggested. It was very good and very moist. I felt that it was a bit too sweet and would cut back on the sugar if I made it again. I also wish that the pumpkin flavor had been more pronounced.

Rating: 3
I followed suggestions and cut the sugar to 1 c. (1/2 white, 1/2 brown.) I think i also upped the amount of pumkin slightly and added some chopped crystalized ginger that i had on hand. It was very good and very moist- will make again.

Rating: 3
I made this twice. The first time, I noted that it was sweet, but I couldn't taste any of the spices I'd used. The second time, after reducing the sugar content by one cup, I got more of the spice flavours. And my friends loved the second one just as much as the first, if not more. Here are my alterations: 2 cups sugar, 2 teaspoons vanilla Fresh "pie pumpkin" (not canned) Olive oil rather than vegetable oil Egg beaters or their equivalent for the eggs. Also, next time I make it, I'm going to add 4 Tablespoons of low fat sour cream to make it more moist.

This is an excellent base recipe to work with. I made half of the recipe but increased the spices. I also added some ground ginger to the mix, as well as dark chocolate chips instead of nuts. I also did not have any eggs on hand and found a wonderful substitute (2 tbls of cornstarch with 2 tbls of water for each egg). Great recipe. I will definitely experiment with other flavors and additions to this.

700+ reviews don't lie! Made this exactly as written except that I cut the sugar down to 2 cups according to earlier reviews. Very tasty and easy!

Okay, I actually MADE THE RECIPE AS WRITTEN, and it's alright. It isn't overly pumpkinish, so if you're looking for a more pronounced pumpkin flavor this probably isn't it. My family loved it, and it was easy, so we'll probably have it again. I think four forks is a bit much, but if you read the reviews, you'll see almost all of them changed the recipe, then reviewed their own creation.

This is a huge favorite in our house. I've made it as written - very good, not too sweet for me but still sweet. More frequently I change it up to make it healthier with a mixture of white flour, whole wheat flour and ground flaxseed (you really can't tell it's in there), reducing the sugar to 2 cups, and using 2/3 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. And upping the cinnamon and the nutmeg each to 1.5tsp. Excellent either way and easily modified!

This is a wonderful fall and holiday bread. Easy to make and keeps well. Always a favorite amongst family, friends and hungry sailors at my husbands command. I usually add a little extra on the spices.

Great! I used 1/2 cup oil, and 1/4 c melted butter, plus some plain yogurt and flax seeds to make up for the rest of the oil. Added chopped toasted pecans, and topped it with a sprinkle of pepitas. I don't agree that it's too sweet; i used 1 cup brown and 2 cups turbinado, and plenty of salt, and its delicious.

Rating: 3
I made a more wholesome version by substituting 1.5 cups brown sugar and 1 cup molasses for sweetening, scaling back oil to 1/2 cup plus 3 TB butter, and subbing one cup of whole wheat flour. Baking soda went up to 1.5 teaspoons to make up for the acid in the molasses. This made a really good, rustic bread that's still sweet and moist (my husband couldn't stop eating it) and more appealing if you like hearty, rustic fare.

I followed the recipe exactly except I could only find a 15 oz can of pumpkin. It was good, but a little two sweet. I think I'll follow the Cook from Quebec's suggestions next time, except without raisins (personal dislike), or at the very least, cut back on the sugar. I made 12 jumbo muffins and they only took about 35 minutes.

i altered this recipe a little, to much success. first, i used real pumpkin, instead of canned. i baked a smallish sugar pumpkin until it was tender, and scooped out the meat. then, used that is place of the 16 oz. of canned. i also added chocolate chips instead of walnuts. it was delicious! i made two loaves, and a tin of muffins. i think the muffins turned out better. they only needed about 20 minutes to bake, as well.

This officially replaces apple pie as the most heavenly kitchen aroma!! I made this recipe years ago, and remember reducing the sugar to one cup white, one cup brown. I seem to recall it being more bread-like, rather than cake-like. When I came across this recipe again recently, I decided to try it as written. I remember it being good then, but GREAT now. The only thing I did differently was out of necessity -- I didn't have cloves on hand, so I decided to forgo all the spices, and add 4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead. The spiciness seemed just right.

Reduced sugar by 0.5c, added diced crystallized ginger, substituted 0.25 c butter and 0.75 c light sour cream for the oil, bumped the cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg up by 0.25 tsp and used a large muffin tin. They came out moist and tasty.

Pretty Good! I would like more pumpkin flavor. I used 1 c. brown sugar and 1 1/2 c white. (I was conflicted with the reviews on sugar type and amount!) The texture is perfect, cake like. I put it in a 10x14 or so pan. I frosted it with a cream cheese, whip cream frosting, with brown sugar and maple flavor. I think without the frosting, it would be a bit bland. Regardless I really like it (as well as my fiance who is finishing a second slice as I type!) Although I would try one cook's addition of ginger (duh! why didn't I think of that!)

Rating: 2
Made the modifications everyone else did - doubled the spices, used just 2 cups sugar, and replaced half the oil with home-made chunky applesauce. The little chunks of apple provided a nice textural contrast. The only new thing I did was to use 1 cup whole wheat flour (didn't have WW pastry), and was worried that the bread would turn out too tough, but it was fine. No nuts.

I made this recipe last fall and, while it was delicious and quickly consumed, I felt it could use some improvements to better suit my taste. This fall I plan on cutting the sugar by at least a cup because I thought the first version was too sweet and too much like cake. I also plan on using olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I may or may not have doubled the amount of spices the first time, but might do so this next time.

Followed others' recommendations and used two cups of sugar -- one brown one white. I also baked them as muffins, two dozen, and they turned out really well. Added toasted pecans, too, which gave them a nice additional flavor.

I like the flavor, but I will use the full 3 cups of sugar next time. I've made this in the past, and I was looking forward to a sweet, cake-like pumpkin bread. The reduced sugar reviews make for a mild "bread," but I'll go for the full-on sugar next time.

Lol. It almost seems silly to add my two cents to all these thoughtful reviews. All I want to add is my minor changes.

It travels well.

This is better than the Joy of Cooking recipe, and much easier to make. I generally substitute half the vegetable oil with unsalted butter, and 1/3 of the white flour with whole wheat flour. Delicious served warm with butter and a cup of mulled cider. My favorite treat for the holidays!

The first time I tried this (made by someone else) I thought it was pretty good. After making it and eating more of it, I realized that this is waaaaay to sweet -- the excessive sugar taste overwhelming every other flavor and giving me a headache! I started tinkering it a little, by decreasing the sugar, but for some reason, it still tastes too sweet. I gave it 2 forks because for that first slice, I enjoyed it.

Rating: 4
For a slightly healthier version of this recipe I used 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat pastry flour in place of white flour. In addition, I also cut the sugar to 2 cups and half of that was brown sugar. I added a bit more pumpkin and 3 Tbsp of whey protein powder. I also added a healthy tsp of vanilla. I did up the spices a bit to be heaping measurements but would not do this again with the clove as it is too strong. I made 4 small loaves and they were done at 45 minutes. Very yummy and a bit healthier!

In an attempt to half the recipe, I botched the math and ended up with 4x the baking soda and salt, plus 2x all the spices. Everything else was appropriate.

I disagree with a previous reviewer about not being able to cut down the sugar - I cut it down to both 2 cups and 2.5 cups, and it came out moist and wonderful both times. I preferred the 2-cup version, though, especially when using Libby's pumpkin, which was sweeter than the organic stuff I used the second time. I increased the cinnamon as others suggested, and used canola oil. This recipe is a real keeper.

I was looking for a quick and easy way to use up some extra canned pumpkin, at the restaurant where I work ,when I tried this recipe. I also doubled the spices and the results were great! However, I wouldn't recommend decreasing the amount of sugar at all. Sugar is Hydroscopic; meaning it absorbs and retains moisture. It makes baked goods moist and gives them a tender crumb. Which is exactly what these loaves have. Next time I will try putting a little streusel topping for extra pizazz.

I love this recipe. I love it even more with these changes: 1) Try to find Asian pumpkins. Just cut the pumpkin into chunks (with the skin!) and deseed. Boil and puree in the blender. It gives the bread a better taste and texture. And you can use leftover puree to make pumpkin pancakes! 2) Instead of walnuts, use toasted, chopped pecans. 3) Sometimes I'll replace a 1/2 cup of the nuts with a 1/2 cup of dried cranberries. Yum! 4) My boyfriend likes if I put a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips in instead of the cup of nuts. I think that one is only for people who really love chocolate. Also, applesauce in place of the oil is just as good!

Meh. Not a recipe I'd write home about. There really wasn't much of a pumpkin favour to it. Like others suggested, I decreased the sugar to 2 cups (one brown and white) and found it not quite sweet enough. I added dried figs and walnuts in one loaf and found it much more interesting than the one I made without the figs. Also made a cream cheese frosting to try to give it just that little extra something... But wouldn't make again. I grew up loving my mom's zuccinni bread, so I'll go back to making that instead.

MAKES GREAT MUFFINS! Following the suggestions, I made this recipe with 2 cups sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, plus double the cinnamon and nutmeg, and subbed half the oil with applesauce. It makes them just sweet enough. I also reserved half the walnuts to spinkle on top and baked in mutliple sizes: loaf (60 min to bake), regular muffin (12 min), and mini muffin (9 min). The minis were best---filling the batter to the brim of the mini-muffin tin makes gorgeous little 3-bite brunch goodies with the quintessential "muffin top."

Adding another voice to the chorus: can't imagine this w/3 cups sugar, used 1 cup brown and 1 cup white, which was plenty sweet and let the pumpkin flavor through. Used 1-1/2 tsp ea. cinnamon and nutmeg, but didn't increase the cloves (even a tsp. is a lot of that). Added a generous cup of dried cranberries instead of walnuts; it was good but I think toasted nuts would be better (couldn't use because of allergies). As far as I could tell a 15 oz. can of pumpkin works fine, I didn't add anything to compensate. Two 9x5 loaves baked in more like 60 minutes than 70. Ignore the instruction to serve one the day you make it: this tastes a whole lot better the next day. This is a very pleasant, inexpensive recipe that can be put together in a matter of minutes.

I love this bread and eat it for breakfast, with an afternoon cup of tea or as a TV snack later in the evening. It's very simple, moist and perfectly spiced (the clove is critical). I skip the walnuts as I don't care for them, and, for added fiber, I substitute whole wheat flour for up to half of the recommended amount. Next time, I'll follow others' suggestions and use applesauce in place of 1/2 the oil. I've made this over and over - it's a keeper!

I usually make the Pumpkin Walnut bread from Bon Appetit Oct 2000 and I like it better than this one but this is good too and I always have these ingredients whereas I do have to make a trip to the store for the other. I used 1/2 oil with 1/2 cup applesauce. Next time I will bake it for less time, I checked my loaves after 55 minutes and they were already over done so were a little dry. I also forgot to add the walnuts but will add nuts or maybe cranberries next time. It's nice that it makes two loaves.

This is my new favorite holiday recipe. I followed reviewer's suggestions and doubled the spices. I also substituted one cup of sugar for light brown sugar.

I made this recipe again and again it was a huge hit. I used 2 cups sugar, 1 cup brown sugar, and doubled the spices. I made it as a bundt cake. It is so moist that way!

I made this because of the other reviews. I used 1 3/4 cup sugar and used chopped dates. I used 15 oz of pumpkin. This bread did not taste that great when it came out of the oven. It was sweet enough, it just lacked the flavor I was expecting from the other reviews. The dates were essential. Otherwise it wouldn't have tasted very good. However after a day in the fridge it was much much better and I really liked it. I recommend storing it in the fridge for a day before tasting.

I feel like I have been making this every other day since October because my kids gobble it up as fast as I make it. I usually make 1 loaf of bread and 1 pan of muffins. Instead of 1 cup of oil, I do 1/2 cup and 1/2 cup applesauce. I find that it is much too oily with 1 cup. Making them as muffins makes it easier for them to take for school snacks since the bread is so moist it tends to fall apart. Also it only takes 30-25 min to cook, so they don't have to wait!

Rating: 4
I'm reviewing this again because I keep on making it. I just made 8 loaves for a school event and a couple meetings. I use the brown and white sugar, 1 cup of oil and I double the spices (including the cloves). Plus I always use the cranberries. I love this bread and just bought more pumpkin to make several loaves for Thanksgiving. It is great!

Fantastic recipe. I adopted some of the changes I read in the reviews (1 cup brown 1 cup white sugar, doubling all the spices except cloves, and replacing walnuts with dried cranberries) and my friends can't get enough of it.

Yowza, these are good! I've made this recipe 2x--the first, I forgot (!!) half the oil, and it still turned out pretty great (added dried cranberries & made 2 loaves). Yum. 2nd time made muffins, & consciously left out half the oil, but this time, replaced it w/1/2 cup plain lowfat yogurt. Scrumdiddlyumptious! Also used 15-oz. can pumpkin (all I had), & halved the sugar, using 1 1/2 cups brown sug. Have I said how good these are?! These also freeze well & toast up beautifully! :D

Rating: 4
Fabulous with a view modifications. I make this every year around Thanksgiving, and it always garners raves. This year, I've cut the recipe by 2/3 and made it in 5 small loaf pans (easier for giving and freezing), but still overestimating on the spices (I heap all the teaspoos and also add ground ginger). Bake for about 45 minutes. Perfection!

Good, but too sweet as written. Next time I would use only 2 cups of sugar. Also, I used pecans instead of walnuts since that's what I had in the pantry and I doubled the spices (except the clove)

I've been making this for years and always receive compliments. I also reduce sugar to 2 cups - 1c white, 1c brown - and double all spices. I use fresh pumpkin as well - I'm convinced it adds to the flavor of the recipe. Freezes well (as does the leftover pumpkin if you puree fresh pumpkin).

This is the one and only go to recipe for pumpkin bread (cake). I usually make it in one of those interesting shaped bundt style pans. It is perfect. It is a good keeper and can be frozen. I too love to add grated fresh ginger and sometimes finely chopped crystallized ginger.

Cannot praise this recipe highly enough. It's incredibly forgiving of experimentation and substitutions. I always triple the spices and add ground ginger. For some reason, I can only get 15 oz cans of pumpkin, and have added either yogurt, applesauce or sour cream to make up for the missing ounce. I've used butter, olive oil, and coconut oil in varying proportions for the shortening (coconut oil yielded the moistest, most velvety result!) I always use brown sugar as one of the 3 cups of sugar. Will never try another recipe again - this is the Holy Grail. Everyone raves about it. Makes an excellent hostess gift, too.

My friends and family loved this recipe - I will admit to changing a little! I only had self-rising flour and Pumpkin Pie spice. I also added raisins that I soaked in rum overnight. I made cupcakes and topped with whipped cream and sprinkled pumpkin pie spice on top. They were a big hit.

I cut the recipe in half for one loaf. Wanted a healthier version, so I used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar (omitting another 1/2 cup called for). Used 1 cup white flour, 1/4 cup wheat and 1/4 cup ground flaxseed. For oil, used half applesauce and half canola oil. Substituted raisins for nuts due to allergies. I was expecting a tasteless brick but instead got a delicious, moist, flavorful and even sweet bread. This was easy to make and yummy warm out of the oven. It was also done in 50 minutes.

Terrific pumpkin bread! Actually, I made this into cupcakes with cream cheese frosting for my child's class. Took everyone's advice and cut out a cup of sugar- which was a great idea. Would have been way too sweet. Used pumpkin pie spice, and no cloves, as I didn't have any on hand. The whole thing turned out nice and pumpkiny with a good hint of spice. (The batter is so yummy and really hard to resist. I am surprised there was any left to bake after I "taste tested" it !!)

Rating: 4
AN EXCELLENT RECIPE!!!! I read over most of the comments written by others before attempting to make this recipe. I followed the suggestion of decreasing the sugar to 2 cups, as well as lowering the oil to 2/3 of a cup [I also added 1/3 buttermilk as one reviewer suggested]. I doubled all the spices too. I also added 1 tablespoon of finely grated fresh ginger. I didn't add the nuts though. I baked the cake in a bundt pan for the time indicated. The finished product is perhaps the moistest cake ("bread" if you want to call it that) that I have made recently. It is wonderful! I will definitely make this again. If I was making this again for company, I would change the sugar to 2 1/2 cups and keep the oil to one cup (as well as doubling on the spices). Options I would consider: chocolate chip pieces or maybe shredded carrots.

This is a delicious recipe! My neighbor looks forward to receiving a loaf every year for his birthday. Sometimes, I'll even divide the batter into mini loaf pans and give them fresh and warm to my neighbors on Christmas day. I thought about experimenting a little too - like maybe adding some cream cheese icing.

I loved this and so did my coworkers who had never heard of pumpkin bread before. I may have turned them into believers ;) I used 2 cups brown sugar, since I was out of white, 3/4 cup oil, and fresh Japanese pumpkin boiled and mashed with a bit of milk. I also added fresh chopped ginger and used 3tsp cinnamon and 2tsp nutmeg. A keeper for sure!

Easy to make and very tasty.

Due to the overwhelming advice of previous bakers, I too made some substitutions. The result was wonderful. 2c of brown sugar, and 2/3c of oil with 1/3c of buttermilk. Also, I doubled the amount of spice and used pumpkin pie spice rather than the suggested combo. Lastly, I was using leftover pumpkin, and I think it was probably more like 18oz. I made one loaf, and 9 medium sized muffins, and they all turned out perfect. Moist, not sickly sweet & pumpkiny! Definite keeper.

This is so good that I asked myself why I made it. Only because I keep eating it. This recipe made 2 large loaves. I added rasins to mine and it was wonderful. Next time I make this I am going to subsitute Splenda for the sugar so that I don't feel as guilty eating this. :)

My children love this bread (so do I)! I made so many changes though, I wonder what the original recipe would be like! I used all whole wheat flour, slightly less oil, only 2 cups sugar (raw, not white or brown), a 15-oz can of pumpkin, and I added ginger. Oh, and I left out the nuts (little kids, you know...). Somehow there was only enough batter for one regular size pan and a small loaf pan (maybe because I like fuller loaves). I baked the small one for 40 minutes and the larger one for 1 hour. Both came out beautifully. I will make this pumpkin bread again for sure and maybe increase the spices a little as other bakers have suggested. Great bread - hard to stop eating it!

Wow! This was good. Emboldened by the previous reviews, I decided to experiment to make this a little more health-conscious, since we're dieting but still wanted a good, welcome to Fall treat. Here we go: I used only 2 cups of organic sugar (which has a stronger, almost brown-sugary taste). Instead of the oil, I used 1 cup of Trader Joe's unsweetened, chunky applesauce. Non-chunky would probably work, but I really liked the big pieces of apple. I also used 2 cups of whole wheat flour & 1 cup of regular all purpose flour. I did a couple of other substitutions that have nothing to do with health, but what I had on hand: I used 1 bread loaf pan and 1 mini-bundt pan. The mini bundts were done in 30 minutes, while the loaf took about 50. Also, I took the advice of previous posters and doubled the spice, substituting pumpkin pie spice for the cloves & such. With all of my substitutions, it came out really nice. Not too sweet, but sweet enough. It was moist & spicy, and I'll definitely be making this a staple this Fall.

Yum...I love Epicurious for recipes like these that are so easy but make you look like a rockstar baker. I only had one loaf pan, so I made cupcakes with the rest, which cooked to perfection at 20 min. I reduced the sugar to 1 2/3 cups, used mostly brown sugar, did two cups whole wheat flour to one white, and added pecans. Another fabulous easy cake/cupcake recipe from this site is the World's Easiest Chocolate Cake (Mud Cake).

This is the second or 3rd time I've made this recipe. Like other cooks, I cut some of the sugar down to 2 cups and used brown sugar. I also cut the oil down to about 2/3 cup and substituted buttermilk for the other 1/3 cup. In an effort to make it a bit more healthy, I used my food processor on some oatmeal to make my own oat flour. I substituted about 1/2 cup of the flour with the oat flour and this gave the bread a great texture. I also substituted pecans for walnuts and sprinkled some on top as well. The reception was great! Was super tasty, spiced, and moist!

I've made this recipe by only decreasing the amount of sugar--2 1/4 cups of white sugar instead of 3 cups. I've also made it in the past by making substitutions as below--ie, adding more pumpkin to substitute for oil. I think making it with all the oil is definitely better!

I wanted a healthier recipe, so I used 2/3 of the sugar (brown, and it's still plenty sweet), applesauce for half the oil, egg beaters, and 1/3 whole wheat an 2/3 white flour. Took it out 5 minutes early. Came out great, given all the changes.

I was looking for a recipe to use a large can of pumpkin (Libby's 29-ounce can), and per the reviews, many recommended using the entire can rather than the stated 16-ounces of pumpkin. I did just that, along with reduced the sugar to 2 cups (half white and half brown), doubled the spices (at least) and the baking soda and powder, and made small loaves and muffins. Great recipe -- they rose nicely, had a light and not too sweet taste. I made some whipped cream with rum and it is a lovely accompaniment to the cake (yes, it's more cake-like than bread).

It's a real treat that meets the "healthy snack" criteria of my son's kindergarten teacher!

With a few spiffs, this turned out one very large, moist, and family-pleasing loaf which delighted us for a week. For sweeteners, I used 1-1/2 cups light brown sugar + 1/2 cup maple syrup; substituted 1 cup oatmeal flour (process oatmeal in your Cuisinart) for part of the flour; some applesauce in lieu of part of oil; added some ground ginger and dried cranberries. On convection section in an oversized Dansk loaf pan, this was nicely done in 60 minutes.

I didn't have any cloves in the house, so I added 1/2 tsp cardomon and 1/2 tsp allspice instead.

Per previous reviews, took the sugar down to 2 cups (1 brown, 1 white) and cut oil in half and added 1/2 cup applesauce.

Five year old recommends addition of cream cheese frosting (and pink sprinkles) and would consider it for the future. Great recipe and a good way to welcome Fall.

Great treat on an October day. The recipe halves nicely (I used two eggs for half the recipe). I also added a cream cheese swirl on top: blend together 1/2 cup cream cheese, 1 egg and 1/4 cup sugar until smooth. Pour 3/4 of pumpkin batter into your loaf pan. Spread cream cheese mix on top evenly. Cover with remaining pumpkin batter. Swirl slightly with knife for marble effect. YUMM.

I've made the recipe exactly as shown, with fabulous results every time. I've also made the recipe making many of the reviewer's suggested changes, with varying results. My advice is to make it as it's written, occasionally tossing in dried cranberries for a change. It's worth busting your diet for.

The first time I made this bread it was so-so, but I used all whole wheat flour and 1/2 splenda. The second time around I tweaked it a little and had much better results. I used 2 cups of sugar total, 1 white and 1 brown. 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 2 cups of white. I also doubled all the spices and used pecans. In one loaf I added dried unsweetened cherries, which I would highly reccomend! Easy and YUM!

This bread is dangerously good! I made one bread and a dozen muffins with this recipe. The muffins can come out of the oven after about 30 minutes.

This has been my one-and-only pumpkin bread recipe for 10 years now -- but I used only one cup of sugar which lets the pumpkin flavor and spices take center stage. You can realiably cut the sugar in half in nearly all recipes (an exception is Toll House cookies!) -- but don't consider it a sacrifice, for the feature flavor (here, pumpkin) will really stand out vs everything tasting the same (pure sweetness).

Rating: 3
I agree that this bread is much better the next day. I followed suggestions from some reviewers and reduced the sugar to two cups: one cup sugar/Splenda and one cup brown sugar. Also substituted half cup of applesauce for half cup of the oil with excellent results. I feel that chopped walnuts are essential. Delicious!

I tried this straight out of the oven and was not impressed. Had a slice the next day and was floored. So yummy! To one loaf I added walnuts and cranberries. To the other chopped crystalized ginger. So, so tasty!

This is absolutely wonderful. It was a breeze to make, tasted delicious, and stored wonderfully in the refrigerator. Also, since I live by myself, I made mini-loaves and stored a bunch in the freezer. They dethaw quickly and taste just as good.

I'm making this for the second time this week, and agree with the last review - it's really easy (takes less than 1/2 hour) and delicious. And yes, it's a cake. I realized the second time that I'd forgotten the baking powder the first time, but it came out so moist and wonderful that I decided not to add it the second time either. I substituted raisins and dried cranberries for walnuts and it was great.

This recipe is (1) incredibly easy to make, and (2) incredibly addictive. Let's not be coy; this is a cake, not a bread. Since I prefer it in more of a snack cake size, I make it in two 8x8 square pans and cut the baking time to about 40 mins. For extra addictive powers, I add a cream cheese frosting or do a cream cheese swirl prior to baking, but it's plenty moist on its own. I always end up taking the second pan to work and it's usually gone by lunch. This is a big payoff for something that requires so little effort (and makes my more elaborate creations feel jealous). Enjoy!

LOVED IT, LOVED IT, LOVED IT! I bake very seldom and I baked one of these for my Nanny for Christmas. I used the other half of the batter for muffins for company. Outstanding! My company loved them!

I changed this recipe somewhat: I used a bit more pumpkin (about 3/4 of a 29 ounce can), doubled the amount of spices, and substituted a cup of light brown sugar for one of the cups of white sugar. I also used a 9x13 inch cake pan instead of two loaf pans. It came out very moist and rich, more like cake than anything else. With walnuts in the batter and a cream cheese frosting (like for carrot cake) it would've been even better. I was pleased with the results.

First time I've ever made Pumpkin bread and this was sooooo easy! I used the cup of oil as called for, but being a novice cook, I made a (delicious) error... I measured the 3 cups of flour before sifting... The bread turned out super. Very light and beautiful. I would make this again.

I've made this exactly as written, and with many of the adaptations written about by others. I leave out 1 cup of sugar, and do mostly applesauce with only a little bit of oil. I bump up the spices a bit as well. This bread has come out well every time, with every variation. I'm making muffins with chocolate chips in them right now. It is nice to find a recipe so flexible, easy, and delicious.

I also modified this recipe a few times with excellent results. I used 1 c. white sugar and 1 c. brown, about 2/3 c. oil and 1/3 c. natural applesauce. I also added slightly more cinnamon and left out the nutmeg. I've also substituted Splenda for some of the sugar before. The loaves freeze well.

Love this recipe. I've been searching for a pumpkin bread that I want to give as gifts - and this one's the winner. I used 1.5 c. sugar and 1.5 c. Splenda as well as decreased the oil to 2/3 c (added 1/3 c. water to help with moisture.) The Splenda may have eliminated some of the super sweetness that has been noted before. I also added about a cup of raisins for fun. Very tasty and festive.

I've made this recipe many times and it's always a winner.

This is my new holiday bread--as my mom said, "maybe the best thing she's ever eaten". I did use 1/2 wheat flour, only 1 c. white sugar and 1 c. brown, and 1/2 applesauce, 1/2 oil. Added 1 c. chocolate chips. It was incredibly moist, definitely tasted of spices but not overpowering, and definitely sweet enough. Made great Thanksgiving gifts, I'll be making it again for xmas!

Simple and delicious. I did some changes: used 1 cup brown sugar, added a bit of ginger, and used only 3/4 cup of oil and it was still very moist. I baked 3 medium loaves, and gave 2 as gifts to friends, who loved it. Will do it again.

This bread is delicious, with a good dose of spice that does not overpower the pumpkin flavor. It is so sweet that it leaves a bit of a sour aftertaste; I might reduce the sugar next time as recommended by several reviewers here. Instead of using two 9x5-inch loaf pans, I baked it in three 8X4-inch foil pans to give away. I tried the suggestion from the cook in Hanover, MA and added a cup of chocolate chips. The chocolate went well with the spices, but it was a bit of overkill in my view. Next time I will use the walnuts instead.

I subbed 1/2 cup of applesauce for 1/2 the oil and used 1 1/2 cup each of white and brown sugar. I baked them as muffins and had enough batter left to fill 3 mini loaf pans. Into the loaves I added a couple of handfuls of chopped, crystalized ginger. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my GOD!! I usually don't go for sweets without chocolate, but these are both so moist and delicious. And the ginger gives the loaves a little bite that makes them irresistable. I really encourage you to try it!

Rating: 3
Just as so many suggested, I used only 1 c. white sugar and 1 c. brown, and this turned out terrific! Next time I'll try the applesauce, although the end result with the oil as stated in the recipe is not heavy or greasy. I added raisins, although I think nuts would be a good addition. And about the spices: to me, it seemed great as is. It calls for a lot of cloves, but that really accents the pumpkin taste... any more would be overpowering. A great recipe -- try it, you won't be disappointed!

Great recipe. I have made this numerous times and all were successful. I cut back on the sugar like others did. One cup white, one cup brown is still plenty sweet. I usually make one loaf, and with the extra batter I make yummy pumpkin muffins.

This tastes just like a pumpkin bread should; moist, yet dense, with good pumpkin flavor. I used 4 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice rather than the spices listed, used one and a quarter cup white sugar and one cup brown, and added Craisins along with the walnuts. Terrific recipe for fall and oh-so-easy!

Rating: 3
Very tasty, BUT....I doubled the spices as most people here recommend. I wish I had not. While not bad, I find that the spices overwhelm the pumpkin flavor and actually leave me feeling quite heady and high after I eat it. That might not be a bad thing, but I just want to warn people before they double the spices to expect something INTENSE.

The BEST pumkin product I've ever tasted. I normally don't like pumkin, but I made this recipe twice and each time came out perfect. Instead of two loaves I made one loaf and 9 large muffins. The first time I made it I reduced the sugar to 2 cups white only, and the second time I made it I reduced it to one cup white and one cup brown sugar. Next time I'll reduce it to 2 cups brown sugar only. My 16 month old loves the muffins, and they taste even better the next day. This recipe will be a favorite in my family, not only thru the fall/winter holidays, but throughout the year.

I have been baking this bread since I found the recipe here last year and my family and friends rave about it! For the chef who posted that the bread was undercooked after 1 hour, maybe I can help. I use whole wheat flour (or half whole wheat and half white flour) and it always comes out perfectly moist without seeming undercooked. The pumpkin bread is also tasty with some semi-sweet chocolate bits thrown in (1 cup).

I think this didn't work because I used glass loaf dishes - I followed most of the recommendations of previous chefs and I cooked them 30 min longer and they were still not cooked thoroughly. I tried this recipe 2 times and got the same result... likely chef error but a note to future implementors of this recipe - don't use glass!

Just made this for the first time as written. Yes, 3 cups of sugar seems like a lot, but this makes a ton of batter--easily 2 large loaves or three smaller ones. I used fresh pumpkin puree and would not recommend adding extra spices if you're doing so--you'll drown the lighter taste of the fresh pumpkin. Mine tasted very spicy with the original amounts. Excellent recipe, excellent bread!

This was the most delicious bread ever. I am completely obsessed with it and plan on making it again. I used Libby's pumpkin pie filling which was perfect because it contained extra spices in it in addition to the spices I added. I used more than about 24 ounces to make it extra moist. Great advice below about the 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar - it was great. Also used 1/2 cup oil 1/2 cup apple sauce. Made one loaf and the rest for mini muffins.

This was fantastic! I substituted (like most) 1/2 cup canola and 1/2 cup applesauce for the vegetable oil, and added a lot more spices.

Thanks to the previous reviewers, I also used the entire 28oz can of pumpkin and increased the baking soda by 1/2t, replaced 1/2 the white sugar with brown and added pecans instead of walnuts. This turned out wonderfully and just fell out of the pans. I'm not much of a baker but this site is changing that! I will definitely make these again, and try some more suggestions (like replacing 1/2 the oil with apple sauce or maybe crushed pineapple to try to make it healthier and cutting down on the sugar, though i did not find it too sweet at all).

Didn't rate it this time because I radically changed the recipe. But it still turned out really nicely. Used "keto" bread mix for the flour (lower carb), 8oz of applesauce and maybe 2oz oil, 4 egg whites and one whole egg, 1 cup sugar (I'll allow that probably 1 1/2 cup would have been better) and mixed in about 1/4 cup mini-morsel bittersweet chocolate chips. I also made both a loaf and muffins. It's not quite as good as when made with the modifications suggested below but for the decrease in carbs, fats and calories it's pretty darn good.

I won't rate this as I made a pretty drastic change: 1/2 applesauce & 1/2 oil to make 1 cup liquids. The bread turned out flat and just plain weird-tasting. Next time I'd try 3/4 oil to 1/2 apple sauce, or simply reduce the amt. of oil.

YUM!! This was great. I took others' advice and added cinnamon and increased all the other spices, and put spiced sugar (brown sugar mixed with spices) on top. I also used about 2/3 cup hazelnut flour (from the King Arthur Flour catalog) in place of that amount of the regular flour, and because I only had 2 eggs I only used 2 instead of 3 (though they were extra-large). It was TERRIFIC - nicely spiced and really soft and moist. Yum! (Oh, and mine only took an hour rather than an hour ten.)

I trippled the cinnamon, doubled the other spices, and added 1 tablespoon ginger. I also reduced sugar to 2 cups, and substituted 1 cup of hazlenut meal for a cup of flour. This makes the bread extra moist, and does not change the flavor. Will use recipe with above changes from now on.

Excellent pumpkin muffins! I also doubled the nutmeg and clove powder, tripled the cinnamon, and added several tlbs of vanilla. Used canola oil (leaves no oil flavor), 1 cup white sugar and 1 and 1/3 cup brown sugar which lends a lovely hint of molasses to the pumpkin. Found that our convection oven baked the muffins in 21.5 minutes at 350 degrees. I'd like to enhance the pumpkin flavor, but this may be a matter of the type of pumkin I used - inexpensive canned pumpkin. I might try some higher end stuff, if I can find some at the health food store, and I'm looking forward to trying this recipe with fresh pumpkin next fall. But overall, my husband and I enjoyed these muffins so much that we made another batch for some friends and neighbors who spontaneously plowed our sloped driveway for us, crumbling a mixture of walnut pieces and sugar on top just before baking. Yum! Definitely recommend this recipe.

I make this recipe often, and find it simple, moist & delicious. I double the spices as others have suggested, and experiment with different add-ins (choc chips are the favorite so far!)

I really love this bread. I only use 2 cups of sugar and that is plenty. The nuts really add a lot to this bread. This recipe makes a great gift when you wrap a loaf in a pretty tea towel and tie it with a ribbon. Merry Christmas!

Absolutely wonderful! I had been searching for a nice holiday bread to make as gifts, and this is perfect. I cut the oil to 3/4 cup, but that is the only alteration to the recipe that I made. It was not too dense, rose beautifully and had the whole kitchen smelling like Christmas. Yum!

This bread was excellent! Somewhat heavy, but not in a bad way. I'll be making this quite a bit.

this bread is good, but very dense. i think next time i make it, i'll add some apples or cranberries to make it more interesting. i also substituted 1/2 cup of oil for 1/2 cup or so of applesauce to cut the fat and it turned out fine- i think next time i'll use more applesauce than oil. i also think next time i'll add more spice than is called for.

This was a really good pumpkin bread recipe. I made it with splenda because I had always wanted to try out a baked good made with splenda. It worked, and it tasted really good, but it had the same aftertaste diet pop does (artificial sweetner), which doesn't bug me a lot, but I'd rather make it with real sugar and enjoy it 100% since I don't make stuff like this a lot anyway...

This is an excellent quick bread that freezes beautifully. The crust kept a nice crispy/flaky quality even after thawing. I noted some other reviewers comments about excessive sweetness. Although the uncooked batter tasted quite sweet, I didn't find the baked bread to be too sweet.

Delicious loaf. Took other's advice and used 1/2 applesauce, 1/2 oil. Put one in the freezer after cooling, but wished I hadn't. The first one got devoured quickly!

Instead of 2 loaves I made 2 9-inch cakes and frosted with Maple cream cheese frosting. I brought it over for Thanksgiving and everyone thought it was great! I only liked it warmed up. But the flavor is good. I also used Applesauce instead of the oil and used Egg Beaters instead of whole eggs. Turned out great.

I agree -- don't change the recipe until after you've tried the original! I found this to be an excellent bread, as did my co-workers who scarfed a loaf down in less than an hour. I like to use 1/2 c. oil and 1/2 c. applesauce, just to cut down on fat content, but it's great as is!

There is a reason why almost every review includes alterations of the original recipe. This bread is only okay. A little too sweet and cakey for me, it tasted like it came from a grocery store. I might make it again, but with one of the recommended revisions.

The bread was very, very moist. Ive never made pumpkin bread, but this was to die for. I will make this recipe for Thanksgiving and Christmas every year.

I've made this bread twice now, the first following the directions exactly and the second with some alterations. It is delicious both ways! I added dried cranberries (as suggested by a previous reviewer) and chopped pecans. I also added more pumpkin, increased the spices x2 and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 granulated. If I had applesauce I'd have used it, however, I did cut back on the oil and still had moist, delicious bread/muffins. My kids (6,4,1) prefer them without nuts/cranberries so I make a batch of each. They are gone in a few days! This will become a regular in our house. As a side note, I personally enjoy reading reviews that contain suggestions or alterations to the original recipe. I find the information very useful, especially when a specific issue (i.e. too sweet, salty, etc.) is mentioned frequently.

My 9 year old twins (G & B) & their many friends love to make various breads. This is great! However, for FOUR STARS with just a few more ingredients try an even (MUCH) better p-bread recipe. A Boston monk bakes several dozen loaves per day of this bread to give to the community; you can find it in "Baking with Borther Boniface" - it's on the net and buying it supports a new library and Senior Health Center in Boston.

I agree with the below comment, don't change the recipe, try it the way it is first and THEN make changes. I see it all over this site and it drives me NUTS! I made this and followed it exactly as written the first time, which was fantastic. Then I tweeked it, using half brown and half white sugar and leaving out the nuts. Fine crumb, very very moist and flavorful, and I made half of that second batch into mini muffins (it made 24 mini's plus one regular sized loaf) Good for breakfast or snacks, too sweet for dinner.

Rating: 4
I get such a kick out of the people who rate this recipe highly and then go on to tell you how they changed this, that and the other ingredient, so of course it is no longer this recipe at all. Rest assured the recipe is wonderful just as written. It produces a very moist, sweet, richly flavored, cake-like result with a fine crumb. I would find it too sweet to serve with a meal, but great as a dessert or breakfast treat. If you want a "breadier" bread, with less sweetness and a rougher texture, this will disappoint, and you should either seek another version or try some of the variations suggested here.

I just made this bread for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit. I changed the recipe to 2 cups sugar and increased the pumpkin as recommended by previous bakers. It was very moist and although the recipe stated that the walnuts are optional, I think it is an important ingredient.

This recipe is fantastic! I thought 3 cups of sugar was a little high, so I cut it down to 1 3/4 cups. I also cut the amount of oil in half and added 1 cup of applesauce. It came out great!! It was very light and fluffy. I will definitely make this again!

Yummy... with tinkering due to recommendations here. Not too sweet, nice pumpkin flavor, pretty color, and definitely moist. I used 1/2 cup oil and about 24 oz pumpkin. I added about 1/2 tsp ginger and heaping tsp of the other spices. I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. I used the walnuts. I made one loaf and a dozen muffins (filled cups about 3/4 full). To the muffins I added about 1 cup of dried cranberries. When I tasted these, I regretted not adding them to the loaf!! They are a great addition. (To make up for that, I made the dried-cranberry spread from this site for the loaf.) A keeper recipe.

I live in the mountains at 9500 ft. so I have to alter all my baking. I used 3/4 t. baking soda, 1/4 t. baking powder, added 2T. milk and 1 t. vanilla. I also doubled spices, added allspice, added 1/2 cup spiced applesauce for 1/2 of oil and reduced sugar to 2 cups. Since much of baking at this altitude is hit or miss, I can say this recipe always is consistently the right texture and size. It tastes wonderful!

This is a great recipe. I used 1/2 cup oil, added more pumpkin, and used 2 cups of sugar. I also cooked it for 50 minutes. It was very moist and plenty sweet. Next time, I'll increase the spices. I'll be making this again!

This bread is wonderful. It is filled with flavor (I can't imagine doubling the spices!). I used 2 cups wheat flour and 1 cup white flour, and only used 2 cups of sugar. It still turned out very sweet. I also baked it for the full 70 minutes and wished I'd taken it out a little sooner so it would have been more moist. But, it's still delicious!

Recipe is fabulous, making the substitutions from previous reviews. Cut down on oil and increase pumpkin. Doubling the spices worked very well. Baked one loaf for my family and the other to give as a gift. Both were eaten by my 3 sons.

I have made this a few times for my boyfriend who just loves pumpkin bread. Like others, I too increased the pumpkin, cut back on the oil, and cut down on the white sugar (though I added brown sugar replacing some of the white). I doubled or at least tripled the spices, to try and give the bread more of a kick. So far the reviews have been very good! I'll make it again this week.

Prepared exactly as written and it came out perfectly. Sugar could be cut back, but it wasn't too sweet as is, and the amount of oil it calls for isn't excessive, esp. for this large of a recipe. Black walnuts would be great in this, if I could find them anywhere!

I changed quite a few things and than it was a 4! I used freshly ground spelt flour, fresh pumpkin, douple the amound of spices (especialy cinnamon) and only 1/2 cup Rapunzel sugar! This makes it a much healthier bread and it was amazing. More sugar and it would have killed it for me.

This was delicious. Based on other reviews, and after looking at other recipes, I cut the sugar to 2 cups as suggested, I also used heaping teaspoons of the cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves and a large can of pumpkin (29 oz) but stayed with the full cup of Canola Oil. It was great, next time, I may try increasing the spices a little more, and doing a combination of white and brown sugar. It was even better the next day!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I used half brown sugar. I think next time though I will try and use applesauce to cut the amount of oil needed. I wanted this to be a dessert more than a bread so I addded a spice glaze on top. Excellent. I am going to make this all Fall.

Well, I made some adjustments to the recipe based on other cooks' suggestions: I used 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup applesauce, 2 cups sugar, 1/3 cup brown sugar, threw in some vanilla, extra pumpkin pie spice, and chocolate chips. Hmmm...I guess it's really not the same recipe after all! We haven't tasted it yet, but if it tastes half as good as my house smells right now, we'll be happy!

I followed other reviewers' comments and cut the oil and sugar, and added a half can of pumpkin. I thought the result was good, but it didn't meet my expectations based on other reviews. The bread was rather dry and the flavors weren't as rich as I wanted. I will try this again, but I may follow the recipe more closely.

Yum. I made this recipe into muffins and baked them for 25 minutes. Thanks for the many suggestions to reduce the sugar and I did.. one cup white sugar and one cup brown sugar and I also put in some golden raisins and a little powdered ginger. I used flour specified for bread as it was the only kind I had on hand. Perfect for a Thanksgiving brunch or while watching the last game of World Series as I did.

Day 3 and the flavor is out of this world, moist and delicious! This is as close to perfect as a recipe can get. Followed other's advice and cut the sugar & oil, upped the pumpkin a bit. Glad to hear the brown sugar worked, I was thinking of that. So easy to make! It's going to become a standard for me. I did wish for a bit more texture, so next time I am going to add nuts and maybe some dates. If you're reading these reviews, you owe it to yourself to try this recipe.

Made exactly according to the recipe. The loaves were nicely moist but had very little flavor: other than the orange color, the pumpkin didn't really come through, and the spices weren't very noticeable other - sugar was only prominent ingredient.

This recipe is the gold standard for pumpkin breads. The only slight change I make is that I use whole spices (nutmeg and cloves) and grind them myself. I think the flavor is fresher and more pronounced than with prepackaged spices. The recipe is great as is, and since I make it only as an occassional treat, I don't worry about the sugar.

This bread is fabulous. I just made it for the second time in as many weeks, and it was a hit both times. I think the oven I used runs hot, but even cutting the temperature and time the second time, it still came out black on the bottom (though not overly dry inside). That is, of course, my fault for not testing it earlier, but I'd recommend checking your bread after perhaps 50 minutes, so that you don't wait until it's cooked too long. I made this with a 15-oz pumpkin jar, simply because that's what they had at the store, but otherwise didn't change anything with the ingredients. I'm sure that you could cut down on the sugar, but I'm perfectly content with this recipe the way it is.

I made some of the alterations suggested by others (decrease sugar-- 1 c. sugar/1 c. dark brown sugar; substitue half of the oil with 1/2 c. spiced applesauce; increase spices -- I used 4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, 1 tsp. cinnamon, and i tsp. ground cloves), and made them as muffins (recipe made ~ 24 medium large muffins) baked at 350 degrees for ~25-30 minutes. Everyone loved them! They were moist and flavorful, with just the right amount of sweetness/spice. I would definitely make these again.

I took the advice of the other reviews and reduced sugar to 2 cups. This does give it a very subtle flavor. If you want it a bit sweeter I recommend 2 1/4 - 2 1/2 cups of sugar. Using applesauce in place of 1/2 of the oil also worked very well. Lastly, I recommend putting a bit more spice in than called for.

This is a very good quickbread. It smells very good when baking, and has an addictive flavor. However, although the recipie says that the breads can be kept in the freezer for a while, I found that they lose their flavor and become rather boring. I would eat them within a week of baking them.

My daughter loves this recipe! We have been making it for 4 years and we never tire of it. Often I make it into muffins and when eating, we spread cream cheese on top. I also decrease the sugar by 1 cup and halve it (1/2 white, 1/2 light brown).

I made this bread over the holidays for many, many families. It was a big hit. Be sure to include the recipe or you will get a lot of calls for it.

I've been looking for a good pumpkin recipe for a while, and this one fit the bill. I took the suggestions below by cutting down on the sugar and using half brown; I also halfed the oil, but used apple butter instead of applesauce, which worked fine and may have added a little additional spice. Though the pumpkin flavor is not terribly strong, the bread smells great, and I found it to be addictive, particularly after sitting for a day or two. Also, I made one loaf and a pan of muffins, and the muffins turned out very well, with baking time adjusted accordingly, of course.

I love this recipe after a few modifications: cut the sugar down to 1 c. white & 1 c. brown, use 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce and substitute 1 cup of whole wheat flour for 1 cup of the regular flour. It's wonderful and guilt-free this way!

I was disappointed after reading such rave reviews. I like pumpkin bread to be sweet, but this was REALLY, REALLY sweet. It was moist and it did have good flavor, but the recipe I usually make is much better. It uses butter instead of oil, which could be part of the difference. This bread was still good, because it's hard to really mess up pumpkin bread, but it wasn't excellent. It was fine.

Very good. It was so moist - I made three small loaves. One of them was eaten 2 days after I made it and it was still super-moist. Completely gobbled up by co-workers. I made the recipe exactly as stated, excepted omitted the nutmeg. The loaves sunk a little in the middle when they were taken out of the oven, but I sliced them and presented them on a plate, so no one could really notice.

Did the 1 cup white sugar/1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 oil, 1/2 applesauce thing, then added raisins and walnuts. Took one to an office party and froze the other to defrost for Christmas brunch. Wasn't present at the office party, but when the leftovers were rolled out the next day, the pumpkin bread was long gone. The other loaf defrosted beautifully and was happily consumed by all at Christmas brunch. Easy, tasty, and obviously open to adaptation. What more could you ask for?

I was very happy with the results of this bread. I served it as a dessert with tea at a light tea luncheon. It went very well with a curry chicken salad. I have several friends and relatives who do not eat sugar because of diebetes, I substituted fructose in equal amount for the sugar (also subbed toasted pecans for the walnuts). This bread is best the next day and keeps moist for a very long time. I have been asked for the recipe by serveal friends who wanted to make it for the holidays.

I only had Libby's pumpkin pie mix on hand, but that worked well. The bread turns out great. It only took about 55 min to cook though. I sprinkled some sugar on top of it after I poured it into the pans (but before I cooked it), and it made for a crispy sweet top.

The bread was good, but nothing to get too excited about.

This was a nice recipe, since I can't find the one my mother used to make while I was growing up. I didn't add cloves, since I don't really care for the flavor, and added ginger instead.

They were still eaten up really quickly, but any suggestions?

Since we didn't have pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving I made this so we'd have some pumpkin flavored item at the table. The bread was very tasty. I went ahead and made it with the 15 oz. can of pumpkin instead of the 16 oz. and it was fine. Also substituted some cashews since I ran out of walnuts. The bread stands on it's own merit. In a perfect world I follow recipes as is, especially the first time out, and would leave this one as written.

This is a wonderful, sweet, dense, cake-like treat. Because of a previous reviewer's clue about the small pumpkin can being only 15 ounces, I did start with the large 28 oz. can and measured 2 cups of pumpkin to insure a good flavor. I have baked this twice and chose not change a thing!

This recipe is good -- but does not taste enough like pumpkin to give it a 4 forks. In response to those who think only those who made the exact recipe should comment... it would make for a boring read. I often use the suggestions of others to improve the recipe, reading between the lines to try and guess at what it might taste like if the recipe was followed exactly as indicated. Some reader says: "I cut the sugar and it was perfect!" Then I know I'll find the recipe too sweet since I usually cut on sugar too. Some reader says: "I added more spices." Then I'll also add spices, since I love cinnamon and nutmeg too... etc. Imagine everyone commenting on the recipe, as is indicated... it would limit what one had to say. And in this case, I could sum it up as: "too oily, too sweet." Thanks to the experiments and comments of another user who DID NOT follow the recipe as indicated, I partly used buttermilk -- and it saved the recipe.

Superb! As we don't eat this every day, we actually MADE THIS AS WRITTEN; OIL, SUGAR AND ALL! CAN YOU BELIEVE OUR NERVE...AS WRITTEN? It was excellent and I would not recommend any changes, just don't eat it every day! We gave several loaves as Thanksgiving gifts, and all requested the recipe, after they had tasted this delight.

As an American in Germany Ive learned to realize that 99% of the recipes are too sweet. I cut the sugar in every recipe in half and its usually still more than enough. This Bread is awesome, even my German Family likes it who actually dont even like pumpkin pie. Cutting down on oil is one suggestion, I use mild olive oil for everything, in such recipes that are fairly spicey you dont know the difference and its healthier.

The bread was delicious. Perfect for breakfast. The pumpkin flavor is subtle and spices are just the right amount. I too followed other reviewers' advice and cut the sugar to 1 cup white and 1 cup brown which was perfect. Also, it cooked in under an hour. Check it at about 50 minutes or follow your nose. . .I half expected my neighbors to be at my door.

Lovely bread - dense, moist and deliciously spicy. No definite pumpkin taste, more like gingerbread. I reduced the sugar to 1 cup white and 1 cup dark demerarra, reduced oil to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup sour cream, added 1/4 cup molasses and 1/4 cup dark rum, doubled all the spices and added 1 tsp each allspice, ginger and vanilla. I increased baking powder to 1 tsp, but oops, forgot to add the baking soda, so my loaves didn't rise very well. Nonetheless, a scrumptious bread - excellent with a cup of tea. Also, they were completely done at 50 minutes, so watch your timing - but could have been my oven. Even better the next day - the flavours really mellow and deepen.

This bread is delicious. I used only 2 cups of sugar. 1 white, 1 brown. I also cut the oil to 3/4 cup. Omitted the cloves,doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg and added 1/2 tsp. ginger and 1/4 tsp. allspice. I made 1 pan of muffins which took only 20 minutes to cook and one loaf of bread which took 1 hour to cook. Sprinkled walnuts on top of the bread for a gourmet look.

Made this twice. First, I followed the recommendations of 1 c. brown and 1 c. white sugar; 1/2 c. oil, 1/2 c. yogurt, and increased spices to 1 1/2 t. each - was fine. Next time, I substituted low-fat sour cream for yogurt, doubled the spices and added 1/4 cup of molasses. Wow - this was fabulous.

I have made this recipe every year since 1995. I cut down on the sugar -- use 1 cup granulated and 1 cup brown. Also I add 1 cup of golden raisins and leave out the nuts. Always a hit. I serve with cinnamon/sugar butter which I make and keep in the freezer during the holiday season.

This is the second time I've made this recipe. This time, I followed the recipe exactly, and it did not come out nearly as good. You NEED to do half white sugar and half brown sugar, and add a little bit more of each of the recipes for this bread to be as good as it can be. Also, I didn't bake mine the full 1 hour ten minutes - more like one hour.

I have been using this recipe since it first came out in 1995. It is very moist and has a great flavor from the spices without overwhelming the pumpkin. We never wait for it to cool and we never have the willpower to save one for freezing-the loaves are devoured within a day! It's that good!

Rating: 3
After reading the reviews, I decided to try 1 cup granulated sugar, 1 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup buttermilk. I also threw in some golden raisins, pecans, and cinnamon chips from Baker's Catalogue (not the ones from the grocery store; they aren't nearly as good). The bread turned out great. I took it to a church function and every bite disappeared, even the ends that I trimmed and left in the kitchen!

This bread was incredible. I will definitely make it again. In order to reduce the fat and calories, I substituted 1 1/2 cups Splenda and 1 1/2 cups brown sugar for the 3 cups of sugar and used only 1/2 cup of oil with 1/2 cup of applesauce. I also took the advice of others and doubled the amount of spices. The result was a moist and delicious bread.

Delicious! Took the other reviewers advice and used 3/4 cup oil, 1-1/2 times the spices (except cloves, used the 1t called for) and 1 cup brown sugar + 1 cup white sugar -- the bread was moist, flavorful, perfectly sweetened and smelled wonderful. The loaves were perfectly cooked at one hour. Everyone, including my two-year-old, loved it.

I took the advice of others who made this bread by reducing the oil to 3/4 cup, and putting 2 cups of sugar rather than 3, half brown and half white.

Unfortunately I found that the bread was too oily and lacked the fresh and full pumpkin flavor I was looking for. Though no fault of the recipe, I discovered the cans of pumpkin I bought were 15 oz and not the usual 16 oz. Not sure if this is a trend in the food industry but its a pain to have to open a second can to use 1 oz.

Made it once as written, except only two cups sugar...definately sweet enough and yummy too. Today I went to make it and didn't have any white sugar so used 2 cups brown, also used homemade applesauce (which I had added spices to already) and added 1/2 teaspoon ginger as well. It's a little denser, but still very good.

i followed the suggestions and used 1 cup each of white and brown sugar. i used all the oil, omitted the nuts and cloves, and added 1 tsp. each of cinnamon, allspice, and ginger. the results were just fine, but i wasn't blown away. i think that next time i will use either 2 1/2 cups of white sugar or 1 1/2 cups each of white and brown, to compare results. and the applesauce seems worth a try. overall, moist and dense and tasty. do check before the hour is up, though - my loaves were done at 50 minutes.

I imagine that the recipe as-is is truly decandent, but what I was able to whip together with what was on-hand was fabulous. I only had one cup of sugar (not two, not three), but I did have one over-ripe banana. So, I used the banana to give it some sweetness and only 1/2 cup of oil. It wasn't my intention to make this low-fat, but I was afraid it would turn out gooey if I used the banana and all the oil. It was a pleasant surprise when it came out very tasty and moist. I also used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 2 cups white.

Followed other reviewers advice and used 1 cup each brown and white sugar. Only other change I make was substituting one of the cups of all purpose flour with wheat flour. It turned out beautifully and was enjoyed for several days with a cup of coffee for a quick breakfast. Delicious and I will definately make again.

This turned out beautifully, and I am not an experienced baker! Just delicious--I made one loaf and one pan of muffins. It is an alarming amount of sugar--Maybe think of this as a dessert! Anyway, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned moist, crunchy on top and delicious--like something out of a fancy coffeehouse.

This is a good recipe. I have made it twice. The first time I only used 2 cups of sugar--1 white, 1 brown-- and doubled all the spices. It was a little too much spice for our household.

Excellent recipe! I reduced the sugar to about 2 cups and oil to 3/4 cup to reduce the calories and the result was very good. I also doubled the spices as many others did. Next time I would do 1.5 times the spices to tone it down. I did muffins instead of loaves and the baking time was just 20-25 minutes!

For cook from Cambridge: I regularly use just 2 cups of sugar (one white one brown) and it comes out just fine and plenty sweet. I was actually thinking of cutting it down a little more. I substitute applesauce for half the oil, and that worked out fine too.

This recipe is always a big hit! I made it three times this holiday, and each time the loaves were rapidly consumed by my coworkers. I use 1-cup white sugar, 1-cup brown sugar, double all spices, 1-cup walnuts and 1-cup fresh cranberries. Cooking time is right at 1-hr 10-minutes in two loaf pans. I tried substituting applesauce for 1/2 the oil last year and could never get it to cook evenly- the applesauce seemed to fall to the bottom of the bread and stay too moist even after baking for over an 1-1/2 hours (but it still tasted good!).

I bake for bi-weekly teas at Harvard, which are attended by over 100 students each time. This got rave reviews when I made it. But I do wonder, doesn't it mess up the recipe to cut out 1 cup of sugar?

Wow, this pumpkin bread was really bliss. I made it for a party and everyone cheered about it. It was extremely moist and tasty.

I found this recipe a long time ago and it's a favorite, but 3 cups of sugar seemed like a lot, and so did 1 cup of oil. So I make these substitutions or changes: 2 cups of sugar instead of 3, 1 cup of applesauce instead of oil, 3/4 cup egg substitute or egg whites instead of whole eggs, and double all the spices except the clove. (Although more clove is okay if you let it sit in the fridge overnight - then that clove-y taste is mellowed a bit).

After reading the other reviews, I started with a modified recipe using 2 cups of sugar (1 reg & 1 brown) and increased spices (double the cinnamon and nutmeg). I found the result tasty, but yet not as exciting as I'd hoped given the other reviews... I then increased the sugar a bit and added even some extra cloves - still leaving it a tad bland to my taste - so next time, if I don't try an altogether different recipe, I think I'll go back to the original 3 cups of sugar and maybe add some allspice or ginger to to the spice mix for some extra "zing". As a note though: the people I made it for all seemed to like it!

Rating: 3
A very good recipe. I used 2c. sugar (brown, and white), as well, and I think it could have used a little more sugar, actually. I had only one bread pan, and so had to make muffins, which were fun for the kids. I served them with cream cheese frosting (a package of cream cheese whipped with a few tbs. butter, some confectioners sugar, and flavored with molasses or cognac -- the cognac spread won!) Served warm, the bread won out over soft rolls and fresh sourdough bread!

After making this differently 3x, I recommend a max of 2c sugar (2c is still very sweet). Once I tried 1c brown, 1c white, but the bread came out a little wet. Just FYI, 16 oz canned pumpkin = 1 7/8 c. I also added 1t vanilla to the wet mixture. I increased cinnamon and nutmeg to 2.5t each, added 1/4 t allspice, 1/2 t ground ginger. No need to increase cloves. I recommend increasing the nuts to 1.5 c. Also, decrease baking time! 22 mins for mini-muffins, 40 mins for an 8x4 loaf pan, 45 mins for a 9x5 loaf pan. The bread comes out perfectly soft inside and crunchy on the top.

I found this recipe to be only 'okay' as well. Very disappointing, especially after reading some of these rave reviews! I made one batch into a loaf, and the second into muffins. I doubled the spices, used half oil/half applesauce, and half white sugar/half brown sugar. The muffins came out very dry, and almost flavorless- they cooked for almost half an hour. The loaf was moister- it cooked for almost an hour- but the spice taste was very, very faint. If I did make it again, I'd try to kick up the spices another notch.

This is much like the one I used to make years ago but lost the recipe. I made two loaves for Thanksgiving day and had to make another one for my husband the day after.

I made this recipe (modified due to lack of certain spices and due to comments from others) in a bundt pan and it turned out okay. I baked it for 55 minutes.

Freeze one of the loafs? This bread it far too tasty to ever make it to the freezer! I made one big loaf and 4 mini-loaves, which worked like a charm. Just cut down baking time for mini-loaves. This recipe is a gem, make it and you won't be disappointed!

This was so good and so easy to make. I have never made pumpkin bread before and was a little skeptical, but all of the reviews said how wonderful it is and they were right. The other loaf didn't even make it to the freezer, so I have to make a second batch.

Absolutely delicious! I did tweak the recipe a little though: only used 2 cups of sugar (1.5 cups regular sugar, .5 cup brown sugar), used 2/3 cup applesauce + 1/3 cup oil to cut down the fat and added a tsp of ground ginger and a cup of dried sweetened cranberries. Very moist and baking it made the whole house smell fragrant!

I've made this many times for different people, and they've all loved it. Makes a perfect gift, or an easy breakfast / snack for overnight guests. My modifications: I use a total of 2 - 2 1/2 cups of sugar, using brown sugar for at least half the sugar needed. I have also started to experiment with substituting buttermilk for some of the oil in the recipe. I'm at 1/2 cup buttermilk and 1/2 cup oil now, and the bread is still wonderfully moist.

this recipe is very good. It's the best pumpkin bread I've ever had. Definitely a keeper.

I took everyone's advice and added two cups of sugar. I added two tbsp of pure maple syrup + 2 tablespoons of milk. Doubled cinnamon and nutmeg only (doubling the amt of fresh ground cloves is asking for trouble imho). Baked in muffin tins and they were moist, flavourful and absolutely yummy!

This was a very nice treat on a chilly fall day! I replaced the oil with applesauce (more for the flavor and texture than for the fat issue...sometimes I find vegetable oil makes bread too sticky/slimy). Great as mini-loaves too (this recipe will make four mini loaves).

This is a good fall recipe. I cut the sugar back to two cups and doubled the spices as recommended by previous reviewers. This is even better the day after you bake it.

Rating: 3
I thought this was a good recipe. I didn't have any ground cloves, so I used pumpkin pie spice and a smidge of ginger in it's place, in addition to the cinnamon and nutmeg. It tasted great, but it is a sweet pumpkin bread. If I made it again, I might use just 2 1/2 cups of sugar and see how that turns out. The best part about this bread is it's moistness. I recommend this recipe!

Rating: 4
This recipe came out really well after a few modifications. It will definitly be one of my regular fall recipes. 1 c. of oil seemed like a lot, so I cut the oil in half and only used 1/2 c. The bread still came out very moist without getting gummy and heavy. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla. One other note - this bread is delicious when sliced and lightly toasted.

For those that may be alergic to nuts, any suggestions as to what to replace the nutmeg with? Thanx

Tasted very good, but took ages to bake all the way through. By the time the loaves were done, they were a bit "crispy" on the outside. If I make this again I'll bake the loaves 1 at a time and see if that works. Also added a bit of ginger to spice it up.

super easy to get together. i made 24 muffins and baked at 350 for 30 minutes. thay are delicious. i used 5 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice blend.

Made this on Saturday morning right before the in-laws came to visit - made the whole house smell wonderful. Very good. I used superfine sugar so I only used 2 1/2 cups instead of 3 cups. I might increase the amount of spice a little next time. I used the "pumpkin pie spice" instead, which is the same except for the addition of ginger. Overall a good recipe - would make nice holiday gifts.

This was absolutely delicious-it was more like a pumpkin cake than a pumpkin bread. I added Hershey's cinammon chips(about 3/4 of the whole bag) and my family and friends all demanded the recipe-tastes even better the next day!! Definitely try it-easy

This is one of the best pumpkin breads I've made. I took everyone's advice and cut the sugar to 2 cups and doubled the spices. I also added about 1 tsp. of ground ginger. I substituted 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 cup of the oil, and the bread was still moist and flavorful.

Saw the recipe last night, made it today. it was very good, my mother liked it alot. At the others' suggestions, i also used only 2 cups of sugar, doubled the spices, added nutmeg and vanilla. I also added cranberries along with the walnuts. this recipe is added onto my permanent file.

I agree with those who reduced sugar and increased spices. BTW, for years I have grown "pie" pumpkins, and instead of roasting them I just halve them and microwave them, cut side down, til done. When cool, scoop out the seeds and fibers and puree.

I have made this recipe several times. I made it again last night, but couldn't find my two loaf pans. So I poured all the batter into one smallish (8-10-cup?) bundt-style pan. I baked the bread at 350 degrees for an hour and 10 minutes, which worked fine. I, too, like to cut the sugar a bit (2-1/2 cups for me) and double the spice. Like another reviewer, I added ground ginger. I also stirred 1/4 cup Irish whiskey into my batter just before I poured it into the pan. This is a lovely bread. The walnuts add a lot, I think. (I toasted my walnuts before stirring them into the batter.)

Delicious bread. Two cups of sugar is enough. Double spices. Both family and work love this bread.

Lovely. I've made this before and made a few changes. I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup sugar as three cups is too sweet for me. Also, added ginger (because I love it!) and subsituted the oil for unsweetened apple sauce. Made four mini loaves so I can freeze for later.

i am very new to the whole baking thing, so i was somewhat apprehensive about trying a bread recipe. this was a piece of cake- literally. to call it bread is somewhat of a misnomer. i did substitute 1 tsp ginger for the nutmeg and used an additional 1/2 tsp cinnamon, the same ingredients i have used for delicious pumpkin pie. also had to use a 15 oz can of pumpkin and i have to say that one slice of this on a plate with coffee or vanilla ice cream on top makes a quick,easy and outstanding homemade dessert, while a slice in the morning with coffee or tea is a quick and satisfying breakfast. P.S. love the second loaf that you pull out of the freezer, just when everyone is lamenting because the first one is gone. TRY THIS!

This is a great pumpkin bread, moist and very fragrant with the spices. The can of pumpkin I used (Libby's) was 15 oz. and that worked out fine. Make sure your spices are fresh. If they are over a year old, they may lose their flavor.

Gee, from the reviews you'd think eating this bread would be an orgasmic experience. I kept eating pieces of it to see if it got any better. I thought it was very spicy. All those people who thought it was bland must have defective smell and tastebuds. I followed previous reviews by cutting down on the sugar, used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white, added 2oz. applesauce to make up for a 14oz. can of pumpkin. Also, I substitued 1/2 of the oil with 1/2c. buttermilk. All in all, it worked out well. Next time, I'll add walnuts and try adding pumpkin pie spice (how much, I'm not sure, though).

I looked up this recipe, as I have a pumpkin bread recipe and I wanted to compare!! Low and behold, it is the exact same recipe (mine from Creme de Colorado cookbook), except mine calls for 2 cups of sugar not 3, and adds one cup of raisins. 2 cup of sugar definately seems sweet enough for us. I use canola oil, for health benefits. Interestingly enough, mine calls for 16 oz. of pumpkin also, though a can is actually 14 oz. I have always added two oz. of apple sauce, as I ususally have that opened, as opposed to opening another can of pumkin, or using part of the larger size can. When I tried omitting the applesauce, the bread was a little too crumbly. I should add, however, that I am cooking at 8,800 feet elevation. So, I'll add to high altitude cooks, that a skimp a bit on the baking powder but leave everything else the same.

Great pumpkin bread! Took others' suggestions and used both brown and white sugar (1 and 1/4 c. of each), increased spices by 50%, and added 1 T. of molasses and 1/2 c. Craisins. Very moist and spicy, and very reminiscent of gingerbread, taste-wise. Would definitely make again!!

I followed the advice of previous reviewers and substituted apple sauce for half the oil, and 1 c. of brown sugar for one of the cups of white sugar. Other changes: I used fresh pumpkin pulp instead of canned, added a cup of cranberries, and made muffins instead of bread. (To make fresh pulp, cut a pumpkin in half, scoop out insides, and roast, open side down, on a greased cookie sheet at 325-350 until soft; 30-60 mins. depending on size; after cool, scoop out pulp and mash with a potato masher or other similar tool; cooked pulp can be frozen.) The results were good. The muffins made a great breakfast, and I gave them to people as treats to take home after Christmas dinner.

I have made this several times since Thanksgiving - and the requests are still pouring in. I follow most of the earlier suggestions; using brown sugar, more spices and less oil. I also added almonds and craisins to a batch - great! As variation, I have made mini-loaves and muffins with the same recipe.

After reading the reviews for ages, I finally tried this recipe (which I clipped when it first appeared) for Christmas, as both muffins to have at home and loaves to give away. I used 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 cup melted butter; 1 cup each white and brown sugar (3 cups would have made it inedibly sweet); and 2 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. each nutmeg. cloves, allspice and ginger. Wanting a more festive look, I iced the cooled loaves with a thick lemon juice/powdered sugar glaze. This not only looked great, but provided a nice, tangy foil fr the richness of the brown sugar and spices. Everyone loved it, so I'll definitely be doing it again, though probably with more applesauce and less butter.

This was a great recipe for pumpkin bread, but remember to read the name of this recipe. It is, indeed, very spicy. It tastes very much like a gingerbread cake, I thought. I also used applesauce in place of the oil as other reviewers suggested. It was good, but I tend to think the applesauce makes breads a bit rubbery. In my opinion, if you don't go overboard with eating this, stick with the oil. Good recipe for the holidays!

Excellent recipe. Took the advice of others and used 2 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. Substituted the oil with a cup of applesauce. No need to increase spices. It is delicious and moist.

This is some of the best bread ever, as far as I'm concerned. I've always loved my grandma's banana bread, but this is becoming my favorite ... It smells wonderful while it's baking, and it tastes even better. And it's easy to make, which makes it practically perfect. However, I use Lighter Bake (using the directions on the jar) to replace the oil, because there's so much of it, which is its only fault.

I used 1 c. each of white and brown sugars as per others' suggestions and increased spices to 1 1/2 tsp. each. I baked it for 1 hour but would probably try 5 minutes less next time. I think this was actually moister and more flavorful the next day. Next time, I'll add craisins.

Overall a good recipe. The bread was browned nicely on the outside and moist inside. I used a 15 oz. can of pack pumpkin, reduced the oil to 3/4 c., used 1 cup each of brown and white sugar as others suggested, but kept the spices consistent with the original recipe as we love to use cloves. One teaspoon didn't seem to be too much. I brought some to my relatives which received rave reviews. Perfect to make on a cold winter day!

This really is a fantastic recipe. I baked about 6 dozen giant muffins for a church bazaar, and they sold very quickly. The recipe makes about 9 giant muffins. (about 40 minutes)I took everyone's advice and decreased the sugar to one cup brown,one white. If you're pressed for time, pumpkin pie spice is a good substitute. However, if you opt for the applesauce, DON"T omit all the oil! I tried that last night and ended up with a rubbery,disgusting product that landed straight in the trash. The loaves are great to give as Xmas gifts.

Never made pumpkin bread before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. This was really good-- moist, and flavorful. Tastes like a crisp November night. Not much of a pronounced pumpkin flavor, though. I substituted applesauce (not unsweetened) for half the oil and cut the sugar down to one cup white, and one cup brown. It was still plenty sweet. And according to suggestion, I added one extra teaspoon each of nutmeg and cinnamon. Do be careful about that recommended baking time-- my loaves were done after only an hour. (I baked them in nonstick pans, which is probably why. I didn't bother to grease and flour-- just sprayed with Pam. No trouble with sticking; loaves fell right out). Served this warm with apple butter with a nice cup of strong tea. Everyone loved this one.

I have to say that I wasn't impressed with this recipe either, although it was very easy to make. No, fresh vegetable oil shouldn't impart a flavour & I think this is part of the problem. Baked goods with some butter in them do generally taste better & less bland. Perhaps I'm just not a fan of pumpkin bread but I wouldn't bother with this one again.

I've been making this recipe for years, ever since it appeared in Bon Appetit in 1995. It is very tasty, very popular, and easy to make. It is resilient too - i.e. it mails well, even to Milan! Great to make for people at the office. Great gift for teachers, secretaries, friends. It is very moist and will last a while. If you're looking for a drier bread, I'd suggest tyring a different one.

After reading the great reviews, I knew this was going to be yummy! I followed the directions to the letter--and hated the result! I guess I'm the token one to not like this at all (and I'm easy to please!) The oil was overwhelming and taste-able. The readers who used applesauce had a good idea. I'll look for another recipe that has butter (like The Joy of Cooking's recipe). I can still taste this, several hours later. I ended up throwing out both loaves (I was going to give one away, but it's not up to my usual standards). If you're thinking of making this recipe, I implore you to try the applesauce instead of the oil.

I reduced the sugar, used half brown sugar, doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg, and added currants, but kept the full amount of oil. I didn't even wait for the bread to cool before I ate a slice. It was everything the other readers said and more. This goes in the "favorite" section of my cookbook.

This recipie is awesome! I added cranberries instead of the nuts because I have a severe allergy to the nuts and I substituted 1 cup of dark brown sugar for one cup of the white sugar and it was great! I wouldn't hesitate to make this again!

This pumpkin bread is just marvelous. I prepared it for a neighborhood party just last weekend and received rave reviews. I enjoy the recipe the way it reads but for a real zip I substitute pecans for the walnuts and add 1 cup fresh cranberries. It is not only tasty but festive looking as well.

I was hesitant in trying this bread since I only like baking with real butter. Since this recipe was well rated, I decided to give it a try. Well, it turned out great and received great compliments. The bread even tastes better wrapped well in plastic wrap, allowing to sit for a whole day. Instead of using 1 tsp. cloves, I used 1/2 tsp. cloves and 1/2 tsp. ginger. Confession: I screwed up the first time I tried the recipe accidentally using a 29-oz. can pumpkin instead of a 16-oz. can.

I was very pleasantly surprised at how nice these loaves turned out. I substituted 1/4 cup of applesauce for 1/4 cup of oil and did not feel it compromised the recipe in any way.

Very good. Nice crunchy crust and moist inside. Make this when expecting company as it makes the whole house smell heavenly! Next time I think I'll try adding cranberries for some zip.

I followed the many suggestions for less sugar, applesauce, cranberries, more spices...it was very moist and dense with great flavor. I thought that the baking time seemed long but it does take that long. I made one loaf in a bundt loaf pan which turned out really well.

Substituted unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 of the oil & used 1 cup white/1 cup brown sugar -- turned out great. Might cut down the cloves a little next time & add some ginger. Would be good as small gift loaves.

This was the easiest recipe and tastes delicious! Everyone in the house wants me to make it again! I cut each ingredient in half because I only wanted to try one loaf and it turned out great! Thanks!

This was my first time making pumpkin bread but it definitely won't be my last. The loaves turned out beautifully. According to suggestion, I used just 2 cups sugar (one white, one brown) and replaced 3/4ths of the oil with unsweetened apple sauce. I used ginger instead of cloves as I did not have these on hand. Wonderful!

I had to try this bread after so many wonderful reviews. I got three perfect loaves as I used slightly smaller pans. I did add extra spices and used 3/4 cup oil instead of a full cup. I omitted the nuts and used dried cranberiies. What a fabulous bread. It tasted just the way pumpkin bread should, moist inside and crisp on top.

I'm not a pumpkin fan, however, this was an excellent recipe. Soft in the center and a crunchy crust.

This is an incredible recipe. It's moist, spicy, and bakes up nice and firm. It would make a great "gift from your kitchen" at Christmas - or any holiday.

WONDERFUL!!! There is no need to look for another pumpkin bread recipe. This has all of the qualities I was looking for in a holiday bread...moist, crunchy top, not too sweet, great holiday flavors/spices and great for anything from breakfast to an after-dinner dessert with coffee. I will recommend this recipe for years to come.

I had never made a pumpkin bread before, and I absolutely loved this bread, I followed the instructions to the letter, and voila! the most wonderful pumpkin bread ever. I applied many of the suggestions made by other cooks,i.e reduced sugar, and added more spice, and it worked out great, nice texture and moist. My husband and my 29 month old son loved it (hubby is not a baked goods fan) they couldn't get enough, I will defenately make it again. the best part was my son telling me Yum, Yum Mommy!

Rating: 4
Excellent and easy. I made it w/ the applesauce and used Pumpkin Pie Spice, Cinnamon and Ginger, plus a cup of Craisins. Very tasty but quite sweet. When I make it next time - and I will, I'll reduce the sugar. This recipe is a keeper. It also toasts very well.

Amazing delicious cake! I took it to work with me for a treat and it disappeared...I used half the sugar and half the oil...increased the pumpkin a little to compensate, and used egg substitute instead of whole eggs and it was great:)

turned out great! i omitted the nuts and cloves and used all 3 cups of sugar and one whole cup of oil! delicious! not too sweet at all, and if i was trying to cut out the fat, i'd eat an apple...

I love this recipe! Today I made 8 loaves of the bread to give as holiday gifts. Thanks to other cooks' comments, I reduce the sugar to 2C and increase the spices by nearly double. I use a mix of walnuts and pecans for the nuts.

Rating: 4
Like many of the other bakers, I reduced the amount of sugar and adjusted the spices to accommodate our household tastes. I also substituted semi-sweet mini-chocolate chips (for maximum chocolate distribution!). Chocolate and pumpkin sounds like a bizarre combo, but I've used them together for years with great success. This is definitely a make-again recipe!

I have used this recipe for many years and will continue. Glad to find it in here as my hand written copy is worn out. Great recipe to divide into mini loaf pans and bake to give as gifts for Christmas or anytime. You can get 6-8 loaves out of the recipe.

I made this bread for a winter party and served it with the fruit and cheese. It worked well with the food and everyone asked me for the recipe. I had some apple butter on hand which I added (I think two or three tablespoons) to the batter -- that worked well.

I love this recipe!! I have made it twice with rave reviews. My husband normally can't stand anything "pumpkin", but he loves this bread. It's very moist, almost cake-like. The second time I made it I cut the loaf into finger sandwiches and put whipped cream cheese in between--YUMMY!! They were all gone by the end of the day.

This pumpkin bread impressed everyone this Thanksgiving. In fact, both loaves were completely consumed before the pumpkin pie was even presented! Luckily, I read the reviews before baking the bread. I also cut down the sugar to 1 cup of white and 1 cup of brown and added a large drizzle of vanilla. YUM!

I thought this recipe was great. I did substitute unsweetened applesauce for the oil, which worked out very well. And I only used 2 cups of sugar instead of three. I was leery about the applesauce effecting the moistness, but I couldn't believe how moist it was. I would make this again.

I substituted 1 container of Yoplait (peach flavor, it was all I had in the fridge) and 1/3 C oil for the WHOLE CUP (!) of oil called for, and 1 C of white and 1 C of dark brown sugar for the 3 CUPS (!) of white sugar called for. Oh, yeah--instead of pumpkin I used mashed leftover roasted sweet potato that we had yesterday. The result is yummy.

i baked it in 4 small loaf pans for 30-35 min; sub the following ingredients--1 c vanilla yogurt+ 1/4 veg oil for 1 c.oil; 1 c.brown sug for 1 c.of gran sugar plus scant 2 c. of gran sugar plus doubled the spices.

i used 2 C. turbinado sugar and would consider cutting it down to just under 2 C. (because it was still a little too sweet for my taste), the 1/2 C. crystallized ginger, and 1/2 C. "lighter bake" or 1 C. unsweetened applesauce. it was scrumptious!

Rating: 4
GREAT recipe! I've made it about 20 times and everyone raves about it!! The only change I made was using 2 cups regular sugar and 1 cup light brown sugar. It gave it a little more texture. It's very easy to make and delicious! And I didn't even use the nuts...

Recepie was good. Could have been a tad less oil and maybe some brown sugar and some vanilla.

Rating: 3
This is a great recipe! I tried it once using the 3 cups of sugar and found it too sweet, so the next time I made it I cut it back to 2 cups and that was just right. I also substituted 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce for the 1 cup of oil to reduce the fat, and it was just as moist as with the oil. Using the applesauce instead of the oil makes this recipe virtually fat free (unless you add the walnuts). I thought the mix of spices was just right, too.

This recipe helped me get started, but I made a few changes - only 2 cups of sugar and 2 1/2 cups flour. I doubled the spices, and added a 1/2 cup of crystalized ginger. The resulting muffins were fantastic - good flavor and very tender.

I thought it was quite good, but I made a few changes: I substituted butter for vegetable oil, and used half white sugar and half brown sugar. I also used a bit of vanilla. The one problem I had was the bread kind of fell apart when I cut it, but my guests really enjoyed it.

I turned the recipe into muffins and everyone loved it. The only thing I would change is to turn up the volume on the spices.

My husband LOVED this! My suggestion would be to decrease the sugar from 3 cups to 2 cups though as it was a little sweet for me. My decreasing the sugar, you can sprinkle a little bit of sugar on top of the batter prior to baking. I also used the batter to make it into muffins.

This was a terrific recipe! I used my Halloween pumpkins that I'd cooked and pureed instead of canned pumpkin. It was still wonderful. I loved that it was so moist and spicy. I had to bake it a little over 80 minutes, but that is because of the altitude at which I live. In a nutshell YUMMA!!

I made this recipe this week and found it to be delicious. I think I would try to use applesauce to cut down on oil due to a cholesterol problem. My family loved it so I'll make them as gifts for friends and neighbors. Keep up the good work.

I have not tried this recipe, but have one very similar. Instead of cutting down on the sugar, try using 1-1/2 cups of granulated sugar and 1-1/2 cups of light brown sugar. It's not quite as sweet.

In response to the New York cook: the first time I made this I thot it was good but certainly not great. I have made it 2 more times and now think it's wonderful!

I agree with all the other reviews that this was a really moist, and easy to make delicious cake-bread. However, for those of you who are counting pre-holiday calories, I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil and the recipe still tasted very good and was very moist. I think the next time I make this, I will cut down the sugar to two cups. I'm making this for everyone at the office this year!

This is my favorite fall recipe. I run a personal chef service and this is what I make for a little something extra for my clients this time of year. They all love it. Beware though: it's so good people will be asking you to sell it to them. I don't change anything, but would like to lighten it up a bit. I do add walnuts to the top only and gently press them in before baking. Today I made 2 double batches of it. My mixer can only handle 2 batches at a time. I had so much batter that I used the extra in muffin tins, which worked out. This stuff is truly addictive. I have also served it as a dessert: warm a piece in microwave, serve with vanilla ice cream with a good apple butter over it. Awesome!!

While the flavor of this recipe is good, I was looking for a recipe that offered a more course texture. This is more like a pumpkin pound cake - I like these sweet breads served with cream cheese so will continue to search this great site for a more dense, crumbly type bread.

The bread had a very smooth texture abd even consistancy. I added some raisins, rather than the nuts which added some additional sweetness. Spread with "Pumpkin Butter" finished it off to a delectable snack with a hot cup of tea or Mulled apple cider! The kids loved it, and it is a nutritional after school snack, and lunch box treat.
