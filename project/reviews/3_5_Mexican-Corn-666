So easy and delicious. I only put in half the jala for the toddler's benefit, but she ran screaming when she saw the red bell pepp. Next time the whole thing goes in! Will make it again next week for my mom & pop.

Made this the other night. I was out of cilantro so I substituted ground cumin and coriander. I also added edemame and lime for a kind of Mexican succotash. It was delicious.

Made with corn from garden my father froze for me over summer. Omitted Zucchini (hubby does not like) sub. with green bell pepper and added 1/2 cup onion--omitted jalapeno because I used HOT salsa--GREAT! I used it on top of tacos, could see eating it as a side dish....Wow.

3.5 forks - good as written; not the most elegant dish in the book but quite tasty, healthy.

I just wanted to add that this has become a staple in our house. It's so simple that it's almost cheesy, but we love it. It's perfect with the carne asada with grilled poblanos from this site (which is also very simple and very delicious). Also, it's relatively healthy and low-fat. You should really try this!

Yum! Easy to prep ahead. I added only about a third of the jalepeno, and found that a little too spicy so add slowly!!

Good taste, added a squeeze of lime to brighten the taste. Not all that attractive looking, I used Jarred salsa, maybe fresh salsa would give better colour.

My boyfriend and I liked this recipe, and I thought that it was very easy. There's a fair amount of chopping involved, but that could be done ahead of time if you wanted to prep for dinner. I wanted to use fresh salsa, but Whole Foods was out. The jarred salsa worked okay, though. The jalepeno does add a good bit of heat, so if you don't like spice, I would suggest adding it gradually. Also, the veggies take more than 6 minutes to cook. I think you need to at least double that amount of time. Overall, a good weeknight side and a nice side to go with Mexican dishes.

A delicious way to serve vegetables. Even the 4 year old gobbled them up!

Tasty, and a colorful addition to a taco salad buffet. Doubled the salsa and used fresh medium.

OK - but not worth the trouble.

Great dish! I added two medium-sized chopped tomatoes and a bunch of sliced asparagus in when I added the zucchini. Unbelievable! This dish got my family eating vegetables and asking for more!

I served this dish as a cold salad for a barbeque and thus substituted vegetable oil for the butter to avoid coagulation. Also followed the suggestion from another poster to use fresh salsa (Whole Foods), which negated the need to add cilantro. Nice, colorful presentation served in a clear bowl. Complements a wide array of grilled foods well. Yum!

This was a fun and fairly easy side dish that was much more interesting than refried beans. I served it with beef enchiladas. I added some black beans which made it a bit more comfortable. I, too, used a fresh local salsa rather than a bottled version. It was good, but not an "oh my goodness" recipe.

As others have said, this is a very nice complement to all of the heavy Mexican food. Very nice looking dish and delicious!

Delicious! Easy to make and beautiful to look at. The perfect accompaniment for filling Mexican fare like enchalidas and an excellent addition to the summer barbeque. Don't compromise quality with a JAR of salsa if you have access to fresh in the deli. I used Bird's Eye baby gold & white corn - the two colors were wonderful, added fresh lemon juice and lemon pepper to taste and elminated the cilantro - which I think tastes like soap - tho' I did use sprigs of it as a garnish for the presentation. The KEY for me was to saute'the vegetables in a small amount of extra virgin olive oil using only enough butter to enhance flavor. This dish does well as a cold salad, too, (with the addition of the lemon juice) but then virtually eliminate the butter as it will come off as hard and greasy. Hot or cold this dish travels well.

I made this as my contribution to a Mexican pot luck and got great reviews. People enjoyed having a nice veggie dish to go with all the heavy cheese and tortilla dishes.

Super-yum! For those of you who live in Northern California, I used Casa Sanchez mild salsa (in the refridgerated section) - it has cilantro in it, so I didn't add any more. Great flavor from an unexpected combination!

Left out the cilantro, as I do not like it. Not the most attractive dish, but very tasty. Spouse and kid liked it also.

YUM. Not the kind of thing you'd likely serve to company (at least not for a fancy dinner) but darned tasty and easy. Like some previous posters, I wasn't sure the salsa was going to work, but it was wonderful. I'm sure it would be great without it too, though, if you feel unsure. Also, I left out the red pepper and it was still wonderful.

PERFECT addition to Mexican meal!

I too was hesitant about the prepared salsa, but this recipe was TASTY! Went very well with my Mexican-themed dinner. Only used half the jalepeno- and it still had a strong kick to it. Yummy, though I wouldn't use more.

I have made this dish twice, and both times it came out perfectly with everyone really enjoying the flavors and colorful presentation of the dish. I followed some of the suggestions in prior reviews, cutting back the amount of butter to 2 tablespoons for sauteing. I really hesitated to use bottled salsa, but experimented and used Pace with a mixture of 1/2 mild and 1/2 medium and it had a really good flavor to it...just the right blend. This recipe had just the right bite for my husband who likes things on the spicy side. When having the dish for company, I did cut back just a tiny bit on the jalapeno and it appealed everyone. Really a winner!

I made this for a dinner party and served it with Beef Tenderloins in Chili Sauce and mashed potatoes. It was excellent. Colorful and delicious. I will be making it again and again.

Absolutely delicious and very colorful...and very Mexican. Went great with Oven Fried Chipotle Chili Chicken! Will definitely make again and again. Follow the recipe...make no changes!

I make a similar recipe to this and the best part is using roasted corn and oil unstead of butter. Yummers!

Thought this would be great, but neither myself nor my husband particularly cared for it at all. Can't quite put my finger on why -- something was just off flavorwise.

This dish was very easy and quick to make and tasted great. I was lucky enough to have some home-made salsa on hand which made the dish even better. I made it for Christmas Eve and it all went.

Made this for the first time and took it to a potluck. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I've made it again and got the same reaction. I know I'll be making this again in the future. Very good and easy to make, too!

Pardon the expression -- but this dish kicked ass! I served it at a "Girls' Night Dinner Party" and it was devoured. So easy to make, I plan on making it again very soon. This one is a keeper for sure.

Great flavor and very colorful. Good for BBQs which have a lot of different items. This one will stand out, but not overpower your main dishes. Definitely a conversation piece!

FANTASTIC. I completely left out the butter and just used a little non-stick spray on the pan. I used a garlic and lime salsa by Pace (I think that's who made it), and it was spicy and so flavorful. A good way to sneak in some zucchini into dinner if your family normally doesn't like zucchini. I made this along with the chicken enchiladas from this website, and my husband and I loved it all.

Very easy. It was a nice different way to serve corn. My husband really liked it as well.

The taste was excellent and it was easy to prepare. The flavors blended well and the ingredients made for a very colorful side dish. The only thing I will change next time around will be to cut back on the butter. Three tablespoons of butter are not necessary, as it seems to overpower the natural flavor of the vegetables.

This is much better than I thought it would be. The flavors and textures blend very nicely. A nice side dish for grilled meats.

This is a great recipe! So easy, I was suspicious that it would be tasteless - especially with the addition of the store bought salsa, but it is wonderfully full of flavor. My whole family heaped up their plates!

This recipe rocks! I first made it for a gourmet club Mexican themed dinner, and was feeling bad for the lack of complication. It turned out delicious and was the hit of the dinner! I sometimes add black beans to the leftovers and pack it for lunch. It also makes a great filling in a tortilla with beans or chicken.

Great for crowds or just regular dinner. Make a large batch and freeze in dinner portions. May substitute peas for zucchini. Teenagers love it! You will make this many times. A real keeper!

Good flavor, just the right amount of heat. Recipe says serves 4, and that it does... very generous portions, you could easily serve 8 as a side-dish.

I've made this recipe several times and I keep losing it and searching for it on the net every so often. I'm not losing it again! This recipe is very tasty, with a good bite! I first made it with Mexican food, but today I'm making it with mariated steak and chicken. We're eating alfresco and the day is perfect! A great recipe to go with great food and friends.

well blended flavors. I used half medium and half mild Pace Picante Sauce
