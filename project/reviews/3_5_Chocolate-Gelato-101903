Have to say, we used the full measure of cocoa powder and thought it was fantastic. It's definitely more Italian than American, meaning much less sweet, but definitely a deeper flavor and worth trying with the full hit.

Don't get me wrong, I love good dark chocolate, but the amount of cocoa powder gives it an incredibly chalky texture. I would try halving or quartering the cocoa powder and doubling the chocolate.

This gelato is delicious - it just needs more sugar. I love a good dark chocolate gelato, and I don't think super-sweetness is necessary, but I tasted the mix before putting it in the freezer and it was like eating an 85% chocolate bar. I added another 3 T sugar and that did the trick - a hint of sweet in a whole lot of dark chocolatey goodness. I also skipped the bowl of ice water step - too messy/too complicated. I just stuck the mixture in the freezer uncovered for 30 min after cooking and then put it in my ice cream maker and it came out great.

I made a new friend with this ice cream: I experimented with Rice Dream instead of milk, and Tofutti cream cheese instead of cream, for a lactose-intolerant colleague. We were all amazed. The extra-fudgy quality was a plus.

The gelato was creamy with a very rich smooth chocolate taste. It was a hit with our guests. I followed the advice of previous reviewers and reduced the cocoa (to 1/3 cup) and only used 2/3 cup of sugar. This will definitely become a household favorite (particularly since my wife is a chocoholic).

This was my first effort at gelato, and it was a great success. I thought the flavor was great, but my sweetheart would have liked it a wee bit sweeter. I thought it was plenty sweet as is.

As stated by some others, this recipe if followed exactly, can be 'too chocolaty'. I am an avowed Chocoholic and have cut back the cocoa by 25% with good results. Less tiring on the palate means you can eat more of it longer!

I'm posting to ask if I could make this recipe (or another chocolate ice cream-like recipe) without an ice cream maker. Could I just freeze it in my freezer? I'm not a chef and I'm probably not very particular about the quality compared to most people. I just don't know if it would work at all. Thanks in advance for any advice.

I have been making this recipe since 1999. It is about the best choclate gelato/ice cream that me and my wife have ever had, and everyone that has tried it has loved it. Two notes of caution: 1. Measure the cocoa exactly, a bit more and it becomes gritty. 2. It stains, and is hard if not impossible to get out of clothes.

Most of the reviewers complained about the overpowering cocoa so I cut down cocoa to 2T. Even with just 2T it tasted just a tad powdery but will stick to 2T. Regardless, gelato turned out excellent!

I have made this recipe several times and here's my tips: Use about 2 tablespoons instead of 1 cup of cocoa powder as it is WAY too overpowering. Also, mix only 1/4 cup of sugar in the saucepan and 1/2 cup of sugar with the egg yolks. This really stiffened them up and gave the ice cream a much better texture. The time I did this, the ice cream felt more like "real" gelato. I don't know if that was the reason or not, but the end result was much better. Lastly, skip the taking out of two tablespoons of sugar. It's ice cream, it's fattening and it's supposed to taste sweet. Go nuts; you only get one trip on this planet...

GREAT recipe...i used scharffen berger choclate and cocoa powder and have a simac ice cream maker...i cut the cocoa powder in half the second time i made it and i think it was as good if not better than the original...this is creamy and incredibly tasty, for a slight twist add chocolate chip cookie dough chunks about 3/4 way through the freezing process...enjoy!

This gelato has a deep, rich chocolate flavor that was similar to chocolate gelato I had recently in Florence, Italy (try "Vivoli"...best gelato in Florence). However, I can't seem to duplicate the soft, velvety texture of Italian gelato...my gelato still tastes pretty much like American ice cream. Perhaps it's my ice cream maker not being up to par. This is a good recipe, though.

This was exquisite! Definite chocolate flavor! Don't know what the previous reviewer expected, vanilla perhaps....

i tried this recipie, and i think that it uses way too much cocoa powder. it overwhelms everything else, and all you taste is frozen cocoa powder. i will try this recipie again, but with half as much cocoa powder.
