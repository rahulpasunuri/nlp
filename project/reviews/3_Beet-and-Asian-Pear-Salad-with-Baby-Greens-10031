This was a very pretty salad but could use some modification. I made this two different times and both times,doubled the recipe. The first time, I tripled the dressing and had just enough for the pears and beets. The second time I made this,I quadrupled the dressing, and decreased the dijon mustard by 2t. I added lime juice (2T. more)instead of lemon and also added salt and pepper. I also took a portion of the dressing and whisked a little oil in and dressed the greens on the plate, drizzling the "un-oiled" over fanned pears and beets(beets between each pear). This ended up being better, as the first time, we ended up eating dry greens due to the scant amount of dressing.

We're big salad eaters and iked this salad, but thought the beet and pear wedges were too heavy for the delicate spring greens. Next time I make this (and I will), I'll julienne the beets and pear. We substituted home made peach freezer jam (it's what was on hand) in the dressing and it was delicious!

Easy and tasty, but not nearly as good as I'd hoped. Next time I'll double the dressing, as I could hardly taste it in the final product.

The dressing is really good when using apricot jam. Many uses besides this nice dish.

This was easy to make and very tasty. It had a nice blend of flavors and textures. Enjoyed by our guests, and I would make it again.

quick, easy and simple with a nice blend of sweet and tangy. I had extra beets/pears and had them by themselves as a snack afterwards....a great blend - although it sounds more impressive than it really is.....
