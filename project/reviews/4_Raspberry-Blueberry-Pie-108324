What a disappointment! I substituted blackberries for raspberries but followed the recipe exactly otherwise. Came out watery and flavorless. The crust was great, however. I'm not a baker so I have to assume operator error, especially with all these other glowing reviews. Will try again someday!

I made this pie during the summer for my step-dad's 50th birthday and should have made more. I barely managed to get a slice myself as it dissapeared so quickly. It turned out absolutely amazing

Excellent! Great with ice cream. Delicious, flaky crust.

I recently made this pie in hopes of impressing possible future relatives of mine. It was a BIG hit! Since blueberries are almost out of season, I substituted blackberries, which worked very well. I liked the flavor that the creme de cassis added (I know some people have not), but would considering using limoncello in its place next time for a different twist.

By far, the best pie I have ever made! It got rave reviews from everyone. I used lemon juice instead of the liqueur, and made the dough in food processor using "pulse" to combine. Other than that, followed the recipe to the letter. Fabulous pie!! And, easy to make.

I made this pie for a summer gathering and everyone loved it. They want to know when I'm making it again. Takes a little planning ahead, but well worth it!

The cassis was a little overpowering to the flavours of blueberry and raspberry. Next time I'd use only a tablespoon instead of a quarter cup.

This pie was loved by all. Simple to make and delicious. I substituted lemon juice for the creme de cassis, and it was excellent. The crust recipe is unique; I would definitely make it again.

Absolutely delicious! Am not usually a big fan of blueberry pie as I enjoy the tartness of a sour cherry or a rhubarb pie. The combination of raspberry/blueberry was just to my liking. To ensure the filling wouldn't be too runny, I folded in with the fruit mixture: 1 egg white and 2 tablespoons sugar, beat until stiff. Our guests raved over this pie, as did my husband. This recipe is a definite keeper!

GREAT pie. I didn't have the liqueur, and could only think to use a bit of lemon juice to accentuate the berries, so I made that substitution. I also spilled the tapioca, and could only rescue 1/2 of the specified 1/3 cup, so added cornstarch to remaining tapioca to make up the 1/3 cup. All this, and the pie was still the hit of the BBQ last night. This is a good looking, good tasting, oh-so-easy to make pie. I will definately be adding this recipe to my summer repertorie. Serve with a dab of homemade vanilla or lemon ice-cream...mmmm...heaven!

I baked this pie for my inlaws and they loved it! Now I'm known as the best pie maker in the family!

Outstanding. The crust is exceptionally flaky - the sour cream must be the secret. Definitely a keeper!!!

Wonderful pie. I didn't have Cassis but used Parfait Amour, which is a lavender flavored liquor. Also added a nectarine because I didn't have enough blueberries. My husband is still raving about it. Another one in the oven right now!

Great! I made it with more berries and proportionately more filling ingredients and it turned out awesome. I'm not a crust specialist and this one was easier to handle than others.

Though US weights were a little different to use, this pie came out perfect and tasted delicious! My mum and auntie both made me print this recipe off for them :D

This is the best pie I've ever had or made! I'm new to pie-baking and all three times I've made this pie, the crust has turned out perfectly. My dinner guests have been asking me for the recipe all summer.

This pie was a HUGE hit with my family. At our house, pies usually stick around for a few days. This one was gone the first day! The crust is a perfect match with the berries.

This pie was wonderful! I didn't have enough raspberries and substituted blackberries to make up the difference. It was delicious. The crust was very flakey and the tapioca made the filling just the right consistency.
