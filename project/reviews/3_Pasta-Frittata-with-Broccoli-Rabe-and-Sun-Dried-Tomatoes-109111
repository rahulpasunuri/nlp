Easy and tasty. I modified the recipe to 1 serving and substituted peeled and chopped broccoli stem for the rabe.

Wonderful and simple. I would, however, make the following changes. It needs more salt. Also, I would triple the amount of sundried tomatoes. Finally, I would sautee some garlic in the olive oil prior to adding the pasta and rabe. These changes take a good dish to the next level. Serve with salad and a good custy bread with some sesame seeds. Ciao!

The recipe is a good guide, and it is a nice homestyle dish. I made it with kale and that worked out nicely. A bit bland overall-- I would add more sundried tomatoes, some fresh herbs, some flavorful cheese (like pecorino, and not much), and cut down the pasta to 1/4 or 1/3 lb. Otherwise tasty and EASY.

This has become a staple of mine. I make it often for dinner for two with salad, or double it for large brunch parties. I have made it over 10 times and get rave reviews each time.

Doubled this recipe for company. First frittata was a little dry. Second one I added another egg,for 7 total, and it was great. I really didn't have to change the cheese, as I was generous to begin with. This is great for an Appetizer dinner with friends.

This recipe just didn't work for me. I started with 4 eggs and 1/4 pound of pasta and when I saw how dry it was I even added 2 more eggs. I had assumed this would be an omlette-like dish with pasta and the broccoli in the egg custard. But instead it came out like a set spaghetti carbonara. I like the ingredients but the proportions are just off for me.

This was a great weeknight supper -- quick and easy to prepare. Serve with mesculun greens and some breadsticks, and it is a winner. Also great for a brunch dish. I used about 6 or 7 sundried tomatoes, because we like them a lot, -- seemed like just two weren't enough. Next time, i will saute some onion to add as well. I used a mixture of shredded mozzarella and the parmesan cheese. Will definitely make this again.

Iagree with the cook from Italy. All kinds of frittata were traditional in my family until eggs became a no no. And we never placed the frittata in the oven, it was done on the stove, and I still do it on the stove. I also make macaroni pie from leftover pasta. Add 2 beaten eggs and 1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese and add to hot oiled skillet. Brown on one side. Flip over and brown on other side. Excellent. This is best made with spaghetti.

A variation of a very traditional dish and except for the milk which we generally do not use, it is very 'Italian' correct. Also, generally speaking, we do it as a real frittata, that is in a skillet on the stove top turning it once with the help of a lid or a plate. Traditionally it was also done with any kind of left over pasta. I just love it
