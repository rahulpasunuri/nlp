I thought this recipe did not taste very good. Made as written.

What makes this such a great dish is its simplicity - as you can tell by everyone's reviews, you can put any flavor spin you want on it. The technique makes it a healthful and easy keeper!

Easy go-to weeknight recipe. Can't believe other reviewers hated it...can only say that if you use fresh, never frozen fish it's a winner. I use fresh halibut in this recipe with extra garlic and follow the recipe otherwise. Sometimes add green beans if I have them. Or red onion. Point is, with so few ingredients you have to use good quality products because there's nothing to hide from. If you use frozen fish, it's going to taste like it. Add spice or peppers for a kick, like other reviewers. Be bold and enjoy!

I thought is quite good, not excellent but healthy, lots of vegetables and cooking in one skillet. I will make again, Yes you can tweak with it, maybe next time some coriander seeds or chili but that is the mark of a good recipe I think, you make it your own. Good for a weeknight.

I thought this was OK, especially served over couscous. But my husband thought it was vile, and he's not a picky eater. He pushed it around the plate.

Not bad - quick to prepare and makes a nice week night meal. I used flounder just because we had not had that in a while. We prefer a bit more zip in a dish, so if we make again I would use shallots and a wider selection of fresh herbs.

I followed others' tips: added green olives,pinch of red pepper flakes. Also added about 1/2t Anchovy paste. Excellent and easy.

I made this for a large crowd, so I cooked it in a large pot instead of a skillet. I used lots of garlic, red onions, carrots, celery, tons of zucchini and fresh oregano. Cooked this all very slowly, allowing the vegetables to get pretty "mushy." I used a can of the diced tomatoes and used just about all of the juice in there. Stacked the tilapia over the top, and just let it all cook. I served this with a warm baby red potato salad with red onions and a dijon vinagrette. The next day, those leftover vegetables were awesome with the leftover potatoes. I know that they say that you can't please all of the people, but I definitely did with this recipe. Very Mediterranean and really fantastic with a light white wine. I will make this on a regular basis for the rest of my life.

This was absolutely delicious! My 15 year old son and I just couldn't get enough. I followed the recipe exactly. I will make this often as it is super easy, not hard to find ingredients, and fast!

So quick, easy, and healthy for a weeknight dinner. I used tilapia for the fish, fresh local zucchini, and added capers like someone suggested below. Yum!

I am an amateur cook (meaning i can cook desserts, breakfast, and make jam), and I loved this recipe. It was so easy to follow...my father doesn't eat salt so I left it out and it was so flavorful regardless. I might suggest using lemon in the sauce at the end instead of salt perhaps. It smelled good even while I was making it and now that I'm eating it I can't believe I made this! It didn't take a long time or a lot of complicated steps. :)

What a great dish. Used Mahi-mahi and added mushrooms. Will probably add parmesan cheese at the end next time.

I'd been craving summery fish dishes that call for fresh tomatoes, but those are impossible to get this time of year. The canned tomatoes here are a great option for the winter: adding a few capers and some red pepper flakes at the end kept the flavor fresh and bright. This is a definite keeper: SO quick, easy, tasty--and healthy too.

Easy easy easy! Flavorful and good for you! I make this often when I don't have a ton of time to cook dinner. My husband loves it too!

Great dish but needed more kick, so added cilantro, jalapenos, and red pepper flakes. Have also made it with zucchini and squash and fresh mushrooms to change it up a bit, but great base from which to work.

Great recipe and pretty easy. I made if for dinner and my husband loved it.

I made this last night using Tilapia fish and substituted green beans for the zucchini. I served this dish with a side of pasta (seasoned with olive oil, salt, pepper and Parmesan) This recipe is a keeper- this was delicious!!!

Tasty and easy one pot fish dinner. My girls (5 and 9) want me to make it again!

I liked this but didn't think it was amazing. But it was sooo easy. Next time I'll try the capers and I bet it will be really awesome.

Easy to make, healthy and flavorful. Served it with rice pilaf. Will add this recipe to my repetoire.

This was very good. I didn't have any zukes so I substituted fresh corn, cut off the cob. The fish I used was Talapia, which worked great.

Great for lovers of light fish dishes. I served it over bowtie pasta for a simple one dish dinner. A good chardonnay compliments this dish.

We love this recipe in our home. We often have left over sauce and have used it to toss with cheese tortellini and in creole shrimp. This has become a regular dish in our house. Very flavorful!

Easy to prepare and cook. Flavorful for other types of firm white fish. Would certainly make it again.

Absolutely delicious. I did, however, use Cavender's Greek Seasoning to taste and sprinkled the dish with freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano to "kick it up a notch".

This was a simple, yet surprisingly flavorful dish. My husband loved it, and he hasn't been nuts about my new, lighter cooking style!

I bought this fabulous heavy grille pan from Williams Sonoma and cooked the zucchini over high heat until really brown (obviously this means you must wait to add the garlic until the end). And then really boil the juices down. This recipe is heaven and I don't much care for fish.

Enjoyed this dish last night. Used fresh oregano and some basil and zuccini from the garden. Substituted with a can of crushed tomatoes. Was terrific.

This was a great recipe. I made it with Orange Roughy (Spelling?) and used salsa in place of the tomatoes. My wife is not a big fish eater but she said that she loved it.

This was AWESOME! Who knew you could do this to fish without making it bad for your health? I combined the previous two variations -- asparagus and salsa instead of squash and tomatoes. It was fast, easy AND EXCELLENT!

I made this dish with yellow crookneck squash, instead of the zucchini, and I used salsa instead of the stewed tomatoes. EXCELLENT!
