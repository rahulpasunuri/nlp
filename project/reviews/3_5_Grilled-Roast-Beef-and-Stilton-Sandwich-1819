I made this with leftover ribroast and ingredients on hand and it was just great! I started grilling on a panini the bread, then applied to the open face a gorgonzola dolce-horseradish-sour cream blend, piled on thinly-sliced beef topped with leftover gravy, then sliced red onions, then mesclun. I then put the 2 faces together to make the sandwich. Washed it down with leftover vino. Life is good!

I'm giving this 2 forks instead of 1 only because it has potential. I love blue cheese, really I do. But this is overwhelming. You can't taste anything else. I would increase the roast beef and decrease the blue cheese for sure. If I was feeling cheeky I might add some sliced pears. Then we might have something worth 3 or even 4 forks. But as written, it's a generous 2 forks.

Did a soup/sandwich around the fire dinner party. This was awful. Even made homemade mayo for the party and the cheese was so overpowering, it was all you could taste of the sandwich. Would try it again with maybe a great English cheddar and flavor the mayo with herbs.

Tried duing 9 of them in a 400 pre-heated oven. About 4 min on 1 side & 4 on the other.o Excellent! Only way to do "grilled sandwiches" for a bunch. Crusty. Sooo good! Even for just a plain old grilled cheese. Yum!!!

We LOVE this sandwich. I make them exactly as the recipe says and they are heartily devoured by family and guests. So easy and such a great blend of flavors. YUM!

I used less meat, ciabatta rolls, and bleu cheese, plus added a tomato and pressed the sandwiches in a grill with a top. They were very hearty and filling. I could hardly taste the roast beef since the cheese predominates. Luckily I love bleu, gorgonzola and Stilton. Next time I'd use thinner bread if I reduce the amount of meat.

very tasty! Like a pub style sandwich.

I loved this sandwich, especially since its ingredients are items I usually have on hand. This sandwich is a man-pleaser, filling and hearty with bold flavor. I used mesculun greens instead of arugula, Amish blue cheese instead of the Stilton, and for the beef I used smoked brisket, thinly sliced. This sandwich will be a regular in our household when I have leftover beef.

for a party double the recipe and bake at 400 degrees for 10 minutes, flip and bake 5 more minutes. Cut in half or thirds as it is very delicious and rich.

I have been making this for years for parties doubled. Rather than grilling, I bake it at 400 degrees for 10 minutes, flip and bake another 5 minutes. I use a black teflon pan, and it browns nicely. The cheese is melted nicely, I cut some of the sandwiches in half and some in thirds as it is very rich and good.

This recipe is great. For those of us who don't like mayonnaise though, sour cream works really well in the spread. i did 1 oz of stilton with 1 tbsp of sour cream, and 1 tsp of prepared horseradish. It turned out great. I will definitely make this again, although next time i will try it with home-made roast, maybe for leftovers the next day.

YUM! I made this last night for a small get-together along with soup and salad. I doubled it, so I put the sandwiches under the broiler. It got rave reviews! Next time, and there will be a next time, I will add more horseradish - I couldn't really taste it.

Really tasty sandwich, makes a great lunch. In an attempt to cut down on the calories, I used a bit less roast beef than stated.

Great flavor - nice twist on a grilled cheese sandwich! Yummy, we'll definitely be having this dish again.

Absolutely great and easy to prepare. Works with light rye bread too. Using the thinnest setting on a "cheap mandolin" kept the onions under control. And don't shortchange yourself by not grilling--the melted cheese and crunchy bread work really well. This is a keeper!

My sister-in-law has a problem eating raw onions and she suggested we grill the onions. Fabulous! I made this again the next night with the leftovers and added more horseradish. Even better!

This is a tasty and different way to serve roast beef. We enjoyed it last weekend at a friends house for lunch and I insisted on the recipie. A big hit in my home.

I served this for a New Years Day Rose Bowl party. It was very tasty. I have made it several times since just for us. It is easy to stop at the deli and come home to make on the spur of the moment.
