mavaer - Under NO circumstances can you make this a day ahead and keep it covered in the fridge! Do not attempt this. IF you live far enough north (I would advise above 59 degrees lat) you could try hacking a hole into the permafrost (a minimum of 3.5 feet, or 1.0668 meters, for you Nederlanders) and storing it in airtight ziploc bags, wrapped with tinfoil and cheesecloth. I hope this helps. Oh, and the cilantro/mint combo here works really well.

I added some lime juice, which gives it a little bite, and served with homemade baked tortilla chips. Yummy!

The recipe is a similar to a traditional indian chutney except that the original recipe does not have sourcream. It uses plain yogurt instead(Qty per your taste). I do add salt and some lemon juice also to give it some more flavour. It will go well with pakoras or fish or even crab cakes
