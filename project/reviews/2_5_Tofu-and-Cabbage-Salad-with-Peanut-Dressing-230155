I reviewed the other comments and then tweaked the recipe by adding Vietnamese hot sauce to the dressing, less cucumber, and a couple of handfuls of seasoned dry roasted peanuts.

I made this recipe with non-fat yogurt...I do NOT recommend doing that. In the best words I can come up with...it was funky and sour tasting.

Not bad. Just a basic recipe - add stuff to your own taste, I agree. But easy to make, and you can eat a lot - great for a guilt-free pigout

I liked this recipe, as did friends. It is healthy and satisfying. I agree - it's better if you add hot sauce, garlic &/or ginger to spice it up.

Bland and boring! I re-vamped this by adding 3 garlic cloves, 1 tablespoon minced ginger, 3 tablespoons chopped cilantro, and it was better but still a little ho-hum. So I added more soy sauce to taste and some heat with chile powder. I used pre-flavored tofu (it comes baked with peanut or thai flavor, at Trader Joes or some supermarkets) because plain tofu cooked just in peanut oil would make me fall asleep on the kitchen table while eating it. Who made this recipe, were their taste buds dead or something?

I would only make this recipe again by adding a bunch of items- most important- hot sauce! I also added garlic and peanuts. Next time I would try adding ginger and sesame seeds. Not fantastic but worth trying out.

I had to give this recipe only one fork. I made it exactly as said, and it was very bland. However, with the leftovers, I added cilantro, roasted garlic, apple cider vinegar, more soya sauce, dried hot pepper flakes, and chili powder which turned this salad into a 2 1/2 forks. I suggest making a different peanut sauce for this salad (like the chinese peaunut sauce on this site), and thinning it with non-fat yogurt to lower the proportional calorie count (even if it dilute the flavors quite a bit, the yogurt helps to make the dressing's consistency a little more creamy). It's very healthy however, so it's worth playing around with the recipe.
