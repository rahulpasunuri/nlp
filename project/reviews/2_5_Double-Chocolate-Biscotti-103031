This is a regular feature for Christmas at our house. I have made this recipe four times now and have requests for repeats for our family beach trip each year. Easy and very good!

Those others are crazy! It was easy and, thought I am not a great lover of biscotti, it was the best I've ever had! Perhaps that's because it was sweeter than I'm used to. I did cook it considerably longer than the recipe said and left it in the warm oven to dry out longer.

This recipe might make a nice chocolate pecan teabread, if baked longer in one loaf pan - but biscotti? Absolutely not! Not the right shape, size, or texture. There are far better chocolate biscotti recipes out there. Try the double chocolate walnut bicotti, (Gourmet, November, 1994) with pecans, if you want. It is in the Epicurious.com file, too.

These cookies got rave reviews from everyone who sampled them. Very easy to make -- I'm definitely adding them to my repertoire. Hazelnuts would make a nice substitution for the pecans.
