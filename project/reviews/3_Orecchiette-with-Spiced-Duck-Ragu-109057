This a hit with my guests. I put the skin in the oven, cut in little pieces until it toasted and crackled. This was placed on the table so everyone could add a teaspoonful. it was excellent and added a little crunch to the dish. Very gamy and strong ragu. Really great!

So I really hate it when people review recipes that they've drastically modified, but I have to admit that I made a few adjustments. I really wanted to make this with duck, so of course this was the first time in months that Whole Foods has not had duck. I instead had to resort to chicken thighs, but I accidentally got boneless chicken thighs. After simmering for an hour, the meat was a little tough, stringy, and chewy. I'm not sure if bone-in thighs would have helped the situation, or if maybe chicken shouldn't simmer as long as duck. In any case, I want to make this again with duck to see if the other people are right when they say that you can't taste a difference. I find that hard to believe. I used a 28oz can and a 14 oz can of tomatoes, because I agree with the other people that 2 28oz cans would have been too much, but I added the little can so that the meat would have enough sauce to simmer in. I used spinach instead of arugula because my boyfriend doesn't like bitter greens, and I thought it worked out fine. As for the feta cheese--I thought it added a wonderful complexity to the dish and it perfectly complimented the other flavors. I also didn't et the sauce cool and re-warm it because I din't have time. I could see how this would make for a nicer sauce, but I would think that it would be a more important step when using fattier duck. One more thing--don't try to cook the garlic and herbs for 3 minutes--they'll just burn. I knew better, but let my garlic burn anyway. overall, I think that this is a nice disch that's worth trying.

I am making this dish for the fourth time and I realized I have never written a review for it. So, here goes. First of all, every time I have made this I have used wild duck. It takes longer to simmer to make tender but it has much, much less fat. I have a tendency to sear the duck pieces first and then remove the fat from the duck. After seering, you should have just enough fat for the saute portion of the recipe. Wild duck is stronger in flavor, has less fat so the result is a bit more gamey. But the tomato sauce balances this nicely. My brother-in-law does not like duck and he said this is the only way to eat it. Although I don't quite agree (I love duck) this is a beautiful recipe. Served this last time with a 2002 Crimson Creek Merlot and was so in love with the blend between the spicy dish and the slightly fruit wine! Great winter and fall dish and would recommend it to those who say they don't care for duck.

This was just OK. Was a good use of inexpensive chicken thighs, but I thought the cinnamon added a wierd taste. I didn't think it had much depth of flavor. There are better, heartier ragu recipes around.

Very good without being too fussy. I simplified further by using pre-roasted duck that is meant to be fully reheated for 20 minutes. I simply reduced the simmer time to that and kept the rest the same. I agree with others that the tomato volume is too high - perhaps 2x that needed. I might try using diced tomatoes vs crushed to retain more of the duck flavor as distinguished from the tomator. I also did not feel the sauce called for feta cheese, and ended up omitting it. Overall hearty, flavorful and much enjoyed.

I was looking for an intereting duck recipe and I found it. I followed the recipe exactly and it is a keeper. I may try fresh chopped tomatoes next time and use the best fresh ingredients you can find, that is it for suggestions! Great the next day. Sophisticated and easy.

Enjoying leftovers as I type....yum! This recipe is a good use of the skinless, boneless chicken thighs you see in the market; you could feed a delicious meal to a crowd inexpensively, or use this as part of a buffet or for a potluck. I generally followed the recipe, using 3 pounds boneless, skinless thighs, 4 cloves garlic, dried thyme instead of fresh, and about 1 tsp cinnamon instead of a stick. The cinnamon works only because of the red pepper; season to taste. Also substituted lots of chopped fresh baby spinach for the arugula and used lots more Parmesan and less feta. I have a question about the tomatoes -- in *my* kitchen, one 28-ounce can of crushed tomatoes equals 3 1/2 cups -- so why would the recipe call for *two* cans??? It simmers covered, so there's not much reduction. Since I was using more chicken than called for in the recipe, I used one 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes and a 14-ounce can of tomato puree. Turned out to be a right amount of sauce so I'm not sure that two cans would be right for 2 pounds of poultry. Looking forward to more leftovers tonight!

Very nice, tasty dish. I have to agree with previous review in that I'm not sure using duck made a big difference with the flavor. I will make again but will use the chicken legs next time and might have to update this review!

I did not find the duck added anything. Next time I will either try rabbit or just stay with chicken.
