This is a wonderful cake. I served it with a dollop of slightly sweetened whip cream and a lemon curd rather than the glaze. Great hit at our last St. Patricks Day dinner.

This is a dark moist dense cake for a rustic dinner. My guests all had seconds. I prefer it over a lighter gingerbread because of the rich flavor, one of my favorites that i make once every winter. I do not add the nuts, personal preference.

Wonderfully flavorful without being overpowering - great for a winter party. Some guests would have preferred serving the lemon glaze on the side (I thought it added a nice zing), but everyone complimented how great the cake was!

I made this for St Patty's Day Potluck at work and 85% of the people liked it. Those that didn't care for it, said that they were expecting a lighter type cake and this one is not at all light. It is very tasty and a friend of mine that is of German heritage is absolutely crazy about it so depends who you are baking it for!

I am surprised at the last review.... I made this cake last St.Patty's day and it was served at a local pub where it was gobbled up and many people asked for the recipe! I though the lemon icing gave it a nice zing I guess you have to like spice cake to appreciate it.

Rather boring tasting.

This is a delicious cake. Easy to make and a nice treat in the middle of winter. It's also a nice way to use my fresh new spices from Penzeys. I had a pear so I diced that and added it along with the pecans.

This cake was nice and moist and not too sweet. I used regular beer instead of stout and cooked it in a bundt pan, baking it for a little longer. (remove from pan while still warm)

This cake was a HUGE hit at a St. Pat's Day party. Very easy to make, nice and moist. I will make it over and over again.

This cake turned out great. Everyone at the St Patricks Day Party loved it. Next time I will reduce the amount of molasses, however. I baked it in a 10" round pan instead of the suggested rectangular, and found that it took at least twice as long to bake, slightly over an hour.

The cake is fabulous. I'd cut back on the anise next time; it was a bit overpowering for my taste. Rather than using the lemon glaze, I thinned out some lemon curd with lemonade and served the cake on top of this sauce and garnished it with fresh whipped cream and lemon zest. I think an orange sauce would be just as complimentary. Definitely a keeper!
