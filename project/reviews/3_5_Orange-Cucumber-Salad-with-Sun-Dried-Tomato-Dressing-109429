Very yummy. I totally changed this up - used maple syrup instead of honey -added a bell pepper. Did not have any sun-dried tomato, so I added some homemade ketchup. Overall, refreshing and a good salad to make with what is on hand - sweet and slightly tangy.spicy.

This is excellent. Unfortunately, my boyfriend thought it tasted like nutmeg, which he dislikes, so I had to eat his serving too (which I didn't mind doing!). I'd like to try it without the cinnamon and cumin to see if he'd like it that way. I'm excited to try the dressing with some other ingredients that other reviewers have suggested as well.

This dressing is wonderful. I've only used it on this salad and did have compliments. I can see it does have other salad possibilities.

I neglected to add the sun-dried tomato to the dressing, and the flavors were still very refreshing. Can't imagine how it could have been better with the tomato!

I have made the dressing at least a dozen times and always have rave reviews from my husband and our guests. Even my mother-in-law raved about it! I made the entire recipe the first time, but then made just the dressing for a salad of fresh cabbage, tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, bell peppers and jicama - sometimes all the above, sometimes just whatever is available. I usually quadruple the recipe just to keep in the fridge.

One Tablespoon of honey really goes a long way, and this dressing was very sweet, but did not have much flavor otherwise. I served this salad over lettuce.

Tasty and easy. Added toasted sesame seeds, sliced red onions to dressing and added greens to the salad. Could have used a little more dressing. Also, used a little less oil than called for and substituted mandarin oranges for fresh,

Simple, delicious and beautiful presentation! I served this for Washington's beautiful people and they loved it!

I thought this was pretty good and it received complements from all my guests. The dressing is good and certenly a little different. As for the bad reviews I think they are looking for too much from a salad dressing. I don't feel the dressing is supposed to overwelm the salad. I also put it on a bed of greens.

The presentation of the colors was very attractive, but I didn't care for the combination of flavors.

I thought this was just ok, but not great. My husband didn't like it at all. Not a lot of flavor, and I expected more after reading so many positive reviews.

I guess that this would be better with some lettuce tossed in with the oranges and cukes. With just the two is was OK, but did not make the most of the dressing and folks just took small helpings.

I agree with the previous accounting of this recipe. The dressing sounded so promising, but in the end did not deliver enough flavor to pull off the rather bland coupling of orange and cucumber. Needed something...had a hard time giving it 2 forks...too boring.

This was okay, but not something I will make again. The dressing has possible potential for a marinade, but it would need to be spiced up a bit more.

I used the recipe with the oranges and cucumbers on a bed of fresh spinach, with the dressing, and added toasted slivered almonds. This was very easy to make and the dressing has a very unique and pleasant flavor. I will definitely make this again.

This is as refreshing as it sounds. I have started using organic apple cider vinegar in salad dressings - it makes an amazing difference.

Arranged oranges and cucumbers over mixed lettuce greens and poured dressing over all. Nice presentation and yummy!

This was great, my family and guests loved it. I put the oranges and cucumbers on a bed of spring greens, and sprinkled slivered almonds on top. A keeper.

So wonderful! No one could stop talking about it, and everyone asked for the recipe. I will make this again and again.

Didn't have any onions, but the garden was full of chives in blossom to tossed a small amoount of the blossoms, which I had pulled apart. Also cut back just a bit on the oil, and added thinly sliced yellow pepper. The color combination was attractive, flavor was excellant. Got many compliments, and no left-overs.

Not sure if I would make again...my husband, who is one of the least picky persons I know and usually praises everything I make, proclaimed it "odd"....I liked it OK, but after the rave reviews maybe I was expecting more? I did like the dressing although I would cut back a bit on the honey and cumin if I did make again.

Very attractive salad and a delicious change from the usual lettuce-based salad. It was easy to make and the only change I made was to reduce the cinnamon (personal preference). I like the idea of adding sliced red onions and /or red peppers! Already added to my recipe box!!!

I also added red onion, from another review & had left from another salad. I made this for a block party, the first person when I presented it on the table said, interesting!!!. I had no leftovers and my husband said I hope we have more in the fridg.

this was a wonderful addition to my summer salad collection. served it with vitello tonato and it had just the right combination of crunch and semisweetness to compiment the cold veal. next week i'll try it with a spice rubbed pork tenderloin.

Excellent. You could use slightly less olive oil if you wanted, otherwise, wouldn't change a thing.

This salad is a beautiful addition to your buffet/brunch. However, I found the dressing much to heavy for the light orange/cucumber combination. Wouldn't make this one again. My guest did not go back for seconds for this dish.

This is wonderful alone as a side salad, but I have also made it into a whole meal by adding cooked fish and serving over arugula. The sweetness of the dressing counterbalances beautifully with the pepper of the greens.

Good recipe and so quick! I had to make my boyfriend stop eating the salad so I'd have some left over! What made this salad delicious was the dressing, although it was a bit on the oily side. This salad is a great, unique side dish.

Four forks and so easy to put together....a winning combination!! It is an interesting combination of ingredients and flavors that makes you want more and more and more. The portions are very small so next time I will add an extra orange and few more slices of cukes with the same amount of dressing which was very generous. If you use small, dark regular cucumbers you won't need to use the seedless ones.

This was well received both times I prepared it. On one occasion I added jicama in matchsticks. The second time, I also added some 10-15 onions (the sweet Texas onion that is in season now). My guests loved it and there were no leftovers. I added some orange zest to the dressing, and made it in the blender.

this.... was.... sooo.... GOOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! oh my god. when i read the ingredients, i was a little perplexed, cinnaomon... apple cider.. and so on. but i made it. oh wow. it tasted very fresh. hmm. my whole family LOVED THIS! a little secret: use this as a dressing for chicken strips. lather this on sliced chicken breast, then dip it bread crumbs. hahah. i did this and everyone thought i was lying when i said i made it! BRAVO!

This recipe is ideally suited for a food processor. Use your slicing disc to prepare the cucumbers and oranges and your blade to prepare the dressing (especially, the part about "finely chopped sun-dried tomatoes".

I made this dish on Sunday for a cookout. I liked it so much I made it again on Monday for another cookout. Very easy to make. I really liked the unusual spice combination. I served it with mixed greens on the side. I'll definitely make it again.

Omitted the cucumbers as my friend doesn't like them and added sliced red onion. Served with grilled pork loin - very good.

I concur with all the other reviewers, this salad is excellent! Beautiful presentation, easy to put together and tastes incredible. I consider myself a novice with the knife, but the orange was easier to cut up then I thought it was going to be.

Wonderful flavors and beautiful presentation. I added some roasted red peppers for another contrasting color. It was just delicious and easy to put together.

YUM!! and very easy! Because I don't like peeling oranges and removing the pith, I used mandarin oranges from a jar and cut the cucumber in smaller pieces. Also, at the suggetion of one of the previous reviewers, I used a fruit vinegar. I didn't have orange but used raspberry. It was very good. I served it as a first course with flounder and herbed couscous. The sweetness was a good complement to the herbs.

Great salad and easy to make. I combined the dressing ingredients in a small food processor which speeded things up.

Really, really excellent! Looking at the ingredients, I thought "interesting" and was really surprized at how good it was and it got a thumbs up all the way around the table. Didn't change a thing. Might try an orange flavored vinegar next time just to taste the difference. Do make a lot more than the recipe calls for though because this makes really skimpy portions!
