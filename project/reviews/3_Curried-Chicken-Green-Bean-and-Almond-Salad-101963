I used snow peas instead of green beans. No mayonnaise, just a bit of olive oil. I also added cranberries. Delicious!

Lo-carb, easy and yummy! Made without the onion, because I didn't have any, substituted fresh red pepper and loved it just the same. This will become a staple around my house.

really good and very easy to make. it did need a little more zip so I added extra lime juice, curry powder and black pepper and salt. served with warm couscous with raisins and almonds. delicious. a nice quick Saturday lunch

I used mulchi (or madras) curry and wow, was it spicy. I agree about the onions. Next time I'll let them soak in some cold water before using them. I wouldn't get rid of them though. The curry I used was so spicy (and I used extra because I was afraid it wouldn't be spicy enough) that it really overpowered the dish. My boyfriend LOVED it though. It's an easy, healthy meal.

this dish was easy to make and received rave reviews. I added chopped celery and raisins and doubled the curry and it added a lot to the flavor.

I used cashews instead of almonds and it was quite yummy!

SO good! I used plenty of lime juice and a bit more curry to give it more zip. The spiciness of the dish just depends on what type of curry you have.

I served it cold over hot couscous. It was a big hit.

I agree that the dressing was too mild. No kick. I added thai green curry (maybe a teaspoon or so), and it added a great zip to it!

This was good. I don't like raw onions, so I left them out. Still tasty. My curry powder doesn't have much spiciness to it-- next time I'll add a dash of cayenne to compensate.

Very tasty; I agree that it calls for too many onions. Next time I'll let the onions marinate for a few minutes in the lime juice before mixing in the other ingredients to soften the bite. Also, I think green apple would be a nice addition to this.

A crunchy tasty dish ideal in hot summer months. Works well with other green veg too: broccoli or sugar snap peas.

my husband's #1 favourite. it's not summertime without this salad.

I make this recipe to take as a cold salad to pot lucks and other parties. Everyone raves about it and it's become my "signature" contribution to a party. I do cut down a bit on the onions and sometimes the curry, depending on the crowd. To top it off, this is a very healthy but filling dish.

I thought the main problem with this salad is that it had too many onions. I LOVE onions but i couldn't even stand the smell of my own breath after eating this. This was the first recipe i've used from epicurious and i know now not to always trust good reviews.

I love green beans, almonds, cilantro, etc., but somehow this did not work for me! I took a few bites and tossed the rest.

This salad is deee-licious! It provides a wonderful blend of flavors and textures. Even my husband (who is not a curry fan) loved this salad. I followed the suggestions of others and added an apple for sweetness. I cut back a little on the cilantro because it is such a strong flavor. I would also like to try it with bowtie pasta. A definite keeper -- I'll make this again!

I make this salad several times a year. It is one of my favorites. My husband likes it too. It doesn't hurt that the calorie/fat count is favorable and it sneaks in another serving of vegetables!!

This dish would have been awful if I had not incorporated the other cook's suggestion. This recipe definitely needed the apple and raisins (or Crasins). I doubled the curry sauce, but if I make this again I will definitely halve the cilantro. It was way to overpowering. Otherwise, it was an impressive meal. :o)

Our Mother's Day lunch was superb with this as the main course served on a bed of curly lettuce, along with sourdough baguette and sweet butter. Dry saute the curry spice as recommended for maximum flavour.

Good main-dish salad. Took the advice of one of the reviewers and added a chopped gala apple which I think really added a nice sweet to contrast the strong flavors.

I pretty much stuck to the recipe but added about 2 cups of rice. The curry I used is rather hot so there was no lack of spice. Some of the other variations mentioned here sound good, I'll make this again nd probably will experiment more.

This didn't do that much for me. If I make it again, I think I'd toss in some green grapes. I probably won't make it again, though

Very good and easy dish. A nice change from an ordinary salad. I omitted the fresh cilantro, only because we had none. But, did not miss it. And, probably would not add it next time. We also put apple in ours, and it was great! I also thought cashews would be good. Will do again!

Easy to make dish and is very good. I omitted the lemon juice and bumped up the amount of curry a little bit. Great flavor. I served it with rice and a few chow mein noodles to add texture.

This recipe was just okay, but a great starting point for something really special. I followed the suggestions from the cooks who added fuji apples and more curry. Those two things definately punched it up a notch. As an after thought, I added some golden raisins to the leftovers and WOWEEEE! Very good. But, now, I think I have a whole new recipe.

Very good and easy. Added the Fuji apples - loved them! Also added extra curry powder. There were three of us, and no leftovers when diner was finished!

Yummy. Made this for Father's Day in warm CA. Exactly copied recipe. Could have used more curry powder and did put more in. Still curry not overpowering. All in all, very refreshing and a change from the ordinary chicken combinations.

I added some Fuji apple and used toasted walnuts instead of the almonds-- yum!

This recipe is wonderful. Instead of the beans, cilantro and onions, I used green grapes. The curry dressing, chicken, almonds, and grapes proved to be a wonderful combination. When served to a group of picky friends, it won rave reviews.

We really enjoyed this salad. It is bound to become a summer favorite! Good for potlucks too.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but my husband and I hated this dish. The cilantro overtook the taste. Next time I would half the amount I used. Every other recipe I've gotten from here turned out wonderful.

This was really tasty -- I boiled my chicken in some stock with onions and also blanched the green beans in the same fluid--(then saved the juice for soup). I didn't have any curry powder so used cumin which tasted great, and I served the salad over chopped fresh spinach and added some halved grapes. Yummy!!

a wonderful melange of tastes that just light up your mouth--the heated curry, onion, lime, almonds work very well together. A definite hit!
