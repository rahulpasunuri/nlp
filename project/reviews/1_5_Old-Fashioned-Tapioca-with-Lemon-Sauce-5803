This recipe is a poor excuse for tapioca pudding. I frequently make tapioca using the recipe on the box. I expected this to be richer and creamier. Instead I ended up with something that was flavorless with way to much lemon peel. Definately a throw away.

This recipe has possibilities--the lemon sauce was excellent, and the flavor of the pudding was good. However, the pudding was a bit too sweet, so I would reduce the sugar next time. Also, it didn't thicken like it was suppose to and I had to add cornstarch--maybe it's because I accidentally used nonfat instead of 2% milk. I think it's probably worth trying again with some modifications. Good that it's low fat.

This dish was very disappointing. The lemon flavor in the sauce was very strong and overpowered everything. The tapioca was o.k. by itself but it wasn't anything special. I would not recommend this.
