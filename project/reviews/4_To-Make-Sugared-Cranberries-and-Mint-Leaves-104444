Powdered egg whites not required! Just use one to two egg whites beaten until foamy. Brush the mint leaves and cranberries in the egg whites and roll/dredge thru the sugar. So simple and elegant and makes a beautiful garnish on any Christmas dessert!

I didn't make this particular recipe, but I make something similar. I make a simple sugar syrup and add fresh cranberries for 1 min(while at a rapid boil)--no longer or they'll pop! Then I remove and roll in granulated sugar. They're tart, yes, but wonderful when accompanied with a sweet dessert, such as a pumpkin flan or cheesecake.
