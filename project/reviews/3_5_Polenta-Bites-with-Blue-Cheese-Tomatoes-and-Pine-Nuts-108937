These never fail to delight, look terrific and disappear fast. What great little vessels to take off in other directions for toppings. Try some finely chopped wild mushrooms in the polenta or on top. Go crazy!

The polenta itself was bland and barely solidified enough to be called finger food. The flavors didn't meld as well as I'd hoped. In the future I'll serve my Saga blue with crackers so guests can really appreciate it, and I'll save the pine nuts and basil for pesto.

Went over very well as passed "bite" at cocktail party. I followed advice of others and froze the cups; they popped right out of the muffin tins and were easy to fill while frozen. I did add a little extra paremsan and used the mellon ball tool to create the cup. Would make again. I doubled recipe and got 60 cups.

The polenta was a little bland in these. I will try them again, but add cayenne to the polenta. I may also experiment with some different toppings. I'm a fan a blue cheese, but it was a little weird in this dish. I found that scooping the cooled polenta out with a melon baller was a lot easier than making an indentation while the polenta was still warm.

I followed the recipe for 1/2 of the batch, the other 1/2 I subbed boursin for the blue cheese. I'm not a polenta fan, but my guests seemed to really like these. Those filled with boursin really need to be watched carefully in the oven. Once the cheese softens, remove them from the oven immediately. If left for just a bit longer, the boursin will turn liquid and start to dissolve the cups - they weaken and collapse. (FYI for anyone wanting to try it with boursin)

Generally I think Polenta is a bit bland. I added more cheese to the polenta than the recipe required. I would make again and will experiment with the toppings. Note - to make the indent in the polenta while in the muffin tin - use a wet implement (I used the back side of a mellon baller). Dipping the mellon baller in the water between indentations made making the indentations much easier.

I have made these several times and always get many complements and requests for the recipe. I put a little cayenne pepper in the polenta while cooking to spice it up a bit.

I have made this recipe several times. It is a hit at all my dinner parties. I serve it with fume blanc. Use plenty of pam in mini muffin pan and the polenta is no problem. I serve them in a puddle of roasted bell pepper sauce for starters as a first course.

These little guys looked better than they tasted. It was just a very bland taste for me. If they were able to stay warm longer maybe the flavors would have been better. Looked nice, but wouldn't make them again.

I make these for every party I host (because they're so easy to make in advance and just warn as guests arrive), and a friend just requested them when I invited him for dinner. I have to say that these are really fabulous little treats, and they are a snap to prepare. For people who have had trouble with the polenta, I suggest using a good amount of PAM in your muffin tin (forget the butter - it's too complicated & fattening), use Quaker yellow corn meal (NOT quick cooking), and get good fresh parmesan cheese (from the deli). I followed the directins exactly and had no problem with them. To make the indentations, I use the end of a wooden spoon, and I keep dipping it in cold water to wash off the gooey polenta. I stick it down the center of the polenta muffin and "twirl" in a circle while gently making my circle bigger. I put the spoon pretty deep so as to be able to fit all the good innards! Give it a try - it's really not that tough. Enjoy!

First time I changed the filling and used bacon shrimp cheese and green onions. The flavor was fabulous. I too as others had a bit of a problem with the bites keeping their shape. I will try the freezing 1st idea. I think these are a great idea for many appetizer flavors!

I too, popped these into the freezer for about 20-30 minutes after molding into the muffin tins and then refrigerated until I was ready to put together. No problem getting out of the muffin tins. I also agree these would be great with other toppings!

These were easy to make and hostess-friendly. I love that you can make these ahead of time and pop them in the oven for a few minutes just as your guests arrive. The recipe is quite versatile. I tried a few using chopped, sun-dried tomatoes and some using feta cheese - delicious!

Has anyone tried making these ahead and freezing them? I can see that you would probably want to add the tomatoes just before cooking.

This was a big hit at our annual "cheesy" holiday party! Very colorful, aromatic and tasty. We also used the packaged polenta and it worked well. After shaping the polenta into the muffin tins, try freezing them for half-an-hour or so before popping them out and filling them. This made for easy work.

Would I make this again...I've already made it 3 times in a week for 2 different holiday parties! In fact, I had made 2 batches, served on to family on Christmas eve, and had to pull out the 2nd batch I was saving for Christmas Day because everyone was asking for more. I also used the Pampered Chef Tart shaper which made perfect sizes with perfect indentations. (Nope...I'm not a Pampered Chef sales person!) I made 36 tarts with a single recipe and they had plenty of polenta in them. These were so yummy with red wine. Enjoy!

I made these for a holiday open house, and they were very easy and delicious. I used plain old quaker corn meal that I happened to have in the pantry. Polenta held its shape beautifully. I made them two days ahead, wrapped up in the muffin tin in plastic wrap...this made it easy to parcel them out in small batches, as they are best warm right out of the oven! I will try with other cheese and veggie combos...

Thought this recipe looks quite good, I must admit I haven't tried it yet. As the biggest problems mentioned seemed to be the consistency and workability of the polenta, I would recommend using a premade log of polenta like the San Gennaro brand, available at Whole Foods Markets and Trader Joe's, among other places. Though it certainly doesn't have the creaminess of polenta-from-scratch, its glutinous texture would seem to be ideal for this recipe. Picture polenta+Playdoh to get an idea of how easy it is to work with. (And it's just cornmeal, water, salt, tartaric acid, and some vitamins, so this texture doesn't come from any scary emulsifiers.) I don't have any mini muffin pans, though I might try a variation on this with medium muffin pans or with slices of the polenta log. Hope my comments are useful to someone. Steve

I made these for a few different parties and they were great. I especially liked that they could mostly be made ahead of time. Very easy and quick to put the finishing touches on at the last minute and delicious too!

i've tried the recipe twice now. both times the polenta has collapsed when i took them out of the muffin tins. i baked them anyway and we wound up spreading the mixture on toast. tasted great-looked horrible.

The recipe was great! They tasted wonderful and filled the kitchen with a rich cheesy toasty aroma. However, my one big complaint was that the polenta was a nightmare to work with. It got gummy and I had difficulty getting them to fill muffin tin properly. Making the indentations was another time consuming challenge that I gave up on and just tried to balance all the toppings on the polenta. Fortunately, they turned out well and people enjoyed them, but I wouldn't make them again b/c of the effort!

I didn't have trouble with these being runny ar not setting up at all. I doubled the recipe. I used a tart shaper from Pampered Chef rubbed on a butter stick to make the indentations and they were the perfect size to fit the blue cheese tomatoes, pine nuts and green onions. My guests loved them. I will definitely make these again.

In my first attempt at this, I followed the directions but had inadvertantly used slow cooking corn meal which made this a big disaster & waste! There is no indication that quick cooking corn meal should be used. Also, on most corn meal packaging, it doesn't indicate quick or slow cooking ...

I don't know what went wrong, but these collapsed in the oven. I served them anyhow, but they were messy and not particularly tasty either.

First bite exploded with flavor. Outstanding. I ate 8 of them. Prior reviewers have given all the tips needed. They are truly GOOD.

We served these tasty morsels at a tequila tasting. There were perfect and the presentaton was so pretty. I loved the pine nuts. Must make again, soon!

Just served these at a holiday party - it was a HIT! I doubled the recipe but would split 1 recipe among 48 mini-muffins next time. Make your thumb prints BIG if you want to fit everything in there (harder with a full muffin cup). Really easy to make and pop into the oven as needed. Best served warm - but I didn't have any trouble with that... they were scarfed down each time I placed a fresh batch of them on the table!!!!

Yummy. I used chopped large tomatoes and snipped chives instead of the grape tomato quarters and green onion, and didn't use pine nuts, but they still turned out great. Also used vegetable broth instead of chicken for my vegetarian guests. I found that the polenta could be a bit too soft to get out of the muffin tins, so I stuck them in the freezer for an hour, then ran a sharp knife tip around them and they popped out easily. They're best served still hot, so I recommend putting them in the oven in small batches.

Great recipe. Leftover polenta is good on its own. A great dish to make for the holidays as it looks very festive. My guests loved them.
