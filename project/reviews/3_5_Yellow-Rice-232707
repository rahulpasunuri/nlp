This was pretty good. I simplified it by cooking 1 cup rice with 2 c. chicken broth and 1/2 tsp turmeric in the rice cooker, and it came out perfectly. It had a subtle flavor from the turmeric and a gorgeous yellow color. It went well with the chicken. I'd make it again.

Absolutely delicious recipe! My family loves this!!! I've added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon & it kicked it up quite a notch!I make it easy however & use Onions rather than going out of my way of buying shallots.It works just the same.

easy, delicious, the perfect foil to any light protein. Would be great with a few golden raisins, chopped greens onions and cilantro thrown in as well. Yummmy.

This is delicious and beautiful. It can be adjusted as you see fit with additional spices (cumin) and topped with chicken, beans, tofu, green onions, peppers (fresh or roasted)...whatever you have on-hand. An excellent "basic".

Looking forward to trying this - so simple. And, no MSG (which the store bought packages do usually contain).

I made the Roasted Lemongrass Chicken recipe that accompanied this rice dish and it was all fantastic! Everyone loved it and it would be a perfect dinner for company! Making the rice again tonight with a Thai grilled Salmon.

Yum Yum Yum! I am typically not a big fan of rice but this was wonderful. Really flavorful and a cinch to prepare. Will make this again and again.

This is such an easy and tasty side dish for almost any main. I served this with the Cumin Beef Kebabs from this website, and it went down a treat at our last dinner party. The rice was very easy to cook while guests were socialising, and it was much more interesting than the plain white variety. Got several compliments and will definitely try again.

Very good but not overly exciting. Worth doing again though. Made it with the lemongrass chicken it was suggested for and it made a nice complement of flavor with the sauce of the chicken. I had some leftover chicken which I shredded up into the rice for a lunch the next day and I enjoyed this very much.

This rice goes really well with the roasted chicken with citrus pan sauce, also on this site. Easy and colorful.

I had just picked up some fresh turmeric from my local Spice House a day before trying this recipe. Intense, lovely, yellow color, easy, tasty recipe.

This was very yummy especially with the sauce from the lemongrass chicken that accompanied it. Never thought of pistachios as a substitute - I'm sure it doesn't taste like rice but can you do this in most rice recipes? I'm intrigued...

Fabulous recipe. I made only 1 slight change - i didn't have any rice so I used raw pistachios instead. Everyone wanted seconds, thirds even, but I ran out. Next time, I'll probably double it or serve it when the kids are fasting.

I've made this twice already. Very tasty and very easy. I don't use canned broth, so I substituted 2 1/4 cups water, 1/2 tablespoon chicken base from Costco. I then reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon.

This is so easy and the taste is amazing. It has a wonderfully buttery taste even though there is no butter in the recipe. However, I tried to double the recipe for a party and it lost something in translation. Carefully watch the rice around the 15 minute mark; 18 minutes seemed a bit too long. Don't skip the turmeric; it is essential to the color.
