Really good. Reminded me that making risotto is fun--especially if you have other kitchen projects going at the same time...but don't let the risotto burn. Having amazing broth is super important here...so if you use homemade, make sure it's super tasty. Fun to make, easy to start beforehand, impressive to friends, great leftovers, pretty much can't go wrong.

Creamy risotto can be a fickle mistress as far as flavoring goes- If you drizzle the squash with a touch of olive oil, sprinkle with kosher salt and ground pepper before roasting it it will add a lot of flavor to your final dish. Whether you want the risotto to be the main star or the accompaniment to the shrimp may determine how you leave the squash... accompaniment puree it, as a star leave it chunked. If you're going to leave it chunked, peel and cube the squash first, season as mentioned above, and then roast. You will get caramelization on all sides that way, and it will really shine in your dish.

This was my first time making risotto and it turned out pretty well. 15 minutes is nowhere near the amount of time it takes for the chicken stock to absorb though. It took about 35 minutes at least for the addition of the chicken stock to the rice. I didn't make the cornmeal shrimp but instead roasted shrimp in the oven and tossed them with some lemon juice before topping the risotto with them. I was surprised that the squash didn't add much taste to the risotto, it simply added a subtle sweetness. My family really enjoyed the dish though.

Really not a fan of this one. The squash made my lovely, slow cooked risotto all gummy and didn't add any flavor. The shrimp were a weird consistency and again, no flavor. A waste of good ingredients, IMHO.

My husband and I both really liked this dish. It's a great Fall meal. The shrimp was crispy and easy to prepare and complimented the creamy and flavorful risotto. I only used 1/2 the amount of fresh thyme and thought it was plenty. I prepared the squash a few hours ahead of time which was helpful. We'll make it again.

This was just ok... The risotto is missing texture, but the shrimp complemented it well. I think that the squash should be in chunks, or some corn should be added to improve the recipe.

I just made the risotto and it was delicious. I didn't have thyme so I omitted it and I opted not to process the squash. still turned out great! This one is a keeper.

This is probably my favorite dish I've ever made. The butternut squash gave the risotto a great taste, and the shrimp balance it perfectly!

My friends and I loved this! I couldn't find thyme so I used a fresh herb mix of thyme, sage, and rosemary and it added so much more great flavors than if I had used just thyme. I will also add some crushed red pepper to the onions next time for a little extra kick. My friends thought chunkier squash might be better than pureed, but that's just a preference. It was pretty easy, if you're used to making risotto and the shrimp were easy and so tasty!

I cooked this dish on New Year's Eve. The husband and kids (10 & 14) LOVED the risotto and shrimp combination. I did not add any other seasoning or flavors to this recipe, but I made sure to season the cornmeal enough so that the shrimp was savory and was a good contrast to the creamy and just slightly sweet risotto. I did add more parmesan (Reggiano) than the recipe called for, however. Clean up was not a problem for me - I stirred the risotto every minute or so to make sure the rice did not stick. This was an easy and delicious meal. I served it with chopped red swiss chard and red onion braised in olive oil.

This dish is a true fall dish, so delicious and perfect for the season! A definite keeper in my book!

I liked this recipe, although the orange on orange made for an interesting looking meal! (throw in some green beans/asparagus for some contrast). Cleanup was a bit of a problem.

I agree on the cleaning point below. My husband is still cleaning and we finished eating half an hour ago. The recipe was pretty good, but I agree that it needed a lot of doctoring. I added a lot of extra flavors (more salt, parm, and cloves and cinnamon to the squash). Otherwise, it would have been too bland. I really did like the shrimp though and would make it again, maybe in shrimp tacos or something. It was a weird contrast to the sweet risotto and tasted like spanish food to me.

I am really surprised so many people disliked this recipe. My family really liked it. The only think I don't like is that it requires a lot of cleanup.

Not a big fan of the shrimp. Not enough of a contrast to the risotto's great flavors. I'll keep the risotto recipe to serve separately!

This was a terrible recipe hands down. Too much sweet on sweet, not enough contrast. The dishes may be acceptable if they are served individually, but not together. Horrible.

This is a poorly thought out recipe. There is far too much sugar/sweet in each of these compenents. Served individually they might be good dishes. But together they are pure crap. Save yourself time and money and make either the risotto or the shrimp - do not put the two together.

I absolutely love this risotto - it has an amazing texture and flavor - I added sage and apple cider as well. I haven't tried the shrimp yet but the risotto is such a keeper

I would definitely disagree with the previous negative reviews of this recipe. The risotto was exeptional... creamy and sweet from the butternut squash making for a wonderful contrast to the crunchy and savory shrimp. The one alteration I did make was that I added more herbs...rosemary and sage in addition to the thyme. This really added a lot of flavor.

My sister's a vegitarian, so I substituted veggie broth for the chicken broth and left out the shrimp. Usually the broth substitution isn't an issue, so I have to conclude that this risotto was generally lacking in flavor. I had to use a LOT of salt and a LOT of cheese to get it to taste like anything. Some liked it, but I wouldn't make it again.

This is a great dish if you like shrimp and risotto. The puree of squash that gives that oct. color is wonderful and tasty. The cornmeal covered shrimp is a new twist to shrimp. enjoy

waste of great ingredients, the marinating of the shrimp caused the shrimp to taste like garlic gloves not shrimp and I only marinated them for 30 minutes due to lack of time. The risotto was great but the combo of the risotto with the shrimp was weird.

The risotto was good but the shrimp didn't work for me at all. I also thing the flavor combo was odd. The fresh thyme in the risotto was fantastic; even my 1 year old couldn't get enough!
