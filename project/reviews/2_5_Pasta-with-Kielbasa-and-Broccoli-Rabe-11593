This is a quick and easy recipe. Boil the pasta as you're making the kielbasa mixture to shorten the time needed to make it. After reading all the comments about the bitterness of the broccoli rabe, I decided to use broccoli florets instead. Also used a red pepper, cut into chunks. I added the parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes, as some people recommended. In addition, I would salt and pepper the vegetable mixture as it's simmering. Again, after reading the prior comments, I used chicken broth instead of water for the simmering. Got rave reviews from the five teenagers and three adults to whom I served it. Would definitely make it again!

Loved this with a few minor changes. I used chicken broth instead of water, chopped the kielbasa larger and sprinkled some red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese over it at the end. I also added some of the pasta water at the end to moisten.

California, I don't see in the recipe ANYWHERE that this is a "traditional" Eastern European recipe. Grow a thicker skin.

The reason this recipe is bad is because it is not a traditional german/eastern european recipe. Eastern Europeans would never make this. Americans need to learn to write proper eastern european recipes

This is blah. If I were to make it again, I'd add a can of tomatoes and some red pepper flakes. I doubt I'll make it again, though, as there are a lot of other great recipes for these ingredients. Broccoli rabe doesn't need to be cooked until it's dead--this recipe wastes this very special green.

Loved this recipe. I needed a recipe that was easy, tasty and had few ingredients because I was cooking for a big crowd (60+ people), this recipe was a huge success, I received so many compliments I was pleasantly surprised. Here's a tip -- when cooking broccoli rabe first drop it in boiling water for 2-3 minutes and drain, this will help take out some of the bitterness. After the broccoli rabe has been drained then add it to the oil and garlic. The broccoli rabe will be less bitter and delicious. I used bow tie pasta instead of a spiral shaped pasta and I think the bow tie worked better than I spiral would. This is a MUST try if you like broccoli rabe and kielbasa. BIG HIT!

If you are a kielbasa fan, this dish is a must! Try adding a little extra olive oil, ample black pepper and some grated asiago cheese. Simple but quick and delicious!

This recipe has some interesting ingredients, but nothing to "hold it together" either literally or figuratively. No big deal, nothing special at all.

It's very important that you purchase the freshest broccoli rabe possible AND use it immediately to lessen the bitterness. The fresher the greens, the less bitter the dish. As I've made this recipe several times already, today I've altered the recipe by browning bulk italian sausage and adding a few drops of pepper-infused olive oil for a bit of a kick. Also I added chicken stock instead of water. Nice results!

This is a great dish and very easy to prepare. If you have never tried brocolli rabe, you are in for a treat. It is somewhat bitter, but the combo of the kielbasa and the pasta balance out this dish. Truly a keeper and worth trying - definitely for the experiential palate!

This is the first time I made a recipe with broccoli-rabe. I love kielbasa and wanted to try something different. I Bar-Be-Qu'ed the kielbasa instead of frying but the broccoli-rabe was too bitter for my taste. No one else liked it either.
