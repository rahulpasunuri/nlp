Calamari just doesn't cook long enough to absorb the grill flavor. If you want to make this, expect the flavors to come from the seasonings. I'd add white wine and rosemary to the ingredients to give it some depth

Was disappointed with the way this turned out. Flavor of beans, with thyme, onion, bay leaf, and then shallots, was nothing special. The calamari had a more interesting taste, as a result of the marinade, but its texture was rubbery (admittedly due to my inexperience with grilling it). All in all, not worth the effort, I thought.

The beans had a nutty flavor and tasted delicious with the calamari. I used the leftover beans on a salad. It was great. I'll be making this recipe again.

I really liked this recipe. It's very typical of food from Naples,Italy which is where my husband is from. It's easy and elegant. Good for entertaining. I'd make it again.
