Excellent. 2011: quadrupled recipe and canned it. 2012: doubled it and canned it. Made 4 half pints. Exceptional color, flavor and lasting pepper taste. Great with a soft cheese also good on it's own. Less sweet than regular jams that I preserve. I'll take other reviewers advice and try on ice cream or frozen yogurt.

Excellent and versatile preserves. I served them over vanilla frozen yoghurt and thought they were too sweet, so I went back and brought the remainder to a boil a second time with additional balsamic vinegar and a pinch of salt. Since I plan to serve these with goat cheese as suggested, and they were quite runny the first time, I also dissolved a package of unflavored gelatin in the vinegar. Perfect!

Fantastic! I made the recipe as described and found (as other reviewiers mentioned) that it took much longer to cook down to the desired consistency. I served it as suggested, with goat cheese on crostini, and every last bite disappeared. Our hostess asked me to leave behind the leftover preserves!

Delicious! I've been canning non-stop for the past 10 months and this is my favorite concoction to date. YUM. So good, in fact, that I feel the need to find more strawberries so I can make more. I did add Pomona's Pectin -- just because I haven't had great luck lately with jam setting properly.

This was awsome!!! I couldn't stop eating it as it cooled. I processed it for ten minutes in quarter pint jars with a quarter inch head space. Yum!

I've made this for a couple of years now. My 6 year old asks for it w/ goat cheese on crackers at least once a week & friends declare it a 10 out of 10.... even the picky ones!

This is a much prettier color if you use white balsamic vinegar (available at Trader Joe). I also think it benefits from canning as the flavors blend and mellow and the pepper comes forward after a month in the jar.

I am not a balsamic fan so I only put half as much and could not taste or smell it all in the finished product. I also only used 1 cup of sugar and it was plenty sweet. The pepper adds an interesting heat.

Tasty, spicy and different! Next time I might put a tiny bit less pepper for my taste

This is so so delicious. In a twist on the goat cheese crostini approach, they are also delicious on cheddar biscuits. One warning though: like others, I found that it took a LOT longer than 20 minutes -- but what came out was worth the wait.

The first time I did a preserve was with this recipe. It was so easy and delicious!!!!!! I have tried other recipes but this one continues being the BEST in every sense

YUM! A great, savory treat when you have super juicy local strawberries that won't hold up to much else. Guests could not get enough and non-stop raves.

We made as written, but I added some liquid pectin and boiled it a lot longer than called for. It made three full quart jars that we canned in a water bath for 10 minutes, thanks to other reviewers advice. It is wonderful! It's not firmly set, but it's perfect and wonderful on crostini and goat cheese! A keeper!

I made this tonight and couldn't be happier with the results. I included all of the ingredients but doubled the amount. Only thing: 15 minutes is not enough time to cook. I make a lot of jams and have never seen a non-pectin preserve take ONLY 15 minutes. I cooked until the gel point, just as I would any other preserve. I left some to serve fresh and canned the rest (1/4 inch head room, in a water bath for 10 minutes). LOVELY!!

This recipe is soooo wonderful. I used heaping cups of strawberries and processed several jars worth. The jars that I don't keep for myself will make delicious and memorable gifts.

There is a lot of excess liquid which didn't totally thicken. We strained some off to try using as a meat marinade but I would suggest adding more sugar to create a more syrupy consistency

OMG, I rarely give 4 forks, but this is the BEST. Served it on crostini with goat cheese. Our guests were about to mutiny when we ran out at a recent party. Would definitely make this again and double it.

I really liked how the flavors blended together. I didn't use the water and it was turned out well. I made crostini with cream cheese instead of goat cheese and it was really good!

Outstanding. I served this over crostini with goat cheese to rave reviews. So simple.

I quadrupled the recipe and canned it. I skipped the water and don't recommend adding any. It did take about 50 minutes of boiling to get the right consistency, and I think water would slow it down even more. I also added an extra tsp of pepper, because I like it spicy. I did spoon some (still warm) on goat cheese and crackers and I have to say, it is absolutely delicious. I highly recommend this one!

This was easy and different--a great hors d'ouevre with the goat cheese. I did not have any trouble getting mine to thicken to the right consistency, though I am not an experienced jelly/preserve maker.

Yum! I made this with the last organic strawberries of the season from a farm right here in Sonoma County (picked yesterday) and it is fab! I cut the sugar down to 1 cup (brown) and (mistakenly) tasted for pepper before cooking it down... so mine's got a real kick, but I love it! Did I say yum already?

Add me to the list, this is excellent on goat cheese. I had similar challenges as the others, I cooked it way beyond the time indicated and I don't think I was terribly successful in thickening it up. I canned what I made. A friend recommended adding some green strawberries next time as it has natural pectin and might help. I will try brown sugar next time - I want to bring out the balsamic and pepper a little more. I'm looking for this to be savory not sugary sweet. Make this, jar this and when unexpected guests arrive pull it out with crackers and goat cheese and it will be as if you had prepared for them all day!

I have done many variations on this recipe. I recently stuck a candle in one version for my friend's brithday. I used fresh strawberries (sliced), a good aged balsamic vinegar and black pepper. I marinated the strawberries with a good helping of vinegar and a healthy dash of black pepper. I served it over vanilla ice cream. It was a huge hit. We thought it was like having strawberries with a sweet and sour cream... Divine.

Very easy to make, wonderful flavors. I used brown sugar and it brought out the pepper, strawberries and balsamic beautifully. Wonderful on brown bread with kalmata ollives as well as goat chees.

Fabulous flavors! I too had to boil a little longer than the recipe called for in order for the preserves to thicken up enough. I also added a little extra pepper. Nice kick.

We ate this on crackers with cream cheese and loved it - so much that I had to make a second batch the next day. The pepper and basalmic really give it a punch.

I made this recipe and canned it. My husband thought I was making regular preserves and when he took a taste, he remarked "What are you making? Tongue hate?" Anyway, he thinks it is rather good when you know it will be tangy and spicy. I'm excited to use it with crostini & cheese.

Unique flavor--I get many compliments when I serve this with the goat cheese and crostini, as recommended. I agree that an inexpensive balsamic vinegar works fine with this.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious, although I needed to increase the cooking time considerably. I used my best balsamic that I carried back from Italy--next time I will try a cheaper vinegar since the taste was not very pronounced.

This is a lovely recipe with great flavors. Since it is for preserves, don't expand it too much, as it will not thicken properly. The amounts can be successfully doubled, however.

I tried this recipe and it didn't thicken at all after 25 min. of boiling. Would've cooked it longer but the vinegar started to smell really strong. I'd made 6x the recipe but my proportions were correct. Anyone got any advice?

Whenever strawberries are at their best, I make this unique recipe. It keeps forever, and makes an incredibly simple and tasty appetizer -- atop french bread crostini with goat cheese.

The first time I made this, it did not thicken very much (my berries were very ripe) and came out the consistency of ice cream topping. So... It turns out to be FABULOUS on vanilla ice cream. I just bought six quarts of strawberries to make a bunch more and can it for Christmas gifts. My dilemma will be preserves or ice-cream topping?

I've been making this since it was published and we love it both for breakfast and as an hors d'oevre. I thought I had lost my printed copy so was glad to find it here in your archives! Our cheese shop just got in some REAL Italian sweet ricotta and as I had had this with a raspberry puree in Rome thought I'd try it with the strawberry! Our strawberries have just started to come in in FL so now is the time to do it!

I cooked it longer so it was quite thicker. I also put the preserves in canning jars and processed. I did not have goat cheese but cream cheese worked just as well. Was a big hit, will give it out next year for Christmas gifts.

As simple as this recipe is, it's always a show-stopper. I serve it as an appetizer as suggested, with goat cheese atop baguette slices. It looks beautiful on the plate, and it's so good it makes your eyes roll back in your head. Be prepared to hear a chorus of "Oooh"s, "Aaah"s, and "Oh my gosh, I've GOT to have this recipe." I don't skim the foam very often, so it's not a lot of work, and a friend of mine even uses frozen strawberries to save prep time. It's also fabulous with buttermilk biscuits.

I loved this variation on plain strawberry jam. I could definitely taste the balsamic vinegar, and agree that the pepper adds a great kick! It was awfully sweet, so I might suggest reducing the sugar content a bit.

Rating: 3
This was the first strawberry jam I ever made--I liked that it didn't call for pectin or anything like that. It took about 20 minutes at a full boil for it to thicken, and the skimming was a lot of work, but the final product, while not as thick as jelly, had a decent jam-like consistency and a wonderful flavor. You do not end up tasting the vinegar at all, sadly, but the pepper adds a really nice zing when I sampled this on toast. I'd definitely make it again when strawberries are cheap.
