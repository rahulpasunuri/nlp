The taste of the orange juice overwhelmed all the other flavors excluding the cardamom. I was expecting to taste more peach. It was basically a citrus orange juice "soup". It was my first time making creme fraiche and it actually really accented the "soup". But other then that I would kick up the amount of peaches used or reduce the amount of orange juice. The brown sugar and honey do counteract the acidity of the orange juice somewhat.

Made this first without cardamom since I didn't have any on hand. Chilled overnight and bought cardamom the next day, but I found the cardamom overwhelmed the soup and chose to leave it out. Have made this twice - to raves - alway using creme fraiche. Enjoy!
