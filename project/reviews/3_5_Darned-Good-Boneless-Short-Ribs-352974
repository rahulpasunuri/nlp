I made these for dinner last night and they were fast, easy and very tasty. I used my own barbecue sauce but everything else was per the recipe.

Used the rub with prime boneless short ribs from Costco. Grilled them like a steak to medium rare. Finished with a Cattlemen's BBQ sauce. They were better than a prime strip steak. Unbelievably tasty, tender, and the depth of beef flavor was amazing. Hope I can continue to get prime boneless short ribs in the future! The rub itself is great. I used about 80% smoked paprika. To the fellow that said that short ribs had to be braised to be tender - phooey! You just need prime grade meat.

We made this for the first time and that it was excellent. We forgot the BBQ sauce and it didn't even need it. Definitely will make this for guests.

Made these after I ran out of time to braise the short ribs... and they were beyond my expectations delicious! I was worried they'd be tough, but for the short time they took on the grill (compared to braising!) they were a hit on New Years Eve. Thanks so much for this recipe...this is going to be one to keep for next time for sure! I used a locally made barbeque sauce (Two Brother's from our Heinen's).

This was a phenomenal recipe. The next time we make them, my husband is going to braise a batch & finish them off on the grill while I will do them as-is (except we grill on charcoal) and we'll have a side-by side taste-test with friends who will judge!

The recipe was perfect and so tasty. Weve never made shortribs before so I was a little worried because the short ribs we had didnt look anything like the ones in the photo, ours were long and only about 3/4 to 1 inch thick. I used Sweet Hungarian Paprika but only 1/4 C because 1/2 sounded extreme and it was perfection. We also skipped the additional bbq sauce in the end opting to let people add it if they wanted to, but it wasnt necessary at all. We will definety use this again.

The rub smelled good, but it did not taste like it was meant for beef at all! It might be good on pork, but I do not think that beef should taste sweet, which is exactly what this was.

This is a great rub. I cut the pepper in half and it was perfect for our taste. I froze the leftover rub and used it on chicken and it was delicious.

Very tasty. I have a variety of dry rubs I use and found this to be as good as any. I did cut back on the black pepper as I had a guest coming who was sensitive to it, but even though she found it spicy, it wasn't overwhelming like other rubs. My other guests thought is was delicious, as did I.

What was the point of that last review? Of course it takes longer to smoke ribs than grill them but good results can come either way. I have been smoking and grilling ribs for twenty years and have a recipe very similar to this one for last minute dinner guests. It's a perfectly viable recipe. Sounds to me you don't know Jack!

I know ribs. I don't see how these could even be edible. It requires 6.5 hours at 240 degrees to smoke ribs. I wouldn't try grilling them because the they require a lot of time. When given the time an little attention, they can be wonderful. Jack Chambles

Goes well with the Ceasar Salad and a great recipe for ribs if you dont have one.

Every good griller should have a go to recipe for ribs if you enjoy ribs. If you dont have one this is a DARN GOOD ONE. The Poker Guys were mixed review on this simply because every Poker Guy has theuir own sauce and season or dry rub so there ya go. It got 3 stars but most every thing they like gets three stars, the only thing we truly missed trying was the Virginia Pruitt sauce so we had to use our own and had 6 different versions of taste variance from sweet to spicy and all good. If you dont have a recipe try this one.

Excellent! I used boneless country pork ribs also and they were outstanding. Remember that too many grill ,eisters over cook the meat. Very important with BBQ not to.

Ummmmm 2 1/2 tablespoons freshly ground what? Is the fifth ingredient supposed to be pepper. It makes sense.
