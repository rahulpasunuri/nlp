Perfect for dinner parties. Easy to make ahead of time and doesn't require you to stay in the kitchen as it reheats/crisps. Started the ragout an hour before. Rested and then re-heated while I crisped up the skin of the duck confit. The smell of duck fat was incredibly appetizing to my guests.

Fantastic! After returning from Paris this past spring, I have had a yen to make duck confit. I finally found a local vendor that sold legs and duck fat. I wanted something that really accentuated the sheer brilliance of a perfect confit, and this ragout does. A great balance of sweet and savory. I rarely go by any recipe verbatim, but I did here, and it was perfect. I did substitute a beautiful greek brandy I had since I did not have armagnac. Take the time to make your own confit, it is amazing.

I have not yet prepared this recipe. I just want A Cook from Ridgecrest, CA to know that the photo shows the duck confit the the duck fat in which it is stored, not in mashed potatoes.

The photo with this recipe is completely misleading -- this looks like duck legs with mashed potatoes! Or is something missing from the recipe, like puree the ragout? That said, the ragout is quite good. I also bought duck confit to use with this recipe. I think next time I would add more prunes and throw in a few green cardamom pods to go along with (or maybe instead of) the cloves.

This is a fantastic and relatively easy to make meal. I bought the duck confit and used brandy instead of cognac/armagnac, but it was delicious anyway. A keeper.
