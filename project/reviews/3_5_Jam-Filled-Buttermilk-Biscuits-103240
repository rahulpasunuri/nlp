These were delicious! Next time I might try making them half the size since they do spread out quite a lot. I used my fingers to create heart-shaped wells and filled with jam for a Valentine's day brunch treat!

I, too, added zest of a lemon and find that they freeze very well. Take them out half hour or so before and microwave a few seconds (but no realy need to even do this as good even at room temp)!

The biscuits were yummy & buttery! I made about 16 instead of 9 & I would suggest making what you can eat within a few hours because they don't keep very well. I had an issue with the jam sliding out & burning (ruined my cookie sheet). Next time, I will probably make the biscuits & serve the jam on the side.

Oh my! these were great! I did have a few spread out but the majority held their shape quite nicely. I might add a bit of lemon zest next time but over all a wonderful biscuit.

These biscuits are a hands-down favorite at our Bed and Breakfast! The texture and flavor of the biscuit can stand alone without jam as a non-sweet alternative. The recipe actually seems to make 11 biscuits, not 9; even so, the 11 biscuits are very large. I create the biscuits 1 day ahead and add the jam just before baking. I don't use a food processor, and they seem to come out fine mixed by hand.

I thought they came out very nice. I tried them with a brunch special and sold a ton of them. I have also made them at home for myself

These are the best biscuits I have ever made. We have a B&B on Okanagan Lake and have many repeat guests. I am always on the look out for good recipes. This one is definitely a keeper. Every time I make them guests ask for the recipe. Jean Hartman, Casa Rio Lakeside B&B. Kelowna, B.C.

I cut the amount of butter by 1/4 cup which was fine. Didn't miss it at all. I also made them smaller (18) It's a great recipe.

Best biscuits I've ever made. Reduced the size to 2 1/2" and made a total of 18 biscuits. Refrigerated the formed biscuits before baking (15Min) Used variety of homemade jams. The biscuits were high and fluffy and no jam spills.

Wow. I have never seen biscuits spread like this --to about 4 1/2". They are tasty, but not very much like biscuits.

I tried this recipe for my guests and they raved about it. I did try to make them smaller and the jam... slid off the biscuits which didn't happen when they're bigger.

Good flavor however they tend to spread out instead of rising. A bit too greasy for me but it results in a nice texture on the outside. I used canned blueberry pie filling instead of jam and liked that.
