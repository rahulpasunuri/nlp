This is a great summery chicken dish. I spatchcock the chicken for even browning and roast it on the rosemary, oregano, garlic and lemon. The salad is packed with flavor. Don't skimp on the mint, parsley and celery, they really add a wonderful dimension. Some thinly sliced red onion tastes great in there too. If I can't find favas, I use green beans or sugar snap peas cut into bite-size pieces, and they work just as well.

I made this with thighs and ate the chicken on top of brown rice. The chicken and salad were really good.

My husband is not a fan of chicken in general and he raved about this! I haven't tried the salad yet but the chicken was perfect.

What a lovely dinner! Loved the chicken, loved the salad. Slight changes: for just my husband and me, one chicken but half the salad - and we ate everything! Didn't have celery leaves, but put in some lettuce just picked from our garden. My husband doesn't like pecorino, so I used (Spanish) manchega. We've planted favas, and they should be ready in a couple of weeks. I'll make this recipe again - especially since our garden will yield the radishes, favas, arugula & even the garlic! (My husband wants a hen house so we would have our own chickens, but I've put my city-girl foot down to quash that idea!) Kudos to the chef who created this.

Indeed this is a FINE recipe! Easy, as you do everything while the chicken is roasting. YUMMY!!!

The flavors are amazing, easy to make and I can't wait to make it again. First time I'd found fresh fava beans and I love them. I can't stand radishes but they are great in the salad. In fact I might just make the salad again without the chicken....although it is equally delicious!
