I made this for a Christmas dessert and it was delicious. To simplify things, I made it in a wax paper lined bread pan. Before extracting it from the pan, I ran the whole pan under hot water and then flipped the bread pan. It came out quite neatly. I sliced and served. The layering effect from pouring the semifreddo in was beautiful. Also, after pouring the semifreddo in the lined bread pan, I poured a blackberry puree on top. It worked well. Side Note: I omitted the meringue and walnuts. The semifreddo is so creamy and the blackberries so clean - the meringue and walnuts seemed like a bad pairing.

Presentation is lovely but the taste left a lot to be desired--just not a lot of flavor. The meringue was a nice touch but overall, a lot of work for a not-so-terrific dessert. Looking forward to other opinions.

It was a delight to serve to my guests and a refreshing change. My Thanks to the creater. Maybe I can suprise him or her with one of my own delights that I threw together one night for a party of 8 and they all wanted the reciepe but I still keep it a secret. Maybe it is time to pass it on. Sincerly Judie Ohm
