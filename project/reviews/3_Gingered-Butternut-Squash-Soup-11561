I loved this recipe...I added an extra clove of garlic and a little extra ginger. I also let it simmer for awhile longer than recommended which allowed it to thicken up a little. I'll definitely be making this recipe again.

This is a great soup that is pretty healthy but you can't tell when you eat it. The ginger is subtle so feel free to throw some extra in there when you make it. It is also better if you blend it really well so it's really smooth.

Bland.

This is so easy to make. To make it creamier, while pureeing the soup I add in fat free half & half instead of the last bit of water. It's fluffy and creamy, and delicious.

It was rather bland, until I added a teaspoon of chicken stock powder and a bit of mixed herbs -- delicious!

meh. I've had better. I've had ALOT worse, but I've had better. Not crazy about the ginger-squash combo. Worked well in a crock pot just dump it all in.

What a delicious soup, and very low fat. I added a good dose of curry powder while sauteing the garlic. Nice a spicy!

Better using a can of chicken broth topped off with apple cider to make 2 cups of liquid and then not adding the extra half cup as directed. However, use low sodium broth or cut out the salt in the garlic, because otherwise it's too salty.

This was quite delicious. I used organic butternut squash that was already microwaved most of the way to done-ness, and powdered rather than fresh ginger. (I couldn't find my good ginger) Yes, the texture is baby-food-ish, but the flavor wasn't bland at all. I didn't even have to add salt.

We were looking for a butternut squash recipie and this one was easy and tasted great! A tip is to get the squash out of the shell easily put it in the microwave for a few minutes and then when eating it, add a little fresh parmesan and eat with warm crusty bread!

This recipe rocks the free world!! I make a double batch every couple of weeks and freeze. Even my fussy three-year-old eats this fantastic soup.

Delicious and the recipe is dead simple. Rave reviews from the whole family including our fussy five year old. I substituted chicken broth for the water as suggested and served it with a dollop of sour cream and minced chives. Great!

I added apple juice to thin out the soup and give it a flavour boost, otherwise it was very bland.

I must have done something wrong. I thought this was gross. I used an acorn squash instead of butternut (not sure if that has anything to do with it or not...). I, too, omitted the last bit of water but the texture was a lot like babyfood. I tried it with sour cream which made it a little better but overall...not good.

Great soup recipe...I also used chicken broth in place of water and added pureed silken tofu to give it a creamy texture and added health benefit.

I, too, omitted the final 1/2 cup of water and I substituted chicken broth for some of the water. I served it with a dollop of sour cream. Delicious!

This soup is mild with a wonderful texture. Sprinkled with a little nutmeg in each bowl, we loved every spoonful!

First time I made this it was way too watery. This time I strained out the squash from the water to put it into the blender, making it much thicker (yum!). Then I added back some water until it was the perfect thickness, and then I added the garlic and ginger. Works great with carrots instead of butternut, too.

The ginger and garlic make this soup more interesting than the other butternut squash soups I've tasted. However, the extra 1/2 cup of water isn't necessary it takes away from the flavours. I prefer a thick soup and would eliminate the extra water. The parsley adds color and flavour. Excellent soup, can't wait to make it again!
