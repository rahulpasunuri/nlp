I thought this good not great...the chicken was pretty bland despite marinating for five hours. The eggplant and onion was tasty and I added a corn salsa to go with it...without it, I think the dish would lack flavor a bit. Will probably make it again but doctor it with a can of green chiles and maybe some ground cumin.

To save time I changed the method but used the same ingredients and the amounts specified. I grilled the quesadillas on a non-stick G.E. grill-wafflemaker combo sprayed with PAM. I also used already grilled chicken breast strip pieces. To replicate the flavor, though, I stirred the marinade ingredients minus the water into the filling mixture. I made the sour cream and cilantro dipping sauce, but next time won't, as it added nothing to the flavor of the quesadillas. Despite using jack cheese with peppers, the quesadillas were very mild-tasting. If you like spicy food, I suggest putting more cilantro and jalapeno in the filling. If you're out of bread but want to fix a sandwich type meal, this recipe fits the bill. It's very good and easy to prepare.

My husband and I both enjoy this recipe, but if you like the flavor kicked up a notch, I recommend mixing a little cilantro and jalapeno into the sour cream. Also, when assembling the quesadillas, use 1/2 the cheese on the bottom and 1/2 the cheese on the top and they hold together much better.

hi everyone - this dish did not impress me. i was excited due to the reviews, but i didn't think the eggplant or roasted onions stood out - didn't really lend much flavor. also, i think that the chicken would have been more delicious if it were shredded before adding to the quesadilla, perhaps with some sauce reseved before marinating drizzled on. as for "spicey," i didn't think they had much kick at all - i ended up putting some sliced jalaenos and diced habenaros on mine for some fire. also made a simple guacamole on the side, and ended up slathering that on as well, after the first disappointing bite, along with some chopped raw onins and fresh chopped cilantro. basically, i think this recipe definetely needs doctoring up and creativity to make it memorable, wothwhile, and exciting.

Easy, quick, light and tasty. The sour cream is key to complement the flavors of the roasted veggies and jalapeno on the chicken. I ran out of tortillas and had mine "open faced," which worked out great - one quesadilla was plenty filling. I chopped fresh cilantro and sprinkled it inside the quesadillas before serving. That pushed this recipe from good to a very good regular rotation item.

Fantastic! My husband and I both loved this, and thought it tasted like something from a restaurant. I only marinaded for around 30 minutes, and I grilled the chicken and veggies. I also found that as a main course, two quesadillas was plenty. I will definitly make this again!

My husband and I LOVED this!!! I only marinated the chicken for 2 hours due to time constants. We felt that the ingredients would only serve 2 people not four so we made only 2 quesadillas.

I made this into a vegetarian entree. I increased the eggplant and onion some, and then when I assembled the tortillas, I sprinkled on the cilantro, jalepeno, and lime juice. Other than that I followed the directions and it was delicious.

This was simple and tasty. I only marinaded about 1 hour and that was fine. I cooked the eggplant and onion a little longer to get the eggplant tender. I stirred some fresh chopped cilantro into the sour cream and I thought that was what made it a 3, not a 2 fork recipe.

The recipe was simple but the flavors were simple too. Not for my taste!

this is a good recipe. I've made it several times. The first time I marinated the chicken the requisite time, but the second time I didn't have 4 hours. I just omitted that part and to tell the truth, I tasted no difference.

Very tasty. I made it as more of a main dish. I didn't broil the chicken and the veggies. I just put them all in a baking dish, tortillas on the top and bottom and baked it for about 45 min at 450 degrees. My husband and I enjoyed it. I'll be passing it along to friends and family.

These are out of this world! I didn't have the full four hours to marinate them (more like an hour and a half) - they were still very spicy and flavorful. I added extra cilantro to the quesadillas and made two large ones for a main course. I served them with black beans and a jicama salad - it was a great meal.

Was really surprised how good this recipe was. I marinated the chicken with 1/4 cup tequila instead of water. I made this recipe as a main course with refried beans and Greem Poblano rice (epicurious). Also I used 8 inch tortillas made with Jalapenos and Garlic.

The limes and jalapenos add a great flavor. Try folding the ingredients in 1 large tortilla for a main course.
