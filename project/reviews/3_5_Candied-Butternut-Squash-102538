Wow! I used 1/4 cup each granulated and brown sugar as others suggested, and instead of cloves just added a little more cinnamon. It came out delicious and not even remotely slimy - the sauce at the bottom of the pan was the best part!

Very good,, but I would try 1/2 amount of sugar mix next time. We found it overpowered the squash flavor. I used 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar & I would try a little less cloves.

Nice recipe! I used all brown sugar, and in addition to the spices listed here, threw in about 1/4 teaspoon of mace. Yeah, the syrup gets a little jelly-like... but a slotted spoon will take care of that real quick.

When this is served on top of "Cous Cous With Garbanzo Beans, Prunes and Almonds" as the chef recommended, the discussion about slimy in the reviews below will will go away. We found that the sweet flavors of the squash went beautifully with the all the good smells, tastes, and textures of the cous cous. We loved it. This was part of a dinner that included Moroccan-Style Cornish Game Hens so we were doing the whole North Africa thing. A very special dinner!

Go with the ingredients and texture - don't bother with this one. Too slimy-and even though I cut the cloves in half or less, too clovey. The best way to prepare butternut squash is to slice in half, lengthwise, top with a blop of brown sugar, cinnamon to taste, a blop of butter, and microwave for a few minutes or bake with your other offerings until soft and brown. That way you can at least scoop it out and eat some of the skin for fiber or not. This is way too slimy. YUCK.

Had this for Thanksgiving and what a delight! Push aside those oversweet yams and delve into this instead.

I used local pumpkin and yes it turned out a little slimy for me too. But that wasn't the issue. It was just rather odd to be having something so sweet and dessert-like as a side dish. I had leftovers which I'm gonna turn into a pumpkin crumble!

Finally found a recipe for squash that makes me like it! Used 1/4 cup granulated & 1/4 brown sugar as suggested & it was delicious. Do use ground cloves as they make the dish (& I don't even like cloves!)

This dish was awfully slimy - it was kind of embarassing to serve it to guests. The flavor was okay, but I've made better butternut squash.

Deliciously sweet and tasty. Im 21 and its the best way I have ever seen to get young people to eat a seasonal veg like squash.

Very tasty and simple. Came out even sweeter than I anticipated... very much like pumpkin pie. Guests LOVED it.

Heavenly!!! Incredibly delicious and quite easy. I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. I didn't have any cloves in my cubbard, so I used a pinch of nutmeg. It was so good, I'll do it the same way next time. BE SURE TO SERVE THIS DISH HOT FOR BEST RESULTS.

I too reduced the amount of sugar and used brown sugar only. I had eight poeple in for Thanksgiving dinner yesterday and served this as a side dish. Several people told me they didn't know squash could be this good.

Made this last night and my husband loved it. I used 1/4 cup white and 1/4 cup brown sugar and it was perfect. Will definitely make this again.

My family loved this side dish, it was really too sweet for my liking though. But, at least it got my 8 yr. old to eat squash! My husband thought we should have it on T-giving. Easy if you use the packaged precut and peeled butternut squash that they sell in the produce section now. A keeper, good for a weeknight, served with the mustard crusted pork chops on this site.

I have had trouble finding good squash down south, but with this recipe I even had the squash haters asking for more. I replaced the sugar with brown sugar to boost the flavor and served it as a side to apple, currant and caraway stuffed chicken breasts. Excellent last night and the leftovers are good today.

Well, it was very tasty, but the syrup had a very strange, rather mucous-like consistency. I'm assuming it was because of the cinnamon; I've noticed that cinnamon has a tendency to turn sort of weirdly gelid when more than a tiny sprinkle is mixed with anything liquidy, and I'm wondering if the fact that I cut the sugar by about a quarter cup while keeping the spices the same threw something off. Still, the squash *was* good, and I would make it again, though maybe with less cinnamon.

Really yummy! The only hard part is peeling the squash. My fiancee wanted thirds...

Guests raved about this, and even I thought that it tasted well. However, this dish has to be eaten hot. If it stands on the table too long, the squash pieces seem to shrivel up and the appearance goes downhill from there.

I made this last year at Thanksgiving and it was a hit, so I am going to be making it this year for Christmas. This dish beats candied yams anyday.

I nixed the cloves but used some grated nutmeg. A terrific side dish that sweetly rounds out a savory meal.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. I took the advice of the other reviewers and used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 granulated sugar. It was perfect. Anymore sugar and it would have been too sweet. My only advice is to use a big enough baking pan to give you enough room to stir while cooking.

Definitely would make this again, although I did think it was a bit too sweet also. Use brown sugar instead of the white - makes for a better result.

I love this dish. It's something a little more fancy than the usual veggie dish, but not complicated at all.

This was so good even teenagers ate it & liked it. I also used 1/4 brown sugar + 1/4 granulated sugar. I would definitely make this again.

Very good... I used 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar because of reviewers comments about sweetness. I served it at a dinner party and it was a big hit!

Yes, this was very sweet - could almost serve as a dessert - but absolutely delicious. I used 1/2 cup granulated sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. This would be wonderful with the Thanksgiving turkey.
