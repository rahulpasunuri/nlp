For 1 lb of shrimp, I used only 1 Tbs of oil mixed with the breadcrumbs and 1 tsp. sprinkled on top. Also used 4 cloves of garlic. Really Yummy.

I made this several times for company and it always comes out delicious! Everyone loves it and you can prepare everything beforehand and spend time with your friends. Also, it's a nice change from scampi or grilled shrimp.

You can never use too much garlic! Easy and quick for a weeknight with what's on hand. Heated the pan a bit with Spanish smoked paprika in the oil, let it cool a bit, added shrimp and made the recipe as suggested (more garlic and some dried chives extra), for one person. Didn't have lemons but splashed some lemon juice over at the end. I did 450 but took it out at 8 minutes, since my shrimp were small, and let it sit a minute or two.. Very tasty and will make again, can see this over pasta.

this is a lovely recipe. for a spur of the moment meal i made the shrimp with fresh garlic but with seasoned packaged breadcrumbs. i used butterflied shrimp in the shells and found it easier to stuff the shrimp with the breadcrumbs. it also made for a pretty presentation and cooked this way the shrimp seemed moister than usual. be careful to check the shrimp as they seem to cook faster than the recipe suggests. .

Easy, delicious, beautiful dish. Read previous reviews and made following alterations: oven temp 400, baked 8 minutes and let set 2-3 minutes (cooks more from hot baking dish), added hot pepper flakes and 4 cloves of garlic. Lemon wedges make it WOW. Enjoy.

I always cook recipes per the reviews, rarely making anything exactly as written, so I made sure to amp up the garlic and add a few other Italian herbs, not having fresh parsley on hand. Cooked at a lower temp for 10 minutes, which was perfect. Fresh breadcrumbs and squeeze of lemon are a must! Very, very nice! Easy and quick.

These are wonderful. I served with a mixed green salad, sprinkled with black olives, thinly sliced avocado fanned on salad, and a fried sesame goat cheese round. I topped the salad with a light balsamic dressing and put the shrimp around the outside of the salad plate. A gastronomical treat!

Very tasty and easy to make. I used 4 cloves of garlic and it was perfect. I served as an appy but would be a nice main meal dish.

This recipe was delicious! I didn't have parsley on hand, so I omitted it, and broiled it instead of baking it, to ensure the shrimp didn't over cook. I served these over a "pasta" dish made with spaghetti squash tossed with pesto, roasted cherry tomatoes and Parmesan cheese, and they were the perfect pairing!

This was wonderful. I served it with a goat cheese salad and put the shrimp around the outside of the salad. Great presentation. My changes were using panko instead of fresh bread crumbs and also added red pepper flakes. Will make this often!

Very good, but I would broil the shrimp next time. Baking for 10 minutes overcooked the shrimp by a bit.

I loved this recipe and so did my family. I did make a few changes though. I used dried parsley and a whole lot of garlic. Another review said it best "there is no such thing as only adding one clove of garlic". I used 4 cloves and it came out great. I will add this one to my regular rotation. NOt only does it taste great, but its healty too!!!!!

Amazing and couldn't be easier! I made the suggested changes, using Panko, lemon zest and pepper flakes. Remember that the cast iron frying pan is hot after coming out of the oven!

This was quick, easy and very tasty. The crumb mixture complimented the shrimp very well. The only deviations to recipe I made were adding more garlic and used just a bit of red pepper flakes to the crumb mixture. It was suggested by another reviewer and was right on the mark. This is a keeper recipe that will please any dinner guest. Absolutely delish!!!

This dish was just so-so but makes for an easy and quick weeknight meal. I also added extra garlic and a little red pepper to the bread crumbs. Served it with cauliflower with grated cheese and a salad.

Like 90% of all Epicurious readers, I had to mess with this recipe. Short on parsley, I augmented with some cilantro and I added a buttload more garlic. (ONE clove of garlic? That's an oxymoron if there ever was one...) I made it in a cast iron skillet and ran it under the broiler at the end to toast the bread crumbs more. If I made it again I would add some hot pepper flakes, but otherwise it was great!

I am also a person who is in love with shrimp, and this was a mighty good dish. I bought these huge, beautiful shrimps at the local dock, and served them with some pesto pasta. What an evening.

I am thinking about trying this recipe for a dinner party we are having this weekend. I looked very carefully at the picture and do not see any shrimp, but I do see pomegranite seeds as well as spanish rice, so I am guessing this photo goes with another recipe altogether. Thanks for all the tips, I will try the fresh oregano and maybe even sea scallops as well!

I lived in Italy - Italians would never use cheese with seafood, not even on pasta. If you need "bite", add some pepperoncini - dried hot pepper flakes. The method of preparation described here makes an elegant dish, but it works well if you just saute the shrimp on high heat with the crumb mixture and a little lemon zest. One of our neighbors in Rome made it like this for my wife and I. She added a large pinch of hot pepper flakes to the pan. Spoon the shrimp and crumbs directly from the saute pan onto the plate and serve with lemon wedge.

I too was confused by the picture, but followed the recipe and ended up with a delightful, light dinner. This would be a great appetizer. I did add a bit of parmesan and a little more garlic.

I used a good olive oil and made to sure to add the lemon as other cooks suggested, I also added a little bit of Parmesan cheese. Sorry to be the wet blanket but this was bland and a waste of good shrimp, would not make again.

I've been eating this since I was born and have made it many ways: baked, broiled, even grilled on skewers made of rosemary branches presoaked in a bit of water so as not to burn. (I like this method best for the summer). Add a bit of lemon zest to the marinade or hot pepper flakes to kick it up. It's wonderful served atop a bed of soft lettuce greens with a mild lemon vinaigrette and a creamy risotto on the side. Open a bottle of an oaky chardonay - YUM!

It was good, but I was confused by the picture. It looked as though the shrimp was layered. The instructions said "single layer". Help! I like this dish. I want to make it again, but I'm confused by this issue.

Made this for a birthday dinner Saturday night. Also used Panko bread crumbs and sea scallops along with the shrimp. Everyone loved it!!!

Honestly, I thought this recipe couldn't be as good as all the reviewers said...but it is!! You need to use fresh breadcrumbs or Panko for this recipe to taste as it should. The dish feels light, yet is very flavorful. I realized I didn't have fresh parsley after shelling the shrimp, so I had to modify (normally I won't, but I had to!) I used 1 TBSP dried parsley, put it in my 1/3 c. measuring cup and added fresh oregano, thyme & dill to make 1/3 c. total. It was great!

I cut the recipe in thirds and followed, except for more garlic. The first bite was nice, by the end, we were practically panting with joy. Will definitely make again and often.

I made this last night for dinner and used the extra jumbo shrimp (4-6 count) and also mixed in some scallops. It was delicious. Had the leftovers for lunch. Oh and I used 3 garlic cloves vs just 1.

I made this for a Christmas party and took someone's suggestion of adding fresh oregano and grated parmesan cheese. I served it over Pesto Orzo and it was delicious. Everyone raved. Ate the leftovers cold the next day and it was like a wonderful pasta salad. Will make this many times.

This appetizer was so delicious. I used 3/4 cup of Panko (japanese breadcrumbs) and 1/4 cup italian breadcrumbs. If you have never used panko you should try it. I also rolled the shrimp in the breadcrumbs instead of putting them on top. The panko gave it a light crispy texture and everyone wanted the recipe. This one goes into my keep until I die file.

Very simple to prepare and the flavor is wonderful. Don't skimp on the olive oil. Use the best you can afford and make sure the crumbs are well moistened. And be careful not to overcook. I used large shrimp and 10 minutes was just right.

This was really great and really easy. I used the frozen shrimp from Trader Joes - they're not large, but it worked. I added the cheese and the oregano (dried) like someone suggested. I also served it over orzo. It was chilly last night, so it made for a great warm meal. Excellent!!!

I used medium shrimp instead and I think it would have been better if I'd used large as written - I ended up with too much bread-crumb topping. That said, this was easy to put together and the flavors were really nice. I like the previous reviewer's idea of adding Parmesan, which would give it some extra dimension.

I first made this with fresh bread crumbs and it was perfect. The second time I tried dried bread crumbs as a quick easy substitute and it wasn't nearly as good. Do yourself a favor and stick with the fresh.
