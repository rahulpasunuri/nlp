Yum! So good! Come on people...let's not get all nutty over production kitchens and panini presses...grow up! Assemble it best as you can, throw it in an iron skillet w/ a little butter/smidge of olive oil. Cover the bottom of another iron skillet, brick, what have you and press it down, flip it when it's browned on one side. Eat and enjoy every gooey basil-y, tomatoe-y, cheesy yumminess. Be sure to make the mmmmm sound to magnify the happy moment of eating.

This was a letdown for us. I thought it would be great because we are huge fans of caprese salads. It just didn't measure up to good ol' tomato with aged Vermont cheddar grilled on whole grain bread.

This delicious if your atreries can handle it. It is the most cholestrol loaded, salty sandwich you can imagine.

I don't have a production kitchen (yes, I'm hatin') so I made this sandwich on my Cuisinart Griddler using the Panini setting and it was delicious. I did add thinly sliced red onions and I put my tomatoes on the sandwiches a few minutes before the end of their time on the press so they were warm and gooey with the cheese...yum!

Working in a production kitchen I modified this recipe. I took some clarified butter and placed it on my griddle and put the pieces of bread on top of that. I then layered the bread with the basil leaves. Taking the tomato slices spread out on a spatula I topped them with fresh sliced mozzarella, shredded asiago, shredded parmesan, grated pecorino romano cheese, and red pepper flakes and melted it under the salamander. I took the prosciutto and heated it up on the flat top and placed it on the bread with the basil leaves and then topped that with the tomatoes and cheese. Served with this soup (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/fo od/views/Roasted-Tomato-Soup-with- Garlic-5102) using the modifications I mentioned in that review, I sold out of this combo as a special in no time flat and still hear raves about it.

I really liked this - a very adult grilled cheese. Served with a roasted tomato and garlic bisque. Only suggestion? Buy quality sliced sourdough. I can't seem to get uniformly 1/3 inch slices when I do it free-hand. So, some of my slices got sort of soggy from my juicy tomatoes.

It was so-so. I used fresh mozzerella. I wished I had a pannini press to grill it. I had trouble getting my cheese to melt properly...Some sort of balsamic vinegar sauce would have gone nicely...

Using artisan, high quality sourdough was KEY to the deliciousness of this sandwich! I would not change a thing about this recipe, it's fabulous. If you want to or need to omit the prosciutto, make sure to lightly salt the sandwich (esp if using mozz cheese) to make up for the seasoning. The crushed red pepper flakes were a surprisingly terrific addition. Heirlooms weren't currently in season, so I used organic, vine- ripened tomatoes instead, and it was wonderful. Try this sophisticated, bistro-style grilled cheese and you'll have lots of raves from happy eaters!

Asiago cheese is a must on this one but good fresh basil puts it over the top. I've made these a few times now and gotten rave reviews each time!

Yum, Yum, Yum. I've entertained twice with this one, including dinner with the in-laws. I used the softer asiago and omitted the extra salt as the cheese and proscuitto were salty enough. Best grilled cheese ever!

Funny, I like all these ingredients and think Boulevard is a marvelous restaurant but this sandwich just didn't do it for us.

These were wonderful! A friend was coming to dinner, and asked me to "keep it simple". This was great to serve with tomato soup for a cold evening.

Actually, I am making this one again this week! Fresh Mozzarella is key, as well as the basil! this was so good at a casual dinner party I had.
