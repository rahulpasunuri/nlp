This recipe was fantastic. I didn't add the sour cream to the cauliflower and served the puree hot with anchovies instead of caviar. I will definately make this again.

Very simple to make, and very satisfying to eat. I didn't bother with the cloverleaf shapes, just sliced the potatoes into thin rounds. The mild cauliflower taste goes beautifully with the cavier and is a nice surprise for people who assume they've been served a dollop of sour cream!
