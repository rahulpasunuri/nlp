While this recipe turned out OK it was not the most well planned out recipe I've made. I tripled the liquid ingredients, reduced the shallots by about 1/3 and added some white wine (I also left out the cilantro). I served the chicken atop orzo pasta with sauted mushrooms and spooned plenty of sauce over the entire dish. It was pretty good that way.

My version of this recipe came out very nice! I agree with the others that the original recipe calls for too much shallot. I used about half that it called for. I then used a combination of chicken broth and dry sherry instead of the vinegar. While this recipe STILL had a powerful shallot taste, it was wonderful served with mashed potatoes. Accompanied with Fresh green beans, this made a VERY NICE meal. I would make it again.

I didn't have any shallots, so I used green onions (scallions) instead. In that case, I guess I'm not really rating this recipe as is, but with the changes I made. Well, with the green onions this recipe was really very, very good! I would say whether with shallots or green onions, using a very good Sherry wine vinegar (not cheap!) is a must. It makes a pretty big difference in the acidity level of the final product. Since we loved this dish with the green onions so much I'm sure that is what I will use next time I make this. Very pretty with all the green, sprinkled over the chicken, also.

I served this a while ago, and I can't remember it being as bad as some of these reviews say. Maybe we were drunk, but there were no leftovers!

I made this for a dinner party just last weekend, it got RAVE reviews. I could not believe how many shallots the recipe called for but my guests ate every last one. The marinade with the grated shallots provided an excellent crust when sauteed. Use a cheese grater to get the shallots to a pulp-like consistency. Also add 1Tb honey to the vinegarette to cut the tartness. Served with asparagus steamed with lemon slices and lemon couscous this was a hit!!

I forgot to add some of the shallots -- but my whole family loved it! Served with the lemon couscous.

This is afabulous recipe to serve for a luncheon. We served a wild/brown rice dish, and a fruit salad with it. Everyone was in heaven!!

I would suggest trying this recipe: MME. LASCOURREGES'S CHICKEN WITH SHALLOTS. It's great, a little simpler than this one, and has good reviews. I have made it several times. Read reviewer comments first for other suggestions first.

Too bad people took the time to make this recipe. I could just tell by the large amount of shallots that it wouldn't fly.

Way too much work for a dissapointing result. The shallots were overpowering and the chicken was nondescript. I am going to go chew on my slippers now.

Tried to spice this up with white wine. Did not really help. I was going to serve this for guests but ended up ordering Chinese (always try first). Even my pets were not crazy about the leftovers. Recommend you trash this recipe unless you are a terrible cook (as it is relatively easy to prepare). Then again, my dense brother would love this - he has no taste (and his fiancee is even worse - she can't even boil water anyway!)

We were also disappointed with the end result for the amount of effort that was put in. Also, confused by the amount of shallots the recipe called for, we left out I'd say 3 or 4 and it was still strong enough. Tried it with the carrot, pea and lemon cous cous and was pretty much dissapointed with that too. Oh well...

I was disappointed with this one. Served it for company along with yellow pepper risotto and sauteed asparagus. The shallot flavour is predominant and it is just not that interesting and not worth the effort.
