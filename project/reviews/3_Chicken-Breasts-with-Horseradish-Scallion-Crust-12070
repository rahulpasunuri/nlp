Great flavor and a welcome change from the 'routine' chicken recipes. Very easy prep -- good for company or quick family meal. Chicken was moist. I made some minor changes -- used sour cream instead of mayo, upped the amount of garlic, green onions and horseradish and used panko bread crumbs. I used boneless skinless chicken breast so I needed to add a little oil to the bread crumb mixture. Will definitely make again. I also think this would be good on fish.

Love it. Made it with boneless, skinless chicken breasts and used panko the first time. I have also made with salmon. I always under cook an extra portion so I can pack it for lunch the next day.

I happened to serve a salad with a simple balsamic dressing (basically just a very thick balsamic vinegar with a little dijon mustard, to complement the dijon in the recipe, and some sweetening and salt and pepper) on the same plate as the chicken. We decided that the chicken tasted good dipped in the balsamic, so another option for this recipe might be a simple balsamic sauce to go with it, or to just deliberately serve it with such a salad to save a sauce-making step. Like others, I may cut back on the tarragon next time, as it intensified during cooking. Also, I did mine with plain, boneless skinless chicken breasts, and they were nice. No sense caking this nice topping on top of skin. A healthier option still would be to substitute bran or other things for some or all of the breadcrumbs next time. I found that ANY added salt was a mistake, as the horseradish carried such a salty effect into the coating, so I will eliminate that next time.

I made this for Passover using matzo meal instead of bread crumbs. It was an amazing addition to my family's Passover recipe box. I doubled the mustard/mayo sauce and the matzo meal/horseradish mix and served with 1.5 lbs of chicken. Will definitely make this again next Passover -- and will try it again with bread crumbs now that Passover has ended.

I made this while on vacation with my family. Everyone LOVED it. The only thing I did differently was substitute finely chopped (or grated) white onion for the scallions.

This made it into the rotation. We liked its combination of textures, with the crispy bread crust over the creamy mustard and mayonnaise topping, as well as its combination of flavors.

We've had this several times now. It's a keeper. Now I'm wondering if it would work on fish? Hmmmmmm?

Easy and different. My fiancee loved it. I followed previous advice and substituted sour cream for mayo, the chicken was supermoist.

This was a good chicken dish if you're looking for a slight change from the norm. Just make sure you like the flavor of tarragon because it features strongly in this dish. Quick, easy, and tasty.

Not very tasty in my book. The flavor combinations came out very generic; it tastes exactly how you think it will. Skip it.

Not at all bad. Next time I think I'll try the low fat sour cream instead of the mayo, as I would like this to be a slightly healthier recipe. But not hard, and fairly yummy.

Rating: 3
very good, if a little strange. the one thing I did differently was to deglaze the pan with a 1/2 cup of white wine after I sauted the onions and garlic. oh, and lots more green onions and garlic just because we had a bunch. but all and all a damn good meal.

I was searching for something a little different when I came across this recipe. I made a couple substitutions; was out of scallions and mayo so used about a 1/4 cut finely diced onion, and sour cream. Otherwise i made it as written. The results were quite good. The boyfriend loved this recipe!! He took the leftovers to work the next day, and said reheated was even better. The only thing I would do differently next time is 1)pound the chicken breasts a little flatter, (maybe 1/2 an inch) to create more surface area for the crust and 2) use a bit more horseradish. I think this crust would also be great on a firm white fish.

I was disappointed. Though the chicken came out juicy and the coating was ok overall the dish was not impressive.

I am always looking for new chicken recipes - this one was really great! The chicken was actually tender - we loved it.

Based on feedback from another reviewer, I used soy sourcream (don't eat dairy), instead of mayo. I also eliminated the sautee step with the chicken. I sauteed the scallions and then added the rest. If the breadcrumbs are a bit dry, you can add a little more olive oil. Then I just spread the sauce on top, added the breadcrumbs, and baked it. I did use chicken cutlets, which cuts down on the baking time. My guests, for whom I've cooked often, raved and thought it was one of the best things I've ever made. Not difficult or time consuming at all.

Loved this recipe! It's so quick and easy to make and it tastes great. Really low calorie if you substitute Sour Cream for the Mayo.

WE LOVED IT, BUT I ALWAYS IMPROVISE ON RECIPES. I USED A GARLIC PEPPER TO SEASON THE CHICKEN WHILE BROWNING(GOOD AND BROWN). INCREASED THE GARLIC, DIJON, SCALLIONS, NORMAL ON HORSERADISH. ADDED SMALL AMOUNT WHITE COOKING WINE TO SCALLIONS AND GARLIC. THREE VERY PCIKY KIDS AND MOTHER ALL LOVED IT! WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THIS RECIPE(MY WAY)

Simple and yummy- I used thinly sliced boneless pork chops instead of the chicken and added a little extra horseradish. It really was good. I served it with mashed sweet potatoes and a leek and horseradish "pie" that is also on this site. I can't wait to try it with chicken!

This recipe just didn't do anything for us. There are so many good chicken dishes out there; we probably won't make this again.

This is a great recipe and has become one of my standards. Even the hubby who likes neither chicken nor horse radish (or so he says!) thinks this is a good one. I think it is a snap in a pinch as most of the ingredients one would have in their fridge. On the mayo vs. sour cream debate: are people who say this is too rich with the mayo using horse radish SAUCE? I sent my husband to the store to pick up some horse radish and instead of the little jar of the pulverized horse radish root, he came back with a squeeze bottle that had some kind of horse radish and mayo mixture in it. If a cook mistakes these two things he or she would be doubling the mayo... too rich for even this mayo lover. Just a thought. I like the sour cream as much as the mayo and often do half and half.

This was a hit in our house! Very tasty and juicy! I followed the suggestion of the other cooks and used sour cream instead of mayo. I also breaded both sides. It turned out great. I will definitely make this one again!

If you don't like this recipe, you obviously don't like horseradish. Everyone we have made it for, loves the pungent taste you get from the horseradish. We increased the amount of mustard, garlic and horseradish, decreased the mayo, used skinless, boneless chicken breasts and decreased the cooking time in the skillet so the chicken would remain tender. This is a quick and easy recipe, and as written in a previous comment, you usually have all the ingredients on hand. Also, if you use light mayo, it is fairly low cal.

I'm not really clear on why so many people liked this recipe. I like all the ingredients, but none of them blended together at all. My fiancee who likes everything, ran out of delicate ways of suggesting that it didn't work, and ended up telling me it was just bad. I won't make it again.

I followed the suggestions on increasing the horseradish and mustard and using skinless chicken breasts. It was absolutely fabulous. One of the best chicken dishes ever.

I made this for dinner guests and it was a huge hit. A couple of the guests ended up picking at the cooking sheet for crumbs. The chicken was moist and the the crust was delicious. Definetly will make this repeatedly. A little bit of a hassle if making dish for more than 2 people and can be messy, but otherwise I highly recommend this dish if you're looking for a new flavorful, chicken dish.

First, I must that I would never consider making this recipe as written, as I despise mayo. Glad I read the suggestion of write who subbed sour cream. I used that and skinless breast, extra garlic and horseradish and also breaded top and bottom. Wow! Prepared this way, this was the best meal we have had in a recent cooking binge [new recipes 4 or 5 times a week for the last two months]. If orig recipe was written with sour cream instead of mayo would have been a four forker, hands down.

This has turned out to be one of our all time favorites. We just call it "special chicken" not so much as the preparation, which is dead easy, but becase it uses more mayonaise than we usually use. Everyone, has asked for the recipe. We, too use more dijon, horseradish and garlic, and I usually try to use 1/2 not fat mayo with regular mayo. The great thing is that we always have all the ingredients. I make it last night for a spur of the moment dish, and it was again a raving success! I think the recipe is going to Switzerland!

I made a big pile of ths dish for a family gathering. It's an easy and versatile recipe, and you don't even have to measure any of the stuff in it--great for making larger batches. I love horseradish, so I used considerably more than recommended. Taking the suggestion of another reviewer, I used light sour cream instead of mayo. One thing you may have to do though, is broil the dish for a few extra minutes so that the bread crumbs get brown. I served it with steamed string beans and Israeli cous cous with mushromms and onions, and the meal got rave reviews!

Ohhhh, I love this!! 3 forks as written, 4 forks with my modifications below. I already know I will be making this many, many times in the future. It's too easy and yet tastes so good! I use skinless breasts. Yes, there is tons of mayo to spread on, but it is important in retaining moisture; I prefer to replace it with fat-free sour cream. On a lazier day, I will try Dijonnaise. Like another reviewer, I browned the skinless chicken for 3 mins/side. And Pam works fine instead of oil. Like another reviewer, I prefer a stronger flavor. I increase the Dijon to 2.25 t and the horseradish to 3 T. I also double the scallions, garlic, and tarragon. Finally, I remove the skillet from the heat source before adding the garlic so it won't burn.

I thought this was delicious! It was easy to make, but it tasted complicated.

This is a favorite recipe of ours. However, we have made the following changes. I use boneless skinless breasts. I only cook the breasts for 3min on each side. I add about a teaspoon more olive oil when I sauté the scallions, this compensates for the extra grease the chicken skin would have added. I also do not use as much mayo & mustard I just put a thin coat on each breast. I also use good quality canned whole wheat bread crumbs I have also used plain old canned bread crumbs. We typically serve this dish with garlic mashed potatoes & peas.

Interesting to see the mixed reviews! I've made this dish about a thousand times, always for company, and it has always received raves. I've never used anything but boneless, skinless breasts, and never had a problem with them drying out. The recipe provides for more of the mayo-mustard element than you need, unless you glop it on till it's dribbling down the sides. But it's just wonderful: tangy, moist, and flavorful!

Made this for my husband's birthday dinner recently. We all enjoyed it--moist chicken,very tangy and different. However, personally, I felt the proportions were off, with way too much mayonnaise, making it much too "rich" for my taste. Probably won't bother with it again.

My husband LOVES horseradish! I think it is tasty and unusual, since I always associate horseradish with beef. I used skinless chicken and coated both sides in the crumb mixture.

Worked out well for me. I didn't quite need to brown the breasts for a full 10 minutes and the chicken came out great. I find it harder to overcook the breasts when there's still skin on them. Couldn't really detect the scallions, though.

Moist, flavorful, and delicious! I've made it several times....I can only suppose the "person" who didn't like it eats plain mashed potatoes and plain, unseasoned, flavorless chicken...oh well....that one doesn't know what he's missing...so don't listen to him, listen to me OK?

On the first go-around, this dish proved to be quite tasty -- though we used boneless SKINLESS chicken breasts, which added to the dry quality of the crust. Next time we cook this recipe, a trip to the butcher will be worth it! Jeff believes the mayonnaise made it a bit too rich. Not me! I liked it! We wholeheartedly recommend this dish!!

Horrid. Truly horrid. I spent more time cleaning the junk off the chicken than I spent cooking it.
