So creamy and tasty! I picked up some Japanese turnips at my local farmer's market at the advice of the farmer and this recipe was perfect. I had some sake lying around so I added it to the glaze at the end- yum.

Excellent! Just made and the liquid worked out fine for me. Maybe the skillet is the key?

Loved this! Miso and butter add just the right amount of umami and richness to the turnips, which get luxuriously creamy and sweet on their own. This was my first time cooking turnip greens (and maybe second time cooking actual turnips), so I'm glad I didn't discard the tops at the market! I would use less water though.. I had to pour some out so that I would get more of a glaze, rather than soup. Also used red miso b/c I didn't have white on hand, and it still tasted great.

I love this recipe. I've made it many times and get enough of that miso butter! When I can't find the Japanese turnips I use regular purple turnips. I peel and quarter them and substitute fresh spinach for the greens. An excellent side dish, especially with salmon.

It wasn't bad, but nothing I will make again. I followed the recipe as is, except that I only had turnip roots, no greens. I felt that the miso overpowered the turnip flavor.

Delicious!! I love the combination of flavors, goes great with baked tofu and rice. However, I will use a lot less water next time. The greens released a lot of water so boiling down the liquid to a glaze took very long - I had to do it in a separate pot to not overcook the veggies. Other than that I wouldn't change anything and I will definitely add miso butter to many more dishes since it's so good.

Easy and delicious. I didn't have turnip greens so I used chrysanthemum greens. Very good. Went well with teriyaki salmon.

I didn't really like this recipe. My mom thought it was okay. The butter and miso combo wasn't to my liking.

This recipe is great. The turnips were creamy, the greens just right, and the flavor combination was awesome. Our Japanese turnips were very fresh, so that may make a difference. We used a butter substitute because my husband can't eat dairy and it still turned out great.

the sauce was pleasant, but we did not like the turnips.

Very tasty and easy. This was the first time that I cooked turnips (and also my first time using mirin and miso paste!) and it turned out really, really well. Very tasty, I'll make it again. Use the miso butter sparingly - I used too much. Also, you can probably eliminate the salt from the boiling water as the mirin and miso add salt.

Fabulous. A new standby for turnips but also for whatever veggies we have lying around. My turnip greens were looking wilty so I threw in escarole instead and it was delicious.

excellent - tasted great even though it didn't end up looking very glazed - may try again with other similar veggies

I was disappointed with this recipe. The turnips were perfectly cooked, but the miso butter was a bit too intense. If I make it again, I'll use a more mild miso and add some warm water to thin it out.

I hate to admit it - because I used high-quality Japanese turnips from an organic market - but I think the delicious sauce, and not the flavor of the turnips, makes this dish. It was lick-the-bowl good.

Turnips are naturally bitter, and the miso, butter, and mirin are just the thing to counter that bitterness. I found myself licking the spoon I used to stir the turnips around -- to me, that's the sign of a good recipe. I used somewhat larger turnips, so I actually sliced them into 8ths, and they were done after fifteen minutes as the recipe predicts. Will definitely make this again.

Can't say it was a four forker for me--the turnips had a somewhat bitter note to them--and overall, the dish seemed lacking. If I made it again--I think I might add in additional cup or two of miso broth at the end--and parhaps some tiny shrimp--or gyoza dumplings--and make it more of a soup.

Butter is a rare ingredient in traditional Japanese cooking but it went so well with the miso and really added an extra depth to the flavor of this dish. Very easy too. I'll make it again when we get another crop of fresh Japanese turnips from our garden.

I had a bunch of Japanese turnips that I had no idea what to do with, and this recipe was most definitely the answer. I definitely didn't have 3 pounds of them, or probably even an entire pound so my estimations of other ingredients could have been off, but this was delicious! I'll definitely be making again, perhaps as a side for a fancy dinner party. The greens were delicious and I loved the miso butter. Excellent!

This is the best turnip recipe. I was about to give up on ever liking turnips, but then this recipe came along. Now I love them and I think I will look no further and just eat turnips this way forever. Thank you!
