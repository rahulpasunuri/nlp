My Mom always roasted our Thanksgiving turkey in a paper grocery bag. But, she was told there were chemicals used in the making of the paper bags, which could leach into the food. So she stopped using them. With the amount of chemicals already in our food, I don't think I would use this method.

This recipe really made me curious. Unfortunately I was disappointed. My whole house smelled and still smells like toasted paper sack. The chicken also was not as moist as I hoped for and it didn't have any flavor. It sounded great in theory.

Why would want to use a bag of any kind? There's nothing more important than using a thermometer when cooking the perfect chicken. I use a probe that has the digital information displayed outside the oven.

I agree with other reviewers that a brown bag may not be any safer than cooking bags made of plastic. I have never needed to use anything other than salt, pepper, sprigs of rosemary and a fine coating of olive oil, yes, olive oil, and I get a beautifully golden brown bird. As another reviewer stated, bags were in vogue because we didn't have continuous clean, self-cleaning or oven cleaners. Forget the bag and enjoy roasting the old fashioned way.

I have to agree with the other comments. I pulled this from a public health department that references the USDA. Brown paper bags for cooking... Here's what the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) says about this practice: "Do not use brown paper bags from grocery or other stores for cooking. They are not sanitary, may cause a fire, and can emit toxic fumes. Intense heat may cause a bag to ignite, causing a fire in the oven... . The ink, glue, and recycled materials in paper bags can emit toxic fumes when they are exposed to heat. Instead, use purchased oven cooking bags." www.fsis.usda.gov/OA/pubs/altroute.htm USDA also advises, "These bags may not necessarily be sanitary, particularly since they may be stored under a variety of conditions." www.fsis.usda.gov/oa/pubs/meatpack.htm

People, grow up, and stop insulting the chef --- in the South, we've been cooking proteins and even apple pie in paper bags for generations, and no one has died from it yet. We're more likely to die from the heat and humidity. We Southerners drain our fried foods on paper bags, as well. Haven't read an obituary concerning that one either. You should be more concerned about the mystery ingredients you're feeding your kids in Happy Meals at McDonalds, than about getting all bent out of shape over a silly paper bag.

The reason your Momma used a bag was to keep her oven clean from spattering fat. Now a days with self cleaning, there's no need for the bag. The aroma of a roasting chicken is enough to trigger memories of better days.

At the suggestion of my roommate I tried this (not having seen this recipe or reviews)and the smell of the paper bag in the oven was horrible! Usually a chicken baking smells incredible. It never occurred to me about the chemicals. Good thing my roommate ate most of it.

This is an interesting thread on the chemicals in the paper bags. I have had success with roasting on a vertical frame. I do want to try this recipe, and I will try it using cooking parchment paper, which I am more comfortable using with my food.

I've made oven roasted chicken for years and have never found a need to use a plastic or paper bag. It gets moist on its own. The Hungarian paprika sounds like an interesting touch, though.

I agree with the other two comments, EEEEKKK!! Chemicals in bags -no way I will do that!! I just had to add my comment for this bag recipe even though I don't' normally leave comments for recipes I have not tried. For a much safer way too cook chicken try this recipe on this site the method works well it's called "My Favorite Simple Roast Chicken" Recipe is by renowned Chef 'Thomas Keller'.

Forget the bag. Just roast in an open pan at 480f for 50-60 mins. The skin will crisp up and you can do away with all the chemicals in the bag, paper or plastic!

I was thinking the same thing as the San Francisco cook! Who knows what is in those bags as they are not created for cooking!

Just make sure you can find a brown paper bag that does not have any chemicals in it. They all do now and, yuk, who wants that in their food!
