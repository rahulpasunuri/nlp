I can understand why most people loved this recipe...however if you love veggies..and in particular, brussel sprouts...then this recipe is NOT for you! Frankly, the 'sauce' tasted more like glue to me than sauce....and totally masked the true clean veggie flavors...will NOT make again!

Very good. I used Leek instead of Celery and loved the flavor. I topped with a bit of fresh grated white aged cheddar.

I wanted to try something different than my usual "brussels sprouts with pancetta" and this was good. Next time i'll probably cook the celery a little bit longer because i don't like it that crunchy, but everything else was great - i really liked the celery seed.

Fabulous recipe!! These were so good, followed the recipe to a "T". I loved the sauce, would also be good with cabbage or carrots. Glad I found this one.

These were pretty well received by both brussels sprout lovers and haters. Make certain you cook them enough, mine came out a bit hard and undercooked which contributed to the lack of excitement. However, if I needed a brussels sprout recipe, this one would be in my top two!

We made this last year for Thanksgiving. It was the favorite dish, surpassing the turkey by far. Sister insists on having it again this year. My children, ages 6 and 3, both asked for seconds. High praise, indeed, for brussels sprouts.

Haven't tried this yet. Just don't believe the cook from Alberta threw out perfectly good food. It may be that her celery seeeds were not FRESH. Old spices and herbs are very dead, and the flavor may be off.

This recipe was absolutely horrible! The celery seeds overpowered the rest of the flavours completely. I threw the whole thing straight in the trash. There is no way I would serve this to company.

What a lovely marriage of flavors! Even those who profess to dislike sprouts never fail to clean-up the serving dish. Found it works best with fresh sprouts.

As is, the lemon taste is not apparent. So, I doubled the amount of lemon juice and found this to be perfect. A really first rate brussel sprout recipe (and this is from someone who does not like brussel sprouts).
