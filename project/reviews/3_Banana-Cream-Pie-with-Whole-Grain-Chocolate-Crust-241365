It looked so good but was not worth the effort. I followed the recipe to a T but the filling was runny and the chocolate crust was gummy and tasted more like whole wheat flour than chocolate. All my friends ate the filling and bananas and left the crust but the filling was pretty mediocre too.

I agree with the last review! The directions didn't directly state to place in fridge for 6 hours or so but it said it can be made in advance up to 6 hours. It was a bit unclear and I wanted so bad to have a piece right away but now it's in the fridge overnight since it was impossible to cut a slice without it seeping everywhere. I hope tomorrow morning it's thick and cuts easily. I'm relying on the last review since she put a ton of work into it like me and got her results the next day! It still tasted great including the chocolate crust!!

I really liked the vanilla filling, and the idea of carmelizing the bananas, but the chocolate crust turned out very thick, chewy, and difficult to swallow. I'd do the filling again in a heartbeat, but either make an oreo/chocolate gram crust or just use a normal flaky pie crust.

I read the recipe and immediately ruled out the crust . . . too much time and purchased a refrigerated pie crust. I made the filling, topped it w/ 2 sliced bananas. I also made homemade whipped cream. It was a boring pie and felt it was like eating vanilla pudding w/ sliced bananas.

Very delicious, but way too time consuming, and the filling was not much better than vanilla pudding. I spent two days assembling this and waiting to eat it after reading other reviews, and I would say, that for two days worth of labor, it isn't worth it. Plus, lets be honest, its not really health anyway. Just b/c the crust uses wheat flour. Look at the amount of eggs and sugar in this thing. Yikes!

The photo looks a lot better than it really is.Too much work for the bland taste though it was better the second day. Not really worth the time, effort or cost. It just wasn't sweet enough.

Wow! What a pie! I found it to be very labor and time consuming. I'm a pretty good cook and baker but I was not ready for this pie. I had trouble with the crust, it kept tearing after I placed it in the pie pan. I chose to sprinkle the top with sugar and top with homemade vanilla whipping cream. When I had finished with the pie, my hubby and I sat down for a raste. I was rather dissappointed (although he said he loved it) It was very messy and hard to cut. And I was expecting the flavors in the custard to blend more. But to my great surprize, the next day (after the pie had ample time to sit in the fridge) I has a small piece. It cut with great ease and tasted so good!! The key here is to place it back into the frige for a few hours after it is completely assembled. It tasted like a totally different pie! YUMMY!
