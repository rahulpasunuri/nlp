I noticed that most people had to reduce a lot of the ingredients,especially the milk, eggs and sugar. Could this be because you are using cooked brown rice? The recipe appears to call for raw brown rice. I used 1/2 cup of raw brown rice, and it came out perfect with no adjustments.

I had the same soupy result as someone else who posted earlier. Probably need to double the rice or halve the milk. I substituted sorghum syrup for the molasses for a lighter flavor.

i made this for my husband who eats store bought rice pudding almost EVERY night. he liked it a lot. i used half the sugar and only 2 eggs. next time i make it i think i can use only 1 egg and less milk. i would also use slightly less cinnamon, but my husband likes rice pudding more on the plain side. i didn't use the molasses or honey at all. good recipe. i will use again!

I'm not a cook by nature, but found this recipe very quick & easy to make. It took about 8 minutes. I used 1&1/2 c. already cooked brown rice that and added it to the liquid mixture on the stove. I didn't have raisins but the rice pudding was still Delicious!! just like my mom used to make. i Love the hint of molasses.

I ommitted the sugar and molasses and still really liked this recipe with the addition of 1/2 cup extra raisins. I didn't find it too eggy with the numver of eggs the recipe calls for

I am a big fan of rice pudding and brown rice. I have to say, this was a let down. A low fat version of rice pudding with white rice is way better then this. The texture using brown rice isn't as creamy and taste wise, a little salty.

I was having a craving for something sweet but healthy and this seemed like a good choice. I took suggestions from earlier reviewers to use 1 fewer egg, a little less sugar, honey instead of molasses and save the cinnamon for the end and I think that really improved the recipe. If it had been any sweeter, it wouldn't have been enjoyable. However, it still didn't knock my socks off. It's a decent, healthy dessert for a time when you're craving something a little more starchy than fruit, but nothing to write home about. It's also pretty labor intensive (lots of stirring and monitoring temp so it doesn't come to a boil) for a so-so dessert. I'm pretty carb-happy, so I'll probably make this again as comfort food, but not for guests.

this was really yummy - ultimate comfort food. i would omit the sugar, though, and simply add honey to taste. couldn't wait for it to cool but it was jolly good warm.

I decided to whip up a little treat for my family and used this recipie. Made a few adjustments though. Instead of milk, I used soy milk and I reduced the amount of sugar by half. I also used honey instead of molasses and it turned out wonderful! My family loved it and they said it was better than the traditional rice pudding.

i made many adjustments to this recipe. Used brown basmati rice. Used Lactaid which did not evaporate as quickly so after 45 minutes, i removed the lid and used a parchment circle as an alternative lid (no skin-etc)- then i used 2 eggs. also added 1/2 c of raisins and 1/8t cardamom. Could have used less sugar too. But love it with the adjustments.

I halved this recipe since I just wanted to make a small batch for myself, and it turned out great. Very healthy, especially since I reduced the sugar and egg content. I upped the vanilla and cinnamon for extra flavour, and substituted some honey for the molasses. Creamy, chewy, sweet and guilt-free!

Would make it again only with changes. First, left the molasses out like others suggested, and put in less sugar than the recipe called for. It was still sweet enough. Might be good with maple syrup instead of molasses. Cinnamon might be better sprinkled on afterwards, less than called for put in, or not put in at all- the cinnamon taste is a bit too pronounced. Instead of raisins, might try putting berries on top after done. Mine turned out a bit too stiff, either I cooked it too long or it would be better with more milk added. Also I left out an egg, maybe it is ok to leave out two eggs.

This was tasty, yet sweet, before I added the molasses. Once the molasses went in, the flavor changed entirely -- no longer sweet, but now all molasses. I don't plan to make it again, but if I did I would omit the molasses and reduce the sugar. The brown rice was very good, though.

I followed the recipe exactly as written but it was watery soup. Does anyone know what could have happened?

This is definitely a comfort food with a new twist

Definitely a good recipe and healthy alternative to a long-time favorite. After reading other reviews, I used only 2 eggs (plenty) and all 1 percent milk. Was a perfect balance and not too eggy. I also used half the sugar (though I don't like super sweet things, others may want to use full 1/4 cup). The one thing I'd say, is if you are looking for old fashioned rice pudding, double the cinnamon and consider leaving out the molasses. I found my pudding tasted great till I added the molasses. It was still good afterward, just not what I had expected. Surprisingly, the brown rice was just as good as white rice versions.

I used soy milk instead of skim and only 2 eggs. It was very good, but I'll cut down the sugar next time.

This is the first time I made rice pudding. Compared to the stuff in the greek/italian restaurants, mine was much more flavorful. My friends loved it too. This recipie is a favorite of mine.

The flavor was quite good but more eggy than I'm used to. Be aware that brown rice has a chewier texture than white--perhaps it can be softened by pre-soaking the rice in water for an hour or so.

I made this one with 2% milk, as I didn't have any nonfat on hand--and it was delicious! My two-year-old daughter asked for seconds; as far as I'm concerned, that's the highest rating she can bestow on any dish.
