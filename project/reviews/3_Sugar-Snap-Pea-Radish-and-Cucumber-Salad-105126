I do not blanch the snap peas. I chop them to bite-size. I followed the advice of some other reviewers and I add a splash of soy sauce and a drizzle of sesame oil. This has become a repeat in my kitchen with an abundance of cucumbers from the garden. I recommend this to accompany rice and pan-grilled trout.

duardo....penFIELD not FILED....wait....maybe you're right. I agree with you anyway. Everybody is changing this recipe, not opining on the value of the recipe as a stand-alone. Notice how wordy and useless the two from MA are? Liked it....yum. Nuff said.

....uh....penfiled......how could using tomatoes be a plus if you won't make the dish again? Duh! I liked the radishes. Mine were hot.

Dish was okay, but a little bland. Probably won't make it again. Substituted cherry tomatoes for radishes which turned out to be a good move.

I was looking for something to do with snap peas--I didn't have radishes or cucumbers--but I followed this recipe plus the suggestions of other readers (a few splashes of sesame oil and soy sauce). I also added drained water chestnuts. It was very good, retaining the sweet flavor of the peas but with an asian twist. Very easy, too!

We have made this dish for a few large parties, and everyone seems to love it! Excellent flavor and great crunch make it a delicious side to any main course. This is the perfect cold salad for a hot summer day!

Delicious, and more so than I would have anticipated. Nice, crunchy texture. The vinaigrette was perfect. A perfect spring salad.

made this recipe last night, it was deliciious and easy, I added some toasted sesame oil, lemon zest and juice, parsley and some celery for crunch, as I did not have radish. Turn out great and all my friends love it. Did not use both vinegar,because of the lemon juice.

I made this salad to go along with a grilled glazed salmon dish. My husband and I thought it was very good. I would definitely make it again.

Very good - I added grape tomatoes.

After all these positive reviews, I was shocked by this recipe's blandness, which was relieved only by the harshness of the vinegars and salt. I was so surprised that I double-checked the ingredient amounts to see if I'd put in too much or too little of something. Then I tried adding a little oil to smooth things out. Nope. Just didn't like this recipe. Too bad, I've seldom seen a healthier one.

lovely and subtle. I add bonito flakes to the vinegars 30 min before adding to the salad.

very yummy -- a great fresh, light salad for summer. i'm always looking for interesting and healthy vegetable combinations, and this one definitely works. i did modify the dressing, though -- didn't even bother trying just the vinegars + salt and pepper cos it sounded too boring. to the vinegars i added a couple of splashes of soy sauce, a couple of splashes of sesame oil (the strongly flavored, dark asian variety), and a several splashes of olive oil (so that this dish can qualify as korean-italian fusion, or something like that ;-). also, i didn't bother buying seasoned rice vinegar -- adding salt and sugar worked just fine. i'm sure it would do ok with just one vinegar or the other, as well. one final note -- this salad is best if allowed a little bit for the flavors to marinate. the radishes and cucumber absorb the dressing and taste delicious that way. but not for too long, maybe just 15-20 minutes. any longer and everything starts wilting and the beans start losing their beautiful green color (and vitamins too, probably). it looked inedible the day after (although, i'll admit, i still happily munched it down ;-).
