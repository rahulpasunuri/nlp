I loved this recipe. I didn't use ginger though. And instead of molasses I used Vanilla extract and honey to sweeten it up.

An excellent sauce that is quick and easy to make. Use a good quality root beer if you can get it. Wonderfull over chicken or ribs. Given the reviews below I would say this sauce is more for barbeque lovers rather than fine dining enthusiasts. If you have the book "Smoke and Spice" you will likely love this sauce.

I am pretty disappointed with this recipe. A local brew pub used to offer an incredible root beer barbecue chicken, I was hoping that this would measure up to that amazing dish, but in the end I would have to agree with the 'glorified ketchup' remark someone else here made. It has a nice consistency, but the flavor is so so at best.

I loved this sauce - quick and easy to make, with a sweet spicy flavor. Will definitely make this again.

this sounded interesting and promising, but the sauce wasn't anything special--the root beer taste mellows and only adds sweetness--nothing exciting. There are better sauce recipes out there.

I go back to this over & over since I first read it in the Bon App issue yrs ago. It is excellent, esp with ribs. Definitely a keeper.

My husband is a HUGE BBQ fan and he loves this recipe. I am not fond of sticky sweet BBQ sauce and I loved this one too.

I also made this recipe exactly as written in terms of ingredients. We used it for grilled spareribs and I honestly wouldn't change a thing except to double the recipe and double the simmer time to achieve a thicker sauce. I will definitely make this again and will try the Cola and Dr. Pepper variations to see how they alter the taste. I've tried a lot of BBQ sauce recipes before but most were too spicy or just o.k. tasting. This recipe made me realize I prefer a slightly sweeter style sauce. Bonus: My kids helped me make it and they loved it too!

I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding the liquid smoke, but was very disappointed when I couldn't taste root beer at all. I thought the result pretty much just tasted like glorified ketchup...

Considering the other reviews I was dissapointed in this sauce. It WAS good, but not great. I don't know that I would make it again, a great recipe is Coffee BBQ sauce on Food Network Canada by Christine Cushing.

This is a BBQ sauce delux. I stuck with the recipe to the tee except that I used more expensive, designer Root Beer instead of the blander $.99 per liter suds. I thought it made a difference. My friends and fam sure dig it.

A sweet, rather retro sauce -- a hit with my husband, who has more of a sweet tooth than I. Like a previous reviewer, I omitted the liquid smoke, which invariably tastes artificial to me.

Used this recipe for baked beans only and it was the best ever!! Did not use any liquid smoke and added some pieces of thick cut bacon (cooked and torn in small pieces) to a large can of store bought baked beans. Kept it in a crock pot over night and guests were thoroughly addicted.

I need just one word to describe this sauce -- YUMMY! It was all that a barbecue sauce should be, rich and full-flavored and just delicious. I used cola instead of root beer and omitted the lemon juice and peel as I didn't have any lemons on hand. Can be left as is if you're serving spic-sensitive kids or add a pinch of cayenne to give it some kick.

This sauce was amazing. I made two small changes: omitted the liquid smoke, and instead of garlic and onion powder I used fresh grated through a fine microplane grater. I will definitely make this again. Would also be great with ribs.

Just had to make this with all of the great reviews it received. I took some of the advice and omitted the smoke and also added a little cornstarch. Excellent flavor and simple to prepare...would definitely make again.

Great recipe. It's my favorite barbecue sauce because I like it on the sweeter side and not too spicy. I made the recipe when it first came out in the magazine and many times after. Makes great baked beans, too; just add a couple large scoops of it to Bush's canned baked beans and cook in oven.

What a great BBQ sauce recipe! I made it with grilled chicken and it was wonderful! I did add a cornstarch mixture to make the sauce thicken up a bit as it was a bit too runny for my taste. Keeps great in the fridge too!

Just made this today. Really delicious! I actually used a little more liquid smoke than the rcipe called for. Also tweaked it with a little extra brown sugar, molasses, onion & garlic powder. Didn't feel like bothering with the lemon peel and it wasn't missed at all. Quick and easy, will definitely make again, not to mention that my kids thought it was a hoot that I was cooking with coke!!

AH... I'm another one of those people who vaired the recipe... I've tried and root beer and the cocoa-cola versions, and for another unique version I tried Dr. Pepper. The Dr. Pepper version is my favorite. yum.

I don't know a thing about real BBQ and using this sauce in a crockpot recipe may be offensive to some, but I absolutely loved the flavor!Substitutions: Pepsi, 2 & 1/2 T dark molasses for the dark brown sugar and light molasses, fresh squeezed OJ. Eliminated onion powder and grated lemon peel. Added some cornstarch (I think it was about 1 tsp.) mixed in 1 T. water to thicken the reduction even more as I expected the sauce to thin as it simmered in the covered crockpot. I doubled the sauce, browned 4 lbs of spareribs, sliced a very large yellow onion and layered everything in a 6.5 qt oval crockpot: a little sauce to cover the bottom, 1/2 the onion, spareribs (a little sauce smeared between each layer of spareribs to distribute the flavors), a little more sauce spread on top, remainder of onions, remainder of sauce, covered and cooked on low for about 5 hours, until the meat fell off the bones. I've always considered spareribs as messy and too fatty to bother with, but I was searching for recipes for the crockpot that didn't call for canned soup as a major ingredient and stumbled over this sauce recipe. I was very pleased with the results of this experiment. I will definitely make this again, probably using country style ribs instead of spareribs and serve it with coleslaw and cornbread.

Well received by all guests at BBQ. Just added a few spices to make it a bit hotter.

This was a delicious and easy barbecue sauce. I took other reviewers advice and used coca cola instead of root beer; only used 1/2 tsp liquid smoke and added 1 tablespoon chili powder. It took longer than the recommended time to reduce but it was worth it. So much better than store bought!!!

Tasty and easy!! I'm making it again this weekend for company!!

A real kick-ass sauce - not because it's spicy (it's not), but because it's hands down the best sauce I've made so far! I made the recipe as is, no substitions whatsoever. The consistency is a little thinner than I'm used to, but it still spread just fine and the flavor is dynamite. The root beer flavor is discernable, but subtle (I used Trader Joe's draft root beer). I will definitely make a large batch to keep on hand!

In this recipe I substituted dry New Mexican chipolte in favour of the liquid smoke.I also use the best oldfashioned root beer i can find and a splash of Jamacian ginger beer, add larger quantities and increase the reduction time.WOW!!!!

This is my favorite BBQ sauce! The only changes I make are to add 1 tablespoon chili powder and 2 tablespoons bourbon whiskey. Great on chicken or ribs!

I have never made my own bbq sauce. This is the best sauce I have ever tasted. I used no smoke because I forgot to buy it. I did use root beer and used Heinz Hot Ketchup with Tobasco which gave it the proper amount of heat. I made it with the chicken and can't wait to try it with ribs. I will make this over and over again.

This is a great recipe. I used Coke, which worked just fine. I added a teaspoon of Tabasco sauce, and 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne to zip it up some and cut a little of the sweetness. I upped the garlic powder and onion powder to 3/4 teaspoon each. I have used it on chicken and ribs so far, delicious on both! My neighbors demanded I make a double batch for their barbecue, as my contribution. I agree that it takes longer than specified to boil down the sauce to make 1 1/2 cups, but that is no big deal. An all around, versatile sauce that is very tasty!

I love this sauce! I usually double the recipe and add about a teaspoon of cayanne pepper for some heat.

Rating: 4
absolutely the best!!! i do agree w/ everyone on the amount of smoke flavoring... I used about 1/2 and it was fine, but as the other cook said, it could just be a difference of brands. also: i added about 2 or 3 tbsp. of honey and it was delicious! will def. be making a comeback when i make pulled pork!

Rating: 4
Definitely a repeat, repeat, repeat. Amount of smoke flavoring depends on brand. I use full recipe amount of Colgin Liquid Smoke. Much lighter than other brands. Passed this recipe on to 6 others. They have all repeated it at least twice now. Time needed to reduce to specified volume (without scorching) definitely twice as long as recipe states.

Used this on chicken, ribs and a smoked pull a-part pork barbecue sandwich. My kids love the sauce. I let them add the extra hot sauce.

Made this last weekend and everyone kept smelling the sauce and asking what I'd use it on! I put it on chicken and burgers, and it was delicious on both. I agree with those that said the amount of liquid smoke was too much; I only used 1/2 tsp and it was plenty. I did "kick it up a notch" with some Tabasco, but other than that, the recipe is great as is. Definitely make this again!

This sauce was a perfect summery glaze for chicken breasts on the bbq. It also tasted great when mixed with ground turkey and breadcrumbs for light turkey burgers on the grill. Will definitely be making an encore this summer.

For Suepar, I tried your curiosity and did a combo of Coke, Dr. Pepper, and Root Beer. I thought this was a great product although I haven't made it in it's original form. I agree that it did need more time to reduce, especially since I made it for 110 people! And cutting way down on the liquid smoke is a must. A fun recipe and peaks interest to my customers seeing Root Beer in the title, but honestly I don't think they would have known the difference from this to K.C. Masterpiece! Spend the time on creating a fun side dish and dessert!

I had a barbeque over the weekend and this sauce was a hit. I served it with smoked ribs instead of chicken. I also took the advice of one of the reviewers and used double the brown sugar and a hit of hot sauce. Tip: I boiled the sauce for double the time and get a much thicker sauce, Great for barbeque or just dipping.

I made this with Coca Cola since we didn't have root beer and used ribs instead of chicken. Excellent! Next time we'll try it with root beer and chicken. We used this with the rub from the grilled chicken with root beer barbecue sauce recipe and marinated the ribs for about 6 hours. The sauce may be a just little spicy for some but eliminating 1 TBL of worcestershire may help. We loved it the way it was.

I have been looking for a fabulous sauce for years, and this is it! I doubled the amount of brown sugar and put in a few shakes of tabasco sauce. Be careful if you use lemon juice from a bottle instead of fresh lemons, it makes it too sour and you must compensate with even more brown sugar. I used the sauce on baby back ribs and it was devoured by my cooking class in minutes. I can't wait to try it with Coca Cola or with Dr. Pepper.

This recipe is worth experimenting with some more. Made 1/2 the recipe with root beer, 1/2 with Coca Cola. I agree with Francoise that the Coke version produced a far superior sauce, with a deep, rich citrussy flavor we loved (kids might get a big kick out of the root beer). However, this recipe contains WAY too much smoke seasoning for my taste. Next time I'll begin with 1/8 teaspoon and see if it needs any more. Will someone out there please make this with Dr. Pepper and let us know what you think????

I tried this sauce twice in the last couple of weeks. The second time I used Coca-Cola instead of root-beer. This made the sauce truly outstanding in flavour. This is one of the best bbq sauces ever. Make a double batch so you have enough for dipping afterwards.
