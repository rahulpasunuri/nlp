Do you have to use frozen blackberries?

Just awful! I made the recipe for frozen pops exactly as directed. I tasted the blackberry/cream mixture before filling the pop molds and it was very good. After it froze, it tasted like I was licking a flavored stick of butter. Can someone tell me what went wrong? I even had freshly picked blackberries from my yard.

A great summer treat! I made the pops on an ice cube tray, along with the mango pop recipe for a summer barbeque sweet. They disappeared quickly because everyone loved them!
