this is the best tuna salad sandwich I ever had! tahini dressing got a little stuck in the bottom of the blender, next time I will try to whip it by hand! I used red, white, and brown onions, added a pinch of sugar, aleppo pepper, and some garlic. Easy and delicious. I will make more of the onion mixture next time though.

Absolutely loved this! I used two tuna cans in water instead of 4 cans in oil, and used slightly less olive oil and just more tahini and lemon. I needed more sauce than the recipe here (maybe we just love our tuna salad juicier?). But the taste is delicious and the toasted pine nuts and crunchy onion really made this special all the way.

This was really delicious. Wonderful flavor and texture. I have never reviewed a recipe before, but I couldn't stop eating this. I followed the recipe exactly. Fully cooking the onions for 50 minutes is critically important for the incredible flavor. This is a WOW!!

Oh, I forgot to say that I did add about 3 TB parsley to the dressing.

Just made the dressing - made it exactly as written for a green salad - very tasty!!

Wonderful recipe; salt quantity is too high...I would taste the final dressing (I made mine with yogurt, like other readers suggested--yum!), and add to taste...

This has become a family favorite, especially on hot nights. I make up a batch of the dressing to keep in the fridge at all times, as my 5 year old daughter is a tahini sauce fanatic. This is great with just about any combination of veggies, and delicious with grilled steak, chicken, or salmon as well.

Yup, this dressing turns out great with some plain yogurt substituted for some olive oil. Even fat free yogurt tastes really good - awesome dip for veggies too!

This recipe is awesome. A variation is to make a big salad with lettuce, tomatos, carrots, cucumber, red pepper, and red onion, and then toss the tuna in the dressing and put on top of the salad, with some extra dressing on the side, and toasted whole wheat pita. I am going to try making the dressing tonight substituting plain yogurt for some of the olive oil, will let you all know how it turns out.

Fantastic! Regarding the onions; if cooked on medium high, will carmelize nicely in about 20 minutes. Stir them only after they begin to brown!

Loved this! Followed recipe exactly, just doubled the amount of cayene pepper. Tastes great in a pita with lettuce and sliced tomato!

This is one of my husband's favorite recipe. I don't like onions, but cooked this way they add a great crunchy texture and flavour. I cut the tuna in half (we're only two people) but still made the full recipe of sauce. It's also really good served with toasted naan.

It was nice to find something to do with canned tuna other than the usual mayonnaise tuna salad. I hated the sauce so I left it out, and we ate it on Indian fried bread. My teenage son loved it. My husband and I thought it was a welcome change but kind of odd.

I was just looking for something different to do with tuna for this week's packed lunches. I liked the idea of parsley and tahini as I love Middle Eastern flavours but had never thought to mix with Tuna. For fun only I added the pinenuts and onions. The onions add great crunchy texture as a garnish and even good flavour when mixed with the salad and eaten the next day (ie, once soggy). However I won't waste pinenuts this way again - the flavour and texture are lost. I'll be making tuna salad with parsley, tahini, garlic and lemon again.

This was very tasty and different (in a good way!) from the usual mayo-y tuna salad. The onions (which I did cook for the full 50 minutes and then some) were the best part of the dish. I drained the onions after cooking them to get rid of the excess oil, and was glad I did. Next time, I will toast the pignoli in the oven instead of in the skillet; the extra oil in the skillet made them too greasy.

Although I haven't actually prepared this recipe, I would say that, indeed, the onions should be cooked for the full 50 minutes. The reason is to caramelize them, a common garnish for middle eastern fare, from my limited experience. Tried the other recipe for tahini salad, and tastes exactly like the salad from my favorite place! I love when that happens!

Great! But I made half the tuna and the full recipe for the dressing. And it served 2 for a main course with soup. I am remaking this, and not believing that I cooked onions for 50 minutes. Must be a typo - cook onions Five minutes.

Everyone really liked this recipe, and it is worth the effort to assemble it. The flavors did indeed remind me of the food I liked so much in Lebanon, especially since we scooped it up with Arabic pita bread. I am not so sure whether canned fish is quite right -- a grilled Mediterranean tuna served whole would be more fitting. Fresh tuna just large enough to serve 4-6 persons can be found at the fish market here. A similar tahini dressing is served over whole baked or grilled fish in Turkey.

I was amazed as I am not a fan of tahini. This was really good. My family enjoyed this mix in the pita bread (halved) with chopped leaf lettuce. Next time I make this, I will add more garlic and use the whole amount of cayenne. I will probably add shredded carrot to the tuna and offer cucumber slices to add with the lettuce for topping in the pita. No ingredient was overpowering. It fed 4 as a main course.

We used tuna packed in water, but I have to assume that the added oil in the recipe eliminated any benefit of reduce fat intake. At least we used a good virgin olive oil and canola oil for the vegetable oil. Doubled the garlic and tripled the cayenne pepper. I look forward to making this again for luncheon guest as it is so easy to prepare and the end results are an absolute delight.

I make the dressing for this recipe for plain green salads and it is delicious. People can't get enough of it. Or, reduce the olive oil and serve as a dip with baby carrots. Very tasty!

Very good and different from the usual tuna salad sandwich. I like the variation. My other favorite is one from a low-fact cookbook published by the Silver Palate author.

The onions and pinenuts are the star of this dish. Good even for people who don't normally like tuna.

Great! Not too difficult to make, either. Oddly enough, I also only used half the tuna (by mistake) and I found it to be just fine.
