I think the grapes could be left out completely and the cakes/muffins wouldn't suffer. The orange zest is great and the texture is very nice. Don't forget to sugar the tops, they need it.

While this recipe came out well, and delivered what it promised, we found the flavor didn't stand out for us. We managed to knock it up a notch by cooking down the leftover orange and grapes into a compote, but it still left a lot to be desired.

I have made these often since discovering the recipe last December. So easy! So good. The lady at the liquor store got to wondering what I was doing with all the Vin Santo -- so I brought her the recipe too. Rather than fuss with flouring the grapes, I make the batter; fill the muffin tins a third; drop in 4 or 5 grapes; top with the remaining batter; sprinkle with the bit of granulated sugar; bake. (I use regular size muffin tin.) Great warm out-of-the-oven. Like a bit of fruit cake/pie the next day for a snack.

Vin Santo is ridiculously expensive and often hard to find for cooking with. A nice syrupy Muscat was absolutely the way to go. I found that getting them out of the tin as soon as possible resolved the somewhat soggy bottoms issue. They were delicious while still slightly warm and served with the Muscat, but start to loose the subtle flavors the next day.

These are just ok. Vin santo added an interesting dimension to the cupcake (because let's face it, that's all these are) but the grapes sank to the bottom (yes, I did flour them) and made it a bit soggy around the bottom and thus, pretty much impossible to get out in one neat piece. If I were to make these again, it would be with either no fruit or something else. I like the idea of grapes, but they just didn't work.

while discussing these at dinner, my roommates weren't sure if these were grape muffins or great muffins. i think both are true.

Easy and very good. Used another dessert wine and made 12 muffins. They had lost a little something texture-wise the next day but were still tasty.

I made these in 12 muffin pans. I used a sweet California Dessert Wine called Muscat de Beaulieu. I followed the recipe exactly otherwise and they were delicious- not too sweet but you could taste the wine. In the muffin tins it took 15 minutes. I dusted the top with powdered sugar and ate them while they were still warm! YUM!
