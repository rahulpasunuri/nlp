With some tweaks this recipe is really quite good. Used all purpose flour (sorry gluten free friends), and upped the flour:cornmeal ratio to 3:1. Also sprinkled some pumpkin pie spice on top before placing in the oven. As mentioned by previous reviewers, cooking time is only 12-13 mins. Biscuits came out light and fluffy and a beautiful orange color. Next time I'll up the maple syrup ratio, as I think they could stand to be a bit sweeter, but for those who like 'em savory not much needs to be done.

same thing that happens to every yam baking recipe i find. i switched to regular flower. no matter how much flower i add i keep ending up with something more resembeling polenta than dough. maybe it has something to do with the kind of yams in my country.

I actually have Celiac Disease and made these exactly as stated. Sooooo nice to see a GF recipe that I don't have to fool with to get to work. To all the people who complained about the grit etc.....that is what GF baked goods are like quite often...and as far as dry is concerned... GF flour baked goods often suffer from dryness due to the types of flour used. Any biscuits you don't plan to eat right away put in the freezer as soon as you can.

As someone who has to be gluten-free, I was thrilled to see a recipe for a baked-good in a mainstream magazine that I didn't have to convert. I tried these as written (using a blender), and thought they were good - but agree with others that the cornmeal created too gritty of a texture for a biscuit. Dough made with GF flour will be soft and harder to work with than with wheat flour - thus the odd directions for how to shape & cut the dough. I would look for a traditional biscuit recipe and try adding sweet potato to see what happens...

We loved these biscuits. I made them for Thanksgiving with cake flour (closest I had to gluten-free) and no pecans. I did goof up and added the sweet potato when it was still warm, so the dough was a little gooey, but they still turned out deliciously. We also froze some of the dough to have with soup later. We just popped the frozen rounds on a pan at 425 for 15 minutes and I think they tasted even better than when the dough was fresh.

To the cook from nashville. It's actually because some people are allergic to wheat and can't eat it that it says gluten free flour. Did anyone make the recipe as written? I'd like to try it.

This are yummy. A few thoughts: 1. I think the reason they mention gluten free flour is that the recipe is prone to over-mixing. If you use gluten flour you might get something icky. That being said, I used all purpose and it was great. 2. pecans=totally optional. I made it with both 3. Roll them into little balls instead of using the technique they suggested. They come out much cuter. In fact, to get the biscuit in the picture, I don't think they did the square pat method. At least mine in the square method didn't look like that, but the ones that I hand rolled did. d

The taste of these biscuits was slightly sweet and nutty, very yummy. BUT there was the crunch of the cornmeal that made me quiver. Lots of butter to help soften the crunch, but still, a hard bite on one's tongue.

I made a double batch of these for a get together. I didn't follow the recipe exactly though. I used regular all purpose flour instead of the gluten free and margarine instead of unsalted butter, and didn't add in the salt. I also kept out the pecans because I wasn't sure if anyone had an allergy. I also didn't "cut out" these biscuits. I just rolled the dough in my hands and then patted it into a biscuit shape: very easy! They turned out excellent, not dry or gritty as some have mentioned. And I got a lot of great compliments on them. Also, to the reviewer who complained about not having a processor: I didn't use any electrical device when making these, just a whisk and rubber spatula. It was a little extra work, but the result was excellent. I will absolutely make these again.

@Newfield NY: I bought a used food processor, and as its not used constantly, it has lasted me 20+ years. I shop at Salvation Army all the time. I live in a small apartment. I'd never get rid of my food processor. I agree, you've unfairly slanted the reviews simply cause YOU dont own a food processor!

After reading the reviews I made a few adjustments. They turned out Okay. Not dry or gritty, but I'll stick with Sweet potato pie and Buttermilk biscuits. If you don't have the appliances or EXACT ingredients the to follow recipe as written, IMPROVISE,EXPERIMENT,THINK about it! You might just learn how to do something on your own.

I made these biscuits last night as a dry run for Thanksgiving. They will NOT be on my menu. The flavor was good, but we found them dry and gritty--that would be the effect of the cornmeal, I expect. And the previous reviewer was right. They were done in 15 minutes. The recipe recommended King Arthur's gluten free flour, which I could not get locally so used Bob's Red Mill instead. Anyway, I won't make these again.

I made these biscuits yesterday and was quite pleased with how they turned out, though I agree with the previous reviewer that the baking time is much too long. My biscuits were done in 15 minutes. I also opted not to use gluten free flour, as I didn't have any, and instead used cake flour, a low gluten flour. They turned out quite nicely. The dough was also easy to work with. In response to the first reviewer, you could absolutely make thse without a food processor. Mash up your yam really well and make the dough like you would a pie dough or other biscuit dough. Be careful not to let the butter get too warm or over mix the dough or you'll end up with a tough biscuit.

I did make the biscuits. Unfortunately, they were not what I expected. First, what "gluten-free" flour was supposed to be used? A specific type was not mentioned, so I used Bob's garbanzo and fava flour. The result was a very runny mix that couldn't be shaped at all. Instead I made them like a drop biscuit. The biscuits baked in no time at all; I'm glad I set my timer for 12 minutes because they were done. The taste was good but more of a muffin consistency than a denser biscuit.

To the cook from Newfield NY - How can you give a 1 fork review over a recipe you haven't even made?

I think it is a teensy bit obnoxious to assume that everybody has a big food processor. I work in a small kitchen...and that $300 Kitchen Aid hasn't come dancing my way yet. How about directions without a food processor? Electric mixer? pastry blender? That's what I'm about to use.
