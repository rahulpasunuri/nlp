Made this last night with Tilapia. I am always entertaining, and my guest took home the recipe. My husband said 3 times that he thought this was exceptional, and one guest that doesn't like lemon, went back for additional lemon sauce! That's enough for me! I agree with other reviewers, go simple and clean on the sides. You don't want to compete with the fish flavors.

We had this for Christmas yesterday. I used Grouper instead of Sea Bass,and it was delicious. I did cut back on both the horseradish and mustard. Served it with Asiago Potatoes and Clementine, Endive salad. We all enjoyed the meal and will have it again.

I consider myself a good cook and very adventuresome and this recipe was fabulous. Like other reviewers, it's not a light recipe but it exceeded my expectations. I used Mahi-Mahi and pretty much followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Terrific!

This recipe is easy and fabulous. I only omitted the nuts, as my husband doesn't like them. I tilapia, and even my super picky 13-yr old, scarfed this up! Will definitely make again.

I was excited to make this for dinner and enjoy what seemed to be a delicious way to prepare Sea Bass. So many of the sea bass recipes are Asian in nature and I wanted something different. It is actually delicious prepared exactly as in the recipe but after the first few bites, wow - it is way too rich. The cheese, walnuts and butter in the bread crumbs on top of an already oily fish - and then a butter sauce on top - too much! The butter and cheese could be omitted from the crumbs and a squeeze of lemon replace the lemon dill sauce. Great idea but even for someone who loves rich dishes - too much!

This was sooo good. This was "President Obama is Coming to Dinner" good. I substituted gluten free corn flakes for the bread, and used Beer and Brat Mustard because I didn't have horseradish. Made the Lemon Dill Sauce with dried French Tarragon from my garden because I hate dill, cheap college kid champagne because it was there, and I didn't have white wine, and red onions. The point is, its not hard. You can just eyeball all the quantities and wing it and it is still fabulous. It was so good. I want to make a whole 'nuther batch and keep eating!

This was great! I did make a change on the sauce as I had no white wine in the house (on a Sunday is Salt Lake ha ha) so I made a tartar sauce of sorts with the same flavors. Mayo, lemon, dill, shallot. It was delicious!

Excellent - this went down extremely well in a test run with my family. I will definitely repeat it for guests. Instead of a full cup of bread crumbs I used 1/2 cup ground flax seeds 1/2 cup bread crumbs. Healthier and delicious!

This recipe was great! Very easy. I made it with fresh Haddock and it worked fine. The lemon dill sauce is really good but the recipe by itself is so good it really is not needed, especially if you want to cut down on the fat. Just before the fish was done I put the oven on broil just to crisp the topping on the fish. I will make this again for sure!

A later-in-life seafood convert, this is the first fish I ever prepared, and I think I was spoiled by its phenomenal taste and ease. I could just drink the lemon dill sauce, and will be using it on all sorts of seafood from now on. Noilly Prat knows no substitute in the kitchen. I prepared it for two along with roasted white asparagus and cranberry beans. What a treat!

I made this dish for my mother for her birthday dinner based on all the outstanding reviews. Since I'm from the Gulf Coast of Florida, my tastes in fish are pretty...snobbish, so I used amberjack instead of sea bass. Any firm-fleshed whitefish will do (mahi mahi, flounder, talipia, grouper, tilefish, orange roughy, etc), however. My dad is allergic to tree nuts, so we just omitted the walnuts altogether. The parmesan/horseradish crust was phenomenal, but the recipe calls for waaayyyy too much to coat only one side--also, as the recipe directs. I'll make half of that next time. I forgot to serve the lemon-dill sauce with it and got rave reviews, then when I pulled the sauce out, I was overwhelmed with praise. DO NOT be tempted to taste the sauce alone, however, because it is VERY STRONG on its own. The sauce spilled off the fish and into the rice pilaf I made with it and it was really good, too. Toss it with rice, pasta, and cover fish it it...alone, the sauce is very versitile!

I have made this several times. Fish may take longer to cook than what is stated. wonderful recipe.

This was outstanding! My husband, who could happily live off yogurt and cereal for the rest of his days, could not stop raving about this fish. Although quite an expensive dish it rivaled any 4 star restaurant meal we've had. The crispy and well seasoned crust was beautiful with the solid meaty flesh of the bass. I'm not usually one for sauces but the lemon dill really kicked it up and perfected all the flavours. I look forward to trying this recipe with haddock in the future. I think it would work well with any fleshy white fish. I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect, no changes/additions needed in my opinion.

This was really outstanding. I did the recipe exactly as written except that I used herbed bread crumbs, as that is what I had on hand. My meat-and-potatoes man really gobbled it and as he said, "It's a do-over!"

My fiance' and I made this last night for my parents' first visit to our new home. I took other reviewers' advice and cut the lemon juice in half on the sauce and only drizzled the pan with it before adding the fish. I served the majority of the sauce over steamed broccolini. The meal was met with RAVE reviews - a definite keeper!

This fish was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I skipped the sauce at the suggestion of others and although we like horseradish, I thought 2 T was a little too much...I used just 1 T. The fish was very thick so I increased the bake time too. Recipes don't get any easier or better tasting than this.

Served this at a dinner party and received rave reviews. Used Chilean Sea Bass which was recommended by the fish market. If using the lemon-dill sauce, I would drizzle under the fish instead of over it. I agree with the other reviewers that the sauce was a bit over-powering and not essential for this delicious dish!

Absolutely fabulous! I tried this recipe due to having a piece of mahi-mahi that I didn't know what to do with and I was oh so pleasantly surprised! I admit I had to substitute a few things... obviously, I used mahi-mahi instead of sea bass and corn- flake crumbs instead of breadcrumbs, but in the end it was heaven in every bite! I will definitely try making this with the exact ingediants, but can't imagine it tasting any better! It was very simple and easy and the flavor is so complex that it is SURE to impress! YUM!!!

After reading the reviews, I took a gamble and made this for the first time for a dinner party. With the exception of substituting cashews for the walnuts I followed the recipe exactly and had no trouble with it at all. My guests were so impressed that they raved about this recipe all evening and still talk about it to this day. This was an absolute winner. Will be making this again and again and again....

Rating: 4
Absolutely fabulous recipe. I would, however, take issue with the cooking time. I ended up having to bake it about 12 minutes longer to get the fish more flaky & translucent (it still looked pretty raw after 15 minutes, unless you prefer your fish that way). I also put it under the broiler for an additional 5 minutes - no burning, and it had a nice crunchy top coat.

I made this recipe using Chilean Sea Bass and got rave reviews from our 10 guests for New Year's Eve Dinner. I used pecans and like some other reviewers, cut down on the amount of breading. Also found the fish had to cook for about 30 minutes, probably because the pieces I used were very thick.

This literally melted in our mouths. I was fortunate to have a friend bring me Chilean Sea Bass. I used toasted pecans instead of walnuts and did not use the lemon dill sauce. It was outstanding! I will definately make it again but will have to settle for cod the next time probably.

Great recipe!! Substituted pistachios for the walnuts (which are hard to find down south!) A DEFINITE Keeper!!

Unsolicited praise from hubby on this one. I made only the crust (no sauce) using store bought bread crumbs, no horseradish. I pounded the walnuts in a plastic bag. Also, did not use butter in the mixture but a little bit of olive oil. Since I like mustard I will probably use more the next time. Will try it on salmon too.

As Sea Bass is endangered now, it is very difficult to find so I substituted with cod. The crust was delicious but the cod was pretty tasteless. I would make this recipe again with another type of fish or even chicken breast. Although I did find that the flavor of the lemon dill sauce was lost in the richness of the crust.

I made this dish for company last week and everyone LOVED it. A couple of thoughts: I omitted the horseradish (I didn't feel it was needed) and I ended up baking it much longer than the recipe called for, about 25 - 30 minutes. I think the pieces of seabass I used were about 7 ounces and especially thick, so that may have been why it took so long. The sauce was also delicious - I put it under the seabass on the plate, squeezed fresh lemon on top of each piece and served. I will definitely make this again!

I'm going to have to disagree a bit with some of the rave reviews for this recipe. I made the crumb crust in the amount called for, and had way too much. The amount of mustard was a bit overpowering for the dish (to my tastebuds). I would suggest the following: melt the butter, add mustard and horseradish to taste (starting with half the amounts called for). Same with the crumb crust (parmesean I didn't think was needed since it's overpowered by the other ingredients). Take your fish, dip into the butter mixture and then dip into the crumb mixture. You'll have enough of the crumb crust adhering, but yet still enjoy the taste of the fish and butter mixture through the crust.

Rating: 2
I am sure there are much better recipes for beadcrumbs out there- I love horseradish and could not even taste it (it was a brand new bottle of HOT horseradish too)and the mustard taste was not even discernible- just tasted ok... wish I used my instincts to 'jazz it up' a bit with some cayenne and more horseradish.

Rating: 3
Used panko b/c had no breadcrumbs and worked well. Also passed it under the broiler for 2 minutes to get the golden crust on top. Would cut down the mustard slightly and apply a thinner layer of crust next time so sea bass taste is not overpowered. Overall it got rave reviews from my wife and plan to make it again fir guests next week with the sauce. nice recipe and very easy!!

I made this a couple of nights ago with halibut and it was excellent. I did not try the lemon dill sauce because of time constraints (lazy). My wife requested this same recipe for tonight's dinner for company. I'll try the sauce this time.

Mmm. Soooo good. Served with penne with tomato and brie, Mustard adds a nice flavor I thought- but if someone doesn't like mustard, omit since the mustard flavor does really come through. I am not a very exact cook when it comes to following recipes. Used Guldens mustard and no horseradish, didn't process, just cubed the bread (portuguese with the thin crust) and used pre-chopped walnuts, and didn't use the lemon dill sauce cause i was busy, but would next time, lemon and dill are just perfect with fish. So I'm saying it easily adapts to your own preferences and what you have at hand. It tasted fabulous!

Fabulous crust! Crunchy texture super. I needed more than 15 minutes baking time for Chilean sea bass in my oven, but more time worked fine. Price I had to pay for this kind of fish is a deterrent, but will try with other fish. Was even good as leftovers next day. I plan to use it for upcoming dinner parties - the ultimate compliment I can give for a recipe. I did not like the lemon-dill sauce,however, and will omit it next time.

This is a staple in my home now! My family loves it even my little boys-2, 3 & 5. They ask me to make the fish with the nuts on it. I have tried many variations and different mild white fish based on what is in my home. I omit horseradish and have used macadamia nuts instead of walnuts. Big hit! Have also made for guest and I too, generally do not serve fish to guests. One of my all time favorites, can't recommend enough especially to those trying to get children to eat fish.

WOW! I was a bit skeptical about both the crust and the lemon dill sauce. Both were out of this world. I highly recommend both recipes! I had to make some substitutions based on what was in the house: red onion for shallot, dried breadcrumbs, parsley & dill for fresh (gasp!, I know....but it was all I had). Even with these substitutions, it was wonderful! I loved the crunch that the walnuts gave the crust. I tasted something different in the crust with each bite. The lemon dill sauce is not to be skipped. It adds zip to the dish. I think I ate it half raw but after one bite, I couldn't stop. It did not seem heavy or greasy to me at all. I can't wait to serve it to friends and family.

I made this dish and everyone loved it. It is a great combination of sweet and savory, and a great dish for guests. Easy to make and really good. Don't overcook the fish and stick it in the broiler for a minute or two to get the crust cripsy.

I made this with black bass and it was good. The crumb mixture was okay but I felt like it needed more fresh tasting ingredients like more herbs. The sauce was outstanding. I think panko crumbs would add an interesting texture. Maybe a little less horseradish. Good recipe but could use some tweaking.

Made this last night for dinner (after reading all the great reviews) - WOW ! So glad I tried it - absolutley delicious. I used 2 (6oz) pieces of fresh chilian sea bass from the Columbus Fish Market. There are just two of us so this recipe halfs very easy! I didn't make the lemon-dill sauce. After having the sea bass without it, I can't imagine it being any better!!! Loved the flavor of the walnut-breadcrumb crust. Will be making this again & again - C'est magnifique !

The crust in this recipe is what makes this dish delicious. We substituted salmon for sea bass and it worked really well.

We combined the fish with a side of risotto for an easy dinner.

Delicious, easy, quick, what more could you ask? The Lemon-Dill sauce wonderful and I can see many uses for it, particularly with veggies. My husband would have preferred a little extra tang to the coating, but I suspect it has to do with the Dijon I used- it was a new brand to me and wasn't as assertive as some. Fortunately, fresh haddock is available in my area and at $7.99lb makes this recipe all the more appealing!

I used this receipe to create my first fish for dish ever. I think this receipe made me look like a pro chef, even though I am just a beginner. I was amazed at how simple it was to make and how elegant of a meal it created. The only issue I found is I was a bit sticker shocked at the price of Sea Bass. I paid $20 for enough fish for four.

I've made this dish 3 times now for family gatherings. I've used both macadamia nuts and almonds in place of the walnuts and I've substituted tilapia for the sea bass.

Definitely agree it's a keeper!

We've made this several times since it was published and it rocks! With Chilean Sea Bass at $14/pound, we typically use halibut, and substitute pecans for walnuts. Yes, take care when broiling.

I served this dish to 16 people at Rosh Hashanah dinner. Everyone raved about it! BE VERY WATCHFUL DURING THE BROILING STAGE! Don't take your eyes off it! I'm making it again tonight, just for my family, and I'm going to turn the fillets on their sides so there is a greater area to spread the yummy crumbs. As for the richness of the dill sauce - I just drizzled a little bit on each piece - it was plenty. Otherwise it disguises the wonderful taste of the sea bass.

Every year, I make a special birthday dinner for my best friend. I spend lots of time looking for a recipe that will let her know the meal I'm making is especially for her, and one that will let her know how thankful I am for her friendship. This year, this was the recipe I chose, and I'm so happy that I did. I used a fish called Escolar, which is very hard to find, but is a cross (in taste) between sea bass and halibut. Phenomenal! I served it with roasted vegetables with tarragon butter (another epicurious recipe) and a simple green salad with bleu cheese dressing, a seeded baguette and a crisp chardonnay. Excellent!!

Ignore the last review--people who are obsessed with fat should not make anything with butter to begin with. This is a delicious recipe, and that's coming from a HEALTHY person (marathon runner), too. Healthy is not synonymous with rigid compulsivity re: fat. If you cannot spare a 1/2 tablespoon butter and 1 teaspoon olive oil on an entree (a delicious entree) every once in awhile, you must be living a pretty lackluster, flavorless life. Make this recipe, it is great :)

This dish was WAY too rich, we eat low fat, low cholesterol(HEALTHY) and the amount of butter in all this was appalling. My husband and I who both love sea bass felt sick to our stomachs half way through (the bass was fine) because of all the fat content and we threw the rest of the precious sea bass away which I normally wouldn't dream of doing. The mustard taste was also too strong. I would not make this again nor would I serve it to any health conscious person.
