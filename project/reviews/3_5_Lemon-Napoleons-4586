This is a great recipe with a minor tweak that happened because guests didn't want to wait for assembly. We spooned the lemon mixture into fancy glasses; garnished with the phyllo crisps and some raspberries. Only way I make it now and everyone loves it.

Made this recipe last week and my family loved them. Since I had halved the recipe, they asked why I didn't make more. Needless to say, as I had left over ingredients, I made more this week. The napoleons were not too sweet which is always a hit with my family. I only omitted the powdered sugar. Instead, I used a bit of the cinammon sugar as a topping.

This is a wonderful dessert! If you don't have time, you can use prepared lemon curd... this is a great bridal shower dessert. I have made it several times and never had anyone who didn't love it

I feel that this is a fabulous recipe. The lemon curd is delicious. There is alot of work involved in the pastries, but I cut the 3" squares diagonally and created twice the deserts. I work in a 4 star restaurant as a waiter and the chef has asked for the recipe so he can serve them to our guest.

There was a lot of work involved in making this dessert, and the disappointing factor is that it didn't come out tasting incredible. Yes, it was nice tasting. But, for all of the work that was put into it, this was a waste of time and effort.
