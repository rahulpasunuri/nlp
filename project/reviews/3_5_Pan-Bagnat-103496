I never thought a tuna sandwich could taste so good. To avoid soggy bread, I made sure that my wet ingredients were as dry as possible by straining them well and patting them dry with paper towels. Make sure that you do spread oil evenly on the bread and use olive oil-packed tuna. I think the oil layer prevented the juices from soaking into the bread. I also flipped the sandwich occasionally while it was sitting in the fridge to redistribute the juices. This is definitely the king of tuna sandwiches. I loved it and look forward to making it for many future meals.

Had it on the boat toady. Great receipe. Shredded Daikon radish, and some bib lettuce made it better (put lettuce on bread before "wet" ingredients). I liked it made in advance, although must use good crusty bread to hold up.

I made this sandwich for a picnic last weekend. Everyone loved it, and I plan on making it again and again. I replaced the tuna with roasted pork loin I'd made the night before--everything else I kept the same. Also, the oil/garlic brushed onto the bread really soaked through and made the leftover sandwich soggy (had to replace the bread). My recommendation would be to brush less oil/just as much garlic in between one of the layers of ingredients instead of directly on the bread. Delicious! People who swore they wouldn't eat anchovies gladly devoured them.

Have made this sandwich a few times this summer. Like it better made just prior to eating. Tried it this time using toasted sourdough bread from a local bakery. Best tuna sandwich I've ever made, and easy to assemble, too!

When we were living in the south of France, we are this sandwich from stands along the beach and in the beautiful cafes. There were many variations and you get closer to the salade if you add sliced boiled egg and usually there were thin radish slices instead of onion. Also a regular french vinagrette (mustard, oil, vinegar) was distinctive. A wonderful sandwich though.

Neither I nor my guests were too crazy about this sandwich. I used a good chunk white tuna but it still had a slightly fishy taste that I didn't care for. And yet, I've had Salad Nicoise and I loved that!

Delicious. I will never make tuna salad with mayo again! Bread does get soggy if made ahead of time however; I liked it best when assembled immediately before eating.

Very good and tasty. Not quite as good as real salade Nicoise, but delicious just the same. I used a sourdough boule versus a baguette and that worked out well; the triangle-shaped sandwiches I sliced from it were very pretty. I had a hard time using more than two sliced tomatoes, but this may be a result of using a round loaf. Try to eat it all up at once, as the bottom layer of bread gets very soggy and unappetizing after a day or two (I wound up discarding it and eating the filling with a fork). The reviewer below me has got it right; it looks exactly like a sandwich you'd get in a fancy deli. Num num.

This was a tasty sandwich, reminiscent of salad Nicoise. It tastes like something you would buy at a gourmet takeout food store. It's nice that you make it ahead of time.
