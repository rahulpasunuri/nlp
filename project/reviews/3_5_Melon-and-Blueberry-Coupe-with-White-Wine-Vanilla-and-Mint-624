This was delicious, even without the honeydew. The vanilla-wine-mint combination is definitelly more than the sum of its parts. A wonderfully refreshing finish to a summer meal.

This dish did not knock my socks off. It was okay and likeable but not special. The recipe makes more than six portions. The ingredients contain ten cups of fruit, not to mention liquid. It was okay.

This is such a simple, yet delicately flavored dish! I had a honeydew that turned out to be not sweet at all (it's still early in the season), and I was looking for something simple to do with it. I cut it into cubes instead of using a melon baller, and I didn't have any mint. However, the wine brought out this wonderful fragrance in the melon, and somebody actually thought that I had added honey to the marinade! I did have to add 1/4 cup more sugar to compensate for this particular melon, and it wasn't too sweet at all. I'll have to try the complete recipe next time.

Light, luscious and refreshing, this is the perfect ending to a formal or informal dinner on a hot summer day. I have made it several times to great acclaim and keep it in my "precious" file. In my view the dish is even better with just blueberries and honeydew melon than with cantaloupe.

I doubled the amount of fruit and made this a fruit salad rather than a dessert. Serving it this way the dressing was just enough to be delicate and not too sweet. It was wonderful and everyone at dinner requested the recipe.
