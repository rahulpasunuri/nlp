In my experience, this soup bombed out. Usually I don't follow recipes exactly; I have fun and get creative with what I'm doing. I'm thinking NOT doing that on this occasion was a major error on my part. This soup tasted and had the consistency of very very bland mashed potatoes. Don't be fooled by the yummy-sounding name.

Not only was this soup fast and easy, it was also delicious. They key is to go with your own tastes. I used more bacon than recommeneded but also more spices; it really does have a chili flavour. The next time I might dry adding a few teaspoons of salsa. Very hearty on a cold night but not recommended for those who only enjoy traditional soups packed with meat/veggies. Yum!
