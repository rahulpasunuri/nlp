Fantastic! And, really, one of the easiest desserts I've ever put together. I topped mine with a little toasted coconut, a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, a little whipped cream and a sliver of crystallized ginger. Much to my surprise, even I liked it (although I'm not usually a fan of banana desserts).

I made this for a dinner party of 8 and received the equivalent of a standing ovation- outstanding recipe. I topped with toasted banana bread spears, drizzled with melted dark chocolate and toasted pecans on top and finished with a small scoop of home made coconut ice cream. Best. Dessert. Ever.

Be warned, this is precedent setting dessert. People will not look at you the same again. I topped with toasted banana bread spears, drizzled dark chocolate, toasted pecans and homemade coconut ice cream.... out of this world.

I love this recipe. It's so easy and tastes great! I did not have rum, so I used brandy and added a little orange juice too. Love it with a little low fat vanilla ice cream.

Everyone LOVED this! Served it with the Coffee Bean Granita and fresh whipped cream. Our guests said these may have been the best bananas they have ever eaten.

Another way of doing this is to leave the banana in its skin and just cut open, lengthwise, on top and spread out a bit. Put ingredients onto bananas and bake on a pan. Any juices that run out can be poured on top when served. You can also do this on the bbque! Very yummy with a dollop of cream.

My boyfriend and I LOVE this recipe! It's amazing that something so delicious is so simple to make. The combination of rum, cinnamon and nutmeg is wonderful. Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream this desert is divine!

Delicious, easy to whip up. I skip the butter---you don't really need it. I usually serve with vanilla ice cream. Would also be yummy with toasted pound cake.

A real winner! Delicious and an instant favorite. Great use for over ripe bananas! You can use bourbon.

I made this just as described, but in a larger quantity and with kentucky bourbon (because I couldn't find the dark rum I KNOW is in my liquor cabinet!). Used bananas that were over-ripe: it was either this or banana bread. I'm SO glad I made this. If your nutmeg and cinnamon is fresh, wow... Fabulous.
