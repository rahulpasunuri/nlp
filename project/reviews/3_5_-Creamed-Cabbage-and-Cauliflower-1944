So easy, so delicious! Everything just works... I can't say what part I like best. I used frozen cauliflower, so the florets weren't as small as they would have been if fresh, but everyone loved this for our Thanksgiving meal.

Very good. Some of my family topped it with sharp cheddar, but I prefer it as is. No mace, so I substituted nutmeg. A hearty, satisfying side dish that tastes much richer than it is!

Loved this. I made it with evaporated skim milk that I had in the cupboard. We normally only drink rice milk, but I didn't think that would do the trick in this recipe. I used more veggies than called for and added some salt plus a generous amount of black pepper. It wasn't bland at all after some proper seasoning. Definitely a dish that tastes rich and decadent without all of the bad stuff. Gotta love it!

Just cooked this few minutes ago - used a handful of various spices (scared by the "bland" reviews), and added some powdered milk as well to thicken the sauce - proved to be a hearty and comforting meal, will surely make this again.

This recipe came out well but only after I adopted a couple of the suggestions other reviewers gave. I (about) doubled the recipe and used a whole head of cabbage and a whole head of cauliflower, plus a handful of small potatoes. I doubled the milk as well, and used 2% instead of 1%, which is what we keep in the house. I added salt and pepper, 1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese and 2 heaping spoonfuls of sour cream. This gave it the creamy consistency I was looking for and great flavor.

I used low-fat butter, soymilk instead of low-fat milk, and sweet potato with skin in place of the russet. I also added a tbsp of soy cream cheese and some parmesean. I paired the dish with baked teriyaki salmon and stir-fried mushrooms and onions. I cooked it for much longer than the recipe called for. Delicious!

Vegetable alchemy. I eat this for breakfast. Made it with nonfat milk and added a tiny bit of heavy cream. I agree with the cook who suggested adding a bit of dry, salty grated cheese. Manchego works well - although these flavors could stand up to something a little stronger. What a way to get your antioxidants!

This is surprisingly delicious. I did, however, make it with whole milk and a little cream as I don't purchase low-fat anything!

This was a lovely contrast to pan seared salmon with red wine/balsamic reduction. Like everyone else I modified slightly by adding some salty, dry grated cheese. Gruyere would work best I think. Great fall/winter dish.

Disappointing, especially considering the great reviews. Very white, bland and pale; not bad per se, but certainly nothing to rave about.

Delicious low-fat recipe. However, I found it a bit bland until I added some lemon juice. I also agree with other reviewers that the cooking times -- for both steps -- are longer than indicated.

This was really good although after the 1% milk reduced I didn't think it was very creamy so I added about 2 Tbls heavy cream. That was the ticket. I used mace to season. Served with Porcini dusted Opakapaka. Fabulous! I will try it next time with saffron.

I am not a big fan of cabbage, but love brussels sprouts (which is a type of cabbage anyways), so I substituted. I used only skim milk, but added a tablespoon of sour cream at the end to make it creamier. The only thing I didn't have was nutmeg or mace. It seemed kind of bland. I wonder if that was why.

Wonderful taste. I added 2 teaspoons of creme fraiche to make it creamier. I should have chopped the cabbage finer, though. It took too long to get as soft as I wanted it and I had to resort to adding a lot of water and whey to make it work. I didn't have cauliflower available this time. I will definitely try this again exactly as it's written!

I wanted to try this with salmon, as recommended, even though I didn't have the potato. It was really great - don't leave out fresh ground nutmeg at the end!

Oh my gosh! This was a fantastic side dish!!! The only adjustment I made was to use skim milk and a little fat free half and half instead of the low fat milk. You may need to cook it a little longer than suggested in the recipe. It even works with Weight Watchers!! Eat and enjoy!:)

I have to laugh when reviewers assign forks and then confess that they've massively modified the recipe...so today it's my turn. I started to make this recipe and realized that the half head of savoy cabbage was no longer in the fridge. So, I pinch-hitted: I diced a rutabaga real small and proceeded. The result was just great. A fine invention. I served it with steamed salmon and the combo was so healthy and tasty that it is destined to become a favorite.

Didn't have any cauliflower, so increased cabbage and potatoes, diced potatoes about 3/4" , no low fat milk, just skim so added 1 TBS heavy cream, YUMMY

Like another cook I tried this to get our allotment of cruciferous veggies. The sauce never thickened adequately for my taste. As is seems a bit anemic. I added about 3T of cream cheese which added both flavor and thickness. With those additions I felt it was much improved and would definitely make it again.

This is a good recipe, but it has quite a light taste. I recommend eating it with something more flavorful, it will enhance its taste (I ate it with smoked salmon and that was a good combination).

Sounds awful, doesn't it ? But it is delicious. Decided to try it looking for (new) ways to serve cruciferous vegetables -- the cabbage family -- known to guard against cancer. Quite certain this is really an old recipe -- because it has that taste of 'grandma's house'. It is also the first time my husband ate his cauliflower all up. I used nearly double the milk because I like everything really creamy. Remember to freshly grate your nutmeg.
