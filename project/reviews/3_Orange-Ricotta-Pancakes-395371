I thought these were disappointing. Easy to make, pretty, but bland - nothing special.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! Whenever I make pancakes, I make them with ricotta cheese, but only with blueberries for some reason. So I saw this and thought, why not? It was great! Just enough sugar, the orange wasn't too overpowering, and they were light and fluffy like a cloud. Thanks so much for the recipe, I'm making this for my mom!
