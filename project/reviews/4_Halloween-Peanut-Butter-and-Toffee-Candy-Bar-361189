Easy. I used a Graham cracker crust as the base with bittersweet chocolate, crushed Butter Fingers, pb M&M's, pretzels and drizzled with white chocolate. The salty pretzels helped balance the sweetness. Easy to make with pantry items.

The best thing I can say for this recipe is that aesthetically, it works well for Halloween. Sadly, the flavor doesn't live up to the ingredients. I love all those candies on their own, but brought together, it just tasted like a sugary mess. Also, when I chopped the bark into pieces, a good amount of the candies fell off, defeating the purpose. If I were to make it again I would only use flavors that work together: the PB cups, reeses pieces, and peanuts- and skip the butterfinger and toffee. I have rarely been disappointed by recipes at Epicurious, but sadly, this was one of those times.

As a previous reviewer posted, sprinkling the chocolate with fine sea salt before the addition of the candy is definitely what elevates this recipe to delicious and keeps the sweetness in check. A wonderful hostess gift that can be customized to the season or tastes of the recipient. Decadent!

So good. I have made this a million times and it is always a hit! Really easy too. Definitely a keeper.

Made this for Valentine's day with red, pink and white jelly bellies, and plain and peanut M &Ms mixed in with other recommended candy.

I made a mint holiday version of this with York peppermint patties, Andes mints, candy cane Hershey's kisses, white chocolate dipped pretzels, crushed candy canes, and red & green M&Ms, and it was delicious!

Great recipe, everyone loved it and couldn't stop eating it. I'm making it this time for Christmas. Topping suggestions: broken candy canes, red and green M&Ms, maybe Andes mints instead of the peanut butter cups. If it doesn't get all eaten I plan to give some to the mailman, grandkids teachers, etc. To the cook in Portland...lame? Have you tried it? Yes, it is easier to just give a bag of candy to someone rather than take the time to put something a little special together.

Love this recipe, its brilliance is in its simplicity. I have been contemplating a December edition of this same dish ... suggestions on the candy toppings to use?

This "recipe" seems totally lame. Just eat the damn candy as is.

P.S. I didn't bother to pick out yellow and orange M&Ms. I used Nestle's semi sweet chocolate chips and they melted and tasted just fine. I did however use the Lindt white chocolate bar. I was afraid of the white chocolate chips. Never being a fan of white chocolate, now I know why: I had never had any GOOD white chocolate before! I disagree with the others. DO GET the Lindt white chocolate. I believe it does add to the recipe not only visually but in taste, also!

OH MY GOD!!! Go to the store, buy chocolate chips and candy bars. Chop them up. Melt chocolates. Spread chocolate into a prepared pan, top with chopped candy bars, drizzle with more chocolate. Eat!!!!! The only change I can see in the recipe is that IT SERVES ONE!!! My suggestion is to make this to take somewhere or to give out! I dont' think I can be trusted with this alone! IT is the easiest and BEST candy dessert ever!! Could it be that it uses my favorite candy bars? I am glad that I made it to give half of it away. Unfortunately my husband is not eating his share fast enough!! I can't stop eating it!!

This is very easy! And it's candy stuck to melted-down chocolate; what's not to like? However, to all you reviewers who (like me) didn't get why it calls for high-quality white chocolate for the drizzle: crappy white chocolate (like the Nestle chips I used) melt down funny. It morphed into dark chocolate and tasted slightly burned on the finished product. Definitely buy the good stuff and melt the chocolate in a double boiler to avoid burning. Great fun to do, though. No need to follow this recipe to the letter - just grab your favorite candy, chop it up, throw it on the bark, and you've got a great little treat!

A quick follow-up: I got a text from a friend of my son's telling me that this candy "kicks a$$," the highest compliment I could get from a college student, I suppose. Make this recipe!

I haven't made this yet, but for the salty kick I'm thinking of adding a few broken up pretzel sticks.

This is exceptional! I made it for a big potluck last weekend, and it was the only dish that was gone by the end of the meal. Just make sure you press all the ingredients into the melted chocolate so everything adheres. And yes, the white chocolate is there to make sure the Reese's Pieces and Peanut M&Ms stick to the candy. I agree with the idea of sprinkling a little sea salt on the chocolate, and I will do that the next time I make this. Also, make sure you wait until the candy is good and chilled before breaking it up. We got impatient and tried to do it just a couple of minutes too soon and had to slip it back into the fridge. This also travels well - I sent some to my son in college, and now I'm the mom everyone wants to have!

I made this afternoon and it was simple and easy, especially if you microwave the chocolate to melt it. Use large Pyrex measuring cups or other glass/ see through microwave safe containers and melt chips 30-60 seconds at a time, then stir. It will only take 1-2 minutes and the chocolate will be exactly as the recipe calls for - warm and spreadable- not hot or clumpy. The Butterfinger bars chopped into one inch pieces seemed a little too large and they did not adhere all that well to the chocolate base, so I would chop them a bit more finely next time. I agree with poster who suggested sprinkling a tiny bit of salt on the chocolate- the bark needs it with so many sweet ingredients. White chocolate drizzle is not for flavor or even decorative purposes as much as a security blanket to ensure that the top layer of ingredients will stick!

The hardest part is not eating the candy as you are making this recipe, which is very easy and comes out looking just like the picture. I like the way the final product looks with the white chocolate but it isn't necessary to spend the extra money as it doesn't add to the overall taste. I froze the candy and then sent it on to my daughters' at college, where it was, of course, a huge hit.

This was really great! Everyone loved it and it was SUPER easy to make! One tip of advice: do NOT overheat the chocolate! I had to spend a bit of extra time smoothing out the chocolate because it began to clump together when I had it under the heat for too long. I did follow the recipe and used an entire lindt white chocolate bar to spread on top and I think it really added to it and stayed on it when I cracked it. Definitely an easy party treat!

AWESOME!! I can't seem to keep enough of this made. I agree with previous review about not worrying about white chocolate or colors. It's just all good. I also added some candy corn to make it look even more Halloweeny. This is sinfully delicious. A real keeper!

Excellent! A couple suggestions...I added some freshly grated sea salt to the chocolate layer after spreading it on the cookie sheet just to offset the sweetness of all the candy. Also, FWIW, the way the bark looks before it's broken up into small pieces is significantly different than after it's broken. So, next time, I'll probably skip the white chocolate because it doesn't add anything to the overall flavor, you really don't notice it esthetically once the bark's broken up, and it adds to expense and effort without noticeable effect. And, in the same vein, because the Butterfinger and Reese's PB Cups split and shred when you break up the bark, taking the time and effort to pick out specific M&M and/or Reese's Pieces colors is wasted effort. The overall coloration is chocolate brown and peanut butter orange regardless. So next time I'll just use all the colors. Hubby loves this candy and, so far, can't keep his hands off it$
