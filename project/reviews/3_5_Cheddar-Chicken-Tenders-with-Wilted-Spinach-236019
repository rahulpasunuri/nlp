When I make the chicken I add some Soy sauce to the mustard and marinate about 30 minutes to an hour. Then I add curry, garlic powder and smoked paprika to the crackers. This is such a favorite at our house our guests even ask if I will make it when they come over for dinner! So easy!

I dipped the chicken tenders in Ranch Dressing and used Club Crackers for the coating. The entire family loved them, and the chicken was so tender!

These were a hit with the kids and the adults. We don't do mustard so we dipped them in a heavy cream and sriracha hot sauce mix. I made two batch the first the coating was soggy, the second was crisp the only difference was the pan was preheated the second time. I didn't flip them either time.

Surprisingly good! Even my picky-I-only-like-gourmet-meals husband loved these. Truly! I have a 1.5 year old who's picky but loves mustard and cheese, so these are a no-brainer. I made the recipe pretty much exactly as noted except I "marinated" the tenders in the mustard, with a bit of salt & pepper (all in a large zipper bag) for about 3 hours. These were delicious and moist (!!!). I also made the spinach but added garlic. Delicious!

SO good...my three year old and husband both loved them. I substituted goldfish crackers and some sesame street cheddar crackers for the cheeze-its...delish!

Just made the chicken 30 minutes ago and it was so delicious that I wanted to write the review right away. Mustard and Cheez-its! Who would have ever thought! We loved it!

This was great for my 1 year old baby boy. He only has 2 teeth, but he's started being really picky about his dinner foods. He'd love to be able to just eat baby snacks all day. So I made the chicken with ranch instead of dijon, and goldfish instead of cheez-its, and steamed carrots instead of spinach. He ate it all. One point mommy. My husband and I also ate them dipped in ranch dressing as an appetizer.

I can't rate because I didn't follow it - I used Rice Chex and some fresh Parmesan since I'm gluten free, but it turned out great. I'll do it again. I served it with mashed potatoes, and it was a quick, comforting dinner.

The kids and hubby loved this one. Will do again. The wilted spinach was not such a hit with the kids, but the adults loved it. Might try it again seasoned differently.

A nice easy weekend night meal. I used alumninum foil for easy clean up and didn't flip the tenders

My kids didn't like the mustard taste (which I can't understand because I put dijon on their turkey sandwiches), so I may try it with Ranch next time. Ran out of Cheez-its, so I used Goldfish and it worked well. For the first batch, I oiled the pan,and the coating was soft and didn't stick to the chicken very well. For the 2nd batch, I sprayed the pan with olive oil spray and the topping was cruchy and the chicken didn't stick to the pan. My husband, who thinks most chicken is just a vehicle for sauces or dips, loved these and went dip-free through the whole meal.

Yum! Have made several times - it is a favorite with both kids and husband.

Everyone I have made this for, loves the recipe. The chicken stays moist and the cheese-its add a nice crunch not to mention a delicious taste. This is a great way to use up cheese-its that are on their way south. I spray my pan with cooking spray and then spritz the chicken as well, omitting the olive oil, and I get crunchy chicken that doesn't stick at all!

My two sons ages 4 and 5 love this recipe, as does my picky husband. I use less mustard and don't have the soggy problem. The chicken is delicious, and even my kids love the spinach!!!

This was quick, easy, and pretty tasty. We didn't have any of the troubles other reviewers mentioned. My husband ate this with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, but I enjoyed them plain.

I thought this dish was ok but my very picky husband LOVED it. The chicken didn't stick to the pan for me. I put the pan in the oven with the oil for a minute or two before adding the chicken and I think that helped. Also I didn't have enough dijon so I used ranch dressing with half of my tenders and it worked just as well. The coating even stuck a little better with the ranch. I am making it for the second time this evening at my husband's request.

Easy and delicious. Yummy taste but my chicken did stick a bit. I will try a bit more oil the next time.

I did not have any problems with the chicken sticking to the pan. I substituted Cheetos for the Cheez Its. It was interesting, but after two days I still cannot get the orange stains from my fingers.

I used a rimmed baking sheet and was very liberal when I brushed on the olive oil... I had NO problems with sticking! :) Not crispy, but still delish. I served with honey for dipping. Super easy, great weeknight meal.

Yummy and easy. I used tin foil which seemed to alleviate the sticking problem.

Very yummy--makes great, relatively healthy chicken tenders! The recipe was very simple and quick, the flavors of the mustard and cracker crust were totally yummy, and the chicken stayed moist. Like other reviewers, I did have a problem with the crust slipping off when I flipped them, but found that using a spatula rather than tongs solved the problem. The crust was more moist than crunchy, but we liked that. Delicious for a weeknight meal with spinach and the wine and maple syrup glazed carrots from the same Gourmet.

Yes, they were not perfectly crispy, and yes, they stuck to the pan....but this was still an easy, yummy, decadent comfort-food meal. I made exactly as written, except halved the butter on the spinach and increased the cooking time on the tenders by to about 18 minutes. I also served w/BBQ sauce. I think this a meal to serve little kids as well as big kids. (evidenced by the delight of my football-watching fiancee:)

I had the same problem that others did with the breading sticking to the pan. I chose to leave them unturned for the entire cooking, which seemed to help somewhat. It was an amazingly quick recipe (great for rush home from work weekday meals), and everyone enjoyed it. It's certainly not gourmet, or for a fancy dinner, but it will show up again at our house when we're short on time. By the way, I only made the chicken, so can't review the spinach.

Good twist on boring chicken. No problem with sticking, make sure you coat the pan well.

Rating: 1
Agree with others about the chicken being soggy. That was my husband's first comment. I thought it was because I used a pyrex dish rather than a baking sheet. While it sounded good on paper, I won't be making it again.

Rating: 2
This was okay, but not great. When I flipped the chicken halfway through cooking, the breading stuck to the baking sheet even though I oiled the pan liberally. It tasted fine, but just not worth cranking up the oven to 475 and making my house really hot.

Was not crispy and the coating fell off when i flipped them for the second half of cooking time. Giving it two stars because as you eat it, the flavor kind of grows on you.

Yuk. There is nothing special about this recipe. Plus, the mustard makes the cheezit crumbs too moist w/o sealing in the juices, resulting in soft crumbs (not crisp) that fell off easily. Egg and dry progresso bread crumbs (w/ some grated reggiano thrown in yields a better finished product & crisper coating. After all the 4 forks, I thought I'd give it a try for a weeknight. The kids thought it was ok but not great. Will not do again.

This was just terrific. My preschooler was scarfing them down and I couldn't stop eating them either!

My husband is a chicken fan to start, but he ADORED this dish. Afterward he asked if we could have a chicken tender night each week :) I used Reduced-Fat Cheez-Its and it came out great. We accompanied the tenders with Sweet Baby Ray's barbeque sauce, and they were perfect together. Some green beans tossed in oil & vinegar on the side and a little salt and pepper and it was an easy delicious meal with minimal clean up!

This was surprisingly good! Very quick and easy to make. My boys loved it! I think I will try different Cheez-It flavors for next time.

Fast, easy and delicious! I didn't have cheddar crackers so used wheat thins veggie crackers and dijonnaise instead of mustard.

Tasty and easy! I used regular yellow mustard since it's what I had in the fridge and they tasted great. Made them with white cheddar shells and green beans and my BF loved it.

My family loved this recipe. I substituted dijonaise for the dijon mustard. Great recipe!

This recipe is both good and ridiculously easy so I will definitely make it again. A few small changes: I baked the chicken on SilPat instead of using oil and I made the spinach with EVOO and garlic instead of the recommended butter and salt, which I think is both healthier and provides a nicer flavor complement. Also, I sprinkled some of the crust crumbs from the baking sheet over the spinach which was tasty.

Rating: 4
Easy and a really great flavor! I was a little worried about the "Cheez-It" factor, since I'm not a fan, but it turned out wonderfully. The recipe took only a couple of minutes, the chicken stayed moist and the mustard was great. Worked well for me since I had 4+ bottles of stone ground mustard, for some odd reason in my cabinet. My husband and I both thought it great...he ate the rest of it that night!

This is super tasty and super fast. It also is not quite as cheesy and fake tasting as you might imagine. It's kind of sophisticated.

This is easy - easy - easy. The chicken is moist. It's great. I served it with fruit salad rather than spinach.
