I followed recipe exactly and it was perfect - vibrant green and still a bit crunchy. Unfortunately, they couldn't be served hot - so I would follow "vanhols1 from Chicago"'s 01/30/12 advice to make it the last thing to throw in the oven so the flavours are at their height. (It was fun to decorate the platter with slices of red pepper.)

Super easy, and tasty! I used to saute asparagus in olive oil right before a meal, but this is great to do ahead, and just throw in when the main dish comes out of the oven.

This is an excellent dish. I used more garlic than asked....I love garlic. I didn't have any onion powder so looked for something with it in it. I used 'Mrs. Dash' 1 tsp, and it came out great.

Outstanding! Will try it with other vegetables next time, too. Simple to make, but so delicious.

This was excellent and super easy. I made this twice for two different Seder dinners I went too. First time I made it as written. The second time I just put everything in a Pyrex baking dish and microwaved it. There wasn't room in my hosts oven, plus the asparagus isn't truly roasted (baked till starting to brown). Plus it seemed silly to dirty a jelly rool pan in the oven and a another pan for the oil. It ended up tasting just as good all microwaved together as cooked separately. I used about half the oil and garlic, and I made sure to season well with salt. I will be making this often and in the microwave!

This is my to-go recipe for making asparagus. Occasionally I make it without parsley, and it's still just as delicious. My family loves this recipe.

Super easy and flavorful. I mixed it in with a handful of whole wheat pasta and some fresh chipotle chevre from my local farmers market - made for a delicious light dinner all by itself. Would also add some prosciutto if I had it on hand next time.

This was delicious. I used only about 5 garlic cloves and that was plenty. Good cold the next day, too.

I followed this recipe step by step but forgot about it in the oven. It cooked for about 15 minutes. It came out great though. I had cooked some chicken with a white sauce and wine, peppers, cherry tomatoes, basil, tortellini all that jazz with it. I put the asparagus in with the left overs all mixed together. The next day the asparagus had turned into stringy flavor bombs.

Easy yet tasty. I didn't have any parsley on hand, so I made it without parsley.
