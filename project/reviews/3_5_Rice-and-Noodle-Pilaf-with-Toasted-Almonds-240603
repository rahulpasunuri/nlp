My family loved this dish, especially my two picky young children. I didn't have a cinnamon stick and I added onions and used pine nuts instead of almonds. Still giving it 4 forks, because i think its a great base recipe to play with and would be wonderful as-is YUM!

I substituted capellini (broken into smaller bits) for the orzo, took a little less time to brown. I also used chicken broth instead of water. It turned out delicious! I liked that it was a but bland, because I served it with beef kebabs, and a roasted red pepper sauce; it made a nice and simple side.

The kids loved it because it was a bland. It was yummy but,needs more seasoning. A keeper. Next time I'll try the lemon squeeze at the end and add some ground cinnamon.

Very easy to make and fairly good, although it makes far more than 8 servings. It was a bit bland by itself (and I followed the recipe exactly). Adding the toasted almonds and a fresh squeeze of lemon juice over each serving made a big, big difference. It was also a bit difficult to find and discard the lemon peel afterwards... I'll probably use thicker slices next time.

I made this according to directions except that I used pre-ground cinnamon instead of a whole cinnamon stick. I'm sure using the cinnamon stick would have added a lot of flavor and I would recommend doing that instead of using pre- ground cinnamon. When I tried the pilaf before adding the almonds, it was pretty bland. The almonds made all of the difference and really make the dish quite good. I used high quality almonds and I was glad I did because the flavor was very robust and complimented the pilaf quite nicely. I had it with broccoli on the side and the taste of the broccoli was good with the pilaf. I would definitely recommend this dish.
