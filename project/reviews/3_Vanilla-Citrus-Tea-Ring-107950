Whoops! Meant to say I did NOT use veg oil - I used extra light olive oil.

I'm not sure what I did right, but this was AMAZING!!! Moist and just so darn good - especially when we drizzled it with honey instead of making a glaze! I used veg. oil and chopped the tar out of those zests/peels because I hate grit. I also used real buttermilk. The only thing I did differently was sub A-P flour + baking powder + salt instead of the self-rising.

I loved this recipe! The second time it made the cake, I sifted the flour to make it less dense. Much better.

Oily, dense; perhaps there was an error in the recipe. Ugh-deserves a no-fork rating.

Very good & moist. Will definitely make this again.
