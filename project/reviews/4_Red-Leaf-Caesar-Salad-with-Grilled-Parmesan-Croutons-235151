Excellent! Delicious! Made without the anchovies. The parmesan cheese toasts are wonderful! Great light meal.

Beautiful simple salad that was really delicious. I wouldn't call the bread "croutons" though. More like cheesy garlic bread. But no matter what you call them, they were perfect.

This is not my all time favorite caesar dressing but I gave it an extra fork because it is so easy to make. This is very tasty and avoids raw or coddled eggs, which means I can save the leftovers for a day or two. I would feel comfortable serving this at a dinner party.

Very nice with red leaf lettuce....I liked the dressing too!!! Usually make another one on the site with mayo so this was nice and light for summer....served it with Beer Marinated Flank steak (from this site) and Tyler Florences Roasted Potatoes

I gave this 4 forks because it is so easy, quick and tastes fabo! I took a reviewers suggestion and cut the broiled bread into cubes. It didn't work great because the cubes were too soft. Next time I will cut the bread into triangles for serving. I had anchovy paste on hand and it worked out great.

Amazing! Easy and taste just as the classic!

I love this caesar dressing because it is sooooo easy (no need resort to anchovy paste as ellen did - it's made in a blender - whole fillets do just fine and have better flavor). I love anchovies so I usually double amount in dressing and top the salad with additional fillets (if you can find marinaded white anchovies for the top even better - they have a lemony fresh flavor). I also toss salad with fresh grated parmesan as hungrychic does. Delicious and easy! I make this often.

Excellent version, I complete by adding 1/4 cup of grated cheese. Sometimes I use garlic pita chips for the croutons.

Excellent variation of a classic. The red leaf lettuce is so pretty! I often serve it with a caesar "vinaigrette" omitting the anchovies.

I have already made this again! And I am sure I will do so many times more. It is delicious and easy - made even easier by the fact that I used anchovy paste (it comes in a tube - the brand I found is called Roland)). And the second time I made it I embellished it by adding the leftover chicken I had grilled a couple of nights before (using the recipe for turkey cutlets with cilantro almond sauce- also yummy - http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/1222186?mbid=RF ) I also added a perfectly ripe avocado and some wonderful fresh tomatoes. Made for a perfect meal on a hot summer night. And I think the whole thing took about 10 minutes to put together.

I usually do not enjoy eating anchovies, but this salad dressing is a keeper! I've already made this about 6 times - It has become a "tried and true" recipe in our house! Great flavor!

Very good - liked the idea of using red leaf instead of boring romaine. I decided to cut the croutons into bite sized peices instead of having slices and it worked out great. I also cut the anchoives down to 1 instead of 3 since I prefer a more lemon than fishy flavor.

Though I tend to be a purist and like a good strong, lemony caesar salad, this is a safe bet for a group (where someone is bound not to like the classic!). I prepared the dressing as written, and where it said 'lemon juice to taste' I just put in the juice of half a lemon...there were no leftovers, and I quite like it!!
