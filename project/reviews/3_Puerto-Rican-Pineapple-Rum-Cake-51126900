Made this over the weekend, everyone loved it. My husband said it was the best cake he's ever had. I did add 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder. I think next time I will slice pineapple a bit thicker to have more of that delicousness on top!

This cake is absolutely delicious, easy and my family finished it before it had time to cool. The sauce is delicious and makes turns this cake into something more than just an upsidedown pineapple cake. for the cook who thinks it needs either baking powder or baking soda, if you beat the sugar and butter until very fluffy and keep on beating after each egg addition until the mix becomes very fluffy and light, the cake will rise beyond your expectations. I thought this would have a very dense crumb as the recipe does not ask for any kind of liquid, but it is not so. It doesn't crumble when cut (even when warm) and it absorbs the sauce perfectly. I'm making it again for our Fellowship meeting at church next week.
