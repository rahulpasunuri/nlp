Delicious and super fast. I used a can of white pinto beans - I was in a rush - and it turned out great. Healthy and elegant barbeque fare!

Very good. Easy to make. I added the garlic and dijon mustard as suggested by a previous post. I also added some finely chopped parsley. I served this with asparagus and it was great!

Simple and lovely!

Great recipe. Subtle flavor and very light as a dressing. I used 2 tbsp each lemon juice and olive oil and added 1/2 tsp. dijon mustard and a large clove of minced garlic. Definitely worth a repeat.

The cook from Fla must have had bad oil or bad lemons, is all I can figure. I mean, it's lemon juice and oil. How could that possible be a bad thing? Just try again with quality oil, light if you prefer it, and good fresh lemons.

Very good vinagrette that I've also used on other vegetables, such as steamed green beans and asparagus.

I have to disagree with the cook form Florida. This is a fine, simple, tangy vinegrette. We too used this for the chicken and caper dish. So simple and tasty. Took the advice of another reviewer and added a little garlic and dijon. Good! This would be great on green beans, asparagus, sauted spinach and even green salad if you like things really lemony.

I'm sorry but I thought this was TERRIBLE! Don't waste your time!

Used with the sauteed chicken breasts with capers. I saved a little and dressed the green beans with it--a nice change from butter!

Could not POSSIBLY be easier -- makes a great subtle side that doesn't overwhelm whatever it's topping (I used it on asparagus).

This is our family's favorite dressing other than Caesar. I add 1 tsp. of dijon mustard and several large cloves of garlic.

I liked it but wonder could vinegarette be warm and also use white wine and demiglaze? Or do you have a recipe with capers, lemon demiglae and white wine with chicken
