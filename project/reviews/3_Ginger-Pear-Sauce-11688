We left out the pear nectar and dried pears (weren't on hand) and it was very tasty! I think we'll use a little less vanilla next time. A delicious change from applesauce!

I found the pairing of pears and ginger highly satisfying. It is quite similar to apple sauce but the added flavour of the ginger really sets it apart.
