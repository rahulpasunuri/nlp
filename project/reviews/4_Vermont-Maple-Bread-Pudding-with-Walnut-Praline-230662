The best dessert you will ever make. Your family, your friends will LOVE you for making this. I have been making this since 2006, and i still get requests for the recipe every time I make it. I opt out of the praline and instead make a quick homemade caramel sauce as follows: For caramel sauce: Whisk 1 stick butter and 1 cup brown sugar over low heat in a medium sauce pan, until butter is melted and mixture is smooth. Add 1 cup heavy cream and continue to cook and stir until warm and silky smooth. Spoon over individual servings of bread pudding.

Much, much, much too sweet! Next time I would use 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of the maple syrup. No pralines, but instead toast walnuts and sprinkle over the top. No ice cream. I used fresh bread and it was much too mushy. I should have used day old bread. Also a lite cream would have been okay to use instead of the heavy.

I made this to 5 times the amount with leftover waffles and bread at my work place. Instead of the syrup i added 1# (pound) of mini marshmallows and 2# of chocolate chips. Yum! Yum! Your recipe is great and i will continue to use it. We served it warm at our breakfast buffet and people have devoured it. Also to keep it moist i used regular pancake syrup to drizzle over it. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.

I am learning not to vary the recipes on the first try. This bread pudding is FABULOUS!!! I'm singing as I say that. I used challah bread since I couldn't find brioche anywhere. Anyway, it was absolutely delicious and it really needs nothing else, however I did do the carmel sauce others recommended and everyone was quite happy. Bummer is some people won't even try bread pudding so I ate 4 pieces!!

I could only find commercial challah, which was very dark. So, I cut off the crust and weighed out enough to make one pound. I also used light cream.It turned out very good. I didn't make the topping; there is no need for it.I would like to try it with brioche next time, and yes, there will definately be a next time!

I have made this dish three times now, never with the praline, always with the ice cream. It's good fresh out of the oven, chilled next day, in any form. I'm going to try it with half and half next time just to cut down on the fat, but it's divine and worth every calorie. When I promise to make it there is an audible sigh of anticipatory delight from my family.

I've made several bread puddings but this is by far the best - it's comparable to my favorite restaurant version. I skipped the pralines and maple drizzle and next time I will use less sugar as it was a bit too sweet for my tastes. I love the way the top is crispy when it's fresh out of the oven.

Suggest serving it for brunch with toasted nuts and a little maple syrup instead of the praline and ice cream. Just too heavy that way as a dessert, for us anyway. My 14 yr old son made the pralines and found the ratio off as well. Saw no need to use them on the pudding.There are better praline recipes out there.

A keeper! I halved recipe and used milk plus half and half - baked perfectly - lusciously rich and creamy and perfectly seasoned. My husband hates nuts (even praline, can you believe it?) so I used technique from Cook's Illustrated: topped baking dish with dry, bite-sized pieces of bread, brushed with butter, and sprinkled with cinnamon-sugar. Ran under the broiler (low setting) for 5 minutes to a deep brown.

First time making pudding- needed to use some old bread and this worked out perfectly. I left it soaking about 2 hours and added chocolate chips...Amazing! The highlight of the dinner party- and it was so easy to make (granted I already had homemade syrop I used for the praline).

Definitely omit the pralines, at least this recipe with way too much sugar. We prefer pecans but had to throw the pralnes away (even with double the nuts). Instead, made the sugar and spice candied nuts (in epicurious) with just pecans and they were perfect with the bread pudding!

Delicious... like having French Toast for dessert. The praline adds a pleasant contrasting texture to the dish, but I found it to be even better when I topped it with home-made caramel sauce too.

My guests polished it off in the blink of an eye! The praline and ice cream makes this dessert! However, I must say the sugar-to-walnut ratio is totally off. There's way too much sugar in relation to walnuts. I'd double the walnut amount so that there's just enough molten sugar to coat the nuts. I made half the recipe, using a 8x8 pan. More than enough to feed 9 persons.

This is a great recipe. We didn't have cream so I substituted soy milk, and it was still excellent. I also added a bit of pumpkin pie spice and skipped the walnut praline. (We were out of walnuts too.)

I'm usually not a huge bread pudding fan but this was fantastic. I cut down the recipe (2/3 of amounts called for), used half and half instead of whipping cream, and added a handful of walnuts and raisins before baking. I also omitted the praline. It was still wonderful--I couldn't stop eating it. As others have noted, the recipe feeds a lot more than 6-8 (my 2/3 recipe could feed at least 8).

Fantastic. This is one of my staple desserts. Easy to make (except the pralines - I've had mixed results with that) and even finicky kids love it.

Well, I already screwed up the praline topping yesterday so I hope the bread pudding will taste good on it's own tonight for my dinner party! I kept waiting for the sugar to turn a deep amber color which never happened. After about ten minutes of boiling, the sugar hardened and I had to throw it away. I'm sure that would have been a great touch to the bread pudding so don't make the same mistake I did! Boil for seven minutes tops.

This was delicious. It makes way more than 6-8 servings though! It is very rich, so I don't think I would make it very often. I didn't think the praline was really necessary - although it is very tasty mixed in with vanilla ice cream.

This was the best bread pudding I have ever eaten. I doubled the recipe and served it to 20 people and they all had the same opinion. I ran out of time and left off the praline. I served it with the caramel sauce from the pumpkin bread pudding with caramel sauce, from this site, as suggested by another reviewer. This is a keeper!

I borrowed NY's suggestion to cut down on the heavy cream and sugar, and it still turned out beautifully. I added a warm caramel-esque sauce that I blindly whipped up with brown sugar, butter, pecans, and vanilla. Bread pudding is less popular in CA than in other regions, and some of my guests had never tried it (imagine that!), but everyone loved it. A couple of my friends were still raving about it three days later, straight out the fridge. I am going to make this again for a Hanukkah party tomorrow, using challah.

The whole point of a bread pudding is to be decadent so ignore the previous post. I have been using this sight for five years and have never posted anything except to recommend other recipes or to add modifications. This recipe stands on its own. Sure it uses a little to much sugar. I might even cut it down to 7/8 of a cup, but I don't. Measuring 7/8 of a cup involves more work than the entire recipes (and I only exaggerate slightly).

Super easy and delicious. Guests loved it. If serving with ice cream, the praline is not necessary (but a very nice touch). The recipe works fine with the following substitutions: - 1/2 c. turbinado sugar, 1/c c. splenda - 1/2 quart half and half, 1/2 quart 2% milk. Am going to experiment to make slightly less decadent by: - using only whole milk and splenda for the sugar; - increasing the milk a bit and using only 3 eggs and folding in 3 beated egg whites; - adding frozen blueberries and not using the praline.

This was SO easy and so good! I didn't have egg bread so used wholewheat bread instead and it was still yummy. Skipped the praline and served it with just some whipping cream and maple syrup.

This was the MOST delicious desert I've ever made, with a few adjustments. I used 1-1/2 lbs of challah or egg bread, I added dried cherries, and used no praline, but instead used MAPLE PRALINE ICE-CREAM SAUCE. Anywhere it calls for sugar, brown or otherwise, I use maple sugar. This is no minor win. It is amazing. And not much work!

Delicious. Be sure to use a dark amber syrup. I also liked the idea of using butter pecan ice cream.

The absolute best possible recipe for bread pudding ever! It is so rich and creamy and heavenly!!!We've done it with and without the praline and love it with the caramel sauce as from the recipe from "pumpkin bread pudding with caramel sauce" which is excellant also, but not PERFECTION like this is. Print this out and laminate it for your grandchildren!

Made for a well informed and critical group for a New Year's eve dinner, the pudding was a resounding success. My substitutions included using week-old pannetone instead of brioche, throwing in a handful of raisins, and using half & half instead of cream or milk, which other similar recipes specified. Also, butter pecan ice cream instead of vanilla. This was easy to prepare and results were excellent.

The ultimate comfort food. Served warm with vanilla bean ice cream and a drizzle of maple syrup. The only sounds in the room were the oohs and aahs.

This is the perfect bread pudding recipe. It is creamy like a custard with the perfect consistancy and flavor from the brioche. Absolutely perfect. Doesn't even need the praline although it adds nice crunch and pretty presentation. But if you don't have time or interest in making it don't worry. I have served this as a wonderful winter dessert with Vanilla ice cream and home made carmel sauce (try the one in recipe for "Pumpkin Bread Pudding with Caramel Sauce-perfect) and have served it as part of a brunch cut into diamonds and drizzled with caramel sauce. always a hit!!!

For some reason I wound up with too much batter, not enough bread -- added a half a day-old baguette I had lying around. Also, for those cooking at altitude, I added an additional 15 minutes at 425 degrees -- done to pefection.

This is a great dessert. Very easy to make and appreciated even by my finicky kids. I've brought it to two parties and baked it there. The only problem is that it must be a million calories.

Fantastic desert, easy to make, makes about 12 servings or 8 large servings. Not necessary to make the praline, nice touch.

Wow, this was the best bread pudding I have ever made. Follow the recipe as is, and you won't be sorry. Skip the praline if you aren't serving it to guests as it isn't necessary to the great flavor of the bread pudding. Just adds a nice garnish.
