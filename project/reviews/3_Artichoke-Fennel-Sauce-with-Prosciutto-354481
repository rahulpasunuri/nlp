Flavors were fantastic, but it needs more liquid. The fennel, artichoke, and prosciutto taste great together but end up just clumping together on the pastas.

I was amazed at how easy this recipe was to assemble. Great on a warm summer evening and so very tasty. When I make it next I'll top it with some Italian parsley for color.

A simple but very pleasant meal for a weekday.

I followed the technique of the recipe but my proportions were probably a little different since I was only cooking for two. Used 1 medium fennel bulb, a 10 oz jar of artichokes and only about 2T olive oil, everything else was as written. It was delicious... my husband called it a definite keeper!
