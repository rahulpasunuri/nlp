I also made a 1 1/2 recipe. Rather than making it round, I made it rectangular so it was easier to cut. Served it for Easter Diner and it was a hit. I found it difficult to spread the mascarpone on the compote so reversed the sequence.

Excellent-easier than Julia's "Los Gatos Gateau". Not sure what picture on opposite page is- not same construction. Easily modified-alwsys love macaroon layers

This was a dissapointment. We found it dry and lacking in flavor. Not sure how to fix it and I doubt I will bother to try, I will just move on to something else.

This dessert was a showstopper at our supper club. We increased the recipe by 1 1/2, and made 10-inch cookie circles. It easily serves 12 or more - it's pretty rich. Delicious combination of sweet, creamy, tart and crunchy.

It is a wonderful and delicious dessert. It`s hard to believe it`s home made. I didn`t use macarpone, but only plain whipping cream. I don`t know what california apricot is, I used the most comon dried apricot, and ran out pof apricot jam, so i used bitter orange jam instead.

Very scrumptious and very sweet. This recipe is time consuming with great presentation for something like a birthday. Next time I won't praline the almonds finding this made the dish too sweet and it is the only place to really cut back on sugar. Just toasting the almonds would be fine. The mascarpone was a little thick to spread so I added a little more cream. You could probably substitute whipped cream + almonds + Amaretto as a mousse layer if you wanted to cheat a little (by volume and wt, mascarpone is much higher fat and energy than whipped cream and way more expensive, but delicious!)

Unusual and delicious combination of tart (apricots), rich (mascarpone), and sweet (macaroon). The praline almond topping is delicious & fun to make. I have had trouble with nut meringue collapsing or separating when the whites and nuts are combined; a reference librarian told me this happens when the nuts are over-processed & too much oil is released. This was a success at a birthday dinner.

This is a great recipe for a special day. It was a lot of work, but can be assembled at the last minute. It gets soggy quick, so make it on a day when most of it will be eaten.

This is strictly a party dessert, too much work otherwise. Cannot be made too far in advance or it will get soggy, so really not suitable for a party, since I like to be with my guests and not in the kitchen. Tastes great though.

I made this for Passover--it was fabulous. Everyone raved. I will certainly make it again, and not just for Passover. Two notes: 1)It easily served 12-we had leftovers. Use a serrated knife to cut slices. 2) I used extra large eggs -- the ground almond/confectioners sugar mixture is easier to incorporate that way.

This was really delicious...a bit of work, but as said before, if you do a little at a time, it would be managable. I doubled the recipe..only to find this serves more than 6...I fed 10 adults (although we had a rich dinner prior to the dessert.) My macaroons were very soft...but regardless all the flavors were great!

Absolutely delicious, but one problem (if you're going for a more formal presentation) is that it's a little difficult for folks to cut their adorable little slices. You can't easily break through the three crispy meringue layers with a dessert fork, and so each slice quickly deconstructs as folks stab through the layers. I served this at a casual dinner, and we ended up passing around a serrated steak knife to assist with the process! It struck me later that one solution would be to break up the crispy layers into bite-size pieces and then construct the layers in individual parfait dishes.

This was really a fine dessert, and although I'm no pro pastry chef, I found it very simple. To make your life easier, follow the "Cooks' notes" suggestions and make all components in advance except the mascarpone mix, then assemble right before serving. I agree the macaroons could have been just a tad less sweet, but otherwise this is delicious, visually wonderful, and quite easy if you make the components in advance.

What an absolute wow this was tonight! Just the right crispness with the almond/merangue layer...tartness of the apricot compote, sweetnes of the pralines, and smoothness of the marscapone cream. This totally WOWED my out of town guests tonight, Lisa in Toronto, much better than chocolate mousse! The comment by the pastry chef made me laugh! This was actually fairly easy, you just need to go through the steps. So glad I "graduated", and by the way, mine looked prettier than the picture! I made the cake layers day before serving. My only caution, don't spread the almond merangue mixture out to the edge prior to baking, as it will spread. Try to leave 1/8 inch all around. Otherwise hard to get off the baking sheet. Almond praline...do use a really heavy skillet and be cautious about the heat. I slightly burnt mine. Didn't matter, was still awesome. I made the cake layers day before. ALso the almond praline, and the apricot compote (found an apricot preserve at Balduci's that was made with california apricots - awesome!). Had a harried schedule, so decided to whip the marscapone and cream an hour prior to serving and place in fridge. DON'T do this! Was too watery. Recipe says to whip just before serving, trust it! Took about 3 minutes to put together and serve, whipping takes 2 minutes. So just before serving, whip, Penny wise, pound foolish! This was an awesome recipe I'll make again & again, and adapt as well! Enjoy!

Delicious disaster. Set out to make "cookies" with the macaroons for individual cakes. Burnt the bottoms but scraping off the tops of the cookies was so delicious and intensely almond I look forward to trying to succeed with this recipe. Maybe lower the oven temp and time? Oh yeah, those microplane zesters work well for scraping carbon off burnt things... well, they were for wood.

Substituted coconut for almond in the macaroon, and instead of apricot mix used sliced strawberries. It was delicious, but would use less sugar in the macaroon.

recipe is pretty good, superb balance of sweet and sour and creamy. Professional pastry chef by training here and was looking a long time for something that has macaroon layers. If you can make this cake with no problem than you can pretty much do anything else in baking, you graduated.
