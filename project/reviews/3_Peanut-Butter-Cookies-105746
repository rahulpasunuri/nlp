I made these cookies for a trip I was leaving on the next day, but to my disgust when they came out, they were so crumbly they fell apart at my touch. I added one extra egg and added more milk but the effect was the same, as dry as ever. I defiantly do not recommend making this cookie.

Great simple recipe, cookies came out great! Made one changed to the recipe, I found that after mixing all the ingredients in the dough came out a little dry and hard to work with so I added a half cup of milk and it seemed to fix the problem.

These cookies are great! The only thing it needs, possibly left out by accident, 1 1/2 Tsp. of vanilla extract and the dough comes out much more moist. Also, they only need to be baked for about 9 minutes, 12 is too long.

Used this recipe to add some peanut butter cookies to my Christmas trays. Dough didn't stay as wet as I'm used to, so I had to improvise and use the hand-roll technique. Topped them with Hershey's Kisses after baking. My husband and girls LOVED them. Will definitely make again.

The perfect peanut butter cookie. This is the old-fashion, melt in your mouth, slightly crispy, and full of peanuty flavor one. After years of using Epicurious I finally joined so I could add my comments. I've been looking for a peanut butter cookie recipe like this for years. I wish I could find a chocolate chip recipe as good.

Followed recipe to the letter. Dough was so dry as to be unworkable. Couldn't press the cookies to the recommended size without creating a pile of doughy crumbs. Smaller cookies, when baked, disintegrated to the touch. One of the worst cookie recipes of any type I've ever tried.

these are by far the most amazing peanut butter cookies ever, and so easy to make! i added 1/2 cup of chopped peanuts and 2 hershey's milk chocolate bars, chopped. these are amazing! will definatly make again.

I baked mine for 9 min. 12 was way too much. Be careful not to over mix once flour is incorporated. They had a good flavor, your basic PB cookie. I got 3.5 dozen with a tablespoon measure.

I was a little short on peanut butter, and I added about 1/4 cup of milk, but the cookies still came out great. I ended up having 46 cookies (and I probably ate about 2 cookies' worth of dough).

Great cookie! I did roll mine into balls and then flatten with a fork. Came out perfectly and the taste is divine. Nice competition for the other Gourmet peanut butter cookie made with just peanut butter.

These are terrible. Too much PB (and I can't believe I'm saying that) and not enough butter. They were like flaky bricks. I have three words: Fannie Farmer Cookbook. I'll never make any other PB cookies again.

These came out great! Nice "one bowl" recipe. I rolled mine in sugar (before putting on the baking sheet) and put a chocolate kiss on top as soon as they came out of the oven (if you're going to do this, don't mash them with the fork pre-bake). Nice peanut butter-y taste and nice texture. The bottoms of the first batch were a little over done (I don't have the best oven), so I lined my sheets with parchment for the next ones and they were very uniform in color and texture.

I used all-natural chunky peanut butter, and used the whole jar, probably about 2 cups, then held back a little of the flour. They hold together perfectly and the little chunks of peanut are a nice addition. I've been begged not to make them again because they're impossible to stop eating.

I'll be making these cookies for the rest of my life! Followed recipe to the letter and they came out soft, moist and great peanut taste. Maybe for those who had them crumble like pie crust they had a bit too much flour.

Good, old-fashioned peanut butter cookies like mom used to make. The only change I made was adding a tsp. of vanilla. Some reviewers complained that they were too crumbly, but that's how they're supposed to be. It's best to take them out of the oven when they seem a little soft; they'll firm up on the cookie sheet after you take it out. This helps it retain a soft yet slightly sandy texture similar to the ones we grew up with.

I don't know what this "old fashioned" type of PB cookie is that everyone is referring to, but based on my own experience, I thought these cookies were awful. Like another reviewer said, they flaked like pie crust. The taste wasn't awful, but texture is important in cookies, and the texture ruined the overall effect.

loved them! what a rich crumbly cookie, I can't wait to make them again..I did use 'all natural'/fresh ground peanutbutter and it was gorgeous! GREAT cookie.

This recipe was a waste of ingredients and time... These cookies flake like a tart crust. They break the minute you try to transfer them to a platter or cooling rack! My suggestion would be to experiment with this recipe adding some honey,extra egg,etc. Good Luck!

These are the "old fashioned" style peanut butter cookies which are NOT meant to be chewy like the ones people make today. If you want chewy cookies, find another recipe. This is the BEST traditional recipe I have ever tasted. They are meant to be "crumbly" and melt-in-your-mouth. Very peanut buttery and delicious. I also use smooth peanut butter but that's just a personal preference.

Keep looking. There really is something wrong with this recipe.

I went part way with San Francisco's suggestions. 1/4 cup less flour, one extra egg, still used salt, hand mixed in dry ingredients. I ended up baking them about 18 minutes (but i think i made much larger cookies (only about 15 came out). They are delicious. A little crumbly if you don't mold them much, but still soft and scrumptious.

Rating: 3
How I fixed the dryness: 1/4 C. LESS flour. 2 eggs (instead of one) and one yolk. No salt. Used natural PB. Baked 10-11 mins. and I didn't over mix. Added the flour last and mixed it by HAND. Finishing doughs by HAND is KEY in most cookie and tart dough recipes. With this particular recipe I finished with a fork because it was so small. As a former professional I urge you to not use the mixer when adding the dry ingredients. Good luck!

These cookies are great! I get raves about them from everyone who tries them. They are dry, crumbly, and have an excellent peanut butter taste; it's all part of their charm!

Way too dry and bland. Needs another 1/2 to 1 stick of butter, and an extra egg maybe.

Honestly, I was only looking for a guide to making pb cookies- and thus, didn't follow this recipe in detail. my cookies were soft and chewy to perfection (if made double the size and who'd use crunchy peanut butter? adjusted for high altitude and this worked well with unbleached all purpose flour, regular sugar and baking soda, dash of maple syrup tub buttery spread medium egg. (what I had) I don't fault this guide- but yes if you follow directions as is- this recipe suffers

My aunt (of all people) has the best recipe for these cookies and she uses whole wheat pastry flour and a smattering of cream cheese. These cookies are way too crumbly and should more cookie-like, not dirt. I was not impressed.

Rating: 2
If you follow this recipie directly, it will be crumbly and dry. I recommend following other's suggestions to make them a bit more dry. Also, the whole "cruncy" peanut butter thing is too gourmet. Just use plain-old-all-natural in my opinion.

Rating: 3
I heeded the advice of those who said the recipe tended to be on the crumbly side and added 3Tbs of sour cream to the recipe. PB and sour cream? You bet! They came out soft, moist and absolutely delicious -- my roommate (who also bakes) ate 'em all up!

I thought these were a simple, perfect peanut butter cookie. don't know why they say don't use all natural PB. That was all I had and they came out great. Here's a trick, only bake for 10 minutes and let sit on pan for 2-3 minutes. They will not be dry or crumbly.

Rating: 0
I made these cookies because I only had one stick of butter on hand, instead of the two that most Epicurious peanut-butter cookies require. Heeded the warnings from previous reviewers and combated blandness by adding a handful of chocolate chips and two tablespoons of molasses (actually Lyle's Black Treacle, a fine product.) I also increased the peanut butter by a quarter cup. These cookies are still a little drier than I would have liked, but they are definitely very tasty with the modifications. (My mother-in-law makes the best peanut-butter cookies on the planet, and she swears that the trick is using whole-wheat pastry flour. Must try this next.)

they are fairly ordinary and a little dry but the good part is that they're really quick, and not too sweet, just make sure you have plenty of milk!

A typical recipe that doesn't leave much to the imagination, but were great cookies. Would definatly make them again

These are not the typical soft "Archway-like" cookies. They remind me of my childhood pb cookie..and I loved em. If you have been raised on the recipe on the back of the peanut butter jar, you won't like these at all. But if you want a firm textured, peanut intense cookie..these are for you. I think if you don't mix them real well with an electric mixer, you'll get the dry crumbly texture. Also, the tip in rolling them in sugar and then fork tines, was perfect!

This was the first peanut butter cookie recipe I've tried. Most reviewers were right: these are on the dry side, but taste pretty good. A little salty. You really need to let them cool on the cookie sheet since they are really crumbly when they first come out of the oven. And the shape you put them in is how they come out. So basically, pretty good, okay, not great.

This is absolutely the BEST Peanut Butter cookie recipe I have ever made! These are like the "old fashioned" style of PB cookies. They are not the "chewy" kind (PB cookies were never meant to be chewy). They have a melt-in-your mouth texture and a very peanut-buttery flavour. Not too sweet either. Excellent!

This had the best peanut butter flavor of any pb cookie I've made. It wasn't as sweet either--which was good. Easy to make. I used crunchy PB and don't think I'd like it as well with smooth.

Do you like dry, crumbly peanut butter cookies? Then this recipe is for you. Even my beau, who eats everything, was out on this.

These cookies are excellent; however, if you're looking for a chewy cookie--this recipe isn't for you (this is a soft-crumble nut cookie, like shortbread or almond crescents). If you've ever had the outrageous pb cookies at City Bakery in New York City, this recipe comes the closest to theirs (although they use natural pb). I think it's important to use creamy instead of chunky pb. Also, instead of rolling the cookies I scooped the dough with a large melon baller, which saves time and gives them a rustic look.

Superb peanut butter cookie. Try with creamy peanut butter instead of chunky, and the texture is smooth and moist. Out of all the peanut butter cookies I've tried, this beats them all, hands down.

I just want to find a recipe for really good peanut butter cookies much like the ones I buy at Mrs. Fields or the ones they serve at my business meetings. This recipe was a bit disappointing. These cookies fell apart when you looked at them and they tasted just o.k. Well I guess that's how the cookies crumbles :(

Here's what I did with this recipe and it turned out delicious. I rolled them in balls and rolled the balls in sugar. I baked them for 10 minutes, removed them and pressed a chocolate disc (you can use Hershey's kisses but I used to wonderful El Rey dark chocolate discs) into the middle, and returned to the oven for 2 minutes. They are rich and peanut-buttery and wonderful for company.

What is wrong with this recipe? It is THE worst peanut butter cookie recipe ever. The cookies have a weird consistency and crumble at the slightest touch. Do not make these cookies - the recipe on the crisco butter flavored sticks is better than this by far.

This was a bad recipe compared to most of the outstanding recipes we've all come to expect of epicurious.com. I figured I must have done something wrong and made them again - also I tried with creamy peanut butter and vanilla as the "Cook from Regina" suggested - still horrible.

These cookies were simple to make, but they came out so dry and crumbly. The flavor was not even good. Still in search of a great PB cookie recipe.
