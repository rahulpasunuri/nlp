This recipe has been our Christmas meal since it came out in Bon Appetit in 95. The Jus is just perfect although I have doubled the recipe at times to allow enough for the leftovers. I frequently change recipes but I couldn't find anything to change on this perfect Christmas Roast!

I used this recipe for Christmas dinner and it was awesome. I followed the recommendation for roasting at 500 degrees. The meat was tender and just the perfect pink color. The only issue I had was that there was not a lot of juice in the bottom of the pan. Fortunately I had some beef stock and was able to mix the au jus - which by the way was tasty and an excellent pairing with the beef. This has become a family favorite.

The jus does have a very noticeable wine flavor to it. That is what I love about it! Be sure you like the flavor of the wine you are using because you WILL taste it. Also, the flavor mellows and becomes more complex overnight, so go ahead and save yourself some time on the day you are serving it by making the jus in advance. Both ways taste fabulous to us! Instead of beef broth, I use bouillion/flavoring. I loved the recipe as is but now I caramelize the onions and double the garlic. Crazy good stuff. I have used both bone in and not bone in roasts. Both work well but I detest working with the bone while serving it. I think I am "slicing impaired". I do rub the entire thing with a bit of olive oil before adding the garlic and seasonings to it. I sprinkle generously with salt/pepper/garlic powder. I have experimented with the different cooking methods as well. I really have come to prefer the 500 Degrees per pound and then tent roast with foil and turn the oven off for one hour. It is idiot proof so works well for me. Be sure your oven is quite clean or you will have smoke billowing from your oven. I line my pan with foil for easy clean up as well. Make enough for left overs because the next day the prime rib sandwiches are insanely delicious and tender. My husband lets the meat soak in the jus for awhile and then makes it into a sandwich. If he remembers, he actually will marinate it overnight. So good. I have been using this recipe for about 11 years and not one person has disliked it. They have all gone for seconds and raved over it.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I did use a bone-in USDA prime dry-aged rib roast. The roast was delicious, but the jus was just entirely too wine-y for me. However, as other reviewers stated, it did mellow over a few days, so I'd definitely recommend making it in advance.

I've made this rib roast recipe several times (at least 4 times). I rub the roast with garlic and chopped fresh herbs (thyme and rosemary), then I cook it in the oven at 475 for 15 minutes, turn the oven to 325 and continue to cook until the internal temperature reaches 135 for medium (about 2-1/2 hrs for a 4 rib roast). The jus is absolutely delicious with the roast.

This recipe is exceptional and extremely easy. I had a very small 2 1/2 pound boneless prime rib, so I adjusted the time a bit. We sliced it and then finished them off in the pan on top of the stove with some of the incredible cabernet jus. I also did the Yorkshire Pudding that's on this site. WOW! Perfect Christmas dinner for three.

500° for 8 min per pound, then oven off and door kept closed for one hour. Brilliant!!! I will never cook a rib roast any other way. thank you LK

I cooked this as a previous reviewer recommended - 500 per lb and then resting for an hour - and it turned out great. The rub, garlic and thyme, was excellent, but the roast I made was very small (under 4 lbs) so the wine reduction did not turn out that well as there was not enough au jus for the wine. I will make this again w/out the reduction.

Have been making this since 1999. And, without exception, every person that I make it for requests the recipe. Just a simply outstanding recipe in every way. And leftovers? OMG! The most amazing prime rib sandwiches the next day! The jus only gets better. Just be sure you are reducing properly to get a nice strong flavor. It is this recipe alone that haunts me and prevents me from becoming vegan. I, too, hope that there is prime rib in heaven. LOL! Following these directions and using quality ingredients, you will have a final product that competes with, rivals, and in most instances beats whatever you can get at a fine dining establishment. If you detest wine though, this jus has a definite wine flavor.( I love that.) So use a wine that you enjoy or you may find yourself disappointed. Definitely give this one a try. And do not skimp on the garlic either, heh.

I can't comment on the prime rib technique because I always pan sear and then slow roast (200) my prime rib. Perfection. The sauce however was really sublimely good. Rich, savory & complex. I decided it was too much wine for so little stock so I increased the stock by four cups. It took two hours to reduce to two cups, and my dinner guests all loved it. It's going to be a staple. One word of caution - heat the sauce for a bit before adding the port - it clumps up in sticky black blobs if added to quickly to cold ingredients. Eventually it liquifies back out, but it'll ruin your wooden spoon and cause you to scour your saucepan until your wrists hurt.

I made this for Easter today and everyone liked it alot. I didn't use the dried thyme. I put a rub on the prime rib which made it even tastier. I would make it again. I liked the wine sauce but I have tasted better.

After much research, I intend to make this recipe for Christmas using the slow cooking method recommended in both the Joy of Cooking and Cooks Illustrated. However, I only have one oven and I'm a bit stumped as to how to also roast the root vegetables I intend to make... Any suggestions? (mpschilling at yahoo.com)

Wow. This is truly yummy. I searched through all the Prime Rib recipies this morning and finally went with this one...glad I did. The only modification is that my husband added a 1/2 cup of cream to the sauce while it was reducing, which added a nice silky texture. Will most certainly be making this again!

Rating: 3
The sauce was great although I did feel it was missing something and added a little demi-glace at the end. Having not made a prime rib before I stuck to the recipe for roasting the meat. I roasted it until the thermometer read 120 for rare...just as my guests requested. However, the ends were perfect but the center was way too rare for anyone's taste. I let everyone have the good slices and I had to microwave my slice...which was fine. Next time I'll wait until the center registers about 130. Also, I put about 2 cups of beef stock and chopped up an onion and put both in the bottom of the roasting pan and put the prime rib on a rack. Overall, everyone loved it, particularly the sauce.

Rating: 3
The sauce is delicious, but the cooking method leaves a bit to be desired. Blasting the roast with intense heat creates a drier, unevenly cooked roast with more shrinkage and wild temperature swings during the resting period. I prefer the method from America's Test Kitchens. Roasting the roast at 250 degrees, allows the roast to cook more evenly, helps keep the roast juicier, there is less shrinkage, and the temperature of the roast only changes by a few degrees during the resting period... making for a more precise result. If you want the exterior darker, just pop it under the broiler for a couple of mins.

I was asked to plan the Christmas dinner menu and chose this recipe based on the great reviews. It was fabulous as promised. Good advice to make the jus the day before. Can't wait for an occasion to make this again!

This was the best prime rib I've ever had! And it's easy, just start everything and leave it for an hour. The sauce was amazing and the meat was so moist. My only recommendation is cook it with the window open; the kitchen gets quite heady. I followed someone's directions to cook at 500 degrees for 7minutes per pound for rare and then turn off the oven for 1 hour, and it came out perfectly! Exactly 120 degrees; amazing. Definately recommended.

Rating: 3
I made the jus a day ahead, with only one change: I reduced the garlic to one clove. As for the roast, I stuck with a tried-and-true recipe. I combined 1 tablespoon flour, 1 teaspoon dry mustard, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper and rubbed it all over a six-pound rib roast. I baked the roast at 325F for 3 hours (to 140F) and let the roast rest for 20 minutes. The jus was a rich and lovely complement to the medium-rare roast.

Rating: 4
This is perfect! I made the jus the day before. I also roasted a couple heads of garlic then made a paste with one head of garlic, 2 tbls. fresh thyme, salt, pepper and a little olive oil and smeared it all over the roast before cooking. Sauted an onion in the pan drippings and added second roasted garlic before adding the jus and thickening just a bit with cornstarch.

I used this recipe as the basis for my Christmas dinner for two years, primarily because it is so straight-ahead, no frills. I altered the recipe a bit because I am not big on wine, so I cut way down on the alcohol and used only one bottle of Cabernet and no Port. Still, like the San Diego cook, I found the jus was less winey after sitting a couple days. After a year off visiting relatives, I plan on making this again this year.

To answer your question (get the medium rare roast) follow what another reviewer did for their rib roast: "I started it in a 500 degree oven and lowered the heat to 325 after 15 minutes. It took about 2 hours to reach 125 degrees and the meat was a perfect medium-rare after resting for 30 minutes." the resting is oh-so important i stress that you do not shorten it. however i would suggest using the horseradish crusted recipe on this site as it is the best. hope that helps!

I plan on making this recipe this Christmas, and I am really looking forward to it. But I'm confused about what temperature to cook the rib roast to to achieve the classic medium rare. Some say cook it to 120, then it wll reach 130 or 135 after it sits for 20 to 30 minutes. Some say to cook it to less than 120. And some say to cook it to 130, or even 140 or more--all to get it medium rare. Help! I'd hate either to over cook this thing or to serve it raw. Happy Holidays all.

The jus is MUCH better made a day or two in advance. I almost threw it out after I first made it because it did taste too "winey", but after mellowing a day or so, it is delicious with the beef.

A relatively easy treatment of an old standard that yields a sophisticated result that is equally satisfying for dinner for two or for entertaining. We cooked the roast to an internal temp of 140 instead of 118 to yield a medium rare and satisfy a better cross-section of tastes.....cooking it to 118 would probably result in a very rare roast indeed.

We cooked prime rib for our Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit. The cabernet jus was TO DIE FOR (and, yes, it's best when made a day ahead--but it's delicious regardless)! The flavors were intensely savory and everyone loved it. We did follow the suggestions made in some of the reviews (and which we read in other magazines) to start the prime rib for 30 minutes at 450 and then turn the temperature down to 200 degrees and cook for approximately 30 minutes per pound until the temperature on the meat thermometer was 140. We had no unsightly brown ring around the rim of the meat. However, we felt that 140 was too rare. We like rare, but this was TOO rare. If we had it to do over again, we'd cook it another 5 degrees to 145.

Rating: 4
PERFECT!! This recipe creates a moist and juicy prime rib with the most amazing jus ever tasted. Guests raved about both the meat and the jus and every last bit was gone! I did reduce the amount of wine from 2 bottles to 1 1/2 bottles (I admit, I needed the half for cooking fortitude, it was my first attempt at a prime rib!). As for quality of wine, I admit that mine was not that great but it produced a delicious sauce. I basted the roast several times throughout cooking. And, while the recipe calls for a boneless roast, a bone-in is less expensive, easier to find, and equally as delicious. It did take a bit longer to cook than the recipe said, but all in all, it was a wonderful Christmas meal!

Rating: 3
This roast is delicious but taking it out at 118 degrees will produce a raw piece of meat. I took mine out at 135 degrees and it was borderline for being too rare. Next time I'll cook it to 140 degrees before removing from the oven which should produce the medium-rare results I want.

Rating: 4
The cabernet jus was to die for. This was the richest most luscious gravy I have ever tasted. Too "winey"? No way! The beef however, I unfortunately, did not cook as stated. I did start at 450 for 15 minutes but then decreased it to 300 and cooked until 115. (This takes a long time especially if you have a larger piece of meat.) I find the lower temperature makes the internal meat more equally done without a big gradation from outside to inside. Have always cooked my prime rib like this.

prime rib doesn't get any better than this....so I thought, then a friend suggested her family secret: 500 Degree oven, roast 8 min per pound for medium or 7 min per pound for rare, then turn the oven off! and keep it CLOSED for one hour. The result is the best, most moist, prime rib ever. Now a Christmas tradition. Remember DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN ONCE IT IS TURNED OFF!

I made this tonight for a birthday dinner using a 6lb. roast with the ribs intact. I did the peppercorn crust suggested by a couple of the reviews (very yummy but very rich!). I used 1 1/2 bottles of Cab along with the Port & did the reduction the night before. It took probably 1.5 hours to reduce. Bottom line - the Jus was amazing. I'm a horseradish w/prime rib person but absolutely loved it. We're still picking at the leftovers. I agree with an earlier post that the Cab reduction would be excellent with sauteed onions & mushrooms. We'll definitely be making this again.

I only made 1/2 of the sauce because I was serving 4 people, a 4 lb. rib roast with the bones. Worked exceptionally well. I sauted onions & baby bella mushrooms in butter & added them to the final sauce after finishing it with the pan drippings. It was wonderful & I would definitely do this again. I'm not a beef eater, but my husband & the company were & they all loved it.

I agree with the many other readers - DEFINITELY make the sauce ahead (a day or 2 before is perfect). I added the juices from the pan, then thickened it for more of a gravy - the PERFECT accompaniment for Yorkshire puddings!! I also followed everyone else's advice on the slow roast, but, frankly, couldn't taste that big of a difference.

WOW! This was fabulous! I have never attempted prime rib before...I always was a little intimidated. This was amazingly easy and my guests were impressed. I chose this particular recipe because my dinner party was for the sole purpose of drinking some very wicked wines. I needed a recipe that would stand up to some huge California Cabs, so I read ALL of the reviews before I started. I thought the jus was outstanding and really worked well with the Hillside Select Cab. I also served the traditional horseradish sauce on the side but everyone preferred the jus. I did follow several reviewers advice and made the jus the day before. I also followed the suggestion of cooking the meat for 30 mins at 450 degrees and then slow roasting at 200 degrees until done. It came out perfect! I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
Excellent!! my only recommendation is to not serve the Jus atop of the meat, make sure it is along side, it is very flavorful and is better when one dips the meat in, that way there is control over the flavor.... I WILL be making this again and again, the kids enjoyed it as well.

P.S. I highly recommend making the sauce the day ahead. The flavors will be more robust and distinctive.

This recipe rocks! I've made it the last 5 Christmases, and will make it next year too! This year, it was perfect... rather than cooking it at 350, I did a slow roast.... Cook at 450 for 30 mins. to brown the outside... then drop the temperature to 200 degrees and slow roast - about 30 mins/pound - until the meat reaches about 135-140 for medium-rare. Try this method... you'll be glad you did! The meat is much more thender, and it's more evenly done throughout. YUMMMMMM!!!!

The roast part was fine, but I could live without the jus. It was just too much wine and not enough beef flavor. I cooked a 6 lb beef tenderloin that was excellent, but the jus did not do it for my guests. I used a good cabernet and port, tho not super pricey. I will not keep this in my recipe file. I have much better ones than this.

This was my first time cooking prime rib and I was a little intimidated by the price-tag, but I was amazed at how easy it was to make and how good it came out. The meat (which I cooked for 20 minutes at 450 and then at 300 until it reached 120 F) was soooo tender and flavorful it didn't need the au jus at all, but the au jus was spectacular (once the pan drips were added). I also made half of it and had plenty left over. I used a $5 cab, so you don't need to spend too much $$ on it.

Out of this world! The roast itself was delicious, and the a jus put it over the top. Everyone raved. I feel it really made a difference to use quality wine and port; at the minimum it should be something you would drink. Only time and not labor intensive. For me, it was well worth the effort!

This is The Dish that won everyone over. I'm back because it's requested every year now, even from those who thought they didn't like prime rib. We are hobby winemakers and end up with our fair share of wine we'd rather cook with, and find that this is a great use for icky wine. DON'T SPEND MONEY ON THE WINE!!! It turns out wonderfully every time.

I also made this dish for Chirstmas dinner and it was out of this world! I did, however, find the aux jus to be a little winey and expensive as well, and I, too, used quality ports and cabernets. I will use a larger beef stock to wine ratio next time I make it.

Made the sauce for Christmas dinner, and it blew us away! Used so-so cabernet/port and homemade beef stock. Only reduced to 3 cups, instead of 2. It was thick (but not too thick), rich and tangy. Substituted the Pink and Green Peppercorn Prime Rib recipe for roast. Will definitely make this again.

Made for Christmas Day. Guests really liked it but I found the sauce to "wine-y" even though I used decent wine and made my own beef stock. If I were to do it again I'd sautee some mirepoix, add 1/2 the amount of wine to that and reduce then add veal stock and reduce some more then add to pan...

This recipe is fabulous. I have made this 3 times since Thanksgiving and it is perfect every time. I always make the sauce at least 2 days in advance. The wine and port you use will definitely make a difference. Ask your local wine shop expert for advice. Our local guy recommends a different wine each time and the sauce keeps getting better. And one tip for those of you who aren't sure on what size roast to use based on the number of guests: 3/4 pound per person is a good guide. Additionally, to get every bite of this wonderful, but expensive cut of meat, ask your butcher to cut off the bone but TIE IT BACK ON so you get the benefit of the juices. This allows you more control on serving size when slicing and my husband adores the bones (which are loaded with meat) the next day.

Rating: 3
an easy recipe. I used Penfolds Cab and a good port for the reduction. I did it 2 days ahead. The next day I noticed a lot of sediment in the sauce (even after straining) so I strained a 2nd time and added the rest of the bottle of port and reduced again. Glad I did, was happy to have the xtra sauce. A hit with the family.

This recipe is fabulous! I made some changes since my kids wanted a typical cream gravy.Made the Cabernet Jus the day before, halved the Jus recipe.Rubbed the roast with olive oil, minced garlic, S & P, thyme.Placed shredded carrots & minced shallots under the rack in roasting pan. This adds extra flavor to any gravy. Thanks to others, roasted at 500 for 30 min. then 200 for 2 1/2 hrs. Made gravy with drippings, flour, 1/2 & 1/2, & some cabernet jus. Everyone raved about the Roast and Gravy. Will make again, just awesome!

I was adventurous and violated the rules about trying new dishes at major family events but it turned out to be a good thing! My husband's cousin is a gourmet chef and he raved about this (he NEVER raves about anything because he's so particular). Everyone from the chef to my dad, who won't try anything new, loved it. This was perfect for Christmas dinner because I made the sauce two days ahead of time (don't freak out if the sauce doesn't look right, it turns out fabulous), and then we popped the meat in and forgot about it. No fuss, but glamourous! You definitely can cut this recipe in half... we did a 6lb prime rib (which fed 13 people)and I easily had half the jus left over. But definitely a winner!

Just finished eating this and had to report. This was the best Christmas meal we've ever eaten. I added some rosemary sprigs while making the jus but otherwise stuck to the recipe.

I would do this again, with some modifications for the jus: no need to use port, add horseradish, if you like it, to the jus for some extra kick. I was also thinking of a was to turn it into a cream sauce by using whipping cream. It has a really good flavor and the kitchen smells awesome! I was lucky enough to have fresh thyme in my garden and it looked beautiful with sliced beef on the platter. I also studded the beef with sliced garlic and took the advice of another reviewer by roasting at 500, then reducing temp to 200 till done. (thanks!)

The cabernet au jus, while so easy to prepare, was a big hit with my family and guests. I cut the amounts of wine and port in half and still had plenty for six people.

I would definitely make a standing rib roast again (see the recipe for beef on weck) with a rub on the meat but the au jus, which is really all that is special about this recipe, is essentially an expensive unecessary. We hate dry food, but if you make the roast rare, who needs the au jus? Then standing rib roast is an easy crowd pleaser. In short, make the roast rare, skip the au jus.

I admit that I'm a vegetarian and never tasted this myself, but I served this to seven other meat-eating guests at a recent dinner party and got rave reviews.

Everybody loved it - would definitely make again.

Great Recipe! This was my first roast -it was surprisingly easy with great results! After the reduction (~1.5 hours) I was worried the jus was to wine-y but it actually complements the beef perfectly (and i did stir in juices from the roast). For the rub I used garlic, freshly ground pepper, thyme, and sea salt. Definitely try this recipe if you're considering making a roast.

So easy and so elegant. Use a heavy cabernet. I agree that reduction time takes longer than one hour, almost two.

Here's a hint. Ask your butcher for a full, restaurant grade boneless ribeye roast, tied at two inch intervals. Cut off as much as you need and freeze the rest. Cook it on your rotisserie to 118 degrees for rare and tent for 20 minutes. Carve away and gloat!! To die for!!

Rating: 4
Outstanding! Easiest recipe in the world, rave reviews and no leftovers. Cabernet Jus added a delicious, not overpowering, richness to the whole dish. The jus did take longer to reduce (~2-3 hours) so I would start it the day before to clear up stove space, and because it does add a strong aroma to the air while reducing. The jus goes a long way so my aunt (a chef) recommended freezing the remainder as icecubes to add to sauces and stews.

Very, very good!! The cabernet sauce was great, however next time I would not stir into the roast drippings. It tasted much better right after the sauce was boiled down to 2 cups. The roast turned out great. I took the advice from my chef friend. Just preheat oven to 500 degrees and put roast in (uncovered) for 30 minutes, and then turn down oven to 200 degrees and take out when you get your desired tempeture. Take out, tent with foil, and let stand for 20 minutes, slice and serve. Will definitely make again! My guest loved it.

Great receipe. Not to difficult or complicated, but yet, great taste. I have made it for a holiday meal, and we had fish with it, but the fish were hardly touched :) Definitely going to try it again!

I made this for Christmas dinner to rave reviews. The Cabernet Jus was really yummy. I usually preferr my Prime Rib with horseradish but I liked the jus so much I used it. I sliced the prime rib and poured some of the jus over it prior to serving. Fabulous! I will definately make this again. It is really delicious!

This was my first prime rib- tho I am an experienced cook- just never tried prime rib. I made the jus with zinfindel vs the cab. It was wonderful!Served this with the goat cheese and herb scalloped potatoes, green beans with roasted carmelized onions for a wonderful combination of flavors. Started the dinner with a butternut squash and apple soup. Finished the meal with Bananas Foster Cheesecake and Carmel Pecan tart. What a New Years!!!

A huge hit for my New Year's Eve dinner party. Instead of rubbing the roast with garlic/thyme, I made a paste of dijon mustard, five cloves crushed garlic and the thyme, coated the roast, wrapped in plastic wrap and chilled for five hours. Just before roasting I coated it with coarse salt and pepper. Everyone loved it--the roast was extremely tender and the au jus was great too. And, I bought my roast at Price Club, so you don't have to break the bank to make an impressive meal.

This recipe is fantastic! I also had a great piece of meat. I combined this with the pink and green peppercorn as well as the garlic and thyme recipe. It was like heaven eating this! I would highly recommend it! I didn't have any port but did use the two bottles of cabernet, it was still great. Don't know how the port would have affected the taste. I loved this dish!

This was my first try at making prime rib and I made it for Christmas dinner. My husband loved it so much that he declared this our "official" Christmas dinner from now on. We gave some leftovers to our neighbor and he told me I could cook for him anytime! It was delicious and very easy to make. The only thing I added was I cooked the prime rib on a layer of sliced onion.

This was my first attempt at prime rib. Not only was it easy, it was an absolute hit with the guests. I let the a jus reduce a little bit to long (down to 1 1/2 cups) but it still tasted great. The meat was very tasty even with out the sauce. I also cooked meat till it reached 140 degrees (we're not rare meat eaters), the center was medium pink and the end cuts were well done. This is a great recipe! This one just might become a holiday favorite.

Rating: 2
I thought the sauce was a little astringent, and was told by a chef-friend that an oak-aged cabernet might be the culprit. A zinfandel or blend, non-oak aged, would result in a less astringent sauce. He also told me to reduce the wine slowly, at a simmer, for a more rounded taste. I'd be interested in any other reviewer's thoughts, or if they agree with this opinion.

This was my first Prime Rib and it was wonderful! The Jus smelled a little suspect throughout the preparation process, but in the end it tasted great. I can't understand why people said it was too "winey" -- it was the perfect complement to the meat. A must try! I can't wait to make it again! Happy Thanksgiving!

This is a FABULOUS and relatively simple recipe. I knocked it out in an afternoon looking to do something with a prematurely defrosted Rib-Eye Roast. The Cabernet sauce worked like a charm (I've used a variation of this reduction for Filet's Mignon)and except for using a little more garlic in the rub, I followed the recipe exactly which is unusual for me. Give it a try, you won't regret it.

Without a doubt, the best prime rib recipe I have ever used.

Rating: 4
I made the crust from the Roast Prime Ribs of Beef with Pink and Green Peppercorn Crust, using a Prime Rib with Ribs. I followed the instructions in that recipe for the roasting process. I made the Au Jus from this recipe the day before. It took a little less than an hour to reduce, contrary to what was stated by many of the other writers, but it may be because I used a dutch oven with a larger surface area than a saucepan and also because I have a gas Viking Range, which may be hotter than many users' stoves. The combination of the 2 recipes was absolutely wonderful - a great way to close the Year 2000!

I have made this several times and everyone loves it! It is a wonderful recipe, and is reserved for special occasions. The wine does take longer than one hour to reduce.

The key yo this recipe is the cabernet jus, so it's fortunate that it is a good one. The wine flavor is strong, so use sparingly at first, and then add more, if desired. I made this for 7 guests, and everyone raved. Great meal.

Best Christmas Dinner I have ever made!!!! The JUS was perfect. I used two bottle of Cab, one Gallo of Sonoma 1997 and Indigo Hills 1997. Both can be had for less then $10. The port I used was BV's 1997 port. I used greenpeppers and butter with some thyme and garlic to rub on the meat.

This was the best prime rib I've ever had. It's also very easy. I started the jus the day prior. Cooked it for about 2 hours. Then stored in a non-metallic bowl. Christmas day I continued to simmer the jus until it was reduced to 2 cups (about another 1 1/2 hours). I did not add pan drippings into the jus. I cooked the prime rib at 450 degrees for one hour. You must have a clean oven or your house will smoke up, as one reviewer had difficulty with. I reduced the heat to 350 for an additional hour for a meat temp of 125 (medium). I literally drenched the prime rib in garlic powder and the amount of thyme in the recipe. I will definitely make this again. My guests loved it.

I loved the thyme/garlic rub on the actual roast. I wasn't crazy about the au jus - It was a little too "winey". I will definitely prepare it again but with a different au jus.

I used a different cooking method: I "seared" the roast at 450F for 15 minutes and then reduced the oven temp to 350F. The prime rib turned out perfectly; roasted it until the thermometer read slightly over 120F, removed it and it was a perfect medium rare after the resting period. I find that minced garlic tends to burn and turn acrid after prolonged cooking so I used a traditional English mustard marinade for the rib roast which turned out wonderfully: 4 teaspoons dry mustard powder, 4 teaspoons sugar, and 4 teaspoons Dijon mustard. Season roast liberally with salt and pepper and rub mustard paste all over and let sit for at least 2 hours. The cabernet jus was just OK. My guests liked it but I found it a bit too tart and wine-y and this even after boiling it forever and reducing it to 2 cups! I guess I just prefer a more traditional pan gravy. The dinner was still a hit and my brother-in-law who is a prime rib connoisseur pronouced it perfect.

Rating: 4
The jus was incredible. Instead of just thyme and garlic, I coated the roast with a mixture of fresh ground pepper, kosher salt, minced garlic and chopped rosemary to form a crust. I roasted a 5.25 lb. boneless roast at 350 degrees for just over 2.5 hours and it came out perfect!! (we all like it done medium.) HIGHLY recommend this dish - never knew a prime rib could be this easy and it produces elegant results!

I was one of the recipients of this wonderful meal made on Christmas Day by my wife. One comment I made to her was that "This was the best meal you ever made." She cooked the meat to perfection, continually checking its internal temperature until it was done to our liking. All 7 guests raved about the Prime Rib and tonight she made the most delicious Asparagus Soup with the leftover asparagus from yesterday. She also got that recipe off Epicurious.com. We love this web site and will continue to SPICE up our lives with the great recipes given by its users. When making the cabernet jus, my wife used only 1 bottle of wine instead of the 2 suggested and she also omitted the Port wine. It still came out delicious. The house smelled great all day long.

I made the Jus from this recipe and didn't deglaze the roasting pan. I just added the juicy drippings with the fat skimmed. It took about 2 hours to reduce, but the Jus was FABULOUS! I used a sprig of fresh thyme instead of the dried. I will make this again and again. I made a 7 rib roast rubbed with salt, pepper and fresh thyme. Cooked for 15 minutes at 475 and then at 325 until it was 120 inside (about 2-1/2 -3 more hours). It was perfect. I made yorkshire pudding while the roast was resting.

I just made this for Christmas dinner. Incredible. I reduced the cabernet jus in a large 8 qt. pot with the lid off- it took less than an hour to get to 2 cups, just let that puppy boil. We also had mashed blue potatoes with homemade creme fraiche infused with dill, which melded beautifully with the meat & jus. -simple green beans on the side & yorkshire pudding.. YUM. Also perfect with this was a '97 Cristom Pinot Noir from Oregon. I can highly recommend this to anyone for a memorable feast. Merry Christmas to all!! Lover Guest: I was present at the reviewers dinner. I can only add that I am totally satiated. If there were a rating above 4 forks, I would give it. Excellent Friend Guest: My chin was resplendent with drool for the duration...uh, uh, uh...Thus Fork Q x 15 1/2.

Help! At this point it took me 3 hours to make the au jus and I have never roasted a prime rib before. What temp should I cook my 6 pound roast? I was going to start at 450 then reduce to 350. Any ideas on timing. I'm desparate as we want to eat dinner some time tonight!

this is the most wonderful and delicious recipe! i used good red wine and the port and it came out fabulous. everyone wanted to eat the sauce like soup. i rubbed the prime rib with lots of crushed garlic all over and cooked at 500 degrees. no smoking if your oven is clean! i have now done this recipe at least 3 times a year! and doing the a jus the day before saves a lot of worry! just watch out for people sampling!

We ended up merging this Jus recipe with the crust recipe from the "Prime Rib with pink and green peppercorn crust" recipe, and it was fabulous. The Jus took twice as long as the recipe says, but we were prepared for that thanks to everybody elses comments. It makes plenty, so we have enough to serve when we make prime rib again for Christmas Dinner. Yes - it was that good that we have to make it again. I was dubious about using 2 bottles of Cabernet. I thought we should cut it back to 1 bottle based on some of the earlier comments, but my husband was dead set on getting rid of some of our bad cabernet. Just to give you an idea of the quality of cabernet we used, one was "Old Dog". I don't know how the sauce could have been any better, so I wouldn't recommend using expensive wine. It is perfectly yummy with cheap wine. Also, for the crust, we did the peppercorn crust, but cut the peppercorns down to 3 tablespoons. It was fantastic. We wanted something spectacular for our fancy holiday dinner party, and this lived up to all our expectations. All 10 guests raved at how good the meat was.

I used this recipe for a Thanksgiving dinner and received excellent praise. I did not use the port in the jus recipe, and it was delicious. DO NOT try to roast your prime rib at the high temp listed; your house will smoke up so badly that you won't be able to enjoy your meal. I roasted it at 350 until the meat thermometer showed 120 and it was a perfect medium rare. I regretted adding the pan juices to the jus; the jus is wonderful without it and doesn't need the added fat. The fat from the pan drippings congeals as the jus cools down.

JUST MADE THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR MY WIFE'S 50 SOMETHING BDAY. WE BOTH CHERISHED THE DAY & THE MEAL. I DID REDUCE THE CABERNET TO 1/2 BOTTLE & STRAINED THE JUS BEFORE SERVING.

this recipe was fabulous. i had people coming for dinner and had never cooked a roast before, so i was a little nervous, but it was so incredibly good. the cabernet jus really made the dish, as did getting a good cut of beef (although i payed dearly for it: $100). i played with cooking times a little because the butcher told me that an hour at 450 degrees was much too long. i ended up cooking the meat at 450 for 20 minutes then lowered the oven to 325 for another hour and a half or so (i don't remember the exact cooking time, but i removed the meat when the meat thermometer read 130 degrees). it was perfect. i'd make again, but only for a very special occasion because of the expense. oh, one other thing: i cut back to one bottle of cabernet and used a very cheap bottle and it still tasted incredible.

I had a beautiful Chirstmas Day Dinner - the guests raved about this prime rib. I made the sauce 3 days in advance. I also did the prime rib on our gas grill, so easy and not the huge oven mess. The recipie changes for gas grilling: I used my old oven broiler pan (with drip slats) Place meat on oven broiler pan in middle of gas grill, keep heat at 350 degrees. A 6.5 lb. prime rib roast took almost 2 hours. It was fantastic! The leftovers with sauce were exquisite even 2 days later. This was my first ever prime rib and I will definitely make it again and again! The guy below with the bad review probably smelled and tasted the jus and chucked it before adding it to the brown bits and serving over the prime rib. It is quite pungent and smells bizarre during the first stage of prep. Do not consume at this point! I said a quick prayer, put it in the refrig. for 3 days and it was fabulous! Have faith!
