This recipe was super easy to make and it turned out delicious! I didn't have scallops so I doubled the shrimp. You can adjust how spicy the dish is with the amount of chile paste you use. I used Huy Fong, Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce and since I don't like my food with a ton of spice I stuck to the recommended dose. It added a lot of flavor, but wasn't too spicy. Even with doubling the recipe it only made enough food to feed three hungry adults. We were all very disappointed that there weren't any leftovers for lunch the next day!

This has become my #1 stir-fry recipe. I spike up the dish by adding broiled onions and a few dried red peppers to the vegetables and mashed garlic to the sauce.

Absolutely excellent. We omitted the sugar and chile paste (because we didn't have any), added more black pepper and tossed everything together in the sauce in the pan before serving with couscous.

Delicious sauce, nice flavor and fresh tasting. I doubled the sauce and added quite a few other stir fry vegetables to the eggplant to make it a full meal and it was a great dish. The chili heat seemed perfect for us, not too hot.

I love this recipe because it's step by step and men don't like to multitask. I used Chinese eggplant and substituted fish sauce for the soy. Also, I doubled all the sauce ingredients except for the chili paste. The result was a moderately spicy dish with healthy green toppings. Try it over basmati rice. Healthy and filling! Next time I'll skip the extra salt.

Delicious! This tastes like something you'd eat at a restaurant...but better. Very easy to make and healthy too.

This was delicious. I doubled the sauce as some reviewers suggested but my chili sauce must have been hotter one. Next time, I will double all the sauce ingredients except for the chili sauce. I switched soy sauce with fish sauce and added yellow squash and bell pepper.

I agree with the reviewer from Virginia. The eggplant went nicely with the scallops and shrimp, but the sauce wasn't very interesting.

The combination of scallops, shrimp, and eggplant was wonderful. The sauce was pretty boring. Too many really good Thai recipes similar to this to make this again.

3.5 forks. easy and very tasty. flavors blend very well together, nothing is overpoweing. the eggplant with the scallops work really well .

yummy! many things to recommend this recipe: depth of flavor; proportion of sweet to salty to spicy is just right; and, finally, very simple to make. can't beat that combo! i also tripled sauce as other reviewers suggested (thank you--a very good suggestion!) served over rice.

very easy and delicious. very nice sauce. i also made extra sauce and added udon noodles, snap peas, and mushrooms. My husband, who normally doesn't like eggplant, thought it was delicious.

Very tasty and not time consuming to make! I didn't have cilantro and had a regular large eggplant that needed to be used, thus I landed on this recipe. I'll try it as originally written next time - probably even better!

Yummmm. Really very very good. My husband got all romantic when I made this last night. Didn't have any cilantro, so just left it out, and doubt it made much of a difference; the basil was wonderful. Didn't have chili paste, but did have some asian chili sauce, so used that (and a bit more than called for). For part of the oil I used a spicy stir fry oil. Every bite was wonderful.

This was superb and easy to prepare. I roasted the eggplant (less oil) and doubled the sauce, otherwise made it as written. Served with Jasmine rice and stir fry sugar snaps.

I make this all the time! The first time was by the book, then I used the same ingredients and just changed the sequence. I saute the veggies,along with garlic or shallots, remove them, saute the shellfish (or chicken),add the sauce, add the veggies back and top with cilantro/basil while the sauce simmers. I always triple the sauce. Give it a try-it's great!

Yummy! This recipe is easy and very tasty. My husband told me that before dinner he wasn't really going in for the eggplant or the scallops and he ended up loving this dish. As did I.

Very easy, festive, tasty. I have done it with and without eggplants. Everybody loves it.

I'm fortunate to live close to SF's Chinatown and frequently have meals there. Unfortunately, this recipe was lacking depth in terms of taste.

Wow. Made it several times - always to rave reviews.

I found this recipe when I had an eggplant and cilantro languishing in the crisper and did a search for them. Followed the recipe except made triple the sauce as suggested and served it over udon noodles. Delicious recipe.

This was so good. I could not believe I made it myself. Seriously, I never eat too much when I cook, but this time, I was in heaven!

The thing that's great about this dish is the sauce. It seems just like any other Oriental sauce but it's somehow better. Maybe it's the lime juice and the whole basil/cilantro at the end. I used it on a stir fry with eggplant, red pepper, mushrooms, seafood...you get the idea. And yes, make more sauce than the recipe calls for

I agree with tripling the sauce. Next time I'll try adding some other vegetables.

This was great. I tripled the sauce and served it with rice. Easy to make and my husband loved it.

Fabulous recipe. No one has mentioned the 'kick' it has from the Asian Chile Paste. We love spicy. This was simple and quick to make - another bonus. I doubled the sauce as others suggested and added the chopped scallions to the sauce while it was reducing. I served it with Tomatoes Stuffed with Orzo-Feta Salad from Cooking Light. I altered the stuffed tomato recipe including substituting the orzo for rice. Excellent meal.

Yummy. My kids even ate this one. They preferred the shrimp, my husband and I preferred the scallops. I doubled the sauce as others did. Next time I'm going to try it with additional vegetables.

A tasty recipe with an unusual combination of ingredients (eggplant & seafood). I used a pound of scallops and omitted the shrimp, and I sauteed the scallions rather than using them raw--I like them a bit mellowed. The scallops should be super-fresh and cooked rare.

I, too, made some substitutions, but this was truly an award-winning recipe. I would like to suggest my way to treat eggplant, when using similar recipes. I coat well a rimmed cookie sheet (or similar pan) with olive oil and place the rounds of eggplant in it. I then brush a nice film of olive oil on top and broil them until nicely browned. I turn them without adding more oil and brown them nicely. They are then ready to use in anything and haven't absorbed a lot of oil. This has worked for me for years and has saved me a lot of time, effort, and oil!

Very tasty and easy to prepare. Thanks to other reviews I made extra sauce for the rice. My family raved and requested this gets put in my "Recipe File".

Amazing dish. I tripled the sauce recipe and it was just perfect if you want to put over rice. My husband was ranting and raving about it, had it for breakfast the next day too!

great! we did it with just shrimp... Will try doubling the sauce next time as I like to have some with rice... would also slice the scallions as opposed to leaving them in 1" lengths

A superb recipe. I have made this twice. Once to try out on ourselves and the second time for guests. Sincerely, Maureen Williams, United Kingdom.

This is a truly awesome recipe. I've worked much harder to make Asian-style sauces that didn't end up tasting nearly as good. It was particularly flavorful the next day! I made it with the eggplant a couple of weeks ago, and then made the recipe again using 1 zucchini and 1 yellow squash instead, thinly sliced. It was just as good, and I would encourage anyone cooking for eggplant-dislikers to try it!

Very good and fairly simple. The store was out of Asian chile paste so I substituted half a Serrano chile; next time I'll probably add the whole thing. I also threw in a teaspoon each of chopped garlic and ginger.
