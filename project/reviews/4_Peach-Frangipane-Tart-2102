This is wonderful, BUT (as others have mentioned) it does not keep...so be sure to eat it the day you make it!

I have to begin by admitting that my favorite part of the meal is dessert and if it involves chocolate, all the better. However, this pie now ranks in my top five favorite desserts. If you thought the apple ginger bourbon pie and blueberry sour cream recipes were good, you've got to try this one. This is so superb it makes the others taste like bakery made pies.

Great and simple recipe, though I made a crust. We used ripe peaches from our own tree, they were ripe but the blanching helped bring up the juices. It was great the next day too.

Very good. Store bought crust takes away from this wonderful tart. Next time I'll make a crust. Does not keep it's flavor so eat it up.

I used the miniature Athenos filo pastry shells for the crust. They turned out beautiful and tasty.

Quick and easy... the peaches had a very nice texture, and everyone thought the pie was great!

Absolutely delicious! Very easy to make and quite impressive looking. This will be a standard for me from now on when I need a fruit dessert for guests. Not to much of any one flavor or texture - everything was perfect. I used a homemade pie crust and didn't think it got to soggy even after a couple of days.

I've made this several times, and it never fails to impress company!

I've been making this tart for years; it's wonderful made with peaches or any stone fruit (nectarines, plums), or with any fruit that marries well with almonds. I have made it with halved fresh strawberries and strawberry preserves. It always gets rave reviews. Last summer, I coated the cooled frangipane base with a thin layer of bittersweet chocolate ganache and topped it with beautiful organic raspberries, and didn't glaze them. I made two and took them to a picnic of discerning foodies, and they got more raves.

I was given some lovely peaches and couldn't wait to use them in this recipe. Sad to say they were rotten inside so I ended up using canned. (cut in thin slices) Even so, this was totally delicious! I'm thinking about trying this with dark chocolate mixed in, maybe with a raspberry glaze.

I had never made a peach tart or pie before, and I was very proud of the results here! It was rather easy and sure went down smoothly. One thing I learned is that is does not age well. I tried to eat the leftovers the next day, and they really left something to be desired, so plan to eat it all up at once!

I used a pre-packaged shortbread crust, which turned out well, and added almond extract to the filling for extra almondy goodness. Had to make extra glaze and only used 4 of 5 peaches. This pie was devoured at the party I took it to, and people asked for the recipe. Highly recommended.

The combination of peach and almond in this recipe is delectable! We do not like overly sweet desserts and this was perfect as written. A few observations: to avoid the pastry puffing up when being baked, weight the center; if your peaches are really ripe you do not need to blanch them (this is just to help you peel under ripe fruit); you may not need all 5 peaches (I used 4). A great recipe to use up peaches from our local orchard.

This was extremely tasty. I made my own crust, a flaky butter crust, and my husband and I ate half of this already.

This is such a delicious recipe. It's also easy to make. I substituted an Orange Marmalade mixed with the Apricot Jam for a change the second time I made it. It should be eaten the day it is made. It tastes good the following day, but as expected, the crust gets too soft.

I ususally don't go against the flow, but this recipe just didn't make it for us. We had excellent peaches, so I must assume that we didn't appreciate the filling. Maybe a shortbread crust would help, because the ready made one we used wasn't too much more than cardboard.

This is a superior tart and the short cuts make it a real time saver. It has been loved by all that I have served it to.

I have been happily making this tart with canned peach halves which I slice before adding to the almond top. Get rave reviews from all and can't wait for the peach season to try it with fresh peaches.

One of the best tarts I've made. I do make a shortbread style crust instead of using the packaged crust. I have also used the filling with other fruits and been very pleased.

I have made this tart for several years, and I have always received raves and have been told that it looks professional. It is a very simple recipe, and can be endlessly adapted with all kinds of fruit. I have made it using strawberries and glazing with raspberry jam, and I also made a Christmas version with poached pears and cranberries (I arranged the fruit on the filling before baking and baked at a slightly lower temperature for about 20 min.), glazed with apricot preserves and trimmed with toasted sliced almonds. Every variation I've tried has gotten compliments and requests for the recipe.

This is a very simple and extremely IMPRESSIVE dish. My only problem was the peaches I had were the size of softballs and it was difficult to fan them on top of the tart. Next time I will use smaller peaches.

An abundance of peaches from our peach tree sent me to Epicurious to search out peach recipes. This one is a winner - so easy to make but so very delicious. I've made this numerous times, but we never tire of it. Homemade peach preserves made this dessert even more special.

This was a wonderful, surprisingly light dessert. I sprinkled some blueberries over the peaches before putting the glaze on, and it added a wonderful flavor to it. I'm passing this one on to friends!

This is a superb recipe -- simple, very delicious and gorgeous. It looks like it came from a fancy pastry shop. Almond flavor is subtle and tastes great with the peaches, pastry is crisp, and the fresh fruit makes it not overly sweet. Drain peaches really well and try not to have tart stand too long before serving. I found that the peaches tend to break down the glaze and liquify it a bit and make it less shiny the longer it sits. Next time, I'll put the fruit on no more than an hour or so before serving.

this was absolutely delicious and it is very easy to make. i served it with a little whipped cream on the side -- complements it nicely.

I loved this. I made it with a pate brisee sucree pie shell instead of prepared, but the filling is so good it probably doesn't matter. This is now one of my summer "make-to-impress" desserts
