Really tasty! You do have to like bitter, but the butter softens it a bit. I had never cooked with rapini before and this was a great introduction, as the tastes are simple and straightfoward.

Unruly size? Anyway, works well, a bit of lemon zest on top helps things along if you're in the mood. People who don't like a little bit of the bitter taste won't like rapini. Maybe stick to donuts. To me, a keeper.

This didn't turn out - I used unsalted butter - which was probably the culprit - but the parsley butter was very blah and the rapini was bitter. It was beautiful and I tossed in some almonds for richness, but overall it wasn't great. I served it at a dinner party and I could see people struggling with the rapini -it's an unruly size.
