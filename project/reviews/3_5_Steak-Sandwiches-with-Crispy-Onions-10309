This is an okay recipe, but what you really need is a great piece of steak, crusty bread, and dijon mustard mixed with a little mayonnaise. I just caramelize the onions, set aside, the saute the mushrooms with a little white wine and wosterchire sauce. Season to taste, and you will have a much easier and tasty steak sandwich. If you have a quality piece of meat, you don't need to overpower it with a complicated sauce. Less is more!

My husband liked the flavor of the sauce but said it reminded him of Sloppy Joes. If that is the case then I'll save myself the trouble of measuring out the ingredients and just buy the box.

This is one of my absolute favorite recipes! I adjusted the ratio of cream, ketchup and Worstershire sauce for my tastes (a bit more cream) and added just a bit of merlot before boiling it all down. The onions are delicious and the mushrooms incorporate all of the flavors - excellent! The mushrooms cook down quite a bit (especially if you let all the flavors really sink in). Enjoy!

My husband and I both thought this was horrible!!! It left a bad after taste that was comparable to rancid meat!!

Great dish, I was not able to get the onions crispy, but they were nice and carmelized. Definite make again.

Fantastic!! To quote my husband after his first bite, "a beef lover's paradise!" The onions, mushrooms and that sauce just complement the beef so well. Since there was just the two of us, we grilled a 3/4 lb. piece of flank steak. I reduced the broth a bit before I put in the sauce ingredients and let that reduce again - served the sandwiches on toasted focaccia with homemade potato salad on the side. A definite keeper!

My onions did not get crispy, but this recipe was a great way to use up christmas prime rib leftovers. My boyfried loved it. I'd make it again but i'd add a little spice next time -- maybe some cayenne or minced jalapeno. I toasted the bread and melted some swiss cheese.

Loved it, I cooked the onions as stated and they actually were more on the carmelized side than crispy side. So I tried it again with a light coating of flour and seasoning. Much better. It was a huge hit.

A delicious way to use up leftover steak! I did not have mushrooms on hand, so I used green pepper. Also, I put some grated Provolone cheese in the sandwich and toasted in the oven until melted. Fantastic!

This was great. I added half a chopped red pepper to the mixture at the end.

This was the perfect left over recipe for steak. My husband thought it was the best steak sandwich he's ever had. My onions did not come out "crisp", but they were carmelized and delicious. The only change I made was I used milk, instead of heavy cream. Still came out wonderful. My husband usually takes left overs for lunch, but I saved this for my lunch the next day.

This was a fantastic sandwich. All of the ingredients truly compliment each other.

Delicious! The only change I made was adding Fontina cheese. Don't change the onion prep method as they add add a great texture and unique flavor to the sandwich(although they are time consuming).

I changed a few things to fit my busy schedule..first i cooked the onions and mushrooms together and added to the sauce mixture.I used deli sliced roast beef....i layered the roast beef first,then the mushroom & sauce mixture,topped off by swiss cheese...baked til warm and the cheese melted. Was great!

I used steak sliced into thin strips and fried in a no stick pan until brown and then simmered in a little water until tender. I then proceeded with recipe except that I added pepper strips as well and used crusty buns. Shredded swiss cheese would be great on top too.
