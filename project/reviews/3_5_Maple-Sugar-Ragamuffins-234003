These are fabulous as cinnamon rolls and the recipe is easy to modify for cinnamon rolls. They can be whipped up on short notice and your audience will think you are fabulously talented. I made these for my Ecuadorian host family and knocked them silly with my skills (which are limited because I'm 17). I have made them again and again including for Christmas morning. Go for it. I discovered this recipe as a result of my fear of baking with yeast (and my lack of transportation to a grocery store to buy some).

These were great! I used about 2/3 of the butter they said for the filling and about 3/4 cup of maple sugar with no loss of yumminess. I think next time I would add some cinnamon, nutmeg, and nuts to the filling. We ate them cold for several days, and they were still delicious. I will definitely make these again.

I made one ingredient change/substitution - I used 2 T. of sour cream in place of 2 T. of the milk because I only had 1% milk. Otherwise, I also baked in a pan with the buns close together and that kept them together. They were so delicious and not too sweet. Highly recommended to make with the maple sugar.

Um, for the cook from New Jersey, adding that much less sugar would affect how the dough comes out. Also, walnuts make it more heavy. Try making the recipe as written(or close to it) or please do not rate the recipe - just leave a comment.

I made the recipe as written and also a batch with a few changes. I used brown sugar and melted butter for simplicity the 2nd time, adding 1/4 cup cocoa to the melted spread, and it was equally enjoyable. The chocolate makes for a wonderful evening treat! I baked mine in a 9x9 pan, side by side and this prevented unrolling.

These are easy to make and always well-liked. I have made the recipe exactly as written and have also tried substituting brown sugar for half the maple sugar called for. Both versions were delicious. I found that chilling the roll for one hour made it easier to cut into slices and also ensured that the slices did not unroll during baking.

This is a great recipe: I too substituted buttermilk, and instead of maple sugar I used half brown half white granulated sugar, with two tablespoons of cinnamon mixed in. They come out very nicely and though they do separate a little, it only adds to the appearance. I made these for a high school class, and they were a huge hit.

these turned out very tasty, i describe it as a cross between a cinnamon roll and a biscuit. i didn't have maple sugar, so i used half brown sugar, half white sugar for the filling and added a little cinnamon. they do spread out quite a bit and unwound during baking, as another review mentioned, so try to keep them as tight as possible when rolling.

I didn't have butter or maple sugar so I used tub margarine and brown sugar instead. Instead of rolling the dough I patted it into shape. I really liked these and will make them again. I will also just make the dough and try it as a drop biscuit without the brown sugar.

These were terrific. I substituted buttermilk for whole milk, and that worked out very well. I used the food processor to combine the dough ingredients and transferred the contents to a big metal bowl when a ball started to form. One minor complaint: the spirals tended to unwind a bit while baking.

I followed the recipe to the letter, and found the result delicious--flaky, crunchy, the maple filling nicely set off by the not-too-sweet dough. Next time, I plan to experiment a little with other flavors--by adding chopped nuts to the filling spread, for example, or perhaps a bit of dried fruit.

These were a nice treat, very easy to make but almost tooth-achingly sweet. Almost, but not quite!

OK - I do not know what I did wrong but these are awful - just awful - I have made plain ole biscuits a million times (especially drop biscuits) and they are always great. Well, first I did not use as much sugar spread out on the dough as I should have - I thought perhaps one cup sounded like a lot but it is needed because this recipe is horrible. Even though I used about 1/4 cup of sugar, these biscuits were like lead, they took forever to bake - I had them in the oven for about 35 minutes because they were not browning quickly. Then I added chopped walnuts to the spread before rolling the dough which would have tasted great if the recipe was not so bad. So, what did I do wrong - these are totally tasteless, heavy as hell on the stomach, and taste like doughy paste. I cannot figure it out - oh well, will not use this recipe again, for sure.
