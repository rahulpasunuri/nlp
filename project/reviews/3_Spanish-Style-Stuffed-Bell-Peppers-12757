I love this recipe! I use Poblano peppers and add corn to it. Sometimes I use noodles in place of the rice and I eat the "stuffing" with no peppers somtimes. Some fresh garlic is great too.

Disappointed in this recipe. Made exactly as instructed except added 1/3kg of lean ground beef with the onion in the attempt to make this into a main. The cumin did not spice the mixture enough for me which was disappointing after the two hour prep plus cooking, as mention by a previous reviewer. Will not be making this again. One positive was that two peppers were filling for all diners.

I made these peppers as a side dish to the Achiote Chicken Skewers with Guava Sauce from this site. They had a wonderful flavor and did not take very long to prep. My rice did not cook all the way though, so I was disappointed :( I used orange bell peppers to stuff and used a chopped poblano in the stuffing instead of another bell pepper. I also omitted the almonds. The flavor was very, very good. Needs to bake longer though, or at a higher temp.

We added chorizo and served it along side spanish-style crockpotted pork and slow roasted garlic tomatoes. Delicious!

I thought this was a great recipe with good flavor, except for the rice part. I added some ground turkey and used some leftover marinara sauce I had instead of tomato, and used fresh corn instead of peas and everything was great. Then I added the rice and broth, but the rice never cooked. I did use brown rice which could be the problem, but it ruined the whole dish because no matter how much broth I added or how long I let it simmer, the rice never cooked. So I would advise leaving out the rice, otherwise a great recipe.

Doubled the cumin and garlic, added one more T of toasted almonds. Used only .5 cup of rice / 1.5 cups broth, for 3 bell peppers. My husband esp. loved this nut-rich veggie version, being a long-time vegetarian, but we all thought pretty good. Prep time .5 hours, reasonable.

These are very yummy and pretty good for a vegetarian stuffed pepper. I was looking for a stuffed pepper recipe without meat. However, serves 6 is probably not accurate. Maybe 6 sides? I think it serves more like 3, because we wanted to eat both halves of the peppers. If you added some sausage or other meat, they would be a LOT more substantial and filling - perhaps serving 6. I would make them again but maybe with some meat.

I have not yet made this recipe, but if you are a fan of stuffed peppers then try the "Couscous and feta stuffed peppers" recipe on this website. It is outstanding

This recipe had too much prep work. Start to finish, I spent nearly 2 hours preparing it. I added portabello mushrooms and parmesan cheese and substituted fresh corn for the peas. I wish I'd added even more portabellos. I also added cooked ground beef to a few to satisfy the meat lovers. I preferred the vegetarian ones.

I've been looking for a good vegetarian stuffed pepper recipe for ages, and am delighted to have found this one. The flavor is delicate and delicious. It's even better as leftovers, straight from the fridge. As other reviewers have mentioned, shrimp would fit in very well, and I may try that in the future.

I took a cue from the paella reference in the introduction to the recipe, and threw in about 3/4 lb. of tiny shrimp at the last. Doubled the cumin and tripled the garlic. Also, because we like hot food in my house, some red pepper flakes found their way in there as well. Was successful.

Pretty good but needs more "umph." We added 3/4 lb of ground beef, a couple of dashes of our favorite hot sauce and a couple of Ts of fresh parmesan. Loved the sweetness of the red pepper with the savoriness of the filling.

Very good recipe - especially for vegetarians (although chicken broth might be an issue - in which case try vegetarian broth). Nice, spunky taste to it. If doubling the recipe for a larger party, remember to start with 3 cups of broth first, slowly adding in more until you reach the desired consistency / texture. Agree with those who added more almonds and a bit more cumin than stated in the recipe.

THIS IS BORING! I kept thinking, "BRING ON THE MEAT!" I used to be a veggie until I got pregnant and then I found out that my husband was right when he said meat is what I was missing in life! My ancestors must have been the "hunter gathers!" BLAND!

I thought the ingredient list looked very tasty and they smelled great while cooking. But there was something missing...not much taste at all. If I made it again I might try adding more cumin to give it more zing.

I loved this recipe. As a vegetarian it was great tasting and very filling. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken but did add portabella mushrooms to give it a stronger (meatier) taste.

I've made this dish twice so far. The first time was as written, and it was a big success. Tonight I made some adjustments...I used hot sauce instead of cumin, and added it with the broth. I stirred in cubed smoked ham and some shrimp at the end and baked it in a casserole dish rather than stuffing peppers with it. A huge hit once more. I'll definitely be making both variations again!

I guess I'm too much of a carnivor! The entire time I kept thinking, this dissh is lacking, it needs something - then I thought I would be great with ground beef, pork or chicken.

Very good. My boyfriend and his friend loved this. I tend to prefer stuffed peppers with more of a sauce type filling, but the flavours in this were delicious. Would definitely make again.

This dish met all my requirements for taste, and low fat nutrition, and my husband loved it. I used brown rice, threw in lots more almonds and substituded corn for peas, added cayenne and more garlic. I used Pacific chicken broth. Also threw in golden raisins. Takes more broth to fully cook the brown rice.

Easy to make and tasty. I added Scallops and brought back the seafood.

An excellent dish!!!I did not use peas,only zuchinni..plus I cut back on the peppers in the stuffing. My boyfriend loved this recipe!

...with a slight variation to the original recipe, this is a MAGNIFICENT HEALTHY MEAL!!! You can substitute some of the peppers with firm tomatoes (this is quite common in Greek meals) and only use red, yellow or orange bell peppers. Delete the zuchini and improvise on the spices...but the almonds are an absolute necessity!Lastly, add just a bit of bread crumbs mixed in butter for the topping...and enjoy!

I didn't make it with the almonds (allergy) and maybe that had something to do with it, but it was borrrrrinnnnggggg
