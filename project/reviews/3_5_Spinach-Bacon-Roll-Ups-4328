After reading the reviews I decided to make these appetizers for a dinner party, with puff pastry and tortillas. I added parmesan cheese also for added taste. I thought they were just ok, there weren't many compliments on them. I had also fixed guacamole and garlic parmesan chicken wings for a variety. The chicken wings disappeared quickly to rave reviews. I don't think I will make the roll ups again. (I used fresh spinach as suggested by another reviewer; sauteed in olive oil with a little garlic.

I made these for a family gathering and they were a big hit. I added some parmesan cheese and some chopped water chestnuts for crunch (thanks to the advise of another reviewer). I'll definitely make them again - very easy.

I love this recipe. Everytime I've fixed it everyone raves about it.

A definite staple in my household! I also add cheddar cheese, parmesan cheese and a bit of sour cream. Warm the tortillas, fill, roll and then put in the fridge overnight. I don't bake at all. Very good!!

I've taken the puff pastry version, and added all kinds of variations for an AMAZING quick and easy appetizer. Goat cheese and pesto(with or without sun-dried tomatoes), smoked gouda and pesto with the spinach, caramelized onions and brie (or any cheese) -you can use just about anything you've got bits of in your fridge, and come up with something really impressive. I cut each sheet of pastry in half, roll it out slightly, and top each with different ingredients. Everytime I make these, people rave about them, and think I've spent hours in the kitchen. Very highly recommended!!!

Made this exactly as recipe specified. I would not change a thing. They were the hit of the party. Easy and delicious.

I've made this recipe exactly as written and I've also made some alterations based on the reviews I read. The second version is definetely the better one. I substituted red onion sauteed in bacon drippings like someone suggested. I also substituted goat cheese for the cream cheese. I bought some puff pastry and used that instead of the tortillas. They baked up in 12 minutes, as opposed to 7 and looked so amazing when they came out of the oven. The tortillas are a good fast option but I think the puff pastry puts this one over the top. Also, you don't lose so much on the ends because you can roll the pastry out into a square and any uneven bits are hidden when it puffs up. I have frozen several logs already rolled and will take them out whenever I have an impromptu get together. Highly reccommended.

I've been making this recipe for years, always to rave reviews. I substitute red onion, sauteed in a scant amount of the bacon drippings, and add a handful of finely chopped waterchestnuts. SO good!

I made this a couple days ago for the first time. I didn't heat the tortillas because I didn't have time, but they turned out fine anyway. I used fresh baby spinach and added 1/2 cup shredded swiss cheese, because I think spinach and swiss cheese just go together. My guests (and my husband and I) loved them, so much so that I made them again today for different guests. Will definitely keep this one in the hopper.

These were just OK; based on reviews I thought this was my lo-carb app'y solution (using lo-carb tortillas). I don't care for the slightly bitter taste of froz. spinach & it's chewy texture, so if I did it next time I would saute fresh spinach. The bacon flavor was the highlight, and because I used lo-sodium bacon & only added an 1/8th tsp salt the saltiness was fine. No rave reviews from any of my guests or husband. They did heat well & looked rather pretty on the platter.

I have been making these for years, and they are always a hit. Making them ahead and then just slicing and baking at party time is so convenient. People gobble them right up.

I love this recipe! A nice enhancement I make is to omit the salt, definitely use water chestnuts, sometimes add sauted shallots (in butter) AND (the best part) use puff pastry dough instead of tortillas!! YUMMY and elegant!

Made these for a Superbowl party, and they were scarfed up. I used homemade mayo, omitted the salt, and added Tabasco and Worcestershire, which gave it a zing, but I think that the green onions made the filling a little too bitter. Next time, I'll decrease the green onion and maybe add some sauteed onion or shallot to add some sweetness to it.

Simple to make. Cut down on the mayo.

I made this recipe for a "Ladies Night Out" party because of all the wonderful reviews it got. I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical because it seems so ordinary & too easy to be so good. This was a big hit! Gone within minutes of coming out of the oven and everyone wanted the recipe. Coming from a group of women who are pretty good cooks says enough. I sauteed fresh baby spinach, omitted the salt (as suggested many times in the reviews), used 2TBLS of dried chives mixed in with the mayonaise (I doubled the recipe and would suggest 1TBL for the origial) and used 5 10" tortillas. I will try the water chestnuts for a little crunch next time as suggested and also agree that ham or sausage could be used in place of the bacon.

I made these roll-ups 2 years ago for my annual Christmas cocktail party and they were a hit. They were devoured! I love the advance prep. I think I might make them again this year!

I don't like it when people don't use the original recipe and then rate low, BUT, I didn't have bacon but had proscuitto(truly a fluke)and cooked it up as if it were . . . it "ain't". But the whole roll up was doughy and a little bit dry with a bitter undertaste. If I WERE to try it again I would use a ton more cream cheese and . . . BACON!

The reviews are right, I made them and they were gobbled up. The only appetizer that I ran out of. This is an easy recipe and tastes great. Also nice that they can be made in advance. I made them in the morning and didn't cut and serve until that night (7 hours later). They kept well.

Whenever I serve these, they're gone in five minutes and everyone asks for the recipe. Some minor changes... -omit salt -instead of bacon, use about an inch and a half of dry Italian sweet sausage (or hot sausage if you like it) -vegetarians (like me!), try it with fakin' bacon or veggie Canadian bacon...and double the amount of "meat" -try using a square flat bread (Joseph's Lavash Roll-ups) instead of tortillas. Less waste because it's square and it's easier to roll. -this freezes rather well! Freeze before slicing, then thaw slightly and slice before baking. I try to keep my freezer stocked with them so I can bring to parties, but it's really hard to keep my husband from eating them!

I have made a version of this for years. I omit the salt, add more green onion, using the whole onion for color, and add chopped water chestnuts. I also use precooked packaged bacon and snip it with kitchen shears to save time. I have never heated the tortillas. After they're wrapped in plastic wrap, I chill them in the refrigerator all day or overnight. I also have never baked the slices before serving. I always double the recipe because these go fast, even when served with fancier fare. Men seem to especially love them.

I doubled this recipe for my Easter dinner, and let me tell you, do not double the salt! I added about a teaspoon and a half (which is less than it calls for) and found it way too salty. Other than that this was a good and interesting recipe which was devoured in the first 5 minutes.

I would cut back on the spinach a little.

Just wonderful and very easy. I warmed up the tortillas in the microwave to make pliable. LEAVE OUT THE SALT. The only problem was not making enough of these! A big hit on the 4th of July! KIMBER

Had so much hope for these. In theory, the filling in the tortilla is a great concept. In actuality, it was bland and not very exciting. Am glad I tried these on my family first before company. Maybe nix the bacon, add crab & some seasonings & hope they turn out better??

These are a HUGE HIT! I have made these for several different parties, and I get raves and requests for the recipe each time. I've varied the recipe some...used cayenne pepper instead of black, and that gave it a big kick. Also substituted canadian bacon for regular bacon, and it was PHENOMINAL. My friends have stolen the recipe and are now bringing these to parties...so I have to come up with a new twist :-)

I have made this twice in the last week. everyone has loved it. The second time I diced water chestnuts and I like it much better with the little added crunch. Great finger food.

I really love this appetizer and every time I serve it to rave reviews. However, I do make one major change in my version. I use 1/4 cup chopped/diced cooked ham instead of the bacon. My sister cannot eat bacon and after making the recipe the first time with bacon, then substituting the second time with ham for my sister, every one said that they preferred the ham. So do I. Also, it makes it much faster to make.

This recipe has become a staple when preparing for parties. My family and friends always put in a request for it. Plan on a different variation using puff pastry. Definitely omit salt - salt from bacon is more than enough.

These were a hit at my office party! I added cayenne, 3 cloves of garlic, and some fresh basil to the recipe. I also made the spinach mixture, minus the bacon, the night before and refrigerated; adding the bacon in the morning. This seemed to allow the flavors to blend together. I will be making this again!

Made these last weekend for Patio Party. Upon advice, used sour cream and eliminated salt. Added some minced garlic and still felt taste of roll-ups were very bland. I did not heat up and served at room temp. Maybe that was the problem. Would not make again.

I made these three of four times over the holidays and they were a hit every time. I agree with the others that the roll-ups are a bit salty. I cut the salt by half. This is a very quick and easy appetizer that is also quite delicious. I would definitely recommend it.

very tasty. I used only half of the salt, but it was still a little too salty for me. Next time, I would omit salt altogether. Overall, it was a very easy, and wonderful recipe.

Excellent! I agree, you don't need to warm the tortillas. I'd also cut the salt down by at least half--it was pretty salty.

This is a great recipe and it's fast! You can keep tossing them in the oven as guests arrive. I usually make a double or triple batch and freeze some. Goes well with a cal chardonnay. Plates nicely with the cut face up.

The tag line is right -- these are perfect for cocktails and parties. I've never had a single one of them left over, and best of all, almost all the prep is done well in advance. I use low-fat mayo and cream cheese -- found them less tasty with fat-free versions -- and mix in a little balsamic vinegar with the spinach.

I make this for a main course by adding cooked chicken breast, green chilis, cilantro, and garlic. A good fresh salsa and sliced avocados over the top make a nice addition. Oh, also I use no-fat cream cheese and no-fat sour cream instead of mayo. YUMMY!

everytime I make it, more people want the recipe - thanks for having it in epicurious ! I've also used lavash (a flat bread that's usually available) and that's very good, too. No fat and no 'heating'

I've made this a number of times, but with the addition of deli shaved rotisserie chicken once and barbecued chicken since. It's always been a hit and much requested recipe. The chicken makes it more of a heavy appetizer or light meal and I cook it whole, not sliced (it tends to dry out on the edges once cut).
