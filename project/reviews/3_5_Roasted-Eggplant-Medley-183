Good. Eggplant needs to be peeled IMO. Threw in a green tomato, quartered; very good. I roasted too; it only needed 30 mins. Will do again with summer veggies.

The flavors were just perfect together. Will make this again and again. I left out the mint, but will try it next time. I also used dried cilantro. Easy to make, and serving it at room temperature makes it a plus when you are entertaining. Delicious!

delicious and easy. Fresh ingredients are key.

Very nice recipe. I mixed 1/3 cup of orzo with the roasted veggies to get some carbs in there. Nice, light and healthy. I'll do it again.

Outstanding! Even though I consider this a winter "comfort food" type of dish, it is a hit any time!

Was looking for something to do with 1 large zucchini, 2 very small eggplants, and a large tomato that had to be used immediately. Halved this recipe, as I had all the other ingredients either in the kitchen or the garden, changing nothing. Loved it as a first course with good, crusty bread, and the next day as an omelette filling.

This rocked! I took another reviewer's advice and roasted everything in the oven on 450 for about 45 min., stirring and switching the positions of the two baking sheets midway through. Also added two onions. Our one year old couldn't get enough of the eggplant.

We absolutely loved this recipe. Always looking for new vegetable dishes as we are slowly switching over to a more vegetarian lifestyle. This had alot of flavor. I used canned tomatoes (drained), dried mint, and sea salt. There were no leftovers and there was only two of us.

I roasted the medley at 450 degrees for about 45 minutes too--so much simpler than broiling. Made it just about as printed & it was delicious. I love the blend of herbs & spices.

I won't rate this recipe since I left out all the seasoning but salt and pepper. I had some marvelous, very fresh veggies and didn't want to mask the flavor in any way. Just tossed with the oil (added a quartered onion, a green pepper and some garlic) and baked at 450 for 30 minutes per previous review. Needed less watching than broiling. Gave it a splash of balsamic vinegar and served at room temp. Great with lamb.

This is a great side dish. I modified somewhat because I needed the oven for something else at the same time and couldn't use the broiler. I omitted the cumin, added an onion, and added a few cloves of garlic along with the vegatables, then roasted at 450 for about 45 minutes, stirring once or twice. Then I tossed with the lemon juice, cilantro and mint. Really easy, minimal prep time, and the vegetables retain their own distinctive flavors, especially the eggplant, which tastes wonderful! Enjoy!

Found the cumin over powering and couldn't understand one large green onion chopped added after cooking. I think putting in some yellow onion to cook would have been better. First one of the recipes that I have tried from here that I wouldn't try again.

An easy, tasty roasted ratatoulle.
