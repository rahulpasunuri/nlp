I subbed in dried cherries and roasted almonds, and it was delightful--a super-easy, delicious summer dessert.

Excellent dessert and perfect for summer--while it doesn't look like it from the ingredients, it's very light in texture.

This was a big hit with my dinner guests. I served it with fresh berries. Four forks from me.

I don't know what you guys are talking about- I thought this was fabulous! Very easy and my guests thought it ws excellent. I wouldnt change anything in the recipe but I would provide more than 4 hours to freeze. I froze for 5 hours before serving and if wasnt enough. Make the day before if you can.

Out of 4 older teenagers, none of them liked this. I thought it was just "Ok". Very easy to make and the orange flavor was great....just didn't blow my dinner guests away. Thank goodness I did a sweet potato pie with it!!!!

Delicious. Easy to make. I was making it for someone who is allergic to hazelnuts, so I substituted toasted chopped almonds.
