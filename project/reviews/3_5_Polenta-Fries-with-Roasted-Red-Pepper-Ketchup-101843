These might be even more addictive than french fries. And the ketchup! Certainly double the recipe, because you'll want to use it on everything!

These are a great alternative to regular potato french fries. And the dipping sauce adds a unique twist to traditional ketchup.

Without the roasted red pepper ketchup these are not the special-est side items. They are quite filling without really meriting all that space in your stomach/on your hips. But again, the ketchup takes it to another level.

The only 'catch' to this recipe is being absolutly sure that you use great cheese with real flavor.
