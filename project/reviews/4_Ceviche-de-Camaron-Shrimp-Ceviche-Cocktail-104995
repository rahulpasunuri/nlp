Great authentic recipe. REAL ceviche comes in many forms. I believe this one is from the west coast region of Mexico,ketchup and all.

This is a great recipe. Everyone loves and I've passed this on to many. It's easy and even cook shrimp cocktail this way because the shrimp come out tasty and not tough. Have made this many times and will make it many more.

Update from my last review - I cheated & used small, precooked, deveined shrimp. I used someone else's idea and simmered it slightly in salted water & Old Bay Seasoning ... very nice! Did everything else, used hothouse cucumber(rather than jicama) & added some chopped tomatoes (removed seeds from both), added avocado to the serving, rather than mixing it in with the mixture. Added extra drops of Tapatio on each serving. YUM.

The only reason i gave this four forks . . . . is because there's not five. THIS RECIPE SMITES ALL OTHER SHRIMP LIKE RECIPIES!! I cut the shrimp up before mixing it all together to eat it on tortilla chips. I was so impatient to eat this that I didnt even let it marinate for an hour. I do not regret it . . . my only regret is that I have lived my whole life without having made this recipe. Skip the wine pairing and have a tomato beer or margarita. Thank you Rick Bayless. Life is good!

I forgot to mention when I watched them make this in Mexico, the acid in the lime juice will 'cook' the shrimp and/or small scallops and even the Mexicans I knew in Cuernavaca used a little ketchup and their avocado was firm so cubing worked well and the avocado retained its color. Another option was to forgo the ketchup and add cubed mango.

Love the recipe - the only ingredient I would add is fresh deveined, seeded, minced jalapeno to taste

I wanted to serve this from a buffet at a casual party and found that chopping the shrimp and serving it with chips was all that needed to be done. The combination of flavors in the proportions recommended was just right to my taste. I would not bother to cook the shrimp as described again, though: trying to clean the steamed shrimp by scraping out the vein was tedious. It's easier to pull it out before cooking.

I've made this recipe several times and it's terrific. It's a huge hit at dinner parties. I serve it in a bowl next to blue corn tortilla chips. Here are my suggestions: 1. Add 1/2 lb of bay scallops, don't back off the shrimp. This makes the dish absolutely delicious and now it's more like a seafood ceviche. Prepare scallops like the shrimp but only boil 30 seconds and steam for maybe a minute. 2. I use 1/2 the ketchup and cut it with homemade roasted chilie sauce. This cuts the sweetness and adds a little heat. 3. Becareful with the avocado. It adds essential richness but if the avocado is really ripe and creamy, it combines with the ketchup to make a rather unattractive brown sauce. To avoid this, consider using an avocado that is not super ripe and/ or add the avocado at the end as a garnish to top of the dish.

Great recipe - very tasty. Just needed to increase the amount of a few things and used chili sauce instead of ketchup. Will make this over and over again.

DUDE. This is a good recipe! A couple of reviewers before me got it right .... easy to customize. I use a little less ketchup, seeded cucumber (rather than jicama, which I normally love), numerous splashes of Tapatio Mexican Sauce in the coctel and extra splashes on the coctel as it sits on my tostada! I also cut up the shrimp into smaller pieces. Very labor intensive ... I like ultra-deveined shrimp. A true labor of love ... sprinkle large chunks of lovely, oily avocado all over when served. Wow. Margarita chaser is a must.

Huge hit - and yes, the ketchup is just fine. I doubled, but chopped the larger shrimp into smaller pieces and also added some bay scallops (sushi grade, so didn't worry if it was slightly less than 4 hours). A keeper recipe for sure.

Awesome Awesome AWESOME!! Bayless is a Mexican Food God. I feel the same way about Mexico, it's culture, it's food just as he does. Love this ceviche, minus the ketchup. To me, it adds a sweetness I don't like in ceviche. I use Roma tomatoes diced very small. The smaller the shrimp, the better. I buy the tiny frozen shrimp when they're on BOGO. I boil mine in Zatarain's Crab Boil, VERY briefly, and the flavor is awesome!! I could eat this every day.

Fantastic. I made the recipe as written (except as noted at the end) even though I was wary of the ketchup, but in the end I wouldn't change anything. I used small Maine shrimp, which are great, and otherwise would use larger shrimp and chop them a bit. The recipe suggests not making it ahead of time, but I had the leftovers 24 and 48 hours later and thought it was still great. - Used 1C cucumber...no jicama available - I tossed the lime juice with the cooked shrimp and diced onion...I love tossing onions in acid (vinegar/lime/etc) to cut down on the harshness - Served with whole wheat off-brand saltines, which worked well.

Just a note to A Cook from San Diego....you have to cook shellfish ceviche because although the citrus juices "cook" the fish, it does not kill the bacteria that can be found in shellfish. This is not the case with other fish when making ceviche...just shellfish.

Rating: 0
This is not ceviche at all. You don't boil the fish, shrimp, etc. when making ceviche. Rather, you use citrus to "cook" the protein. This is more of a mexican-style shrimp cocktail, which is better than the classic american version, in my opinion. And, most mexicans I know, don't like ketchup in their coctailes cammeron.

Fantastic recipe! I make this a couple of times a month all summer. I tried this recipe with ketchup, and just didn't like it. Try canned crushed tomatoes as a replacement. Other suggestions, make sure the avocados are slightly firmer than you would normally buy or the ceviche will end up mooshy. Watch the lime. I start with half of the stated amount and add the rest at the end as needed. I also add 1/2 to 1 pint of halved grape sized tom's. I love this addition. My only other comment is that, in my opinion, cooking the shrimp isn't worth the work. I buy cooked shrimp.

I am Mexican and this ceviche is exactly what I remember eating there. I definitley go for the Buffalo sauce, but that can be hard to find. As others have said do not be deterred by the ketchup and do not substitute, this is an important part of the dish. Add dashes of Worcestershire sauce too! The trick is to start with with a small amount of the ingredients and then taste and add more as you see fit.

Wonderful! I made it as an app for a backyard fish taco BBQ and it was the rave. I made it as-is. Don't let the ketchup scare you. It definitely got better the next day as the flavors married. Jicama is a must -- the texture is lovely. A new household favorite!

Rating: 4
Wow!! What an easy and tasty dish! Because I like to scoop up the ceviche with my tortilla chips, I winded up cutting my med. size shrimp into small scoopable bites. I also added only half of the ketchup and one whole diced tomatoe. I also used Tapatio hot sauce-left the bottle out for those who wanted a bit more kick. Everyone loved this dish. I can't wait to make it again and make an impression again!!

I used 1/2 lb shrimp and 1/2 lb imitation crab meat, added a tomato and some yellow chile peppers to the recipe - turned out absolutely fantastic! I made it for a Christmas party and the ceviche went over so well, I was asked to make it again for a New Year's party. Personally, I thought the ceviche tasted better after having it sit for a day in the fridge. Also, pairing it with lime tortilla chips works wonderfully.

An amazing all season crowd pleaser!! I substituted the onion for 1 shallot finely diced (I have those in my family not so onion friendly). The recommendation to subsitute tomatoes for the ketchup was brilliant! I also added small bite size scallops to the dish the last time (Christmas) and received the same reviews. A must especially in the summer for al fresco dining.

An absolute sure winner. An all-season pleaser.Read the reviews. When tomatoes are in season here, I look forward to using the more tomato- less ketchup suggestion. I doubled the recipe, used half the cilantro, in deference to reluctant tasters. It was still wonderful! Follow your own palate. Can't imagine how superior this would be with real deal Gulf shrimp!

Amazing - yummy - easy - total crowd pleaser. Thank you. I followed the recipt almost exactly. I used frozen, tails-off, uncooked shrimp. Like other reviewers, I used 1/4 cup diced tomatoes and 1/4 cup ketchup. I also split the cucumber and jicama. This was exactly what I was looking for. It will be a regular at parties!!!

Rating: 0
This is good, but its better if you have the medium shrimp, raw. Wash the shrimp, put them in a large bowl, marinate them in lime juice (make sure the juice covers the shrimps completly and stir once in a while, they will cook with the lime juice). When they turn orange they are cooked, cut if desired and then you just added the rest of the ingredients, except the ketchup, that's not ceviche, that's another mexican dish where the shrimps are fried with the ketchup and salsa.

Rating: 4
This recipe is very strong in its fundamentals. I had another ceviche recipe which was too heavy on the citrus, and used this recipe to 'correct' the other. It is also strong in that it can survive and be enhanced by the addition of tasty supplements, like chopped red or yellow bell pepper. Keep this one around and be creative. it will serve you well for a long time.

This was a huge hit at my party. For my taste, I felt that the ketchup made it just a little bit too sweet and I'd probably use less next time. I added crabmeat to stretch it a little farther and the combination was delicious. However, the cooking time on shrimp that size is WAY too long and they were definitely overdone. The 41/50s are small enough that you can probably put them in the boiling water and then immediately pour it off and steam them...but they were still really good and my guests ate up every last morsel. P.S. Definitely do the jicama/cucumber combo.

This recipe got rave reviews at my party this weekend. I made the shrimp the night before and marinated it in the lime overnight. I added the rest the morning of the party as I was scared it would not keep, but I just enjoyed some leftovers. It's Monday and the party was Saturday. I think it tasted better today. I would recommend the jicama for the crunchiness it adds to the salad. I used a mixture of 3 parts jicama and 1 part cucumber. I used extra avocado like the other reviewers. A definite keeper!!! Easy to make too. Especially if you use the raw peeled shrimp that you can find in the supermarket.

Rating: 4
Very Tasty!! My guests loved this. I steamed the shrimp until just barely cooked, then marinated overnight in the 1/2 c. lime juice. Used a hot house cuke as jicama was no where to be found. Used the Bufalo sauce (3 tablespoons) along with two avocados. Tossed it all together about two hours b4 serving. Served on golden corn tostados that I heated in the oven for a few minutes, garnished with a lime slice, avocado slice and a sprig of cilantro. This was a HIT. I'll make this one again and again. Everyone wanted seconds and my boyfriend at the leftovers for breakfast the next day!!

I don't know who named this recipe ceviche--it originally appeared here as Mexican Shrimp Cocktail, Cocktel de Camarones, which is what it is. Ceviche is entirely different. All the Mexican restaurants and families I know make the cocktail sauce with ketchup, just exactly like this. And this is the absolute best way to cook shrimp that isn't tough and overdone!

This dish is great. When you are tired of bringing the 'usual' potluck dishes to gatherings, this one spices things up. I like to add taco sauce to the ketchup (mix it) and used my version of 2 Tbsp vinegary hot sauce (Jack Daniels Jalepeno Hot Sauce), which I think gives it a little kick, but not too hot. I served it with gold Tortilla chips and found that to be the best. Everyone wanted the recipe exactly how I made it.

I found this recipe to be okay, I was looking for a quick and easy recipe to teach to people and this was definitly easy (I used p&d shrimp 51-60) but the flavor was definitly not as good as a true ceviche. Fresh lime juice is definitly the key! It was well recieved from those who had never heard or tried it before, but for me, EHh!

Rating: 0
First of all, I think this is the perfect way to boil shrimp w/o overcooking. They came out perfect w/o being overdone, so this it was worthwhile doing this recipe if only to learn this. I was looking for a more traditionl ceviche, so instead of hot sauce and ketchup, we added one jalapeno, and used the avocado and cucumber. I used used red onion for the color and I did not see the need for the olive oil, although I may try that next time. Very pretty dish.

This recipe was a huge hit at the surprise party I threw for my mother. All of her friends begged her for the recipe. I used jicama, bufalo jalapeno sauce and frozen shrimp b/c that is what we had. the shrimp were large so i cut them into bite size pieces and served the dish as a dip with chips.

Rating: 3
Great dish! I changed it a little using 1/2 pound shrimp and 1/2 pound lump crab meat. I also followed another cook's advice and used more avocado. If I made it again I would probably cut down on the ketchup or add more hot sauce--it was a little sweet for me. I will definately make this again.

This is definitely a crowd pleaser. I make this recipe all the time and serve it as an appetiser. Most of the time I use the pre-cooked shrimp from the grocery store for simplicity reasons and I always add an additional avocado and cilantro and serve it with chips. My girlfriends go nuts for this and so does my husband!

I've made this recipe at least two dozen times and after many trials my only variations are frozen, peeled, tail-off shrimp (for the sake of simplicity) and because I like Mexican style seafood cocktails I like a LOT more juice. I serve this in tall ice cream sundae type glasses. To get the extra juice I use spicy bottled Bloody Mary mix! If I want to serve it more salad style I don't do this, but I find that serving it like this with ice tea spoons and extra lime is what gets the best responses.

This recipe rocks! I was really skeptical about it (with the ketchup and all) but it is soooo great! I made it for a dinner party.. I laid out Tostitos Gold chips topped them with the ceviche and put a small piece of avocado on top with a sprig of cilantro. The presentation was so impressive and the taste was out of this world. Keep in mind, if you top tortilla chips with the ceviche, they get soggy quickly, so do it right before your guests arrive. Try this recipe!!!

OK folks, I have been making this dish for the past 2 years and feel it is my duty to finally rave about how incredibly good it is... I always use jicama (much better than cucumber)otherwise follow the recipe to a "T." I served this recently to a friend that I would consider a "gourmande" -- she raved and raved about it and insisted I give her the recipe... The look on her face when I told her it contained ketchup was priceless... "You mean regular ketchup, like Heinz?????" I believe she overcame her horror and will probably serve it to her friends. Of course she will probably tell thim that the recipe contains a "secret and special ingredient".... (wink, wink)

i have made this a dozen times to rave reviews. i make it for my mexican mother-in-law every year for mothers day brunch and for her birthday. i serve it in individual corn tortilla "boats" or small shells sold at a mexican supermarket. it makes a fun presentation. i also serve additional chopped serranos or jalapenos, cilantro, white onion and lime wedges on the side so guests can adjust the heat or flavors if they like. i use frozen shrimp and add to hot water. drain quickly, then add the lime juice and cover. it is a definate time saver and the flavors don't tend to suffer. really.

I Love this recipe, the first time I made it was for a dinner party and it was such a big hit that I've added it to my personal favorite recipe list. Everyone enjoyed it!!! I changed a few little things, I added crab and lobster to it and used both jicama and cucumber. I also used Tapateo hot sauce instead of what the recipe called for. I also think the longer it sits the better. Atleast 2 1/2 hours is my recommendation. I served it with both tortilla chips and saltine crackers the chips were the way to go. I'm planning a christmas party and plan to make this and serve it on slightly salted homemade tortillas, I bet this will be even better!!! Enjoy

A local mexican restaurant recently started offering ceviche de camaron and I instantly became an addict. But boy does it start to hit the wallet:) Anyway, I found this recipe and made it for a party as a kind of "fancy" salsa. Served it with Tostito's Gold corn chips and what a fabulous pairing! Everyone loved it and I have found a way to feed my crave for a much much lower price. I did make a couple of substitutions and changes. I had two avocados that were fully ripe so I used them both and we used jicama instead of cucumber.My wife brought back Bufalo's chipotle sauce since that was all they had of that brand so I used 1 Tbsp of that plus 1 of cholula which is what I keep around. I won't change a thing from what I used when next I make it.

This is great! I love to have this as a light dinner on hot days. Everything is chilled and refreshing. The contrast in textures is wonderful!

I tried this as a Mexican Shrimp Cocktail recipe, thinking the ketchup might be a nice change from the usual way I make it. Not! We ate it, but didn't like it much.

Great recipe! Also, since it's not 'real' ceviche and the shrimp don't need to cook in the juice, it turn out wonderful if you purchase the largest shrimp you can find and curl two or three over the edge of a martini glass w/ the rest of the ceviche in the glass for dipping. Beautiful presentation!

Yummm. I used Tapatio - delicious. I would suggest combining all the ingredients early in the day, but adding the avocado just before serving so it stays firm and doesn't cloud the dish. My shrimp was slightly overcooked; beware of this. The flavors are perfect; used cucumber, no jicama.

This Ceviche recipe is only about half of what authentic ceviche is really like! The real way is to not cook the shrimp, they should be peeled, and marinated in fresh lemon/lime juice with fine chopped onion and salt. You then add chopped tomatoe, cucumber, and cilantro, avocado is served separate. You then add salt, pepper, a dash of oregano, and olive according to preference. Mix all ingrediants, and serve on tostada shell with hotsauce Tapatio.

We're not ones to follow recipes. We found this recipe on Rick Bayless's web site since we wanted to duplicate a dish we enjoy at a local seafood restaurant. We made this dish for 20 guests and quadrupled the amounts. Made a few adjustments to add spice it up. Instead of plain kechup, we used ketchup with tabasco sauce and 1-1/2 cups of clamato juice with jalapeno. Also, added 5 diced jalapenos. We omitted the jicama since it's a flavorless ingredient and added more cucumbers (English hot house type). We also used frozen, large cooked shrimp rather This was a hit, and definitely would make again.

Wow! I made this twice in the past two weeks and can hardly wait to make it again. I purchased the medium-large, raw, tail-on shrimp from Costco and they were too big. The next time I cut each in half and it was just right (and so much easier than peeling and veining small shrimp). I love very spicy foods but I must admit, using two whole tablespoons of Cholula hot sauce was too hot for some of my guests. Use caution. Also, I skipped the oil.

I served this at a summer Mexican barbecue and everybody loved it! I only made one change and that was making a little shrimp broth out of the shells so that the consistancy was more like soup!

I made this with 2 lbs of large shrimp as an appetizer, hoping for leftovers to see how it would be the next day. My guests loved it, however, and ate all of it! We couldn't progress to the main course for 2 more hours because everyone was stuffed! My only complaint is my lack of a prep cook to peel and devein the shrimp.

This was very good. I used frozen, pre-cooked cocktail shrimp. Served over shredded lettuce. Try and use a ketchup with low sugar, because it was a little too sweet. And definitely buy the recommended hot sauce; we loved it. Lastly, contrary to the recipe's advice, it was BETTER the next day.
