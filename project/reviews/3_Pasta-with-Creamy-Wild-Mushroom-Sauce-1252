agree with people who said the dried mushrooms needed more time in the water. added this base to sauteed shallots (2) portobell caps (2) and chanterelles (about 3/4 pound). Served on fresh fetticini-- fed 5 and everyone raved.

This was just ok. The sauce was a pretty thin and the mushrooms had a bit of an odd texture, I used both dried and fresh. The flavour was nice, but the wine was a little overpowering, and I'd prefer a creamier sauce.

I agree with other reviewers that this was just "good". Did not have a lot of great flavor. It needs something to brighten up the flavor.

I thought this was pretty good. The flavor was nice, but it didn't have the depth that I was looking for. Also, it didn't coat the pasta quite as thoroughly as I'd have liked. I'm still searching for the right recipe.

Really good flavor. I usually stick VERY close to the recipes, but instead of adding salt at the end I chopped up some green olives. Also...a REALLY cool flavor layer was added via a couple of splashes of Sherry Vinegar. Good Stuff!!!

Delicious! the flavor was tangy and delicate. I used fresh shiitake mushrooms and I added arugula with the lemon and green onion and was pleased with the result. I did use a little flour to thicken the gravy. My sister commented that it would go well with salmon and I have to agree--a grilled salmon filet would have been the perfect pairing!

I used morels and skipped the lemon juice but otherwise made as stated. Next time, I will halve the green onions and give the morels an extra few tumbles in the boiling water, as the sauce was a tad gritty. Don't worry about the grayness or if the sauce doesn't thicken perfectly-- just serve with crusty bread. The intense wild mushroom flavors will delight.

I am not reviewing this recipe, but for those of you who are getting all huffy about the whipping cream topic - some brands of whipping cream do have added sugars, but not all of them. I had this happen to me once when making an Alfredo sauce and I had to throw it away because it tasted like a dessert. Now I always make sure to either read the ingredients or just buy the ones labeled as heavy cream.

i also used cilantro instead of tarragon, and did have to thicken up the sauce with a bit of flour. unfortunately, i overdid it on the lemon, and it ended up tasting a bit weird, but i think otherwise it would be very good, i'll be a bit more careful with the lemon next time...!

Not sure what I did wrong... the cream curdled as soon as it hit the wine, and while I fixed up the sauce using more cream, fresh pepper, etc., the over-all taste was very blah - no better than a Lipton package of noodles. Won't bother with this again as there are much better cream pasta recipes on this site.

I chose dried porcini and was very pleased with the results. I thought this dish had a wonderful, rich flavor. I made this recipe exactly as written with the exception of using fresh tarragon instead of dried and thickening the sauce with a teaspoon of flour at the end because it just didn't seem to be getting thick. (I mixed a bit of the sauce with the flour in a cup to make a roux and then poured that into the sauce.) Other than that, I think the recipe is perfect as is.

I used some cilantro and leeks instead of tarragon and onions (green). Also, I did not add lemon juice because I don't like it to overpower my cream sauce. Anyway, It was so good I ate it twice in a week...what can I say?

Good... creamy, mushroomy and winey tasting. Added the lemon juice because I like to make recipes "as is" on first try, not like some people who think that replacing mushrooms with broccoli will give the same result and then give the recipe a negative review. Anyway, didn't like the lemon taste and won't add it again. Used fresh mushrooms and still came out great. Easy and simple to make.

Very yummy recipe. Everyone enjoyed it greatly. Our only problem was that we found the sauce-to-pasta ratio was too low, and would probably double the sauce recipe for the same amount of pasta next time.

I really liked the recipe when i saw it so made it for myself for dinner.. It was vwey good but didnt especially like the seasoning, i do like terregon but didnt it was really good as the flavors didnt mis right for me.. i will use summer savory or thyme the next time i make it..It is worth trying but adjust the seasoning to your taste.

Heavy vs. Whipping Cream To add to the debate on creams, this is what Joy of Cooking has to say (pg.1070 1997 edition): Cream is made from the fat that rises to the surface of nonhomogenized milk. Whipping cream that is labeled "heavy cream" contains at least 36 percent milk fat and is the richest cream available in most stores. It is normally used in deserts. Light whipping cream, often labeled simply "whipping cream", contains 30 to 36 percent butterfat. Unwhipped, it is added to sauces and soups and is used for ice cream. Whipped, it generally frosts or garnishes desserts. Sometimes it is difficult to make whipping cream mound properly. Buy heavy cream if you can. My mother, who owned a dairy farm, told me that sweet cream simply means that the cream/butter was fresh, not old as it would sometimes get in the old days from sitting unrefrigerated.

I used "light cream" for health reasons, so you might dismiss my review. I used a tiny bit of corn starch to thicken the sauce, and it looked beautiful. The flavors weren't well blended, with lemon and wine sticking out. Maybe my palate isn't ready for porcinis prepared in this way. It looked great on paper, though. On a positive note, the suggested fruit salad was perfect for our first cold weekend.

I am not reviewing this recipe, but I had to put in my two cents to say that whipping cream is properly called heavy cream. It is called whipping cream in dessert recipes, but when a cook is referring to using cream in a main dish recipe, she usually calls it light, medium or heavy cream. By the way whipping cream (which is actually heavy cream that is about to be whipped, sugared and flavored) always has sugar and flavoring added to it before it is whipped and that is why it is sweet. Heavy cream comes from butter, has no sugar added to it and is not sweet.

I followed this recipe exactly as it was written since I'm still pretty green in the kitchen. The flavor of the sauce was truly wonderful, but the sauce did not thicken as much as I was hoping it would. So I added some grilled chicken breast at the end to absorb the sauce....delicious!

I used the recipe as a basis for some aging vegetables, and modified accordingly. First, I sauteed Vidalia onions with fresh mushrooms and tomato, then added the wine and cooked it down. I followed it up with the cream/tarragon, and because I didn't have the liquid from dried mushrooms, used chicken broth before adding scallions and lemon juice. It was delicious!

This recipe was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly. There was a sweet taste, but that had to do with the white wine, I think. For the cook that thinks cream is sweet, he is right and wrong. Cream and milk naturally have sugars in them (the reason you shouldn't drink milk and then go to bed without brushing your teeth). But cream (whipping cream) does not turn into "whipped cream" dessert topping without the cook adding quite a bit more sugar. I don't know why they call cream, whipping cream, but it is NOT because it is sweetened and ready to whip.

Now there are some fine dried mushroom combos available. On-line, you can get most anything you want.(tax free)Try the recipe with the suggested ingredients. You'll love it!

That Denver person is looney-toons. They either used Cool-Whip, or whip cream out of an aerosol can. If you get a carton of whipING cream (also known as cream) then you can make any cream sauce without fear of your dinner being "sweet". Sheesh.

I made this recipe recently for a dinner party and I was glad I did. I served it as a side dish and everyone raved. I am astounded at the other reviews claiming that this dish was not a good one. Perhaps if they made the recipe the way it was written instead of substituting things that really don't go together, they may have a change of mind. As far as being too sweet, we didn't notice any sweetness. Whipping cream is used in many pasta and cream soup dishes with great results. My advice? Give this dish one more try using the ingredients called for and you may be pleasantly surprised.

I made this dish with broccoli because I did not have mushrooms and my guests and I thought it was far, far too sweet, and it had a very strange taste. Perhaps it would have been better with mushrooms, but somewhow I don't think so. If I made it again (which I most likely will not), I would substitute the whipping cream (which was responsible for the gross dessert-like flavor) for sour cream or a cream soup (such as mushroom or celery).

This was easy to make, but my guests and I thought it wasn't very flavorful - I used a dried mushroom mix that contained dried tomatoes (source of our problem?), along with fresh tarragon (wonderful), and half-and-half

I made some changes because I had fresh crimini mushrooms and italian sausage in the fridge. So I made the sauce with the sausage then added the mushrooms and wine. Wonderful recipe! The lemon juice is a great addition, the flavors are incredible.
