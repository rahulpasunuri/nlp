This was very good. I used romaine(preference) extra garlic, and less oil than recommended. The dressing doesn't taste that great before it is mixed with the ingredients, but the cheese and vegtable juices really help bring out the flavors. I do think it is important to toss the onions(red preferably) in some extra vinegar for an hour or so before mixing, it mellows them a bit if they hang out in it for awhile.

We loved this salad. We used Kalmata olives and added thinly sliced red onion for a true Greek Salad. We found the dressing to be a bit lacking so we doubled the lemon juice and added some of the juice from the olives. Next time we will just cut back on the olive oil. We served this with the grilled Beer Can Chicken also on this site. Everyone loved it.

Excellent salad. I added thinly sliced red onion, and used a whole cucumber instead of only 1/2. Is a definite keeper!

I have been making this salad for years and it is one of our favorites. I always add more garlic to the dressing, but other than that, this recipe is perfect.

Very tasty! I decreased the olive oil by half and this worked well for the salad I also added a teaspoon of oregano.

I cut the recipe in half, and used Trader Joe's feta cheese. I coated the salad with dressing, then stuffed it into pita halves and ate it as a sandwich. Delicious! My only complaint was that the dressing seemed a bit too oily... next time I'll try cutting back by a tablespoon or so.

I've made this recipe twice now and both times, had guests rave about it. The crunchy cucumber with the garlic, vinegar and feta cheese is a great combination. It's a keeper.

This is absolutely delicious. My wife and I mop up the dressing with french or sourdough bread every time. The garlic taste lingers wonderfully on your tongue afterwards.

Excellent version of an old favorite. Added basil, which never hurts!

My area is known for their large greek population, and greek restaurants. This dressing is about the best Ive tried. The key to making a great salad with this recipe is use only top quality and fresh feta cheese. Try adding some sliced beets,pepperoncini and sliced red onions for a true authentic greek salad. Yummmmmmmmmmmm.

GREAT! I served it with a salmon pesto pizza recipe that I found on this site, and I will definitely serve this combo again...

I didn't change a thing about this recipe and loved it! The dressing was refreshing and had just the right amount of flavor to complement the salad ingredients. The garlic and lemon go well with the kalamata olives and feta cheese.

Refreshing but the dressing could use some more flavor.

I made this recipe for a brunch. It was easy and tasted wonderful. Several people asked for the recipe. I did add red onion and oregano.

I had used Walla Walla onions and fresh oregano from my garden. This recipe was out of this world! Will definately use this recipe again and again.

excellent even better if you add chopped green pepper, red onion and some dried oregano. serve with spiced pita and a fruity white wine on a hot summer night.

I've been making this recipe now for about 2 years. The bowl in which I serve it is always left clean. Folks are always scraping the last scraps of lettuce out and licking their fingers!
