Just made this for a party tonight. I had high hopes for this recipe, but found that the end product was a bit heavy and greasy. The Thyme Gougeres recipe on this site is much better - light as a cloud, almost ethereal. I think I'll stick to that one in the future.

I made these for the second time yesterday. My 8 yr. old DD LOVES them. I don't pipe them and do them more rustic style with spoons. Also I used sharp cheddar cheese and doubled the bacon. Even leftovers are yummy. thank you!

Made these the day before and froze them on baking sheets and parchment before baking. Baked them frozen and they were great. Used double the bacon and Parmesan.

Great appetizer, not beautiful but very pleasing in a rustic way. DOUBLE the bacon. You need the flavor to balance out the sweetness of the corn. Also definitely use EXTRA SHARP cheddar rather than substituting other cheeses. You lose that yummy bite if you put in a milder cheese.

This was easy to make and very mild. I'd add more spices to liven it up next time but our guest enjoyed it very much.

This was insanely good. It's very labor-intensive, though (partially because I tripled the recipe!) so I promptly made another batch and froze it before baking so I can thaw and bake in a few weeks when the corn season is over. A superb use for fresh corn.

I tried this recipe yesterday and it came out great, everybody love the gougeres. I used 4 eggs. It is on my list of favorite recipes now :-). Thank you.

These were tasty and a big hit on Thanksgiving. I made them two days ahead, refrigerated, and heated them for 10 min. as guests arrived. They were better fresh, but everyone loved them. I will definitely make them again.

This was the quickest gougere recipe that I have ever tried. At first, I was a little skeptical (no real bechamel? no hot milk?), but in the end, it worked. I added a lot more bacon and, since I didn't have a fifth egg, added hot milk a little bit at a time until the batter reached the right consistency. Instead of small little puffs piped onto a baking sheet, I dropped larger rounded spoonfuls on the sheet. Served it as a light supper with a big green salad. Tasty.

Easy to make and very tasty. They were a hit at our Christmas Eve dinner.

I was intrigued by the rave reviews, but I thought these were just okay. Pretty tasty when warm from the oven, but rather bland after they've cooled. I could taste the bacon only a little, and the cheddar and corn not at all. I followed the recipe exactly, but I'm kind of disappointed with the result.

These were a hit at a recent dinner party. I caught one woman sneaking them from someone else's plate. (I served them along side a simple salad.) I added a dash of red pepper and did not use the Parmigian cheese-- just extra sharp white Cheddar.

Absolutely delicious fresh from the oven! I made them in advance and reheated them for a holiday buffet, but they weren't as good as fresh. I can't complain, though, they were enjoyed & devoured ahead of everything else on the table.

these were good, but a bit eggier than i expected (though i did find it necessary to use all 5 eggs). tasted like very fluffy quiche filling.

Really good. I made it as an app. before Thanksgiving dinner and it was a big hit. I will try it next with Itlian ham and provolone

I really enjoyed these gougeres. A word to the wise: make a double batch. These were such a hit that they dissapeared quickly! For a picture, view the article on my blog here: http://mangerbien.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!AA8E23CB13C5DA6A!364.trak

I was really disappointed in how these tasted AFTER freezing them. Right out of the oven they were great (though I do think they need to be a bit bigger than the recipe calls for). But after freezing them and rewarming them they tasted very leaden. They lost both flavor and the crisp exterior, soft interior. Too bad - I had hoped for a good make ahead appetizer.

these turned out great, i forgot to add the cheese so after freezing them and before reheating them i grated the cheese on top and got rave reviews.

I made these for Thanksgiving as appetizers and they were a huge hit. I am also adding them to my catering menu. They are easy to make and hold nicely as leftover snacks.

I was surprised at how tasteless these were. Actually, they were really awful. The first batch out of the oven was tossed and the remaining batter followed. Yuck!

Very tasty! I made them earlier in the week and stored them in the freezer. I reserved some in the fridge and reheated, only took 5 min, not the suggested 10. Received rave reviews from my husband and mother-in-law, definitely a new staple in my kitchen.

Very yummy! Made a week ago, baked then froze. Reheated tonight for 10 mins and they are fab. Very easy, will be a freezer staple for drop in guests for cocktails etc. Can't wait to serve them again tomorrow!

Yes! Yes! Yeeessss! Pass a bottle of dry champagne and a platter of these and--LIFE IS GOOD. I'm banking on these reheating well for Thanksgiving. I can tell you that they are flawless hot out of the oven as described!
