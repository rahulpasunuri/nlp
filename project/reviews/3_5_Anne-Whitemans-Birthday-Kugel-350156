I made this tonight using yogurt instead of sour cream and it turned out pretty good, but it was really watery. I'm not sure where all the water came from, but perhaps it was the yogurt. I didn't measure the orange and lemon zest, but I used a full lemon and orange worth, which I think is more than called for because the citrus flavor was strong. I also added slivered almonds. I'm not a big fan of kugel, but this one is slightly better than average due to the citrus flavor. I think adults with a sophisticated palate will describe it like a sweet egg mush, but kids will like it.

Made exactly as instructed (except used Honey Bunches of Oats instead of corn flakes - better texture and flavor) and there were a couple of problems with the recipe: (i) the vanilla was too strong - I'd cut it in half next time. (ii) the cooking time was too short - the custard didn't set up so it was runny when it came out - next time will try 325 instead of 350 and cook for 1 hr. Seemed like it had potential though

This is the first Kugel I ever made and everyone at pot luck loved it. I'm not sure why the recipe calls for 18 oz of dried noodles since it comes in a 16 oz bag. So I reduced ingredients to reflect less noodles. I also changed amount of cottage cheese to reflect the fact that it comes in a 2 cup container, which meant I went down to 1 ½ cups of milk instead of what was asked for. At last minute I opted out on the lemon zest, I thought, why overdue it? Let the orange be subtly present and it worked wonderfully.
