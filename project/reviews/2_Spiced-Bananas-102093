My friend gave me some small bananas from her trees and this was a good way to do something with them besides banana bread. They taste pretty good (like spiced peaches but with a more starchy texture) but I'm not sure what to serve them with! I had only 2 lbs of bananas, so I reduced the quantities accordingly -- yield: 6 cups. The instructions ARE a bit vague... I left the bananas + liquid curing out on the counter the whole time. Daily strained off the liquid into a pan, reboiled liquid and poured back onto bananas and repeated for 5 days. Then boiled all, put into jars and processed for 15 min to seal.

I haven't tried this yet, but would love to. I am starting to learn how to can. But after reading the recipe I am not sure what your suppose to do with the bowl of bananas after pouring the liquid & draining it daily. Is it stored in the refrigerator? or just keep out on the stove for a week? Are you suppose to save the liquid or make new liquid every day? How many times a day do you baste the bananas? How long do you leave the liquid on before draining?Could someone let me know so I could try this?
