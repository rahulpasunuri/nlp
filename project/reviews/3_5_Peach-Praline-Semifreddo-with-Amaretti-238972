Made this with excellent peaches for a dinner party and agree with Baltimore- the results were only okay. Good but not worth the effort ( an I regularly make fancy desserts).

I gave this recipe to guests to bring to our gourmet group at the height of our local peach season. The combination of flavors and textures is incredible and sophisticated, and everyone inhaled it and wanted more. Though the recipe is time- consuming, it can be made ahead of time, which makes it a good dinner party choice. P.S. To avoid having to mess around with crushing vitamin c tabs, just buy some Fruit Fresh in the canning section of the supermarket.

Even if my peaches had been good, I don't think I would have been impressed with this recipe at all. It was WAY too much work for incredibly lackluster results. If you feel like messing with this (and I don't recommend it--there are better things to do with peaches), I would suggest that you use only the best quality peaches.

This was quite time consuming but absolutely one of the most delicious desserts I have ever made! It perfectly captured the flavor of the fresh summer peaches I bought from a local farmer's market and received rave reviews.

Made this for a dinner party with Flamin' Fury peaches from the Green City Market. It was a huge hit; not overwhelmingly peachy; good difference in textures; and very elegant for an elegant meal. The recipe is a little fussy, but not difficult.

Wow! This was Fantastic. It had the perfect texture. I made it just as the recipe states and although I was very worried that it would be either too hard to cut or melting on the plate it came out just right. It had the body to stand up through the buffet line of desserts I had set out.
