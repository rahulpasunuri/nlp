This is so easy -- and amazing! I made it to go with grilled fish, but it also would be great with meat or as a dip for a Latin menu. People were eating it spooned from the bowl -- YUM! I think part of the reason it was so delicious is that I used jalapeno jelly from Emmy's Pickles and Preserves, a Bay Area locally sourced and organic company -- the best!! emmyspicklesandjams.com/. All their stuff is fabulous, and if you're going to take the time and go to the effort to make something, why not use the best possible ingredients? Oh, if you're going to eat this salsa directly after making it, it does have a ton of heat if you follow the recipe and add the whole jalapeno as well as the jalapeno jelly. But it does calm down after a couple of hours or over night.

This is delicious on grilled fish!!! I didn't find the need to add the jalapeno either...the jelly provides a nice zippiness on its own!!!

Loved it! Nervous about the jelly since it usually grosses me out, but it made a great foundation. Omitted the jalapeno since i didn't have it, and the jelly was spicy enough. Put it on grilled halibut, and also grilled tofu. Was a huge hit!

Delicious! Doesn't need the jelly, but I added just a couple of teaspoons of apricot jam, with a little more pepper or cayenne, instead of hot pepper jelly. The mango doesn't have to be ultra ripe. Some extra tartness is nice. I also added some diced canned peaches. I served it with pork chops seasoned with the spice rub from the Island Pork Tenderloin Salad recipe from Gourmet 03, on this site (leaving out most of the salt in that recipe --too salty for chops). Outstanding combination, and easy and fast. Half the salsa recipe is enough for a good amount with 4 pork chops.

I made this recipe as written to go with the PORK TENDERLOIN CHURRASCO recipe also on this site. Such a great combination. This salsa can be used to dress up any grilled meat or fish.

I would personally like to thank the cook from Boston from way back on 03/03/03 who suggested the best way to chop a mango. I've struggled with the slimy thing for years before reading your terrific method. Thank you!

The spicy rub w/ mango salsa is amazing on pork tenderloin too!

This was a great weeknight recipe. Fast and delicious. I didn't make the time to put in the chile pepper, but it was just fine without.

I made this to go with the pork tenderloin with the spice rub from the Island Pork Tenderloin recipe. My beloved spouse was not sure he'd like it, but he gobbled it up once he got the first taste. I've always wanted to try a mango salsa...I'm glad this is the one chosen..we loved it!!

I made this twice. The first time I didn't have any jalapeno jelly, and my I didn't use cilantro either because someone in our family can't stand it. The results were very average and I only made it again because the reviews were so good. This time I followed the recipe exactly, and what a DIFFERENCE! To save time, I used fresh sliced mango from the produce section and it was a snap to make. I'm taking it to some friends' house tonight to serve with grilled chicken. Yum!

I served this with grilled fish on a bed of spinach. Very good. I finished the balance off as a side dish. Hmm..good!

Fabulous! Really, the best fruit salsa we've had. I made it to accompany beef kabobs with the "Latin Spice" rub, but it was actually better with a nice tortilla chip! My husband doesn't like mangos, but is *addicted* to chips & salsa, so I thought I'd give it a whirl. He LOVED it and is asking when I'll make it again. The colors are gorgeous. It was best a few hours after being made. I had no jalapeno jelly, so I used some liquid from the jalapeno jar and about 2 tbsp. of Chinese duck sauce... sounds odd but the flavor was fine (it's fruit too). Yes, I am raving about this salsa. Try it.

Great sweet & spicy side dish. Went wonderfully with grilled fish!

What a colorful dish. Since I had some "non-spicy" folks at my dinner party, I used the juice from a jar of pickeled jalepenos and the green mild pepper jelly, and it worked very well. I think it's better to let the salsa "marinate" at least an hour...cuts down on the red onion taste. This recipe (and leftover beef) is wonderful on fajitas!

YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM

We started with quesadillas, followed by pork tenderloin with orange chipotle sauce, grilled carrots & zucchini, fresh refried beans. Excellent fare, to say the least. But what dish drew the most comment? This spicy mango salsa. Even my husband, who swears he hates mangos, lapped it up. Be sure your mangos are primo and don't make this too far in advance. I also added some lime zest. You should make this.

to the reader from kalamazoo- if you do it this way most of the knife cutting is done with the skin on so you won't have to handle slippery, juicy mangoes with the knife. if you cut off the end opposite the stem, look for the pit line (a mango pit runs flat not circular), this will show you which way the pit runs and slice right along the pit line on both sides (skins on). once you have the two chunks, make a tic-tac-toe board into the flesh of the mango, do not cut through the skin and push it out so it looks like a porcupine....then just scrape out...make sure to squeeze the pit so you don't lose any yummy juice!

Very yummy - depending on the sweetness of the mangos used I do add a tbl of sugar. I have also used hot mango chutney if don't have the jalapeno jelly. Both work great. Definitely a keeper.

I've made this recipe many times. The first time was as an accompaniment to the steak recipe. I set some of the salsa out as an appetizer with some blue corn chips. We almost didn't have enough to use with the steak it was such a huge hit. I've gotten all my friends hooked on Epicurious from this recipe!

This was good, although I modified it a bit--less red pepper, much less cilantro, more onion. I served it with the filet mignon as suggested. Mostly I was annoyed with how slippery and dangerous the mango seemed under the knife. Other that than, it was tasty.

A regular visitor to epicurious for many years, I have to say this is the best salsa I've ever had! We've also had it on grilled salmon - wonderful! One word of caution - it is spicy, but certainly not a mouth burner. Made this with the beef tenderloin steaks and chipotle garlic mashed potatoes. The whole dinner was a hit, but this is the recipe everyone asked for!

Love this recipe! Have made it twice; once with pork, once with beef; it was excellent! This salsa would be great with poultry & seafood as well. Almost panicked when I realized the 2nd time that I didn't have the jalapeno jelly in the pantry. Substitution of peach all-fruit mixed with green thai curry paste worked just as well!

YUM! YUM! This dish is the GREATEST!!!! I can't think of any red-meat dish I've ever had that was better than this one. The cinnamon rub sounds strange, but have no fear!

There are better fruit salsas out there. I did not like the texture and felt it was too sweet. My husband, who doesn't like mangos actually didn't mind it.

A bit too juicy to use as a chip dip, this is wonderful over grilled fish or shellfish (I used prawns). Leave out the chopped jalapeno pepper if you like; the jelly alone has enough heat for me. If you're having trouble finding Jalapeno Jelly, it's made by Knott's.

A spicy little number for those keen on adding some pep to their steak. Easy to prepare and very impressive in presentation.

Rave reviews! Very colorful. It had a bit of a bite to it- but if you like it spicy- this is it- I had a difficult time finding the hot jalepeno jelly - but substituted red hot pepper jelly- and it worked out great. Make sure mangos are ripe. Served it with swordfish- and have used it as a stand alone dip with tortilla chips. Wonderful both ways. If you can cut and measure this one's for you!
