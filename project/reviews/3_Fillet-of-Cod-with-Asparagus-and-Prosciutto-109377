Just made the cod part and it was delicious! (But if using thin fillets, as I did, reduce cooking time.)

Lovely light taste, though not sure once you get done with all that lovely butter how lite it is. I used spinach instead of asparagus since that's what I had, it didn't really feel like you had a veggie in there. Cod in general is great because it subtly picks up great flavors and the garlic butter lemon sauce is once to use on many other dishes as well.

This is good, but needs adjustments. I think next time I will double the sauce and the prosciutto needs to be added at the end beffore serving and not cooked with the fish. It was too dry and brittle and off-putting texture-wise when cooked with the fish. I substituted slices of summer squash for the asparagus and it turned out really well. I will try different vegetables with this in the future and leave the prosciutto out of the cooking process. I wonder if bacon would work well here?

Tasty recipe -- easier and quicker than it seemed at first reading. I *did* blanch the asparagus, and was glad that I did so. I doubled the garlic and used serrano ham in place of prosciutto. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written. One change I'll make next time: put the asparagus spears on top of the cured meat, rather than the other way around. This change will make the dish easier to eat, and possibly more tasty because the meat will blanket the sauce. Paired well with steamed artichokes and a torrontes wine from Argentina.

The sauce was good but the rest was just plain unappetizing! The asparagus did not need to be pre- boiled since boiling then baking resulted in overcooking. The prosciutto on top of the fish turned into an unappealing brown lump of leather-like substance which, when trying to saw through it with a steak knife caused the tender fish to crumble.

Have made this several times and found that fresh fish performs best. I've used asparagus or green beans. Cook time has been reduced to 11 min and as low as 9 min for Halibut. Hubby and I are always pleased with the outcome especially due to quick prep/cooking time. A good one for company, too, since the packets can be assembled in advance.

This is a fun recipe as diners enjoy unwrapping the parchment to unveil their evening's cuisine. The parchment paper provides for great insulation in keeping the moisture of the cod. However, I found that the prosciutto was still a bit strong and salty after baking. Finally, the cod came out a bit spongy. Perhaps it's because it was originally frozen, but perhaps from overcooking. In any case, we will enjoy repeating this simple, yet elegant recipe over time in search of its perfection. Overall, a delight to eat.

Quite yummy- though like some other reviewers, I upped the proportion of sauce-- 2 cloves of garlic, 1 T each butter and oil for half the amount of fish. I substituted fresh fiddleheads (blanched as called for) for the asparagus, and the combination of the fish, fiddleheads, and proscuitto was just right. Delicious sauce!

Overall, this recipe was fairly good. My cod fillets must have been a little thinner than most because it was overcooked, as were the asparagus. I took some pointers from previous reviews and did not blanch the asparagus before hand, thank goodness. I added some white wine as well as extra lemon and garlic, which ended up being just enough for the 4 packets I made. The flavor was nice and clean, which I like with fish. The prosciutto didn't bring anything great to the dish, so next time I will omit that. My partner thought it was lovely, so I'll tweak it and give it a few more tries.

Cod and asparagus were on sale at the grocery store last night so we decided to give this recipe a try. So quick and tasty and such a unique presentation! After reading other reviews saying the dish "lacked something" I decided to make a few additions/changes. I doubled the garlic, butter, lemon peel, and S&P, cut back a little on the lemon juice and added some dry white wine, a large chopped shallot and a pinch of red pepper flakes. I also allowed the mixture to simmer a little longer than called for to allow it to reduce slightly. I added some chopped portobello mushrooms into the packets to make the dish a little more substantial and I topped the finished dishes with some chopped fresh Italian parsley. Also, I would recommend serving with some crusty bread to sop up all of the yummy lemon butter sauce. Delicious!!

Very good! I didn't pre boil the asparagus and found that it came out just right.

very good, low fat, low caloried and healthy. Could have done without the prosciutto; we use smart balance instead of butter. Great way to cook fish, glad that I found this recipe cause I will once again do more fish this way.

This was so easy and so good! I didn't cook the asparagus ahead of time - it was done perfectly just cooking in the oven with the fish. I increased the cooking time to 15 minutes and it was perfect. I also added mushrooms (sliced) and artichoke hearts (1/4 can per parchment) for a little more flavor. A wonderful meal for guests! Easy and looks like you did more!

Made this without the prosciutto--as I was just looking for a method. And, yes, I will certainly make it again! Next time, I will not precook the asparagus as it was woefully overdone, though it may have been the fault of not letting it cool down to coldness after par-boiling.

This was very yummy and very easy!!! Great for a party!! Cod is a very mild fish so it would please non-fish eaters.

Somehow the fish was way overcooked. The asparagus turned out great. The prosciutto didn't add anything to the dish. Next time, I will use dill and lemon instead and watch the cooking time carefully.

I use this recipe to teach techniques for cooking fish (i.e. en papillote). My students marvel at the effort vs. effect. Personally, I make this dish throughout year, even in winter when I need a bit of Spring cheer at the dinner table. The presentation is fabulous, you can try any number of ingredients - try adding chopped artichoke hearts to this basic recipe to add more depth. Great paired with black Forbidden Rice for a stunning display of color on the plate. Pair with a Semillion/ Sauvignon Blanc. The cook time needs to be bumped to about 15 minutes for cooking at altitude. blend for a real punch!

Love this recipe. I have made it with cod in the past - this time, I used fresh sea scallops. I wrapped each scallop in a ribbon of prosciutto, and added shitake mushrooms and shallots to the sauce. The baking time was approximately the same ~12 minutes for the scallops.

This recipe is wonderful and easily amended to include your favorites. We added portobello mushroom slices and chopped fresh basil. Our only challenge: not being able to tell if the fish was cooked after 12 min. A chef pal recommends making one serving extra when making anything in parchment so to use as a "tester". This is the perfect dinner party dish as you can make the pouches well ahead of time. Serve with crusty bread to sop up the yummy broth.

Really easy to make and fun presentation. quite tasty. My girlfriend was very impressed, i used the for 6 ingredients (except fish) to make just 4. i think it made it extra tasty.

the flavors combined just right. There's a hint of lemon, artichoke, and prosciutto in the juices of the fish. The wrapping trick was also pretty neat.

I cut down this recipe for 2 and added one mashed anchovy filet, slightly rinsed, to the garlic mixture after cooking it. I also added about a tbsp. of drained capers. I left the asparagus uncooked but peeled the stems and reduced the cooking time to 11 mins. I think all of these were great alterations. I accompanied with parmesan mashed potatoes a great pairing.

I have sampled many epicurious recipes and this was a relative disappointment. I also found the asparagus overcooked even though I did not pre-cook. Overall this just cries out for something to jazz it up a bit.

Excellent dish, goes with all sort of sides and all seasons. Made it with Tilapia, Wahoo, Mahi-Mahi, Cod of course and salmon with modifications.

I was really disappointed with this recipe. I had fish straight from the pier, and it seemed sort of ruined by the pouch of liquid it was sitting in by the time it came out of the oven. I removed the fish from the pouch to serve it, but the liquid/soupiness made the fish itself start to fall apart. The asparagus was really limp - definitely doesn't need to be precooked - but maybe I like it a little on the underdone side.

We have made made this three times now - this is perfect for company, since it's elegant and quite impressive-looking, but much simpler than it looks and not at all time-consuming! The only difficult part is checking to see if the fish is done without disturbing the packets too much. It actually turned out better with the hake we used the first time when cod was not available. You need the freshest fish possible, since the whole point of this recipe is to enjoy the pure flavours of the ingredients as they come together without a lot of other flavours interfering. The recipe needs quite a bit more butter and lemon than called for, and we doubled the garlic but other than that it's a terrific one.

Made this for a friend of mine who is a chef at the Ritz. We simplified the recipe even further, put all the elements together in the parchment and cook. Works great - cuts out prep time for asparagas and adds that flavor into the dish. Amazing!

My friends and I love this recipe. We used sea bass and it was divine - very light & fluffy. I used the prosciutto the first time, but have since left it out. We served it with potatoes gratin which was a perfect combo.

The dish turned out very well, I used Halibut and added portabello mushrooms to packet.

A quick easy dish, however, I would agree not to cook the asparagus ahead of time as it turn out soft and limp. I did add more garlic and lemon with a touch of pepper flakes.

Fabulous, I used halibut, doubled the garlic, increased the lemon peel, and only cooked the asparagus for 1 minute.

I think this recipe has a lot of potential. I added some shallots and red bell pepper for color, but it still lacked something. The prosciutto didn't seem to add a lot of flavor for me. Perhaps using pancetta would help. The fish came out moist and perfect, but it needs something else to make it a 3 to 4 fork recipe. Trouble is, I don't know what that is.

A very good recipe. I used halibut and it was quite perfect. I would increase the seasoning (lemon/garlic mix) as it could have used some boost. Will definatley make it again as it looks impressive in the parchment and it is a nice break from grilling.

Was great, I used Mexican Sea Bass instead. Also used more garlic & proscuitto than listed.

Very easy to make, though I used aluminum foil rather than parchment paper. The prosciutto imparted a lot of flavor to the fish but I didn't feel that there was enough seasoning.

3/3 thumbs up from my crew. I am not an asparagus fan so I used brocoli instead with great results. The liquid in the packet made a great sauce but possibly because I divided much of the full amount for 3 instead of 6 portions. Followed the picture to learn a great short-cut to making the en papillote pacels: a stapler with staple placement at the corners! Thanks to the editors for the great idea and time saver.

To Montreal: The 1 Tblsp was for sauteeing the garlic mixture. The 6 tsp was for the actual fish packettes (1 tspoon apiece).

We made it only for two (am I the only one who thought it ridiculous to say "one tbsp and six tsp" rather than simply three tbsp of oil?), using cod. The parchment was hard to remove afterward. But it was fast and easy to make and for that account, it was remarkable. We had it with simple scallop potatoes and white wine.

This was so good - I don't know what others were talking about. There was a lot of liquid in the parchment pockets but we simply drained them or took out the fish before eating. I don't believe the fish was meant to be eaten with the sauce anyways since it was so juicy. My guests absolutely loved it. I served it with baby greens and ciabatta bread. Wonderful flavor.

This dish was not at all pleasing to the eye. The sauce was soupy, asparagus was over done and I don't think proscciutto is a good mix. Would never make it again.

Definitely NOT the best use of these ingredients. Perhaps cod is not the most perfect selection for this recipe because the result was a soupy steamed pile of fish. I've cooked in parchment for years and I have never experienced these poor results. Nice flavor, although a bit salty.

I used Seabass as Cod was unavailable at the time. Simply amazing! Accompanied by risotto with fresh peas and parmesan, my guests loved it. So easy too.

This is a really nice dish. The fish is light and the asparagus was delicious. We used half the fish but still used the same amount of garlic and lemon. Great results. Will make again.
