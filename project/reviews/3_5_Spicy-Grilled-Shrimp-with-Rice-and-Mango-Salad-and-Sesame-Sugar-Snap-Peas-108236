I made this last night and it was a smash hit! The shrimp were fabulous and flavorful. The rice salad was simple and all the flavors on the plate worked together nicely. This was the first time I'd made snap peas and even my veggie heating father loved them. This is going to be a staple at my house now.

Delicious! Added soy sauce to the peas as previously suggested, doubled the ginger and chilie flakes. Kids loved it. It will become a staple in out house.

BORING! The rice salad was OK - nothing special - a bit tart. the shrimp were NOT spicy. quite bland actually. This recipe would need adjustment before I would make it again. I'd have to add garlic to the shrimp, cilantro to the rice, maybe some macadamia nuts too. Overall, this won't be seeing plates at our house any time soon.

Made just the rice salad w/peas and found the measurements to be perfect....so tasty! Put hot chili toasted sesame oil instead of regular for a kick; a hit!

Very good combination of flavors for the shrimp and the mango rice. Broiled the shrimp for 6 minutes and was perfect. Used basmati but will try brown rice, and a splash of soy in the peas, next time.

Rating: 4
Excellent, light meal with great flavor. The rice is great with the shrimp as written. After reading other reviews, I tweaked the snap peas and added a dash of soy for more flavor. I've also made it with fresh scallops (making sure not to over marinate). Highly recommended.

I made this exactly what the recipe said. I love the mango and rice salad, a little different but good combination though. The shrimp has a good taste and a kick to it! Would probably make it again.

This recipe is a real keeper. I am a grad student and am always entertaining on a budget - this fits perfectly. I easily doubled it to feed a crowd and everyone liked it so much they all asked for the recipe!

I have made this dish many times. The brown rice with mango is delicious and different. Folks are very impressed with the combination. You can also add spicy asian oil to any part of this dish for a bit of heat. Easy to make and eveyone loves it!

This is a standard in our house. I can't believe I've never rated it-- I've been making it for 4 years now. I add an extra mango to the salad and tweak the liquids to be to our liking but otherwise make it as it. Wonderful.

I didnt quite make the recipe as shown - but my changes were delicious! First, I used orzo instead of brown rice - in general, I like pasta better and orzo was perfect for this. I suggest adding a fair amount of kosher salt to the peas as it makes a big different. Lastly, I added red onion, pineapple, and green pepper to the kabobs and instead of using vegetable oil in the marinade, I used pineapple juice, soy sauce, honey, lime and lemon juice, and chopped jalapenos for spice - heat to reduce by half and after marinading, brush on kabobs. Enjoy!

Very easy to make. I have subbed fresh pineapple in place of the mango and it's still wonderful. Let the shrimp marinate for as long as possible, the longer the better flavor they have. The rice is very light and refreshing. I'd omitted the peas most of the time that I've made this and they really aren't missed.

Unable to follow any recipe to the T, and had already prepared a mango salsa (w/red onions, lime juice, jalepeno & cilantro) so folded the salsa into the rice with the soy, ginger & red pepper flakes..and a smidge of EVO. Marinated the shrimp but added some minced garlic, & let go for 4 hrs. Sauteed instead of grilling...it was too hot...next time I'll peel the shrimp (they were split and that was good enough to get the flavors to the meat). I think the cilantro really enhanced the dish...will try adding toasted sesame next time instead (didn't make the peas...salad).

I made this as a celebration dinner last night -- so easy and fresh. I don't know if I would use the short grain brown rice again, I might substitute bulgur, but I liked the nutty flavor that it brought to the meal. Also, people that have mentioned the peas being bland....the one change I did make was to toast the sesame seeds and I added a pinch of salt when I tossed the peas, seeds and sesame oil. Great flavor combinations!

This is great! My husband, who can be a very picky and critical eater, really liked it. I used two mangos and white rice in the rice salad, which can stand on its own as a side dish. I also added some fresh garlic to the shrimp marinade. Wonderful make-ahead party fare!

This was a nice, relatively easy summer meal. I sauteed the shrimp as well and served with corn on the cob. The pea salad was the only disaapointing part...a bit bland.

Rating: 0
I didn't rate this because I believe I made too many substitutions. I'll describe so none of you make the same mistake. Dried apricots (cooked with the rice) instead of mango doesn't work, esp. along with edamame beans for the snap peas. I'm trying to clean out the cupboards/fridge for a move and don't want to buy too many new ingredients. Don't follow my substitutions in this case. Edible, although I'm looking for an excuse not to eat the leftovers.

I agree with the reviewer who said it reminded them of spa cuisine. I made this for a recent dinner with friends and everyone liked it...but my husband was the only one who LOVED it. It is a very nice presentaion, however. Don't be cheap on the shrimp -- make sure they're jumbo.

I really like this recipe. It's so easy to make and very delicious. I don't have a grill, so I skewered and broiled the shrimp for about 6 minutes. The sesame sugar snap peas are especially great.

What a refreshing meal on a hot day!! I also sauteed the shrimp with great results. The only thing I changed was to use sesame oil in the rice salad instead of vegetable oil. The leftovers are waiting for me today....YUM!

I made this salad last weekend (Memorial Day) for a dear friend who was visiting me and we both enjoyed it very much - wonderful mingling of flavors! However, I wasn't crazy about the consistency of the brown rice...too dry for my taste. Even though I'd make it again just as before, I'm glad I found your reader's comments today...next time I will definitely try one of the other rices recommended. Btw, and I didn't see anyone else comment on this, I made the full recipe even though there were only two of us, and the "leftovers" for the last two days have been great - it holds up wonderfully!

The rice was the best part of this dish. The sweet and salty combination was great. I wasn't so hot on the snap peas, a little blah. A very easy dish to make.

I tried following another's advice and substituted goya rice for the brown rice. An excellent idea! The mango rice came out delicious! I also added chinese 5-spice to the shrimp marinade for a bit more flavor. Nice spring-summer dish.

Delicious! I added chopped papaya and pineapple to the rice in addition to the mango. I started by putting a small amount of mache (a small leaf lettuce) on the plate, then adding the rice mixture, then the shrimp - I put the snap peas around the edge. I also sliced avocado on top and garnished with cilantro. Didn't feel like grilling, so cooked the shrimp in a saute pan, and they turned out great. Yum!

I thought this dish was delicious! Many reviewers were not thrilled with the rice which I thought was really good. I used purple sticky rice that I get at whole foods and it was great with the mango, onions and sauce. Yum! The shrimp was really good too. I will definately be making this one again.

A huge hit with my inlaws! It's a good thing I'm a vegetarian, because my father-in-law had no problem eating my share of the shrimp. I thought the rice was nice - it wasn't incredibly flavorful as some other reviewers noted, but the mango was unusual and enjoyable.

Fantastic! Everyone loves this recipe. For the rice, I use Goya spanish rice, because there is more flavor.

This recipe is tough to rate in that LOVED the shrimp put was underwhelmed by the rice. It's a keeper for the shrimp portion only, altho I would add a bit more red pepper and some of the lime juice to the shrimp marinade.

To Cook from Hong Kong, I find most of my ingredients at Wellcome or Park N Shop, but for some specialty ingredients I go to GREAT or Olivers. I tested this recipe tonight for a dinner party tomorrow. It was very nice and summery. I will make it tomorrow. I did not put the oil in the rice and it was plenty moist. I also put a small box of raisens in the rice because my mango was a little sour. I used a very short grain rice called Kalijira. It cooks in 10 minutes is similar in taste to basmati, but very tiny

I made this recipe for my husband and myself and we both loved it! The following week I made it for our neighborhood crowd! What a hit!! I tripled the shrimp part. I have never seen some of our friends eat so much shrimp. I have been asked the recipe by all of them. In the shrimp marinade, I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. This one is a keeper. We grilled the shrimp on the barbecue without skewers. A great recipe for a hot day!

I tried scallops as well as shrimp, but the shrimp were much better. Followed up with a cherry/chocolate ice cream cake, which nicely cooled off all the spice. This recipie has the perfect amount of spice in it, not so much as to make you burn your mouth, but enough to be full in flavor, and the mango is a perfect way to cool it off.

My guest and I really enjoyed this dish. It was so easy to make and looked incredible. The only thing I changed in the recipe was the snap peas. The selection in the supermarket was poor, so I changed the vegetable to fresh string beans. The dish feed three adult women. It is a great dish for a summer lunch. I am making it again tomorrow.

This recipe made an easy dinner on a lazy Sunday. After reading the other comments, I made the following changes: I doubled the rice, I used 1 jar of mango spears from the produce cold case (my produce section mangos were looking nasty), I doubled the ginger, I doubled the pepper flakes, I used sesame oil anywhere they called for vegetable oil, and I upped the servings of shrimp per person. It fed three adults - 2 of my eaters were big 6 foot plus dudes. I arranged the rice salad in the center of each person's plate, put the peas around the side (like sun rays), the shrimp off the skewers on top of the salad and sprinkled the whole thing with sesame seeds. The guys said it looked and tasted like something at a really nice restaurant. 3 thumbs up! :)

I really liked this recipe for the fact that it is DIFFERENT than the usual meat, starch, veggies served seperately in a meal. I loved the flavor combo, especially the sesame peapods. I only marinated the shrimp for 20 minutes, next time I would do longer.

Rating: 2
I hate to be critical when the finished dish looked so incredible, but I wasn't overwhelmed by the taste. The shrimp were nice and spicy, but didn't really pick up a lot of the ginger flavour, and the mango (it was ripe!) didn't seem to be quite enough to offset the sour lime/soya flavor of the rice. I also thought the amount of rice wasn't quite enough to serve 4 as a main, although, we may have felt differently if we had had starters. So, I loved the presentation and ease of preparation, but I probably won't make it again.

Rating: 3
This was an easy and delicious complete dinner. I used twice as much ginger and pepper for the shrimp, and next time I'd let it marinade for longer. Also, next time I'd make less rice because we had lots left over. The mango in the rice was a great combination! I liked all of the color and taste combinations... unique! I'd definitely make it again.

We loved the colors, textures and tastes of this meal! It makes a beautiful presentation and the flavors are perfect together. I toasted the sesame seeds as well, which realy enhanced the flavor. Plus, we bought the shrimp and the mangos fresh from the local farmers' market that morning! Perfectly ripe mangoes are key. A definitely lovely summer meal, pairs well with a light chardonnay, pinot gris or sauvignon blanc.

This was amazing-the combination of flavors was incredible-it was so nice to have everything made ahead of time other than the shrimp. Such a wonderful summertime dish-can't wait to make it again, added a little more hot pepper flakes but other than that-followed the recipe. Hats off to Bon Appetit- a spectacular dish.

Easy and delicious. I doubled the ginger in the shrimp marinade. Basmati brown rice cooked in chicken broth made the rice salad savory, and lightly toasting the sesame seeds worked, too. Very yummy recipe.

We halved the number of shrimp and alternated them with chunks of sirloin steak on the skewers. It was excellent, and we plan to serve this next time we have company for dinner. I used white rice and a bit more oil than called for. Next time I'll cut back a little on the soy sauce. This is best when the mangoes are very ripe and sweet.

Loved this recipe, as did my gourmet cook friends. I didn't have enough jumbo shrimp so I used some smaller shrimp with it. The smaller shrimp absorbed more flavor from the marinade and had more flavor than the jumbo shrimp. I broiled the shrimp. Delicious. Used 2 mangos and Basmati light brown rice. Excellent summer meal.

We loved it. I used snow peas cut diagonally into pieces instead of sugar peas, and tossed in a few drops of Mongolian Fire Oil into the mango-ginger mix. I used 2 mangos instead of one and basmati rice. It was so good I called the neighbors to come try it! It will be a summer favorite from now on.

This is a delicious and versatile recipe. I served this hot as a main course last evening to guests to rave reviews. The rice and mango salad sparkles and can easily be used alone with other dishes.

I will add this recipe to my permanent collection and look forward to making it again as a summer salad or first course.

I make shrimp many ways and this dish is very good. But down here--4 shrimp is just a tease--I added more shrimp and snow peas and this fed 6 quite nicely. BTW-cook from Buena Park--many island cultures include fruit in all sorts of recipes and those people are far healthier than most of us!
