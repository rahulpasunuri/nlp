I had high hopes for this dish, until I tasted it. So, I omitted the oyster sauce because I am vegetarian and don't eat fish. I think maybe the extra tablespoon of something (i.e., oyster sauce) is necessary to cut the spice of the chili paste, because (I like spicy foods, but) this was WAY too spicy. If you are omitting the oyster sauce as I did, I would recommend either using 1/2 tbsp of chili PASTE with garlic or 1 tbsp of chili SAUCE with garlic.

A little more salt (soy sauce) and a little less sugar (hoi sin) made this an excellent dish.

I only used 1/2 tbs of chili paste and it still had plenty of kick for my taste. Chopped walnuts add a nice extra level of texture to this flavorful dish.

Yuck-a-tooey! The spicey taste was okay, but the meal was completely unsatisfying, and the eggplant should probably be pressed as it didn't sit well in the lettuce. Circular file for this one.

Try using vegetarian "oyster" sauce (made from a mushroom base) and shiitake mushrooms to match - easy, tasty and actually vegetarian!

This recipe would be 4 forks with the table-side sauce they mix at PF Chang's. I just mixed half lite soy sauce with chili paste and served with cilantro sprigs, green onion and red bell pepper. We love spicy so it was great with the sauce. Next time I'll try the maifun noodles (seem like styrofoam) they serve there too.

Very good, and quite hearty for a vegetable dish (not vegetarian b/c of the oyster sauce, as another reviewer has noted). The spiciness was just right for me and my husband. My supermarket didn't have jicama, so I sauteed some ramen noodles in butter and added them for a little more crunch (not healthy, but very tasty).

Call me a purist, but oyster sauce is made from oysters, which are NOT vegetarian! Epicurious should stop calling recipes with fish or oyster sauce vegetarian.

I love spicy foods, but this was too much. The chili paste overwhelmed this dish to the point where I couldn't taste the dish, I could only feel it burning my mouth!

This was very flavorful and easy to prepare. I served it with rice and soy sauce for dinner. But it would make a great cocktail party appetizer as well.

Received rave reviews with this recipe. I will agree with previous reviewers that this recipe is extremely spicy. Would definitely recommend it!

This is a great vegetarian recipe. It is very easy and fast to make. It is very spicy!! I would cut back a little bit on the chili paste but my husband loves spicy food so he thought it was perfect.

Also excellent with Chicken! Use a little fresh cilantro as a garnish.
