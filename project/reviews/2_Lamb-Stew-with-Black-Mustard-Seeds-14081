I used some yellow chiles which were advertised as flavorful but with mild heat instead of the red cherry peppers because of availability. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. My resulting stew was flavorless, which is amazing considering how many peppers went into it! Would not make again.

i didn't know if i would like this recipe, on paper it seemed a little too spicy, but i'm daring. I made a few changes but basicly it's the same and very good. it calls for cherry peppers, which i didn't have on hand so i just used 3 small jalapenos and one large anaheim pepper and i added i small can of whole stewed tomatoes with the water to give it a little body. i also added a couple of carrots and potatoes for good measure. its a real good stew and a great one pot meal.
