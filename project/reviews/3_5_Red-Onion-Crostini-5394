These disappear so fast. Easy to make ahead. I use more pancetta (6 oz. pkg.). Also fine with shallot instead of garlic (for a friend who can't tolerate garlic). If you have extra of the red onion mix, it is a wonderful spread for a ciabatta sandwich with rare roast beef or smoked turkey.

Made this for our supper club. My turn for appetisers. Everyone ate so much they were not hungry for the main course. To save time I purchased toasted bread rounds from a gourmet market.

I served this on thick Italian bread 2"x3" as appetizers for 20 (with two other kinds of crostini) and they were very popular. I did have about twice as much as I needed though.

Excellent flavor and relatively simple to make and can be made in advance so it's perfect for entertaining. Our guests loved it!

I cooked the onions longer before covering, and added a teaspoon of sugar to maximize the caramelization. It was a big hit!

Very good blend of flavors. I used on small baquettes and should use larger, more dense bread

I used Vadalia onions and it was a great hit. Its also good with the red onions, easy, can be served hot or room temperature. My friends are fussy - and always love this recipe.

I don't know what happened to the other NY cook but I've made this recipe several times for different people with rave reviews and encore requests. I'm making it again this weekend. Excellent flavors and easy to make.

No way. This didn't even make it for a trial run. I tasted it and threw it out. Very disappointed.
