This recipe is excellent!! I freeze my bowl with the flour and then toss the grated butter in and re-freeze before adding the water. I usually give it a book fold and re-chill the dough before rolling out. The results are amazing, it puffs into flaky layers almost like cross between puff pastry and a perfectly made pate brisee. I much prefer this to the vodka pastry dough at ATK!!

This recipe makes a beautiful and delicious crust. That said, it is really a pain to make. Grating the butter is hazardous (I'll spare you the description of the knuckle on my thumb), but it does make for a perfect distribution of fat through the crust. I would only make again for something really special.

I've struggled with crust over the years. This is now my standard pie crust. It's easy, almost foolproof, and delicious.
