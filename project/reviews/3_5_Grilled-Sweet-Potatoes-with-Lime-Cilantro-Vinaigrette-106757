This recipe was amazing. I loved the flavors together. I used an inside grill pan which was very easy.

The key here is to get the edges of the potatoes BLACK. Yup, burn em. The charred sugar and combined with the tart lime and cilantro is great. One of my new favorites. You can shortcut by skinning and broiling, but be sure to get the black bits!

This was excellent! The combination of lime and cilantro on the sweet potato was an excellent taste! You really cannot substitute parsley (as soon have suggested) and this dish be as good.... I made a plate of these and they were gone within seconds... I will make this again and again!!!

I used parsley instead of cilantro and roasted for convenience. We really enjoyed it; I might cut back on the oil a little the next time around.

Can you do a review before you make the recipe (and really shake people up?) I can't wait to try this one! I love cilantro, lime, sweet potatoes, and an "edgy" combination! Since I love collaboration too, I'm going to incorporate some of your terrific ideas (to my twist:)To me, that's what it's about. Share, stretch and if it flops, so what?

I did a massive shortcut and did not pre-boil or peel the potatoes, just cut them and then 15 min. in oven and finished browning on the grill (due to space issues on grill). The lime cilantro vin. is amazing. perfect companion to the sweet potatoes. heaven.

I have made this recipe dozens of times; it's a family favorite. I peel and slice the potatoes before boiling, and cook them only about 5 minutes, depending on size, till just barely tender. Overcooking is the real danger. Into the vinaigrette while hot; they hold till it's time to finish them on the grill. Only thing I sometimes add is a touch of cayenne to the vinaigrette. Delicious and colorful.

The lime and cilantro completely overpowered the sweet potatoes. I also just don't think the flavors go well together. Plus, the sweet potatoes were way too soft to grill after boiling for 25 minutes, so I simply tossed them in the vinaigrette afterward rather than taking the extra step of grilling. I was pretty disappointed.

I love sweet potatoes and seek out recipes that play down the sweetness rather than increase it. This is a delicious and easy way to add them to your menu alongside whatever else you are grilling. Why wait until Thanksgiving? These are are great with grilled pork chops or steaks in the summer.

Made this for a quick weeknight dinner - and it was fabulous. Didn't have any cilantro on hand, so I used fresh basil! Very good: light and refreshing! Just make sure to cook the potatoes enough - either in the pot or on the grill.

I must have done something wrong. I found the lime/cilantro mixture to be overpowering. We could not eat these and had to throw them out.

Be VERY watchful when simmering the sweet potatoes. I followed the instructions and cooked the whole potatoes for 25 minutes, put them into cold water immediately, but, as I feared when I first read the recipe, they were too soft to be able to grill. I instead tossed them, minus grilling and cut into one inch pieces, with the vinaigrette and called it a sweet potato salad . Next time I will cook them a shorter time and test them more frequently.

Tasty dish, but the sweet potatoes took longer to cook than anticipated. The failure of the dressing to mix properly is not a problem as long as you shake it up well right before drizzling it on the potatoes.

Ok I'll admit that I didn't go through the process of boiling because of a late night at work. If you are in a hurry and can't boil they turn out great under the broiler oven. Cook 10-15 min each side. I'd love to try them the "original way" on a night that is not as busy.

While I love sweet potatoes on the grill this dish left me wanting. I recommend instead trying Epicurious's Sweet Potato Salad http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/14174 Which is amazing and a similar amount of effort.

I thought this recipe was delicious. To the previous reviewer- these are not "fries". These are grilled potatoes. They aren't really supposed to be crispy. Anyway, they are yummy- give them a try- nice way to get beta-carotene.

I had a really hard time with this recipe. We were having a BBQ and cooked the fries on the grill but they never got that crispy. And then putting the oil on them just made them even more soggy.

Served this with Jerk Pork from this site- wonderful. Previeous reviewers are right, overcooking the potatoes will make it difficult on the grill. I used a mixture of yams and sweet potatoes. We are cilantro heads, so i added extra, very tastey.

This was absolutely awesome. The contrast of the sweet potatoes with the salty and sour dressing, all at the same time...overload! I agree that you can't overcook the potatoes or it becomes a mess. Better to cook on the shorter side.

These were a great side dish to BBQ pork chops. Will definately make them again. I agree that these would probably be a chore if overcooked prior to grilling - but they turned out just fine using a vegetable grill basket.

Nothing special. There are definately better sweet potato recipes. The advice of earlier reviews to cook the potatoes for only about 10 minutes worked well.

Considering this was the first time I have ever grilled, I found this recipe fail proof. I did follow some people's concerns of the potato falling apart on the grill by resoliving the issue with keeping the skins on. The potato was excellent. I did not care for the vinaigrette (and love vinaigrettes and cilantro). I felt it was a little bitter at times. You must keep the ingredients shaken up to prevent the bitterness. The guests I cooked it for thought is outstanding and one of them promply contacted her mother to share the recipe. Who's to say if my opinion is the correct one. :)

I may try this again and do something different. Maybe a little less lime? Something about it being just a little too acidic. I baked mine. Maybe that was the problem. I really wanted to love it, but it just didn't hit a home run here.

My guests and I just loved this grilled vegetable dish. Easy to make, and mine looked just like the picture! Be sure your potatoes are cooked through from the boiling process; I thought maybe I had overcooked them, but the well cooked ones were best whereas I had one undercooked that was a little crunchy and hard in one spot. So watch for that. This was quite a fantastic dish, easy to prepare ahead too.

I used a ridged grill pan to put the marks on the sweet potato quarters, spraying them with olive oil and sprinkling with a little salt. If you use this method, be sure to use your kitchen fan; in order for the potatoes to get the right taste and look, the pan smokes a little. Also, they were done the right amount after 20 min of simmering; I think they would have been mushy if cooked more.The dressing is yummy!

I've made this before with excellent results. I'm forever looking for sweet potato recipes that do NOT call for sugar (why did addition of sugar ever happen when they have such a lovely flavor without sweet additions?). Being also a great fan of cilantro, this combination truly worked well for me and my guests - this will be a repeat addition.

I thought this recipe was wonderful! The vinaigrette was fabu and would go well with anything! I microwaved the whole, unpeeled sweet potatoes for about 5 min & then cut into wedges after they cooled, sprayed with olive oil and grilled them. I also grilled lots of other veggies like onions, peppers, asparagus, mushrooms and used the dressing on those also! YUMMY!! Served with ginger-citrus marinated & grilled salmon for a deliciously healthy dinner with "the girls"! Everyone raved about all the fab flavors! I'll definitely make this recipe again and again!!!

Wonderful, easy and very tasty. A great summertime side-dish. You really have to be careful not to overboil the potatoes, or they become difficult to manage on the grill. But the BBQ is more about visual appeal (for the grill marks) in my view, and the dish would still be quite tasty without it. Served this to great reviews from both family and guests.

This was pretty good, although it paled in comparison to the rest of my dinner. It's also hard to time the potatoes on the grill. Next time I think I will do them in the oven. The lime/cilantro vinegrette was awesome. My guests lapped that up with a rustico bread! Will definitely make that again and again.

I first made this recipe as it appeared in EPICURIOUS and it was good. I then made it by cutting up the microwaved and unpeeled sweet potatoes into chucks and grilling them in a grill basket on the gas grill, just as good. A good entree for this would be a pork tenderloin that has been koshered and then rubbed with Asian spices and grilled. Pork tenderloin was from a recipe in COOKS ILLUSTRATED from a year or two ago. Served the potatoes and tenderloin with spinach cooked in chicken broth and sesame seeds.

I have made this dish dozens of times. After the time or two, I skipped the pre-cooking and cooked the potatoes on the grill, cutting them into wedges and brushing them with oil to prevent sticking. Good and easy. Sweet potatoes are also fantastic prepared this way with the spiced oil from the Roasted Spiced Sweet Potatoes recipe also on this site.

Ok, I haven't actually made this recipe yet, but I have a comment. For those of you who have complained about the potatoes sticking to the grill, here's what I've done: Buy one of those disposable tin foil pans, coat your potatoes with the marinade (discard excess if you have to) and place the pan on the top rack of the grill. I've actually put the potatoes in raw and grilled them longer. It worked great. Leave the skins on too.

Rating: 3
I agree with the reviewer who nuked the potatoes instead of boiling them. You'll save time and get the same results. I also suggest keeping the peels on for added texture (and nutrients). I made these for 2 bbq's and they received rave reviews! Was a great, tasty, easy-to-eat healthy dish, and an original break from the typical bbq food.

Adds a pleasant and unusual taste to "plain" sweet potatoes. We overcooked the potatoes a little, so they were a bit soft to grill, but even so, the taste was delicious! Especially nice in summer with all that lime. Might add even more next time.

We liked very much - I too kept skins on, scrubbed well, then sliced and nuked for 6-8 minutes. They do need watching on the grill. We basted with some of the marinade, drizzled the rest on after cooking. Albequerque - TELL your roomate you don't like cilantro BEFORE s/he starts cooking - or skip the dish!!

Okay, first off...I didn't opt to make this. My roommate did. What a disaster!!!! I wish I could rate is ZERO forks. Apart from so much cilantro in the vinaigrette as to make the whole lot taste like dish soap, (I *dispise* cilantro) we now have sweet potato charred to our grill than no amount of scrubbing will take off. What a waste of good sweet potatoes. Ugh.

Here is a faster, easier way to grill sweet potatoes. Peel them. Slice into 1/2 inch discs. paint both side with vinigarette. Place on grill close to coals but not over them. Turn after fifteen minutes. Cook for another fidteen minutes. Done.

Ok, so I have not tried this exact recipe, but I have grilled sweet potatoes. Save time by peeling and cutting the potatoes first and then microwave them. Its faster and you don't have to worry about burning your hands trying to peel the cooked potatoes.
