I've made these twice. First with the soprasetta. Second witout soprasetta. I increased the crumbs and cheese instead. Great for vegetarians. I simply love this recipe. Its amazing and filling. Leftovers work well too. Just steam it for about 10 - 15 mins and stuff your face with it! Yummy. I am waiting for the really good fresh artichokes to come to the stores/grocers and I will be making this to welcome spring.

Love artichokes - been eating them for 50 years & this is by far the worst preparation I've ever tasted. I should have been suspicious of any recipe that relies so heavily on oil for its flavor - 2000 calories of olive oil in this! And this doesn't add in the fat calories in the soppressata & the cheese. The recipe isn't porportioned right either. There are simply too many bread crumbs for the flavor points. Also, the lemons in the broth left a nasty bitter taste. Husband said at end of dinner, "I hope you didn't go to too much trouble on these because you wasted your time & two artichokes!" I agree. Not a keeper!

This was my first attempt at making artichokes, and my first time eating more than just the hearts. Followed recipe pretty closely, except I used canned breadcrumbs and omitted the sopressata bcs I didn't want the dish to be too heavy. Both me and my guy agreed the sopressata would have tasted great in there though. Cooked in regular pot and they were fine; tender and flavorful. Couldn't figure out how to get all the fuzzies out. Maybe I wasn't being rough enough in scooping? I'm none to familiar with artichoke anatomy! I would still definitely try again.

These Turned out to die for!!! I was just in the mood to try something new, and remember haveing them when i was little. If i were to do it over again i would use pre done bread crumbs...although the baguette that i used was delicious! I also used prosotto instead of the sausage on accident, but that was still really good! Everyone was asking what i was cooking, the aroma was sooo yummy!And there was not one complaint... even the pups that we have wouldn't leave us alone! :) i will def do this again!!

I made this a few nights a go with some adjustments and OH MY, how yummy this was but definately time consuming so make sure you buy giant artichokes to make the scooping easier. I used some mild italian sausage instead of the soppressata and used Trader Joe's 4 cheese blend and didn't bother with the melting the provelone over the chokes. And the best part: I added white wine to the cooking liquid and used thick slices of onions to keep the 'chokes of the bottom of the pot and steamed for around 50-60 min (big chokes). While the chokes cooled, I reduced the simmering broth and then added it to some melted butter to make the MOST INCREDIBLE dipping sauce for the leaves. This is one of the most incredible meals I've ever made. I used really big chokes and stuffed them chock full, none of this two tablespoon stuff, there was nearly a cup in each one! My non-artichoke eating husband kept coming into the kitchen wanting to know what smelled so good and was thirlled with his dinner.

This was my first go with whole artichokes.. and after trying this recipe.. I can't believe what I've been missing out on! My boyfriend and I tried this recipe for dinner last night and woke up this morning still talking about it. We cut the recipe down to make two artichokes and doubled the amount of soppressata and provolone to make a heartier stuffing (we were having these as a main course). We used a rosemary infused olive oil for the stuffing and broth, and threw the lemon halves in the pot as well. They were there to prop up the artichokes, but added a really nice flavor to the broth. Unlike other reviews, we didn't find this difficult or tedious at all, but that could be because we were trimming two artichokes rather than eight. Either way, this recipe is worth the effort.

This recipe is amazing! And SO much easier than it seems. I only did 2 artichokes and stuffed them and put them in a normal pot that you'd boil water in and put a little bit of water in the bottom and a lid on the top and steamed them for 50 min & they came out perfect! No need for a pressure cooker. I HIGHLY recommend it. This was my first time ever cooking artichokes and they came out amazing!

I love this recipe. It's really not that difficult to remove the choke, and it's worth the effort. Pull out some of the inside leaves with your fingers, and then use a melon baller to scrape out the choke. Here's the real secret. After your remove the choke, but before you stuff, throw the chokes in a large pot of boiling water for 8 - 10 minutes. The leaves pre-cook, and are so tender. Let them cool, then stuff. It also cuts down on your overall steaming time (about 40 minutes). I've made this recipe with and without the soppresata and provolone, and it's fantastic either way. You can also cheat and use dried breadcrumbs... Just drizzle some of the broth over the top of the artichokes while they are steaming. I made these for a dinner party, and they were a huge hit.

Excellent! Worth the little bit of work it takes to prepare.

I must be crazy, but I honestly didn't this this was a lot of work at all! I used ready-made bread crumbs. Took me about 15 - 20 minutes to make the stuffing + stuff the artichokes (I only made two, but I did remove the chokes). Then I just watched tv for an hour while they cooked in a pot. My boyfriend and his friends love them! Really easy.

Some people must have a lot more time than I have! To say that they are "a lot or work" as another reviewer has, is putting it mildly!

These are to die for but I prefer to bake them. They are a lot of work so I don't remove the choke. I don't toast the bread crumbs either. I rinse them, make a moist mixture of crumbs and stuff them. I substitute anchovy for sausage and add chopped hard-boiled egg. I top it off with a bit of olive oil, wrap them tightly in foil and bake for 1 hour to 1 hour 20 minutes. You can also throw them on the grill this way. Much easier.
