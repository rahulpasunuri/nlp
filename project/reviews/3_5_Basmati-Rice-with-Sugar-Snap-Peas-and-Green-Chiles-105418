While the ingredients are tasty enough, there is not nearly enough water to cook the rice. On my package of basmati rice, the suggested amount was 6 cups! One would drain it like pasta with that amount, of course, but using this recipe's recommendation resulted in a pot bottom full of burned rice.

Good variation to basic rice. Like many other reviewers, I would add more jalapenos...couldn't even taste the two I added. Served with asian grilled salmon (barefoot contessa)

This was one of the few dishes that was actually inedible for me. The suggestion to include the jalapeno seeds was bad--this was so hot that it felt like punishment to eat. While I feel the recipe could be saved without the heat, I was too traumatized to try it again.

It was a nice side to margarita grilled shrimp. I added another chile to make it spicer and I would add a little more water next time to soften the rice a little more. Great recipe!

I loved it! So light and fresh tasting, with a nice zing. I did substitute chicken stock for water, which I usually do when making rice. Next time I make this, I'm going to double the jalepeno, because I like more spicy food.

Just made this last night--it was delicious! I didn't bother to rinse the rice, and it came out perfectly.

Spicy hot!

This was an excellent side to go with marinatied flank steak. I only used half of the sugar snap peas. Also my halipino was very large so chickened out and removed the seeds. It was just right. Make this one--you'll love it.

This dish is simply delicious! Very light and fresh! I am not a big fan of jalepanos but found this to be the perfect balance. We made this with Swordfish with lime-ginger glaze and Mixed Greens with Oranges, Cranberries, and Pecans! YUMMY!

This /is/ a good recipe. Such a nice change form the usual chile dishes you find here in New Mexico which are either swimming in cheese or meat or both. I substituted New Mexico green chiles for the jalepenos. Worked great.
