My cake turned out beautiful. I used ducan hines cake mix, which I looked all over the box and couldn't find pudding anywhere and b&j's cherry garcia. I followed the recipe as is, without any alterations and I will admit, the cake turned out a little on the dry side (sorta crumbly), but wonderfully flavorful. I might try some adding a little oil next time, cause there certainly will be a next time. I frosted my cake with the Chocolate Marshmallow Frosting, and it seemed to overpower the wonderful ice cream flavors, but still oh so yummy.

I actually made a modified version of this that I also found on the Internet....used chocolate cake mix WITH pudding, mint chocolate chip ice cream and it tasted great and VERRY moist. The only difference between this recipe and the one I used is that I put in 1 CUP of water. Sounds like that would remedy many of the other commenter's complaints of dryness!

I made this with Duncan Hines white cake mix and a premium Jamocha Almond Fudge ice cream. Incredibly easy to make, and turned out moist and delicious.

I was a little nervous given the mixed reviews but, wanted an easy cake for my daughter's birthday party with her friends. This turned out great! I followed JuliaHelene recommendations (thank you) and used a white cake mix withOUT pudding in the mix (not that easy to find these days) and Ben & Jerry's Cherry Garcia ice cream. It was not at all dry and got rave reviews from everyone. I rarely make cake from a box mix but, this will be my go-to recipe whenever I do. (Oh, and the icing, delicious!)

Hi everyone, I have done this one several times now. I don't have any problem with it being dry. I just add a little bit of oil along with the egg [just to make sure it does not come out dry]. I have not tried it without the oil so I can not tell you if it would come out dry. And I do not use a lot of oil, about a tablespoon, if that. I used cookie D. with my mix and then used Cherry G. in the middle after i cooled down but the cherry was too much for my white cake. I have not tried mixing Cherry G in the mix. Maybe next time. ...my suggestion. Try it. It's different, a good different.

I really loved this recipe, but after reading all the reviews I have to admit I was a little worried. After reading the recipe that is here I think I know why - it's missing a lot of important data! 1. DO NOT use a cake mix that contains pudding in the mix. 2. Use WHITE CAKE MIX as this provided the best results 3. Use PREMIUM ICE CREAM, as in Haagan Daz or Ben and Jerry's. You need a solid two cups of ice cream and cheaper brands contain a lot air and lower quality ingredients. Don't skimp! I do a lot of baking and try lots of recipes and this one was really good (and easy!). For more information about the recipe I used (I made a coffee flavored cake) please see pictures on my blog at www.dozenflours.com

I have her cookbooks and use them on a regular basis. This recipe, unfortunately, is one that I would not make again. It is so dry and lacking of any flavor. Agree that it was a waste of $$ ice cream. But the frosting was very tasty and I've made that since. Her Darn Good Choc. Cake is her best recipe so I stick with that. You can't go wrong...

I made this with chocolate cake mix for a potluck and the response was great. I was worried about the comments mentioning dryness, so I boiled a handful of dried cherries and added the cherries and 2-3 TB of left over liquid. The result was very moist and dense and flavorful, and quite a hit with my co-workers. I had to pack up the last bit so that my wife can try it. I look forward to experimenting with other ice cream flavors.

I made this spur of the moment for a party & everyone loved it! I used Ben & Jerry's marshmellow ice cream. I imagine it works a bit better with ice cream that doesn't have add-ins, but it still turned out great...super moist and delicious!

What a waste of expensive ice cream. I would never make this again.

I thought I'd try this recipe since I'd heard so much about this cookbook but it was definitely a flop in my opinion. The cake managed to be both too sweet and dry at the same time. I used Haagen Daz banana foster ice cream and made the suggested frosting since I love banana and chocolate together. The frosting was too sweet and I could still taste that "artificial" box mix taste in the cake. A good cake from scratch just isn't that much more work and tastes soooo much better.

I was sooo excited about this recipe, it sounded amazing. I really felt like it was a little lacking, though. If I made it again, I'd do something to make it more moist and flavorful.

Ugh, i have made melted ice cream cakes before with no luck. Thought the fault was my grade of ice cream. But no, this was a waste of ingredients. Very dry and tasteless. Be forewarned.

this cake was dry and definately tasteless. A real waste of time and expensive ice cream

Cake was Great!!! Simple and easy with only 3 ingedients. I used Ben and Jerry's Peanut butter cup ice cream. I had to cut off the bottom because the chocolates in the the ice cram had sunk, and burnt. besides that, the cake was great. I added about 1-2 tablespoons water into the batter, and the cake was very moist. I can see that this recipe has the potential for a great many cakes.

I found this to be quite bland. A waste of really expensive ice cream. However, to be fair, my mom owns Byrn's book and has made a number of recipes from it that were quite good. This is simiply not a good sample recipe.

Thankfully, this cookbook was a gift. This was the first thing I tried, and what a waste of Cherry Garcia! The cake was sweet, with no real taste, and boy, was it dry. Back to scratch recipes for me. I should have known better.

This cake turned out just so-so, although that might have had something to do with the fact that I tried the recipe with the only kind of ice cream I had in the freezer (Breyer's cookies and cream). The result was dry and just tasted like white cake mix. I'd make it again, but I'd use a more strongly flavoured ice cream (I bet coffee or raspberry would be good!)

Yucko! If there were a choice of zero forks, I would have gladly rated this cake with a big old goose egg. I made it for a dual birthday party, and thankfully made a delicious carrot cake from the Epicuriuos files as well, otherwise my guests would have thought the entire dessert course a complete waste of calories. It was dry and dense and the frosting tasted like bitter glue.

Made this cake with a high quality butter pecan ice cream and homemade caramel frosting and it was fantastic. A little on the sweet side but it was for a birthday cake so it worked out fine. Great texture and we served it with the same ice cream which brought out the flavor in the cake. I love the fact that the recipe is so versatile. I would definitely make this again.

A rather mediocre cake. Very sweet, and as some other reviewers have mentioned, rather dry. I could also taste that artificial "just came out of the box" flavor, which I'm not very crazy about. However, I will give it another shot, this time using a stronger-flavored ice-cream to mask the taste and cutting down on the cooking time to see if it helps with the dryness. Overall, this attempt was OK but not great. It was basically saved by the frosting, which was the chocolate chocolate chip frosting I found on this site--I looked at the marshmallow frosting and decided it would probably be too sweet.

This is a very sweet cake, I would skip the frosting and serve with whipped cream. Especailly intreigued by the many combinations one can play with. I am already contemplating taking two to a potluck since i can't decide on which combo to make

I made this cake but used white chocolate cream cheese frosting (also found at epicurious) for a birthday party. It was so good, what little was left at the end of the evening was being devoured by the guest of honor, sliver by little sliver.

This was so easy and good that I ran out to make another one with a different flavor ice cream! I used Ben and Jerry's EVERYTHING BUT THE and for the other one PHISH - it was delicious - everyone thought so!

I have made this cake twice. Everyone loved it and its SUPER easy to make.Tip-The frosting needs to set a little before putting it on the cake, otherwise it runs off.

This is the first cake mix I've ever made that sank in the middle. I think the addition of ice cream (which has sweeteners as well as the cream and liquid) made the finished product too sweet. Passable, but not stellar.

Rating: 2
The flavor of this cake, when made with super-premium icecream, is quite nice. The problem I had was with the texture. I've tried it three times, experimenting with different flavors of icecream. The one thing all attempts had in common was a particularly dry crumb.

It was so easy to make. It was delicious and creative. Everyone enjoyed it. I think it's a neat recipe because it's a cake that you can make into any flavor. I used one of the Star Bucks ice creams and it was delicious. You only need a pint if you use that brand of ice cream.

Sorry to "burst" other people's bubble. Guess I was looking for something "extra" good or different. Didn't strike me as a great cake. Girls at work felt the same. It was good, but not worth the extra expense of specialty ice cream.

I used the Cherry Garcia, and everyone loved it. I also made the marshmallow frosting, but I substituted almond flavoring ( taste like cherries) instead of vanilla. I only used 3 marshmallows (too sweet) and I cut out 1/3 of the milk. The consistency of the frosting was better.

is it because i used regular chocolate and vanilla ice-cream that the taste wasn't as wonderful as what was promised by the other reviewers? my cake rose really well but i thought it was too sweet and the flavor of the ice-cream did not come through very well.
