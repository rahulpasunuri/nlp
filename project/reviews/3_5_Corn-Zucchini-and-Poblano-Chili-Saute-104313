Wow. A perfect side to grilled fish tacos. Cumin is a must, cilantro is good too but if you don't have it don't sweat it. I play with the proportions and usually end up using double the corn (fresh amps this up to a 10 fork recipe in my opinion).

I can't believe more people haven't rated this recipe with the recommendations of adding cumin and cilantro this is seriously delicious and a new way to cook zucchini for me. Browning it and cooking till it shrinks up makes it so delicious with the other ingredients mmmmm loved the burrito idea too. I even served it with fried eggs and tortillas for breakfast it was so good.

This was one of those meals where I say, "YUM!" the whole time. Although, I have to admit I couldn't resist adding some cumin and cilantro towards the end and I think it was a good move. I also had this in burritos with pinto beans and cheddar cheese. Nellie the dog loved it too. Woof WOOF!

I saved this recipe because my husband and I have a joint effort. He gardens and does the outide cooking. I can , jell, and do the inside cookining with prep help from him. He grew Pablanos, roasted them on the grill , peeled and seeded them and we froze them. We can make any recipe calling for this item . We can not always find all the ingredients living where we live. I just made it last week and it was good.

This was a fabulous complement to our Thanksgiving meal. Light and colorful, with just the right kick from the poblanos (a little more than I was expecting based on other reviews!) Just about every one of my guests loved this.

This is an itneresting take on calabacitas, a stnadard New Mexican side dish. Here in NM-- we use roasted green chile instead of the poblano and red pepper. That way-- it has some heat. Poblanos have no heat of thier own to speak of. I still think that's the best way-- also replace the olive oil with butter will give it a nice hint of richness without becoming overbearing.

This was very good. I served it with PORK TENDERLOIN WITH CHIPOTLE-MARMALADE SAUCE. I doubled the red and poblano peppers. I prefer to have the peppers as the main flavor.

Company brought us zucchini! Everyone loved this dish and I had to print the recipe for them.

This was a great recipe. I used fresh corn and added roasted chicken and served the mixture with corn tortillas and spicy chipotle salsa. We felt very healthy after eating this meal!

This was a major hit this Thanksgiving! With all the potatoes and other heavy dishes, it was lovely to have something fresh and light. The only thing I did differently was to use fresh corn instead of the frozen. It would also be wonderful with roasted chicken.
