This was delicious - 3.5 stars. I will definitely make this again and it for sure could be for a lunch, dinner, or a fun brunch. I made the tomato sauce a few days in advance because I had some tomatoes that were about ready to go. I sauteed a glove of garlic, added the fresh tomatoes, salt and pepper, and some beer. My husband taught me the beer in tomato sauce trick. Also, I forgot to put the basil in and didn't have mozzarella so I grated some Parm over top before it went into the oven and a bit when it came out. Served over a nice multigrain bread instead of the Italian - added a nice nuttiness and it was more healthy.

Really enjoyed this! It was hearty and easy to make (I used chilli instead of red pepper and roughly halved the quantities). I had it with polenta which went really well.

Quite delicious. Made it with fresh Roma tomatoes, and added in some corn. Ladelled it over black olive artisan bread. As others noted, the liquid was more than I liked, so next time: cook down the fresh tomatoes in advance.

There's an eggs-in-purgatory dish on this site that this reminds me of...though this recipe is simpler. I like getting the zuke in! I'll try again next time with eggplant. I agree with many other reviewers here-- watch out to cook it down. The liquid won't magically disappear. Sigh. I halved the recipe for two and cooked it in a cute little cast iron skillet. Picturesque. I also didn't have plain tomatoes in a small can, only stewed, so I used those, and they were good. You could also use fire roasted, I bet...

Love it. It's Shakshuka. Israelis eat it for breakfast, lunch or dinner. I make this as often as I can without my husband realizing hes having too often.

Very good - I added potatoes to it on a lark and they were a very tasty addition!

Very delicious. I made the mistake of putting too much cheese on top - which means the eggs were overcooked by the time the cheese got browned. Next time I'll follow the instructions to the letter.

Quick, healthy and delicious -- everything we want! The ragout is OUTSTANDING; hubby and the kids all loved it. We'll make a lot of this during zucchini season!

This was great. Easy to make (followed the recipe exactly though I replaced the mozzarella cheese with gruyere as that's all I had on hand) and the result is a rich-tasting, satisfying meal. Served it over baked potatoes. Yummy! Only note is that my eggs also took more than 10 minutes to bake.

Mmm - this is fantastic! I had been looking for a recipe like this to duplicate one from my fave brunch spot and it worked great. I also used eggplant, since I am not a zucchini fan, but it could work with any combination of vegetables. I also forgot the red pepper flakes, but thought it was fine the way it is - next time I will try it with them!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out very well. I disagree with the comments about the red pepper flakes--I thought the heat was perfect.

This was so easy and delicious. I omitted the red pepper entirely and added lots more cheese.

this was surprising. i didnt think it would be as good, i used a yellow zucchini from my garden. it did take much longer than 10min to thicken , so you may want to cut down on the liquid or be prepared to simmer longer ,which was alright with me.i also used lots more mozzeralla,next time i make it im going to add a little more pepper flakes,but its pretty spicy as it is

This was good stuff. I made this for me and a friend for dinner, so I thought I would make a full recipe and that would be enough for 2 hungry college kids. Wow, did I underestimate the amount of food this would make! I barely finished one egg with ragout and toast (1 serving). Even though the dish is mostly vegetables, it's extremely filling and satisfying. I love vegetables, and I would consider cutting the amount of veggies down by a third next time I make this in order to make the egg to veggie ratio more reasonable. I made some substitutions -- a whole medium eggplant (salted for 20 minutes to draw out bitterness and extra moisture) for the zucchini, added a pinch of oregano, dried basil for fresh, and fontina and asiago for the mozzerella, because that's what I had around, and the fontina went really well. I agree with previous reviewers: definitely use only a pinch or two of red pepper flakes (I like hot, too) and don't add all the tomato juice; as it was, it took way longer than 10 minutes for the sauce to thicken. Also, make sure the indentations you make for the eggs are really big -- mine were too little and everything but the yolks oozed all over. I don't know if others had this problem too, but it took something like 17 minutes for the eggs to set. Go for toasted whole wheat toast if you can -- mmm... I can't believe how filling this was for only a few hundred healthy calories. By the way, this recipe was my friend's first pleasant experience with eggplant -- yay! Soon he will be a convert!

Everyone I have served this to loved it. It is very versatile, you can substitute all kinds of vegetables in if you like. It is great any meal of the day!

This was o.k., an interesting way to prepare eggs, but since I have other brunch egg recipies that I much prefer, I probably wouldn't make it again. For those who do try it, keep a close eye on the eggs during the last step so as not to overcook. Also, I really like spicy, but the 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper seemed a bit too much for this dish.

Love this egg dish, But make sure you reduce the liquid and I like it less spicy. All in all this is a great sunday breakfast.
