This is by far the best pot roast I've ever tasted, succulent, flavorful and tender. I used a 7-bone chuck roast, which worked out perfectly. Its compact shape fit tidily in my brazier and I only had to use one bottle of wine for a 5.3 pound roast. Why the recipe called for a boneless roast is unclear; cooking it with the bones in place added extra flavor. I followed the recipe closely, except I covered the brazier in the oven and therefore did not need to flip the meat over and back every half hour. At best such a piece of meat is unwieldly, especially when it's sitting in a bath of hot wine. What were they thinking? At the end of the process, I reduced the sauce a bit, but it only took me five minutes. I think if I had uncovered the pot, as directed, most of the sauce would have cooked off in the oven. Anyhow, this one goes in my recipe box and will be my go-to pot roast from now on.

I was cooking for a smaller group, so I halved the meat and liquid but used the full amount of seasoning and herbs. The sauce and vegetables were amazing, but the meat was a bit dry. I will not use bottom round next time, but I will definitely make this again with a better roast.

OK, it's a pot roast. But one of the better pot roasts of my life. I used a chuck roast and I asked my wine guy to pick out a barolo-like Italian wine under $15. The porcini, sage and rosemary really gave it a wonderful flavor.

I used a 3 lb. bottom round, and probably a little under 1 bottle of wine (a washington cabernet from a box). It did take 4 1/2 hours, though i was afraid it wasn't tender, as the fork was sticking inside the meat. When cut, however, i found the roast very tender, though i would probably do a chuck roast next time for a more silky texture. Served with polenta and i totally agree, if you've got truffles to shave on top of this dish, go for it. It would be a great pairing. Great fall/winter meal

Amazing! I work for Amex and get all kinds of requests for Del Posto reservations... I was unsucessful in getting a reservation myself in a recent trip to NYC. After checking this out, there's no need to go! Excellent recipe my whole family enjoyed it

Delicious. Set the oven on convect roast at 265 instead of 250. Cooked for recommended time and cooked again next day before eating. Used a local full-bodied red wine. Meat pulls apart beautifully. Not for slicing I don't think. Yummy!

This was okay, but needed more flavor. I followed the recipe. I used an inexpensive Barolo, and that may have been the reason for its lack of depth. But I just couldn't spend top dollar for a few bottles of a good Barolo that I wasn't actually drinking!

Do not use bottom round for this recipe!! I followed it to a T, and while it produced a deliciously dark and complex tasting sauce, the meat was dry, almost spongy, and flavorless--and this was after 4 and a half hours in the oven!! I'm sure this would work out fine with a better roast...

I have never braised before. This was fun to make. The meat was not as tender as I would have thought but very flavorful. The sauce was great. Our dinner club made this menu and the flavors were great together!

A great method. The roast turned out juicy and tasty. Didn't use Barolo--neither does Mario for his "Barolo" braises, according to the book Heat.
