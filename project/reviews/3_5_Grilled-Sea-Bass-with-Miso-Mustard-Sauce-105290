A favorite at our house. Sea bass can be extremely expensive (and high in mercury), so we sometimes substitute cod -- still delicious!

By far, too much Miso! I would use no more than 1/4 cup of Miso, as it makes the sauce far too salty. I thined the sauce with sake and reduced it down, yet the sauce was still overwhelmingly salty.

I made this sauce & dish as written, and was very disappointed in the sauce itself. It was very salty, and too pasty. I've made other miso glazed recipes from epicurious with much better success. This one won't be made again.

Prepared this recipe using both ling cod, and rex sole since husband doesn't care for cod. Used mild, yellow-ish miso, a seasoned rice wine vinegar, and dijon mustard. Reduced sugar to 2t. with good results. By all means omit salting the fish fillets since the miso is already salty along with the soy, and seasoned vinegar. Do grill the green onions as they complimented the fish and sauce very nicely. A liberal sprinkling of toasted sesame seeds proved to be the piece de resistance of garnishes. Served with a side of baby bok choy braised, then sauteed with a ginger and garlic infused oil. Curious how it would taste to replace mustard with wasabi?!

Thought this was GREAT! Loved the sauce. I used Cod instead of sea bass and it was wonderful! Served with the wasabi mashed potatoes - which need some kicking up and the sesame stir-fry asparagus. It will become a regular in our house!

To a cook on 02/02/03....how about wasabi mashed potatoes?

We thought this was very tasty. The grilled green onions didn't contribute, however. For me, it might be better to chop them up and sprinkle them on. I also think I'll add some garlic and ginger chopped and added to the sauce nest time to help.

I had to use Chilean sea bass since regular sea bass seems not to be available in my area (west coast of Florida). I think the latter fish would have been better. The sauce was tasty, but there are many others, as noted by reviewers, that are just as good, or surpass this one. Served with rice, soy beans, and a salad with a Japanese-style dressing, this all made a nice meal. If there were 2 1/2 forks, that would have been my rating. Note: the sauce may need a bit of thinning out just prior to serving.

This dish was incredible. I will definetely make it again, especially good for guests. I made it with the stir fried asparagus and make sure not to omit the grilled green onions. Does anyone have any suggestions for a carb side, besides white rice? This was GREAT!

I thought this recipe was just okay. I also used Chilean Sea Bass for this recipe. The sauce is good for the first couple bites but my boyfriend and I found that we got tired of the taste quickly. We probably won't make this dish again.

The sauce is good, but the miso paste & soy sauce together make the dish a little too salty for my taste. Next time I'll omit salting the fish prior to brushing with oil, and use reduced-sodium soy sauce for the sauce. I grilled fresh salmon fillet portions with the skin removed. Served it with fresh soba noodles & sugar snap peas, as suggested by a previous reviewer. It was fast, easy, and my guests loved it.

I made this recipe with tilapia, since they were out of sea bass at the market and broiled it instead of grilling because it was pouring out that night, but it was delicious! My guests loved it and asked for the recipe. The sauce was so tasty -- it would be good on almost anything. I think I might try it on tofu next!

Cooked the fish in the oven but I am sure it will taste even better this summer on the grill. A real easy keeper. I thought the sauce could use even more mustard; very tasty.

I loved this recipe! I added more mirin (about 1 Tablespoon more) because it was too mustardy for my husband's taste. Instead of green onions, I grilled thickly sliced zucchini, Japanese eggplant and yellow squash. Used the suggestion below to serve with soba noodles. I mixed some of the sauce with the noodles, then topped with the veggies and seabass and topped with the rest of the sauce. Really delicious and satisfying!

Very tasty and fast to prepare. Used Chilean Sea Bass first time. Would like to try with Salmon, Swordfish, etc. The sauce is delicious. Made the sauce with Dijon and Sweet White organic miso from South River in MA. Served over Jasmine rice with ginger, garlic and finely sliced green onions. Also served with fresh Edamame (soy beans) to keep the Japanese feel. Might be nice to brush the fish with a little of the sauce before grilling for additional flavor. South River also makes other flavors of their organic miso, which I will try in the sauce next time.

We loved this! I served the fish and green onions over soba noodles and sugar snap peas tossed with a little sesame oil and soy sauce. My husband keeps asking when we can have it again. I might try it with salmon next time.

An easy to prepare recipe which can be done on an indoor grill as easily and the flavors are so beautifully balanced. A must do again diah!!!

We are particulary finicky when it comes to fish having lived on the California coast for many years. THIS was incredible, even on our supermarket in the mountains fish. White miso not available so used a darker version which would be the answer to those of you who thought it bland. We will DEFINITELY have this dish on a regular basis.

I served this at a Summer Solstice party for 50, and they are still talking about it! Ended up making it a second time, by request, 3 days later - and have had several requests for the recipe. We didn't have any problems with the sauce, the flavor was just right.

Although this was easy to prepare, it lacked flavor. More mustard or soy sauce or just another grilled fish recipe......

I thought that this was a nice dish, but the sauce lacks the complexity of some other miso sauces that I have made. Try making the pan seared tuna with ginger miso cilantro cause (another recipe from Bon Apetit or mix 2tb miso, 1tb honey, 1ts chilli garlic, 5tb rice wine vinegar, 1tb fresh ginger, 4tb green onions

A really great recipe, but then again any fish tastes that is prepared on the grill tastes good. I thought the sauce was a bit on the thick side so I added a bit more Mirin and some more water to thin it out a bit. Grill a few more green onions than the recipe calls for, because they go fast!

I thought the sauce was fabulous and I could use it for a variety of Asian meals. The ingredients were a little difficult to find, but any up-scale market should have them.

My dinner guests raved about this one! I used 1 and 1/2 tsps of Dijon mustard ... found the miso in the refrigerated section of the market, near the tofu. The rice wine can be found in the "international" section of the market, near the sesame oil, etc., not in the wine section! Fish is best grilled for this recipe, rather than broiled.
