I don't usually turn to Epicurious for Indian recipes, but I was intrigued by this dish. My Mother-in-law left a bag of postho the last time she visited and I've been looking for new recipes to use it in. This dish, was great - even my Bengali husband praised it, no small thing. Next time I plan to make it in a slow cooker. PS: if your town has an Indian or Pakistani market you can get postho (and lots of other delicious things) there.
