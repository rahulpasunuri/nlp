This is my favorite summer dessert. Cool and not too sweet. I vary the the berrys and do combinations. Raspberry, blackberry and blueberry being my favorite.

Excellent! Cool, smooth, firm, and the most lovely rosy color. On the tart side, this classic English dessert is wonderful with sweet whipped cream for contrast. Very simple and quick to make.

It was easy to make and was real good! And it was great the next day but a little too soft.
