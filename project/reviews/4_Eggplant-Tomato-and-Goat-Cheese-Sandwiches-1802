This is a nice recipe. I used mini baguettes and cut them lengthwise. I also added garlic salt to the olive oil I brushed on the bread and a hint to the eggplant. My husband who doesn't care for goat cheese or eggplant thought these were yummy!

This recipe was super easy. I made it as directed and thought it turned out great. I will definitely make it again.

great base recipe but i did modify it a good bit to my own taste and mood: seasoned the eggplant way more than specified, put garlic on the bread before i grilled it (there are very few savory recipes that i don't add garlic to), added thick-cut ham and caramelized onions, and pressed the whole assembled sandwich in my electric grill. it was also really pretty; lots of great colors! served it with fresh mango. definitely saving this recipe to make again and again!

Mouthwatering and super easy! Don't worry about what looks like a small amount of red wine vinegar. The proportions are perfect. Works under a broiler at the times indicated. Used LaBrea garlic bread for an even more flavorful effect.

Have made this twice now and really look forward to having it again. I used Chinese eggplants cut into rounds and served on both toasted ciabatta bread and in a whole wheat pita - both delicious, but grilled bread might be even better! I just drizzled a bit of olive oil on the eggplant - you really don't need any in my opinion. You can alos grill more than you need for future leftovers that you just warm in the microwave before assembling.

absolutely wonderful, light, summery, healthy, delicious, easy. I've already made this three times -- it's becoming a staple.

This was one great sandwich! I was making a few sandwiches and broiling the eggplant so next time I would cut rounds instead of lengthwise slices just to save some room on the broiler pan. The goat cheese just melted into the bread (which I broiled last instead of first as the recipe suggested) so that the bread would be hot. My husband just loved the flavors and he is not a huge fan of fresh basil...till now.

Marinated the eggplant slices in olive oil and garlic. Seasoned with salt and pepper and grilled. Also served on Ciabatta and it was divine. My mother in law requested the recipe.

So good! And as I sit here and eat the leftovers(in a flour tortilla) 2 days later, I think it tastes as good at room temperature! Used fresh mozzarella instead of goat cheese. I also added carmelized onions and sauteed red bell peppers to the sandwiches. I enhanced the tomato topping with chopped garlic and a touch of balsamic.

Its a great feeling when you taste something you made yourself that tastes as good as you would get in a restaurant. I also baked some garlic and when they were soft and sweet, spread them on the bread. I also added roasted red peppers. Wow, this sandwich is just so good. Also, tried it with brie and it was good with that too.

We absolutely loved this! I made it as the recipe specified with the exclusion of salt( as I usually don't cook with salt)but I think this recipe needs some.I used cherry tomatoes and I cut the eggplant in rounds instead of lengthwise and put in on a french loaf baguette. I also prepared the tomato mixture in a few hours in advance so the flavors could mingle. Itlooks beautiful on the plate and the taste was incredible.We had a lovely red Portugese wine with it and enjoyed it as a light supper. I will definitely make this again and again.

I don't measure, so I can't say I'd add more of this or less of that, but how I threw together their ingredients ended up great! I substituted dried basil for fresh. Used roma tomatoes. I added sauteed crimini mushrooms. The bread I used was veggie bread w/herbs de provence I had made two days before. Next time I may carmalize onion and add that. Try this recipe; it is quick, easy & colorful and if I had a restaurant, I'd add it to my menu. The drawback: it made a very high sandwich. Consider serving it open faced as an appetizer..
