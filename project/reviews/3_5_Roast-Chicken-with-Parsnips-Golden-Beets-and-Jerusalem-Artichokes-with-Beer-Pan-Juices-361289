Excellent! Tried the Jerusalem artichokes for the first time, and they are yummy!

This recipe was great, if you leave off the beer sauce. I used Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and it turned very bitter. Yuck. Thankfully, you can just leave it off. I also added sweet potatoes in lieu of sunchokes, because I couldn't find them, and it was delicious!

Made this without beets, as we had been eating a lot of beets, and LOVED the opportunity to roast sunchokes without peeling them! what a revelation! The whole dish came together beautifully!

Yum! Made this the other night alongside the celery root and potato puree w/ roasted jerusalem artichokes (p. 92 of this issue) and all was delish! Chicken was flavorful and tender and veggies great. I used all my sunchokes in the potato/celeriac mash, so here subbed fennel for them. Delish.

Delicious! Husband and I both enjoyed this very much. I made the recipe exactly as is, other than substituting the artichokes with extra beets, as I couldn't find them at my grocery store. Make sure your parsnips are well-roasted; it makes all the difference in their flavor.
