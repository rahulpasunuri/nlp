Made this for a cold, yucky day in New Orleans; able to get gorgeous shrimp locally. Used local Chaurice sausage, homemade seafood stock it is a favorite of ours.

Sooo good!! Will most certainly make this again. I used skinless turkey smoked sausage dusted with cajun spice to cut down on fat and cholesterol. Also dusted the shrimp with cajun spice. Perfect heat for us. Everything else the same.

Delicious and easy! I've made this both with the pastry baked on top and baked separately. On top it definitely gets mushy. Separately, it looks a little "assembled", but it tastes much better. This recipe lends itself well to adding the things you like; for example, I added chopped red bell pepper and peas. Yummy!

Great dish, and fairly quick to put together. I like to saute the sausage separately to eliminate some of the fat, and add to each bowl just before putting in the oven. Delicious!

I started by frying some applewood smoked bacon and then used a little of the rendered fat to cook the leeks. I also added some gin and rosemary to the stock and substituted grilled chicken for the shrimp. I crumbled the fried bacon over the pies before adding the puff pastry and baking...amazing. One of the best comfort recipes I've come across.

This is one of the best meals I have ever made. Absolute deliciousness.

Flavor is great and the pot pies come together rather quickly. However, I had substantial modifications: 1/2C onions (in place of leeks), sherry wine, omitted sausage, tossed the shrimp in seasoning prior to combining & cooked in a caserole dish with triangles of puff pastry on top. Yum! Next time, would love to add scallops and/or lump crab!

OMG this was great! easy turned as described in other reviews. I followed pretty much to the letter except I add 1/2 teaspoon of Penzeys Cajon spice mix to give it a lill more punch...but it was great without it, I just dig the extra KICK

I doubled this recipe to feed 10 adults and it was the perfect amount. It was delicious and elegant. I had to cut the pastry into 10 pieces and then plated them individually. I made no substitutions except for the seafood stock, which I bought already constituted. Everyone loved it and I will make it again.

I tried to half the recipe for two people, and think I put too much sausage in versus shrimp, so it was a bit sausage heavy -- and a bit salty (and I LOVE my salt). My husband loved the idea of baking the top first, but said he'd prefer no sausage at all. Maybe I'll modify and try again (Chicken pot?).

Absolutely excellent! I used Chorizo instead of Andouille (I know, poor substitute, but it worked!). Aside from that, I made this to spec, adding a minute or two to the various cooking times. The blend of flavours in this is wonderful. Katrosa from San Fran's ideas are interesting - by doing the puff pastry separately you run the real risk of having it not fill the top of your dishes, making it look like you've basically put a dinner roll on the top of a stew. Shrimp-peel stock is also a good idea. Read both of those suggestions after I made it though.

Why would you review this recipe if you changed almost all the main ingredients? Not helpful at all.

Outstanding!! I made a few modifications - I used part seafood stock (kitchen basics brand) and part bottled clam juice; I substituted diced yellow turnip instead of potato which I roasted for about 15 mins with a little olive oil and s&p then added to the dish as directed; and I used chorico instead of andouile. Instead of pastry dough I used Portuguese sweet bread rolls, which are pretty big. I hollowed them out, toasted them, and spooned the filling into the homemade bowl. YUMMY! Maybe not as elegant as the pastry, but it was delicious! I will definitely make this again!

We have made this several times exactly by the recipe and it's always excellent. Flavor and spice in this dish will be a function of the andouille suasage you use. We use an authentic cajun andouille and never have to add anything. Plenty of heat! Also, like Katrosa below, make shrimp stock from saved shrimp shells. We'll save all our shells in the freezer and make a big batch of stock once or twice a year. This will make a huge difference in the quality of this dish. Lastly, make sure to bake the puff pastry rounds separately. This prevents doughy, soggy pastry.

I've made this several times, and all to rave reviews. Followed recipe exactly, and yes you need to cook the potatoes longer but other than that, no problems! All thumbs up. I've also used sweet potatoes instead of white and they added a great flavor!

I made this for Christmas dinner with soup and an elaborate salad, and it made a very festive meal. The grocery store was out of puff pastry sheets, so I used frozen croissants instead. I had no chives so I used cilantro. I had no vermouth so I used white wine. It was all delicious, nevertheless.

This is extrordinary. Really tasty dish. We will have it again.I cooked the potatoes a little longer than the 6 min as was recommended by others. The onlty change I made was to use crescent roll dough (comes in one long sheet) and used one long baking dish instead of individual dishes. I baked the casserole for 15 min.

Love this recipe. Flavors meld so well and my whole family enjoyed the spicy sausage. I baked in a rectaglular dish and covered with one big sheet of puff pasty. Easier for a weeknight dish! Also added a little white pepper at the end for extra kick! Yum!

This was great! Similar to cook below I used shell puff pastry and put on top of bowl and baked for 15 minutes. Much simpler and just as wonderful to look at.

Just made this for the second time, and it came out even more delicious. I definitely recommend: adding red jalepeno diced with the garlic, simmering the potatoes a bit longer so they're almost falling apart, & baking the puff pastry top to the bowl. This last step is key to an impressive presentation & actually easier eatability. All you have to do is brush egg yolk in a 1-inch border around the puff pastry dough, press it around the lip of your bowls, and bake until puffed and golden (~15 mins). We also made shrimp stock from the shrimp peels, and I used that instead of the concentrated fish stock. This is something I've now added permanently to my repetoire!

Excellent! Made two pies -- one with sausage and one without. Both great!

This is a really nice combination of flavors. This level of spiciness was fine for me. The potatoes did take longer - approximately 10 minutes. I plan to serve this to guest sometime soon.

Very Nice. I ended up serving this as a chowder (i.e., didn't use the puff pastry)...it was very good. I agree that it could use a bit more punch than the andouille sausage provides. I'll add some Essence or cayenne the next time. Also, added some leftover roasted asparagus to the leftovers and that was very good too. This is definitely a 'make again'.

Rating: 4
LOVED it. I made this as directed and it was terrific. Like others have noted, the potatoes needed to cook longer than 6 minutes. It took closer to 15-20 for mine to reach the tender stage. The flavor combination is great. My husband and I enjoyed two last night and we're having the other two for dinner tonight... can't wait!

I made this recipe exactly as listed, vermouth and all, and it is fabulous. I think you could definately use white wine instead of vermouth and save on the cost. I love the idea of adding more spice by coating the shrimp, although my andouille was pretty spicy. I am working my way through all the pies in this section. The Shepherd's Pie, while is sounded good, was a lot of work for a weak result. This one is terrific.

Wow, gooooooood! I made this for a dinner party and everyone RAVED. Only thing I did different was add the potatoes earlier to ensure they'd cook through... 6 mins wouldn't have been enough. I also cooked the puff pastry 10 mins then added them to the top the last 5 mins. Turned out fabulously. Will definitely make again!

Excellent! I thought the other two savory pies I've made from this issue(Lamb and Eggplant Shepard's Pie & Moroccan-style chicken pie) were great, but this one tops them both. The only changes I made were to toss the shrimp(left them whole) in some Essence as suggested by another reviewer (great addition of spice if you like it) and to add the potatoes with the clam juice (afraid that the 12 minutes wouldn't be quite enough)and reduce the amount of andouille just a bit (two links ~ 6 oz instead of 8 and cut into slices rather than cubes to match the size of the shrimp). The amazing part was how good it was two days later! Just zapped the filling to hot and topped with the remaining pre-baked pastry and popped it in oven for 5 min. Just as delectable as it was the first time round. This would also be an excellent dinner party dish-maybe cutting the pastry into interesting shapes and baking in smaller ramikins, mugs etc.

Make this recipe tonight!! It's absolutely fabulous. This is perfect for rainy weeknights, the pastry is a cinch, the filling is easy, and the whole thing simply impressive. My boyfriend said it's the best dinner I ever made him. I added half a red jalepeno with the garlic and sausage for a bit of color and punch. Definitely recommend adding something with a bit of spice. I also used fish stock instead of the concentrate and water. And I used the wine instead of the vermouth, without any disappointment. My only problem was that I made my little puff pastry tops a tad to big and had to trim them down. Will definitely make again and soon!

Fantastic recipe. Made only minor changes and it came out perfect. It made 4 large portions. The sausage I used was a portuguese sausage. I'm sure kelbasa would work also. I also went with a prior recomendation and used 1cup clam juice with 1cup vegtable broth, but also added 1 cube Knorr fish bouillon. The puff pastry on top was a perfect topping. Family loved it. Will be making it again.

This was excruciatingly salty. I added no salt. The culprit must have been the andouille from Balducci's. I used Spanish cured andouille. Even if it had not been so salty, I would not make this again. I didn't like the combinations.

Rating: 4
I made this as directed. Very good and very rich. I used a 9 inch square pan and it filled the pan nearly to the top. Definitely makes more than 4 servings. I used a red bliss potato and had trouble getting the potato tender. I finally scooped out the potato, put it in some chicken broth separately and boiled for a while.

Although I was tempted to make alterations to this recipe, I refrained and stayed true. Boy was I glad!! Great comfort food for a cold night yet sophisticated enough to serve for company. I look forward to making again and highly recommend this dish.

Outstanding! Made the dish almost exactly to recipe specifications and amounts. The suggested timing is right on. The only change was to replace the hard to find seafood stock with 1 cup of Clam Juice and 1 Cup of Vegetable Stock. It fits very well with the ingredients. I also tossed the 'local Gulf Shrimp' with a bit of Essence before adding in and used diced Russets rather than Reds because they hold up and absorb flavors better. It is very rich. I made it for my wife and I tonight (2) and have two more dinners left over.
