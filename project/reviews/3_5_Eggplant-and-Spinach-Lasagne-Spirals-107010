Roasting the tomato and eggplant gave this dish an amazing flavor. In London I couldn't find lasagne sheets with curly edges so mine wasn't as pretty, but it was super delicious. It is time consuming, but worth the effort.

a bit of hard work to make an extraordinary meal everyone loved it and it freezes well for another day

Oh my gosh, this is my "go-to" recipe when we have guests! The sauce alone is so amazing that I use it for all my tomato-based pasta dishes!

This dish was very tasty, but was entirely too fussy. I would just as soon turn it into a regular lasagna and be done with it.

I've made this recipe as stated twice now and both times the result was delicious. However, because it takes so long to prepare, I probably won't make it again. I will make a traditional, simpler eggplant lasagna instead.

This turned out delicious. I added a little extra salt, especially to the sauce. Homemade tomato sauce generally needs a generous amount of salt to bring out the tomato taste. The rolls were a nice twist to traditional lasagne and added a touch of elegance to an otherwise ordinary dish. I wouldn't change a thing in the recipe (except for a little extra salt).

Turned out delicious. Added mozzarella to the spinach mixture. Dried basil is totally fine. Spooned tomato sauce directly over the rolls before putting in the oven. Also after 20 minutes in the oven, I took off the foil sprinkled more mozzarella on each roll and cooked for another 5-10 minutes. If you get the sauce, eggplant slices and spinach mixture ready (do the hard part), it's fun for the kids to put it all together and roll them up.

I thought this was okay, but certainly not spectacular. And while I read a lot of people say it was quite easy, that wasn't my experience -- wish I had some of their tips. I felt it was a fairly involved process and would have found it easier just to do a standard lasgne dish with an easier sauce preparation and no-boil noodles. I also felt that there wasn't enough sauce -- I would make probably 50% more than what is called for in the recipe.

Easy, but not as fulfilling as lasagne.

YUMMY!! Very simple, easier than a whole pan of lasagne.

We loved it. I added diced mozzarella to the ricotta mixture and also added more grated cheese. I used my own recipe for the sauce because its much easier to make and tastes great.I prepared everything the day before and kept it in the fridge until the next day then baked it.

It makes me feel like such an artisan, the work involved is so pleasurable. I make the sauce alone sometimes and have a hard time stopping myself from just eating it all while standing at the stove. A fantastic dish, not easy, but a crowd pleaser.

I usually double the amounts to use a whole box of lasagna noodles. I also puree the eggplant and add to the spinach mixture.

I'd rather make the "real" lasagne! You can buy better tomato sauce in a jar. I thought the sauce was flavorless even though I added extra onion, garlic, and basil. I will not be making this again but suggest to those of you that will try adding some mozzarella to the filling. Not only was the filling bland as well, it didn't have that nice cheesy consistency. One last problem - 20 minutes in the oven was not enough to heat it thoroughly.

I have been told by others that my lasagne was the best, however personally, I favor this recipe, and as a guy cooking for myself, I like making this and having the leftovers later in the month. Good job!

I found this to be a delightful twist to the traditional lasagne, with a few changes. I am not a fan of eggplant so that was omitted entirely. I added some oregano to the sauce and a touch of basil and some mashed garlic to the ricotta mixture. I also used mozerella in the filling and over the baking spirals. Delicious.

i little bit of work but worth it. be generous with the basil.

A bit time-intensive, not to mention a greater than normal clean up project, but definitely delicious.

two reasons for not giving the dish 4 forks. the first is that i'm a vegetarian who eats milk but no eggs. just don't think the yolk was totally necessary. second... i love mozzarella and it's not in the ingredient list. i added shredded cheese to the filling and sprinkled some on top. felt it was a lot of work but the end result was worth it.
