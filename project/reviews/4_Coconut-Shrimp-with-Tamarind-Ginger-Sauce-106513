This really is outstanding. I make things from epicurious fairly frequently, but don't often review and thought this was so tasty it warranted a good review. It was also good with a simple dipping sauce made from just orange marmalade and whole grain mustard.

Loved the whole thing, wouldn't make it without the sauce. Substituted 1 T. mango chutney for the tamarind as suggested by another reviewer. And used 1/2 Panko and 1/2 sweetened coconut. Added a bit more beer to batter. FABULOUS.

Rating: 3
I thought this recipe was just OK. Guests liked the shrimp, but I will try adding some panko and some unsweetened coconut to the sweetened version next time. Will definitely skip the sauce, which I didn't like at all! Too much mustard flavor. I'll stick to sweet Thai chili sauce, maybe with a smidge of tamarind.

Rating: 4
This recipe was outstanding. I made a few adjustments by adding Panko to the coconut mix and refrigerated for 1 hour before frying in a deep fryer. Sauce was also excellent, I substituted lemon for lime; Worcestershire for Tamarind, less mayo.

I made this today. Next time I will sprinkle some salt to the shrimps before dropping it to the batter.Added more beer to the batter to thin it. Shrimps tasted a little bland without the sauce. Sauce is good. I used tamarind paste.Will make it using half panko and half coconut.

Rating: 4
The taste of the batter/coconut is fab! I added a bit more beer as the batter was quite thick, however the batter keeps the coconut on the shrimp fairly well. I didn't have time to make the sauce and served them with sweet asian chile sauce - they were to die for and got rave reviews!

This is my go-to date recipe. It is such a simple dish, and actually, I hate shrimp, but it always impresses the guys! I have made this over and over, and wonder if it would be good with tofu.

I made both the shrimp and the sauce. I definitely LOVED the sauce, it pairs well with the slight sweetness of the shrimp. However, I prefer to make coconut shrimp with just panko, dried coconut, and a little bit of flour. This creates a much thiner, lighter crust.

the shrimp came out good but the batter was too thick and pasty! Add more beer til you get a thinner consistency. The sauce was horrible. I used tamarind seasoning paste thats all i could find maybe thats why. I made the sweet chili sauce from another coconut shrimp recipe from this website and it was outstanding! I gave only 3 forks.

Wow, very easy and got rave reviews from my guests. My regular coconut shrimp recipe from this site (with the pineapple salsa) is good but my husband told me to replace it with this.

Rating: 4
This recipe is amazing. I barely tweaked it at all (unusual for me). The batter would even be good without the coconut for those who don't like coconut or could be replaced by slivered almonds. I added a bit of passion fruit pulp to the sauce and used tamarind pulp instead of juice, it's less sweet more tangy and pureed ginger.

out of all the hor d'ouevers we put out this was the first to disappear in record time. i added a tad more tamarind concentrate to the sauce so i can taste the tamarind flavor a bit more

Rating: 4
Both shrimp and sauce are delicious. I threw a bunch of shrimp into the batter all at once and I really struggled with them. Next time I'll follow directions and dip one at a time. I ran out of coconut for the last 5 shrimp. But we had plenty without them; the portions are large for an appetizer course.

Rating: 4
This review is just for the shrimp as I used a different dipping sauce. The shrimp are delicious, but I agree with those who said to add more beer as the batter is too thick. I tried cooking some of the shrimp in the thick batter, but it made the coating too heavy and dense. It was much better with the thinner batter. I also made a slightly different version by adding some panko breadcrumbs to the coconut and I liked that even better than the straight coconut as it made a lighter, crisper crust. However, both versions were excellent. All in all, a great recipe that I am adding to my keepers list.

Rating: 4
Definitely a four-forker! I did not try the sauce - I created my own out of orange marmalade, soy sauce, and honey, but the shrimp from this recipe were absolutely perfect. I'd agree that you need to add a bit more beer than the recipe calls for; it's a bit too thick otherwise. I ran out of coconut, but the batter was excellent for making just fried shrimp. VERY easy for those who fear deep-frying!

Wow! No changes necessary. Even the sauce was delicious.

Rating: 4
We made this for a supper club & it was a big hit. We don't fry a lot of things so we had some dark brown prawns in the first batch because we had them in about a minute too long. And we doubled the sauce for the 1.5 of prawns and it was just right. Also, the sauce used to coat the prawns first was way too thick so we ended up adding more beer until it it had a better consistency.

Rating: 3
Pretty good recipe. I used miracle whip instead of Mayo and wasn't crazy about the sauce. Will definately make this again.

I had never had coconut shrimp but made it as a special dish for the guest of honor at a birthday party who loves it. Everyone raved that it was the best coconut shrimp ever and it was. I would definitely try it with different sauces and the idea of cooking it outside on the external burner of the grill was brilliant!

Rating: 4
I made the coconut shrimp and the sauce exactly as written and everyone raved about it! I deep fried the shrimp in my deep fryer for one minute (turning after 30 seconds). The sweet and the spicy combination was wonderful! As a variation, I also used the same batter, but instead of dredging it through coconut, I coated it with some Captain Crunch cereal (no, this isn't a misprint) that I processed in the food processor. No one could figure out the slightly sweet taste, but everyone agreed that they both were wonderful with the sauce.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe at least 10 times and it is always the hit of the night. We have a side burner on our bbq so we use it to deep-fry the shrimp and then the smell and smoke do not stay in the house. Also, we change the beer in the recipe and the type of dipping sauces served to reflect the theme of the evening, i.e.: Jamaican - Red label beer and the Tamarind sauce suggested here, Mexican - Corona beer and mango salsa , Cuban - Cristal beer and mojito type salsa with lime and mint, Thai - Thai beer and a red chili Thai sauce etc.

This was a wonderful dish! My husband, who usually won't eat "gourmet" food, had seconds. I followed this recipe almost exactly. Since I didn't have tamarind concentrate, I substituted Worchestershire sauce that had tamarind in it (Lea & Perrin's). Sauce still came out great. Easy to make and the shrimp come out nice and tender. Will definitely make this again!

Agreed that it is extremely messy to make--but guests raved about these shrimp! Great for parties, we made them for a Jamaican themed party last week and they were gobbled up. The tangy sauce tasted awkward by itself but complements the sweet shrimp.

This recipe was a little messy to make but worth it. I had to improvise a sweet sauce made with pineapple juice because I could not fins the tamarind concentrate. I really recommend it.

Rating: 4
This is one of those recipes your guests will go crazy about. Tamarind concentrate was a bit difficult to find, but I found it in my grocery store in the Hispanic foods section. I used a tamarind drink concentrate so it was in a little packet that looked like a Kool-Aid packet. It worked just fine, and had the right amount of sweet needed for the sauce. Also, I never fry foods, so I had no idea that heating the oil would take as long as it did. To get to 350 degrees, it was well over an hour at a medium-low setting. I didn't increase the heat because I was worried about burning it. Give yourself time to heat the oil. Also, watch the temperature after you cook each batch. It goes down about 50 degreees or so. Definitely a recipe I will make many more times to come.

Rating: 4
Absolutely wonderful, and impossible to stop eating! The cool, creamy, tangy sauce is a perfect counterpoint to the hot, coconutty, fried shrimp. We found the coating on the first few shrimp came off and hypothesized it was because the shrimp were too cold (barely defrosted). Sure enough, it stuck just fine to room-temperature shrimp.

Rating: 4
Excellent! Easy, delicious, fool-proof. The sauce is a real keeper -- everyone was trying to figure out what the flavor was.

Absolute winner. Took this to a party and all 60 shrimp were gone in a matter of 9 minutes! Now I bring copies of the recipe to accompany the appetizer!

Rating: 4
Absolutely wonderful (I didn't make the sauce) I've made this twice and the second time I didn't want to deal with the mess at dinner time so I coated them ahead of time and froze them for an hour as suggested by others. I did not like the results at all--the coconut was over browned before the shrimp was done no matter what temperature I tried. Will definitely make again though without freezing.

Rating: 3
While I rated this a 3, I will not make it again...only because I made two coconut shrimp recipes at the same time to compare (the other being "coconut-crusted fried shrimp" from this site). This was delicious, however it wasn't as easy to make as the other recipe, and I was able to detect the batter (maybe it was too thick?). My husband loved the tamarind ginger sauce, but it had too strong of a mayonnaise flavor for me, but not to the point that I disliked it, but it just wasn't my favorite (I made 3 sauces). I had a hard time finding tamarind concentrate, until someone in the store pointed out that it was simply "sour soup base concentrate". I also prepped the shrimp and then froze for about an hour before frying. I had minimal coating come off. Someone recommended that somewhere (either from this recipe or the other coconut shrimp recipe)and it worked great, not to mention gave me time to prep the main course. Again, this is excellent, but to me it wasn't as easy or quite as good as the other coconut shrimp recipe I mentioned.

Rating: 4
Ever since I discovered this recipe I can't stop making it. Keep the batter thin, spread the battered shrimp on a cookie tray then sprinkle on the coconut and press with wax paper to help it adhere, flip and add more coconut. Then chill for an hour before deep frying and the coconut will not fall off during frying. Some folks freeze the shrimp after adding the coconut I hear.

Rating: 4
I also don't usually make deep-fried food, but this was really excellent! I used peanut oil for the frying. I also didn't have time to make the tamarind ginger sauce, but purchased starfruit sauce instead. O so bad for you but o so good!

Excellent recipe for coconut shrimp! I couldn't find tamarind concentrate, so I just made the sauce with extra lime juice and ginger. My dinner guests raved about this appetizer.

I loved this and so did my guests. I made a different sause and it was devine. 1 jar red jalapeno jelly and 1 tsp chili oil and 2 tbsp of sweet chili sauce. Heat on stove until runny and enjoy. the heat from the sauce is a nice contrast to the sweet shrimp.

Rating: 4
Like others, I prepared this as an entree, including the tamarind sauce, but used larger and far fewer shrimp (full recipe of batter though). It was fabulous! Worth every minute of the preparation time and the hassles of deep frying. I agree with at least one other reviewer; although distinctive, I didn't feel the tamarind sauce added something all that desirable. The shrimp are that outstanding on their own (although we did eventually resort to dipping them a simple horseradish cocktail sauce with heavenly results).

Fabulous! I usually avoid fried foods, but this one is worth the calories. Served at a recent gathering and no one really seemed interested in the main course after eating these. Could not find tamarind, so I upped the lime juice a bit - tasted great! I agree with the others, this is a fabulous meal, but also works as an appetizer. Easy to make, and did I mention fabulous????? Make these!

This is absolutely delicious! My favorite appetizer at Tommy Bahama's in Naples, FL is the coconut shrimp, and my husband and I decided that this recipe equals theirs! I did not use the sauce recipe, instead used the pineapple salsa (also from this site), and it was wonderful. Served it over a bed of super slaw (also from this site), was a terrific meal!

I made this appetizer as my contribution to a dinner party. Couldn't find the tamarind so I substituted a sauce of red pepper jelly, mayonnaise and lime juice.

I loved this recipe but have to admit I'm not a big fan of deveining shrimp. By the time I finished deveining all of those shrimp I had lost my appetite in a big way! But, let me tell you, awesome recipe. I agree, you would have to fry them before freezing ... the batter just wouldn't work right. I loved the recipe and wouldn't change a thing.

Fantastic! My Mom loves coconut anything, and really loved this. It was restaurant quality. I froze the few leftovers, AFTER frying, and they were still stupendous two weeks later after 10 min. in a 400 degree oven. This, I think, is the preferred method for making these ahead of time.

It seems to me that Julie from Guelph didn't deep fry these at all. I think she coated them with the coconut mixture and froze them; she then baked them in the oven in lieu of frying. (At least that's the way I interpreted her review).

I made these for my husbands 29th birthday party, two days ahead of time and froze them! During the party I put them right from frozen into a 400degree oven for 8-10 minutes and they were amazing! Everyone loved them, even a chef from Toronto who was there wanted the recipe and could not believe I had froze them! I served them with a horseradish, mayo, lime & dijon mustard dip, they were gone in minutes. I have since had requests to make them for other gatherings!

This is an excellent recipe. We have enjoyed coconut shrimp when on vacation on Sanibel Island in Florida -- and these certainly measure up. I followed the recipe as stated and got rave reviews from my husband. As you would expect, the flavor of the dipping sauce intensifies over time -- I thought it was actually better the next day.

I made this using chicken tenders instead of shrimp. It came out wonderfully! My whole family loved it, even my 2-year old. My 17-year old said it was better than any restaurant! Mess was minimal.

Instead of frying, we placed the shrimp on skewers and grilled them. Be sure to have temperature of coals low so that the cocnut does not burn and the batter and shrimp still cook. Takes about 10 minutes total- 5 per side.

I made these for my cocktail party (skipped the tamarind sauce, served with a sweet-and-sour) and received excellent reviews. Because they were time consuming to make (frying in small batches), I did them a few hours early and reheated in the oven at 350 for just a few minutes and they came out fine. I made the mistake of thinning out the batter with some additional beer and found the coconut did not adhere as well.

Rating: 4
I definitely wouldn't call myself a great cook, but I tried this anyway as I love a challenge. It wasn't half as difficult as I thought it would be, and it came out perfect! Better than any coconut shrimp I've had in a restaurant. As many have already said, the dipping sauce really makes this dish. So if anyone is apprehensive about trying this - if you can follow a recipe, you shouldn't have a problem. I mean, I didn't even know how to devein shrimp and have never deep fried anything. I brought these to a party and I was a hero, and my girlfriend thinks I'm a genius! I fried one shrimp without the coconut to see how the batter was by itself and it seems like it could be a little lighter.. maybe more beer or something would make it crispier.

Rating: 3
I gave this recipe 3 forks because they tasted great, but I must say that it was a bit messy, although a friend who'd done them said it was always messy, and the thing that I have to give 2 forks was the sauce. We definetively had to make alterations here. HINT: DO NOT BE AFRAID OF TAMARIND!!! Making the recipe just as they said made the sauce taste like sweet mayonnaise, none of the flavors came through. So I added a lot more tamarind and some more ginger. I'm not a fan of mayonnaise so I hated the original taste, but after adding more tamarind it was perfectly tangy and a great combination for the sweet shrimp. I'll do this again but I'll be sure to add more of that tamarind.

This will go on my list of signature appetizers! My guests & I loved it. It was easy to make and I think even non-coconut fans will love this dish. The sauce was good but for those who don't want to go through the trouble of finding tamarind concentrate, a sweet & sour sauce would be a compliment as well.

What a terrific recipe. We loved it! The sauce is the best. The coconut was not overpowering and the combination of flavours of the shrimp, batter, coconut and sauce were terrific. The batter was quite thick and I needed to add more beer to reach the proper consistancy. Otherwise I made it as per recipe.

I made these to pass around at a dinner party, and my guests loved them -- as did I! The sauce is a keeper, too. One tip: invest in a thermometer if you don't already own one. That eliminated all the guesswork I usually face when deep-frying. I think it's the key to this recipe's success. I made these to go with the jerk chicken and papaya salsa in the same issue. Fantastically easy and delicious.

I'm curious as to why it says "not dark" beer. This recipe is very close to the one I use for coconut shrimp. I've had the best results with my accustomed recipe when using Guinness, though I do have to thin it with a bit of water. I think the sweetness of the stout really accents the coconut.

I love coconut shrimp,and I thought this recipe variation was one of the best I have tried. One suggestion for others: When I serve the shrimp, I also offer Orange Marmalade as a dipping sauce- wonderful flavor and not too sweet.

Rating: 0
Regarding the coconut - perhaps unsweetened coconut would acceptable for the coconut non-lovers. It is drier than the sweetened and of course this would reduce sweetness, so add seasonings accordingly. Henry's in San Diego carries it and I know it makes excellent macaroons.

Rating: 3
To the cook from Santa barbara: Regular bread crumbs should work just fine; if you can get the japanese style bread crumbs it will taste the same but look prettier. But, even if you are not a coconut lover you should give this a try. After you deep fry the coconut it has a totally different taste. Good luck.

I haven't tried the recipe, so I stuck with the ratings already given, but I have a question for fellow cooks out there: Can you suggest an alternative to the sweetened coconut in the breading? I realize the name would have to be changed, but I'm just not nuts about sweetened coconut and all else sounds excellent. Any ideas? If you have any, please respond here and I'll check back. Thanks for sharing!

I admit I have not tried this sauce but the coconut shrimp batter is excellent. The cayenne adds subtle depth and not too much heat. It is very thick and allows for maximum coconut coverage, which gives them a wildly delicious look. I developed my own lime cream dipping sauce which is simply sour cream, lime juice, a touch of salt and honey, and was very satisfied with the contrasts in flavors and the balance of sweet and sour.
