I had roasted eggplant and peppers a few days ago, and found this recipe today! Great timing! I'm taking this as my brown bag lunch today to meet with some new people...I halved the recipe, and added a dash of teriyaki sauce to the sesame butter. I also increased the cumin and cayenne a bit. I plan to eat it as a tapa, with added chopped hard boiled egg and sliced avocado... will report back!

Easy and flavorful. I served it surrounded by fresh mixed greens. It tasted great the following day served over lightly salted diced chicken with green salad.

I loved this recipe; it was easy, flavorful and healthful. In fact, the olive oil could be cut down further if fat were an issue. I didn't make the sesame spread; instead I used the roasted eggplant on top of greens for a salad one day and also rolled up in a tortilla with hummus the next. Fabulous flavor.

My partner and I loved this salad. It is important to make it far enough in advance to let the dressing soak into the roasted vegies. The sesame spread is a little strange but the taste of the toasted sesame seeds is a nice contrast to the salad.
