This review is only for the chicken and relish, since I did not make the beans. I substituted skinless chicken tenders to cut back on fat. The chicken had mild, freshing spiciness and zing from the lemon and chiles. I didn't think I would be a fan of the relish since this recipe brings together such different textures, but the coolness of the avocado with some relish for snap was a welcomed compliment to the chicken. I've made this several times and recommend trying at least once for something new.

The chicken was ok. The rest was...I'm sorry, I thought disgusting. My husband liked it all. The smell lasted in the whole house for a week!!
