Incredibly creamy and delicious - I encourage everyone to try this recipe at least once! I love baked custard with nutmeg on top, and this is like a delicious ice cream version. I ended up using 2 tbsp less sugar, and it was still plenty sweet; will probably reduce sugar by 3-4 tbsp next time. Also, added 1/4 tsp more nutmeg than called for. (Maybe my nutmegs were older and didn't have as much flavor?) This is such an easy and fast recipe, I can see making it all the time to accompany pumpkin pie, apple strudel, etc. Enjoy!

Truly out of this world. I think it was the creamiest thing I've ever tasted in my life. My guests couldn't stop raving over it.

I wasn't sure how this would taste, but I'm glad I tried it, I plan to make some more tonight. My husband loves it too.

I have made this ice cream several times--use freshly grated nutmeg. It's a great match with thanksgiving deserts--it's become a tradation. Another tradition--my father waiting to lick the bowl.

Absolutely wonderful! I made gingerbread on a jelly roll sheet and spread the ice cream on it, then rolled it up on froze it. It was great!

I was surprised how easy this was to make. I served it with pears poached in a red wine sauce. It was wonderful and a nice substitute to vanilla ice cream. Be sure to use fresh nutmeg; the flavor is awesome.
