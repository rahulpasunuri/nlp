Too sweet for my liking, and not enough variation in the ingredients. I would rather put the effort into making Nanaimo Bars for a more complex square!

Really quick and easy to make, the toughest part is cutting the squares after they cool! I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the bittersweet chocolate and they turned out fine. To speed things up, melt the chocoate in the microwave, way easier and just as effective!

I made this for my family and my boyfriend's family for mother's day and everybody loved it. I have to say it is very sweet and rich in chocolate. So I made the recipe again and doubled the crust (graham crackers and coconut) and my family loved it even more. I also sprinkled some coconut on top for a slight decoration and to make the chocolate part taste like a coconut haystack. Pure perfection!!

Very easy to make, intensely chocolate, almost like fudge on a cookie but much less sweet. I have made this recipe twice for parties and it has been a great success. Use only very high quality chocolate and cut no more than 1" square. These are so intense that many people find even that size too large. A very grown-up dessert.
