I've made this 3 times and the only change I made is to vary the beer. A lager seems to work best for my tastes.

I agree with HobbesGirl from Rossland BC, hardly any of these reviews are for this actual recipe followed as written....

I made this yesterday using ground pork and beef, one pound each. I also added two cans of drained red beans and 29 oz of tomato sauce. The biggest change was that instead of mole, I used two dried chipotle peppers wrapped in cheese cloth and thrown in the pot. This gave it a wonderful, complex heat that it doesn't have otherwise. This is my new staple chili recipe.

This wonderful chili recipe has become a favorite at our house; however, I caution y'all to be concious about the beer that you use. I used a very dark beer thinking it would add a nice robust flavor which it did, BUT I also found it left a slightly bitter aftertaste which I, personally, didn't enjoy...others might. To balance the flavors more to my liking, I doubled the tomato sauce, added a can of diced tomatoes, and also (because I like them) some white beans. Lastly, I couldn't find mole poblano so I just used plain mole. LOVED this chili in the end...and so did everyone else!

Followed the recipe pretty closely. Went cheap on the beer with some Natural Light, probably should have used a darker beer. Turned out great, everyone that had some liked it. I used some fresh made roasted tomatillo salsa instead of the green chili sauce. It did take it about 3 hours to thicken up to where I like it.

I'm about to make this recipe that has 4 forks but reading the reviews I find that 90% of you have modified it from the start. Then it isn't really Ryan's Revenge you are reviewing.

Good recipe and easy to modify (a little more fire) if one desires.

I would NOT skip the mole in this recipe as the cocoa flavor gives the chili a wonderful, complex note to it. In fact, the first time I made this I doubled the recipe, and instead of 3 teaspoons accidentally added 3 TABLEspoons of mole. The only thing I could think to even out the flavor was to add a small can of tomato paste, a can of diced tomatoes w/green chiles (Rotel) and a bunch of garlic salt. It STILL turned out pretty great! Although I would definitely recommend using the proper amount of mole! :) The only changes I make to this recipe are: adding one can of diced tomatoes with green chiles (Rotel) along with the tomato sauce, and instead of the green chile sauce I use a small can of diced green chiles. I de-seed and de-vein the anaheims but also add a whole diced jalapeno, seeds and all. For the beer I use whatever bock-style beer I've got laying around. Texans seem to agree, this is good stuff!

Since this recipe uses a combined 28oz. of water & beer, I used 2 bottles of good old Huber Bock, and 4oz. water. I added 1 can diced tomatoes W/green chilies, and 1 can white kidney beans, both drained. I marinaded the meat in sherry, salt, pepper, cornstarch, and oil. I did the browning of the meat, and the cooking of the peppers & onions in a wok. I also used 2 whole peppers, because the produce guy yelled at me for trying to cut one in half. Didn't have the mole, so I added some After Death sauce and Jamaican Hellfire Doc's Special, to taste. I used 7 tbsp. Penzey's Hot Chili powder. The combination of searing the meat in the wok, and the slow cooking made the meat really tender. It turned out great. It probably doesn't need the extra heat, but I have no point of reference, because I'm a chilehead.

Great flavor, I received many compliments on this recepie. I like a more tomato based chili, so I used these modifications: Add as many cans diced tomatoes as you like for the chunky tomatoes; an 8oz can(or more or less, depending on what you like) tomato puree, and rinsed low-salt kidney beans to your liking (I doubled batch so used one 26oz & one 15oz can). I skipped mole, and substituted green chili sauce with one small can diced mild green chilies. I skipped lime juice, as it would get lost adding so much tomato product, but served with lime wedges for squeezing over individual bowls. I also doubled batch, but tripled the beer & spices mixture so that the flavor would hold up to the tomatos. I also used ground beef in place of the sirloin and kept the pork pieces small. Extra sharp high quality cheddar on top or pepperjack for more spice. Best chili ever.

This is a great recipe, but I changed it because I am a vegetarian, so I am submitting my version of this recipe. IT IS AMAZING!!! Maryse's Vegetarian Chili 1/2 12-ounce bottles of beer 5 1/2 tablespoons chili powder 2 tablespoons ground cumin 1 tablespoon paprika 2 teaspoons beef flavored soy bouillon cubes 1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more if necessary 6 bags of BOCA GROUND SOY 1 pack of taco or fajita seasoning (Old El Paso works well) 2 Cans of Goya Red Kidney beans 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper 1 large onion 1 pack of cherry tomatoes sliced in half 4 tablespoons of butter 5 cloves of garlic, minced 4 ounces tomato sauce 1 tablespoon of Adobo 1 tablespoon ground coriander 1 tablespoon green chili sauce 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice Grated Monterey Jack cheese (for garnish), optional 1. Combine the beer, chili powder, cumin, paprika, bouillon cubes, and oregano in a large, heavy pot. Add 1 1/4 cups of water. Bring the mixture to a boil, then, remove from the heat. 2. Place 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Saute the chopped onion until it is mostly transparent, then, add soy meat in small batches, seasoning with TACO SEASONING PACKET and the chopped garlic, until brown. Transfer the meat to the pot with a slotted spoon. 3. Stir in tomato sauce, tomatoes, Goya beans, Adobo, butter, coriander, green chili sauce, and sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 2 hours. 4. Just before serving, stir in lime juice. Serve with grated cheese, if desired. TIP: Works really well over nacho chips if you feel like a big plate of nachos with sour cream, scallions, cheese and salsa.

This was a good and simple recipe. Does take a while to boil down, but worth the wait. Use top quality meat for better results (I used top sirloin) and be sure to cut pieces all the same size so they brown evenly. I used brown sugar and thickened sauce at the end with lo-fat sour cream--it was thick and creamy!

This is also great with beans added or add vegetables such as potatoes,carrots, peas to make a wonderful and very different stew. I also add hotter peppers-jalepeno...

I have just finished making this wonderful chili and made the following changes. Like the reviewer in Encinitas I am also finding that I am having to either thicken the chili or wait for some liquid to boil off. I DID however add extra moisture becuase I usually don't like extremely thick chili and thought I'd avoid this problem from the get go. I used the suggestion from the Stamford, CT. reviewer and left out the Mole Poblano sauce. Instead I soaked one dried Chipotle chili (not in adobo sauce) in a bowl covered with boiling water for 12 minutes, chopped it up and sauteed it with the onions, garlic (I used 6 good-sized cloves of garlic) and Aneheim chiles, and tossed the soaking water into the pot to add smokiness. I used "New Mexico Hot" style chili powder (the kind that comes in see-through bags at the grocers) and used Herdez brand green table sauce for the green chili sauce. Instead of the cubes of meat I used regular ground beef, 15% fat, and regular ground pork(fatty) and browned them in a pan. I used my spoon to chunk the meat into 1/2-inch chunks and they have stayed together now after approx. 1 3/4 hr.s simmering. I used brown sugar instead of white. I added one can of Bush's Chili Beans (drained slightly) and am thinking about adding another can because we like beans in our chili. I followed the recipie in all amounts for everything else except I added about an extra half cup of water in the begining as well as the 1/3 cup of chili-soaking water. The sauce is wonderfully spicy, but not burningly so. Just a real good kick and well-rounded in flavor and texture. I would make this recipie again any time. I'm just tired of waiting for the darn thing to be ready and am having trouble keeping my boyfirend out of the kitchen and from dipping into the pot before it's ready! Enjoy!

I loved this rich chili with a couple of modifications.Skip the mole poblano sauce, add hot sauce of your choice to taste, skip green chile sauce & use small jar of green chilis instead & add an ancho chili that has been soaked in water til tender to the pepper mix as this brings body & enriches the dish over all. Husband could not wait for dinner after tasting it & asked for seconds.

I have made this in the past and it is fabulous. However, I made it last weekend and the meat was very dry. This has never happened in the past. Do you think I over-browned the meat? Please help. And, it was good meat, maybe too good, maybe need a little more fat content. Thanks for your help

My neighbor made this for a chili cook off for our Fourth of July party. It was really good. It won hands down. She had to cook it a lot longer to burn off some of the liquid. Other than that, it was awesome. My chili came in second which is from this site (Cashew Chicken Chili which is really good as well).
