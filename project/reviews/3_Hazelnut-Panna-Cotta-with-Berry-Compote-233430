We made this for a big party and it got rave reviews. We put it in clear plastic cups with the compote on top and the cups all looked so festive. Love this recipe!

This did not turn out for me, unfortunately! It was too firm, so perhaps I used too much gelatin, although I thought I followed the recipe exactly. The flavor was good, though, very rich and smooth.

Yummy! I made this for my boyfriend, and I caught him licking the plate afterwards. It has a very nice, subtle flavor, pleasantly tangy from the creme fraiche. Also I loved how simple this recipe is and that I could prepare it entirely in advance. If I made it again, I might try steeping the nuts in the milk a little longer to deepen the flavor.

I brought this to our family's Christmas gathering, and what a treat! It had a light, nutty flavor along with a very creamy texture. The berry compote added was just the right (simple) complement to the wonderful hazelnut flavor. An excellent dessert highlighting our Northwest's delicious offerings!
