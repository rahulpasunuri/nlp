My husband is a shortbread junkie. I've tried lots of recipes, but this is his favorite. The cornstarch makes it a bit crispier and not as dense and moist. It's a slight difference, but one he really likes. I love the brown sugar taste.

Simple, easy and tasty if you enjoy shortbread as I do. I generally cook recipes pretty close to the original the first time - so I know what I'm dealing with. This has a slightly lighter, softer texture than many shortbread recipes. Not too crispy or hard. It's a great base for other types of cookies that perhaps have a custard or berry topping. Think of it as a foundation for other possibilities. Next I'll make this with a date-nut-honey filling with an oatmeal streusel topping. The Adventurous Foodie

This recipe was a good and simple and a very fast and easy recipe, but has some flaws. The first time I made the, they came out terribly burned because of the improper baking time and the few cookies I could salvage enough to taste were not sweet enough. The second time I baked them (the same day, since it was so quick!) I used twice as much brown sugar, and added some lemon zest and rum for flavor. I baked for 15 minutes (tops) at 350 and then topped with powdered sugar when cooled. I know shortbread isn't usually topped with sugar, but thought I should spice them up since it was for a Holiday. With the proper adjustments, this recipe could be a great quick fix recipe. :)

So easy and good. I started with microwaved (liquified) butter and they came out fine. Next time I'll try some fun additions, like lemon zest, or walnuts, or five spice powder.
