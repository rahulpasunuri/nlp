I made this as directed and it was delicious and easy. A great way to dress up chicken with minimal fuss. My husband even loved it and he never loves chicken. It took less than five minutes to debone the breasts and I think having the prosciutto/cheese mixture under a layer of crisp chicken skin is what made the dish. . . don't skip this step!

The flavors were amazing! Learning lessons, I realized after cooking that having used skinless breasts and pounding thin with the stuffing tucked nicely inside that I should have shortened the cooking time! Tasted good but would have been delicious and will be the next time since I will definitely make it again!

Amazing! Will definitely make again. We used boneless, skinless breasts and flattened them. Put the cheese mixture in center and rolled. Browned in pan, cooked in oven. Wrapped with extra proscuitto. Made extra sauce and used not only the drippings from the fry pan, but also the drippings from the baking sheets to flavor the sauce. WOW! Served with a garlic/parmesan orzo and green beans with garlic, lemon & parsely. Everyone raved about it!

Loved this recipe, although did not use breasts with skin. Rolled breast around filling, secured with a toothpick and followed recipe as written. Will definitely try others' suggestion and bake at 350 for 20 minutes after browning on each side. In that case, sauce would be finished about the same time as the chicken - the sauce is fantastic! The chicken went great with orzo mixed with a little butter some of the shredded fontina and chopped basil. Will definitely make again.

So delicious. Read all the reviews, sautéed for 3 minutes each side, then popped into 350 oven for exactly 20 minutes. Just perfect for our dinner party coming up. Sauce delicious ! Husband loved it and chicken not always his first choice. Very nice looking dish, and so tasty. Also, I used the exact ingredients , Nice combo of Boursin, Fontina, prosciutto, and basil!

Used chicken cutlets instead..Lightly season with kosher salt and pepper because there's plenty of salt in the Fontina and the Garlic & Herb mix. I added 3 Tbsp fresh basil instead. It makes the difference. Spooned the cheese mix unto flattened cutlets and then rolled it and clasped it with the toothpicks. Searing very important..Next time I'll will try using wild mushrooms mixed in with fresh herbs and grated parmesan cheese..So simple and elegant! Must husband gave it an A+

Absolutely delicious and surprisingly easy to make. Hard to find boneless breast with skin on, but the butcher at my local grocery store was happy to debone the chicken breasts for me. The sauce was rich and very tasty. Make sure to reduce it enough so that it's not watery.

Made it last night--my husband loved it! I used skinless chicken breasts and stuffed the filling inside of them, though there was a little left over.

I followed the recipe except I used my All-Clad pan instead of a non-stick skillet, and it was easy to make and delicious! My two-year old and 8-year old daughters as well as my husband enjoyed it! We normally don't like chicken breasts, but they were moist.

For those who have skinless chicken on hand or don't like skin on chicken, I altered the recipe by pounding the chicken with a mallet to make it thinner and stuffed the inside of the chicken with the cheese mixture. I also added a few fresh basil leaves. I pinned it together with a toothpick, seasoned the outside with salt and pepper, browned it as the recipe read and baked it in the oven until cooked through. It was excellent!

Delicious! This is a simple recipe with big taste! I added extra cheese (I had big chicken breasts) and a little extra prosciutto. I paired it with mashed potatoes infused with oregano, garlic, parsley, and red pepper butter. The whole meal was excellent, and I will definitely add this to my recipe box!

Next time I plan to bring the chicken for a few hours before I cook it. i found the final product not to be moist enough. Very flavorful so worth the extra step.

This was delicious. The marsala was a wonderful addition. My only problems involved correct assembly, I had trouble keeping everything together.

Want to add one more thing - I served this with this browned orzo recipe and it was a great match - http://www.lcbo.com/lcbo-ear/RecipeController?language=EN&recipeType=1&action=recipe&recipeID=4961

This chicken is FABULOUS! Due to availability, I made a couple of small changes - used cheddar/parm mix instead of fontina, and used serrano ham instead of prosciutto. I also just pan seared the chicken (3-4 mins/side) and then finished cooking it in the oven at 350F for about 20 minutes. It turned out perfectly and also worked well because I made 6 chicken breasts and they didn't all fit in the pan at once. I thought the stuffing flavour was amazing, and I liked how it turned out, with stuffing under the skin. YUM! Make this for people you like - it's so good!

This was very easy to follow and quite tasty. I preprepared the mixture the night before which made it even easier during the weeknight. My only suggestion is that the fontina wasn't well tasted, but a lot of our cheese came out because we used boneless skinless chicken breasts and had to cut a pocket in the chicken. We served this with a creamy vegetable polenta (frozen) and it went very well together.

Very quick and easy! There is more than enough natural salt from the ingredients that you don't also need to add it to the chicken or anything even with the low sodium broth. Not a big fan of salt.

Amazing recipe. Easy and super delish! It's kinda like chicken saltimbocca. Served it with pasta with a sage butter sauce and basic mixed greeen salad with italian dressing. My kids (3 & 5), wife and I loved it. Would be a great dish to wow guests with!

This recipe was perfect for my dinner party for 9, as it was easy to finish preparing right as my guests arrived, and then to keep warm for an hour in the oven during cocktails, etc. before serving. Everyone loved it, and even our sole vegetarian was inspired to try it - she loved it! I also doubled this recipe without issue.

Absolutely delicious. I made this for my boyfriend and he went crazy. I used boneless skinless organic chicken and slit the breasts down the center for filling. Then wrapped the stuffed breast with the remaining prosciutto for maximum flavor and to keep the breast together. Follow the instructions for cooking the chicken and you can't go wrong. Mine was tender and juicy. Served over orzo this was a fantastic dinner. We will have this again.

this was super easy and fast to make for a week night dinner, but came out elegant, as if for a dinner party. the marsala sauce was easy and made the chicken taste even better. i loved it, but my husband never eats chicken skin, so he pulled it off... but the flavor from the melted cheese and prosciutto infused into the meat, so he still got to enjoy it.

Yummmm! Made this for mother's day, everyone loved and raved about it like crazy. Served with long grain/wild rice. Modifications: used dried basil instead of fresh, used boneless skinless chicken breasts and just cut slit for thin pocket. As I needed to feed 5 and had 6 breasts, I doubled the stuffing amount--had some leftover, so when it came to the sauce (made 1 1/2 of it), instead of adding more butter at the end (did not need anyway having used nonstick skillet), I added in the leftover stuffing. Turned out simply wonderful and would not change a thing next time (and there WILL be a next time!!).

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts to stuff, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was heavenly and tasted gourmet. This recipe turned me on to prosciutto! I also used the same stuffing for baked potatoes--it was also delicious. Great recipe!

Used skinless boneless chicken breast pounded out, stuffed, and rolled with prosciutto. Where do you get just boneless chicken breast? Could never find the chicken breast with skin (no bones). This was so "gourmet" according to my boyfriend. Might make for my next foodies unite gathering:)

Truly awesome! Really! Used skinless chicken breast and wraped them in the extra prosciutto so the stuffing wouldn't fall out. We will eat again and again.

That's why Iove this website: got a great idea for stuff I already had (I am housebound). Did chicken with fontina, black-forest ham, spinach, cream cheese (sprinkled it with Italian seasoning), rolled it up as told, and sprinkled fresh tarragon over it with the sauce when done. Delcious and so easy.

Followed recipe exactly with no problems. Easy but special. Will try on company soon.

Certainly over your daily saturated fat content but so damn good. And fast and easy. Paired with polenta with corn from another chicken recipe on this site and an artichoke. Love the marsala sauce. Definitely making this again. Good for week night or company.

I had leftover chicken breasts so I made this into a prosciutto/cheese sauce. Very good. I also added spinach and broccoli and served it over rigatoni. Yum!

this was delicious, a lot of flavor. I didn't realize the recipe called for chicken with skin and bought chicken breasts skinless but decided to pound then thin and wrap around the stuffing. I think the sauce could have been thicker, maybe add a little roux next time. I also didn't have marsala on hand so used a little white wine and it was just fine.
