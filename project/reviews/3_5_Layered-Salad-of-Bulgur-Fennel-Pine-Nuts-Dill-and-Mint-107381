No bulgur at the market, so I used whole-wheat couscous and soaked it in water first. No fennel either so I did matchstick celery root which had a nice flavor but I think missed on the texture it needed. Next time I'd just leave it out. My husband and I liked it a lot, our guests were politely non-committal (but then they admitted when I served a cucumber cooler that they weren't cucumber fans).

I have made this salad numerous times, always to rave reviews. If you are concerned about over lemony results, you can add additional olive oil at the end. Or as the previous reviewer suggests, substitute some of the lemon juice with water, then add grated lemon zest at the end.

Excellent recipe! I cut the lemon juice to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup water. More than that would be overwhelming and I'm a lemon freak! I left out the fennel because we're not fans. Refreshing herby salad and very attractive served in a pretty glass bowl. By the way I used medium bulgar and it was perfect.
