I did a really bare-bones version of this, ommitting a number of ingredients, adn it was still really good!

This was my first attempt making Banh Xeo and I was disappointed. I used the pre-made mix as others recommended and had a terrible time with pan sticking even with plenty of oil. The crepes also fell apart easily. Also, it turns out we don't really like the taste (or smell) of fish sauce, perhaps it's an aquired taste if you're not used to the flavor! Glad I tried it but I won't make again.

Re: A Cook's question on 4/25. The only thing you have to add to pre-mixed flour bought in an asian supermarket is water. Mung beans are optional. It's actually best if you pre-make the batter at least a few hours before cooking (or overnight and refridgerate covered), so that all the ingredients have time to mingle (same as recommended for French crepes).

Although this recipe is time consuming, it was worth it. All of my friends found it very authentic. I suggest making everything in advance and just cooking it up when it's time to eat.

the coconut milk,water, and the flour,although i do suggest using the asian rice flour...it makes for a much lighter crepe rather than the trad french version..dont have to use the beans

To the review on 4/25/07... Buying the pre-made flour sounds like the way to go. What do I mix with the pre-made flour in order to make the crepes? Thanks

I am Vietnamese. I have made these crepes numerous times. I can also attest that this recipe is quite authentic. The only addition I would make is the flour can be purchased pre-mized at many Asian grocery stores. Ask any attendant for "Banh Xeo" flour. It comes in a plastic pouch with a small upper partition for yellow tumeric powder.
