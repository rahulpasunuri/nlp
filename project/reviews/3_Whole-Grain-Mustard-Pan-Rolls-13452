These came out as expected; basic pan rolls with a very heavy mustard flavor, with a nice maple glaze on top. The first time I made them, it was difficult to tell whether the yeast was proofing in the butter and milk mixture, and I ended up with a dud. The second time, I successfully proofed the yeast in a 1/2 cup of water and reduced the milk to 3/4 cup to compensate. The rolls were somewhat dense and very white, so next time I'll go with half whole wheat flour, a little less mustard, and perhaps a short 3rd rise.

These are absolutely delicious! I made some for some clients (but snuck a taste!), and they raved about them. I'm making them again tonight for my husband and his parents to go along with a New Year's Eve lobster dinner. Yum!

Excellent basic, tasty pan rolls. Something came up, so I inadvertently let the dough rise for 2 hours the second time, then punched it down (thereby needing in the glaze and seeds), reformed it, and let it rise again a third time, and it still turned out great. Baking times are exact--all in all, easy and a very no-mess yeast bread.

These were yummy and went great with the Christmas ham! Made as written.

This worked really well with our ham and even though I'm not a baker, they turned out great!
