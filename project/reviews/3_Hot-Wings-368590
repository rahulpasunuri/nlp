This is hands down the WORST wings recipe I have ever tried! There is nothing to it but, well... hot. No depth of flavor, no intrigue. Nothing but a frat boy dare to see how many you can eat before you chug your beer.Frank's Hot Sauce is far better than this recipe and I'm not fond of that stuff either. And Tuna I agree; what up with the recipe amount???

There's a lot to be desired here...considering I live an hours drive to Buffalo...but right off the bat the idea that six wings would feed two people is pretty silly.
