Well I accidentally put the garlic in with the beef mixture- it was still great! Loved the blue cheese surprise.

Like the cook from Carrollton, we put the blue cheese on top of the just-turned burgers. Great flavor for very little fuss.

Very nice. Was a wonderful dinner paired with vegetables.

I would make this recipe again, making larger patties to contain more of the cheese. After cooking, the blue cheese flavor was barely noticeable. Maybe it oozed out? I might try slatering some of the caramelized shallot and blue cheese dip (recipe at this site) on the toasted bread instead. That dip is awesome!

Used this recipe on a campout so to simplify, I just spread the cheese (I used a soft blue)on top when I flipped the burgers. By the time they were done, the cheese had melted. We grilled the onions and bread over the fire and nearly fainted when we tasted the wonderful combination of flavors. Heaven!

Very easy to put together and looks great on the plate (until you take the first bit.) I would make this again.

I MAKE EIGHT PATTIES AND THEN PLACE THE CHEESE ON FOUR OF THEM.I THEN PLACE THE OTHER FOUR PATTIES ON TOP OF THE FIRST FOUR.

This was a tasty burger. Also quick and easy. I substituted Mediterranean Feta Cheese in place of the roquefort.

We skipped the toasted bun stuff. This is really a simple idea rather than a recipe. Anyway, we love blue cheese and the melted cheese in the burger was delicious.

These were great! Made a couple of convenience changes. Broiled in oven instead of grilling which can be a hassle--especially midweek. Cooked onion and bread on griddle pan on stovetop. This was an excellent,simple meal--since our grill is a gas one, we didn't really lose much in the way of flavor.
