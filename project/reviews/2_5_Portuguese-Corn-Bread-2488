I sought out this recipe because I wanted to make some corn meal-containing small buns for sliders. The recipe as given is a nice, chewy corn bread, but too much corn for what I had in mind. I ended up making a batch of white bread and kneading the two together, getting just what I was after--lighter, but still pronounced corn meal flavor.

Oops - that should have been "with a _mild_ bean-based . . . soup" and _1/4_ tsp pepper for the half-loaf.

I made this because I didn't have enough regular unbleached bread flour for my weekly bake - split the batch in half, and cranked the peppermill a few times over the half-batch before kneading; left the other half unpeppered. Interesting with the pepper - would be nice "for a change" with a milk bean-based or cream-style soup, but not as a regular thing. We found a slight bitterness from the pepper, altho I didn't use anything like what the recipe called for - maybe 1/2 tsp. Better (in fact, really nice) without the pepper - OK, I also subbed about-to-turn-sour milk for 1/2 cup of the water, which may have helped it not be dry, or as crumbly as regular cornbread. Makes good sandwiches (with the right filling); nice toasted with a little butter and some maple syrup drizzled over, too. Anybody know what makes this "Portuguese"? The pepper?

Dry and bland.

This is good. I used it to make rolls for a middle eastern style lamb burger and it was really good. Whole family loved it.

I thought this bread was gross, sorry - don't waste your time. My husband couldn't even eat it, and he eats everything.

I've made this twice now and it is not worth the effort. This tastes like a regular cornbread recipe.

Lovely, light yet chewy (i'm eating it warm from the oven now!) with a little kick from the pepper and a nice nuttiness from the corn...delightful. i will definitely make it again.
