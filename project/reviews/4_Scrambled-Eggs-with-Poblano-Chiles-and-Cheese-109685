This wasn't as spicy as I hoped. Sauce was pretty bland, even though I doubled the chili powder. Maybe my poblano was too mild, too. Overall, liked the flavors and the idea of it all, but will do something to spice it up more next time.

I love, love, love this breakfast but I call it breakfast chili rellenos. It definitely takes some preparation time but it is well worth it. I've made it twice now and it was a big hit both times.

Great breakfast/brunch dish for company. As some suggested, using Rotele in place of the diced tomates would be a nice change. As written this is by no means spicy. I served this with toasted English muffins and breakfast sausages.

This dish was very easy to make! Substituted with jarred jalapeno pepper -- delicious and mild. Decided not to puree the salsa for a chunkier effect. Will use the left over salsa with chips!

great and relatively easy- i made this for a brunch of 10, and it was very well-received. you can make everything up to the eggs step ahead of time, which is great for parties.

This was amazing and so easy to create! Being 16 i'm always looking for an easy way to alter old recepies and this twist on scrambled eggs was amazing.

Excellent! I didn't have the cheese . . . can't wait until next weekend to try with salty/briny addition of cheese, along with some refried beans. Nice change from the biscuits with sausage gravy found in my area of the country.

Exceptionally flavorful and festive -- perfect for a Memorial Day brunch. Later in the day, I wished I had made more tomato sauce to enjoy.

Delicious. The tomato sauce is divine. I diced up raw baby tomatoes instead of the canned ones and sauce had nice fresh flavor.

Would maybe add the cheese later or not at all since I think the cheese interfered with the eggs "setting up". I used a canned hot green chili but otherwise followed the recipe. Really good inside a tortilla. I couldn't get enough of that tomato sauce, yum!

TASTY!! I used jalepenos instead of poblanos to add some extra kick to the eegs, then we rolled everything up in the tortillas to make breakfast burritos. This has definitely become one of our favorite weekend breakfasts!

EXCELLENT!!! Super authentic as noted in previous ratings. I used spiced diced tomatoes compared to regular. This one is a sure winner with friends/family.

This dish was delicious & the presentation was beautiful. I didn't have petite diced tomatoes on hand so I used a can of Rotel Mexican Fiesta and it gave a nice spicy kick to the sauce. Scaled the recipe in half and it came out perfect. Served with refried beans, home fries & hot wheat tortillas. Will definitely make again, it's comparable to brunch at the higher end southwest restaurants.

I doubled this dish for 11 hungry people and there was a little left over. It was delicious...after searching for 4 hours, definitely appreciated. I used anaheim peppers, because I couldn't find poblanos, and they were delicious. Thank you.

Just made this recipe for a brunch and it was great. I did add an additional two eggs and a bit more feta (maybe 1/2 cup). Will make again.
