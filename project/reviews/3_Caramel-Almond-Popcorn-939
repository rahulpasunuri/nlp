I'm making this for the umpteenth time this holiday season. I substitute cashews for the almonds, and only leave in oven for about 40 minutes. Then I cool it and (pay close attention, you don't want to miss this part) pour 2 cups melted chocolate chips mixed with 1 tsp shortening over it. Toss to coat, then cool again. Mmmmmm.

I have a tip for those (like me) whose popcorn became grainy in the oven: leave off two things: do not add the baking soda and do not bake in the oven. Simply pour over the popcron and almond mixture and mix well.

Made this last night. I followed the recipe pretty closely, but used a little less popcorn and no almond extract. My caramel was perfect and combined easily with the popcorn and nuts in a big bowl, but after about 35 minutes in the oven, it got grainy, like the other reviewers. Tasty, but not the result I was looking for. I like the oven-dried technique, but this one didn't work for me.

Follow the recipe perfectly, experiment with different toasted nuts. The best I've ever had.

I make this every year for Christmas and everyone loves it. I love the flavor the almond extract gives it. I also have another recipe for a toffee popcorn that I make with pecans and then I mix the two togeher for serving. It always dissapears in record time.

I'm making this a second time because the first double batch was scarfed down by family and friends too quickly! It's very good and addictive - not a smooth caramel coating, but delicious and the nuts make welcome texture addition. Am using hazelnuts and almonds this time, and plan to add some chocolate chips at the end.

I tried this recipe and was very disappointed. It was extremely sweet and the mixture was too clumpy. I than tried the maple pecan popcorn, also on this website. What a difference. It has the perfect sweetness and tastes like a true caramel corn.

Excellent, rave reviews, always get asked for the recipe. For those who get grainy clumps or the caramel hardens too quickly to coat the popcorn, you are cooking the caramel too long or to too high a temperature.

This recipie is great...when given the "Laura touch." I make this as published, then divide into clumps on waxed paper to cool. When still just a bit warm, dip into melted chocolate, melted white chocolate, and allow to dry. Heavenly! Also...mix in different kinds of nuts, mix in coconut, substitute the almond extract with coconut extract. Make a big, delicious experiment...this stuff is to die for.

I made this for Christmas gifts and everyone raved. I was really pleased with the relative ease and fantastic results. I used large disposable aluminum roasting pans for the baking and stirring, and this worked out great. The almond extract was very unique and added an extra element of flavor. I substituted pecans for the almonds, which turned out well, but almonds would have been more complimentary with the almong extract. I did not experience graininess, but got shiny caramel popcorn. This will be an annual favorite at Christmas (and maybe during the year, too).

I've made this several times and have had great results. Although, I set the oven temp at 300. Maybe that's what keeps the sugars from carmelizing. It always turns out shiny, crispy and delicious. I gave it as Christmas gifts to everyone in the office. Rave reviews for glorified caramel popcorn!

I agree that the secret to this recipe is in baking and stirring every 15 minutes. You need a large baking pan. I used a pyrex 13x9 and it wasn't big enough. Also, clean up is easy if you just soak everything in hot soapy water for awhile. My first was perfect, next one was grainy but the flavor was excellent. I will keep making this for family and friends but would like to know if anyone has solved the grainy look. I gather that some who have tried it found that baking is not necessary. Is this correct?

Needs lots more butter and is better with white sugar. Skip the baking soda. In other words find a better recipe!

I needed a recipe for (crunchy) caramel nuts and when I came across this recipe here, I thought, "Close enough". I found it promising when I stirred the nuts into the caramel and long sticky threads formed. I thought I was going to get a grainy caramel. Popped it in the oven, came back later and found that (horrors of all horror!) the caramel was no longer smooth and shiny but grainy!!! oh! the disappointment! Granted I found the flavour terrific, I won't be giving them to my parents as a gift which was what I intended them to be. Will definately appreciate any input on how to make the caramel stay shiny and smooth.

I did a full popper full (whirleypop) of popcorn and doubled the caramel recipe. Used a large stainless steel mixing bowl to stir it together before baking it, much easier than trying to stir it in something flat.

I omitted the almonds and almond extract since family members are allergic to nuts, and the caramel was very tasty. However, the quantity wasn't nearly enough to cover the amount of popcorn that was recommended. If I make this again, I'll use about 1.5 times the amount of caramel for that much popcorn, and will make sure to mix it while still bubbling - it got pretty clumpy trying to mix it after cooling only a few seconds. I'll also be sure to butter my utensils and pans first - this made a difficult to clean mess with the hardened caramel!

Yummy and easy. The nuts are a must, as is the baking. After it had cooked and cooled, I drizzled melted chocolate chips over the whole batch - decadent!

The popcorn seemed really dry. The flavor was good, but the texture seemed a bit off. I tried following one of the other suggestions and using peanuts instead of almonds, it did not help the flavor.

I brought this to the office today for a meeting and everyone ate it right up. Even those who said they didn't really like caramel corn tried a bit and said it was so much better than usual. I did make a bit more caramel than the recipe called for. The almonds were a nice touch, too. I'll probably hang on to this recipe for the holidays.

Much simpler than I had anticipated. The only problem was finding a container large and deep enough so the popcorn would not spill out every time I stirred it (a broiling pan did the trick). Also, if you liberally butter the pan, cleaning up is effortless afterwards (forget the nonstick spray chemicals - this is caramel popcorn, for crying outloud, not granola!). I don't think the added cost of almonds and almond extract were justified. The next time I make it I will use popcorn only, maybe with unsalted peanuts. The caramel can also be made to coat nut mixes. My guests all loved it and took home extra tins that I had prepared. They asked for the recipe.

I love this recipe--it tastes wonderful. Don't be put off by the clumps when you first put it into the oven...stirring it gets rid of them. I give this popcorn as gifts during the holidays and have gotten rave reviews!

I make a caramel corn recipe that was my grandmothers, and it is better than this one. This one is not bad - but whatever you do DON'T skip the baking - if you stir it frequently while in the oven, THAT is what prevents the glumps!!! TRY IT!

I used this recipe with 1/2 bag of microwave popcorn. I cooked it a little to long and it had a burnt after taste, but that was me. also the clumps work them selves when you bake it, once you stirr it a couple of times.

the secret is to mixing is you need a large metal mixing bowl or pot. spray it with a vegatable spray generously. At the last minute put the popcorn, the nut on top, and pour all of the toffee over it at once. stir like mad with a metal spoon with a plastic handle. I don't bake mine either.

This was nothing special. As the other reviews stated it was hard to get it right. I doubled the sauce as one suggested but that didn't even help. The almonds all fall to the bottom and don't stick well to the popcorn. The carmel sauce is too dark. Not at all worth the effort.

I doubled the recipe for the caramel sauce -- this helped out with the "globbiness." Best caramel popcorn we have EVER had. I took it to a party and it received rave reviews! I am adding this to my favorite list!

I have another caramel popcorn recipe that may have a solution to the glumpy problem -- it recommends you put the popcorn (and in this case, popcorn and almonds) in a brown paper bag, add the caramel mixture and shake well (very well, vigorously for about a few minutes). It glumps a little, but not too much and at least almost all of the popcorn has some of the coating on it when all is said and done. Just a suggestion.

Ugh! No matter how I tried, I could not get the carmel sauce to evenly coat the popcorn and nuts. It dried in globby blobs...some corn completely coated and others bare. There must be a trick to this, but I sure don't know what it is.
